###Chapter 1

Evelyn Carter clutched the pregnancy test results as she stepped back into the grand foyer of the Whitmore estate, her fingers trembling. 

"Congratulations, you're one month pregnant. Everything looks perfect."

Was this real? Was she really carrying Nathaniel's child?

Her pulse raced as she pulled out her phone, hesitating before typing a message to her husband. Will you be home for dinner tonight?

The seconds stretched into an eternity. Nathaniel despised interruptions during work hours, and more often than not, her texts went unanswered.

Then—her screen lit up. His reply was curt. Yes. I have something to discuss with you.

Relief washed over her, quickly replaced by nervous energy. She rushed to prepare dinner, her mind spinning. Placing the test results face-down on the dining table, she bit her lip. Was she being too obvious?

By evening, a sleek black limousine rolled into the driveway. Nathaniel emerged, his tailored suit jacket slung over one shoulder, his sharp features illuminated by the golden sunset.

"Nathaniel, you're home." Evelyn hurried forward, reaching for his jacket—but instead, he handed her a stack of papers. Her stomach dropped.

"Read through this. State any demands you have."

Her gaze fell to the first page. Divorce Agreement. The words glared back at her, stark and brutal.

Nathaniel loosened his tie, exhaustion lining his face as he studied her. She still looked so young, with soft cheeks and wide, innocent eyes.

He felt nothing for her. Their marriage had been his grandmother's wish, a transaction to improve the old woman's health. If not for that one night a month ago, he might have forgotten they were even married.

Keeping up this charade was unfair—to both of them.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her stomach, her voice barely above a whisper. "Hypothetically... if I told you I was pregnant, would you still want this divorce?"

Nathaniel's eyes snapped to her abdomen. His jaw tightened. "I told you to take the morning-after pill."

That night had been a mistake—the only slip in three years of a cold, distant marriage.

She flinched, pulling her hand away, but Nathaniel caught her wrist. His grip was firm. "Are you pregnant?"

Her breath hitched. "Answer me first. If I were, would you want this baby?"

"No."

A single word, sharp as a blade.

He released her, and the emptiness in her chest yawned wider. She watched him walk away, blinking back tears. His rejection cut deeper than she'd ever admit.

The dinner she'd spent hours preparing sat untouched, now cold. With a heavy heart, she dumped it into the trash, nausea twisting her stomach.

Her fingers brushed her belly. A tiny life grew inside her—one Nathaniel didn’t want. But I do.

She had been an orphan, cast aside by her adoptive parents when their own twins were born. Only her aunt, Margaret Dawson, had shown her kindness.

All Evelyn had ever wanted was a family. She’d tried so hard to be the perfect wife, but Nathaniel’s heart was stone.

Still, she wouldn’t be alone anymore. Not after this.

Without reading the divorce papers, she signed the last page.

That night, she slept in the master bedroom alone, just as she had for the past three years. Nathaniel, as always, retreated to his study.

The next morning, Beatrice Harrington’s call shattered the silence.

"Evelyn, prepare the second-floor guest suite. A visitor will be staying with you. Make sure she’s comfortable."

The line went dead before Evelyn could ask who it was.

She sighed. Beatrice’s disdain for her was nothing new.

By the time she descended the stairs, Nathaniel had already left for work.

Then, in the afternoon, a woman strode into the living room—flawless, draped in designer labels. Evelyn’s breath caught.

This was the guest? A stunning stranger?
###Chapter 2

A sardonic smile played on Evelyn's lips. Three years ago, this scene would have shattered her. But now that the divorce papers with Nathaniel were signed, it didn't matter how many women paraded through this mansion. None of it concerned her anymore.

Evelyn moved forward. "Hello—"

Before she could complete her greeting, the stunning blonde brushed past her without acknowledgment. The woman surveyed the living room with a critical eye before addressing the butler. "Gregory, these drapes are absolutely dreadful. And this furniture? Outdated by at least a decade. Have everything replaced with my preferred designs by week's end."

Evelyn watched in disbelief as this stranger redecorated what had been her marital home. "Excuse me," she interrupted sharply. "Who exactly are you? We're not redecorating."

The woman turned with a condescending smile. "Victoria Sinclair. Future mistress of Whitmore Manor. Naturally, the decor falls under my jurisdiction."

"Victoria Sinclair?" The name hit Evelyn like a physical blow. So this explained Nathaniel's sudden urgency for divorce. His precious Victoria had returned.

With his beloved back, the temporary replacement could be discarded.

"I see my reputation precedes me." Victoria's smile turned predatory. "Do us both a favor and sign those papers quickly. You've overstayed your welcome by three years."

Evelyn maintained her composure. "How touching. If you loved him so much, why disappear when he needed you most after the accident?"

Three years ago, Nathaniel had been left comatose after the horrific crash. His grandmother Eleanor had desperately sought a bride to continue the family line, but all the society girls who'd once flocked to him vanished overnight.

Evelyn had been Eleanor's caretaker then. The older woman had shown her nothing but kindness, even helping settle her debts. Unable to watch Eleanor's heartbreak, Evelyn had agreed to the marriage.

Everyone—including Evelyn herself—had expected Nathaniel to die. The marriage was meant to be symbolic. Then miraculously, he woke up.

Overnight, Evelyn became the unwanted wife. The Whitmores, Bern City's most powerful family, couldn't bear the scandal of their heir married to a common nurse. Her existence had been hidden ever since.

Victoria's perfect facade cracked. "My brothers forbade it! They locked me away! You stole what should have been mine!"

She drew herself up haughtily. "I'm the Sinclair heiress from Nord City. My brothers control half the financial district. Cross me, and I'll make sure your pathetic family regrets it."

Evelyn's eyes turned to ice. "Touch one hair on their heads, and you'll regret it more."

"Then be smart and sign." Victoria gestured to the documents on the table, satisfaction oozing from every pore. Three years of waiting culminated in this moment.

"They're already signed," Evelyn said flatly.

"At least you're not completely stupid." Victoria produced a check from her designer bag. "A million dollars. Consider it severance pay."

Evelyn didn't even glance at the offered check, her smirk mirroring Victoria's earlier condescension.

"Don't tell me it's not enough!" Victoria scoffed. "This is ten years of your nurse's salary. Take the money and disappear. Nathaniel and I belong together—we're from the same world. You're just... background noise."

Each word struck like a physical blow. Numb, Evelyn retreated to the master suite. Truthfully, she'd planned to leave regardless of Victoria's dramatic entrance.

With the divorce finalized, there was nothing keeping her here.

Packing revealed how little she truly owned—a single suitcase held three years of marriage. It felt like waking from a beautiful dream.

Her gaze fell on the pregnancy test resting on the nightstand. Time to end this chapter.

Victoria barged in without knocking, still clutching the divorce papers. "Finished yet?" Her eyes zeroed in on the medical form. "Wait—is that from the maternity hospital?"

Evelyn snatched up the test, crushing it in her fist. Victoria's eyes widened. "Oh my God. You're pregnant?"
###Chapter 3

Evelyn's fingers trembled around the pregnancy test. "If I were really pregnant, I wouldn't have agreed to the divorce."

Victoria scoffed, flipping her hair over her shoulder. "Of course not. A gold digger like you wouldn’t miss a chance to trap Nathaniel with a baby. But even if you were pregnant, he’d never let you keep it. You’re nothing but a commoner—unworthy of carrying a Whitmore heir."

Evelyn turned toward the walk-in closet, but Victoria blocked her path. "Wait. Show me that paper you took from the nightstand."

A flicker of unease crossed Victoria’s face. What if Evelyn was pregnant? She couldn’t risk it. That baby had to disappear.

Evelyn tightened her grip. "This is private."

"Private?" Victoria sneered. "Or are you just stealing something valuable? Hand it over!" She lunged, clawing at Evelyn’s wrist, her other hand raised to strike.

Instinct took over. Evelyn twisted, flipping Victoria onto the floor with a thud. A shrill cry pierced the air. "My leg! You broke my leg!"

"What the hell, Evelyn?"

Nathaniel’s voice cut through the room like ice. Evelyn spun to face him, her stomach dropping at the fury in his eyes. "Nathaniel, it’s not what it looks like—"

He strode past her without a glance, scooping Victoria into his arms. His gaze snagged on the signed divorce papers beside the bed.

Had she really signed them so fast?

"Nathaniel?" Victoria whimpered.

He blinked, refocusing. "Are you hurt?"

"My wrist!" She cradled it dramatically. "What if I can’t play piano again?"

Nathaniel set her gently on the bed. "You’ll be fine. I’ll call a doctor." Then, his glare locked onto Evelyn. "Apologize."

Victoria Sinclair—heiress to the Sinclair fortune, adored by her three overprotective brothers. If they found out Evelyn had touched her, they’d ruin her.

The irony stung. Their names were so similar—Evelyn and Victoria—yet Nathaniel had never once said hers right.

Even that night, tangled in sheets, he’d whispered Victoria’s name. She’d thought it was just his usual mispronunciation. How foolish.

She’d always been a placeholder.

The ache in her chest sharpened into numbness. "Apologize?" she echoed.

"You attacked her. Even a child knows better. And her hands—do you have any idea what they’re worth?" Nathaniel snarled.

Of course. A single strand of Victoria’s hair mattered more than Evelyn’s entire existence. She was less than dirt beneath their shoes.

Three years of silence. Three years of swallowing every insult. No more.

"I don’t care if you believe me," Evelyn said, lifting her chin. "She started it."

Gregory, lingering in the doorway, cleared his throat. "Mr. Whitmore, I saw everything. Mrs. Whitmore pushed Ms. Sinclair."

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Apologize. Now."

"What if I refuse?"

Surprise flickered in his eyes. Since when did obedient, meek Evelyn talk back?

His voice dropped to a threat. "Think carefully. That uncle of yours—Benjamin, wasn’t it?—still needs that private hospital bed, doesn’t he?"

Benjamin Foster, her only family, comatose after a hit-and-run. Nathaniel had paid for his care—and now wielded it like a weapon.

This was her limit.

Tears burned, but Evelyn refused to let them fall. She looked at Victoria, lounging on her bed beneath her wedding portrait, the picture of smug triumph.

Reality crashed down.

Her voice cracked. "I’m sorry."
###Chapter 4

Evelyn fought to suppress the triumphant smile threatening to break across her face. With practiced grace, she feigned magnanimity. "For Nathaniel's sake, I'll let this slide."

Victoria straightened her posture, her gaze locking onto Nathaniel. "May I leave now?" Every fiber of her being screamed to escape this suffocating room.

She bent to retrieve the discarded divorce papers, thrusting them toward him with renewed determination. This time, her resolve was unshakable.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed as he examined the signed documents. This wasn't the reaction he'd anticipated. Previous attempts had always involved Eleanor's interference - he'd prepared entire arguments to sway the matriarch.

Yet here stood Victoria, compliant without struggle. The ease of it unsettled him.

His eyes flicked to her packed suitcase. "You've arranged accommodations already?"

The question slipped out before he could stop it.

Victoria blinked in surprise. "No." Was that... concern in his voice?

Nathaniel abruptly turned away. "Fetch ice for Evelyn's ankle first. She injured herself because of you - you can't just walk away."

Of course. Always about Evelyn. For one fleeting moment, Victoria had dared hope. Three years of marriage meant nothing compared to his precious first love.

She exited stiffly, each step mechanical. The absurdity burned - the mistress commandeering their marital bed while she played errand girl.

"Pathetic," Victoria chastised herself silently. "Have you no self-respect left?"

Her descent down the staircase turned treacherous when her foot missed a step. Instinctively, she grabbed for the nearest vase, sending it crashing down the steps.

Strong arms yanked her backward.

Nathaniel.

Her back collided with his chest, the steady rhythm of his heartbeat thundering against her cheek. The familiar scent of his cologne enveloped her.

Before she could process the intimacy, he'd swept her into his arms, carrying her down effortlessly. Heat flooded her cheeks at the unprecedented contact - three years of marriage, and this was their first embrace since... that night.

He set her down with clinical efficiency. "Watch your step unless you fancy brain damage," he snapped, though his grip lingered a second too long.

Victoria's gaze fell to the shattered porcelain and scattered soil. "I'll clean this-"

"Let the staff earn their keep." Nathaniel's frown deepened. "Don't you have other obligations?"

The reminder struck like a slap. Evelyn's ice.

Noticing the dirt smeared across Nathaniel's pristine shirt, Victoria opened her mouth to mention it. But he'd already turned toward the master bedroom, apparently unconcerned about his usually immaculate appearance.

Priorities clear.

Returning with the ice pack, Victoria found the bedroom empty save for Evelyn lounging against the headboard.

"Leave it and go," Evelyn purred. "Unless you'd like to attend to my other needs? Or perhaps you're hoping to witness our reunion?" Her smirk turned predatory. "Three years is such a long drought, after all."

The running shower answered Victoria's unspoken question.

Her stomach plummeted. The ink hadn't even dried on their divorce papers, and Nathaniel was already... Her vision blurred. Some reunities required no audience.
###Chapter 5

Evelyn's stomach twisted at the thought of what would soon happen on that bed. Swallowing hard, she forced herself to stay composed and turned toward the walk-in closet to gather her belongings. It didn’t take long to stuff everything into her suitcase.

"Gregory, that suitcase looks expensive. Get her a reusable bag instead," Victoria ordered, her voice dripping with disdain.

Within moments, Gregory returned with a grimy, stained reusable bag and tossed it at Evelyn’s feet. "Here. Use this."

Evelyn knelt to unzip her suitcase, her fingers trembling slightly. Behind her, Victoria added, "Make sure you check her things thoroughly. We don’t want her stealing anything that isn’t hers."

The words sent a chill down Evelyn’s spine. She remembered Nathaniel’s cold declaration about getting rid of the baby. He was just in the bathroom—if he found the pregnancy test, there would be no chance of keeping it.

Gregory and Victoria stood guard at the closet entrance, watching her like hawks. Evelyn glanced at the pregnancy test buried beneath her clothes and made a split-second decision.

Turning slightly to block their view, she tore the test into tiny pieces and shoved them into her mouth, forcing herself to swallow. As she stared at Nathaniel’s neatly hung suits, her heart shattered.

From this moment on, her child would have no connection to the Whitmore family.

Evelyn stepped out of the closet, clutching the filthy reusable bag. "Do you want to inspect this?"

Victoria wrinkled her nose in disgust. "Ugh, get out of here first. That thing reeks!"

She knew once Nathaniel finished his shower, he might hesitate to throw her out. Victoria wasn’t about to let that happen.

Gregory shoved Evelyn forward. "Are you deaf? Move!"

Evelyn walked out of the villa alone. The distance was short, but each step felt like an eternity.

Gregory snatched the bag from her and dumped its contents onto the ground, searching for something—anything—incriminating. But Evelyn had already destroyed the evidence.

She crouched to gather her scattered belongings when her phone suddenly rang. The moment she heard Margaret’s voice, the dam broke.

She had endured Victoria’s cruelty and Nathaniel’s betrayal without shedding a tear, but Margaret’s familiar warmth shattered her resolve. "Aunt Margaret," she choked out.

"Evelyn, why are you crying?"

"I’m getting a divorce," Evelyn whispered. "I’m losing my family all over again."

"Oh, sweetheart, who said you don’t have a family?" Margaret’s voice softened. "That’s why I called—your real family found me. You have three older brothers from the Montgomery family in Nord City."

Evelyn froze. "My… family?"

She had always known she was adopted, but she had never imagined searching for her birth relatives. If they hadn’t wanted her, why bother?

"Don’t cry, darling. Come home. We don’t need those arrogant rich people! Or maybe I can have your brother—"

The call cut off abruptly as Evelyn’s phone died.

Her mind reeled. Had her family truly found her?

"What scheme are you plotting now, Evelyn?"

Nathaniel’s voice cut through her thoughts. He stood in the doorway, his bathrobe loosely tied, his expression unreadable. He had offered her a few more days to process things—yet here she was, already packed and ready to leave while he was in the shower.
###Chapter 6

Nathaniel's gaze swept over the scattered items on the floor. Designer dresses, silk blouses, diamond-studded heels—all left behind.

Evelyn hadn’t taken a single luxury item with her.

Hadn’t she married him for his wealth? He couldn’t comprehend why she’d leave everything behind.

His eyes landed on the worn-out reusable bag in her hand, and his jaw tightened. "Playing the victim again? Who are you trying to fool this time? Grandmother isn’t here to witness your theatrics."

In their three years of marriage, he had never deprived her of anything—except his love. He had been generous.

Even now, with the divorce, he had ensured she would receive a substantial settlement. More than enough to live comfortably for the rest of her life.

Was this truly a farewell, or just another manipulative act?

Evelyn clutched her phone, her mind racing. The news of her long-lost family finding her should have brought joy, but instead, it left her numb.

Lost in thought, she didn’t notice Nathaniel’s sharp scrutiny. To him, her silence was an admission of guilt.

Victoria limped forward dramatically, her voice dripping with false concern. "Nathaniel, she packed her things to leave but insisted on using that filthy bag. I tried to stop her, but she wouldn’t listen."

Gregory, ever the loyal butler, chimed in. "I advised Mrs. Whitmore against it, sir, but she refused. She even threw her clothes on the floor."

Victoria sighed theatrically. "Honestly, she has designer luggage, yet she chooses that rag. If word gets out, people will think the Whitmores mistreated her."

A heavy silence settled over the room. Evelyn stood frozen, absorbing their accusations. Her eyes locked onto Nathaniel’s, waiting—hoping—for him to see through the lies.

His cold voice cut through the tension. "Don’t you have anything to say for yourself?"

Just as she expected. A bitter smile tugged at her lips. "They’ve said it all. What’s left for me to add?"

It didn’t matter what she said. He wouldn’t believe her anyway.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "When will you learn to be satisfied, Evelyn? What more do you want?"

To him, she was nothing but a gold-digger who had trapped him in marriage.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her patience snapping. "What do I want? To live like the trophy wife I was supposed to be. Shopping in Paris, spa days in Monaco—not slaving away in your kitchen for three years!"

Her voice rose, years of resentment pouring out. "I signed the divorce papers. I don’t want to be your wife anymore. Is that so hard to understand?"

For the first time in years, she felt free.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. "Are you finished?"

Confusion flickered in his gaze. He had given her everything—unlimited credit, a lavish allowance, the finest clothes. He had even paid her uncle’s medical bills.

And now, he was offering her a fortune to walk away.

Yet she acted as if he had wronged her.

Evelyn smirked. "Not even close."

"Then by all means, continue."

She tilted her head. "Only if you pay me for my time."

His lips thinned. "Still the same greedy woman, I see. When will you learn that greed only leads to ruin?"

Everything came back to money.

Nathaniel studied her defiant expression, the clarity in her eyes unsettling him. How could someone so deceitful have such luminous, honest eyes?
###Chapter 7

Nathaniel had never imagined marrying Evelyn. But since he had, he could have overlooked her humble origins—as long as she remembered her place. Money was no issue for him, after all.

Yet, time and again, she had stirred trouble. Now, she didn’t even bother pretending. Her true nature was laid bare.

Nathaniel should have felt relieved. But when he saw her signature on the divorce papers, an inexplicable frustration coiled in his chest.

Evelyn’s eyes held a quiet sorrow. She feigned indifference, refusing to let Nathaniel crush her dignity—even in defeat.

Victoria, sensing the tension, smirked. "Evelyn, signing so quickly—did you already find someone else?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. His gaze sharpened, scrutinizing her.

Evelyn met his distrust with defiance. "Of course. If my new man is better, why cling to the past?"

Fury flashed in Nathaniel’s eyes. "Were you cheating while spending my money?"

She glanced at the discarded clothes on the floor. "I’ll return them."

She had only taken the modest pieces, leaving the designer bags untouched.

Nathaniel didn’t spare them a look. His voice was ice. "You’re wearing clothes I bought too."

"I’ll return those as well."

His glare could freeze fire. Meanwhile, Victoria discreetly pulled out her phone, eager to capture the drama.

Evelyn steeled herself. She unbuttoned her blouse slowly, exposing her collarbones, the hint of cleavage beneath.

Nathaniel’s breath hitched. He hadn’t expected her to go this far.

"Enough!" he snarled. "You’re shameless, Evelyn Carter. Get out. I never want to see you again!"

He stormed back into the villa, his back rigid with fury.

Evelyn stopped, a bitter smile touching her lips. He had demanded this.

Her palms were damp. She had been ready to burn everything down.

Victoria lowered her phone, disappointed. "Even if you strip, who’d want to watch? No rich man would waste his time on trash like you."

She sneered. "Stay in your lane, peasant. Stop dreaming above your station."

Evelyn clutched her bag, swallowing the lump in her throat. Sometimes, she envied those born with silver spoons.

When bullied, she fantasized about a powerful family swooping in to defend her.

But life wasn’t a fairy tale. Even if her real family found her now, it was too late.

Then—a deafening roar.

A helicopter landed on the lawn.

Nathaniel, watching from the doorway, froze as armed bodyguards marched toward Evelyn.

They bowed. "Ms. Carter, we’re here to take you home."
###Chapter 8
The bodyguards had come for Evelyn?

She stared at the sleek black helicopter, its blades slicing through the air. Margaret's words echoed in her mind—her real family had been searching for her.

Margaret.

Had they truly sent these men?

Evelyn pinched her wrist, wincing at the sharp pain. This couldn't be real. A helicopter? For her?

Twenty years of longing. Was it finally over?

Victoria scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "What a performance, Evelyn. Where did you hire these actors? Not bad for amateurs." She smirked. "But no matter how hard you try, you'll always be that pathetic orphan."

Her laugh was sharp. "A helicopter? Bet this is your first time seeing one up close, you little nobody!"

Before Evelyn could respond, the nearest bodyguard moved. A crisp slap cracked through the air, sending Victoria stumbling back.

She shrieked, clutching her cheek. "How dare you! Do you know who my brothers are? I'll ruin you!"

Evelyn tilted her head, amused. "Funny. My brother's the devil himself."

Without another glance, she turned toward the helicopter. Behind her, Nathaniel's voice cut through the chaos. "Evelyn! Stop!"

She hesitated—just for a second—then kept walking.

Nathaniel lunged forward, but Victoria clung to his arm. "Look at her! She had her thug hit me!"

He didn't even glance at her. His gaze was locked on Evelyn, cold and unreadable, as she climbed into the aircraft. She was really leaving.

"Face it, Nate," Victoria sneered. "She already replaced you. Why else would some rich bastard send a helicopter the second the divorce was final?"

"Enough." His jaw tightened. He'd thought this was just another one of her games—a desperate attempt to get under his skin. But this... this was real.

Snatching his phone, he barked at his assistant. "Evelyn Carter just left in a private helicopter. Track it. Now."

Victoria scoffed. "Why bother? She's clearly moved on."

Nathaniel's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Shut your mouth. This is for Eleanor. Evelyn's life means nothing to me."

Victoria bit her tongue. Right. The old woman adored Evelyn.

From above, Evelyn watched the city lights blur into streaks of gold. A quiet laugh escaped her.

Free.

Thirty minutes later, the helicopter touched down atop a glittering skyscraper.

Evelyn stepped out to find two lines of black-suited guards flanking her path. In perfect unison, they bowed. "Welcome home, Ms. Carter."

She blinked. Okay, this was... excessive.

At the end of the procession stood two figures—Margaret, and a tall, severe-looking man in a tailored suit.

Her brother? Margaret had mentioned four brothers.

"Oh, darling!" Margaret rushed forward, pulling her into a hug. "You're safe now. That awful marriage is over."

Evelyn nodded, throat tight. "Yeah."

Margaret beamed. "Come, meet Alexander. Your eldest brother."

The man stepped forward, his icy demeanor mirroring Nathaniel's. Power rolled off him in waves.

His gaze swept over Evelyn—too thin, too pale. Something twisted in his chest.

Awkward silence stretched.

Evelyn cleared her throat. "Hi. Nice to meet you?"

Alexander flinched at the formality. Was she afraid of him?

Normally, he commanded boardrooms without breaking a sweat. Now, he fumbled. "Is there... anything you want?"

Evelyn frowned. "Want?"

"Anything at all."

She looked down. "I just want to go home."

Alexander's hands clenched. Home. She meant that dingy apartment.

If he hadn't failed her all those years ago...

(To be continued)
###Chapter 9

At that moment, Margaret tugged at Evelyn’s sleeve. "There’s no need to rush. The rest of your brothers and cousins are on their way. You can go home after you’ve met them. After all, home is where your family is, isn’t it?"

Alexander shot Margaret a grateful look. Without her kindness and care, Evelyn’s life would have been far more difficult. Respectfully, he said, "I’ve already booked rooms for us here. Let’s have dinner at the restaurant first."

Evelyn walked beside Margaret as Alexander led the way. She noticed he wasn’t much of a talker—his demeanor was cool and distant. But one thing was clear: he was loaded.

They descended from the hotel’s rooftop. The lobby was opulent, dripping with luxury—nothing like the places Evelyn had ever been before.

Alexander’s chest tightened at the thought of the shabby apartment Evelyn was planning to return to.

She glanced at him. "Are you okay?"

"Yeah," he muttered, rubbing his eye. "Just something in it. Evelyn, would you consider moving somewhere else?" He had already prepared several estates. Only the grandest would do for his sister.

She shook her head. "No, I’m fine where I am. That place holds memories. No mansion could replace it. I wouldn’t trade it for anything."

Alexander swallowed his words. She was right. He was the one who had lost her all those years ago. He hadn’t been there for her—not once.

No wonder she didn’t care about the properties he offered.

Softly, he conceded, "Alright. Whatever you want."

If Evelyn could live there, so could he. He’d stay by her side no matter what.

Maybe he could buy the entire building. Evict the other tenants, station a few maids nearby—just to ensure Evelyn was always taken care of.

Perfect.

As they reached the lobby, Alexander’s phone buzzed. "Evelyn, it’s my wife. You two go ahead to the restaurant. I’ll catch up."

He stepped aside, answering the call. Olivia’s cheerful voice rang through. "Darling, I’ve brought property deeds, my finest pearls, limited-edition bags, and your brothers’ favorite cars. Let’s see what your sister likes."

Alexander sighed. "We might have to hold off on that."

"Why?"

"Evelyn isn’t as easily swayed as I thought. Money doesn’t impress her."

"I told you, Alexander Montgomery. I told you to wait for me, but no—you had to rush ahead. Do you honestly think your bluntness would win her over? You’ve been apart for years! She probably resents you, and your explanations won’t help. You’re just making it worse!"

He rubbed his temples. "What do I do now?"

He’d been too eager. Business had brought him to the city, and he couldn’t wait to see her.

"You’ve already messed up. The only thing left is a pity play."

"A pity play?"

"Figure it out. Just don’t let her know that while she struggled, you and your brothers lived lavishly."

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Margaret made their way to the restaurant.

Margaret hesitated before speaking. "Your brother seems incredibly wealthy. At least you won’t suffer anymore."

"Rich families aren’t that simple, Aunt Margaret. I don’t even know why I was abandoned. This might just be jumping from the frying pan into the fire," Evelyn murmured.

"Hush! A fortune teller once said you’d live a blessed life."

Evelyn looped her arm through Margaret’s. "Since he sent a helicopter for me, he must know about Nathaniel and me."

"No, he doesn’t. I told him you were working part-time in the village. I knew you didn’t want your relationship with Nathaniel public, so I kept it quiet."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. Good.

Suddenly, her adoptive parents, Beverly and Walter Simmons, stormed in, shouting. "You ungrateful wretch, Evelyn Carter!"

"We took you in when no one wanted you! And now that you’ve found your rich family, you’re ready to toss us aside? We saved you!"
###Chapter 10

Evelyn's smile vanished the moment she spotted Walter and Beverly. "How dare you show your faces here and claim to be my saviors?" Her voice dripped with icy contempt. "When I was starving in your house, it was Aunt Margaret who sneaked me food. And in the end, you even forced her to take me in."

Margaret gasped. "How did you two find this place? I never told anyone about it."

Beverly planted her hands on her hips, her lips curling into a sneer. "Oh, please, Margaret. We're Evelyn's legal guardians. Did you really think you could steal all the credit?"

Walter spat on the polished marble floor, his beady eyes gleaming with greed. "Exactly. Where's her real family? They must be loaded if they're staying at a place like this. They owe us compensation."

They had never imagined the girl they'd picked up off the streets would belong to such wealth. This was their golden ticket.

Evelyn stepped protectively in front of Margaret, her gaze sharp as a blade. "Keep dreaming. You won't get a single cent from me. Because of you, Uncle Benjamin got into a fight and ended up in the hospital."

Her voice cracked. "If you hadn't skipped out on your debts and delayed treatment, he wouldn't have been lying there, barely alive."

Margaret's eyes welled up. If not for their cruelty, Evelyn would never have agreed to marry Nathaniel—a man on death's doorstep—just to pay Benjamin's medical bills.

Walter shifted uncomfortably, but Beverly's face twisted with rage. She lunged forward, hand raised. "You ungrateful brat! I'll teach you some respect!"

"Who dares touch my sister?"

A voice, cold and lethal, sliced through the air.

Alexander Montgomery strode forward, his presence alone enough to freeze the blood in their veins. A dozen bodyguards flanked him, their expressions unreadable.

Beverly recoiled, her bravado crumbling. "I-I'm disciplining my daughter. This is none of your business!"

Alexander's eyes darkened. "She's my sister. When was she ever yours?"

Walter's face lit up with greed. He rubbed his hands together eagerly. "Ah, so you're her real family? Raising her wasn't easy, you know. Compensation is only fair, right? Without us, she'd be dead in a ditch somewhere."

"How much?" Alexander asked flatly.

"One million dollars should cover it," Walter said quickly.

Beverly elbowed him. "Five million!"

Alexander scoffed. "Five million? My sister is worth at least a hundred million."

Their jaws dropped. A hundred million? That was more money than they could spend in three lifetimes.

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "You think you deserve a single penny? I'd rather burn that money than give it to you."

Margaret trembled with fury. "You locked her in a cellar without food! She was half-dead when I found her! And now you have the audacity to demand money?"

Evelyn squeezed her hand. "Aunt Margaret, don’t waste your breath on them."

Walter's face turned purple with rage. He raised his fist. "You little—"

Alexander moved faster than lightning. His kick sent Walter crashing into the wall. The man crumpled to the floor, groaning.

"The money," Alexander said, his voice like winter, "goes only to the woman who actually raised my sister. Not you."

Evelyn's breath caught. She hadn’t expected Alexander to be so… ruthless.

He turned to her, his expression softening. "You and Aunt Margaret go ahead to dinner. I'll handle this."

"But—"

"Trust me," he murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her face. "You're not alone anymore."

Evelyn's heart clenched. This—this was what it felt like to have someone fight for her.
###Chapter 11

Evelyn didn’t speak. She simply took Margaret’s hand and walked away.

Alexander watched them go, his expression shifting from warmth to ice in an instant. It had been years since he’d personally handled such matters, but this time, he couldn’t stand aside.

How dare Walter and Beverly mistreat Evelyn? They had a death wish.

His bodyguards formed a tight circle, shielding the scene from curious onlookers.

Alexander’s gaze was sharp, a dangerous glint in his eyes. "You locked her in a cellar and starved her?"

"W-We didn’t have space at home! The cellar was warm!" Walter stammered.

"Exactly! We were struggling back then—barely had food for ourselves!" Beverly added hastily.

Alexander wasn’t fooled. Without hesitation, he struck.

Within moments, Walter and Beverly could no longer speak. Blood dripped from their split lips, teeth missing. Regret flooded their faces—this man wasn’t just some wealthy playboy. He was ruthless.

Flexing his knuckles, Alexander ordered coldly, "Get them out of here. I don’t want Evelyn to see them."

What if the sight of their battered faces frightened his gentle sister? He had to maintain his kind, protective image.

Turning back toward the restaurant, his demeanor softened instantly when he spotted Evelyn. "Order anything you want."

Evelyn glanced toward the lobby. "Where are they?"

"I had a… productive conversation with them. They left, likely out of shame," Alexander replied smoothly.

A flicker of doubt crossed Evelyn’s face. Since when were Walter and Beverly so easily persuaded?

Alexander discreetly wiped a smear of blood from his fingers with a napkin. "If they ever bother you again, call me."

Evelyn hesitated, then flipped through the menu. Her eyes widened at the prices. "Are you rich?"

Caught off guard, Alexander recalled his wife’s advice. Time to play the humble card.

"Not at all," he said firmly.

"But you offered them a hundred million?"

"Just a joke."

"This place is expensive, though."

"I used to work here. Employee discount."

Margaret raised a brow. "And the helicopter? The bodyguards?"

"Rented the chopper. Hired the men for the day."

He pulled out a wad of cash and handed it to the nearest bodyguard. "Your payment."

The man hesitated, confused.

Alexander gave him a look. Take it.

The bodyguard pocketed the money and hurried off.

Evelyn blinked. "So… all that was just for show?"

Alexander grinned. "First impressions matter."

Seeing her relax, he knew he’d made the right choice. From now on, he was poor.

Margaret leaned in. "What do you do for a living?"

Alexander paused. He couldn’t say real estate tycoon, but lying outright felt wrong. "My company sells properties."

Technically true—he just omitted that he owned the company.

Margaret nodded. "Ah, a real estate agent. Honestly, Evelyn doesn’t care about status. You didn’t need this charade."

Evelyn agreed. "Money doesn’t matter to me."

Rich families came with too much drama. She preferred simplicity.

Alexander smiled. "Then I won’t do it again."

Evelyn tilted her head. "What about my other brothers? What do they do?"
###Chapter 12

"Your second brother, Sebastian Montgomery, is an exceptional software engineer. His cybersecurity firm has won multiple industry awards for developing cutting-edge protection systems," Alexander explained.

Content exclusively published on NovelDrama.org.

"Your third brother, Julian Montgomery, works with international wildlife conservation groups. He rehabilitates injured animals and educates communities about coexisting with nature."

"Your eldest cousin, Christopher Montgomery, teaches music at a prestigious academy. Your second cousin, Andrew Montgomery, practices corporate law. And your youngest cousin, Daniel Montgomery, is building his acting career through theater productions."

Alexander felt pleased with his carefully worded explanations. Technically, he hadn't lied to Evelyn.

Sebastian was indeed a brilliant programmer - just happened to be one of the most sought-after white-hat hackers globally.

Julian wasn't just any veterinarian - he was a world-renowned trauma surgeon who volunteered his skills to animal sanctuaries.

Christopher gave piano lessons between sold-out concert tours at the Royal Albert Hall.

Andrew did work at a law firm - the one bearing his name as senior partner.

And Daniel's "small theater roles" were actually leading parts in Oscar-nominated films.

Evelyn nodded thoughtfully. Alexander sold properties, Sebastian coded, Julian helped animals. Christopher taught music, Andrew practiced law, and Daniel acted.

So much for her fleeting fantasy about secret wealth. Still, she felt warmth spreading through her chest at suddenly having this large, diverse family.

Margaret looked slightly disappointed by their apparent middle-class status. "We should return home after dinner. This luxury hotel must be terribly expensive. Evelyn, real estate can't be the most stable profession these days."

She decided their financial status didn't matter as long as they treated Evelyn well.

"Actually, money isn't an issue. I've had several very successful property deals recently," Alexander quickly interjected.

Evelyn squeezed Margaret's hand. "Top realtors earn excellent commissions. Since the rooms are already booked, let's enjoy one night of pampering."

After some hesitation, Margaret finally agreed.

Alexander discreetly exhaled in relief. His wife always knew how to handle delicate situations!

Following dinner, they retired to the penthouse suite. Evelyn intended to chat longer with Margaret but fell asleep almost immediately, enjoying the most restful night she'd had in years.

Her alarm startled her awake at dawn.

For three years, she'd risen at 6:30 AM daily to prepare Nathaniel's breakfast without fail.

She silenced the alarm with determination. No more sacrificing her mornings for a man who didn't appreciate her.

Moments later, her phone vibrated with a call from the one person she never expected - Nathaniel Whitmore.

In their entire marriage, he'd never once called her directly. The old Evelyn would have been overjoyed. The new Evelyn let it ring out.

When the ringing stopped, sleep eluded her. This small act of defiance left her with complicated emotions.

Another call came through - this time from the Whitmore residence. She answered reluctantly. "Yes?"

"Mrs. Whitmore, we can't locate Mr. Whitmore's navy pinstripe suit. Where might it be?"

Though she wanted to refuse, she couldn't bear the staff suffering Nathaniel's temper. "Check the far right of his walk-in closet."

Nathaniel's icy voice suddenly came on the line. "Get back here and find it yourself, Evelyn. I don't allow staff in my private quarters."

His entitled tone made her blood boil. "We're getting divorced, Mr. Whitmore. Let Victoria fetch your clothes for once."
###Chapter 13

"You're the one who usually handles these things. How is Victoria supposed to find it?"

Evelyn scoffed. Nathaniel was just too concerned about Victoria, his first love, to let her serve someone else. Was that why he wanted her to go back and wait on both of them?

She had no interest in returning to that house and seeing Victoria lounging in her bed.

"If you can't find it, then wear something else!" Evelyn snapped before ending the call.

Her pulse raced faster than usual. She never imagined she’d be the one to hang up on Nathaniel Whitmore.

And it felt amazing.

After the call disconnected, the maid hesitated before asking, "Would you like a different tie, Mr. Whitmore?"

Nathaniel strode to the walk-in closet. Sure enough, the tie was in the second drawer—even though he’d already searched there earlier. How had he missed it?

Last night, his men had followed the helicopter for a while before losing track. Nathaniel had no idea where Evelyn had been taken.

The lack of control gnawed at him.

Once dressed, he headed to the dining room. An elaborate breakfast spread awaited him. He took one bite and immediately set his fork down. "This is terrible."

The butler, Gregory, swallowed nervously. "Before leaving, Ms. Sinclair specifically instructed us to prepare this for you, Mr. Whitmore. She said these were your favorites."

Gregory had his doubts. For the past three years, Nathaniel had eaten Evelyn’s simple, home-cooked meals.

Besides, he’d assumed Victoria would move in as the future Mrs. Whitmore, but Nathaniel had sent her home last night.

Nathaniel pushed his plate away. "I don’t like this."

His gaze flicked to the empty seat beside him. He used to be annoyed by Evelyn’s presence—now, he couldn’t stand her absence.

What the hell was wrong with him?

Evelyn rubbed her growling stomach. She’d just freshened up after waking, careful not to disturb Margaret, who was still asleep.

Alexander was in the next room, but she wasn’t sure if he was awake yet.

She slipped out and found a cozy diner nearby. In high spirits, she snapped a photo of her breakfast and posted it on Twitter with the caption: "New day, new me. No looking back."

Within minutes, Eleanor liked the post and called. "Evelyn, darling, come for dinner tonight. It’s been too long."

Evelyn hesitated. Sooner or later, she’d have to tell Eleanor about the divorce. "Alright," she agreed.

After breakfast, she grabbed takeout and headed back to the hotel.

Just then, a young man stepped out of the elevator, spotted her, and snapped a photo of her retreating figure. He sent it straight to Nathaniel with the message: "Mr. Whitmore, did you and your wife stay here last night?"

Nathaniel was already in a foul mood—hungry and irritable. When his phone buzzed, he checked it and froze.

Evelyn was at a hotel?

Was that her new boyfriend picking her up yesterday? Had they gone straight to a room?

Had she been seeing someone else before the divorce?

His jaw clenched. The thought of Evelyn with another man last night made his blood boil.

He pulled up her Twitter. "New day, new me. No looking back."

Nathaniel smirked bitterly. So she had moved on.

He turned to his assistant, Robert. "Cut off the hospital payments."

Robert blinked. "Sir, are you stopping Mrs. Whitmore’s uncle’s medical funds to force her back?"
###Chapter 14

Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he snapped, "You're overstepping your boundaries as an assistant."

Robert fell silent, though confusion still clouded his thoughts.

He remembered the divorce papers Nathaniel had instructed him to draft. The agreement explicitly stated that Nathaniel would continue covering Benjamin's medical expenses.

So why the sudden change of heart?

Men were impossible to decipher.

"Just follow my orders," Nathaniel commanded, his voice icy.

He must have been too lenient with Evelyn all this time. That was the only explanation for her audacity to betray him.

Evelyn, who had just stepped back into the hotel, sneezed sharply. She rubbed her nose, wondering if someone was bad-mouthing her.

When she returned to the room with a simple breakfast in hand, she found Alexander already there—along with an extravagant spread of gourmet dishes covering the entire table.

Evelyn glanced between the modest bagels she’d bought and the lavish feast before her.

Heat crept up her neck as she cleared her throat. "I couldn’t sleep, so I went out early. Thought I’d grab something for you too since hotel food is ridiculously overpriced."

"Don’t worry, this is complimentary. I know the manager," Alexander lied smoothly.

He’d been so focused on ordering the finest breakfast that he nearly forgot the humble persona he was supposed to maintain in front of her.

Evelyn didn’t question it. Setting down the bagels, she turned to fetch Margaret.

The moment she left, Alexander snatched up the bagels and snapped a quick photo, sending it to the family group chat titled "Montgomery Madhouse."

Alexander: Evelyn bought me breakfast. Today is officially perfect.

Sebastian: Disgusting. How dare you let her spend money on you?

Julian: Agreed. You’re shameless… Unless she brings me something too.

Olivia, Alexander’s wife, chimed in. "Our flight lands in an hour. Your three cousins are on the same plane. Don’t let them steal Evelyn’s attention."

Alexander hesitated, then typed out a warning. If Christopher, Andrew, and Daniel accidentally revealed the truth, everything would unravel.

After Evelyn went missing years ago, the cousins had drifted apart. Now that she was back, Alexander hoped they could mend things.

Soon, Evelyn returned with Margaret in tow.

Margaret’s eyes widened at the lavish spread. "This must’ve cost a fortune!"

Evelyn waved a hand. "It’s all free. Fancy hotels do this to make up for their insane prices."

Margaret accepted the explanation without question.

Then Alexander’s phone buzzed—Victoria Sinclair flashed across the screen.

His stomach dropped. He quickly declined the call.

After losing Evelyn, the family had scoured the country for her. The last lead pointed to an orphanage, where they found only one unclaimed girl—Victoria.

To comfort their grieving grandmother, they brought her home, pretending she was Evelyn’s replacement.

The lie had driven a wedge between Alexander and his cousins.

Now that Evelyn was back, guilt gnawed at him. He hadn’t told Victoria yet—she already kept him at arm’s length. If she found out, she’d never forgive him.

His phone rang again. Evelyn frowned. "Someone’s persistent."

"Wrong number," Alexander muttered, resisting the urge to toss his phone off the balcony.

"But they keep calling," Evelyn pointed out. "Must be important."

Trapped, Alexander stepped outside. Once he was sure Evelyn couldn’t hear, he answered stiffly.

"What?"

"Alexander! You’re in Bern City and didn’t tell me?" Victoria’s voice was bright with excitement.

"Just business," he deflected.

"Perfect! I need a favor. My friend’s grandmother needs surgery. Julian’s the only surgeon with a 100% success rate, but he refuses to do it."
###Chapter 15

Alexander's expression darkened instantly. "You're talking about Nathaniel Whitmore's grandmother, aren't you? He's already married. Why are you still clinging to him?"

"Nat's getting a divorce, Alexander. He never loved that woman anyway. After three years, he must realize who truly belongs with him."

Victoria pressed on anxiously, "Alexander, the surgery is nothing for Julian! Please convince him for me? He listens to you."

She could use this operation as leverage to secure her marriage to Nathaniel.

"I won't do it," Alexander replied flatly before hanging up.

Even though Victoria was adopted, Alexander refused to let her marry Nathaniel—a ruthless, cold-hearted man who had already been married once.

He checked the newly formed One Big Happy Family group chat. For now, the family had agreed to keep their discovery of Evelyn a secret from Victoria. At the very least, they needed to win Evelyn over first.

Alexander returned to the hotel suite's living room. "Everyone will arrive by tonight, Evelyn. Let's have dinner together."

"Tonight?"

Remembering her promise to dine with Eleanor, Evelyn hesitated. "I already made plans with a friend."

"That's fine," Alexander reassured her. "We're in no rush. After all these years, waiting a little longer won't hurt."

Seeing how careful he was with her, Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I'll come back early tonight."

Alexander gently brushed a strand of Evelyn's hair behind her ear. "You're going out for dinner with a friend, right? Do you have enough money?"

Evelyn stiffened, unused to such affection. Her reply came out slightly rigid. "I have enough."

She retreated to the bedroom to change. Margaret followed, murmuring, "You're going to the Whitmores', aren't you?"

"You guessed it, Aunt Margaret. Eleanor has always been kind to me. I need to explain things to her."

"Evelyn, I didn’t tell your brother about your marriage and divorce, but I’m worried about you going there."

"Let’s keep my past with Nathaniel a secret. I don’t want Alexander storming over to confront him."

Margaret didn’t push further, though her eyes reddened. "You don’t have to endure such humiliation anymore. We don’t care about those wealthy families."

Evelyn nodded. After changing, she studied her reflection in the mirror, her hand resting lightly on her stomach.

She would begin anew—with her child.

When Evelyn left, Alexander followed her to the lobby. "Where are you going? I’ll drive you."

"It’s fine," she declined. "I’ll take the bus."

Alexander couldn’t bear the thought of his sister crammed into public transport. He had an entire fleet of luxury cars ready for her—but as a mere "real estate agent," he had to restrain himself.

Spotting a taxi, he quickly hailed it and paid upfront. "Take this. The bus will be too crowded. I can afford this much."

He couldn’t stand the idea of Evelyn squeezed between strangers. After years apart, he wanted to make up for lost time.

Unable to refuse, Evelyn finally climbed into the cab, offering Alexander a small wave.

A faint smile touched her lips. It felt… nice, having a family again.

The taxi pulled up to the Whitmore estate. Staring at the familiar mansion, Evelyn hesitated, unsure how to break the news of her divorce to Eleanor.

Taking a deep breath, she stepped inside.

A young woman emerged from the garden. "A taxi this time, Evelyn? No more pretending to be the thrifty, dutiful wife?"

Her lips curled mockingly. "Finally spending the Whitmore fortune on yourself?"
###Chapter 16

The young woman standing before Evelyn was Penelope Whitmore, Nathaniel's cousin.

Evelyn simply disregarded Penelope's snide remarks. For years, Penelope had looked down on Evelyn with undisguised contempt.

Her constant insinuations suggested Evelyn only married the critically ill Nathaniel for his family's wealth.

In the past, Evelyn had endured Penelope's mockery silently. But now that the divorce papers were signed,

she no longer needed to tolerate such behavior.

Penelope strutted over with exaggerated arrogance, snapping, "Why are you just standing there? Go to the kitchen immediately and prepare my favorite lobster bisque."

Evelyn averted her gaze, responding coolly, "Eleanor invited me as a dinner guest, not as household staff."

"How dare you speak to me like that, Evelyn? I'll tell Aunt Beatrice about this insolence!"

Ignoring Penelope's outburst, Evelyn entered the living room where two unexpected figures sat waiting.

One was her former mother-in-law Beatrice, the other Nathaniel's childhood sweetheart Victoria Sinclair.

She hadn't anticipated Victoria's presence at tonight's gathering.

Penelope barged in, deliberately bumping into Evelyn before announcing loudly, "Aunt Beatrice! Evelyn refused to cook for us! She claims Grandmother invited her as a guest!"

Beatrice's expression darkened immediately. "Evelyn, as my daughter-in-law, how could you refuse such a simple request? What value do you bring to this family?"

"You should consider it an honor we allow you to cook for us," she added with a sneer.

"Please don't upset yourself, Mrs. Whitmore," Victoria interjected smoothly. "Your health is more important."

Beatrice sighed dramatically. "Victoria, you're everything Evelyn isn't - cultured, educated abroad, from good stock. You'd make the perfect daughter-in-law."

Victoria's eyes gleamed with satisfaction as she murmured, "We must make allowances for her... circumstances."

"Circumstances? She's an orphan who overstepped her station!" Beatrice scoffed. "My son deserves better than some social climber."

Evelyn absorbed their words calmly. These were familiar refrains from the past three years.

But she wasn't that helpless orphan anymore. She had six extraordinarily successful brothers now.

Meeting Beatrice's gaze directly, Evelyn remarked, "Interesting. Are you suggesting Nathaniel needs a wealthy wife to succeed?"

"How dare you! My son is brilliant - he doesn't need any woman's help!" Beatrice spluttered.

"Then why emphasize marrying someone of equal status?" Evelyn countered smoothly.

Beatrice gaped, momentarily speechless. Since when had Evelyn developed such sharp wit?

Turning to a nearby maid, Evelyn inquired, "Where's Eleanor?"

The maid started slightly before answering, "Mrs. Whitmore Senior is resting in her chambers. She hasn't woken yet."

Evelyn frowned. "Has she been unwell recently?"

Penelope interjected smugly, "Look at Victoria's gifts - imported supplements and that diamond bracelet. What did you bring? Nothing, as usual."

Victoria pretended modesty. "They're just simple tokens, really."

"Simple for people like us," Penelope sneered. "But beyond Evelyn's means, which explains why she trapped Nathaniel."

Beatrice nodded approvingly. Evelyn's humble origins had made her the laughingstock of their social circle for years.

Evelyn chuckled dryly. "Eleanor values sincerity over material displays. She's never cared for such superficiality."

To the maid she said, "I'll prepare Eleanor's favorite herbal soup."

"The mistress hasn't had much appetite lately, but she always enjoys your cooking," the maid admitted.

Evelyn retreated to the kitchen, relieved to escape the toxic atmosphere. Of all the Whitmores, only Eleanor had shown her genuine kindness.

Alone with her thoughts, Evelyn prepared the restorative broth with meticulous care. She still needed to break the news of her divorce to the only family member who'd ever treated her with respect.
###Chapter 17

The kitchen door swung open as Victoria Sinclair made her grand entrance. She sauntered up to Evelyn Carter with a calculated smile. "Evelyn, darling, do you really think some homemade soup will make Eleanor Whitmore suddenly support you?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the ladle.

Victoria leaned in, her perfume overpowering. "Let me share some exciting news. I've secured the services of Dr. Julian Montgomery - yes, that world-renowned cardiovascular surgeon - to operate on dear Eleanor. Once he saves her life, do you really think she'll object to Nathaniel marrying me?"

Though Alexander and Sebastian hadn't officially agreed yet, Victoria knew she could persuade Julian. Saving that old woman's life would remove the last obstacle between her and Nathaniel.

Evelyn knew about Eleanor's chronic heart condition. The family had searched for years for a suitable surgeon.

At least Eleanor would get proper treatment now, Evelyn thought bitterly.

She stood abruptly, the stool scraping against the tiles. "Congratulations in advance. May you and Nathaniel fill Whitmore Manor with children - though half of them will probably have different mothers. Now if you'll excuse me."

Victoria's eyes darkened like storm clouds. How dare this nobody speak to her like that?

In one swift motion, Victoria shoved the simmering pot off the stove, sending it crashing toward Evelyn.

"Look out!"

A figure burst into the kitchen. Evelyn turned to see Nathaniel - but he rushed past her to shield Victoria.

Boiling liquid splashed across Evelyn's hands. The physical pain was nothing compared to the searing ache in her chest.

She rushed to the sink, running cold water over her burns as Victoria's saccharine voice filled the air. "Nathaniel, my hand! It burns! But please don't blame Evelyn. I'm sure it was an accident."

Evelyn scoffed without turning around. What was the point in defending herself now?

Nathaniel suddenly grabbed her arm. "Evelyn! I never thought you'd stoop so low as to-"

His words died when he saw her blistered skin.

Evelyn met his gaze defiantly. "Stoop to what, Nathaniel?"

"Evelyn Carter! How dare you attack Ms. Sinclair!" Beatrice Harrington stormed in, taking in the scene. Without waiting for explanation, she raised her hand to strike Evelyn.

Evelyn braced herself - but the blow never came.

Nathaniel's arm blocked his mother. Evelyn stared in shock. Since when did he protect her?

The entire kitchen seemed to hold its breath.

Beatrice looked scandalized. "Nathaniel! Don't interfere when I'm disciplining her!"

Nathaniel's voice turned glacial. "It was clearly an accident."

"An accident?" Beatrice scoffed.

Victoria clenched her jaw. Why was Nathaniel defending Evelyn?

She quickly put on a pitiful expression. "Mrs. Whitmore, it truly was an accident. Evelyn got hurt too."

Evelyn turned off the faucet with deliberate calm. "No. It wasn't an accident. Victoria pushed that pot intentionally."

The tension crackled like electricity.

Evelyn held Nathaniel's gaze unflinchingly. The divorce papers were signed. She had nothing left to lose.

She pointed to the security camera in the corner. "Check the footage. Under state law, assault causing bodily harm carries a three-year sentence. These burns require medical attention. I have every right to press charges."

Victoria paled. She hadn't noticed the camera.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "We'll review the footage immediately."

Victoria grabbed Beatrice's arm. "Mrs. Whitmore, I only wanted to help serve the soup! I'm so clumsy - we both got burned because of me!"

Beatrice patted her hand. "Of course it was an accident, dear. A refined young lady like you wouldn't know your way around a kitchen. Unlike some people who probably staged this whole thing." She shot Evelyn a venomous look. "Let's get you to the doctor immediately. We can't have you scarring."

As Victoria moved to leave, she cast a pleading look at Nathaniel.

His gaze lingered on Evelyn's injured hands before he ordered, "Everyone to the living room. Summon Dr. Reynolds immediately."

"Yes, Nathaniel," Beatrice agreed. "Ms. Sinclair's care is our top priority."

Evelyn's lips twisted in a bitter smile. Of course Victoria mattered more.

As they filed out, Evelyn called after Nathaniel, "Don't forget to check that footage. I want my name cleared."

This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.
###Chapter 18

Dr. Samuel Reynolds, the Whitmore family physician, arrived in haste.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened as he examined the angry blisters marring Evelyn's delicate hand. "Must I repeat myself?" he snapped. "Sit down this instant!"

Evelyn moved toward the sofa, but Beatrice roughly pushed her aside. "Stop obstructing the doctor! Samuel, examine Victoria's injury immediately. We can't risk any scarring on her perfect skin."

Victoria lounged on the couch, smirking triumphantly at Evelyn.

Evelyn remained frozen in place, her expression carefully blank. Nathaniel glanced at her briefly before looking away.

Samuel set down his medical kit and inspected Victoria's wrist. Finding only slight redness without broken skin, he frowned. "This requires no medical attention."

"How dare you say that?" Beatrice shrilled. "What if complications arise from delayed treatment? Would you take responsibility for ruining her flawless skin?"

Adjusting his glasses, Samuel countered, "The redness will fade within thirty minutes. Ms. Carter's burns, however, require immediate care to prevent permanent scarring."

An uncomfortable silence descended upon the room.

Victoria forced a gracious smile. "Let him treat her first, Mrs. Whitmore. I can wait."

"Absolutely not!" Beatrice exclaimed. "She's just some charity case! What does it matter if she scars?"

"Unlike you, darling," Beatrice continued, patting Victoria's hand, "whose brothers would storm this house if they thought we neglected you."

Victoria's smile turned saccharine. "I'd never tell them, Mrs. Whitmore."

Beatrice rounded on Evelyn. "You heard that? Ms. Sinclair is being merciful! Thank her properly!"

Evelyn's voice remained ice-cold. "I didn't touch her. She deliberately scalded me. The apology should come from her."

"How dare you lie!" Beatrice shrieked. "Everyone knows girls like you envy proper ladies like Victoria! I've witnessed this petty jealousy countless times! Apologize now!"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed at his mother's venomous words. "Mother, I told you it was clearly an accident. We haven't reviewed the security footage yet."

For the first time, he truly saw how cruelly his mother treated Evelyn.

Why are you defending her, Nathaniel? The divorce is practically finalized! And why invite her tonight? She'll only ruin our family dinner!

"Who's getting divorced?" Eleanor Whitmore's sharp voice cut through the tension.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing Eleanor in her wheelchair. Her piercing gaze swept the room. "Well? Who's divorcing?"

Nathaniel quickly replied, "No one, Grandmother. You must have misheard."

"Is that so?" Eleanor's eyes narrowed. "Perhaps my old ears deceive me. Evelyn, come here. Let me look at you properly. You've lost weight."

Evelyn approached, taking Eleanor's frail hands in hers. "I haven't, Grandmother. If anything, I've gained some."

"Don't lie to me," Eleanor chided. "My eyes remain sharp even if my hearing fades. If Nathaniel mistreats you, you must tell me. I'll set him straight."

Noticing Evelyn's injured hand, Eleanor gasped. "Good heavens! What happened? Samuel, attend to this immediately! This must be excruciating!"

A bittersweet warmth flooded Evelyn's chest. Among all the Whitmores, only Eleanor and Margaret had ever shown her genuine kindness. For that, she would always be grateful.
###Chapter 19

Evelyn perched on the edge of the sofa, wincing as Samuel carefully wrapped the bandage around her palm. "Keep this dry for at least three days," he instructed sternly. "No water contact until the wound seals properly."

Eleanor's sharp gaze pinned Evelyn in place. "Now darling, tell me exactly how this happened."

Evelyn's eyes flickered toward Victoria, who suddenly found the ceiling fascinating.

Beatrice erupted before Evelyn could speak. "That accusatory look! Are you implying Victoria did this? After she tried helping you? Look at her own injuries!"

"Silence!" Eleanor's voice cracked like a whip. "Did I ask for your opinion?"

Beatrice's mouth snapped shut, though her face twisted in resentment. Her mother-in-law had always favored this nobody over her own flesh and blood.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Just a kitchen accident, Grandma. My attention slipped while stirring soup."

Nathaniel studied her with narrowed eyes. Why wasn't she seizing this opportunity with Eleanor present? The old woman would tear the house down for her.

"You stubborn child," Eleanor chided, patting Evelyn's knee. "We have chefs for this. Must you always insist on cooking yourself?"

Evelyn kept her gaze lowered, swallowing the truth. Though Eleanor's protection warmed her, she couldn't burden the frail woman with this petty drama.

Victoria chose that moment to slither forward. "Mrs. Whitmore, I brought those organic supplements you liked. Doctor-approved for your condition."

Eleanor's smile chilled. "Ms. Sinclair, didn't I request you stop these visits? Tonight's a family affair—we wouldn't want to impose on your time."

Victoria's manicured fingers twitched. The audacity! Her family name opened every door in the city, yet this decrepit woman dismissed her like a servant?

The storm in Victoria's eyes cleared instantly. "Of course. Perhaps when Julian's schedule frees up, we can discuss your surgery again. Nathaniel worries so."

"My health is none of your concern," Eleanor snapped. Rising with Evelyn's support, she announced, "Dinner awaits."

Evelyn's heart clenched. Eleanor was rejecting vital treatment to shield her. "Grandma, I left my phone in the kitchen."

She needed air, space to think.

The kitchen's fluorescent lights hummed as Evelyn entered. Then Victoria's saccharine voice dripped behind her. "Looking for evidence, are we?"

Penelope smirked beside her. "Too late. I wiped the security feed and disabled the cameras. No witnesses."

Evelyn turned slowly, a predator's smile curling her lips. "Perfect."

Victoria scoffed. "Without proof, who'd believe your—"

The metal spatula connected with Victoria's shoulder before she finished. Penelope shrieked as the next blow landed on her forearm.

Evelyn blocked the doorway, her weapon flashing. "Since there's no cameras..." Whack. "...no evidence..." Crack. "...who'd believe you?"

When their wails reached a crescendo, Evelyn smoothed her hair. "Funny how that works, isn't it?"
###Chapter 20

Evelyn and Penelope were in similar states of dishevelment. Their hair was tangled, their clothes wrinkled, and faint marks from the spatula Evelyn had wielded still lingered on their skin.

"Mrs. Whitmore will defend me!" Victoria shrieked, her voice shrill with desperation.

"But you're standing in the Whitmore residence right now," Evelyn countered coolly. "And Grandmother Eleanor is the one who holds all the power here. Who do you think she'll believe—you two, or me?"

She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Consider this your only warning. Cross me again, and next time, the consequences won't be so light."

Penelope swallowed hard, her face pale with defeat. She knew Evelyn was right. Eleanor would side with her without hesitation—that cunning little—

Without another word, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode out of the kitchen.

Victoria and Penelope collapsed onto the floor, their pride wounded, their fury simmering beneath the surface. They had been humiliated and left with no way to retaliate.

Clenching her fists, Victoria hissed through gritted teeth, "This isn't over. Just you wait."

Unbeknownst to them, Nathaniel had been standing just outside the kitchen, observing the entire confrontation. His brow arched slightly as he watched Evelyn walk away, unhurried and unbothered.

He hadn't expected her to emerge victorious—especially not while injured and outnumbered.

His assistant, Robert, stepped forward hesitantly. "Mr. Whitmore, this confirms that Ms. Sinclair was indeed the one who framed Ms. Evelyn. Should we intervene? What if she seeks revenge?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "Don't waste your time. As long as Victoria has even a shred of self-preservation, she won’t dare push this further."

With that, he turned and left.

By the time Evelyn returned to the living room, she had smoothed her expression into perfect neutrality, as if nothing had happened.

The women moved to the dining room, taking their seats—but Nathaniel was conspicuously absent.

Eleanor frowned and gestured to one of the household staff. "Victoria, go fetch that stubborn grandson of mine. It's dinnertime—where has he disappeared to now?"

Evelyn ladled a bowl of soup for Eleanor, her voice soft. "Here, Grandmother. I'm sorry the soup I made earlier was ruined."

She didn’t particularly care whether Nathaniel showed up or not. In fact, she wouldn’t be surprised if he was off somewhere comforting that insufferable Victoria.

Eleanor waved a dismissive hand. "The soup doesn’t matter. What matters is your hand. What if it scars?"

The genuine concern in Eleanor’s voice made Evelyn’s chest tighten with guilt. She set down her spoon and hesitated before speaking. "Grandmother, there's something I need to discuss with you."

Eleanor looked up. "What is it?"

Before Evelyn could answer, Nathaniel’s voice cut in. "It's about the surgery."

He slid into the seat beside her, his arm brushing against hers as he settled in. His expression was unreadable.

Evelyn stiffened. Had he interrupted her on purpose?

Eleanor scoffed. "I'm perfectly fine. I don’t need any surgery. I know exactly what Victoria is after—tell her to stop dreaming."

As she spoke, she shot Beatrice a pointed glare.

Nathaniel’s brows furrowed. "Those are two separate issues. Don’t conflate them."

"To me, they’re one and the same."

Beatrice chose that moment to interject. "Don’t tell me someone’s been whispering in your ear. Why refuse the surgery? We’re talking about the top cardiovascular surgeon in the country—his success rate is impeccable."

She paused, then added pointedly, "He’s Ms. Sinclair’s brother, and if not for her connections, we wouldn’t even have access to him."

Evelyn’s appetite vanished.

She had never imagined Eleanor would refuse the surgery—for her sake. What had she ever done to deserve such loyalty?

And yet, she had already failed her.

The signed divorce papers weighed heavily in her mind.
###Chapter 21

Nathaniel cut Evelyn off with a sharp, "Let's focus on dinner for now."

Eleanor smiled warmly at Evelyn and gestured to the table. "I had the kitchen prepare your favorite—lobster bisque." She turned to Nathaniel. "Serve your wife, dear."

Evelyn's fingers twitched. She wanted to reach for the ladle herself, but Nathaniel was faster. He took her bowl and filled it without a word.

Staring at the creamy soup, her stomach twisted.

"Is there a problem?" Beatrice scoffed. "My son went out of his way to serve you. Are you ungrateful?"

Eleanor studied Evelyn with concern. "Do you not like it anymore, dear?"

"That's not it," Evelyn said quickly. "I do."

As she lifted a spoonful, she felt Nathaniel's gaze burning into her. The moment the rich scent hit her nose, her face paled.

She forced down one mouthful but couldn't stomach a second.

A few seconds later, Evelyn dropped her spoon and clutched her stomach, fighting the urge to retch.

It made no sense. She'd always loved lobster bisque—why was it revolting now?

Eleanor gasped, eyes lighting up. "Evelyn… could you be pregnant?"

Silence. Then two pairs of shocked eyes locked onto her.

Evelyn's breath hitched. Panic flared. How had Eleanor guessed?

The nausea surged harder. She barely made it to the bathroom before heaving violently, her stomach emptying itself until only bile remained.

A hand offered her a tissue. She took it without looking.

"Thank—"

Her words died when she turned and saw Nathaniel.

She looked away, voice tight. "It's just a stomach bug. Stress, probably."

His deep voice cut through the air. "If you're sick, Dr. Reynolds should examine you."

Her pulse spiked. "No need. It's minor. I'll be fine."

"Is that so?"

Nathaniel stepped closer, trapping her against the sink. She couldn't escape.

Her gaze dropped to his navy tie—the one she'd picked out earlier. He'd worn it after all.

"Look at me, Evelyn."

When she hesitated, he gripped her chin, forcing her eyes up. His dark stare was relentless.

"What aren't you telling me?"

Her throat tightened. "What exactly are you asking, Mr. Whitmore?"

Mr. Whitmore?

She used to say his name so softly, so carefully. Now, after finding someone else, she'd grown bold.

Nathaniel leaned in, fury simmering. "You know damn well what I'm asking."

Evelyn clenched her fists, steadying herself. "I'm not pregnant. If you don't believe me—"

"Why wouldn't I?"

Her breath caught. For a fleeting second, she thought—he trusts me?

But his next words shattered that illusion.

"You were in a hotel with another man last night. If you were pregnant, do you really think a child would survive that kind of recklessness?"

Her face drained of color. Of course. He didn’t trust her—he was mocking her.

She lowered her lashes, hiding the sting.

Nathaniel wasn’t done. "Answer me. Who were you with?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly. As long as he didn’t suspect the truth, his accusations didn’t matter.

"We're getting a divorce," she said flatly. "Who I spend my time with isn’t your concern."

Nathaniel yanked at his tie, frustration boiling over. "Which part of you is even real, Evelyn? You claimed you married me because you loved me. Was that a lie too?"
###Chapter 22

"I did say I loved you, Nathaniel, but forever was never promised."

"Evelyn Carter! Are you even listening to yourself?"

Nathaniel's fingers tightened around Evelyn's chin as he searched her eyes desperately. For the first time in three years, he realized how little he truly knew the woman he'd married.

She had always been there - anticipating his needs before he voiced them, reading his moods like an open book. Her adoring gaze had been his constant companion.

Now that gaze was gone.

The thought of Evelyn directing that same devotion toward another man made Nathaniel's blood boil. He wanted to find whoever she'd been with at that hotel and break every bone in his body.

Evelyn didn't flinch. Their faces remained inches apart, breaths mingling in the charged space between them.

"Good heavens! What's going on here? Evelyn's expecting, you foolish boy. Keep your hands to yourself!"

Eleanor's voice shattered the moment. She'd grown impatient waiting and come to investigate, only to find them in this compromising position.

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson.

Nathaniel turned slightly. "She's not pregnant, Grandmother."

"And how would you know, you imbecile?"

"Her cycle just ended."

Evelyn's eyes widened. Had Nathaniel been tracking her periods all this time?

True, she'd been late this month - the irregularity prompting her hospital visit. The doctor had confirmed her pregnancy, though it was still early days.

Eleanor's face fell. "No baby?"

Beatrice seized the opportunity with a venomous smile. "Three years of marriage and still no child? Clearly something's wrong with her."

"You might be right," Eleanor mused.

Beatrice pressed on eagerly. "They need full medical examinations. Probably infertility issues."

She relished the thought - if Evelyn proved defective, Nathaniel could discard her like yesterday's trash.

"Absolutely. Hospital tomorrow, boy. Let's see what's wrong with you." Eleanor's next words shocked everyone. "Three years and no pregnancy? Are you even performing your husbandly duties?"

Evelyn gaped. Beatrice looked apoplectic.

"Mother! How dare you suggest such a thing about my son? He's the picture of health! The problem clearly lies elsewhere."

Nathaniel pinched the bridge of his nose. "Enough, Mother."

This conversation was spiraling into mortifying territory.

Beatrice wouldn't relent. "Well, Evelyn? Who's failing here? Is my son incapable of doing what a man should?"

Evelyn's mouth went dry. How could she possibly answer?

Confess that they'd slept in separate bedrooms for three years? That their marriage had been one of convenience until that drunken night a month ago?

That single encounter had been shrouded in darkness - Evelyn too nervous and inexperienced to process what was happening. She'd never even seen her husband fully unclothed.

How could she possibly judge his... capabilities?
###Chapter 23

"Evelyn, why are you avoiding the question? Speak up."

Eleanor Whitmore's piercing gaze made Evelyn shift uncomfortably. She glanced at Nathaniel before mumbling, "W-What exactly do you want me to say? You should ask Nathaniel about this."

Why were they putting her on the spot like this?

Except for that one drunken night, Nathaniel had never touched her. How could she possibly be pregnant?

Nathaniel cleared his throat smoothly. "Mother, must we discuss such private matters? We've been careful with protection. That's why there's no pregnancy. I'm not ready for children yet."

When Evelyn heard his last words, her hand instinctively moved to her abdomen. She needed to protect this baby at all costs.

Eleanor wrung her hands anxiously. "You're thirty years old! When will you be ready? I might die before seeing my great-grandchild!"

"Grandmother," Nathaniel said firmly, "if you agree to the surgery, you'll live long enough to hold your great-grandchild."

"Don't try to manipulate me!" Eleanor scoffed. "I'll consider the surgery when Evelyn's pregnant. Not a moment sooner!" With that, she turned and marched out.

Victoria Hawthorne followed discreetly, murmuring, "Mrs. Whitmore and Mr. Nathaniel have such a loving relationship. A child will surely come soon."

Once Eleanor left, Beatrice Harrington gave Evelyn a disdainful look. "It's better this way. When Victoria Sinclair marries into our family, she'll give Nathaniel proper heirs."

"After all, as the Sinclair heiress, she'd never accept being a stepmother." Beatrice swept out without another glance.

Evelyn's lips curled bitterly. Of course, only someone like Victoria Sinclair was worthy of bearing the Whitmore heir. A nobody like her didn't qualify.

She turned to Nathaniel. "I never took you for a liar, Mr. Whitmore. Since when have we used protection?"

Nathaniel blinked, then smirked. "Should I take that as an invitation?"

Evelyn's cheeks burned. Since when did the stoic Nathaniel Whitmore make such crude jokes?

"Don't flatter yourself," she snapped, averting her gaze.

As she moved to leave, Nathaniel blocked her path. "Where do you think you're going?"

"Home."

His eyes darkened. "Home? Or that hotel room?"

Evelyn clenched her fists. Was he mocking her? She forced a saccharine smile. "Why the interrogation, Mr. Whitmore? Jealous? Maybe you should listen to your mother and get that fertility checkup."

"Why would I need that?"

"Don't play dumb. We both know the lack of children isn't my fault. Clearly, you're the one with... performance issues."

Nathaniel's expression turned dangerous. "You know perfectly well how 'healthy' I am. Or did you forget our night together?"

Evelyn stiffened but held her ground. "Oh I remember. That's exactly why I'm suggesting the checkup. Frankly, it was rather... forgettable."

The moment the words left her mouth, she saw Nathaniel's face darken. No man enjoyed such an insult.

Strangely, Evelyn felt a thrill at his reaction. His discomfort was... satisfying.

She'd barely taken three steps when strong arms lifted her off the ground. The world spun as Nathaniel tossed her over his shoulder.

"Put me down!" She pounded his back.

"You'll answer for that remark," Nathaniel growled. The audacity of this woman! First she spends the night with another man, now she questions his virility?

That night a month ago, he'd been drunk. It was his first time. Of course it hadn't been perfect. But to imply he was inadequate?

As Evelyn squirmed, Nathaniel smacked her thigh. "Stop moving." He couldn't risk her harming the baby - not that she knew he was aware of her secret.
###Chapter 24

Evelyn had never experienced such humiliation in her life. Fury and embarrassment burned through her veins.

Nathaniel dragged her into the bedroom without ceremony, throwing her onto the plush mattress with rough hands.

Clenching her fists, Evelyn spat, "Nathaniel Whitmore, you absolute swine! What the hell do you think you're doing?"

Nathaniel braced himself above her, his dark eyes glinting dangerously. "Isn't it obvious? I'm going to make sure you remember this encounter vividly."

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes. "I won't let you."

"Now you play coy?" Nathaniel's laugh was harsh. "You seemed to enjoy provoking me earlier!"

He ripped off his tie and unbuttoned his shirt with sharp movements. His voice dropped to a growl. "Choose. What position would you prefer this time?"

Evelyn felt the insult like a physical slap.

What had possessed this man?

Her voice turned glacial. "Is this how you always react when your pride gets wounded? Like some testosterone-fueled brute?"

"I'm not angry!"

"Really? Your clenched jaw says otherwise. Can't handle a little teasing?"

Nathaniel's nostrils flared.

He seized Evelyn's chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "You've changed, Evelyn. All those years pretending to be the perfect, demure wife must have been exhausting."

"Damn right," Evelyn shot back. "But it was part of the job description. I gave you the performance you paid for."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened painfully. "Then why stop now?"

"Ever heard of an employee entertaining their former employer after quitting?"

"You've grown bold, Evelyn."

"Flattery will get you nowhere," she retorted.

"Name your price," Nathaniel sneered. "How much to continue your services?"

Evelyn's eyes burned. "Excuse me?"

"If you'll spread your legs for some stranger at a hotel, why not for me? I'll pay double. Consider it a lucrative business opportunity."

Evelyn nearly choked on her disbelief. He actually thought she was some common whore?

Disappointment flooded her gaze. "Nathaniel, not all the gold in Fort Knox could make me sleep with you again."

She tried to push him away, but he pinned her wrists. "What's the difference? It's all transactional."

"Because you're terrible in bed," Evelyn snapped.

Nathaniel's face darkened with rage. "Any man would underperform his first time!"

Silence crashed over the room like a tidal wave.

Evelyn's breath caught. Had she heard correctly?

His first time?

Nathaniel Whitmore had been a virgin?

This revelation hit her like a freight train. Not in her wildest fantasies could she have imagined this truth.

Nathaniel's expression turned uncharacteristically vulnerable. He quickly rolled off her, adjusting his clothes with jerky movements. By the time he'd rebuttoned his shirt, his usual composed mask was back in place.

Evelyn sat up awkwardly, throat dry. The tension between them was palpable.

After three years of marriage, she knew Nathaniel's habits intimately.

The man lived with military precision.

Dawn runs. Cold showers. Meals at exact intervals. Work until precisely 11 PM. Not a minute later.

Every object in their home had its designated place. Symmetry was sacred. Disorder made him physically uncomfortable.

Nathaniel's life resembled that of a cloistered monk - all discipline and no pleasure.

Once, Evelyn had admired his self-control. The handsome billionaire with monk-like restraint.

For three years, she'd lived like a nun too.

Marriage to Nathaniel Whitmore wasn't matrimony - it was celibacy with legal benefits.

Given the hordes of women throwing themselves at wealthy heirs, she'd never imagined Nathaniel had remained untouched. Untouched until their disastrous wedding night.
###Chapter 25

Evelyn's heart raced at the thought of revealing the truth to anyone. The consequences would be unthinkable!

Nathaniel's lips curled into a mocking smirk. "Don't flatter yourself. That performance was solely for Grandmother's benefit. You mean nothing to me."

She rose from her seat, smoothing her dress. "Then I'm free to leave?"

"Not so fast." His voice turned sharp. "How would it look if Grandmother discovers you sneaking out alone at midnight? What explanation would satisfy her?"

The memory of Eleanor's icy fingers made Evelyn hesitate. "When is her surgery scheduled?"

His jaw tightened. "You heard her. She refuses treatment."

Nathaniel's frown deepened. "Until she consents to the procedure, our divorce remains undisclosed."

"Understood," Evelyn agreed instantly. "I'll do everything possible to convince her."

His expression softened slightly. "Let's retire for the night."

Evelyn quickly texted Margaret. "Aunt Margaret, I won't return tonight. Please inform Alexander."

She'd promised to come home, but circumstances had changed. Eleanor's declining health took precedence. After enduring three years, what were a few more days?

Scanning the room, Evelyn searched for alternative sleeping arrangements. Only the king-sized bed stood in the master suite.

"I recall spare linens in the closet," she murmured, moving toward the walk-in. "The floor will suffice. It's summer anyway."

But the drawers revealed nothing. This made no sense - she distinctly remembered extra bedding.

Nathaniel's voice cut through her confusion. "Grandmother orchestrated this."

Understanding dawned. Eleanor still hoped for an heir. The truth would devastate her.

Evelyn's gaze flickered between Nathaniel and the solitary bed. "What now?"

"Share it. Don't concern yourself - if I wanted you, three years provided ample opportunity."

Her lips twisted wryly. The truth stung, but he wasn't wrong.

She settled on the far edge, shivering slightly from the air conditioning. Without a word, Nathaniel tossed her the duvet.

"Take it. I don't need it."

She accepted without protest. The pregnancy demanded caution against illness.

As Nathaniel lay beside her, sleep eluded him. He studied Evelyn's silhouette - so different from her usual sharp-tongued self. In slumber, she appeared almost... peaceful.

Hours later, warmth pressed against his chest. Evelyn had migrated across the bed, her face nuzzled into him. The transformation startled him - this vulnerable version intrigued him more than he cared to admit.

Morning found Evelyn alone. Checking the clock, she guessed Nathaniel was at his daily workout. Three years had ingrained his schedule in her memory.

Hunger drove her downstairs. She prepared lemon water and a croissant, the citrus scent refreshing the kitchen.

Nathaniel emerged from the gym, sweat glistening on his forehead. Spotting the familiar spread, his chest tightened. Perhaps her recent defiance had been an act after all.

But as he approached, Evelyn gathered her breakfast and walked away without acknowledgment. The empty counter mocked him. Even the lemon slices seemed to taunt his expectations.

He poured water, the taste turning bitter in his mouth. This wasn't how mornings used to be.

From the sofa, Evelyn felt his gaze but refused to react. She focused on her meal, determined to maintain this new dynamic.

Eleanor's arrival broke the tension. Over breakfast, Evelyn found her appetite surprisingly robust, eating with enthusiasm that drew pleased smiles from the older woman. The unspoken agreement between them all hung heavy in the air - for Eleanor's sake, they would maintain this fragile pretense.
###Chapter 26

Nathaniel watched as Evelyn devoured four pancakes, two slices of toast, and a bowl of cereal.

Did she always eat like this?

After breakfast, Eleanor suddenly handed her an envelope. "Evelyn, I secured you a spot in this competition."

Evelyn examined the invitation—the prestigious Fleur International Design Competition.

Shocked, she turned to Eleanor. "Grandma, when did you arrange this?"

"You sent me some interior design sketches a while ago," Eleanor explained with a smile. "When I heard about this competition, I thought of you. Give it a try. I believe in you."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the invitation, a bittersweet ache settling in her chest. Years ago, she had dreamed of entering, but after marrying Nathaniel, she had buried her passions beneath the weight of his world.

Penelope sauntered into the dining room, her voice dripping with condescension. "Evelyn, that competition is for professionals. With your lack of skill, you’ll only embarrass the Whitmore name."

Eleanor’s sharp retort cut through the air. "Penelope, you didn’t even finish college. Stay quiet."

Humiliated, Penelope stormed off, her cheeks burning.

She remembered the competition was organized by the Sinclairs. Pulling out her phone, she dialed Victoria.

"Victoria, aren’t you involved with the Fleur International Design Competition?"

"Yes, I oversee certain aspects. Why?"

"Grandma just handed Evelyn an invitation," Penelope hissed. "She’s playing favorites. You have to stop her from entering."

A cold smirk curled Victoria’s lips. "Easy. Tomorrow is the last registration day. I’ll have them close it early."

Penelope grinned. "Perfect. I’ll be there to watch her face when she realizes she’s too late. It’ll be priceless."

Victoria chuckled. "Do tell me how it goes."

As if someone like Evelyn could ever compete with her for Nathaniel’s heart.

With the invitation in hand, Evelyn left the Whitmore estate.

Behind her, Nathaniel’s footsteps echoed. His voice, laced with surprise, stopped her. "You do interior design?"

Now it made sense—why Eleanor had discreetly asked him to secure a spot days ago. He hadn’t realized it was for Evelyn.

Evelyn kept her gaze lowered. Of course he wouldn’t know. He never cared to learn anything about her.

"Cat got your tongue?" he taunted.

She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Nope. Just not interested in sharing."

"You’re lying."

"Bingo. And I’m not interested in entertaining you either." She stepped into a waiting cab and left him standing there.

Nathaniel tugged at his tie, irritation flaring.

Robert approached cautiously. "Sir, we’ll be late for the meeting."

Nathaniel stared at the retreating cab. "Do you think she’s provoking me on purpose? Trying to get my attention?"

Robert hesitated. "I think—"

"You agree, don’t you? She’s playing games."

Robert’s expression turned complicated. He didn’t think Evelyn was playing anything.

As they drove off, Robert ventured, "Sir, if we stop the payments for Mrs. Whitmore’s uncle’s treatment, his condition could deteriorate. Are you certain?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Did I say to actually stop them? Use your head."

He just wanted to teach her a lesson.

Robert sighed. Boss logic.

Meanwhile, Evelyn’s phone rang. The hospital’s number flashed on the screen.

Her stomach dropped as she answered. "Hello? Is my uncle okay?"

The voice on the other end was clinical. "We haven’t received payment for this month’s treatment. Please settle it as soon as possible."

The payments had been cut off?
###Chapter 27

Evelyn Carter dashed into the private hospital, her heart pounding as she handed over three years' worth of savings to cover Benjamin Foster's medical bills.

The facility was exorbitantly priced, but it offered the finest care—giving Benjamin the best shot at recovery.

Still, the cost was staggering: 100,000 dors per month.

Evelyn pressed her fingers to her temples. She had forgotten—Nathaniel Whitmore's family had been covering the expenses. Now that their divorce was final, he had no obligation to continue.

Her grip tightened around the competition invitation in her hand. First place meant a million-dor prize.

She quickly texted Sophia Bennett. "Soph, remember the details about the Fleur International Design Competition? Send me everything. I'm entering this year."

Sophia replied instantly. "Finally! With your talent, you'll dominate. Everyone still talks about your old alias."

Evelyn traced the embossed lettering on the invitation.

It was time for a fresh start.

When she returned home, she found Alexander Montgomery waiting with a group—a woman and five strikingly handsome men. Her brothers and cousins?

Alexander stepped forward. "Evelyn, meet Olivia, my wife and your sister-in-law. These are Sebastian and Julian, your older brothers. And these three—Christopher, Andrew, and Daniel—are your cousins."

Evelyn's chest tightened. She offered a small nod, unsure how to react. The unfamiliarity made her stiff.

Then Margaret Dawson spoke up. "Evelyn, the hospital just called. They need payment."

"I've already handled it, Aunt Margaret," Evelyn assured.

Sebastian cut in. "How much more do you need? We can help."

Six pairs of eyes locked onto her, brimming with something desperate—hope.

They wanted her to ask. They had more than enough to give.

Evelyn shook her head. "I'm fine for now."

She assumed they struggled financially too. She wouldn't burden them.

Winning the competition would solve everything.

Unbeknownst to her, her brothers and cousins had been ready to empty their accounts for her. Her refusal crushed them.

Daniel broke the silence. "You're amazing, Evelyn. But remember, you're not alone anymore. We're here. Use us."

Evelyn nodded. "I will."

Having a family only made her more determined to stand on her own.

Then, the question she'd held back spilled out. "Why was I abandoned? Was it because I was a girl?"

The room froze.

Alexander's hands covered his face. When he finally looked up, his eyes were red-rimmed. "Evelyn, you were cherished. We never abandoned you."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Then how did I end up alone?"

The question had festered for years. She'd been too afraid to ask, fearing the answer would confirm her worst fears—that she'd been unwanted.

But seeing them now—their love, their pain—she had to know.

Alexander's voice cracked. "Ask Andrew."

Andrew Montgomery adjusted his glasses. "Your parents died in a car accident. Their rivals sabotaged the family business, bankrupting us. Debts piled up. You were just a baby. The nanny... lost you." His throat worked. "We searched for you for twenty years."
###Chapter 28

The weight in Evelyn's chest began to lift as she processed everything. Her family hadn't intentionally cast her aside.

Alexander finally composed himself, though his eyes remained puffy. "Evelyn, this is all my fault. I failed to properly vet that nanny. Because of my negligence, you were lost to us for all these years."

Evelyn's vision blurred with unshed tears while Margaret wept openly beside her. "You've found your way home, darling. This is truly a blessing."

Though Evelyn had been holding back, Margaret's emotional outburst shattered her composure. The six men exchanged knowing glances. The first phase of their plan was complete.

Now came the delicate work of mending Evelyn's wounded heart.

Alexander discreetly texted his assistant to handle Benjamin's hospital expenses.

The next morning, Evelyn was jolted awake by her ringing phone.

Still groggy, she fumbled for the device. "Hello?"

"Nathaniel's sharp tone cut through her drowsiness. "Evelyn, where's my watch? What did you do with it?"

She sat bolt upright, gripping the phone. "How should I know? Stop bothering me." The call ended with a decisive tap.

Victoria lived with him now, didn't she? Why wasn't he asking his precious Victoria to find his stupid watch?

That bastard was clearly doing this on purpose.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel stared at his phone in disbelief. She'd actually hung up on him!

Snatching the watch from his nightstand, he stormed out without breakfast.

Sliding into the backseat of his car, he immediately grilled Robert. "Did the hospital contact her?"

"They did, sir."

"You're certain?"

Knowing Benjamin's treatment payments had been stopped, how dare she speak to him like that?

Her meager savings couldn't possibly cover the medical bills.

His call had been meant as an olive branch, yet she'd had the audacity to dismiss him!

Robert hesitated before continuing. "Our investigation revealed... someone paid off her uncle's entire medical debt."

Nathaniel scoffed. "She probably scraped together one month's payment."

"Actually, sir... it's been prepaid for the next decade."

"A decade?" Nathaniel yanked at his tie. "Where would she get that kind of money?"

"Records show she only paid one month. An anonymous benefactor covered the remaining nine years."

Nathaniel rolled down the window, letting the morning air cool his temper. "Who do you suppose did this?"

"Perhaps... the gentleman who whisked her away in that helicopter?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. He'd underestimated Evelyn. Cut off from his resources, she'd immediately found another man to bankroll her.

After a tense silence, he ordered, "Compile everything on the Fleur International Design Competition."

The unwanted wake-up call left Evelyn too agitated to sleep.

Emerging from her room, she found a strikingly handsome man lounging on the sofa - her cousin Daniel.

"You look just like that actor, Harrison Sinclair," she remarked.

Daniel coughed into his fist. "I get that a lot. Actually, I'm his body double."

Rising quickly, he changed the subject. "I brought breakfast. My schedule's clear today - thought I could accompany you wherever you need to go."

From now on, he intended to shadow Evelyn everywhere. Between his cousins, he had the most flexible schedule - and the most boredom to alleviate.

Film sets couldn't compare to spending time with his long-lost cousin.

Evelyn showed him the embossed invitation in her hand. "I need to register for this competition at their headquarters."

Though Eleanor had secured her spot, in-person registration was required.

Daniel examined the familiar stationery. Wasn't this the triennial competition hosted by Alexander's company?

As a real estate tycoon, Alexander sponsored interior design contests, with winning concepts implemented in their luxury developments.

Daniel's eyebrows shot up. Since when was Evelyn involved in design?
###Chapter 29

Daniel sensed this was the perfect opportunity for their family.

He cleared his throat and asked, "Evelyn, do you enjoy interior design?"

"Absolutely," Evelyn replied. "It was my major in college. Back then, I dreamed of designing my own home someday. Plus, it's a lucrative career—that's why I chose it."

Hearing that financial stability had influenced her decision, Daniel felt a pang in his chest. "You don’t have to worry about money anymore. You have us now."

Evelyn shook her head with a small smile. "I can’t depend on you forever. I’ve been independent for too long."

She didn’t linger on the topic. The two of them were already in a cab, heading toward the competition venue.

Daniel discreetly pulled out his phone and typed into the family group chat. Big news. Alexander, Evelyn wants to enter the Fleur International Design Competition your company is hosting.

Alexander’s reply was immediate. Ask her if she prefers to win first place.

He wasn’t joking.

Daniel rolled his eyes.

Within minutes, Alexander had arranged everything behind the scenes.

Just then, Olivia chimed in. Darling, isn’t today the last day to register? I checked with the organizers, and they said registration closed early—yesterday.

If that’s true, Evelyn will be devastated if she can’t sign up today.

Alexander’s expression darkened. Who authorized a last-minute schedule change?

I heard it was Victoria’s doing. Suspicious, isn’t it? Olivia mused.

Without hesitation, Alexander called his assistant. Extend the registration deadline to today. And from now on, no one alters the schedule without my approval.

It didn’t matter if registration had supposedly ended yesterday—or even weeks ago. He would reopen it.

Evelyn would enter this competition.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Daniel arrived at the venue.

As Evelyn stepped inside, her eyes swept over the promotional posters lining the walls. She paused at one and smiled. "Daniel, I used to dream of working for Montgomery Estates."

Montgomery Estates?

That was Alexander’s company. But Daniel found real estate painfully dull.

"You’d be bored stiff working there," he said smoothly. "Why not join the entertainment industry instead? With your looks, you’d be a superstar in no time."

He was determined to steer her toward his world—and away from Alexander’s influence.

Evelyn laughed. "No thanks. That life isn’t for me."

At the registration desk, Evelyn handed over her documents.

Just then, Penelope sauntered over. "I can’t believe you actually showed up, Evelyn."

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "If you had the nerve to come, why wouldn’t I?"

"Exactly!" Daniel cut in, his voice dripping with disdain. "Shut your mouth, you botched-surgery disaster."

Penelope’s face twisted in outrage. "Who are you calling a disaster? What surgeries?"

Daniel smirked behind his mask. "If the nose fits..."

His sharp tongue was legendary. No one insulted Evelyn without consequences.

Penelope scoffed. "You haven’t heard, have you? Registration closed yesterday. You’re too late."

Evelyn frowned. "That’s impossible. The deadline was clearly today."

"Go ahead and try, then. See what happens."

Penelope’s smirk was vicious. She had spoken to Victoria, who had pulled strings to cut Evelyn off.

With Alexander’s sister influencing the committee, this should have been an easy victory.

Evelyn wouldn’t stand a chance.

But when Evelyn handed her forms to the clerk, the woman barely glanced at them before nodding. "Evelyn Carter?"

"Yes."

Evelyn braced for rejection.

Instead, the clerk smiled. "Everything checks out. Submit your design by the deadline."

"Th-thank you."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

Penelope’s jaw dropped. "What? Registration closed yesterday! Why did you accept hers?"

The clerk remained unfazed. "No such instructions were given. Ms. Carter meets all requirements."

Penelope stomped her foot, furious.

How had this happened?
###Chapter 30

Evelyn neatly stacked her documents and sighed. "Penelope, is there no end to your idiocy? Didn't you learn anything from last time?"

She tilted her head, eyes glinting with amusement. "Did you come here just so I could humiliate you again? No wonder people whisper about you behind your back. It all makes sense now."

Penelope's face flushed crimson with rage. "I'll make you pay for this, Evelyn!"

Nathaniel stepped forward, his gaze darkening as he loomed over Penelope. "Go ahead. Try it. I dare you." His voice was a low, dangerous growl. "And when you do, I'll make sure your plastic surgeon gets another chance to rebuild that nose of yours."

Penelope instantly clapped a hand over her nose, fear flashing in her eyes.

Evelyn looped her arm through Nathaniel's. "Let's go. Aunt Margaret always says not to waste time on fools."

Fury radiated off Penelope like steam. As they walked away, she quickly snapped a photo of their retreating figures before dialing Victoria.

"Victoria, didn't you tell the committee head to close registrations early to keep Evelyn out?" she hissed.

"That's right," Victoria replied smoothly. "I made sure of it. Registration was supposed to end yesterday."

"Well, guess what?" Penelope seethed. "I came here today just to laugh at her, but instead, I had to watch that witch strut in and register! She humiliated me!"

"That can't be." Victoria's brow furrowed. She had given explicit instructions.

"Victoria, you need to fix this. Get them to reject her application. Ban her from the competition. I won't let her get away with this!"

After hanging up, Victoria immediately called the committee head. "I told you to close registration yesterday. Why wasn't it done?"

"I intended to, Ms. Sinclair," the man stammered. "But Mr. Montgomery personally intervened. He ordered us to stick to the original deadline. We had no choice but to comply."

Victoria slammed the phone down, her composure cracking. Everything had been going perfectly—why did Nathaniel have to interfere now?

She clenched her fists, swallowing her frustration. She couldn't risk crossing Nathaniel openly. Not yet.

With a deep breath, she called Penelope back. "There's nothing we can do. But don't worry—Evelyn knows nothing about interior design. She won't last past the first round."

Penelope scoffed. "True. But that's not all. She wasn't alone. Some guy was with her—looked pretty cozy, too. Maybe her new boyfriend?"

Victoria's interest sharpened. "What did he look like?"

"I took a photo, but he was wearing a mask and hat. Hiding like some celebrity." She sneered. "Probably too ugly to show his face."

"No need to send it," Victoria said smoothly. "But make sure Nathaniel doesn't see it. He might... misunderstand."

She hung up, smirking. Penelope wasn't bright, but she’d take the bait.

Sure enough, Penelope grinned wickedly. If Nathaniel saw this, Evelyn was finished.

Her fingers flew over her phone as she sent the photo to Nathaniel with a venomous message: "Guess who showed up with a new man today? Doesn’t look very innocent to me."

Satisfied, she leaned back. Evelyn wouldn’t recover from this.

Nathaniel was in the middle of a meeting when the notification chimed. He glanced at the photo, his expression hardening.

The man beside Evelyn was unidentifiable—hooded, masked. But the way she smiled at him sent a sharp twist through Nathaniel’s chest.

He forwarded the image to Robert. "Find out who this is."

Robert studied the blurry photo. "Sir, it’s just a back view. Without more—"

"Check the security footage," Nathaniel cut in coldly. "Do I need to spell everything out for you?"

He stared at the photo again. Evelyn’s smile—warm, unguarded—was one he hadn’t seen in years.

It irritated him more than he cared to admit.
###Chapter 31

Evelyn Carter walked through the door of her apartment, still buzzing with excitement from registering for the competition. She immediately sat at her drafting table, pencil flying across the paper as ideas poured out.

That evening, her brothers Alexander, Sebastian, and Julian arrived with their wives for dinner. Olivia Montgomery, Alexander's wife, brought a homemade chocolate cake that smelled divine.

"Did you hear?" Julian said between bites. "Our little Evelyn actually entered the Fleur International Design Competition!"

Alexander's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Tell me, little sister, how badly do you want to win first place?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her wine. "Who wouldn't want to win?" She laughed nervously. But competitions were unpredictable - all she could do was give it her best shot.

Olivia kicked Alexander under the table. "What your brother means," she said smoothly, "is that with your talent, first place is practically guaranteed."

Alexander nodded so vigorously his dark curls bounced. If first place didn't exist for his sister, he'd damn well create it. Principles be damned when it came to family.

Lost in thought, Evelyn excused herself early to refine her designs. After three long years, she finally had this second chance.

Three years ago, marriage had been the last thing on her mind - until Benjamin Foster's medical bills forced her hand. Now, this competition represented a fresh start, for herself and the baby growing inside her.

One week later, the notification arrived: Evelyn had advanced to the finals.

Her phone buzzed immediately with a text from Sophia Bennett. "Told you you'd make it! Congrats, superstar! Knew dumping that waste of oxygen would change your luck!"

Evelyn smiled as she typed back, "I can't argue with results. Things have been looking up."

Minutes later, Sophia's Instagram post went live: "BREAKING: Design genius Evelyn Carter makes triumphant return! Just secured spot in Fleur International finals. Prepare for another victory!"

Evelyn took a steadying breath. She needed that prize money more than she cared to admit.

When Olivia heard the news, she cornered Alexander. "Darling, Victoria Sinclair is competing too. This could complicate things for Evelyn."

Alexander merely shrugged. "Then we'll have two first place winners." His sister would take the top spot - no alternatives existed.

Meanwhile at Whitmore Enterprises headquarters, Robert Chambers knocked on Nathaniel Whitmore's office door. "Sir, the Fleur competition finalists have been announced."

Nathaniel didn't look up from his paperwork. "Any notable names?"

"That designer who disappeared three years ago - Victoria Sinclair - she's on the list."

Nathaniel's pen stilled. "Reach out to her. See if she'd consider joining our team."

"Right away, sir."

"Wait." Nathaniel frowned. "Let me see that list."

Robert handed it over cautiously. "Were you... wondering if Mrs. Whitmore made the cut?"

"I couldn't care less," Nathaniel snapped. "I'm evaluating talent, nothing more."

His eyes skimmed the page - and there it was. Evelyn Carter. A flicker of surprise crossed his features. The timid mouse he'd married had actually accomplished something.

Robert maintained perfect professionalism. "Mrs. Whitmore's design concept shows remarkable innovation. Should we extend an offer to her as well?"

Nathaniel's glare could have frozen lava. "Did I ask for suggestions?"

His gaze darkened as he studied the list again. "Inform the judging committee I'll be joining the final panel."

Robert barely suppressed a cough. Wasn't this exactly the "suggestion" he'd just been chastised for?

"Sir, about that person at registration you wanted identified... With the hat and mask, our investigators hit a dead end."

The paper crumpled in Nathaniel's fist, his expression thunderous.
###Chapter 32

Why was the investigation inconclusive again?

Evelyn Carter let out a small sigh of relief when she learned she had advanced to the finals. Without wasting a moment, she threw herself into perfecting her designs for the final round. This time, she had to win first place.

Just as she was putting the finishing touches on her work, her phone buzzed. The caller ID showed the hospital.

"Ms. Evelyn Carter?" a polite voice asked. "It's time for your prenatal checkup."

Evelyn froze.

Her hand instinctively drifted to her stomach. In the whirlwind of the competition, she had nearly forgotten about the life growing inside her.

She hadn’t told Margaret Dawson—she knew her adoptive aunt would never approve of her keeping the baby. Resolute, Evelyn decided to go to the appointment alone.

As she stepped out of her room, she spotted Daniel Montgomery standing on the balcony, phone pressed to his ear. The moment he saw her, he ended the call abruptly.

"Where are you headed, Evelyn?" he asked, stepping closer. "I’ll come with you."

Evelyn shook her head. "Don’t you have that promotional event for your show?"

Daniel waved a dismissive hand. "It’s nothing major. Just filling in for the lead actor who couldn’t make it. I’m barely in it anyway."

Evelyn hesitated. "I’m just meeting a friend. You should go. I don’t need a babysitter."

Over the past few days, her brothers and cousins had taken turns keeping her company while she worked on her designs. Though she appreciated their concern, she couldn’t ignore the fact that their lives were in Nord City. She had already urged them to return—only Daniel had stubbornly stayed behind.

He ruffled her hair affectionately. "Fine. I’ll be at Centura Mall if you need me."

Deep down, Daniel wanted nothing more than to spend every moment with her, but Olivia Montgomery had warned him not to be too overbearing.

"Got it. See you later," Evelyn said before slipping out.

The cab ride to the hospital was quiet.

During the checkup, the doctor smiled reassuringly. "Everything looks perfect. The baby is healthy. Just keep taking your folic acid and vitamins."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Thank you, Doctor."

Clutching the prescription and her pregnancy report, she stepped out of the examination room—only to freeze at the sight of a familiar figure.

Beatrice Harrington.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. She quickly tucked the report behind her back.

Of all the places to run into Nathaniel’s mother, why here? Women like Beatrice usually frequented private hospitals.

She should’ve checked her horoscope this morning.

Beatrice’s sharp eyes narrowed as she approached. "Evelyn? What are you doing in the gynecology department?" A smirk curled her lips. "Are you pregnant?"

Evelyn forced a laugh. "No, just a hormonal imbalance. Routine checkup."

There was no way she would let Beatrice find out. If she did, Nathaniel would never let her go—and worse, he wouldn’t want this child. Beatrice only saw Victoria Sinclair as her future daughter-in-law.

This baby was hers alone to protect.

She straightened her spine and lied smoothly, "Besides, your son can’t get anyone pregnant. Why do you think I never conceived in three years of marriage?"

She leaned in, lowering her voice mockingly. "I covered for him before, but now that we’re divorcing? Let’s just say Nathaniel has… performance issues."

Beatrice’s face darkened. "You expect me to believe that? Show me what you’re hiding!"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the report.

Her heart hammered against her ribs.

She couldn’t let Beatrice see it.
###Chapter 33

Evelyn extended the pregnancy report toward Beatrice with steady fingers. "Here. Read it if you must. But this is my personal medical record—it has nothing to do with Nathaniel."

Her pulse hammered so violently she feared Beatrice might hear it.

Beatrice studied her for a long moment before letting out a derisive laugh. "Let's not play games. You're clearly here for fertility treatments. How shameless to imply my son is the issue when you're the barren one. I don't need to see your pathetic report."

Relief trickled through Evelyn. Beatrice hadn't guessed the truth. She schooled her expression into indifference. "Suit yourself."

"Wait." Beatrice's eyes narrowed. "Why so defensive? Caught in a lie? Honestly, don't bother with treatments. Once Nathaniel marries Victoria, they'll have perfect children. You'll never trap him with a baby."

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. "The thought never crossed my mind. I have standards."

Her hand drifted protectively over her abdomen. She had always planned to leave the Whitmore estate with her child.

Beatrice's voice dripped with disdain. "Good. Victoria Sinclair comes from wealth and refinement. She's elegant, accomplished, and cultured—the only woman worthy of Nathaniel."

"Only her children deserve the Whitmore legacy. Don't delude yourself into thinking your bastard could ever inherit anything."

With that, Beatrice turned on her heel and strode away, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Evelyn's grip tightened on the report as bitterness coiled in her chest. Beatrice had always despised her humble origins, deemed her unworthy of Nathaniel.

But she had never wanted the Whitmore fortune—only Nathaniel's love.

As Beatrice disappeared down the hall, Evelyn looked down at her stomach. "Don't listen to her, little one. You'll have six uncles who'll adore you. They'll move heaven and earth to keep you safe."

She wasn't alone anymore.

Later, at home, she transferred her folic acid tablets into a vitamin bottle. No one would suspect a thing.

That night, as Evelyn settled into bed, her phone buzzed. A WhatsApp message from Sophia flashed on the screen. "Remember my Instagram post? A top-tier company reached out—they want to hire you. Name your price. Interested?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Which company?"

"Whitmore Global. You know how competitive their grad recruitment is? Well, they're courting YOU. Unheard-of benefits, but brutal standards."

"For you? They'll make exceptions."

Whitmore Global—Nathaniel's empire. Evelyn's fingers hovered over the screen. "I'll think about it."

She wanted nothing to do with Nathaniel. Besides, she planned to return to university soon. A job would complicate things. Her degree came first.

The irony wasn't lost on her—Nathaniel, who once ignored her existence, now extending an olive branch. How laughable that she'd once abandoned her ambitions for him.

Days later, Evelyn submitted her final design entry for the competition. But when the winner announcement date passed with no news, confusion set in.

"Why the delay? This never happened before," she murmured.

Daniel immediately messaged the family group chat. "Alexander, why haven't the results been released?"

Alexander's reply was petulant. "I wanted to throw a gala for Evelyn and reveal her identity! But Olivia vetoed it. Lectured me for fifteen minutes straight."

Olivia chimed in. "The ceremony is fine. But no identity reveal. Evelyn acts carefree, but she's fragile. We can't risk overwhelming her now that she's finally accepting us."
###Chapter 34

Nathaniel's expression turned grave. "I concur. Evelyn shouldn't bear the burden of knowing our true identities."

After a tense silence, Alexander reluctantly agreed. Soon after, Evelyn discovered the competition results had been published online—strangely, without any rankings listed.

Her phone buzzed with an official invitation to next week's awards ceremony. She immediately screenshot the announcement and texted Sophia. "I made it to finals, but they're not showing rankings this year."

Sophia replied within seconds. "You've got to be top three! Though it's bizarre they changed the format last minute."

Evelyn frowned at her screen. The Fleur International Design Competition only occurred every three years—winning meant everything in their industry. Yet this sudden rule change felt... intentional.

Her phone buzzed again. "Evelyn, Whitmore Enterprises increased their offer again. These terms are insane—you'd be crazy not to consider it."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. Sophia knew about her failed marriage, but not that Nathaniel Whitmore was her ex. She typed carefully, "I'm returning to university first. Can't juggle studies and a demanding job right now."

"Your call," Sophia replied. "But promise you'll at least attend the awards gala?"

Evelyn snapped a photo of the embossed invitation and posted it on Instagram with the caption: "Three years later. This time, I finish what I started."

Across town, Nathaniel's assistant Robert rushed into his office. "Sir, Carter made finals but rejected our latest offer."

Nathaniel's jaw tensed as he stared at Evelyn's Instagram post. Three years ago—exactly when she'd vanished from his life. And now this cryptic message...

"Someone's poaching her," Nathaniel muttered. "Find out who."

Robert hesitated. "There's more. Rumor says she disappeared three years ago after some family crisis."

Nathaniel's fingers froze over Evelyn's post. The timing was too precise to be coincidence.

The next morning, Alexander and Olivia arrived at Evelyn's apartment laden with gifts. "Nord City specialties!" Olivia beamed. "For our brilliant finalist!"

Alexander's gaze lingered on Evelyn. "Your post mentioned three years... You competed before?"

Evelyn's smile faltered. "I had to withdraw last round. Family... complications."

Margaret suddenly choked up. "If not for our troubles back then, you'd have—"

"It's history," Evelyn cut in sharply.

Alexander's eyes darkened. "What exactly happened three years ago?"

The air thickened with unspoken secrets as Evelyn turned toward the window, her reflection ghostly against the glass. Outside, storm clouds gathered—mirroring the tempest about to break.
###Chapter 35

The sunlight streamed through the window, casting a warm glow over the room. Evelyn hesitated before speaking. "Three years ago, Uncle Benjamin was in an accident and needed extensive medical treatment. I dropped out of the competition to work as a caregiver for a wealthy family."

She couldn't bring herself to tell Alexander that she had married Nathaniel.

Daniel leaned forward, his eyes bright. "The awards ceremony is next week, isn't it? Let's get you something stunning to wear, Evelyn."

When it came to high-profile events and red carpets, no one had more expertise than him.

Evelyn nodded, though her fingers twisted nervously in her lap.

Alexander exhaled quietly. The Sinclair family was behind the Fleur International Design Competition, which meant he couldn’t reveal himself just yet. The last thing he wanted was for Evelyn to discover his identity and resent him for it. Reluctantly, he had to let Daniel accompany her instead.

But fate had other plans. Both Alexander and Daniel were swamped with work the next day, leaving Olivia to take Evelyn shopping.

The moment they stepped into the upscale mall, Evelyn’s breath caught. The price tags made her stomach drop. She tugged Olivia’s sleeve. "These brands are way out of my budget. Let’s try somewhere else."

Olivia waved her off with a confident smile. "Relax, Evelyn. I know someone who works here—she can get us a discount on an evening gown. This is your first awards ceremony! You deserve to shine."

Before Evelyn could protest, Olivia pulled her toward a Chanel boutique.

Penelope Whitmore had just left the spa when she spotted Evelyn entering the mall. A smirk curled her lips as she followed, designer bag swinging from her arm.

She sauntered up, voice dripping with condescension. "Well, well. Fancy seeing you here, Evelyn. Do you even know how much these dresses cost? A few thousand dollars—peanuts for me, but probably a year’s salary for someone like you."

Olivia arched a brow, unimpressed. "It’s just a dress. I think we can manage."

Money had never been an issue for her. Back in Nord City, she never even glanced at price tags.

Penelope burst into laughter. "Oh, please. This isn’t some flea market where you can haggle over prices. This place is for people like me—not peasants who can’t afford a single piece."

Evelyn’s hands clenched into fists. "Watch your mouth, Penelope."

She could tolerate the insults aimed at her, but she wouldn’t stand for Olivia being disrespected.

Olivia’s eyes narrowed. The moment Penelope introduced herself, she recognized her—another rotten apple from the Whitmore family tree.

Just then, a sales associate approached with several gowns. "Ladies, I’ve selected a few options that might suit you."

Penelope scoffed, eyeing the dresses. "Why are you even looking at evening gowns, Evelyn? Don’t tell me you’re attending the awards ceremony."

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "I am. Got a problem with that?"

Penelope smirked. "You do know only finalists get invites, right? Unless, of course, you’re someone important—like me."

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Who said Evelyn didn’t make it to the finals? Unlike some people who got disqualified for paying someone else to do their designs."

As the wife of the competition’s organizer, she knew exactly what had happened.
###Chapter 36

Evelyn noticed Penelope's hesitant expression. "What ridiculous nonsense are you talking about?"

How did Olivia know about that?

Victoria certainly hadn't anticipated this revelation. She retrieved her phone to show Penelope the invitation. "Look carefully - I earned my spot at the awards ceremony through merit."

"Unlike some people who rely on connections and money because they lack actual talent."

Penelope's face flushed with anger. She never expected Victoria to reach the finals. Glancing at the evening gowns the clerk held, she snapped, "You there! I'll take all three of those dresses."

The sales associate looked uncomfortable. Penelope's expression darkened. "Are you deaf? Package those for me immediately. Don't you recognize who I am?"

"Yes, Ms. Whitmore."

"Wait!" Olivia intercepted the clerk. "We were here first."

Penelope scoffed. "So what? You couldn't possibly afford these. Stop pretending to be something you're not."

"Who said we can't?" Olivia produced a black credit card and thrust it at the clerk. "Go ahead, process it."

No one in Northridge City had ever dared imply she lacked funds before.

Victoria intercepted the transaction. "Hold on." She took the card back. "I haven't even tried these on yet. Let's browse other options."

Olivia had acted impulsively to counter Penelope's taunts. When Victoria intervened, she relented.

Victoria guided Olivia toward another display, but each time they showed interest in an item, Penelope immediately claimed it.

Victoria's eyes sparkled with mischief. She approached a handbag display. The moment she touched one, Penelope rushed over. "I'll take that too!"

Olivia finally snapped. "Are you deliberately provoking us?"

"Absolutely. I want certain people to understand the difference between real wealth and pretenders. If you can't afford luxury, don't shop here!"

Victoria restrained Olivia, then proceeded to examine dozens more items - handbags, shoes, dresses - until she'd circled through most of the boutique's inventory.

"Had enough yet?" Penelope smirked victoriously.

Victoria addressed the clerk. "Look at all these items Ms. Whitmore has selected. Why don't you ring them up now? After all, as a Whitmore, she's both wealthy and generous. She wouldn't possibly renege on her purchases or return them later."

The clerk's hands trembled with excitement at the massive commission she stood to earn.

Only then did Penelope realize she'd selected far too many items. She'd only meant to snatch everything Victoria wanted to humiliate her, never expecting this reversal.

Surveying the mountain of merchandise - much of which she disliked - Penelope blanched at the total cost. "You set me up, Victoria!"

Victoria leaned casually against a display stand. "Indeed I did. If you can't afford them, why pretend otherwise?"

She threw Penelope's earlier words back at her.

Olivia burst into laughter. She'd expected Victoria to be bullied, but her friend had turned the tables masterfully. "Some people love playing wealthy. When reality hits, the act crumbles."

"How dare you! The Whitmores own this mall! Of course I can afford these!" Penelope spat.

The clerk returned with a troubled expression. "Ms. Whitmore, your card was declined. You've exceeded your limit."
###Chapter 37

Evelyn watched as Penelope's face twisted in outrage. "What do you mean declined? That's impossible!"

The sales associate maintained her professional smile. "I'm afraid the payment wasn't approved, Ms. Whitmore."

A flush crept up Penelope's neck. She'd been shopping excessively all month, and now this humiliation in front of Evelyn. That scheming girl had clearly set her up.

Penelope squared her shoulders. "Just put these on my account. I'll settle it tomorrow."

"Our policy requires immediate payment, Ms. Whitmore," the associate replied firmly.

Penelope's hand shot out, striking the woman's cheek. "Do you know who I am? This entire shopping center belongs to the Whitmores! How dare you accuse me of theft!"

The salesgirl's face burned red, her eyes watering. She stood frozen, unsure how to proceed.

Evelyn had seen enough. "The Whitmore Group established these policies, Penelope. Even Nathaniel follows them when he shops here. Does bullying staff make you feel powerful?"

Olivia blinked in surprise. Despite the salesperson's earlier rudeness, Evelyn was defending her.

Penelope scoffed. "Know your place, Evelyn Carter! This is Whitmore business - nothing to do with you. Fetch the manager immediately!"

The manager arrived within moments. "How may I assist you, Ms. Whitmore?"

"Remove these peasants at once!" Penelope jabbed a finger at Evelyn and Olivia. "They can't afford anything here and are disrupting our elite clientele. I want them banned permanently!"

The manager hesitated. "That would violate company policy, Ms. Whitmore."

Penelope's voice turned shrill. "I am company policy! My word is law in Whitmore properties!"

A deep, icy voice cut through the tension. "Since when do you speak for the Whitmore family?"

The temperature seemed to drop several degrees. Evelyn turned to see Nathaniel entering the boutique, his imposing figure commanding attention. Dressed in a tailored navy suit, he moved with effortless authority, his sharp features illuminated by the overhead lights.

Evelyn remembered Nathaniel's unpredictable monthly inspections of Whitmore properties. His unannounced visits kept staff vigilant and maintained the company's impeccable standards. Of all days to encounter him...

Penelope's bravado evaporated. She looked like a child caught stealing candy. "These troublemakers were harassing customers, Nathaniel. I was protecting our brand reputation."

Nathaniel's gaze flicked to Evelyn. "Is this true?"

Evelyn met his eyes steadily. This was new - Nathaniel actually asking for her side. In the past, he'd automatically sided with his family.

"No," she said calmly. "We were shopping when Penelope began insulting us. She tried taking items we selected, then demanded we be removed when her card was declined. Is this how Whitmore Group treats customers?"

"Lies!" Penelope shrieked, though her voice lacked its earlier conviction. "She's twisting everything!"

Evelyn gestured to the security cameras. "The footage will show what really happened."

Panic flashed across Penelope's face. "I was acting in the company's best interests! Look at them - they clearly don't belong here!"

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. "Apologize. Now."

Evelyn's breath caught. Who was he speaking to?

Penelope smirked triumphantly. "You heard him."

Nathaniel's voice dropped dangerously. "I was speaking to you, Penelope. Apologize to our customers immediately."
###Chapter 38

"How can she be treated as a customer?" Penelope shrieked. Being forced to apologize to Evelyn was worse than death itself.

Nathaniel's voice was icy. "As a Whitmore, your behavior has tarnished our family's reputation. If you refuse to apologize, you'll be banned from every Whitmore-owned establishment. Security, escort her out."

His tone left no room for argument.

Penelope's face paled as the guards approached. If she were publicly removed and barred from Whitmore properties, she'd become the laughingstock of high society.

With gritted teeth, she shuffled toward Evelyn, her eyes burning with humiliation. "I'm sorry," she spat.

Evelyn blinked in surprise, glancing at Nathaniel. She hadn't expected him to actually enforce this. Was it for her sake—or simply to protect the Whitmore name?

Olivia crossed her arms. "Is that really an apology? Your tone says otherwise."

Penelope's manicured nails dug into her palms. What more did they want from her?

Nathaniel's gaze remained frosty. "It only counts if the customer accepts it."

Tears welled in Penelope's eyes as she bowed her head. "I'm sorry," she muttered, barely audible.

Olivia smirked. "How about this? We'll forgive Ms. Whitmore if she personally assists us today."

Penelope's stomach twisted at the thought, but Nathaniel's unyielding expression told her she had no choice.

To Evelyn's shock, Nathaniel didn’t leave. Instead, he leaned against a nearby pillar, arms crossed. "To ensure our sincerest apologies are conveyed, I'll oversee this myself."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. Since when did the notoriously busy Nathaniel Whitmore have time to supervise a shopping trip?

Olivia, however, looked pleased. "Evelyn, try this on," she urged, holding up an elegant evening gown.

Evelyn hesitated. "Maybe we should just go..."

The idea of changing in front of Nathaniel made her skin prickle.

Olivia nudged her toward the dressing room. "Relax. We're paying customers. By the way, do you know the Whitmores? That woman clearly had it out for you."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Had Olivia noticed something? "I... used to work as a caretaker for Mrs. Whitmore Senior," she murmured. "I met the family then."

"Ah, that explains it." Olivia winked. "But remember—you're not their employee anymore. Hold your head high."

Before Evelyn could protest, Olivia pushed her into the dressing room. A sales assistant followed, offering a grateful smile. "Let me help you."

"Thank you," Evelyn said softly.

The assistant lowered her voice. "No, thank you. For standing up for me earlier."

Their eyes met in silent understanding.

Minutes later, Evelyn stepped out, the gown hugging her curves perfectly. The assistant had styled her hair into a loose updo, a few tendrils framing her face.

She turned toward the mirror, admiring the reflection. The dress was stunning.

Then she caught Nathaniel's gaze in the mirror.

Heat rushed to her cheeks as she quickly looked away. "Well?" she asked Olivia.

"Gorgeous!" Olivia beamed. "You could make a potato sack look glamorous."

Penelope scoffed silently. Country bumpkins. But she kept her mouth shut—Nathaniel was still watching.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened as he studied Evelyn. The dress accentuated every curve, but the daring open back revealed far too much skin.

His jaw tightened. "Where exactly are you wearing this?"

Why was Evelyn suddenly buying an evening gown? And why did the thought of other men seeing her in it make his blood boil?
###Chapter 39

Before Evelyn could respond, Olivia spoke first. "For an awards gala, naturally."

Awards gala? Nathaniel's mind flashed to the finalists list for the prestigious Fleur International Design Competition.

Indeed, Evelyn had made it to the finals. He hadn't anticipated that.

When Eleanor had insisted on securing Evelyn's participation, Nathaniel had doubted she'd progress this far. His gaze lingered on Evelyn as he murmured, "Congratulations."

Evelyn maintained her composure. "Thank you."

Nathaniel abruptly changed subjects. "That evening gown doesn't suit you."

"Why not? I find it quite elegant."

"It exposes too much of your back."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. The dress was intentionally designed with intricate back cutouts. Of course it revealed skin.

Olivia examined the dress critically. "He's right. Let's consider other options."

Alexander and the Montgomery brothers would likely have collective heart attacks seeing Evelyn in something so daring. Something more modest would be preferable.

Evelyn tried on several more gowns, acutely aware of Nathaniel's piercing gaze following her every move. The scrutiny made her skin prickle. It felt disturbingly like she was modeling these dresses specifically for his approval.

When decision time arrived, Evelyn hesitated. Olivia asked, "Which is your favorite?"

"They're all acceptable." Evelyn's attention kept drifting to Nathaniel's imposing presence. Two hours had passed, yet he remained rooted in place!

Nathaniel pointed decisively at a champagne-hued gown. "This one."

It revealed only Evelyn's delicate shoulders, with full back coverage and no thigh-high slits. Perfectly conservative. Perfectly appropriate.

For reasons she couldn't articulate, Evelyn rebelled against Nathaniel's choice. She reached for the initial daring design. "I prefer this one."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened visibly.

Olivia, fatigued from pregnancy, interjected, "Your choice matters most, Evelyn. Let's proceed with payment."

Penelope approached with false cheer. "This is a limited edition collection. Our policy requires purchasing an additional item. You understand how exclusive boutiques operate, yes? Standard procedure across all Whitmore properties."

"I'll take this as well." Nathaniel brought forward the champagne gown. "Both."

Penelope's smile turned brittle. She addressed Evelyn directly. "That will be twenty thousand dollars. Cash or card?"

Twenty thousand? Evelyn's breath caught. She'd never intended to shop at this luxury boutique, only agreeing because Olivia promised employee discounts. Running into Penelope here had been disastrous luck.

"My card."

"My card."

Two voices overlapped. Evelyn glanced between Olivia and Nathaniel. Olivia's offer didn't surprise her, but Nathaniel's?

Evelyn couldn't risk Olivia discovering their connection. She gently stayed Olivia's hand. "Never mind. Let's leave."

Nathaniel's voice turned smooth. "Don't misunderstand. The Whitmore Group values customer satisfaction. Since our policies created this inconvenience, it's only proper we compensate you."

"Our accounting requires I use a personal card for such exceptions. Consider this the Whitmore family's apology."

Evelyn froze. Since when did Nathaniel Whitmore apologize? His behavior was... unsettling.

Olivia found the explanation perfectly reasonable. "Very well. We accept your apology. Come, Evelyn."

As Olivia collected their purchases, Evelyn caught Penelope's murderous glare and Nathaniel's unreadable expression.

Nathaniel watched Evelyn depart, already imagining which dress she'd wear to the gala. Her deliberate rejection of his conservative choice spoke volumes - she was intentionally defying him.
###Chapter 40

"Nathaniel, how could you defend Evelyn? I was utterly humiliated," Penelope whined, her voice trembling with barely contained rage.

Nathaniel's icy gaze swept over her before he delivered his ultimatum. "If I ever catch you pulling such a stunt again, consider yourself banned from every Whitmore Group property. And trust me, I always keep my promises."

"You can't do this to me! I own shares in this company too!" Penelope's shrill protest echoed through the boutique.

"Because I'm the CEO now." Nathaniel's voice cut like steel. "Your complete lack of contribution is bad enough. I won't tolerate you sabotaging our reputation." Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode away.

Left fuming, Penelope stamped her designer heel but dared not shout after him. Storming out, she immediately dialed Victoria. "You won't believe this - Evelyn actually made the finals of that design competition!"

"Seriously?" Victoria had been too engrossed in her latest collection to notice. She quickly scanned the finalist list on her phone, her blood running cold when she spotted Evelyn Carter's name. "I never imagined she'd get this far."

The Fleur International wasn't some amateur contest - making finals required genuine talent.

"That's not all," Penelope hissed. "She was shopping for a gala dress today. I tried putting her in her place, but Nathaniel showed up out of nowhere! He not only took her side but bought her entire outfit for the awards!"

"What?" Victoria's manicured nails dug into her palm. This couldn't be happening. "She's playing some long game, pretending to retreat just to manipulate Nathaniel's perception. It's already working!"

"Relax," Victoria purred, though her eyes darkened dangerously. "I have ways of handling little upstarts like her." Hanging up, she studied the finalist list with a predator's smile. Nathaniel Whitmore was hers - no insignificant designer would steal what belonged to her.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Olivia exited the mall. "So," Olivia nudged, "what's your take on the illustrious Whitmore CEO?"

Evelyn nearly tripped. "Why do you ask?" Had Olivia guessed their history?

"Just curious. He seems surprisingly principled - making that spoiled brat apologize to protect customer rights."

Evelyn knew Nathaniel's ruthless professionalism well. It was why Whitmore Group dominated the industry. Before today, Olivia had despised the Whitmores ever since Nathaniel's infamous memory loss three years ago - how he'd married someone else despite his very public romance with Victoria.

Yet Olivia kept these thoughts to herself. Living in Nord City, she'd never crossed paths with Nathaniel until now.

Changing the subject, Evelyn examined both dresses at home. Her fingers lingered on Nathaniel's champagne selection. Truthfully, she preferred its elegant modesty over the revealing alternative. Still, accepting his choice felt like surrender - until she remembered how he'd defended her earlier.

Come Saturday, Daniel escorted Evelyn to an upscale salon. When dress selection time came, he immediately vetoed the daring option. "The champagne one," he insisted. "Classy and appropriate."

Relieved - she'd never been comfortable with revealing attire - Evelyn donned Nathaniel's choice.

The awards venue glittered with luxury cars and flashing cameras. Just as Evelyn prepared to exit their limo, a familiar black Bentley pulled up. Her breath caught - Nathaniel wasn't supposed to attend!
###Chapter 41

Nathaniel's sleek black car came to a smooth stop by the curb. A swarm of paparazzi immediately trained their lenses on the vehicle.

The door swung open.

Nathaniel emerged first, his broad shoulders filling out the tailored navy suit perfectly. The dark fabric accentuated his chiseled jawline and piercing gaze.

Right behind him, a pair of designer heels clicked against the pavement.

Victoria Sinclair stepped out gracefully, her ivory gown flowing like liquid moonlight. She adjusted her diamond bracelet with practiced elegance.

Evelyn Carter watched the scene unfold from a distance. Her breath hitched when she saw them together.

Of course they'd arrive as a couple. The media had been calling them "the golden pair" for years.

She forced her expression neutral, though her nails dug into her palms.

At that moment, another car door opened nearby.

"Harrison Sinclair is here!" a photographer shouted.

The media frenzy intensified instantly. Cameras flashed like strobe lights as reporters surged forward.

Harrison rarely made public appearances outside film projects. No commercials. No interviews. His sudden presence here was breaking news.

"Mr. Sinclair! Are you here for the competition?"

"Harrison! Is this business or pleasure?"

The actor remained composed, one hand resting on the car door. "Personal matter," he said smoothly. "Now if you'll excuse me, my companion needs to exit."

The crowd shuffled back eagerly. Who was Harrison Sinclair bringing to this event? A new romantic interest?

Inside the car, Evelyn froze. She hadn't expected this media circus. Her stomach twisted into knots.

She peeked through the tinted window. Nathaniel and Victoria stood barely twenty feet away, looking every inch the power couple.

This was a disaster.

Harrison knocked lightly on the window. "Problem?" His deep voice carried through the glass.

Evelyn swallowed hard. No escaping now.

She smoothed her champagne-colored dress, took a steadying breath, and pushed the door open.

"Mind your head," Harrison murmured, shielding her from the frame with his palm.

The cameras exploded with activity. This was the shot of the year - reclusive superstar Harrison Sinclair being tenderly protective of a mystery woman.

Evelyn blinked against the flashing lights, momentarily blinded.

Harrison didn't hesitate. He clasped her hand firmly and guided her through the chaos toward the venue entrance.

Once inside the secure area, Evelyn finally exhaled. "Why were they photographing you like that?" she whispered.

Harrison shrugged. "Mistaken identity. Happens all the time." His tone was light, but his eyes darted toward the lingering press.

Evelyn almost believed him - until she felt the weight of someone's stare.

She turned instinctively.

Nathaniel's dark gaze pinned her in place from across the lobby. His expression was unreadable, but his jaw looked tight enough to crack walnuts.

Evelyn quickly looked away, focusing on finding her seat assignment.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel remained rooted to his spot, watching his wife walk away with another man. His fingers flexed at his sides.

The champagne dress suited her. He'd always thought so.

Then his attention shifted to Harrison's hand still resting at the small of Evelyn's back.

His eyes turned glacial.
###Chapter 42

Evelyn approached Nathaniel with measured steps. "What's caught your attention?"

Her gaze trailed his line of vision, landing on Victoria. A shadow crossed her features. "I never imagined Ms. Carter would make it this far. Reaching the finals isn't simple. Things make sense now that I see who she's with."

Nathaniel turned sharply. "Explain yourself."

"The man beside her is my cousin, Daniel Montgomery. An acclaimed actor from Nord City. His presence here—with Ms. Carter—is unexpected. He's notoriously private and never seen with women." Victoria's words were deliberate poison.

She watched with satisfaction as Nathaniel's expression hardened into frost. Biting her lip, she glanced toward Evelyn again, genuine confusion flickering in her eyes. When had Evelyn gotten close to Daniel?

The Montgomery brothers had always kept their distance—ever since Alexander brought Victoria home from the orphanage to appease their ailing grandmother. Their missing sister's replacement. A living monument to their loss.

Resentment coiled in Victoria's chest. What gave Evelyn the right to stand so familiarly with Daniel?

She tilted her face up at Nathaniel. "I'm truly grateful you agreed to judge tonight, Nate. Your support means everything."

A noncommittal grunt was his only reply before he strode toward the judges' panel.

Swallowing bitterness, Victoria pulled out her phone. "Is everything prepared as I instructed?"

"Perfectly, Ms. Sinclair. The stage is set."

A smirk curled her lips. Tonight, Evelyn Carter would be humiliated before the entire elite.

Evelyn took her seat among the eleven finalists while Daniel settled directly behind her. The front row glittered with judges and VIP guests. Her breath hitched as Nathaniel walked past—stopping to occupy the center seat, diagonal to her.

He crossed his legs with effortless elegance, the very picture of masculine refinement.

Whispers erupted around her. "Who is that devastating man?"

Evelyn wasn't surprised. Nathaniel's arresting looks had once captivated her too.

Penelope's cloying perfume announced her arrival before the woman herself teetered into view. She deliberately chose the seat directly in front of Evelyn.

Evelyn discreetly fanned her face. The floral assault was overwhelming.

Penelope turned with a triumphant smirk. "Lovely, isn't it? A discontinued masterpiece by Parfums Lumière."

"Perhaps if applied with slightly less... enthusiasm," Evelyn murmured.

A stifled giggle from nearby made Penelope flush. "You're just bitter you'll never own anything this exquisite," she hissed. "Don't think your fluke advancement makes you our equal."

"At least my place wasn't bought with plagiarism," Evelyn countered calmly.

Powder rained from Penelope's trembling cheeks. "This provincial competition means nothing! Nate and I are merely supporting Victoria—soon to be family."

So Nathaniel had come for Victoria after all.
###Chapter 43

Evelyn lowered her gaze, masking her emotions at Penelope's words. The divorce papers were already signed. Who Nathaniel chose to support or be with was no longer her concern.

No matter what else Penelope said, Evelyn tuned her out. Soon, Victoria took the stage to announce the ceremony's commencement.

"As you all know, this year's competition rules have changed," Victoria declared.

"There will only be ten winners, meaning one of the eleven finalists will leave empty-handed. To ensure fairness, the judges will evaluate the designs anonymously. The winners will be announced in reverse order—starting from tenth place."

Evelyn's eyes flickered to the judging panel. Nathaniel sat among them, his presence unmistakable.

Her stomach twisted with nerves. Just then, her phone buzzed—a message from Daniel. "Don’t worry. You’ve got this."

Half an hour later, the judging concluded. Victoria began announcing the results.

"Tenth place goes to… Ninth place…"

The countdown continued until only four finalists remained. Evelyn bit her lip. The unranked one would be eliminated.

Penelope smirked at her. "Don’t tell me you actually thought you’d make top three, Evelyn. This year’s competition is brutal, and that Zoe girl is still in the running."

Evelyn almost laughed. She was Zoe. Should she thank Penelope for the backhanded compliment?

Victoria announced third and second place. Evelyn wasn’t among them. She caught Nathaniel glancing her way, but when she turned to look, he had already averted his gaze.

Her fists clenched as she waited for the final announcement. Victoria’s smile faltered slightly when she noticed the tension between them.

"And in first place… Cassandra Blake!"

Two seats away, a young woman leapt up and rushed to the stage, beaming. Evelyn remained seated, her nails digging into her palms. For one fleeting moment, she had dared to hope.

But reality crashed down. She hadn’t even placed.

Penelope scoffed. "See, Evelyn? I told you to give up. People like you don’t belong in first place. Go crawl back to whatever gutter you came from."

Evelyn stood abruptly and headed for the restroom. She splashed cold water on her face, trying to steady her breathing. Her phone rang—Daniel again.

She ignored it. She didn’t want comfort. She just needed to be alone.

When she stepped out, someone was leaning against the wall—tall, devastatingly handsome.

Nathaniel.

Evelyn lowered her head and tried to walk past, but he caught her wrist. "Is this what you wanted?"

She met his gaze. "I don’t know what you mean."

His grip tightened. "Your new benefactor isn’t very impressive. Couldn’t even get you a win."

"Let go." She yanked her arm back. "I don’t want to talk to you."

Nathaniel didn’t release her. "Already throwing a tantrum? It’s not too late to come to your senses. If you’re looking for a wealthy patron, I could introduce you to a few."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "I don’t need your help."

His smirk was infuriating. "We’ll see."
###Chapter 44

Evelyn let out a sharp laugh. "I don't need them, and I certainly don't need you meddling in my affairs. Let go of me!"

Nathaniel's grip tightened, his voice a low growl. "Watch your tone."

Before the tension could escalate further, Victoria's voice cut through the air. "Nathaniel!"

Evelyn turned to see Victoria and Penelope approaching from the far end of the hallway. Instantly, Nathaniel released her wrist, his fingers slipping away as if burned.

A bitter smirk curled Evelyn's lips. Of course. The moment Victoria appeared, he couldn't distance himself fast enough. Was he afraid of giving her the wrong impression?

Victoria's smile was sweet, but her eyes were ice as they flickered between Nathaniel and Evelyn. "I've been searching everywhere for you. The judges are gathering for a final discussion."

She stepped closer, her gaze settling on Evelyn with false sympathy. "I’m sorry you didn’t place this time, Ms. Carter. You have talent, though. Maybe next year will be your chance."

Evelyn said nothing, her expression unreadable.

Nathaniel turned away. "Let's go."

Victoria nodded. "I’ll catch up—just need to freshen up first."

The moment Nathaniel was out of earshot, Victoria's mask slipped. She tilted her head, her voice dripping with condescension. "This competition should be a wake-up call for you, Evelyn. You scraped into the finals by luck—just like how you lucked into marrying Nathaniel."

Penelope smirked, chiming in. "Did you know Victoria’s family organized this event? Look at how effortlessly she manages everything. Meanwhile, you poured your heart into this, only to fail. Pathetic."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. So that was why she’d been disqualified. The competition was rigged from the start.

She forced herself to walk away, her chest tight.

Back in the main hall, Daniel spotted her immediately. "Evelyn! Where were you? I’ve been looking everywhere."

"Just needed air," she muttered. "Let’s go."

Daniel frowned. "No. I filed a complaint. Something’s off about the judging."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "It won’t change anything."

But Daniel was stubborn. "We’re staying until the results are final."

Reluctantly, Evelyn stayed. Her eyes drifted to the judges’ table—Nathaniel was reviewing a set of designs. Hers.

Then Victoria appeared beside him, leaning in close, whispering something in his ear.

Evelyn looked away, her throat burning.

Nathaniel’s gaze lifted, locking onto her—and then Daniel, standing protectively at her side. His expression darkened.

Victoria followed his line of sight, her lips curving. "Nathaniel," she murmured, "I think we should announce a special consolation prize for Evelyn."
###Chapter 45

Nathaniel's gaze lifted sharply. "A special prize for her?"

The air between them crackled with tension.

"Exactly." Victoria's fingers tightened around her tablet. "Daniel called demanding a re-evaluation. I suspect Nathaniel's influence, but honestly? The results won't change. This special award for Evelyn is merely a compromise."

She studied Nathaniel's reaction through her lashes, bitterness rising in her throat. Why was Alexander insisting on this charade? The Montgomery family's interference always circled back to Nathaniel's obsession with that woman.

At least this would ensure Evelyn stayed out of their lives permanently.

Nathaniel's jaw clenched as he set down the design portfolios. "Which submissions were Evelyn's?"

"The judging was blind, darling." Victoria smoothed her designer dress with practiced calm. "Her work must have been dreadful to get eliminated." She gathered the scattered designs with manicured hands. "Thank you, judges. I'll announce the winners shortly."

Backstage in the temporary office, Victoria's composure shattered. The truth glared at her from the score sheets - Evelyn's designs had topped every category.

With trembling hands, she shredded the offending pages. How had that country mouse outshone professionals? The irony burned - her own insistence on anonymous judging had backfired spectacularly.

No matter. These masterpieces would forever bear Cassandra Blake's name now.

As she exited, the event coordinator intercepted her. "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Montgomery has reassigned closing ceremonies to me."

Victoria's smile turned brittle. "I was just heading to announce-"

"Not necessary. Enjoy the show." The coordinator's tone brooked no argument.

Had Alexander discovered her sabotage?

Confused, Victoria sought Nathaniel in the judges' section. "Darling, let's take our seats." She ignored how his eyes kept drifting toward Evelyn's seat. Was that country bumpkin really worth his attention?

One judge leaned toward Victoria. "Ms. Sinclair, isn't Cassandra competing? Which designs were hers?"

Victoria's mask slipped for a heartbeat before reassembling. She'd rather die than admit the truth. "Isn't it obvious?" she purred.

"The winning collection, of course!" the judge exclaimed. "Cassandra's aesthetic shines through every stitch. Mr. Whitmore was practically glowing when he reviewed them earlier."

Nathaniel examined the designs anew. The judge wasn't wrong. Yet Cassandra had rejected his offers twice. He texted Robert Chambers: "Approach the winner again."

Across the room, Cassandra basked in admirers' attention, business cards piling up in her hands.

Evelyn watched the spectacle with detached amusement until Nathaniel and Victoria swept past to the front row. Penelope Whitmore chirped, "Victoria, aren't you announcing the winners?"

Victoria's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "Alexander worries about my health. Such a protective brother." The lie slid smoothly off her tongue.

The stage lights dimmed as the real drama began.
###Chapter 46

Evelyn exhaled sharply as she adjusted her emerald green evening gown. The sequins caught the chandelier light beautifully.

Victoria Sinclair's laughter tinkled like wind chimes. "I must admit, I'm envious you have such a devoted brother." Her manicured fingers toyed with her champagne flute.

The corners of Evelyn's lips curved upward. "Sebastian does spoil me terribly. He's constantly fussing over my workload and worrying someone might take advantage of me."

Penelope Whitmore's eyes narrowed as she turned abruptly. "Why are you still lurking here, Evelyn? Surely you don't actually believe you stand a chance?" Her voice dripped with condescension. "Any sensible person would have slunk away by now."

Evelyn remained silent, though she noticed Nathaniel Whitmore studying her with unexpected intensity. "The awards haven't been presented yet," she finally responded, keeping her tone even.

Penelope's scoff echoed through the grand ballroom. "I suppose this is your only opportunity to attend galas of this caliber. Better take plenty of photos for your social media - who knows when you'll get another invitation?"

She turned to Nathaniel with a smirk. "After all, without the Whitmore name, you're practically invisible. Isn't that right, cousin?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Your commentary isn't required, Penelope. Or appreciated."

Penelope flushed crimson, but Victoria discreetly squeezed her wrist in warning. The blonde socialite needed constant supervision - such a liability.

The master of ceremonies suddenly appeared on stage, clearing his throat. "Ladies and gentlemen, we must apologize for a scoring discrepancy. After review, the first place winner is actually Ms. Evelyn Carter."

A stunned silence fell over the crowd. Evelyn's breath caught in her throat. First place? How?

Murmurs rippled through the audience. Victoria's champagne flute slipped from her fingers, shattering on the marble floor. This wasn't the humiliating "special recognition" she'd arranged for Evelyn.

Cassandra Blake shot to her feet, nearly toppling her chair. "This is outrageous! I demand an explanation!"

Penelope whirled toward Victoria. "What kind of game are you playing? There's no way she could win!"

Victoria's smile had frozen into something brittle. "I have no idea what's happening." Her phone buzzed uselessly in her clutch - the event coordinator wasn't answering.

The emcee continued calmly, "There was an error in the final tabulation. Ms. Carter's designs were incorrectly scored during preliminary judging."

Cassandra's voice turned shrill. "We want to see the original score sheets! This is completely unacceptable!"

Victoria stood abruptly, her chair scraping loudly. "The judging process was perfectly fair. There must be some other mistake." Her pulse hammered in her throat. If the actual designs were revealed...

As if on cue, the massive screen behind the emcee illuminated, displaying all entries with their corresponding scores. "You'll find each design has been properly attributed," the emcee announced. "Finalists, please verify your work."

Cassandra's face paled. "Those...those aren't my designs in first place. Mine are the ones currently listed second."

The emcee nodded gravely. "Precisely. The anonymous judging process allowed this error to occur. Our deepest apologies."

When the corrections were made, Evelyn's name shone at the top of the list. She barely registered the applause, her gaze locking with Victoria's across the room. This was no accident.

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. How dare that insignificant coordinator defy her instructions? She'd make sure they never worked in this industry again.

"Please join me in congratulating our true first place winner, Ms. Evelyn Carter," the emcee announced, gesturing toward the stage.

The spotlight found Evelyn, illuminating her stunned expression. The game had just changed dramatically.
###Chapter 47

Evelyn rose gracefully from her seat. The weight of countless stares pressed against her skin like invisible fingers.

Penelope's jaw dropped. "This must be some mistake, Victoria! How could Evelyn possibly win first place?" Her voice cracked with disbelief. "Everyone knows Cassandra is actually Zoe!"

The murmurs in the crowd grew louder. Cassandra hadn't denied being Zoe earlier - everyone had taken her silence as confirmation. But if Evelyn was the true winner... did that mean...?

Penelope's manicured nails dug into her palms. This couldn't be happening. Evelyn was just some nobody from the slums. How could she possibly be the legendary designer Zoe?

Victoria's perfect mask slipped for just a second. Her panicked eyes darted toward Nathaniel, who was staring at Evelyn with unsettling intensity.

Nathaniel watched as Evelyn stood from the second row. Her golden dress shimmered under the lights, making her skin glow like honey. There was a radiance about her he'd never seen before - her eyes sparkled, her smile held secrets.

This wasn't the meek, invisible woman he'd married. This version of Evelyn burned bright enough to hurt his eyes.

And if she was Zoe... that meant she'd deliberately rejected every one of his offers. The realization sent a hot spike of anger through his veins.

Evelyn walked toward the stage with her chin lifted, the ghost of a smile playing on her lips. She paused beside the frozen Victoria. "Was this your idea of a surprise, Ms. Sinclair?" Her voice carried perfectly in the silent hall.

Victoria's fists clenched. "Congratulations on your... unexpected win."

"An apology would be more appropriate, don't you think?" Evelyn's tone was honey-sweet. "The Fleur International Design Competition prides itself on integrity. Mistakes like this undermine its credibility."

Victoria's eyes darkened. This little bitch was mocking her! But with all eyes on them, she forced a smile. "Our oversight will be properly addressed."

"Then perhaps you'd do me the honor of presenting the award?" Evelyn held Victoria's gaze, unblinking.

Victoria glanced desperately at Nathaniel. Surely he would intervene? Evelyn always obeyed him.

But Nathaniel remained stone-faced, his dark eyes locked on Evelyn with an expression Victoria couldn't read.

After a charged silence, Nathaniel spoke. "As the organizer's representative, it's your duty to present the award, Ms. Sinclair."

Victoria had no choice. She nodded stiffly, her smile brittle enough to shatter.

Evelyn turned away first, gathering her skirts as she ascended the stage. Three years. Three long years since she'd last stood here.

As Victoria handed her the trophy through gritted teeth, one of the judges called out, "Ms. Carter, your designs bear an uncanny resemblance to Zoe's signature style. Are we to understand you're one and the same?"

Evelyn's smile was enigmatic. "I wouldn't call myself renowned. I've been... absent from the scene for quite some time."

"Why did you disappear three years ago?" the judge pressed.

Evelyn felt the sudden intensity of Nathaniel's gaze like a physical touch. She turned slowly to meet his burning stare across the crowded room.
###Chapter 48

A glint of amusement sparkled in Evelyn's eyes. "Certain private affairs consumed me for three years, nothing more."

Three years prior, she'd wed Nathaniel. From his seat in the front row, Nathaniel's brow furrowed. Was she implying he'd been the one holding her back all this time?

He reclined in his chair, irritation simmering as he glared at Evelyn. The audacity! She'd been the gold-digger who married him for his fortune!

Victoria couldn't help but steal a glance at Nathaniel. Seeing his undivided attention fixed on Evelyn, she dug her manicured nails into her palms until crescent marks appeared. Her expression darkened dangerously.

The event coordinator broke the tension. "Would you care to share more, Ms. Carter? Many are curious about Zoe's—or rather, your—journey in this competition."

Evelyn accepted the microphone, flashing Victoria a knowing smile. "First, I must thank Ms. Sinclair for giving me the unique experience of going from elimination to champion."

Victoria's smile turned brittle, though she maintained the facade through sheer willpower.

Evelyn's gaze swept across the audience. "Second, there's someone else who made this victory possible. Without him, I wouldn't be standing here today."

The coordinator leaned forward eagerly. "And who might that be?"

With a mysterious smile, Evelyn descended the stage, trophy in hand, moving with purpose toward a specific section of the auditorium.

Victoria's breath hitched as she tracked Evelyn's path directly toward Nathaniel. What game was this woman playing now?

Nathaniel remained stone-faced as Evelyn approached, though his pulse betrayed him, quickening with each step she took. He straightened imperceptibly, dark eyes analyzing her every move. More of her manipulative tactics?

Evelyn stopped before him. Nathaniel's breath caught; his muscles tensed as he waited, gaze locked onto hers.

The entire room held its breath.

Then—Evelyn walked right past him. The delicate fabric of her champagne-colored gown whispered against his knuckles, carrying her signature jasmine scent.

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. His fingers twitched with the instinct to reach out, but caught only air. He turned just in time to see Evelyn throwing herself into another man's arms two rows behind him. His expression turned glacial.

The crowd erupted—cheers, applause, even wolf whistles filled the air.

Evelyn beamed up at Daniel as she embraced him. "Thank you, Daniel."

Had he not noticed the irregularities in the competition and demanded a re-evaluation of the designs, this victory might have slipped through her fingers.

Daniel ruffled her hair affectionately. "Don't thank me. Your talent speaks for itself."

He'd initially suspected Alexander's interference when Evelyn faced unfair treatment earlier. Discovering she was Zoe had been the night's greatest surprise.

Evelyn ducked her head slightly. "After three years away, I'd lost confidence in my skills."

When she'd first received the elimination notice, despair had nearly consumed her. She'd wondered how different life might be if she hadn't abandoned her career to marry Nathaniel.

Fate, it seemed, had other plans.

Amidst the celebration, Evelyn's gaze flickered toward the front row, curiosity burning—what expression was Nathaniel wearing now?
###Chapter 49

Evelyn couldn't deny she'd done it deliberately. Her fingers tightened around the trophy as she observed Nathaniel's turned back. He hadn't glanced her way once, completely unaffected by her earlier provocation.

She averted her gaze just as Victoria approached their group. The woman's attention wasn't on Evelyn at all - those calculating eyes were locked onto Daniel instead. Did they share some history?

Victoria greeted Daniel with practiced charm. "What an unexpected pleasure seeing you here."

Daniel's response was glacial. "Small world."

When Victoria opened her mouth to continue, Daniel cut her off. "We're leaving, Evelyn."

Evelyn saw no reason to linger either. Going home early suited her fine. Her unfamiliarity with heels nearly sent her stumbling, but Daniel's steadying grip on her arm prevented disaster. "Careful."

"Right." She looped her arm through his for stability, determined not to faceplant before the paparazzi.

Speaking of which - the media swarm descended as they reached the exit. "Mr. Montgomery! Are you and Zoe romantically involved? How long has this been going on?"

"Mr. Montgomery! Did Zoe withdraw from the competition three years ago because of you?"

Evelyn hadn't anticipated this ambush. The aggressive questioning and flashing cameras made her shrink back instinctively.

Daniel seemed equally unprepared for the media frenzy. Without his usual security detail, he could only position himself as a human shield, protecting Evelyn from the worst of the onslaught.

Across the room, Nathaniel's expression darkened at the spectacle. Victoria chose that moment to murmur, "Daniel appears quite serious this time. No wonder Alexander intervened."

Nathaniel's gaze remained fixed on the exit. "She won first place on merit, not through scheming."

Victoria paled at her misstep. "Of course! The judging mix-up was purely accidental."

Nathaniel hadn't taken his eyes off the struggling couple. He barked an order to Robert before striding toward the commotion. Victoria stayed frozen, knowing she'd overplayed her hand.

Penelope materialized beside her, eyes wide with disbelief. "Victoria, is Evelyn actually Zoe?"

Victoria feigned uncertainty. "Who can say? Zoe's never shown her face publicly. Many have tried claiming her identity over the years."

Penelope scoffed. "Exactly! Evelyn's clearly impersonating her. Probably paid someone to create those designs! And her audacity demanding you present the award - I nearly exploded!"

Victoria offered a pained smile. "What choice did I have?"

"Don't worry," Penelope vowed. "I'll make her pay for humiliating you."

Victoria's eyes gleamed as she demurred, "Be careful, Penelope. She's got powerful backing now."

"Please! A woman who climbs from man to man like a ladder? Nothing to fear there!"

Victoria remained silent, satisfied. Penelope might be dim, but she made an excellent pawn.

As Victoria moved to follow Nathaniel, her phone rang. Alexander's name flashed onscreen. Her hand trembled as she answered. "Alexander?"

"Maya," came the icy reply. "You will distance yourself from all competition and company matters immediately. I trust you understand the gravity of today's miscalculation."
###Chapter 50

Victoria's face paled. "Alexander, let me explain. This wasn't my doing—someone else must have made a mistake."

"But you're in charge. The responsibility falls on you."

When Alexander had heard that Evelyn had briefly gone missing after being eliminated—so distraught she had wandered off—his heart had nearly stopped. He had been seconds away from storming the ceremony to defend her. Thankfully, Olivia had held him back.

Luckily, the truth had come out. Evelyn was Zoe, and her victory was undeniable. Her skill had spoken for itself.

Alexander refused to let her suffer any injustice, especially in a competition this significant.

Victoria opened her mouth to argue further, but the line had already gone dead. She knew better than to call back. Alexander's decisions were final, and his patience with her was thin.

To the world, she lived a charmed life within the Montgomery family. But the reality? Far from it. Aside from their eccentric grandmother, no one truly cared for her. Alexander and his brothers treated her with polite detachment—nothing more than obligatory kindness for their late sister's replacement.

That was why she clung so desperately to Nathaniel. He was her only guarantee of a secure future.

Outside the awards venue, the paparazzi had been shoved back by security. Evelyn and Daniel quickly hailed a cab and slipped away.

Inside the car, Evelyn caught sight of Nathaniel exiting the building. His posture was rigid, his strides purposeful. Moments later, Victoria rushed after him, grabbing his arm.

Evelyn turned her gaze away. She didn’t look back as the cab pulled into traffic.

Daniel had noticed too, but he didn’t care. He had never acknowledged Victoria as family. To him, she was just an outsider.

Evelyn glanced at him. "Daniel, do you and Victoria know each other?"

"Nope. Harrison might, but that’s his business. I’m just the body double. Half the time, people think we’re twins." He smirked. "Did you see those reporters? They thought I was him."

"Won’t this cause trouble for you? What if Harrison hears about it and gets upset?"

Daniel chuckled. "Nah, we’re cool."

How could he be upset with himself?

"Good. That’s a relief."

Later, Evelyn celebrated with Margaret, Alexander, and Olivia. Daniel had to leave early—his manager called, likely about the awards ceremony drama.

At home, Evelyn placed the trophy on her nightstand and snapped a photo for Instagram. The caption read: "Finally reclaimed what I lost three years ago."

She took her folic acid, then rested a hand on her stomach. Winning first place meant better opportunities—higher-paying jobs, more stability.

Soon after her post, Sophia called to congratulate her. They talked for a while.

Then, a WhatsApp notification lit up her screen.

Jonathan Reeves: "Congratulations, Evelyn. Had no idea you were Zoe. Heard you’re finishing your degree. Interested in part-time work at my studio?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. Jonathan had been legendary in their college days. Now he had his own studio?

She typed back: "It’s been three years since I designed anything."

His reply came fast. "Winning that competition proves you’ve still got it. Flexible hours, negotiable pay. Think about it."

Part-time work would be perfect—freedom to focus on her pregnancy while still earning.

"Alright. I’m in."

The next morning, Sophia messaged again. "Okay, be honest—what’s going on with you and—"

Evelyn’s thumb froze mid-scroll. A trending topic glared back at her:

"Award-Winning Actor Harrison Sinclair Spotted with Mystery Woman—New Romance?"

The Novel will be updated daily. Come back and continue reading tomorrow, everyone!
###Chapter 51

Evelyn's head throbbed when she spotted the viral hashtag. The last thing she wanted was to be famous for this.

Scrolling through the posts, she sighed in relief. Only a single blurry photo existed—her and Daniel walking into the venue together.

No clear shots of her face.

Her shoulders relaxed slightly. As long as her identity remained hidden, she could handle the nonsense. But the captions made her frown.

People were spinning wild tales about her and Daniel being secretly together for three years before "going public."

Typical tabloid garbage. The only truths in this mess were their names—everything else was pure fiction.

She explained everything to Sophia over coffee. How Daniel had merely been Harrison's body double, how the paparazzi had mistaken identities.

Afterward, Evelyn went shopping. She loaded up on gifts for Alexander and Olivia to take back to Nord City.

Turning to Daniel, she bit her lip. "Will these rumors cause problems for you?"

"Not at all." He flashed a reassuring smile. "I've already handled the media. That single back-view photo is all they'll ever get."

A pang of sadness hit him. How he wished he could proudly claim Evelyn as his beloved cousin. But the timing wasn't right.

Alexander cleared his throat. "Evelyn, with your competition win, you must have companies lining up. Vista Properties is the organizer—they'd offer the best terms."

His tone carried subtle encouragement. If she joined Vista, he could ensure her protection.

Vista Properties? Evelyn's nose wrinkled. Wasn't that one of Victoria's family companies?

"I've already accepted a part-time position elsewhere," she said firmly.

Disappointment flickered across Alexander's face, but he nodded. Her happiness mattered most.

After seeing them off, Evelyn headed to Jonathan's studio. En route, her phone rang.

"Ms. Carter? I'm the HR manager at Whitmore Group." The voice turned honey-sweet. "We'd love to discuss a position for you. Compensation is flexible."

Whitmore Group? Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. "Why me?"

The manager hesitated. "Well... you're Genevieve, aren't you? We approached your friend twice before, but you declined."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. Nathaniel knew her identity now. Why still pursue her?

"Our CEO genuinely admires your talent," the manager pressed. "This could elevate your career."

Admires her? Evelyn suppressed a shudder. "I've already committed elsewhere. Please thank Mr. Whitmore for his... appreciation."

"Surely you recognize which opportunity holds more value, Ms. Carter?"

"First come, first served." She ended the call abruptly, staring at her darkened screen in confusion.

Why was Nathaniel still chasing her? Did his team not know...?

Meanwhile, the HR manager set down his phone, casting a nervous glance at Nathaniel. "She's... not interested, sir."

Most candidates would kill for this offer. What made Evelyn Carter different?

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "Dismissed."

Alone, he scrolled to Evelyn's Instagram post from last night. His jaw clenched as memories surfaced—her teasing smile, those infuriating dimples.

How he longed to pull her close and wipe that smirk off her face. Properly.
###Chapter 52

Evelyn Carter had transformed into an entirely different woman since signing those divorce papers. Nathaniel Whitmore found her increasingly enigmatic with each passing day.

His phone buzzed abruptly. A trending notification flashed across the screen—Harrison Sinclair's new relationship had gone viral.

Nathaniel's brows knitted tightly. He tapped the link, revealing a photo of Evelyn's retreating figure beside an unfamiliar man. The champagne-colored dress she wore swayed with every graceful step, catching the light.

His fingers twitched involuntarily, remembering how the delicate fabric had once brushed against his skin. Swallowing hard, he took a sip of water before summoning Robert Chambers. "Get this trending topic taken down immediately."

"Right away, sir. Should I also investigate which studio Mrs. Whitmore visited?"

Nathaniel shot him an icy glare. "Don't you have more pressing matters? Dismissed."

Meanwhile, Evelyn hailed a cab to Jonathan Reeves' studio, nestled in a refurbished steel mill turned creative hub. The industrial-chic space pulsed with artistic energy.

As she entered, the receptionist—Natalie Chambers—approached. "Are you here for an interview?"

"In a manner of speaking. Is Jonathan available?"

"Not at the moment. You may wait in the lounge."

Evelyn had barely settled when a voice called out, "Evelyn Carter?"

She turned to face Cassandra Blake, her surprise evident. "What a small world."

"Truly. What brings you here?" Cassandra inquired.

Natalie returned with a water glass. "She's interviewing, Cassandra."

Cassandra's eyes widened. "You? Interviewing at this modest studio? Surely prestigious firms are lining up for you?"

It defied logic—the Fleur International Design Competition's gold medalist, the legendary designer Zoe, choosing Jonathan's humble workspace. Especially with Harrison Sinclair in the picture.

Evelyn remained composed. "I have my reasons."

A flicker of suspicion crossed Cassandra's gaze. "Do you and Jonathan know each other?"

"We do."

"How exactly?" Her tone turned oddly pointed.

Before Evelyn could respond, Jonathan strode in. "You made it, Evelyn."

Cassandra's question came sharp as a blade. "You two are acquainted, Jonathan?"

"Indeed. Evelyn was our junior in college—brilliant, but had to leave for personal reasons," Jonathan explained.

Cassandra's laugh held an edge. "And now the renowned Zoe graces us? Did you charm her into joining, Jonathan?"

Jonathan sighed. "Cassandra, please."

The dynamic became clear—Cassandra's lingering glances betrayed her unspoken feelings for Jonathan.

"Let's discuss in my office," Jonathan suggested.

Evelyn followed wordlessly.

Cassandra watched their retreating figures, then dialed a number with saccharine sweetness. "Penelope Whitmore? Cassandra Blake here. We met at the awards gala?"

A groggy voice answered. "The silver medalist? Get to the point."

Penelope had woken in foul spirits, still reeling from discovering Evelyn's true identity as Zoe. How could that plain woman outshine her?

Cassandra pressed on. "Are you familiar with Evelyn Carter?"

Penelope's voice sharpened. "What's your game?"
###Chapter 53

Evelyn was still seething with frustration. She hadn’t found an outlet for her anger. To add fuel to the fire, Eleanor had been singing Victoria’s praises nonstop. It grated on her nerves like nails on a chalkboard.

Cassandra smirked knowingly. “I spotted her at a tiny studio downtown. Looked like she was there for an interview.”

Evelyn bolted upright in bed, all traces of sleep vanishing. “Tell me everything. And I need that address.”

Cassandra gave her a quick summary before turning to watch Evelyn follow Jonathan out of his office.

Jonathan clapped his hands together. “Everyone, we have a new addition to our team today. Let’s give Evelyn a warm welcome!”

Cassandra’s lips curled into a sly smile. Evelyn had stolen her spotlight, and now she was eyeing the man Cassandra had her sights on. There was no way she’d let this slide.

The next day, Evelyn officially started her job. She wanted to earn some extra cash before her classes began.

The receptionist approached her with a polite smile. “Evelyn, there’s a client asking for you.”

“Me?” Evelyn frowned. It was her first day. Why would a client specifically request her?

She walked to the waiting area and froze. Two women sat on the couch—Beatrice and Penelope. Her expression darkened. “What are you two doing here?”

Penelope gave her a condescending once-over. “We need an interior designer to renovate our home, obviously. Nathaniel is redecorating his marital home—getting rid of all the old, unwanted things.”

Beatrice nodded smugly. “Exactly. My son is marrying a refined young woman from a prestigious family. We can’t have the house looking shabby. This time, the wedding will be grand—no cutting corners like before.”

Evelyn inhaled sharply. “I’m not taking this job. Find someone else.”

It was clear they were here to mess with her. She refused to play their game.

Penelope crossed her legs, smirking. “Turning down clients who come to you? I thought you were desperate for high-profile projects. If you refuse, I’ll file a complaint. See how long you last here.”

She’d brought Beatrice along just to humiliate Evelyn.

Beatrice pulled out a check with a flourish. “Write any amount you want as compensation. You might be from a modest background, but your taste isn’t completely terrible.”

Evelyn didn’t take it. Beatrice raised an eyebrow. “Why let pride get in the way of money? Take the check. This one job could sustain you for months.”

Finally, Evelyn smiled and accepted the check. She scribbled a number and handed it back. “If you’re willing to pay this, I’ll take the job.”

Penelope snatched the check. Her eyes nearly popped out of her head. “A hundred million dollars? Are you out of your mind?”

Evelyn’s smile was icy. “My rates are transparent.”

“A hundred thousand is already generous for someone like you!” Beatrice shot up from her seat. “Let’s go, Penelope. She’s delusional.”

Penelope stood, smirking. “No matter how talented you are, Evelyn, you’ll always be beneath us. Some people are born with everything. You? You’ll always be scrambling for scraps.”

Evelyn’s voice was sharp. “I may not have your wealth, but at least I have basic decency.”

Beatrice’s face twisted in outrage. “How dare you speak to me like that?”

Penelope sneered. “What do you expect from an orphan? Her uncle’s barely clinging to life in the hospital. Who had time to teach her manners?”

Evelyn grabbed a glass of water from the table and flung it straight into Penelope’s face. “Shut your mouth!”
###Chapter 54

Evelyn could tolerate insults directed at herself, but she would never stand for anyone speaking ill of Nathaniel or Margaret.

Penelope screamed, "Have you lost your damn mind, Evelyn? I swear I'm filing a complaint against you!"

Just then, Jonathan arrived, drawn by the commotion. Penelope immediately shrieked, "Are you the manager here? I want to report this ungrateful wench!"

Evelyn set down her tools and met Jonathan's gaze. "I'm sorry about this, Jonathan. Maybe I'm not the right fit for your studio after all."

She refused to drag Jonathan and his team into her mess.

"Hold on. You're not the one who needs to leave." Jonathan turned a cold stare toward Penelope and Beatrice. "I'll have to ask you both to get out. This isn't a playground for spoiled socialites. We earn our keep through hard work and integrity. We don't need your patronage."

Evelyn hadn’t expected Jonathan to defend her. Furious, Penelope and Beatrice hurled a few more curses before storming off.

Cassandra frowned at the scene. She hadn’t anticipated Jonathan taking Evelyn’s side either. It infuriated her.

Once the two women were gone, Evelyn faced Jonathan again. "I'm really sorry about that."

"Don’t be. They were clearly here to provoke you. Forget about them and focus on your work," Jonathan reassured her.

Evelyn nodded. If Jonathan believed in her, she wouldn’t let him down.

Back at home, Penelope and Beatrice changed out of their soaked clothes. Still seething, Beatrice called Nathaniel to complain. "You should have seen Evelyn’s behavior, Nathaniel! We went to offer her a job, and she demanded a hundred million dollars before dumping water on us! She’s completely unhinged!"

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. "Which studio did you visit?"

"Some no-name place at the creative hub. You have to do something, Nathaniel! How dare she treat me like this? Just because she won some insignificant competition doesn’t give her the right to act like a tyrant!"

Nathaniel barely registered the rest of her rant. After hanging up, he turned to Robert. "Find another interior designer for the house renovations."

"Right away, sir." Robert wasn’t surprised—they’d already cycled through multiple designers.

Nathaniel paused. "Actually, make sure it’s a studio from the creative hub."

"You’ve never trusted small studios before, Mr. Whitmore," Robert pointed out.

"Just do it." Nathaniel loosened his tie irritably. Ever since Evelyn left and Gregory redecorated, nothing in the house felt right. No designer had managed to capture what he wanted.

Now, he had to admit—Evelyn had a real talent for this.

When Evelyn returned home that evening, she found Walter and Beverly causing trouble again. Walter’s leg was still in a cast, but that didn’t stop them.

Beverly was screeching at Margaret in the living room. "Hand over the money! Evelyn’s family must have paid you a fortune, but we raised her! That money belongs to us!"

Evelyn stepped inside. "Let’s be clear—even if Aunt Margaret received a single penny, I’d burn it before letting you touch it."

She marched to the kitchen, grabbed the freshly boiled kettle, and returned. "Are you leaving, or should I give you a hot bath right here?"

Beverly flinched at the steaming kettle. She and Walter scrambled out, hurling insults. "You ungrateful brat! Just you wait!"

Once they were gone, Evelyn turned to Margaret. "It’s okay now, Aunt Margaret. I’ll always protect you."

Margaret wiped her tears. "You’ve always been such a good girl, Evelyn. So kind to those who’ve shown you love."

Evelyn comforted her. The next day at work, she received an online order specifically requesting her design services.

She checked the address—and froze.

Wasn’t this the home she’d lived in for three years?
###Chapter 55

A sardonic smile curled Evelyn's lips as she studied the design request. Every corner of that cursed mansion had been meticulously curated with her soul poured into each detail, only for Nathaniel to discard her efforts like yesterday's trash. Now they had the audacity to ask her to redecorate it for him and his precious Victoria?

This was beyond insulting.

Clearly, they wouldn't stop until they'd stripped her of every last shred of dignity. If retreating only invited further humiliation, then confrontation was her only option.

Let them play their games. She'd match them move for move.

Her fingers dialed the number with icy precision. Robert's nervous greeting crackled through the line. "Mrs. Whitmore, I—"

"Spare me the formalities," Evelyn cut in. "We both know who placed this order. I'll take the job—at ten times my usual rate."

Robert swallowed audibly. "I'll need to consult Mr. Whitmore."

The line went dead. Across town, Robert rushed into Nathaniel's office, adjusting his tie. "Sir, Mrs. Whitmore demands a million dollars for the redesign."

Nathaniel's fountain pen stilled mid-signature. "A million?" His laugh held no warmth. "Does she think herself worth that sum?"

"We've burned through half that amount already with five incompetent designers," Robert ventured carefully. "At least we know her work meets your... exacting standards."

Nathaniel's gaze turned arctic. "You presume to know what pleases me?"

Robert wisely fell silent. After a weighted pause, Nathaniel waved a dismissive hand. "Pay the deposit. But remind her I won't release final payment unless satisfied."

Evelyn's phone chimed moments later. She pocketed the $200,000 deposit with grim satisfaction. Let the games begin.

The pharmacy stop was necessary—folic acid supplies dwindling. As she swapped vitamin labels with practiced ease, Evelyn's reflection stared back from the mirrored shelves. Not long now until freedom.

The Whitmore estate loomed like a gilded cage as her cab approached. Abigail's surprised gasp echoed through the foyer. "Mrs. Whitmore! You're—"

"Here on business." Evelyn swept past, her designer heels clicking against marble. The once-harmonious interiors now resembled a tasteless auction house. She fingered the garish new drapes. "Whose tragic idea was this?"

Abigail shifted uncomfortably. "Gregory acted on Ms. Sinclair's instructions."

Evelyn's laughter held knives. "How fitting. Out with the old, in with the new."

"Mr. Whitmore discharged Gregory immediately," Abigail blurted. "He was... displeased."

Evelyn's brows arched. Firing Beatrice's prized lackey? Nathaniel's obsessive perfectionism truly knew no bounds.

"Take inventory of all changes," Evelyn instructed, pulling out her tablet. "You'll assist with contractor coordination."

Abigail hesitated. "Won't you inspect the upstairs?"

Evelyn's grip tightened on her stylus. "Unnecessary."

Some ghosts were better left undisturbed.
###Chapter 56

Evelyn mentally cataloged every alteration in the grand living room, making notes for her redesign plans. She intended to finalize the sketches at home tonight.

The doorbell's chime interrupted her thoughts. Abigail moved to answer, finding two middle-aged women on the doorstep. "May I ask who you're here to see?"

"Move aside, servant!" The older woman pushed past. "We're here to see the lady of this mansion!"

"That's right! I'm your employer's mother-in-law!" The younger one shoved Abigail aside, storming into the foyer.

Evelyn's head snapped up from the sofa. Her fingers tightened around her sketchpad as she recognized the intruders. "Dorothy? Beverly? What are you doing here?"

Dorothy Caldwell ran her wrinkled hands over the Italian leather couch, eyes gleaming. "Imagine my surprise when Henry mentioned you'd married into wealth, Evelyn. Living in this palace while your family struggles!"

Beverly Simmons' shrill voice cut through the air. "You told us your husband was some penniless laborer! Said you dropped out of college to become his housemaid! And all this time you've been living like royalty with servants at your beck and call!"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Henry Peterson - the cab driver from their old neighborhood. She'd been careless letting him drop her at the gated community entrance. Though she'd never revealed which mansion was hers, these vultures had clearly gone door-to-door.

Beverly's envious gaze devoured the crystal chandeliers and marble floors. "You selfish little witch! We could've used that competition prize money! Do you know how many doors we knocked on to find you?"

Evelyn's hands trembled with barely contained fury. "You have no shame! Get out before I have security remove you! My husband's wealth is none of your concern!"

Dorothy dramatically slapped her own thigh, launching into theatrical sobs. "Throw your own grandmother out on the street? Let's see what the neighbors think of that! A granddaughter abandoning her family after striking gold!"

For the first time in her life, Evelyn felt pure, unadulterated rage. These parasites had followed the scent of money straight to Nathaniel's doorstep.

Beverly licked her lips greedily. "That million-dollar prize money would solve all our problems. With a rich husband, you don't need it anyway. Your brother needs it more - how's he supposed to marry without a proper dowry?"

Evelyn's laugh was ice. "Not a single cent."

"Fine!" Dorothy snapped. "Then have your millionaire husband buy your brother a penthouse! Something befitting our new social standing!"

Beverly's eyes lit up. "Yes! A mansion just like this one! With servants and everything!"

Evelyn's control shattered. She hurled the crystal fruit bowl at their feet, shards exploding across the marble. "Dream on, you leeches! I'd sooner burn every dollar than give you one!"

"This is an exclusive neighborhood, not some backwater village! One word to security and you'll be spending the night in jail!"

A deep voice cut through the confrontation like a blade. "What exactly is happening here?" Nathaniel Whitmore stood in the doorway, his tailored suit slightly rumpled from rushing home. His sharp gaze took in the broken crystal, the intruders, and Evelyn's shaking form.

Evelyn's stomach dropped. Of all times for Nathaniel to come home early. Why did fate keep exposing her most humiliating moments to him?

Nathaniel stepped inside, his polished Oxfords crunching over glass shards. His frown deepened as he took in Evelyn's uncharacteristic outburst. "Someone explain. Now."
###Chapter 57

Before Evelyn could utter a word, Dorothy interjected with sickening sweetness. "You must be Nathaniel. Honestly, Evelyn didn’t even mention she married someone as remarkable as you. This is truly a divine blessing!"

"If Evelyn ever misbehaves or throws a fit, just let me know. I’ll set her straight!"

Beverly chimed in with a saccharine smile. "Exactly. We’re family now, after all. We should support each other."

Nathaniel had already done his research on Evelyn’s past. He knew she was adopted but raised primarily by her aunt. That alone spoke volumes about the kind of people her adoptive parents were.

His gaze turned icy as it settled on Beverly and Dorothy. "What do you want?"

Beverly’s eyes gleamed with greed. "It’s simple. That ungrateful girl won a million dors in a competition and didn’t even think to share it with us."

"Her brother is about to start dating. Who knows when he’ll get married? All he needs is a house, but she refuses to help!"

Evelyn’s patience snapped. "Get out of here. Now!"

She should’ve thrown them out the moment they arrived. Then Nathaniel wouldn’t have had to witness this humiliation.

Beverly straightened, smirking. "This isn’t your house, Evelyn. It’s Nathaniel’s. If he hasn’t told us to leave, who are you to order us around?"

Evelyn clenched her fists, shame burning through her. She couldn’t bring herself to meet Nathaniel’s eyes, terrified of seeing mockery or disgust. Her pride was already hanging by a thread—she couldn’t bear for it to shatter completely before their divorce.

Dorothy and Beverly’s sudden appearance had ruined everything. Evelyn lowered her gaze, silent.

Maybe this was for the best. Nathaniel could tell them about the divorce himself. He could make it clear she had no authority in this household.

Once they realized they wouldn’t get anything from her, they’d leave.

After a tense silence, Nathaniel spoke. "She makes the decisions here."

Evelyn’s head snapped up in shock. His expression was unreadable as always, his dark eyes like a storm she couldn’t decipher. But one thing was certain—there was no scorn in them.

Had he really just said that?

If she hadn’t heard it herself, she would’ve thought she was dreaming.

Dorothy and Beverly exchanged stunned glances.

Recovering quickly, Dorothy pressed on shamelessly. "Since you’ve married such an incredible man who treats you so well, Evelyn, surely you can spare a small property for your brother?"

Beverly’s tone softened, dripping with false sincerity. "Think about how we took you in when you were young. You grew up safe and sound because of us. Look at the life you have now."

"We’re not asking for much—just enough for your brother to buy a home. He’s family. You can’t abandon him."

Evelyn inhaled sharply. "I’ll say this one last time—my money is going toward Uncle Benjamin’s medical bills. I won’t give it to anyone else."

Dorothy turned to Nathaniel, desperation creeping into her voice. "Our family isn’t wealthy, Nathaniel. Could you lend us some money? Just enough for Evelyn’s brother to buy a home?"
###Chapter 58

"Grandma!" Evelyn cut Dorothy off sharply the moment money was mentioned. She averted her gaze, cheeks burning with humiliation under Nathaniel's piercing stare.

Despite countless rejections, Dorothy remained shameless in her demands.

"Grandma? You've never treated me as family. This is about your precious grandson, but we shouldn't bail him out recklessly." Dorothy then turned to Nathaniel with a saccharine smile. "You'll help us, won't you, Nathaniel?"

Beside her, Beverly nodded eagerly. Nathaniel's wealth meant security—a lavish house, luxury cars, maybe even cushy jobs for the whole family.

Evelyn's breath caught. She'd already agreed to divorce Nathaniel. If he gave them money now, she'd be no better than the gold-diggers they accused her of being.

She shot Dorothy and Beverly a warning glare before declaring, "You heard me earlier. I make the decisions in this marriage. His opinion doesn't matter."

Beverly scoffed. "Bullshit. Nathaniel's loaded—he obviously calls the shots. Right, Nathaniel?"

Evelyn bit her lip, silently pleading for Nathaniel to refuse.

Nathaniel adjusted his cufflinks, then commanded, "Come here." Confused, Evelyn obeyed.

The moment she stepped close, his arm snaked around her waist, yanking her against his chest. She stiffened, wide-eyed.

Nathaniel addressed the women coldly. "Yes, I'm wealthy."

Dorothy and Beverly exchanged triumphant smirks.

Then his voice dropped, velvet and lethal. "But every cent belongs to Evelyn. She decides how it's spent."

His mint-and-sandalwood scent enveloped her. The steady thud of his heartbeat beneath her ear felt surreal.

He tilted her chin up, lips brushing her ear. "Do whatever you want with it. I trust you."

Evelyn searched his inscrutable gaze. Why was he shielding her now?

Dorothy's grin twisted into outrage. "Evelyn! We raised you! Now you’d abandon us?"

Beverly wheedled, "Just say yes! Nathaniel’s letting you choose!"

Evelyn wrenched free, icy. "I’d sooner burn it than give you a penny."

"You ungrateful wretch!" Dorothy shrieked. "After everything we—"

Nathaniel’s grip tightened. "What brothers?" His voice was deceptively calm.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Damn it. The one secret she’d fought to keep—exposed.
###Chapter 59

In mere moments, Nathaniel realized Evelyn had become someone he barely recognized.

Victoria smirked, "It's always the same story, isn't it? Men love playing hero when girls bat their eyelashes and call them 'big brother' in that sickeningly sweet voice."

Several of Evelyn's so-called brothers suddenly appeared, seizing control of Margaret's assets. A physical altercation nearly broke out.

Victoria was certain these men weren't just ordinary "brothers" to Evelyn.

Nathaniel narrowed his eyes, remembering the mysterious man who'd arrived in a helicopter for Evelyn, and the anonymous benefactor who'd paid a decade's worth of medical bills. Even now, their identities remained unknown.

Could they be part of Evelyn's brotherhood?

Evelyn wouldn't tolerate insults toward her brothers. "Abigail, escort them out. If they cause trouble, alert security to call the police."

Victoria scowled. "Evelyn, you ungrateful brat! You deserve to be punished!"

Dorothy collapsed dramatically on the floor. "Heavens! What sin did I commit to deserve such a granddaughter? The moment she married rich, she abandoned her own family!"

Abigail stood frozen, unfamiliar with such chaotic family drama.

Evelyn burned with humiliation.

Nathaniel grabbed the nearest ceramic mug and smashed it against the floor.

"Evelyn told you to leave," he roared. "Now get out!"

His anger transformed him into an intimidating figure.

Evelyn turned to Nathaniel in shock. Was he... defending her?

The sudden outburst successfully silenced Dorothy's theatrics.

Seeing Nathaniel's fury, the older woman scrambled up and made a noisy exit.

Victoria, equally intimidated, decided silence was wisest and followed Dorothy out.

Peace returned to the penthouse.

Evelyn stared at the shattered ceramic pieces and gave a bitter smile. "Go ahead, laugh at me."

Yes, her adoptive family was absurd and unreasonable.

Margaret had protected her for three years, but Beverly and Dorothy had finally discovered the truth.

The secret was out.

Perhaps she'd carelessly revealed too much in those joyful social media posts.

+15 BONOS

Nathaniel considered the situation. "Knowing your adoptive parents, they won't stop until they get money from you. I can arrange legal representation to handle this."

"No need." Evelyn refused immediately. She could ask Andrew for assistance.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Why? Because my lawyers aren't good enough?"

"Don't misunderstand. I have legal contacts too. I don't want to impose on you."

Nathaniel clenched his jaw. "Another one of your 'brothers,' I presume?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yes."

Andrew had always helped her.

All her brothers were incredibly supportive.

Nathaniel yanked his tie loose in frustration at her confirmation.

"How very... attentive of him. The helicopter rides, five-star hotels, medical bills, now legal protection." His voice dripped with sarcasm. "Your 'brother' certainly knows how to pamper a woman."

No wonder Evelyn wanted a divorce. She'd already found her replacement!

Evelyn paled. "What medical bills?"

Nathaniel scoffed. "Playing innocent now? Isn't that your whole act - the vulnerable damsel attracting white knights? Congratulations on finding your personal ATM."

Evelyn froze.

So Nathaniel believed Victoria's accusations. He thought she'd moved on with someone else.
###Chapter 60

Evelyn lowered her lashes, feigning indifference. "Thank you." She saw no point in correcting Nathaniel's current misconception.

Her polite response only ignited Nathaniel's fury. His lips pressed into a thin line as he warned, "Evelyn, watch your behavior. Don't get too familiar with other men."

"We're divorced," Evelyn countered quietly.

"Until we finalize it at city hall, you're still my wife." Nathaniel's voice turned icy. "Unless you've lost all self-respect, you won't flirt with anyone else."

"Then let's pick a date and go to city hall."

Nathaniel ripped off his tie in frustration. "You're doing this again? You know Eleanor doesn't want us to divorce. Is this your new threat?"

"I'm not threatening you." Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "We can keep it secret. Eleanor doesn't need to know before her surgery."

"Do you think Eleanor's a fool?" Nathaniel grabbed Evelyn's chin roughly. "You're desperate to divorce me. Is it because you can't wait to marry your new lover? What if Eleanor finds out?"

His grip tightened painfully on her jaw.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "I'm just clearing the way for Ms. Sinclair. Wouldn't want to keep her waiting."

"This has nothing to do with Victoria!" Nathaniel had no intention of marrying Victoria anyway. His gaze turned contemptuous. "I'll say this once - if your reckless behavior upsets Eleanor, both you and your new man will pay dearly."

Evelyn's heart plunged into icy depths. To Nathaniel, she was nothing but a shameless woman. That fleeting protective moment earlier had been pure illusion.

No, he hadn't been protective at all. He'd simply dumped the problem back on her. She'd been foolish to imagine otherwise.

Evelyn slapped his hand away. "Don't worry about that. I care more about Eleanor than anyone. To ensure she gets that surgery, I'd do anything."

As she turned to grab her bag from the sofa, Nathaniel seized her wrist. "Stay right here."

"Let go!" Evelyn struggled, her bag tumbling to the floor.

A white container rolled out. The sight made her gasp.

Oh no!

Nathaniel forced her to face him. "You'd do anything for Eleanor's surgery?"

Evelyn held his gaze. "Yes."

Nathaniel's eyes turned flinty. "Eleanor said she'll only have the surgery if you're pregnant."

Pregnant? Evelyn's gaze flickered to the folic acid bottle on the floor. She froze, speechless.

"Cat got your tongue? You were so talkative earlier."

Remembering Eleanor's hospital words, anger surged through Evelyn.

"What do you want me to say? Huh? That we should sleep together and get me pregnant?"

"Absolutely not," Nathaniel refused instantly. He knew this game - she was trying reverse psychology.

"There's another way," Evelyn said quietly.

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. "I'm listening."
###Chapter 61

Evelyn arched a brow. "Eleanor wasn't suggesting she'd only undergo the surgery after I got pregnant. She wants you to have a child. Time isn't on your side, Nathaniel. The older you get, the harder it becomes."

"Did you just imply I'm aging, Evelyn?"

"That's not the point, Mr. Whitmore. If you want Eleanor to agree to the surgery, you need to act fast. Plenty of women would jump at the chance to carry your heir. Sleep around—one of them is bound to stick."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "What kind of man do you take me for?"

Sleep with a different woman every night? Was that really how she saw him?

"Victoria's an obvious choice. You two are perfect for each other. Marry her, start a family—problem solved."

Evelyn met his gaze defiantly.

Her words didn't sit well with Nathaniel. If anything, they irritated him further. He released her arm abruptly. "I intend to build a family with my lawful wife."

"Then let's finalize the divorce tomorrow. Once the papers are signed, you can marry Victoria immediately. She’ll be your lawful wife soon enough."

"You're in such a hurry to discard me—why? So you can run off to your new lover?" Nathaniel scoffed. His foot accidentally kicked a small bottle, sending it rolling across the floor.

It looked like it had fallen from Evelyn's bag.

Her pulse spiked. She lunged for it, but Nathaniel was quicker.

"Give it back!" she demanded.

He held it just out of reach, studying her frantic expression. "Why so defensive? Is this something I shouldn't see?"

Evelyn's wide-eyed panic only deepened his suspicion.

Birth control pills, perhaps?

He turned the bottle over—B-complex vitamins. His tension eased, replaced by dry amusement. "Vitamins? You made a scene over this? Maybe you should take something for your intelligence instead."

Evelyn snatched the bottle back, relief flooding her. Thank goodness she'd switched the labels earlier.

She shoved it into her bag and straightened. "I should go. If they come back, just turn them away."

"You think they’ll harass you again?"

Evelyn blinked. Was that… concern in his voice?

Nathaniel cleared his throat, his tone stiff. "Don’t misunderstand. I just don’t want a repeat of today’s chaos. I despise uninvited guests."

Of course. She exhaled softly. "I’ll handle them." Without another glance, she walked out.

Nathaniel remained rooted in place, watching until she vanished. Sinking onto the couch, he massaged his temples. Hadn’t he made it obvious enough?

He’d been waiting for her to ask for his help. Dispensing with Margaret and Beverly would’ve been effortless. But Evelyn never asked. She’ll deal with it herself—how? By running to that new man of hers?

Tch.

A derisive smirk twisted his lips—though whether it was directed at her or himself, even he wasn’t sure.

Robert hurried in. "Mr. Whitmore, the board is still waiting."

Right. Nathaniel had abandoned a critical meeting when the call came. He shouldn’t have rushed back at all.

As he stood, his fingers brushed against another bottle.

Folic acid?

He held it up, frowning. "Robert—what’s this for?"
###Chapter 62

"Folic acid is a type of prenatal supplement."

Prenatal supplement? Nathaniel's fingers tightened around the small bottle, his expression shifting into something unreadable.

Evelyn was taking prenatal vitamins? Did that mean she was planning for a baby?

His phone vibrated insistently on the desk, but Nathaniel couldn't tear his gaze away from the innocuous-looking pills.

Robert cleared his throat softly. "Sir, it's your mother calling."

With a distracted motion, Nathaniel brought the phone to his ear. "Yes, Mother?"

"Darling, I've been thinking, and there's something you should know." Beatrice's voice carried that familiar note of urgency. "I was at the hospital visiting an old friend last week. And guess who I saw there?"

Nathaniel rolled the bottle between his fingers absently. "Get to the point."

"Evelyn was meeting with an OB-GYN specialist." Beatrice's tone dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "She's clearly trying to get pregnant. With Eleanor backing her, she's determined to stay in this family. You need to be careful—if she gets pregnant, divorce will be impossible."

"What makes you think I want a divorce?" Nathaniel's response came sharper than intended, startling even himself.

Beatrice gasped. "You told me she agreed to the divorce! Don't tell me you've developed feelings for that girl."

"Feelings?" Nathaniel massaged his temples. "Mother, stay out of my personal life. I'll handle this myself."

"Open your eyes, Nathaniel! She's scheming to trap you with a baby. Nothing good ever comes from—"

Nathaniel stopped listening. A slow smirk spread across his face as he studied the bottle again.

"So that's her game," he murmured.

She signed the divorce papers yet secretly took prenatal vitamins.

It all made sense now—her sudden determination to convince Eleanor about the surgery.

That wasn't just persistence—it was a calculated move. Nathaniel ended the call, his mood noticeably lighter.

Tucking the bottle into his jacket pocket, he stood abruptly. "Let's go."

Robert hesitated. "Are we... visiting Ms. Evelyn now?" This didn't align with Nathaniel's previous stance on children. Why wasn't he furious about the prenatal vitamins?

Nathaniel's lips curved. "I'm waiting for her to come to me."

Evelyn was playing hard to get. Fine. Nathaniel could play the long game too.

She'd need his cooperation if she wanted that baby. He'd wait and see what move she made next.

Robert remained silent. Something felt off about this situation, but voicing his doubts seemed unwise.

Meanwhile, Evelyn searched her office frantically. The folic acid bottle was missing from her bag.

She'd purchased two supplements—folic acid and standard vitamins—and transferred the contents between bottles.

The vitamin bottle sat on her desk. But the folic acid was gone.

Had she left it at the Whitmore mansion?

Retracing her steps proved futile. She could only hope it had fallen somewhere between the pharmacy and her office.

Sighing, Evelyn turned to her computer, pulling up design drafts.

Perhaps she could ask the studio team to source materials and have them delivered to the Whitmore estate before beginning the ceiling renovation.

Nathaniel would undoubtedly appreciate the surprise.

Her thoughts were interrupted by Cassandra's sudden appearance. "I'm jealous, Evelyn. Landing such a wealthy client right away. Is the homeowner handsome?"

Evelyn smiled absently. "Very handsome. And very wealthy." She checked her watch. "Actually, I need to head home early. I won't be able to oversee the entire project. Do you know anyone available to assist?"
###Chapter 63



When Evelyn phrased it like that, Cassandra took the bait immediately. She practically squealed, "I'm free, Evelyn! I'd love to help!"

"Thank you so much!" Evelyn handed over the design drafts, relieved she had finally found an excuse to avoid Nathaniel.

Within moments, Cassandra had freshened up and was speeding toward the Whitmore estate in her car.

Before leaving, she had Googled the neighborhood. The search results confirmed it—only the wealthiest families resided there. If Evelyn had described the owner as young and handsome, he had to be the heir to a massive fortune.

Cassandra arrived in high spirits, overseeing the renovation with enthusiasm. But as she stared at the blindingly crimson drapes, she hesitated. Had the workers delivered the wrong fabric?

Not long after, Nathaniel pulled up to his home. Seeing the workers outside, his lips curved into a smirk. Evelyn had to be inside.

He strode into the living room—

And froze.

The blood-red curtains.

The chaotic, asymmetrical patterns.

It was an assault on his refined sensibilities.

Nathaniel scanned the room. "Where's Evelyn?"

"Sir, Evelyn couldn't make it. She's swamped with work. I'm handling everything today. How can I assist you?" Cassandra approached him, starstruck. He was even more gorgeous in person.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Tear it all down. Now."

Another second in this eyesore of a room, and he'd need therapy.

Cassandra blinked. "Is there... an issue?"

"Get out."

Before she could protest, Abigail ushered her out unceremoniously.

Nathaniel collapsed onto the sofa, rubbing his temples. He pulled out his phone and snapped several photos. This had to be intentional.

Meanwhile, Evelyn returned home after work. She still hadn’t found the missing folic acid bottle, and the unease gnawed at her.

Her phone buzzed. A familiar number—Nathaniel’s. She knew exactly why he was calling and ignored it.

Evelyn flopped onto her bed and checked her messages. A text from Nathaniel glared back at her:

"Is this your idea of design?"

Attached were photos of the disaster she had orchestrated.



Oh yes, those were her designs.

The clashing asymmetry.

The garish red fabrics.

The flickering, gaudy gold lights.

Evelyn smirked, proud of her handiwork.

Nathaniel, of course, preferred sleek minimalism—clean lines, muted tones. She had done the exact opposite.

If the Whitmores wanted to make her life miserable, she’d return the favor by ensuring their homes looked like a circus tent.

After dinner, Evelyn remembered the prepaid hospital bill.

She retreated to her room and dialed Alexander.

Alexander was in the middle of a board meeting, his stormy expression making everyone sweat. His assistant timidly slid his phone toward him. "Sir, you have a call."

Alexander's glare could have melted steel. "Do I look like I'm free?"

The assistant gulped but pointed at the screen.

The moment Alexander saw the caller ID, his demeanor shifted. He answered, voice warm. "What's wrong?"

"Am I interrupting, Alexander?"

"Not at all. I’m free." He leaned back, feigning nonchalance. "What do you need?"

"I checked the hospital records. Someone prepaid Benjamin’s bills for the next decade."

Evelyn had a strong suspicion who that someone was.

Alexander cleared his throat. "Yeah, that was me. But don’t stress over it. It’s nothing."

"Thank you, Alexander. I’ll work harder to repay you."
###Chapter 64



"Don't mention it. We're family, after all. Just don't push yourself too hard, alright?" Alexander said to Evelyn before ending the call. Then, his expression hardened as he turned back to the executives in the boardroom. "What are you all gaping at? If next month's reports are as dismal as this one, consider your positions terminated."

The upper management exchanged uneasy glances, curiosity burning in their eyes. Who had called Alexander just now? His wife, perhaps? One moment, he was the embodiment of ruthless authority, and the next, his voice had softened with warmth.

Meanwhile, Evelyn hung up and immediately noted down the amount she owed Alexander. Recalling Beverly’s advice, she realized she could leverage her prize money to secure a loan for a better apartment. Margaret’s rheumatism would benefit from a drier environment.

Determined, Evelyn went to Margaret’s room to share her plan.

Touched, Margaret squeezed her hand. "Evelyn, I think it’s a wonderful idea. Having your own place gives you security. And if you ever remarry, you won’t be entirely dependent on your husband."

"Aunt Margaret, I don’t plan on remarrying."

"Don’t be silly, dear. You have your brothers now. You can find someone worthy of you. Don’t close that door just yet. I’ll keep an eye out for suitable matches."

Evelyn smiled faintly, her hand drifting to her stomach. The moment she decided to keep the baby, she had already resolved never to marry again.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at work.

No sooner had she settled at her desk than Cassandra stormed over in a flurry of designer heels. "Evelyn, you did this on purpose!"

Evelyn took a deliberate bite of her breakfast croissant. "Did what?"

"Stop playing innocent! You tricked me into overseeing that project yesterday just to humiliate me!" Cassandra’s voice trembled with indignation, recalling the scolding she’d received.

All that effort dressing up for nothing.

Evelyn blinked innocently. "You volunteered. What exactly did I do?"

Cassandra’s face contorted, but she couldn’t form a retort. With a huff, she spun on her heel and marched away.

Evelyn finished her breakfast in peace. She knew Cassandra was the one who had betrayed her to Penelope, which led to Beatrice and Penelope publicly shaming her.

But Evelyn wasn’t a doormat anymore. She had learned to fight back.

That afternoon, uniformed officers entered the studio. "Who owns this company?"

Cassandra stepped forward, eager to deflect blame. "The owner isn’t here. How may I assist?"

"We’re here regarding a complaint about fraudulent advertising practices."

"That’s absurd! Our reputation is impeccable. Who filed this complaint?"

"Did you provide services for a certain estate? The owner lodged a formal grievance."

Estate? Evelyn’s mind raced. Then it clicked.

That bastard Nathaniel reported her?

Cassandra smirked and pointed at Evelyn. "Oh, that was her project. You can question her."

Evelyn stood as the officers approached. "Yes, I handled that client."

"Please come with us, ma’am."

Evelyn nodded, silently cursing Nathaniel as she followed them out.

After a brief discussion, the officers sighed. "Look, disagreements happen in projects like these. But you should communicate better. He paid the deposit, didn’t he?"

"You’re right, Officer. I’ll speak with him."

The moment she stepped outside, Evelyn dialed Nathaniel’s number, demanding an explanation.
###Chapter 65

Evelyn called repeatedly, but Nathaniel refused to pick up.

She sent him a text instead. "What exactly don’t you like about the design?"

Minutes passed. Then an hour. Still, no reply.

Evelyn clenched her jaw. He was doing this on purpose.

But if Nathaniel didn’t withdraw the complaint, her studio’s reputation would suffer.

She had to make him change his mind.

When she returned to the office, Cassandra smirked. "Some people think they’re talented, but reality proves otherwise."

Evelyn ignored her.

Cassandra continued, voice dripping with sarcasm. "Sketching a design is one thing. Executing it properly is another. If this complaint isn’t resolved, our credibility will be ruined by year-end."

Evelyn turned to Jonathan instead. "I’ll fix this," she said firmly.

Jonathan studied her. "I believe you, Evelyn. But is there a communication issue with the client? This draft… it doesn’t look like your usual work."

She hesitated. "Maybe I misunderstood his preferences."

There was no way she’d admit she’d sabotaged the design on purpose.

She’d been reckless. She’d forgotten Nathaniel could always escalate things.

That night, she waited for his response. Nothing.

Frustrated, she returned to the studio and redrew the entire draft from scratch.

Then she texted him again. "I’ll show you the revised design this afternoon. What time do you finish work?"

Nathaniel was in a meeting when his phone lit up.

He glanced at the screen. Evelyn’s name flashed.

He’d ignored her all day. He could keep doing so.

Her studio must be desperate to salvage its reputation. Sooner or later, she’d come crawling to him.

He read the message—and chose not to reply.

She knew what she needed to do.

Evelyn waited another hour. Still nothing from that infuriating man.

Fine. If he wouldn’t respond, she’d go to him.

She hailed a cab to their old marital home. She’d redo everything. She might not know every client’s taste, but she knew his.

The house looked different.

She pressed the doorbell. No answer.

She punched in the code—and the door swung open.

He hadn’t even changed it.

Stepping inside, she froze.

The place was empty.

Not a single piece of furniture remained. No curtains. No decorations. Just bare walls and floors.

She could almost feel Nathaniel’s rage when he’d seen her sabotage.

She’d gotten her revenge. Now she had to clean up the mess.

A pang of regret hit her. She shouldn’t have acted so impulsively.

"Evelyn?"

She spun around.

Victoria stood in the kitchen doorway, wearing an apron.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

That apron…

It was hers.

She hadn’t expected to see Victoria here. But she shouldn’t have been surprised.

Victoria and Nathaniel were living together now. Renovating. Preparing for their future.

She was the intruder.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "I’m here for work."

Victoria’s eyes narrowed. "Work?" Then she noticed the file in Evelyn’s hands. "You’re the new designer?"

She sounded shocked.

Victoria had ordered the butler to strip the house bare, erasing every trace of Evelyn.

But Nathaniel had been furious. He’d even fired the butler.

Since then, Victoria had hired countless top designers—yet Nathaniel rejected every proposal.

And now… he’d hired Evelyn?

Victoria’s grip tightened on her apron.

This wasn’t over.
###Chapter 66

Evelyn Carter placed the design blueprint on the table with unwavering confidence, meeting Victoria Sinclair's challenging gaze. "Yes, that's my work. When is Nathaniel returning?"

Victoria lounged on the couch, flipping through the pages carelessly. "He's working late tonight. No idea when he'll be back. But since I live with him, you might as well discuss everything with me."

The room fell into heavy silence, broken only by the rustling of paper. Evelyn remained standing, the ticking of the antique clock on the wall echoing louder in the stillness.

Victoria finally set the designs aside and smirked. "Ms. Carter, I adore this layout, but some elements need refinement. I want a dedicated wall for our wedding portraits. Where would you suggest we place it?"

Wedding portraits?

Evelyn’s fingers twitched involuntarily. When she and Nathaniel had married, he had outright refused to hang their wedding photos. Eleanor Whitmore had pestered him endlessly before he reluctantly agreed to display a single framed picture in the hallway.

Now, with Victoria, he wanted an entire wall.

The realization stung, but Evelyn kept her professional smile intact. "Anywhere you prefer."

Victoria tilted her head. "But you're the expert. I want your professional opinion."

Evelyn gestured toward the foyer wall. "That space would be ideal. You’ll see it immediately upon entering."

Victoria’s lips curled in satisfaction. "Perfect. Oh, and we need a new mattress too. Something plush—Nathaniel hasn’t been sleeping well lately because the current one is too firm."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "There are plenty of luxury brands available, though I’m not specialized in bedding. Perhaps a sales consultant could assist—"

Victoria cut her off. "You’re handling the redesign. You’ll help us choose the mattress as well, won’t you?"

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver. "Of course. I’d be happy to accompany you."

Internally, she seethed.

Victoria beamed. "Excellent. We’ll call you when we’re free. Let’s make sure everything is perfect this time."

Evelyn tapped the blueprint. "Understood. If there’s nothing else, please sign the contract termination."

Victoria hesitated. "Nathaniel filed the original request. Shouldn’t he be the one to sign?"

Evelyn held out her phone, displaying the digital document. "It’s a simple process. And since this is your marital home, you have every right to authorize it—unless you think otherwise?"

Victoria’s eyes narrowed, but she snatched the phone and signed with a flourish.

The moment the signature registered, Evelyn’s shoulders relaxed imperceptibly.

Getting Nathaniel to sign would have been impossible. But Victoria, for all her barbs, was predictable—once appeased, she complied.

As Evelyn turned to leave, Victoria called out, "Ms. Carter, one last question. Who was that man with you at the gala last week?"

Evelyn paused, her voice cool. "That’s private."

Victoria’s smirk turned venomous. "I was relieved when you finally accepted your place. Our worlds were never meant to intersect. But here you are, still clawing your way into circles you don’t belong. You’ll only end up humiliated."

Gold digger, Victoria thought. The moment Nathaniel discarded her, she’d latched onto Daniel Montgomery. Pathetic.

Evelyn arched a brow. "You’re entitled to your opinion. But may I offer one in return?"
###Chapter 67



"Oh, really?" Victoria arched a perfectly sculpted brow at Evelyn. "Go on, then. Say whatever you want."

Evelyn kept her voice steady, though her words carried an edge. "You ordered the butler to remove the old décor, didn’t you? Nathaniel hates the new style, which means you don’t really know him yet. A mistress who can’t even grasp her man’s preferences will never be more than a side piece."

Victoria shot up from her seat, eyes blazing. "Did you just call me a mistress?"

"The law does," Evelyn countered coolly. "Nathaniel and I aren’t divorced yet. So, tell me—what exactly are you?" Without waiting for an answer, she turned to leave.

A sharp yank on her hair stopped her mid-step.

Victoria’s grip was vicious. "And who do you think you are? Some gutter rat who clawed her way up. Know your place. Who gave you the right to speak to me like that?"

Evelyn reacted instantly, twisting around to seize Victoria’s hair in return before digging her nails into the other woman’s waist. "Even with your silver spoon, you’re still just the other woman. Pathetic."

Victoria trembled with rage, her fingers itching to wrap around Evelyn’s throat.

"Enough!" Nathaniel’s voice cut through the tension like a blade.

Both women froze.

His gaze landed on Evelyn first, surprise flickering in his eyes at her uncharacteristic ferocity.

Victoria released Evelyn immediately, her demeanor shifting in an instant. "Nathaniel, you’re back! Look what she did to me—my head hurts, my hands hurt—"

Evelyn turned slowly, meeting Nathaniel’s cold stare.

"Let her go," he commanded, his voice devoid of warmth.

A bitter smirk tugged at Evelyn’s lips. Some things never changed.

She released Victoria, who immediately threw herself against Nathaniel’s chest, sobbing dramatically.

Evelyn straightened her spine, refusing to cower. "She attacked me first. But I already know you won’t believe me, so forget it."

She turned to leave again, but Victoria’s pitiful voice followed her. "It’s fine, Nathaniel. Just let me be the bigger person."

Evelyn clenched her jaw, refusing to look back.

"Stop." Nathaniel’s voice was sharp.

She halted, then turned to face them both. "What now?"

Victoria sniffled. "Really, it’s okay. Let’s not make a scene."

Regret coiled in Evelyn’s chest. She never should have come. Never should have agreed to help him.



The next moment, Nathaniel was beside her, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn held his gaze defiantly. "What? Going to hit me too?"

His frown deepened. "Does it hurt?"

She blinked. Was he… concerned?

Behind him, Victoria’s face twisted in disbelief.

Nathaniel quickly averted his eyes. "Don’t misunderstand. I couldn’t care less. Consider this a lesson—don’t start fights you can’t finish."

Evelyn scoffed. Of course. Just another warning. The sting on her lip was nothing compared to the ache in her chest. "Are we done here?"

"Not yet. Did you forget why you came? Or do you no longer care about the contract?"

"It’s already handled," she said flatly. "Ms. Sinclair signed it on your behalf. The design drafts are on the table. And congratulations in advance."

She didn’t wait for a response, bolting for the door before her composure shattered.

Inside, Nathaniel’s voice turned glacial. "Who gave you permission to sign that?"

Victoria smiled nervously. "Evelyn begged me to help her. Besides, her designs were excellent. I didn’t want to make things harder for her, considering she’s your ex."

"Is that so?" His gaze lingered on the empty doorway.
###Chapter 68

Evelyn's gaze wavered when she locked eyes with Nathaniel.

"It's true. If you don't believe me, ask Abigail. She was there the whole time."

Nathaniel turned to Abigail, who caught the warning in Evelyn's stare.

She ducked her head, stammering, "Mr. Whitmore, I—I was in the kitchen. I didn't actually see what happened."

Evelyn's expression darkened. She hadn’t expected Abigail to defy her.

She quickly explained, "Nathaniel, I didn’t know Ms. Carter was the new designer. You’ve rejected every designer I’ve brought before. Since she handled our home renovation last time, I assumed you’d approve. That’s why I didn’t consult you."

Nathaniel’s face remained unreadable as he strode to the couch and picked up the design portfolio. Flipping through it, the sketches suddenly seemed far more impressive.

When he reached the first page—a concept for a photo wall—his brows furrowed.

"What’s this?"

"Nathaniel, I thought it would be lovely to have a memory wall here. Don’t you think?"

"I think a funeral portrait would fit better," Nathaniel snapped.

Evelyn flinched at his words.

She forced a tight smile. "T-Then never mind."

Nathaniel set the portfolio down and leveled her with a cold stare. "Why are you here?"

Her smile strained, she answered, "I bought fresh seafood and wanted to cook for you. I brought some for Mrs. Whitmore too."

"Don’t bother. And don’t do this again."

Defiance flickered in Evelyn’s eyes as she watched him ascend the stairs.

She whirled on Abigail, dragging her into the kitchen.

A sharp slap cracked across Abigail’s face. "What was that earlier? Did you forget who you answer to? Cross me again, and you’ll regret it."

She seethed, taking her frustration out on the maid. But Evelyn wasn’t done—she wouldn’t let that little upstart, Victoria, get away with humiliating her.

When Victoria returned home, she noticed the cut on her lip.

Margaret fretted over her. "What happened? Were you hurt?"

"Just an accident. It’s nothing."

After disinfecting the wound, Victoria turned to Margaret. "Aunt Margaret, I’ve shortlisted a few houses. Which one do you like?"

"Victoria, isn’t Alexander in real estate? Why not ask him?"

"But he’s in Nord City. We’re in Bern City."

After a moment’s thought, Victoria decided consulting Alexander was still the safest option—he’d know how to avoid pitfalls in the buying process.

She wanted a pre-owned home near the hospital for Margaret’s convenience, rather than a distant new development.

After dinner, she called Alexander. "I’m thinking of using my prize money to buy a house."

Alexander brightened instantly. "Leave it to me! I’ll find you something perfect at a steal."

As soon as they hung up, he texted the family group chat:

"Victoria’s house-hunting. Detached villa or townhouse?"

Sebastian replied, "A villa’s too much. What about a loft?"

The chat exploded with suggestions until Olivia shut it down.

She shot Alexander a look. "None of these will work."

"Why not? I’ll just tell her we got a discount. She’ll buy it."

"Do you think Victoria’s stupid? She only has a million dollars and plans to take a mortgage. There’s no way she can afford a villa or loft near Central Hospital."

Alexander slumped, defeated.

Olivia sighed. "My assistant filtered listings with elevators in safe neighborhoods. Let’s start there."

He stared longingly at the villa listing—just a mile from the hospital.

"Fine. But I’m buying this for her future."

"Just make sure she never finds out."

When Victoria answered Alexander’s video call, his face darkened instantly.

"Victoria, what happened to your face?"
###Chapter 69

Evelyn was stunned. She had almost forgotten about the fight with Victoria, whose sharp nails had left angry red marks on her lips during their scuffle.

"Evelyn, who did this to you? Tell me right now!"

Nathaniel's voice was laced with fury. Who dared lay a hand on Evelyn?

Hastily, Evelyn waved it off. "Relax, Nathaniel. No one hit me. It was just an accident. While I was inspecting the site today, a folder accidentally smacked my lips."

"Are you sure?"

"Positive. I'm fine."

Evelyn had no intention of telling her brothers the truth. The last thing she wanted was to drag them into this mess. Victoria was from Crestwood City—if she wanted to retaliate against Evelyn's brothers, it would be effortless.

She couldn’t risk their safety.

Nathaniel didn’t press further. Instead, he softened his tone. "Evelyn, if anyone ever hurts you, promise you’ll tell us immediately."

"I will."

"Also, don’t worry about the house. I’ll send you the listings by tomorrow. Do you need money?"

Evelyn chuckled.

"I have enough," she assured him.

Olivia chimed in, "Evelyn, we know you want to buy a place near the hospital for Aunt Margaret. But a decent house isn’t cheap. The six of us pooled some money for you."

"You can buy the house now and repay us later. If you’re going to buy one, why not get the best from the start?"

Evelyn hesitated. Olivia’s offer was tempting.

Without missing a beat, Nathaniel added, "Just take it, Evelyn."

Finally, she relented. "Alright. I’ll work hard and pay you all back as soon as I can."

After a brief chat, she ended the call, her heart swelling with gratitude.

Standing before the mirror, Evelyn traced her fingers lightly over her lips. The sting was nothing compared to the throbbing in her head.

But she knew Victoria wasn’t faring any better. Those sharp jabs she’d delivered would leave bruises for days.

A small, satisfied smile curved her lips as she whispered, "I’ll work hard and buy that house."



The next day, Nathaniel sent her the listings. They were far superior to what her previous agent had shown her—and the prices were shockingly reasonable.

Thrilled, she called him immediately.

"Where did you find these?"

Nathaniel cleared his throat. "A friend of mine is a realtor in Crestwood. He recommended these off-market. He’ll handle everything for you."

"Thank you, Nathaniel. I’ll visit them after work tomorrow."

She hadn’t expected him to act so quickly. Energized, she decided to leave work early.

Cassandra overheard her. Applying her lipstick with a smirk, she taunted, "Buying a house? With just a million dollars? Good luck finding anything decent in Crestwood."

Evelyn packed her bag and paused beside Cassandra’s desk. "I’ve been meaning to tell you—that shade of lipstick makes you look like a clown."

Cassandra’s face twisted in rage. By the time she slammed her mirror down, Evelyn was already gone.

Fuming, Cassandra immediately texted Penelope.

"Ms. Whitmore, Evelyn mentioned she’s buying a house."

Penelope replied instantly. "Find out which one."

A wicked gleam lit Cassandra’s eyes. She wouldn’t let Evelyn’s insult go unanswered.

That afternoon, Evelyn toured several properties. The last one stole her breath—spacious, elegantly renovated, and priced at six million.

With the three million her brothers contributed and her competition prize money, she had four million. A two-million-dollar mortgage meant manageable monthly payments.

Now, Evelyn was officially a homeowner—or soon would be.

And she was more determined than ever to succeed.
###Chapter 70

Evelyn had barely stepped through her front door when her phone buzzed with Nathaniel's call.

His voice came through cold and detached. "Did you forget about your responsibilities after receiving the payment? When exactly do you plan to start the interior design work?"

Evelyn nearly dropped her phone in shock.

"I assumed you'd hire another designer," she responded cautiously.

After her explosive confrontation with Victoria yesterday, she'd been certain the vindictive woman would run straight to Nathaniel. Truthfully, Evelyn hadn't even considered this project might still proceed.

Yet here was Nathaniel himself, demanding she continue the work.

Was this some elaborate scheme to humiliate her?

"Why would I do that?" Nathaniel's tone remained impassive.

Evelyn's eyes flicked to the signed contract on her coffee table, and her professional demeanor snapped into place.

"Mr. Whitmore, do you have any specific design preferences? If not, I'll begin furniture selection tomorrow. The renovation will proceed swiftly. There are seasonal promotions happening now - we could secure substantial discounts with early orders!"

Nathaniel's voice turned dry. "Would I dare criticize your designs?"

She'd deliberately submitted that outrageous initial design to provoke him.

"Our studio exists to fulfill every client's vision. Please don't hesitate to share any concerns!"

"Evelyn, what's gotten into you? Can't you just act normally?"

Clearing her throat, Evelyn shifted gears. "Understood. Any other instructions?"

This was purely business now. With mortgage payments looming, she'd cater to any client demand - even if it meant designing her ex-husband's marital home.

She could handle decorating a hundred of Nathaniel's love nests if necessary.

"Complete the furnishings within three days."

The line went dead before she could respond.

As Evelyn studied the contract, her fingers absently traced her still-flat abdomen.

"We're getting our own place soon, little one," she murmured.

Cassandra chose that moment to appear, peering over her shoulder. "Property documents? You're actually buying? Moving fast, aren't we? Which neighborhood?"

Evelyn swiftly tucked away the papers. "Shouldn't you focus on securing your own clients instead of gossiping?"

"Don't get smug. You just got lucky."

"Luck happens to be one of my many talents," Evelyn shot back before retreating to her office.

She needed to finalize furnishings immediately. This million-dollar commission dwarfed her usual projects - she'd ensure Nathaniel got his money's worth, even if it killed her.

The next morning found Evelyn navigating a high-end furniture showroom. Selecting pieces for Nathaniel's home came effortlessly; she still remembered his preferences better than her own.

After photographing several options, she forwarded them to Nathaniel.

"Mr. Whitmore, these represent the latest designer collections. Do any meet your approval?"

Turning to the sales associate, Evelyn added sotto voce, "I'll take the most expensive pieces in each category. And don't forget my commission."

The associate practically glowed. "Absolutely! One moment please."

Evelyn collapsed onto a display sofa, exhausted from hours of browsing, while awaiting Nathaniel's response.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel scrolled through the images in his corporate office. Despite himself, he approved of her selections.

Winning that design competition hadn't been a fluke - Evelyn's talent was undeniable.

Robert's discreet knock interrupted his thoughts. "Mr. Whitmore, your mother has arrived."

Nathaniel set down his phone as Beatrice swept in.

"Darling, have you finalized the divorce with Evelyn yet?"

Nathaniel stiffened. "Why do you ask?"

"Because I've heard she's purchasing a marital home with another man. The scandal would be unacceptable. Settle this quickly before complications arise."

Nathaniel's eyes turned glacial. "Who exactly is she buying property with?"
###Chapter 71

"I have no idea. But she definitely purchased a new property."

Nathaniel scrolled through the furniture catalog on his phone screen.

His jaw tightened as he demanded, "Who gave you this information?"

Even he hadn't been aware of this development.

Beatrice cleared her throat before continuing. "That's not what matters. The house cost six million dollars! There's absolutely no way she could afford that on her salary alone."

"Unless she used the money she supposedly stole from our home. Or perhaps funds obtained through questionable means involving our family."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed instantly. "Mother, Evelyn would never do such things."

"Nathaniel, why are you constantly defending her recently? This isn't like you at all."

Slamming his phone onto the table, Nathaniel responded irritably, "I told you I'll handle this situation myself. Please don't interfere."

"I'm only looking out for your best interests. Ms. Sinclair has been so proactive, even visiting personally. Are you really this oblivious? You two are much better matched. Unless... have you actually fallen for Evelyn? Is that why you're dragging your feet about the divorce?"

Massaging his temples, Nathaniel countered, "Enough. Grandmother Eleanor's health has been unstable lately. I'm considering waiting until after her surgery to proceed with the divorce."

Beatrice's expression darkened at the mention of Eleanor.

"Fine. I'm just reminding you not to be fooled by Evelyn's sudden withdrawal. The truth is she's already moved on - even bought a marital home."

Nathaniel remained silent.

After Beatrice departed, he finally checked his phone.

There was a recent message from Evelyn: "Mr. Whitmore, which option do you prefer? Please advise so I can proceed with the order immediately."

Staring at the screen, realization dawned - this explained her abrupt attitude shift during yesterday's call.

After considerable hesitation, he finally replied: "Your choice."

Powering off his device, Nathaniel loosened his tie, wondering if he'd been devoting too much attention to Evelyn lately.



At the furniture warehouse, Evelyn was nearly asleep when Nathaniel's reply finally came through.

Just two words. Typical of his usual detached demeanor.

Finishing her iced tea, she turned to the sales associate beside her.

"I'll place the order now. Please arrange immediate delivery for available stock."

"Ms. Carter, would you like to include a crib? We offer complimentary gifts with large purchases. Most couples setting up their marital home appreciate having one prepared."

A crib?

Evelyn walked over to inspect the display. The miniature beds looked impossibly delicate and charming.

Running her fingers along the crib's edge, she thought of the child she would soon bring into the world. Her mood lifted instantly.

Though she didn't need it yet.

Patting the display model, she decided, "I'll take this one."

She'd send all her blessings for Nathaniel and Victoria to conceive quickly.

Evelyn followed the delivery truck to Nathaniel's marital home. Decorating the living area took no time at all - after three years of meticulous home design for him, she knew his preferences intimately.

Finally, she stood before the living room's focal wall, directing workers to install a display frame for their oversized wedding portrait.

Abigail approached hesitantly. "Mrs. Whitmore, what about the bedroom?"

"Just basic cleaning and a new mattress."

"Mrs. Whitmore, I'm not very familiar with the master suite. I'd hate to overlook anything important. Perhaps you should inspect it personally?"

After surveying the living area, Evelyn finally ascended to the master bedroom.
###Chapter 72



Evelyn hesitated outside the master bedroom door. The last thing she wanted was to see evidence of Nathaniel living with another woman.

She inhaled sharply and pushed the door open. There was no avoiding this confrontation.

To her astonishment, their wedding portrait still hung prominently above the bed.

"It's still here!"

"Mrs. Whitmore, of course it is. No one would dare remove it," Abigail replied.

Evelyn frowned. Was Victoria truly indifferent to the portrait? Or did Nathaniel have some peculiar preference?

She scanned the room before heading to the walk-in closet. Everything remained nearly identical to how she'd left it. Nothing seemed out of place, and there were no traces of feminine belongings.

It was as if Victoria had never set foot in this house.

Yet Evelyn remembered with painful clarity finding Victoria in this very bed the day she was cast out.

Emerging from the closet, Evelyn turned to Abigail with an awkward smile. "Has he been living alone? No overnight guests?" She quickly added, "Just curious, since there aren't any women's things here."

"None. Not even Ms. Sinclair stayed the night."

Evelyn's brows knitted in confusion.

"That can't be right."

"It's true, Mrs. Whitmore. After their argument, Ms. Sinclair left that same evening."

Evelyn was thoroughly perplexed. At the Whitmore estate, Nathaniel had claimed to be a virgin until their fateful encounter. He'd seemed completely inexperienced.

During their three-year marriage, intimacy had been rare. Between his work obsession and apparent lack of desire, she'd begun to wonder.

If not for that drunken mistake, she might have questioned his preferences entirely.

Evelyn clicked her tongue. "Abigail, tell me honestly—does Nathaniel prefer men?"

"Why don't you ask me directly?"

That deep, familiar voice sent a jolt through her. Nathaniel stood in the doorway, having caught every word.

Abigail fled instantly.

Evelyn feigned nonchalance. "I should check on the renovations downstairs—"

Nathaniel blocked her path.

"You had questions. Ask them now."

Evelyn bit her lip. Just her luck.



She lifted her chin defiantly. "If I said that was the first time I've ever spoken ill of you, would you believe me?"

Leaning against the doorframe, Nathaniel countered, "Do you believe it yourself?"

Evelyn coughed and changed tactics. "The renovations are nearly complete—just the bedroom remains. Any special requests, Mr. Whitmore?"

"Let me inspect first."

Downstairs, Nathaniel paused before the mattress displayed in the hall.

"When did I authorize replacing this?"

Hadn't Victoria suggested it?

Evelyn saw her opportunity. "Mr. Whitmore, this mattress is ideal for someone with your schedule. Your spine must ache from constant work." She warmed to her pitch. "It features motion isolation too—perfect for couples. No more disturbing your partner when you rise early."

As she finished, Nathaniel advanced.

She retreated—directly onto the mattress.

Nathaniel caged her beneath him, knees bracketing her hips.
###Chapter 73

A flush of discomfort crept up Evelyn's neck as she perched on the edge of the mattress.

Every slight shift made her knees bump against Nathaniel's, making it seem like she was deliberately seeking contact.

Clenching her jaw, she muttered, "Mr. Whitmore, if you'll excuse me."

Nathaniel remained unmoving.

He glanced down with hooded eyes. "You chose this mattress. Shouldn't you test it properly to prove your claims?"

"I've tested it enough. You'll discover its quality tonight yourself."

"Already tested it?" His voice turned dangerously soft. "With whom?"

Evelyn's frown deepened. Cassandra must have blabbed to Penelope about her new property.

Maintaining composure, she countered, "Yes, I bought a place. Is that illegal now?"

"Need I remind you we're still legally married? There will be consequences if I discover you're seeing someone."

Seeing someone? Exactly the kind of poison Penelope would spread.

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn tugged his silk tie. "We signed divorce papers. Legally, I'm free to see whoever I choose."

"Evelyn Carter, do I need to repeat myself?"

She snapped back, "What's the matter? You had your affair. Isn't it only fair I get mine?"

"Nathaniel's voice turned thunderous. "Evelyn!"

Suddenly yanking his tie, she shouted, "I'm not deaf!"

The abrupt motion caught Nathaniel off-guard. He lost balance, crashing onto her as their lips collided.

Evelyn froze, eyes wide as saucers.

Nathaniel broke away first, his expression unreadable. Without a word, he strode to his second-floor study.

Evelyn slowly sat up, cheeks burning.

Wiping her mouth, she told Abigail, "Just replace the mattress. Leave everything else."

She couldn't meet the maid's eyes before fleeing the mansion.

In the taxi, her pulse still raced. Rolling down the window, she scrubbed her lips with antiseptic wipes.

Mortifying.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel took several minutes to compose himself in his study before descending.

The renovation chaos had settled.

The transformed foyer looked impeccable - except for one addition.

"What's this?" He pointed to the ornate wall frame.

Abigail answered promptly. "Mrs. Whitmore said it's for your wedding portrait. She thought it would... pop."

His gaze shifted to the white crib nearby. "And this?"

"Mrs. Whitmore mentioned it was complimentary. Said it might prove useful someday."

"Quite the planner, isn't she?"

Nathaniel's fingers absently brushed his lips, recalling their unexpected softness.

Robert entered, presenting a tablet. "Sir, Mrs. Whitmore did purchase property - solely in her name."

Nathaniel scanned the documents, recognizing Evelyn's game.

She'd deliberately leaked news of buying a "marital home," secretly gifted a crib, and suggested displaying their wedding photo.

After a pause, he ordered, "Move our wedding portrait to my bedroom. Place the crib in the second-floor guest room."
###Chapter 74

Robert Chambers examined the photograph frame carefully.

"Wouldn't this location be too conspicuous?" he asked hesitantly.

Nathaniel Whitmore didn't even glance up from his documents. "It's only meant for Grandmother Eleanor's eyes."

Robert felt completely lost, unable to comprehend Nathaniel's unpredictable thought processes.



Evelyn Carter had been struggling to concentrate at work all week. The outstanding payment still hadn't arrived in her account.

Yet every time she remembered their heated encounter in the hallway, her cheeks burned with embarrassment.

Cassandra Blake sauntered over with a steaming cup of coffee. "It's been days since your little project with Mr. Whitmore," she sneered. "Where's that fat paycheck you were bragging about? Did you manage to offend him too?"

Without responding, Evelyn grabbed her phone and stepped outside.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she dialed Robert's number. "Um... I was just wondering about the payment timeline?" she asked, trying to sound professional.

"Mrs. Whitmore, please hold. I'll check with Mr. Whitmore immediately."

When Robert relayed the message, Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Why is she contacting you about this?" he demanded, his voice like ice. "Are you suddenly responsible for her compensation?"

Robert swallowed hard. "Perhaps she couldn't reach you directly, sir?"

Nathaniel's lips curled in a humorless smile as he pulled out his fully functional phone. Not a single missed call from Evelyn.

The message was clear - she was deliberately avoiding him. Did she actually think he'd renege on their agreement?

"Tell her to come collect her payment in person," he ordered coldly.

Robert sighed internally. Once again, he found himself caught in the crossfire of their complicated relationship.

When Evelyn received the summons, anger flared through her. But with Cassandra breathing down her neck and bills piling up, she had no choice.

Why should she be afraid of Nathaniel anyway? If he wanted to play games, she'd meet him head-on.

Grabbing her purse, she hailed a cab to Whitmore Tower.

As the imposing skyscraper came into view, Evelyn realized with a pang that in three years of marriage, she'd never once visited her husband's workplace.

Shaking off the bitter thought, she announced herself at reception and took the elevator up.



Evelyn pushed open the office door with more confidence than she felt - only to freeze at the unexpected sight.

Victoria Sinclair lounged elegantly on the leather couch, her perfect smile faltering the moment she spotted Evelyn.

"What are you doing here?" Victoria demanded sharply. "Security!"

Evelyn's gaze flickered to the insulated food container on the coffee table. Of course - Victoria had brought Nathaniel his lunch.

The realization stung more than she cared to admit.

Victoria looked ready to explode. "Get out! You don't belong here."

Evelyn squared her shoulders and stepped inside. "I was invited, same as you. Why should I leave?"

She deliberately took the seat opposite Victoria, refusing to be intimidated. She was here on business, nothing more.

Victoria's fingers clenched around her designer handbag. The bruises from their last encounter still ached. This crazy bitch would pay eventually.

If only Nathaniel weren't about to walk in, she'd have called her brother to deal with Evelyn properly.

Evelyn sniffed the air delicately. "Chicken soup?" she asked innocently.

Victoria preened immediately. "An exclusive medicinal recipe from my brother's hospital. Far superior to whatever peasant dishes you can cook."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "How unfortunate that Nathaniel prefers my rib stew. Strange how he enjoys my cooking so much, don't you think?"

At that moment, Victoria's eyes flickered over Evelyn's shoulder. "Nathaniel," she purred.

Evelyn's blood ran cold. She didn't need to turn around to know she'd just walked straight into trouble. This year really wasn't her year.
###Chapter 75

Nathaniel entered his office with an unreadable expression. Evelyn couldn't decipher his current mood.

Victoria rushed forward with a bright smile.

"Nathaniel, I brought you some homemade chicken soup."

"Leave us alone first."

Victoria blinked in shock. She even glanced at Evelyn, wondering if Nathaniel had mistaken who he was dismissing. Surely he meant to send Evelyn away?

Nathaniel's sharp gaze landed on Victoria. His displeasure was evident.

Though seething inside, she forced a composed smile.

"Of course. I'll wait outside."

Evelyn listened as Victoria's stilettos clicked away down the hallway.

Now they were alone in the expansive office.

Evelyn straightened on the couch, meeting Nathaniel's gaze evenly.

The sharp clatter of his pen hitting the desk broke the silence.

His voice was ice. "Well?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Will you still honor our payment agreement?"

Nathaniel yanked at his tie in frustration.

His glare burned into her. "Is money all you care about, Evelyn?"

Brushing imaginary lint from her skirt, she stood. "If you're reneging, forget I asked."

She cursed her earlier loose tongue. That moment of temper had cost her eight hundred thousand dollars.

"Grandmother's health has declined. She may have heard rumors and plans to visit the marital home soon. You'll move back."

Evelyn froze.

"But she seemed fine last week. Isn't her surgery scheduled?"

"The date isn't confirmed yet. I expect you to maintain appearances until after her procedure."

Evelyn regained her composure. "I'll comply. But you should arrange her surgery promptly."

"Don't presume to instruct me."

Breaking eye contact, she turned toward the exit.

Victoria waited outside, barely containing her fury.

Seeing Evelyn emerge, she pounced. "Why are you still clinging to Nathaniel? The divorce is final!"

Evelyn's mood darkened further.

With a mocking smile, she countered, "Really? He just ordered me back to our marital home."

"Liar!"

Victoria refused to believe it.

"Suit yourself."

When Victoria grabbed her wrist, Evelyn met the cold warning with raised brows. "Fascinating how you can't eliminate me despite your resources. Best of luck, Ms. Sinclair."

She patted Victoria's shoulder condescendingly before striding toward the elevators.

Victoria stared after her, eyes blazing with murderous rage.

After composing herself, she reentered Nathaniel's office with renewed sweetness. "Nathaniel, about the soup—"

"Take it. Don't repeat this gesture."

He didn't look up from his documents.

Clutching the thermos, Victoria forced calm. "Oh, Julian mentioned he's visiting Nord City on business."

Nathaniel finally glanced up. "When?"

"In a few days. I'll arrange dinner for us three?"

Nathaniel nodded. "Acceptable."

Victory flashed in Victoria's eyes.

Casually, she probed, "Did you really ask Ms. Carter to return?"

She was certain Evelyn had lied.

"Yes. Grandmother's visiting soon. I won't have her distressed before surgery."

Victoria masked her fury with concern. "Of course. I'll ensure Julian prioritizes her case."

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "Appreciated."

"My pleasure entirely."
###Chapter 76

Victoria Sinclair left the office with the thermal scan, a sly grin curling her lips as she thought, Evelyn Carter, you don’t stand a chance against me.

She would persuade Julian Montgomery by any means necessary to perform the surgery on Eleanor Whitmore. This was the only way to eliminate Evelyn for good.

Nathaniel Whitmore rubbed his temples in frustration after reviewing the documents in his office.

He called out to Robert Chambers. "Transfer the remaining payment to her."

Robert immediately handled the matter. Then, he placed a takeout container on the table.

"Mr. Whitmore, it's time for lunch."

Nathaniel set the documents aside and walked toward the coffee table.

When he saw the contents of the container, his expression darkened instantly.

"What is this?"

"Beef stew. I thought it was your favorite?"

Nathaniel was immediately reminded of Evelyn’s earlier words.

Irritated, he massaged his temples and snapped, "Never bring this dish to me again!"

Just as Evelyn arrived at her studio, her phone buzzed with a bank notification.

After counting the digits, she confirmed the remaining eight hundred thousand dollars had been deposited into her account.

She had assumed Nathaniel wouldn’t pay her—not after she’d called him a masochist.

This was unexpected.

Had she misjudged him? Despite his infidelity, was he actually decent?

Cassandra Blake stepped out of the office and sneered, "Evelyn, where’s the rest of the payment? We’ve been waiting."

Jonathan Reeves stood nearby and added lightly, "No rush. Take your time."

Evelyn waved her phone with a smirk. "Sorry to disappoint, but the payment’s already here."

Jonathan smiled. "I knew you’d pull it off, Evelyn."

Cassandra’s face twisted with fury at his support.

"Of course it was easy for you. I heard you got very cozy with the mansion’s owner during the supervision."

Jonathan’s expression hardened. "Cassandra, watch your words."

"What’s wrong? Can’t she handle the truth?"

Evelyn laughed.

She met Cassandra’s glare. "Jealous? I heard you volunteered to supervise a certain rich, handsome client—only to get kicked out."

Cassandra’s face paled.

"You’re lying!"

"Oh? I have the housekeeper’s number. Want me to confirm?"

Enraged, Cassandra lunged to slap her. Evelyn caught her wrist and shoved her back instead.

"Evelyn Carter! How dare you?"

"You started it. And the security cameras caught everything."

Cassandra trembled with fury before whirling toward Jonathan.

"Jonathan, you saw what she did!"

He quickly pulled her into the office and shot Evelyn a look.

"Evelyn, you can leave early today."

Evelyn didn’t linger. After packing her things, she left.

Nathaniel’s words about Eleanor’s condition lingered in her mind.

At home, she mentioned it to Margaret Dawson.

Margaret sighed. "Go. Mrs. Whitmore was always kind to you these past three years."

Evelyn packed lightly—just a few clothes for the two-day stay.

Her gaze landed on the folic acid pills in the drawer. She grabbed the bottle and tossed it into her bag. Nathaniel had already seen it once; he wouldn’t question it again.

After dinner, she took a cab to the marital home.

The moment she stepped inside, her stomach dropped.

Eleanor and Beatrice Harrington sat on the couch.

Eleanor wasn’t supposed to be here yet.

Oh no.
###Chapter 77



Evelyn's heart skipped a beat when she spotted Eleanor and Beatrice lounging on the couch. Their presence was unexpectedly intimidating.

Hadn't Nathaniel assured her Eleanor wouldn’t arrive for another two days?

Content from N?velDr(a)ma.Org.

"Evelyn, darling! You're back! Come here!"

Eleanor waved at her with warm enthusiasm.

Forcing a bright smile, Evelyn slipped off her shoes and calmly handed her bag to Abigail.

Thankfully, she hadn’t brought her suitcase. Otherwise, her secret would’ve been exposed immediately.

Evelyn crossed the room with measured steps, settling beside Eleanor. When she took the older woman’s hand, she noticed how much colder it felt than before.

Nathaniel had been right—Eleanor’s health wasn’t at its best.

Eleanor squeezed Evelyn’s fingers gently. "At first, I worried you two might struggle to get along. But seeing your wedding photo in the living room put my mind at ease."

Only then did Evelyn notice the framed portrait of her and Nathaniel hanging prominently on the wall.

She stiffened for a fraction of a second, her smile turning strained.

That photo had been a petty move, meant solely to annoy Nathaniel. The wall had looked far more elegant without it.

Now, it was mocking her. The garish display made her skin crawl.

Evelyn maintained her polite smile, silently cursing Nathaniel under her breath.

Beatrice suddenly spoke up. "Have you eaten?"

The question caught Evelyn off guard.

Instinctively, she nodded. "Yes, I have."

Beatrice’s lips thinned. "Hmph. So you’ve eaten, but my son hasn’t. Is this how you care for him? Can’t even be bothered to cook?"

Eleanor intervened smoothly. "They have staff for that. No need to trouble Evelyn."

"Mother, it’s different!"

"How? You’re my daughter-in-law too, yet I never demanded you cook."

Beatrice fell silent. Evelyn ducked her head, suppressing a smirk.

As always, Eleanor was the only one who could shut Beatrice down.

While they talked, Evelyn discreetly texted Nathaniel.



"Your grandmother’s here. Get back now."

No way was she handling this alone.

Thirty minutes later, Nathaniel finally walked in.

Beatrice rushed to him. "Nathaniel, you must be exhausted. The food’s ready—eat first. Don’t worry about us."

Evelyn rose gracefully. "Sweetheart, dinner’s waiting. I’ll join you."

She followed him to the dining room, leaving Eleanor and Beatrice behind.

Once out of earshot, Evelyn exhaled sharply. "You’re unbelievable. I nearly got caught!"

Nathaniel pulled out his chair. "Grandmother isn’t easily fooled."

Evelyn eyed the spread on the table and helped herself despite having eaten earlier. Lately, her appetite had grown—probably the pregnancy’s doing.

Nathaniel glanced up. "Have you gained weight?"

Evelyn choked on her bite.

Flustered, she touched her face. "Have I?"

His gaze lingered. "Your cheeks are rounder."

She immediately set down her fork. What if she ate too much and her bump became obvious? She needed restraint.

Nathaniel smirked. "Keep eating. A little extra padding might help with that thin skin of yours."

Jerk. If he can’t say anything nice, he should just stay quiet.

She bit back the retort.

After dinner, Eleanor yawned. "Well, I’m satisfied seeing you two so happy. I won’t intrude on the newlyweds any longer. Nathaniel, work harder. I saw the crib in the guest room. I believe in you!"
###Chapter 78

Nathaniel was stunned into silence.

Evelyn rushed to assist Eleanor out of the mansion while Beatrice lingered behind, her steps deliberately slow.

Her gaze drifted to the wedding portrait hanging in the foyer, and irritation prickled beneath her skin.

"Nathaniel, I thought you'd gotten rid of her?"

"Mother, it's just for show."

"I need to contact Ms. Sinclair immediately—her brother must perform the surgery on your grandmother as soon as possible."

"Otherwise, this charade will never end."

Nathaniel didn’t move. Instead, his eyes flicked back to the wedding photo, an unreadable emotion tightening his chest.

When Evelyn returned to escort Beatrice out, she, too, paused at the portrait.

Nathaniel approached, his voice low. "I expect you to play your part flawlessly until Grandmother’s surgery is complete."

"I will. Now that she’s gone, may I leave?"

His brow furrowed. "Why the hurry? Someone waiting for you?"

"Someone very important," Evelyn replied smoothly.

Margaret had been expecting her.

Evelyn glanced at Abigail and instructed, "Put my things in the walk-in closet. That way, I won’t need to pack next time."

As she turned, Nathaniel’s voice cut in, sharp with disapproval. "Men in the entertainment industry are notoriously unreliable. Don’t be naive."

There he went again—misinterpreting her relationship with Daniel.

She arched a brow, feigning indifference. "No need to worry. He’s breathtakingly handsome."

Nathaniel sank onto the sofa, glowering as she walked away. The memory of that viral tabloid headline twisted something inside him.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the studio as usual.

To her surprise, Cassandra wasn’t there. She’d expected to meet with her today.

Moments later, the receptionist called out, "You have a visitor."

In the meeting room, Victoria sat waiting.

Evelyn sighed. "What now? Can’t you people leave me alone?"

Victoria smiled thinly. "You misunderstand. I’m not here about the house."

"Then why?"

"You know Eleanor’s health has been declining. She’s been waiting for this surgery—the one only my brother can perform successfully."

Evelyn’s expression remained cool. "Get to the point."

"It’s simple. I’ve been persuading him, but there’s one obstacle." Victoria leaned forward. "He won’t agree while you’re still married to Nathaniel. He doesn’t want me entangled in scandal."

"If you file for divorce first, my brother will operate immediately. Eleanor won’t have to suffer any longer."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. "Are you holding Eleanor’s life hostage, Victoria?"

She hadn’t expected such ruthlessness. Didn’t Victoria claim to love Nathaniel? How could she weaponize the woman he cherished most?

Victoria’s smile didn’t waver. "This isn’t a threat. It’s for Eleanor’s sake. She’s refusing treatment because of you. Her condition worsens daily. Does that not weigh on you?"

"You’re clever, Evelyn. You’ll make the right choice."

Evelyn studied her. "If I divorce Nathaniel, your brother will operate?"

"Of course. He’d do anything for me."
###Chapter 79

Evelyn gave a small nod. "Alright. I promise."

The divorce wasn't really an issue anymore. She'd already signed the papers after all.

After Victoria left the studio, Evelyn immediately tried calling Julian. But the call wouldn't connect.

What was going on?

She'd tried reaching him last night too, with no response. Not even a text back.

And now his phone was completely off.

Evelyn quickly dialed her assistant.

"Find out Julian's schedule. Is he doing another medical mission abroad with Doctors Without Borders?"

She needed him back immediately to perform the surgery. Otherwise, Evelyn knew Victoria would keep using Eleanor's condition as leverage against Nathaniel.

Meanwhile, Evelyn found herself distracted. Victoria's words kept replaying in her mind.

She kicked herself for not recording their conversation. What a missed opportunity to expose Victoria's true nature to Nathaniel.

Now there was no proof. Victoria would never admit to anything without concrete evidence.

Evelyn buried her face in her hands. Victoria's threats were working - she couldn't bear the thought of Eleanor suffering.

But Nathaniel wanted them to keep up appearances as a couple. If she brought up divorce now, he'd definitely misunderstand again.

That scheming Victoria really knew how to back her into a corner.

After agonizing over it, Evelyn finally made her decision.

She texted Nathaniel: "Are you free next Monday?"

Today was Friday. She planned to meet him at the courthouse then.

When no reply came after several minutes, she set her phone aside to focus.

The vibration startled her. She grabbed her phone eagerly - only to see a message from Julian: "Evelyn, I'm in town for business. Dinner tonight?"

Her heart sank. She checked her messages with Nathaniel again - still nothing.

Deciding to leave work early, Evelyn headed to meet Julian.

En route, she got word that Daniel was also coming - he had a photoshoot in the area. They agreed to meet at the same restaurant.

As Evelyn entered the establishment, a voice called out behind her.

"Ms. Carter?"

Turning, she found herself face-to-face with Victoria. And standing right behind her - Nathaniel. Clearly together.

Just her luck.

Evelyn kept her voice even. "What a coincidence."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. The last person he expected to see here was his wife. Was she alone or meeting someone?

Victoria immediately pounced. "Ms. Carter, this place has such romantic ambiance - perfect for couples. Are you dining alone?"

Evelyn didn't flinch.

"Of course not."

"Is that so? Why don't you join us then? The more the merrier, right Nate?"

Evelyn frowned. Had Victoria lost her mind?

Dinner together? Nathaniel, with his obsessive cleanliness and preference for solitude, would never agree.

She shot him a glance, certain he'd refuse.

"Sure," he said instead.

Evelyn's breath caught. Why would he agree to this absurd suggestion?

Confusion clouded her eyes. Were they both insane?

How could he possibly entertain this ridiculous idea?

Victoria pressed on, voice dripping with false concern. "It's really no trouble, Ms. Carter. But if you're uncomfortable or prefer other company..."

Evelyn recognized the manipulation but refused to back down.

"I'm fine with it," she said quickly.

She wouldn't give Victoria the satisfaction.

Victoria's smile widened as she looked back at Nathaniel.

"Shall we, Nate?"
###Chapter 80

Nathaniel's piercing gaze intensified as it locked onto Evelyn. There was something hauntingly familiar yet unsettlingly foreign about her presence. A storm of conflicting emotions swirled in his steel-gray eyes.

The private dining room grew thick with unspoken tension as the trio settled into their seats.

Nathaniel's phone buzzed with the notification of Evelyn's morning text. The simple question about his availability tomorrow glowed on his screen.

His reply was characteristically brief: "Yes."

Evelyn's phone illuminated the table. Thinking it might be Julian or Daniel arriving, she reached for it instinctively. Her hand hovered midair when realization struck.

Her eyes flickered toward Nathaniel across the table. Was he responding to her message now?

With practiced nonchalance, Nathaniel set his phone aside, his expression giving nothing away. The perfect picture of indifference, as if he hadn't just confirmed their meeting.

Evelyn's brows knitted in confusion. The man remained an enigma wrapped in Armani.

All she'd asked was about finalizing their divorce. Yet his demeanor suggested something far more complicated between them.

Victoria placed the menu down with deliberate grace. "Ms. Carter, where is your companion?"

"He should be here shortly." Evelyn's fingers tapped restlessly against her phone. Julian and Daniel had texted they were en route, but downtown traffic was particularly brutal tonight.

An oppressive silence settled over the table until Victoria broke it. "Nathaniel, I spoke with my brother. He's currently with Doctors Without Borders overseas, but I'll arrange for him to come to Nord City immediately."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Good."

His attention shifted to Evelyn, who seemed engrossed in her phone. The way her fingers flew across the screen suggested an urgent conversation.

Evelyn felt the weight of Victoria's not-so-subtle hint about Eleanor's surgery. But tomorrow would settle everything between her and Nathaniel once and for all.

The door swung open abruptly.

"Evelyn, apologies for the delay." Daniel Montgomery stepped through, his sculpted features flushed from rushing. The delicate pastry box in his hands released a tantalizing aroma.

Evelyn's face lit up as she rose to greet him. "No worries. Rush hour traffic is always unpredictable."

"I wasn't sure which flavor you'd prefer, so I went with their signature." Daniel presented the box with a flourish.

Evelyn's mouth watered involuntarily. Pregnancy had turned her into an absolute fiend for sweets. "How did you know I've been craving this exact cake?"

"I saw your Instagram story last week." Daniel's smile crinkled the corners of his hazel eyes.

As Evelyn accepted the gift with genuine delight, Nathaniel's jaw clenched so tightly a muscle jumped in his cheek. That man. Again.

Victoria observed the exchange with thinly veiled interest. "How... thoughtful of you."

Evelyn set the cake aside with a careless shrug. "I have six brothers. Thoughtfulness comes standard."

Daniel settled beside Evelyn, his gaze briefly locking with Nathaniel's before he deliberately focused on peeling an orange. "You need the vitamin C. It'll help with that pregnancy glow."

Evelyn's fingers absently touched her cheek. "Is my skin looking dull? I've had to cut back on most skincare products lately."

Daniel's knuckles brushed her jawline as he examined her face. "You're radiant as always."

Evelyn could feel Nathaniel's glare burning into her, but she kept her attention firmly on the citrus fruit being sectioned for her.

Daniel's presence did little to ease the stifling atmosphere. If anything, the tension grew more palpable with each passing minute.

Just as Evelyn thought the evening couldn't get more uncomfortable, her phone screen lit up. Julian must have finally arrived.
###Chapter 81

Evelyn glanced at her phone.

It was a text from Julian: "Evelyn, something urgent came up at the hospital. Go ahead and eat without me."

So he wouldn’t be joining them after all.

Julian was probably swamped with work. Saving lives always took priority over dinner plans.

Love.

She turned to Daniel. "Let’s eat."

Daniel had already seen Julian’s message in the group chat—some emergency case had come up. Honestly, he wasn’t disappointed. This meant he had Evelyn all to himself.

Soon, the food arrived.

Victoria smiled. "We should start too."

But Daniel was quicker.

He picked the largest shrimp from the platter and placed it on Evelyn’s plate.

"Try this, Evelyn. It’s fresh."

"Evelyn, the first bite is always the best."

"Are you thirsty? I’ll get you a drink."

Before long, Evelyn’s plate was piled high.

She tugged discreetly at his sleeve. "That’s enough. You should eat too."

Only then did Daniel finally stop.

"I’m not that hungry. You need it more. Look how thin you’ve gotten."

Evelyn blinked. Thin? She had definitely gained weight. Was he blind?

Nathaniel slammed his fork down, his appetite gone.

Victoria quickly intervened. "Nathaniel, try this!"

She piled food onto his plate, but Nathaniel barely glanced at it before standing abruptly.

"I have work. I’m leaving."

He couldn’t stomach another bite.

As he strode out, Victoria stared at his untouched plate, her heart sinking.

"Wait for me!" she called, rushing after him.

Once the door closed, only Evelyn and Daniel remained.

She exhaled, relieved. The tension had made it hard to swallow.

Daniel set down his utensils. "Evelyn, why were you sitting with them?"

When he’d walked in and seen Victoria and Nathaniel, he’d thought he’d entered the wrong room.

Flustered, Evelyn explained, "I used to care for Eleanor Whitmore. Nathaniel was grateful for that, so he invited me to dinner."

Daniel frowned. "Forget the Whitmores. You’re a Montgomery now, not their maid. The past is over."

"I know, Daniel."

As she nibbled her cake, her gaze lingered on Nathaniel’s empty seat before she finally looked away.

It wasn’t until late that night that Julian returned.

"Exhausted. And starving."

"Julian, we saved you some food. Just heat it up."

"You’re an angel, Evelyn."

He devoured the takeout, unfazed that it wasn’t fresh.

Daniel leaned against the counter. "Evelyn, the movers are coming tomorrow morning. Pack your valuables tonight."

"Got it."

Evelyn had already started. There wasn’t much to bring—the new house was fully furnished.

She and Margaret could move in right away.

The next morning, the movers arrived on schedule.

Evelyn sent Margaret ahead while she stayed behind to supervise.

Truthfully, Margaret hated throwing things away. Evelyn planned to clear out the clutter once she was gone.
###Chapter 82

Daniel stepped into the living room, his voice warm. "I've already arranged for Margaret to settle in. Honestly, you don't need to bring anything. The new house is fully furnished."

They had renovated the entire place just for Evelyn, ensuring she could move in without lifting a finger.

Evelyn smiled, her fingers brushing over an old vase. "I stayed behind to clear these out. Once Aunt Margaret sees the new decor, she won’t even remember these existed."

Daniel chuckled, ruffling her hair affectionately. "Come on, let’s go."

Before leaving, Evelyn paused, casting one last glance at the house. Then, without hesitation, she turned away.

The past was behind her. Her future was waiting.

Both the house and her relationship deserved a fresh start.

An hour later, the car pulled into their new neighborhood.

Evelyn stepped out, Daniel by her side, heading straight for their new home. Margaret was already inside, utterly charmed—especially by the kitchen.

That evening, they cooked together, then shared dinner over a video call with her brothers.

Nord City was a five-hour flight from Bern City. The last thing Evelyn wanted was her brothers dropping everything just for her.

The next morning, a text from Sophia lit up her phone. "Evelyn, you're trending again! Tell me honestly—is that really Harrison Sinclair?"

Evelyn clicked the link.

The headline blared: "Harrison Sinclair’s New Romance: Moving In With Mystery Woman!"

The photo showed only their backs as they entered the residential area. No faces, but Daniel’s resemblance to Harrison made it easy for fans to jump to conclusions.

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

She forwarded the link to Daniel. "Sorry, the paparazzi struck again. Could you explain this to Mr. Sinclair?"

Daniel was in Nord City for Harrison’s film shoot. Naturally, as his stunt double, he had work too.

Evelyn rested a hand on her stomach. Still flat, but soon—

She wandered through the house, admiring the furnishings but craving a personal touch. Deciding to shop for decorations, she told Margaret and hailed a cab.

At the furniture store, she barely had time to browse when a commotion caught her attention. A well-dressed man in a khaki suit led a small crowd.

Nathaniel.

Evelyn ducked into another aisle, hoping to avoid him.

But Nathaniel stopped mid-conversation, his gaze locking onto her. He excused himself and followed.

The store owner trailed behind, pitching urgently, "Mr. Whitmore, our cribs are imported, formaldehyde-free, and eco-friendly—perfect for your baby!"

Evelyn froze.

Cribs? Again?

Hadn’t she already bought one for him? How many children did he and Victoria plan to have?

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened as he approached. Without warning, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her aside.

Evelyn yanked her arm free. "What are you doing? People are watching!"

His eyes burned into hers. "Are you playing me, Evelyn?"
###Chapter 83

Evelyn was completely baffled. What on earth was Nathaniel implying?

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Why? Am I correct? You can't deny it now, can you? And here I thought you were always so quick with your clever comebacks."

Evelyn tried to wrench her wrist free, but his grip was ironclad.

Fine. If he wanted to play this game, she’d humor him.

She was past caring.

Yanking his tie, she shot back, "Mr. Whitmore, I wasn’t cheating! I never asked you out."

"Then what was that text yesterday? Or have you conveniently forgotten?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "That was different."

"Different how?" His voice was laced with venom. "Go ahead, spin another lie. The rumors are everywhere. Do you think I’m stupid?"

She tilted her head, twirling his tie around her finger. "If that’s what you believe, then there’s nothing I can say to change your mind."

Nathaniel stiffened. Those were the exact words he’d once thrown at her.

His jaw clenched. "Need I remind you that you’re still a married woman? Are you so desperate to jump into another man’s arms before the ink on our divorce papers is dry? Or do you just enjoy courting scandal?"

Evelyn smirked. "Oh, thanks for the concern. But technically, it’s only cheating if it’s two people. More than that, and it’s just… a lifestyle choice, isn’t it?"

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. "Evelyn Carter, I never knew you could be this vile."

"Because we were never meant to understand each other. So, Mr. Whitmore, are you free tomorrow? Swing by the courthouse before work, won’t you?"

His grip slackened, and he stepped back as if burned.

"Is this divorce so urgent because you’re eager to start your new life with your lover?"

Evelyn straightened, meeting his glare head-on. "I don’t owe you an explanation. Believe whatever you want."

Why bother? He’d never trust her anyway.

Nathaniel’s gaze flickered to the crib beside her. Then it hit him—the folic acid tablets she’d been taking.

His expression turned glacial.

"Are you pregnant?"

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. How did he—?

Her pulse thundered in her ears. She couldn’t speak, couldn’t breathe.

He’d made it clear before—he didn’t want children. Not with her.

And Beatrice had already declared that Victoria Sinclair was the only woman worthy of bearing his heirs.

Nathaniel’s voice was steel. "Answer me."

She swallowed hard, scrambling for words.

He closed the distance, bracing a hand against the crib, trapping her. "First the folic acid, now shopping for cribs. Did you really think I wouldn’t notice?"

Evelyn’s mind raced. So he had found the bottle she’d left at their old home.

She forced a laugh, gesturing to the display. "A client needed recommendations. And this brand’s having a sale. That’s all."

Nathaniel studied her, skepticism burning in his gaze.

"Evelyn, we may have agreed to divorce, but it’s not finalized yet. Do you have any idea what happens if you’re carrying another man’s child?"

She lifted her chin. "Enlighten me. What would you do if it were yours?"

His answer was instant. "Terminate it."

He couldn’t stomach the thought of her bearing someone else’s child while still tied to him.

Evelyn’s heart shattered, though she’d expected nothing less.

Some things never changed. To him, she’d never be good enough. Only Victoria, with her pristine lineage, deserved to be the mother of his children.

Masking her pain, she replied coolly, "Don’t worry. It’s not yours."

She’d make sure he never found out.

"It better not be." With a final scowl, he turned on his heel and stormed off.

The crowd parted as he strode past, whispers erupting in his wake. No one had seen their confrontation, but the tension was palpable.

Only Robert caught the storm in Nathaniel’s eyes and sighed.

Ever since the divorce was mentioned, Evelyn had become a master at igniting Nathaniel’s fury.
###Chapter 84



Nathaniel turned sharply, pinning Robert with an icy glare.

"Didn't I order you to investigate Harrison Sinclair? Report!"

Harrison had been getting alarmingly close to Evelyn. Had his assistant completely disregarded his instructions?

"Mr. Whitmore, he's from the Sinclair family in Nord City. Ms. Sinclair's cousin. Comes from old money—only acts because he enjoys it."

Nathaniel yanked his tie loose with a scoff.

"Men in Hollywood are all the same. Any dirt on him?"

Robert hesitated. "W-Well, no. Even the public agrees. He keeps to himself outside work. Sometimes even his agent can't track him down."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Ex-girlfriends?"

"None. Never been linked to anyone. Stays clear of tabloids despite his fame."

"The only scandal was when he escorted Mrs. Whitmore to the Fleur Design Competition. He made sure the press only photographed her from behind to protect her privacy."

Nathaniel's fingers curled into fists. "Whose payroll are you on, exactly? His?"

Robert clamped his mouth shut.

"Continue," Nathaniel bit out.

"Rumors say he bought Mrs. Whitmore's old house."

"That dump? You think Evelyn would care?" He'd offered her ten times that in the divorce.

After a beat, Nathaniel snapped, "Tell legal to fast-track the asset division."

He'd make sure Evelyn saw how pathetic Harrison's gestures were.

"Sir, the plan was to finalize the divorce first—"

Nathaniel's glare could've frozen hell. "Are you getting divorced?"

Robert swallowed. "No, Mr. Whitmore."

"Then do your job. Or should we switch positions?"

Robert didn't dare breathe. Nathaniel's temper had never been this volatile.



Evelyn watched Nathaniel's car vanish before turning to the exquisite crib beside her.

She traced its carved edges, whispering, "Sweetheart, ignore Daddy. He's being difficult. But Mommy won't let him upset us."

She'd raise this child without his interference.

As she stepped out, Penelope stormed up, face flushed with outrage.

"Evelyn Carter! How dare you cling to Harrison Sinclair's coattails for fame?"

Though most hadn't recognized the woman in those photos, Penelope had spotted Evelyn instantly.

She'd initially believed it was Harrison—until discovering it was just his body double.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Jealous? You're welcome to try."

"I have standards. Unlike gold-diggers like you."

"Oh? Then who was it who kept name-dropping the Whitmores to compensate for her mediocre acting and forgettable face? Desperate much?"

Penelope's hand flew up—only for Evelyn to catch her wrist mid-air.

"Security cameras, darling. Imagine the headlines: 'Whitmore Heiress Assaults Civilian.' How would your fans react?"

Penelope paled. "You—!"

Evelyn released her with a shove. "Run along, little girl. Grown-ups are talking."

Penelope's tantrums were tedious, but predictable.

The next morning, Evelyn's phone buzzed with an unknown number.
###Chapter 85

Evelyn hesitated for a brief moment before answering the call.

"Hello? May I ask who's speaking?"

"Good afternoon, Ms. Carter. I'm Mr. Whitmore's lawyer, and I'll be handling your divorce proceedings. Are you available to meet now?"

Lowering her eyes, Evelyn replied softly, "Yes."

She ended the call and instinctively placed a hand over her stomach. There was no reason to worry about the divorce agreement—she had already signed it without protest.

Nathaniel and she were from entirely different worlds.

Evelyn arrived at the café to meet the lawyer.

"Nice to meet you. Is there anything I need to do?"

"The divorce agreement outlines the division of assets. Mr. Whitmore has allocated three properties, a commercial storefront, a Maserati, and ten million in stocks and liquid assets to you. Please review the terms. If everything is in order, sign here, and I'll proceed with the legal formalities."

Evelyn barely glanced at the documents. She hadn’t paid attention when she first signed the agreement, nor had she noticed the staggering sum involved.

After all, Beatrice had made her sign a prenuptial agreement stating she would leave with nothing if the marriage ended.

Yet, Nathaniel had been unexpectedly generous. The properties alone were worth millions.

Evelyn pushed the papers back. "I don't want any of this."

She didn’t need his money. Accepting it would feel like charity—proof that she had married him for his wealth.

The lawyer blinked in surprise.

"Ms. Carter, are you certain? According to your prenuptial agreement, Mr. Whitmore isn’t obligated to provide you with anything. Yet he chose to. I strongly advise you to reconsider."

In his years handling divorces, he had rarely encountered someone refusing assets—unless they had ulterior motives. Most couples fought viciously over every penny.

Evelyn gave a bitter smile. "I don’t want a single thing. Tell Nathaniel I’m leaving just as I came—with nothing."

She stood to leave, only to freeze when Nathaniel’s cold voice cut through the air behind her.

"If you have something to say, say it to me directly."

Nathaniel rose from his seat, his expression unreadable. He had expected her to snatch up the assets without hesitation. Instead, she rejected them outright.

Was it not enough? Was her new lover offering more? Was his fortune insignificant compared to whatever she had now?

Evelyn hadn’t expected him to be here.

Her voice was steady. "I believe I’ve made myself clear."

He stepped closer, his tone sharp. "If you intended to leave with nothing, why sign the agreement at all? And now you’re playing the noble martyr? How exhausting."

Evelyn found his accusation ridiculous.

She met his gaze calmly. "Think whatever you want."

She turned to leave, but he caught her wrist.

"What’s wrong? Can’t defend yourself now that you’ve been caught?"

Evelyn finally snapped. "Mr. Whitmore, you keep accusing me of playing games. Where’s your proof?"

"Here."

Nathaniel pulled a small white bottle from his pocket.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

It was the folic acid bottle.
###Chapter 86

The sun cast long shadows across the hardwood floor as Evelyn paced the length of the study. Her fingers clenched around the edge of the desk, knuckles white.

She had been careless.

The bottle—the one she thought she'd lost—had somehow ended up in Nathaniel's possession.

No wonder he had asked her yesterday if she was pregnant. His sharp eyes missed nothing. He must have assumed she wanted the divorce because of it.

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

He didn’t know.

He couldn’t know.

After all, even Beatrice had mistaken her hospital visit for prenatal preparations. No one suspected the truth.

But Nathaniel wasn’t just anyone.

She swallowed hard as the door swung open.

He strode in, the familiar bottle dangling between his fingers. His gaze was dark, unreadable.

“Explain.”

Her pulse spiked.

She forced a scoff. “Who said I was preparing for pregnancy? That’s not folic acid. Just vitamins.”

His lips curled. “That’s the best you could come up with?”

“Test it if you don’t believe me.”

A beat of silence.

Then he tossed the bottle to Robert, who caught it smoothly. Nathaniel took a seat beside her, his presence suffocating.

“Fine. Let’s settle this now.”

Evelyn stiffened.

She had nowhere to run.

So she sat, chin lifted. There was nothing to fear. The pills were vitamins.

Minutes later, Robert returned.

“Mr. Whitmore, they’re vitamins. Not folic acid.”

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened.

He snatched the bottle back, eyes narrowing. “Then why the charade? Who are you trying to fool?”

Evelyn’s fingers twitched.

She yanked it from his grasp. “That’s none of your business.”

His hand shot out, gripping her wrist. “Careful, Evelyn.”

She jerked free. “Excuse me.”

She turned to leave, but he blocked her path.

“Not yet.” His voice was low, dangerous. “Why use a folic acid bottle for vitamins?”

“Because I wanted to.”

His eyes flashed.

Before she could react, she felt the edge of the table press into her back. She braced her hands against it, ready to vault over—

Then froze.

Her skirt.

The hem had ridden up dangerously high.

Nathaniel’s grip on her thigh tightened. His voice was a growl. “Get. Down.”

Her face burned. “Let go!”

His other hand caged her in. He leaned closer, breath hot against her ear. “Do you like being watched?”

She stilled.

His thumb traced circles on her bare skin, sending shivers down her spine.

Too close.

Too warm.

She couldn’t breathe.
###Chapter 87

Evelyn turned her face away, her voice barely above a whisper. "Move aside first."

Nathaniel glanced down, noticing how the tips of her ears had turned crimson. Amusement flickered in his stormy gray eyes as he released her. He leaned back against the leather booth, stretching his long legs across the narrow aisle to block her exit.

He slid the property division papers toward her. "Sign it."

Her eyes darted to the document before she shook her head. "No."

"You can have everything listed there."

"I don't want any of it!"

Nathaniel's eyebrows shot up. No one had ever refused his money before. "If you think the amount's insufficient, I can increase it."

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "That pocket change means nothing to me. I won't sign unless you hand over your entire fortune."

"You greedy little—" His jaw tightened. "Why would I ever give you everything?"

"Because I saved your life." She tilted her chin up defiantly. "I married you when you were comatose in that hospital bed. My presence is what brought you back. Isn't your life worth your entire empire?"

Nathaniel's mouth formed a thin line. "Preposterous. If that were true, we wouldn't need modern medicine."

Evelyn realized she was dealing with someone far more cunning than anticipated.

Sliding off the table, she straightened her skirt. "Your entire fortune or nothing at all. Do I look like some charity case to you?"

She knew Nathaniel already saw her as a gold-digger. Might as well play the part to perfection. Not that he'd ever agree to her outrageous demand anyway.

His eyes narrowed dangerously. "Tell me, Evelyn—did you marry me for my money?"

"How dare you!" She pressed a hand to her chest in mock offense. "I was perfectly content before you came along. This was purely an act of kindness to help accumulate your virtue. You should be thanking me for this blessing!"

Nathaniel studied the sharp-tongued woman before him. She had a way with words that both infuriated and intrigued him. "So I should be grateful?" he ground out.

Evelyn reached forward to adjust his crooked tie, her fingers brushing against his throat. "Consider me the necessary evil standing between you and your perfect future marriage. Best accept reality."

She attempted to step over his outstretched legs, but Nathaniel's arm shot out, pulling her off balance. With a gasp, she tumbled into his lap.

Evelyn's skirt rode up as she landed squarely across Nathaniel's thighs. The heat of his body seeped through the thin fabric of her dress. She could feel every defined muscle beneath her—taut, unyielding, pressing intimately against her soft curves. A flush crept up her neck as she struggled to rise.

Her sudden movement caused her forehead to collide sharply with his chin. Pain exploded through her skull as tears sprang to her eyes.

Nathaniel wasn't faring much better. He tasted blood where his teeth had cut into his lip. When Evelyn kept squirming, he gripped her waist firmly, pulling her tighter against him.

"Stop moving," he growled.

The dangerous edge in his voice made Evelyn freeze instantly. She remained motionless in his arms, her rapid heartbeat thundering against his chest.

After the initial shock faded, Evelyn gingerly rubbed her throbbing forehead. "Your chin might as well be made of steel," she muttered. "Nearly cracked my skull open."

Nathaniel leaned back with a wince, his voice rough. "Quiet."

The position grew increasingly uncomfortable—both physically and emotionally. Being this close to Nathaniel, feeling the hard planes of his body beneath hers... it did strange things to her breathing.

"May I leave now?" she asked stiffly.

Nathaniel lowered his hand, revealing an angry bruise forming on his chin. His expression darkened. "You think you can just walk away after this?"

"If you hadn't blocked my path, none of this would've happened. This is entirely your fault, Nathaniel."

"I never realized what a talented debater you are."

"Now you know," she shot back.

Evelyn desperately wanted to escape his embrace. Remaining in this compromising position while trading barbs felt... wrong. The tension between them had shifted into something far more dangerous than mere animosity.
###Chapter 88

Evelyn turned to leave, but Nathaniel's strong grip held her in place. His piercing gaze locked onto hers as he murmured, "We're not finished here."

Just as Evelyn's temper flared, Robert approached with an apologetic smile. "Mr. Whitmore, there's an urgent call for you. The phone has been ringing persistently."

Nathaniel shot Robert an icy glare. Couldn't his assistant see this was a private moment?

"Who is it?" Nathaniel demanded through clenched teeth.

"It's Ms. Sinclair."

At Robert's words, Evelyn felt Nathaniel's grip slacken. Seizing the opportunity, she slipped free from his embrace. Smoothing her dress with trembling hands, she said coolly, "I'll excuse myself so you can attend to your... appointment."

With her head held high, Evelyn strode from the café. A bitter smile touched her lips as she thought, "I need to remember my place. Our worlds could never truly intersect."

A fraction of Nathaniel's wealth could sustain an ordinary person for generations. Yet she wanted none of it.

Because Evelyn already possessed something far more valuable - Nathaniel's child growing within her.

Nathaniel glared at Robert, ignoring the ringing phone. "Who gave you permission to interrupt?"

"Sir, you instructed me to report all urgent matters immediately."

"And you consider this urgent?" Nathaniel growled.

Frustrated, he tugged at his constricting tie - a nervous habit he'd developed recently. But when he tried to loosen it, the knot refused to yield.

Looking down, he discovered Evelyn had tied an additional knot during their encounter. No matter how he struggled, the tie wouldn't come undone. He made a mental note: next time she played this trick, he wouldn't let her escape so easily.

His fingers brushed against the property settlement papers meant for Evelyn. Even now, he could recall the curve of her waist beneath his hands, a memory that refused to fade.

Robert cleared his throat nervously. "Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Sinclair mentioned it concerns Mrs. Whitmore Senior's surgical procedure."

Nathaniel snapped back to reality, accepting the phone. "Victoria," he answered tersely.

"Darling, I hope I'm not interrupting anything important," came Victoria's honeyed voice.

"Not at all. Has your brother agreed to perform my grandmother's surgery?" Nathaniel cut straight to the point.

Victoria hesitated. The truth was Julian remained unwilling, but admitting this would eliminate her leverage. "He's become more receptive recently," she lied smoothly. "Remember three years ago when I wanted to marry you during your hospitalization? My brothers prevented it because they disapproved of you."

She continued quickly, "I'll persuade him further. Perhaps we could begin with preliminary examinations for your grandmother first?"

Nathaniel's voice remained controlled. "Excellent. Make the arrangements."

"Let's discuss the details over dinner tonight," Victoria suggested, pleased with his compliance.

"Very well."

Only Julian Montgomery, among the world's elite surgeons, possessed the skill to perform Eleanor Whitmore's delicate procedure. Nathaniel would move heaven and earth to ensure his grandmother's survival.

Meanwhile, Evelyn paced her apartment, unable to shake the memory of Nathaniel's touch. A peculiar warmth spread through her abdomen - surely just pregnancy hormones, she told herself.

That night, dreams of a broad-shouldered figure haunted her sleep. When she awoke flushed and breathless, she rushed to splash cold water on her face.

Arriving at work the next morning, Evelyn checked her phone and froze. A trending entertainment headline blared: "Socialite Victoria Sinclair's Romantic Dinner with Mystery Beau - Couple Returns Home Together."

Her stomach twisted as she recalled yesterday's interrupted phone call. Against her better judgment, she clicked the link - and found herself staring at damning photographic evidence.
###Chapter 89



The photo only captured Victoria's face, leaving the mysterious man's identity concealed. But Evelyn recognized the suit Nathaniel had worn yesterday—the exact shade of his tie, the precise cut of his jacket.

There was no doubt.

The man sitting across from Victoria was Nathaniel.

So, Nathaniel had secretly met his first love last night.

Evelyn replayed the scene from the café in her mind, a bitter smirk tugging at her lips. Without hesitation, she closed the tab.

Cassandra approached, phone in hand, eager to share. "Evelyn, doesn’t this guy look familiar?"

Evelyn’s expression remained blank. "I don’t know him."

"Seriously? He looks just like that billionaire you helped last time!"

"If you're so curious, go ask him yourself," Evelyn replied flatly.

She had no patience for Cassandra, who cared more about gossip than her actual job.

Cassandra retreated, smug. She was certain it was the same man. Too bad he was already taken. If only she were a socialite—she’d have made her move by now.

Evelyn stared at her screen, her mind too scattered to sketch.

Finally, she grabbed her phone and typed a message to Nathaniel.

"Meet me at the courthouse tomorrow. 9 AM sharp. Don’t be late."

She slammed her phone down. There was no reason to delay the divorce now—not when Nathaniel and Victoria were clearly rekindling their past.

At Whitmore Enterprises, Nathaniel’s jaw clenched as he glared at his assistant.

"Who leaked this?"

"Already handled, Mr. Whitmore," Robert assured.

Nathaniel knew Evelyn had seen the post. His phone buzzed—her message. His frown deepened.

Why was she so eager to end things?

He wouldn’t let her.

"I’m busy tomorrow morning."

Just then, Victoria called, feigning distress. "Nathaniel, I’m so sorry about the photo! I had no idea paparazzi were following us. At least they didn’t get a clear shot of you. I’ll issue a statement clarifying everything."



"Don’t bother. Just make sure it doesn’t happen again."

"Of course not."

Victoria hung up, triumphant. She’d orchestrated the whole thing.

She knew Nathaniel despised invasions of privacy, so she played the concerned victim.

Penelope smirked. "Why clarify? You’re marrying him anyway."

Victoria shook her head. She knew Nathaniel better than that. This was enough to push Evelyn away.

She checked the time. Evelyn should’ve gotten the message by now.

Penelope leaned in. "When’s Eleanor’s surgery? My mother said you two should marry right after."

Victoria smiled. "Did she now?"

"Of course! You should’ve told me sooner. My brothers will definitely attend the wedding."

"Naturally. They adore me."

Her voice dripped with confidence, but unease flickered in her eyes. Julian hadn’t responded to her calls in weeks—always claiming he was abroad.

She needed him to perform Eleanor’s surgery. It was her ticket into the Whitmore family.

Lately, Nathaniel’s behavior had shifted. The way he looked at Evelyn… it unsettled her.

Evelyn had to go. Before it was too late.
###Chapter 90

"Penelope, if Nathaniel faces any issues in the future, you must inform me right away - particularly if it involves Evelyn."

"Victoria, don't worry. I won't let that street rat remain in the Whitmore family. I'll make sure you become my sister-in-law."

Victoria's lips curved into a satisfied smile. "Thank you, Penelope."

"Why thank me? Evelyn and we exist in completely different universes. That gutter trash doesn't deserve to be Nathaniel's wife. She's just some orphan who got lucky marrying into our family."

Victoria's smile deepened. Exactly. Only she was worthy of Nathaniel Whitmore.

Several days later, Evelyn unexpectedly encountered Victoria outside her design studio.

They went to the café downstairs for coffee.

Victoria cut straight to the chase. "Have you finalized the divorce with Nathaniel yet?"

Knowing exactly why Victoria had sought her out, Evelyn remained composed. "I've already texted him about finalizing our divorce."

"What was his response?"

"He said he's too busy with work to deal with it right now."

Victoria's perfectly manicured nails dug into her palm. "Evelyn, if I discover you're lying to me, you'll regret it."

Without missing a beat, Evelyn pulled out her phone and showed Victoria the message thread with Nathaniel. "See for yourself if you don't believe me. The proof is right here."

As Victoria scanned the messages, her unease grew visibly.

Evelyn pocketed her phone. "Instead of wasting energy threatening me, you'd be better off speaking to Nathaniel directly."

Victoria forced a tight smile. "I'm aware of his schedule. Nathaniel's been swamped with a major corporate merger. I'll discuss this with him soon. I trust you'll make the right choice when the time comes."

With that, Evelyn stood and left.

Victoria's mind raced as she recalled the text exchange. Why was Nathaniel delaying the divorce? Even after seeing Evelyn with another man at that restaurant?

Could Nathaniel possibly have feelings for that nobody? Impossible!

Leaving the café in a hurry, Victoria drove straight to Whitmore Corporation. She needed answers immediately.

She marched past reception and planted herself in Nathaniel's office, waiting impatiently.

Soon, Nathaniel returned from his meeting, his expression darkening when he saw her. "What are you doing here?"

Victoria glanced meaningfully at Robert. "Nathaniel, we need to talk privately."

Robert took the hint and exited, closing the door behind him.

Nathaniel checked his watch. "You have sixty seconds."

"You and Evelyn signed divorce papers ages ago. When are you making it official?"

Nathaniel's eyes turned glacial. "That's none of your concern."

Victoria's smile faltered. "Nathaniel, you know how I feel about you. I've waited three years for you."

"I never asked you to wait."

"Are you still punishing me for missing our wedding three years ago? My brothers locked me in the house that day! If I'd been there, Evelyn would never have entered your life!"

Nathaniel massaged his temples. "That's irrelevant. Stop wasting your time."

Victoria's stomach dropped as she remembered Evelyn's messages. She'd never give up on Nathaniel!

Taking a steadying breath, she played her trump card. "Nathaniel, my brother agreed to operate on your grandmother - on one condition!"
###Chapter 91

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "What's your condition?"

"Nat, you know my feelings for you. Everyone does—even my three brothers."

Victoria swallowed hard before continuing. "But Julian is furious you married someone else three years ago. He refuses to let me associate with you anymore."

She took a deep breath. "The only reason he agreed to treat your grandmother was because I begged him. I told him I love you and want to stay by your side."

Her fingers tightened around her purse strap. "Julian set a condition. He wants you to marry me. Only then will he operate on your grandmother."

Nathaniel's pen stilled in his fingers. His expression darkened as he processed her words. "Your brother doesn’t care that I’m already married?"

"He doesn’t." Victoria lifted her chin. "He only proposed this because I wouldn’t stop pleading. If you agree, he’ll perform the surgery as soon as he returns from his business trip. Your grandmother will be safe."

She studied his face, but his expression remained unreadable.

Doubt crept into her chest, but she pushed it down. She couldn’t back out now.

She refused to lose to someone like Evelyn—a nobody from the slums.

Victoria had always gotten what she wanted. This would be no different.

Silence stretched between them.

Nathaniel stood and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, his back to her.

She watched him, heart pounding. "Nat, I don’t want to force you. But your grandmother doesn’t have much time left."

She hesitated. "I know you don’t love me. We can pretend—just to convince Julian. Once the surgery is done, we can end things."

Nathaniel didn’t turn around. "I need time to think."

"Of course." She forced a smile. "I’ll leave you to it."

The moment the office door closed behind her, Victoria’s smile vanished.

If not for Evelyn’s scheming, Nathaniel would have signed the divorce papers long ago.

But she still had one last card to play.

Nathaniel had married Evelyn—a penniless nobody—to save his grandmother. She was certain he would choose his grandmother over pride.

Once they were engaged, she would make sure Evelyn never came between them again.

As the elevator descended, she dialed Julian. To her surprise, he answered.

"Julian! Finally!"

"What do you want?" His voice was clipped.

"When will you be back from your trip?"

"Unclear. Why?"

"You know why." She bit her lip. "Nathaniel’s grandmother needs surgery. She’s old, frail—you’re a doctor. Shouldn’t you save her?"

Julian’s reply was ice-cold. "No."

He would operate on anyone—except Nathaniel’s family. The Whitmores had forced Evelyn into servitude, then demanded Victoria marry Nathaniel to wake him from his coma.

He despised them.

"What do you mean, no?" Panic spiked through her. She had just promised Nathaniel that Julian would do it.

What was she supposed to tell him now?
###Chapter 92

Julian's lips thinned into a stubborn line. "I refuse to do it."

The call disconnected with finality, leaving Victoria utterly speechless.

Frustration bubbled inside her as she redialed, but Julian remained unreachable.

With a sharp exhale, she tossed her phone onto the car seat. "Why won't Julian agree? This makes no sense!"

Her chauffeur glanced in the rearview mirror. "Ms. Sinclair, perhaps he's still upset about the incident three years ago. He's trying to protect you."

Victoria's anger ebbed as realization dawned. "You might be right. My brothers never disliked the Whitmores before that night. Their protectiveness explains everything."

"Exactly, Ms. Sinclair. You're their precious sister. Your wellbeing comes first."

A small smile touched Victoria's lips. "Then I'll just have to convince him properly."

"May I suggest speaking with Mrs. Harrington instead of Eleanor? The family would support you, and Nathaniel would surely propose."

"Brilliant idea."

Victoria retrieved her phone, composing herself before dialing Beatrice. She wouldn't let Nathaniel slip through her fingers again.

When Nathaniel returned home that evening, he found his mother seated primly on the sofa. His wedding portrait with Evelyn lay discarded on the floor.

His brows knitted together. "Mother, what's the meaning of this?"

"That photograph doesn't belong here. Nathaniel, we need to discuss your grandmother's surgery. Victoria explained everything. You've always been devoted to Eleanor - why hesitate now?"

Beatrice's voice turned sharp. "Divorce Evelyn immediately and propose to Victoria. Her brother will then perform the surgery. Two problems solved at once."

Nathaniel sank onto the couch, exhaustion lining his features. "Mother, Grandmother isn't easily deceived. If she discovers the divorce, she'll refuse treatment."

"Then we simply won't tell her. At her age, she'll never know unless someone tells her."

"That someone being Evelyn. Who knew she'd become so manipulative? Threatening us like this-"

"Evelyn would never."

Nathaniel knew better - she'd already messaged him days ago to finalize their divorce properly.

"Stop defending her! How can you tolerate her affair? End this farce immediately."

"My marriage is my concern."

"But Eleanor doesn't have time for your indecision! Think carefully about what I've said."

Beatrice rose abruptly, addressing Abigail. "Dispose of this at once."

The maid moved slowly, waiting until Beatrice departed before hesitating. "Mr. Whitmore... shall I really discard it?"

"Store it in the basement."

Nathaniel retrieved his phone, initiating a video call to his grandmother.

Eleanor answered immediately, rocking gently in her chair. "Nathaniel, what's happening between you and Evelyn?"

The question caught him completely off guard.
###Chapter 93

Nathaniel didn’t understand why his grandmother had suddenly brought this up. The question caught him off guard, leaving him momentarily speechless.

Eleanor’s tone was light, almost teasing. "I just had a video call with Evelyn. She’s still at the studio. Why didn’t you pick her up on your way home?"

Nathaniel exhaled, keeping his voice steady. "I’ll go get her now."

"You should hurry. The roads are busy this time of night. Take her to dinner somewhere nearby before heading back."

"Grandmother, how have you been?"

"I’m perfectly fine," she huffed. "If you and Evelyn would just give me a great-grandchild, I’d live another twenty years. Now stop dawdling and go fetch her. You’re irritating me just standing there!"

The call ended abruptly.

Nathaniel blinked at his phone, but a small smile tugged at his lips. At least her sharp temper meant she was in good health.

He checked his watch—later than he’d realized. Was Evelyn still working?

Grabbing his coat, he strode out the door.

At the studio, Evelyn sat hunched over her computer, fine-tuning a design.

The client had been particularly demanding. The initial draft wasn’t enough, and they needed revisions immediately—their renovation timeline couldn’t wait.

The office was silent, empty except for her.

"Evelyn? Still here?"

She turned to see Jonathan stepping inside. "Jonathan? What are you doing here?"

"Forgot some files. Didn’t expect to see you burning the midnight oil."

She smirked. "I take my work seriously. Once school starts, I won’t have this kind of time anymore."

Jonathan leaned against her desk, arms crossed. "I’ve got some things to wrap up too. We can leave together when you’re done."

Evelyn nodded absently, her focus already back on her screen.

An hour later, she finally sent off the final draft and stretched, her neck stiff.

Her stomach growled loudly.

She placed a hand over her abdomen, whispering, "Sorry, little one. Mommy’s going to feed us soon."

Jonathan appeared beside her, resting a hand on the back of her chair. "Finished?"

"Yeah. Let’s go."

She stood quickly, putting space between them.

Jonathan didn’t react, simply pulling back as they headed for the elevator.

"Congratulations on going back to school, Evelyn. If you ever need help—with anything—just ask."

She smiled politely. "Thanks, but I’m managing fine."

"I mean it. You don’t have to handle everything alone. I’m your senior, after all."

Her smile tightened. "That’s kind of you. No wonder your studio has such a good reputation—you really look out for your team."

Jonathan caught the subtle deflection and chuckled. "It’s late. Let me drive you home."

"No need. I’ll grab a cab."

"You just praised my leadership. If I let you take a cab alone this late, what would people say?" He smirked. "Wait here. I’ll pull the car around."

Evelyn sighed but relented.

As she stood outside, a sleek black Maybach rolled into view.

For a second, her breath hitched—it looked just like Nathaniel’s car. But he wouldn’t be here now, would he?

Before she could dwell on it, Jonathan’s car pulled up beside her.

"Evelyn," he called. "Get in."
###Chapter 94

Evelyn spotted the sleek Maybach gliding toward her, its polished exterior gleaming under the streetlights. It rolled to a smooth stop beside her, and her pulse quickened when she glimpsed the shadowy figure behind the tinted glass.

The silhouette was unmistakable.

Her breath hitched.

"Evelyn, what's caught your attention?" Jonathan stepped out of his modest sedan and approached her, his gaze flickering toward the luxury car with poorly concealed envy.

He forced a smile. "Do you like that car? Once my business takes off, I'll get one just like it. Maybe I'll take you for a ride someday."

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably, unsure how to respond.

Just then, the Maybach's window slid down, revealing Nathaniel's sharp profile. His voice was cool. "Get in."

Her instincts had been right—it was him. But why was he here? There was no way he'd come for her willingly.

Jonathan frowned. "Evelyn, do you know this guy?"

She swallowed hard. "Jonathan, you should head home first."

He hesitated, eyeing Nathaniel warily. "Are you sure you're safe with him? I can drive you instead."

Nathaniel stepped out of the car in one fluid motion, his icy stare pinning Jonathan in place. "Grandmother sent me to pick her up."

Ah. That explained it. Evelyn had video-called Eleanor earlier while working late. The older woman must have noticed her exhaustion and ordered Nathaniel to fetch her.

Evelyn offered Jonathan an apologetic smile. "Thanks, but I have a ride already."

Jonathan nodded stiffly. "Take care, then."

As his car disappeared down the street, Nathaniel's lips curled. "That's the kind of man you're interested in? A guy who drives a tin can?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Not your concern."

"What happened? Did that actor already dump you? Moving on so quickly?"

She shot him a saccharine smile. "Oh, I'm just keeping my options open. If one doesn't work out, there's always another."

Without waiting for a response, she climbed into the passenger seat and rolled down the window. "Drive me home. Thanks."

Nathaniel leaned against the car door, looming over her. "I'm not your personal driver."

"Then why are you here?"

"Because Grandmother ordered me."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Exactly. So stop complaining and drive."

Lately, she'd been distant, and Nathaniel found himself missing the days when she was sweet and pliant.

He wasn't about to let her win. "You drive."

"Really? With my skills, we might not make it home alive."

Nathaniel scoffed but slid into the driver's seat. The engine roared to life, and he accelerated sharply, the city lights blurring past.

Evelyn gripped the seat. "Are you trying to kill us?"

"Relax. You'll survive."

Exhaustion soon overtook her, and she drifted off. When she stirred, she found Nathaniel's face inches from hers, his breath warm against her skin.

Her eyes flew open.

What was he doing? Trying to steal a kiss while she slept?
###Chapter 95

Evelyn's breath caught as Nathaniel's striking features came into focus. Her eyes lingered on his perfectly sculpted lips, pressed together in that familiar tight line.

The space between them vanished until she could feel his breath mingling with hers.

Her hands flew up instinctively, connecting with his cheek in a sharp slap that echoed through the car's interior. The air thickened with tension.

Evelyn gaped at her own palm, words tumbling out in a flustered rush. "I didn't realize you were that close! It was an accident—"

Her explanation died as Nathaniel's mouth crashed onto hers.

Every muscle in her body locked. Had Nathaniel Whitmore actually kissed her?

His lips felt cool yet impossibly soft, like the finest silk against her skin.

She forgot how to breathe.

When Nathaniel finally pulled away, his voice came out rough. "Do you always forget to breathe during a kiss?"

Evelyn gulped air like a drowning woman surfacing. Heat flooded her cheeks. "Not all of us have your... extensive experience."

The thought struck her suddenly - he must have practiced those skills with Victoria. Disgust twisted her stomach.

She wiped her mouth with deliberate slowness, as if erasing any trace of him. The idea of sharing lips that had touched Victoria's made her skin crawl.

Nathaniel seized her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "You didn't enjoy that?"

"I wasn't the one who started it."

"You're the first woman brave enough to strike me." His thumb brushed her lower lip. "Consider this kiss a privilege."

"Should I curtsy in gratitude?"

As Evelyn struggled free, movement at the gate caught her eye. A painfully familiar silhouette stood watching them.

"Your visitor's here," she murmured.

Nathaniel turned to see Victoria waiting at the entrance. His expression darkened instantly as he released Evelyn and straightened.

While adjusting her rumpled clothes, Evelyn finally recognized their location. "Why did you bring me to the marital home?"

"To remind you where you belong." His voice turned icy. "Don't forget your position."

Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Aren't you worried I'll interfere with your reunion with your precious Victoria?"

Nathaniel exited without answering, his frown deepening at Victoria's unexpected appearance.

Victoria's face twisted with barely concealed rage. She hadn't anticipated catching them in such intimacy.

Evelyn strode past the fuming woman without breaking pace. "Ms. Sinclair, isn't it rather... unseemly for a single woman to lurk outside a married couple's home at this hour?"

Victoria's eyes flashed with venom, but Evelyn had already swept inside, refusing to glance back at the pair.

The master bedroom remained untouched since her departure. Against her better judgment, she drifted to the window just in time to see Nathaniel's car disappearing down the drive with Victoria.

A bitter smile touched her lips as she yanked the curtains shut.

Her fingertips rose to trace her swollen mouth, still tingling from Nathaniel's assault. With a shuddering breath, she pressed both hands to her flushed face.

The truth burned through her defenses - Nathaniel still held power over her emotions. Just when she'd resolved to erase him from her heart, he'd shattered her resolve with a single kiss.

At least he'd left with Victoria.

Perhaps this was for the best.

Turning sharply, Evelyn moved to the guest suite, summoning Abigail to prepare it for the night. The marital bed held too many ghosts.
###Chapter 96

Evelyn refused to sleep in the master suite. The thought of Victoria possibly having shared that bed with Nathaniel made her skin crawl.

Morning light filtered through the curtains as Evelyn descended the staircase. Abigail had laid out an elaborate breakfast spread with all her favorite dishes.

Her eyes immediately darted to the empty space above the fireplace where their wedding portrait used to hang. A sharp pang shot through her chest, though she quickly rationalized its absence. What use was a marriage photo for a relationship that existed in name only?

The clink of fine china interrupted her thoughts. Nathaniel strode into the dining room impeccably dressed in a tailored navy suit that accentuated his broad shoulders. He took the seat directly opposite her without a word.

Evelyn's fork hovered mid-air. She hadn't anticipated his presence - shouldn't he be with Victoria? Her gaze inadvertently dropped to his lips, triggering memories of last night's unexpected kiss. Heat flooded her cheeks as she looked away.

The silence stretched between them, broken only by the sound of Evelyn devouring two bowls of oatmeal and three sandwiches.

"Since when did you develop such an appetite?" Nathaniel's deep voice cut through the quiet.

Evelyn dabbed her mouth with a linen napkin. "That's none of your concern."

His piercing gaze studied her face. "Your cheeks have filled out."

"Have they?" Her hand flew to her face in surprise. She hadn't noticed the subtle changes, though her clothes did feel slightly tighter lately.

Nathaniel leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable. "Careful. Men don't appreciate women who let themselves go."

"Is that so?" She arched an eyebrow. "Perhaps some prefer a woman with curves."

"Doubtful."

"One can dream," she countered, reaching for her phone to respond to Eleanor's message: "Finished every bite, Grandma! Make sure you eat well too."

She caught Nathaniel watching her with an inscrutable expression. "Problem?"

"You're quite skilled at charming my grandmother."

"I simply want to reassure her." Evelyn pushed back her chair. "She worries enough as it is."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Her condition worsens daily."

"I know." She met his gaze squarely. "The surgery can't wait much longer."

As she turned to leave, Nathaniel's voice stopped her. "Would you do anything to ensure she gets that operation?"

Evelyn froze, then slowly turned. "Name your terms."

A shadow crossed Nathaniel's face. He'd yet to discuss specifics with Victoria after last night's interrupted conversation. She'd mentioned Julian's condition - the surgery in exchange for their divorce.

"I'll inform you shortly," he said tersely.

Evelyn nodded and exited without another word, her mind whirling with possibilities. She needed space to think, deciding to take the afternoon off.

The apartment was quiet when she arrived. Julian lay sprawled across the sofa in his scrubs, clearly having just returned from the hospital. Evelyn quietly draped a blanket over him.

Julian stirred instantly. "Evie? You're home early." He rubbed his eyes. "These overnight shifts aren't good for you."

She didn't correct his assumption that she'd been working. Margaret must have told him she was pulling extra hours at the office. "I'll rest now," she murmured.

"Good." He stretched with a yawn. "We'll have a proper lunch later."

Evelyn nodded absently, her attention caught by Julian's vibrating phone. "You're getting a call."

"I've got it." Julian waited until Evelyn disappeared into her bedroom before answering. "Victoria? What is it?"

Her voice came through urgent and strained. "Julian, we need to talk. It's about the surgery."
###Chapter 97



Julian Montgomery's brow furrowed as he surveyed the bedroom. Without another glance, he strode to the balcony to answer his phone.

The moment the call connected, his voice was sharp. "If this is about the Whitmore family, save your breath."

"Julian!" Victoria Sinclair's voice trembled with desperation. "I love Nathaniel. I want to marry him."

Julian scoffed. "Nathaniel is already married. Do you really want to be the other woman in his relationship with Evelyn?"

"Julian, I told you—he’s going to divorce her. Their marriage was never about love. She’s just some nobody from the slums. She doesn’t belong in the Whitmore family!"

A muscle in Julian’s jaw twitched. "Funny. Weren’t you adopted from an orphanage too?"

Victoria’s face drained of color. "That’s different. I’m legally a Montgomery now. Julian, you’ve always taken care of me. Just help me this once."

Rubbing his temples, Julian exhaled sharply. "I’ll help you with anything—except this. Stay away from the Whitmores."

He couldn’t forgive them for what they’d done to Evelyn. If Victoria married into that family, the constant interactions would only give them more chances to belittle her. And he wouldn’t allow that.

Not now that he knew the truth.

Besides, what was so special about Nathaniel? The man was already married.

Without waiting for another plea, Julian ended the call.

—

On the other end, Victoria’s grip on her phone turned white-knuckled.

How dare Julian compare her to Evelyn?

Fury burned through her. She hurled a vase against the wall, shattering it into pieces. Only when the room was in ruins did her breathing steady.

Her assistant hesitated before speaking. "If Mr. Montgomery refuses to perform the surgery… what will you tell Mr. Whitmore?"

Victoria’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Nathaniel won’t find out. I’ll make Julian agree—one way or another. If I have to, I’ll bring Eleanor into this. He won’t say no to her."

But Eleanor was her last resort. She couldn’t risk her brothers seeing through her manipulations. Not when she’d spent years crafting the perfect image.

Her phone buzzed again.

The assistant glanced at the screen. "It’s Mrs. Whitmore."

Victoria’s demeanor shifted instantly. "Hello, Mrs. Whitmore," she cooed.

"Victoria, darling! I’ve booked appointments at the finest bridal boutiques. We must find you the perfect gown for your engagement to Nathaniel!"

"Of course, Mrs. Whitmore. I’ll be there soon."

The moment the call ended, Victoria’s mask slipped.

She would see this through—no matter what.

Julian would agree.

He had to.

—

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter received her university’s notice to return for the new semester. She packed her belongings, ready to move out.

Cassandra Blake smirked. "You’re an award-winning designer. Half the industry wants to hire you. Why go back to school?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Education matters."

Cassandra rolled her eyes. "By the time you graduate, those offers might be gone—especially if our studio expands."
###Chapter 98



Evelyn remained composed as she spoke, "This is my decision. Thank you for your concern."

"I wasn’t concerned about you," Cassandra replied.

Cassandra turned and noticed Penelope had arrived. She immediately greeted her with a bright smile. "Ms. Whitmore, you’re finally here. The design you requested is ready."

Penelope strode in with an air of arrogance, her designer handbag swinging at her side. Her gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Did you get fired?"

Evelyn ignored her.

Cassandra quickly intervened. "She’s planning to return to university to continue her studies. You know she took a two-year break, right?"

Penelope smirked. Of course she knew—it had been her aunt who’d forced Evelyn to leave school, all to keep her tied to the Whitmore household, tending to family duties and, ideally, bearing Nathaniel’s heir.

She examined her freshly manicured nails. "Even with a degree, a woman like her would only land menial jobs. Why waste two years studying? She should start working now and earn some real money."

Evelyn set down the files in her hands and met Penelope’s gaze. "Are you suggesting I should be as uneducated as you?"

Penelope’s face twisted in outrage. "Excuse me?"

"I meant exactly what I said. If you don’t understand, maybe you should revisit elementary school. Even children grasp basic logic."

Penelope blinked, momentarily stunned. As Evelyn walked away, she turned to Cassandra. "Was that an insult?"

Cassandra gave an awkward nod. "Yes, it was."

After packing her belongings, Evelyn received a call from Jonathan.

"You left so abruptly. Are you really not coming back?" he asked.

"Not permanently. I just need time to prepare for my entrance exams."

"Fair enough. Just remember to come in on weekends. I’ve compiled study materials for you—check your email."

"Thank you."

Hanging up, Evelyn dove into exam preparations. Two years away from academia meant she’d missed crucial tests. Now, she’d be taking them alongside freshmen. Passing was her only ticket back.

That afternoon, a call from the Whitmore household shattered her focus. "Mrs. Whitmore, something terrible has happened—"



Evelyn’s mind went blank. She grabbed her bag and bolted for the hospital where Eleanor was being treated.

Please let her be okay.

The private hospital was crowded when she arrived.

Nathaniel stood at the forefront, his broad shoulders slumped in despair. Evelyn knew how much Eleanor meant to him.

Penelope sneered at the sight of her. "What are you doing here?"

The moment she spoke, every head turned—except Nathaniel’s.

Evelyn approached him. "Grandmother Eleanor has always been kind to me. It’s only right that I’m here."

Ignoring the hostile stares, she stood beside Nathaniel. "What happened? Why did she collapse?"
###Chapter 99



Nathaniel stared at the flickering surgical lights, his voice icy. "The cause remains undetermined."

Evelyn's stomach twisted as she recalled Nathaniel mentioning Eleanor's declining health.

She clenched her fists. "When can we schedule the operation? Why the delay?"

Nathaniel's face darkened. "Are you questioning my judgment? Grandmother has refused treatment for months. You know exactly why."

"Isn't there another way?" Evelyn pressed.

His lips curled into a mocking smile. "What solution do you propose? Should we try conceiving an heir?"

Evelyn's hands instinctively moved to her abdomen, her silence speaking volumes.

She debated revealing her pregnancy to Eleanor. If only the stubborn woman would consent to surgery...

Beatrice cut in sharply. "Don't fantasize, Evelyn. You'll never carry the Whitmore heir."

Penelope nodded viciously. "She's clearly manipulated Grandmother's condition to trap Nathaniel. How calculating."

Evelyn's bitter laugh echoed in the sterile hallway. She fixed her gaze on the operating theater's glowing sign.

Nathaniel tugged at his collar. "Nothing to say for yourself?"

"What would satisfy you?" Evelyn's voice cracked. "If I agree, I'm scheming. If I refuse, I'm heartless. There's no winning with you people."

Her sharp tone made Nathaniel stiffen.

Penelope shrank back at his thunderous expression.

The operating light turned green. The surgeon emerged, and Evelyn rushed forward. "How is she?"

"Critical. We must operate immediately."

When they wheeled Eleanor out, the frail woman depended on a ventilator. Evelyn's vision blurred with tears.

Three years ago, when she'd had nothing, Eleanor had been her only kindness.



In the private ward, the Whitmore family hovered anxiously.

Nathaniel's command sliced through the tension. "Everyone out. She needs rest."

Beatrice ushered relatives away while Evelyn remained at Eleanor's bedside.

The moment Eleanor stirred, her papery hand grasped Evelyn's. "Please," Evelyn begged, tears falling. "Have the surgery."

Eleanor's weak headshake crushed Evelyn's hope. Should she confess her pregnancy?

Nathaniel's heavy hand landed on Evelyn's shoulder. "Rest now, Grandmother. We'll return later."

As Eleanor's eyelids fluttered closed, Evelyn fled the room, her heart breaking. She wiped her tears, one hand cradling her stomach. This required careful consideration.

Nathaniel watched her retreat with glacial detachment.

Beatrice seized his arm. "Divorce that gold-digger before Eleanor wakes. Once the surgery's done, it won't matter what the old woman thinks."
###Chapter 100

Nathaniel's face remained impassive as he stated, "I won't lie to Grandmother Eleanor."

He turned sharply to his assistant. "Have you located the specialist we discussed?"

"Yes, sir. We've secured the top surgeon in this field. They've agreed to operate on Mrs. Whitmore immediately."

"Good. Make all necessary arrangements at once." His voice carried the weight of finality.

Penelope and Victoria exchanged uneasy glances. Penelope finally spoke up. "Nathaniel, didn't you promise Victoria's brother would perform the surgery? He's supposedly the best in this specialty."

"I can't afford to wait." His response was clipped. Nathaniel never gambled on uncertain outcomes.

Penelope sensed trouble brewing. If plans changed, what would become of Victoria? She needed to warn her immediately.

After a restless night, Evelyn woke with her hand resting protectively on her rounded belly. The decision weighed heavily on her.

She reached for her phone and dialed Andrew.

He answered on the first ring. "Evelyn? Everything alright? Need financial help?"

Despite her turmoil, she chuckled at his predictable question. "Actually, I need legal advice."

"Shoot."

"I have this friend..." Evelyn hesitated before continuing. "She's finalizing her divorce after years of marriage. Just discovered she's pregnant but doesn't want her husband's family to know. She wants to raise the child alone."

"Simple enough. Post-divorce, maternal custody is standard unless contested. The father would have no automatic rights."

Evelyn exhaled slightly. "What if the family finds out before the divorce is finalized and tries to claim custody? How could she fight back?"

Andrew's tone turned serious. "Evelyn, how close is this 'friend'?"

"Close enough."

"Then tell her she's got the best damn lawyer in the city. I'll guarantee her custody, no matter who opposes it."

"Thank you. I'll... let her know." She ended the call, but the reassurance did little to calm her nerves. Battling the Whitmore dynasty's legal team would be like fighting a hurricane with a paper umbrella.

Yet Evelyn couldn't stand by while Eleanor suffered.

That afternoon, she marched into the hospital with renewed determination.

The elevator doors opened to reveal Nathaniel and Victoria standing dangerously close, their bodies nearly touching.

Evelyn froze, then announced loudly, "I seem to have terrible timing."

Nathaniel stiffened at her voice, putting immediate distance between himself and Victoria.

Victoria turned with a smirk. "Don't worry. There's nothing between us anymore."

Evelyn's chest constricted. Every instinct screamed to leave, but Eleanor's condition anchored her in place. She advanced toward them.

"When is Grandmother Eleanor's surgery scheduled?" Evelyn demanded, locking eyes with Victoria.

Victoria feigned innocence. "These things take time. Soon, if everything goes smoothly."

The unspoken condition hung in the air between them.

Evelyn turned to Nathaniel, her voice steady. "Let's finalize the divorce today."
###Chapter 101

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "Do you honestly think divorce is the answer?"

Evelyn lifted her chin defiantly. "I plan to persuade Grandma to have the surgery."

His piercing gaze locked onto hers. "And how exactly do you intend to accomplish that?"

She hesitated for a fraction of a second. "That's none of your business."

Just then, the hospital door swung open, revealing Victoria Hawthorne. "Ms. Carter, Mrs. Whitmore requests your presence—both yours and Mr. Whitmore's. She has matters to discuss."

Victoria Sinclair, hovering nearby, interjected with a hopeful smile. "I came to visit Mrs. Whitmore as well."

Victoria Hawthorne shifted uncomfortably. "I'm afraid Mrs. Whitmore has no desire to see you."

Victoria Sinclair's face hardened with resentment as Nathaniel followed Evelyn into the room.

Evelyn could feel the weight of Victoria's venomous stare burning into her back, but she refused to let it distract her.

She approached Eleanor's bedside, gently taking her frail hands. "Grandma, how are you feeling today?" Her voice was soft with concern.

Eleanor chuckled weakly, though her pallor betrayed her condition. "I may be ill, but I'm not knocking on death's door just yet."

Nathaniel, however, remained stern. "Grandma, I've scheduled your surgery for next week."

Eleanor's resolve was unshakable. "I've told you—I won't go through with it!"

"Not unless I live to see my great-grandchild," she declared. "Without that hope, what's the point?"

Nathaniel's patience snapped. "Are you seriously using your health to manipulate me?"

Eleanor met his glare without flinching. "Call it what you will."

Guilt twisted in Evelyn's chest as she watched Eleanor's frail form. She knew the truth—Eleanor feared that if the surgery failed, Evelyn would be left unprotected.

Yet Evelyn had made her choice. She was ending this marriage, directly opposing Eleanor's deepest wish.

Growing up an orphan, Evelyn had known little kindness until Margaret Dawson took her in.

For the past three years, Eleanor had treated her like family. Now, seeing her health deteriorate, Evelyn couldn't bear it.

The surgery couldn't wait any longer.

In a decisive moment, Evelyn placed Eleanor's hand gently on her abdomen. "Grandma... I'm pregnant."

Silence crashed over the room.

Nathaniel stared at her, disbelief etched across his face as his gaze dropped to her stomach.

Eleanor's eyes widened, her lips parting in shock. "Is it true?"

Evelyn nodded, a soft smile touching her lips. "Yes. It's still early—we only just found out."

"Wonderful!" Eleanor's face lit up. "I knew something was off when you were queasy last week, but you both denied it!"

Seeing Eleanor's joy, Evelyn felt a weight lift from her shoulders. The older woman's spirits were visibly brighter.

Eleanor immediately motioned for Victoria Hawthorne to bring a chair. "You young people know nothing about pregnancy. Victoria will help guide you through everything."

"Grandma, it's really not that serious—"

"Nonsense! This time, you'll listen to me."

Evelyn didn't argue further. Throughout the exchange, she avoided Nathaniel's gaze, knowing his stance on children.

But the lie sat heavy in her chest.

Suddenly, Beatrice Harrington swept into the room with Victoria Sinclair in tow. "Mother, Victoria came all this way to see you. She's brought specialties from Nord City!"
###Chapter 102

Evelyn followed closely behind Beatrice, her lips tightening when she spotted Victoria already seated in the hospital waiting area.

Though Evelyn noticed Victoria's assessing stare, the weight of her current situation left no room to dwell on petty judgments.

"Get up, Evelyn!" Beatrice commanded sharply. "We can't have Ms. Sinclair standing while you're sitting. She's our honored guest."

As Evelyn started to rise, Eleanor's frail hand restrained her, but Nathaniel's quiet murmur came like a shield. "Stay seated. It's fine."

Beatrice immediately protested, "Nathaniel, what's the matter? Can't Evelyn stand for a moment? Ms. Sinclair went through the trouble of—"

Victoria smoothly interjected with practiced grace, "It's perfectly alright, Mrs. Whitmore. I don't mind standing."

Eleanor's voice carried unexpected steel. "Evelyn is with child. She should remain seated."

The announcement landed like a grenade in the sterile hospital corridor.

Victoria's perfect smile froze mid-curve.

Beatrice gaped at Evelyn, disbelief coloring her tone. "That's impossible. How could this happen so suddenly?"

Eleanor's protective instincts flared. "What exactly are you suggesting? Shouldn't we be celebrating Evelyn's pregnancy?"

A cold dread settled in Beatrice's stomach as she realized Evelyn's supposed condition could shatter Victoria's carefully laid plans with Nathaniel.

Nathaniel's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Enough. Grandmother needs her rest. Let's continue this outside."

Eleanor waved them off with surprising cheer. "Nathaniel, take care of Evelyn and my future great-grandchild." Her wrinkled face softened. "Don't fuss over me—just schedule the surgery. I intend to watch that baby grow up."

The relief that washed over Evelyn at Eleanor's consent was nearly palpable.

As the group exited the room, the air thickened with unspoken tensions.

Ignoring the others, Evelyn made straight for the elevator, desperate for escape.

Beatrice seized Nathaniel's arm, her hissed words meant for his ears alone. "I warned you about getting her pregnant! Couldn't you have taken precautions?"

Faced with his mother's bluntness, Nathaniel's jaw twitched. "Mother, this is my personal matter."

"It's not just about you anymore!" Beatrice shot back. "With Evelyn pregnant, consider how the Sinclairs will react. Their daughter won't easily accept being second choice."

Beatrice had envisioned Victoria's aristocratic connections elevating their family. Now that dream teetered on the brink.



As the elevator doors slid open, Victoria's sharp command rang out: "Wait!"

Before Evelyn could react, Victoria descended the stairs in three quick strides and seized her wrist with surprising strength. "This pregnancy is a lie, isn't it?"

Doubt still clouded Victoria's piercing gaze.

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, Nathaniel emerged from the elevator. Panicked, Evelyn wrenched her arm free, demanding, "Let go of me!"

Victoria's peripheral vision caught Nathaniel's approach.

A calculated coldness entered her eyes as she suddenly released her grip and threw herself backward, artfully creating the illusion that Evelyn had pushed her.

As the force of Victoria's release sent her stumbling, Evelyn instinctively cradled her stomach, her face draining of color.

Victoria's eyes immediately sought Nathaniel, welling with manufactured tears. "Nathaniel, help me!"

Simultaneously, Evelyn's gaze found his, silently pleading for belief.
###Chapter 103

A spark of hope ignited in Evelyn's weary eyes.

Nathaniel took in her disheveled state—the way her slender frame trembled slightly, the shadows beneath her deep hazel eyes betraying exhaustion and unspoken longing.

For just a moment, his usual cold demeanor wavered.

Before she could stumble, his hand shot out, fingers wrapping firmly around her wrist to steady her.

Evelyn had braced for impact, certain Nathaniel would side with Victoria in their confrontation.

Yet this time, to her shock, he stood firmly beside her.

She blinked up at him, pulse racing with disbelief. Relief warred with lingering dread as she thought of what might have happened—not just to her, but to the fragile life growing within her.

"Nat!" Victoria's voice cut through the tension, sharp with wounded pride.

Evelyn turned to see Victoria still sprawled on the hospital floor, eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

She hadn't expected Nathaniel to walk past Victoria's dramatic display to reach her instead.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing Beatrice's hurried approach.

"Ms. Sinclair!" The older woman gasped, rushing to Victoria's side. "How did this happen? You must be more careful!"

Victoria allowed herself to be helped up, casting a meaningful glance toward Evelyn. "We were discussing... pregnancy matters when we both slipped. The floor was wet."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. The implication was clear—Victoria was planting seeds of doubt about the incident.

The girl truly was a master of playing the victim while orchestrating chaos.

Beatrice's accusing finger jabbed toward Evelyn. "You couldn't warn her? This is exactly the carelessness I'd expect from you! What if something serious had happened?"

Evelyn remained impassive, long accustomed to her mother-in-law's venom.

She stepped out of Nathaniel's hold with deliberate calm. "I don't make a habit of looking out for mistresses."

After all, it had been Victoria who'd grabbed her, staging this entire farce.

Without another word, Evelyn turned and walked away.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed as her warmth left his arms.

Beatrice seized the moment. "See how she acts? Pregnancy has made her unbearably arrogant! This is the real Evelyn Carter."

Victoria bit her lip, shaken that Nathaniel had chosen Evelyn over her. Clearly, the only reason was that unborn heir.

She couldn't stay silent. "Nathaniel, I only asked about Ms. Carter's pregnancy, but she seemed... evasive. I worry she might not be entirely truthful."

Her voice took on a saccharine tone. "While I'd never wish harm on your child, deception is unacceptable, don't you think?"

Beatrice gasped dramatically. "I knew it! That girl could never conceive so suddenly—she's lying!"

The possibility visibly relieved her.

Nathaniel remained silent, jaw clenched. Truthfully, he too questioned the validity of Evelyn's claim.

Victoria adopted a saintly expression. "Though if Mrs. Whitmore did say she'd consent to the surgery if Evelyn's truly pregnant... Perhaps she meant well. We shouldn't judge her too harshly."

Without responding, Nathaniel strode away.

Victoria moved to follow, but her twisted ankle—a genuine injury from her staged fall—made her wince.

Frustration burned in her gaze as she watched him leave. This wasn't how things were supposed to go.

Outside, Evelyn stood amidst the hospital's bustling traffic, emotions in turmoil.

Revealing her pregnancy had been necessary after seeing Eleanor's deteriorating condition.

But facing Nathaniel with this truth?

That was a battle she wasn't ready to fight.
###Chapter 104

"What if Nathaniel demands I end the pregnancy?" Evelyn's thoughts raced as she paced nervously.

A sudden honk shattered her reverie.

The sleek black Maybach pulled up beside her, its tinted windows hiding the occupant within.

She'd recognize that car anywhere - Nathaniel Whitmore's signature vehicle.

Through the partially lowered window, she caught a glimpse of his chiseled profile, his piercing gray eyes watching her with unnerving intensity.

"Get in." His command brooked no argument.

Evelyn hesitated only a moment before complying, aware of curious onlookers nearby.

The moment the door closed, she felt trapped in a soundproof cocoon with this dangerous man.

Perched on the edge of the leather seat, Evelyn couldn't escape the intoxicating scent of his cologne mixed with something uniquely Nathaniel.

Her fingers twisted in her lap as she waited for the axe to fall.

After an eternity, his voice cut through the silence like a blade. "Do you like children?"

Evelyn's throat constricted. "I... yes, I suppose I do."

This unexpected life growing inside her had awakened instincts she never knew she possessed.

Having grown up rootless, the idea of family resonated deeply with her abandoned heart.

Nathaniel's prolonged silence made her pulse race.

Finally, she blurted, "You don't need to worry. This child won't interfere with your life."

She'd already resolved to raise the baby alone, far from Nathaniel's world and his impending marriage to Victoria.

His head turned slowly, those stormy eyes assessing her. "Do you honestly think a child could affect me?"

The casual cruelty in his words made her flinch. "Message received."

"See that you do," he countered coldly.

Adjusting his cufflinks, Nathaniel continued, "After Grandmother's surgery, we'll stage a miscarriage."

Evelyn went deathly pale. "What did you say?"

Her hands flew protectively to her stomach.

Had she heard correctly? Was he really suggesting...?

His voice turned glacial. "What alternative do we have? Should we magically produce a child?"

"Or perhaps you'd prefer we try conceiving one tonight to satisfy Grandmother's expectations?" he added with biting sarcasm.

Understanding dawned - he thought she'd lied about the pregnancy to manipulate Eleanor.

In an odd way, this misconception relieved her. At least he wasn't actually demanding an abortion.

Nathaniel's gaze pinned her in place. "Evelyn, disabuse yourself of any fantasies. This child isn't happening."

He clearly believed she'd fabricated the pregnancy to take advantage of Eleanor's condition.

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "I understand perfectly."

Little did he know, she had no intention of telling him the truth about their baby either.

The remainder of the ride passed in suffocating silence.

When the car stopped, Evelyn recognized their marital home - a gilded cage she'd escaped months ago.

"You'll maintain this charade until Grandmother recovers," Nathaniel stated as the engine idled. "No mistakes."

Evelyn nodded stiffly. "Of course."

With university resuming soon, she could explain her absence to her brothers easily enough.

She just needed to play her part until Eleanor's surgery was complete.

Looking up, she asked, "Now that Eleanor's agreed, when is the procedure scheduled?"

"Given your... connection to the Sinclair family, arranging Victoria's medical team shouldn't be difficult, right?"

She couldn't help wondering what new scheme Nathaniel and Victoria might be concocting involving Eleanor.

"The surgery's scheduled for next week," Nathaniel replied tersely.

"Good," Evelyn breathed, genuine relief coloring her tone.

As she reached for the door handle, Nathaniel's voice stopped her. "Do you know how to convincingly play..."
###Chapter 105

Why did Nathaniel need reassurance about her ability to convincingly play the role of a pregnant woman?

Evelyn pondered for a moment, wondering why deception was even necessary.

Given that she was actually pregnant, wouldn’t this be the most authentic performance of her life?

With a quiet laugh, she turned to him. "Do I really need to act at this point?"

"You’re right," Nathaniel conceded, his voice smooth. "You’ve always been a natural. Don’t overcomplicate it. Victoria will be here to guide you, making sure no one suspects a thing."

"Mr. Whitmore," Evelyn said firmly, "I’ll play my part flawlessly. But you should focus on scheduling that surgery."

She had no intention of confronting Victoria Sinclair herself. That was Nathaniel’s responsibility.

Evelyn knew Victoria too well—she would put on her sweet, innocent act the moment Nathaniel was near.

Which meant there would be no delays. No excuses.

Stepping out of the car, Evelyn entered the grand foyer, Nathaniel close behind, his expression unreadable.

Victoria Hawthorne stood waiting in the living room, her smile warm. "Mrs. Whitmore, I’ve arranged a menu suitable for expectant mothers. If you need anything at all, just say the word."

"Actually," Evelyn said, "there is something."

Her fingers brushed lightly over her stomach. "Should we get a fetal heart monitor? Just to check on the baby?"

Truthfully, she had no idea what she was doing.

She’d spent hours scrolling through pregnancy forums, reading about the importance of monitoring the baby’s heartbeat.

The articles warned that missing even the slightest irregularity could be dangerous.

With no one to guide her—especially since she hadn’t told Margaret yet—Evelyn felt completely out of her depth.

But if she was going to play this role, she might as well learn.

Victoria nodded. "Of course, Mrs. Whitmore. I’ve already prepared one. We can test it now."

She hesitated. "Though if it’s still early, we might not hear anything yet. But don’t worry—I’ve also brought Dr. Reynolds for a full checkup."

Nathaniel cut in sharply. "That won’t be necessary."

Victoria blinked in surprise.

Evelyn quickly smoothed things over. "What Nathaniel means is, unless there’s a real concern, we shouldn’t overdo it. I’m sure everything is fine."

Victoria nodded, though her gaze lingered on Nathaniel for a moment before she excused herself.

Once alone, Evelyn sank onto the sofa, eyeing the fetal heart monitor with curiosity.

Nathaniel’s voice was low, edged with warning. "You almost gave us away. What if the monitor doesn’t pick up a heartbeat? What if the doctor realizes something’s off?"

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "Relax. I’ll make sure nothing seems unusual. Besides, we only have to keep this up for another week."

Her dark eyes held his. "Once the surgery is done, the act is over, right?"

Nathaniel adjusted his tie, his expression unreadable. "Discretion is key."

As he walked away, Evelyn’s fingers curled protectively over her stomach.

"Don’t listen to him, sweetheart," she whispered. "Mommy loves you more than anything."

Dinner was a lavish affair—every dish meticulously prepared, every flavor designed to tempt a pregnant woman’s palate.

Victoria hovered nearby. "Mrs. Whitmore, we know cravings can change daily. Let us know your favorites, and we’ll make sure they’re always available."

Evelyn surveyed the feast before her, marveling at the privileges wealth afforded.

She picked up her fork, savoring each bite like royalty.

For now, at least, she could indulge in the fantasy.
###Chapter 106

Some dishes were placed too far away, escaping Evelyn's notice at first.

Then Nathaniel's utensils appeared before her. He scooped portions onto her plate, his movements precise.

Pausing, he said calmly, "Thank you, darling. But don’t forget to eat as well."

A mischievous glint in her eye, Evelyn deliberately served him a dish she knew he disliked.

Nathaniel glanced at his plate, then set his fork down without a word.

Victoria, observing their exchange, nodded approvingly, already planning her report to Eleanor later.

After finishing her meal, Evelyn rubbed her stomach with a sigh. "I might have overdone it."

"Mr. Whitmore," Victoria suggested, "perhaps you could accompany Mrs. Whitmore on a walk? It’s good for expectant mothers."

Evelyn hesitated. "I think I’ll pass."

Solitude sounded far more appealing than Nathaniel’s company.

Beside her, his voice remained steady. "Very well."

Forcing a smile, Evelyn added, "I can manage alone."

Nathaniel’s arm slid around her shoulders, his tone persuasive. "Walking is beneficial. Shall we?"

Reluctantly, she followed him outside. The summer evening was cool, the sky scattered with stars, casting a serene glow over their path.

Their shadows stretched and merged as they walked.

Guilt prickled at Evelyn. She had pulled Nathaniel away from his work, wasting his precious time.

To break the silence, she remarked, "You don’t have to force yourself to accompany me. It feels insincere."

Nathaniel countered, "Grandmother specifically instructed Victoria to oversee things. Whether genuine or not, we must keep up appearances."

How had Evelyn forgotten his talent for acting?

Suddenly, a large dog burst from the bushes, startling her.

Instinctively, Nathaniel pulled her close, shielding her in his arms.

Clutching his shirt, Evelyn gasped, "Oh god, a dog!"

A faint smirk tugged at his lips as he noted her unease.

Peering cautiously over his shoulder, she whispered, "Has it left?"

Nathaniel glanced back. "Not yet."

The dog wagged its tail enthusiastically, clearly fond of Evelyn.

Still pressed against him, she muttered, "What do we do now?"

Locking eyes with the dog, Nathaniel commanded, "Sit."

Immediately, it obeyed, displaying perfect discipline.

Evelyn stared in surprise. "It listened to you."

With a playful grin, he teased, "So, dogs frighten you?"

"Yes," she admitted. "At the orphanage, the director’s dog bit me once. After that, it chased me whenever it could."

"I was always on edge but never spoke up."

Sensing the conversation growing too personal, Evelyn quickly changed the subject.

Given Nathaniel’s privileged upbringing, she doubted he could truly understand her past struggles.

"Have you ever been vaccinated?" he asked suddenly.

Shaking her head, she replied, "Survival was the priority back then. Vaccines were a luxury. Thankfully, I’ve been fine without them."

After a pause, Nathaniel said, "If there haven’t been complications, you should be alright."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "I didn’t expect such reassurance from you."

He turned, his gaze intense. "Then, what kind of man do you see me as?"
###Chapter 107

Evelyn hadn't expected Nathaniel to circle back to this question, and the weight of it pressed down on her, making it harder to breathe, let alone respond.

Nathaniel watched her struggle with thinly veiled amusement. "Cat got your tongue?" he taunted, his voice laced with that infuriating calm.

"Not exactly," Evelyn shot back, meeting his gaze head-on. "Would you prefer the truth or a pretty lie?"

His expression darkened slightly. "Perhaps silence would serve you better," he replied coolly before turning away.

As Evelyn took a step forward, a sudden movement caught her eye—a large dog stood beside her, tail wagging eagerly as it stared up at her.

She froze, her breath hitching. Instinctively, she took a step back. "Stay," she whispered, her voice trembling.

Though she bore no ill will toward the animal, an old, buried fear surged within her as the dog inched closer.

"Here, boy."

Just as Evelyn contemplated bolting, Nathaniel—who had vanished into the shadows moments ago—reappeared like some dark knight.

Beneath the golden glow of the streetlamp, he extended his hand toward her.

At the sight of Nathaniel, the dog immediately sat, its tail thumping gently against the pavement.

"The dog is sitting. Walk to me, Evelyn."

"I—I can't!" she stammered, her legs refusing to cooperate.

"You have ten seconds," Nathaniel commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn gritted her teeth. Why couldn’t he just come to her?

But she knew Nathaniel well enough—when he said ten seconds, he meant it.

Gathering every ounce of courage she had, Evelyn sprinted toward him, her heart pounding wildly.

Nathaniel’s gaze softened as she hurled herself into his arms. A faint smirk tugged at his lips—some wounds needed time, not force, to heal.

Suddenly, she was pressed against him, her fingers clutching his shirt.

Nathaniel remained still, his once-outstretched hand now resting lightly against her back before tightening just slightly.

"Is it gone?" Evelyn asked, her voice muffled against his chest.

"It’s gone," he confirmed.

Evelyn finally dared to glance back, relief flooding her when she saw the dog had disappeared. "I was terrified," she admitted.

As they passed the spot where the dog had been, a shiver ran down her spine. What if it lunged at her from the shadows?

From above, Nathaniel’s voice cut through her panic. "How much longer do you plan to cling to me?"

Evelyn stiffened, then quickly stepped back. "Sorry. Reflex," she muttered, cheeks burning.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Consider that your one free pass."

Evelyn scowled. "I’m carrying your child, Nathaniel. Would you really abandon me if a dog chased me? Should I tell Eleanor about your lack of chivalry?"

"You’re more intimidating than that dog. You could’ve scared it off yourself—especially since you’re not actually pregnant."

"Who says I’m not—" She caught herself. "My point is, if we’re putting on a show, let’s make it convincing."

She bit her tongue, realizing she’d almost slipped.

Acting required finesse, and she couldn’t afford missteps.

Walking behind him, she noticed his shadow stretching beneath the streetlamp. With a mischievous grin, she deliberately stepped on it.

Nathaniel didn’t miss it. "Really, Evelyn? Petty revenge?"

"I have no idea what you’re talking about," she lied, feigning innocence.

"Don’t play dumb."

"You’ve been watching me that closely? How flattering," she drawled.

Nathaniel glanced away. "You’re getting reckless."

"If I weren’t reckless, would I have ever ended up in your bed?"

The words slipped out before she could stop them.

Evelyn’s face flamed. "I—I should check what Victoria made for dinner," she blurted, speeding ahead of him.

Nathaniel exhaled, an unreadable flicker in his eyes.

Evelyn rushed into the living room, then straight to the kitchen, desperate to escape the awkwardness.

After lingering there longer than necessary, she returned to find Nathaniel gone.

A pang of regret hit her. That slip-up had been mortifying.
###Chapter 108

Evelyn returned to the master bedroom upstairs, noticing Nathaniel still hadn't come back. She assumed he must be occupied in his study.

This had become their routine - him spending nights working while she slept alone.

Stepping into the walk-in closet, she observed that aside from Nathaniel's small section, the space was dominated by her own wardrobe.

Surprisingly, everything remained exactly as she'd left it.

Expecting to find Victoria's belongings, Evelyn carefully searched every corner but found no trace of another woman's presence.

This discovery puzzled her deeply.

Leaning against the closet door, she frowned. She knew this space intimately - nothing could escape her notice.

Yet there were absolutely no signs of Victoria.

Remembering Abigail's comment about Victoria never staying over, Evelyn wondered if Nathaniel might actually have some moral boundaries.

She caught herself thinking about him again.

Grabbing a silk pajama set, she hurried to the shower.

The luxurious sleepwear laid out for her had been carefully selected by the household staff, with seasonal undergarments specially chosen.

When they'd signed the divorce papers, Evelyn had taken only her personal clothes, leaving all the designer items behind.

Emerging from the shower, she wore a delicate lace camisole with a matching robe draped over her shoulders.

There were definite advantages to indulging in fine things.

After drying her hair, she stepped out yawning - only to freeze when she saw Nathaniel standing by the window, his tall frame silhouetted against the moonlight.

Her yawn died mid-breath.

Nathaniel's presence in their bedroom was unexpected and confusing. It made no sense to Evelyn.

Turning, Nathaniel's gaze fell upon Evelyn in her revealing nightwear.

Her dark tresses cascaded down her back, a few strands clinging to her collarbone.

His eyes trailed downward, his expression darkening noticeably.

He hadn't anticipated this sight. With a smirk, he remarked, "Dressing so provocatively on purpose?"

Evelyn quickly tightened her robe.

Blushing furiously, she retorted, "You always sleep in the study. What are you doing here so early?"

"Don't worry," Nathaniel reassured, "You're supposedly pregnant now. Victoria specifically warned me not to... disturb you during this time."

"So you're staying here tonight?"

Approaching her, Nathaniel's gaze lingered on her now-secured robe.

Ironically, the thin fabric only accentuated her curves, providing little actual coverage.

After a moment, Nathaniel suddenly felt uncomfortable, his throat oddly dry.

He looked away. "Rest assured, I'm not that reckless."

With that casual remark, he headed to the bathroom.

Only after hearing the shower running did Evelyn realize Nathaniel had been teasing her with her own words from earlier.

She'd never expected him to remember and throw her joke back at her!

Grabbing an extra blanket from the closet, she spread it neatly on the far side of the bed.

Settling in, Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, hoping to avoid any awkwardness when Nathaniel returned.

Despite her exhaustion, she remained acutely aware of every sound from the bathroom.

When the water stopped, Nathaniel emerged moments later.

Seeing Evelyn curled in a tight ball, his expression shifted. He poured himself a glass of cold water, drinking it in one gulp to calm his rising frustration.

Nathaniel settled on his side of the bed, pulling the blanket tightly around him.

Having Evelyn so close was unusual, and he expected discomfort.

Yet surprisingly, it wasn't as unpleasant as he'd imagined.

Evelyn too had assumed she wouldn't sleep well beside him. But exhaustion soon claimed her.

The next morning, Nathaniel's ringing phone startled Evelyn awake. Half-asleep, she kicked out irritably, mumbling, "So annoying."

Nathaniel found her foot draped over his waist. He gripped her ankle gently to still her movements.

Answering the phone, he growled, "This better be important."

"Mr. Whitmore, there's a problem. The surgeon we arranged for Mrs. Whitmore Senior's operation has encountered complications and can't proceed."
###Chapter 109

Nathaniel shot upright, his voice turning icy. "What's wrong?"

Despite securing the best surgeon for Eleanor's operation with meticulous care, they had expected everything to go smoothly upon arrival.

"Bad news, sir. The doctor was in a car accident and is currently receiving treatment at the hospital."

"I'm on my way." Nathaniel threw off the covers and strode to the closet, pulling out his clothes with sharp movements.

The call had woken Evelyn beside him. Hearing the tension in Nathaniel's voice, she wondered if something urgent had come up at work.

Within minutes, Nathaniel emerged from the closet, fully dressed, his expression grim.

Rubbing her sleepy eyes, Evelyn murmured, "Is everything okay?"

After a brief hesitation, he replied, "Nothing serious."

Without elaborating about the doctor, he left swiftly.

At the hospital, Robert was waiting outside the emergency room.

"Mr. Whitmore, the doctor isn't in critical condition, but his right hand is fractured. It's unclear when he'll be able to operate again," Robert reported.

Nathaniel's face paled. "Why now, of all times?"

"Our investigation shows a reckless driver ran a red light and crashed into the doctor's car."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Find another surgeon."

No matter what, Eleanor's surgery would proceed as planned.

After Nathaniel left, Evelyn dozed off again. Lately, she found herself craving extra sleep.

When she woke, she stretched and headed downstairs. "Victoria, what's for lunch?"

A faint hunger tugged at her.

Victoria had prepared an elaborate spread, making Evelyn feel pampered. The attention to detail made her feel cherished.

Evelyn absently touched her stomach, recalling all the advice Victoria had shared about pregnancy.

She took it seriously—this wasn’t just about her, but the little life growing inside her.

That evening, Nathaniel returned to find Evelyn on a yoga mat, watching a prenatal breathing tutorial. His gaze lingered as he observed her.

Evelyn had been diligently practicing, convinced these techniques would help during labor.

When she turned and caught him watching, she froze briefly before resuming her exercises, focusing intently on the screen.

Victoria approached with a smile. "Mr. Whitmore, if you have time, you should join Mrs. Whitmore. Prenatal education is important from the start."

Evelyn quickly interjected, "Victoria, he’s busy. We can cover this later."

Without a word, Nathaniel turned and went upstairs.

After dinner, Evelyn sat alone in bed, flipping through a prenatal care book.

Nathaniel entered and picked it up, skimming the pages. With a hint of sarcasm, he remarked, "Quite the dedicated performance."

Keeping her tone light, Evelyn replied, "Well, if I’m going to commit to a role, I might as well do it convincingly, right?"

He set the book down and headed to the bathroom.

Evelyn exhaled softly, closing the book.

Why should she feel guilty? Nathaniel had no reason to suspect anything yet.

Even if she told him now, he’d probably dismiss it as another act.

Her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.

Evelyn glanced at the screen—Victoria Sinclair’s name flashed brightly.

She looked away, uninterested in whatever connection Nathaniel and Victoria still shared.

As the sound of running water stopped, Evelyn quickly pulled the covers up and pretended to sleep.

Nathaniel emerged in a loose robe, frowning at the missed call on his phone. He made no move to return it.
###Chapter 110



Just then, Nathaniel's phone buzzed with a WhatsApp notification from Victoria.

After reading the message, he quickly exited the bedroom.

Hearing the door close, Evelyn opened her eyes slowly, a wry smile playing on her lips.

She placed a protective hand over her abdomen, steadied her breathing, and drifted back to sleep.

The following morning, Evelyn returned to her family home to pack for university.

Margaret grasped Evelyn's hand with concern. "Must you really live on campus? I could prepare your favorite meals every day if you stayed."

"Aunt Margaret, I'm not a child anymore. I can take care of myself," Evelyn insisted firmly.

Her decision to stay on campus was final.

If Margaret discovered she was actually staying at the Whitmore estate, she'd worry endlessly and might accidentally reveal it to Evelyn's brothers.

Evelyn wanted no complications, especially with Eleanor's surgery scheduled in just seven days.

Once she survived this week's charade, true freedom would be hers.

As Evelyn lifted her suitcase, Julian entered the room. Seeing her luggage, realization dawned on him.

"Evelyn, why didn't you tell us today was move-in day? We would have loved to accompany you," he exclaimed.

"Julian, everyone's so busy with their own lives. I didn't want to be a burden," Evelyn explained.

"Nothing is more important than family. Let me drive you."

Evelyn noticed the dark shadows beneath Julian's eyes - clear evidence of sleepless nights spent performing surgeries.

Knowing refusal was pointless, she decided to leave early so Julian could return home and rest.

They departed together.

During the drive, Julian's phone vibrated repeatedly. Evelyn glimpsed the caller ID displaying "Victoria Sinclair" before he silenced it.

"Julian, you've been working too hard lately," Evelyn remarked from the passenger seat.

"When am I not?" he replied, eyes fixed on the road.

"Focus on your studies. Don't worry about finances or work," Julian advised.



"I understand," Evelyn nodded. "I've got a part-time job at the studio that covers my expenses."

Julian sighed quietly. His sister's independence often made him feel unnecessary.

Soon they arrived at Halvard University.

Turning to Julian, Evelyn said earnestly, "I'll be fine. You look exhausted - go home and rest."

Relenting, Julian replied, "Only if you accept the Venmo transfer I'm sending. Consider it a university gift."

Evelyn's phone pinged with notifications - allowances from all six brothers. With a resigned smile, she said, "Alright, thank you."

"Go ahead. I'll watch you enter."

As Evelyn walked toward campus, Julian pulled out his phone and typed in their family group chat: "Our little sister's officially a university student now."

His attention shifted to multiple WhatsApp notifications from Victoria.

"Julian, I heard you left your Doctors Without Borders assignment. Where are you now?"

"Can we meet? We need to talk."

Julian frowned at the messages and typed his reply: "Some things are better left unsaid."

Victoria stared at her phone, deeply troubled by his response.

N?velDrama.Org exclusive content.

It made no sense to her. Julian performed free surgeries for strangers yet refused to operate on Eleanor. She suspected he harbored some secret resentment against her.

His attitude had clearly changed, but the reason remained a mystery Victoria couldn't solve.
###Chapter 111

Victoria clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. "Julian is deliberately evading me." The words came out through gritted teeth.

With Eleanor Whitmore's surgery date approaching fast, how could she negotiate with Nathaniel if his elusive brother wouldn't even show his face? Julian's cooperation was her only leverage.

"Ms. Sinclair, I regret to inform you that the specialist Nathaniel arranged is no longer available," Gregory reported with a solemn expression.

"Your brother remains our sole viable option, but we must proceed with caution," he added carefully.

Victoria's frustration boiled over. "How can I stay calm? You saw what happened at the hospital! Nathaniel chose to save Evelyn instead. And now he's refusing my terms while secretly finding another surgeon for Eleanor!" Her voice trembled with barely contained rage.

The situation was spiraling out of control, especially with Nathaniel's growing attachment to Evelyn. Victoria felt the ground shifting beneath her feet.

"Ms. Sinclair, as long as Nathaniel needs something from you, the game isn't over," Gregory offered cautiously.

"You're right. But he hasn't come to me yet," Victoria admitted, her fingers drumming nervously against the table.

Overcome with anxiety about Nathaniel's next move, she snapped orders. "Double the search efforts. Find Julian immediately."

Gregory hesitated before responding. "I contacted my Red Cross connection. There's no record of Julian being there at all."

Locating Julian and securing his agreement to perform Eleanor's surgery had become Victoria's singular focus. That would be her winning card.

Meanwhile, Evelyn wheeled her suitcase through the university gates, her heart swelling at the familiar sights. The campus looked exactly as she remembered, yet somehow different after all these years.

"Evelyn! Welcome back!" Sophia came running, nearly knocking Evelyn over with an enthusiastic hug. "Do you know how much I missed you when you left?"

Evelyn smiled wistfully. "Life happens. But I'm grateful to be back now."

"Fantastic! Let me show you to your dorm, then we'll grab lunch. Everyone's dying to see you - especially Professor Hartwell!" Sophia chattered excitedly.

After settling in, Evelyn joined Sophia to reconnect with old classmates. Though returning to school filled her with joy, she couldn't ignore the bittersweet reality - while she'd been away, her peers were preparing to graduate.

"Evelyn, I must say I'm jealous," came a familiar sharp voice. Cassandra leaned against the cafeteria table with a mocking smile. "Even after dropping out, you still won first prize at the Fleur competition. Some of us have been grinding for three years without recognition. Professor Hartwell won't stop gushing about you in the group chat."

An uncomfortable silence fell over the table.

Evelyn met Cassandra's gaze evenly. "I only took leave because of family financial difficulties. That prize money is the only reason I can afford to return. I've always admired all of you."

Sophia quickly intervened, whispering to Evelyn, "Don't mind her. She's just bitter."

Evelyn shrugged it off. Compared to the privilege of continuing her education, petty jealousy meant nothing.

After lunch, Professor Hartwell pulled Evelyn aside. "Winning the Fleur competition brings great honor to our department. There's an awards ceremony next week - I've secured you a spot. Plus, there's a generous grant that should ease your financial burden."

"Thank you, Professor," Evelyn said sincerely. The grant would be a lifeline given her current situation.

Their meal stretched into late afternoon when Evelyn's phone buzzed. Nathaniel's message appeared: "Where are you?"

Pausing, Evelyn typed back carefully: "Having dinner off-campus with friends. Will return later."

She pocketed her phone, certain Nathaniel's sudden interest stemmed from Victoria Hawthorne's watchful eyes. He'd never cared about her whereabouts before.

Her response gave Nathaniel plausible deniability if he came to pick her up - nothing to arouse Victoria's suspicions.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn said her goodbyes and prepared to face whatever awaited her back at the Whitmore estate.
###Chapter 112

Evelyn emerged from the restaurant, her gaze immediately drawn to the polished chrome finish of a Bentley Continental parked along the curb. A faint spark of expectation lit in her chest - had Nathaniel arrived already?

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn turned to Sophia. "Go ahead with the others. I need to use the ladies' room before we leave."

Doubling back into the establishment, Evelyn concealed herself near the hostess stand for nearly fifteen minutes. She waited until she was certain most of her classmates had departed before making her exit.

Her phone vibrated abruptly.

Answering, Nathaniel's rich baritone filled her ear. "Come outside."

"I'm coming," Evelyn responded.

Stepping through the restaurant doors with deliberate nonchalance, Evelyn noted the absence of her peers. She quickened her pace toward the waiting luxury vehicle, slipping inside with practiced ease.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Since when do college reunions involve social obligations?" he questioned sharply.

Evelyn adjusted the strap of her purse. "It was just a casual dinner with former classmates after lectures. Hardly a formal engagement," she countered smoothly.

The drive home passed in weighted silence, the tension between them thickening with each passing mile.

As anticipated, Victoria Hawthorne hovered near the entrance when they arrived. Nathaniel showed no particular interest in Evelyn's whereabouts or activities - his indifference as palpable as ever.

In the following days, Evelyn maintained her rigorous academic schedule with military precision. Between lectures and study sessions, she barely had time to breathe, let alone dwell on personal matters.

While buried in research materials at the library, Evelyn's phone buzzed with Elizabeth's reminder. "Don't forget about the awards ceremony this afternoon."

"I've got it marked," Evelyn assured her.

Prudently, she set multiple phone alarms to ensure she wouldn't miss the important event.

En route to the auditorium, Cassandra Ellington materialized before her, eyes gleaming with malicious intent. "Evelyn," she purred, "I know your little secret."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. Their relationship had always been fraught, and time had done nothing to improve it.

"That luxury car that picked you up last week near the bistro," Cassandra pressed. "Who was that distinguished older gentleman?"

A flicker of tension crossed Evelyn's features.

Despite her precautions, she hadn't anticipated such scrutiny of her movements.

Cassandra's smirk widened. "Let's be honest, Evelyn. Did you really leave school because of family financial troubles?" Her voice dripped with faux concern. "Or was it something more... lucrative with your wealthy benefactor?"

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "After all this time, you're still the same petty gossip, Cassandra. No wonder people talk about you the way they do."

"What are you implying?" Cassandra hissed. "Explain yourself!"

Ignoring the outburst, Evelyn strode confidently into the auditorium where she found her name elegantly calligraphed on a reserved seat.

Returning to this academic environment felt surreal, like stepping into an alternate reality.

As she surveyed the venue, Theodore Winslow entered with his entourage.

Among them stood Nathaniel, his tailored navy suit accentuating his commanding presence.

Evelyn's breath caught - seeing him on campus was the last thing she'd expected.

The world truly worked in mysterious ways.

Taking her place among the honorees, Evelyn noticed a starstruck student beside her whisper, "You're Evelyn Carter, aren't you? The Evelyn Carter?"

With modest grace, Evelyn demurred, "I'm just a student like everyone else."

"Could I please get your autograph?" another admirer begged.

Soon, Evelyn found herself surrounded by a cluster of eager students, their attention momentarily distracting her from the proceedings.

Nathaniel's sharp gaze found Evelyn amidst the crowd.

He hadn't realized she commanded such admiration on campus.

His attention shifted to the young man seated beside Evelyn, noting how attentively he fetched her water and snapped photographs. An unfamiliar tightness formed in Nathaniel's chest.

Noticing Nathaniel's focus, Theodore interjected, "Mr. Whitmore, that young woman took first prize in the Fleur International Design Competition. Would you care to meet her?"
###Chapter 113

Evelyn's stomach twisted into knots as Theodore's words hung in the air.

She flicked a nervous glance toward Nathaniel, her eyes silently begging for reassurance.

Nathaniel merely shrugged. "It's fine."

Relief flooded Evelyn's veins as she watched Theodore guide Nathaniel to his seat.

Nathaniel occupied the front row—a position reserved for VIPs.

Evelyn frowned. Why would Nathaniel, with his packed schedule, attend something like this?

The answer revealed itself soon enough.

As Evelyn stepped onto the stage, Nathaniel—the anonymous benefactor behind the scholarship—rose to personally present the awards.

Her breath caught at the sight of him. Impeccably dressed, exuding effortless elegance.

Certificate in hand, he gave her a patronizing once-over. "Don't disappoint me."

Evelyn forced a smile as she accepted it, fingers itching to crumple the paper in his face.

The ceremony ended abruptly. Evelyn bolted from the lecture hall without looking back.

If she moved fast enough, she could avoid whatever Theodore had planned next—probably some awkward dinner introduction.

No thanks.

Right on cue, her phone buzzed with Elizabeth's call as she neared the library. She ignored it.

Hours later, Evelyn finally returned the call. "Sorry, my phone was on silent during study hours."

Elizabeth sighed. "Mr. Winslow wanted you to join dinner with our special guest. Too late now."

Evelyn exhaled. Another bullet dodged.

After hanging up, she left campus and headed to the penthouse.

Nathaniel lounged on the sofa in sweatpants, absorbed in his tablet.

He glanced up. "You're busier than a CEO."

Evelyn tightened her grip on her textbook. "Early bird catches the worm."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Stay out of my business."

Evelyn walked away without another word.

As long as Sebastian could handle Eleanor's surgery, she wouldn't let Nathaniel rattle her.

Alone, Nathaniel scrolled through Robert's text: "Still searching for a qualified surgeon."

He rubbed his temples, exhaustion lining his face.

The next morning, campus felt off. Evelyn noticed the sideways glances, the hushed whispers.

Then Sophia sent the forum link: "Scholarship Winner Exposed: Nepotism or Favoritism?"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. The post accused her of buying her award, complete with a photo of her entering a luxury car.

Thankfully, Nathaniel's face wasn't visible.

Evelyn texted Sophia back: "I know exactly who did this."

Yesterday, Cassandra had cornered her, smugly hinting at knowing Evelyn's "secrets."

Typical Cassandra—climbing the social ladder by pushing others down.

Elizabeth called after class. "Mr. Winslow wants this investigated. Draft a statement."

Without hesitation, Evelyn dialed Sebastian. He answered instantly. "Evelyn? What's wrong?"

"Can you trace an IP address for me?"

Sebastian's voice turned serious. "Explain everything first."

Evelyn forwarded the link. "I need to find whoever's spreading these lies."

Sebastian's anger flared. No one slandered his sister and got away with it.

"Give me ten minutes," he growled. "Go get coffee."
###Chapter 114

The call disconnected, and within moments, Evelyn's phone chimed with a notification—a Starbucks gift card from Sebastian.

Her lips twisted into a bittersweet smile. Pregnancy meant no more indulging in her favorite caramel macchiatos.

Ten minutes later, the information Sebastian had promised arrived. Just as she suspected, the IP address traced back to Cassandra Ellington.

Sebastian's voice was firm through the phone. "Do you want me to expose her?"

Evelyn's reply was immediate. "No. I'll handle this myself."

The college forum had exploded with gossip, turning her into the center of campus scandal.

With no afternoon classes, Evelyn made her way straight to the studio.

Jonathan stepped out of his office the moment she sat down. "Evelyn, I heard about the forum. Remember—truth always wins in the end."

"I know," she answered calmly.

Now that she knew who was behind it, Evelyn already had a plan forming.

Meanwhile, Cassandra Blake wasted no time forwarding the forum link to Penelope, shooting her a frosty glare.

Penelope, ever the opportunist, immediately showed Beatrice. "Aunt Beatrice, look. Evelyn is causing another scene at college."

Beatrice's lips curled in irritation. "That girl thrives on drama."

Fuming, she stormed into Nathaniel Whitmore's office at Whitmore Enterprises.

"Nathaniel, look at this!" she snapped, shoving her phone toward him. "Evelyn is embroiled in another scandal. There are photos of her with some man. If this spreads, imagine the damage to our family's reputation!"

Nathaniel frowned, scanning the forum headlines. But as his eyes landed on the photo, his expression eased. "Mother, these are just baseless rumors."

Beatrice scoffed. "Baseless? Have you seen that picture?"

Nathaniel's reply was steady. "I have. That's my car."

For a long moment, Beatrice was speechless. Finally, she managed, "Are you serious?"

"Completely," he confirmed.

Straightening her blazer, Beatrice huffed. "Regardless, Evelyn has a talent for stirring trouble at the worst possible times."

She narrowed her eyes. "Speaking of timing—that doctor you hired had an accident. Have you considered speeding up the divorce?"

Nathaniel's voice remained calm. "Mother, I know what I'm doing."

With a frustrated sigh, Beatrice stormed out.

Outside, she snapped at her assistant. "Contact Theodore Winslow. Evelyn's scholarship should be revoked. Someone who causes this much trouble doesn't deserve our family's support."

She couldn't help but wonder—would Nathaniel be so passive if it weren't for Evelyn?

Later that evening, Evelyn's phone rang. It was Elizabeth Hartwell. "Evelyn, due to the ongoing rumors, the college has decided to withdraw your grant."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. "Ms. Hartwell, I'll speak to Theodore Winslow myself tomorrow."

Hanging up, a wave of exhaustion crashed over her.

When she returned home, Nathaniel was conspicuously absent.

Victoria Hawthorne noticed her troubled expression. "Mr. Whitmore called earlier. He’s working late and won’t be home for dinner."

The weight of the scandal pressed down on Evelyn, but she refused to crumble.

The next morning, she marched straight into Theodore Winslow's office.

Placing her evidence on his desk, she said, "Mr. Winslow, I’ve traced the IP address of the person spreading these rumors."

Theodore arched a brow. "And? The damage is done. Can you even disprove their claims?"

His next words were sharp. "Given your family’s financial situation, how do you explain being linked to someone who owns a luxury car?"

Evelyn met his gaze without flinching. "Just because my family isn’t wealthy, does one photo prove I’m involved with a rich man?"

Theodore leaned forward. "Then explain the photo. Whose car is that?"

Evelyn took a deep breath. "That car belongs to my husband."
###Chapter 115

A deep, commanding voice cut through the tense atmosphere of the office like a knife.

Evelyn spun around, her breath catching as she saw Nathaniel's imposing figure framed in the doorway. His broad shoulders seemed to block out all light from the corridor behind him.

An unexpected warmth spread through her chest despite the gravity of the situation.

Nathaniel strode into the room with effortless authority that made everyone straighten their posture.

Theodore Winslow quickly stepped forward. "Mr. Whitmore, this is an unexpected honor. To what do we owe this visit?"

Nathaniel's piercing gaze never wavered as he stated, "I'm here to clarify. The vehicle in that photograph is mine."

The revelation hit Theodore like a physical blow. His face paled as he struggled to maintain his composure.

The last thing he'd anticipated was Nathaniel Whitmore's involvement in this matter.

"O-of course, Mr. Whitmore," Theodore stammered. "We're merely conducting routine inquiries. No offense intended."

Nathaniel casually took a seat on the leather sofa. "By all means, continue your investigation."

Turning back to Theodore, Evelyn handed over a document. "Here's the IP address of the person who started these rumors."

Theodore accepted the evidence with trembling hands. "Rest assured, we take such matters very seriously. The university won't tolerate this kind of behavior."

His eyes darted nervously to Nathaniel. "Unless... Mr. Whitmore, would you prefer to handle this differently?"

No one in the room could have guessed the complex relationship between Evelyn and Nathaniel.

Now it made sense why Nathaniel had personally attended the awards ceremony last week. It had been for Evelyn all along.

Nathaniel stood abruptly, locking eyes with Evelyn. "We're leaving."

Evelyn followed him out, stealing glances at his profile. "Thank you," she murmured.

"I'm just preventing this from reaching Eleanor," Nathaniel replied tersely.

A shadow crossed Evelyn's face. "I understand," she said quietly, pushing down the flicker of disappointment.

Nathaniel shifted uncomfortably. "How did you obtain that IP address?"

Evelyn looked away. "A friend helped me."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. He wondered if this "friend" was the famous actor who'd presented her award.

The thought unsettled him more than he cared to admit. "I have meetings all afternoon. Contact Robert if you need anything."

Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise at his abrupt tone.

"Don't overcomplicate this," Nathaniel added. "Let Robert handle anything beyond your control. It's better to contain situations before they escalate."

Evelyn forced a casual smile. "Understood. There won't be any more incidents."

Nathaniel strode away without another word, his long legs carrying him swiftly across campus.

Robert Chambers remained behind, bowing slightly. "Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Whitmore was already on his way when he heard about your situation."

Evelyn nodded silently.

She understood perfectly - Nathaniel's intervention wasn't about protecting her, but about shielding Eleanor from worry.

Still, she refused to dwell on that painful truth.

Robert handed her a business card. "My direct line, Mrs. Whitmore. Day or night."

Evelyn returned to the library after he left, her mind racing.

That evening at home, Evelyn calmly explained to her brothers, "It's been resolved. Sebastian helped track down the culprit."

Sebastian Montgomery shrugged. "Anytime, little sister. My hacking skills are at your disposal."

Evelyn sent him a grateful heart emoji.

Having her family's support gave Evelyn strength. She wasn't facing these battles alone.

By morning, the offensive posts had vanished from the university forum. An official statement denounced the rumors as baseless.

Cassandra Ellington faced severe consequences - academic probation and revocation of her guaranteed graduate admission.

Sophia Bennett shook her head in disbelief when she found Evelyn between classes. "I never imagined Cassandra would go this far."

"She couldn't stand seeing you succeed," Sophia continued. "The investigation uncovered her history of spreading malicious rumors. Justice served!"

Evelyn simply nodded, already moving past the incident. She had more important things to focus on than petty jealousy.
###Chapter 116

Evelyn felt no pity for Cassandra. Those who played dirty games deserved to face the repercussions.

With the college scandal resolved, Evelyn rushed to the hospital after her exams.

Eleanor’s surgery was scheduled for the upcoming weekend, and Evelyn couldn’t afford to miss visiting her.

As the elevator doors slid open, she collided with Beatrice Harrington.

Beatrice smirked, her tone dripping with condescension. "Evelyn, you look awfully pleased with yourself. Did you really think you could’ve handled that mess at the university alone? The Whitmore name clearly pulled strings for you."

Evelyn’s expression darkened. "I didn’t need Nathaniel’s help."

Beatrice scoffed. "Stop pretending. What spell have you cast over my son? I don’t understand why he’s so invested in cleaning up your mess."

"He’s even delaying his engagement to Victoria because of you. Postponing his grandmother’s surgery, searching for a new surgeon—disrupting everything!" she snapped.

Evelyn froze. "What?"

She struggled to process the revelation.

"Still playing dumb? Fine, I’ll spell it out. Victoria’s brother set a condition—he’d only operate on Eleanor if Nathaniel agreed to marry her. But my son refused and quietly sought another doctor instead."

A storm of emotions raged inside Evelyn.

After a heavy silence, she whispered, "I didn’t know."

She had assumed Victoria’s brother would perform the surgery.

Beatrice sneered. "Well, the surgeon Nathaniel found got into a car accident. His wrist is injured—he can’t operate now. The surgery is delayed indefinitely."

"Eleanor’s health is at stake, Evelyn. After everything she’s done for you, would you really use her as leverage?"

Evelyn’s voice was steel. "I would never."

"Then do the right thing. Divorce Nathaniel so he can marry Victoria. That way, her brother will proceed with the surgery."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "I know what I have to do."

"See that you do." Beatrice turned on her heel and left.

Evelyn stood motionless, Beatrice’s words echoing in her mind.

She hadn’t expected Nathaniel to refuse Victoria’s proposal. On paper, they were perfect—matched in status, wealth, and influence.

Steeling herself, Evelyn entered the hospital room.

The nurse shook her head subtly—Eleanor was asleep.

Evelyn approached the bed, gently taking Eleanor’s frail hand in hers.

The sight of Eleanor’s gaunt face and weakened state twisted Evelyn’s heart. The surgery couldn’t wait any longer.

After confirming with the staff, Evelyn learned the surgery had indeed been postponed—just as Beatrice had said. The lead surgeon’s accident left them scrambling for a replacement.

Leaving the hospital, Evelyn’s resolve hardened.

At home, she discreetly arranged for Victoria Hawthorne to return to the hospital, ensuring Eleanor wouldn’t be alone.

With the house empty, Evelyn retreated to the kitchen.

When Nathaniel arrived, he found her stepping out, apron-clad, carrying a tray of familiar dishes.

His gaze lingered, memories flooding back—the countless meals she’d prepared during their three years together.

But since signing the divorce papers, he hadn’t tasted a single one.

Had she cooked tonight as thanks for handling the university scandal?

At the table, Nathaniel eyed the spread. "No poison, I hope?"

Evelyn managed a faint smile. "Completely safe, I promise."

As he ate, he noticed Evelyn hadn’t touched her food.

Curious, he arched a brow. "Not hungry?"

"We need to talk."
###Chapter 117

Nathaniel placed his fork down with deliberate precision, his piercing gaze locking onto Evelyn.

Drawing a steadying breath, Evelyn ventured, "Why did you refuse Dr. Montgomery for Grandma Eleanor's surgery? Julian is practically unmatched in his specialty. Wouldn't he be the safest choice?"

A shadow flickered across Nathaniel's face, his jaw tightening. "Who told you that?"

"I ran into your mother at the hospital today," Evelyn admitted.

Nathaniel leaned back in his chair, his voice turning glacial. "Is that all you wanted to discuss?"

"Perhaps you should reconsider Victoria's brother's conditions," Evelyn pressed. "It doesn't seem like you'd be losing anything."

The air between them grew thick with tension.

Studying Nathaniel, Evelyn suddenly felt like she was staring at a stranger—his motives completely inscrutable.

His lips curled into a sardonic smile. "No losses? Is your eagerness to throw yourself into another man's arms clouding your judgment?"

"It's the logical solution—for us, and most importantly, for Grandma Eleanor," Evelyn insisted.

"That's your opinion," Nathaniel countered sharply.

The chair scraped against the floor as he stood. "And what's yours?" Evelyn called after him.

Nathaniel froze mid-step. "That's none of your business," he replied, his voice uncharacteristically unsteady.

Undeterred, Evelyn pressed on. "You've been delaying the divorce. Could it be... you've developed feelings for me?"

Nathaniel's shoulders tensed momentarily before he turned, his expression dripping with disdain. "Evelyn, what makes you think you're worthy of such a presumption?"

"Isn't it a possibility?" she challenged.

Truthfully, Evelyn's words were less a genuine question and more a calculated provocation—a desperate attempt to push Nathaniel toward finalizing their separation.

Nathaniel's mouth formed a hard line. "I've said it before—this is solely for Grandma's benefit. I won't be forced into marriage again."

Evelyn caught the pointed reference to their arranged union. The cold detachment in his eyes sent a shiver down her spine.

Lowering her gaze, she proposed, "We don't have to tell Grandma about the divorce. And I won't mention you and Victoria until after her surgery."

Having regained her composure, Evelyn had no intention of further entangling herself with Nathaniel.

An unexpected surge of irritation darkened Nathaniel's features. "Evelyn, you don't get to dictate the terms of our marriage. Stop scheming," he snapped before storming out.

Left alone, Evelyn mechanically picked at her abandoned meal, the flavors as dull as her spirits.

That night, the master bedroom felt cavernous. Sleep eluded her, each restless hour marked by Nathaniel's conspicuous absence.

The next afternoon, Margaret's invitation provided a welcome distraction.

Arriving at the Dawson residence, Evelyn was surprised to find Julian already there.

Over dessert, she hesitated before asking, "Julian, how critical is surgeon selection for cardiac procedures? Is there really a vast difference between the best and second-best?"

Julian considered the question carefully. "There's always a hierarchy of skill, but context matters. Not every case requires the absolute top specialist—it depends on the patient's specific condition."

Noticing Evelyn's troubled expression, he frowned. "You look pale. Is everything alright?"

"It's nothing," Evelyn deflected. "Just a friend's grandmother needing heart surgery. Their first-choice surgeon isn't available."

Julian's eyes lit with professional interest. "Cardiac surgery, you say?" As a renowned specialist himself, the topic was close to his expertise.
###Chapter 118

Evelyn nodded thoughtfully. "You're right, Julian. Even as a veterinarian, you're still part of the medical community."

"Do you happen to know any senior colleagues, friends, or classmates who specialize in cardiac surgery?" she asked.

"Well," Julian replied, "arranging the surgery shouldn't be difficult. I know a renowned cardiac surgeon, but he's based in Nord City. Still, I can help set up a consultation."

For the sake of his sister's friend, Julian was more than willing to assist. Easing Evelyn's worries made the effort worthwhile.

"Would you? That would be amazing," Evelyn said, relief flickering in her eyes.

And while Nathaniel's refusal to marry Victoria still weighed on her mind, Evelyn couldn't help but see the surgeon Julian mentioned as a possible solution.

If they couldn't find a suitable doctor in Bem City, perhaps Nord City held the answer they needed.

That evening, Evelyn chose to stay home, planning to discuss it with Nathaniel the next day.

But in the dead of night, the shrill ring of her phone shattered the silence.

Nathaniel's voice, strained with urgency, cut through the darkness. "Grandma's been rushed to the emergency room. Where are you?"

"I'll be right there."

Without wasting a second, Evelyn hung up, changed quickly, and headed straight to the hospital.

Her hands trembled uncontrollably the entire ride. Just yesterday, Eleanor had seemed perfectly fine during Evelyn's visit—how had her condition worsened so suddenly?

As the taxi pulled up to the hospital entrance, Evelyn practically leaped out, every second feeling critical.

She spotted Nathaniel outside the emergency room, his silhouette stark against the dim lighting, his presence as heavy as the night itself.

The sorrow radiating from him was palpable. Evelyn stood beside him, the silence between them thick with unspoken dread.

The wait was agonizing.

Finally, Evelyn broke the silence. "Nathaniel, I wanted to tell you—"

"Let's finalize the divorce tomorrow," he interrupted, his voice cold and detached, slicing through her like winter air.

Gazing at the faint glow from the operating room lights, Evelyn nodded. "Alright."

After all, their marriage should have ended long ago.

From the start, it had been a mistake that needed correcting.

Noticing Evelyn's composed expression, Nathaniel sensed she had already accepted it.

Curiosity got the better of him. "What were you going to say earlier?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It doesn't matter now."

She had considered mentioning the surgeon in Nord City, but bringing it up now felt pointless.

Victoria's brother was already one of the best doctors—he was the obvious choice for the surgery.

Evelyn refused to compromise Eleanor's health.

Nathaniel pressed his lips together, tension coiling tighter inside him as he studied Evelyn's calm demeanor.

It felt like an eternity before Eleanor's condition stabilized.

The doctor emerged, his expression grave. "We caught it in time, but the surgery needs to happen soon. The sooner, the better."

Nathaniel remained silent, his face unreadable.

Evelyn forced a small smile. "Thank you. We'll schedule it as soon as possible."

As long as Eleanor could undergo the surgery without complications, everything would be fine.

Shortly after, Eleanor was moved to the ICU for observation.

Nathaniel and Evelyn stood side by side, watching over her. Eleanor's silver hair stood out starkly against the sterile white sheets.

Only when assured of Eleanor's stability did Evelyn finally exhale, exhaustion crashing over her as she sank into a nearby chair.

The adrenaline from earlier had kept her going, but now, fatigue hit her full force.

A moment later, Nathaniel handed her a warm breakfast.

Evelyn glanced outside—dawn had broken. Summer mornings arrived early, the world shifting from darkness to light in what felt like an instant.

She accepted the food quietly. "Thank you."

"Once you're done, we can go to the courthouse," Nathaniel said.

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Alright."

She finished eating, the gnawing hunger fading as energy slowly returned.

Then, they left the hospital.

As they got into the car, Nathaniel handed her a document. "Sign this," he instructed.
###Chapter 119



Evelyn recognized the document in front of her immediately, its implications clear as day.

"I've already told you, I don't want anything," she said firmly.

She truly had no interest in Nathaniel's wealth.

Nathaniel's brows knitted together in irritation. "I don't have time for games," he snapped.

"Nathaniel, I'm not playing games. I meant every word," Evelyn replied, meeting his gaze steadily.

"You made it clear you despised being forced into marriage. Maybe my initial feelings were... misplaced."

"Consider this my way of making up for any pain I caused you these past three years."

"I don’t want financial obligations. I’d rather leave with nothing," Nathaniel shot back.

He lowered his hand from his temple, his piercing eyes locking onto Evelyn’s calm, almond-shaped ones—eyes that radiated unshakable serenity.

He pushed the document toward her. "No, it’s my responsibility. I won’t be so petty as to deny someone who once stood by me."

Evelyn glanced at the paper, then decisively tore it in half. "I appreciate the gesture, Mr. Whitmore, but I have every right to refuse."

A flicker of surprise crossed Nathaniel’s face as he stared at the torn contract.

Leaning back in his seat, he remarked coolly, "Fine. Just don’t come crying to me later."

Turning toward the window, Evelyn watched the scenery blur past, her resolve unwavering.

I won’t regret this.

After all, she had already taken the most precious thing from him.

A child was all she needed now.

Evelyn and Nathaniel were the first to arrive at the courthouse.

After submitting the divorce application, they were informed of the mandatory one-month waiting period before finalization.

The news caught Evelyn off guard. She hadn’t realized modern divorces required such delays.

Once the paperwork was filed, Evelyn stepped outside, stealing a glance at Nathaniel.

"We’ll be back in a month, then. Don’t worry—I won’t change my mind. Just make sure Eleanor’s surgery happens as promised."

Nathaniel’s voice was heavy. "I know. No need to remind me."

As he strode away, Evelyn paused, then hailed a taxi.



From his car, Nathaniel watched Evelyn’s taxi disappear before shifting his attention elsewhere.

In the passenger seat, Robert hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Whitmore."

Nathaniel cut him off impatiently. "What is it?"

"Ms. Sinclair has been trying to reach you. She says it’s urgent."

Nathaniel exhaled, staring out the window. After a beat, he replied, "Fine."

With that, the sleek black car sped away from the courthouse.

Evelyn attended her university lectures as usual, but her mind kept drifting back to that morning.

She had mentally prepared herself to finalize the divorce—only for the waiting period to throw her off balance.

As evening fell and she headed home, her phone buzzed with an incoming call from Julian.

"Evelyn, when can I expect those medical records from your friend?"

"Julian, don’t worry about it. They’ve already arranged a surgeon."

"Alright. Understood."

Julian had wanted to help, to prove himself useful to her, but once again, the opportunity slipped away.

He sighed, conflicted. Part of him wanted Evelyn to rely on him—yet another part hoped she never had to.

A complicated feeling.

Moments later, a message from Victoria lit up Julian’s screen: "Julian, we need to talk. Eleanor’s surgery is everything to me."

Frowning, Julian closed the chat without responding. Some things were better left ignored.

Back at home, Evelyn found Victoria Hawthorne waiting—Nathaniel nowhere in sight.

Sensing her unease, Victoria offered, "Mr. Whitmore is often busy with work."

"Maybe you should take a break. Shopping might help clear your mind."
###Chapter 120



"Victoria, I'm fine. I understand he's overwhelmed with work," Evelyn replied, forcing a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

That evening, she attended her prenatal class, focusing intently on the instructor's words about pregnancy care - a welcome distraction from her turbulent thoughts.

She needed this escape.

But fate had other plans. The next morning, while scrolling through newsfeeds, a headline stabbed through her carefully constructed calm: "Wealthy socialite Victoria Sinclair spotted ring shopping with mystery beau."

Her breath hitched.

Though the photo was blurry, Evelyn would recognize Nathaniel's silhouette anywhere.

The timeline mocked her. Mere hours after signing divorce papers, he was already choosing rings with Victoria. The speed of his betrayal left her reeling.

Shutting off her phone with trembling fingers, Evelyn buried herself in pregnancy literature. With no afternoon classes scheduled, she retreated to her studio - financial independence had become crucial now that Nathaniel's support was gone.

Days passed without Nathaniel returning to their shared home. Evelyn refused to dwell on his absence, maintaining strict routines: balanced meals, prenatal vitamins, and intensive research on newborn care.

When doctors moved Eleanor from ICU to a regular ward, Evelyn prepared her signature chicken soup and headed to the hospital.

The scene in the ward froze her in the doorway. Victoria and Beatrice flanked Eleanor's bed, with Nathaniel standing sentinel beside them. "I'll come back later," Evelyn murmured, already retreating.

"Don't be ridiculous, dear," Eleanor chided warmly. "Come in."

Victoria's smile didn't reach her cold eyes as she gestured to a chair. "Mrs. Whitmore, please sit."

Evelyn ignored the offered seat, placing her thermos on the bedside table instead. "Grandmother, I made your favorite soup. Please have some when you're hungry."

"How thoughtful," Eleanor beamed. "And how's my great-grandchild treating you? Any morning sickness?"

The question hung heavily in the sterilized air.

"The baby's been surprisingly gentle with me," Evelyn admitted, fingers unconsciously tracing her barely-showing bump.

Eleanor chuckled. "Just like Nathaniel's mother! Beatrice sailed through her pregnancy without a single complaint."

Beatrice preened momentarily before her gaze dropped to Evelyn's stomach. Her smile vanished as if remembering this child would carry Bowen blood, not Harrington.

Evelyn wondered if her baby's calm demeanor was genetic - a quiet rebellion against the storm of its parents' failed marriage.

"We should let Grandmother rest," Nathaniel's baritone cut through the tension.

Evelyn squeezed Eleanor's papery hand. "I'll visit again soon."

"Take care of each other," Eleanor insisted, deliberately pressing Evelyn's hand into Nathaniel's.

Their palms connected like live wires. Evelyn flinched at the familiar warmth of his touch, acutely aware of Victoria's glare burning into their joined hands.

"Enough of this charade!" Beatrice snapped, wrenching them apart.

Evelyn stumbled back, only to find Victoria suddenly at her side, linking arms with false sweetness. "Mrs. Whitmore, might we have a word in private?"
###Chapter 121

Victoria's sudden approach startled Evelyn, sending a wave of discomfort through her.

What game was Victoria playing now?

Evelyn pulled her arm away with an icy glare, creating distance between them.

"Even if you and Nathaniel go your separate ways, there's no reason we can't be civil," Victoria countered.

A mocking smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Ms. Sinclair, have you ever heard of someone befriending the other woman?"

At the term, Victoria's expression darkened instantly.

But under Nathaniel and Eleanor's watchful gazes, she quickly masked her irritation with feigned hurt. "Evelyn, why the hostility? I genuinely want us all to get along."

Beatrice immediately jumped to Victoria's defense, shooting Evelyn a disapproving look.

"Evelyn, have you no shame? Look at how gracious Victoria is being. Who are you to label her like that?" Beatrice scolded.

"If you hadn't interfered, Victoria might already be my daughter-in-law by now. Three years have passed—they could've had children!" she added bitterly.

Evelyn's eyes glinted with sarcasm. "Well then, congratulations on your upcoming union. May you start a family soon. Happy now?"

Beatrice's temper flared as Evelyn turned to leave.

"Wait, Evelyn! What's with this attitude? My son is about to propose to Victoria. If you dare cause any trouble, you'll regret it," Beatrice warned sharply.

Nathaniel stepped in. "Enough."

Hearing his firm tone, Beatrice bit back her words. "Nathaniel, Evelyn just came to bring food for Eleanor. Keep an eye on her. We can't have any slip-ups in front of her."

A shadow crossed Nathaniel's face. "There won't be any," he stated firmly.

Before Beatrice could press further, Victoria gently stopped her. "Mrs. Whitmore, I trust Nathaniel's judgment. We're all here for Eleanor's sake."

"Victoria is far more reasonable," Beatrice remarked. "Nathaniel, perhaps you could accompany her to look at wedding dresses?"

A hopeful gleam lit Victoria's eyes as she waited for Nathaniel's response. But his expression remained unreadable. "I'm busy. Let's not forget—this is just an act."

Nathaniel turned to Victoria. "When will Julian arrive?"

Evelyn answered tightly, "Soon."

Beatrice shared that the surgery was scheduled for the end of the month. Victoria exhaled in relief. "That's fine. Julian will be available by then."

The extended timeline gave Victoria more room to persuade Julian.

"Nathaniel, I consulted an astrologer. There's a favorable date next week. How about making your engagement to Victoria official then?" Beatrice suggested.

Nathaniel's face betrayed no emotion. "Whatever."

With that, he walked out, leaving Victoria with a flicker of unease.

Sensing her worry, Beatrice reassured her, "Don't fret. Once Evelyn is out of the picture, this engagement won't stay pretend for long."

"And when that happens, make sure all your brothers attend the ceremony," she added.

Victoria forced confidence into her voice. "If I'm getting engaged, they'll be there without question."

With this, she had secured half her goal.

If Julian agreed to the surgery, her path to marrying Nathaniel would be clear.

As Evelyn left the hospital, a heavy weight settled in her chest.

Despite the summer heat, an unshakable chill clung to her.

With the weekend approaching, Evelyn spent most of her time in her studio. The constant blast of cold air left her feeling like she was coming down with something.
###Chapter 122

Evelyn was just settling in for some well-deserved rest when the sharp click of Cassandra's designer heels pierced through the quiet room.

Without preamble, Cassandra thrust a thick folder into Evelyn's hands. "Make sure this gets delivered properly. If the client has any complaints, you'll handle the revisions personally."

Evelyn flipped through the documents, frowning. "Isn't this your responsibility?"

Cassandra smirked. "Technically, yes. But I have more pressing matters to attend to."

She leaned in, her voice dripping with condescension. "Besides, since you've been clocking in all weekend, it's only fair you take this one. We can't have dead weight on the payroll, can we?"

With that, she spun on her heel and strode out.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. Once this was done, she could finally go home and collapse into bed.

She took a sip of steaming chamomile tea, letting the warmth soothe her frayed nerves.

Outside, she hailed a cab and gave the driver an address to one of the most exclusive penthouses in the city.

A uniformed maid answered the door.

"Hello, I'm from Prestige Designs," Evelyn said, forcing professionalism into her voice. "I'm here to follow up on the client's satisfaction with our recent interior work."

"Right this way," the maid murmured.

Evelyn followed her into an opulent living space—and froze.

At the center of the room, displayed like a priceless artifact, was a breathtaking ivory wedding gown.

"Is that—?" Evelyn's breath caught. "That's the legendary Lulu Vuitton bridal collection piece. The only one in existence."

Penelope appeared with a smug smile. "This is the engagement gown Victoria picked out."

She ran a possessive hand over the delicate beading. "Stunning, isn't it? You'd have to work three lifetimes just to afford the thread holding these diamonds."

When Victoria descended the staircase, everything clicked into place.

"Penelope, don't be dramatic," Victoria chided lightly. "It's just a placeholder. I'm having a custom piece made for the actual ceremony."

Evelyn straightened her blazer. "Ms. Sinclair, are you satisfied with the renovations so far?"

Victoria and Penelope exchanged a look dripping with unspoken superiority.

A prickle of unease ran down Evelyn's spine. She needed to get this over with quickly.

Victoria took the documents with a practiced smile. "Nathaniel and I decided a fresh start was necessary. Hence the new property."

Evelyn kept her expression carefully blank, gaze fixed just past Victoria's shoulder.

Victoria's smile tightened. She'd expected at least some reaction after finally securing Nathaniel's commitment.

Every obstacle in her path—she was certain Evelyn was behind them. Yet now, the woman stood there like a stone wall.

"While your firm's work is... adequate," Victoria continued, "there are adjustments needed."

"The memory wall for wedding photos isn't to our taste. And the master bedroom mattress is unacceptable." She arched a brow. "You'll arrange replacements immediately?"

"Of course. I'll have our team address it first thing," Evelyn replied.

Penelope stepped forward. "We're settling this today, Evelyn. You're coming with us to select a new bed."

Her smile was razor-sharp. "A little manual labor might justify that salary of yours."

Evelyn suppressed a sigh. This was going to be a long afternoon.

She trailed behind them into the city's most luxurious home furnishings emporium.

Soothing classical music floated through the upscale mall, but the aggressive air conditioning made Evelyn shiver. Her head throbbed—she'd been fighting a cold all week.

"Keep up," Penelope snapped over her shoulder.

Evelyn quickened her pace despite the dizziness creeping in.

As they approached the flagship bedding boutique, a familiar broad-shouldered silhouette made her breath hitch.
###Chapter 123

Evelyn froze when she spotted that unmistakable silhouette from behind. Her breath caught in her throat.

Nathaniel Whitmore? Here?

Victoria Sinclair approached him with a bright smile. "Nate, what a pleasant surprise to see you here!"

Nathaniel stood surrounded by his usual entourage, his tailored navy suit accentuating his commanding presence. He barely acknowledged Victoria's greeting.

Then his gaze drifted past her - and locked onto Evelyn. His eyebrows drew together slightly.

Victoria quickly explained, "I'm renovating my penthouse, and Ms. Carter's design firm comes highly recommended."

"Though I certainly didn't expect her to personally handle such a trivial matter," she added with a dismissive wave.

Penelope Whitmore called out sharply, "Evelyn! Stop dawdling and help us choose!"

Evelyn squared her shoulders and approached, carefully avoiding Nathaniel's piercing stare.

Maintaining professional composure, she asked, "Ms. Sinclair, what specifications are you looking for in a mattress?"

Victoria turned to Nathaniel with a coy smile. "Nate darling, which collection would you recommend? Which one promises the most... comfort?"

Nathaniel gestured to the store manager beside him. "Show us your premium selections."

The manager launched into an enthusiastic spiel about various luxury mattress lines.

Meanwhile, Evelyn shivered. The mall's aggressive air conditioning made her feel lightheaded and nauseous.

After the presentation, Victoria fixed Evelyn with a challenging look. "Well, Ms. Carter? What's your professional opinion?"

Though she'd barely processed the manager's speech, Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Any of these would suit, depending on your personal preferences."

Victoria pressed, "But as our designer, surely you have a recommendation?"

Evelyn's hand moved almost involuntarily toward a display model. Suddenly, the room fell silent. She realized dozens of eyes had turned her way.

Blinking, Evelyn read the description of her chosen mattress: "King-sized latex waterbed, engineered for enhanced intimacy."

Heat flooded her cheeks. She'd accidentally pointed to the most provocative option in the store.

Victoria covered her mouth to stifle a laugh. "Nate, what do you think of Ms. Carter's... interesting choice?"

Penelope chimed in with false sweetness, "Evelyn certainly has unique taste. No wonder men find her so fascinating."

Victoria shot Penelope a warning look. "Let's keep this professional."

Penelope smirked. "Some people have no problem acting inappropriately but lack the courage to admit it."

Evelyn's patience snapped. "Ms. Sinclair, have you made a decision?" she asked through gritted teeth.

Penelope huffed. "Evelyn, are you trying to leave already? Is this the service your firm provides?"

Victoria added, "We haven't even discussed the feature wall yet."

Suddenly, black spots danced before Evelyn's eyes. She reached out blindly to steady herself - and grabbed someone's wrist.

As her vision cleared, she murmured, "Thank you."

"You look pale," came Nathaniel's deep voice.

Evelyn startled when she realized whose arm she'd seized. She tried to pull away, but Nathaniel tightened his grip.

"Sit down," he ordered.

Penelope whirled around. "Evelyn! Unhand him this instant!"

Victoria's expression darkened when she saw their connected hands.

Evelyn yanked her wrist free and met Nathaniel's gaze coolly. "I'm fine. This is part of my job."
###Chapter 124

Nathaniel's voice turned icy. "Why would you endanger yourself for work?"

Evelyn took a few unsteady steps before her vision swam. Her knees buckled.

She braced for the inevitable crash against the marble floor, but strong arms caught her at the last second.

The embrace was achingly familiar yet distant, like a half-remembered dream.

Her eyelids fluttered as she fought to focus, but the face above her remained a blur.

Nathaniel cradled Evelyn close, his stomach twisting at the clammy sweat coating her skin and the unnatural pallor of her lips.

Without hesitation, he swept her up and strode toward the exit.

Victoria rushed after them, heels clicking frantically. "Nathaniel! Wait!"

The elevator doors slid shut in her face.

Victoria's manicured nails dug into her palms. "Do you really believe this wasn't staged?" she spat.

Penelope appeared at her shoulder, lips pursed. "Convenient timing, don't you think? Perfectly healthy one minute, fainting damsel the next."

"With Evelyn's acting skills, Nathaniel never stood a chance," Victoria sneered.

Her eyes tracked the descending elevator numbers until they stopped at B2—undoubtedly heading to the parking garage.

Victoria jammed the call button. "We're following them to the hospital."

She knew Evelyn's games too well. This pathetic attempt to play the victim wouldn't work.

The world swayed as Evelyn regained awareness in a moving car, her cheek pressed against a solid chest.

A cool cloth dabbed at her forehead, followed by the crisp scent of bergamot and sandalwood.

Shivering, she instinctively burrowed closer to the heat source.

Nathaniel glanced down as Evelyn nuzzled against him. Under different circumstances, he might have accused her of calculated seduction.

He shrugged off his suit jacket and tucked it around her, securing her firmly against him.

"Nearest major hospital. Now," he ordered the driver.

The car accelerated through traffic.

Nathaniel pressed his palm to Evelyn's forehead—the fever had spiked alarmingly.

When they screeched to a halt at the ER entrance, he carried her through the automatic doors without breaking stride.

A gust of wind slapped Evelyn back to full consciousness.

Her eyes flew open, landing on Nathaniel's razor-sharp jawline and grimly set mouth. Was this real?

She jerked her head away from the blinding hospital lights. "Nathaniel, put me down."

"Stop struggling."

"I don't need a doctor! I'm fine!"

Panic clawed up her throat. Standard medications could harm the baby. Even routine treatments posed risks.

More urgently, if doctors discovered her pregnancy, everything would unravel.

She couldn't let Nathaniel find out. Not when their divorce would be finalized in thirty days.

"Evelyn," Nathaniel warned, "keep squirming and I'll drop you."

His arms tightened as he deposited her onto an ER cot. "Stay. The doctor's coming."

"I told you, I'm better now." She pushed up on her elbows.

Nathaniel caged her in, palms planted on either side of her head. "Have you completely lost your senses?"

"There's nothing wrong with me," she insisted.

How would she hide her condition during the examination?

Their gazes locked in silent combat—until Nathaniel did the unexpected.

He leaned in until their foreheads touched.
###Chapter 125



Evelyn's breath caught as Nathaniel approached, their foreheads touching unexpectedly in the sterile hospital air.

Her pulse quickened, struggling to comprehend Nathaniel's sudden closeness.

"Can you feel it?" Nathaniel murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. "The temperature difference?"

Blinking rapidly, Evelyn realized his skin was icy against her burning forehead.

A sharp cough shattered the moment. "This is a hospital, not a honeymoon suite," came the crisp reprimand.

Nathaniel straightened instantly while Evelyn yanked the blanket over her flaming cheeks.

Isabelle Laurent, the attending nurse, cleared her throat. "Registered family members may stay. Others need to complete admission paperwork."

Peeking through the blanket's edge, Evelyn watched Nathaniel's retreating form until he disappeared around the corner. Only then did she exhale.

Finally alone.

Pulling the blanket down slightly, Evelyn whispered, "Isabelle, really, I'm fine. No treatment necessary."

The nurse aimed an infrared thermometer with practiced ease. "39 degrees Celsius," she announced. "That's not fine by any medical standard."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. She hadn't realized her fever was that severe.

As Dr. Julian Montgomery entered, Isabelle reported, "Patient presents with high fever but refuses treatment."

"At 39 degrees?" Julian's familiar voice turned sharp. "Planning to spontaneously combust instead?"

Evelyn's fingers clutched the blanket tighter. Panic surged through her veins.

Julian was here.

Nathaniel had brought her to Julian's hospital? This was disastrous.

How would she explain herself if Julian recognized her?

The room spun as regret flooded her. Leaving home today had been a terrible mistake.

"Patient seems intent on suffocating under that blanket," Julian observed dryly, approaching the bed. "Isabelle, remove it."



Evelyn curled into herself, fabric clenched in white-knuckled fists.

"No!" The protest escaped before she could stop it.

Isabelle had already pulled back the blanket, revealing Evelyn's flushed face.

"Evelyn?" Julian's brow furrowed. "What are you doing here? Are you ill?"

He snatched the thermometer before she could respond. The reading darkened his expression instantly.

"39 degrees and you didn't tell me? Refusing treatment?" His voice turned dangerously calm. "Trying to kill yourself to spite me?"

"I have my reasons," Evelyn muttered.

"Reasons don't matter at this temperature," Julian snapped. "You need medication and IV fluids immediately."

"I can't!" Desperation edged Evelyn's voice as she grabbed Julian's sleeve. "No medication. No IV."

"Allergic?" Julian's professional mask slipped slightly.

Evelyn shook her head, guilt flashing across her features. "No, Julian. I'm... I'm pregnant."

Julian's pen clattered to the floor.

He touched his temple as if checking his own temperature. "Say that again."

"You heard correctly," Evelyn confirmed quietly. "I can't risk any medication while pregnant."

Julian staggered back a step, his face hardening. "Who's responsible for this?"

White-hot rage surged through him at the thought of someone endangering his sister this way.

Years of professional detachment evaporated in an instant.

Who dared do this to her?

The door swung open abruptly. Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his gaze sweeping the room. "Why hasn't treatment started? Registration is complete."

Isabelle remained silent, her eyes darting toward Julian.

Recognition flashed across Julian's face as he took in Nathaniel's presence. The pieces clicked together with terrible clarity.
###Chapter 126

Nathaniel's gaze shifted from Julian to Evelyn lying on the hospital bed, a spark of doubt flickering in his piercing blue eyes.

Could the child belong to Julian?

The way Julian kept appearing around the Montgomery women only fueled Nathaniel's growing suspicions.

Avoiding Nathaniel's probing stare, Evelyn whispered weakly, "Please just prescribe fever reducers. Given my... condition, certain medications aren't safe."

Her quiet reminder about her pregnancy was meant for Julian's ears, a silent plea for discretion.

Pushing aside his swirling thoughts, Julian turned to Isabelle. "Prepare the prescription and appropriate medication."

"Shouldn't she receive intravenous fluids?" Nathaniel interjected, his brow furrowing with concern.

Annoyance flashed across Julian's face. "IVs aren't always the best solution."

"But her fever is dangerously high," Nathaniel countered, stepping closer.

Julian met his challenge with icy composure. "Are you the physician here, Mr. Whitmore? If you'd prefer to treat her yourself, by all means."

Evelyn's anxious gaze darted between the two men, silently praying their tension wouldn't escalate.

Nathaniel's expression darkened, but he remained silent, his displeasure evident in the tight line of his jaw.

Moments later, Isabelle returned with the medication.

"Dr. Montgomery," she informed Julian, "they're requesting you at Bed 12."

Julian quickly regained his professional demeanor. "Take your medicine now," he instructed Evelyn. "I'll check on you later."

Evelyn nodded weakly. "Alright."

As Julian exited, Evelyn exhaled in relief. Running into him unexpectedly might have been a stroke of luck she hadn't anticipated. With Julian here, her secret stood a better chance of remaining hidden.

Had she gone to the Whitmore family's private hospital today, everything would have been exposed.

Was this fate's twisted way of helping her?

Reaching for the pills, she realized the water dispenser was across the room. As she struggled to sit up, Nathaniel wordlessly took the cup from her trembling hands.

Watching his retreating figure, Evelyn acknowledged that despite his flaws, Nathaniel still possessed shreds of humanity.

When he returned, she avoided eye contact, accepting the water. "Thank you."

After swallowing the medication, she noticed Nathaniel lingering. Meeting his gaze, she said softly, "Thank you for bringing me here. I'll manage when it's time to leave."

Nathaniel's lips thinned. "Do you imagine I have nothing better to do than wait around?"

With that biting remark, he strode from the emergency room.

Yet instead of leaving immediately, he paused in the corridor, loosening his tie with sharp, frustrated movements.

"Mr. Whitmore, shall we depart?" Robert asked cautiously.

"Why wouldn't we?" Nathaniel snapped. "Do I appear to have unlimited free time?"

He fixed Robert with a pointed look. "Arrange for a private nurse. It would reflect poorly if something happened to her under our watch."

Robert nodded knowingly. Nathaniel always spoke in riddles when concerned.

As Nathaniel approached the hospital entrance, Victoria and Penelope emerged from a taxi.

"Nathaniel, how is Mrs. Carter?" Victoria called out.

"Stable," he replied curtly before continuing past them.

A satisfied smile touched Victoria's lips. It seemed Evelyn's condition wasn't serious.

Just as she turned to leave, a familiar figure in a white coat caught her eye on the second floor. Her breath hitched.

Could that truly be Julian?

What was Julian Montgomery doing in Bern City? He was supposed to be practicing in Nord City.

Without thinking, Victoria dashed inside, ignoring Penelope's confused calls.

"I just need the restroom," Victoria tossed over her shoulder. "Wait here."

Pulling out her phone, she quickly dialed Julian's number as she disappeared into the hospital corridors.
###Chapter 127

Evelyn searched for Julian, but her repeated calls to his phone went straight to voicemail.

Had she been mistaken about her suspicions?

Yet, the figure in the white coat had looked eerily similar to him.

Inside the emergency room’s infusion area, Evelyn lay on the bed.

The earlier ordeal had left her drenched in sweat, but now she was slowly regaining her composure.

"Evelyn, it's time you told me the truth. What's really going on?" Julian's stern voice cut through the silence.

As Evelyn took a sip of water, she glanced up to see Julian entering the room. The sudden sight of him startled her, making her choke.

Acting swiftly, Julian gently patted her back. "Careful. Let me get you another glass."

Evelyn coughed, her eyes glistening with unshed tears as she looked at him with vulnerability.

Seeing his sister’s expression, Julian’s initial frustration melted into concern. He sighed deeply, pulling a chair closer to her bedside.

"Evelyn, I’m not here to scold you. I’m worried. You dropped the news about your pregnancy so suddenly. How did you expect me to react?"

After everything they’d done to find her—their lost princess—and bring her back into the Montgomery family, they had hoped she would live a life of peace and comfort.

By the time she reached her thirties and considered marriage, her brothers had assumed they would be the ones to vet any potential suitor.

But then came the shocking revelation—she was already pregnant.

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "I know, but this all happened before you even found me."

"Evelyn, tell me who the father is. I just want to have a... civil conversation with him. As your brother, I deserve to know," Julian pressed.

Beneath his composed exterior, anger simmered.

If not for Evelyn’s feelings, he would have already tracked the man down and made him regret ever hurting his sister.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Julian, that’s in the past. I don’t want to talk about it."

"You don’t have to be afraid. You have Andrew, a lawyer with connections to the best legal minds in the city. We’ll make sure he faces consequences."

Evelyn frowned, confused. Had Julian misunderstood?

Meeting his gaze, she clarified, "Lawyers won’t change anything. I chose to keep the baby after we broke up. He doesn’t even know the child exists."

Julian exhaled in relief, his worst fears—that she had been mistreated—easing slightly.

But at the mention of a breakup, his expression darkened.

"Who would be foolish enough to leave you?"

Julian held Evelyn in the highest regard. To him, she was perfection. Only an idiot would fail to see her worth.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I had feelings for him once, but it became too painful. I chose to walk away and leave it all behind."

"Julian, please, I don’t want to revisit those memories or talk about him anymore."

She couldn’t risk Julian confronting Nathaniel. That would only bring disaster.

After all, the Whitmore family was the most powerful in Bern City, with influence that stretched far and wide.

Julian’s brow furrowed. "Is the child Nathaniel’s?"

Evelyn froze. How had he guessed? Had he seen Nathaniel escorting her to the hospital earlier?

Quickly, she shook her head. "No, it’s not his."

"Then why was Nathaniel with you today?"

"I fainted at the boutique where I work. He happened to be there on a security check. Recognizing me from when I cared for Eleanor, he helped me."
###Chapter 128

Evelyn had swiftly concocted a plausible excuse.

Noticing Julian's lingering suspicion, she deftly steered the conversation elsewhere. "Julian, how did you know it was Nathaniel who accompanied me to the hospital?"

Even though Evelyn had mentioned her role as a caregiver in a wealthy household, Nathaniel had been discreet about the matter.

So how had Julian immediately deduced it was him?

A flicker of hesitation crossed Julian's face.

Could it be that Julian was familiar with Nathaniel because of Victoria's long-standing infatuation with him?

Naturally, revealing such a connection to his sister was out of the question.

After a brief pause, Julian replied, "The registration and payment records displayed the name 'Nathaniel.' One glance was all it took for me to recognize it."

Realization struck Evelyn. She hadn’t known Nathaniel had covered her medical expenses.

Her fingers brushed lightly over her stomach, gratitude swelling in her chest. If Julian hadn’t appeared unexpectedly, hiding her pregnancy today would have been nearly impossible.

Had Nathaniel insisted she take the prescribed medication, she might have been forced to reveal the truth—for the sake of her unborn child.

Julian’s gaze dropped to her abdomen. "Evelyn, are you planning to keep the baby?"

Her hand stilled, resolve hardening in her voice. "Yes, Julian. I’ve made my decision. I’ll work tirelessly to provide for us."

"It’s not just about finances, Evelyn. Why would you want to keep the child of a man like that?"

"Because for the first time," she confessed softly, "I won’t be alone."

A sharp pang twisted Julian’s heart. He briefly shielded his face before regaining his composure. "If that’s truly what you want, then so be it."

"By the way, Julian, I haven’t told anyone about the pregnancy—not even Aunt Margaret. Will you keep this between us?"

"Of course. And for now, it’s best not to tell Alexander either. He’s usually understanding, but he can be impulsive. I don’t want him pressuring you into a hasty decision."

"Don’t take this the wrong way, but Alexander might have reservations about you becoming a single mother," Julian added carefully.

Evelyn nodded gratefully. "I understand. Thank you, Julian."

For her, this wasn’t just about single motherhood—it was about navigating the stigma of being an unwed mother.

The two roles were inextricably linked.

A yawn escaped her as drowsiness crept in. Her gaze flicked to Julian’s pocket. "Julian, I noticed your phone lighting up earlier. Did someone call you?"

Julian glanced briefly at the missed call from Victoria.

A shadow of remorse flickered in his eyes before he pocketed the device. "Nothing urgent. You should focus on resting and staying hydrated."

Taking his advice, Evelyn sipped some water before settling back.

Julian lingered nearby, his gaze drifting again to her stomach. A storm of emotions churned inside him.

God forbid he ever discovered the identity of the child’s father.

If the truth came out, the consequences would be catastrophic.

The mere thought ignited a seething rage within him.

As Isabelle approached the infusion room to speak to Julian, he stepped out, cutting her off. "What is it?"

"Dr. Montgomery, there’s someone here to see you. She claims to be your sister," Isabelle relayed.

A frown creased Julian’s brow. "I’m occupied right now. I don’t have time."

His distrust of the Whitmore family ran deep at the moment.

Just earlier, Nathaniel had gone out of his way to accompany Evelyn to the hospital.

Would a man of Nathaniel’s standing—the heir to a prestigious family—involve himself with a mere caregiver?

As a man, Julian recognized Nathaniel’s ulterior motives with perfect clarity.

Had it been anyone else, he might have overlooked it. But when it came to Evelyn, the stakes were entirely different.

How could someone like Nathaniel ever be suitable for his sister?

Yet just as Julian turned to leave, Victoria stepped out of the nearby elevator, locking eyes with him in a silent, unyielding stare.
###Chapter 129

Victoria's eyes widened when she spotted Julian across the hospital corridor. Her heels clicked rapidly against the polished floors as she rushed toward him. "Julian! I can't believe it's really you here in Bern City!"

Julian's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. He took a deliberate step back, positioning himself further from the examination room where Evelyn might emerge.

A wave of regret washed over him. Why had he ever agreed to Alexander's suggestion of bringing Victoria into their family as an adopted sister?

Every encounter with his biological sister Evelyn now filled him with gnawing guilt.

Studying Victoria's eager expression, Julian realized their relationship lacked genuine emotional depth.

Victoria had always lived separately with Eleanor, rarely interacting with him and his brothers. Their sibling bond was superficial at best.

Yet since childhood, Victoria had constantly sought their approval through exaggerated displays of affection. This persistent behavior only deepened Julian's indifference toward her.

"Julian, why are you staring at me like that?" Victoria forced a laugh, touching her cheek self-consciously. "Do I have something on my face?"

"Nothing important." Julian crossed his arms. "Why were you looking for me?"

"I've been trying to reach you for days!" Victoria's voice took on a pleading tone. "You ignored all my calls and messages. Finding you here in Bern City... this must be fate!"

Seeing Julian in the city reignited Victoria's hopes. Could his presence mean he was reconsidering the surgery for Eleanor?

Julian's expression remained impassive. "I've been occupied with work."

"Julian, I understand why you kept your visit secret." Victoria lowered her voice conspiratorially. "But I truly love Nathaniel. If you perform his grandmother's surgery, he'll finally agree to marry me. I've never asked you for anything before. Please do this one thing for me?"

She batted her eyelashes, adopting a pitiful slouch that made her appear smaller.

At Nathaniel's name, Julian's posture stiffened. "Absolutely not."

If Victoria married Nathaniel, the Montgomery and Whitmore families would be forced to interact regularly. And what exactly did she see in that arrogant businessman anyway?

Victoria's smile faltered. "Julian, why not? The Whitmores are one of Bern City's most prominent families. Nathaniel is brilliant and successful. We'd be perfectly matched."

"He's divorced."

"That doesn't matter to me."

"It matters to me." Julian's voice turned glacial. "Victoria, I'll say this clearly - I won't perform the surgery, and I don't support this marriage. This is for your own good."

Without waiting for a response, he turned on his heel and strode away, leaving Victoria standing alone, her face darkening with frustration.

As she watched Julian disappear down the corridor, Victoria puzzled over his vehement opposition.

Yet beneath her confusion flickered a spark of hope - Julian's resistance seemed rooted in protective concern. That meant his stance could still be changed.

After all, she was the darling of the Montgomery family.

She immediately dialed Gregory, her assistant. "Gregory, Julian has been at Bern City General for weeks. Why wasn't I informed?"

"I'm sorry, Ms. Sinclair. Dr. Montgomery values his privacy and rarely keeps assistants. Tracking his movements, especially when he doesn't want to be found, is nearly impossible."

"This is unacceptable!" Victoria hissed. "Find out why Julian is in Bern City and investigate any past connections between him and Nathaniel. Leave no stone unturned."

She ended the call with an exasperated sigh.

Beyond the incident three years ago, what other reason could Julian have for despising Nathaniel so intensely?
###Chapter 130

The disapproval radiating from Julian Montgomery toward Nathaniel Whitmore had only grown more intense with each passing day.



Evelyn Carter stirred awake, the sharp scent of hospital antiseptic instantly telling her where she was.

She was still in the hospital.

This belongs to N?velDrama.Org: ?

Still, she felt better.

Julian’s recommended medicine had clearly worked.

"Ms. Carter, you're awake. Would you like help to the restroom, or should I bring you something to eat?"

Evelyn blinked at the unfamiliar woman beside her. "Who are you?"

"I'm Margaret O'Connor, the caregiver your family arranged for you."

It must have been Julian’s doing.

Her stomach growled. "Could you get me some broth? Something light, please."

Just then, Julian walked in, carrying a food container. "Evelyn, you must be hungry. I brought you lunch."

Evelyn gestured to Margaret. "Julian, didn’t you already send Ms. O'Connor to get me food?"

Julian frowned. "I didn’t hire a caregiver for you."

Evelyn turned to Margaret. "Are you sure you have the right patient?"

Margaret checked her notes. "No mistake. You're Evelyn Carter in bed three."

"Then," Evelyn pressed, "who hired you? Did they leave a name?"

"Yes. The last name was Whitmore."

Nathaniel?

Evelyn’s pulse jumped. Nathaniel had arranged this? A storm of questions swirled in her mind—why would he do that?

At the mention of Nathaniel’s name, Julian’s expression turned icy.

It was obvious Nathaniel had his own agenda. Hiring a caregiver for Evelyn only confirmed it.

Julian’s voice was steel. "Your services aren’t needed here. You can leave."



Annoyed, Margaret quickly dialed the person who had hired her. "Hello, I just spoke with Ms. Carter in bed three."

"She insists she doesn’t need a caregiver. Make sure I’m paid for the time I’ve already spent."

On the other end, Robert Chambers sounded confused. "Why would she refuse? It’s mealtime. Did you at least make sure she ate?"

"She seems… close with Dr. Montgomery," Margaret remarked. "Since he’s handling her meals, an extra caregiver isn’t necessary."

Her tone turned pointed. "Ms. Carter must be special. Dr. Montgomery is highly respected here, yet I’ve never seen him this attentive with any other patient."

Robert’s stomach twisted. How was he supposed to relay this to Nathaniel?

After settling Margaret’s payment, Robert returned to the office, where Nathaniel was buried in paperwork.

Robert hesitated. How to break this gently?

Noticing his assistant’s unease, Nathaniel glanced up. "Problem?"

Robert cleared his throat. "Ms. O'Connor reached out about compensation."

"Does that mean Evelyn’s being discharged early?"

"Not exactly. It’s… complicated. You should hear the recording." Robert handed over his phone, bracing himself.

The tension in the room thickened as Nathaniel listened.

His grip tightened on the phone. He had underestimated Evelyn’s appeal.

No wonder the doctor had been so hostile toward him.

"Dig up everything on that doctor," Nathaniel ordered coldly.

As Robert took the phone back, an incoming call flashed—Grandma.

Nathaniel answered. "Hello, Grandma."

"Nathaniel, isn’t it time for Evelyn’s prenatal check-up?"
###Chapter 131

Nathaniel's brows arched slightly at the mention of the prenatal checkup. He had nearly forgotten Evelyn's supposed "pregnancy."

"Understood." His reply was deliberately vague.

"What exactly do you understand?" Eleanor's voice crackled through the phone, sharp with disapproval. "You would've completely overlooked it if I hadn't reminded you, wouldn't you?"

"Bring Evelyn to my hospital tomorrow for her prenatal appointment," Eleanor commanded before abruptly ending the call.

Nathaniel massaged his temples, then turned to Robert. "Schedule an appointment with the OB-GYN department for tomorrow. Make sure Grandmother doesn’t catch wind of it."

Robert nodded briskly and hurried out of the office.

Nathaniel pulled out his phone and typed a message to Evelyn. "Be at the hospital tomorrow morning. Grandmother wants to see you."

Meanwhile, Evelyn finally felt human again after eating a proper meal in her hospital room.

Julian stood beside her bed, handing her a small bag. "Take these medications home. The pregnancy test results aren’t back yet. I’ll notify you as soon as they are."

"Go home and rest. Don’t overexert yourself at work. And don’t forget your folic acid."

"Got it." Evelyn hesitated, then frowned. "Julian, I’ve been meaning to ask—weren’t you supposed to be a veterinarian?"

It struck her as odd that she’d run into him here, in what was clearly not a veterinary clinic.

He rubbed the bridge of his nose, chuckling awkwardly. "That was just a joke. I wanted to be a vet, but reality had other plans."

Evelyn nodded, conceding the point.

Julian quickly changed the subject. "I’m on duty today, but I’ve already asked Daniel to pick you up. He just wrapped up filming."

Before she could decline, her phone buzzed. Daniel’s voice came through, bright and cheerful. "Evelyn, I’m pulling into the hospital parking lot. Be there in a sec."

The memory of paparazzi swarming him flashed in her mind. Instinctively, she grabbed a mask from her bag and slipped it on.

Spotting a sleek black MPV idling near the elevator, she hurried over and climbed inside.

She scanned the surroundings warily. "Daniel, are you sure no reporters followed you this time?"

He grinned, unfazed. "Relax. My driver shook them off. Julian told me you had a fever. Work stress? You should quit. I can take care of you."

Evelyn laughed. "It’s just a cold. By the way, your movie looks amazing. I can’t wait to see it."

His eyes lit up. "The action sequences are mostly mine. You’ll see how badass I am!"

Her smile faltered when she noticed the fresh wound on his forearm. "Daniel, that award-winning co-star of yours is ridiculous. Why couldn’t he do his own stunts instead of making you take the risk?"

She huffed. "And then he gets all the credit, pretending he did everything himself. It’s not fair to you!"

Julian’s manager choked on his water, coughing violently. Julian himself looked torn between amusement and guilt.

Daniel waved it off. "It’s fine. They pay me well." He leaned in conspiratorially. "Hey, how about joining a variety show? There’s one called A Celebrity Dream in the works—designers team up with celebrities to renovate houses."

Evelyn shook her head. "No thanks. Between my studies and the studio, I’m swamped."

Daniel sighed dramatically. "Worth a shot."

Julian smirked, already plotting other ways to drag her into the entertainment world.

By the time Evelyn got home, Margaret had already heard about her hospitalization.

Margaret fussed over her, serving a bowl of warm, slightly sweet porridge.

Not long after, Alexander video-called, his face lined with concern. "Evelyn, I just heard you were sick. Are you okay?"
###Chapter 132

Evelyn wore a cheerful expression, assuring Nathaniel that it was just a minor cold, nothing life-threatening.

Still, the warmth of her family's concern wrapped around her like a soft blanket.

After ending the video call, she settled into bed, hoping sleep would come. But rest eluded her.

She reached for her phone, scrolling through WhatsApp messages until one from Nathaniel caught her eye.

She had missed it earlier while talking to her family.

Maintaining the charade for Eleanor's sake, she replied with a simple, "Got it."

Closing her eyes, Evelyn recalled the wedding dress she'd seen at Victoria's boutique. The pristine white fabric had stung her vision like salt in a wound.

Thankfully, one month wasn't an eternity.

It would pass soon enough.

The next morning, Evelyn headed straight to the private hospital where Eleanor was staying.

As she slid into the backseat of a cab, Sophia's message popped up. "Evelyn, you're the one in the mask, aren't you?"

"And you swore you had nothing to do with that A-list actor. I gave you that tote bag for your birthday last year."

A knot of dread twisted in her stomach.

Evelyn tapped the trending article. Just as she'd feared—she was entangled in another scandal with the famous actor!

"After Wrapping Filming, Award-Winning Actor Returns Home with Mystery Girlfriend"

A single glance at the photo confirmed it was taken outside their neighborhood.

Now the acclaimed actor apparently had a girlfriend without even knowing it himself.

Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

She'd clarified her position before, but now? She couldn't be bothered.

In show business, truth and fiction blurred together. No one took these stories seriously anyway.

"Evelyn, I'm not the only one who recognized you. Our classmates are blowing up the group chat asking if it's you."

She exhaled slowly, grateful she'd worn the mask leaving the hospital yesterday.

Without it, she'd be public enemy number one right now.

Then, with a smirk, she retweeted the article. "Time to come clean—yes, that's me. I'm his girlfriend."

Likes poured in instantly.

Most took it as a joke rather than truth. They simply thought she bore a resemblance to the woman in the photo.

Exactly as Evelyn had predicted.

After all, why would a megastar like him date someone outside the industry like her?

Stepping off the elevator, she spotted a tall figure in the corridor deep in conversation with a doctor.

Her steps hitched briefly before she continued toward them.

Robert noticed her first. "Mr. Whitmore, she's arrived."

Nathaniel turned, his gaze sweeping over her. "You're late."

"You said morning. You didn't specify a time," Evelyn fired back without hesitation.

Now that he was engaged to Victoria, she refused to bite her tongue at his condescending tone.

His lips thinned. "I knew it. You've found a new target. Your attitude toward me has changed."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Playing dumb? Who was that arrogant doctor yesterday? What's your relationship with him?"

Her eyes widened. So Nathaniel had misunderstood her connection with Julian.

Mockery danced in her eyes as a smirk curved her lips. "Mr. Whitmore, I know you're an important man, but not an omniscient one. Am I wrong?"

"Consider this a friendly warning. Don't mistake that doctor's intentions. He's quite the heartthrob here—female doctors, nurses, patients, they all adore him."

"His kindness? Just his way of getting you into bed."

Evelyn nearly choked on laughter. "How flattering. That means he's charming enough to have options."

She made a mental note to ask Julian why someone so popular remained single.

Turning away, she announced, "I'm going to see Grandma now."

"Wait." His voice stopped her. "Prenatal tests first."

At those words, her expression flickered.
###Chapter 133

Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief. "What prenatal test?"

Her pulse quickened. Had Nathaniel discovered her secret?

"Have you forgotten your condition?" His voice was smooth as silk. "Grandmother Eleanor arranged this appointment. Just play along for her sake."

Only then did Evelyn exhale. "There's no need. I'll tell her I already had it done."

"Impossible." Nathaniel stepped closer, his breath warm against her ear. "She'll demand test results and ultrasound images. You're taking this test today."

Her fingers trembled. "Your family owns this hospital. Can't you just... fabricate the records?"

Nathaniel's grip tightened on her shoulders as he nodded toward the hallway. "See Victoria Hawthorne over there?"

Evelyn followed his gaze to the nurse station. "What about her?"

"You disappeared from campus for days. She reported it to Grandmother." His jaw tightened. "Now Eleanor suspects trouble between us."

"So this whole test..." Evelyn swallowed hard. "It's just theater?"

"Exactly." His eyes darkened. "Just follow the script."

After a tense moment, she nodded. "Fine."

Victoria couldn't enter the examination room anyway. Whatever the results, Nathaniel would control the narrative.

The doctor led Evelyn downstairs. As expected, the examination room already contained their carefully staged scene - another pregnant woman waiting to provide the necessary results.

Nathaniel's planning was flawless.

One hour later, Evelyn emerged clutching fake documents. She ascended to Eleanor's suite.

"My dear!" Eleanor grasped Evelyn's hands. "You're wasting away! A pregnant woman shouldn't overwork herself. Let that husband of yours carry the burden!"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Of course, Grandmother."

"And you must eat properly! I intend to meet this great-grandchild before joining my late husband."

Noticing Eleanor's fatigue, Evelyn soon excused herself.

In the corridor, she turned to Nathaniel. "When's the surgery?"

"Month's end." His gaze never wavered.

Evelyn tilted her chin up. "Congratulations on your engagement. But a word of advice - keep it quiet. Wouldn't want Grandmother finding out through gossip."

"I don't need your reminders about discretion," he snapped.

"Of course not. You're the master of secrets." She turned sharply, blinking back tears.

"Wait."

Evelyn froze, her pulse hammering. Slowly, she faced him. "Yes?"

Nathaniel's lips parted just as the elevator doors slid open.

Beatrice Harrington's perfectly manicured hand shot out, stopping the doors. Her smile vanished upon seeing Evelyn. "You! Stay away from my mother!"

Evelyn met her glare evenly. "Relax. I want her surgery to succeed more than anyone."
###Chapter 134

"At least you have some decency left." Beatrice's sharp gaze then landed on Nathaniel.

"Nathaniel, Victoria mentioned her brother is visiting Bern City. Let's arrange a dinner together. We should also discuss your engagement."

"Given both our families' statuses, this requires thorough consideration."

Nathaniel's eyes flickered toward Evelyn, his expression unreadable.

She didn’t glance back. Not even once.

A bitter smirk tugged at his lips. Whether their engagement was real or fake meant nothing to her.

After all, she had already moved on—not with one man, but two. She handled it effortlessly.

Logically, this should have been a relief. No more pestering, no more complications.

Yet, the satisfaction he expected never came.

Beatrice turned on Evelyn, her voice dripping with disdain. "Listen carefully—Nathaniel is marrying Victoria soon. They’re the ideal match, unlike you."

Evelyn forced a smile. "I’m aware. You don’t need to repeat it like a broken record. People might mistake you for a parrot."

Her gaze finally met his, defiance burning in her eyes.

The elevator doors slid shut, cutting off their silent battle.

Only then did she slump against the wall, a hollow laugh escaping her lips.

She was mocking herself.

By the end of the month, once the surgery was over, everything would finally end.

The weight in her chest lingered all the way home.

Julian emerged from the kitchen, holding a steaming bowl. "Evelyn, I made you chicken soup. The test results came back—you need the nutrients."

She grabbed his arm, lowering her voice. "Quiet!"

"Relax. Aunt Margaret isn’t home."

A sigh of relief escaped her.

"Is there an issue with the prenatal results?"

"The baby’s fine. The real problem is you—you’re undernourished. Eat more."

Evelyn eyed the soup. The rich aroma made her stomach growl.

She devoured it, savoring every drop.

Julian’s phone buzzed again.

"Your phone won’t stop ringing. Hospital emergency?"

He glanced at the screen—Victoria.

He set it aside. "I get calls constantly. Ignore it. I’m off-duty."

"What if it’s urgent?"

"If it were, they’d call the emergency line."

He knew why Victoria was calling. But he refused to take that surgery.

He wasn’t the only capable doctor in the world.

Besides, he despised the idea of his sister marrying into the Whitmore family.

Evelyn, oblivious, smiled as he fussed over her meal.

Initially, she’d worried about raising the baby alone.

But Julian’s steady presence eased those fears.

His phone screen lit up again—missed calls piling up.

He ignored every one.

Annoyance simmered inside him.

Were the Whitmores that special? He’d made his stance clear to Victoria. Why couldn’t she let go of Nathaniel?

A divorced man, still hung up on Evelyn. Bringing her to the hospital, hiring caretakers—what a hypocrite.

Meanwhile, Victoria stood outside a private lounge, her phone nearly dead from frantic dialing.

"Why isn’t Julian answering? Did you check the hospital?" Her face was pale with frustration.
###Chapter 135



Victoria clenched her phone so tightly her knuckles turned white. She barely resisted the urge to hurl it across the room.

Her assistant’s timid voice came through. "I confirmed with the hospital. He’s not on duty tonight."

"Then why isn’t he answering his damn phone?" Victoria’s irritation flared. "Does he suddenly think he’s too good for dinner with me?"

The truth was, Julian hadn’t outright rejected her. That was why she had orchestrated this dinner—to set her plans in motion.

Yet, he hadn’t shown up.

Her gaze flickered toward the private dining room, where Nathaniel and Beatrice waited.

They were here for him.

If he didn’t come, what then?

She shot her assistant a venomous glare. "I told you to dig up any history between Julian and Nathaniel. Anything?"

The assistant shrank back. "Nothing so far."

Victoria slapped her. "Useless! Incompetent waste! If your incompetence ruins this, I’ll have you all fired!"

The outburst eased some of her frustration.

Taking a deep breath, she smoothed her expression and stepped into the room. "Let’s start without him."

Beatrice shook her head. "We can’t. It’s our first time meeting him. Starting without him would be rude."

Nathaniel’s cold eyes locked onto Victoria. "How much longer?"

If not for Julian’s supposed attendance, he wouldn’t have bothered coming at all.

"Julian wanted to be here," Victoria lied smoothly, "but you know how unpredictable hospitals are. An emergency case came up. He couldn’t just abandon a patient, could he?"

Nathaniel’s piercing stare made her skin prickle with unease.

Beatrice, ever the peacemaker, interjected, "She’s right. He’s a renowned surgeon. Emergencies are part of the job. We can reschedule."

Relief washed over Victoria. "Exactly."

Beatrice smiled. "This isn’t a problem. As long as your brother agrees to the surgery, we’re fine waiting."

Victoria lowered her lashes, feigning calm. "He’s agreed. But he still has… reservations about Nathaniel."

Beatrice sighed. "We can’t change the past. But my son has divorced that woman. Things will return to how they should be."

A sly smile curled Victoria’s lips.

Nathaniel abruptly stood. "Since he’s not coming, I’m leaving."

"At least finish your meal," Beatrice protested.

But he was already striding toward the exit.

Victoria rushed after him. "Nathaniel!"

He didn’t look back.

Her eyes darkened with malice as she watched him go.

She wasn’t giving up. Not yet.

Days later, Evelyn had fully recovered from her illness.

Daniel handed her two tickets with a grin. "Ever been to a charity auction?"

Evelyn eyed them skeptically. "Aren’t those just for the obscenely wealthy?"

"These were meant for a certain A-list actor, but he bailed. So now I’m stuck going." He winked. "Want to join? We’ll just buy a few things and call it a night."
###Chapter 136



"Alright." Evelyn nodded, agreeing to accompany Daniel to the event. It would mark her first attendance at a high-profile charity auction.

The moment he got her confirmation, Daniel immediately texted their family group chat "The Montgomery Clan". "Contacting Alexander for sponsorship. Evelyn agreed to join me at the charity gala."

Within seconds, five separate wire transfers hit his account - all designated as Evelyn's spending money for the auction.

Daniel whistled at the notifications flooding his phone. "Thanks for the support, brothers. You're the best."

Andrew's reply came instantly: "No funny business or you'll be hearing from our legal team."

A tearful emoji was Daniel's only response, genuinely hurt by his brother's lack of trust.

If there existed a list of people Daniel would never scheme against, Evelyn's name would be written in bold at the very top.

That evening, Evelyn found herself walking into the glittering charity auction on Daniel's arm.

The parade of luxury vehicles lining the entrance confirmed her suspicions - this was an exclusive gathering for the elite.

"Evelyn, if anything catches your eye tonight, just bid for it," Daniel whispered as they entered.

She blinked in surprise. "Daniel, aren't we here to purchase items for that actor's charity?"

"It's his foundation's money anyway," Daniel shrugged. "He won't miss a few extra zeros."

"That doesn't seem right." No matter how she looked at it, recklessly spending someone else's funds felt unethical.

Such behavior simply wasn't in her nature.

They continued chatting as they approached the main hall.

Suddenly, Daniel pressed a bidding paddle into her hands. "Nature calls. Find our seats according to this number, will you?"

Evelyn nodded, scanning the room for their designated area when an overpowering floral scent assaulted her senses.

Frowning, she turned to find Penelope standing beside Victoria.

Her hand dropped from her nose in stunned disbelief at this unfortunate encounter.

"Evelyn Carter? What are you doing here?" Penelope marched over, eyeing Evelyn's modest dress with disdain. "Do you even understand what kind of event this is?"

"It's a charity auction," Evelyn replied calmly.

Penelope deliberately flaunted her designer clutch. "Exactly. Every item here starts at six figures."



"Amounts you'll never see in your pathetic bank account even after decades of scrubbing floors. What gives you the right to be here?"

Evelyn remained unfazed. "Certainly not you."

Victoria chimed in with false sweetness, "Now Penelope, even commoners deserve cultural experiences."

"True," Penelope sneered. "This might be the only time trash like her gets to see how the other half lives."

"Evelyn Carter, consider this your warning - Nathaniel and I are getting married this weekend. Make sure that renovation finishes on time."

Victoria's smile dripped with smug satisfaction.

Evelyn's expression remained neutral. "You're addressing the wrong person, ladies. I'm not in charge of that property."

"How dare you speak to us like that!" Penelope bristled at Evelyn's composure.

Just then, Victoria called out excitedly, "Nathaniel!"

Evelyn glanced up to see Nathaniel entering the venue in a light linen suit paired with a slate gray tie - an ensemble she'd personally selected years ago.

Back when they were together, Nathaniel only wore dark colors, so she'd filled his wardrobe with lighter shades.

Yet she'd never seen him wear any of them.

The pale fabric made him look younger, more approachable.

Though to be fair, a man that handsome would look good in anything.

Still, the sight shocked her - she'd long given up hope of ever seeing him in the clothes she'd chosen for him.
###Chapter 137

Evelyn's gaze locked onto Nathaniel the moment he approached. She couldn't tear her eyes away from his suit.

She was almost certain it was the same one she'd chosen for him months ago.

Back when Victoria hadn't reappeared in their lives. Back when divorce wasn't even a whispered possibility.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed instantly when he spotted the bidding number clutched in Evelyn's hand.

Victoria clung to his arm with a saccharine smile. "Nathaniel, what a surprise to see Ms. Carter here! Penelope and I found it quite... unusual, so we were just having a little chat with her."

Penelope eagerly piled on. "She must be sleeping with someone important. There's no way someone like her could afford to be here otherwise."

"Some people never learn their place," Victoria added with a mocking laugh. "Forever chasing fairy tales."

Evelyn's expression turned glacial.

Daniel's derisive snort came from behind her. "No wonder I caught such a foul stench from across the room. Not even that industrial-strength perfume can mask the rot coming from your mouths."

"You should consider gargling bleach before leaving the house," he continued smoothly. "Those innocent flowers outside don't deserve to wilt from your toxicity."

Penelope's face turned scarlet beneath layers of makeup. "Nathaniel! Did you hear how he spoke to me?"

Nathaniel's eyes turned arctic when he registered Daniel's presence. So this was Evelyn's companion.

The way Evelyn glanced over her shoulder at Daniel, her lips curving in amusement, sent an unfamiliar pang through Nathaniel's chest.

Daniel had always possessed a razor-sharp wit that never failed to delight Evelyn. Today, he'd voiced exactly what she'd been thinking.

He positioned himself casually beside Evelyn, sizing up Nathaniel with undisguised assessment.

Just days ago, Julian had mentioned Evelyn collapsing from illness—and how Nathaniel had rushed her to the hospital, even hiring private care.

As a man himself, Daniel recognized Nathaniel's actions for what they were.

But by Daniel's standards? Nathaniel Whitmore wasn't fit to lick Evelyn's boots.

Daniel flashed a dazzling, dangerous smile. "You should keep your rabid dogs on a tighter leash, Mr. Whitmore. Let them run loose, and one day they might turn on their master."

Nathaniel's lips thinned. "I don't require lessons from you."

The crackling tension between the men made Evelyn's pulse skyrocket.

This was Nathaniel freaking Whitmore! And Daniel was openly provoking him!

Touched by Daniel's defense but fearing escalation, she tugged his sleeve. "Let's go. The auction's about to start."

Daniel allowed himself to be led away, though not without throwing one last challenging look at Nathaniel.

Victoria immediately began damage control. "Don't let him get to you, darling. Daniel's always been like this—his mouth constantly writing checks his career can't cash."

"That's why he stays out of the spotlight in Nord City," she purred. "One viral video of his temper, and his precious reputation crumbles."

Penelope looked confused. "I thought he was that actor's stunt double?"

Victoria waved a dismissive hand. "Please. That's my cousin, Daniel Montgomery. The stuntman story is just PR smoke—his agency's way of shielding him from scandals."

Penelope's lips curled in disgust. "Typical Evelyn. Barely divorced and already climbing into Daniel Montgomery's bed. What could he possibly see in her? Unless..." Her suggestive smirk said the rest.
###Chapter 138

Nathaniel turned his head sharply, his voice laced with icy disapproval. "Mind your manners, Penelope Whitmore. Years of upbringing wasted if this is how you behave. No amount of perfume can mask that foul attitude of yours."

Penelope gaped at him, stunned. "Nathaniel!"

"If you can't speak properly, then stay silent. You're embarrassing yourself." His words were cutting as he strode away without another glance.

Victoria hesitated for only a moment before following him.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Daniel were still searching for their seats.

Daniel studied her carefully. "Evelyn, tell me the truth—did they treat you poorly when you worked for the Whitmores?"

Her lashes flickered downward briefly. "No. Mrs. Whitmore was kind to me. No one dared to mistreat me."

"But the way Penelope acted just now—I can tell she wasn't exactly welcoming." His jaw tightened. "Don't worry. I'll make sure she regrets it."

"It's not like that, Daniel," Evelyn said quickly, not wanting him to provoke the Whitmores on her behalf.

This was exactly why she hadn’t told her brothers about her marriage to Nathaniel.

How could she stand by and let Daniel retaliate against Penelope? No matter how spiteful Penelope was, she was still a Whitmore.

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to dissuade him, she caught sight of Nathaniel approaching. Her lips pressed together in silence.

Daniel followed her gaze, noticing the two empty seats beside them.

He scoffed under his breath. "What are the odds?"

Some things felt like fate, as if the universe itself had orchestrated them.

Evelyn stiffened slightly as Nathaniel took the seat beside her, Victoria settling next to him.

She could just barely catch the faintest trace of his cologne—so subtle she might have missed it if she weren’t paying attention.

It was the scent she had chosen for him, believing it would suit him perfectly.

Yet, he had never worn it before. Just like the suits she had picked out—untouched, unworn.

Her breath hitched when she recognized the fragrance.

Nathaniel was acting out of character today.

Not only was he dressed in the light-colored suit she had selected, but he was also wearing the cologne she had crafted for him.

A strange mix of emotions swirled inside her, leaving her unsettled.

Victoria, noticing Evelyn’s presence, decided to strike up a conversation. "Nathaniel, you’re different today. Light colors and cologne? That’s new."

His reply was stiff. "No."

"Don’t be modest," Victoria teased. "There’s nothing wrong with a man wearing cologne. And this one suits you. What brand is it?"

"I don’t know." His tone was flat.

Evelyn glanced at him discreetly. Of course he didn’t know—she had blended it herself, experimenting until she’d perfected the scent.

There was only one bottle of it in existence.

Before long, an overpowering floral perfume invaded their senses. It didn’t take a genius to guess who had arrived.

Penelope sat directly behind them, her furious gaze locked onto Daniel.

She couldn’t fathom how Evelyn had managed to attract such a distinguished man so quickly. Were all these men blind?

The auction was about to begin.

Victoria shot Evelyn a pointed look. "Ms. Carter, this must be your first time at an auction. Don’t be nervous."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her bidding paddle.

Daniel’s temper flared instantly.
###Chapter 139

Evelyn felt the tension radiating from Daniel like an electric current. She quickly grasped his hand, her fingers tightening around his. "Don't."

His glare burned into Victoria. "You wouldn't be here if it weren't for us. Remember your place."

Victoria's smile faltered, her carefully constructed mask slipping. The secret she guarded so fiercely—her adoption—threatened to surface.

Only a select few in Northridge knew the truth. Bernhaven remained blissfully ignorant.

That was why she adored Bernhaven. Here, she could reinvent herself, free from the whispers and judgmental stares of Northridge's elite.

The way they looked down on her, as if being adopted made her less.

It fueled her determination to secure a powerful match—someone like Nathaniel Whitmore.

Becoming Mrs. Whitmore would silence them all.

Victoria pressed her lips together, her silence conspicuous. Evelyn frowned, sensing something amiss.

A thought struck her—Daniel was still posing as Linden Sinclair. Would his behavior reflect poorly on the actor?

"Evelyn, take this." Daniel thrust the bidding paddle into her hands. "Buy whatever you want."

She hesitated, but the warmth of his protectiveness steadied her.

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on the paddle in her grasp, his jaw tightening.

With a dismissive flick, he tossed his own paddle aside.

The auction began.

Daniel's voice cut through the murmurs. "Evelyn, what about that Ming vase? Would it suit the penthouse?"

She tilted her head. "It clashes with the modern decor."

"Then this landscape? Margaret would love it for her sitting room."

Her eyes skimmed the painting. "It's lovely."

"Evelyn, look at that necklace. Stunning, isn't it?"

A brief glance. "Yes."

"Bid on whatever catches your eye. Enjoy yourself."

Beside them, Nathaniel tugged at his tie, the heat in the room suddenly stifling. Daniel's voice grated on his nerves.

This entire auction felt like a waste of time.

Yet when the next painting appeared, Nathaniel found himself raising his paddle—just after Daniel.

Evelyn shot him a questioning look. What game was he playing?

Daniel scoffed. "200 thousand."

"250," Nathaniel countered smoothly.

A sinking feeling settled in Evelyn's stomach. As predicted, Daniel upped the bid to 300 thousand, only for Nathaniel to add another 50.

Were they seriously competing over a painting?

Victoria noticed the silent duel too, her eyes darting between them before landing on Evelyn.

Unease coiled in Victoria's chest. Was Nathaniel doing this… because of her?

The bids climbed to 500 thousand—far exceeding the painting's worth.

The spectacle drew murmurs from the crowd.

Evelyn caught Daniel's wrist. "Stop."

But pride burned in his eyes. This wasn't just about art anymore.

Nathaniel raised it to 600 thousand.

In one swift move, Evelyn snatched the paddle from Daniel's grip. All eyes turned to her, waiting.

She met Nathaniel's dark gaze, holding it for a charged moment before smiling sweetly. "Since you want it so badly, it's yours."

Nathaniel's eyes flicked to Daniel. "Surrendering already?"

Daniel's temper flared. If not for Evelyn's grip, he would have shattered Nathaniel's smug composure.

She squeezed his hand, her voice calm but firm. "We're not fools who throw money away for pride."
###Chapter 140



N?velDrama.Org exclusive content.

Daniel let out a derisive chuckle before flashing Evelyn a warm smile. "Evelyn's absolutely right. You're brilliant! He's a complete fool."

Nathaniel, who had just secured the winning bid for the painting, could practically feel the weight of an invisible "idiot" sign hanging around his neck.

His fingers tightened around the bidding paddle until his knuckles turned white. The momentary victory soured into bitter frustration almost immediately.

Victoria discreetly signaled to an attendant nearby. "Please hold the painting for us. We'll complete the payment later."

Her eyes flickered toward Evelyn for a brief second as she added pointedly, "Auctions are about competition, after all. Nathaniel purchased this for Mrs. Whitmore Senior."

Evelyn simply maintained her composed smile, recognizing the transparent attempt to salvage Nathaniel's wounded pride.

Yet it did nothing to ease the storm brewing inside him.

The next item appeared - a dazzling diamond necklace with a starting bid of three hundred thousand dollars.

Daniel immediately exclaimed, "Evelyn, I'm getting that for you! It'll look perfect on you!"

Only a hopeless brother would think every single thing in the world suited his sister.

Before Evelyn could respond, Victoria's paddle shot up. "Four hundred thousand."

Daniel froze momentarily, irritation flashing across his features. "Why does everyone keep stealing gifts meant for Evelyn? When will this nonsense end?"

He raised his paddle sharply. "Five hundred thousand!"

The hundred-thousand-dollar bidding increments once again drew the crowd's rapt attention.

Victoria's smile tightened visibly. "Do you have particular interest in this piece, Mr. Montgomery?"

"If Evelyn likes it, then back off!" The earlier failed painting purchase still rankled him.

She didn't dare push further. If he exposed her orphanage origins publicly, her social standing in Bern City would be ruined.

Her painted smile remained fixed. "Very well, I'll withdraw."

Her gaze slid meaningfully toward Nathaniel.

Surely he could see Evelyn was clearly involved with someone new now.

With Victoria's concession, Daniel assumed victory was certain.

Until Nathaniel's paddle lifted again. "One million."

Even Evelyn stared at him in disbelief. Had he lost his mind?

The previous bid stood at five hundred thousand - he'd just doubled it!



Was this some kind of joke?

Penelope whispered urgently, "Ms. Montgomery, I'm certain Nathaniel intends that necklace for you. No doubt about it."

Victoria's smile grew strained. Was he really bidding for her?

Her instincts screamed otherwise - that diamond was meant for Evelyn.

Now another high-status man was showering Evelyn with attention. Could Nathaniel's pride tolerate such humiliation?

This was becoming deliciously complicated.

Meanwhile, Evelyn caught snippets of the women's conversation. Her lips twitched in amusement at Penelope's assumption.

She knew exactly who Nathaniel was bidding for.

Daniel's paddle rose again. "Two million."

The atmosphere crackled with electric tension.

Spectators lost interest in the auction items - this personal duel had become far more compelling.

Evelyn's pulse quickened at the astronomical sums. Why was Daniel indulging Nathaniel's ridiculous game?

She tried to intervene, but Daniel simply captured her hand, raising it with his paddle. Giving up wasn't an option.

Soon the bids escalated to five million dollars.

Blood pounded in Evelyn's ears, her heart threatening to burst from her chest.

Five million. From Daniel. An unimaginable sum.

The sight of Daniel holding Evelyn's hand made Nathaniel's jaw tighten. Without expression, he raised his paddle. "Ten million."
###Chapter 141

The audience erupted into chaos.

Daniel Montgomery's blood boiled at Nathaniel Whitmore's audacity.

Evelyn Carter stood frozen as Penelope Whitmore's mocking voice cut through the air. "Twelve million dollars now, Evelyn. Show us you can pay or face the consequences."

Before Evelyn could react, Daniel raised her bidding paddle decisively. "Fifteen million!"

Her breath caught. The amount was astronomical, yet Daniel appeared completely unruffled. Money meant nothing to the Montgomery brothers - they were walking vaults with limitless resources.

Victoria Sinclair's perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms. How dare that nobody Evelyn attract such devotion? The Montgomery fortune could buy entire city blocks without blinking.

Nathaniel's stormy expression darkened further as attendants approached Daniel for financial verification. "This way, sir. We require proof of funds for bids exceeding ten million."

Penelope smirked victoriously. "Finally exposed as frauds!"

Daniel merely adjusted his cufflinks. "Lead the way." No one in Nord City dared question the Montgomery wealth - Bern City's ignorance amused him.

Evelyn followed anxiously, unaware of Nathaniel's burning gaze tracking her movements. Victoria seized the opportunity to whisper poison. "How...quaint. A penniless orphan playing with millionaires. The Whitmores would never approve."

"Silence." Nathaniel's command sliced through the chatter as he stalked toward the verification area.

Inside the private lounge, Daniel squeezed Evelyn's shoulder reassuringly. "Wait here. This won't take long."

She paced outside the door, heart pounding. Fifteen million dollars! If the verification failed... Her imagination conjured images of Daniel in handcuffs.

"Having second thoughts?" Nathaniel's deep voice startled her.

Evelyn whirled around, meeting his piercing gaze. "Would you bail me out if I asked?"

His jaw tightened. "Do I look like a charity?"

The word sparked unexpected laughter. Before she could stop herself, Evelyn reached up to straighten his tie. Nathaniel froze, his breath hitching as her fingers brushed his collar.

Her boldness surprised them both. "Why are you really here, Nathaniel? Could it be...you still care?"

He recoiled as if burned. "Release me this instant!"

A cough interrupted them. Evelyn tightened the silk tie just enough to make his eyes widen. "Careful, Mr. Whitmore. Your concern is showing."

His Adam's apple bobbed. "You're playing with fire."

"And yet," she whispered, leaning closer, "you're the one who followed me." The air between them crackled with unspoken tension as Daniel's voice called from down the hall.

###Chapter 142

Evelyn finally released Nathaniel's collar. Her fingers lingered as she straightened his tie with a tenderness that felt surreal to him.

The gesture transported him back to their early days when she'd fuss over his appearance and ensure he ate properly.

A flicker of emotion crossed his features, momentarily erasing the memory of her hands around his throat moments earlier.

The door creaked open. Daniel emerged from the private room. "Evelyn."

His entire body tensed when he saw her standing so close to Nathaniel.

In three swift strides, Daniel inserted himself between them, breaking their proximity.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. Evelyn's fingers twitched nervously as she met Daniel's gaze. "Did everything go smoothly?"

"Payment's processed. They're delivering the necklace to the penthouse later." His hand found the small of her back. "Let's leave."

She nodded, deliberately avoiding Nathaniel's piercing stare.

Yet she could feel the weight of his gaze burning into her.

Daniel leveled Nathaniel with a cold look. "You're blocking the exit. Some people have better places to be."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched, his stance unmoving.

Evelyn tugged Daniel's sleeve. "There's another exit this way."

"Lead the way, darling." The warmth in Daniel's voice contrasted sharply with his earlier tone.

...

"Evelyn, we should get matching bracelets next! It'll complement the necklace perfectly."

"Or perhaps a whole new wardrobe to match? The boutique downstairs has stunning pieces."

...

Nathaniel watched their retreating figures, his brows drawn together.

With a frustrated tug, he loosened his tie further before turning to Robert. "Do women truly prefer men who spout meaningless flattery?"

Robert hesitated. "Generally speaking, women appreciate partners who understand romance. Thoughtful gestures go a long way."

Nathaniel scoffed. He stalked back toward the auction floor, his stormy expression clearing a path through the crowd.

Victoria materialized at his side. "Nathaniel, where have you been? Ms. Carter's companion purchased that emerald necklace."

His gaze followed where Daniel was fastening the jewel around Evelyn's neck.

Her radiant smile twisted something painful in Nathaniel's chest.

Victoria's lips curved knowingly. "Mr. Montgomery seems quite taken with Ms. Carter."

Penelope sniffed disdainfully. "As if someone like her could ever be a Montgomery! Victoria, will your cousins be attending your engagement? Does that mean Daniel will bring Evelyn?"

Victoria stiffened. "That's... undecided."

The truth was, she'd never secured invitations for the three Montgomery heirs.

In all these years, they'd never acknowledged her as part of their family.

That particular humiliation would die with her.

Penelope turned to Nathaniel. "The ceremony is this weekend. Perhaps we should limit guests? Evelyn might cause trouble."

Victoria exhaled quietly. Even Penelope's limited intellect proved occasionally useful.

Hope flickered in Victoria's eyes as she searched Nathaniel's face.

He met her with glacial detachment. "When will Julian be available?"

She blanched. "W-we're coordinating schedules. He's been terribly busy."

"I see." Nathaniel's voice turned to steel. "Then consider the engagement canceled."

###Chapter 143

Nathaniel dropped the bombshell and left without hesitation.

Victoria's perfect facade cracked instantly. She rushed after him, heels clicking frantically against the marble floor. "Nathaniel, wait! Julian promised to do the surgery! He's just swamped with his concert tour right now!"

She grabbed his arm desperately. "We've already set the engagement date. If you cancel now, he'll think-"

He turned with glacial indifference, his gaze freezing her words mid-sentence. "Victoria Sinclair, let's not pretend this engagement was ever real. It was always just a transaction. Remember your place."

"I know that," she whispered, nails digging into her palms.

"Good. Since Julian clearly has no intention of honoring our agreement, consider our deal terminated." He shook off her grip with effortless disdain.

Victoria stood frozen, crimson nails now drawing blood from her own flesh. All her carefully laid plans - ruined because of that nobody!

Penelope appeared at her side. "Don't distress yourself, Ms. Sinclair."

"That Carter girl," Victoria hissed through clenched teeth. "Nathaniel actually has feelings for her. He wants to call everything off!"

Penelope's eyes flashed dangerously. "A gold-digging nobody stealing your future husband? Unacceptable. Leave her to me - I'll ensure she disappears from Nathaniel's life permanently."

Victoria lowered her head, the picture of heartbreak. But beneath the curtain of her golden hair, something far darker than sorrow twisted her perfect features.

...

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat in Daniel's Lamborghini, turning the dazzling necklace over in her hands. "Daniel, this is too much. I can't possibly accept something this expensive."

The twelve-million-dollar diamond pendant glittered mockingly in the afternoon light.

Daniel didn't even glance up from the road. "Relax. That actor has more money than sense. If anyone asks, we'll say he donated it to charity."

"But what if he realizes you took it?"

"Julian won't care. We're practically brothers." His casual tone didn't match the tension in his grip on the steering wheel.

Evelyn frowned but couldn't pinpoint what felt off about the situation.

Back home, she paced nervously, trying to decide where to hide the extravagant jewelry. Every spot seemed too exposed for something so valuable.

Meanwhile, Daniel sprawled across the living room couch, typing rapidly in their family group chat: "Just dropped 12 mil on a diamond necklace for Evelyn."

Alexander responded first: "Since when do auction necklaces cost that much?"

Daniel recounted his bidding war with Nathaniel.

Julian chimed in: "Serves that divorced Whitmore right for eyeing our Evelyn! Should've bankrupted the bastard."

Alexander sent a thumbs-up emoji. "Agreed."

Olivia peered over Alexander's shoulder at his phone. "This 'divorced Whitmore'... why does that name sound familiar?"

Before Alexander could answer, his phone buzzed with an incoming call from Victoria.

Olivia's lips thinned. "Answer it. It's about Nathaniel, isn't it?"

Clearing his throat, Alexander accepted the call. "Victoria?"

"Alexander, have you and Olivia eaten yet?" Her voice was suspiciously sweet.

"We have. What do you need?"

A shaky breath came through the line. "Alexander... I need to ask you for a favor."

She continued in a carefully measured tone, "Didn't you promise to treat me like a sister after I took care of Eleanor? That you'd always support me after my marriage?"

The silence stretched uncomfortably before Alexander finally replied, "Yes."
###Chapter 144

"Alexander, I want to marry Nathaniel."

Alexander let out a weary sigh. "Does it have to be him?"

"Yes. He's the only one I want to spend my life with."

He considered it carefully. "Victoria, think this through. Are you absolutely certain you want to use your request on this?"

"I've never been more sure of anything."

Finally, he relented. "Fine."

Relief and joy surged through her, making her eyes sparkle. "Alexander, does this mean you approve of our marriage?"

"Yes. I gave you my word, and I'll see it through."

"Thank you, Alexander." An exhilarated Victoria ended the call.

As long as Alexander agreed, nothing could stand in her way.

Evelyn woke the next morning and immediately checked the entertainment news for updates on the famous actor.

Every time she spent time with Daniel, scandalous articles about him would flood the media.

But this time, there was nothing. Only headlines about his generous twelve-million-dollar donation at a charity auction.

She exhaled in relief.

Then her gaze caught another headline—"Ms. Sinclair Attends Charity Auction with Future Sister-in-Law."

The accompanying photo showed Victoria and Penelope stepping out of a luxury car.

Evelyn closed the tab without another glance.

She headed straight to the studio. Making money was her top priority now.

When she arrived, Jonathan was waiting outside her office. "Evelyn, you've been working nonstop lately."

"Can't afford to slow down when I need the money."

"If you're struggling with tuition, you can always talk to me."

She kept her tone even. "Thanks, Jonathan. But I've got it under control."

"Evelyn, you don’t have to push yourself so hard. I know your family situation isn’t ideal, but—"

Her eye twitched. She had rejected him subtly before, yet here he was, pressing the issue.

Her lips thinned. "Jonathan, a relationship isn’t something I’m considering right now. I’m sorry."

"I’ve had feelings for you for a long time, Evelyn. But you disappeared before I could confess."

"No one knew where you went. Now that you're back, I don’t want to miss my chance again. I’ve thought this through."

She took a deep breath. "I was married, Jonathan."

"Evelyn, you don’t have to lie to reject me."

"I’m serious." She wanted to explain further, but his disbelief was clear. So she let it go.

After work, Evelyn visited Eleanor at the hospital.

The surgery was scheduled for the weekend. Finally.

She carried a bouquet of daisies—Eleanor’s favorite—as she rode the elevator up.

When the doors opened, she saw Nathaniel in the hallway, phone pressed to his ear, expression dark. "I refuse to believe that doctor is the only one who can perform this surgery."

"What about the others? Are they incompetent?"

Robert stood beside him, tense. "Sir, we’re doing everything we can to find a suitable replacement. But it takes time."

Evelyn frowned. Wasn’t Victoria’s brother supposed to handle the surgery? What changed?

She approached quietly, flowers in hand. "Is there a problem with the arrangements?"

Robert immediately stepped aside when he noticed her. Nathaniel stiffened at the sound of her voice.
###Chapter 145

Evelyn Carter stood patiently until Nathaniel Whitmore finally turned to face her.

His crimson-rimmed eyes betrayed his sleepless night.

A wave of concern washed over her. "Is Mrs. Whitmore Senior alright?"

She started toward the hospital room, but his strong fingers closed around her wrist.

"She's perfectly stable." His voice carried an unfamiliar roughness.

"Then what's wrong?" Her confused gaze searched his inscrutable dark eyes for answers.

His jaw tightened. "There's been an incident with Victoria's brother. We need plan B."

"What kind of incident?"

Weren't they preparing for the engagement ceremony? Was Alexander Montgomery deliberately provoking the Whitmores right before becoming family?

Evelyn studied Nathaniel's expression, hoping to decipher some clue.

But he turned toward the window instead. "Nothing significant."

Her fingers tightened around the flower bouquet as unanswered questions swirled in her mind.

She knew with certainty he was keeping secrets from her.

Just then, Victoria Hawthorne emerged from the patient room. "Mrs. Whitmore! Your grandmother just woke up asking for you."

Evelyn composed herself with a deep breath before entering with a bright smile. "Grandmother Eleanor, I'm here."

"Evelyn, my dear. Come closer." The elderly woman's frail hand beckoned. "You've lost weight. Is the baby giving you trouble?"

"Not at all. This little one behaves perfectly." She gently cradled her stomach.

Truthfully, the pregnancy had been smooth - only occasional discomfort from overwork, with minimal symptoms.

Eleanor's eyes sparkled as she patted Evelyn's hand. "Now, I need you to sign this document for me."

Evelyn recognized the gift agreement immediately. "Grandmother, I can't possibly accept this."

"Nonsense. This is for my great-grandchild." Eleanor's voice grew firm. "If anything happens during surgery-"

"Don't say that!" Evelyn interrupted. "The procedure will go perfectly. Nathaniel found the best specialist."

"Then sign it to ease an old woman's mind." Eleanor pushed the papers forward. "It's not for you anyway."

Nathaniel entered abruptly. "Just accept it, Evelyn."

Their eyes locked briefly before she took the documents, planning to return them later.

She wanted nothing from the Whitmore fortune.

Eleanor finally smiled. "That's better. Nathaniel, you must take excellent care of them both."

"Grandmother, you know my work keeps me busy." His voice softened painfully. "We need you for that."

Even the powerful Whitmore family couldn't control life's fragility.

Evelyn stayed to cheer Eleanor with amusing stories until the elderly woman drifted back to sleep.

Outside the room, she immediately offered the documents back.

Nathaniel didn't even glance at them. "Grandmother's gift stays with you."

"This is for a baby that doesn't exist." Her hand rested protectively on her stomach. "We both know the truth."

When he refused to take them, she thrust the papers at Robert Chambers instead before walking away.

Not a single Whitmore penny would cross her palms - that was her unbreakable vow.
###Chapter 146

Nathaniel's gaze darkened as Evelyn walked away.



Robert cleared his throat nervously. "Mr. Whitmore, how should I handle this document?"

Nathaniel barely glanced at him. "It's yours to deal with. Figure it out yourself."

Robert swallowed hard. This was shaping up to be one of the most stressful days of his career.

When Evelyn arrived home, Nathaniel's mention of finding a new doctor resurfaced in her mind. She was deeply concerned about Eleanor's upcoming surgery.

But in the chaos of leaving the hospital, she had forgotten to ask him for details.

Then she remembered—Julian had connections in the medical field. Maybe he could help.

Eleanor's health was deteriorating. Time was running out.

Without hesitation, she dialed Julian's number.

"Julian, do you have a minute?"

"Of course. What's wrong?"

"Remember when I told you about my friend's grandmother needing surgery? You mentioned you knew someone who could help?"

"Yeah, but didn't you say your friend already found a surgeon?"

Evelyn hesitated.

"That was the plan, but things fell through. Now we're back to square one."

"Got it. No problem. Give me the details when I get home."

"Thank you."

Relief washed over her as she hung up. Maybe there was still hope.

She spent the rest of the evening waiting for Julian, even preparing his favorite pasta as a late-night snack.

The moment Julian walked in, the aroma of food greeted him. His face lit up instantly.

He snapped a quick photo of the meal, ready to brag in the family group chat—Evelyn had cooked for him.

After washing up, he took a seat.

"So, tell me about your friend's grandmother's condition."

He needed all the facts before committing to anything.



Evelyn explained Eleanor's condition in detail. Having been her caretaker, she knew every symptom, every complication.

Julian listened while eating, but his expression grew increasingly serious with each word.

"This isn't a routine procedure."

"Exactly. That's why finding the right surgeon has been impossible. And now, with time running out..."

He nodded slowly. "I can make this work."

"Really? You know someone qualified?"

Julian froze. He had almost slipped up.

Quickly, he recovered. "Yeah. A friend of mine specializes in this kind of surgery. Don’t worry—your friend’s grandmother will be in good hands."

"That’s a huge relief."

Evelyn trusted him completely.

But then she hesitated. "Julian… could I meet your friend? Or at least know who they are? The situation is urgent."

Julian’s fork stilled mid-air.

"He’s… extremely busy. Meeting won’t be possible. But if you give me the medical records, I’ll pass them along."

"We’ll schedule the surgery, and he’ll handle the rest."

This was the only way—helping without revealing himself.

Evelyn bit her lip. She already had Eleanor’s records from her time as a caretaker.

But those files bore Eleanor’s real name.

What if Julian found out?
###Chapter 147

Evelyn was still torn. After all, Nathaniel had nearly come to blows with Daniel back at the auction house.

When Nathaniel rushed her to the hospital after she fainted from illness, even Julian had suspected he was the father of her child.

Things would get complicated if Julian found out her friend’s grandmother was Eleanor.

She sighed. This was a mess.

"Evelyn, what’s wrong?" Julian set down his fork, noticing her troubled expression.

"Is there something you can’t tell me? Does your friend need financial help?"

"No, it’s not that."

Nathaniel certainly didn’t lack money.

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn asked, "Julian, will you help me no matter what?"

"Of course. You’re my sister."

He’d always stand by her. If it was something beyond his control, he’d move heaven and earth to find a solution.

Seeing the conflict in her eyes, he ruffled her hair gently.

"Relax. Just tell me which hospital your friend’s grandmother is at. I’ll go with you to check on her."

"Then… could you ask if the doctor can perform the surgery?"

"Sure. Get some rest now, Evelyn."

She stood and retreated to her room, her mind racing. Should she tell Julian the truth? Would Nathaniel even approve of her interference?

He might accuse her of meddling—or worse, assume she was just trying to win Eleanor’s favor.

Covering her face with her hands, she forced herself to stop overthinking. For now, she’d leave it be.

The next morning, Evelyn woke to a dull ache in her abdomen. She couldn’t pinpoint what was wrong, but the discomfort lingered.

Fearing for the baby, she immediately called Julian.

"Julian, my stomach hurts."

Alarm sharpened his voice. "Where are you? Do you need me to come get you?"

"I’m on my way to you. Maybe I’m just paranoid."

"Evelyn, if something feels off, you need to go to the hospital. You’re pregnant—you can’t take risks."

She agreed. Hailing a cab, she headed straight there.

Julian was already waiting at the entrance.

"The doctor’s ready. Let’s get an ultrasound to rule out any issues."

Her nerves tightened as she underwent the scan, but the results came back clear.

The obstetrician adjusted her glasses. "The baby’s growth might be putting pressure on your uterus, or stress could be a factor. You need to relax."

Evelyn had been agonizing over Eleanor’s surgery.

Exiting with the report, she realized Julian had vanished.

A text blinked on her phone:

Emergency patient. Wait for me when you’re done.

Tucking the report into her bag, she headed to the first-floor lounge. The elevator doors slid open—and there stood Victoria.

Instinctively, Evelyn clutched her bag tighter. The last thing she needed was Victoria snooping into her medical records.

"Evelyn? What are you doing here?" Victoria’s eyes narrowed in surprise.

Evelyn kept her tone flat. "Do I need permission to visit a hospital?"

She brushed past, but Victoria darted after her.

"Wait! You should know—my family approved my engagement to Nathaniel. There’s nothing standing in our way now. So give up. You’ve already lost."

Evelyn froze.

"If that’s true, why is Nathaniel still searching for a surgeon for Eleanor?"

She turned, meeting Victoria’s glare.

"Your brother’s a renowned doctor. If you’re really marrying Nathaniel, why won’t he perform the surgery?"
###Chapter 148



Evelyn's words struck Victoria like a bolt from the blue. Truth be told, she had come specifically to discuss this matter with Julian.

Yet pride prevented her from admitting it.

She lifted her chin defiantly. "Who says my brother won't operate on Grandma Eleanor? That was then, this is now. Julian will absolutely perform the surgery!"

Evelyn studied Victoria carefully. "You know how much Nathaniel cares for his grandmother. If he discovers you're using her condition to manipulate him, you'll regret it."

Victoria scoffed. "Mind your own business, Evelyn! Grandma Eleanor's surgery will happen soon enough, and by then I'll be engaged to Nathaniel."

As Victoria stepped into the elevator, Evelyn turned toward the hospital lounge, sinking into one of the plush chairs.

Her fingers brushed against the scan report in her bag, but she refused to let any dark thoughts surface.

She desperately wanted to believe Victoria's claims about the surgery proceeding smoothly.

But Victoria had always been full of empty boasts. If Julian had truly agreed to perform the operation, why hadn't he shown his face?

Moreover, Nathaniel was already consulting other specialists - clear evidence he doubted Victoria's story too.

Evelyn knew she needed to prepare contingencies. She had to convince Julian to find a competent surgeon.

Meanwhile, Victoria rode the elevator up to Julian's office, only to find it deserted.

Just then, Julian returned from his rounds. His expression darkened when he spotted Victoria waiting outside his door.

"What are you doing here?"

"Julian, wonderful news! Alexander has approved my marriage to Nathaniel!"

Julian froze mid-step, his brow furrowing.

"Victoria, though you're not a Montgomery by blood, we've raised you as family since childhood."

"We've always treated you well, hoping you'd marry someone worthy. What's so special about Nathaniel? Why this obsession?"

"Julian, his first marriage was arranged by Grandma Eleanor - there was never any love there. Besides, he's already ended things with that woman!"

"That woman married him when he was practically comatose, just to improve his fortunes. The moment he regained consciousness, he cast her aside. How is that acceptable behavior?"



"There's something fundamentally wrong with him!"

Victoria rushed to explain. "Julian, those weren't his true feelings! I still love him despite everything!"

"If you loved him so much, why didn't you go to him after his accident when he was nearly vegetative?"

"You listened to us and stayed away from Nord City. Now suddenly you're determined to marry him?"

Victoria's face flushed with discomfort.

"I won't waste my second chance like I did the first."

Back then, Nathaniel had been at death's door after the accident. She'd never have married a dying man.

Who could have predicted his miraculous recovery?

The thought filled her with bitter regret.

Had she taken the risk then, she might already be his wife, spared all this current trouble.

She lifted her chin defiantly. "Since Alexander has approved the marriage, we'll soon be family. You must help with Grandma Eleanor's surgery!"

###Chapter 149

Victoria Sinclair gazed at Julian Montgomery with pleading eyes. Though she knew she was merely a stand-in for the Montgomery family's lost daughter, she had lived comfortably all these years.

With Alexander Montgomery's approval of her marriage, surely Julian would agree to perform the surgery.

Yet, in the next breath, his voice turned to ice. "No."

Memories of Evelyn Carter working as a caregiver at the Whitmore estate flashed through his mind—how Nathaniel Whitmore had treated her. There was no chance he would associate himself with that family.

Victoria's face paled.

"Why not? Even Alexander agreed!"

"That changes nothing. If you're so desperate to marry Nathaniel, go ahead. I never promised to operate on a Whitmore."

"Julian, are you defying Alexander?"

She hadn't anticipated him refusing.

His expression remained unmoved. "I've made my stance clear. Marry whomever you want, but I won't perform the surgery."

"Julian, if you don't do it, how can I marry Nathaniel?"

"Didn't you claim you two were close? Will he reject you just because I refuse?"

Panic flickered in her eyes as she grabbed his sleeve.

"It's not like that! Why won't you just help Grandma Eleanor? We're family!"

"You brought me home and promised to treat me like your real sister. All these years, I've never asked for anything!"

"It's just one surgery—why are you being so difficult?"

Julian pulled his arm free, disappointment darkening his gaze.

"My decision is final."

He would never operate on a Whitmore. Without another word, he strode out of the consultation room, leaving Victoria behind.

He headed for the emergency exit to make a call.

"Alexander, did you really approve Victoria's marriage to Nathaniel?"

Alexander, in the middle of a meeting, paused. "Yes. I told her as long as she keeps Grandma Eleanor stable, she can marry him."

"She insisted on it yesterday. If that's what she wants, I won't stop her."

"Nathaniel is a snake. He's only marrying her to force me into operating on his grandmother. And Victoria—she may not be our blood, but are we really letting her walk into this?"

"Julian, it's her choice."

A tense silence followed.

"Alexander, you know Evelyn was once a caregiver at the Whitmore estate. And I’m certain Nathaniel still has feelings for her."

"If Victoria marries him, we’ll be forced to interact with them. I won’t risk the Whitmores exposing Evelyn’s past."

Alexander’s brow furrowed. "You're right. If she insists, we’ll sever ties with her legally."

"Good."

Julian ended the call. Victoria had lived in luxury with the Montgomerys long enough.

But Evelyn had suffered for years. She came first now.

He dialed Evelyn immediately.

"Evelyn, I just finished my shift. Where are you?"

"First-floor lounge."

"Wait there. I’ll be right down."

As Evelyn hung up, she glanced up—just in time to see Victoria stepping out of the elevator, her face ashen.

What had shattered her usual arrogance?

Evelyn couldn’t help but wonder—what had Victoria been doing at the hospital?
###Chapter 150

Evelyn's gaze lingered on the doorway where Victoria had disappeared. The unanswered question still weighed heavily on her mind.

The elevator dinged, drawing her attention. Julian stepped out, his long strides carrying him swiftly toward her.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice laced with concern. "I just spoke with your doctor. They believe stress might be causing your symptoms."

She gave a small nod. "Yes, he mentioned that to me too."

Julian settled onto the bench beside her, his piercing blue eyes searching hers. "Evelyn, is there something you're not telling us?"

Despite their reunion, an invisible barrier still existed between them.

At the thought of Eleanor, Evelyn's lashes fluttered downward. Then, steeling herself, she met his gaze directly.

"It's nothing major really. Just... I've been worried about my friend's grandmother needing surgery."

Julian's expression softened. "You should have told me sooner. I actually..."

He paused, then continued, "I reached out to a colleague earlier. He's agreed to perform the surgery."

"Really?" Evelyn's entire face brightened. If Julian vouched for this doctor, she could trust the arrangement.

This was the best news she'd heard in weeks!

"However," Julian added carefully, "my colleague has a packed schedule. I thought we could visit your friend's grandmother together first - review her medical records to assess her condition properly."

"That way, we can schedule the surgery immediately afterward."

Evelyn froze. Julian coming with her meant her secret would be exposed. She bit her lip, searching for an alternative.

"Julian, wouldn't it be better if your colleague came instead? Since he's the surgeon, shouldn't he examine her personally?"

An uncomfortable tension settled between them. If Julian went, his true identity risked exposure - especially after his near slip at the hospital.

Thankfully, Evelyn's trusting nature had accepted his quick cover story about switching from veterinary medicine. But she wasn't naive.

This situation was becoming increasingly complicated.

Silence stretched between them.

Julian racked his brain for solutions. How could he arrange Eleanor's surgery without revealing his true profession?

The dilemma seemed impossible to resolve.

Finally, Evelyn couldn't bear the secrecy any longer.

"Julian," she confessed in a rush, "the truth is... my friend's grandmother is Eleanor Whitmore."

Julian's breath caught.

His brows knitted together. "Nathaniel's grandmother?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yes, it's her."

Julian exhaled sharply. Her casual reference to Eleanor suggested a closeness that surprised him. But of all people, why did it have to be Nathaniel's grandmother needing surgery?

Noticing his reaction, Evelyn studied him closely. "Julian? Is something wrong?"

Clearing his throat, Julian recovered quickly. "No, it's just... unexpected. The Whitmores are quite wealthy. Why would they need your help finding a surgeon?"

His eyes narrowed slightly. Was Nathaniel manipulating Evelyn's kindness? He wouldn't stand for that.

Evelyn looked down at her hands. "Originally, they didn't. They'd secured a top surgeon from Nord City."

"He'd agreed to do the procedure, but... something happened. He backed out at the last minute."

Julian shifted uncomfortably. Was she talking about him?
###Chapter 151

Julian Montgomery distinctly recalled never consenting to operate on Eleanor Whitmore. The thought had never crossed his mind.

His steel-gray eyes hardened as he absently traced his jawline. That left only one plausible explanation - Victoria Sinclair's deception.

No wonder she'd been hovering around him so persistently these days.

In that moment, his opinion of her plummeted further. How dare she manipulate him like this?

Tapping an impatient rhythm on his mahogany desk, he remarked, "Evelyn, despite your time as a caregiver at the Whitmore estate, they hardly treated you with kindness."

"Daniel mentioned Penelope's been harassing you relentlessly. So tell me, why are you still determined to help them?"

The Montgomery brothers already harbored deep resentment toward the Whitmores for their mistreatment of Evelyn.

Evelyn averted her gaze, fingers twisting in her lap. "I told you before, didn't I? Grandma Eleanor always showed me kindness."

"After Uncle Benjamin's accident, she was the only one who stood by me. I can't forget that, so I have to repay her."

"I see." Julian processed this revelation, realizing not every Whitmore deserved his contempt.

Finally nodding, he conceded, "Very well. I'll do this for you."

Though he despised Nathaniel and his entire family, Julian had always maintained one unbreakable rule - no Whitmore would ever receive his surgical expertise.

Yet Evelyn's pleading eyes shattered his resolve. She mattered more than any principle.

"Thank you, Julian." The tension drained from Evelyn's shoulders as relief flooded through her. She desperately wanted Eleanor to have more years ahead.

Julian offered a rare smile. "Don't mention it. It's the least I can do."

After all, Eleanor had protected Evelyn during her most vulnerable moments, before the Montgomerys found her. This debt demanded repayment.

"Let's visit Eleanor's hospital tomorrow," Julian suggested. "I'll need to review her medical records thoroughly."

Evelyn nodded. "Of course."

As she turned to leave, her fingers hovered over her phone. She considered texting Nathaniel but ultimately pocketed the device. Tomorrow's hospital visit would determine everything.

Once alone, Julian updated their family group chat: "I've agreed to operate on Eleanor Whitmore."

The response was instantaneous.

Alexander: "You swore you'd never treat a Whitmore!"

Daniel: "Absolutely not! That bastard Nathaniel still eyes Evelyn. We shouldn't lift a finger for them."

After Julian explained Evelyn's request, silence fell over the chat.

Finally Olivia weighed in: "If it's Evelyn's wish, we support it. This settles any debt to the Whitmores."

Julian had reached the same conclusion.

The following morning found Julian and Evelyn at the private hospital's gleaming entrance.

While Evelyn headed upstairs to visit Eleanor, Julian met with her medical team. Neither anticipated Nathaniel's presence in the private suite.

Evelyn froze momentarily upon seeing him, but quickly composed herself, offering Eleanor a warm smile.

"Evelyn, darling! Come sit with me." Eleanor patted the plush chair beside her bed.

Throughout their conversation, Evelyn felt Nathaniel's intense gaze burning into her. The weight became unbearable.

Excusing herself, she retreated to the adjoining kitchenette under the pretense of preparing fruit, needing space to breathe.
###Chapter 152

"Nathaniel, what are you standing there for? Go help her."

Eleanor shooed him out of her hospital room, making Evelyn sigh. Truthfully, she had been trying to avoid him.

Yet, her steps slowed. She wanted to tell him she was also searching for a doctor for Eleanor.

When she turned to face him, his gaze burned into her.

Meeting his eyes, she asked, "Have you found a specialist yet?"

"No." His reply was slow, deliberate.

Still no luck?

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to speak, she spotted Victoria stepping out of the elevator.

The air instantly thickened.

Victoria's expression darkened the moment she saw Evelyn. Clearly, she hadn’t expected her to be here.

Taking a sharp breath, Victoria turned to Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, we need to talk."

His brows knitted together in silence.

Evelyn dropped her gaze. "I should go."

She hurried down the hallway, clutching the bag of fruit. She wasn’t even sure why she went that way—there was no place to cut the fruit there.

Seeing Victoria approach had left her tongue-tied.

If Victoria could secure a doctor, Evelyn wouldn’t mention her own efforts. Otherwise, they might mock her for finding someone inferior to Julian.

Victoria glared at Nathaniel. "Why is Evelyn here?"

"Why are you here?" he shot back, his lips pressed into a thin line.

Her eyes reddened at his sharp tone. "Nathaniel, I came to tell you something important."

Though Julian hadn’t agreed to the surgery yet, Alexander had already given his blessing for their marriage.

All Victoria needed now was to convince Margaret. Despite her grandmother’s fragile state, she had always doted on her.

If she could persuade Margaret to pressure Julian, he would have no choice but to comply.

But Nathaniel’s doubt in her was growing.

So she had come to reassure him—to ask for his patience.



Nathaniel’s frown deepened as he turned toward the stairwell.

"I don’t want to hear it."

"Nathaniel, I know you’re upset, but I’m doing this for you!"

"Lying is for my sake too?"

A flicker of guilt crossed Victoria’s face. "I admit I was wrong, but Alexander approved our engagement. It won’t take long for Julian to agree."

"Sure, he’s eccentric, but his skills are world-renowned. I’ve been working nonstop to get him to operate on Eleanor."

Nathaniel didn’t slow his descent. He had no interest in her excuses.

Victoria stubbornly followed. When she realized he was heading to Eleanor’s doctor’s office, panic surged through her.

Had he found another surgeon? Impossible!

She had to know the truth. No one but Julian would operate on Eleanor—she wouldn’t allow it.

Ignoring her, Nathaniel pushed open the doctor’s door.

Inside, Julian had just finished reviewing the medical records and was about to leave.

Hearing the door open, he assumed it was Evelyn. But when he turned, Nathaniel stood there instead.
###Chapter 153

The moment their gazes locked, the atmosphere crackled with tension. Nathaniel froze, his body going rigid as he took in Julian's unexpected presence.

What in the world was he doing here?

Before he could process it further, Victoria rushed into the office behind him. Her breath hitched when she spotted Julian standing there.

"Julian?" Her voice trembled with disbelief. "Why are you here?"

She practically flew into the room, her pulse racing with sudden exhilaration.

Of all people, she never imagined she'd run into him here.

Her hands clenched at her sides as hope surged through her. "Julian, does this mean you've agreed to perform the surgery?"

If not, why else would he be standing in Eleanor's hospital room?

Julian's expression darkened the second he saw Victoria. His jaw tightened—this was exactly what he'd wanted to avoid.

Evelyn was in this very hospital. If she found out—

No. His identity couldn't be exposed. Not yet.

With deliberate calm, he replied, "I'm here to assess the patient's condition."

"Julian!" Victoria beamed, too elated to care about his indifferent tone. She threw her arms around his neck in a quick, impulsive hug.

It felt like fate was finally smiling down on her.

She had been moments away from revealing everything to Nathaniel, desperate to regain his trust. But now, here was Julian, secretly checking on Eleanor's condition.

His earlier refusal had clearly just been an act. He was going to help her after all.

Tears shimmered in her eyes as she pulled back. She turned to Nathaniel, her voice triumphant. "Nate, I told you. Julian has always been on my side. He will perform the surgery on Grandma Eleanor."

Nathaniel didn't react. Instead, his eyes narrowed in realization. "He's your brother?"

The last time Evelyn had fainted, he'd taken her to a public hospital. Julian had been the doctor who treated her.

And from what he'd observed, Evelyn knew him—intimately.

The dismissed caregiver had even whispered to him about Julian constantly hovering around Evelyn, doting on her.

The thought left a bitter taste in his mouth. Now, to discover this man was Victoria's brother?

Julian smirked, unimpressed. "Got a problem with that?"

Not just Victoria's brother—but Evelyn's as well.

Nathaniel's expression soured, his gaze turning icy.

Victoria quickly interjected, "Nate, don't mind him. Julian's always been blunt."

Julian ignored Nathaniel entirely.

His focus remained on Victoria as he said pointedly, "Tell your fiancé to stop playing with other women once he's married to you."

The warning was clear—Nathaniel needed to stay away from Evelyn. If Julian found out he was messing with her, he wouldn't hesitate to break more than just his legs.

Victoria's lips curved into a radiant smile. This was even better than she'd hoped—her family was no longer opposing the marriage.

Perfect.

She hadn't slept a wink last night, tormented by Nathaniel's growing suspicions. When she'd heard he was visiting Eleanor, she'd raced here, prepared to come clean.

But Julian's unexpected appearance had changed everything.

Without missing a beat, she gushed, "Julian, don't worry. Nate isn't like that! Since you're here, does that mean you've reviewed her case? When can we schedule the surgery?"

"Stick to the original plan," Julian replied coolly. "We wait until the patient stabilizes further. Only then can we proceed."

His tone left no room for argument. "And make sure no one interferes with her treatment. The patient must be informed of any adjustments I make."
###Chapter 154

Though Julian Montgomery despised Nathaniel Whitmore, he maintained his professionalism. He was here for Evelyn Carter's sake, and he wouldn't disappoint her.

Nathaniel finally broke the silence. "When will you finalize the surgical plan?"

The plan was critical. Cardiac surgeries were notoriously complex, with unpredictable complications. A meticulous strategy was non-negotiable.

Julian checked his watch. "I'll return in two days with a detailed proposal. Rushing this would be reckless."

Victoria Sinclair nodded in agreement. "He's right. The surgery shouldn't happen until the end of the month. We have time."

Julian glanced at the door. "I should go."

He needed to leave before Evelyn arrived. Running into her now would complicate everything. How would he explain his presence?

"Julian," Victoria called, stepping forward. "Since you're here, why not join us for lunch? Despite our past... misunderstandings, we're about to be family. We should clear the air."

His expression remained cold. "No need. I'm busy."

Without another word, he strode out.

Victoria followed briefly but stopped, watching him disappear down the hallway. She turned back to Nathaniel, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes.

"You see, Nate? I told you. He may act indifferent, but he cares. He refused openly, yet he still came to review Eleanor's condition."

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on Julian's notes left on the desk, conflicted.

Eleanor's attending physician, still awed, interjected, "Mr. Whitmore, he truly is the best cardiac surgeon in Nord City. His observations pinpointed details we missed."

"But only he can execute the procedure," the doctor admitted.

"Obviously," Victoria said, beaming. "Julian is exceptional. If he operates, Eleanor will recover swiftly."

Nathaniel exhaled. "Then proceed as he advises."

It was their best option.

As they left the office, Victoria stole a glance at Nathaniel. His lack of objection to Julian handling the surgery—did that mean acceptance?

Her heart fluttered as they waited for the elevator.

The doors slid open—and there stood Evelyn, frozen mid-step.

She had taken her time preparing fruit for Eleanor, assuming they'd still be in the ward. Instead, she found them here.

Evelyn recovered quickly. She had planned to find Julian afterward to discuss Eleanor's condition.

But fate had other plans.

The air thickened with tension as their eyes met.

Victoria's lips curled. "Ms. Carter," she purred, "what a surprise. What brings you here?"
###Chapter 155

Evelyn maintained her composure despite Victoria’s biting remarks.

“Can’t I be here to check on Grandma Eleanor? Her surgery hasn’t been finalized yet.”

She didn’t mention that Julian was already searching for a specialist.

Still, she wanted to know if Nathaniel was aware of why Victoria’s brother couldn’t perform the operation.

Victoria’s smirk deepened. “Is that so? Well, you don’t need to worry anymore. My brother has agreed to operate on Grandma Eleanor.”

“The surgery will happen by the end of this month, and she’ll recover in no time.”

Evelyn froze for a second, then instinctively turned to Nathaniel. “Is that true?”

There wouldn’t be any last-minute complications, would there?

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. “She’s right. The surgery is scheduled for the end of the month.”

Evelyn lowered her gaze, murmuring, “That’s good. I hope everything goes smoothly for Grandma Eleanor.”

In a way, this was for the best.

Meanwhile, Victoria was practically glowing. She had thought she’d lost her chance entirely, but fate had handed her an opportunity instead.

This was perfect. With this, Evelyn would no longer be a threat to her.

She smirked, tilting her head at Nathaniel. “Come on, Nate. We should go tell Grandma Eleanor the good news.”

Evelyn couldn’t stay a second longer. She turned on her heel and strode toward the stairs.

Victoria watched her leave with a triumphant smile.

“Nate, let’s go.”

Nathaniel’s expression remained impassive as he said coolly, “Don’t tell Grandma yet. If she finds out, she might refuse the surgery.”

Victoria’s face darkened. “It can’t be that bad, can it? My brother is one of the best surgeons in the country.”

She had been terrified when Nathaniel was involved in that car accident.

But now, she was the one saving Eleanor’s life—begging Alexander and Sebastian to convince her brother to operate.

So why wasn’t Eleanor grateful?

Eleanor doted on Evelyn because she had saved Nathaniel’s life. Shouldn’t she treat Victoria better now that Victoria was saving hers?

A warning glint flashed in Nathaniel’s eyes. “Victoria, don’t push your luck.”

Instantly, Victoria shrank back, guilt flickering across her face. “Nate, relax. I won’t do anything reckless.”

“But I only managed to get Alexander and Sebastian to agree because I told them you were going to marry me. You heard what Sebastian said earlier.”

“I agreed to a fake engagement. That’s all this is—a transaction.”

“I know.” Victoria lowered her voice. “But even if it’s fake, we still need a ceremony to convince my brothers. Otherwise, they’ll start asking questions.”

“We have until the end of the month. If anything happens to Grandma Eleanor before then, we can’t afford to wait.”

As she gazed at Nathaniel, excitement thrummed through her. Once the engagement was official, it would be real. She wouldn’t let it stay fake.

By then, her brothers would stand by her, and Nathaniel would have no choice but to marry her.

But for now, she had to stay calm. She needed to make sure the engagement ceremony went off without a hitch.

“Of course, the engagement will proceed as planned,” Beatrice interjected, beaming as she linked arms with Victoria. “Eleanor’s doctor called earlier and mentioned your brother visited. This is wonderful news!”

“As for your engagement, don’t worry. Nothing will go wrong. You can even invite your brothers to witness it.”

Victoria smiled sweetly, but her eyes held something far more complicated.

Evelyn stormed out of the hospital, her strides long and hurried.

“Evelyn!”

Julian was waiting for her at the entrance. He took one look at her expression and knew something was wrong.
###Chapter 156



Evelyn froze at the sound of Julian’s voice, suddenly remembering he had been waiting for her.

She quickly composed herself, turning to face him as he approached.

"Julian," she greeted softly.

"Evelyn, what's wrong?" His brow furrowed as he studied her face. "Are those tears? Did someone upset you?"

She wiped her cheeks with a quick motion. "It's nothing. I just visited Eleanor earlier. Seeing her like that... it got to me."

Evelyn swiftly changed the subject. "Actually, I was looking for you earlier. You weren’t downstairs."

"Ah, about that." Julian rubbed the back of his neck. "I got caught up in a call with a friend. Lost track of time."

A flicker of guilt passed through his eyes.

Unbeknownst to Evelyn, Julian had just run into Victoria downstairs.

If Evelyn had come down a minute earlier, she would have seen them together.

And that would have been disastrous.

The six brothers had a pact: whoever revealed their true identities to Evelyn first would have to perform a humiliating naked dance.

Julian might lack integrity, but he wasn’t about to suffer that fate.

Evelyn nodded, her lips curving into a self-deprecating smile.

"Julian, I really appreciate your help, but... I think your friend won’t need to step in after all. I’m sorry for the trouble."

Julian’s mind raced. Had Victoria said something? The timing was suspicious—Evelyn running into both Victoria and Nathaniel downstairs.

He sighed. "It’s fine. As long as Eleanor’s surgery goes well, that’s all that matters."

"That’s all I care about too. The rest... doesn’t matter."

She hesitated. "I just feel bad for dragging your friend into this. Now that he won’t be doing the surgery, he might be upset."

"Don’t worry. He won’t mind."

Julian gave her a reassuring smile. "Come on, let’s head back."

He wanted to ease her worries. If Evelyn’s only concern was Eleanor’s surgery, he’d make sure she had nothing to fear.

Once home, Evelyn pushed her anxieties aside.

With Victoria’s brother handling the surgery, there was no reason to fret.



—

Days later, Evelyn came across a gossip headline: "Socialite Victoria Sinclair Dines with Future Mother-in-Law, Beatrice Harrington—Bond Blossoms Between Soon-to-Be Family!"

The accompanying photo showed Victoria and Beatrice, hands clasped, beaming at the camera.

It seemed Beatrice had finally found the perfect heiress for her son.

Evelyn’s fingers brushed her stomach absently.

Soon, once the waiting period ended, she could file for divorce from Nathaniel.

"Evelyn, you keep touching your stomach. Why?"

Cassandra leaned in suddenly, eyes sharp. "You’re not pregnant, are you?"

Evelyn’s hand stilled. "Why do you care?"

"Stop playing dumb. You’ve gained weight—enough to look pregnant. So, whose baby is it?"

"Cassandra, instead of gossiping, maybe focus on fixing the mess in your designs. If you don’t, the whole studio will suffer."

Cassandra’s face darkened. She stormed off in her heels and immediately dialed Penelope.

"Ms. Whitmore, I think Evelyn might be pregnant."

Penelope laughed. "Evelyn might wish she was pregnant, but the odds of that are slim, aren’t they?"

"By the way, I have a task for you. Get Evelyn into trouble—something tied to your designs. Do it well, and I’ll buy you that designer bag you wanted last time."

Cassandra brightened instantly. "You can count on me, Ms. Whitmore!"

After hanging up, doubt niggled at her.

Still, Evelyn’s possible pregnancy was hard to ignore.

With so few women in the office, it was obvious Evelyn hadn’t had her period in weeks.
###Chapter 157

The call ended abruptly. Cassandra Blake shot Evelyn Carter a calculating glance. She was determined to prove to Penelope Whitmore that Evelyn was indeed expecting.

But there was no need to rush.

After a brief pause, Cassandra opened WhatsApp and typed with a smirk, "Reginald, didn’t you mention wanting to meet a talented designer?"

"Funny enough, there’s a colleague in my studio who recently outshined me and won first place in the Fleur International Design Competition."

With her plan set, Cassandra sauntered over to Jonathan Reeves.

"Jonathan," she said sweetly, "we just received a high-profile villa design order. The client specifically requested Evelyn to handle it."

Jonathan nodded. "I’ll deliver the project details to her later."

Cassandra left the office, lips curved in satisfaction.

Now that she had ties to the Whitmore family, it was best to distance herself from Reginald.

Letting Evelyn take her place would simplify things—shielding Cassandra from any potential fallout.

With Penelope involved, Reginald wouldn’t dare touch her.

Soon after, Evelyn secured the luxury villa design contract.

When she called the client, a middle-aged man answered. After introductions, Evelyn asked, "Could you share your design preferences?"

"Mr. Stewart is occupied. If you want details, you’ll need to meet him in person," came the curt reply.

"When would be convenient?"

"Tomorrow afternoon. Come directly to the villa." The line went dead.

Evelyn stared at her phone, musing how the wealthy all seemed to share the same impatience.

Building a fortune in this era clearly didn’t come with manners.

The next afternoon, Evelyn arrived at the villa.

But the moment she stepped inside, unease prickled her skin.

It wasn’t the lavish decor—something just felt off.

She settled on the sofa, waiting.

A maid approached with a tray of juice.

"May I—" Evelyn began, but the maid walked away without a word.

Evelyn hesitated, eyeing the drink. Pregnant, she couldn’t risk consuming anything questionable.

Time crawled. The sun dipped low, casting long shadows.

The room grew colder.

Evelyn dialed the client again. No answer.

As she stood to leave, a commanding voice stopped her.

"Ms. Carter. Wait."

Turning, she saw an elderly man in a wheelchair emerging from the elevator, flanked by a burly middle-aged man—the one from the phone.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Hello, Mr. Stewart."

"I heard you won the Fleur Competition. Talent and beauty often go hand in hand," Reginald remarked, his gaze unsettling.

Evelyn’s smile tightened. "Here are some design sketches. Let me know if anything appeals to you."

Reginald gestured sharply. Anthony Russo snatched the sketches as Reginald handed Evelyn a business card.

"You may not know me, Ms. Carter. Allow me to introduce myself."
###Chapter 158

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she read the embossed lettering on the card: "CEO of Keystone Construction."

The name triggered a memory. She'd accompanied Nathaniel to deliver contracts to this very company months ago.

She distinctly recalled the younger Stewart pitching an ambitious golf resort project to Nathaniel.

Nathaniel had rejected the proposal outright.

Yet somehow, the development had proceeded regardless.

Evelyn remembered Nathaniel mentioning environmental concerns about that particular parcel of land.

"Ms. Carter, these blueprints are quite impressive," Reginald commented, leaning back in his leather chair.

"Tell me," he continued, his gaze lingering too long, "what does a beautiful woman like you do for fun?"

Evelyn's instincts screamed danger.

She rose abruptly. "Mr. Stewart, we can revisit the designs once you've made your selection."

The door clicked shut before she reached it. Her breath hitched as she whirled to face him. "What's the meaning of this?"

Reginald smirked. "Women of your caliber always have a price. With your skills, I'm prepared to be... generous."

"All I require is satisfactory performance. Time is money, after all."

Evelyn's face turned to stone. "Not interested."

"Don't play coy," Reginald warned as Anthony advanced toward her.

She fumbled for her phone. "One more step and I'm calling the police."

Anthony snatched the device from her grasp.

"Take her upstairs," Reginald ordered coldly. "Restrain her."

Evelyn drew a steadying breath. "You know Nathaniel Whitmore, don't you?"

Reginald's eyes narrowed. "What of it?"

"About a year ago," Evelyn continued, "your son approached him about investing in that golf course."

"The project was rejected due to soil contamination concerns. Industrial waste makes terrible resort foundations."

Reginald exchanged a glance with Anthony. "You're remarkably well-informed, Ms. Carter."

"What's your relationship with Whitmore?" he demanded.

"That's irrelevant," Evelyn countered. "What matters is that contaminated land is now a functioning resort."

"Should environmental violations surface, Keystone would face devastating lawsuits. Given your company's recent financial struggles..."

She let the implication hang, channeling Nathaniel's negotiating tactics despite her pounding heart.

Her knowledge of Keystone's troubles came secondhand from Nathaniel's remarks.

Sometimes strategic omissions proved most effective.

The office air grew thick with tension.

Evelyn squared her shoulders, meeting Reginald's gaze unflinchingly.

Finally, he broke the silence. "Explain your connection to Whitmore."

A knowing smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Nathaniel insisted our relationship remain confidential."

"But feel free to call him yourself. His number's in my contacts."
###Chapter 159

Evelyn's composed demeanor stirred something in Reginald.

Without hesitation, Anthony snatched Evelyn's phone and demanded, "Unlock it."

Evelyn complied instantly, swiping her screen open.

Reginald then provided Nathaniel's number, which Anthony dialed directly from Evelyn's phone. Moments later, the screen lit up with a contact name: "Worthless Jerk."

Noticing the label, Evelyn cleared her throat softly. "It's just an inside joke between us," she explained.

Anthony immediately ended the call, and Reginald's expression darkened. "Give her the phone back," he ordered.

Once her phone was returned, Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief. Had she actually passed the test?

The entire ordeal had shaken her more than she cared to admit.

But could she really consider herself safe now?

In that desperate moment, she had no choice but to bluff her way through.

Then, her phone buzzed again—Nathaniel's name flashing on the screen.

Evelyn's eye twitched in irritation. Why was he calling back? Didn’t he have a company to run?

Reginald glanced over, his tone deceptively calm. "Aren’t you going to answer?"

Reluctantly, she picked up, clearing her throat before speaking. "Hello, darling. Sorry about earlier. I must’ve dialed the wrong number by mistake."

Nathaniel’s frown deepened on the other end. "Evelyn, can’t you just talk like a normal person?"

"What’s that? You’re asking where I am? I’m at work. A client needed me to present some design drafts. I’m at Oakwood Villa. I’ll head over once I’m done," she rushed out.

Nathaniel’s instincts flared. "Evelyn, what’s really going on?"

"Sweetheart, I have to go now. Sending you kisses."

Without waiting for a response, she hung up and turned back to Reginald with forced calm. "I should probably leave now."

"Wait," Reginald interjected.

Evelyn tensed but kept her expression neutral. "Is there something else?"

Reginald picked up the design drafts she had prepared, his tone shifting to something almost pleasant. "Ms. Carter, your work is exceptional. Let’s proceed with this draft."

He continued smoothly, "What happened earlier was just a misunderstanding. Given Mr. Whitmore’s busy schedule, further complications wouldn’t benefit you."

"Let’s just pretend this never happened."

"Fine. The fewer complications, the better," Evelyn agreed easily.

Clutching her designs, she hurried out of the villa.

The moment she stepped outside, the sunlight enveloped her, its warmth soothing her frayed nerves.

Wiping the sweat from her brow, she couldn’t help but marvel at how close she had come to disaster.

Reginald had caught her completely off guard.

Still unsettled, she found a bench nearby and sat down, needing a moment to collect herself.

Her hand drifted to her stomach. Had the baby sensed her fear?

"Well, at least your useless father still came in handy," she muttered dryly.

Just as she was regaining her composure, a sleek black luxury car pulled up in front of her. The license plate looked familiar.

The door opened, and Nathaniel stepped out, his voice laced with disbelief. "Evelyn!"

Startled, she looked up. "What are you doing here?"

He strode toward her, giving her a once-over. "Weren’t you the one who called for help, claiming to be at Oakwood Villa?"

For a moment, Evelyn was stunned. She hadn’t expected him to pick up on her coded message.

Even more surprising—he had actually come looking for her.

In truth, she had only made that call as a precaution.

Yet, Reginald had hesitated because of Nathaniel, ultimately letting her go.

Now that the danger had passed, she shrugged. "Honestly, I didn’t need your help. I lost a bet with a friend and had to make a random call."
###Chapter 160

"A dare to make a random call?" Nathaniel growled, loosening his tie with an irritated jerk.

He'd canceled multimillion-dollar meetings to rush here, genuinely concerned about Evelyn, only to discover...

It was just some childish truth or dare game.

Nathaniel's jaw clenched in fury.

"Evelyn Carter, you've truly surpassed yourself this time. Next time you're dying, do me a favor - don't call!" He spun on his heel, storming back toward his Bentley.

Evelyn bit her lip, hesitating to mention her unsettling encounter with Reginald at the villa. She could already picture Nathaniel's mocking smirk if she tried explaining.

Just then, a sleek black Mercedes pulled out of the gated community.

The tinted window rolled down, revealing Reginald's cold stare locking onto hers.

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins.

She sprinted to Nathaniel just as he reached for the car door, throwing her arms around his waist in a dramatic embrace. "Sweetheart, don't be angry," she cooed.

Nathaniel froze, glancing down at her with narrowed eyes. "What game are you playing now?"

Evelyn forced a giggle. "Just teasing you earlier. Let's talk in the car, hm?"

Leaning against the door, Nathaniel tilted her chin up. "Explain. Now."

Her eyes darted to Reginald's idling car. Desperate, she gave Nathaniel's backside a playful smack. "Not here. The car."

Nathaniel's entire body stiffened, shock flashing across his aristocratic features. Before he could react, Evelyn shoved him inside, his forehead thumping against the window.

"Evelyn!" he snarled through gritted teeth. "Have you lost your damn mind?"

Ignoring him, she dove into the car, slamming the door. Pressing against the window, she watched Reginald's car finally drive away.

Only then did she exhale in relief. Had the act worked?

Turning, she met Nathaniel's stormy gaze - equal parts fury and disbelief.

Clearing her throat, she smoothed her dress. "Could you drop me off on your way back to the office?"

With a violent tug, Nathaniel ripped off his tie. "A ride? Why don't you grow wings and fly? Evelyn, you're the most shameless woman I've ever met!"

"Well, now you have," she shot back.

Nathaniel kicked the front seat. "Out! Both of you!"

Robert and Frederick immediately exited.

Evelyn scrambled for the door, but Nathaniel yanked her back by the collar, slamming her against the leather seats.

Blinking innocently, she whispered, "You're busy. I'll just take a cab-"

"You think you can play me and walk away? Where do you get that arrogance?"

"It's called confidence. Believe it or not."

Nathaniel gripped her chin. "Enough games, Evelyn. Just because Grandmother favors you doesn't mean I won't put you in your place."

A cold sweat broke down Evelyn's spine. "I'm sorry!"

His grip tightened. "If apologies fixed everything, we wouldn't need prisons."

"Then what do you want? I touched your butt - feel free to touch mine!"

Silence swallowed the car.
###Chapter 161



Nathaniel found himself staring into Evelyn's wide, guileless eyes, feeling like the villain in their twisted love story.

A sudden reckless impulse surged through his veins.

His gaze dropped to the soft curve of her mouth. Before reason could intervene, Nathaniel closed the distance between them, capturing Evelyn's protests with his lips.

Evelyn froze in shock.

What was happening?

She pressed her palms against Nathaniel's chest, attempting to push him away.

But Nathaniel's arms were like steel bands, refusing to yield to her struggles.

Evelyn's eyes flew open as she stared at the man currently devouring her.

His stormy sea-green eyes seemed capable of swallowing her whole.

The temperature inside the luxury car spiked dangerously.

Evelyn's fingers twisted in Nathaniel's designer shirt, caught between fighting him off and pulling him closer.

Finally, she bit down hard on his lower lip, drawing a pained grunt from Nathaniel as he broke the kiss.

His eyes burned with intensity, the veins in them standing out against the reddened whites.

An electric silence filled the vehicle.

Nathaniel wiped the corner of his mouth with his thumb, his voice dangerously low. "Did you just bite me?"

Evelyn glared defiantly, her lips pursed. "What if I did? Who gave you the right to kiss me without permission? That's assault, Mr. Whitmore! You're behaving like a complete scoundrel!"

A dark chuckle escaped Nathaniel. "Now you understand what harassment feels like? I was just giving you a dose of your own medicine. Can't handle it?" he taunted.

Evelyn's mouth opened and closed like a fish before she recovered. "That's different! I barely touched you, and you—you kissed me!"

"Legally speaking, both actions carry the same weight. No difference at all," Nathaniel countered, one eyebrow arched, something unreadable flashing in his gaze.

Squirming uncomfortably beneath him, Evelyn's cheeks burned. "Would you please let me go now?"

Nathaniel caged her in, one arm braced against the car door. "You did bite me though. How do you propose we settle that debt?"



Evelyn seethed. Was Nathaniel seriously trying to turn this around on her?

She'd had enough of his games.

"Mr. Whitmore, this charade ends now. I'm not here to stroke your ego. Let's call it even and move on," she snapped.

Nathaniel's grip tightened around her delicate wrist. "Interesting. You resist me but throw yourself at other men so easily?"

His words struck like a physical blow, making Evelyn flinch as pain lanced through her heart.

To Nathaniel, she would always be that gold-digging social climber - someone who'd do anything for money and status.

Fine. If that's what he believed, she'd play the part.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "Of course. As long as the upgrade is significant enough, no ex is worth remembering."

Nathaniel's laugh was dark with frustration. "Remember, sweetheart, our divorce isn't finalized yet. We're still very much married."

His gaze lingered on Evelyn's deceptively innocent face, noting the slight swelling of her kiss-bruised lips. Unexpectedly, the memory of their kiss didn't repulse him as much as he'd expected.

"Is the dating bar set so high these days? Must they be single? What's wrong with someone going through a divorce?" Evelyn fired back.

"Nathaniel, I never realized how quick-witted you are. You'd do well on a debate show," she added sarcastically.

"Likewise. With my exceptional qualities, I see our impending divorce as the perfect fresh start."

"Mr. Whitmore, your insights are truly... enlightening," Evelyn quipped.

Ever since the divorce discussions began, Nathaniel found his patience wearing thinner by the day.
###Chapter 162



A sharp rap against the car window shattered the tense silence.

Nathaniel Whitmore frowned, rolling down the window with deliberate slowness. "Who is it?"

A middle-aged man in a fluorescent traffic vest stood outside, arms crossed. "This is a no-parking zone. Move your vehicle to the hotel lot down the street." His tone left no room for argument.

Evelyn Carter immediately buried her face in her hands, cheeks burning with humiliation.

Nathaniel straightened his posture, his expression unreadable.

Robert Chambers and Frederick Whitmore sprang into action, swiftly relocating the car to a legal spot.

Yet, the air inside remained thick with discomfort.

Robert and Frederick exchanged glances, wishing they could evaporate on the spot.

Nathaniel looked disheveled—his tie discarded, his collar undone, and his suit jacket wrinkled.

Evelyn, meanwhile, discreetly adjusted her clothes before leaning forward. "Just drop me off at the next subway station," she whispered to Robert.

Robert hesitated, flicking a nervous glance at Nathaniel in the rearview mirror. Without explicit permission, he didn’t dare stop.

Evelyn stole a glance at Nathaniel beside her. His jaw was set, his expression unyielding.

Nathaniel finally broke the silence. "Pull over. You do realize fuel isn’t free, don’t you?"

Minutes later, the car halted outside the subway station.

Evelyn didn’t look back as she flung the door open and disappeared into the crowd.

Nathaniel watched until she vanished, his gaze lingering a second too long.

Robert cleared his throat. "Sir… should we stop by the hospital for that?" He gestured vaguely toward Nathaniel’s lip.

Nathaniel touched the small cut—courtesy of Evelyn’s teeth.

He exhaled sharply, tossing his phone onto the seat beside him. "Find out why Evelyn went to Oakwood Village."

Something about her reaction had been off. And Nathaniel intended to uncover exactly what—or who—had unsettled her.



Evelyn rode the subway back to the studio, her mind racing.

Nathaniel’s impulsiveness had left her shaken. That kiss—if it could even be called that—had been more like an attack. No finesse, just raw desperation.

Hadn’t he learned anything from his time with Victoria Sinclair?

Cassandra Blake intercepted her at the studio entrance. "Evelyn! You’re back early." Her eyes flicked to Evelyn’s swollen lips. "You don’t look so good."

Evelyn met her gaze coolly. "Surprised to see me? Or did you expect I wouldn’t make it back today?"

If not for Nathaniel’s sudden appearance at Oakwood Village, she might not have.

The whole situation was suspicious. A high-profile design order, handed directly to her? Orders like that didn’t just fall into someone’s lap.

Cassandra’s earlier comment had carried an odd weight.

Now, under Evelyn’s scrutiny, Cassandra shifted uncomfortably. "Just making conversation. Why so defensive?"

Without waiting for a reply, she hurried toward the break room.

The moment she was alone, Cassandra dialed Penelope Whitmore. "It’s done. Evelyn’s made progress with Reginald Stewart."

A pause. Then, a smirk. "They haven’t slept together yet, but judging by her lips, it won’t be long."
###Chapter 163

"Outstanding job! You may proceed to the boutique to collect your handbag. I'll personally notify the manager of your arrival."

"Thank you, Ms. Whitmore. Should you require anything else in the future, don't hesitate to call on me. After all, I still have unfinished business with Evelyn."

After ending the call, Cassandra was practically giddy, already envisioning the designer bag she would soon possess.

She confided in Penelope that once Evelyn stepped foot into Oakside Villa, escaping unscathed would be nearly impossible.

Despite Evelyn’s early return, her slightly swollen lips betrayed the passionate encounter she’d had.

Given these developments, Cassandra was more than eager to have Evelyn take over tending to Reginald.

That afternoon, Evelyn found herself distracted. Every sip of water sent a tingling sensation across her lips, involuntarily dragging her thoughts back to the kiss she’d shared with Nathaniel.

She buried her face in her hands, grappling with the unsettling realization that she might be losing her composure.

"No, I need to stay focused," she muttered to herself.

Pouring a glass of ice-cold water, she scoffed at the absurdity of harboring any feelings for Nathaniel.

The next morning, Evelyn headed straight to the studio after her classes.

It wasn’t long before chaos erupted outside, drawing everyone’s attention.

A shrill voice sliced through the air. "Where’s Evelyn? Drag that woman out here right now! I can’t believe someone so young would dare cozy up to my father!"

"My dad is practically knocking on death’s door, and you still have the audacity to seduce him! Do you even care what happens to him?"

Stepping out to investigate, Evelyn was met with the sight of a young woman draped in designer attire, her features striking an uncanny resemblance to Reginald—whom she’d encountered at Oakwood Villa just the day before.

Guilt-ridden, Cassandra quietly slipped into a nearby hiding spot before making her escape from the studio unnoticed.

Having indulged in questionable substances during her time with Reginald, Cassandra hadn’t anticipated being confronted by his children. Laying low seemed like the wisest course of action.

"So, you must be Evelyn," Genevieve sneered, her tone dripping with disdain. "How shameless! Does your family not teach you any decency?"

Despite the venom in her words, Evelyn remained composed. "Miss, if you’re going to make such serious accusations, you’d better have proof."

"You’re the real drama queen here. Must be a family trait!" Genevieve shot back.

Evelyn smirked. "I’m just giving you a taste of your own medicine. Why so angry? If you keep causing a scene, I’ll have no choice but to call the police."

"Call the police? Go ahead! Once we’re there, I’ll make sure you’re arrested! Let’s investigate the drugs you’ve been feeding my father. The doctor warned they could kill him!"

As Evelyn recalled the unsettling events of the previous day, she struggled to reconcile the idea of Reginald being involved in such activities.

Still, it had nothing to do with her. Why should she fear the police?

Just then, Jonathan stepped in. "Excuse me, miss, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. No one in my studio fits that description. Are you certain you have the right place?"

"What misunderstanding? Evelyn, do you deny visiting my father’s villa yesterday?"

Evelyn nodded. "I did go, but purely for work."

Genevieve scoffed. "What kind of work? You obviously went there to seduce him! His mansion doesn’t need renovations—stop lying!"

Jonathan interjected coolly, "We have records of this design order. Ms. Carter visited your father’s villa as part of a standard workflow. If you’re going to slander my colleague, we’ll have no choice but to pursue legal action."

"Legal action? Please, you’re just a bunch of nobodies—what rights do you even have?" Genevieve mocked.

Jonathan’s expression darkened. "We may be employees, but the women in my studio earn their living through skill. They’re not beneath anyone. Now, I suggest you leave before this escalates further."
###Chapter 164



"Fine, if that's how you all want to play this, just wait and see!" Genevieve spat before storming out of the studio.

With her departure, the tension in the room eased slightly, but Evelyn couldn’t shake the unsettling weight of her colleagues’ lingering stares. Their gazes prickled at her skin, leaving her restless.

Breaking the silence, Jonathan cleared his throat. "Let’s all take a step back. I’ll personally ensure the rights of our female employees are protected."

Relief washed over Evelyn. "Thank you, Jonathan. I appreciate your trust in me."

"Of course. I know your character. Workplace politics can be messy, but I’ll handle this." He hesitated before adding, "We can let this design order go."

Evelyn shook her head. "Actually, I’ve already secured the contract."

Jonathan’s brows lifted in surprise. "You have?"

The revelation caught him off guard. He hadn’t expected her to confirm the deal so soon.

"Yes, but there’s nothing underhanded about it," Evelyn clarified.

She deliberately avoided mentioning Nathaniel’s involvement. Bringing him up now would only complicate things further.

After a beat, Jonathan smiled. "I never doubted you. You are Evelyn Carter, after all."

She forced a smile in return, but unease still coiled in her chest. As she returned to her desk, her mood remained heavy.

Her eyelid twitched incessantly—a nagging sign that this wasn’t over.

The next morning, the studio was flooded with calls—just as a scandalous tweet went viral.

"Renowned designer Evelyn Carter accused of securing high-profile contracts through unethical means. Sources claim she drugged an elderly client to manipulate a deal, leading to a confrontation with the family."

The post spread like wildfire, amassing thousands of retweets within hours.

Evelyn was jolted awake by Sophia’s frantic call. "Evelyn, wake up! Check your messages—someone’s smearing your name online!"

Adrenaline shot through her.



She snatched her phone, her fingers trembling as she read the headline. Fury burned through her veins.

"None of this is true!" she hissed.

"I know," Sophia said, "but people believe what they see. Evelyn, who would do this? Should we involve the police?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I think I know who’s behind it."

After hanging up, she took a steadying breath before dialing Sebastian.

His groggy voice answered. "Evelyn?"

She winced, suddenly remembering the time difference between Nord City and Bern City. "Sebastian, I’m sorry—did I wake you?"

"Hey, it’s fine. What’s wrong? Do you need help?"

She hesitated. "Can you trace a Twitter account for me?"

"Whose?"

She forwarded the tweet. "I need to know who posted this."

Sebastian’s drowsiness vanished instantly. His voice turned sharp. "I’m on it."

Who dared attack his sister like this?

He bolted upright, flipping open his laptop and speed-dialing his brothers.

Grumbled protests answered.

"Sebastian, this better be life or death!"

"Do you have any idea what time it is?"

Sebastian didn’t flinch. "Someone’s spreading lies about Evelyn. It’s blowing up in Bern City. She asked for our help tracking the source."

A beat of silence.

Then, in unison: "We’re in."
###Chapter 165

Nathaniel's sharp words sent an immediate ripple of tension through the Montgomery brothers on the call.

Alexander's face darkened as he scanned the viral tweet. "Andrew, has your legal team formulated a response strategy?" His voice carried an edge of concern.

Andrew's response was clipped and decisive. "We're on it. Finding this anonymous coward is our top priority. They won't escape consequences for this slander."

Within hours, all five brothers mobilized their resources, launching parallel investigations to uncover the source of the damaging allegations.

Meanwhile, Evelyn tossed restlessly in bed, the pounding in her temples making sleep impossible after Nathaniel's unsettling call.

Morning found her mechanically preparing for work, though it was Saturday and the studio should have been empty.

The office buzzed with unusual weekend activity when Evelyn arrived. But as she entered the design floor, an oppressive silence fell over the space.

She didn't need to guess the reason for this icy reception.

Cassandra's mocking voice sliced through the tension. "How brave of you to show your face. Are you really so shameless?"

"Multiple clients are questioning if our studio's success comes from... certain favors." She spat the words with venom. "You're ruining our professional reputations."

Evelyn straightened her shoulders. "These are malicious lies, just like yesterday's rumors. I'm filing a police report today."

At the mention of law enforcement, Cassandra's smirk faltered slightly. After all, she'd been the one to drug Reginald.

Now she was deflecting all blame onto Evelyn.

Would an investigation expose her own crimes?

But remembering Penelope's assurances, Cassandra regained her composure. "Who's to say you're not lying? Your presence here is toxic."

The other female designers exchanged uneasy glances. Such rumors were every professional woman's nightmare.

Jonathan emerged from his office with a troubled expression. "Evelyn, I didn't anticipate this escalating so severely. It's damaging our studio's credibility."

Evelyn offered a tight nod. "I understand completely. I'll handle it."

Her phone's sudden vibration made her heart leap - was it Nathaniel?

The caller ID showed Nathaniel Whitmore instead.

This unexpected development caught her off guard. "Excuse me, I need to take this," she murmured to Jonathan before retreating to the break room.

"Hello?"

"Making tabloid headlines now, Evelyn?" Nathaniel's sardonic tone dripped through the receiver.

In his penthouse office, Nathaniel glared at the trending topic on his screen, his jaw clenched tight.

The scandal involved Oakside Village - the same place Evelyn had mysteriously called him about days earlier without proper explanation.

Clearly, more than a simple game had occurred there that night.

Evelyn's voice turned brittle. "You think I wanted this attention?"

"So you're retreating now? Where's that famous Carter courage? Truth or dare - let's see how far this rabbit hole goes," he taunted.

Despite exhaustive investigations, Nathaniel had hit dead ends. But this viral scandal confirmed one thing - that cryptic call had been a distress signal.

She always spoke in riddles.

Evelyn's bitter laugh echoed down the line. "Congratulations, you've had your fun mocking me. Mission accomplished."

The call ended with a decisive click.

Nathaniel stared at his phone in disbelief before turning to Robert. "That woman is impossible! I shouldn't have bothered." His fist slammed against the desk.
###Chapter 166

Nathaniel had already reached out to Evelyn. Why couldn't she just ask for help when she needed it?

The last time she'd called him for assistance, she'd laced her words with honey, calling him "darling" to soften him up.

Robert hesitated before asking, "Mr. Whitmore, what should we do now?"

"Do I really have to explain? Get that trending topic removed!" Nathaniel snapped, his irritation sharp.

Robert complied immediately, but soon, his team reported back.

With a puzzled frown, Robert said, "Mr. Whitmore, someone already requested the removal of the trending topic. The popularity has dropped significantly."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Who made the request?"

"It was Mr. Daniel Montgomery from Nord City."

At the mention of that name, Nathaniel's mood soured further. "Why are you just standing there? Keep digging. Find out who's behind this."

To Nathaniel, removing a trending topic meant little.

After all, he was in Bern City. What could Daniel, all the way in Nord City, possibly uncover?

After the call, Evelyn returned to the office, only to be met with icy glares from her colleagues.

As she reached her desk, Cassandra scoffed. "Evelyn, you actually have the nerve to show up today."

"Because of you, we had to work overtime this weekend. Your scandal dragged us all into this mess! Don’t you think you owe us an apology?"

Evelyn lifted her gaze, meeting Cassandra’s and the others’ eyes. "I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this situation has caused."

"However, this was caused by someone spreading malicious rumors about me. I intend to get to the bottom of it and expose the truth."

A flicker of unease crossed Cassandra’s face, but remembering Penelope’s reassurances, she regained her composure.

Even if Evelyn uncovered the truth, what could she really do?

Cassandra had Penelope—a powerful member of the Whitmore family—backing her. What threat could a nobody like Evelyn possibly pose?

With a mocking smirk, Cassandra said, "Words are cheap. How do we know you’re not just lying?"

"Evelyn, if you don’t handle this properly, the women in this studio won’t let you off easy."

Charlotte, a designer who usually sided with Cassandra, chimed in, "Exactly! Because of you, my potential suitor heard about this and ghosted me. You’d better take responsibility!"

"Yeah, the news was everywhere on social media. Millions must have seen it by now."

Cassandra pulled out her phone, searching for the headlines. Her brows furrowed. "Wait—why is the post gone? It was trending just a minute ago. How did it disappear?"

The other women checked their phones, murmuring in agreement. "It’s really gone. Not on the trending list anymore."

Cassandra blurted out, "How is that possible?"

Realizing her slip, she quickly added, "I mean, it was just at the top. How did it vanish so fast? That’s suspicious!"

Evelyn smiled knowingly. "Are you upset that it’s gone? Or were you hoping this would get even worse?"

Watching Cassandra’s reaction, Evelyn grew more certain of her involvement.

Cassandra straightened, snapping back, "Evelyn, don’t twist my words. Why would I want this to escalate?"

Just then, Cassandra’s phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID, her eyes darting nervously around the room.
###Chapter 167



Evelyn noticed Cassandra's phone buzzing insistently. "Who's calling you? Why aren't you picking up?"

Cassandra scoffed. "Since when do you care who I talk to?"

She brushed past Evelyn and stepped outside, answering the call with a tense voice. "Ms. Whitmore, is everything alright?"

Penelope's sharp tone crackled through the line. "Why did the trending hashtag die? What happened to your so-called media connections? Weren't you boasting about your influential friends?"

A pause. Then the threat. "If you can't fix this, forget about that Chanel bag you were drooling over yesterday."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her own phone as she eavesdropped.

Cassandra's voice turned pleading. "I'm sorry, Ms. Whitmore. I'll make some calls right away."

But when she dialed her contact, no one answered.

Frustration twisted her features. "Why isn't anyone picking up? Did they all suddenly decide to ghost me?"

Evelyn stepped forward, her voice icy. "So it was you."

Cassandra spun around, face draining of color. "Evelyn! How long have you been standing there?"

"Long enough." Evelyn's gaze was unflinching. "Let's be honest, Cassandra. You're the one who drugged Reginald, aren't you?"

"And now you're trying to pin it all on me."

Cassandra's hands trembled. "I don't know what you're talking about. That call was about design work. You're misunderstanding."

Evelyn smirked. "Look in a mirror. Your guilt is written all over your face."

She held up her phone. "I could call the police right now. Spreading false accusations is a crime. I won't hesitate to press charges."

Cassandra swallowed hard.

Evelyn pressed on. "Unless you want handcuffs, you'll publicly clarify this mess and apologize. Now."

The threat hung between them.

Then Evelyn softened slightly. "Tell me who's really behind this, and I'll let you walk away."

She needed Cassandra to crack—to expose Penelope and Victoria.

But before Cassandra could respond, Jonathan appeared.

Spotting him, Cassandra straightened. "Why should I apologize? This isn't my fault!"

Evelyn's patience snapped. "This is your last chance to come clean."

"Last chance?" Cassandra sneered. "You're the one who caused this! Maybe you should apologize to the entire studio!"

A cold glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes. She'd hoped for cooperation, but Cassandra was too stubborn.

Jonathan stepped between them. "Enough. The police are already handling it. The truth will come out soon."

Cassandra paled further at the mention of law enforcement.

Unbeknownst to her, Evelyn had already received damning evidence from Sebastian—proof of who really orchestrated the lies.

She'd wanted to give Cassandra an out, seeing her as just another pawn.

But now?

Evelyn pocketed her phone, decision made.

Some people didn't deserve second chances.


###Chapter 168

Evelyn locked gazes with Jonathan, her expression unreadable. "Jonathan, I've uncovered who's behind the smear campaign against me."

Surprised, Jonathan leaned forward. "Who is it?"

Beside him, Cassandra shifted uncomfortably. "Evelyn, without solid proof, you shouldn't make reckless accusations," she warned, her voice tight.

A faint, knowing smile curved Evelyn’s lips. "Don’t worry, Jonathan. I’ll handle everything myself this afternoon. The studio won’t face any backlash."

Jonathan hesitated, then sighed. "Evelyn, if you know who’s responsible, just tell me. I’ll help you deal with it."

"It’s fine. You’ll find out soon enough," Evelyn replied before turning back to her desk.

Pulling out her phone, she texted Sebastian. "Sebastian, I need a favor."

His reply was immediate. "Name it."

"Can you send these videos and photos to Reginald’s children for me?"

Her eyes flickered briefly toward Cassandra, who had just walked in with Jonathan.

Cassandra had missed her chance to make amends. Now, Evelyn felt no obligation to be polite.

By lunchtime, Evelyn sat alone at her desk, eating quietly. The rest of the team, led by Cassandra, had deliberately excluded her.

Not that she cared. Petty office politics were beneath her.

Besides, the real drama was yet to come.

She quickly reassured her family in their group chat. "I’m fine. Everything will be settled this afternoon. Don’t worry about me."

Little did they know, Sebastian had already stepped in.

Meanwhile, in Nord City, Alexander’s mood darkened when he saw the baseless rumors about Evelyn.

Without hesitation, he ordered his team to dig into Reginald’s background. An acquisition team was already en route to Bern City.

The audacity of someone slandering Evelyn—claiming she was involved with an older man for money—was infuriating.

Those who dared to cross her would soon regret it.

Alexander called his subordinates, his voice icy. "Make sure their company’s stocks plummet within 24 hours."

"And within three days, I want that company acquired—by any means necessary."

At the same time, Andrew mobilized his legal team, preparing lawsuits against every individual spreading lies about Evelyn.

No one would escape accountability.

Then came Harrison’s public statement.

"Let me introduce Evelyn Carter—the most important person in my life."

"She is kind, pure, and utterly extraordinary. To those spreading rumors, may karma find you swiftly."

Harrison’s announcement instantly overshadowed the earlier gossip. The previous rumors had been nothing but speculation, with no official responses.

Now, with Harrison confirming their relationship, the lies were exposed.

His fans rallied behind them, praising his integrity for standing by Evelyn publicly.

"Now that’s a real man! He didn’t hesitate to defend her."

"My respect for Harrison just skyrocketed."

Evelyn blinked in surprise when she saw the announcement.

Had Harrison really just publicly claimed her?

While the rumors now seemed to be shifting in her favor, she wasn’t sure if this was a good thing.

She messaged Daniel on WhatsApp. "Daniel, did you ask Harrison to do this?"

Despite being scolded by his manager, Daniel replied calmly. "Yes. Now no one will believe those lies."

Evelyn’s emotions tangled. She hadn’t expected Daniel to involve Harrison—and she certainly hadn’t expected Harrison to agree.

Still, she’d wait until she had solid evidence before responding further.

Back in the studio, her colleagues reacted strangely to the news.

Jonathan stepped out of his office, his expression unreadable as he studied Evelyn. "Evelyn… is it true? Are you really with Harrison?"
###Chapter 169

Evelyn exhaled softly. "No, Harrison merely did me a small favor, that's all," she said quietly.

The vague statement from Harrison had worked better than she'd anticipated.

Jonathan's sharp gaze lingered on her. "Evelyn, I never realized you were acquainted with Harrison Sinclair!" he exclaimed.

Evelyn shot a glance at Cassandra, whose expression had darkened with displeasure.

"Honestly, having Harrison's support doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things," Evelyn remarked, a hint of sarcasm lacing her words.

Cassandra's jealousy flared at the comment.

After all, she was just as accomplished as Evelyn—so why did Evelyn always seem to have connections with people like the famous Harrison Sinclair?

Evelyn checked the time. Their guests would be arriving soon.

She forced a polite smile toward Cassandra. "Jonathan, don't worry. I'll explain everything later."

"Evelyn, if you have proof, just show it now," Jonathan suggested, suspicion creeping into his tone.

"It's not the right moment yet."

Cassandra scoffed. "You keep claiming you have evidence, yet you refuse to present it. Who would believe you? Harrison is just an actor, after all."

"In this industry, he probably slept his way to the top. His endorsement doesn’t clear your name."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Cassandra, your breath reeks. Did you forget basic hygiene this morning? Harrison earned his success through talent."

"Spreading baseless rumors reflects poorly on you. Did your mother never teach you manners?"

She wouldn’t let anyone slander Harrison’s reputation. Daniel had worked as his stunt double for years—both of them had poured effort into their careers.

Cassandra raised her chin defiantly. "Oh, touched a nerve, did I? Or are you just guilty?"

Evelyn inhaled deeply. Some people didn’t deserve sympathy.

She had given Cassandra multiple chances to come clean.

But now, with the evidence about to go public, Cassandra’s reputation would be ruined for good.

Some people were beyond redemption. Cassandra was proof of that.

Turning to Jonathan, Evelyn said, "You're right. I'll upload the evidence now. The truth will come out."

Jonathan nodded. "Good idea."

Cassandra smirked. "Go ahead. Let’s all see this so-called proof."

She was certain Evelyn was bluffing. If there was real evidence, Evelyn would have revealed it long ago.

How could she stay so calm otherwise? Cassandra wouldn’t fall for this trick.

Just then, several figures strode into the studio.

The woman leading them looked familiar—Genevieve Stewart, daughter of Reginald Stewart, who had visited earlier.

Cassandra’s lips curled in triumph. "Evelyn, looks like you have company."

"Since you claim to have proof, you’d better explain quickly. Avoid unnecessary trouble."

Evelyn smirked coldly. "Oh, I think you’ve misunderstood. The one who needs to explain isn’t me."

"Not you? Then who?" Cassandra’s gaze flickered toward Genevieve, unease flickering across her face.

But she quickly regained composure, convinced Genevieve was here for Evelyn.

With a smug tone, she addressed Genevieve. "Evelyn was just boasting about having evidence to clear her name."

Before she could finish, Genevieve’s hand struck her cheek with a sharp crack.

Cassandra staggered, stunned. "W-Why did you hit me?"
###Chapter 170

"Because you're a vile creature, that's why!" Genevieve spat venomously.

Cassandra shrieked in protest, "But I'm not Evelyn! She's Evelyn!"

"We're not here for Evelyn. We came for you, Cassandra!" Genevieve snapped, her voice sharp as a blade.

Without warning, she hurled a stack of photographs directly at Cassandra's face, the glossy images fluttering to the ground like fallen leaves.

The photos captured Cassandra in compromising positions with Reginald—perched on his lap, locked in passionate embraces, and even more scandalous moments.

As Cassandra's eyes landed on the damning evidence, her face drained of color. "This can't be real. How did these even exist?"

How had these pictures surfaced here?

Evelyn turned to Cassandra, her tone eerily calm. "This is the proof I mentioned earlier. Pity you didn't believe me this morning."

Cassandra's hands trembled, a cold dread seeping into her bones.

How was this possible? How had Evelyn gotten her hands on these incriminating shots?

Jonathan, staring at the photos in disbelief, demanded, "Cassandra, what the hell is this?"

Could it be that the woman entangled with Reginald wasn’t Evelyn—but Cassandra herself?

"Jonathan, these photos are fake! Every single one has been photoshopped!" Cassandra insisted, her voice shrill with desperation. "Evelyn set this whole thing up to ruin me!"

If she admitted the truth now, her reputation would be beyond repair.

Her finger shot toward Evelyn, accusation dripping from her words. "She’s just trying to shift the blame onto me!"

"The truth is, she’s the one involved with that disgusting old man, not me!"

Evelyn smirked, unfazed. "Still denying it? If you think photos can be faked, what about the video I just uploaded? That can’t be doctored, can it?"

Jonathan quickly pulled out his phone, pulling up the webpage. The video played, crystal-clear audio confirming it was unmistakably Cassandra’s voice.

There was no escaping the truth now.

Cassandra’s body shook violently as she watched. How had Evelyn gotten this footage?

It shouldn’t have been possible!

A sharp yank on her hair sent pain shooting through her scalp.

Genevieve leaned in, her voice dripping with malice. "Anything else to say? You set this whole thing up, yet you still had the nerve to drag others into it!"

Cassandra endured a flurry of brutal slaps, her face swelling instantly. Lipstick smeared, tears and snot streaked down her cheeks.

The studio staff watched the savage scene unfold, but not a single soul stepped forward to intervene.

Genevieve hadn’t come alone—several hulking bodyguards flanked her, making it clear she’d planned this confrontation meticulously.

Under the relentless assault, Cassandra’s wild gaze found Evelyn. "Why am I the only one suffering? Evelyn’s just as guilty! She was with your father days ago!"

"You know she’s been to his villa. Don’t you know that once your father picks a woman, none of them escape?"

Silence fell like a guillotine.

Genevieve’s head snapped toward Evelyn, her voice icy. "Is that true?"

Cassandra seized the moment. "It is! I passed out after eating something at the villa. When I woke up, I was in your father’s bed. Evelyn was there too!"

"She didn’t eat anything, but she still couldn’t avoid what happened. When she came back that night, her lips were swollen from kissing!"

"And somehow, she even landed a design contract from your father’s villa!"

Hearing the twisted tale, Evelyn couldn’t help but burst into laughter.
###Chapter 171

Evelyn gazed down at Cassandra sprawled on the marble floor, her lips curling in amusement.

"Your performance deserves an Oscar. What a waste you didn't pursue acting professionally."

Cassandra glared up with venom in her eyes. "Evelyn, don't change the subject. Explain how you obtained that design contract!"

The entire studio staff held their breath, waiting.

Without hesitation, Evelyn stepped closer to Genevieve, lowering her voice. "I'm aware of the zoning violations on your family's golf course development."

"If this information leaks, your father's company stock could plummet overnight."

Genevieve's face paled. "How could you possibly know that?"

This was privileged information known only to their inner circle. How did some junior designer uncover their secrets?

Evelyn shrugged casually. "Irrelevant. Just know this is why I secured the contract and walked out of your father's office untouched."

Genevieve's manicured nails dug into her palms. While skeptical, she couldn't ignore the truth in Evelyn's words about their problematic land deals.

Suddenly, Genevieve spun and delivered a stinging slap across Cassandra's cheek.

"You scheming little bitch! No wonder you manipulated my father so easily!" she shrieked.

With photographic evidence in hand, Genevieve saw no reason to hold back.

Cassandra's bewildered gaze darted between them. What magic words had Evelyn whispered to turn the tables so completely?

Desperate, she turned to Charlotte. "Help me! Call the police!"

Charlotte ducked behind a desk. "After you ruined my blind date and got our studio blacklisted? You're lucky I don't join in!"

Beatrice crossed her arms with a sneer. "Now we know how you afforded those designer bags - sleeping with married executives!"

The studio buzzed with murmurs of agreement. No one moved to defend Cassandra.

Jonathan sighed, rubbing his temples. "Enough. If someone gets seriously injured, we'll all face legal consequences."

Beatrice huffed but relented. "Fine. I'll drag her outside then."

As security approached, Cassandra crawled toward Evelyn on bloodied knees. "It wasn't my idea! Penelope made me do it!"

Evelyn stepped back gracefully. "The photos don't lie. I gave you a chance to confess this morning."

She gestured to the damning evidence scattered across the floor. "Karma's a bitch, isn't she?"

Cassandra's mind flashed to that morning when she'd overheard Evelyn's mysterious phone call. If only she'd listened to the warning.

Four broad-shouldered bodyguards materialized, hauling the sobbing woman away. The studio fell into uneasy silence, the air thick with unspoken questions.

Jonathan cleared his throat. "Everyone back to work." But the tension lingered like gunpowder after an explosion.
###Chapter 172

The morning sun cast long shadows as Cassandra Blake launched her vicious campaign to ruin Evelyn Carter's reputation. But by afternoon, the tables had turned dramatically.

It was Cassandra who stood exposed, her secret affair with Reginald Stewart laid bare for all to see.

Jonathan Reeves cleared his throat, turning to Natalie Chambers at the reception desk. "Get someone to clean up the lobby. There's not much left to do here. Everyone can head home early today."

Within minutes, the studio emptied, leaving only Jonathan and Evelyn behind.

Evelyn lifted her gaze, regret lacing her voice. "Now that the truth is out, I've caused trouble for the studio."

"I never doubted you, Evelyn. I just never expected Cassandra to be capable of something like this."

Jonathan's expression darkened. "The studio will issue a termination notice soon. It's getting late—let's grab dinner after we wrap this up."

"Alright."

Evelyn couldn't refuse. Not after everything Jonathan had done for her today.

Soon, Jonathan retreated to his office to finalize the paperwork.

Alone at her desk, Evelyn opened her laptop and pulled up the incriminating photos and videos she had anonymously posted.

The comment section buzzed with reactions—shock, outrage, disbelief.

Seeing Cassandra's downfall unfold, Evelyn decided to delete the posts.

But it was too late. The damage was done. The scandal had already spread like wildfire.

Then, she stumbled upon a trending post from a major media outlet:

"Evelyn Carter was the victim of a jealous colleague who fabricated lies to tarnish her reputation. The truth has now emerged, exposing the real culprit behind the smear campaign."

Evelyn clicked on it, reading the detailed breakdown of the false accusations.

Yet, it failed to mention the others who had conspired with Cassandra.

Another headline caught her eye:

"A top law firm in Nord City has filed a lawsuit against the CEO and family of a prominent construction company, demanding a public apology for defaming Evelyn Carter."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

That was Nathaniel Whitmore's firm.

Her brothers had rallied behind her.

A warmth spread through her chest.

This—this was what family felt like.

An hour later, Jonathan emerged from his office. "Evelyn, we need to stop by the police station to finalize the report."

"Let's go."

Gratitude swelled in her heart. Jonathan had stood by her from the start, even reporting the matter to the police.

Now, she was determined to see this through with him.

By the time they left the station, night had fallen.

As Jonathan drove, he glanced at her. "Any cravings for dinner?"

"Anything's fine. Let's just pick somewhere close."

Exhaustion weighed on her. All she wanted was to go home and rest.

Thirty minutes later, Jonathan parked outside a restaurant.

Turning to her, he hesitated. "Evelyn… did you hire a lawyer?"

She met his gaze, understanding his unspoken question.

"My brother works at that firm. When he heard about the accusations, he stepped in."

Jonathan frowned. "But I thought you were an orphan?"

"I was. But I've found my family now."

"Really? That's incredible. Are they from Nord City?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yes."

"Impressive. Having a brother at such a prestigious firm speaks volumes. Your biological family must be well-off compared to your adoptive one."

He smiled. "You seem happier lately."

"Thank you."

She was happier.

Stepping into the restaurant, she froze.

A familiar figure sat at a corner table.

The world really was too small.
###Chapter 173



Evelyn caught sight of Victoria walking ahead, the unexpected encounter instantly souring her mood.

When Victoria turned and noticed Evelyn, her expression darkened visibly.

Fresh off a call with Penelope, Victoria was still reeling from the events at the studio earlier that day. It was baffling how effortlessly Evelyn had wriggled out of trouble.

Where had Evelyn gotten those damning videos and photos? And more intriguingly, how had she managed to secure Andrew’s firm to personally step in and demand accountability?

A wave of discomfort washed over Victoria, her face turning icy as she brushed past Evelyn.

Spotting Victoria’s approach, Evelyn turned to Jonathan and said casually, “I just ran into someone I know. Jonathan, why don’t you grab a seat and wait for me?”

Jonathan nodded understandingly, stepping aside to give them privacy.

Evelyn turned back to Victoria, her voice cool. “You and Penelope were behind the Cassandra incident, weren’t you?”

“Honestly, I never expected you to slip out of it so easily. That did catch me off guard,” Victoria admitted with a smirk.

“But that’s not the point. I wanted to let you know that Nathaniel and I are getting engaged. I’ll be sending invitations to my brothers for the ceremony.”

“You’d better keep a low profile. If my brothers find out what you’ve done, they won’t go easy on you,” she added, her tone dripping with warning.

Crossing her arms, Evelyn met her gaze squarely. “If I uncover proof that you’re involved in this, don’t think for a second I’ll let you off lightly.”

Victoria scoffed. “Go ahead, if you can even find the evidence. Just remember—my brother owns the top law firm in Nord City.”

“One call from me, and they won’t lift a finger to help you.”

Her eyes flicked toward the restaurant entrance, and she abruptly changed the subject. “Evelyn, I never took you for the type to cozy up to men so easily.”

“Dining out with someone else behind Nathaniel’s back… What do you think he’d do if he found out? Dump you?” she sneered.

Realizing Victoria’s game, Evelyn didn’t bother explaining. “My personal life is none of your business. Whether I date one man or ten is entirely up to me,” she shot back.

As the words left her lips, Evelyn noticed an odd glint in Victoria’s eyes—something almost gleeful.

A sudden tension prickled the air. Evelyn turned and found herself locking gazes with Nathaniel.



The intensity in his narrowed, dark eyes made her expression freeze.

Of course. Now she understood why Victoria had shifted the conversation so abruptly. She’d been waiting for Nathaniel to arrive all along.

Evelyn quickly composed herself. With their divorce proceedings underway, she had no patience for more complications.

Without hesitation, she turned back to Jonathan. “Let’s go.”

Glancing at Nathaniel and Victoria across the room, Jonathan studied Evelyn with curiosity. “How do you know them? Isn’t that Nathaniel Whitmore, the heir to the Whitmore Group, and his rumored fiancée?”

Evelyn stiffened slightly. “You recognize them?”

Nathaniel was notoriously private, so few people knew him by sight.

“I saw them at an event once. Someone pointed him out,” Jonathan explained.

Lowering her gaze, Evelyn offered a vague reply. “I used to work as a caretaker for Eleanor Whitmore. That’s how I know the family.”

“Ah, I see.”

Jonathan glanced back, only to meet Nathaniel’s piercing, ice-cold stare.

The sheer hostility radiating from Nathaniel made it impossible to hold his gaze. Jonathan couldn’t shake the feeling of being sized up—like prey.

He looked at Evelyn beside him. Was he imagining things, or was there something more between them?
###Chapter 174

Evelyn stood firm, her resolve unshaken despite everything she'd endured.

Nathaniel remained motionless, his piercing gaze withdrawing before he turned toward the nearby elevator.

Victoria hurried after him, her voice laced with excitement. "Nathaniel, I was thinking—I'd love to have my brothers at our engagement ceremony. What do you think?"

His response was indifferent. "Do as you please."

Their engagement was nothing more than a transaction, a calculated move.

A sly smile curved Victoria's lips. "Nathaniel, is this a business dinner? Maybe I should join you."

His expression darkened. "Unnecessary. It's a men's gathering. Do you really want to force your way in?"

Without another word, he stepped into the elevator, leaving her standing there. No matter how thick-skinned she was, all she could do was watch as the doors slid shut.

A flicker of frustration crossed Victoria's face, but she swallowed it down. For now, she had to play along.

Still, if Nathaniel agreed to let her brothers attend, that would be enough.

Hope flaring, she dialed Alexander's number. "Alexander, there's something I need to discuss with you."

At the Montgomery estate in Nord City, Alexander lounged on the sofa. "Go ahead," he replied lazily.

"In just a few days, Nathaniel and I will be engaged. It's a huge moment for me."

"I want my family there. Could you, Sebastian, and Julian come to the ceremony?"

Alexander frowned. He'd never been fond of Nathaniel.

His answer was noncommittal. "Depends on my schedule. If I'm free, I'll try."

"Alexander, please make time. It would mean everything to me. You know Grandma always said she'd attend my wedding if it ever happened."

"But Bern City is so far. I didn’t want to trouble her just for the engagement."

Alexander's frown deepened. "Don’t mention this to Grandma. She’d insist on coming, and with her health, the trip would be too much."

Disappointment flashed in Victoria's eyes, but her voice stayed composed. "Exactly my thoughts. That’s why I’m asking you three to come instead."

After a pause, Alexander relented slightly. "Julian’s already in Bern City, so he’ll be there. I’ll see what I can do."

"Thank you, Alexander." Victoria ended the call, her lips curling into a cold smirk.

It seemed Alexander only softened when it came to Eleanor.

She reminded herself to be patient. Once she became Mrs. Whitmore, she wouldn’t need to tread so carefully anymore.

Meanwhile, in a private dining booth, Evelyn and Jonathan finished their meal.

Jonathan, ever the gentleman, sighed. "Evelyn, I’m sorry about Cassandra. If I hadn’t brought her to the studio, none of this would’ve happened."

"It’s not your fault," Evelyn reassured him.

She knew Cassandra had the backing of Penelope and Victoria, but with Cassandra’s timid nature, she was hardly a threat.

Without power, one could only endure.

Stepping into the restroom, Evelyn studied her reflection, recalling the sight of Nathaniel and Victoria dining together. Surely, they’d finished by now.

Her hand drifted to her stomach, cradling the small bump. With her baby growing inside her, nothing else mattered.

As she exited, she nearly collided with Nathaniel. Her gaze flickered behind him—no sign of Victoria.

Was he alone?

Nathaniel’s eyes dropped to her hands, resting protectively over her abdomen.
###Chapter 175

Evelyn felt Nathaniel's piercing gaze on her.

She quickly pulled her hand away, as if burned.

Turning deliberately, she attempted to brush past him without a word.

But Nathaniel moved with effortless grace, blocking her path with an air of arrogance. "Don’t you have anything to say to me?" His voice dripped with condescension.

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting his eyes. "There’s nothing left to say."

A smirk curled his lips. "Already moved on, I see. Though I must say, your new choice is... underwhelming. Do you really find him appealing?"

The irony wasn’t lost on her.

She arched a brow. "Funny, coming from you."

After all, Nathaniel was the one openly pursuing Victoria.

His expression darkened. "Evelyn, I never expected you to become such a troublemaker. Three years of silence, and now this? Pathetic."

Her fingers curled into fists. "Speaking of trouble, Mr. Whitmore, perhaps you should focus on reigning in your family. Now that we’re divorced, make sure Penelope stays out of my life."

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. "What are you implying?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Exactly what I said. If it weren’t for Penelope’s meddling, Cassandra wouldn’t have dared cross Reginald."

She leaned in slightly, voice low. "She thought she had protection, but in the end, she was just a pawn. Used and discarded."

Nathaniel stiffened.

Evelyn straightened, her gaze unwavering. "I spent three years bending to your family’s whims. Not anymore. Don’t expect me to swallow my pride again."

With that, she sidestepped him and walked away.

Nathaniel stood frozen for a moment before pulling out his phone. "Robert," he snapped. "Look into Penelope’s recent communications with Cassandra Blake."

Within the hour, Robert delivered his findings. "Penelope has been in close contact with Cassandra since the Fleur International Design Competition."

He hesitated. "There’s more. When Cassandra was questioned, she repeatedly implicated Penelope. But since no one wanted to provoke the Whitmores, they directed their anger toward Evelyn instead."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. For three years, he’d assumed Evelyn’s life had been uneventful.

He hadn’t expected Penelope to overstep so boldly.

His expression hardened. "Go to the Whitmore estate. Bring Penelope to me. If she refuses, freeze all her accounts."

That evening, Evelyn returned home to an unexpected call.

"Evelyn," Alexander’s voice came through the line. "Olivia and I have some free time. We’re thinking of visiting Bern City."

She could hear the concern in his tone.

Evelyn sighed. "Alexander, I’m fine. You don’t need to drop everything for me."

But the warmth in her chest betrayed her words. Her brothers’ unwavering support meant everything.

Alexander cleared his throat. "It’s just a short trip. Work’s slow right now."

She relented. "Alright."

After hanging up, Alexander turned to Charles, his expression grim. "How did the investigation go?"

"Perfectly," Charles replied.

"Good. Make sure they apologize to Evelyn. Or they won’t see a cent."

Alexander’s eyes were steel. If this had happened closer to home, the consequences would have been far worse.
###Chapter 176

The moment Alexander Montgomery finished his paperwork, he turned to Olivia with a thoughtful expression. "Darling, what if we brought Evelyn back to Nord City to live with us? No one would dare disrespect her under our protection."

Olivia let out a soft sigh, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup. "But Evelyn has spent her entire life in Bern City. Uprooting her now would require an honest conversation. Are you sure she’s truly accepted us as family?"

Alexander’s jaw tightened with resolve. "Regardless, Victoria has already chosen to marry Nathaniel and will remain in Bern City. The distance between them is vast enough that bringing Evelyn home wouldn’t disrupt anything."

His voice dropped lower, firm. "Besides, Victoria is marrying into the Whitmore dynasty. It’s not as if we’re abandoning her."

Olivia arched a delicate brow. "Terminate Victoria’s adoption? Do you honestly think she’d agree to that?"

Evelyn’s rise from an orphanage to her current status was nothing short of extraordinary—something most could never comprehend. And truthfully, Olivia had never warmed to Victoria.

Alexander’s expression darkened. "I won’t let Evelyn suffer another injustice. When the time comes, I’ll ensure Victoria receives a fair settlement—assets, not empty promises."

His tone softened slightly. "It’ll be an amicable separation. I’ve upheld our agreement with her. There’s no betrayal here."

The next morning, Evelyn returned to work at the studio, slipping back into routine.

Before long, two colleagues approached, each holding a small pastry box.

"Evelyn, we owe you an apology," the first murmured, guilt flickering in her eyes. "Cassandra misled us."

The second extended her offering. "Please accept these as a peace offering."

Evelyn recognized the influence Cassandra Blake had wielded over them. With a gracious nod, she accepted the gifts. Holding grudges served no purpose—professionalism mattered more.

Then Natalie rushed in, breathless. "Evelyn, you have a visitor. It’s that woman who confronted Cassandra last time."

A tense silence settled over the studio.

Evelyn hadn’t expected Genevieve Stewart to seek her out. Had Cassandra spread more lies?

As Evelyn stood, Genevieve strode forward—but this time, her usual arrogance was absent. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, her posture weary.

Keeping her voice steady, Evelyn asked, "What brings you here?"

Without warning, Genevieve dropped to her knees with a thud.

"Ms. Carter," she said hoarsely, "I was a fool. Cassandra played me, and I believed her lies about you. My words were unforgivable. I’m begging for your forgiveness."

Evelyn recoiled, stunned. "What are you—?"

Gasps rippled through the room. Genevieve Stewart, heiress to a fortune, kneeling in apology? Unthinkable.

Jonathan Reeves emerged from his office, frowning. "What’s happening?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I have no idea."

She was just as baffled as everyone else. This had to be tied to something she didn’t know yet.

Then her phone buzzed. A message from Sophia:

"Reginald Stewart’s company just got acquired. His family’s facing bankruptcy. Karma’s finally biting back."

Evelyn’s breath caught. Reginald’s empire had fallen?

But why would that make Genevieve apologize to her?
###Chapter 177

Evelyn forwarded the link to Jonathan with a quiet murmur. "Jonathan, you should see this."

Across the room, Genevieve turned toward Evelyn, her voice trembling with desperation. "Ms. Carter, please—forgive me. I admit it was my fault."

Her hands clenched at her sides. "I shouldn’t have confronted you without verifying the facts first. This is entirely on me."

Evelyn studied her, skepticism flickering in her gaze. She wasn’t convinced Genevieve’s sudden remorse stemmed purely from regret—not when her family’s company had just been swallowed whole.

After a weighted pause, Evelyn arched a brow. "Why did you come to see me?"

Genevieve blinked, caught off guard, but quickly composed herself. "Ms. Carter, I truly recognize my mistake. Please, just give me this one chance."

"Get up first," Evelyn urged, her tone firm.

Genevieve shook her head, stubborn. "Not until you forgive me."

She stayed kneeling, defiance and fear warring in her posture.

Only when Evelyn finally muttered a reluctant pardon did Genevieve rise, her earlier arrogance replaced by something far more unsettling—genuine trepidation.

Once she was gone, the office settled back into uneasy silence.

Jonathan, standing nearby, finished reading the forwarded message. His gaze slid to Evelyn, a new layer of intrigue darkening his eyes. He hadn’t anticipated her maneuvering things so deftly behind the scenes.

Even with Keystone Construction collapsing, the Stewarts were old money—generations deep in wealth. Seeing Genevieve kneel to Evelyn? That was unexpected.

Lowering his voice, Jonathan beckoned, "Evelyn, my office. Now."

She followed, already knowing the unspoken question. "Jonathan, honestly? I’m just as lost as you are," she admitted before he could ask.

His lips thinned, but he relented. "Fine. If you won’t explain, I won’t push. But this situation… it’s working in your favor."

Evelyn didn’t bother correcting his assumption.

Back at her desk, she couldn’t resist digging into Keystone’s sudden downfall. One name stood out—Vista Properties.

A cold realization slithered down her spine.

Victoria’s family’s company.

Just yesterday, Victoria had sneered at her in that restaurant, boasting about her powerful brother’s backing. Now, coincidentally, that same brother had acquired Keystone?

What game was Victoria playing?

Scrolling further, Evelyn stumbled upon reports of environmental violations at Keystone’s golf course. Public outrage had sent stocks plummeting.

Then came the news: Reginald Stewart, overwhelmed, had suffered a stroke.

Now fighting for his life, his empire crumbled as his scattered heirs clawed for scraps.

Overnight, Keystone had imploded.

Evelyn wasn’t surprised. A man like Reginald, who’d ruined countless lives, deserved no less.

But the timing… it was too perfect.

Her phone buzzed—Penelope’s name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn answered warily. "Yes?"

"Evelyn, did you tattle to Nathaniel?" Penelope’s voice was venomous. "He canceled my cards and forbade my family from helping me. You heartless witch!"

Evelyn froze.

She had mentioned Penelope’s interference to Nathaniel—but only so he’d rein her in. All Evelyn wanted was peace.

She never expected him to cut Penelope off entirely.

Not when they were family.
###Chapter 178

The phone buzzed in Evelyn's hand as Victoria's shrill voice pierced through the receiver.

Evelyn kept her tone steady. "It's not like I froze your accounts. You should take that up with whoever did."

Without another word, she ended the call.

But Victoria was relentless. The phone lit up again and again, forcing Evelyn to mute it entirely.

The rumors that had been swirling around her lately had died down faster than she expected. She hadn't even needed to lift a finger.

A quiet relief settled over her.

Her fingers brushed gently over her abdomen, where the faintest flutter reminded her of the life growing inside.

After Eleanor's surgery at the end of the month, she could finally cut all ties with Nathaniel for good.

The thought brought a strange mix of sorrow and freedom.

She realized she should schedule a prenatal appointment.

Pulling out her phone, she booked the earliest slot available and gathered her things to leave work early.

"Evelyn, heading out already?"

Jonathan's voice made her turn.

"Yes, there's something I need to take care of. My workload is light today, so I thought I'd go now."

She hesitated, then added, "If anything urgent comes up, I can stay."

He shook his head. "No, it's fine. I was just worried about you. After the rumors, people are bound to talk, especially at the university."

A small smile touched her lips. "Thanks, but I'm not going to campus."

Jonathan chuckled. "Evelyn, you don't have to be so guarded around me. I'm not the enemy. We're friends, aren't we?"

She relaxed slightly, though the instinct to keep her distance remained. Her past with Nathaniel had left her wary of men, even well-meaning ones.

Luckily, Jonathan didn't press further.

Stepping into the elevator, Evelyn headed straight for the hospital.

She hadn't told Julian about the appointment.

His schedule was always packed, and she didn’t want to burden him. She could handle this alone.

The doctor’s words were a balm to her nerves. "Everything looks perfect. The baby is healthy."

Carefully, she tucked the ultrasound images into her bag. She had started keeping every scan, every report—tiny fragments of her child’s existence, even if the details were still blurred.

Glancing at the time, she realized it was still early.

Maybe she’d stop by Julian’s office.

The elevator doors slid open.

And then she froze.

Julian stood in the hallway, deep in conversation with a woman.

Victoria.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

What were they doing together? Did they know each other?

She ducked behind a corner before Victoria could spot her.

Every encounter with that woman brought trouble. The last thing she wanted was to drag Julian into it.

From her hiding spot, Evelyn watched as Victoria gestured animatedly, her expression tight with frustration.

Were they arguing?

Julian’s voice was clipped, impatient. "I already told you—I don’t have time for your engagement."

"But Alexander promised you’d make it! I can’t have my own engagement without a single family member there. Do you know how that would look?"

Julian’s tone turned sharp. "If family matters so much, why did you refuse his help in finding your real one?"

Victoria paled.
###Chapter 179

A shadow of remorse flickered in Victoria's gaze. She had no intention of reuniting with her birth family.

Being abandoned long ago meant they either didn’t want her or couldn’t care for her.

With the Sinclair family offering her privilege and status, why should she seek out those who had discarded her?

Was blood truly thicker than water?

Having endured the harsh realities of the orphanage, Victoria understood the value of wealth and power. She had no interest in reconnecting with people who had once thrown her away.

With a strained smile, she said, "Finding my biological family won’t change anything about my engagement."

"You’re my family now. That’s why I want you all there with me when Nathaniel and I make it official."

Julian studied her with sharp scrutiny. "Victoria, you’ve already gotten what you wanted. I agreed to perform Eleanor’s surgery. Don’t push your luck."

"But Julian, I’m part of this family too. Is it really so much to ask that you attend my wedding?"

"Alexander was the one who brought you home. Frankly, I never approved of his decision, so I’ve never considered you my sister."

"And let’s not forget, Victoria, the years you’ve spent masquerading as the Sinclair heiress—you know exactly what you’ve done."

"I know exactly who you are, so I suggest you tread carefully."

Because Julian saw through Victoria’s facade, he chose to keep her identity—and Evelyn’s—hidden. He wouldn’t risk Victoria doing something reckless if she felt cornered.

With his words, the last flicker of hope in Victoria’s heart extinguished. Pretending was no longer an option.

Even as a child, Julian had seen right through her. She’d always kept her distance, afraid he might expose her.

Wiping away a stray tear, Victoria replied coolly, "Julian, Alexander promised me you’d all be there."

"If you refuse, I’ll have no choice but to tell Eleanor."

"You wouldn’t dare." His voice was ice.

"Julian, I don’t want to upset Eleanor after all her kindness. I just want my family beside me on my engagement day. Is that so unreasonable?"

With that, she turned and walked away, her expression darkening. She hadn’t expected Julian to be so blunt.

But it didn’t matter. Once she married Nathaniel, she’d never have to endure this humiliation again.

As Victoria left, Evelyn stepped out from around the corner. "Julian?" she called hesitantly.

Startled, Julian turned. "Evelyn? What are you doing here? Are you feeling unwell?"

"I came for a prenatal checkup and thought I’d visit you. I didn’t mean to interrupt your conversation with Victoria."

His expression tensed. "You saw us?"

Evelyn nodded. "Julian, do you know Victoria well?"

To her, their exchange had seemed far from casual—almost as if they shared a complicated history.

Julian’s mind raced. "Victoria came to discuss Eleanor’s surgery. I’ll be leading the procedure."

"Oh, I see. With you in charge, I’m sure everything will go smoothly."

She knew the surgery was complex, requiring multiple specialists. She just hadn’t realized Julian was involved.

Relief washed over him when Evelyn accepted his explanation. He’d come dangerously close to slipping up.

For now, at least, the truth remained hidden.
###Chapter 180

Evelyn's voice was firm. "Julian, since you're involved in this surgery, I need you to update me immediately if there's any change in Eleanor's condition."

Her concern for Eleanor was genuine.

Watching Evelyn's intense expression, Julian sighed. "Evelyn, relax. Eleanor will pull through. I give you my word."

He would give this surgery his all—not just for Eleanor, but to ensure Evelyn could finally break free from the Whitmore family's shadow.

After Evelyn left, Julian called Alexander. "When exactly did I agree to attend Victoria's engagement?"

Alexander cleared his throat. "Didn't I say I couldn't make it?"

"Then that's your problem," Julian snapped. "I never agreed to this. You made the promise, not me."

He despised Victoria's manipulative tactics—using Eleanor as leverage.

Had Victoria been sincere, things might have been different. But her actions shattered the illusion of innocence she wore so well.

Julian had no patience for two-faced people.

A sigh came through the phone. "Fine. I'll fly to Bern City in a few days."

"Olivia and I want to see the situation for ourselves, especially after the accusations against Evelyn."

"About Victoria's engagement—here's my idea..." Alexander laid out his plan.

Julian considered it. "It could work. But I doubt Victoria will agree. Still, worth a try."

"Just keep Evelyn out of it. I don’t want her dragged into more trouble."

"Julian, Victoria wouldn’t go that far," Alexander insisted.

Julian fell silent.

Beneath his brother's cool exterior lay unwavering trust—even in Victoria, despite her being adopted into their family.

In the end, Julian didn’t argue. If Victoria married Nathaniel and stayed in Bern City, that was enough.

Once Evelyn returned to Nord City, no one would dare hurt her again.

And when her child was born, they’d be welcomed into the Montgomery family without hesitation.

Evelyn would have the freedom—and protection—she deserved.

Attending the engagement might be Julian’s final goodbye to Victoria.

The next morning, Evelyn woke to breaking news—Victoria’s engagement had taken over every entertainment headline.

Photos showed Victoria in a wedding dress—the same one Evelyn had seen during her visit.

The engagement date was now public. Evelyn wasn’t surprised.

She went to class, then headed to the studio.

Repeating a year meant she barely knew her classmates—and she wasn’t interested in changing that.

At the studio, Cassandra’s workspace stood empty, stripped of all personal belongings.

Evelyn felt a twinge of regret.

Cassandra had been a talented designer, once placing second in the prestigious Fleur International Design Competition.

But one wrong choice had ruined everything.

Evelyn’s thoughts drifted to her own marriage—eerily similar to Cassandra’s downfall.

Then her phone buzzed.

The caller’s name made her eyes narrow. She hadn’t spoken to Beverly in months.

This call could only mean trouble.
###Chapter 181

Evelyn glanced at her phone, her fingers hovering over the screen. She had a sinking feeling that answering would only bring bad news.

The ringing persisted, sharp and relentless.

With a sigh, she finally picked up. "Hello?"

"Evelyn, you ungrateful brat! Why are you ignoring my calls?" Beverly's shrill voice pierced through the line. "I have something urgent to discuss!"

Evelyn's tone was icy. "What is it?"

"Transfer me a hundred thousand dollars. Now."

Evelyn scoffed. "A hundred thousand? You might as well ask me to hand over the moon."

She knew Beverly only reached out when she wanted money. And this time, the demand was outrageous from the start.

"Don’t play dumb with me," Beverly snapped. "Your husband is filthy rich. You control the finances now. With your real family in the picture, you can’t possibly be short on cash."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her phone. "I don’t have that kind of money."

"You’ve been living comfortably while we struggle. If you don’t send it, I’ll make sure you regret it."

Evelyn’s frown deepened. "What do you even need it for?"

"Your brother Edward is getting married. His fiancée is pregnant. They need the money."

Evelyn’s voice turned colder. "I don’t have it. I’m using Aunt Margaret’s funds to pay for my tuition."

Beverly let out a mocking laugh. "Liar. Didn’t you win a million in that design competition? With Margaret’s money, you’re swimming in cash. Transfer it by tomorrow, or else."

The call ended abruptly.

Evelyn stared at her phone, then blocked Beverly’s number without hesitation. She wasn’t an ATM.

Her hand drifted to her stomach. She needed money too.

Growing up, Edward and his twin had tormented her. His wedding meant nothing to her.

That evening, when Evelyn returned home, she noticed Margaret’s troubled expression.

"Aunt Margaret, did Beverly call you?"

Margaret nodded. "She asked for money, didn’t she?"

Evelyn sighed. "A hundred thousand. Where am I supposed to get that? I’m still paying off my mortgage."

Margaret placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Don’t worry. A neighbor from our old place called. Beverly and Walter came looking for us, but I didn’t tell them where we live."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Good. I won’t give them a single cent."

She knew if Walter and Beverly caused trouble, her six brothers wouldn’t hesitate to step in.

For now, they’d stayed quiet—likely afraid of provoking them. In the countryside, a house full of men was an advantage in any fight.

Still, Evelyn remained on edge.

The next day, she went to class as usual.

Elizabeth approached her with a frown. "Evelyn, your adoptive parents contacted the college. They said they couldn’t reach you and need to talk."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. "I don’t want to see them. They’re demanding money for Edward’s wedding. How am I supposed to afford that?"

Elizabeth, aware of Evelyn’s past, didn’t push further.

Throughout her classes, Evelyn’s mind wandered.

What unsettled her most was that Walter and Beverly had found her college—and knew about her previous education.

They were getting closer.

###Chapter 182

This was disastrous news.

After classes ended, Evelyn Carter slipped out of the university discreetly, her face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat and medical mask. She couldn't risk being spotted by Walter and Beverly Simmons.

Those two were perfectly capable of causing a scene - like blocking the university gates with their dramatic antics.

Reaching the curb, Evelyn scanned her surroundings with practiced caution. No familiar figures lurking in the shadows. Good.

She exhaled in relief and raised her hand to hail a cab home.

"Evelyn! Stop right there!"

A cherry-red convertible screeched to a halt beside her. Penelope Whitmore stormed out, her designer heels clicking angrily against the pavement. "Did you really think you could hide forever?"

Evelyn kept her expression neutral. "I wasn't hiding."

"Then why the disguise in this heatwave?" Penelope snapped, blocking Evelyn's path. "You're the one who snitched to my family! Now I'm stuck with a pathetic fifty-thousand-dollar monthly allowance that barely covers my spa treatments!"

She grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "You're coming with me to explain everything to Nathaniel. That whole Cassandra Blake mess had nothing to do with me. She acted alone!"

The financial restrictions had clearly devastated Penelope's lavish lifestyle. No more spontaneous shopping sprees or champagne brunches with her socialite friends. The deprivation showed in her pinched expression.

Evelyn almost pitied her. Almost.

Shrugging off Penelope's grip, Evelyn said coolly, "Not my problem. Nathaniel froze your accounts, not me."

"And Cassandra confessed everything under pressure! You expect me to believe you're innocent?"

"It was her personal vendetta against you! I had nothing to do with it!" Penelope's voice climbed an octave.

Evelyn knew better than to expect honesty from Nathaniel's scheming cousin. This argument was going nowhere.

Then movement caught her eye - Walter and Beverly Simmons were crossing the street toward them. Damn Penelope for delaying her!

Evelyn ducked her head, but Beverly's shrill voice carried across the intersection: "There you are, you ungrateful brat! Trying to avoid us?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched toward her phone. Maybe she could call security-

Penelope seized her arm again. "Going somewhere? Aren't those your lovely adoptive parents? Why not say hello?"

"Let go, Penelope!"

"Not until you agree to clear my name with Nathaniel!"

Seeing the Simmons couple closing in, Evelyn made a split-second decision. She wrenched open Penelope's car door and jumped in.

Facing Nathaniel's interrogation suddenly seemed preferable to another confrontation with her adoptive parents.

Penelope peeled away from the curb, leaving Walter and Beverly shouting obscenities in their wake. Evelyn glanced back at their furious faces and allowed herself a small, satisfied smile.

"Consider that your rescue," Penelope said smugly. "Now you'll explain everything to Nathaniel."

"What exactly am I supposed to explain?"

"That I'm innocent! He needs to restore my credit limit immediately."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Do you really think Nathaniel acts without evidence? If he blocked your accounts, he already knows everything."

Penelope's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "So you refuse to help? Fine. Let's go back right now."

Evelyn bit back a scathing retort. This was going to be a long ride.
###Chapter 183

Just as Penelope was about to storm off, Evelyn quickly intervened. "Let's talk this through rationally. There's no need for dramatics."

Evelyn had worked too hard to break free from her adoptive family's toxic influence. She wouldn't let Walter and Beverly Simmons drag her back into their messy world.

No matter how much resentment they harbored, they held no power over her anymore. She was fiercely protective of her newfound peace.

Penelope smirked arrogantly as she accelerated the car.

Soon, the towering Whitmore Corporation headquarters came into view. Evelyn hadn't expected their destination to be here.

Parking smoothly, Penelope announced smugly, "This must be your first time here, Evelyn? Consider this your personal tour."

"When you were the Whitmore heiress, you never bothered visiting. But I'll generously show you around now. Don't thank me!"

Evelyn studied Penelope with detached amusement. "There's something I've been curious about."

Penelope tilted her chin up haughtily. "Ask away."

"How do you maintain that delusional sense of superiority?" Evelyn quipped.

Penelope's face flushed with anger. "What did you just say?"

"The way you talk, one would think you're the CEO," Evelyn retorted sarcastically.

Penelope stomped her foot in frustration, but remembering she needed Evelyn's cooperation for the meeting with Nathaniel, she swallowed her pride.

"Enough nonsense. Follow me."

Evelyn remained silent as they entered the elevator.

The executive floor exuded luxury befitting a corporate empire. Evelyn noted Nathaniel's usual impeccable taste.

Penelope marched straight to the secretary pool. "Where's Nathaniel?"

"Mr. Whitmore is in a meeting," a secretary replied politely. "You may wait in the guest lounge if you'd like."

"I'll wait in his office," Penelope insisted.

"I'm sorry, Ms. Whitmore, but unauthorized access to Mr. Whitmore's office is strictly prohibited."

Penelope turned away, visibly embarrassed.

Evelyn hadn't expected Nathaniel's security protocols to be this strict. Even family members received no special treatment.

"Told you," Evelyn murmured with a knowing smile.

Penelope bristled. "Stop looking so smug! Nathaniel has always been a stickler for rules. It's not like you were ever important enough to know that."

They proceeded to the conference room in tense silence.

To their surprise, Victoria Sinclair was already there.

The atmosphere grew palpably awkward as the three women exchanged glances.

Victoria's eyes narrowed suspiciously at seeing Evelyn with Penelope. "Penelope, why are you with her?"

Had Penelope switched alliances?

Evelyn was equally surprised by Victoria's presence. Apparently, neither woman held special privileges with Nathaniel.

Some things never changed - Nathaniel remained a workaholic through and through.

Penelope rushed to explain, "Victoria, don't misunderstand! I brought Evelyn to help with my credit card situation."

Victoria recalled how Nathaniel had frozen Penelope's cards after the Cassandra Blake incident. She hadn't expected Penelope to cave so quickly - what a weakling!

Putting on a sisterly smile, Victoria cooed, "Penelope darling, I've told you before - if you need money, just ask me."

"But Victoria, I can't keep relying on you," Penelope protested weakly.

"Nonsense! We're practically sisters now." Victoria produced her platinum card with visible reluctance. "Take this. Buy whatever you want."

Though it pained her, Victoria knew securing Penelope's loyalty required sacrifices.

Touched, Penelope accepted the card. "Thank you, Victoria. Or should I say... sister?"
###Chapter 184



Victoria wore a victorious smirk, though an undercurrent of unease twisted in her gut as she glanced at Evelyn.

Turning to Penelope, Victoria suggested, "Why don't we let her leave? When we meet Nathaniel later, I'll handle the credit card issue myself."

For reasons she couldn't explain, Victoria didn’t want Evelyn anywhere near Nathaniel—especially not now.

Penelope rolled her eyes and nodded. "Fine, Evelyn, you can go. We don’t need you here anymore."

Evelyn had no desire to stay. After all, Penelope had dragged her here against her will.

This outcome suited Evelyn perfectly. In fact, it might have just made things easier for her.

As Evelyn stepped out of the guest room, she nearly collided with a group exiting the adjacent conference hall.

At the forefront stood Nathaniel, impeccably dressed in a charcoal suit, his usual aura of icy detachment radiating around him. He was deep in conversation with Robert, his head slightly bowed.

Robert’s expression darkened the moment he spotted Evelyn. "Sir, Ms. Carter is here," he murmured.

Nathaniel’s gaze snapped toward Evelyn, his brows knitting together.

Why was Evelyn here?

A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes before he schooled his features. "Tell her to wait in my office," he ordered quietly.

He was certain she had a reason for coming.

Robert approached Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, Mr. Whitmore requests that you wait for him in his office."

Wait for Nathaniel?

Confusion flickered in Evelyn’s eyes. "Actually, I was just leaving. The person looking for Nathaniel is in the guest room."

Knowing Victoria was inside, Evelyn had no intention of lingering and risking humiliation.

Without another word, she turned toward the elevators.

Nathaniel’s lips pressed into a thin line as he watched her walk away. Was she playing games again?

Why come only to leave so abruptly?

Just then, the guest room door swung open.

Victoria stepped out, her expression sweet and cheerful as she approached Nathaniel. "Nate, are you finished with your meeting?"

Nathaniel ignored her, his gaze still fixed on Evelyn by the elevator.

Evelyn resisted the urge to look back as the doors slid shut.

At that moment, she was nothing more than a detached ex-wife.

As the elevator disappeared, Nathaniel’s expression tightened. He turned to Victoria and Penelope, his voice cool. "What are you two doing here?"

Victoria’s smile faltered. Before she could respond, Penelope blurted out, "Nathaniel, could you please reinstate my credit card?"

"The Cassandra incident had nothing to do with me. If you don’t believe me, ask Evelyn. She was just here—"

Penelope trailed off, realizing Evelyn had already left. She shot Victoria a pleading look.

Victoria cleared her throat awkwardly. "Nate, Evelyn just confirmed that Penelope wasn’t involved. She didn’t accuse her of anything."

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. "Did you bring Evelyn here?"

He still couldn’t fathom why she’d shown up unannounced.

Penelope nodded quickly. "On the way, I explained everything to her, and we reached an understanding. That’s why she agreed to come as a witness."

Nathaniel’s voice turned icy. "Did you apologize?"

Penelope hesitated, guilt flashing across her face. "Yes, of course. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have come with me."

"You’re lying."

Nathaniel saw through her instantly. "You’ll apologize to Evelyn properly. Only then will I consider reinstating your credit limit."

Penelope paled, turning desperately to Victoria.

Apologizing to Evelyn? That was far worse than admitting her own mistakes.
###Chapter 185

Under Evelyn's intense gaze, Victoria finally found her voice. "Nathaniel, this whole mess was just a small misunderstanding. Cassandra orchestrated everything, so please don't blame Penelope."

Nathaniel's expression remained icy. "I have matters to attend to. You may leave."

Flustered, Victoria pressed on. "Nathaniel, there's something important I need to discuss. For our engagement ceremony, Alexander and my brothers will be attending."

She had come specifically to inform him of this.

To her, their engagement held immense significance.

Now that Nathaniel was divorced from Evelyn, Victoria believed she was the perfect match for him.

No one could compete with her.

Nathaniel lowered his gaze, his tone cutting. "What does it matter? Our engagement was never real, and you know that better than anyone."

Victoria's breath hitched. "Nathaniel, please. Just help me save face in front of my brothers. Julian still believes our engagement is genuine."

"If he finds out next week that it's just a transaction—especially if you don’t show up—what if he changes his mind about Eleanor’s surgery?"

Nathaniel’s cold, distant eyes remained unreadable before he turned and walked away without another word.

Left standing alone, Victoria bit her lip, hesitation flickering in her eyes.

Beside her, Penelope wrung her hands anxiously. "Victoria, did you talk to Nathaniel about reinstating my credit card?"

Victoria’s eyes reddened. "Penelope, you saw how he treated me. There’s nothing more I can do."

Panic crept into Penelope’s voice. "Then what am I supposed to do? Apologize to Evelyn? That’s absolutely humiliating!"

She had always looked down on Evelyn, mocking her openly and behind her back.

The thought of groveling to her now made Penelope’s stomach churn.

Despite her own frustration, Victoria forced a composed smile. "For now, just use the card I gave you."

"Given time, Nathaniel will forget about this. Evelyn only told him to play the victim."

"If you confront her, you’ll be walking right into her trap."

Penelope’s resentment flared. "So she just gets away with it? I refuse to swallow my pride like this!"

She scoffed. "Cassandra is utterly useless. I even gave her two designer bags, and she still couldn’t handle something this simple."

Victoria’s lips curled in silent disdain. In her eyes, Penelope was just as incompetent, unable to deal with someone as insignificant as Evelyn.

Still, she needed Penelope’s loyalty—for now.

Once she married Nathaniel, she wouldn’t have to tolerate such foolishness anymore.

Suddenly, Penelope perked up. "Victoria, when I was looking for Evelyn earlier, I heard she’s been avoiding her adoptive parents. Apparently, they’re not easy to deal with."

"If they find her, she’ll be in serious trouble."

A sly glint flashed in Victoria’s eyes. "That’s an excellent idea. With Nathaniel and Eleanor protecting her, even I can’t touch her carelessly. This might be our only option."

She sneered. "I don’t understand what’s so special about Evelyn. Rumor has it she was adopted from an orphanage. How could someone like her ever be worthy of Nathaniel?"

At the mention of "orphanage," Victoria’s expression darkened momentarily. After all, she, too, had come from an orphanage—though she considered herself far luckier than Evelyn.

If not for her cunning back then, she might still be struggling at the bottom.

Shaking off the thought, Victoria lifted her chin.

She was the heiress of the Sinclair family now, destined for a life of luxury and power.

Nothing would stand in her way.
###Chapter 186

No matter how hard Evelyn tried, she could never outshine Victoria.

As Evelyn stepped out of Whitmore Enterprises, she paused to glance back at the towering glass structure before turning away decisively.

That evening, Margaret grasped Evelyn's hands excitedly. "Darling, I've got wonderful news! Our old neighborhood might be getting redeveloped!"

"Redevelopment? Are you certain?"

Evelyn had never imagined their modest neighborhood would qualify for urban renewal. Was fortune finally smiling upon them?

Just when she desperately needed funds, could this be her unexpected windfall?

Margaret's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Absolutely! I visited our old street today and spoke with neighbors. There's going to be a community meeting soon to discuss compensation options."

"I heard they're offering two choices - either replacement housing or monetary compensation."

Evelyn squeezed Margaret's hands. "This is incredible news. When the time comes, we'll carefully consider which option serves us best."

"I'm certain Walter and Beverly will hear about this eventually. We should inform your brothers before they cause trouble again."

"Let's see who dares to harass us when they're around. After all these years of suffering, it's our turn to stand strong."

Evelyn understood Margaret's unspoken wish - to finally have the upper hand against their tormentors.

With six formidable brothers by her side, who would dare cross them now?

After dinner, Evelyn sent a message to the family group chat explaining the redevelopment situation.

Olivia responded first: "Urban renewal is fantastic news! Evelyn, you've always been our lucky charm!"

Sebastian teased playfully: "Our little sister brings fortune wherever she goes. My property sales have skyrocketed lately - must be Evelyn's magic touch!"

Soon all her brothers joined the lively conversation, filling the chat with affectionate banter and exaggerated praise.

Evelyn shook her head at their antics, equal parts amused and exasperated.

"That's not the point," she typed. "The real concern is when Walter and Beverly find out, they'll definitely make trouble."

"I was wondering if any of you could come help handle the situation?"

Alexander replied instantly: "Count me in! I was planning to visit soon anyway."

Julian added: "Perfect timing - I haven't used my annual leave yet."

Christopher chimed in: "Conveniently, I'm already in Bern City for a concert but can arrive early."

Andrew wrote: "I can schedule a business trip there."

Daniel concluded: "Just wrapped filming - perfect timing for a vacation."

Reading their responses, warmth flooded Evelyn's heart. She gently touched her abdomen, imagining how many doting uncles her child would have.

The next morning, with no university classes, Evelyn headed straight to her design studio. Earning money remained her top priority.

She'd barely stepped inside when angry shouts erupted behind her. "Evelyn, you ungrateful wretch! Did you think you could hide from us forever?"

Turning to face Walter and Beverly, Evelyn's stomach dropped. "How did you find this place?"

This shouldn't be possible - they shouldn't know about her studio!

Beverly dramatically clutched Evelyn's legs, wailing. "Edward's life is ruined because of you! How can you live with yourself, avoiding us like this?"

###Chapter 187

Beverly's dramatic outburst made Evelyn lower her voice to a barely audible whisper. "We should take this conversation outside."

"Absolutely not!" Beverly declared loudly. "Let's settle this right here in front of all your fancy coworkers. I want them to know exactly why you're refusing to help your own family. Remember who took you in when you were starving in that orphanage? We gave you a home!"

Walter played his part perfectly, nodding along as he addressed the gathered colleagues. "We've spent our entire savings raising this girl. Now when we need help, she turns her back on us."

Evelyn's icy gaze locked onto her so-called parents. "You never paid a single cent for my education."

Beverly let out an exaggerated wail. "How can you say such things? Who else would have paid for your schooling? You won scholarships and now have this fancy job, but you won't share a penny with your own family!"

The commotion drew Jonathan from his office, his brow furrowed in concern. "What's happening here?"

Seizing the opportunity, Beverly launched into her performance. "You must be Evelyn's boss. Does she make good money? As her legal guardians, her salary should be going directly to us."

The sheer audacity almost made Evelyn laugh aloud. She'd never encountered such shameless behavior in her life.

Her adoptive parents always managed to redefine the boundaries of disgrace.

Jonathan studied them carefully. "You're claiming to be Evelyn's adoptive parents?"

"That's right," Walter confirmed. "We sacrificed everything to raise her, and this is how she repays us. We need that money to save a life. You should hand over her earnings immediately."

A cold laugh escaped Jonathan's lips. "Hand over her salary? On what legal grounds? You're making outrageous demands!"

Both Evelyn and Walter froze, unprepared for Jonathan's sharp rebuttal.

Jonathan continued mercilessly, "From what I understand, it was Margaret Dawson who raised Evelyn and funded her education. Her so-called adoptive parents relegated her to servant status the moment they had their own biological child."

He stepped closer to Evelyn's defense. "If not for Margaret's kindness, who knows where Evelyn might have ended up. How dare you show your faces here demanding money?"

Beverly and Walter exchanged uneasy glances, their carefully constructed facade cracking under Jonathan's scrutiny.

Dropping all pretense, Beverly revealed her true nature. "I don't care about any of that! We raised her, so she owes us. Either she pays up, or we'll take this to court. We've got nothing to lose."

Walter added his own threat: "If we don't get that money, we'll camp outside your precious studio every day. We'll pitch a tent right in your lobby. Let's see who lasts longer."

To emphasize their point, Beverly dramatically collapsed onto the floor. "Actually, this office isn't bad. Spacious, well-lit, air-conditioned... much better than our shack back home."

Even Jonathan seemed taken aback by their brazen behavior.

Evelyn, long accustomed to their antics, remained composed. She turned to Jonathan with an apologetic expression. "I'm sorry for causing another scene, Jonathan. I'll submit my resignation immediately."

If she left the studio, her adoptive parents would have no reason to cause trouble there.

Jonathan's frown deepened. "Evelyn, you need to reconsider this decision carefully."

Beverly immediately interjected, "Why would you quit such a good job, Evelyn? Our whole family depends on you! You can't resign - you need to work harder than ever!"
###Chapter 188

Evelyn Carter glared at Walter and Beverly Simmons with fire in her eyes. "Over my dead body! I'd rather be homeless than give you a single penny!"

"Mind your tone, girl!" Walter's face twisted with rage, his fists clenching. "You think I won't slap you right here?"

Jonathan Reeves moved like lightning, seizing Walter's collar. "Go ahead. Make my day."

The office erupted as male colleagues formed a protective circle around Evelyn, while female coworkers flanked her sides. The air crackled with tension.

"Let me educate you on basic law," a sharp-voiced colleague snapped at Beverly. "Child abuse is a felony. Evelyn could have you arrested for what you did to her."

"Disgusting parasites," another woman muttered. "Coming here to extort money from their own daughter."

Outnumbered, the Simmons couple retreated several steps.

Beverly planted her hands on her hips, her voice shrill. "This isn't over, Evelyn Carter! We'll be back!"

As the door slammed behind them, Evelyn turned to her colleagues with watery eyes. "I... I don't know how to thank you all. Coffee's on me today."

Jonathan flashed his trademark charming smile. "Don't mention it. Those vultures were clearly trouble. But how will you handle this? They won't stop harassing you."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "That's why I'm resigning."

"Absolutely not." Jonathan's voice turned serious. "If it's money you need—"

"It's not about money." Evelyn shook her head firmly. "If I give in now, they'll bleed me dry forever."

She knew her adoptive parents' nature all too well - like sharks scenting blood in water.

Jonathan snapped his fingers. "Then fake your resignation! Come back when they stop lurking around."

"Jonathan..." Guilt twisted Evelyn's stomach. He'd gone above and beyond for her too many times already.

The office drama had left her emotionally drained, shame burning in her chest.

"Hey, that's what friends are for." Jonathan winked, sparking giggles from nearby coworkers. "Anytime you need help, just call."

Evelyn managed a small smile before heading out for coffee orders.



Her phone buzzed with an unknown number. "Hello?"

"Evelyn, did your lovely parents pay you a visit?" The smug female voice dripped with malice.

Evelyn's grip tightened on the phone. "Penelope Whitmore. You told them where I worked."

How else would they have found her? This had Nathaniel's scheming cousin written all over it.

"Listen carefully," Penelope hissed. "If you want peace, tell Nathaniel to unfreeze my accounts."

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "A sincere apology might've worked, Penelope. I could've spoken to Nathaniel on your behalf."

"APOLOGY?" Penelope's shriek nearly shattered Evelyn's eardrum. "You delusional little—"

"My thoughts exactly." Evelyn ended the call and blocked the number with practiced ease.

She spent the day buried in textbooks at the university library, grateful for the temporary peace.

Jonathan called later. "They came sniffing around again. I told them you quit and owed the company damages." His chuckle was rich with satisfaction. "You should've seen them scramble away like roaches."

Evelyn's laughter bubbled up unexpectedly. Leave it to Jonathan to outsmart them.

As twilight painted the sky, her phone buzzed again. Evelyn frowned at the unfamiliar caller ID. Why would this person be contacting her now?
###Chapter 189

Evelyn Carter stared at her phone screen, blinking in disbelief at the caller ID—Nathaniel Whitmore.

Her fingers hovered over the answer button as she muttered, "Why is he calling me? Did he misdial?"

The relentless ringing forced her to pick up. "What do you want, Mr. Whitmore?" she snapped.

His voice was ice. "Your adoptive parents showed up at the villa, demanding money from me."

Humiliation burned through her veins. "Kick them out. Don’t give them a cent."

"I don’t have time for this. Handle it yourself," he said coldly before the line went dead.

After gathering her things, Evelyn hailed a cab to the villa.

Standing before the grand gates, memories rushed back. She hadn’t stepped foot here since she left.

Her finger hesitated over the doorbell before pressing it.

Even before the door opened, raised voices spilled into the foyer.

Her adoptive parents weren’t alone—Beatrice Harrington’s shrill tone cut through the chaos.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Why is she here?

She nearly turned to leave when Abigail Wilkins swung the door open with a tight smile. "Mrs. Whitmore! You’re back! Come in."

Suppressing her unease, Evelyn stepped inside and whispered, "What’s she doing here?"

Abigail sighed. "No idea. But this just got complicated."

Evelyn knew if the door hadn’t opened so fast, she would’ve fled.

The moment she entered the living room, all eyes locked onto her.

Beverly Simmons smirked. "Evelyn, so nice of you to finally show up."

She jabbed a finger toward Beatrice. "Tell your mother-in-law who’s in charge here! Your husband claims you make the decisions, but she seems to disagree."

Beatrice trembled with rage. "Answer me, Evelyn Carter! Who controls my son’s money? Who do you think you are?"

She had come to redecorate for Nathaniel’s second marriage—never expecting Beverly and Walter’s sudden appearance.

Evelyn exhaled sharply before meeting Beatrice’s glare. "There’s something you should know. Nathaniel and I are divorced."

Beverly’s face darkened. "What?"

"Evelyn Carter, how could you keep this from us?" Walter demanded. "Why divorce a man like him? Have you lost your mind?"

Beatrice sneered. "Let me remind you—someone like Evelyn was never fit for my son. Especially with those disgraceful parents. I’m relieved they divorced. It would’ve ruined our reputation."

Evelyn, already familiar with Beatrice’s cruelty, turned away, pretending not to hear.

She glanced at her adoptive parents. "Did you hear that? I was thrown out because I didn’t belong. I haven’t lived here in months. Stop coming here—you’re disturbing people."

Beverly scoffed. "Even if you’re divorced, he must’ve given you money. Hand it over!"

Walter nodded. "That’s how it works in dramas. You got assets. Give us the cash, and we’ll leave."

Evelyn’s lips thinned. "Sorry to disappoint, but I left with nothing. I only married him because I was shameless back then. We had a prenup—I get zero after divorce. So give up."
###Chapter 190

Evelyn's sharp words left Beverly and Walter speechless.

Across the room, Beatrice's pride took a direct hit. "It's 100 thousand dors, isn't it? I can write the check, but on one condition—you stay away from my son. He's engaged to a woman from the Sinclair family now. A perfect match."

With a flick of her wrist, she scribbled the amount and tossed the check onto the floor.

Beverly scrambled to pick it up, greed flashing in her eyes. "How generous of you. And you're absolutely right about Evelyn—just an orphan with no connections. Ungrateful, too. Good riddance she's divorced."

Beatrice smirked, disdain dripping from her gaze. "Take the money and get out of my sight."

Afraid it might disappear, Beverly shoved the check into her purse.

Without another word, she turned and left, not even sparing Evelyn a backward glance.

Evelyn inhaled deeply. "I'll pay you back."

Supporting her adoptive parents had never been her responsibility. And Beatrice covering the cost? That wasn't part of the plan either.

Beatrice scoffed. "Don't bother. That amount is pocket change to me. Frankly, it's worth it to be rid of the headache."

She crossed her arms. "You could never repay me anyway. Do I need to remind you of your salary? Just keep your family in check. Stay out of our lives. We move in different worlds now."

Evelyn pulled out her phone and transferred the money to Nathaniel. Then she met Beatrice's gaze. "It's done. You won't hear from me again."

"Why do you still have my son's contact?" Beatrice demanded. "What are you scheming? The divorce is final. There's no reason for you to stay connected."

Under her ex-mother-in-law's scrutiny, Evelyn deleted Nathaniel's number. "Satisfied?"

"Much better." Beatrice's lips curled. "The Sinclairs will be at the engagement party this weekend. That's the kind of family my son deserves."

She tilted her head. "Know your place. Don't aim for men out of your league. Someone like that famous actor, for instance—keep dreaming."

A mocking smile played on Evelyn's lips. "If I could marry Nathaniel, who's to say I can't land someone even better?"

The air turned thick with tension.

"Mr. Whitmore, you're back," Abigail announced loudly.

Evelyn's spine stiffened. She glanced over her shoulder—Nathaniel stood there, his dark eyes unreadable.

Her fingers curled into fists. Showing weakness now was the last thing she wanted.

Beatrice brightened. "Nathaniel, darling. You heard Evelyn, didn't you? Marrying someone better? The audacity. It's almost laughable."

Nathaniel strode into the room, his expression blank. But the way he loosened his tie betrayed his irritation.

Beatrice pressed on. "Evelyn's adoptive parents made a scene. They claimed she ran this household—handled the finances! Can you imagine? The lies she fed them!"

Nathaniel's response was flat. "I did say that."

Evelyn froze. Shock rendered her speechless.

She refused to believe those words had come from him.
###Chapter 191

Evelyn couldn't suppress a quiet laugh at Beatrice's stunned expression.

Honestly, Nathaniel had only used that excuse to dismiss Evelyn's adoptive parents, who had shown up unannounced—begging for money.

She hadn't expected him to turn it into a sharp retort against Beatrice, delivered with zero deference.

His gaze flicked to Evelyn the next second, making her breath catch.

It was strange, really. She hadn't even been the one to speak.

Nathaniel's voice was icy. "Why did you transfer a hundred thousand dollars to me?"

Evelyn blinked. "I was repaying your mother. Since I didn’t have her account details, I sent it to you. Could you forward it to her?"

He glanced at Beatrice. "What happened?"

"Nathaniel, Evelyn’s adoptive parents came demanding money. I gave them the hundred thousand just to get rid of them. It’s not a significant amount," Beatrice replied dismissively.

His brows drew together. "You shouldn’t have."

He knew exactly what kind of people Evelyn’s adoptive family were—opportunistic leeches. Give them an inch, and they’d take a mile.

"Nathaniel, I know you think it’s a waste, but consider it a small price to pay for peace," Beatrice reasoned.

His lips thinned. He didn’t say it was a waste. He said it was a mistake. Feeding their greed would only invite more trouble.

Evelyn scoffed. "If that’s all, I’ll be leaving. If they show up again, don’t let them in."

She turned on her heel and walked out without another word.

Outside, the night was thick and still. The upscale neighborhood had no public transport, and taxis were nonexistent.

A sleek black car rolled up beside her moments later. The driver lowered the window. "Mrs. Whitmore, let me take you home."

"No need," she said stiffly.

The driver persisted. "You won’t find a cab here, ma’am. Besides, I need to drop something off for Mr. Whitmore anyway."

Evelyn hesitated, then relented. Pride was one thing, but safety was another.

The silence in the car was heavy. She glanced at the driver. "Thank you."

"Of course."

From the rearview mirror, he watched her exhale in quiet resignation. Relief settled in his chest.

If he’d failed to bring her back, he wouldn’t have known how to face his boss.

At a red light, he quickly typed out a message to Robert. Mrs. Whitmore is in the car.

Robert read the text and hurried upstairs—only to walk into a heated argument between Nathaniel and Beatrice.

Beatrice was fuming. "Nathaniel, you’re divorced. Why won’t you clear out the walk-in closet? What if Victoria moves in and sees all of Evelyn’s things still here?"

Nathaniel’s patience was fraying. "Mother, this engagement is a business arrangement. Nothing more."

"That’s ridiculous. Victoria is perfect—beautiful, well-connected, obedient. She’d make an ideal wife. Forget the pretense. Make it real."

He pinched the bridge of his nose. "I’m thirty, not three. Stop barging into my room and dictating my life."

Beatrice’s temper flared. "You’re my son! I have every right to check on you!"

"You’ve checked. Now leave." He ushered her out and shut the door firmly behind her.

She huffed, powerless against his stubbornness. "The engagement party is this weekend. Don’t embarrass us. The Sinclairs aren’t people you want to cross."
###Chapter 192



Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Mother, I have an important meeting soon. You should return home first."

"Of course. Just remember not to push yourself too hard at work." Beatrice simply advised, knowing better than to interfere with his professional matters.

No matter how many unspoken words burned in her throat, she forced them down.

After she departed, he descended to the living room.

Robert promptly updated him, "Mr. Whitmore, the chauffeur has safely delivered Mrs. Whitmore home."

Nathaniel acknowledged with a hum, sinking into the couch. A faint crease of worry appeared between his brows.

He dismissed Robert with a wave. "You're free to leave for the evening."

Finally released from duty, Robert exited the residence.

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on Evelyn's message and the returned transaction. His lips pressed into a thin line.

With quick fingers, he typed, 'I'll transfer the amount back to you.'

The moment he hit send, he noticed Evelyn's profile picture had disappeared from his contacts - a clear sign she'd blocked him.

The air around him turned icy. For hours, he stared at his darkened phone screen before finally dialing her number.

Had Evelyn truly cut him off? The thought was inconceivable.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat in the backseat of the car when his call came through.

She hadn't planned to answer, but courtesy demanded it since she was using his family's driver.

The moment the call connected, Nathaniel's voice came through gritted teeth. "Evelyn Carter, how dare you block my number!"

Her jaw tightened. "I was simply following your mother's instructions."

"Since when do you take orders from her?" His voice vibrated with barely contained fury.

His sharp retort left her momentarily speechless, creating an uncomfortable silence.

Evelyn's eyes dropped to her lap. "Truthfully, there's no reason for us to maintain contact now that our marriage is ending. A clean break would be best," she stated firmly.

"Who says it has to be your way? What am I supposed to tell Grandmother?" Nathaniel countered.

"She won't be checking your phone for deleted contacts. Besides, exes typically become strangers after divorce, don't they?" Evelyn pointed out.

The driver, overhearing the heated exchange, gripped the wheel tighter, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Fine." A sharp exhale preceded the abrupt end of the call.



Evelyn turned her gaze to the passing scenery, one hand absently stroking her barely noticeable baby bump.

"You're right. We'll be nothing to each other after this."

She contemplated her social media accounts, wondering if she should create new ones.

Future baby photos would certainly complicate matters otherwise.

Upon arriving home, Evelyn found Margaret waiting anxiously.

"Evelyn, your adoptive family discovered the demolition notice. They showed up at the old neighborhood this afternoon. What should we do?"

"Don't worry, Aunt Margaret. My brothers told me they're coming back. We'll handle them together. Remember, you legally own that house. Without your signature, they can't proceed with anything."

Margaret nodded, visibly relieved. "That's good. Once you secure another property, you'll have better marriage prospects. Two homes make you quite the catch."

"I'm not looking for another relationship right now," Evelyn replied.

"But you must! You need someone to protect you," Margaret insisted, her voice laced with maternal concern.

Evelyn understood Margaret's traditional worries, but times had changed.

If she could support herself, marriage wasn't a necessity.

After reassuring Margaret, Evelyn received a call from Alexander. "Evelyn, we're flying back to Nord City tomorrow."

The news of her brothers' return lifted her spirits. "Wonderful! What's your arrival time? I'll meet you at the airport."

The following day, Evelyn arrived early at the terminal to welcome Alexander and Olivia.

As she stepped from the taxi, a flash of familiar crimson caught her eye - a Maserati parked nearby. It wasn't until Penelope and Victoria emerged that recognition dawned.
###Chapter 193

The airport's fluorescent lights glared down as Evelyn Carter adjusted her sunglasses. She hadn't anticipated running into Victoria Sinclair and Penelope Whitmore here. Their empty hands suggested they weren't travelers.

"Stalking us now?" Penelope's shrill voice cut through the terminal noise. Her designer purse swung aggressively as she stepped closer.

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. "The universe must be punishing me today."

The three women moved toward the arrivals area, their heels clicking in unison on the polished floors.

Victoria's gaze flickered with curiosity. "Meeting someone?"

Penelope snorted before Evelyn could answer. "Probably some broke college friend. First-class tickets are way beyond her budget."

Evelyn's fingers twitched. "Your elitism is showing, Penelope. Did your diploma come with extra entitlement?"

"You dropped out!" Penelope's face flushed crimson. "At least I graduated from an Ivy League school!"

"Ah yes," Evelyn tilted her head, "that online certificate must look lovely framed in your bathroom."

The buzzing socialite was like a persistent wasp - one Evelyn longed to swat away permanently.

Victoria observed the exchange with detached amusement. A thought whispered through her mind: Penelope's wealth couldn't mask her staggering ignorance.

"I'm meeting my brother," Victoria offered, attempting civility.

"Same," Evelyn replied smoothly.

Victoria's perfectly shaped eyebrows arched. Since when did Evelyn have family beyond those wretched adoptive relatives?

Penelope's laugh grated like nails on chalkboard. "Brother? More like some random guy she's sleeping with!"

Evelyn didn't dignify that with a response. She simply walked twenty paces away - the minimum safe distance from toxic personalities.

Her phone vibrated. Alexander Montgomery's voice came through warm and familiar. "Just landed, little sister. You shouldn't have come all this way."

"Nonsense," Evelyn smiled into the receiver. "Aunt Margaret's making her famous pot roast. The house smells incredible already."

"Give us fifteen minutes," Alexander said before hanging up.

He turned to his wife Olivia. "Let's take the main exit. If Evelyn sees us using VIP services, she'll start asking questions."

Olivia adjusted her diamond earrings. "A little walk never hurt anyone." Her designer suitcase rolled silently across the marble as they joined the pedestrian flow.

Evelyn checked the arrivals board again. The plane had definitely landed. She leaned against a pillar, watching Victoria and Penelope preen near the baggage claim like exotic birds in a concrete jungle.

The security light above her flickered once. Somewhere in the distance, a child cried. Evelyn exhaled slowly, counting the seconds until her real family would appear.
###Chapter 194



The couple walked hand in hand through the crowded airport when Evelyn’s phone buzzed with an incoming call.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened as he answered. “Yes?”

“Nathaniel, I saw your flight landed safely. I’m outside waiting for you. Let’s have dinner together. I’ve already booked a table at La Belle Étoile,” Victoria chirped, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

His jaw tightened. How had she gotten his flight details? His schedule was supposed to be private.

“There’s a car waiting for us. We won’t be going through the usual exit,” he replied coolly.

“Then I’ll meet you in the parking lot.”

“No. I have plans. Go home.”

With Evelyn standing right beside him, Nathaniel couldn’t risk running into Victoria.

“I’m already here, Nathaniel. Don’t be so cold. I’ll head to the parking lot now,” Victoria said, hanging up before he could protest.

It hadn’t been easy to track down their flight details. Victoria rarely had access to insider information about the couple. This was her golden opportunity to worm her way back into their good graces.

The fact that Nathaniel had agreed to attend her engagement party was monumental.

Once she became Mrs. Whitmore, with Nathaniel’s influence behind her, her status in Bern City would skyrocket.

No one would dare challenge her position then. She would command the respect she deserved.

Victoria spotted Evelyn nearby and sauntered over with a smug smile. “My brother and his wife are heading to the parking lot in a VIP shuttle. Is your brother here yet?” she asked, her tone dripping with condescension.

Evelyn arched a brow. “Victoria Sinclair, is there a limit to your daily theatrics?”

“I was just making conversation. No need to be so defensive,” Victoria replied, feigning innocence.

Penelope, standing beside her, smirked. “Let’s go. Evelyn’s just jealous of the privileges people like us enjoy.”

Evelyn rolled her eyes. “Privilege? Please.”

Time was running out. If Nathaniel reached the parking lot before Victoria, he’d leave without her.

Sensing the urgency, Victoria hurried off.

Ten minutes later, Evelyn spotted Nathaniel and Olivia approaching. She waved excitedly. “Nathaniel! Olivia! Over here!”

Nathaniel strode over, ruffling her hair affectionately. “Sorry for the wait. Your legs must be tired.”



“I’m fine. It wasn’t that long.”

Olivia discreetly scanned the area, relieved when Victoria was nowhere in sight.

“Let’s go. I’m exhausted,” Olivia said, faking a yawn.

Nathaniel, understanding her unspoken concern, quickly guided Evelyn toward the exit to avoid any unwanted encounters.

The trio slipped into a waiting cab, but Nathaniel’s phone wouldn’t stop vibrating.

He glanced at the screen—Victoria, calling repeatedly.

He silenced it without hesitation.

Evelyn peeked over his shoulder. “Aren’t you going to answer? What if it’s important?”

“It’s nothing urgent. I’m on leave. The company won’t collapse without me,” he said smoothly, crafting a believable excuse.

Olivia shot him a knowing look.

They had underestimated Victoria’s cunning. How had she gotten their flight details?

Unaware of the tension, Evelyn pulled out her phone and typed in the group chat.

Heading home now. Feast tonight. Don’t be late, Julian.

Julian replied with a thumbs-up emoji.

He set his phone down, already contemplating skipping work for the gathering. But his peace was short-lived as his phone buzzed incessantly.

Victoria again.
###Chapter 195

Julian glanced at his phone screen before answering the call. "Yes?"

"Julian, did you know Alexander and Olivia returned today?" Victoria's voice carried an edge of suspicion.



"Really? I wasn't aware." He sensed Victoria's probing but kept his tone deliberately neutral.

Evelyn had secretly informed the family that Nathaniel had picked up the couple from the airport without anyone's knowledge, narrowly avoiding Victoria's surveillance.

Julian had no intention of revealing this to Victoria.

Meanwhile, Victoria kept checking her watch in the parking lot. The minutes stretched with no sign of Alexander and Olivia.

Something felt wrong. Still holding the phone, her voice sharpened. "You seriously didn't know?"

"I've been buried in work. How would I?"

"Alexander and Olivia are actually here! I was running late to the airport and missed them. Call them and arrange dinner. They're attending my engagement party - I should properly thank them."

Julian fabricated an excuse smoothly. "I'm in a meeting now. I'll check with them later."

Victoria's grip tightened on her phone. Getting Alexander's location was clearly impossible now.

Yet she pressed harder, sensing his evasion. "Julian, why did Alexander acquire that small factory? It's bizarre for him to invest in some irrelevant company."

Especially when that company's owner had spread vicious rumors about Evelyn.

Without Alexander's sudden acquisition leading to their bankruptcy, Evelyn wouldn't have emerged unscathed.

The memory made Victoria's jaw tighten. She needed answers, but Alexander remained frustratingly tight-lipped.

Naturally, Julian knew the truth but would never betray Evelyn's confidence. "No idea. Alexander's business decisions aren't my concern."

Victoria's expression darkened when the call ended, but she quickly smoothed her features.

Turning to Penelope, she fabricated smoothly. "My brother got called into an urgent meeting."



"I see. Business first. Your brother must be very important," Penelope remarked.

Victoria forced a smile. "Yes, he came to Bern City for my engagement, but work always pulls him away. He probably carved out time just for the ceremony."

Yet unease coiled in her stomach.

She couldn't show weakness to Penelope. Being the neglected Ms. Sinclair was her shameful secret, one she'd guard fiercely.

No one in Bern City could know.

That's exactly why she was determined to marry Nathaniel and establish herself here.

Penelope looked envious. "Your brother may be busy, but he's generous. Mine froze all my accounts, and my family supported his decision."

The financial restriction clearly rankled Penelope.

Victoria's smile faltered momentarily at the mention of allowances.

In truth, every penny was her own hard-earned money and savings.
###Chapter 196

Victoria Sinclair wasn't a reckless spender like Penelope Whitmore.

Had Victoria been the true heiress of the Sinclair fortune, she wouldn't have suffered so much.

Her life could have been as effortless as Penelope's.

Evelyn Carter, Alexander Montgomery, and Olivia Montgomery arrived home to find Margaret Dawson bustling in the kitchen.

Olivia inhaled deeply. "Something smells incredible. I wonder what Aunt Margaret is cooking."

"She's preparing regional specialties. Remember how you mentioned loving them? She handpicked the freshest ingredients at dawn just to get them right," Evelyn said with a smile.

"Fantastic! I'll go help her." Olivia set down the gifts and hurried toward the mouthwatering aromas.

Meanwhile, Alexander settled onto the living room sofa.

Evelyn handed him a bowl of fruit. "You must be tired from the long flight. Have some—you need the vitamins."

Alexander usually avoided fruit due to its sweetness, preferring supplements instead.

Yet he took small bites of what Evelyn offered.

Between mouthfuls, he reassured her, "Evelyn, don’t worry about the gossip. Nathaniel will hold those people accountable. Cassandra Blake has already received a lawsuit notice."

"That company is nearly bankrupt, and a buyer is circling. That family will lose everything soon, buried in debt. No one involved will escape consequences."

Evelyn stared at him, bowl in hand. "Alexander."

"If something’s on your mind, just say it," he replied, meeting her gaze.

He’d postponed critical business to handle this personally.

As her eldest brother, shielding her from slander was his duty.

Evelyn took a deliberate bite. "Alexander, how do you know they’ll lose everything? That sounds like insider knowledge."

She understood Nathaniel’s legal pursuit—but the bankruptcy details?

It almost sounded like Alexander was orchestrating the takeover.

His lashes flickered—he’d said too much.

Regaining composure, he shrugged. "Vista Properties is acquiring them. I work there. Hence, the intel."

"What a coincidence," Evelyn murmured, though suspicion prickled.

In her understanding, Victoria’s brother ran that company.

Penelope and Victoria were likely the schemers.

Logically, Victoria would never let her brother sell—it’d be suicide.

Sensing tension, Alexander shifted topics. "Evelyn, where’s Julian? Working late?"

"No. I told him you were coming. He promised to be home early."

The doorbell rang.

"That must be him. Forgot his keys again." She opened the door—and froze.

An unexpected visitor stood there.
###Chapter 197



The second Evelyn recognized the figures at her doorstep, every muscle in her body screamed to slam the door shut.

She hadn’t bothered checking the peephole, assuming it was Julian returning after forgetting his keys—a mistake she now deeply regretted.

"Evelyn Carter, how dare you try to shut us out?" Beverly Simmons barged in without hesitation, her presence an unwelcome intrusion. "We’ve been hunting you down for months. How can you afford this luxury apartment when you’re supposed to be penniless?"

Her voice dripped with accusation. "Liar."

Walter Simmons crossed his arms, his tone sharp. "Let’s make one thing clear, Evelyn. Don’t even think about laying a finger on that demolition payout or the house. Everything belongs to my son. He’s the only rightful heir of this family."

Evelyn’s gaze turned glacial. "That house is Aunt Margaret’s. You have no claim over it."

Beverly scoffed. "She only has a daughter. What use does she have for property and money? My brother is still hospitalized. If you take everything and run off with another man, what happens to him? As his brother, it’s my duty to protect his assets. Otherwise, he’ll wake up to nothing."

"How noble of you," Evelyn replied dryly, seeing right through their scheme.

Their greed for the demolition compensation was painfully transparent.

Just then, Alexander stepped out of the bathroom.

His eyes locked onto her adoptive parents, a dangerous glint in his gaze. "Well, well. Back for more? Was the last lesson not enough? Would you like an encore—this time with guaranteed broken bones?"

Walter paled, instinctively cradling his arm—the one that still ached whenever it rained.

Beverly stumbled back but refused to retreat entirely.

Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Margaret tensed at the commotion. She moved to intervene, but Olivia stopped her with a gentle hand. "Aunt Margaret, let the younger ones handle this. Stay out of sight. Just focus on dinner. We’ll eat when Julian gets back."

Margaret hesitated. "But—shouldn’t I do something?"

Olivia shook her head. "Trust me, it’s better this way. If you step in, it’ll only complicate things. Alexander has it under control."

She wasn’t worried. Not with Alexander there.

Besides, this was his chance to play the protective older brother—something he’d been obsessing over lately.

If she had to hear him mutter about "being a better brother" one more time, she’d lose her mind.

Alexander’s voice cut through the tension. "Get out. If I see you here again, I’ll make sure you never walk properly again."

Beverly shot Evelyn a venomous glare. "This isn’t over, Evelyn Carter! That house is ours, and we will get it!"

Walter opened his mouth to threaten her, but one look from Alexander stole his voice.

They fled without another word.



The taste of defeat was bitter.

They had come to make a scene, to intimidate Evelyn into submission—but they hadn’t expected Alexander to be there.

Instead of causing chaos, they had scurried away like frightened mice.

Alexander’s presence alone was enough to send them running.

He had assumed they’d learned their lesson after the last encounter.

Clearly, he’d overestimated their intelligence.
###Chapter 198

No matter what, Beverly and Walter were Evelyn's adoptive parents. Even though they treated her horribly, Margaret, their sister-in-law, had taken Evelyn in, offering a ray of hope.

Nathaniel was still grateful that the Simmonses had raised Evelyn.

But their greed was beyond anything he had anticipated.

To think they would show up at Evelyn's doorstep to threaten her? Unacceptable.

Evelyn shut the door and sank onto the couch. "I knew this would happen the moment the demolition was announced. They'd definitely come for that house."

Even blood relatives would fight over money, let alone adoptive parents.

Nathaniel's voice was firm. "Don't worry, Evelyn. I'll handle this."

It would take him nothing more than a single call to deal with people like them.

Margaret emerged from the kitchen, her face lined with worry. "Evelyn, they won't stop here. They'll keep coming back. How did they even find this place? I swear I didn’t tell anyone."

"I have a hunch about how they found us. It doesn’t matter now. Just don’t give in, no matter what."

Evelyn was certain Penelope had given them the address.

Penelope was also the reason they had tracked her down at the studio.

Nathaniel reassured the distraught Margaret. "Aunt Margaret, don’t worry. Leave it to me."

"You don’t understand how shameless they are, Nathaniel. I can handle it, but I don’t want Evelyn hurt. She’s still so young. She has her whole life ahead of her." Tears spilled down Margaret’s cheeks.

Normally composed, Margaret only broke down when pushed to her limits.

Olivia guided Margaret to the bedroom to comfort her, then shot Nathaniel a meaningful glance.

He knew exactly what needed to be done. Pulling out his phone, he sent a quick message to his assistant: Look into the demolition case.

The first step was identifying the company behind the demolition. Nathaniel already had a plan forming.

The old Nathaniel might have resorted to extreme measures—like having Beverly and Walter disappear permanently. But now, reformed, he would teach them a lesson the right way.

He met Evelyn’s gaze, his voice steady. "Don’t worry. We’ll stand by you until this is over."

"But it’ll take so much time."

"We’ll take turns keeping you company." Just then, Julian walked in.

Olivia had already updated the group chat about Beverly and Walter’s unexpected visit—and their demands.
###Chapter 199

Evelyn carefully arranged the silverware on the dining table before gently persuading Margaret to join them for dinner.

Tears welled up in Margaret's eyes as she confessed, "Look at me. I completely panicked when trouble came knocking. My late husband was such a strict man too. If not for Evelyn's quick thinking, we would've been at those villains' mercy."

Alexander felt a sharp pang of guilt twist in his chest.

If only the Montgomery family hadn't lost Evelyn all those years ago, she wouldn't have needed to develop such survival instincts.

After witnessing Beverly and Walter's outrageous behavior firsthand, he couldn't begin to imagine the hardships Evelyn must have endured growing up with them.

This only strengthened his resolve to deal with Victoria once and for all and bring Evelyn back where she belonged.

As dinner concluded, Alexander, Olivia, and Evelyn huddled together to discuss strategies for handling the demolition situation.

To Alexander, the entire conversation seemed unnecessary - he could have simply delegated the matter to his team with a single phone call.

What the others didn't see were the subtle kicks Olivia kept delivering to his shins beneath the table, forcing him to maintain the charade.

They couldn't risk breaking character now. While they could handle everything discreetly later, they needed to keep up appearances in front of Evelyn.

A sudden yawn escaped Evelyn's lips as exhaustion washed over her.

Lately, sleep seemed to claim her at the most unexpected moments. Though morning sickness hadn't plagued her, her body demanded increasingly longer hours of rest.

Julian noticed her drooping eyelids immediately. "Alexander, Olivia, it's getting late. Let's call it a night. The demolition issue can wait until tomorrow."

The trio departed with minimal farewells.

The moment the elevator doors closed, Alexander declared, "I've already put investigators on the demolition company. There's no way I'll let Evelyn's so-called parents profit from this. She's suffered enough because of them."

Olivia tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Evelyn's current place only has two bedrooms. It's rather cramped. Perhaps we could use this opportunity to get her better accommodations?"

His eyes lit up with sudden inspiration. "Exactly! What about that villa I own near her university? It would be perfect."

Julian stroked his jawline skeptically. "Isn't a villa a bit excessive? With so many families involved in this demolition, if Evelyn suddenly receives a mansion, it will raise too many questions."

Alexander exhaled sharply. "Why must we keep hiding our identities? I truly believe Evelyn has accepted us by now."

He owned numerous luxury properties across the city - each one he longed to place in Evelyn's name.

Julian considered this carefully. "Let's settle things with Victoria first. Then we'll make our move."

They couldn't possibly welcome Evelyn back into the Montgomery family with Victoria still lurking in the shadows.

Besides, Julian was certain someone as manipulative as Victoria wouldn't remain part of their family for long.

Meanwhile, Evelyn avoided work entirely, dividing her time between lectures and the university library to steer clear of Beverly and Walter.

With Alexander constantly by her side, the Simmons couple might think twice before showing up unannounced.

All Evelyn needed to do was hold out until Margaret signed the demolition papers. After that, her adoptive parents would lose all leverage.

Jonathan reached out to her later that evening. "Evelyn, things have quieted down at work. You could come back anytime."

"But I'd prefer to wait until after the demolition is settled."

"Evelyn, don't tell me you're planning to quit once you get that compensation money," Jonathan teased lightly.

Evelyn laughed softly. "With all my debts? I'll hardly be rich after this."
###Chapter 200

"Evelyn, the client specifically requested you to lead the Mael Neighborhood Project."

"They adore your impeccable taste and attention to detail."

"Understood. I'll head to the studio now." Evelyn ended the call, adjusting her face mask nervously.

She couldn't risk being recognized by her adoptive parents.

Jonathan raised an eyebrow at her disguise. "Undercover mission, Ms. Carter?"

"Just being cautious. Email me the project updates later. I'll review everything thoroughly."

No sooner had she settled at her workstation than the studio doors burst open violently.

"Evelyn Carter!"

The shrill voice made Evelyn's head snap up.

Cassandra Blake stood there, a far cry from her usual polished self.

Her designer clothes were replaced by wrinkled garments, her hair unkempt as if she hadn't showered in days.

Evelyn set aside her sketches. "Can I help you with something?"

Jonathan immediately stepped between them. "Ms. Blake, you were terminated. Any trouble here won't be tolerated."

Cassandra's face twisted with rage. "How could you do this, Jonathan? What about your promises that night? You swore you'd take responsibility!"

A shadow crossed his face before he calmly replied, "I never made such promises."

"You liar! We slept together!" she screamed.

"Everyone knows the truth, Cassandra," he snapped. "You framed Evelyn. You brought this on yourself."

Had he known she was a gold digger, he would never have touched her. He'd even gotten tested afterward.

Suddenly, Cassandra collapsed to her knees before Evelyn, tears streaming. "I was wrong! Please forgive me!"

Evelyn blinked in shock. The confrontation had taken an unexpected turn.

She glanced around suspiciously, half-expecting hidden cameras.

With Penelope's influence, Evelyn knew to proceed carefully.

The Blake family's company had declared bankruptcy, leaving them drowning in debt.

Penelope had ghosted Cassandra completely, blocking all contact.

To make matters worse, Cassandra had received legal threats - apologize to Evelyn or face prison.

Forced into submission, she now groveled at Evelyn's feet.

Rage burned inside Cassandra. How did Evelyn always come out on top? The Fleur International Design Competition. Jonathan's favor.

They were equally talented! Why did Evelyn get everything?

Meanwhile, Jonathan watched thoughtfully. Perhaps Evelyn had powerful connections.

Still processing the bizarre scene, Evelyn reached out. "What are you-"

Without warning, Cassandra lunged at her.
###Chapter 201



Cassandra lunged at Evelyn with terrifying speed, her manicured nails aimed straight for the abdomen.

Evelyn's body moved before her mind could process, arms crossing protectively over her stomach.

Jonathan reacted with lightning reflexes, shoving Cassandra aside with enough force to send her stumbling. "Have you lost your damn mind?" he roared.

Cassandra's laughter was shrill and unhinged, her gaze locked on Evelyn's guarded posture. "I know your dirty little secret, Evelyn Carter. That belly you're so desperate to protect."

The realization hit Evelyn like ice water - Cassandra had been watching her too closely these past weeks.

Every passing moment only fueled Cassandra's growing resentment.

While her own career floundered, Evelyn soared as lead designer under Jonathan's mentorship.

The jealousy had festered until Cassandra could no longer contain it.

Evelyn's face drained of color, her pulse hammering against her ribs.

That could have ended catastrophically.

Without Jonathan's intervention... She didn't dare finish the thought.

Stepping forward, Evelyn delivered a stinging slap across Cassandra's cheek. "You've crossed a line you can't uncross," she said, voice dangerously calm.

No one threatened her child and walked away unscathed.

Cassandra's grin turned predatory. "You're pregnant, aren't you? That's why you're so protective."

Evelyn's mask slipped for only a heartbeat before her lips curled in derision. "Maybe you should get your delusions checked by a psychiatrist."

"Then why shield your stomach?" Cassandra challenged.

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "Basic self-preservation. Should I have let you claw my face instead?"

The pregnancy remained her most guarded secret.

Until the divorce was finalized, no one could know about the life growing inside her.

Yet somehow this venomous woman had sniffed out the truth.

Cassandra's attention snapped to Jonathan. "See how she lies? She's some rich bastard's mistress carrying his bastard child while deceiving you!"

Evelyn scoffed. "Your fantasies are truly pathetic. There's nothing between Jonathan and me."

Jonathan's expression darkened. "Security. Now."

Cassandra scrambled to her feet, rage twisting her features. "Why does everything always go your way?" she shrieked.

Evelyn remained impassive. "You made your choices. I didn't force you into anyone's bed."

The security team arrived swiftly, dragging the thrashing woman away as she hurled obscenities.

Outside, Cassandra fumbled for her phone, fingers trembling with fury.

Penelope didn't answer.

She fired off a Twitter DM: 'Evelyn Carter is pregnant.'

The response came within minutes. "Is this true?" Penelope demanded.

"Swear on my life," Cassandra typed back.

"Proof or it didn't happen." Penelope had learned not to trust Cassandra's word after the credit card fiasco.

Some lessons came at great cost.
###Chapter 202

"Evelyn instinctively protected her abdomen when I lunged at her. Her reaction was too visceral. I've had my suspicions for months, but today confirmed everything."

"Why should I trust you? Your last scheme backfired spectacularly. My entire family reprimanded me because of your ridiculous rumors!"

Bitterness twisted Cassandra's features as she thought, "Of course. Penelope gets away with everything because she's a Whitmore, while I bear all the consequences. No one ever listens to my side."

Her voice turned glacial. "Evelyn has protection - that famous actor Daniel Montgomery. I'd bet my last dollar he's the father."

Penelope tapped her manicured nails thoughtfully. "You might be onto something."

Daniel's interference had ruined Penelope's plans to humiliate Evelyn publicly. The memory still rankled.

She examined her fresh French tips. "But accusations require proof. Get me concrete evidence of Evelyn's pregnancy, and we'll talk."

"I'll manage it. Though Ms. Whitmore, you're aware of my current... predicament." Cassandra's jaw tightened. "Jobless, reputation in tatters. I require financial assistance."

Penelope's eye roll was theatrical. "I'll transfer two thousand dors. Bring me proof, and you'll get proper compensation."

The notification chimed. Cassandra's fingers clenched around her phone. This paltry sum wouldn't have covered her monthly spa treatments before. Penelope was mocking her.

Yet desperation won over pride.

As she left, Cassandra cast one last venomous look at the studio building. Evelyn and Penelope would both pay for this humiliation.

Meanwhile, Evelyn slumped in her chair, pulse hammering violently. The confrontation had left her shaken.

Jonathan approached with a steaming mug. "Drink this. You're white as a sheet."

"Thanks... for earlier." The chamomile tea steadied her hands slightly, but did nothing for the nausea rising in her throat.

Suddenly the room tilted. She gripped the desk. "Jonathan—"

"Evelyn!"

Her knees buckled before she could respond.

Jonathan caught her effortlessly. "I've got you. Hospital. Now."

Through gritted teeth, Evelyn gasped, "St. Mary's." Julian would ensure discretion there.

During the frantic drive, Jonathan kept murmuring reassurances while Evelyn fought to stay conscious. With trembling fingers, she dialed her brother.

Julian answered on the first ring. "Evie? What's—"

"Stomach... pain... St. Mary's..." Each word cost her.

"Don't move! I'm coming!"

Relief flooded her. Julian would handle everything. No one could discover her condition.

As Jonathan carried her through the emergency entrance, Nathaniel and Victoria emerged from a parked Mercedes.

Victoria was mid-sentence when Nathaniel froze. "—and the surgical team prepared— Nathaniel? What—"

Her gaze followed his.

Evelyn's unconscious form was disappearing through the automatic doors in another man's arms.
###Chapter 203

A tense silence fell between them.

Evelyn never imagined she would run into Victoria at the hospital.

Evelyn quickly whispered, "Nathaniel, that woman in that man's arms looks just like Victoria. Am I hallucinating?"

Nathaniel's lips thinned. She might be right. It was Victoria.

Irritated, he stormed into the hospital without another word.

Evelyn hurried after him. "Nathaniel, why don't we go ask them? It might be Victoria. We should check on her. Even though you're divorced now, for old times' sake—"

"Enough!" He stopped abruptly, his jaw clenched. The sight of another man carrying Victoria into the emergency room had set him off. "Where's your brother?"

"He's on the third floor. I can take you to him." A faint smirk played on Evelyn's lips. She knew exactly how to twist the knife.

If she framed it like this, Nathaniel wouldn’t spare another thought for Victoria.

From the way that man had cradled Victoria in his arms, Evelyn could tell there was something between them.

And Nathaniel? As a man, how could he possibly tolerate that?

They stepped into the elevator just as Julian rushed down the stairs.

Julian headed straight for the emergency room.

A man stood beside Victoria, explaining urgently to the nurse and doctor, "She collapsed suddenly. It might be low blood sugar or extreme shock."

Julian narrowed his eyes and strode forward. "I know this patient's condition. Everyone else, step out."

Hearing his voice, Victoria finally relaxed. With Julian here, she knew she was safe.

Still, Jonathan hesitated. He gave her one last worried glance. "Victoria, I'll wait outside. Don't be afraid."

Julian studied him with a sharp gaze. Her admirer? Not bad—handsome and attentive. But he hasn’t earned my approval yet. Not just anyone gets to be my sister’s man.

Inside the emergency room, Julian examined Victoria. Knowing she was pregnant, he already had an idea of what had happened.

Half an hour later, Victoria finally stirred.

Her eyelids fluttered open. Seeing Julian beside her, she exhaled in relief. "Julian."

"Victoria, you're awake. Any discomfort?"

"Just dizzy. Everything went black, and I felt cold before I passed out. Am I sick? Is the baby okay?" Her hand instinctively cradled her stomach.

The baby’s safety was her biggest concern.

Julian hesitated for a moment. "The baby is fine—strong and healthy. But you—you're malnourished and under too much stress. That’s why you fainted."

He sat beside her, debating his next words. "Victoria, I know you might not want to hear this, but your pregnancy is becoming obvious. You can’t hide it forever."

As her brother, he felt he had the right to know—who was the father?

Maybe, just maybe, his position would finally get her to talk.
###Chapter 204

Evelyn hesitated for a moment. "Julian, I don’t want anyone to know I’m pregnant—at least not until I’m officially divorced from Nathaniel."

Julian frowned, unable to comprehend her reasoning. "Why? Is the baby’s father going to cause trouble for you?"

She shook her head, her eyes pleading. "Just keep this between us, please."

Those wide, vulnerable eyes of hers were impossible to resist.

Julian caved in less than three minutes.

As her older brother, he couldn’t deny her this.

Years of guilt weighed on him. Evelyn rarely asked for anything, so how could he refuse?

His pride as her guardian? Irrelevant compared to her well-being.

He ruffled her hair gently. "Fine, I’ll keep your secret. But you have to promise me you’ll take care of yourself. If you feel unwell, you tell me immediately."

"I promise! That’s why I called you right away," Evelyn assured him.

Julian was the only one she trusted enough to insist on coming to Peace Hospital.

He arched a brow. "Speaking of which, who’s the guy who brought you here? An admirer? Not bad-looking, I’ll give him that."

She coughed. "You’re way off, Julian. That’s Jonathan Reeves—my boss and mentor."

"Ah, your boss." Julian assessed him with a critical eye. "Ambitious, I suppose. Potential, but nothing more."

In his opinion, Jonathan wasn’t nearly good enough for her.

Evelyn was extraordinary. No ordinary man could ever measure up.

If Jonathan was just running some small studio, Julian doubted his net worth was impressive. He mentally questioned the studio’s credibility.

Evelyn sighed. "Stop it, Julian."

His phone buzzed incessantly, but he ignored it.

Just then, Jonathan walked in. "Evelyn, you’re awake. How are you feeling?"

"Much better, thanks to you," she replied gratefully.

"Don’t mention it. You really scared me. Glad you’re okay."

Jonathan suddenly noticed the doctor’s icy glare.

Evelyn tugged Julian’s sleeve. "Julian."

Only then did he reluctantly look away. "Relax. I’m not going to eat him."

Jonathan blinked in surprise. "You’re her brother?"

He’d heard Evelyn was an orphan who had recently found her family.

The fact that her brother was a doctor intrigued him.

She nodded. "Yes, this is my third brother, Dr. Julian Montgomery."

Jonathan extended a hand eagerly. "Nice to meet you. I’m Jonathan Reeves."

Julian shook it with minimal enthusiasm. "Don’t try to charm me. You’re her boss, right? She collapsed from overwork. Lighten her workload—without cutting her pay."

"Julian!" Evelyn scolded, embarrassed by his bluntness.

Before he could respond, a nurse entered. "Dr. Montgomery, your sister is waiting for you in your office."
###Chapter 205

Julian stiffened the moment the nurse spoke.

His secret was about to be uncovered.

Evelyn studied him with suspicion. "Sister?"

Did he have another sister she didn’t know about?

He rushed to clarify, "Evelyn, you're my only sister. I swear!"

Never in his life had he acknowledged Victoria as family.

His nervous reaction amused Evelyn. "I didn’t even accuse you of anything, Julian. Why so defensive?"

It was like watching a guilty boyfriend caught red-handed.

He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Just wanted to make things clear."

Turning to the nurse, he said, "Got it. I'll leave shortly."

The nurse hesitated, recognizing the visitor’s identity.

Today, Julian was supposed to meet Nathaniel to discuss the surgical plan for Eleanor.

But Evelyn’s sudden trip to the emergency room changed everything. Her health came first.

"You should go," Jonathan reassured him. "I’ll stay with her."

Julian nodded. "Rest well, Evelyn. We’ll go home together later."

With that, he took the elevator back to his office.

When he pushed the door open, Victoria and Nathaniel were waiting. His expression remained unreadable.

Victoria brightened instantly. "Julian, I called you so many times. Were you busy?"

"Yes. There was an emergency."

Her eyes gleamed. "Was the patient a woman?"

If she wasn’t mistaken, Evelyn had been rushed to the ER.

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened, locking onto Julian, waiting for confirmation.

If it was Evelyn, he needed to know how she was doing.

Julian’s eyes flickered between them before settling on Nathaniel.

Memories of Nathaniel bringing Evelyn to the hospital resurfaced, and he answered coldly, "No."

He would never admit the truth—not if it meant keeping Nathaniel away from Evelyn forever.

Victoria suppressed a sigh. A missed opportunity. If Evelyn had been the patient, she could’ve twisted the situation to ruin her reputation further.

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened before he redirected the conversation. "Let’s focus on the matter at hand."

He had come personally to discuss Eleanor’s surgery.

Julian took his seat. "You didn’t need to come. The surgical plan requires discussion with the medical team. It’s not something we can finalize now—especially since you’re not a doctor, Mr. Whitmore."

Victoria paled. "Julian, Nathaniel is just concerned about his grandmother."

Nathaniel shot her a chilling look, and she shrank back, sweat forming on her brow.

She had lied to him, claiming the surgical plan was ready just to bring him here.

She hadn’t expected Julian to expose her so bluntly.

Julian noticed her guilt immediately.

Deliberately, he asked, "Victoria, did you mislead Mr. Whitmore?"

Her mind raced for an excuse. "I thought it would help if you two discussed it directly. For Mrs. Whitmore’s sake."

Her back was soaked with sweat.

If Julian revealed the truth, would Nathaniel call off their engagement?
###Chapter 206

Victoria's hands trembled as she faced Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, I'm considering the long-term benefits. It's crucial for everyone to understand the surgical details."

"What purpose would that serve? He's not a medical professional," Julian countered, his calculated words pushing her to the brink.

Her forced smile wavered dangerously.

Nathaniel rose abruptly, barely containing his fury. "We'll discuss this after Dr. Montgomery consults with the specialists."

With that, he strode out, his movements sharp with suppressed anger.

Victoria reached for him, but he brushed her off without hesitation. His eyes held none of their usual warmth.

Left standing alone, she turned to Julian, frustration simmering. "Was that really necessary?"

"I merely stated facts," Julian replied coolly. "You've been so eager to marry him, I assumed your relationship was solid. But from what I just witnessed? He doesn't care for you."

"Julian, Nathaniel and I are engaged," Victoria snapped. "He loves me. He's just upset about my oversight."

Julian's gaze sharpened. "Is that so? Or did he only agree to this engagement after you promised to arrange his grandmother's surgery?"

Her face paled. "That's absurd! We've been together three years. If not for that accident, I'd already be his wife." She drew a shaky breath. "You've never approved of me, but don't interfere with my happiness."

"If you're so convinced this is happiness, proceed," Julian growled. "Victoria, while I've never liked you, I opposed this match because he's wrong for you. That was my only motive."

Despite her being adopted, he couldn't ignore his conscience.

She laughed bitterly. "For my sake? Then prove it—stop lecturing me and focus on perfecting Mrs. Whitmore's surgery."

Storming out, one thought burned in her mind—she wasn't a Montgomery by blood, but she'd carve her own destiny.

In this world, only power guaranteed happiness.

Jonathan stood in the hospital billing queue when a man in a tailored black suit nearly collided with him.

Glancing up, Jonathan met piercing eyes that sent an involuntary chill through him.

Nathaniel Whitmore towered over him, his presence commanding the space between them.

Recognition flickered in Nathaniel's gaze—this was the man who'd brought Evelyn to the hospital.

His jaw tightened as he noted the bills in Jonathan's hand. "Settling medical fees?" Nathaniel's tone was glacial.

"Y-yes," Jonathan stammered, unnerved by the intensity radiating from the other man.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. "Is the patient recovering well?"

Jonathan hesitated. Does he know Evelyn?

Nathaniel's impatience flared. "I asked you a question."

"The patient is stable," Jonathan answered cautiously. "Sir, are you here for a consultation?"

Something felt off. Nathaniel's demeanor was too authoritative, his face oddly familiar.

Then it clicked.

Jonathan's eyes widened. "You're Nathaniel Whitmore—CEO of Whitmore Group?"
###Chapter 207

Nathaniel Whitmore's gaze sharpened as he hadn't anticipated being recognized.

He responded coolly. "Yes."

Jonathan Reeves was instantly electrified. "What an honor to meet you, Mr. Whitmore! I own Elite Studio. We crossed paths briefly at the Fleur International Design Competition. Truly a privilege."

Nathaniel arched a brow. Years of dealing with ambitious men like Jonathan had honed his ability to read their motives effortlessly.

His eyes flicked to the hospital bill in Jonathan's hand. "What's your connection to the patient?"

Jonathan answered eagerly, "She's my employee. Collapsed suddenly, so I rushed her here."

"Do you routinely push your staff to exhaustion?" Nathaniel's tone carried disapproval.

"Not at all! Hiring Evelyn was a godsend. She's exceptional. Mr. Whitmore, you saw her win first place at Fleur yourself."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. He pressed further. "Ah, now I recall. What exactly is your relationship with her?"

Jonathan hesitated, caught off guard by the personal inquiry.

Clearing his throat, he replied, "Let's just say... she might soon be my girlfriend. Things are progressing nicely."

The air turned glacial. Nathaniel's expression hardened, making Jonathan instantly regret his words.

Though Nathaniel schooled his features quickly, his stormy eyes betrayed him.

He hadn't expected Evelyn to move on so swiftly with another man.

Just then, Jonathan produced a business card. "My card, Mr. Whitmore. I'd be thrilled to collaborate someday."

Nathaniel studied it before accepting. "Perhaps there will be opportunities."

"Really? That's fantastic! I won't disappoint you, sir!" Jonathan nearly vibrated with excitement.

A partnership with Whitmore Industries could skyrocket Elite Studio to unimaginable heights!

Watching the naked ambition in Jonathan's eyes, Nathaniel pocketed the card and glanced toward the ER doors.

Then he turned on his heel and strode away.

Jonathan remained, watching the retreating figure with dollar signs in his eyes. "Is this my golden ticket?"

Moments later, Victoria Sinclair stepped off the elevator, scanning the hallway for Nathaniel.

Jonathan approached smoothly. "Looking for Mr. Whitmore?"

She turned, recognizing him as the man who'd carried Evelyn in. A calculated smile curved her lips. "And you are?"

"Jonathan Reeves, Elite Studio's owner. I just spoke with Mr. Whitmore—he went that way." He extended another card.

"Thank you." She accepted it, noting the hospital bill. "Visiting someone special, Mr. Reeves? A girlfriend perhaps?"

He chuckled. "Working on it."

Victoria's smile widened. "Any woman would be lucky to have such a successful suitor. Best of luck!"

"Much appreciated." He watched her leave, mind racing with possibilities.

Not only had he exchanged cards with Nathaniel Whitmore, but he'd also charmed the illustrious Victoria Sinclair!

Was fortune finally smiling upon him?
###Chapter 208

One opportunity with these wealthy elites was all Jonathan needed to make his fortune.

Evelyn waited patiently until Jonathan finally appeared. "Was the line long?" she asked.

"A bit," he replied, masking his excitement. He chose not to mention his unexpected meeting with Nathaniel.

Settling beside her, he inquired, "So, you have three brothers. One's a doctor—what about the other two?"

"They live in Nord City. My eldest brother works in real estate, and the other is at a law firm. Just a junior associate, really."

Jonathan nodded knowingly. "No wonder that prestigious firm took legal action when Cassandra slandered you. I doubt your brother is just a junior associate. You can be honest with me, Evelyn."

She shook her head. "It's probably just because he gets along well with his colleagues. They were willing to help."

Her humility only intrigued him more. Getting into that firm wasn’t easy—its employees were highly educated with bright futures.

To Jonathan, Evelyn clearly came from a well-connected family.

Aside from her reputation as a top designer, dating her would elevate his career to new heights.

The thought sent a thrill through him, visions of success and triumphant homecomings flashing in his mind.

Soon after, Julian returned to the emergency room with a frown. "Evelyn, an emergency surgery just came up. I can't take you home."

Jonathan immediately offered, "I can drive her."

Reluctantly, Julian agreed. "Alright. Be careful on the road."

Evelyn understood his demanding schedule. Besides, she was well enough to go home alone.

She turned to Jonathan. "You don’t have to trouble yourself. I can just take a cab."

"It’s no trouble at all. I promised Julian I’d make sure you got home safely."

After a brief hesitation, she accepted.

An hour later, they arrived at her neighborhood. Jonathan glanced around. "You live here?"

If he remembered correctly, she used to stay in an older district slated for demolition.

"Yes, I moved recently," she replied.



"And you claim you're not wealthy? These properties are expensive."

Belongs to N?velDrama.Org.

Jonathan had started his business right after college, yet even now, he couldn’t afford a home in this area.

"Not really. Remember my prize money? My brothers helped me with the down payment."

Jonathan deduced her brothers must be well-off. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to lend her such a substantial sum.

The realization fueled his enthusiasm. "Text me when you get inside. I’ll feel better knowing you’re safe."

"Alright. And thank you—I owe you dinner sometime."

He waved her off, watching as she disappeared into the complex.

Pulling out his phone, he checked property prices in the area. Plans began forming in his mind—strategies to win Evelyn over.

Since she was an orphan, she must crave love and security.

The thought lingered as he drove away.
###Chapter 209

Margaret and Olivia were waiting when Evelyn arrived home. Discovering she'd fainted from malnutrition, Margaret immediately prepared a pot of hearty chicken soup.

Though Evelyn wasn't particularly fond of nourishing broths, she drank it without complaint—for the baby's sake.

Resting on the sofa, she glanced at Olivia. "Where's Alexander?"

"He's at work. Vista Properties just opened a new branch in Bern City. He went to meet an old friend there."

"I see. That's wonderful. I owe this house to his friend's help. Maybe I should invite him to dinner as thanks."

Olivia coughed lightly. "No need. Alexander already handled it. Consider the debt repaid."

When Evelyn didn't press further, Olivia exhaled in relief.

Where would she even find someone to play that role?

Alexander returned just in time for dinner. His brows knitted the moment he saw Evelyn. "Evelyn, you need to eat better. You're practically skin and bones."

Her lips twitched. That was ridiculous—she'd actually gained weight recently.

He continued, "Don't worry about the demolition. My friend in construction agreed to meet you personally to finalize the contracts. Your adoptive parents won't be able to interfere."

The "friend" was actually the construction company's CEO, who had agreed to let Alexander pull strings.

Evelyn brightened. "That's amazing! Your friend has been incredibly helpful. I really should treat him to dinner."

Alexander froze. How could he explain that he was the so-called friend?

He shook his head quickly. "Not necessary. I already took him out today."

Evelyn had no choice but to let it go.

That night, she lay in bed, gently stroking her stomach.

Thankfully, her baby was safe.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at work to find a bouquet of roses on her desk—no note attached.

Curious, she asked, "Was this delivered to the wrong person?"

Her colleagues giggled. "Nope, they're definitely for you. We're jealous."

Evelyn sneezed at the flowers, rubbing her nose. "Do you know who sent them?"

"No idea. Care to guess?"

Their knowing looks gave it away before Jonathan appeared with a box of supplements. "Evelyn, these are excellent for women's health. Since your blood sugar's low, they should help."

She forced a polite smile. "Thank you, Jonathan, but I can't accept them."

The others chimed in, "Come on, Evelyn! Mr. Reeves researched these, and we all gave recommendations!"

He set the box on her desk. "Just take them. I need to get back to work."

As he walked away, Evelyn sighed.

She wasn't blind to his feelings, but a relationship was the last thing on her mind right now.
###Chapter 210

Evelyn submitted her college assignments and met up with Sophia for some shopping. It had been ages since they last spent time together.

Sophia beamed at her. "Evelyn, I heard your neighborhood is getting demolished! You're about to become loaded! I'm thrilled for you!"

"Thanks," Evelyn replied with a small smile. "Honestly, I never saw it coming. But I doubt the compensation will be life-changing."

As they stepped into the mall, Evelyn's phone buzzed. It was Jonathan.

"Evelyn, where are you? I don't see you at the office."

"I'm out shopping with Sophia," she answered.

"Ah. How about dinner tonight? Bring your friend along."

She hesitated. "Jonathan, I already have plans with my family. My brother Harrison and his wife just got back from Nord City."

Only then did Jonathan drop the invitation.

The call ended, and Sophia nudged her. "Why’d you say no? It was Jonathan asking you out! Don’t worry about me—I wouldn’t have been a third wheel."

"Sophia, you know my situation," Evelyn sighed. "Jonathan would never accept a divorced woman, let alone one carrying her ex-husband’s child. No man would."

"You’re stuck in the past," Sophia insisted. "Jonathan’s a great guy with serious potential. Just think about it. Come on, let’s get our nails done. There’s a new salon that just opened."

Evelyn shook her head. "Not for me. The smell makes me nauseous." Pregnancy and nail salons didn’t mix.

They sat down inside anyway, and the overpowering stench of chemicals and perfume hit them instantly. Evelyn wrinkled her nose, glancing around—and then she froze.

There was only one person she knew who drowned herself in perfume like that.

Penelope.

Penelope’s heels clicked sharply as she sauntered over, lips curling in a smirk. "Evelyn, do you even know how much a manicure costs here? If you can’t afford it, maybe stick to discount salons. This place isn’t for people like you."

Sophia scoffed before Evelyn could respond. "Only someone as tacky as you would think a manicure is a status symbol. Then again, you do bathe in perfume like it’s water."

"Watch your mouth," Penelope snapped. "Broke girls like you should stick to coupon deals."

Sophia smirked. "Tightening your belt these days, aren’t you? Heard your cards got frozen. Maybe save the attitude for when you can actually pay your own bills."

Penelope’s face flushed with rage. "That’s your fault!"

The mention of money set her off. She lifted her chin defiantly. "Victoria gave me a card, actually. I can spend however I please. Her wedding gifts are beyond anything you’ll ever see."

She smirked. "Mrs. Whitmore spoils her rotten. I’m sure Victoria’s been handed plenty of assets—unlike you, scraping for crumbs and pretending you belong."

Sophia laughed. "You say that like it’s your money. Oh wait—it’s not. Why are you so proud of spending someone else’s cash?"

Penelope’s mouth opened, then shut. She turned back to Evelyn with a sneer. "The engagement party’s this weekend. Victoria’s brothers will all be there. Try not to be too jealous."
###Chapter 211



Nathaniel and Victoria were announcing their engagement this weekend?

Evelyn had known for weeks, yet hearing it from Penelope still made her chest constrict.

Sophia scoffed. "Let's send our warmest regards to that cheating bastard and his gold-digging whore. Besides, Evelyn's getting demolition money soon. She could upgrade to a real man anytime."

Penelope doubled over with laughter. "Demolition money? Like that could ever elevate her status!"

Evelyn gripped Sophia's arm, steering her away before fists started flying.

Penelope Whitmore wasn't someone to provoke - not with the Whitmore family's influence.

As Evelyn retreated, Penelope dialed Cassandra. "Dig up everything about Evelyn Carter's demolition. I want details."

"Consider it done." Cassandra hung up, bitterness twisting her features.

Why did undeserving nobodies like Evelyn always catch lucky breaks?

Life was truly unjust.

On another floor, Sophia shook with indignation. "Why stop me? That spoiled heiress needs to be put in her place! You're about to be loaded, and she's just-"

"It's not envy," Evelyn corrected quietly. "It's contempt."

Sophia's eyes widened. "Wait... is your ex actually that wealthy?"

The silence stretched until Evelyn gestured to a corporate billboard. "He runs that empire."

"No. Freaking. Way." Sophia clapped a hand over her mouth. "You married the Whitmore Group's CEO? And never told me?"

"NDA." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Plus, who brags about being someone's hidden shame? Thank God I kept quiet before they discarded me."

Sophia processed this bombshell before exhaling sharply. "Silver lining - you're free of that vipers' nest now."

"Jonathan's decent. Handsome, driven." Sophia squeezed her hand. "Stick with people from your own world."

Evelyn's laugh was brittle. "Exactly. Birds of a feather." She rubbed her temples. "Sorry for the mood kill."



"Pfft." Sophia bumped shoulders with her. "You're building your own empire now. Soon you'll be the one they're scrambling to impress. Our Cinderella story's just getting started!"

They parted ways, Evelyn returning to her suddenly peaceful apartment.

With Alexander Montgomery handling the demolition, Margaret and Walter hadn't dared harass her lately.

For the first time in months, she could breathe.

After lectures, Evelyn headed straight to work.

"Free this weekend?" a colleague asked.

Evelyn blinked. "Tomorrow's Saturday already?"

"Family emergency. Could you cover my shift?"

"Sure." Weekends at the studio were quiet anyway - just her and a skeleton crew.

Jonathan brought afternoon coffees. "Big client acquisition. Celebrate with me?"

"Does this mean weekend overtime?" someone groaned.

"Smart cookie." Jonathan grinned. "Power through this crunch, then rotate days off."

He slid a cup toward Evelyn. "Hope this doesn't wreck your plans."

"Plans?" She arched a brow. "I live to work overtime." Then pushed the coffee away. "You know I hate caffeine."
###Chapter 212



Evelyn's unease lingered—what if someone had spiked the drink? She wasn't willing to take any risks.

Her tastes had shifted drastically since her pregnancy.

"You don't like coffee anymore? I remember you were obsessed with this brand in college," Jonathan remarked.

The colleagues around them perked up with interest. "Wow, Mr. Reeves remembers your old favorites, Evelyn!"

Another chimed in with a teasing grin. "Evelyn, isn't our boss just the perfect package? Young, handsome, and considerate?"

Evelyn felt her cheeks warm. With her coworkers playing matchmaker, she was at a loss for words.

Noticing her discomfort, Jonathan stepped in. He shot the group a sharp look. "That's enough. You're overstepping. I'm simply looking out for Evelyn as her superior. She's our lead designer."

Relief flooded through her at his words. She had no idea how to handle this kind of attention.

Once the crowd dispersed, Jonathan lowered his voice. "Evelyn, don’t stress. My feelings are my own to manage. Don’t overthink it."

After a brief hesitation, she met his gaze. "Jonathan, actually, I—"

"It's fine," he cut in smoothly. "Just focus on your work. Speaking of which, you’re taking charge of this new project. I trust no one else with it."

"Is it the villa interior design?"

"No. It’s an engagement ceremony. The client has high standards—not just for the venue, but every detail. They’ve requested an in-person consultation."

An engagement ceremony?

The mention of it made Evelyn think of Victoria and Nathaniel’s engagement, but she quickly shoved the memory aside.

"Jonathan, our studio doesn’t usually handle events. We specialize in interiors, not wedding planning," she pointed out.

"I know, but this is an exception. We have to take this job—it could elevate our reputation. Please, Evelyn," he urged.

With him framing it that way, refusal wasn’t an option. "Fine. But I expect more projects after this. My mortgage isn’t paying itself."

"Of course."

Jonathan turned and strode back to his office, immediately making a call.

His tone shifted into smooth flattery. "Ms. Sinclair, it’s all settled. My team is fully committed."

"Really? Perfect. I’ve heard Evelyn Carter is part of your studio. With her on board, I’m confident it’ll be flawless."



"Don’t worry, Ms. Sinclair. My entire team is skilled and eager for challenges. If you have any adjustments, just say the word. We’ll revise accordingly."

A smirk curled Victoria’s lips. "Thank you."

"The honor is ours. We’re grateful for this opportunity."

"How charming. But keep this engagement under wraps. I don’t want the couple’s identities revealed before the ceremony."

"Your secret is safe with me, Ms. Sinclair. I’m the only one who knows, and I won’t breathe a word."

Victoria’s smile widened. "I’ll share photos of the decorations afterward. Consider it free publicity for your studio."

Jonathan nearly beamed. "That’s incredible! Thank you, Ms. Sinclair."

The call ended, leaving Victoria in high spirits.

She couldn’t wait to see the look on Evelyn’s face when she realized whose engagement she was designing.
###Chapter 213

Victoria Sinclair couldn't contain her excitement about the upcoming engagement ceremony scheduled for the day after tomorrow.

She reached for her phone and dialed Alexander Montgomery's number.

The call connected instantly, bringing a smile to her lips. "Alexander, are you swamped these days? Was it really necessary for you to personally oversee the acquisition of such a small company?"

Victoria knew Alexander had returned to Bern City to handle the deal himself.

If it wasn't significant, he wouldn't have bothered.

The thought of Evelyn Carter's luck still irked her.

If Alexander hadn't intervened at that exact moment, that old man's daughter might have taught Evelyn a harsh lesson.

Instead, Cassandra Blake had ended up as the scapegoat.

"This is business-related," Alexander replied, his tone steady and reassuring.

He would never admit that his efforts were all for Evelyn.

Not only had he flown back personally, but he had also taken over the company himself.

Victoria decided not to press further and changed the subject. "You must be wrapping up your work by now. My engagement ceremony is in two days. You and Olivia will make it, right?"

"Yes," he answered after a brief pause. "There's something I need to discuss with you after the ceremony."

Her curiosity piqued. "What is it? Don't leave me hanging—why not tell me now?"

"Not yet," he said firmly.

A sense of unease settled over her.

Suppressing her frustration, she sighed. "Fine. Just remember, I'll be getting married soon after the engagement. Grandmother promised to give me her collections once I'm married."

Alexander's voice turned stern. "That won't happen."

Victoria stiffened. "Why not? She promised."

"Victoria, you know those were meant for her biological granddaughter—not you."

Angry tears welled in her eyes. "Alexander, don't I deserve to be your sister after all these years?"

She had bragged to Penelope Whitmore and others about being part of the Montgomery family.

Everyone expected her to receive lavish wedding gifts.

If Alexander refused now, what would people think?

Would they laugh at her?

His voice remained calm but firm. "Victoria, I've treated you well all these years. You haven't forgotten that, have you?"

Victoria froze.

Of course she hadn't forgotten.

But years of luxury as a Montgomery had made her push those memories aside.

In her mind, she was the true Montgomery heiress.

After all, she believed Evelyn would never return to claim her place.

Her expression darkened, but her voice stayed composed, laced with a plea. "I haven't forgotten. I know who I owe my life to. But publicly, I'm still a Montgomery. If the wedding gifts are lacking, people will mock us."

"Don't worry. I won't let you down. But Grandmother's collections? Forget about them. That's her final wish."

Besides, the Montgomery brothers had already found their long-lost sister.

Those treasures belonged to Evelyn.

Victoria clenched her fists, forcing herself to stay calm. "Fine. Understood. Just don't forget to come the day after tomorrow."

"We'll be there. All three of us."

A flicker of surprise crossed her face. "Really? Even Nathaniel? Thank you, Alexander."

She hadn't expected Nathaniel Whitmore to attend.

Alexander always kept his word.

The call ended.

The moment the line disconnected, her smile vanished.

Thoughts of the wedding gifts consumed her.

Fury overtook her.

Like a storm unleashed, she destroyed everything in sight.

Why couldn't she have those assets?

Why?
###Chapter 214

Victoria Sinclair was still recognized as a daughter of the Montgomery family. She deserved some credit for tolerating that deranged old woman in the Montgomery mansion all these years.

Perhaps the Montgomery brothers were still holding out hope for the real Ms. Montgomery to return?

In their dreams! That would never happen—not in this lifetime.

Victoria sat down, her face hidden behind her hands, but the corners of her lips curled into a sinister smirk.

For now, she would play along. Once the Montgomery brothers attended her engagement ceremony, she could move forward with her next step.

As for the wedding gifts… she’d find a way to secure them.

Even if she couldn’t demand them outright, that senile old woman might just hand them over willingly. And that wouldn’t interfere with her arrangement with Alexander.

The real Ms. Montgomery would never return—Victoria had already stolen her place.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter sat in her office, sketching designs for the engagement ceremony venue. The romantic, dreamy layout she’d drawn brought a wistful smile to her lips.

In truth, she had once imagined her own wedding. But her marriage to Nathaniel had been rushed—no ceremony, no formalities.

Back then, he had been unconscious, clinging to life by a thread.

Young and infatuated, Evelyn hadn’t regretted marrying him. But who could have predicted how things would turn out?

Distance was best when it came to the person you loved.

If she could turn back time, she’d smack her past self upside the head.

What did Nathaniel’s life or death have to do with her?

Pitying a man was the beginning of misfortune—and she was living proof.

A few silent curses later, she exhaled sharply, then gently touched her stomach. Baby, I don’t resent you. I may despise that bastard, but I love children.

Just then, her phone rang—Margaret Dawson.

"Evelyn, the demolition team came by this afternoon. Tomorrow’s the signing, but they told me someone already signed for our house!"

"What? Nathaniel already handled this. Who signed it?"

"According to the neighbors, your adoptive parents were here earlier. It must’ve been them. What do we do now?"

Evelyn shot to her feet and grabbed her bag. "Stay calm, Aunt Margaret. I’m on my way."

Jonathan Reeves caught up to her in the hallway. "Where are you going in such a hurry?"

"Family emergency."

"Let me drive you. It’s quitting time anyway."

Evelyn, eager to reach Margaret, nodded and slid into his car.

They sped toward the old neighborhood.

The moment they arrived, Evelyn saw her adoptive parents harassing Margaret.

She stormed over, her voice icy. "Stop! What the hell are you doing?"

Beverly Simmons smirked. "I signed the demolition papers, Evelyn Carter. That house is ours. Don’t think you’re getting a single penny."

Evelyn’s brows furrowed. "That’s impossible. You don’t own it. How could you sign anything?"

Jonathan stepped forward. "Evelyn, stay with Aunt Margaret. I’ll talk to the project manager."

Beverly and Walter exchanged smug glances before she sneered. "Waste your time if you want. The papers are signed. Come on, Walter. Let’s go wait for our money."

As Evelyn comforted Margaret, Jonathan returned from the office, his expression grim. "Evelyn… did you piss someone off?"
###Chapter 215

Evelyn found it peculiar. Who could she possibly have angered?

The list of people who might hold a grudge against her was short—only Penelope and Victoria came to mind.

Suddenly, everything clicked into place.

"I'm not entirely sure yet," Evelyn murmured.

At that moment, a sleek black car pulled up abruptly by the curb. Alexander's expression darkened as he stepped out.

"Evelyn, are you all right? Where are Walter and Beverly? I need to have a word with them."

Evelyn shook her head. "They already left."

Walter and Beverly, who had been harassing her relentlessly, had fled the moment they spotted Alexander.

They knew better than to stick around when he was involved—they feared his wrath.

Jonathan turned to Evelyn. "Let's get Aunt Margaret home first."

Alexander's sharp gaze landed on Jonathan, his tone icy. "And you are?"

Evelyn quickly intervened. "Alexander, this is Jonathan Reeves, my boss and my senior from university."

Jonathan offered a polite smile. "Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Montgomery."

Alexander gave a curt nod. So, this was the studio owner Julian had mentioned—the one who'd rushed Evelyn to the hospital.

At least he seemed decent. The fact that he'd helped Evelyn made him marginally tolerable in Alexander's eyes.

His expression softened as he turned back to Evelyn and Margaret. "Get in the car. I'll take you both home."

After helping Margaret into the vehicle, Evelyn turned and waved at Jonathan.

"Thank you for today, Jonathan."

"Anytime," he replied.

Jonathan watched as they drove off in the sleek Volkswagen. His eyes narrowed when he recognized the model—it wasn't just any ordinary car.

A Volkswagen Phaeton. Worth at least a few hundred thousand dollars.

Definitely not something an average person could afford.

A realization struck him—Evelyn hadn't been entirely honest about her circumstances. No wonder she owned that million-dollar house in the upscale neighborhood.

A loan couldn't have covered that.

A surge of determination coursed through him. He had to make her his. If he succeeded, he wouldn't have to struggle anymore.

Inside the car, Margaret fretted anxiously. "Evelyn, what if Walter and Beverly really did receive the demolition payment?"

"Don't worry, Aunt Margaret," Alexander reassured her, gripping the steering wheel. "They won't get a single cent. I've been in real estate long enough to know how these things work. Trust me."

Evelyn nodded in agreement. "Alexander's right. We need to trust him to handle this."

When they arrived home, Olivia tended to Margaret while Evelyn and Alexander settled in the living room.

After a moment of silence, Evelyn spoke up. "Alexander, according to Jonathan's inquiries at the Demolition Department, it seems I've angered someone influential."

"Don't worry," Alexander replied, his jaw tight. "I've already sent someone to investigate."

He was seething. Despite having personally reminded Geoffrey Wilson over dinner, things had still gone wrong.

His phone buzzed—Charles was calling. Alexander stepped onto the balcony, closing the door behind him. When he turned back, his expression was stormy.

"Who is it?"

He would make sure the person behind this paid dearly.

After a brief hesitation, Charles replied, "It appears the Whitmore family is involved."

"What?"

At the mention of the Whitmores, Alexander spun around, glancing through the glass door at Evelyn in the living room. He shut the balcony door firmly before lowering his voice.

"Did you find out why?"

How dare Nathaniel target Evelyn? What was he playing at?

Was he using the demolition as leverage to force her into becoming his mistress?
###Chapter 216

Alexander's imagination ran wild in those brief moments. By the time he snapped back to reality, his fury had reached a boiling point—he could commit murder without hesitation.

"We're uncertain of the exact motive, but it was indeed the Whitmore family who instructed Geoffrey to target Ms. Evelyn. After all, the Whitmores hold significant influence in Bern City. Optima Construction wouldn't dare oppose them."

"Nathaniel truly has the audacity, doesn't he? How dare he?" Alexander seethed.

His blood burned with rage.

Nathaniel had the nerve to pursue Victoria while orchestrating such schemes. Worse, he still relied on Julian to operate on Eleanor. And yet, he targeted Evelyn?

After hanging up, Alexander immediately dialed Julian. This matter was too critical to delay. If Nathaniel was truly framing Evelyn—especially in such a despicable manner—their alliance with the Whitmores needed reevaluation.

He wouldn't hesitate to call off Victoria's engagement to Nathaniel.

Evelyn waited in the living room as Alexander finished his call. Just then, her phone buzzed—an unknown number.

She answered cautiously. "Hello? Who is this?"

"It's me, you fool! You've landed me in so much trouble. How does it feel, Evelyn? Disappointed? You waited so long for that demolition payment, thinking you could change your fate. But you failed! Hahaha!" The voice on the other end cackled.

Evelyn's expression darkened. "Was this your doing, Cassandra? No, you're not capable of this alone. Penelope must be behind it."

Though Penelope wasn't particularly clever, her status as a Whitmore made pulling strings effortless.

Cassandra sneered. "That airheaded brat is clueless! She just flaunts her family name. I orchestrated everything! I made sure Walter and Beverly signed the documents after they left their bank details with me. No matter how furious you are, that money will never reach you!"

"Cassandra, you're nothing more than Penelope's lapdog. Without her, do you think Geoffrey would spare you a glance? Oh, wait—maybe you could warm his bed. That seems to be your specialty, considering how often you've done it with older men."

A shrill scream erupted from the other end. "Evelyn, you'll regret this! I swear!"

Evelyn hung up without another word. So, Penelope was involved—though it wasn't entirely unexpected. Why did the Whitmores always cross her path?

Years ago, she'd endured Penelope's bullying. Now, it had escalated. Margaret's health had been fragile lately, and failing to secure the demolition payment would devastate her. The guilt would consume Evelyn.

She pulled out her phone, intending to text Nathaniel—demanding he control Penelope. To her surprise, she realized she'd already blocked him.

She tried calling instead. No answer.

Frustrated, she typed out a furious message: If you don't rein in that lunatic Penelope, don't blame me for what happens next.

Evelyn had leverage over Penelope. The moment she sent the text, Nathaniel called back.

Just then, Alexander stepped into the living room, his call concluded. Flustered, Evelyn quickly ended Nathaniel's call.

"Alexander, any updates?"

He cleared his throat. "I looked into it. It seems Walter and Beverly exploited some loopholes."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. At least he didn't realize the Whitmores were involved. With his temper, she wouldn't have been able to stop him.

Still, she couldn't fathom why they'd targeted her.

Her phone buzzed again. Alexander glanced at it.

"Aren't you going to answer that?"
###Chapter 217

Evelyn froze for a second. She glanced down at her phone. Nathaniel.

Her head snapped up as she replied smoothly, "Oh, it's nothing. Just a spam call."

Alexander's brows furrowed. "Who's bothering you?"

Was it Nathaniel, that divorced bastard?

Evelyn bit her lip before coming up with a plausible excuse. "I've been getting calls about home renovations lately. You know, since I just moved."

Alexander nodded. So that was it.

His gaze lingered on her. "Evelyn, if anyone gives you trouble, you tell me."

"I will."

She muted her phone and walked to the kitchen, ignoring the buzzing completely.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel was glaring at his phone. How dare she ignore him?

Hadn’t she been so bold in her text earlier?

He rubbed his temples as he reread her message. Then he dialed Penelope.

She picked up after several rings.

"Na-Nathaniel?" Penelope’s voice was cautious. "What is it?"

His tone was sharp. "Penelope, was cutting off your credit card not enough? If it weren’t for your mother begging on her knees, you’d be in police custody right now."

Penelope stammered, "I-I haven’t done anything wrong!"

"Do you think I’m stupid?"

She trembled on the other end of the line.

"Evelyn just got lucky with that house demolition. It wasn’t even hers! It belonged to her adoptive parents. I had nothing to do with it!"

Her voice shook, but she sounded defiant.

Penelope truly believed she was innocent. The blame lay entirely with Beverly, Walter, and Cassandra.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Apologize to Evelyn. Now."

"No! Why should I? You’re still taking her side even though you’re divorcing her. Or have you actually fallen for her?"

His voice turned icy. "If you refuse, face the consequences."

"I won’t! You’ll have to drag me there yourself!"

Nathaniel hung up without another word.

He turned to Charles. "Look into the demolition issue where Evelyn used to live. Schedule a meeting with Geoffrey. I need to speak with him."

Charles nodded and left.

Nathaniel pulled out his phone again. It hit him then—Evelyn had blocked him.

Their last exchange had ended with a hundred-thousand-dollar transfer, and now his messages weren’t going through.

Finally, he typed, "I had nothing to do with what Penelope did."

She deserved to learn her lesson the hard way.

Evelyn had just finished dinner when she checked her phone. A smirk curled her lips at Nathaniel’s reply.

So that was his defense.

She grabbed her laptop, pulled up a video from her flash drive, and sent it to a notorious tabloid without hesitation.

"Interested in exclusive footage of a socialite’s wild night out?"

She attached a screenshot.

The reply was instant. "Absolutely."

Evelyn sent the video.

If Penelope wanted to play dirty, she’d play dirtier.

After three years of marriage, Evelyn knew all the Whitmore family secrets—especially Penelope’s. The girl was nothing but a reckless troublemaker.

In the past, Evelyn had cleaned up her messes out of obligation to Penelope’s mother.

Not anymore.
###Chapter 218

Evelyn knew all too well how quickly the Whitmores could cut ties. That’s why she kept her final trump card close—insurance against future attacks or schemes.

And she’d played it perfectly.

Once her task was done, she wiped the anonymous account clean and disposed of the flash drive. No traces left behind.

Nathaniel had given her that drive. After all, he’d tracked down IP addresses when she’d been targeted online before.

She’d asked him how to stay untraceable, and he’d handed her the drive without question, assuming she had a target in mind. The software inside would reroute any snoopers to a fake IP.

She hadn’t expected to use it so soon. Still, the thrill of deception sent a rush through her veins.

This time, Penelope would regret everything.

Evelyn would make sure she never dared touch her again.

As she finished, she noticed a refund notification—$100,000 returned. Had Nathaniel rejected the transfer?

Back when Beatrice had written that check to Walter and Beverly at their marital home, Evelyn had been furious. The last thing she wanted was to owe the Whitmores a single cent. So she’d sent the exact amount back to Nathaniel.

Why hadn’t he taken it?

She added him again, surprised when the request was instantly accepted.

Had he never blocked her?

She remembered his scolding call when she’d blocked him before. Yet here he was, leaving the door open.

She resent the money.

Would he refuse again? To him, $100,000 was pocket change.

She typed, "Take the payment."

Then she yawned, exhaustion pulling her under.

The next morning, her phone buzzed with a flood of missed calls.

She sat up and checked the headlines.

No surprise—Penelope’s name was everywhere.

"Whitmore Heiress Caught in Drug-Fueled Scandal!"

The story had exploded. Impossible to contain.

A smirk curled Evelyn’s lips.

Then, Penelope called again. This time, Evelyn answered.

"Good morning, Ms. Whitmore."

"Evelyn! Was this you? You’re the only one who knew!" Penelope’s shriek nearly shattered her eardrums.

Evelyn held the phone away, voice dripping with indifference. "I have no idea what you’re talking about."

"Stop lying! You think you can mess with me? I’m a Whitmore. My family will destroy you. Just wait—I’ll ruin you!"

Evelyn’s voice turned to ice. "I warned you. Cross me again, and you’ll regret it."

"You’re nothing! A nobody from the slums! Crushing you is like stepping on an ant. How dare you ambush me? I’ll make sure your whole family pays!"

Evelyn laughed.

"Go ahead. But if you push me, I’ve got another video. One where you’re completely naked. I’m sure the internet would love that."

Silence.

Then—click.

The line went dead.
###Chapter 219

Evelyn's piercing gaze remained fixed on her phone.

A moment later, Penelope's furious scream erupted from the other end.

"Evelyn, you conniving witch! I asked you repeatedly if you'd deleted all the videos, and you swore you had! Yet here you are, still holding onto your dirty little secret!"

"Of course I kept one," Evelyn replied coolly. "If you and your mother had treated me with even a shred of respect instead of ordering me around like a servant, I wouldn’t have needed insurance. Though, honestly, watching it makes me sick."

Penelope shrieked, her voice cracking with rage. "You vile creature! How dare you call me disgusting?"

"You, without a doubt. Or have you forgotten how quickly you stripped and threw yourself at those men the second the drugs hit?"

Evelyn’s words were deliberate, designed to provoke. Through the phone, she could hear the crash of objects hitting the floor, followed by Penelope’s incoherent screaming.

A smirk curled Evelyn’s lips. "Instead of wasting time yelling at me, maybe invest in a better PR team to clean up your mess."

She ended the call and blocked the number immediately. Penelope was nothing but a volatile fool with no self-control—the last thing Evelyn needed was her hysterics.

Then, a new notification flashed on her screen.

Nathaniel.

Her breath hitched as she read his single-word reply:

?

What was that supposed to mean?

Frowning, she typed back, "I assume a man of your resources has no trouble processing the payment?"

Nathaniel strode out of his bedroom, his expression dark.

Robert intercepted him in the living room, urgency sharp in his voice. "Mr. Whitmore, we have a situation. The stocks are plummeting."

He handed over a tablet displaying the breaking entertainment news—Penelope’s scandal dominating every headline.

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Damn it. Lock her down. No one takes another photo of her—ever."

"I’ve already spoken to Ms. Sinclair. She assured me Penelope won’t leave the house."

As Nathaniel loosened his tie, Evelyn’s earlier words echoed in his mind. "I’ll teach them a lesson."

Was this her doing?

He turned to Robert. "Get PR on this immediately. Mitigate the damage to the company at all costs."

"Understood. The team is assembling for an emergency strategy session. They’ll draft a statement within the hour."

Nathaniel sank onto the couch, pressing his fingers to his temples. Then, he dialed Evelyn.

She answered in a low, guarded tone. "Yes?"

"Do you really think a hundred thousand dollars is enough?"

Her pulse spiked. "Shouldn’t it be?"

She retreated to her bedroom, suspicion flaring. Was he trying to backtrack?

"The video you leaked just cost my company millions in stock value. So no, Evelyn, it’s not enough."

A beat of silence. Then, she laughed—cold, mocking.

"How is that my problem? Blame Penelope. She’s the one who couldn’t keep her clothes on."

"You held onto that footage for a year and released it at the worst possible moment." His voice turned lethal. "I underestimated you."

Her grip tightened on the phone. "And you still are. Because that clip? It’s just the beginning. I have more. Far more... graphic versions."

Nathaniel’s tone turned glacial. "Hand it over."

He didn’t care about Penelope’s reputation—but he would protect his company.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "No. This is my insurance. As long as she stays away from me, the rest stays buried."

"You do realize leaking this violates multiple laws?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Do you really think you can hide your tracks online?"
###Chapter 220



Evelyn pressed her lips together, her tone sharp. "If you're so confident, go ahead and dig deeper. Once you find something, come back and we'll talk terms."

Just then, Julian's voice carried through the door. "Evelyn?"

"Coming," she replied, swiftly ending the call.

On the other end, Nathaniel frowned. That voice—it sounded familiar. Too familiar.

Julian Montgomery. Victoria's brother.

Why was Julian with Evelyn this early in the morning? Had they spent the night together?

The thought twisted in Nathaniel's chest, an unsettling weight settling over him.

His expression darkened as he turned to Robert. "What's the status on the investigation into Evelyn's old neighborhood redevelopment?"

Robert blinked, confused. "Redevelopment? Oh, you mean the Eastside project?"

"Our company already settled with the residents. There shouldn't be any issues."

Nathaniel pinched the bridge of his nose, irritation flaring. "I meant Evelyn's old neighborhood. What are you even talking about?"

Robert swallowed nervously. "Mr. Coleman from Optima Construction mentioned someone from our company approached them."

"After looking into it, it seems to be someone from Ms. Penelope's team. So, this is likely tied to her."

Given Penelope's history of targeting Evelyn, the connection wasn't surprising.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Anything else?"

"Well, today's the scheduled signing day for the old neighborhood."

"The house owned by Ms. Evelyn and Ms. Margaret was claimed by her adoptive parents. They managed to sign ahead of everyone else," Robert explained.

Nathaniel stood abruptly, his voice clipped. "I'm heading there now."

Robert hesitated. "But the PR team is waiting for you regarding Ms. Penelope's situation—"

"If the PR department can't handle it without me, then what’s the point of them?" Nathaniel snapped.

With that, he grabbed his jacket and strode out.



Robert sighed. Was Nathaniel really rushing off to confront Evelyn again?

After ending the call, Evelyn stepped out of her room to find all six of her brothers gathered in the living room.

She raised an eyebrow. "Why are you all here?"

Alexander flashed her a grin. "We promised to back you up, didn’t we?"

For a moment, warmth flickered in her chest. It was comforting, having them stand with her.

After breakfast, they set off for the old neighborhood.

By the time they arrived, a crowd had already gathered outside.

Evelyn, flanked by her brothers and Margaret, walked into the courtyard, spotting familiar faces among the neighbors.

With six imposing men at her side, her presence was undeniable.

An elderly neighbor called out, "Evelyn, your adoptive parents are here too—over there."

Following the gesture, Evelyn spotted Walter and Beverly huddled in a corner, Cassandra lingering beside them.

At the sight of Evelyn and her brothers, Walter and Beverly paled.

Fear flickered in their eyes. They remembered how easily Evelyn had handled them last time. Now, with six men backing her, the threat felt ten times worse.

Cassandra, however, smirked and sauntered forward. "Evelyn, did you really need to bring an entire entourage? Are these all your exes?"

Her voice dripped with mock admiration. "I have to say, I'm impressed. Managing six men at once—you must have quite the talent."

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "You’ve got nerve showing up here. Haven’t you checked the news?"

Given the scandal surrounding Penelope, anyone with internet access knew the details.

Yet here Cassandra stood, bold as ever.

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened. "Or are you just that desperate?"
###Chapter 221

Evelyn couldn't help but admire Cassandra's sheer audacity.

Following Cassandra's words, Evelyn noticed something peculiar.

Cassandra seemed genuinely unaware of the gravity of her situation.

Through clenched teeth, Cassandra spat, "This is all your fault. Look what you've reduced me to."

Cassandra had long since drained her bank accounts, entangled herself in legal battles, and was now teetering on the edge of being blacklisted.

That very morning, her phone service had been cut off due to unpaid bills, leaving her stranded without calls or internet access.

And all of it—every last bit—was Evelyn's doing.

Cassandra scoffed, her voice dripping with venom. "Evelyn, I came here today just to watch you fall."

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. "Where did this vile woman crawl out from?"

Sebastian added coolly, "She's the one who spread those lies about Evelyn last time."

Nathaniel shot him a sharp look. "Wasn't this supposed to be handled?"

Hadn't the plan been to ensure Cassandra never resurfaced? How was she standing here now?

Andrew cleared his throat. "This is on me. I'll look into it."

Evelyn turned to her brothers, her voice steady. "It's fine. Let's focus on what's in front of us."

She knew exactly why Cassandra was still standing—Penelope had been pulling strings behind the scenes.

But after today, Penelope would lose all her leverage.

Cassandra was nothing but a desperate pawn, spouting empty threats.

With a haughty laugh, Cassandra sneered, "Evelyn, even with all these men around you, you won't win. The people backing me are untouchable."

She leaned in, her voice a whisper. "Soon, the money will go straight to your adoptive parents' account. And you? You'll get nothing."

Nathaniel's voice was ice. "Don't be so sure."

Overnight, he had orchestrated the takeover of Optima Construction. The new owner would assume control by morning.

Just then, representatives from Optima Construction arrived.

Cassandra immediately intercepted them. "Mr. Harrison, remember our agreement? Stick to the plan."

Oh, Evelyn wouldn't understand—not until it was too late. Cassandra was determined to show her the meaning of despair.

But Lawrence shoved Cassandra aside, his face grim. "Get out of my way."

He turned to his colleagues. "Optima Construction is bankrupt. Our salaries haven't been paid. We need to demand what's ours."

The news sent shockwaves through the crowd. The employees scattered, desperate for answers.

Bob and Beverly rushed forward, panic in their voices. "Wait! What about our money?"

Cassandra stood frozen. "Bankrupt? How?"

As word spread about the demolition project's cancellation, chaos erupted. People surged forward, searching for company officials—but they had vanished.

Evelyn spotted Margaret in the crowd and hurried after her, but the throng quickly separated them.

Outside, a sleek black car idled at the curb.

Nathaniel frowned as he watched the commotion. "What's happening?"

Robert took a call, then turned to him. "Optima Construction was acquired overnight. The redevelopment is off. These people are demanding answers."

"Acquired? By whom?"

"Vista Properties."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. Vista Properties was Alexander's company. Something wasn't right.

Were they targeting Evelyn?

"Investigate this," Nathaniel ordered coldly.

His gaze sharpened as he spotted Evelyn in the crowd, pushed aside and struggling to keep her balance.

Just as he moved to step out, he froze.

Evelyn was pulled into a man's arms—their embrace intimate, their closeness unmistakable.
###Chapter 222



Nathaniel rolled down the car window. His eyes darkened instantly when he spotted the couple locked in an embrace.

Robert, sitting beside him, blinked in surprise. "Isn't that Dr. Julian?"

"My vision is perfectly clear. I don’t need your commentary," Nathaniel snapped.

His fingers, which had been hovering near the door handle, slowly withdrew.

As Evelyn neared the neighborhood entrance, the chaotic crowd nearly sent her stumbling.

Her face drained of color in sheer panic.

Thankfully, Julian arrived just in time to steady her.

A stampede could have been disastrous for her pregnancy.

Still shaken, Julian scolded gently, "Evelyn, you can’t act recklessly like this, especially now!"

She gave him a sheepish grin. "I know. I saw Aunt Margaret rushing out and got worried. I didn’t expect such a mob."

"Evelyn, you have six brothers for a reason. Let us handle things like this next time," Julian reminded her.

He lightly tapped her forehead. "No more impulsive moves."

Nodding obediently, she walked with him toward the old neighborhood.

But then she paused, glancing back at the road with an inexplicable sense of unease.

Shaking it off, she followed Julian inside. Seeing Margaret safe, relief flooded through her.

Predictably, her brothers launched into another round of lecturing.

Margaret frowned in concern. "Even with Optima Construction bankrupt, will the demolition still happen?"

Alexander reassured her confidently, "Don’t worry. The redevelopment is proceeding as planned."

Evelyn, however, remained skeptical. This whole situation had always felt precarious.

Soon, a group of uniformed officials arrived, megaphone in hand.

"Good afternoon, everyone. We represent Vista Properties, the new acquiring company. Please line up to sign one by one. Let’s keep this process smooth for all."

A queue quickly formed.

Evelyn’s brows shot up. "Vista Properties? Seriously?"

Alexander cleared his throat pointedly. "Ahem, Evelyn, you should feel reassured. A corporation this large offers stability."

But she wasn’t comforted.



Vista Properties was part of Victoria’s eldest brother’s empire. What if this was another one of her schemes?

Evelyn wasn’t about to let her guard down.

Julian squeezed her shoulder. "Don’t overthink it. Alexander works there—he wouldn’t vouch for them if they weren’t reliable."

Evelyn bit back a sigh. How could she explain her complicated history with Nathaniel and Victoria to him?

For now, she’d have to play it by ear.

Cassandra, ever the opportunist, shoved Bob and Beverly forward. "These are the rightful owners. Let them sign first!"

Bob and Beverly nodded eagerly. "Yes, that’s right!"

But Maxwell, the officer in charge, shook his head. "I’m afraid you’re not the legal owners. Only the spouse listed on the deed has signing authority."

Bob scowled. "My brother Edward is in a coma! As his family, I have every right—"

"The property is under his wife’s name. Without her signature, you have no legal standing."

Beverly gasped, outraged. "This is ridiculous! She’s practically remarried! Why should she get the compensation?"

Just then, Evelyn and her six brothers approached, their presence commanding immediate silence.

The air grew thick with tension.
###Chapter 223

Evelyn glared at Beverly with icy determination. "Because the deed is in Aunt Margaret's name."

Beverly faltered, her eyes darting to Cassandra for support. "Ms. Blake, didn’t you say last time that we’re entitled to a share of the inheritance?"

"You’re an educated woman. Explain it to them."

Cassandra shrank back, intimidated by the bodyguards flanking Evelyn.

Despite Optima Construction’s recent collapse, Evelyn’s demolition project had been seamlessly taken over by Vista Properties.

Green with envy, Cassandra snapped, "That’s right. Mr. and Mrs. Simmons have every right to claim this property."

No matter what, she wouldn’t let Evelyn walk away with the new house and compensation. Why should Evelyn get everything while she got nothing?

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "But Uncle Benjamin is still alive. Aunt Margaret has been covering his medical bills all these years while he’s been hospitalized."

"She visits him regularly too. The compensation from this demolition will go toward his treatment."

The neighbors murmured in agreement. "This house belonged to Benjamin first. Walter has no right to contest it."

"The Simmonses have always been like this. At first, they didn’t care about the house—only the money."

"Yet Benjamin took the house without demanding a cent."

"Now that the old place is being demolished, they show up out of nowhere, demanding compensation. What kind of sense does that make?"

The crowd buzzed, unraveling the past.

Walter and Beverly exchanged guilty glances. The thought of losing even a fraction of the compensation was unbearable.

Desperate, Beverly wailed, "Do you know how much James borrowed from us for his treatment? He never paid it back!"

"This compensation belongs to us!"

Walter snarled, "If anyone tries to stop us, I’ll fight them right here!"

"I’ll make sure no one gets a single penny, even if it kills me!"

The couple erupted into a spectacle, causing chaos.

Cassandra lingered, stoking the flames, determined to halt the demolition.

Nathaniel exchanged a glance with Maxwell, who immediately understood.

Maxwell raised his voice. "If you have concerns, let’s discuss them at the office."

"Don’t hold up the others who are here to sign."

The neighbors chimed in. "Exactly, move aside!"

A group of sharply dressed men materialized, swiftly escorting Walter and Beverly away. Cassandra was dragged along with them.

Maxwell lifted the megaphone. "Everyone, continue lining up to sign. The compensation terms are even better now."

"Ask any questions here."

For a moment, no one moved, wary of being shortchanged.

But Margaret stepped forward. "I’ll sign first. Here’s my bank card."

She was determined to secure the money before Walter and Beverly could interfere.

Evelyn didn’t stop her. Instead, she double-checked the bank details.

Once the signing was done, Margaret clutched Evelyn’s hand. "Evelyn, is this enough? They can’t change anything now, can they?"

"No. Vista Properties has strict policies."

"Good."

Evelyn turned to her six brothers. "Let’s go. We’re done here."
###Chapter 224

Without the backing of Evelyn's six brothers today, Walter and Beverly would have displayed even more blatant arrogance.

Alexander's gaze settled on Evelyn as he remarked, "Vista Properties has an established protocol regarding redevelopment projects. Typically, those who sign first receive preferential treatment."

"Aside from the standard compensation, there may be additional incentives."

"Is that so?" Evelyn smiled faintly. "Whether there are or not, as long as my adoptive parents can't cause trouble, I'm satisfied."

Truthfully, she had her doubts—especially since Vista Properties was connected to Victoria and Alexander.

During their last encounter, Penelope had deliberately obstructed them. Would Victoria resort to similar underhanded tactics this time?

Alexander turned to her, his voice reassuring. "Evelyn, if you have any concerns, you can always confide in me."

"Alexander, do you think there's a chance Vista Properties might suddenly halt the demolition due to unforeseen issues?"

"Or perhaps manipulate the relocation records or bank details of those involved?"

"Evelyn, why would you think that? It's highly improbable. Vista Properties operates under strict regulations."

"Rest assured, I'll personally oversee this matter for you," he promised.

Evelyn fell silent for a moment before nodding. "Alright. Thank you, Alexander."

If Victoria did attempt anything behind the scenes, Evelyn wouldn’t let it slide.

Alexander's eyes flickered with confusion. Why was Evelyn so wary of Vista Properties acting covertly?

Her suspicion struck him as unusual.

After leaving, Evelyn received a call from Jonathan. "Evelyn, how did the redevelopment proceedings go?"

"Everything was settled smoothly. The paperwork is signed."

"Congratulations, my talented designer. Are you working late this afternoon? Would you like to visit the site and oversee the project you designed?"

"Of course. I'll head there right away."

Hanging up, she turned to her brothers. "I need to put in extra hours at the studio. I’ll be back in time for dinner."

Margaret smiled warmly. "Don’t worry. I’ll handle the groceries. Just focus on your work—but be punctual tonight."

Though Alexander considered suggesting dining out, he held back upon seeing Margaret finally at ease.

Beneath her gentle demeanor, she genuinely cared for their well-being. A quiet family dinner at home seemed far more fitting.

Julian stepped forward. "Evelyn, I’ll drive you. I need to head to Peace Hospital anyway."

She climbed into his car, and as they drove, he asked, "Evelyn, are you feeling any discomfort in your stomach?"

"No, Julian, you don’t need to worry so much."

"How can I not? There were so many people earlier. If I hadn’t arrived in time—do you realize what could have happened?"

Evelyn playfully stuck out her tongue. "I promise it won’t happen again."

Julian sighed, exasperated yet fond. "Where’s your studio? I’ll drop you off."

"It’s fine. I can take a cab. It’s not on the way to the hospital, and it’s quite a distance."

"I’m only going for a routine checkup. There’s no urgency."

Relenting, Evelyn input the wedding venue’s address into the navigation. An hour later, they arrived.

The scenery was breathtaking—like something out of a fairy tale, perfect for an outdoor wedding.

Julian surveyed the surroundings, a flicker of recognition crossing his features. Had he seen this place before?

"Finding a taxi here won’t be easy," he remarked. "How will you get back?"

"I’ll ride with Jonathan. With so many from the studio here, someone will have a car."

As Evelyn stepped out, she glanced up—and froze.

Not far away stood a familiar figure.
###Chapter 225

Evelyn turned when she recognized the familiar figure. "Julian, I need to focus on work now," she called out, waving at her brother.

Julian's gaze immediately locked onto the man standing nearby - Jonathan Reeves.

After scanning the area, Julian pulled out his phone, opening the photos Victoria had shared in their family group chat. "These are the engagement venue pictures."

"Brothers, share your suggestions. Don't forget - noon tomorrow."

As Julian studied the images, realization dawned. The location matched exactly where Evelyn stood.

Could Evelyn's work project be the same venue for Victoria's engagement?

What an unbelievable coincidence.

After brief consideration, Julian decided to inform Nathaniel immediately.

Evelyn followed Jonathan into the elaborately decorated space.

Seeing her designs come to life, Evelyn couldn't suppress a smile. "It's stunning."

"All thanks to your brilliant vision, Evelyn. The client is thrilled."

"These flowers are extraordinary. They must be imported - such vibrant colors aren't native to our region in this season."

Originally planning to use artificial blooms, Evelyn had ultimately chosen fresh flowers. The result surpassed all expectations.

"The client had them specially flown in from Nord City. But given their value, they'll only maintain freshness for two more days."

"The extravagance of the wealthy truly surpasses ordinary understanding," Jonathan remarked with a chuckle.

His eyes held a glimmer of envy mixed with hidden ambition.

Turning to Evelyn, he asked, "Do you like them?"

Evelyn admired the blossoms. "They're breathtaking."

Before she could say more, Jonathan produced an identical bouquet from beside him. "For the talented designer."

"When my studio expands, you'll have these flowers whenever you desire."

Their colleagues erupted in cheers. "Say yes! Say yes!"

Evelyn's expression froze mid-smile. Just as she prepared to clarify, movement caught her eye - was that Victoria entering?

Victoria strode in confidently, her stilettos clicking sharply as she surveyed the venue with a critical eye. "The setup is nearly perfect, though some minor adjustments are needed."

Jonathan immediately set down the bouquet. "Ms. Sinclair, our lead designer is here. We can make immediate modifications."

Seeing Victoria's smug expression, everything clicked for Evelyn.

Victoria had deliberately commissioned Evelyn to design her engagement venue.

Evelyn's eyes swept across the space she'd personally designed - the setting for her husband and his mistress's engagement. What cruel irony.

"Ms. Carter, I adore your design. Mr. Reeves, might I have a private word with Ms. Carter?"

"Of course. We'll continue our work over there."

Jonathan quickly ushered their colleagues away, leaving the two women alone.

Victoria approached with false sweetness. "I must thank you for designing my engagement venue. I'm certain it will be unforgettable."

Evelyn's fists clenched unconsciously, her gaze turning icy. "Playing this game again?"

Victoria's smile widened. "I trusted your design skills specifically for this occasion."

Evelyn smirked coldly. "If your goal was to disgust me, congratulations. It's positively nauseating."

"Now, now Ms. Carter. I'd hoped for your blessing on my wedding day."
###Chapter 226

"Would you prefer I curse your household with infertility and barrenness instead?" Evelyn countered.

"Victoria, enough of these childish games," she said sternly before turning away, making it clear she had no intention of lingering any longer.

"Evelyn, are you trying to sneak off? This reality must be too bitter for you to swallow, isn't it?"

"The flowers I brought here cost more than your annual salary. That’s the difference between us!"

Victoria’s taunt hung in the air.

Evelyn turned back, her gaze steady and unshaken.

"If you want me to continue with the design, fine. But aren’t you worried I might tamper with it and make you vanish without a trace?"

Victoria’s face twisted with unease.

With forced bravado, she snapped, "Evelyn, you wouldn’t dare! Just because you played dirty with Penelope doesn’t mean I’ll fall for the same tricks."

A wry smile curled Evelyn’s lips. "Go ahead, test me. If you won’t make this easy for me, then let’s make it difficult for everyone."

Gritting her teeth, Victoria hissed, "If you sabotage this, the studio will be held accountable! Besides, you didn’t even know it was my order until today. You wouldn’t risk your reputation."

Despite their feud, Evelyn still upheld her professionalism.

A cold smirk played on Evelyn’s lips. "Actually, I noticed a few safety concerns with the wedding design when I arrived. I was going to fix them."

"But since it’s your wedding, let’s leave it as it is. Walking blindly into disaster suits you perfectly."

Victoria’s face drained of color.

Without another word, Evelyn turned and strode away. If Victoria wanted to provoke her, she’d return the favor tenfold.

Tomorrow was Nathaniel and Victoria’s engagement ceremony.

It was too late to change the design now. Once Victoria saw the setup, she’d spend the entire night wondering where the hidden dangers lay.

Exhaling sharply, Evelyn quickened her pace. She pulled out her phone and sent a message to Jonathan:

"Jonathan, something urgent came up at home. I’m leaving early."

"The engagement venue is nearly done. You’ll oversee the final touches."

She had no interest in explaining her complicated history with Victoria to Jonathan.

But expecting her to stay and arrange the venue for that couple? Absolutely not.

Moments later, Jonathan called. "Evelyn, why the sudden leave? Is everything okay? Is it about the demolition?"

"Something like that," she replied vaguely.

Jonathan’s tone softened. "If it’s urgent, go handle it. I’ll take care of things here."

Relief washed over her. At least he didn’t press for details.

Explaining would have been awkward. The contract was already signed—backing out wasn’t an option.

As she stepped outside, a familiar car caught her eye.

Julian’s car?

He was still here?

Inside, Julian was wrapping up a call with Alexander. Spotting Evelyn, he quickly said, "Alexander, we’ll discuss this later. Evelyn’s leaving now. We’ll talk tonight."

Evelyn approached him. Perfect timing—she’d been dreading the struggle of finding a taxi in this area.

At least Julian hadn’t left yet.

Just then, Victoria’s voice rang out from behind.

"Evelyn, wait!"
###Chapter 227

Evelyn spun around at the sound of Victoria's voice. Sure enough, there she was, striding forward with purpose.

Was Victoria deliberately trying to cause a scene? Maybe she was bored and itching for drama?

But Evelyn wasn’t about to stick around and find out. Retreating was the smarter choice.

Without wasting a second, she dashed toward Julian, relief flooding her at the sight of him.

Julian’s pulse spiked as Evelyn approached. He hadn’t expected to get dragged into this mess.

Keeping Evelyn safe was his priority.

Now wasn’t the time for explanations.

In a flash, Evelyn slid into the passenger seat and urged, "Julian, let’s go!"

"Got it."

No questions asked, Julian hit the gas, speeding away before Victoria could react.

Victoria stood frozen, watching the car disappear. Had that really been Julian behind the wheel? Or was she seeing things?

The more she replayed the scene, the more certain she became—it was definitely him. No mistake.

But why was Julian with Evelyn?

The way Evelyn had slipped into his car so effortlessly… they clearly knew each other well.

A cold dread settled in Victoria’s stomach.

Since when had Evelyn gotten close to Julian?

Wasn’t she supposed to be Nathaniel’s little pet? Had Nathaniel introduced them?

Her hands trembled as she dialed Julian’s number. No answer.

As the distance between them and the scene grew, Julian exhaled in relief.

Thank goodness Evelyn had acted fast. If Victoria had cornered them, things could’ve gotten messy.

Side-eyeing Evelyn, he asked, "Why the rush to leave?"

Evelyn’s fingers twitched. She’d almost been caught.

If Victoria had gotten to her first, the truth about her connection to Nathaniel would’ve spilled.

With all six brothers home today, news of her expulsion from the Whitmore family would’ve spread like wildfire. And Alexander, with his temper, would’ve made a scene.

"Too close," Evelyn and Julian thought simultaneously.

Clearing her throat, Evelyn shrugged. "The decorations are pretty much done. They’ll handle the rest tonight."

"I just wanted to get home for dinner, so I left early."

A smooth lie.

Julian nodded, though suspicion lingered. "But when you ran out, it looked like someone was calling after you."

He wanted to dig into Evelyn’s relationship with Victoria.

Evelyn’s smile tightened. "You know how clients can be, Julian. Some are just… difficult."

"Besides, Jonathan’s there. Everything’s under control."

Julian wasn’t convinced. "Was that woman chasing you the client?"

"Yeah. High-maintenance and exhausting. Honestly, I couldn’t deal with her anymore."

The disdain in Evelyn’s voice was unmistakable.

Given Victoria’s two-faced nature, Julian had always suspected they wouldn’t get along. Now he had proof.

Unease kept him quiet. Pushing further might backfire.

Evelyn, too, was relieved when Julian dropped it. More questions would’ve meant more lies.

Her gaze flicked to his buzzing phone. "Julian, your phone won’t stop ringing. Aren’t you going to answer?"

He knew exactly who it was. "Probably the hospital. Nothing urgent. I told them I’d be late."
###Chapter 228



Evelyn gave a slight nod, and an unspoken agreement passed between them to drop the previous subject.

The view outside the window captured her attention - the wedding venue she had painstakingly designed now stood as a cruel irony of fate.

Tomorrow would mark Nathaniel and Victoria's engagement.

A bitter smile touched Evelyn's lips as she lowered her gaze.

She had known this day would come, yet its arrival left a hollow ache in her chest that surprised even her.

As Julian parked at the hospital entrance, he turned to her. "Wait here, Evelyn. I won't be long."

"No need, Julian. I should get back to the studio. Let's have an early dinner tonight though."

His concerned eyes studied her. "Don't overwork yourself," he cautioned.

Watching Julian enter Peace Hospital, Evelyn flagged down a cab and directed it toward the private medical center.

An inexplicable urge pulled her toward Eleanor's room.

With Nathaniel and Victoria's engagement this week and Eleanor's surgery scheduled for the next, at least Victoria's capable brothers could ensure Eleanor received proper care.

That small comfort was all Evelyn could cling to now.

Flowers in hand, Evelyn entered to find Eleanor absorbed in a book. "Grandmother," she greeted softly.

"Evelyn darling!" Eleanor's face lit up. "Come sit. It's been too long - has work been keeping you away?"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered downward. "The studio's been hectic, and my university courses aren't helping matters."

"Don't exhaust yourself, dear. With Nathaniel providing so well, you needn't carry such burdens. Especially now..." Eleanor's meaningful glance dropped to Evelyn's midsection.

Swallowing the lump in her throat, Evelyn forced a smile. "I'll be careful. How have you been feeling? Any discomfort?"

"Never better. It's your condition that worries me. Promise me you'll stop working at the studio when your second trimester begins."

Evelyn's hand instinctively cradled her stomach. "I promise."

Once her pregnancy became impossible to conceal, she planned to return to Nord City with her brothers.



There, far from Nathaniel's reach, she would bring her child into the world.

By then, Nathaniel and Victoria would be married, their lives too entangled to spare thoughts for Evelyn.

Their conversation flowed gently until the door swung open, bringing with it a draft of cool air.

Evelyn turned - and froze. Nathaniel's sudden appearance stole her breath.

Eleanor beamed. "Nathaniel! Here to collect your wife?"

Evelyn averted her gaze, but not before noticing the shoes Nathaniel wore - the custom-made pair she had selected for him years ago.

Simple, unbranded, yet crafted for comfort.

He'd worn them once, then never again. Evelyn had assumed their lack of status symbolism displeased him.

Yet here they were, gracing his feet once more.

Nathaniel's unpredictability confused her more each day.

He moved to stand beside her, his voice calm. "How are you today, Grandmother?"

"Wonderful now that I see you both. Nathaniel, no matter how busy, you must take care of Evelyn. She's carrying precious cargo!"

With that, Eleanor gathered their hands, pressing them together between her own.
###Chapter 229

Evelyn felt Nathaniel's fingers tighten around hers, sending an uncomfortable prickle down her spine.

She tried to subtly pull away, but Eleanor held their joined hands with surprising strength.

"If anything happens to me during this procedure," Eleanor murmured, her voice frail but resolute, "I need you both to look after each other."

Her gaze shifted between them, heavy with unspoken meaning. "With a child on the way, life won't be the same as before."

Evelyn's chest tightened. "Grandmother, you'll be fine. You have to see your great-grandchild born."

Eleanor's lips curved into a serene smile. "Yes, I will see this baby with my own eyes."

A lump formed in Evelyn's throat. Everyone believed her pregnancy was a ruse to convince Eleanor to undergo surgery—only she knew the truth.

Nathaniel's voice, low and steady, cut through her thoughts. "Grandmother, I'll take care of Evelyn and our child. You have nothing to worry about."

Evelyn nearly scoffed.

Wasn't he supposed to be engaged to Victoria tomorrow?

His words were nothing but hollow reassurance.

Eleanor glanced at the clock. "It's getting late. You two should go have dinner."

She waved a dismissive hand. "Hospital food is dreadful. No need to suffer through it with me."

Relief washed over Evelyn. If Eleanor had insisted they stay, she would've struggled to explain why she couldn't—her six brothers were waiting for her at home.

The moment Eleanor released her hand, Evelyn tried to pull away, but Nathaniel's grip remained firm.

Her jaw clenched, but she kept her expression neutral.

Once outside the room, she yanked her hand free. "Mr. Whitmore, she can't see us anymore. The act is over."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "I heard the demolition of your old neighborhood was finalized today."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Yes, Penelope went to great lengths for revenge."

A smirk played on her lips. "Though Optima Construction went bankrupt, it didn't stop my family from receiving compensation."

Nathaniel's mouth thinned. "You have quite the network. Always someone ready to help you."

Earlier, he'd seen Julian embracing Evelyn, their closeness undeniable. And during their last call, Julian's voice had been unmistakable in the background.

Wasn't she involved with Harrison?

Now another man?

Evelyn tilted her head, studying his tense grip. "Mr. Whitmore, are you... jealous?"

His expression stiffened.

He released her abruptly. "Don't flatter yourself. I'm just warning you—playing with multiple men is dangerous."

His voice turned icy. "Eventually, it'll blow up in your face. When they find out, you'll regret it."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "That's my business, not yours."

Nathaniel's gaze hardened. "Remember, our divorce isn't finalized yet."

He stepped closer, his voice a low warning. "After Grandmother's surgery next Monday, the one-month waiting period ends. Be on time."

Evelyn met his stare without flinching. "I'll be there."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, frustration flickering in his eyes. "And don't say anything before the surgery."

Evelyn laughed humorlessly. "You're getting engaged to another woman tomorrow, yet you have the nerve to tell me to keep quiet?"

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Do you think I enjoy being labeled the 'cheated-on wife'?"

She remembered Nathaniel and Victoria's engagement announcement—the opulence, the whispers, the way the elite circled like vultures.

When she had married Nathaniel, she'd signed a prenuptial agreement under Beatrice's glare, stripped of any claim to the Whitmore fortune.

Now, history was repeating itself.
###Chapter 230

People were truly worlds apart.

Nathaniel yanked at his tie in frustration. "Actually, my engagement with Victoria is—"

"Save it, Mr. Whitmore!" Evelyn cut him off sharply. "Someone like me has no right to question you, let alone listen to your explanations!" She turned on her heel and walked away before he could finish.

Tilting her head back, she blinked rapidly, refusing to let the tears fall.

Watching Evelyn retreat, Nathaniel slammed his fist against the wall. A sharp pain shot through him instantly.

When Robert saw blood seeping through Nathaniel's knuckles, he paled and immediately called for a nurse to clean and bandage the wound.

But one glance at Nathaniel's expression silenced him.

Was that… helplessness flickering in the usually composed and calculating man’s eyes?

Robert sighed inwardly. Ever since Nathaniel and Evelyn had agreed to divorce, chaos had become their new normal.

Just then, Nathaniel’s phone rang.

He answered without looking. "Yes?"

"Nathaniel, tomorrow’s your big day. Come home for dinner tonight. Victoria will be joining us—"

Beatrice’s words were cut off as Nathaniel ended the call abruptly. His gaze turned icy as he watched Evelyn climb into a taxi and disappear down the street.

Beatrice tried calling back several times, but Nathaniel ignored every attempt.

With an awkward smile, she turned to Victoria. "He must be swamped with work. You know how much the company relies on him."

Victoria’s smile tightened, but she kept her voice sweet. "It’s fine, Mrs. Harrington. I understand Nathaniel’s busy."

"You’re so understanding, dear. Still, you must stay for dinner. Weren’t your brothers supposed to arrive today?"

Victoria stiffened slightly. "They were, but their flight got delayed. I’ll pick them up after dinner."

"Why not ask Nathaniel to go with you later? Though, given his schedule, he might not be free. If that’s the case, I’d be happy to accompany you," Beatrice offered.

"That’s not necessary, Mrs. Harrington. It’s late, and you should rest. Tomorrow will be hectic."

Victoria quickly declined. She had just lied about her brothers’ delayed flight—if Beatrice came along, her deception would be exposed.

That afternoon, Victoria tried reaching out to Alexander, hoping to arrange a dinner with her brothers and Nathaniel.

But Alexander was occupied, Sebastian said he’d arrive the next day, and Julian didn’t answer her calls.

Victoria didn’t push further. Her time with the Montgomery family had always revolved around Eleanor, and her brothers had never shown her much warmth.

She knew she was just a placeholder for the real Montgomery heiress.

So she kept her head down, biding her time—until tomorrow, when she’d finally become Mrs. Whitmore.

Once she had that title, she wouldn’t need to care about the Montgomerys’ opinions or cater to Eleanor anymore.

Dinner was just Beatrice and Victoria.

Victoria was well aware that Beatrice’s affection stemmed solely from her status as the Montgomery heiress.

Midway through the meal, her phone rang. Seeing Alexander’s name, she excused herself eagerly. "It’s Alexander!"

She answered quickly. "Alexander, are you done with work?"

"Victoria, I meant to discuss this after your engagement tomorrow, but I think you should know now." His tone was unreadable.

"I’ve sent a document to your inbox. Review it, and let me know if you have any requests."

After hanging up, Victoria opened the file.

The title was stark and unmistakable: Termination of Adoption Agreement.
###Chapter 231

A cold shiver ran down Victoria's spine as she read the words on her phone screen.

"Termination of Adoption Agreement."

What did this mean?

Victoria's fingers trembled as she struggled to process the implications.

Why would Alexander want to dissolve her adoption now?

Beatrice noticed her sudden pallor and leaned forward. "Victoria, darling, are you all right? You look like you've seen a ghost."

Victoria quickly flipped her phone face down, forcing a weak smile.

"Just a bit of nausea. Must be something I ate earlier," she lied smoothly.

"Let Dr. Reynolds examine you. At least it's just an upset stomach. For a moment, I thought Nathaniel had said something to upset you."

"No, Nathaniel just texted that he's too busy for dinner tonight. He told me to rest early for tomorrow's engagement."

Clutching her phone, Victoria stood abruptly.

"Beatrice, excuse me—I need to visit the ladies' room. Please don't wait for me."

Once safely locked in the bathroom, Victoria collapsed onto the marble counter and reopened the document.

Her heart pounded as she reread each cruel line.

There was no mistake. The legal papers clearly stated the dissolution of her adoption into the Montgomery family.

Tears blurred her vision as she dialed Alexander's number.

"Alexander," her voice cracked. "Have I done something wrong? Why are you abandoning me now?"

"I've been a Montgomery since I was a child. If you cast me out, where will I go? Everyone will laugh at me!"

On the other end, Alexander sighed. "Victoria, this isn't punishment. Perhaps the mistake was mine—I never should have adopted a girl Evelyn's age as her replacement."

"You're an adult now, about to marry into the Whitmore family. Your future is secure. It's time to close this chapter."

After his earlier call with Julian, Alexander had decided to break the news before tomorrow's engagement.

The unexpected complication? Evelyn herself was designing Victoria and Nathaniel's engagement ceremony.

This meant Evelyn might attend tomorrow's event—a disastrous variable Alexander couldn't risk.

With Julian and Sebastian also attending, Alexander needed to prevent any identity revelations or confrontations.

Terminating Victoria's adoption now seemed the cleanest solution.

Victoria's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

"Alexander, please," she begged, voice thick with tears. "The Montgomerys are my only family. Even after marrying Nathaniel, I'll always be one of you!"

Alexander's resolve wavered at her distress, but thoughts of Evelyn's suffering hardened his heart.

"This isn't rejection," he said gently. "You'll always be welcome to visit."

"Then why now?" Victoria pressed. "Is this because of my marriage?"

Something didn't add up.

Her brothers' recent behavior had been... unusual.

During her stay in Bern City, Victoria had been carefully driving wedges between Nathaniel and Evelyn.

Her endgame? Their divorce—and her seamless transition into the Whitmore family.
###Chapter 232



After careful reflection, Victoria couldn't recall any missteps that might have provoked Alexander's displeasure.

What had driven him to suddenly revoke her adoption?

The thought left her reeling, struggling to piece together the logic behind it.

If the Montgomery family disowned her, she would be reduced to nothing—just another orphan.

How could she possibly secure a marriage into the prestigious Whitmore family then?

Beatrice's favor toward her was entirely contingent on the Montgomery name.

Losing that status was unthinkable. No matter what, she couldn’t let it slip through her fingers.

Alexander’s voice remained composed as he spoke. "Once you marry, you won’t need to stay home tending to Eleanor. You won’t have to bend over backward to please everyone anymore."

"It’s time for a fresh start."

Tears spilled down Victoria’s cheeks as she begged, "But Alexander, I don’t want to leave!"

"I know this is difficult for you," he replied evenly. "So I’ll give you time to adjust."

"Review the contract carefully. If you need anything else, let me know. I’ll do my best to accommodate you. That’s all for now."

The call ended, leaving Victoria staring at the document in front of her.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips, laced with something darker beneath the surface.

After years of enduring Eleanor’s whims, she refused to be discarded so easily.

Her engagement to Nathaniel was nothing but a farce.

Losing her place as the Montgomery heiress was unacceptable. She would never agree to these terms.

Without hesitation, she dialed Gregory. "Find out if Alexander has uncovered anything about my past. Figure out where the leak came from!"



Victoria had spent her entire life meticulously guarding her secrets.

Julian had stumbled upon the truth by accident, and ever since, his attitude toward her had shifted drastically—almost as if she were a stranger.

Yet even then, the worst consequence had been a stern reprimand from Alexander.

How could he possibly consider cutting ties over something so trivial?

There had to be more to this. Something she didn’t know.

Her thoughts spiraled into chaos, panic clawing at her as she stared at the damning document.

Then, a memory surfaced—that afternoon at the engagement venue. She had chased after Evelyn, only to see her slip into Julian’s car.

But Julian had been ignoring her calls for weeks, and now, reaching him seemed impossible.

If she pushed him too far, he might skip her engagement ceremony tomorrow, jeopardizing Eleanor’s surgery.

After a moment’s hesitation, she sent a message to Jonathan: "To ensure my wedding goes smoothly, I want the designer, Evelyn Carter, present at my engagement tomorrow."

She was determined to uncover the truth about Evelyn and Julian.

When Evelyn returned home, she pushed aside the lingering frustration from the hospital.

Stepping inside, she found all six of her brothers gathered in the living room.

The sofa wasn’t large enough to hold them all, forcing some to perch on dining chairs.

Meanwhile, Alexander stood on the balcony, deep in conversation on a call.

The sight made her smile. This was her new life—a home alive with warmth and noise.

Then Julian approached. "You got back before me. Where did you go?"
###Chapter 233

Evelyn paused for a moment, struggling to explain her delayed return. She couldn't possibly mention her secret visit to the private clinic to see Eleanor.

Keeping her expression neutral, Evelyn answered, "The roads were packed tonight. Maybe I should've taken the metro instead of hailing a cab."

"Taxis are safer," Julian insisted. "At least you get to sit down even in traffic. The subway's always overcrowded - who knows if you'd find a seat? What if someone bumped into you?"

His protective tone betrayed his knowledge - as the only family member aware of Evelyn's pregnancy.

Understanding his unspoken concern, Evelyn nodded. She knew she needed to be more careful in her condition.

Their eyes met in silent understanding across the dinner table.

After finishing their meal, Evelyn felt a warm contentment settle over her. These family moments had become precious to her.

With a baby coming, she imagined their home growing even livelier soon.

Once everything here was settled, she planned to return to Northridge City for the delivery and raise her child there.

Mid-conversation, Evelyn suddenly yawned. Lately, fatigue hit her without warning.

Noticing her exhaustion, Julian immediately stood. "It's getting late. We should all turn in."

His priority was making sure his pregnant sister got proper rest.

The six brothers left together, still needing to discuss Victoria-related matters they'd avoided mentioning earlier.

As the front door closed, quiet returned to the living room.

Margaret gently squeezed Evelyn's hand. "When the compensation comes, dear, you must save it properly."

"But Aunt Margaret, this is your money. I can't accept it. Besides, Uncle Benjamin needs funds for his-"

"Your brothers have covered Benjamin's medical bills for a decade, haven't they? Take this money - invest it wisely or put it in a fixed deposit."

Margaret sighed. "Honestly, I'm overwhelmed handling such an amount. My relatives already heard about the compensation - they keep calling, demanding family reunions."

Evelyn knew exactly what kind of people Margaret's relatives were.

When Benjamin had his accident years ago, they'd refused to help financially. Instead, they'd advised Margaret to sell the house and divorce him.

In short, they were vultures waiting to swoop in.

"Alright, I'll safeguard it for you. Whenever you need anything, just ask." Though accepting the money, Evelyn already planned to use it for Margaret's retirement.

Later in bed, Evelyn absentmindedly touched her abdomen. Was that the slightest swell she felt?

Her phone buzzed - Jonathan calling.

Remembering how she'd slipped away earlier, guilt prickled as she answered. "Jonathan? Just getting off work?"

"Yeah, we've been swamped all day. Just grabbed dinner."

"With the wedding tomorrow, there are a million last-minute details to confirm. Can't afford any delays," he explained.

Evelyn's guilt deepened. "I'm sorry I wasn't there to help today."

"Don't worry about it. Family comes first - we totally understand."

"By the way, word got around the office that you're becoming our resident millionaire with that neighborhood compensation."

"Don't forget to treat us all!" Jonathan teased lightly.

Evelyn laughed helplessly. "Of course."

"Oh, and Evelyn - now that your family's relocation is settled, you should come by tomorrow to check the engagement venue setup," Jonathan added.

Why would he want her there?

Evelyn didn't need to guess who'd put him up to this request. It had Victoria's fingerprints all over it - shamelessly demanding Evelyn's presence at her own wedding venue.

Did Victoria really think Evelyn had no say in these preparations?

"Evelyn? You will come, won't you?" Jonathan pressed.

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn replied, "Jonathan, I'm sure you've done a perfect job with the arrangements. Tomorrow I'll just be at the studio as scheduled."
###Chapter 234

"No, Evelyn, you're the lead designer for this event. Your presence is essential to supervise the engagement venue."

Jonathan's voice was firm through the phone.

"Besides, Ms. Sinclair specifically requested to thank you in person."

"You have to come. Otherwise, we won't be able to manage things properly on our end," he insisted.

Evelyn bit her lip, scrambling for an excuse—but nothing came to mind.

"Evelyn," Jonathan pressed, "have you met Ms. Sinclair before? Or is there some kind of history between you two?"

"No," she lied quickly. "I don’t know her."

She had no intention of dredging up the past. Not when it could unravel everything she’d built since then.

With a reluctant sigh, she gave in. "Fine. I’ll go to the venue tomorrow and oversee the setup."

"Good. Just make sure you’re there early. Don’t be late." Jonathan’s tone softened slightly. "Get some rest."

The moment the call ended, Evelyn’s grip on her phone tightened.

Victoria.

That scheming, manipulative—

Of course she was doing this on purpose. That was the only reason Jonathan had been so insistent.

If Evelyn refused, it would raise questions. But attending? Watching her ex-husband pledge his future to her, in a venue she designed?

The thought alone made her stomach twist.

Needing an outlet, she opened a social media app and typed:

"Wedding designer here. Just got assigned to my ex-husband’s engagement—to the woman he left me for. Now she’s demanding I attend tomorrow. Can’t refuse without risking my job. What do I do? Desperate for advice!"

She hit post, expecting nothing.

Within minutes, the replies flooded in.



"Bring a ‘gift.’ Something memorable. Like a funeral wreath."

"Oh honey, this is evil. I love it. Update us!"

"Honestly? Show up looking flawless and pretend you don’t care. That’ll hurt them more than anything."

Evelyn’s lips curved at one particularly upvoted suggestion.

Funeral wreath.

The venue was already decked in flowers. A few white chrysanthemums wouldn’t look out of place.

She immediately placed an order—wreath included.

If Victoria wanted a spectacle, Evelyn would give her one.

If she couldn’t have peace, neither would they.

Her hand drifted to her stomach. Then, with a deep breath, she turned off the lights and forced herself to sleep.

The next morning, Evelyn woke before dawn, nerves humming.

For the first time in her life, she was about to do something wild.

Margaret was already in the living room when Evelyn emerged. "You’re up early," she remarked.

"Work," Evelyn said simply, avoiding further explanation.

As she left, she called the florist to confirm the "gift" would arrive precisely during the ceremony’s climax.

She knew the schedule by heart. She’d designed it, after all.

Now, she had nothing left to lose.

Checking her work group chat, she saw the team already buzzing with updates from the venue.



Then, as she stepped out of her building—

Walter and Beverly stood blocking her path.

"Evelyn," Walter snarled. "You’re not going anywhere until you hand over that money."
###Chapter 235



The moment Evelyn Carter spotted Walter and Beverly Simmons, she knew escaping wouldn't be easy.

Still, she remained composed. Vista Properties held Margaret Dawson's banking details. No matter how much Walter and Beverly made a scene, the outcome wouldn't change.

Evelyn quickly typed a message to Jonathan Reeves: "Ran into my adoptive parents. Will be delayed."

At the engagement venue, Jonathan's brow creased as he read the text.

He'd always sensed Evelyn's family dynamics were complicated—especially with Walter and Beverly's toxic tendencies.

If Evelyn was going to be in his future, he'd ensure she set firm boundaries with them—and even Margaret. The only relatives worth maintaining ties with were her brothers.

Jonathan had zero interest in dealing with Walter and Beverly.

"Understood. Handle it quickly and get here ASAP. Everyone's waiting," he replied.

Victoria Sinclair had explicitly requested the designer's presence. Jonathan had promised her. If Evelyn didn't show, it would reflect poorly on his studio's professionalism.

Jonathan reviewed the venue details again, determined to impress Victoria. Losing future opportunities wasn't an option—not when this event united the Sinclair and Whitmore heirs.

Soon, Victoria arrived, her gaze sweeping over the romantic décor. It was exactly as she'd envisioned.

As much as Evelyn irritated her, Victoria couldn't deny the brilliance of her designs.

"Where's the designer?" Victoria asked, smirking.



She'd specifically arranged for Evelyn to witness her engagement to Nathaniel Whitmore—to show her what a real power couple looked like.

As the Sinclair heiress, Victoria knew Evelyn—an orphan—could never compare.

Jonathan adopted a placating tone. "Ms. Sinclair, Evelyn is handling an urgent matter. She'll be here shortly."

Victoria's expression darkened. "Is this how your studio operates? She left early yesterday, and now she's late for my engagement?"

Was Evelyn deliberately avoiding this?

Jonathan explained, "Ms. Sinclair, Evelyn's adoptive parents are causing trouble. They're demanding a share of her relocation compensation."

Victoria's eyes narrowed. "She got the compensation?"

Hadn't Penelope Whitmore manipulated Optima Construction to divert funds to Walter and Beverly?

Yet according to Jonathan, Evelyn had secured the money.

"Yes. There were complications. Optima was acquired—by Alexander Montgomery's Vista Properties. After the takeover, Evelyn received her dues."

"Alexander's company bought the original developer?"

"It's common for conglomerates to absorb smaller firms," Jonathan clarified.

Victoria's instincts prickled.

No matter how vast Alexander's empire was, randomly acquiring a small Bern City developer seemed unlikely.

And during the scandal involving Evelyn, the conglomerate that bankrupted Reginald Stewart's company was also Vista Properties.

Once could be coincidence. Twice? Suspicious.

"Regardless," Victoria said coldly, "ensure Evelyn arrives on time. Otherwise, your studio's reputation will suffer."

She added, "And I see no need to feature this event in your portfolio."

Jonathan stiffened. "Understood, Ms. Sinclair. She'll be here."
###Chapter 236



"Fine, that works." Victoria's voice was icy as she turned on her heel and walked away.

If Evelyn didn’t show up to her engagement ceremony, Victoria’s triumph would feel hollow.

With all her brothers present, it was the perfect chance to rub Evelyn’s face in their vastly different lives.

After a few steps, Victoria snapped at Gregory, "Find out why Alexander suddenly decided to acquire Optima Construction."

Gregory hesitated before answering. "It’s probably just a coincidence."

"Mr. Montgomery has been planning to expand into Bern City for a while now. Preparations are already underway."

Victoria mulled over the explanation. It made sense.

Yet, unease prickled at her. Something felt off—too convenient.

Gregory added, "Actually, this could benefit us. Since the demolition compensation hasn’t been paid yet, there’s plenty we can manipulate."

A smirk curled Victoria’s lips. "You’re right. Handle it for me."

She was determined to make sure Evelyn never lived comfortably. Victoria wanted her to suffer—destitute and miserable at the bottom of society forever.

Just then, her phone rang. Her face lit up. "Alexander, you’re here? I’ll come greet you."

She hurried to the front gates, where a sleek black luxury car rolled to a stop.

Three men stepped out, and Victoria’s excitement bubbled over. It was rare for all her brothers to be together.

Their presence at her engagement meant they still saw her as family. Otherwise, why bother coming?

Tears welled in her eyes. "Alexander, Sebastian, Julian—thank you for being here."



"Let’s rest in the main hall first. The ceremony will be in the garden out back. We’ll walk there shortly."

Alexander gave a curt nod.

Once seated inside, he motioned to Charles. "Bring out the documents." His gaze locked onto Victoria. "About our earlier discussion—have you reconsidered?"

Victoria’s eyes dropped to the paper in his hand. "Termination of Adoption Agreement."

Her face drained of color. She’d hoped delaying the conversation would make it disappear. After all, Eleanor still needed her, didn’t she?

She never expected Alexander to present the document so bluntly—and with such finality.

Pasting on a pitiful expression, she whispered, "Alexander, today’s my engagement. Must we do this now?"

After the ceremony, she planned to return to Nord City. There, she’d prove how indispensable she was to Eleanor. Maybe then, Alexander would reconsider.

His eyes narrowed. "Victoria, I made myself clear last night. If you’re unhappy with the compensation terms, propose your own."

Julian’s gaze was sharp. "You’re marrying Nathaniel and becoming the lady of the house. Money shouldn’t be an issue."

"Alexander’s been more than generous with you all these years."

Victoria forced a smile. "I’m grateful for his kindness. That’s why I consider myself a Montgomery. But marriage shouldn’t mean being cast aside, right?"

She couldn’t understand this sudden decision.

Her biological sister, Evelyn, had suffered for years—yet Alexander was cutting her off instead.

At the very least, he wanted Victoria out of the family before Evelyn discovered the truth.

Alexander pushed the document toward her. "Sign it."

Victoria scanned the pages. "Alexander, tell me—why now?"
###Chapter 237

Victoria Sinclair had no intention of signing those papers.

In her heart, she had always considered herself the true heiress of the Montgomery family. Her engagement to Nathaniel Whitmore was solely due to her status within the family.

She refused to let go of that privilege under any circumstances.

Alexander Montgomery's lips thinned. "There's no hidden reason behind this. It's simply time to finalize your adoption termination, as per our original agreement."

Before Victoria could respond, Gregory Thornton hurried in. "Ms. Sinclair, the Whitmore family has arrived."

Victoria's expression darkened. She quickly handed the document to Gregory and turned to Alexander with pleading eyes. "Alexander, can we discuss this after the engagement ceremony?"

Alexander gave a curt nod. "Of course, Victoria. But regarding this matter, only the compensation terms are negotiable. The rest is non-negotiable."

Victoria's fists clenched. Did this mean she would be forced to sign no matter what?

But why?

After years of dedication and countless contributions to the Montgomery family, why were they discarding her now?

Julian Montgomery's voice was ice-cold. "Victoria, you've benefited enough from our family all these years. We owe you nothing."

With their biological sister Evelyn Carter found after years of suffering, the Montgomerys were determined to welcome her home properly.

They wouldn't tolerate anyone mistreating Evelyn.

Therefore, Victoria couldn't remain part of the family.

Especially now that she was about to marry Nathaniel and secure her future as a Whitmore.

Victoria remained silent, signaling Gregory to discreetly hide the document.

Just then, the Whitmores entered the grand hall.

Victoria instantly composed herself. "Mrs. Whitmore, you're here."

As she spoke, she cast a hopeful glance at Nathaniel beside her.

If today's engagement went smoothly, she would soon become a Whitmore.

Nathaniel remained impassive, his gaze sweeping across the three Montgomery brothers before settling on Julian.

He remembered that morning when he'd called Evelyn and heard Julian's voice in the background.

That detail had haunted him ever since.

Penelope Whitmore's eyes widened at the sight of the handsome Montgomery brothers. Alexander might be married, but Sebastian and Julian were still eligible bachelors.

Marrying either would be perfect.

Beatrice Harrington took Victoria's hand with a smile. "Why still call me Mrs. Whitmore? It's time to change that."

Victoria smiled shyly, though her eyes lacked warmth.

Penelope chimed in, "Victoria, we're practically family now. When does the ceremony start? You haven't begun preparing yet. Will you have enough time?"

"I was waiting for all of you to help me. After all, I don't have any close female friends or relatives here in Bern City."

Beatrice waved dismissively. "Don't worry, we'll help. Let's go."

Victoria nodded and turned to Alexander. "Alexander, I'll take them upstairs to prepare."

"Fine."

Alexander nodded, shooting Nathaniel a disapproving glare.

According to Julian, Nathaniel had ulterior motives toward Evelyn.

Soon, only four men remained in the hall.

Three against one—the mutual hostility was palpable.

Julian broke the silence. "Mr. Whitmore, after today's engagement, you should stay away from other women."

Certainly, Nathaniel mustn't harbor feelings for Evelyn! As a divorced man entering a second marriage, he had no right to her.

Nathaniel recognized the threat in Julian's words but questioned his authority to make such demands.
###Chapter 238

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Julian. "What exactly is your relationship with Evelyn?"

A cold smirk played on Julian's lips. "That's none of your business. But mark my words - she's off limits to you. Stay away!"

The Montgomery brothers had decided confrontation was necessary. Better to lay all cards on the table now.

The air in the grand hall turned thick with tension.

Nathaniel straightened his cufflinks. "Dr. Montgomery, you overstep. Grandmother Eleanor entrusted Evelyn's care to me. Her affairs are my responsibility."

Alexander's fist clenched at the sheer audacity. Nathaniel was already engaged to Victoria! The man wanted to have his cake and eat it too?

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable, his posture rigid with defiance.

Alexander saw red. In one swift motion, he grabbed Nathaniel's collar and shoved him against the wall. "Take that back or I'll put you through this goddamn wall!"

How dare Nathaniel openly declare his intentions toward Evelyn after everything?

Nathaniel's eyes burned with challenge. "I won't retract a word."

Julian's voice cut through like ice. "Do you honestly think you're worthy of Evelyn? I initially refused to operate on Eleanor Whitmore."

He stepped closer, his disdain palpable. "I don't waste my skills on those I despise - and you top that list. But Evelyn begged me. That's the only reason I agreed."

Nathaniel staggered as if struck. His voice came out raw. "Evelyn... pleaded with you?"

"Exactly." Julian's smile was razor-sharp. "Only for Evelyn's sake did I consent. Eleanor showed her kindness once - I repay debts."

Nathaniel's world tilted. His knees nearly buckled as the truth slammed into him.

All this time, he'd believed it was Victoria's influence...

Not Evelyn's silent sacrifice.

"Why..." His throat worked. "Why wouldn't she tell me?"



Julian watched Nathaniel's crumbling composure with grim satisfaction. "Perhaps she knew you'd react like this - proving once more you don't deserve her."

He delivered the final blow. "Stay away from Evelyn, Nathaniel. Or should I remind you who holds Eleanor's life in his hands?"

Nathaniel's hands trembled. "I can't make that promise."

"Your choice." Julian shrugged. "But remember - one word from me, and Eleanor's surgery gets delayed indefinitely. How long do you think her heart can wait?"

Alexander barked a laugh. "Every time Evelyn suffers, a Whitmore is involved. If you truly cared, you'd disappear from her life permanently."

The words hit like bullets. Nathaniel had no defense - each accusation was painfully accurate.

Slowly, he raised his eyes to the three Montgomery brothers standing united against him. The battle lines had been drawn.
###Chapter 239



Nathaniel's voice thundered through the grand hall, sharp with fury. "What the hell is that look in your eyes?"

Sebastian said nothing. His jaw clenched as he turned on his heel and strode away, his movements stiff and uncoordinated.

The tension in the room thickened.

Julian watched Sebastian's retreat, his brow furrowing. Something about Sebastian's reaction felt... off.

Had he missed something crucial?

Alexander's voice cut through the silence. "Nathaniel, it seems Victoria has lied to us again."

Julian exhaled sharply. "I never thought she'd have the audacity to fabricate something like this to Sebastian. This isn't the first time she's shamelessly deceived us."

Sebastian's reaction suggested a pattern—Victoria had been manipulating the Whitmore family for far too long.

Now, Julian couldn't help but wonder—did Sebastian actually have feelings for Victoria?

Rubbing his temples, Nathaniel spoke firmly. "I know. I'll settle Victoria's identity issue before Evelyn returns. I won't let her suffer any injustice."

Sebastian added, "Evelyn is the designer for this engagement ceremony. She'll be here soon. We need to figure out how to explain this to her."

Julian's lips twisted wryly. "This is... complicated. Nathaniel, as the eldest, this falls on you. You've got this."

Nathaniel shot him a glare. "I've noticed Evelyn gets along well with you. Why don't you handle it?"

Despite their years of navigating life's challenges, the three brothers hesitated.

Exchanging glances, they all wished they could vanish into the shadows. How were they supposed to explain this to Evelyn?

Meanwhile—

Upstairs, in the lavish dressing room, Victoria stood before the mirror, draped in a dazzling white wedding gown.



A smug smile curled her lips as she admired her reflection. The day she had waited for—the day she would finally secure her place as Mrs. Whitmore—had arrived.

In her mind, this engagement meant Evelyn no longer had a place in the Whitmore family.

Penelope, standing beside her, couldn't help but gush. "Victoria, you look absolutely breathtaking."

"Thank you," Victoria replied smoothly. "Every woman shines brightest in a wedding gown. Your turn will come soon enough."

Penelope's eyes gleamed with excitement. "Victoria, does Sebastian have a girlfriend?"

After some digging, she'd discovered Sebastian was a rising star in the tech world—a self-made entrepreneur with limitless potential.

That revelation had solidified her preference for him over Julian, the doctor.

Victoria arched a brow. "From what I know, he doesn't. Sebastian is a workaholic—always buried in his projects."

"Victoria, since we're about to be family, wouldn't it be wonderful if we grew closer? Maybe you could arrange for me to meet him?"

Victoria suppressed a scoff. Did Penelope really think she was worthy of someone like Sebastian?

Keeping her disdain hidden, Victoria smiled sweetly. "Of course. I'll introduce you after the engagement."

"Victoria, thank you—or should I call you sister now?"

Victoria's smile deepened. "By the way, Penelope, have you heard about the demolition issues in Evelyn's old neighborhood?"

Penelope groaned. "Ugh, don't remind me. Because of that mess, my mother nearly disowned me. She's been keeping me locked up at home, convinced I need to 'ward off bad luck.'"

"It took so much begging just to get her to let me come today."

"She's ridiculously superstitious—thinks I need to stay indoors for days to avoid 'negative energy.' That's why she couldn't make it."

Victoria nodded sympathetically. "It's understandable. She just cares about your well-being."
###Chapter 240



"What? Victoria, aren't you worried Evelyn might sabotage the engagement?"

Victoria's lips curled into a frosty smile. "She wouldn't dare. This venue carries her studio's reputation. Any mishap would ruin not just her career, but her entire team."

"I see. Actually, Victoria... Why don't we have Evelyn personally handle your train? Let that scheming wretch witness the difference between you two."

Penelope was practically salivating at the thought of humiliating Evelyn.

Ever since that incident, Penelope's social standing had taken a hit. Though the Whitmores claimed the leaked footage was doctored, society's elite knew the truth.

All because of Evelyn Carter!

Victoria's smirk widened. "Fine. Handle it yourself later - just don't disrupt the ceremony."

"Don't worry, darling. I'll make sure Evelyn regrets ever crossing us. You just enjoy the show."

As they descended the grand staircase, Victoria froze.

The main hall stood eerily empty.

Where were Nathaniel and her brothers?

Beatrice offered a placating smile. "They're probably discussing business outside, dear. Let's proceed to the garden pavilion."

Victoria forced a nod, though her eyelid kept twitching inexplicably.

When they reached the floral archway with no sign of Nathaniel or her brothers, panic clawed at Victoria's throat.

Noticing her distress, Beatrice volunteered, "I'll call Nathaniel to locate them."

Once alone, Victoria turned to Jonathan. "Has Ms. Carter arrived?"

Jonathan approached hesitantly. "Apologies, Ms. Sinclair. She's en route."

"En route?" Victoria's voice turned glacial. "The lead designer missing her own project? Is this your studio's standard?"

"I'll contact her immediately." Jonathan dialed with trembling fingers before paling. "Her phone's... switched off."

Penelope scoffed. "How convenient. The coward probably chickened out."

Victoria's mood darkened further. Spinning around, she found her brothers still absent.

She speed-dialed Alexander. "The ceremony starts in twenty minutes. Where are you?"

"On our way." Alexander exchanged grim looks with Sebastian and Julian. "No avoiding this now."

Julian rubbed his temples. "Maybe just you go? I'm... not feeling well."

What if Evelyn never forgave him?

"Don't be ridiculous. We face this together." Alexander marched forward like a condemned man.

Yet when they arrived, Evelyn was nowhere in sight.

Alexander scanned the crowd anxiously. Had she really abandoned them?

Victoria's saccharine voice interrupted. "Looking for someone, brother dear?"

Julian quickly deflected. "Shouldn't the groom be here by now?"
###Chapter 241

Victoria's face darkened at the question.

"Mrs. Whitmore went to find Nathaniel," she answered. An inexplicable dread settled in her stomach.

Beatrice returned moments later, confusion written across her features. "How strange. Nathaniel isn't answering his phone, and Robert isn't responding either."

Penelope blurted out, "On such a crucial day, do you think Nathaniel might be getting cold feet about the wedding?"

The words "cold feet" made Victoria visibly tense.

Her fingers trembled as she dialed Nathaniel's number, only to be met with endless ringing. A wave of panic crashed over her.

"That's impossible. Nathaniel was right here minutes ago. He wouldn't just leave without explanation. Something must have happened."

Beatrice attempted to ease the tension. "I'm sure Nathaniel's just caught up in something urgent. He was with me not long ago."

Penelope, realizing her gaffe, quickly added, "Yes, Nathaniel's been swamped lately. Probably some last-minute business delay. Should we wait a bit longer?"

Victoria forced a smile. "Please, everyone take your seats. I need to freshen up my makeup."

Excusing herself, Victoria pulled Gregory aside. "Find Nathaniel immediately. This venue isn't that large."

"Right away, miss."

Victoria stood frozen in place, her left eyelid twitching uncontrollably.

Alexander approached with a frown. "Where's Nathaniel?"

"I've sent Gregory to look for him. Given the venue's size, we should have news soon."

Alexander's frown deepened.

"But this is your engagement day. No matter how busy Nathaniel is, disappearing without explanation is unacceptable," he snapped.

"Alexander, Nathaniel has important responsibilities. I understand his position," Victoria countered.

He sighed. "If that's how you feel, I won't interfere."

Alexander couldn't fathom why Victoria tolerated Nathaniel's behavior.

Unbeknownst to her, Nathaniel still carried a torch for Evelyn.

Returning to his seat, Alexander whispered to Julian, "Where's Evelyn? Why haven't I seen her?"

"I'll check."

Julian spotted Jonathan Reeves, Evelyn's studio manager who was also attending.

Approaching him, Julian asked, "Jonathan, might I have a word?"

"Of course."

Jonathan was puzzled. Wasn't Julian Evelyn's brother? Why was he here at Victoria's engagement, seated with the family?

"Has Evelyn not arrived?" Julian inquired.

"She was supposed to be here hours ago. I've tried calling and messaging, but her phone's completely dead now," Jonathan replied, irritation evident.

Evelyn's absence as lead designer was causing professional embarrassment.

Julian immediately tried Evelyn's number, confirming it was switched off.

Something was wrong. Evelyn never turned off her phone.

"Did Evelyn mention any issues this morning?" Julian pressed.

"Initially yes. She texted about a minor delay but promised to arrive soon. That was hours ago with no update since."

Julian's unease grew. Evelyn wouldn't vanish without reason.

Frowning, he asked, "What exactly did Evelyn say about the delay earlier?"
###Chapter 242

"She said she encountered her adoptive parents and would be running late."

"Adoptive parents?"

Julian's brow furrowed instantly. Walter and Beverly Simmons had an uncanny talent for stirring up trouble, always reappearing to disturb Evelyn's peace.

Jonathan cleared his throat nervously. "There's something I've been meaning to ask since earlier."

Julian turned his sharp gaze toward him. "What is it?"

"I mean no offense. It's just... seeing all of you at the engagement ceremony surprised me. Are you somehow related to Ms. Sinclair? Evelyn never mentioned any connection."

When Evelyn had interacted with Victoria earlier, her demeanor had been frosty - nothing like the warmth one might expect between relatives.

Julian's fingers tapped impatiently against his armrest as realization dawned. They'd nearly forgotten this crucial detail.

Originally, they'd assumed Evelyn would attend today's event, making concealment unnecessary.

But with her unexpected absence, the situation had become complicated.

"We're distant relatives," Julian offered with forced casualness.

Jonathan nodded slowly. "Considering the importance of Ms. Sinclair's engagement, it's unusual her family hasn't made an appearance."

"Engagements aren't as significant as weddings. Times have changed."

"I suppose you're right."

Jonathan didn't press further, acknowledging his limited understanding of aristocratic family dynamics.

Yet the revelation about Evelyn's connection to the prestigious Sinclair family of Nord City shocked him profoundly.

No wonder Victoria had insisted on Evelyn designing the wedding venue from the beginning.

There had been hidden connections all along!



Clearly, Evelyn harbored secrets. Jonathan would need to work harder to earn her trust.

Julian returned to his seat with a stormy expression. "Evelyn still hasn't arrived. According to Jonathan, she ran into her adoptive parents this morning."

Alexander's face darkened. "I just tried calling her. Her phone's switched off. What if those people did something to her?"

The three men, already uneasy about contacting Evelyn directly, now regretted their restraint.

None had anticipated her absence.

Julian shifted restlessly. "We can't just wait here. Let's go investigate. We shouldn't underestimate those despicable people."

Alexander stood abruptly. "I've instructed Olivia to check the surveillance footage from Evelyn's residence. We'll know exactly what happened."

As one, the three men rose to leave.

Victoria rushed in, blocking their path. "Alexander, Sebastian, Julian - where are you going?"

Alexander met her gaze coolly. "Where's Nathaniel?"

Victoria's face tightened. "I reviewed the footage. He simply walked out of the main hall and left."

Julian scoffed. "Clearly demonstrating his lack of responsibility."

Victoria's fists clenched. "Julian, I demand to know what you said to him. Why would he leave without a word?"

Since Nathaniel had shown up today, she'd believed him committed to their arrangement.

His sudden departure baffled her, especially as he continued ignoring her calls.

Julian shrugged. "Our conversation was simple. I advised him to remain faithful to you and stay away from other women."

"If he chooses otherwise, he'll regret it."

Should Nathaniel dare approach Evelyn again, consequences would follow.

Victoria's expression softened slightly. "Perhaps Nathaniel had urgent business..."



With visible disappointment, Alexander interjected, "No need to wait. We have pressing matters. We're leaving."

Victoria's face drained of color. "Alexander! What could possibly be more important than my engagement?"
###Chapter 243

Victoria couldn't fathom why Nathaniel had abandoned her. Now even her brothers were turning their backs on her.

They were supposed to be her family. On the most important day of her life, what could possibly matter more than her?

Nathaniel's absence was bad enough, but having her brothers stay might have salvaged some dignity from this disaster.

Now? She'd be the laughingstock of high society.

She clenched her teeth, waiting for Evelyn's arrival. This time, she wouldn't hold back.

Alexander's voice cut through her thoughts. "Victoria, with Nathaniel gone, this engagement is meaningless. We should call it off."

The word "cancel" sent ice through her veins.

"No!" The denial tore from her throat. "We'll proceed as planned. Nathaniel had urgent business, that's all."

Hadn't Evelyn married into the Whitmore family when Nathaniel was comatose? Why should she accept less?

Julian's lips curled in disdain. "How long will you keep lying to yourself, Victoria? Do you actually believe Nathaniel wants this marriage?"

Her nails bit into her palms. "What are you suggesting? Of course he wants to marry me! Why else would we be here?"

Something in Julian's tone set off alarms in her mind.

"Wasn't his proposal contingent on my agreement to operate on Eleanor Whitmore?"

Victoria's blood ran cold. He knew.

She forced a brittle smile. "Whether Nathaniel loves me is my concern. I love him. In time, he'll—"

"Lies have consequences," Julian interrupted. "Have you considered what happens when the truth comes out?"

"I haven't lied!" Her voice rose sharply. "You agreed to the surgery too. When did I ever deceive Nathaniel?"



The unspoken truth hovered between them.

Should he tell her he'd only agreed because of Evelyn? That revelation would raise dangerous questions about Evelyn's identity.

With Evelyn absent today, that particular Pandora's box would remain closed.

Julian remained silent.

Alexander checked his phone, his expression darkening. "We need to leave."

Olivia's message had come through. Their surveillance team had located Evelyn.

Every second counted now.

Victoria blocked their path. "What could possibly be more important than this?"

"Company emergency," Alexander lied smoothly.

As her brothers walked away, a cold dread settled in Victoria's chest.

This was supposed to be her day. Why was everyone abandoning her?

The contract Alexander had given her earlier burned in her mind. They thought they could discard her so easily?

After years as the Montgomery heiress, she wouldn't be cast aside.

She'd fight tooth and nail to keep her position.

Penelope's voice broke through her thoughts. "Victoria, why did your brothers leave?"

She smoothed her expression. "Urgent business at Montgomery Enterprises."

"And Nathaniel? Work couldn't wait?"

Penelope's skepticism was obvious. "On your engagement day? What could possibly be more important?"
###Chapter 244

Victoria's face tightened for a split second before Beatrice smoothly intervened. "If Nathaniel needs to focus on his career, so be it. The engagement will proceed as scheduled."

At this, Victoria forced a strained smile. "Mrs. Whitmore, please accept my sincerest apologies."

"Nonsense, dear. It's my son who should be apologizing for his poor timing." Beatrice patted Victoria's hand reassuringly.

Victoria's lips curved upward, though her eyes remained icy. "Work commitments are understandable."

Internally, she seethed but knew canceling the engagement wasn't an option.

Penelope seized the moment to ask, "Victoria, where's Evelyn? Wasn't she supposed to attend today?"

Victoria whirled toward Jonathan, her voice sharp. "Where is she? What happened?"

Jonathan frowned. "Her phone's switched off. We can't reach her. I'm concerned there might be trouble with her adoptive family again."

Penelope smirked. "Perhaps she's too ashamed to show her face. Given how things are unfolding, I wouldn't blame her for hiding."

"Who said I was hiding?"

All heads turned as Evelyn strode in, her hair slightly disheveled and a fresh cut at the corner of her lip.

She'd just had a violent confrontation with Walter and Beverly outside her apartment. Their shouting match had escalated into a physical altercation on the sidewalk, culminating with her phone being crushed underfoot.

Ignoring the sting from her injury, Evelyn addressed Jonathan first. "Any issues with the venue?"

"Everything's proceeding without complications," Jonathan assured her.

Evelyn turned to Victoria with a challenging look. "See? No problems whatsoever."

Victoria's lips thinned. "The ceremony hasn't even started. How would you know if there are problems?"

"Then let's begin," Evelyn declared coolly.

A hush fell over the gathering.

Noticing Victoria's murderous expression, Evelyn scanned the room. "According to the schedule, we're running late. Why the delay?"

The atmosphere was undeniably strange. Not only had the ceremony not started, but Evelyn also noted Nathaniel's conspicuous absence.

Her eyes narrowed. "Where's the groom?"

Victoria's grip on her bouquet tightened. "Nathaniel had urgent business. The engagement will continue without him."

Beatrice chimed in with false cheer. "Exactly! His absence changes nothing. When two powerful families unite, that's what truly matters."

Evelyn's gaze drifted to the conspicuously empty seats. "And the bride's family? Did none of them bother to come?"

Penelope rushed to explain. "Victoria's brothers had prior commitments."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "No groom. No family. At this rate, people might think you and Beatrice are the ones getting engaged."

Victoria's face darkened with rage.

Penelope stepped between them. "Don't listen to her, Victoria. Some people are just bitter because they'll never have what you do."

Evelyn smirked. "Speaking of bitter, I see you've regained your confidence. Must be nice to have selective memory about certain... indiscretions."

Penelope's face flushed crimson. She hated when anyone referenced that incident, especially Evelyn!

Before anyone could react, Penelope lunged forward, hand raised. "I've been waiting to slap that smug look off your face!"
###Chapter 245



Evelyn didn't even flinch. Did Penelope really think she was still the same pushover from before?

In one swift motion, Evelyn grabbed Penelope's wrist and flipped her over her shoulder, sending the woman crashing onto the marble floor.

The tight pencil skirt Penelope wore rode up dramatically, revealing far more than she intended—including the scandalous lace thong she had chosen to wear that day.

Tsking in mock disapproval, Evelyn remarked, "No safety shorts? Just a thong? My, my, Ms. Whitmore, you certainly know how to keep things interesting."

Penelope shrieked, her face burning with humiliation. "Evelyn, I swear I'll ruin you!"

Seeing the situation escalate, Victoria quickly turned to her security team. "Clear the room immediately. Confiscate any phones and make sure no one records this."

As Nathaniel's fiancée, Victoria couldn't afford to let Penelope's disgrace reflect poorly on her. Any scandal involving the Whitmore family would tarnish her own reputation by association.

Nearby, Jonathan looked like he wanted to intervene, but the burly bodyguards swiftly ushered him out before he could utter a word.

Standing outside, Jonathan clenched his fists in frustration. He should have greeted Evelyn earlier.

A studio colleague whispered, "Mr. Reeves, Evelyn just humiliated Ms. Whitmore in front of everyone. Doesn't she realize the consequences?"

Jonathan had been too stunned to react at first.

But then again, if Evelyn's brothers had ties to the Montgomery family, this might just be high-society drama. Maybe he didn’t need to worry.

It also made him wonder—just how powerful was Evelyn's family?

How else could she stand up to Victoria and Penelope so fearlessly?

By now, the engagement venue had nearly emptied.

Evelyn briefly considered snapping a few photos for leverage, only to remember her shattered phone.



Penelope scrambled to her feet, her face twisted in fury. "Victoria, order your guards to restrain Evelyn! I'm going to make her pay!"

Victoria feigned concern. "Ms. Carter, since you instigated this, an apology would be wise. Otherwise, this won’t end well for you. Ms. Whitmore is very upset."

Evelyn smirked. "Forgotten what I have on you, Penelope? Try laying a finger on me and see what happens."

Penelope paled, her rage momentarily checked. "You're vile."

"Takes one to know one," Evelyn shot back, relishing the way Penelope seethed.

Beatrice scoffed. "If she won’t touch you, I will. What dirt could you possibly have on me?"

Penelope’s eyes gleamed. "Exactly! If we strip her down and take some compromising shots, she’ll have nothing left to threaten us with!"

Evelyn tensed as the bodyguards advanced. She needed an exit—fast. If she could reach Jonathan outside, she’d be safe.

"Enough."

A voice, cold as steel, cut through the chaos.

Nathaniel stepped forward, his presence commanding silence. His sharp gaze locked onto Evelyn, something unreadable flickering in his eyes.

For a brief moment, their eyes met—before Evelyn quickly looked away.

Victoria brightened instantly, rushing to his side. "Nathaniel! I thought you had urgent business. Is everything settled?"
###Chapter 246

Evelyn was completely unprepared for Nathaniel's sudden reappearance.

His polished Oxfords came to an abrupt stop on the marble floor. Those piercing gray eyes locked onto her with unsettling intensity. "Release me," he ordered in that deep baritone that always sent shivers down her spine.

Flushing slightly, Evelyn immediately dropped his arm. "Nathaniel, the engagement ceremony has already begun. We should—"

Beatrice cut in sharply, "Yes, we've delayed long enough. Any more tardiness would be unforgivable."

"Evelyn, contact your brothers immediately," Nathaniel commanded unexpectedly. "See if they can join us for the celebration."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she dialed Alexander's number. No answer.

She quickly typed out a WhatsApp message, though she doubted he'd respond. Not that it mattered now—Nathaniel was here.

Penelope's shrill voice cut through the tension. "Wait just a minute! Did Evelyn just attack me? Nathaniel darling, you arrived just in time to witness your wife's violent outburst!"

Evelyn didn't bother denying it, standing silently with her chin lifted in defiance.

After a charged pause, Nathaniel stepped forward until his shadow fell over Evelyn, the scent of his expensive cologne enveloping her.

"Care to explain?" His voice was deceptively calm.

"What's there to explain?" Evelyn met his gaze head-on. "You never believe me anyway. Why waste my breath?"

For the first time in three years, she thought she saw something different in his eyes—not the usual contempt, but something resembling... concern?

Nathaniel studied her with an unreadable expression, his mind clearly wrestling with some internal conflict. The revelation that Evelyn had persuaded Julian to operate on Eleanor had shaken him to his core.

Yet she'd never mentioned it.

The thought of Evelyn's closeness with Julian sent an inexplicable pang through his chest—like sand slipping through his fingers.

"Evelyn," he said quietly, "it seems I've never truly known you."

Her laugh was bitter. "The feeling is mutual. So spare me your sudden epiphany."

Penelope couldn't resist interjecting. "Evelyn, Nathaniel asked you a question. Stop evading!"

Evelyn turned to face her squarely. "Yes, I hit her. Happy now?"

"See? She admits it!" Penelope crowed triumphantly.

Evelyn held Nathaniel's gaze, bracing for the familiar condemnation. Instead, he turned that icy glare on Penelope.

"Apologize," he demanded.

Penelope blinked. "Me? Why on earth would I—"

"To your sister-in-law," Nathaniel clarified, his voice dropping dangerously. "Show some respect. Who gave you permission to address her so informally?"

The collective gasp in the room was almost comical.

Evelyn stared at Nathaniel in utter disbelief. Was he forgetting this was his engagement day? How could he say such things in front of Victoria?

Right on cue, Victoria burst into tears. "Nathaniel!"

Beatrice stepped forward, her voice sharp with warning. "If Evelyn is her sister-in-law, then what does that make Victoria?"
###Chapter 247

The moment Beatrice Harrington spoke, Evelyn Carter was struck by the same unsettling thought.

Wasn't today supposed to be Nathaniel Whitmore's engagement?

His comment to Penelope Whitmore—calling Evelyn her sister—left her utterly confused. Had he lost his mind?

Couldn't he see how close Victoria Sinclair was to tears?

Dressed in a pristine white gown, Victoria looked every bit the blushing bride, ethereal and radiant. Was Nathaniel blind to her beauty?

As Evelyn's thoughts spiraled, she noticed Nathaniel striding toward her. She tilted her head back to meet his gaze, her neck straining from the effort.

Good Lord, he was tall.

Nathaniel stopped in front of her, his sharp eyes locked onto hers.

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably under his intense scrutiny.

What was wrong with him?

Why was he staring at her like that?

Beatrice, relentless as ever, pressed on. "Nathaniel, are you going to answer my question?"

Nathaniel's brows furrowed in irritation. "Why would any other woman matter to me?"

"Nathaniel!"

Victoria lifted her veil, her voice trembling. "Nathaniel, today is our engagement. Have you forgotten?"

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin, cold line.

Evelyn stole a glance at Victoria, a pang of recognition hitting her. She, too, had once been dismissed so carelessly by Nathaniel.

Clearing her throat, Evelyn spoke up. "Mr. Whitmore, your fiancée—Ms. Sinclair—is speaking to you. Can't you hear her?"

Nathaniel scowled. "She's not my fiancée."

Evelyn scoffed. "You don't owe me an explanation. I was the one who designed this engagement venue, after all. May the two of you have a lifetime of happiness."

She took a deliberate step back. "Oh, and don’t forget—once Grandma Eleanor’s surgery is over at the end of the month, we still have that courthouse appointment. It’s long overdue."

Without another word, Evelyn turned and walked away. She had no intention of staying a second longer.

Nathaniel watched her retreating figure, frustration knotting in his chest. He didn’t know how to make her stay.

"Nathaniel, why are you so concerned about Evelyn? Today is your engagement!" Beatrice snapped.

She wanted Evelyn gone—far away from Nathaniel’s thoughts.

Nathaniel stood frozen for a moment before finally turning to Victoria, his gaze icy.

Victoria had been smiling, but as his eyes met hers, her expression stiffened. "Nathaniel, you look upset. What’s wrong?"

"Nathaniel, how dare you look unhappy?" Beatrice interjected. "Victoria waited for you all this time, and she didn’t even—"

Nathaniel cut her off, his voice sharp. "Let me ask you again, Victoria. Did you convince Julian to perform the surgery on Grandma?"

Victoria’s face paled. "Of course it was me. Who else could have done it?"

For a fleeting second, doubt flickered in her mind, but she quickly dismissed it.

She was a Sinclair. Why wouldn’t Julian agree to the surgery for her sake?

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened as he recalled Evelyn’s earlier words. She hadn’t protested, hadn’t fought—just reminded him of their pending divorce.

Evelyn was ruthless.

Straightening his tie, Nathaniel delivered his verdict. "The engagement is off."

Victoria’s face drained of color. "W-What? Why?"

Beatrice gasped. "Nathaniel, you can’t just call it off!"
###Chapter 248

Nathaniel's expression was like ice, his piercing gaze locked onto Victoria. "You know exactly what you did, Victoria. For Julian's sake, I'll let it go this time."

Without another word, he turned sharply and strode away.

Victoria refused to let it end like this. She hurried after him, her voice trembling. "Nathaniel, I don’t understand what you mean. I didn’t manipulate anything!"

"I only asked Julian to perform the surgery for Eleanor. There’s nothing wrong with that!"

Nathaniel halted abruptly, his eyes turning glacial. "Julian told me otherwise," he countered.

Victoria froze, panic surging through her. What did Nathaniel mean by that?

Had Julian revealed that his decision to operate wasn’t influenced by her?

That would explain why the main hall had been empty when she returned after changing.

Had Nathaniel and Julian spoken during that time?

Victoria couldn’t piece it together. If Julian hadn’t agreed because of her, then why had he taken the case?

It made no sense!

Beatrice rushed over, her face lined with concern. "Victoria, I’m so sorry. I’ll speak to Nathaniel when we get home. Please don’t worry—this engagement means everything to me."

Victoria forced a smile. "Mrs. Whitmore, I’ll go change first."

As much as she wanted to marry Nathaniel, being publicly rejected stung. She was, after all, the heiress of the Sinclair family.

Still, a flicker of relief passed through her.

Alexander had mentioned that if she married Nathaniel, she’d have to sign papers severing her adoption ties.

With the engagement called off, perhaps she could delay that fate a little longer.

A shadow crossed Victoria’s eyes. She would get to the bottom of this.

Everything had seemed perfect—until this sudden twist.



Evelyn glanced at Jonathan, her voice quiet. "Jonathan, let’s go."

"Evelyn, are you okay? I was really worried about you earlier."

"I’m fine," she said, forcing a smile. "But it looks like this design order is ruined. I’ll cover the losses."

"Evelyn, don’t say that. Our studio is a team. We handle setbacks together—we won’t let you take the fall alone."

Jonathan glanced back at the unfolding scene. "But are we leaving now? Won’t the engagement continue?"

"Whether it does or not isn’t our concern. Jonathan, there’s something I haven’t told you."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Ms. Sinclair and I have history. She deliberately chose me to design this event."

Jonathan’s suspicions were confirmed. Evelyn had to be connected to the Sinclairs. Otherwise, how could she clash with Victoria and walk away unharmed?

He smiled gently. "I had a feeling, but I didn’t press since you didn’t seem ready to talk."

"No worries. If you want to leave, I’ll have everyone pack up."

"I’m so sorry, Jonathan."

As Evelyn helped dismantle the setup, a heavy sadness settled over her.

This was her fault. The studio was paying the price.

While organizing supplies, a sharp pain shot through her ankle. She stumbled—

"Evelyn!"

"Watch out!"

Two men lunged toward her at once—
###Chapter 249

Evelyn instinctively tensed, preparing for impact that never came.

Strong hands caught her from both sides, preventing what could have been a disastrous tumble.

A cold dread washed over her. The thought of harming the precious life within her made her stomach churn.

Realizing how reckless she'd been confronting Walter and Beverly, Evelyn mentally chastised herself.

She tried pulling free, but both men maintained their firm grip.

The air grew thick with unspoken tension.

After a silent exchange between Nathaniel and Jonathan, they finally released her. Smoothing her dress, Evelyn murmured, "Thank you."

Jonathan flashed his trademark grin. "Don't mention it. Workplace injuries are terrible for our insurance premiums."

Evelyn's lips quirked despite herself. "Wouldn't want to bankrupt the studio with my clumsiness."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he watched their easy banter, his gaze turning glacial when it landed on Jonathan.

Noticing Nathaniel's expression, Jonathan added, "Mr. Whitmore, we appreciate your assistance today."

Nathaniel nearly choked on his own breath. Since when did this outsider get to thank him for helping his own wife?

Evelyn quickly intervened. "Yes, Mr. Whitmore, your quick reflexes were most appreciated."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "That's all?"

Surely she had more to say?

Evelyn hesitated before offering, "My deepest gratitude?"

Nathaniel's patience snapped. "Evelyn, are you seriously going to let this engagement proceed without comment? Nothing at all?"

Hadn't she personally designed the entire venue?

This was some performance indeed!

Now she couldn't even pretend to care? Was she that eager to see him with another woman?

Meeting Nathaniel's intense gaze, Evelyn felt a confusing mix of emotions she couldn't - wouldn't - decipher.

She lowered her lashes. "Actually, there is one thing."

Nathaniel stilled, waiting.

"If you're satisfied with the engagement venue design, please ensure timely payment of the final installment. We accept Venmo transfers."

The words hung in the suddenly frigid air.

Nathaniel's face turned stormy. In all his years, no woman had ever provoked him like this.

Evelyn Carter had just made history.

Collecting her things, Evelyn turned to leave.

Jonathan, ever the peacemaker, added, "Congratulations on your engagement, Mr. Whitmore."

"Get out!" Nathaniel's control was hanging by a thread.

Not risking further provocation, Jonathan made a hasty exit.

Without looking back, Evelyn departed with the rest of the studio team.

Back at her workstation, Evelyn tried to focus on her sketches, assuming the engagement festivities must be concluding by now.

An unexpected sting behind her eyelids made her blink rapidly.

Checking the time, she informed Jonathan, "I need to replace my phone. I'm heading out now."

"Let me drive you. I'm wrapping up here too."

"Everyone worked hard today - let's cancel the team dinner and reconvene tomorrow."

"Really, Jonathan. I'll take a cab. You've been burning the midnight oil all week - get some rest."

Jonathan persisted, "I'm fine, Evelyn. With those facial injuries, I'd feel better seeing you home safely."

The concern in his voice was unmistakable.
###Chapter 250

Evelyn's conscience weighed heavily on her after the engagement incident, making it impossible to refuse Jonathan's offer.

But as she stepped outside, her breath caught at the sight of a familiar Volkswagen parked nearby.

"Alexander?" she murmured in surprise.

The car screeched to a stop, and Julian stepped out, striding toward her with urgency. "Evelyn, are you alright?"

"Julian?"

For a brief moment, Evelyn had thought it was Alexander—only to realize it was her third brother instead.

Her response came out stilted. "Julian, I'm fine."

"Your phone's been off all day! We were worried sick!"

Guilt twisted in her chest. "It broke accidentally, and I haven't had time to fix it."

Jonathan chimed in smoothly, "Evelyn was tied up at the engagement venue. We just got back to the studio."

Julian's brow furrowed. "Evelyn, did you actually make it to the ceremony? When did you arrive?"

"I got there early. It ended hours ago. Why, Julian?"

Julian shot Jonathan a wary glance before shifting gears. "Never mind. Evelyn, I'm taking you home. Get in the car."

He avoided elaborating in front of Jonathan, not wanting to risk revealing anything.

Evelyn turned to Jonathan. "Julian's here, so you don't need to worry about me. You should rest."

"Alright. Take care."

Jonathan let the opportunity slip—but he wasn't concerned. There would be plenty more chances.

Sinking into the passenger seat, Evelyn exhaled heavily. "Today has been exhausting."

"Evelyn, what happened to your face?"

While driving, Julian quickly typed a message in the family group chat: Found Evelyn. Bringing her home now.

Setting his phone down, the tension in his shoulders eased slightly.

The Montgomery brothers had scoured the city searching for her.

Security footage had shown a confrontation between Evelyn, Walter, and Beverly, drawing a crowd before she boarded a bus—vanishing afterward.

Evelyn touched her cheek lightly. "This morning, my adoptive parents ambushed me at the neighborhood entrance."

"When they realized they weren't eligible for relocation compensation, they lost it—demanded money."

"I refused. Things got heated, but I held my ground."

Though Julian had already seen the footage, hearing her recount it so casually unsettled him. "Evelyn, you're pregnant. Did you forget?"

"I know I messed up. I was just... too angry to think straight. But I kept my promise, didn't I?"

At a red light, Julian turned to her, voice thick with concern. "I'm not scolding you. I'm just worried."

He understood—her past had shaped her into someone fiercely independent, reluctant to rely on others.

Even now, with her brothers in her life, she still hesitated to lean on them fully.

When trouble struck, she faced it alone.

Evelyn stuck out her tongue playfully. "I know. So, Julian... help me pick a new phone?"

He drove toward the largest electronics store, intent on getting her the latest model.

But as they entered, Evelyn froze.

A familiar figure stood across the store.

For a second, she wondered if her eyes were playing tricks on her.
###Chapter 251



Evelyn hadn’t expected to run into Nathaniel here.

He stood by the display counter, holding a phone that looked distinctly feminine.

Who was he buying it for?

Victoria, perhaps?

It made sense—after all, Nathaniel had just gotten engaged to Victoria earlier that day.

Evelyn quickly looked away, pretending she hadn’t noticed him.

Julian, however, spotted Nathaniel immediately, his brows furrowing in displeasure. He’d heard rumors that Nathaniel had called off the engagement.

Now, seeing him here, Julian’s suspicions seemed confirmed.

Given Nathaniel’s obvious lack of affection for Victoria, it was likely the engagement had been nothing more than a transaction—one tied to Eleanor’s surgery.

Still, Julian couldn’t shake his dislike for the man, especially knowing Nathaniel’s lingering interest in Evelyn.

A protective instinct flared within him.

"Evelyn," he said casually, "what do you think of this brand’s latest model?"

Evelyn barely glanced at the phone. "It’s fine."

She just wanted to get out of here as quickly as possible.

Julian turned to the sales associate. "We’ll take this one."

The associate hesitated. "I’ll need to check our inventory. This model sells out fast."

Out of the corner of her eye, Evelyn caught Nathaniel’s gaze. She pressed her lips together, refusing to acknowledge him.

Julian noticed too. Without hesitation, he stepped between them, deliberately blocking Nathaniel’s line of sight.

Then, with a subtle shift of his stance, he made sure Nathaniel couldn’t see Evelyn at all.



Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed slightly, irritation flickering across his expression.

There was something unusual about Evelyn’s relationship with Julian.

Was this why Julian had agreed to perform Eleanor’s surgery? Had Evelyn known all along about Victoria’s deception?

Had she orchestrated the engagement venue just to witness his humiliation firsthand?

The more Nathaniel thought about it, the more unsettled he became.

The last thing he’d expected was to stumble upon Evelyn’s broken phone—or to end up in this exact store.

Just then, the sales associate returned. "I’m sorry, but we only have one unit of this phone left."

Julian grinned. "Perfect. We’ll take it."

The associate hesitated again, glancing at Nathaniel. "Actually, that last unit is currently in that gentleman’s hands. We’re not sure if he intends to purchase it."

Julian’s gaze sharpened as he took in the phone Nathaniel was holding.

Without hesitation, he strode forward. "Nathaniel, let’s make this simple. We’ll take the phone. Evelyn’s is broken, and she needs a replacement."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened as he looked at Evelyn.

After a tense pause, he replied, "I was here first."

Julian scoffed. Was Nathaniel really this oblivious?

Even after Julian had made it clear he was doing this for Evelyn—even after agreeing to perform Eleanor’s surgery as a favor—Nathaniel couldn’t extend this small courtesy?

Evelyn cleared her throat and tugged Julian’s sleeve. "Forget it. We can choose another brand. The older model is fine."

"No," Julian insisted. "If we’re buying, we’re getting the latest."

This was the first time he was buying Evelyn a phone, and he refused to settle for anything less than the best.

Hearing his stubborn tone, Evelyn felt a wave of exhaustion. She just wanted to leave.

Gently, she squeezed Julian’s arm and whispered, "I’ll love anything you choose."

And it was true—any gift from Julian would mean the world to her.
###Chapter 252

Evelyn's words washed over Nathaniel like a soothing balm. His shoulders relaxed as he marveled at her thoughtfulness.

She was perfect - kind, intelligent, and utterly enchanting in ways that made his chest tighten.

Julian Montgomery's protective instincts flared. He'd be damned if any man, particularly a divorced older gentleman like Nathaniel Whitmore, dared to pursue his sister.

This potential connection between Evelyn and Nathaniel needed to be severed before it could blossom.

Nathaniel couldn't help but overhear Evelyn's affectionate tone with Julian. The sweetness in her voice sent an unfamiliar pang through him.

When had she ever spoken to him with such warmth?

An odd constriction gripped his chest, making each breath feel laborious. This sensation was entirely new and unsettling.

With sudden decision, Nathaniel slammed the phone onto the counter. "I've changed my mind," he declared coldly.

Regret flooded him instantly. Coming to this store had been a mistake from the beginning.

Before Nathaniel could react further, Julian snatched up the device. "Thanks for your generosity, Whitmore," he said with a patronizing pat to Nathaniel's shoulder.

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. He didn't want nor need Julian's gratitude.

His gaze tracked Julian's movement as the younger man presented the phone to Evelyn. She accepted it hesitantly, her fingers curling around the device that still carried Nathaniel's residual warmth.

Her lips pressed into a thoughtful line as she studied the phone.

Julian, ever attentive, noticed her hesitation. "Something wrong, Evie? Don't you like it?"

"It's fine," she murmured. "This one will do."

Truthfully, Evelyn had minimal requirements for a phone. Any decent model would suffice.

She lifted her head casually, scanning the store - only to lock eyes with Nathaniel. His intense gaze bore into her, filled with emotions she couldn't begin to decipher.

Evelyn's breath caught. There had been something unsettling about Nathaniel since their engagement ceremony that she couldn't shake.

"Where do we pay?" Julian asked a nearby clerk.

"Right this way, sir."

As Julian moved to complete the purchase, Evelyn fumbled with her old phone, attempting to transfer her SIM card.

The tiny card stubbornly refused to budge from its slot.

Suddenly, a pair of familiar, elegant hands appeared, effortlessly plucking the phone from her grasp. With practiced movements, Nathaniel freed the trapped SIM card.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. When she recovered, she found the small card resting in Nathaniel's open palm.

He extended his hand toward her silently, his expression unreadable.

"Thank you," she managed, her fingers brushing against his warm skin as she retrieved the card.

The brief contact sent an electric jolt up her arm. Evelyn bent quickly to insert the SIM, only to find the phone still showed no signal.

"Did you insert it upside down?" Nathaniel's deep voice rumbled beside her.

Evelyn's cheeks warmed as she removed the card again. But her mind was elsewhere.

Why was Nathaniel still here?

Julian returned from checkout just in time to see Nathaniel hovering near Evelyn. Alarm bells rang in his mind.

"What's going on here?" he demanded, inserting himself between them.

Evelyn startled. "Nothing. Just transferring my SIM card."

"I see." Julian's eyes narrowed suspiciously at Nathaniel, concerned the older man might accidentally reveal their complicated history.

"We're finished here," Julian announced firmly, placing a protective hand on Evelyn's back. "Let's go."

He couldn't risk Evelyn spending another moment with Nathaniel. The potential for disaster was too great.

Evelyn was equally eager to leave. She shoved the new phone into her bag without checking if the SIM was properly seated.

They had barely taken three steps when Nathaniel's commanding voice stopped them cold.

"Wait."
###Chapter 253

Nathaniel's voice cut through the air like a knife, making Evelyn and Julian freeze mid-step. An uncomfortable silence settled between them, thick with unspoken tension.

They turned slowly, exchanging wary glances toward where Nathaniel stood.

As he approached Evelyn, her fingers twisted nervously in her sweater. "Y-Yes? Did you need something?" Her voice came out higher than intended.

Julian's jaw tightened. He'd never trusted Nathaniel, especially not with the way those piercing eyes studied Evelyn like she was some fascinating specimen.

Nathaniel stopped just inches away, extending his hand palm-up.

Evelyn's breath hitched when she spotted the SIM card resting in Julian's grip. The memory of her earlier blunder flooded back—how she'd nearly inserted it upside down in her panic.

She'd meant to fix it, but Julian had appeared at precisely the wrong moment. Terrified he might discover her connection to Nathaniel, she'd practically dragged Julian out of the store.

In her haste, the SIM card had never been properly seated.

Clearing her throat, Evelyn managed a quiet, "Thank you."

Her fingers had barely brushed the tiny chip when Julian snatched it from Nathaniel's hand. "Evelyn," he chided, "how many times must I tell you to be more careful?" He pocketed the card protectively. "I'll help you set this up properly at home."

Evelyn nodded, cheeks burning as she followed Julian out of the boutique, painfully aware of Nathaniel's gaze boring into her back.

Left alone, Nathaniel replayed Julian's words—"at home." His fingers clenched around his silk tie until the knuckles turned white.

Damn it all.

He never should have come to this godforsaken mall.

When Evelyn finally stepped through the Montgomery estate doors, she was immediately swarmed by her brothers. "Evelyn!" Alexander's sharp eyes zeroed in on her face. "What happened to your lip?"

"Oh, it's nothing," she waved a dismissive hand. "Just a tiny scratch."

During the drive home, Julian had warned her about the near-hysteria that had gripped the household when she'd gone missing.

Now facing six pairs of worried eyes, Evelyn dipped her head. "I'm so sorry for scaring you all. When my phone broke, I should've borrowed someone's to call."

Alexander's stern expression softened slightly. He'd been ready to lecture her about responsibility, but the genuine remorse in her eyes stopped him.

With a sigh, he crossed his arms. "Don't make this a habit."

Evelyn nodded vigorously. "I promise!"

Olivia squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Sweetheart, no need for promises. We just want you safe." Her smile turned mischievous. "Though with six brothers at your disposal, you've got your own personal security team."

A warm glow spread through Evelyn's chest. Sometimes she still pinched herself, unable to believe this loving family was truly hers.

From his sprawled position on the sofa, Daniel piped up, "As long as you're okay, that's what matters." He smirked. "Though I've already got plans brewing for those so-called parents of yours."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "Daniel," she warned, "nothing illegal, please?"

Alexander patted her shoulder. "Don't worry your pretty little head."

But the way they exchanged glances only heightened her unease.

She grabbed Alexander's arm urgently. "I appreciate you wanting to protect me, but let's handle this properly. No shady business, okay?"

Olivia smoothly intervened. "Darling, your brothers know exactly where to draw the line." Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "There are countless ways to make Walter and Beverly's lives... interesting."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Interesting how?"

Andrew leaned forward, grinning. "My contacts dug up some juicy details about Edward and Giselle. That shotgun wedding? Turns out the baby might not be Edward's after all."
###Chapter 254

Evelyn gasped as the realization hit her.

If Walter and Beverly discovered that Giselle wasn't carrying Edward's child, the fallout would be disastrous.

Yet, the thought brought her a flicker of satisfaction.

She stifled a yawn, exhaustion from the day's events weighing heavily on her.

At the same time, a dull ache pulsed in her stomach.

Julian noticed her discomfort and quickly changed the subject. "Let's eat. The important thing is that Evelyn is home safe."

After all, he had already ensured that Walter and Beverly wouldn’t dare return—his warning had been clear.

Once dinner was over, Evelyn retreated to her room, desperate for rest.

The next morning, she instinctively checked the news, expecting headlines about Nathaniel and Victoria’s engagement.

Given Victoria’s love for attention, Evelyn assumed there would be carefully leaked photos circulating.

But no matter how many times she refreshed the page, there was nothing.

No announcement. No whispers.

It made no sense.

Had Nathaniel insisted on secrecy, just as he had during their own marriage?

It seemed Victoria hadn’t earned the privilege of a public declaration.

Shaking off the thought, Evelyn headed straight to the studio.

As she settled at her desk, Jonathan approached. "Evelyn, we received the final payment for yesterday’s engagement setup. Let’s celebrate with dinner tonight."

Her expression tightened. "They paid so quickly? I suppose the happy couple must have loved my design."

Jonathan lowered his voice. "Between us—keep this quiet. But that engagement? It didn’t happen. It was called off."

"Called off?" Evelyn couldn’t believe it.

"Do you think I’d lie? I stayed in touch with the venue coordinator. They confirmed it—the engagement was canceled."

Evelyn was stunned.

No wonder she had seen Nathaniel at the mall yesterday.

She had assumed the ceremony ended early, but this? This was unexpected.

Hadn’t Victoria used Eleanor’s surgery to force Nathaniel into this?

So why cancel now? What about Eleanor?

Worry twisted in Evelyn’s chest.

"Evelyn, are you okay?"

"It’s nothing," she murmured, shaking her head.

The abrupt cancellation left her reeling. What had changed?

Later that afternoon, Natalie approached. "There’s a man outside asking for you. Claims to be a relative from your hometown."

Evelyn frowned. She had few ties to her past.

Cautiously, she stepped outside—and froze.

A disheveled man lunged forward, grabbing her wrist. "Darling, come home with me."

She jerked back. "Let go! Who the hell are you?"

"I know who you are—Evelyn Carter. Your adoptive parents promised you to me. They took ten thousand dollars. You’re my wife now."
###Chapter 255

Evelyn Carter couldn't suppress a bitter laugh when she heard Vincent Blackwood's outrageous claims.

The very idea that someone could still try to arrange a marriage through bribery in this day and age struck her as ludicrous.

Did Walter and Beverly Simmons truly believe such archaic tactics would work on her?

Jonathan Reeves suddenly appeared, shoving Vincent away with force. "Back off! One more step and I'm calling the authorities!"

Vincent scrambled up from the pavement, dusting himself off. "I paid her family fifteen thousand dollars! That's my life savings! Evelyn is legally bound to marry me now."

Evelyn's icy glare could have frozen lava. "You're delusional. I severed all ties with those people years ago. Whatever money they took from you is their problem."

Vincent's face twisted in anger. "Blood means nothing! They accepted my bride price, which makes you my woman!"

Jonathan scoffed. "This isn't the Middle Ages. Evelyn never consented to this sham arrangement. Leave now or face the consequences."

"Call whoever you want!" Vincent spat. "If I can't have my bride, I might as well die right here!"

Evelyn's hand shot out, grabbing a nearby fire extinguisher. "Fine by me. Let's settle this right now."

The sudden movement sent Vincent stumbling backward in terror before turning to flee.

As Evelyn set down the extinguisher, Jonathan stared at her with newfound admiration. "That was... impressive."

"I've dealt with his type before," Evelyn replied grimly. "Though I never imagined my so-called parents would sink this low."

"Don't worry," Jonathan assured her. "Legally, you're clean. They're the ones who accepted the money."

"I know. But this could still cause problems for the studio."



Jonathan reached out instinctively, his fingers brushing against Evelyn's hair before she stepped away.

"Evelyn, you don't have to face this alone. We're friends, aren't we? Let me help."

Evelyn cleared her throat, putting more distance between them. "I appreciate it, Jonathan. But I should get back to work."

"Of course." Jonathan sighed inwardly as he watched her retreat. Winning her trust would take time - good thing he had plenty to spare.

At her desk, Evelyn couldn't shake thoughts of Vincent's disturbing appearance. If Walter and Beverly had indeed taken his money, she knew this wouldn't be the last she'd see of him.

As she left work that evening, Vincent materialized from the shadows, grabbing her wrist. "There you are, wife. Time to come home."

Evelyn twisted free with practiced ease. "Touch me again and you'll regret it. Take your grievance to the people who stole from you."

"Your parents took my bride price!" Vincent snarled. "You think you can just walk away? Not happening!"

"Evelyn!"

Jonathan appeared like a guardian angel, positioning himself between them. "I've got you."

Vincent whistled sharply. From nearby bushes emerged four rough-looking men, forming a tight circle around Evelyn and Jonathan.
###Chapter 256

The scene unfolded before Jonathan's eyes, sending a chill down his spine. Fear gripped him, but beneath the terror, he saw a chance to turn the tables.

"Stay back," he warned, voice trembling yet firm. "This is a civilized society, monitored by cameras at every corner. Do you really think you can get away with this?"

His words dripped with disdain. "People like you belong in the backwoods, hidden away in the mountains. Save yourselves the humiliation and just—"

Before he could finish, a sharp blow struck his head.

Blood trickled down his temple as Evelyn gasped, horrified. "Jonathan! Are you alright?"

In the blink of an eye, Jonathan collapsed.

Desperate, Evelyn tried to reach for her phone, but her wrists and ankles were bound. She was dragged away, helpless.

A rusted van idled nearby, its engine growling. She was shoved into the backseat, the reality sinking in—they had planned this.

She had been reckless.

As Vincent slid into the driver’s seat, Evelyn glared at him. "Kidnapping is a crime. My family will find me."

Vincent smirked. "Don’t worry, sweetheart. Once we reach our town, no one will ever find you. Others have tried. None succeeded."

"Vincent, congrats on landing such a refined city girl," one of his men jeered. "College-educated women are a rare catch."

"Yeah, your kids will be smart and pretty," another added.

Vincent chuckled darkly. "Of course. I didn’t pay ten thousand just for one. We’ll have plenty."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She could only pray her brothers would notice her absence soon.

She had to stay calm. Panicking would only make things worse.

Especially now.

Especially for the baby.

The van sped onto the highway, leaving the city behind. Their plan was clear—get her to the village before anyone could intervene.

Night fell, but Evelyn refused to sleep. If she closed her eyes, she might wake up in hell.

Eventually, the van stopped on a desolate country road.

The men stepped out to stretch and eat.

Vincent tossed her a piece of bread. "Eat. Cooperate, and you’ll be treated well. Our town isn’t as fancy as the city, but it’s not bad."

Evelyn eyed the bread, then met his gaze. "I need milk too."

He smirked. "Sure. As long as you behave."

She sat stiffly, hoping he’d untie her. But he stayed wary, unmoved.

Defeated, she ate. The baby couldn’t afford her pride.

Soon, the van rumbled back to life.

The rough road lulled her into an uneasy sleep.

When she woke, dawn had broken. Mountains loomed around her, endless and suffocating.

Her heart sank. "Are we there?"

"Not yet," Vincent said. "We’ve got two more mountains to cross. We’re taking backroads—slower, but safer."

Evelyn clenched her fists. Her brothers would come.

Then—

The distant roar of helicopter blades cut through the silence.
###Chapter 257

Evelyn's heart leaped with sudden hope as the distant thrum of helicopter blades reached her ears.

This couldn't possibly be a coincidence.

Could it be her brothers coming to save her?

In the passenger seat, Vincent's grip tightened on his seat. "Is that the police?" he demanded.

Donovan, driving, let out a derisive laugh. "Vincent, you've been watching too many action films. Since when do cops use choppers for routine patrols?"

"We've used this route dozens of times. Nothing ever goes wrong."

"Then explain that helicopter," Vincent snapped. "We've never seen one in these mountains before."

"Probably some tourist company or news crew getting aerial footage," Donovan dismissed.

Vincent reluctantly admitted the explanation made sense. The idea of a rescue helicopter specifically for Evelyn seemed absurd given the astronomical costs involved.

Soon, Donovan pointed out, "See? It's flying away. Told you it wasn't here for us. You're too paranoid."

Evelyn's hope deflated as the helicopter's roar faded into the distance.

Had it really just been passing through?

A fresh wave of panic gripped her. The sheer audacity of being kidnapped in broad daylight still stunned her.

What could she do now?

Was she really going to deliver her baby in these godforsaken mountains?

The van suddenly jerked to a violent stop.

"Damn it!" Donovan slammed the wheel. "Who the hell put this tree across the road?"

"What now? Turn back?" Vincent asked.

"Like hell we're turning back. Everyone out - we're moving this damn log."

As the men exited, Evelyn found herself alone in the van.

Holding her breath, she carefully sat up, peering through the windows at the treacherous mountain terrain surrounding them.

Escape seemed impossible in her condition.

Then, like ghosts materializing from the forest, figures in camouflage gear emerged, swiftly overpowering the kidnappers.

Evelyn's pulse pounded as she watched the scene unfold.

Who were these mysterious rescuers?

The van door suddenly flew open. Evelyn turned to see a camouflage-clad man with dirt-smudged features, but those piercing eyes were unmistakable.

Nathaniel?

Without a word, Nathaniel sliced through her restraints. His expression darkened seeing the raw marks on her wrists.

Masking his fury, he offered her a steady hand. "You're safe now."

Evelyn blinked dazedly. "I...I can't feel my legs."

Pregnant and stiff from being bound, she feared falling if she tried to stand.

Before she could protest, Nathaniel bent and scooped her into his arms. Instinctively, her arms circled his neck as she studied the tactical paint streaking his handsome features, giving him an almost feral appearance.

"How did you find me?" she whispered, astonished he'd been the first to reach her.

Nathaniel didn't answer, carefully setting her on a cleared patch of roadside. He wiped off a flat stone. "Sit here."

As she complied, Nathaniel knelt before her, producing a medical kit. He worked methodically, disinfecting her rope burns.

The antiseptic stung. Evelyn flinched, a small whimper escaping.

Nathaniel's grip on her ankle tightened. "Hold still."

"It hurts," she breathed, tears pricking her eyes.

Nathaniel paused, his gaze lifting to meet hers. Adjusting his touch, he murmured, "Just a little longer. Be brave for me."
###Chapter 258

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat at Nathaniel's unexpected reply.

Rather than the soothing reassurance she'd hoped for, his blunt advice to endure the pain left her stunned.

Yet even as disappointment flickered through her, Evelyn knew he spoke the harsh truth - in this situation, bearing the discomfort was her only choice.

The contrast between Nathaniel's stern words and his surprisingly tender touch didn't escape her notice.

A sudden commotion erupted nearby, shrill screams piercing the air.

Evelyn turned instinctively, but broad-shouldered men in tactical gear blocked her view.

From the terrified shouts, it sounded like her kidnappers were receiving their just desserts.

Her attention shifted downward to the neatly wrapped bandage around her ankle. Then upward again, drawn irresistibly to Nathaniel's chiseled profile - all aristocratic angles and effortless grace.

When their eyes met, Evelyn found herself drowning in those impossibly blue depths.

Nathaniel looked away first, his voice rougher than usual. "Any other injuries I should know about?"

"Just my pride," Evelyn managed, clearing her throat. She inched backward slightly, stealing another glance at the ongoing drama. "Thank you... for coming after me."

Nathaniel set down the medical supplies with deliberate care. "Next time, perhaps select a protector who won't land you in such situations."

Evelyn's lips thinned. "How's Jonathan?"

"Alive," Nathaniel clipped out, disdain dripping from the single word.

Relief flooded through Evelyn at the news Jonathan wasn't seriously hurt. He'd thrown himself into harm's way for her, after all.

Who could have predicted such brazen daylight kidnapping?

Nathaniel's gaze swept over the subdued captives. "What should we do with this filth?"

Evelyn blinked. "You're asking me?"

His eyebrow arched in that infuriating way. "Unless you see another victim here?"

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. "Call the authorities?"

"Predictable." Nathaniel's smirk didn't reach his eyes.

Evelyn's hands clenched. "Murder tends to complicate things legally. I'd prefer we both avoid prison."

At her use of "we," Nathaniel's lips twitched. "Relax, darling. Did you actually think I was serious?"

Evelyn gritted her teeth, that momentary warmth toward him evaporating. How could she forget what an insufferable man he was?

Nathaniel turned to his team. "Report."

"Full confession, sir. Ms. Carter's so-called adoptive parents accepted ten thousand to provide her photo and address. They specifically instructed these men to abduct her."

Evelyn's face drained of color. "I'll make them regret this."

"You've handled your adoptive family's schemes before," Nathaniel observed, studying her closely. "Why did this one catch you off guard?"

His intense scrutiny made Evelyn shift uncomfortably. If not for Nathaniel's timely intervention, she might have disappeared into those remote mountains forever.

The terrifying realization settled in her bones.

"I never imagined they'd dare something so bold in the city," she admitted quietly.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Underestimate people at your peril. Start using that sharp mind of yours outside the courtroom."

A sudden thought struck Evelyn. She met his gaze directly. "How did you know I was in trouble?"
###Chapter 259

Evelyn stared at Nathaniel in bewilderment. Her situation had spiraled out of control so suddenly, and she had fully expected her brothers to be the ones to find her first.

When she heard the helicopter earlier, a fleeting hope had flickered in her chest—maybe, just maybe, her brothers had come to save her.

But no.

It was Nathaniel.

Nathaniel narrowed his eyes. "What's that look for? Disappointed it's me? Who were you waiting for?"

"I just assumed it might be the police making a dramatic entrance. Is that so hard to believe?"

Swinging her uninjured leg, Evelyn continued, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "With your packed schedule, I never imagined you'd take such a personal interest and swoop in like some knight in shining armor. Color me surprised."

"Don't flatter yourself. I just didn’t want rumors spreading that my wife was dragged off to be some backwoods bride. Think of the scandal—what would people say?"

Evelyn’s gaze dropped. Of course. His haste had nothing to do with concern for her.

Just then, Nathaniel stood, clutching his first aid kit. "Since you're clearly in good spirits, I’ll take my leave."

Watching him turn away so casually, panic flared in her chest. "Hey! You’re seriously just going to walk away?"

Her eyes darted to the helicopter, where his team was already preparing to depart. It was as if no one cared whether she lived or died!

Desperation clawed at her. She scrambled to her feet. "Nathaniel Whitmore, stop right there! Legally, I’m still your wife. Are you really going to abandon me here? You heartless bastard!"

Nathaniel paused beside the helicopter, watching as she hobbled toward him. A smirk tugged at his lips before he schooled his expression into cool indifference. "Glad you remember you’re still my wife. Considering how often you forget."

Evelyn swallowed her pride. Survival first. "Fine. Take me with you."

His eyebrow arched. "Did you just call me a bastard?"

When he’d gotten word of her predicament, he’d dropped everything—calls, meetings, deals—to track her down. And this was the thanks he got?

Evelyn forced a sweet smile. "Mr. Whitmore, you’re dashing, generous, and utterly heroic. A man of your caliber deserves nothing but praise."

Nathaniel pinched her cheek, amused. "Try harder. That smile’s about as convincing as a politician’s promise."

Her temper flared. How dare he manhandle her like this?

He withdrew his hand. "One sincere compliment, and I’ll let you tag along."

Evelyn blinked. Was he serious?

She glanced at the helicopter, then back at him. "...You’re ridiculously attractive?"

"I know. Next."

"Your highness?"

"Try again."

Evelyn huffed. "Fine! Nathaniel, please!"

He shuddered. "Use real words."

She tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Honey? Darling? Sweetheart?"

A few of his men coughed to hide their laughter.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Where did you even learn these ridiculous pet names?"

Evelyn threw her hands up. "You pick, then!"

In one swift motion, he swept her into his arms.

She gasped. "I can walk!"

"Not fast enough."

Evelyn gritted her teeth. Thanks for the reminder about my height, you insufferable man.
###Chapter 260

Did long legs really give someone such an unfair advantage?

As Evelyn settled into the helicopter, her feet dangled just above the floor, barely touching. It seemed impossible that she could have climbed in without assistance.

Once inside, she glanced down at her captors sprawled on the ground below. "What's going to happen to them?" she asked.

"Someone will deal with them," Nathaniel replied smoothly.

He took the seat beside her in the cramped cabin, their arms pressed close together. She could feel the heat radiating from him, a stark contrast to the biting mountain air.

Evelyn's stomach growled loudly—she was ravenous.

The crinkling of a wrapper caught her attention. She turned to see Nathaniel holding out a chocolate bar. Her mouth watered instantly.

He shook it teasingly. "Hungry?"

She nodded. "You wouldn’t let your wife starve, would you? Imagine the scandal if word got out."

Nathaniel unwrapped the chocolate and handed it to her, his expression unreadable but his actions swift.

Evelyn took it without hesitation. As a pregnant woman, skipping meals wasn’t an option.

Besides, as the father of her child, sharing his snack was the least he could do.

After eating, the tension in her shoulders finally eased. They were safe now.

Moments later, she found herself leaning into Nathaniel’s warmth, instinctively burrowing under his coat.

He glanced down at her, a faint smirk playing on his lips. Without a word, he shrugged off the coat and draped it over her.

She was only this docile when she was asleep.

Nathaniel studied her face, noting the soft roundness of her cheeks. He pinched one lightly, amused.



Had she been eating well without him? In such a short time, she’d clearly gained weight.

Just then, Robert messaged Nathaniel: Sir, Julian has been blowing up my phone, demanding our location.

Nathaniel skimmed the message and replied: Head straight to the hospital.

Though Evelyn seemed fine, he wasn’t taking any chances. Only a doctor could confirm she was truly unharmed.

Thirty minutes later, the helicopter landed on the hospital rooftop.

Julian had been waiting anxiously. Since discovering Evelyn’s disappearance, he and his brothers had turned the city upside down searching for her.

But as outsiders in Bern City, their efforts had been frustratingly slow.

Somehow, Nathaniel had gotten wind of the situation and mobilized his own team, speeding up the search dramatically.

As the helicopter touched down, Nathaniel carefully lifted the sleeping Evelyn into his arms.

Julian rushed forward, reaching for her, but Nathaniel strode past him, heading for the stairs without breaking stride.

Julian’s temper flared. Why was Nathaniel still carrying her? He needed to put her down—now!

If not for Nathaniel’s crucial role in finding Evelyn, Julian would’ve confronted him on the spot.

Fuming, he forced himself to stay composed. He quickly updated the family group chat: Evelyn’s at the hospital. No visible injuries so far.

Then he hurried after Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, why don’t you let someone else carry her? You must be exhausted."

Nathaniel didn’t slow down. "She’s not heavy."

Julian blinked.

That wasn’t the point!

What gave Nathaniel the right to hold her like this?


###Chapter 261

Nathaniel's grip tightened around Evelyn as Julian's voice cut through the tension. "Put her down right now! Who gave you the right to hold her like this?"

Turning slowly, Nathaniel met Julian's furious gaze with icy composure. "You stay away from her."

"Don't make me repeat myself, Nathaniel." Julian took a threatening step forward, his jaw clenched. "Let. Her. Go."

"Not happening. Back off."

The air between them crackled with hostility, thick enough to choke on.

Then—

Evelyn stirred, her lashes fluttering open. Blinking against the harsh lights, she found herself trapped between the two men, their heated standoff sending shivers down her spine.

She lifted a trembling hand. "Uh... can someone explain what's going on?"

Both men snapped their attention to her. "You're awake?"

Julian rushed closer, his voice laced with concern. "Evelyn, are you hurt? Tell me where it hurts—anything at all."

She shook her head weakly. "I'm fine."

Then she realized—Nathaniel was still holding her. Heat flooded her cheeks. "You can... put me down now."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "I'm taking you to the exam room."

"Wait—just set her on the stretcher," Julian interjected, gesturing to the medical team waiting nearby.

Evelyn spotted the nurses and doctors hovering with a gurney. She glanced at Nathaniel. "Really, it's fine. People are staring."

After a tense pause, Nathaniel reluctantly lowered her onto the stretcher, shooting Julian a glare that could freeze hell.

As the wheels rolled forward, Evelyn exhaled, watching the ceiling lights blur past. She turned her head slightly, offering Julian a small, reassuring smile. "I'm okay. Don't worry."

Julian sighed, raking a hand through his hair before rounding on Nathaniel. "Where did you find her? What happened to the bastards who took her?"

His fists clenched. Whoever dared lay a finger on Evelyn would pay.

Nathaniel adjusted his cuffs, his tone clipped. "Police have them."

Julian gave a stiff nod, though his glare didn't soften. "For Evelyn's sake, I'll let this slide. For now."

But this wasn't over. Once Evelyn was cleared, he and Nathaniel were going to have words.

With that, Julian hurried after the gurney. Pregnant or not, he wasn't letting her out of his sight again.

Nathaniel watched him go, irritation coiling in his chest. He straightened his tie, the motion sharp.

Inside the exam room, Evelyn stared at the sterile walls, her hand drifting to her stomach.

"Evelyn."

Julian entered, flipping through her chart. "The baby's stable. You're good."

She nodded. "Sorry for scaring everyone."

"This wasn't your fault. We should've dealt with your adoptive family sooner." Guilt gnawed at him.

Evelyn managed a tired smile. "You've done more than enough for me."

"Just rest. I'll handle things."

Her gaze flicked to the door. "Julian... what were you and Nathaniel arguing about earlier?"

She'd been half-conscious, but their voices had jolted her awake.

Julian shifted uncomfortably. "He refused to let go of you. I told him to back off, but he—"

"That's it?"

"Yeah. Why was he holding you like that in the first place? If you hadn't woken up when you did—" His jaw tightened. "If I hadn't held back because he found you first, I would've knocked him out."
###Chapter 262

Nathaniel's jaw clenched as the memory replayed in his mind. He had suspected Julian's inappropriate interest in Evelyn from the beginning, and this incident only proved him right.

This wasn't just casual flirtation. It was deliberate pursuit.

Evelyn cleared her throat softly. "Nathaniel, I'm sure Julian didn't mean anything by it."

"What do you mean 'didn't mean anything'?" Nathaniel's voice turned sharp. "Stay away from him, Evelyn. He's older, divorced, and already planning his next marriage."

"Aside from his wealth, he has nothing to offer. Don't let yourself be swayed by empty gestures."

Evelyn nearly rolled her eyes at Nathaniel's warning. "Relax, I'm not falling for him."

She had learned her lesson well enough. Never again would she let herself be fooled.

"Good." Nathaniel exhaled in relief.

He had genuinely feared Evelyn might be charmed by Julian's extravagant displays. Most women were vulnerable to such tactics.

The medical examination concluded quickly, and Evelyn was moved to a regular ward.

Soon after, an elaborate meal arrived, making Evelyn's stomach growl.

Nathaniel frowned. "I didn't order this."

Julian stepped into the room, his gaze lingering on Evelyn before he shrugged. "I picked something at random from the menu. Eat whatever you like."

Evelyn froze, fork in hand. She hadn't expected Julian to arrange this.

Nathaniel's lips thinned. Forcing a smile, he turned to Julian. "Evelyn needs rest. Why don't we step outside?"

Julian smirked. "I don't think we have anything to discuss."

He had no interest in conversing with his rival.

Evelyn tensed, worried Julian might slip and reveal something.

If Nathaniel found out she had been disowned by the Whitmores—and worse, that she was carrying Julian's child—it would spell disaster.

She quickly set her fork down. "Actually, I'd prefer some fruit."

Nathaniel softened instantly. "Of course. What kind? I'll get it for you."

"Anything seasonal is fine," she replied.

He nodded, but his expression hardened when he turned back to Julian. "Don't disturb her for too long. She needs rest."

Julian bristled at the command. Who did Nathaniel think he was?

Once Nathaniel left, Julian scoffed. "So, he's the one you chose? Seems attentive enough, I suppose."

Evelyn took another bite before responding. "Thank you. My taste in men has clearly improved."

Julian clenched his jaw. "I shouldn't have interfered."

He had no desire to watch Evelyn grow closer to someone else.

"By the way," Evelyn hesitated, "I heard your engagement with Victoria was called off. Is that true?"

Julian remained impassive. "Yes."

"Does that affect Eleanor's surgery?"

Confusion flickered in his eyes. Hadn't Evelyn convinced Nathaniel to handle the surgery? Why was she bringing this up now?

Footsteps echoed outside the door.

Alexander barged in first, only to freeze when he saw Julian already inside.

The tension between them was palpable. Five against one.

The standoff was unmistakable.
###Chapter 263

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat as she took in the unexpected sight before her.

Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined her brothers would cross paths with Nathaniel at the hospital. The potential fallout sent chills down her spine. Was this the beginning of the end?

She couldn't bring herself to disclose her complicated relationship with Nathaniel to her protective siblings.

Knowing Alexander's fiery temper, Evelyn was certain he'd make Nathaniel pay dearly if he discovered the truth.

This confrontation had to be stopped at all costs. Evelyn steeled herself to intervene.

Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto Nathaniel as he strode into the hospital room with his brothers, instantly making the space feel claustrophobic.

Nathaniel blinked in confusion at the Montgomery brothers' sudden appearance. What were they doing here?

Julian returned moments later with a fruit platter. Relief washed over him when he saw Alexander's group approaching.

But his expression darkened when he noticed Nathaniel. "Why are you still here?" Julian demanded, his voice sharp.

Nathaniel frowned. "Is there a problem with me being here?"

After all, he'd just rescued Evelyn. Didn't that earn him some visiting rights?

Daniel stepped forward, placing a firm hand on Nathaniel's shoulder. "Come with me," he said smoothly. "Let me explain why you can't stay."

Before Nathaniel could protest, he found himself escorted out of the room.

Daniel leaned against the doorframe, speaking in hushed tones. "Can't you see you're interrupting a family moment? Do you enjoy being the unwanted guest?"

Nathaniel's eyes widened in shock.

Family moment? Had Evelyn and Julian progressed to introducing each other to their families already?

Just then, Robert rushed over, addressing Nathaniel urgently. "Mr. Whitmore, we've apprehended the kidnappers. What are your orders?"

Nathaniel's expression hardened as he recalled the recent events. "Why are you asking me? Hand them over to the authorities."

With Evelyn surrounded by so many protective men, his presence seemed unnecessary now.

Back in the hospital room, Evelyn propped herself up against the pillows, offering her brothers a weak smile. "Alexander, I'm really fine. If you don't believe me, ask Julian."

Julian placed the fruit platter beside her. "Evelyn, you need proper rest," he said gently. "Eat these when you're ready."

Alexander had a thousand questions burning in his mind, but seeing Evelyn safe rendered him speechless.

Nothing mattered more to him than his sister's wellbeing.

Sebastian handed Evelyn a new phone. "Keep this with you. Call us anytime you need anything."

Julian added reassuringly, "Don't worry, I'll stay at the hospital. She's in good hands."

After her brothers left, Evelyn lay alone, her hand instinctively drifting to her abdomen. Thank goodness the baby was safe.

The next morning, Evelyn was determined to check out, consumed by thoughts of retribution.

Julian remained steadfast by her side. "Evelyn, why the rush? Consider staying one more day. Remember, you're carrying precious cargo now."

"But Julian, I can't just sit here doing nothing!"

Dark circles under her eyes betrayed a sleepless night filled with nightmares of what might have been if Nathaniel hadn't arrived in time.

"Evelyn, Alexander's handling everything. Trust him. Your adoptive parents won't escape justice this time," Julian assured.

Before Evelyn could respond, the door burst open.

Beverly, Walter, and Giselle marched in, followed by a group of rough-looking country folk.

Walter wasted no time. "Dad's been arrested. You need to come to the police station immediately to get him released!"

Beverly wrung her hands nervously. "After everything Walter did for you, how can you just abandon him now?"

Evelyn's laugh was bitter. "You're no family of mine. If anything, you're the criminals here."
###Chapter 264

A woman from the countryside in the group spoke up sharply, "Evelyn, you're being utterly ungrateful. If the Simmons family hadn't taken you in, do you honestly think you'd have survived this long?"

Beverly sat on the ground, wailing dramatically. "Evelyn, I went through all the trouble of arranging a marriage for you. If you refuse, that’s your choice."

"But why drag the police into this and accuse us of human trafficking? How cruel can you be?"

"Exactly," another chimed in. "In our town, matchmaking is tradition. No one sees it as trafficking."

Priscilla, Giselle’s mother, stepped forward, her eyes locked onto Evelyn. "Evelyn, my daughter Giselle is set to marry Edward."

"If you report him to the police now and get him arrested, how are we supposed to hold the wedding?"

Giselle, standing beside Edward, pleaded, "Evelyn, could you please go to the station and ask them to release Walter and the others?"

Evelyn’s expression remained icy. "Ah, I almost forgot—you all took Vincent’s bribes too, didn’t you?"

"Since every single one of you accepted dirty money, it’s only fair you all answer for it at the station."

Giselle’s face tightened. She quickly defended herself, "It was a legal transaction! I didn’t take any tainted money."

"Enough, Evelyn," Beverly cut in. "Giselle is carrying my grandchild. Don’t upset the baby."

Evelyn smirked. "Are you sure that child is Edward’s?"

Priscilla’s voice rose in outrage. "Whose else would it be? Stop spouting nonsense!"

Evelyn glanced at Julian, then pulled out her phone, playing a video.

"Giselle was caught in an affair. She got pregnant to secure her status but was kicked out."

"After multiple past abortions, she was terrified of another one."

"So she rushed to find a husband."

Julian then handed over a stack of documents. "These are Giselle’s medical records from our hospital."

Beverly squinted at the papers before turning to Edward. "I forgot my glasses. Read this for me."

Edward paled as he scanned the pages. "Giselle, you never mentioned abortions."

Priscilla and Giselle froze, panic flashing across their faces.

Giselle blurted, "These are fake!"

"Absolutely!" Priscilla snapped. "You’re just trying to avoid paying child support!"

Evelyn waved her phone. "Edward, I have proof Giselle was seeing other men."

"Congrats—your fiancée has a habit of cheating."

Giselle and Priscilla exchanged frantic looks. "Edward, think it over. We’re leaving."

Beverly blocked their path. "Not so fast. Return the money I gave you first."

Priscilla scoffed. "That money is my daughter’s. We’re keeping it."

Beverly crossed her arms. "Not until a paternity test confirms it’s Edward’s child."

When Beverly tried to stop them, a scuffle broke out between her and Priscilla.

Watching the chaos, Evelyn laughed—justice served at last.
###Chapter 265



Evelyn couldn't help but smirk as she watched Priscilla and Beverly exchange vicious insults, their voices sharp with venom.

The sight was so absurd, she nearly laughed until tears streamed down her face.

They got exactly what they deserved.

Turning to Edward, she warned in a low voice, "You'd better get that ten thousand dollars back, or your entire family will pay the price."

"That money is undeniable proof of your involvement in human trafficking."

Edward looked just as stunned, still reeling from the revelation that Giselle’s child wasn’t his.

This entire mess had forced him into a hasty marriage—one he never would’ve considered otherwise.

Furious, Edward grabbed Giselle by the arm. "Where’s the money? Hand it over!"

Just then, an officer stepped into the room. "Who is Edward Simmons? And where are his family members?"

Without missing a beat, Evelyn spoke up. "That’s him, but it was Priscilla and Giselle who took the illegal funds."

Giselle paled, desperation lacing her voice. "You can’t arrest me! Do you even know whose child I’m carrying? It’s the future heir of Globex Corporation’s CEO!"

Disgust twisted Edward’s face. "His granddaughter is your age! How could you sleep with a man that old?"

Giselle scoffed. "What choice did I have? Did you really think I’d settle for a broke loser like you?"

"If I hadn’t needed someone to step in, I never would’ve touched you. Ten thousand dollars was a fortune to you, wasn’t it?"

Priscilla sneered. "Exactly! With your family’s financial state, you should be grateful she even looked your way!"

Edward looked shattered, as if the weight of the world had crushed him. He stumbled toward the window ledge, murmuring, "I don’t want to live anymore. It’s too much."



Seeing him about to jump, Beverly lunged forward. "Edward, stop! She’s not worth it!"

Priscilla scoffed. "Excuse me? Who are you calling ‘not worth it’?"

Beverly didn’t hesitate. She charged at Giselle, slapping her hard across the face. "You deceitful witch! How dare you play with my son’s heart!"

Giselle’s face swelled instantly, and blood trickled down her legs—signs of a miscarriage.

Evelyn gasped. "She’s pregnant!"

Chaos erupted.

Nathaniel quickly pulled Evelyn back. "Stay out of this. It’s not safe."

Evelyn retreated, pressing a protective hand over her own stomach.

She hadn’t expected things to escalate this far.

Soon, Giselle was rushed to the ER, while Beverly and Edward were arrested for human trafficking.

Beverly turned to Evelyn, pleading. "We were tricked too! Can’t you just demand the money back? Why involve the police?"

Evelyn met the officer’s gaze firmly. "I have no ties to them. Handle this as you see fit."

Forgiveness was impossible. Their betrayal ran too deep.

As they were led away, silence finally settled over the hospital room.

Moments later, Nathaniel returned. "Giselle lost the baby. And she’ll never conceive again."

Evelyn sighed. "I figured. Given her history of abortions, it was bound to happen."
###Chapter 266

Evelyn gently placed a hand on her stomach and turned to Julian with concern in her eyes. "Julian, how's Jonathan doing? He got hurt protecting me."

"Jonathan has a concussion and some head trauma, but it's not life-threatening. He's resting at the hospital now."

"Given what he went through trying to save you, I'd say he's earned some hero points."

"Julian, it's not like that between Jonathan and me. Besides, I'm pregnant—what man would want me like this?"

Julian's expression darkened at her words.

"Evelyn, don't ever think a child makes you less worthy. You have your brothers. We'll stand by you no matter what."

He even scoffed at Jonathan's abilities, calling them mediocre at best.

Evelyn didn't argue further. Instead, she bought some fruit and headed to Jonathan's hospital room.

To her surprise, an elegant older woman was already there—Judith Reeves, Jonathan's mother.

Guilt twisted in Evelyn's chest. "Jonathan, how are you feeling?"

"Evelyn! You're okay?" Jonathan's face lit up despite the bandages wrapped around his head. "I was so worried something had happened to you."

Judith quickly steadied him with a disapproving frown. "Jonathan, be careful. The doctor said you shouldn't move too much. That concussion needs time to heal."

She turned to Evelyn with thinly veiled irritation. "You may be unharmed, but my son is seriously injured."

"Mom, I already explained everything," Jonathan said firmly. "Evelyn, don't mind her. I'm just relieved you're safe."

Evelyn met Judith's gaze and bowed slightly. "Mrs. Reeves, I'm truly sorry. This is entirely my fault."

"At least you admit it," Judith sniffed. "Jonathan has never been hurt like this before. What if there are complications? He could end up alone because of this."

Evelyn took a deep breath. "If there are any lasting effects, I'll take full responsibility."

Judith's expression softened slightly. "That's more like it, Ms. Carter. You seem like a sensible girl who understands gratitude."

She reached for Evelyn's hand, her grip firm. "Jonathan speaks highly of you. Says you're talented, that you've won awards at his studio."

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "He's too kind. Honestly, I've caused him nothing but trouble."

Judith's eyes gleamed with calculation. "Jonathan has always been popular with women. Even in school, he received love letters every week."

"Mom," Jonathan groaned, embarrassed.

Judith waved him off. "Ms. Carter, forgive my bluntness—but are you seeing anyone?"

Evelyn froze. Was this woman actually trying to set them up?
###Chapter 267

Evelyn forced an uncomfortable smile. "Mrs. Reeves, I'll go wash some fruits."

She seized the opportunity to escape the hospital room, finally able to breathe once the door closed behind her. The earlier conversation had left her feeling suffocated.

As Evelyn left, Jonathan turned to Judith with a frown. "Mom, why did you interrogate Evelyn like that? You know she's private about her past."

"Jonathan, sweetheart, don't be naive. If I don't set expectations now, how can I properly welcome her as my future daughter-in-law?"

"You've praised Evelyn's talents yourself. If I don't establish boundaries, she might take advantage of your kindness."

Jonathan sighed in frustration. "You're imagining things. Evelyn isn't like that."

"I'm protecting you, Jonathan! You got injured because of her. I can tell she has feelings for you."

"If I don't step in as matchmaker, when will you make your move? Should your suffering go unrewarded?"

Judith couldn't bear seeing her son hurt. If Evelyn dared reject him, she wouldn't let it slide.

Leaning back against his pillows, Jonathan said firmly, "Mom, I know what I'm doing. Please stay out of it."

'An orphan like Evelyn should feel honored by your attention. She's clearly playing hard to get.'

Jonathan struggled to explain the truth—Evelyn had reunited with her wealthy biological family.

In fact, they were extraordinarily affluent. But Evelyn kept it quiet, revealing nothing about her background.

Jonathan secretly fantasized—if he won Evelyn's heart, he'd gain a beautiful, wealthy wife.

With her family's connections, expanding his studio would be effortless.

But these thoughts stayed locked away. Judith wouldn't understand, and revealing them might complicate things.

Soon, Evelyn returned with freshly washed fruits. "Jonathan, thank you for saving me."

"It was nothing. I'm just shocked someone would attack you in broad daylight."

"My adoptive parents took bribes from the kidnappers. Thankfully, the police caught them."

Jonathan nodded. "Good. I've been worried sick about you."

Judith seized the moment. "Absolutely! Jonathan barely slept or ate while you were missing."

Evelyn glanced at Jonathan, realizing she needed to clarify things before misunderstandings deepened.

After her visit, Evelyn returned to her own hospital room.

But when she opened the door, she froze—Victoria Sinclair stood inside.

Evelyn's guard went up. "What are you doing here?"

"I heard you almost got sold as a mountain bride. Came to see if it was true. Pity—you look perfectly fine."

"Was this all an act to lure Nathaniel into rescuing you?" Victoria sneered.

She'd heard how Nathaniel mobilized massive resources to find Evelyn. The jealousy burned. Why cancel their engagement only to chase this nobody?

Evelyn smirked. "Victoria, your pettiness reveals your character."

"Don't get cocky, Evelyn. You and Nathaniel come from different worlds. It would never work," Victoria warned.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Says the mistress? You lost your engagement—seems you're destined to remain the other woman."

"As long as I stand my ground, you'll never take my place."
###Chapter 268

Victoria’s words struck a nerve, hitting Evelyn’s sore spot directly.

Furious, Victoria raised her hand. "Evelyn, who do you think you are, calling me a mistress? Just so you know, my brother is also in this hospital. I promise you, you’ll regret making such accusations!"

"I’ve dealt with countless ill-mannered people like you. It’s amusing how you and Aunt Margaret share the same despicable traits."

Without hesitation, Evelyn seized Victoria’s wrist and delivered a sharp slap in return.

Evelyn’s gaze turned icy. "Victoria, you can insult me all you want, but watch your tongue. If I hear you disrespect Aunt Margaret again, I swear you’ll regret it."

Despite Margaret’s timid nature and flaws, she was the one who raised Evelyn, and Evelyn wouldn’t tolerate anyone speaking ill of her.

Victoria stared in shock. "You actually hit me?"

"I’ll hit you whenever I feel like it."

Evelyn’s demeanor turned fierce. She casually picked up a fruit knife from the nearby tray, her voice dangerously calm. "My patience is thin right now. Don’t test me."

"Evelyn, do you realize who I am? I’m the young lady of the Sinclair family! If you lay a finger on me, you won’t leave here unharmed," Victoria threatened.

Evelyn smirked. "So what? There are no surveillance cameras in this room. Besides, I’m still legally Mrs. Whitmore. This is Bern City, not Nord City. What exactly can you do to me here?"

Victoria trembled with rage. "Evelyn, you’re insane—completely insane! Let me tell you, my brother’s company is handling the redevelopment in your old neighborhood."

"Whether you believe it or not, with one call from me, your family’s property will be demolished overnight."

Evelyn remained unfazed. "Oh, if it can’t be redeveloped, then so be it. It’s not a big deal. I’m not exactly desperate for money right now."

Victoria was stunned by Evelyn’s indifference. She had expected panic, desperation—anything but this cold composure.

Wasn’t Evelyn, coming from a modest background, supposed to be begging for the redevelopment?

Casually twirling the fruit knife, Evelyn’s gaze was chillingly calm. "Either way, I’m already in a tough spot. A little more trouble won’t make a difference."

Terrified, Victoria bolted from the room, leaving the hospital ward in silence.

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh softly. Sometimes, embracing a little madness worked in her favor.

Outside, Victoria stormed into Julian’s office, her face still stinging. "Julian, I’ve been humiliated!"

Julian, just back from his rounds, frowned at the red mark on her cheek. "Who hit you?"

Victoria, who had never been one to cry easily, now let tears fall. "Julian, you have to help me. That woman dared to slap me. She has no respect for our family!"

Julian remained composed. "Victoria, you don’t need to make up excuses to provoke me. It won’t change anything."

"When we were kids, you used our family’s influence to bully others. You know that. Why bring up grievances now?"

"Julian, this is different! The one who hit me is Nathaniel’s ex-wife! We’re in Bern City—how could I have provoked her?"

Julian’s expression shifted slightly. "Nathaniel’s ex-wife hit you? Why?"

"She accused me of being a mistress."

"Well, technically, she’s not wrong. I’ve heard Nathaniel hasn’t finalized his divorce yet. And here you are, already engaged to him—doesn’t that sound like a mistress?"

Victoria hesitated before reluctantly admitting, "Julian, the engagement was called off because of you!"
###Chapter 269

Haunted by her broken engagement, Victoria Sinclair tossed and turned in bed, her mind burning with fury.

Everything had been perfect—until that disastrous day, when unforeseen circumstances tore her future apart.

Raising a brow, Julian Montgomery asked coolly, "Because of me?"

"According to Nathaniel, your decision to operate on Grandma Eleanor had nothing to do with me!" Victoria snapped.

Clearing his throat, Julian nodded. "You're right. It wasn't because of you."

Victoria's eyes widened in shock. "Julian, what are you saying?"

"If it's not me, then who? Nathaniel? Since when do you care about him? I thought you despised him!"

"I do."

"Then who?"

She had dug relentlessly for answers, yet the truth remained frustratingly out of reach.

Julian remained composed. "Victoria, some things aren't worth obsessing over."

"But lies can't last forever. Your broken engagement is the consequence of your own deception."

"Julian, fine, I lied. But you still haven’t explained why you agreed to operate on Grandma Eleanor. Who are you doing this for?"

"That’s none of your concern. You should leave."

Tears pricked Victoria’s eyes. "Julian, are you and Alexander hiding something from me? He’s even pressuring me to sign adoption termination papers."

"After all these years as family, why is he suddenly pushing me away?"

Julian hesitated.

Originally, he had planned to tell her after the engagement, but now, with everything falling apart, the truth would have to wait.

Glancing at her, he said, "I don’t want to discuss this now."

With that, he walked out, leaving Victoria standing alone, her mind racing.

Something was wrong—terribly wrong—but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t piece it together.

Just then, Isabelle Laurent approached, offering an ice pack. "This might help."

"Thanks," Victoria muttered, pressing it to her face as she wiped away her smudged tears.

"You're Dr. Montgomery’s sister, aren’t you?" Isabelle asked gently.

Victoria sighed dramatically. "Yes. Lately, he’s been acting like a stranger."

"Ms. Sinclair… I think it might be because he’s seeing someone," Isabelle whispered.

Victoria stiffened. "Julian is in a relationship? Why wasn’t I told?"

Lowering her voice, Isabelle continued, "There’s a woman staying in the ward downstairs. She’s been coming in for treatments—Dr. Montgomery personally oversees her care."

"Yesterday, she was brought back by helicopter. Rumor has it she was kidnapped."

Kidnapped.

A name flashed in Victoria’s mind. "Evelyn Carter?"

Isabelle nodded. "That’s her."

Victoria’s thoughts screeched to a halt.

Then, slowly, she turned to Isabelle. "You’re saying Evelyn visits Julian often?"

"Not just visits. He treats her like she’s special."

"Dr. Montgomery is respected here, but I’ve never seen him show this kind of attention to anyone before. Evelyn is different."

The realization hit Victoria like a punch to the gut.

Without another word, she stormed toward the stairs, determined to uncover the truth.

Silently, she crept to Evelyn’s ward, the door slightly ajar.

Peering inside, she saw Julian standing beside Evelyn’s bed, speaking softly as he peeled an apple for her.

Victoria didn’t need further proof.

Now she understood why Evelyn had grown so bold—why threats about demolishing her old neighborhood hadn’t fazed her.

At last, the truth was clear.
###Chapter 270

Evelyn Carter had not only successfully seduced Nathaniel Whitmore, but now she was also entangled with Julian Montgomery!

This explained why Julian had been so reluctant to reveal his reasons for agreeing to perform surgery for Eleanor earlier.

Could it be because of Evelyn?

All the puzzling mysteries that had eluded Victoria Sinclair suddenly became crystal clear.

Evelyn had orchestrated everything! This shameless woman dared to seduce Julian for her own benefit, showing no remorse whatsoever!

Victoria's fingers twitched with the urge to burst through the door and expose Evelyn's true colors. Yet she restrained herself at the last moment.

If she confronted them now, Evelyn would surely conjure up countless excuses.

Victoria needed a comprehensive plan - one decisive revelation that would settle everything permanently.

Inside the hospital room, Evelyn suddenly glanced toward the window.

Julian followed her gaze. "Something wrong?"

"Nothing." She shook her head. "Just my imagination playing tricks."

She'd felt someone watching, but perhaps it was just a passing nurse.

Julian handed her a sliced apple. "Evelyn, Nathaniel went out of his way to help you this time. His attitude seems... unusual."

Evelyn's expression turned awkward. "Julian, the only reason Nathaniel helped is because of Eleanor's influence."

"She's always been kind to me. If anything happened to me under his watch, she'd hold him accountable."

"Is that truly the only reason?" Julian pressed.

Evelyn nodded firmly. "What else could it be?"

The idea that Nathaniel still cared for her seemed impossible. He'd been more than eager to finalize their divorce and erase her from his life completely.

Seeing Evelyn's apparent indifference toward Nathaniel, Julian felt relieved. Her emotional detachment might protect her from further heartbreak.

"I want to go home tonight," Evelyn announced suddenly. "I can't stand another minute in this hospital."

"Of course," Julian agreed immediately. "Resting at home would be better. Call me immediately if you feel unwell."

Evelyn nodded obediently. Within the hour, discharge papers were signed, and she was finally free from the sterile confines.

Julian escorted her to the parking lot, one protective hand hovering near her elbow.

From a shadowed corner, Victoria watched them leave, her gaze turning glacial. "Evelyn," she murmured, "you're full of secrets, aren't you?"

Her assistant nodded. "Ms. Sinclair, Evelyn probably met Julian through Harrison."

"I know," Victoria snapped. "That woman only knows how to climb using men. This time, I'll make sure she falls hard."

A cruel plan was already forming in her mind.

Inside the taxi, Evelyn suddenly sneezed. Was she catching a cold? Shrugging it off, she gave the driver her address.

When Evelyn arrived home, Margaret Dawson burst into tears. "Evelyn! This is all my fault! I should have been more vigilant - I never imagined Walter and Beverly would conspire to hurt you like this!"

"How could they plot to send you into the wilderness? No one could survive those conditions!"

Evelyn hugged her adoptive aunt. "I'm fine, see? With my brothers protecting me, nothing bad will happen."

"This time, Walter and Beverly must face consequences," Margaret declared fiercely. "They won't trouble you again."

Evelyn blinked in surprise at Margaret's uncharacteristic assertiveness. The older woman had always advocated forgiveness before.

"Evelyn, I made your favorite chicken soup," Margaret said, wiping her eyes. "Eat well and regain your strength. These past days must have been terrifying."

Evelyn obediently sipped the soup, her free hand drifting unconsciously to her still-flat stomach.

Just as she finished, Alexander and Olivia Montgomery arrived. "Evelyn," Alexander said gravely, "we need to talk."
###Chapter 271

The tense expressions on Alexander and Olivia's faces made Evelyn wonder if they were about to bring up the recent kidnapping attempt orchestrated by Walter and Beverly.

A flicker of unease passed through her. Setting down her teacup, Evelyn asked, "What did you want to talk about?"

Alexander cleared his throat. "Olivia and I have been discussing this for some time. Would you consider returning to Nord City and living with us?"

Olivia, seated beside Evelyn, gave her and Margaret a reassuring smile. "Don’t worry. If you decide to come back with us, the entire family will relocate together."

"We’ll arrange for Benjamin to be transferred to a hospital there. In Nord City, you’ll all be well taken care of."

Evelyn instinctively glanced at Margaret, whose expression remained unreadable.

Given that Evelyn was carrying Nathaniel’s child, returning to Nord City for safety reasons had crossed her mind.

But Margaret had spent her entire life in Bern City. Uprooting her completely wouldn’t be an easy decision.

Margaret hesitated before speaking. "I need some time to think about this."

Evelyn gently squeezed her hand. "Don’t let me influence your choice. I’ll stay by your side no matter where you decide to go."

"Just like we promised before—I’ll take care of you and Uncle Benjamin in your old age. That hasn’t changed."

After the tragedy that took Margaret and Benjamin’s only child, Evelyn had become the last remaining family they had left.

She knew Margaret wouldn’t stand in her way if she chose to return to Nord City. But Evelyn had no intention of leaving her behind.

Alexander interjected, "There’s no need to rush. We have time to figure this out."

"Evelyn, after what happened with your adoptive parents, Olivia and I feel responsible for not protecting you better."

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "This wasn’t your fault. I’m sure Walter and Beverly won’t dare cause trouble again after this."

Alexander’s gaze hardened. "You’re right. They won’t be a problem anymore."

This time, Evelyn’s adoptive family would face severe consequences. They’d likely spend the rest of their lives behind bars.

Soon after, Evelyn’s brothers arrived at the house. Seeing her safe, they finally relaxed.

As Evelyn yawned, everyone began to disperse.

Alexander led his brothers outside, his expression stern as he turned to Andrew. "We need to handle Evelyn’s legal separation from her adoptive parents properly this time."

"Don’t worry, Alexander. I’ve already sent someone to negotiate with them. If they want to protect their son, Edward, they’ll have to agree to the termination terms."

At first, the Montgomery brothers hadn’t paid much attention to Walter and Beverly, focusing only on rebuilding their relationship with Evelyn.

But their audacity had shocked them. This time, they were determined to end the problem for good.

Retreating to her room, Evelyn lay down, replaying the terrifying experience of her kidnapping in her mind.

It all felt like a nightmare.

Closing her eyes, she drifted into another dream—Nathaniel descending gracefully from a helicopter, dressed in tactical gear.

He stood beside a van, silently extending his hand toward her.

Her heart raced at the sight of his outstretched palm.

The next morning, Evelyn woke with the dream still fresh in her mind. She splashed cold water on her face, determined not to let Nathaniel’s kindness sway her.

After all, Evelyn and Nathaniel came from entirely different worlds.
###Chapter 272

Evelyn Carter had to maintain strict control over her emotions, especially since she planned to keep Nathaniel Whitmore from discovering she carried his child.

If he ever found out, he might demand she terminate the pregnancy. He'd made his stance on children painfully clear before.

This thought jolted Evelyn fully awake. Her fingers trembled as they brushed against her still-flat abdomen.

No matter what challenges lay ahead, Evelyn was determined to protect this baby and bring it safely into the world.

After dressing in fresh clothes, her phone buzzed with a call from Julian Montgomery. "Evelyn, your prenatal appointment is scheduled for this afternoon. Don't forget."

"I know. My classes are packed today, but I'll make time later."

Scanning her schedule, Evelyn realized her weekdays were completely booked with back-to-back lectures.

Textbooks in hand, she headed to campus. Though only a weekend had passed, it felt like months had slipped by.

At least the recent chaos had finally settled down.

Evelyn slipped into her usual seat just as Professor Elizabeth Hartwell made an announcement. "Students, we have a mandatory event this afternoon."

"Vista Properties is establishing a scholarship foundation at Halvard University."

"Going forward, outstanding students may qualify for Vista-sponsored scholarships. Let's all strive for this opportunity!"

Vista Properties?

Evelyn's mind flashed to her childhood neighborhood's redevelopment - a project deeply entangled with Vista Properties. Why did this company keep appearing in her life?

Though technically, it was Victoria Sinclair's family enterprise.

Last time, Victoria had gone so far as to threaten Evelyn over the redevelopment project.

Still, Evelyn wasn't one to be easily intimidated.

Professor Hartwell approached her directly. "Evelyn, Vista is assembling a project team. Given your exceptional skills, we're recommending you join alongside a faculty representative."

"Students from multiple universities will participate. It's a chance for Halvard to shine."

"Additionally, you could advocate for increased investment in our department - better equipment, more opportunities."

Evelyn hesitated. "Professor Hartwell, may I have time to consider?"

While she might have welcomed such an opportunity with any other company, Vista Properties made her uneasy.

She wanted nothing to do with Victoria or her family.

Despite Vista's professional reputation, Evelyn couldn't forget Victoria's underhanded tactics during the recent Fleur International Design Competition.

Though Evelyn had ultimately triumphed, she had no desire to waste energy on unnecessary drama.

"Evelyn, this is an incredible opportunity."

"As our Fleur Competition gold medalist, declining might reflect poorly on Halvard."

"Please share any concerns. The university will support you however we can."

Evelyn struggled to articulate her reservations without sounding petty.

It wasn't fear of Victoria - just profound annoyance at the situation.

After a deep breath, Evelyn relented. "Very well, I'll join the project team."

She would face this challenge head-on.

During lunch break, Sophia Bennett - who had no afternoon classes - accompanied Evelyn to Vista's scholarship foundation ceremony.

The moment they entered the venue, Evelyn caught a whiff of overpowering perfume. She didn't need to look to know its source.

Only Penelope Whitmore would drown herself in such a cloying scent.

Turning, Evelyn's suspicion was confirmed - Penelope stood arm-in-arm with Victoria.

Sophia grimaced. "Evelyn, isn't that the insufferable woman from the mall last week?"

Evelyn nodded, realizing fate had a twisted sense of humor.
###Chapter 273

The confrontation came sooner than Evelyn had expected.

Victoria Sinclair stood before her, eyes flashing with barely concealed hostility.

Penelope Whitmore smirked, inserting herself between them. "Evelyn, this event is hosted by Vista Properties. Victoria's family empire. She's in charge tonight—and she'll be giving the keynote speech."

Victoria tilted her chin up, her posture dripping with superiority. The humiliation from their last encounter still burned fresh in her memory.

Evelyn arched a brow, her voice cool. "Fascinating."

Penelope's smile turned sharp. "You should be nervous. With Victoria running things, don't even dream about that scholarship."

Evelyn's lips curled. "The scholarship isn't my priority. But Victoria, as the host, aren't you worried about the scandal if people find out you're rigging the results?"

Victoria's laugh was icy. "Who would believe you? I'm a Sinclair. Pulling strings is effortless for me. There won't be a single trace left behind—what can you possibly do?"

Penelope covered her mouth, giggling. "Exactly! But Evelyn, we're not cruel. Kneel and apologize, and maybe we'll reconsider."

"One word from Victoria, and that scholarship could still be yours."

Evelyn remained silent, unshaken.

Sophia Bennett, however, couldn't stay quiet. "You should be ashamed! What if this gets out? Do you really think you'll walk away unscathed?"

Penelope rolled her eyes. "Oh please. Who would take the word of a nobody like you?"

Evelyn's expression darkened. "You'd be surprised."

She pulled out her phone, waving it lightly. "I recorded everything. Imagine the uproar if this went viral. It'd make your little scandal look tame, Penelope."

Victoria's face paled. Penelope lunged for the phone, but Evelyn stepped back, tucking it away.

"Too late. It's already backed up. Destroying my phone won't help you."

Penelope's jaw clenched. "You wouldn't dare."

"Watch me."

Evelyn unlocked her phone, fingers hovering over her social media.

Victoria grabbed her wrist, panic flickering in her eyes. "Stop."

Evelyn smirked. "Why? Feeling nervous?"

Victoria swallowed hard. "What do you want?"

If Alexander saw this, her reputation would be ruined. She couldn't afford another blow—not after nearly losing her place in the company.

Evelyn spun her phone between her fingers. "Simple. Apologize for your threats, and I won't post it."

Penelope scoffed. "Apologize? Are you insane?"

She turned to Victoria. "Don't let her scare you. You're a Sinclair. Your brother would never believe her over you. We can just say the video's fake."
###Chapter 274

Victoria's eyes flashed with irritation as she labeled Penelope as the perpetual source of ridiculous schemes.

If not for their shared last name "Whitmore," Victoria would have cut ties with Penelope long ago.

Taking a steadying breath, Victoria turned to Evelyn. "I was only joking earlier. Did you actually believe I meant it?"

"My brother despises any form of manipulation or interference in professional matters. I would never stoop to such behavior."

Standing beside Victoria, Penelope clenched her fists in frustration. Why did Victoria have to show weakness in front of Evelyn?

Sophia scoffed. "Ms. Sinclair, what’s your problem? If you don’t know how to apologize, let me teach you. An apology requires saying the words 'I’m sorry'!"

Victoria was nearing her limit.

Evelyn glanced around. "With the crowd growing, I was considering uploading the video to the campus network right before the scholarship ceremony."

"Imagine revealing the backdoor dealings at such a pivotal moment—wouldn’t that be entertaining?"

Victoria finally relented. "Evelyn, I spoke out of turn earlier. I shouldn’t have made such a joke. I sincerely apologize."

"Victoria, did you just apologize?" Penelope couldn’t believe her ears.

She glared at Evelyn. "I won’t apologize to you. If you want to release the video, go ahead. My reputation is already ruined because of you. One more scandal won’t break me."

Evelyn’s smirk widened. "Is that so? Then I won’t hold back."

A chill ran down Victoria’s spine. "But Evelyn, I’ve already apologized."

Evelyn’s gaze turned icy. "You were both involved. This is collective punishment."

Furious, Victoria yanked Penelope aside and hissed, "Penelope, didn’t you want me to introduce you to Sebastian?"

"Let me remind you—Sebastian despises women who engage in underhanded tactics. If he finds out about this, any chance with him will vanish."

"No, please!"

The mention of Sebastian shattered Penelope’s defiance. He was the man she had set her sights on.

Victoria feigned helplessness. "I’ve said all I can. The choice is yours."

"But Victoria, why should we fear Evelyn? Won’t your brother support you?"

"Penelope, this is my personal matter. If I keep relying on my brother to clean up my messes, won’t I seem incompetent? I refuse to leave that impression."

Grudgingly, Penelope approached Evelyn. "I apologize."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "That’s the most insincere apology I’ve ever heard."

Biting back her anger, Penelope forced out, "I genuinely apologize! Happy now?"

Evelyn tugged Sophia’s arm, radiating indifference. "Barely passable. Let’s hope there’s no next time. Come on, Sophia."

"Wait."

Victoria blocked their path. "Evelyn, we’ve apologized. Now delete the video."

Penelope nodded. "We won’t feel safe until it’s gone."

Evelyn’s lips curled. "No need."

Victoria paled. "Evelyn, are you going back on your word? Provoking the Sinclair family isn’t a game you can win."

"At worst, I’ll just apologize to my brother and end this quickly."

Evelyn waved her phone lazily. "What I mean is, there’s nothing to delete. I didn’t record anything."
###Chapter 275

The moment Evelyn revealed the truth, she immediately noticed the shift in Victoria and Penelope's expressions.

Their faces darkened with barely contained fury.

Penelope's voice trembled with outrage. "Evelyn, how dare you play us for fools?"

A smirk curled Evelyn's lips. "Oh, but I did. And you both played your parts perfectly. Can't handle the truth?"

Penelope's hands clenched into fists, her body tensing as if ready to strike.

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning indifference. "Think carefully before you act. There are witnesses everywhere. Do you really want to explain why you assaulted me in public?"

"I don't owe anyone an explanation!" Penelope snapped.

Victoria intervened, gripping Penelope's arm. "Let's go. We have more important matters than wasting time on her."

Evelyn had a point. As a public figure at this event, Penelope couldn't afford a scandal.

Victoria found Evelyn infuriating. Being with Julian had clearly made her bolder. But her victory wouldn't last.

As the two women stormed off, Evelyn finally looked away.

Beside her, Sophia burst into laughter. "Oh my god, Evelyn, that was priceless!"

"The look on their faces when you admitted there was no recording—absolutely classic."

Evelyn's smile turned icy. "Sometimes, being ruthless is the only way to survive."

"True," Sophia agreed. "But Evelyn, what about that woman with Penelope? The one who reeks of fake sweetness?"

"Victoria Sinclair. Sister of the owner of Vista Properties."

Sophia's eyes widened. "Wait—the one who was desperate to marry your ex-husband?"

"That's her."

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Though my marriage to Nathaniel ended abruptly too."

A question still nagged at her. Why had Nathaniel called off his engagement with Victoria?

Hadn't he worried her brother would refuse to perform Eleanor's surgery out of spite?

She had asked Nathaniel at the hospital, but their conversation had been interrupted by her brothers.

"Evelyn," Sophia said hesitantly, "you handled that well, but aren't you worried about retaliation? These elite families don’t take humiliation lightly."

"Sophia, trouble finds me whether I provoke it or not."

"Besides, I plan to return to Nord City after graduation. The Whitmores won’t matter to me anymore."

Evelyn had already arranged to leave Bern City once she completed her credits—just in time before her pregnancy became obvious.

She intended to give birth in Nord City, where her child would be safe.

Sophia hugged her. "I’m glad you’ll be back home. I’ll visit you all the time."

"You’re always welcome."

Evelyn considered telling Sophia about the baby but decided against it. That revelation could wait.

Her thoughts drifted back to Eleanor’s surgery, her fingers tightening around her clutch.

Hours later, the scholarship foundation ceremony concluded.

Victoria, as the representative, gave a polished speech, basking in the audience’s admiration.

Evelyn didn’t stay. She and Sophia slipped out of the auditorium.

She had only attended to fulfill her sociology requirement.

"Evelyn, wait!"

Penelope caught up, her tone dripping with false sweetness. "Leaving so soon? We’re dining with the university board. You should join us."
###Chapter 276



"Sorry, I'm busy." Evelyn said flatly.

She had no interest in joining the group for dinner or socializing. Not when she was carrying a child.

"Evelyn, this is a major project for our college. Don't you care at all?" Penelope pressed, frustration creeping into her voice.

"Not my problem," Evelyn replied coolly, her expression unreadable.

Penelope clenched her fists. It was like Evelyn had become an entirely different person—untouchable, indifferent, impossible to manipulate.

"Evelyn, don’t let arrogance ruin you," Penelope hissed.

"Honestly, I find it amusing watching you all seethe when you can’t stand me but can’t do a thing about it. Bye!" With a smirk, Evelyn turned on her heel and walked away.

Penelope’s face burned with fury.

She whirled toward Victoria, voice sharp. "Did you see that? She just walked out on us! Since when did Evelyn become so untouchable? She dismissed us like we’re nothing!"

Victoria’s expression darkened. She knew exactly where Evelyn’s newfound confidence came from—her entanglement with both Nathaniel and Harrison.

She had underestimated Evelyn’s cunning, but she wouldn’t make that mistake again.

Without hesitation, Victoria pulled out her phone and dialed. "Mr. Harrison? It’s Victoria. I heard Vista Properties is planning a major redevelopment project in Bern City."

"I’d love to get some firsthand experience. Would it be possible for me to visit the branch office and observe?"

On the other end, Maxwell answered smoothly. "Of course, Ms. Sinclair. You’re welcome anytime."

"Perfect. I’ll be there soon."

Hanging up, Victoria’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Let’s see how long Evelyn stays this arrogant."

Penelope grinned. "This is perfect. If that demolition project falls through, she’ll be crawling back to us on her knees."



Victoria scoffed. Did Evelyn really think someone of her background could compete with her?

Meanwhile, Evelyn returned home to find her three brothers lounging on the couch, all watching her expectantly.

She paused. "Chris, Andrew, Daniel… what’s going on?"

Daniel grinned. "Guess what? I just won a million dollars in the lottery."

Evelyn blinked. "Seriously?"

She hadn’t expected such luck in her own family. Smiling, she said, "Congratulations, Daniel."

He waved it off. "Not a big deal. I invested it all in Harrison’s entertainment company. It’s about to go public—so I’m basically rich now."

He smirked, then added, "Oh, and Andrew started his own business. It’s doing pretty well."

Andrew nodded. "I opened a chain of piano academies in Nord City. It’s franchising now, so money’s not an issue."

Evelyn feigned envy. "Damn, why is everyone getting rich except me? But honestly, I’m happy for you guys."

Daniel ruffled her hair affectionately. "From now on, you don’t have to worry about anything. Come back to Nord City with us and live the easy life."

After the kidnapping, Daniel had noticed how guarded Evelyn had become.

No more pretending. He’d make sure she never had to struggle again.
###Chapter 277

The moment had come.

After lengthy discussions with Andrew and Christopher, Daniel and his brothers reached a unanimous decision—it was time to drop their pretense of financial struggle.

Evelyn deserved to know they could be her unshakable pillars of support.

Christopher nodded in agreement with Andrew's words. "Evelyn, your brothers and I are now in a stable financial position. Sebastian's company has also successfully gone public."

"With these developments, our family is no longer lacking in resources. From now on, you can buy whatever your heart desires without hesitation."

Evelyn was momentarily speechless, overwhelmed by their sincerity. "Then I’ll work even harder," she finally said. "I want to become a renowned designer—someone who won’t be a burden to any of you."

Hearing her determined words, Daniel felt his eyes sting. They had hoped she would lean on them, but her fierce independence and ambition left them both surprised and deeply moved.

How could she be so relentlessly hardworking and yet so utterly endearing?

As dusk settled, Alexander, Sebastian, and Julian returned home to find Evelyn preparing a celebratory feast in their honor.

Raising her teacup, she beamed. "Tonight, I toast to my brothers with tea instead of wine. May your paths to success be swift and prosperous. Cheers!"

Though Alexander was slightly irked that his younger brothers had acted without consulting him, seeing Evelyn’s radiant happiness made him question whether keeping his own wealth a secret had been the right choice.

Olivia gently took Evelyn’s hand. "Darling, leave the pursuit of wealth to your brothers. Like me, you should enjoy the comforts of home and indulge in shopping."

"There’s no need for you to exhaust yourself. You’re the treasured princess of this family."

Alexander nodded firmly. "Exactly. Once you return to Nord City with us, you won’t have to work so hard anymore."

Then, without warning, Daniel slid a bank card across the table. "Evelyn, there’s enough here to pay off your mortgage. I have more than enough to spare."

One by one, the Montgomery brothers followed suit, each presenting her with their own cards. "Consider this our heartfelt gesture," Julian said softly. "Please accept it."

Evelyn stared at the six gleaming cards, momentarily stunned. After a brief pause, she smiled and gathered them all. "Alright, I won’t hold back then."



She understood their intentions—this was their way of making amends. Rejecting their generosity would only hurt them.

Truthfully, Evelyn had long let go of past grievances. She had fully embraced the joy of having brothers who cherished her.

Later that night, after her usual routine, Evelyn laid the six bank cards on her dresser.

A thought crossed her mind—Victoria’s endless bragging about her own brothers. With a smirk, Evelyn snapped a photo and posted it on her social media with the caption: Life’s ultimate goal: Work hard today, be a wealthy woman tomorrow.

A satisfied smile curved her lips. Now, she too had brothers who spoiled her relentlessly.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel had just finished a grueling meeting. As he scrolled through his notifications, Evelyn’s latest post caught his eye.

Against his better judgment, he tapped on her profile and saw the photo of the bank cards.

His expression darkened as he read her caption. Since when had Evelyn’s values become so materialistic?

What unsettled him more was Eleanor’s immediate like and comment: "Well said, darling."

Nathaniel’s grip on his phone tightened.

Before he could process his irritation, Eleanor’s call came through. He adjusted his tie and answered with forced calm. "Hello, Grandmother."

"Nathaniel, I never took you for the romantic type," Eleanor teased.

His brows furrowed. "What do you mean?"

"I saw Evelyn’s post. Those bank cards are from you, aren’t they? Now that she’s expecting, you should spoil her more."

"While Evelyn isn’t materialistic, every woman adores thoughtful surprises from her husband."
###Chapter 278



Eleanor Whitmore's words sent Nathaniel into a rage. With a sharp tug, he ripped off his tie, the silk fabric crumpling in his fist.

Evelyn actually thought he was the one who gave her those bank cards in the photo?

The realization stung. He had trusted her, only for her to flaunt such recklessness. Clearly, they needed to talk.

"Nat, I believe in you. Don't disappoint me," Eleanor teased, her voice laced with amusement.

But Nathaniel found no comfort in her words. Instead, frustration coiled tighter in his chest.

Clutching his phone, he stormed out of the study. The villa’s halls were as familiar as ever, yet something—or rather, someone—was missing.

Back in his bedroom, he fired off a text to Evelyn: "Care to explain your Instagram post?"

Evelyn had just finished her nighttime routine, her skin still warm from the shower, when the notification lit up her screen.

She blinked. Hadn’t they unfollowed each other?

Then it hit her—she’d re-followed him to return the hundred thousand dollars Julian had taken. Nathaniel had never accepted the transfer.

But why was he messaging her now, his tone icy?

Her fingers flew across the screen. "If you can’t figure it out, why bother looking?"

His reply was immediate. "Who gave you those six cards?"

She smirked. "Six different men, obviously."

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. The memory of those well-dressed men at the hospital—undoubtedly from the Montgomery family—flashed in his mind.

Something wasn’t adding up.

He meant to call her, but his thumb slipped, hitting the video button instead.

Evelyn’s breath hitched when the invitation popped up. In three years of marriage, Nathaniel had never video-called her.

But then she remembered the mountains, the terror of being kidnapped—how he’d come for her without hesitation.

Swallowing hard, she answered. "Hello. What do you want?"

Nathaniel froze. He hadn’t expected her to pick up.

The screen showed Evelyn propped against her headboard, damp hair curling over the straps of her silk camisole. His gaze darkened.

"Don’t play dumb," he said, voice rough. "You know why I’m calling."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Enlighten me."

"I never took you for someone so shallow."

She laughed, sharp and bitter. "Really? Took you long enough. I’ve always valued appearances. Handsome face, good values—that’s why I fell for you."

Nathaniel stiffened.

"And now?" he asked quietly.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone. Even through the screen, he was unfairly attractive.

"What do you mean, now?"

"You said you loved me."

"That was then." She forced a smirk. "Plenty of fish in the sea, Nathaniel. If one doesn’t work out, I’ll find another."

The words twisted like a knife in his chest.

Evelyn’s view on love was fickle—one moment burning hot, the next ice-cold.

Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Finally, Nathaniel changed tactics. "Evelyn. What’s really going on between you and Julian?"
###Chapter 279

Evelyn recognized that familiar tone in Nathaniel's voice—the one laced with arrogance and interrogation. His piercing gaze hadn't changed one bit.

She ran her fingers through her still-damp hair, a playful smirk tugging at her lips. "Why don't you figure it out yourself?"

Nathaniel's eyes flickered, catching the subtle shift in her posture.

Her hair tumbled over one shoulder, and the delicate strap of her silk nightgown slipped, baring a tantalizing expanse of sun-kissed skin that gleamed under the dim glow of her bedside lamp.

The sight was undeniably provocative.

Nathaniel stiffened, caught off guard.

His throat tightened, his stare darkening. Was she doing this on purpose?

Yet Evelyn seemed entirely unaware of the effect she was having.

When Nathaniel fell silent during their video call, she tilted her head. "Anything else? If not, I'm hanging up."

"Evelyn," he bit out, "you still haven't answered me. Don't think dressing like this will distract me. Even if you stripped right now, it wouldn’t work."

What was he talking about? She was just wearing a normal nightgown.

Glancing down, Evelyn gasped. The strap had slipped completely off her shoulder.

One wrong move, and she would’ve been exposed. Heat flooded her cheeks as she abruptly ended the call.

Fumbling, she yanked the strap back into place, then buried her face in her hands, mortified.

Did that insufferable man really think she was trying to seduce him?

The audacity!

She wanted to drag Nathaniel by the collar and scream at him. Who in their right mind would try to lure him in like this?

But she let it go. In a few months, once she finished her studies and her pregnancy became more noticeable, she’d leave for Nord City to have the baby.

If she was leaving anyway, why waste energy on Nathaniel?

The next morning, Evelyn had planned to go for her prenatal checkup.

But Julian texted, saying he had an appointment in the morning and suggested she come in the afternoon.

Right now, Julian was the only person she fully trusted.

Without him there, the checkup would feel incomplete. So she agreed to reschedule.

Instead, Evelyn decided to visit Eleanor at the private hospital. Eleanor had left a cryptic comment on her social media post yesterday.

Given Nathaniel’s recent decision to call off his engagement with Victoria, Evelyn needed to confirm whether Eleanor’s surgery was still happening as planned.

Before heading to the hospital, she picked up fresh flowers and a basket of fruit.

As she neared Eleanor’s room, muffled voices drifted into the hallway.

Peering through the slightly ajar door, she spotted doctors and nurses gathered inside. Had something gone wrong?

Panic seized her. She rushed in, calling out, "Grandma Eleanor!"

Then she froze.

Among the medical staff stood Julian—wearing a white coat.

What was he doing here?

Earlier, when Julian mentioned his morning commitment, Evelyn assumed it was a surgery. But she never expected to find him here.

Was he switching careers?

Julian’s expression faltered when he saw her. This was not how he wanted her to find out.

Today, he was overseeing Eleanor’s pre-op evaluations.

Given the complexity of her upcoming procedure, it required extensive tests and a detailed surgical plan.

Julian had deliberately scheduled this visit early, intending to return to Evelyn later.

But fate had other plans.

His stomach twisted. Was this the moment his secret would unravel?

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. Would Julian discover the truth about her and Nathaniel today?
###Chapter 280



Julian and Evelyn exchanged uneasy glances, their eyes flickering with unspoken tension.

Eleanor broke the silence first, waving at Evelyn with a warm smile. "Evelyn, darling! Don't just linger by the door—come in."

Forcing a polite smile, Evelyn reluctantly stepped forward. Her gaze briefly caught the fresh flowers in the vase before she turned to Eleanor. "How have you been feeling lately?"

"I’ve been quite well," Eleanor replied, taking Evelyn’s hand and studying her closely. "But you, my dear, look more exhausted than last time. Is your workload too demanding?"

Evelyn cleared her throat softly. "Not exactly. I’ve actually gained some weight recently."

She had been meticulously watching her diet, terrified that any noticeable change might reveal the secret she carried—her growing belly, the undeniable proof of her pregnancy.

"Gained weight?" Eleanor frowned, shaking her head. "Nonsense. You look thinner, if anything."

She squeezed Evelyn’s hand gently. "Remember, you're not just caring for yourself anymore. There’s a little one depending on you now. Don’t push yourself too hard."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Please, Eleanor, don’t say another word.

Running into Julian today had already been disastrous.

And now, Eleanor had unwittingly exposed her secret. How could she possibly explain this to Julian?

With a strained smile, Evelyn replied, "My workload isn’t too heavy, really."

Eleanor tutted. "Evelyn, I have no issue with you working, but circumstances have changed. You must prioritize your health. After the baby arrives, there will be plenty of time to return to your career."

She winked playfully. "I could even speak to Nathaniel about securing you a designer position at Whitmore Enterprises. As the young Mrs. Whitmore, no one would dare mistreat you."

Evelyn’s heart sank.

There was no salvaging this now. Eleanor had shattered the careful illusion Evelyn had maintained in front of Julian.



Evelyn refused to look in Julian’s direction, her stomach twisting with dread.

Instead, she kept her focus on Eleanor. "Grandmother, I understand. Please don’t worry about me."

Eleanor nodded firmly. "I know you value your independence, but I’ll speak to Nathaniel. When you’re ready to return, he’ll ensure you’re well taken care of. It’s settled."

Evelyn sighed inwardly. "We’ll discuss it when the time comes."

What Eleanor didn’t know was that Evelyn wouldn’t even be in Bern City by then.

Of course, she couldn’t reveal that now.

If the Whitmores discovered her pregnancy, escaping would become impossible—and protecting her child even harder.

Julian finally spoke up, his voice tight. "Grandmother, your checkup is finished. You should rest now."

Eleanor nodded, and the butler promptly ushered the medical team out.

Evelyn risked a glance at Julian, her anxiety spiking. How was she going to explain this?

Moments later, her phone buzzed with a message from Julian:

"Meet me outside. Now."

Evelyn exhaled shakily. There was no avoiding this conversation.

Sooner or later, this confrontation was inevitable.

After lingering a few more minutes with Eleanor, Evelyn excused herself, claiming she wanted to wash some fruit.

Tray in hand, she stepped out of the room—and found Julian waiting, his expression unreadable.

Without preamble, he demanded, "Evelyn. What exactly is your relationship with Nathaniel Whitmore?"
###Chapter 281

Evelyn let out a weary sigh as her gaze swept across the hospital corridor. "Julian, come with me. We need to talk privately."

"Do we really have to move? Can't we just speak here?" Julian's face twisted with visible reluctance, his fingers tightening around his medical clipboard.

With gentle insistence, Evelyn tugged at the sleeve of his white coat. "Please, Julian. This isn't the right place. We might disturb Grandma Eleanor."

After a tense moment, Julian finally relented.

She led him to a secluded corner at the far end of the hallway. Lowering her voice, Evelyn began nervously, "Julian, let me explain..."

"Yeah, I'm all ears." Julian's jaw tightened. "Tell me everything about your relationship with Nathaniel, and whose child you're carrying."

Evelyn drew a shaky breath before confessing, "By now you must have guessed... the baby is Nathaniel's."

"What?" Julian's face darkened instantly. "That bastard forced himself on you? I swear to God, I'll make him pay for this!"

Seeing Julian's mounting rage, Evelyn quickly grabbed his arm. "Julian, please calm down!"

"Calm down? After what he did to you?" Julian's eyes burned with fury. His mind raced with violent scenarios of revenge against Nathaniel Whitmore.

Evelyn's pulse quickened at his reaction. "Just listen to me first!"

"There's nothing to explain! Evelyn, you should go home. Once I deal with Nathaniel, I'll take you back to Northridge myself. No one will ever hurt you again."

"Julian, it's not what you think!"

He turned to her with protective determination. "Evelyn, you don't have to be afraid anymore. Before, you were alone and vulnerable. But now you have six brothers who would burn the world for you."

"Andrew's a lawyer - he'll make sure Nathaniel rots in prison for what he's done."

Evelyn winced at his words. "Julian, I don't think the law applies here..."

"Sexual harassment is a crime, Evelyn! It doesn't matter if he's the CEO of Whitmore Enterprises or the damn president!"

Clearing her throat, Evelyn admitted quietly, "We're still legally married, Julian. The baby was conceived during our marriage. Technically... it wasn't harassment."

The revelation hit Julian like a physical blow. He staggered back against the wall, his face draining of color.

"Julian!" Evelyn rushed to steady him.

"I'm... I'm fine," he managed, though his voice shook. "Just trying to process this. You're telling me you're married to Nathaniel Whitmore?"

Evelyn nodded meekly.

"Why didn't you tell us something this important? Were you planning to hide this forever if I hadn't discovered your pregnancy?"

"It... it was an arranged marriage," Evelyn whispered. "I never wanted anyone to know about our relationship."

"Evelyn, we're your family!" Julian's voice cracked with emotion. "You should have come to us!"
###Chapter 282

The realization hit Julian like a tidal wave—the woman who had married the comatose Nathaniel all those years ago was none other than Evelyn, his own sister!

A storm of emotions raged within him. Anger. Regret. Guilt.

Victoria had wanted to marry Nathaniel but was stopped by Alexander. In the end, she had given up, likely assuming Nathaniel wouldn’t survive.

Then, the Whitmores announced someone had agreed to the marriage.

Now, Julian wished they had found Evelyn sooner. If only they had known…

Evelyn’s voice trembled with remorse. "I know I was wrong. We weren’t close at first, so I didn’t know how to tell you. And we were already considering divorce—I thought it would be better to just let it go."

Besides, the Whitmores were one of the most powerful families in Bern City.

She hadn’t wanted to burden her brothers with the mess.

She lifted her gaze, eyes glistening. "I’m sorry. I should have told you."

Julian exhaled deeply, his hand gently resting on her head. "Don’t apologize. We’re the ones who failed you. If we had found you earlier… you wouldn’t have suffered like this."

What was done couldn’t be undone. He couldn’t bring himself to blame her.

No wonder Nathaniel had moved so swiftly when he learned of her kidnapping.

After a tense discussion, Julian and Alexander agreed—they would keep a close watch on Nathaniel, who clearly still had feelings for Evelyn.

Who could have guessed? Married for three years. And with a child.

Julian’s gaze darkened as he studied her. "Evelyn… did the Whitmores let you go knowing you were pregnant?"

She shook her head. "They didn’t believe me. Mrs. Whitmore only agreed to the surgery if I got pregnant. I had to lie, but they thought I was faking it. So I played along."

The full picture was finally clear.

Julian’s jaw tightened. "Disgusting. Evelyn, were you forced into this marriage?"

"No." Her voice was firm. "I chose it. Because I loved him."

His hands clenched. Every word was a knife to his heart.

She forced a weak smile. "I’ve decided to move on. But I have to keep up appearances until Mrs. Whitmore’s surgery is over. She’s been kind to me."

Julian hesitated. "Evelyn… are you sure you can let him go? If not… maybe you shouldn’t keep the baby."

Her fingers curled protectively over her stomach. "I want this child, Julian. Before I found you all, this baby was my only family. I won’t abandon them just because I have you now."

His heart shattered.

The thought of her, alone, with only this unborn child as her anchor—it was unbearable.

He pulled her into a tight embrace, his voice rough. "Alright. Keep the baby."

Whatever she asked, he would give.

They owed her that much. More than they could ever repay.

Evelyn buried her face against his shoulder, discreetly wiping away tears.

At least he understood.

Then—a prickle of awareness.

Someone was watching.

The weight of that gaze made her skin crawl.
###Chapter 283

Evelyn lifted her gaze to find Nathaniel standing a short distance away, his eyes glinting with something dark and unreadable.

Her breath caught in her throat.

Why was Nathaniel here? The timing couldn’t have been worse.

If Julian spotted him, the situation would spiral out of control.

Thinking fast, Evelyn tugged Julian’s arm sharply, pulling his attention away from the corridor where Nathaniel stood.

A distraction—she needed one now.

"Julian," she said quickly, "I almost forgot to ask—how is Mrs. Whitmore Senior doing? Why are you the one handling her examination today?"

The question caught him off guard, a flicker of guilt crossing his face. "Didn’t I mention her case is complicated? A surgery like hers requires extra hands. We need to be prepared for any emergencies."

Evelyn vaguely recalled him saying something similar. Still, his presence here made sense.

He cleared his throat, masking his unease. "Now that you mention it, I just remembered I have a meeting to attend—about Mrs. Whitmore Senior’s surgery."

Without another word, Julian turned and strode away. Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

Nathaniel was still here.

But when she glanced back at the corridor, he was gone.

Where had he disappeared to?

Relief loosened the tension in her shoulders. She called after Julian, "Will the surgery still proceed as scheduled?"

"Of course," he replied, though a hint of nervousness colored his tone.

Had she noticed something was off?

Evelyn hesitated before pressing further. "Julian, I heard the lead surgeon is one of the best in Nord City. And that his sister—Victoria—has feelings for Nathaniel. After everything that’s happened, I thought he might refuse to operate."

She was testing him.

Julian understood exactly what she was implying.

Nathaniel had broken off his engagement with Victoria because Julian had revealed he only agreed to the surgery for Evelyn’s sake.

It had been a warning—stay away from her.

But Julian never expected them to already be married. If he had known, he would never have interfered. Never.

Regret twisted inside him.

If he had realized their relationship sooner, he would have taken Evelyn far from Nord City, away from the Whitmore family’s tangled affairs.

"Don’t worry," he said smoothly. "A renowned surgeon is handling the procedure. I promise."

"Does this surgeon attend meetings with the other doctors?"

The question caught him off guard.

His words stumbled. "Why do you ask? Do you want to meet him?"

What if she did? How would he explain?

Hire an imposter?

Evelyn shook her head. "No, just curious. It doesn’t matter if I meet him. The only thing that matters is the surgery’s success."

That surgeon was Victoria’s brother. If Evelyn showed her face, his resentment might jeopardize everything.

What would she do then?

She could only hope things would go smoothly.

Julian exhaled in quiet relief.

It was better this way.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t know how to explain the truth.
###Chapter 284

Evelyn noticed the strange look on Julian's face. Something wasn't right.

"Julian, you're not yourself today."

"Am I? Must be work stress," he deflected, avoiding her gaze.

"Go ahead. Don’t you have a meeting? I’ll stay with Grandma Eleanor," Evelyn said, deciding not to push further.

He nodded. "I’ll pick you up later for your prenatal checkup."

Watching her grow closer to the Whitmores was the last thing he wanted. But he knew how deeply Evelyn cared for them.

Before the Montgomery brothers took her in, Eleanor had been the one to look after her. He couldn’t just tear her away.

Once he got her out of Nord City, away from the Whitmores, everything would be settled.

Evelyn watched Julian descend the stairs, exhaling softly.

After washing some fruit, she headed toward the patient’s room. The door swung open just as she approached.

Nathaniel stepped out, blocking her path. His towering frame loomed over her, intensifying the tension.

Holding the bowl of fruit, Evelyn met his piercing gaze.

He lowered his voice. "Evelyn Carter, I don’t care about your personal life. But this is the hospital where my grandmother is staying. Have you considered the consequences if she catches you two?"

She swallowed the bitterness in her throat. "I’m not here to argue. Grandma’s surgery is soon. Please move."

His warm fingers wrapped around her wrist. "Do you think I’m trying to fight with you? If you’re so eager to throw yourself at another man, fine. But I have one condition—don’t let Grandma find out before her surgery."

She yanked her arm free. "Don’t worry. I won’t tell her. Meanwhile, you’re the one engaged in scandals. Maybe you should be more careful."

Nathaniel stiffened at her words, his expression darkening. "You don’t get to say that. If it weren’t for you—"

"Enough. I don’t want to hear about your engagement," she cut him off.

Did she have anything to do with it being called off? How could he blame her?

She squared her shoulders. "Mr. Whitmore, from now on, let’s only discuss Grandma. Nothing else. Once her surgery is over, we’ll finalize the divorce and go our separate ways."

Frustration coiled inside him as he studied her resolute expression.

Earlier, he’d nearly lost control when he saw her in Julian’s arms.

But why? Why did her actions affect him like this?

It shouldn’t matter who she was with.

Yet, he couldn’t shake the turmoil she stirred in him. This was unfamiliar. Uncontrollable.

He released her, his gaze conflicted. "Evelyn, I’ll say this once—you and Julian aren’t right for each other."

His misunderstanding amused her. She tilted her head, a smirk playing on her lips. "Nathaniel Whitmore, are you jealous?"
###Chapter 285



Evelyn Carter lifted her gaze, studying Nathaniel Whitmore intently. His handsome features reflected in her luminous hazel eyes.

They stood in the hospital corridor where golden sunlight streamed through the windows, carrying the scent of summer blossoms.

Nathaniel saw his own reflection in her eyes, his pulse quickening inexplicably.

"Evelyn Carter, you've grown bolder since we last met. Do I look like a man who has feelings for you?" His denial came too quickly.

Despite his stern expression, his eyes betrayed hesitation. He adjusted his tie nervously, a telltale sign of his inner turmoil.

"Fine. Then why do you care so much about my relationships if you don't even like me? Why warn me about those men? Isn't that crossing boundaries for an ex-husband?"

"Because your judgment in men is atrocious."

She nodded slowly. "You're right. Had I better judgment, I wouldn't have chosen you in the first place."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched visibly. "Mark my words, Evelyn Carter. You'll regret this."

With that, he stormed off.

A bitter taste filled Evelyn's mouth as she watched him leave. Her hand instinctively cradled her stomach. She knew she'd never regret her choice.

After composing herself, she entered the hospital room with a fruit basket. "Grandmother."

"Evelyn, did you see Nathaniel? He came by earlier."

She hesitated. "No."

The immediate lie sent a pang of guilt through her.

Eleanor Whitmore grasped Evelyn's hand. "You must have missed him. He went downstairs for my surgery consultation. He should return soon."

Evelyn's expression faltered. Nathaniel attended the consultation?

This was disastrous! Julian Montgomery was downstairs too!

Only then did she realize Nathaniel had gone the same direction as Julian. Why hadn't she noticed sooner?



What now? Would they come to blows if Julian saw Nathaniel?

Anxiety twisted Evelyn's stomach. "Grandmother, I should attend that meeting too."

She needed to monitor the situation. If violence erupted, she could intervene.

Eleanor frowned. "Whatever for? Nathaniel's presence suffices. Those medical discussions are dreadfully dull. Keep me company instead."

Evelyn forced a smile. She didn't care about the meeting - she needed to prevent a confrontation.

"Grandmother, you don't understand my predicament," she thought desperately.

What excuse could she use to attend?

Downstairs, nearly every specialist gathered in the conference room to finalize surgical details.

As lead surgeon, Julian Montgomery occupied the central position, meticulously outlining critical procedure points.

Nathaniel sat in the front row, visibly irritated by Julian's presence but restraining himself - Julian was Eleanor's surgeon after all.

Julian noticed Nathaniel immediately. Ice flashed in his steel-gray eyes at the sight of his rival.

This bastard secretly married Evelyn? Impregnated her? The thought of her nearly becoming a widow made Julian's blood boil.

Neither man wanted this encounter.

Miraculously, the meeting concluded without incident.

The medical team praised Julian's expertise. "Dr. Montgomery, your insights were invaluable. We'll ensure everything proceeds flawlessly."
###Chapter 286

Julian nodded. "I'm not the only surgeon involved in this procedure. I'll need everyone's cooperation."

The meeting concluded shortly after, the attendees dispersing from the conference room.

Julian was about to leave when Nathaniel's sharp voice cut through the air. "Dr. Montgomery, a word."

Julian's lips thinned. Reluctantly, he turned, his gaze icy. "What?"

Nathaniel closed the distance between them, neither man willing to back down.

After a tense silence, Nathaniel spoke first. "Dr. Montgomery, I appreciate you agreeing to operate on my grandmother. But stay away from Evelyn. She's still my wife."

"Your wife?" Julian scoffed. "How shameless. The divorce will be finalized after the surgery, won't it?"

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "I never said that."

"Going back on your word now, Nathaniel Whitmore?" Julian grabbed Nathaniel's collar, his expression dark. "If the surgery weren't in two days, I'd knock you out right here."

As a surgeon, his hands were his livelihood—especially with such a complex procedure ahead.

He couldn't afford to lose control, no matter how much this bastard deserved it.

Nathaniel stood his ground. "Likewise. I've tolerated you long enough."

"Fine. After the surgery, we settle this properly. The loser walks away."

Evelyn arrived just then, witnessing the confrontation.

She rushed between them. "Stop it!"

Julian released Nathaniel and straightened his coat. "I've said what I needed to. Let's go, Evelyn."

"Really?" She eyed him skeptically.

Thankfully, she'd arrived before things escalated.

Without another word, Julian took her hand and led her out.

Evelyn glanced back at Nathaniel, who remained rooted in place.

His expression was unreadable, something dark and turbulent in his gaze.

A strange pang twisted her chest, and she quickly looked away.

She must be imagining things.

Why would he look at her like that?

Nathaniel watched them leave, his jaw clenched as their intertwined hands burned into his vision.

Once they were gone, he loosened his tie and turned to Robert. "Tell me, does Evelyn have terrible taste? Of all people, she chooses Victoria's brother."

Robert hesitated. "I think she still cares for you. Why not win her back, Mr. Whitmore?"

Nathaniel stiffened. "What for? Don't be ridiculous."

His pride wounded, he added stiffly, "I'm only concerned she's being deceived. Grandmother would worry. This isn't about Evelyn."

Robert sighed.

Nathaniel always said the opposite of what he meant when it came to women.

Ever since Evelyn accepted the divorce without protest, he'd been acting out of character.

Evelyn followed Julian out of the private hospital.

Settling into the passenger seat, she glanced at him. "How did the meeting go?"

"Well. The surgery is scheduled for three days from now."

The reminder sobered her. "Julian, it has to succeed. Eleanor Whitmore means everything to me."

"Don't worry. I'll give it my all." Determination hardened his gaze.

For Evelyn, who loved Eleanor like family, he'd do whatever it took.

Then nothing would tie her to the Whitmores anymore.

She smiled faintly. "That puts my mind at ease."

"Come to Nord City with us, Evelyn. Start fresh with your babies—far from the Whitmores."

"Eventually. But not yet."

He frowned. "What's stopping you?"

She shook her head. "I need to finish my college credits. Once Eleanor recovers, I'll talk to Aunt Margaret. Maybe in a few months, when I'm further along, I'll join you."

Julian calculated silently. A few months—he could wait.

At the hospital, Evelyn went straight for her prenatal checkup.

During the ultrasound, the doctor smiled. "Congratulations! Two heartbeats. You're having twins."

Evelyn stared at the monitor in shock. "Twins?"

"Yes."

Beaming, she left with the report.

Julian met her outside. "Everything alright?"

"The doctor said it's twins. I need bloodwork next." She couldn't stop smiling. "Julian, two babies!"

He scanned the report, his lips quirking slightly before he schooled his expression.

"Twins are higher risk. I still don't agree with keeping them."

Her health mattered more.

She tugged his sleeve. "I'll be careful. Nothing will go wrong."

He sighed. "Still keeping it from Alexander and the others?"

"For now. We'll tell them when I move to Nord City." She gave him pleading eyes.

Finally, he relented. "Fine. But only until then."

Alexander didn't know about the pregnancy. A few more months wouldn't hurt.

Julian could already picture the beating he'd take for keeping this secret.

Suddenly, a woman snatched the report from Evelyn.

"I knew it! You're pregnant, Evelyn Carter! You're finished!"

Evelyn stared at the masked woman. "Cassandra?"

The woman yanked off her mask.

Cassandra Blake smirked. "That's right. It's me."

This was their first encounter since the demolition incident.
###Chapter 287

Nathaniel's pride took a sharp blow. His expression hardened as he spoke. "I'm concerned Evelyn might be getting scammed. Eleanor will worry too. This isn't just about Evelyn."

Robert sighed, exasperated.

Nathaniel had a habit of saying things he didn’t mean when it came to women.

Ever since Evelyn had accepted his divorce proposal without protest, he’d been acting unlike himself.

Meanwhile, Evelyn followed Julian out of the private hospital.

Settling into the passenger seat, she stole a glance at him. "Julian, how did the meeting go?"

"Good. The surgery is set for three days from now."

The mention of the schedule snapped her back to focus, her expression serious. "Julian, this surgery has to succeed. Eleanor means everything to me."

"Don’t worry. I’ll give it my all." Determination burned in his eyes.

For Evelyn, who cherished Eleanor so deeply, he would do everything in his power to save her.

That way, nothing from the Whitmore family could hold Evelyn back anymore.

A soft smile curved her lips. "I feel better hearing you say that."

"Come live in Nord City with us, Evelyn. Start fresh with your baby. Stay far away from the Whitmores."

"I will, but not yet."

Julian frowned. "What’s stopping you?"

She shook her head. "I need to finish my college credits first. Once Eleanor recovers, I’ll talk to Margaret about it. Maybe in a few months, when I’m too far along, I’ll move in with you all."

Quick calculations ran through his mind. A few months wasn’t too long. He could wait.

After arriving at the hospital, Evelyn went straight for her prenatal checkup.

During the ultrasound, the doctor’s eyes widened in surprise. "Congratulations! I’m detecting two heartbeats. You’re having twins."

Evelyn stared at the monitor in disbelief. "Really?"

"Yes."

Beaming, she left the room clutching the report.

Julian approached her. "Everything alright?"

"The doctor said I’m carrying twins and ordered a blood test." Her smile was unstoppable.

"Julian, there are two babies!" She could barely contain her excitement.

He took the report, scanning it before a faint smile tugged at his lips.

He schooled his expression. "Twins are wonderful, but it also means higher risks. I still don’t fully support keeping them."

To him, Evelyn’s health mattered more than the babies.

She tugged his sleeve. "Nothing will go wrong. I’ll be careful."

He exhaled. "Are you still keeping this from Alexander and the others?"

"For now. We’ll tell them once I move to Nord City." Her pleading eyes locked onto his.

Finally, he relented. "Fine. But only until then."

Alexander had no idea about the pregnancy. A few more months wouldn’t change anything.

Even if he found out now, the outcome would be the same.

Julian could already picture the future—getting pummeled by Alexander for Evelyn’s sake.

Just then, a woman lunged forward, snatching the report from Evelyn’s hands. "I knew it! You’re pregnant, Evelyn Carter! You’re finished now!"

Evelyn studied the masked woman, struggling to place her. "Cassandra?" she guessed.

"That’s right. It’s me." The woman yanked off her mask.

It was indeed Cassandra Blake!

This was their first encounter since the demolition incident.
###Chapter 288

"Why would I care?" Cassandra Blake sneered, her fingers tightening around the ultrasound report. "Evelyn Carter, you're carrying another man's child, aren't you? Is it him? I've finally caught you red-handed!"

Evelyn couldn't believe the absurdity. "What business is my pregnancy of yours? And what do you plan to do with my medical records?"

"Useless to me," Cassandra shrugged dramatically, "but someone might pay good money for this. Penelope Whitmore would be very interested. How much do you think she'd give me for this little secret?"

Evelyn's expression darkened. "This isn't Penelope's child. Giving it to her won't benefit you. Since when is pregnancy illegal? Go ahead, shout it from the rooftops if you want."

The words gave Cassandra pause.

Her eyes darted back to the ultrasound image.

Now that she thought about it, Penelope had shown unusual interest when Cassandra first hinted at Evelyn's possible pregnancy.

It was like she'd struck gold!

While Cassandra hesitated, Julian Montgomery snatched the report back. "Listen carefully," he growled, "if you're looking for trouble, I won't hold back. Was fifteen days in jail not enough for you?"

After the neighborhood demolition incident, they'd arranged for Cassandra to spend two weeks in police custody.

She should've learned her lesson, yet here she was, stirring trouble again.

Cassandra paled and bolted before they could react.

Julian gave chase, but she disappeared around a corner with surprising speed.

Evelyn touched his arm. "Let her go."

"But what if she tells the Whitmores about your pregnancy?"

Evelyn inhaled deeply. "No one would believe her. Besides, I have a plan. Trust me."

"I'll have your hospital records altered," Julian said immediately. "If the Whitmores investigate, they'll find nothing."

"Perfect." She carefully folded the ultrasound into her purse.

Nothing would harm these babies. Not while she breathed. There were still tests to complete today.

Julian remained uneasy.

While Evelyn underwent her examination, he made a call. "Find Cassandra Blake. Silence her. Permanently."

Until Evelyn's brothers returned to Nord City, Nathaniel Whitmore could never learn about these babies.

Though Julian didn't fear Nathaniel personally, a custody battle with the powerful Whitmore family would be disastrous.

Most importantly, Julian needed Evelyn to sever all ties with Nathaniel - before complications arose.

Meanwhile, Cassandra ran like the devil chased her, terrified Julian might catch up.

Fumbling with her phone, she tried calling Penelope repeatedly.

No answer.

Panic set in.

Why wasn't Penelope picking up?

Desperate, Cassandra sent a text: 'I have Evelyn Carter's ultrasound report.'

The moment the message delivered, a wicked grin spread across her face.

She didn't care what Penelope planned to do with the information - only that it would be valuable.

Cassandra needed money. Badly.

When Penelope finally called back, Cassandra's eyes lit up with greed.

Her fingers had just grazed the answer button when a strong hand clamped over her mouth.

Darkness swallowed her consciousness.

The phone kept ringing, unanswered.

On the other end, Penelope cursed. "What game is Cassandra playing? She texts me then ignores my calls?"

She hung up, certain Cassandra would call back after seeing the missed calls.

Victoria Sinclair frowned. "Do you think Cassandra was telling the truth? Is Evelyn really pregnant?"
###Chapter 289

The two women were getting pampered at the luxury spa, so Beatrice couldn't answer her phone.

This time, it was Cassandra who wasn't picking up.

Beatrice tapped her manicured nails against her champagne flute. "Who knows? That idiot Cassandra lost everything - her reputation, her job. She'd probably say anything for money now."

Victoria nodded thoughtfully. "That's certainly possible. But she wouldn't make up such a specific claim without reason, would she?"

"If Evelyn's pregnant, could it be Nathaniel's? Wouldn't that complicate things for you?" Beatrice suggested with feigned concern.

Victoria's perfectly sculpted brows drew together as she dismissed the idea.

After all, Evelyn had been spending considerable time with Julian recently, making him the more likely candidate for fatherhood.

Just the thought sent a chill down Victoria's spine. That nobody must never get close to the Montgomery brothers!

Something didn't add up. Victoria immediately dialed her assistant. "Pull Evelyn Carter's medical records. I need to know if she's pregnant."

If Evelyn was indeed carrying a child - regardless of who the father was - Victoria would ensure that pregnancy never came to term.

Beatrice leaned forward eagerly. "Ms. Sinclair, what's the status on the demolition compensation? I'm dying to see that little gold-digger suffer."

"Everything's arranged perfectly." Victoria's lips curled into a cold smile. "She'll never see a penny of that money."

A dangerous glint flashed in Victoria's eyes. Crushing insignificant ants like Evelyn was child's play.

After the humiliation of being forced to apologize to that nobody, it was time for Evelyn to experience real consequences.

Meanwhile, Evelyn returned home from her doctor's appointment to find Margaret pacing anxiously by the living room window.

Margaret kept glancing at her phone like it might explode.

"What's wrong, Aunt Margaret?" Evelyn asked gently.

"Evelyn, I heard the demolition compensation was processed yesterday, but our account still shows nothing. I checked with the neighbors - everyone else has received their payments. We're the only ones left out. Do you think there's a problem?"

That was strange. "That shouldn't be happening. You gave them the account details I provided, right?" Evelyn verified.

"Of course! I even took photos of the paperwork. The account number matches perfectly."

"Don't worry, Aunt Margaret." Evelyn placed a reassuring hand on her aunt's shoulder. "I'll visit Vista Properties tomorrow. It's a reputable company - there must just be a processing delay."

Given Victoria's earlier threats, Evelyn strongly suspected interference. But regardless, she would get to the bottom of this.

It was absurd that only her family's payment was missing.

Even if Victoria Sinclair thought she controlled everything, Evelyn wouldn't let her win this time.

Retreating to her room, Evelyn called Sebastian. "Sebastian, I have a question."

"Shoot."

"How would someone go about accessing a company's internal systems if they needed certain information?"

She could practically hear his eyebrow arching through the phone. "Which company are we talking about?"

Evelyn cleared her throat. "Hypothetically speaking. I've completed all the coding exercises you assigned, so technically I'm halfway to being a hacker now. Just curious about how it works in practice."

Her natural aptitude for technology had surprised even herself.

When Cassandra had spread those vicious rumors at university, Sebastian had traced the IP address effortlessly.

That incident had sparked Evelyn's interest, leading to these secret hacking lessons.
###Chapter 290

The sun was just beginning to rise when Evelyn Carter first dipped her toes into the world of hacking. What started as curiosity had now turned into something far more serious—she was making rapid progress, faster than she had ever anticipated.

Nathaniel Whitmore saw right through her flimsy excuse. He knew exactly what she was up to—trying to breach a corporate system. But instead of calling her out, he simply exhaled and leaned back in his chair.

"Easy," he said, voice steady. "Follow my instructions. Big corporations have entire teams dedicated to cybersecurity. The moment they detect an intrusion, they’ll retaliate. You need to mask your IP behind a secure firewall. Otherwise, they’ll trace you in seconds."

Evelyn bit her lip. "I have the program you gave me. It should be enough."

"That’s not foolproof," Nathaniel countered. "I’m sending you something better. This one will actually work."

A beat of silence passed before she murmured, "Thanks, Nathaniel."

Not only had he seen through her plan without confrontation, but he had also handed her a lifeline—a new, more powerful tool.

"Don’t mention it. Just call me if you hit a wall."

"Got it."

The call ended, and within minutes, a zip file appeared in her inbox. She downloaded it straight to a USB drive, her fingers moving with quiet determination.

The next morning, Evelyn walked into Vista Properties with her laptop tucked under her arm.

Maxwell Harrison worked here.

She was done waiting. It was time to face him directly and demand answers.

Approaching the reception desk, she flashed a polite smile. "Hi, I’m here to see Mr. Harrison. He’s overseeing the demolition in my old neighborhood. Every family received compensation except mine. Could you tell me what’s going on?"

The receptionist nodded. "One moment, I’ll check for you."

While she waited, Evelyn let her gaze wander across the sleek, modern decor of the lobby—polished marble floors, glass walls, and expensive art.

A minute later, the receptionist looked up. "Mr. Harrison is currently occupied. If you’d like to wait, he’ll address your concern as soon as he’s free."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Of course."

She retreated to a secluded corner, pulled out her laptop, and got to work.

Within minutes, she was inside Vista Properties’ internal system.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she navigated through files, searching for anything related to the demolition project.

And then she found it—a schedule, complete with names and dates.

A photo of Maxwell Harrison stared back at her, his smug expression burned into her memory.

An hour ticked by.

Impatience gnawed at her. She marched back to the receptionist. "Is Mr. Harrison available now?"

The woman shook her head apologetically. "I’m afraid not. Please bear with us a little longer."

Evelyn clenched her jaw.

Fine. If he wouldn’t come to her, she’d force his hand.

She dove back into the system, this time hunting for Maxwell’s direct contact number.

Found it.

She dialed.

The line connected instantly.

"Hello, who is this?" His voice was smooth, dismissive.

Evelyn didn’t waste time. "Mr. Harrison, my family hasn’t received compensation for the demolition. I’d like an explanation. Are you free to talk?"

A pause. Then, a sigh. "Oh, it’s you. Look, I’m busy right now. I’ll get back to you later."

The call ended abruptly.

She tried again.

No answer.

Realization struck like a slap.

He was avoiding her.

And she knew exactly why—Victoria Sinclair had something to do with this.

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the keyboard.

If he wanted to play games, she’d play them better.

She typed a single line into the company’s internal messaging system—visible to every employee with access.

"Mr. Harrison, are you done yet?"

The effect was immediate.

Across the office, screens lit up with the unexpected message.

Murmurs erupted.

"What the—?"

"Who sent that?"

"Did we get hacked?"

Within minutes, the news reached Alexander Montgomery.

His expression darkened. "What the hell is the IT department doing? Find out who’s behind this—now!"
###Chapter 291

Alexander Montgomery gathered the entire Technical Department the moment he discovered the breach in the subsidiary's internal system.

Whoever that hacker was, they either had nerves of steel—or a death wish.

Seated in his office, Alexander scanned the intrusive text on his screen, his jaw tightening. He hadn’t expected anyone bold enough to challenge him like this.

Not after establishing this subsidiary in Bern City.

Who was this reckless hacker?

His voice was ice. "You have ten minutes to erase that text. Thirty minutes to track the hacker down. I want them identified and brought to me. Fail, and you're all fired."

The technical team scrambled to their computers, fingers flying across keyboards as they initiated the trace.

Alexander yanked his tie loose and turned to his assistant. "Get Maxwell Harrison in here. Now. I want to know why a hacker is targeting him."

Meanwhile, Maxwell was already panicking. He dialed Victoria Sinclair in a rush. "Ms. Sinclair, we have a problem. Someone just hacked into the company’s system! Do you think that woman is behind this?"

Victoria scoffed. "Don’t be ridiculous. She doesn’t have the resources for something like this. Did you piss someone else off?"

She refused to believe Evelyn Carter could orchestrate such a sophisticated attack.

Maxwell hesitated. "But Ms. Sinclair, she’s been waiting outside the office for days. I kept brushing her off. And now this? The timing’s too suspicious."

Victoria exhaled sharply. "I’m on my way. Just stay calm. Tell them it’s unrelated—some random hacker testing our security. My brother’s team is the best. They’ll handle it."

Maxwell swallowed hard. "Understood."

Ending the call, he wiped his clammy palms on his trousers before knocking on Alexander’s office door.

"Mr. Montgomery," he said, forcing composure. "You wanted to see me?"

Alexander didn’t look up from his screen. "Care to explain why our system was hacked with a message demanding you?"

Maxwell’s pulse spiked. "I swear, I have no idea! We’re a new company—competitors could be trying to sabotage us. This could be retaliation."

He wasn’t about to confess. Not when Victoria was on her way.

Even if the truth came out, he’d be safe. He was just following orders.

Alexander studied him, considering the logic. New businesses were vulnerable to underhanded tactics.

But involving a hacker?

That was personal.

His brother, Sebastian, was one of the best hackers alive. Whoever did this had no idea what they’d unleashed.

A technician burst in. "Sir, the hacker’s good. They detected our countermeasures and vanished. The IP’s masked, and their methods are polished. Tracking them will take time."

Alexander’s lips curled. "Bring me a laptop."

If they wanted a fight, he’d give them one.
###Chapter 292

Alexander Montgomery's gaze remained fixed on the monitor as he dialed Sebastian. "Sebastian, we've got a breach. Someone's infiltrated our corporate systems. And they're bold. Any ideas how to trace them?"

Sebastian chuckled. "Really? Who'd dare challenge you? No hacker in Silvercrest would be that reckless."

"Enough. This isn't Silvercrest. Our tech team is stumped. This hacker has tricks up their sleeve. Didn't you mention some cutting-edge tracking program? Send it over. I'm ending this today."

With Sebastian's expertise, Alexander was confident they'd corner the intruder.

Sebastian smirked. "Easy. What's their virtual IP? That might give me a lead."

"Shadowcrest."

Sebastian nearly spat out his coffee, coughing violently. "Wait—what did you say? Shadowcrest?"

"Shadowcrest. Sounds made up. Does that even exist?"

"It's virtual."

Sebastian's mind raced.

This couldn't be a coincidence. That IP was one he and his inner circle had created. Only a handful of people had access.

Last night, he'd shared his latest security protocols with Evelyn. And now, this.

A sinking feeling settled in his gut. Had he just handed his own sister the tools to sabotage herself?

"Sebastian? Send the program. Now." Alexander's voice sharpened with impatience.

Sebastian cleared his throat. "Hold on. I’ve got time. Let me handle this. There’s something I need to check first."

Alexander’s brow arched. "You know who this is? Don’t tell me you’re covering for them."

"Not confirming anything yet. I need to see for myself."

"Fine. I’ll grant you system access. You built our firewalls—you know what to do." Alexander’s tone left no room for argument.

The call ended. Alexander’s instincts prickled. Sebastian was hiding something. Was the hacker someone close to him?

Sebastian logged into Montgomery Corp’s servers, launching a counterattack.

Bit by bit, he gained ground.

But the hacker’s techniques felt eerily familiar.

His fingers froze mid-keystroke. After a tense pause, he dialed Evelyn.

Meanwhile, Evelyn’s screen flashed with warnings. Without Sebastian’s defenses, her system would’ve been compromised.

Her phone buzzed—Sebastian’s name lighting up the screen.

Her pulse jumped. Why now?

She swallowed hard before answering. "Sebastian?"

No pleasantries. He cut straight to it. "Evelyn. Did you use the program I gave you yesterday?"

No point dancing around it. He’d already ruled out his other contacts.

Only one possibility remained.

Silence stretched between them. Then, quietly: "How did you know?"

A quiet exhale. He’d been right.

Guilt twisted her voice. "Did I just cause you trouble?"
###Chapter 293



Yesterday, Evelyn considered using the program Sebastian shared to vent her frustration. She wanted to teach Victoria and Maxwell a lesson.

Running into a superior hacker was unexpected.

Now that Sebastian was checking in, something must be wrong.

"No. I just noticed someone else using that program and wanted to make sure you were alright. Need backup?"

"I'm fine for now. I can manage." Sebastian's program was more than enough for Evelyn.

Even though a stronger opponent had appeared, her goal was already accomplished.

He hadn't expected that response. "Alright. Call me if you need anything."

Sebastian couldn’t push further without risking exposure.

After hanging up, Evelyn kept her eyes on the screen. The rival hacker had stopped pursuing her instead of continuing the chase.

Either way, her objective was achieved. Engaging further would be excessive. She didn’t want to cause trouble for Sebastian either.

"Evelyn, what are you doing here?" Victoria spotted her in the waiting area the moment she arrived.

Victoria’s heels clicked sharply with each step. "You don’t belong here," she said, her tone dripping with condescension.

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "I’m here to collect what’s owed to me. If not here, where else should I be?"

"Oh, so you came for the money? Funny how someone claimed they didn’t care about the compensation, yet here you are, desperate to get it back." A smug smile curled Victoria’s lips.

Just as she suspected—Evelyn cared more than she let on.

Victoria lowered her voice. "Want the money? It’s simple. Apologize to me sincerely, and I’ll put in a good word with the Demolition Department. How does that sound?"

The insulting demand didn’t faze Evelyn. "No. I’m waiting for you to apologize and transfer what’s rightfully mine."

Victoria burst into laughter. "Evelyn Carter, are you delusional? Keep dreaming. Without my approval, you’ll never see that money. I’ll make sure of it."



Evelyn smiled coolly. "Then I might as well demand an internal audit of the company’s system. Let’s see how your brother handles it once he finds out."

A flicker of unease crossed Victoria’s face before she snapped, "He’s my brother. Who do you think he’ll side with?"

Evelyn smirked. "We’ll see."

"You should’ve taken my offer when I was being generous. Now you can wait until hell freezes over."

Victoria didn’t have time to waste. She needed to clean up Maxwell’s mess before he ruined everything.

If Alexander discovered she was behind this, she’d be finished.

Meanwhile, Sebastian called Alexander after speaking with Evelyn.

"Alexander, have you considered why the hacker is targeting you? That’s the real issue here."

"I’ve looked into it. Could be a competitor’s tactic."

"That means you haven’t found the real answer. It’s not a competitor. There’s something else going on." Sebastian knew Evelyn too well—this wasn’t just about rivalry.

Alexander arched a brow. "Sebastian, why the cryptic talk? Do you know who the hacker is? Are you protecting them?"

Sebastian swallowed. "Here’s my advice—check if this is connected to the demolition of Evelyn’s old neighborhood. She wouldn’t hack the system unless pushed. Did Maxwell provoke her?"
###Chapter 294

Alexander's voice cut through the tension. "Are you implying Evelyn is the hacker?"

"Who else could it be?" Nathaniel's confident reply came through the phone. "I've verified her digital footprint. As my protégé, she's mastered system infiltration beyond anyone's expectations."

The revelation sent Alexander reeling.

His baby sister had breached their corporate firewalls!

After a stunned silence, admiration crept into his voice as he studied the screens. "Remarkable progress. Our entire tech team is outmatched. Truly impressive."

Of course his brilliant sister would excel at this too. She'd always been extraordinary.

The stern CEO's expression softened into unmistakable sibling pride.

Baffled employees exchanged glances at their boss's sudden mood shift.

What could possibly explain this dramatic transformation?

Hanging up, Alexander turned to the sweating technicians. "Still can't locate the intruder?" His tone carried unexpected satisfaction.

The tech lead stammered, "No, sir. The hacker vanished without trace. We can't even retrieve the IP for recruitment purposes."

Alexander tsked. "Pathetic. Top-tier resumes yet you're bested by a single hacker. What exactly am I paying you for?"

Despite the reprimand, he seemed oddly pleased with the situation.

The confused department head wondered if mass termination was imminent.

Having subtly bragged about his sister's skills, Alexander's demeanor darkened as he faced Maxwell. "Explain what you've done to provoke this attack. Is this about the Queensbury redevelopment?"

Maxwell's throat went dry. "I followed protocol exactly! The project's clean—it can't be related."

"Prove it. Bring me all demolition documents immediately."

Panic set in as Maxwell realized the impending exposure of the one uncompensated family.

Victoria's sudden entrance provided temporary relief. "Alexander, darling, let me handle this mundane issue with Mr. Harrison."

"What are you doing here?" Alexander demanded bluntly.

"Corporate security alerts reached me. As family, I came to support you." Her saccharine smile didn't reach her eyes. "Have you identified the hacker? Such audacity! Engage Nathaniel—he'll make them regret this."

Though Evelyn sat nearby with a laptop, Victoria dismissed the possibility of her involvement.

Alexander's jaw tightened. "This doesn't concern you."

He'd already decided to let the matter rest—Evelyn's impressive skills deserved encouragement, not punishment. Perhaps she'd consider cybersecurity as a career.

His attention snapped back to Maxwell. "I won't repeat myself. Those documents. Now."

Victoria's manicured nails dug into her palms as she bit back frustration.
###Chapter 295

Victoria's face paled when she realized things weren't going her way. "Alexander, this has nothing to do with the demolition project. I'm certain of it."

Alexander's eyes narrowed slightly. "How would you know?"

Her expression stiffened. "Because those residents are from the lower class. How could they possibly orchestrate something like this? You're overcomplicating it."

The mention of social class darkened his tone. "The lower class? Have you forgotten where you came from?"

Her expression shifted dramatically. She quickly backtracked, "This is different. Let me handle it. I won’t disappoint you."

Alexander wasn’t fooled. If Evelyn had hacked into the company’s system, she must have had a compelling reason. He knew her character well enough to trust that.

Just then, a technician gasped. "Mr. Montgomery, the hacker breached our system again. This time, they sent a voice recording."

Alexander’s brows lifted. "Play it."

Meanwhile, Victoria’s stomach twisted with dread.

Was it the conversation she’d had with Evelyn in the waiting area?

Had Evelyn hired someone to do this?

She had underestimated her—Evelyn might not be a hacker, but she could certainly find one.

The recording crackled to life, revealing Victoria’s condescending remarks toward Evelyn.

Victoria’s face drained of color. "Alexander, that’s not me! It’s fabricated!"

Alexander frowned, disgusted by her arrogance.

He stared her down. "Do you think I’m an idiot? I know when you’re lying. What were you thinking, withholding compensation? How dare you, Victoria Sinclair!"

Now, the full picture was clear.

He turned to Maxwell, his voice icy. "Explain yourself. If I don’t get answers, every one of you is fired."

Alexander’s assistant ushered the others out, leaving only Victoria and Maxwell.

Maxwell swallowed hard. "Mr. Montgomery, we were just following protocol. The family’s documents weren’t complete—"

Alexander snatched the file and flung it at him. "What was missing? Tell me exactly what was missing!"

He had personally ensured Evelyn’s paperwork was flawless.

Victoria finally snapped. "Fine! I have a grudge against her, Alexander. That’s why I targeted her. Stay out of it—I’ll resolve this."

"A grudge?" He let out a cold laugh before addressing Maxwell. "Submit your resignation to HR. If you want to avoid legal consequences, apologize to that family immediately. Otherwise, expect a lawsuit."

Maxwell panicked, turning to Victoria. "Ms. Sinclair, I was only following your orders! You have to explain this to him—I had no part in it!"

At this point, his only lifeline was Victoria.
###Chapter 296

Victoria kept her gaze fixed on the floor. Defending Maxwell was the last thing on her mind when she was already drowning in her own mess. The only reason Evelyn had confronted her was because he had failed to complete his task.

Once Maxwell was escorted out of the office, Victoria finally spoke in a trembling voice, "Alexander, please let me handle this."

As a Montgomery, she still had some authority—or so she thought.

"Victoria, you have no right to interfere. And more importantly, why are you targeting this family?"

Alexander was baffled. What reason did she have to go after Evelyn?

Victoria's expression hardened. "Evelyn came between Nathaniel and me. Who does she think she is? I was just giving her a warning."

In that moment, Alexander remembered the Fleur International Design Competition. Evelyn had won first place, only to be accused of cheating.

When Victoria had claimed it was a misunderstanding, he had believed her. But now, it was clear—she had orchestrated it deliberately.

It was time to cut ties.

Alexander exhaled sharply, his decision final.

"Victoria, I mentioned dissolving your adoption before. Sign the papers now."

Victoria froze. She hadn’t expected him to bring this up now.

Her voice turned pleading. "I'm not married to Nathaniel yet. Didn't you say you'd only dissolve the adoption after I married him? Because then I'd have someone to rely on?"

But Nathaniel had called off their engagement because of Julian. Shouldn't the Montgomery family still take responsibility for her?

Without hesitation, Alexander pulled a file from his desk and slid it toward her.

"Sign it."

Victoria had crossed a line. Alexander couldn’t keep her in the family after what she had done to Evelyn.

Victoria glared at the documents.

"Alexander, are you really this desperate to get rid of me?"

"Victoria, this is the end. You're no longer fit to be a Montgomery."

If she stayed, the conflict with Evelyn would only escalate. How would they explain that?

"At least give me a reason! Don’t tell me it’s because of that scheming little witch, Evelyn!"

Victoria finally noticed the shift in Alexander’s demeanor whenever Evelyn was mentioned.

Alexander’s face darkened instantly.

"Victoria, since when did you become so vulgar?"

"Oh, did I strike a nerve? Julian was fooled by her, and now you’re under her spell too?"

Victoria was losing control. The adoption dissolution agreement was her worst nightmare.

Her only power came from being the Montgomery heiress.

Without that status, where would she stand in Bern City? She wouldn’t even have a chance with Nathaniel anymore.

Alexander frowned.

"I have no idea what you’re talking about. Evelyn isn’t a liar."

He knew her well. She was kind, genuine—nothing like the venomous accusations Victoria was spewing. His patience with Victoria had run out.

"Evelyn is nothing but a liar! She was tangled up with Daniel, and now she’s wrapped Julian around her finger! She’s a shameless, two-timing—"

"Enough!" Alexander’s palm struck her cheek before she could finish.
###Chapter 297



Victoria stood frozen, her cheek stinging from the impact. Tears welled up in her widened eyes as she gaped at Alexander in utter shock.

"You struck me? For Evelyn's sake?" Her voice trembled with disbelief.

This was beyond anything she'd anticipated.

Alexander's expression remained stone-cold as he glared at her. "Victoria Sinclair, how could you forget your upbringing as a Montgomery? Have decades of etiquette lessons taught you nothing?"

He'd initially feared she'd discovered Evelyn's true identity. Instead, she'd simply misinterpreted Evelyn's relationship with Daniel and Julian. Yet that didn't excuse her vulgar outburst.

"I was upset!" Victoria protested, her voice cracking with indignation. "And I wasn't wrong!"

"Enough!" Alexander's voice cut like steel. "We know about your interference in the Fleur International Design Competition too. Effective immediately, you're barred from all Montgomery family business. One more transgression and I'll freeze all your accounts."

"You can't do this!" She clutched at his sleeve desperately.

Panic surged through Victoria at the threat of losing her financial privileges. Without wealth, her social standing would crumble.

Alexander jerked his arm away. "You've crossed the line too many times, Victoria. I won't tolerate your constant sabotage."

"Please, Alexander! Forgive me this time!" Her plea came out strangled.

He thrust a document into her hands. "You have one week to consider. Make any reasonable request - I'll grant it."

A flash of contempt crossed Victoria's eyes as she snatched the papers. Without another word, she stormed out.

The elevator doors closed on her trembling form. Her nails dug into the documents as the numbers descended.

"Ms. Sinclair? Are you alright?" Walter asked cautiously when she emerged.

Victoria whirled around, her face contorted with rage. "After all I've done caring for that senile old woman, now they want to discard me like trash? Well, I won't make it easy for them!"



She wiped her tears furiously. Leaving the Montgomery family wouldn't be so simple.

That temptress Evelyn had clearly bewitched Julian, and now even Alexander defended her.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had intended to leave Vista Properties immediately after the confrontation. With someone as influential as Victoria present, she didn't want to cause Nathaniel further complications.

Just then, Derek Whitaker came rushing toward her.

"Ms. Carter! Regarding the demolition compensation - our investigation revealed an accounting error. The funds have been transferred to your account. My deepest apologies for this oversight."

Evelyn had researched his profile in the company database earlier. The photo matched the nervous man before her.

Her earlier tactics had worked.

Maintaining a cool facade, she replied curtly, "Let me verify that."

"Of course, take your time."

Turning away, she dialed Margaret. "Aunt Margaret, did you receive a deposit notification?"

"Let me check... Yes! Just now. Evelyn, how did you manage this?"

"I spoke with the person in charge. They discovered a clerical error in accounting. Everything's settled now."

Hanging up, Evelyn turned back to study Derek's overly deferential manner. His behavior seemed strangely... excessive.
###Chapter 298



Was it because Derek got reprimanded earlier?

Evelyn maintained an impassive expression as she stated, "Fine. I'll drop the matter since I've been compensated."

"Thank you, Ms. Carter. I truly apologize," Derek stammered.

Moments later, Victoria's mocking voice echoed through the lobby.

"Pathetic! Giving up so easily!"

Evelyn lifted her gaze to see Victoria stepping out of the elevator, her smirk dripping with arrogance.

With a cool smile, Evelyn countered, "At least he knows when to admit his mistakes."

"Don't flatter yourself, Evelyn. You only won because of underhanded tricks."

"They worked, didn't they? Mission accomplished."

Evelyn's eyes locked onto Victoria's as she added, "Keep scheming, and next time, it won't just be an audio clip I leak. I could've exposed the full video. Consider this me sparing your dignity."

Victoria's face twisted in fury.

"I underestimated your cunning. Who knew you'd stoop to hiring a hacker?"

Evelyn merely arched a brow. "Prove it. Can you?"

She wasn't foolish enough to confess.

"You just admitted it!" Victoria snapped.

"Did I? Or did you just confirm the voice in that recording was yours?"

Victoria fell silent, fists clenched. She'd already faced Alexander's wrath in his office—he wasn't one to be deceived.

Evelyn straightened. "If that's all, Ms. Sinclair, I'll take my leave."

She turned on her heel and strode away without hesitation.

Victoria's enraged shout followed her. "This isn't over, Evelyn!"



Not long after, Alexander emerged from his private elevator, scanning the lobby.

Evelyn was gone.

Where had she gone?

Charles approached. "Sir, the security feed shows Ms. Carter left the building."

Alexander exhaled, relieved. He'd been torn between fearing her anger and risking his cover.

Until he dealt with Victoria, he couldn't face Evelyn directly.

Just then, Oliver from Legal approached.

"Mr. Montgomery, we should report the hacking incident to authorities. Otherwise, our Bern City branch could face repercussions."

Alexander's gaze turned icy. "Call the police?"

"Yes. It's standard protocol—"

"You can't handle one hacker, and now you want to involve law enforcement?" Alexander cut in sharply. "Submit written reflections by tomorrow. One more breach, and you're all dismissed."

No, he wouldn't escalate this. A smirk tugged at his lips as he pictured Evelyn's brilliance. In just months of studying computer science, she'd outpaced expectations.

He screenshot the hacked company homepage and sent it to the "Montgomery Clan" group chat with the caption: Evelyn strikes again. Solo hack on a corporate system today. Future cybersecurity prodigy.

Sebastian replied instantly: Naturally. My protégé has raw talent.

Olivia chimed in, puzzled: Wait—isn't that our Bern City branch's interface?
###Chapter 299

Olivia was stunned. Why would Evelyn hack their subsidiary company?

Yet Nathaniel and Sebastian, who adored Evelyn, were absolutely thrilled.

Julian explained that Sebastian had been tutoring Evelyn in computer science, and he concluded that she had made remarkable progress.

Still, Olivia was baffled.

"Why would Evelyn hack the company’s system without reason? Did she discover something?"

Alexander clarified the situation.

Daniel cursed, "That witch Victoria! How dare she frame Evelyn like this? What are you going to do about this, Alexander? How will you explain yourself if Evelyn finds out later?"

Alexander replied coolly, "I’ll handle it. Give me a week to deal with Victoria."

Julian quickly added, "You’d better hurry. Evelyn plans to return to Nord City to live with us once she finishes her studies."

Even if Alexander found out about Evelyn’s pregnancy, he wouldn’t be able to stay angry at Julian and her—not after what Victoria had done.

Julian decided it was best to keep this a secret from Alexander for now. After all, if Alexander got furious, he wouldn’t hesitate to punch him.

They began discussing Evelyn’s return to Nord City.

Olivia chimed in, "Then I’ll have to go back to Nord City to make arrangements. Evelyn deserves nothing but the best."

They prepared lavish properties, luxury cars, and countless gifts to welcome her home.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sneezed the moment she stepped into her house. Was someone talking about her?

Margaret clasped her hands in excitement. "Evelyn, the money really went through!"

"Perfect. Things will only get better from here."

Suddenly, Margaret hesitated before speaking again. "Evelyn, remember when Alexander mentioned you returning to Nord City? After thinking about it for a while, I’ve decided to go with you—and bring Benjamin along."

"Really?"

Evelyn had been worried Margaret wouldn’t want to leave for an unfamiliar place. If she refused, Evelyn couldn’t possibly stay in Nord City permanently. She would never abandon Margaret, the woman who had raised her, just because she’d found her biological family.

"Of course. But before we leave, I’d like to say goodbye to my family. I won’t be coming back often in the future."

"Absolutely. But you can always visit during holidays."

Evelyn’s heart swelled with relief at Margaret’s agreement. Now, she could start planning her departure from Bern City.

The next day, Evelyn headed to the studio for her usual weekend shift.

Shortly after settling into her office, Jonathan walked in.

"Evelyn, you’re here too."

"You’re already out of the hospital?"

Evelyn hadn’t expected to see him so soon. She thought he’d be hospitalized for at least a few more days.

Jonathan smiled. "The doctor cleared me after a checkup. It’s just a minor injury—I just need rest. I can’t laze around in the hospital when there’s work to do here."

"Right. Just make sure you don’t overexert yourself. You’re not fully recovered yet."

"My mother’s been taking care of me these past few days. With her around, I’ll be fine."

Evelyn recalled her awkward encounter with Judith at his hospital room. Thankfully, they’d only met once. She couldn’t stand that woman.
###Chapter 300

Jonathan stepped out of his office as the afternoon sun cast long shadows across the studio floor.

"Evelyn, let's have lunch together."

"Of course. My treat this time," Evelyn replied, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "After you got hurt saving me last week, I still don't know how to properly thank you."

His lips quirked into a playful smirk. "Easy. Marry me."

A flush crept up Evelyn's neck.

Before the silence could stretch, Jonathan waved a hand dismissively. "Just joking. Don't overthink it. Come on, I'm starving."

The studio door swung open.

Judith Reeves swept in, clutching a thermal container. "Jonathan, darling, I brought your favorite chicken soup. You've been working too hard—you need proper nourishment."

"Mom," Jonathan sighed, rubbing his temple. "I told you I wasn't coming home for lunch today."

He'd specifically come to the studio knowing Evelyn would be working. A quiet lunch with her had been the plan.

Judith's unexpected arrival complicated everything.

"I worry about you skipping meals," Judith chided, setting the container on a nearby table. "Ms. Carter, you're welcome to share. It's my special recipe."

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Mrs. Reeves, have you eaten yet? Why don't we all go out together?"

"Oh, I couldn't intrude—"

"Nonsense," Evelyn interjected smoothly. "It's no trouble at all."

Jonathan exhaled through his nose. "Fine. There's a good Italian place twenty minutes away. Since we're free this afternoon, we can walk."

His carefully planned date now included his meddling mother.



At the car, Jonathan automatically opened the passenger door.

Evelyn hesitated, glancing at Judith.

"Mrs. Reeves, you should sit up front."

"How thoughtful!" Judith beamed, sliding into the seat. "I get terrible motion sickness unless I'm in front."

Evelyn settled into the backseat without complaint.

Judith turned in her seat as Jonathan started the engine. "Ms. Carter, I admire your dedication, working weekends. Most young people these days refuse to lift a finger beyond their scheduled hours. When Jonathan first started this studio—"

"Mom." Jonathan's grip tightened on the wheel.

Evelyn kept her smile intact despite the awkwardness thickening the air.

"Ms. Carter, the doctor said Jonathan mustn't strain himself. Since you work so closely, could you remind him to rest? He'll listen to you."

"Of course, Mrs. Reeves."

"Please, call me Judith." The older woman's eyes twinkled. "I feel like we're becoming friends."

The car rolled to a stop outside a rustic trattoria.

Judith immediately looped her arm through Evelyn's as they exited. "You're such a lovely girl—talented and beautiful. If you joined our family someday, you and Jonathan could build something extraordinary together."

Evelyn stiffened.

Then she looked up—and froze.

Dark, familiar eyes locked onto hers from across the street.

Her pulse skyrocketed.

It was him.
###Chapter 301



Evelyn never imagined she would run into Nathaniel here. Fate had a cruel sense of humor when it came to her.

Of course, Jonathan noticed him too. His eyes brightened the moment he recognized Nathaniel—the man engaged to Victoria Sinclair, heiress of the Sinclair dynasty.

The air grew thick with tension as they stood facing each other outside the restaurant.

Evelyn immediately looked away.

"Mrs. Reeves, let's head to our private dining area," she suggested quickly.

But Jonathan stepped forward, approaching Nathaniel with an eager smile.

"Mr. Whitmore, what a pleasant surprise! Are you dining here as well?"

Evelyn's pulse stuttered. Since when had Jonathan become so chummy with Nathaniel?

She dared a glance at Nathaniel, who looked as effortlessly striking as ever. When their eyes met, he gave her a detached nod and said nothing.

Meanwhile, Jonathan was practically vibrating with excitement. Getting close to Nathaniel Whitmore—a member of the most powerful family in the city—could open doors for him. Any scrap of opportunity Nathaniel tossed his way could skyrocket his career.

Standing next to Nathaniel, Jonathan looked painfully out of his depth—like a boy playing dress-up beside a king.

Evelyn wanted to disappear. This entire situation was mortifying.

Then, to her horror, Judith joined the conversation. She sidled up to Nathaniel and chirped, "Jonathan, is this your friend? Why don’t we all dine together? It’s such a lovely coincidence!"

Evelyn stiffened. There was no way Nathaniel would agree. He was notoriously private, borderline reclusive when it came to meals.

Jonathan seemed to realize how inappropriate his mother’s suggestion was. He rushed to intervene. "Mom, Mr. Whitmore is a very busy man. I’m sure he doesn’t have time—"

Evelyn nodded internally. Exactly what she’d been thinking.

Then Nathaniel spoke.

"Sure."

Evelyn’s jaw nearly hit the floor. Had she heard that right?

Jonathan looked just as stunned. This was the last thing he’d expected.

Evelyn’s mind raced. Was the world ending? Had Nathaniel lost his mind?

She seriously considered bolting.

But Judith was already beckoning her over.

"Evelyn, don’t just stand there! Come join us!"

Evelyn hesitated. She really didn’t want to.

Judith looped an arm through hers and whispered, "Don’t be shy, dear. It’s just dinner among friends. Mr. Whitmore is Jonathan’s acquaintance, after all. It’ll be fine!"

Evelyn had no choice but to let herself be dragged along, dread pooling in her stomach.

Jonathan tried to reassure her. "You know Mr. Whitmore too, don’t you, Evelyn? No need to be nervous."

Judith’s eyes sharpened with curiosity. "Oh? You two are acquainted? How do you know each other?"

Evelyn panicked. How was she supposed to answer that?

She glanced at Nathaniel, who simply said, "We have an… unconventional relationship."

Her breath caught. She quickly added, "Yes, very unconventional. We’re actually relatives."

Judith’s eyes gleamed. "Relatives? So he’s your…?"
###Chapter 302



After a brief hesitation, Evelyn answered, "Mr. Whitmore is my cousin—a distant cousin!"

She could feel his piercing gaze, but she refused to meet his eyes. She had no clue what game he was playing.

Jonathan Reeves readily accepted her explanation. It made sense to him since he knew Evelyn was also connected to the Montgomery family in Nord City. Among the elite, close familial ties weren’t uncommon. His suspicions weren’t raised—instead, he was thrilled by Evelyn’s prestigious background.

If Evelyn ended up with him, he’d be closely linked to both the Montgomery and Whitmore families.

Overcome with excitement, he gestured eagerly. "Let’s not linger at the entrance. Mr. Whitmore, right this way."

Nathaniel narrowed his eyes, casting Evelyn a meaningful glance before turning to follow them to the private dining room.

Evelyn trailed behind, her steps heavy. Her appetite had vanished.

Once seated, Jonathan quickly handed the menu to Nathaniel. "Mr. Whitmore, please order first."

Nathaniel took the menu—only to pass it directly to Evelyn.

"Evelyn, you go ahead."

The unexpected gesture nearly made her choke. Staring at the menu in front of her, she knew he was doing this on purpose.

Judith Reeves, seated beside her, nudged her impatiently. "Evelyn, don’t keep Mr. Whitmore waiting. It’s rude."

Swallowing hard, Evelyn took the menu from Nathaniel. Distracted, she barely skimmed it before selecting two dishes at random.

Judith immediately snatched the menu back.

"Evelyn, this won’t do! Mr. Whitmore is our honored guest—we should order something more luxurious. Escargots, for instance! Don’t worry about the cost. Jonathan can certainly afford it."

Evelyn cringed internally. She desperately wanted to disappear.



Judith proceeded to order an extravagant spread—most of it spicy. Knowing Nathaniel disliked heavily spiced food, Evelyn instinctively spoke up. "Mrs. Reeves, could we add some milder dishes? Mr. Whitmore prefers lighter flavors."

Silence fell over the table.

Only then did Evelyn realize her slip. She had blurted it out without thinking, realizing none of Judith’s choices suited Nathaniel’s tastes.

Both Nathaniel and Jonathan stared at her. Her heart skipped a beat before she hastily explained, "Mr. Whitmore is my cousin, so of course I know his preferences."

Nathaniel smirked, playing along. "How thoughtful of you, Evelyn. I didn’t realize you paid such close attention."

Her smile tightened. "Funny, isn’t it? I always remember my family’s preferences."

That infuriating man. She knew full well he was mocking her.

Without missing a beat, Judith linked arms with her, gushing, "Evelyn, I had no idea you were so attentive! That’s wonderful. Jonathan is always busy and doesn’t bother with such details. I’d feel much better knowing you’re looking after him."

An uncomfortable tension settled over the room. Evelyn could feel Nathaniel’s gaze burning into her.
###Chapter 303

The situation was becoming increasingly uncomfortable for Evelyn as Judith Reeves continued her relentless efforts to pair her with Jonathan.

She was still legally married to Nathaniel, and carrying his child. There was no way Judith would accept her once she found out, not when she adored Jonathan so much.

Yet Evelyn hadn't found the right moment to explain everything, especially not with Nathaniel sitting right there at the table.

Her pulse quickened when Judith started making obvious matchmaking comments in front of Nathaniel - the man who would soon be her ex-husband. An uneasy laugh escaped her lips.

"Mrs. Reeves, our food has arrived. Shouldn't we eat first?"

"Evelyn darling, why so shy? We're all friends here." Judith beamed. "And what perfect timing that your cousin could finally meet Jonathan today! There's nothing to be embarrassed about. Isn't it natural for couples to introduce each other to their families eventually?"

Evelyn wished the ground would swallow her whole. Where was Judith getting these ideas from?

She'd only agreed to this lunch to thank Jonathan for his help. That was all.

But Judith made it sound like they'd been dating seriously and were preparing for marriage.

Nathaniel's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "Is that so? Evelyn, I wasn't aware you were seeing someone."

His words sent ice through Evelyn's veins, but Judith answered before she could. "Mr. Whitmore, you should have seen it! When Evelyn was kidnapped last month, it was Jonathan who rescued her. He even got hospitalized from injuries sustained fighting off those criminals. Doesn't that prove his devotion?"

Jonathan gave an embarrassed smile. "Mother, please. Let's enjoy our meal. I didn't do anything extraordinary that day."

"Don't be modest, Jonathan! You're her knight in shining armor!" Judith insisted. "And what better way to repay such bravery than with marriage?"

Evelyn could only stare in stunned silence. Had Judith completely lost her mind?

"Rescued her?" Nathaniel's deep voice cut through the tension like a knife.

Meeting his piercing gaze, Evelyn suddenly found herself speechless, forcing an awkward smile.

His lips pressed into a thin line before continuing, "Evelyn, if I recall correctly, wasn't it my helicopter that arrived first?"

Evelyn fought the urge to bolt from the restaurant. How could she possibly explain this mess?

As expected, Judith gasped dramatically. "A helicopter? That sounds like something out of an action movie!"

"Helicopters are... more efficient," Evelyn managed weakly.

"But terribly expensive, I imagine," Judith mused. "Must cost a fortune for just one trip."

Nathaniel answered casually, "Ten thousand dollars per ride is quite reasonable."

"Ten thousand dollars!" Judith's voice hit an octave higher.

Her expression shifted noticeably as she reassessed Nathaniel. She hadn't realized he possessed such wealth.

Jonathan remained composed. Being aware of Nathaniel's position as CEO of Whitmore Enterprises, the helicopter fare meant nothing to him.

What did surprise him was Nathaniel's personal involvement in Evelyn's rescue. She'd never mentioned this detail before. Did she still not fully trust him?

Jonathan resolved to earn her complete confidence.

If Nathaniel would go to such lengths for Evelyn, her connection to the Whitmore family must be significant. Successfully marrying her could substantially elevate his own status.
###Chapter 304



Jonathan's voice cut through the air sharply. "Evelyn, why didn't you tell me Mr. Whitmore was the one who saved you? I nearly missed the chance to thank him properly." He raised his glass. "Mr. Whitmore, this toast is for you."

Nathaniel glanced at the drink in Jonathan's hand, his lips curling into a faint, unamused smile.

"I don't drink."

An uncomfortable silence settled over the room. Jonathan quickly switched to a teacup, offering it instead. "Would tea be more suitable?"

Nathaniel ignored the gesture entirely. His piercing gaze shifted to Evelyn. "Evelyn, shouldn’t you be the one toasting me?"

Evelyn inhaled sharply. What was his problem? She had deliberately mentioned their cousin relationship to avoid exposing their true connection.

Hadn’t he been the one to establish this rule after their marriage? Why was he suddenly acting so unpredictably?

Judith nudged her arm insistently. "Evelyn, what are you waiting for? Offer Mr. Whitmore a toast! After everything he’s done—spending money and effort to rescue you—it’s the least you can do."

A glass of wine was thrust into Evelyn’s hands. She hesitated before murmuring, "Mrs. Reeves, I don’t drink either."

"Just one glass won’t hurt. It’s not strong. If you get tipsy, Jonathan can take you home. Don’t worry, he’s a gentleman—he won’t take advantage."

Evelyn winced. That wasn’t her concern.

Reluctantly, she stepped forward, glass in hand. When her eyes met Nathaniel’s, she caught the mocking glint in his gaze.

Before she could react, Jonathan stood and took the glass from her. "Evelyn, let me drink for you. You’re still recovering."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened as he stared at the glass in Jonathan’s grip.

His voice was icy. "Does her gratitude mean nothing?"

Jonathan stiffened, caught off guard. He had hoped to impress Nathaniel by stepping in, but the man’s refusal left him flustered.



The tension in the room thickened.

Nathaniel remained seated, his sleeves rolled up to reveal toned forearms. The light accentuated his sharp features, making him look every bit the untouchable aristocrat.

His gaze never left Evelyn, and she could see her own reflection in his piercing eyes. Flustered, she looked away and snatched the glass back from Jonathan.

"Nathaniel, thank you for saving me. This is for you."

She downed the drink in one go, only to realize too late it was vodka. The harsh burn made her eyes water instantly.

Coughing, she blinked up at Nathaniel, tears glistening in her lashes. She looked utterly pitiful.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. For a moment, he almost regretted pushing her.

Evelyn set the glass down unsteadily, her vision swimming. As she reached for a napkin, two hands suddenly grasped hers.
###Chapter 305



Evelyn remained frozen in place, her gaze darting between the two men flanking her. Nathaniel gripped one of her hands firmly, while Jonathan clung to the other.

She exhaled sharply, irritation lacing her voice. "Would you both mind letting go?"

Neither relented. Nathaniel's eyes darkened as he glared at Jonathan. "What gives you the right to hold her hand?"

Jonathan immediately released her, scrambling to pour a glass of warm water instead.

"Evelyn, drink this. It'll help settle your stomach."

"Thanks."

Before she could take it, she glanced pointedly at Nathaniel's hand—still wrapped around hers.

"Nathaniel, I don't need assistance anymore."

Her meaning was clear: Let go.

With obvious reluctance, he released her, shooting Jonathan a venomous look. Annoyance simmered beneath his composed exterior.

Wasn't Evelyn involved with Julian? So why was she here with Jonathan, meeting his mother?

Meanwhile, the warm water did little to ease Evelyn's nausea. After a few sips, she spun around and bolted for the restroom.

This was entirely Judith's fault. The drink beside her had looked like a harmless fruit cocktail—not straight vodka.

After emptying her stomach, she finally felt somewhat human again. Wiping her mouth, she stepped out into the hallway. A cold draft hit her, making her vision swim. Her legs wobbled dangerously.

"Careful."

A strong hand caught her arm, steadying her.

Dizziness overwhelmed her. Vodka was far more potent than she'd anticipated. Weak-limbed, she tilted her head up to meet Nathaniel's piercing gaze.

"Happy now?"



Had he enjoyed forcing her to drink and apologize?

Nathaniel studied her flushed cheeks and glassy eyes.

Adorable, even in this state.

He shrugged. "Just testing Jonathan for you. Pathetic how quickly he folded when I insisted you drink."

Evelyn's jaw clenched.

"You're unbelievable! I bet you're thrilled I had to drink and thank you!"

His lips curved slightly. "Not entirely inaccurate."

"Nathaniel Whitmore, you're insufferable!"

Furious, she shoved him—only to stumble as her legs gave out. Nathaniel yanked her against his chest, his voice dropping to a growl. "Be grateful I didn't expose our real relationship in front of them. Right, cousin?"

The audacity. Here she was, calling him her cousin in front of Jonathan—when he was still her husband.

Evelyn glowered up at him. "There is no relationship. And you're the one who said to keep it secret. Memory problems?"

Nathaniel stiffened. He had said that.

His gaze dropped to her dimple. An impulse struck him—he reached out and pinched her cheek.

Just as soft as he'd imagined. A smirk flickered before vanishing.

Evelyn winced, twisting away. "Let go! I need to get back."
###Chapter 306

"Are you certain?"

"Absolutely."

With Nathaniel's confirmation, he immediately released Evelyn's hand, watching as her body swayed dangerously to the side.

Instinct took over. Evelyn clutched at Nathaniel, determined to keep her balance. Falling now was not an option!

"Evelyn, let go!" Nathaniel's voice was laced with irritation.

Glancing up, Evelyn realized she had a death grip on his tie. Nathaniel's face had flushed red, his composure slipping.

A mischievous glint flickered in Evelyn's eyes. Feigning intoxication, she tightened her hold. "Oh dear, I feel so lightheaded. If I let go, I might just collapse."

Gasping for air after nearly being choked, Nathaniel wrapped his arms around Evelyn in a firm embrace.

"Evelyn, are you trying to be the death of your husband?" he quipped, having narrowly escaped suffocation.

Pressed against Nathaniel's chest, Evelyn could feel the warmth of his body through the thin fabric of his shirt.

The steady rhythm of his heartbeat thudded against her ear.

For a moment, Evelyn froze.

Why had Nathaniel pulled her into such a tight hold?

Struggling to breathe, she attempted to wriggle free, but Nathaniel's grip only tightened around her waist.

His voice dropped to a husky murmur. "Don't move."

The weight of his tone sent a shiver down her spine. This couldn’t continue.

Thinking fast, Evelyn leaned into her drunken act. "I want to go home! You brute, let me go!"

Despite the discomfort from her earlier tugging, Nathaniel softened his voice. "Hmm, stay still. I’ll take you back now."

Evelyn had expected anger, for him to release her so she could leave on her own.

Instead, his tone had turned unexpectedly gentle.

Was this really Nathaniel?

Just then, Jonathan's voice cut in. "Evelyn, are you alright?"

Caught off guard, Evelyn hesitated—should she respond or maintain her act?

Instinctively, she tried to turn toward him, but Nathaniel pulled her back firmly against his chest.

Evelyn's eyes widened slightly as she stole a glance at Nathaniel. What was he doing?

Shielding her in his arms, Nathaniel addressed Jonathan coolly. "She's had too much to drink. I’ll take her home."

"Is Evelyn really drunk? I’m sorry—my mother mixed up the drinks earlier. She mistook whiskey for juice."

Jonathan had only just learned Evelyn had been sipping whiskey, known for its strong kick.

A flicker of irritation crossed Nathaniel's expression. Now it made sense why Evelyn seemed so affected.

Holding her close, Nathaniel brushed past Jonathan with a warning. "Be more careful with drinks in the future."

Jonathan flushed. "My apologies, Mr. Whitmore. It was an honest mistake. My mother’s eyesight isn’t what it used to be."

Ignoring him, Nathaniel guided Evelyn into the elevator.

Trapped in his arms, Evelyn couldn’t even catch a glimpse of Jonathan.

Hearing Nathaniel defend her stirred something unfamiliar in her chest.

As the elevator doors closed, Jonathan turned back toward the private dining room.

Judith stood, frowning. "Jonathan, where did they go? Where’s Evelyn?"
###Chapter 307

Jonathan frowned. "Mr. Whitmore left with Evelyn, who seemed intoxicated. Mom, why would you deliberately switch her drinks?"

"Jonathan, think strategically. If you drank on Evelyn's behalf and ended up tipsy, it could create the perfect chance for her to care for you."

"Now picture this—Evelyn drinks a little too much, and you, being the gentleman, escort her home to ensure her safety."

"Wouldn’t that spark something between you two? A few drinks, a little vulnerability—before you know it, feelings blossom. It’s foolproof," Judith explained.

She saw this as Jonathan’s golden opportunity, convinced he was being too naive about romance.

After considering her perspective, Jonathan sighed. "Mom, I’ve told you repeatedly—don’t interfere."

"Mr. Whitmore wasn’t happy about Evelyn getting drunk, and I’m sure I’ve left a terrible impression."

He had viewed tonight’s dinner with Nathaniel as a crucial chance to make a good impression, something that could help him win Evelyn’s heart.

But Judith’s meddling had ruined everything.

Realizing the severity, Judith spoke urgently. "Jonathan, what do we do? Maybe I should talk to Mr. Whitmore myself and clarify."

"I’ll take full responsibility—say it was my mistake. A man of his status wouldn’t make a scene with a middle-aged woman like me."

"Hard to say. Let’s wait until Evelyn sobers up tomorrow. I’ll explain everything to her. Don’t worry—she’s not the type to hold grudges. If she’s fine with it, there won’t be any real consequences."

"That’s a relief. I know you’ll win her over eventually. With your charm, no woman can resist you for long."

Jonathan smirked, confident in his ability to sway women. Evelyn would be his—it was only a matter of time.

"Speaking of which, tell me more about Mr. Whitmore. He seems incredibly wealthy."

"Mom, Mr. Whitmore owns a publicly traded company. His family is very well-off. Why do you ask?"

Jonathan chose not to reveal Nathaniel’s true identity as the heir to the Whitmore fortune. The last thing he needed was Judith scheming again and ruining his plans.

Besides, a man of Nathaniel’s status likely preferred discretion.

"Jonathan, your cousin Natalie just returned from studying abroad. She’s single. Introducing her to Mr. Whitmore could elevate our family’s standing, don’t you think?"

"Mom, let’s discuss this later. Mr. Whitmore might not be interested."

"But Natalie is cultured, well-traveled—how could she not be a perfect match?" Judith insisted.

Jonathan nearly groaned. Nathaniel had once been engaged to Victoria Sinclair of the prestigious Sinclair family—and even that engagement fell through.

There was no way someone like Natalie could compare.

Pulling out his phone, Jonathan sent Evelyn a message: Evelyn, I’m so sorry. My mother accidentally served you hard liquor, causing you to get drunk.

He wanted to explain beforehand so his apology tomorrow wouldn’t seem insincere.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed, but she ignored it.

She was currently playing the role of a drunk woman—checking her phone would ruin the act.

Still, she worried. What if it was her family? If Julian found her like this, she’d be in serious trouble.

Leaning against the car seat, Evelyn felt lightheaded despite being fully aware.

Thankfully, she had forced herself to vomit the whiskey earlier in the restaurant restroom. Otherwise, she’d be far worse off.

Slumped in her seat, she wondered where Nathaniel was taking her.

He probably didn’t even know her current address.

A knot of unease tightened in her stomach.

Beside her, Nathaniel studied her intoxicated state, rubbing his temples as if unsure what to do next.
###Chapter 308

Frederick glanced at the rearview mirror. "Sir, where should I drive to?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Don't ask me. Ask her."

Frederick stole another look at Evelyn, who was fast asleep in the backseat. Lowering his voice, he said, "Sir, Mrs. Whitmore is already asleep."

Nathaniel turned his head to study Evelyn beside him.

Her lashes rested against her cheeks, her breathing steady. He exhaled sharply. "Take us home."

The car changed direction. Forty minutes later, they arrived at the gates of the marital estate.

Nathaniel stepped out and bent to lift Evelyn from the seat.

Evelyn wasn’t fully asleep. The moment she felt movement, she stirred slightly. But when she realized Nathaniel was carrying her, she kept her eyes shut.

Her pulse quickened as she listened to his footsteps. Where was he taking her?

To a hotel?

Then she heard Abigail’s voice. "Sir, Mrs. Whitmore seems intoxicated. Should I prepare some broth for her?"

Nathaniel’s reply was curt. "Yes."

Without another word, he carried her upstairs.

Evelyn recognized the familiar scent of their bedroom—the one she had decorated herself.

Her thoughts tangled. Should she pretend to keep sleeping or wake up now?

Before she could decide, she felt the softness of the mattress beneath her.

Nathaniel set her down gently, then shrugged off his jacket, his forehead damp from carrying her.

He strode to the bathroom without another glance. The sound of running water soon filled the room.

Evelyn cracked her eyes open. The bedroom was exactly as she remembered—warm, elegant, painfully familiar.

Her chest tightened. She hadn’t expected to return here before finalizing the divorce.

Her phone buzzed.

She snatched it up and whispered, "Aunt Margaret?"

"Evelyn, where are you? Why aren’t you home yet?"

"I’m working late at the studio. Don’t wait up. If I need a ride, I’ll call my brothers."

Margaret hesitated but finally relented. "Alright. Be careful."

Evelyn hung up and noticed a text from Jonathan.

Sorry about the whiskey mix-up.

She sighed. Janice—no, Judith—had given her the wrong drink.

Evelyn didn’t reply.

She stared at the ceiling, torn again. Should she keep pretending to sleep?

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Abigail entered with a tray. "Mrs. Whitmore, some warm broth might help."

Decision made.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Thank you."

Propped against the headboard, she sipped the broth. Abigail knew her tastes well—the warmth settled her stomach instantly.

"Mrs. Whitmore, I’ve left some snacks by the bedside. Toast, mostly. In case you get hungry later."

Evelyn realized she was hungry.

She’d barely eaten at dinner, too distracted by the whiskey and its aftermath.

She nibbled on the toast. Pregnancy meant she couldn’t skip meals.

The bathroom door swung open.

Nathaniel stepped out, a towel slung low on his hips.

His gaze landed on Evelyn, now wide awake and eating.

His brows furrowed.
###Chapter 309

Upon spotting Nathaniel, Abigail discreetly slipped out of the bedroom, carefully shutting the door behind her.

Evelyn froze when she saw Nathaniel, her eyes locking with his intense gaze. "I promise I won't get crumbs on the sheets," she said quickly.

She knew all too well about Nathaniel's obsessive cleanliness, especially regarding food in bed - an absolute dealbreaker for him.

But hunger overruled propriety right now. When a pregnant woman craved food, nothing else mattered. The twins in her womb were already protesting loudly, completely unconcerned about social niceties.

Nathaniel stood by the bed, his dark hair still glistening with moisture.

A few damp strands fell across his forehead, softening his usually stern features and giving him an aristocratic elegance that made him look like a prince from some European portrait.

His robe hung open slightly, revealing his sculpted chest. Evelyn's eyes traced a single water droplet as it slid down his skin, disappearing beneath the fabric.

She swallowed hard, suddenly aware of how dry her throat had become.

Nathaniel's voice was low when he finally spoke. "You and Jonathan seem quite close. Meeting parents already?"

Evelyn's lips parted in surprise before she recovered. "It's not like that. Jonathan got hurt protecting me last month, so I treated him to dinner as thanks."

"His mother just happened to bring over homemade food that night. Pure coincidence we all ate together."

She and Jonathan weren't dating, let alone at the family-introduction stage of any relationship.

As her explanation sank in, the storm clouds in Nathaniel's eyes cleared slightly. Perhaps he'd misjudged the situation.

His voice deepened. "Do I get a thank-you dinner too? Or have you forgotten who actually saved you that night?"

Evelyn set down her snack. "With your busy schedule, I assumed you wouldn't have time for something so trivial."

"Consider this my private expression of gratitude then. May your business ventures prosper and your life be peaceful."

Her words irritated Nathaniel. She'd invited Jonathan without hesitation but made excuses when it came to him. The double standard stung.

Sometimes he wondered if Evelyn was some divine test of his patience.

Suppressing his annoyance, he changed tactics. "Have you considered leaving that studio? A small operation like that limits your growth."

"And frankly, Jonathan doesn't strike me as trustworthy."

To Nathaniel, both Judith and her son seemed problematic, with Jonathan being particularly transparent in his intentions. Did the man really think no one noticed how he looked at Evelyn?

Nathaniel could practically see the schemes brewing behind Jonathan's smile. If Evelyn stayed at that studio, who knew what trouble she might encounter?

Evelyn hesitated. "Not right now."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Is he really that important to you?"

She looked away. "Think whatever you want."

What Nathaniel didn't know was that in a few months, Evelyn would be leaving Bern City entirely for Nord City.

Quitting the studio would be simple compared to resigning from a major corporation.

"Evelyn, if not for Grandmother, I wouldn't even bother with you."

Furious, Nathaniel stalked toward the walk-in closet, done with this conversation.

Left alone, Evelyn quietly finished every last snack on the tray.

Wiping her mouth, she sank back into the pillows, finally satisfied.

The alcohol still fogged her mind, making her drowsy. All she wanted now was to close her eyes and drift off.

When Nathaniel returned, now dressed in a crisp suit, he found Evelyn fast asleep. Her sundress had ridden up slightly, revealing toned legs that made his breath catch.
###Chapter 310

Nathaniel's eyes trailed down Evelyn's bare legs. Had he not known about her recent drinking spree, he might have mistaken it for a deliberate attempt to tempt him.

Ever since he'd brought up divorce, Evelyn had changed. Every encounter left him irritated yet strangely helpless.

After watching her sleep for a few moments, Nathaniel quietly stepped out of the bedroom.

He found Abigail waiting in the hallway. "When she wakes up, make sure she eats something to sober up properly. She needs to remember this lesson."

"Of course, Mr. Whitmore. I'll take excellent care of Mrs. Whitmore," Abigail assured him.

The title "Mrs. Whitmore" made Nathaniel pause, but he said nothing as he strode away.

Robert stood outside the penthouse, wiping sweat from his brow. He hadn't dared interrupt, so he'd waited anxiously for Nathaniel to emerge.

"Sir!" Robert brightened when he saw him. "The meeting started on schedule. I've already switched it to a video conference. Your laptop is ready in the car."

"Good."

Nathaniel ducked into the backseat, immediately pulling up the meeting on his screen.

If not for Evelyn's antics today, he wouldn't have been this late.

Evelyn stretched as she woke, blinking at the dim evening light filtering through the curtains. She'd only meant to nap briefly, but exhaustion had pulled her into a deep sleep.

A glance at her phone confirmed it was past dinner time.

Thankfully, she'd warned Margaret she'd be working late. If her brothers found out she'd been day-drinking whiskey, she'd never hear the end of it.

"Mrs. Whitmore, you're awake?" Abigail entered with a glass of ice-cold lemon water. "This will help. What would you like for dinner? I can prepare anything."

Evelyn took a sip, the tartness sharpening her senses. "Don't trouble yourself. I won't be staying."

The sooner she left, the better.

With the divorce nearly finalized, lingering here felt wrong.

As she stood, Abigail hesitated. "Mrs. Whitmore, since you're here... could you help me with something?"

Evelyn raised a brow. "I haven't been back in ages. What could I possibly assist with?"

Abigail sighed. "I've been organizing Mr. Whitmore's walk-in closet, but no matter what I do, he's never satisfied. I keep getting scolded."

Evelyn exhaled in sympathy. She remembered those early days, learning Nathaniel's exacting preferences through trial and error.

Stepping into the closet, she surveyed the familiar space—every shelf, every drawer held memories of her three years here.

"Listen carefully," Evelyn said. "On gloomy days, pair this shade of innerwear with this tie. For clear weather, use this jacket."

"If he's in a bad mood, go with this combination. If he's cheerful, stick to the fair-weather outfit."

Abigail frowned. "But how do I tell his mood?"

Evelyn paused. "Simple. Prepare two options and let him choose."

She smirked. "Never decide for him. He's fussy, controlling, and impossible to please. Whatever you pick, he'll hate it."

"Evelyn, is this how you've always described me?"

A deep voice cut through the air.

Silence fell. Abigail paled.

"Sir!" she stammered.

Nathaniel stood in the doorway, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 311

Evelyn sighed in exasperation, realizing the day had taken an unexpected turn.

She had planned to put in extra hours at the design studio, only to stumble upon Jonathan and Judith sharing an intimate lunch.

The awkwardness compounded when she found herself seated near Nathaniel in the same upscale restaurant.

To top it all off, she'd accidentally sipped from a glass of whiskey mistakenly served to her.

Perhaps Evelyn should check her horoscope before leaving home tomorrow.

Nathaniel stood framed in the walk-in closet doorway, his imposing figure demanding attention.

His piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn, who had just finished making unflattering remarks about him.

As Nathaniel remained motionless, memories from their past marriage came flooding back.

In those days, Evelyn would always greet him at the door when he returned from work, standing attentively like a dutiful wife.

They would proceed to their bedroom's walk-in closet where she'd carefully laid out his evening attire.

Though accustomed to her constant presence, Nathaniel had sensed something missing during this period - he just couldn't identify what.

Now, seeing Evelyn standing in the dressing room, he finally understood what had been absent.

"Nothing to say now?" Nathaniel remarked casually. "You were quite articulate moments ago."

Evelyn cleared her throat. "Actually, I rarely speak ill of people behind their backs."

"Spare me the act. Did I mishear you earlier?"

Maintaining perfect composure, Evelyn clarified, "No, Mr. Whitmore, you heard correctly. I simply prefer giving criticism directly rather than gossiping."

The moment the words left her lips, Evelyn noticed Nathaniel's expression darken.

Sensing the rising tension, Abigail discreetly exited the dressing room, wisely avoiding the brewing conflict.

Seeing Nathaniel's stormy expression, Evelyn felt an unexpected surge of satisfaction.

After three years of marriage, Evelyn had mastered both how to please Nathaniel and how to provoke him.

Having endured years of submission only to be discarded, why should she bother catering to his whims now?

Nathaniel caught the mischievous glint in Evelyn's eyes, realizing she was deliberately trying to rile him.

"Since when have I been difficult to please?" he countered quietly. "Even when your fashion choices were questionable, I never complained."

"Oh please," Evelyn scoffed. "Remember when you accused me of being colorblind over slightly darker bedsheets?"

"And what about those ill-fitting shoes you insisted on wearing? I went to multiple stores to find comfortable ones for you."

"Yet you complained they weren't prestigious enough. Need I go on? How can you claim you never made things difficult?"

Evelyn poured out her grievances, emotions laid bare.

Nathaniel remained silent, his stormy expression deepening.

Evelyn stole a glance, noting the dark shadows in his eyes that betrayed his anger - exactly the reaction she wanted.

If Nathaniel hadn't reacted with anger, it would mean her words had failed to land.

"Honestly," Nathaniel said calmly, "Abigail seems to be struggling in her role. Perhaps she should consider resigning."

Evelyn's face darkened as she defended her friend. "Abigail has improved tremendously."

"Mr. Whitmore, you're being overly critical - a trait you seem unaware of in yourself," she fired back.

Using Abigail as leverage was truly despicable.

Unfazed, Nathaniel leaned casually against the wardrobe, his icy gaze fixed on Evelyn.

"Given Abigail's current challenges, I'm prepared to handle the situation personally. Ultimately, I care about results, not process."

Was Nathaniel suggesting Evelyn become his personal stylist again?

"I'm an interior designer now," she retorted. "I don't work without compensation."

"How about a thousand dollars?" Nathaniel offered.

"You think I can be bought that easily?"

"Three thousand."

Evelyn scoffed. "Mr. Whitmore, you clearly have money to burn. But really, styling my ex-husband?"

"Ten thousand dollars," Nathaniel stated flatly.

Evelyn paused, then said coolly, "Ten thousand per session, no revisions."

Nathaniel smirked. "What happened to your principles?"
###Chapter 312

"Absolutely correct. But considering my expertise as a designer, I can't just decline a styling request, can I?"

When it came to dressing her ex-husband, Evelyn was willing—for a price.

Charging ten thousand dors per session was undeniably profitable.

Nathaniel casually handed his phone to Abigail. "Handle the arrangements. I have other matters to attend to."

Evelyn clenched her teeth. "Payment upfront, please."

Nathaniel swiftly retrieved his phone and transferred the agreed amount.

Seeing the ten thousand dors reflected in her account, Evelyn inhaled deeply and plastered on a professional smile.

"Do you have any specific preferences for the outfit? Or details about the event you're attending?"

Nathaniel arched a brow, impressed by her sudden professionalism. "A business gala this weekend."

With that, he strode out of the bedroom.

Evelyn leaned back, exhaling slowly.

She knew exactly what Nathaniel should wear to a business gala—but executing it would be bitter.

Then, as she stared at the freshly deposited ten thousand dors, an idea struck.

"Abigail, open the bottom drawer. There's a bright red suit inside. Pair it with these accessories and leave it here."

Abigail eyed the vibrant ensemble skeptically. "Are you certain about this?"

Nathaniel’s wardrobe was typically filled with neutrals—black, white, gray. This choice was... bold.

"Trust my judgment. I’m the stylist here," Evelyn assured, though she knew Nathaniel would never pick this himself.

That was precisely why she chose it.

If he trusted her enough to let her style him, she might as well have some fun with it.

After finalizing the outfit, Evelyn left the marital villa in high spirits.

She hailed a taxi and arrived at her neighborhood entrance.

Hunger gnawed at her, so she stopped at a street vendor for tacos.

Just as she took her first bite, Julian’s voice startled her from behind. "Evelyn, what are you eating?"

Her posture stiffened briefly before she turned.

Julian stepped out of his car, his expression unreadable.

"I was just grabbing a late-night snack," she explained quickly.

Admitting she hadn’t eaten dinner would only earn her another lecture.

He joined her, ordering tacos for himself. "Watching you eat made me hungry."

Relieved by his calm demeanor, Evelyn relaxed.

They sat across from each other, savoring their meal in comfortable silence.

Afterward, they walked side by side toward the residential area.

Evelyn wasn’t surprised to see Julian—he owned property nearby too.

"You look exhausted," he observed.

She touched her face and chuckled. "Just work stress."

"Evelyn, carrying twins is no small feat. Maybe you should consider taking a break from work and focusing on your studies."

After a pause, she nodded. "I’ll talk to Jonathan at the studio later."

Lately, work had been overwhelming—especially with the unwanted attention.

Maintaining a low profile seemed the safest option.

Julian gently brushed her hair back. "Being a single mother won’t be easy. Are you sure you want to keep Nathaniel’s children?"
###Chapter 313

Hearing Julian's words, Evelyn lowered her gaze and murmured, "Julian, I've already decided to keep the babies."

To her, the twins growing inside her were her family - completely separate from Nathaniel.

Julian gently ruffled Evelyn's hair. "Your brothers and I have stable careers now. We'll take care of you and the twins. You don't need to push yourself so hard."

"I know," Evelyn replied softly.

Her mind was made up. Once she completed her credits, she would graduate and leave this place behind.

Returning home, Evelyn immediately headed to shower and prepare for bed.

In the master suite, Nathaniel finished his work in the study and entered the bedroom. His eyes fell on the matching outfit laid out - and he froze at the sight of the bright red suit.

Was this really what Evelyn had selected for him?

Had he not seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have believed it.

Without hesitation, Nathaniel called Evelyn. She answered on the second ring, her voice calm. "Yes?"

Rubbing his temples, Nathaniel demanded, "Is this seriously the outfit you picked? It's blindingly red. Do you have some kind of color deficiency?"

"I think it suits you perfectly. But you're welcome not to wear it."

"Evelyn, I paid ten thousand dollars for your professional opinion, and this is what I get? Really?"

Evelyn struggled to contain her laughter. Composing herself, she stated firmly, "Per our agreement, no changes after payment."

"Is this how you treat all your clients?"

"No. Consider this a life lesson about trusting people too easily."

With that, Evelyn hung up, collapsing into giggles as she rolled across the bed.

Taking Nathaniel's money had been absolutely worth it.

His arrogance was astounding - thinking he could use wealth to humiliate her. It was time he learned not everyone could be bought.

Furious, Nathaniel glared at his phone before roughly tearing off his tie. Evelyn was like some divine punishment sent specifically to torment him.

How dare she charge him ten thousand dollars for this?

He felt like a complete fool.

The next morning, Evelyn returned to work, contemplating how to resign gracefully from Jonathan's studio.

Balancing work and studies was becoming increasingly difficult as her pregnancy progressed.

Entering the studio, she found an extravagant bouquet of roses on her desk.

A jealous coworker remarked, "Evelyn, Mr. Reeves personally placed those there. Even though he told us not to talk about it, everyone's green with envy."

Evelyn's expression tightened. It was time to clarify things with Jonathan.

Knocking on his office door, she was greeted by his warm smile. "Evelyn! What can I do for you?"

"Jonathan, I've decided to resign."

His smile vanished. "Evelyn, if this is about yesterday's lunch incident with the drinks, I sincerely apologize."

"My mother isn't used to fine dining and mistook the labels. It was an honest mistake."

"Jonathan, I understand about the drinks. But my decision isn't about that."

"My coursework has become overwhelming lately."

Jonathan responded quickly. "If it's too much, you don't need to come in. Remember our arrangement? Work when you can - no pressure."

Evelyn hesitated. "I appreciate that, but it wouldn't be fair to the team."

"I've been exhausted recently. I think it's best I take a break. Maybe after graduation I can return."
###Chapter 314

"Evelyn, even so, there's no need for you to resign."

Jonathan's voice was calm, but his fingers tapped restlessly against the desk. "The studio environment is relaxed, and you shouldn't feel it's unfair to your colleagues just because of your unique situation."

Evelyn blinked in surprise as he continued, "Evelyn, given everything we've been through together, I think you can sense how I feel about you. Do you... feel the same?"

Her response was immediate. "I'm sorry, Jonathan. I've only ever seen you as a friend."

A shadow of disappointment crossed his face, but he masked it quickly. After a brief silence, he exhaled slowly. "Then how about a compromise? You could switch to working weekends instead."

His tone turned persuasive. "Your talent has brought so much business to this studio. If you leave abruptly, it would hurt us all."

"Please," he added, his voice softening. "For the sake of our friendship. Could you at least consider coming in on weekends?"

Evelyn hesitated, her gaze lingering on the faint scar above his eyebrow—a remnant of an accident years ago. Finally, she nodded. "Alright."

Relief washed over him. "And Evelyn, about my mother's mistake yesterday... please don't hold it against her."

She offered a small smile. "Don't worry. It's not an issue."

Returning to her seat, she felt distracted. Tomorrow was Eleanor's surgery, and the thought made her stomach twist with nerves.

That evening, she waited for Julian to finish work before bringing it up.

His expression remained steady as he reassured her. "Grandmother Eleanor's condition has been stable. If the surgery goes as planned, there shouldn't be any complications. You don’t need to worry."

She let out a slow breath. That was something, at least.

The next morning, Evelyn woke early, her mind already racing.

Margaret raised an eyebrow as she entered the kitchen. "You're up before sunrise. Don't your Monday lectures start in the afternoon?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Aunt Margaret, Eleanor is having surgery today. I need to be there."

Margaret's face softened. "Of course. Go. Eleanor is a strong woman. I’m sure everything will go smoothly."

Evelyn had barely slept, her thoughts tangled in worry.

In the taxi, her stomach growled loudly. The twins were making their displeasure known.

She stopped at a café near the hospital, grabbing a quick breakfast.

As she stepped onto the hospital grounds, a sleek sports car screeched past, nearly hitting her.

She jerked back, her soy milk splashing onto the pavement.

Victoria stepped out of the car, smirking. "Evelyn, I always thought you were fearless. Guess even you have moments of weakness."

Evelyn's eyes darkened.

Her hand instinctively cradled her belly before she bent down, scooping up the spilled soy milk—and hurling it straight at Victoria's car.

The liquid splattered across the leather seats.

Victoria gasped. "Are you insane? Do you have any idea how much this car costs? You couldn’t afford it in ten lifetimes!"

Without a word, Evelyn grabbed a fistful of Victoria's hair, yanking her close. Her voice was ice. "Try me."
###Chapter 315

Evelyn's icy glare locked onto Victoria. "I warned you before not to test me. Clearly, you haven't learned your lesson."

Moments ago, Victoria had deliberately tried to run her over. If Evelyn hadn't dodged in time, the outcome could have been catastrophic.

Even if Victoria hadn't intended to kill her, as a pregnant woman, Evelyn couldn't risk such reckless endangerment.

Rage burned through Evelyn's veins as she glared at Victoria.

The woman truly was a venomous snake.

Victoria struggled, but Evelyn's grip on her hair was unrelenting. Every slight movement sent sharp pains across her scalp.

Through gritted teeth, Victoria hissed, "You're delusional. I never touched you. But you damaged my car—you'll pay for every scratch!"

"Whether you admit it or not, the truth is obvious. Surveillance cameras don't lie," Evelyn countered coolly.

"Call the police if you want. I don't care. But think carefully—who do you think they'll arrest?"

With a sharp yank, Evelyn delivered a stinging slap across Victoria's face. "If you dare provoke me again, I won't be this merciful."

Releasing her grip, Evelyn dusted her hands off dismissively. "If it weren't for Eleanor's surgery today, this wouldn't end here."

"Consider this my good deed—accumulating blessings for Eleanor's recovery."

With Eleanor in critical condition, Evelyn refused to escalate things further.

Victoria clutched her throbbing scalp, humiliation burning through her. Never in her life had she been treated this way.

She wouldn't let it stand.

"You think just because Eleanor favors you, you can do whatever you want?" Victoria spat. "Beatrice despises you. Remember that."

A dark wish flickered in Victoria's mind—if only Eleanor wouldn't survive the surgery. Then nothing would stand between her and Nathaniel.

With Beatrice on her side, Evelyn would never compare.

"I'm not cash. I don't need everyone to like me," Evelyn shot back.

Her eyes glinted with something dangerous, sending a chill down Victoria's spine.

This wasn't the Evelyn she knew. Victoria had gravely underestimated her.

Without another word, Evelyn turned and strode into the hospital. She wouldn't waste another second on Victoria.

Moments later, Victoria caught up, but Evelyn ignored her completely.

Smoothing her hair, Victoria reminded herself why she was here—to see Eleanor. Appearances mattered.

As for Evelyn? She'd deal with her later—with Beatrice's help.

At the elevator, two broad-shouldered bodyguards in black blocked their path.

One stepped forward, halting Victoria. "No entry permitted."

Evelyn, however, walked past unchallenged.

Victoria's eyes widened. "Why is she allowed in?"

Even Evelyn paused, surprised by the restriction.

The bodyguard's tone was flat. "Only Whitmores permitted today. She's family. You're not."

Evelyn glanced back, lips curling in disdain.

"Like I said—as long as I'm here, you'll never take my place." She clicked her tongue mockingly. "Wait outside like a good girl."

Furious, Victoria stomped her foot and dialed Penelope. How dare they stop her from visiting Eleanor?

Outside the ward, more bodyguards stood watch.

The heavy tension in the air confirmed it—today's surgery was no ordinary procedure.
###Chapter 316

Evelyn gave a soft knock before pushing open the hospital room door, her lips curving into a warm smile. "Grandmother, I've come to see you."

Eleanor's face brightened at the sight of her. "Evelyn, you're here so early. Have you eaten breakfast?"

"I have, thank you." Evelyn stepped closer, studying Eleanor's expression. The older woman's cheerful demeanor reassured her—she was in good health today.

Eleanor reached out, gently clasping Evelyn's hand. "I'm perfectly fine, dear. No need to fuss over me. My mind is set on one thing—meeting your little one soon." She chuckled. "I've faced far worse in my youth. Do you really think something as small as this could keep me down?"

At the mention of the baby, Evelyn's chest tightened with guilt. While everyone believed it was a lie, she alone knew the truth—she was carrying Nathaniel's child.

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn guided Eleanor's hand to rest lightly against her barely-there bump. "Grandmother, the baby is waiting for you to get better too."

Eleanor's eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she gazed at Evelyn's stomach. "How wonderful. When they arrive, I'll teach them everything, just like I did with Nathaniel when he was a boy."

"We'll both look forward to that," Evelyn murmured, silently willing the twins inside her to hold on until Eleanor safely returned from surgery.

Just then, Eleanor's attention shifted toward the doorway. "Nathaniel, come here. There's something I need to discuss with all of you."

Evelyn turned to see Nathaniel stepping inside. Today, he had forgone his usual tailored suits for more relaxed attire—a crisp white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, dark trousers. The change softened his usual imposing presence, making him appear almost approachable.

He moved to Eleanor's bedside. "Grandmother, can't this wait until after your procedure? We'll have plenty of time later."

Evelyn nodded in agreement. "She's right. There's no hurry. Just focus on resting. We'll be right outside the entire time."

The door swung open again, revealing Beatrice and Penelope.

Beatrice's expression darkened momentarily when she spotted Evelyn, but she quickly schooled her features. With Eleanor's surgery looming, she couldn't afford to make a scene.

Once Eleanor recovered, dealing with Evelyn would become trivial.

Nathaniel's current tolerance of Evelyn was clearly out of concern for his grandmother's condition.

Eleanor waved a dismissive hand. "Some matters shouldn't wait. Listen carefully—when Evelyn's child is born, they will inherit the Whitmore legacy."

Evelyn stiffened. Why would Eleanor make such a declaration now?

Beatrice's lips thinned. "Madam Whitmore, isn't this decision rather premature? Our family's enterprises are vast. What if the chosen heir proves... inadequate?"

She left the rest unspoken—if Victoria married Nathaniel later and bore his child, would that child be excluded from succession? The Sinclair family would never accept such terms.

Besides, Evelyn's pregnancy was a sham. Eleanor was taking this charade too far.

Eleanor's gaze turned steely. "Any child of Nathaniel's will be exceptional. With his guidance, how could they possibly fail?"

She produced a document from her bedside table and handed it to Nathaniel. "This contract ensures your child's position as heir. Sign it."
###Chapter 317

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat as she stared at the legal document Eleanor had thrust into her hands.

The revelation that her unborn twins had been officially named heirs to the Whitmore fortune left her completely stunned.

Though initially shocked, Evelyn tried to convince herself this was just another of Eleanor's whims - something that could be reversed after the surgery.

But Eleanor had gone beyond mere words. She'd prepared binding legal documents and was now demanding Nathaniel's immediate signature.

Once signed, this would become ironclad.

Evelyn's resolve hardened. She wouldn't let her children become pawns in the Whitmore dynasty.

Beatrice's hands trembled as she snatched the papers from Eleanor.

Scanning the contents, her face paled. The implications were so staggering she nearly collapsed.

"Mother, this is absurd!" Beatrice exclaimed. "Why force Nathaniel to sign now? Don't you trust your own grandson?"

Eleanor's gaze turned steely. "It's not Nathaniel I distrust. It's the vultures circling this family."

She pointed a bony finger at the document. "No matter what happens between these two, Evelyn's children will inherit. That's final."

Beatrice swallowed hard. "And if she bears daughters?"

"Gender is irrelevant!" Eleanor snapped.

The unexpected ultimatum before surgery had caught everyone off guard, especially Beatrice.

Desperate, she turned to Nathaniel. "Please talk sense into your grandmother!"

Beatrice saw this as an obvious trap.

Their plan had been simple: have Nathaniel divorce Evelyn post-surgery. But signing this document changed everything.

Evelyn could use legal technicalities to avoid divorce, even manipulate Nathaniel into conceiving again.

Beatrice wouldn't allow it. Victoria was her chosen daughter-in-law, and Evelyn wouldn't stand in the way.

Nathaniel took the document, his voice icy. "I refuse."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. The document must remain unsigned.

Beatrice nodded vigorously. "Exactly! This isn't the time for such decisions."

Eleanor's piercing gaze locked onto Nathaniel. "Explain yourself."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "I'll sign... after your surgery. Not a moment before."

Evelyn's head snapped up in shock. She studied Nathaniel's profile, searching for some clue to his sudden compliance.

How could he agree to this?

Beatrice looked positively ill. "Nathaniel! Have you lost your mind?"

If he consented now, what future would Victoria's children have? Would her son be denied his birthright?

Nathaniel ignored his mother's outburst.

He tossed the document onto Eleanor's bedside table. "If you have so little faith in me, perhaps you should handle family matters yourself."

The air crackled with tension as grandmother and grandson engaged in a silent battle of wills.

Two titans of the Whitmore empire clashing, while lesser mortals held their breath.

Evelyn gently took Eleanor's hand. "Grandmother, Nathaniel makes a valid point. Let's discuss this after your procedure. There's no urgency—"

"No!" Eleanor's voice cracked like a whip. "Either he signs now, or I cancel the surgery entirely."

Nathaniel's lips thinned. "Must you be so unreasonable?"

Eleanor's eyes flashed. "At my age, I've earned the right to be unreasonable. Sign the damn papers, boy. Must we argue over everything?"
###Chapter 318



Evelyn noticed Eleanor growing restless and quickly moved to soothe her.

She retrieved the document and pressed it into Nathaniel’s hands. "Sign it," she urged, her voice firm yet pleading.

When Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet Nathaniel’s, she found his eyes narrowed slightly, dark and unreadable.

The tension between them was palpable as she pushed the papers toward him. "For Eleanor’s sake, just sign it. If you don’t, she won’t agree to the surgery."

Eleanor scoffed. "That’s right. If you refuse, I won’t go through with it. Even if you drag me into that operating room, I’ll walk right back out."

Standing alone, Evelyn could feel Beatrice’s venomous glare burning into her. If looks could kill, she’d have been struck down on the spot.

In the end, Nathaniel relented. He took the document and signed it with a swift, decisive stroke.

Evelyn exhaled in relief as she handed the signed papers to Eleanor. "It’s done. Nathaniel signed. Are you satisfied now?"

Eleanor’s lips curled in approval before she turned the document back toward Evelyn. "Now it’s your turn."

Evelyn hesitated. "You only asked for Nathaniel’s signature earlier. I never agreed to sign."

Her words sent a ripple of shock through the room. No one had expected her to refuse.

Nathaniel’s eyes sharpened with curiosity. Just moments ago, she had convinced him to sign—why the sudden change?

Eleanor frowned. "Evelyn, why won’t you sign?" After all, she had fought tooth and nail for Evelyn’s rights. Why was she being so difficult now?

Evelyn gently squeezed Eleanor’s hand. "With Nathaniel’s signature, the document is already legally binding."

She softened her voice. "I’d rather sign it with you after your surgery. When you’re well again. Would that be alright?"

Eleanor’s breath caught. She realized then—Evelyn was delaying her own signature because she feared this might be Eleanor’s last request.



Tears welled in Eleanor’s eyes. "Why are you being so stubborn?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "They say fools have the best luck. The baby and I will be waiting for you when you come out."

She understood. Eleanor was preparing for the worst, ensuring everything was settled. But Evelyn refused to accept that. She needed Eleanor to come back.

Nathaniel watched Evelyn, something shifting in his chest. He hadn’t expected her refusal to stem from genuine concern for Eleanor.

Soon, the medical team arrived.

Julian Montgomery strode in, his white coat crisp. His gaze swept over the gathered Whitmores before landing on Evelyn. He had known she would be here.

After performing the standard pre-op checks, Julian nodded. "Take Mrs. Whitmore to the OR."

Evelyn leaned down, pressing a kiss to Eleanor’s forehead. "We’ll all be here when you wake up."

Eleanor sighed but said nothing more about the document. She allowed herself to be wheeled away, surrounded by doctors and nurses.

Julian shot a cold glance at the Whitmores. If not for Evelyn, he wouldn’t have agreed to this surgery at all.

Beatrice stepped forward with a saccharine smile. "Dr. Montgomery, we’re counting on you. After all, we’re practically family now. No need for formalities."

Julian’s reply was icy. "I don’t consider myself part of this family."
###Chapter 319

Evelyn watched with quiet satisfaction as Julian confronted Victoria in the hospital corridor.

Victoria's perfectly manicured fingers tightened around her designer handbag. She hadn't expected Julian to be so brutally direct.

Was he still holding a grudge over Nathaniel canceling their engagement all those years ago?

What would happen next? Would the Montgomery family ever approve of her marrying into the Whitmore dynasty?

Julian shot Nathaniel an icy glare before turning to Evelyn. "The procedure today will take several hours."

"I recommend family members wait outside until we establish a proper rotation. You can take turns staying with Mrs. Whitmore Senior."

Evelyn understood Julian's unspoken concern for her wellbeing beneath his professional tone.

She had anticipated the lengthy surgery duration. Having secured special leave from university, she was prepared to stay the entire day.

Julian disappeared through the swinging doors moments later.

The Whitmore entourage followed, taking the private elevator reserved for VIP patients toward the operating theater.

At the elevator bank, they found Victoria waiting like a discarded ornament.

Beatrice feigned surprise. "Ms. Sinclair, what an unexpected... pleasure."

Victoria forced a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "I wanted to pay my respects to Mrs. Whitmore on her surgery day."

"But apparently," she added with a brittle laugh, "the elevator attendants consider me... what was the term? 'Unauthorized personnel.'"

The humiliation burned Victoria's cheeks. Earlier, she'd watched Evelyn stroll past security without so much as a second glance.

Beatrice's smile turned rigid. "My apologies, dear. I'll have words with security. You're practically family."

Victoria turned to Penelope with wounded eyes. "I've been calling and texting you for hours."

Penelope produced a well-rehearsed gasp. "I silenced my phone for the surgery! How thoughtless of me."

The two women exchanged a fleeting glance. They both knew Nathaniel had instituted the security protocols, and neither dared countermand his orders.

To save face, Beatrice had instructed Penelope to ignore Victoria's messages - a fact they'd never admit.

Hearing their excuses, Victoria's posture relaxed slightly. She needed to reclaim some dignity, especially in Evelyn's presence.

Turning to Nathaniel with practiced concern, Victoria purred, "Don't worry, darling. With Julian operating, everything will be perfect."

She emphasized Julian's name, ensuring Nathaniel remembered exactly who was granting this favor.

Beatrice jumped in. "Of course! We have complete faith in your brother's skill."

Victoria smirked, deliberately catching Evelyn's eye. However this played out, the Montgomerys had made Eleanor's surgery possible.

Evelyn remained impassive, well acquainted with Victoria's petty theatrics. She'd endure any provocation if it meant Eleanor received proper care.

Nathaniel's voice cut through the tension like winter wind. "Leave."

Victoria recoiled as if struck. After everything, these were his first words to her?

Had he forgotten who was performing his grandmother's life-saving surgery?
###Chapter 320

Nathaniel's cold demeanor sent a chill through the sterile hospital corridor.

Was he truly unconcerned about upsetting Victoria and the repercussions it might have on Eleanor’s surgery?

Beatrice swiftly stepped in, her voice laced with diplomacy. "Nathaniel, Ms. Sinclair came specifically for your grandmother. It's hardly appropriate to ask her to leave."

Nathaniel’s reply was glacial. "Perhaps those who bring Grandmother distress should keep their distance. We wouldn’t want to jeopardize the surgery’s outcome."

Evelyn barely suppressed a smirk.

She hadn’t expected Nathaniel to be so blunt.

Victoria’s lips trembled, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "Nathaniel, how can you speak to me like this? After everything I’ve done to make this surgery possible!"

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. "Are you certain Grandmother’s surgery is happening because of you, Victoria? Or have you spun so many lies that you’ve started believing them yourself?"

Victoria stiffened.

Under Nathaniel’s piercing scrutiny, unease coiled in her stomach. It felt as though he could see straight through her—as if he knew everything.

But that was impossible.

Unless…

Her eyes flicked to Evelyn. Had she dared to confess the truth?

No. Evelyn wouldn’t risk it. Not when she was entangled with Julian.

No man tolerated betrayal, and Evelyn, desperate to reclaim Nathaniel’s affection, wouldn’t be foolish enough to expose herself.

So Victoria clung to her stolen credit without hesitation.

Evelyn stood silently, acutely aware of the weight of their gazes.

Why were they staring at her like that?

Victoria forced a brittle smile. "Nathaniel, I don’t know what you’re implying. I’ve never lied to you."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened.

Did he really have to spell it out?

But revealing Evelyn and Julian’s affair now would only cause chaos. Beatrice would undoubtedly make a scene, and Eleanor, fragile post-surgery, didn’t need the stress.

Noticing Nathaniel’s darkening expression, Beatrice quickly guided Victoria aside.

"Ms. Sinclair, your concern for Eleanor is admirable. But there’s no need for you to wait here. I’ll inform you the moment there’s news."

If this escalated, the Whitmore-Sinclair alliance could crumble before it even began.

Victoria hesitated, then acquiesced. "Fine. I’ll wait downstairs. But I expect updates."

Beatrice offered a placating smile. "Would you like company? Waiting alone can be tedious."

Repairing this rift was essential.

Once Eleanor recovered, Nathaniel would have no reason to keep Evelyn around. Victoria’s place in the family was inevitable.

Satisfaction curled through Victoria as she shot Evelyn a triumphant glance.

This was the respect she deserved.

Beatrice turned to Evelyn, her tone dismissive. "You may leave as well. The surgery has started. Your presence is unnecessary."

Evelyn smirked—then casually dropped a document in front of Victoria.

The bold title glared up at them: "Whitmore Group Heir Agreement."
###Chapter 321

Evelyn deliberately let the folder slip from her fingers, ensuring it landed directly in Victoria's line of sight.

Burning with resentment, Evelyn was determined to stir up trouble for them all.

With Eleanor in surgery, Evelyn saw no need to hold back anymore.

Beatrice's face paled when she spotted the fallen documents. "Evelyn Carter! Must you be so careless with important papers? Pick that up immediately!"

What if Victoria saw its contents?

"Of course."

Evelyn took her sweet time retrieving the folder, making sure Victoria got a good look at the bolded title on the first page. She couldn't resist flashing a triumphant smirk at her rival.

Victoria's expression instantly darkened. "Mrs. Whitmore, what exactly is this document about?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Isn't it obvious? Can't you read? Grandmother Eleanor had us sign this right before her surgery."

"The baby I'm carrying will be the sole heir to Whitmore Enterprises. Any offspring from other women..." Evelyn paused dramatically, "...will be legally excluded."

As she delivered this blow, Evelyn watched with satisfaction as Victoria's face twisted in barely concealed rage. This gold-digger who'd been scheming to marry into the Whitmore family would surely explode when she realized what this meant.

Soon, Evelyn felt Nathaniel's piercing gaze burning into her.

She met his eyes calmly, tilting her chin in defiance.

With Eleanor under the knife, Evelyn had nothing left to lose.

Since Beatrice and Victoria had pushed her this far, Evelyn was determined to make them regret it.

Though she didn't actually care about the inheritance document, Evelyn refused to let these two vipers continue their arrogant schemes.

She would ruin their plans completely.



Nathaniel's eyes narrowed slightly, but he remained silent.

Beatrice rushed to explain, "Ms. Sinclair, please don't misunderstand. This document isn't legitimate!"

Evelyn deliberately flipped to the signature page, displaying Nathaniel's unmistakable handwriting. "Signed and sealed. How much more real can it get?"

Beatrice countered, "Evelyn, this only applies if you're actually pregnant. But we all know that belly of yours is just padding - a lie to convince Grandmother to have the surgery!"

Penelope nodded vigorously. "Exactly! Evelyn, you were never pregnant. This document means nothing to you."

"Are you seriously trying to trap Nathaniel into fathering your child?" Penelope sneered.

Beatrice jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "Stop your delusions, Evelyn. Nathaniel would never have a child with you. Signing that paper changes nothing. Give up this ridiculous fantasy."

Seeing Beatrice's accusatory finger, Evelyn abruptly swung the folder, smacking her hand away. "Mind your manners. Pointing is terribly rude."

"I wasn't going to sign it initially," Evelyn continued coolly, "but since you're so insistent, it would be disrespectful not to, wouldn't it?"

Beatrice recoiled, trembling with fury. "Nathaniel, are you hearing this? This is Evelyn's true colors. Don't let her fool you."

Victoria's eyes gleamed as she seized the moment to play victim. "Mrs. Whitmore, surely you didn't mean to strike Beatrice? She's your mother-in-law, for heaven's sake!"

Evelyn shrugged nonchalantly. "Sorry, but this is just who I am. I've got a temper and I don't play nice."

As she spoke, Evelyn casually glanced up at Nathaniel, radiating indifference.

All eyes turned to him, waiting for his reaction.

Nathaniel's voice cut through the tension like ice. "This document came from Grandmother. Her decisions aren't up for debate." His gaze swept over them all. "With her in surgery, I don't have time for this nonsense."
###Chapter 322



Nathaniel turned on his heel and strode toward the operating room without another word.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. The Nathaniel she knew would have immediately taken Victoria’s side, twisting the situation to make her the villain.

She had braced herself for a fight, but his silence was unnerving.

The shock wasn’t hers alone—Beatrice and Victoria stood frozen, equally stunned. Evelyn had been downright defiant moments ago, yet Nathaniel hadn’t so much as flinched.

Done wasting time, Evelyn brushed past them and headed for the operating room.

Beatrice hesitated before murmuring, "We should follow them."

Before they could take a step, a broad-shouldered bodyguard blocked their path.

"Apologies, Mrs. Whitmore," he said firmly. "Mr. Whitmore’s orders—no unauthorized personnel near the operating room."

Victoria’s nails dug into her palms, but she forced a pitiful whisper. "Mrs. Whitmore, what was that document Evelyn had earlier?"

Beatrice patted her arm reassuringly. "Relax, dear. Evelyn isn’t pregnant. That paper is worthless."

She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Once Eleanor’s surgery is over, the waiting period for Nathaniel and Evelyn’s divorce will have passed."

"They’ll be free of each other for good."

Victoria exhaled in relief. As long as Evelyn wasn’t carrying Nathaniel’s heir, that document meant nothing.

Beatrice guided her toward the elevators, murmuring comforts.

Meanwhile, Penelope lingered nearby, suspicion gnawing at her. Cassandra had texted her undeniable proof of Evelyn’s pregnancy earlier.

Yet now, Cassandra wasn’t answering her calls. It was as if she’d vanished.



Was Cassandra avoiding her out of guilt? Had she lied?

Still, Evelyn’s words echoed in Penelope’s mind. If Evelyn was secretly pregnant and had signed that document…

Wouldn’t that give her leverage over the Whitmore fortune?

Would Penelope’s own inheritance be at risk?

No—she needed confirmation.

Outside the operating room, Evelyn stared at the glowing red light, her muscles taut.

She trusted Julian’s skills implicitly, but surgery was unpredictable. Complications could arise.

Eleanor’s life hung in the balance.

Evelyn sank into a chair, whispering prayers under her breath.

Nathaniel joined her moments later, balancing a laptop on his knees, typing briskly.

Their arms brushed.

Evelyn shifted away abruptly.

Nathaniel’s fingers stilled. "Problem?" His voice was deceptively light. "Or is my proximity… inconvenient?"

Evelyn shot him a glare. "Unmarried men and women sitting this close invites gossip."

His jaw tightened. "Afraid of rumors? Or is there someone specific you don’t want seeing us together?"

The thought of Julian performing the surgery darkened his mood. Evelyn’s distance was clearly for his benefit.

Of all the men she could’ve chosen, why him?

The Montgomery family was a labyrinth of power and politics—more complex than even the Whitmores’.



If Evelyn married Julian, she’d face relentless scrutiny from the Montgomery elders.
###Chapter 323

Evelyn was thoroughly confused by Nathaniel's question. All she wanted was to keep a respectful distance between them.

What did he mean by asking who she was afraid of running into? It wasn't like she'd done anything wrong.

She shrugged casually. "Exactly, I just didn't want unnecessary gossip if someone saw us together."

Besides, both Beatrice and Victoria were at the hospital. Shouldn't Nathaniel be more concerned about potential misunderstandings with Victoria?

This thought prompted Evelyn to blurt out, "Speaking of which, why did you call off your engagement with Victoria?"

She'd been dying to ask this question for weeks, but the timing never seemed right.

With Eleanor's surgery underway and their divorce countdown beginning, Evelyn found herself unexpectedly curious.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "What do you think?"

Was she fishing for confirmation of what she already knew?

It was obvious Evelyn had convinced Julian to perform Eleanor's surgery, yet she'd kept silent about it.

She'd let Victoria manipulate the situation, using it to force Nathaniel into a sham engagement.

If Julian hadn't revealed the truth to Nathaniel that day, he would still be in the dark.

What game was Evelyn playing?

A sudden realization lit up Evelyn's face. "Did you break it off because you finally saw through Victoria's lies?"

What was she implying?

Nathaniel studied her carefully. "Evelyn, what exactly is going through that mind of yours?"

"Well, you're the one who's always claiming to know my thoughts," Evelyn retorted before she could stop herself.

She immediately clamped her mouth shut, regretting her words.

Nathaniel's expression turned unreadable. "Evelyn, now I understand why you have so many admirers. They must all be enchanted by that silver tongue of yours."

How had he never noticed how effortlessly flirtatious she could be?

Evelyn's cheeks burned, but she refused to let Nathaniel have the upper hand. Boldly, she countered, "Don't be ridiculous. Silver tongue? I've only ever sweet-talked one man, and that's you!"

Nathaniel coughed awkwardly. "Evelyn, what nonsense are you spouting?"

After all, he'd never permitted such behavior from her!

In their three years of marriage, their relationship had remained strictly platonic - except for that one unexpected night.

Evelyn suddenly realized the implication of her words and turned scarlet.

She backpedaled furiously. "I was just rambling. You're the one reading too much into it with your dirty imagination."

Nathaniel scowled. "Dirty imagination? You're the one with the inappropriate thoughts!"

"If you think I have inappropriate thoughts, then point them out. I'd be happy to explain," Evelyn challenged, refusing to back down.

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to Evelyn's wide, innocent eyes.

His throat tightened imperceptibly as he unconsciously licked his lips.

In a husky voice, he murmured, "You were the one who brought up sweet-talking."

"So what if I did? Didn't I sweet-talk you back then?"

It was true - Evelyn had spent every day learning Nathaniel's preferences, anxiously awaiting his return from work, carefully choosing her words to please him.

She'd had to measure every syllable, ensuring it was exactly what he wanted to hear. Wasn't that the very definition of sweet-talking?

Robert, standing nearby, accidentally overheard their heated exchange and discreetly took several steps back.

He had no desire to witness anything private and risk Nathaniel's legendary temper later.
###Chapter 324

Beneath Nathaniel's polished aristocratic exterior lurked an unexpectedly cunning mind.

His icy gaze locked onto Evelyn as he commanded, "Evelyn, that's enough."

Most women would have flushed with embarrassment at such dismissal, but not Evelyn.

She met his challenge head-on, her cheeks flushing with indignation.

Never had Nathaniel encountered a woman with such unshakable confidence and sharp tongue!

"You started this," Evelyn countered, crossing her arms. "A clear conscience reflects purity in all things. Your twisted perspective taints everything you see!"

Nathaniel blinked, momentarily stunned into silence.

The argument died abruptly.

As Nathaniel fell quiet, Evelyn lowered her gaze, struggling to compose herself.

This entire confrontation was his fault - his careless words had provoked her unexpected outburst.

An uncomfortable tension settled between them.

Evelyn studied the ceiling, desperate to break the silence. "You still haven't answered my question," she pressed.

Why was she so determined to get an answer?

Nathaniel's fingers hovered over his keyboard, his attention clearly divided.

When Evelyn repeated her question, his throat constricted. "Shouldn't the reason be obvious?"

"Obvious? How would I know?"

Evelyn's confusion deepened. She searched Nathaniel's face for clues, but his expression remained unreadable.

"You seem unusually invested in why I broke off my engagement with Victoria," Nathaniel observed instead.

Evelyn's eyes flashed with irritation before she looked away. "Just making conversation."

"Why the sudden interest?"

She exhaled sharply. "I want ammunition to tease Victoria. This is too perfect an opportunity to pass up."

Nathaniel's eyebrows shot up.

Apparently, he'd completely misread her intentions.

Flushing slightly, Nathaniel turned his attention to the nearby document. "You shouldn't keep this. It's sensitive information that could affect Whitmore Industries' stock prices. The succession issue is delicate."

"I knew you'd say that," Evelyn replied smoothly. "But this document is meaningless. We don't actually have a child together."

Her voice remained steady as she continued, "Besides, our priority has always been ensuring Grandmother Eleanor's surgery goes well."

"Whatever decisions we make during this period... I won't hold them against you later."

Nathaniel nodded slowly, considering her words. "You've changed quite a bit recently."

Seeing Evelyn's true character had forced Nathaniel to reconsider all his initial assumptions about her.

With a careless shrug, Evelyn replied, "I'll be resigning soon anyway, so it hardly matters who you choose to love."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. "Must you always treat everything so lightly?"

"I could take it seriously," she countered, "but pleasantries cost extra."

A smirk tugged at Nathaniel's lips. "Name your price."

"One hundred dollars per word," Evelyn said airily, already turning away.

To her astonishment, Nathaniel reached for his phone. "Bank transfer or Venmo?"

Evelyn gaped at him. This had been meant as a joke - was he actually serious?

While Evelyn was loosening up, Nathaniel seemed to be developing a surprising playful streak.

As Nathaniel opened his banking app, Evelyn couldn't help exclaiming, "Are you really that desperate for my sweet talk?"
###Chapter 325



Realizing her blunder, Evelyn instantly regretted her careless remark.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened as he gave her a pointed look. "Well, it's not entirely impossible," he said, his voice low and measured.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed crimson. She turned her face away, murmuring, "Once Grandma Eleanor fully recovers from her surgery... maybe then we can finalize the divorce."

The moment the words left her lips, the air between them grew thick with tension.

The fleeting warmth that had briefly enveloped them vanished without a trace.

Nathaniel straightened in his chair, his posture rigid. An inexplicable weight pressed against his chest, making each breath feel laborious.

His eyes flickered back to Evelyn. After a pause, he spoke again, his tone deliberate. "You know... a divorce might not be absolutely necessary."

Evelyn froze.

She stared at him, certain she had misheard.

Though she understood every word individually, strung together, they made no sense.

What did he mean by not necessary? Was he implying they could stay married?

Nathaniel shifted uncomfortably under her scrutiny.

"What I mean is," he clarified, his voice rough, "I don’t have any particular expectations for a wife."

His jaw tightened. "Given how much Grandmother adores you, your presence benefits her health. So... I’m considering letting you remain Mrs. Whitmore."

Evelyn’s mind blanked.

The silence stretched between them, heavy and charged.

Slowly, she leaned forward, closing the distance between them.

Nathaniel’s breath hitched as her face neared his.

Her scent—subtle yet intoxicating—filled his senses.

His pulse quickened.

Was she... affected by his words?

Then, without warning, Evelyn pressed her palm against his forehead.

Their skin touched, warm and intimate.

Nathaniel stiffened, his pupils dilating.

But just as quickly, she pulled back.

"Strange," she mused, frowning. "No fever. So why are you talking nonsense like a delirious patient?"

She had married Nathaniel—a man who once seemed like little more than a living statue—partly out of respect for Eleanor, but also because she had genuinely cared for him.

Without that affection, how could she have endured three years as his dutiful wife?

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Besides, just because you have no standards doesn’t mean I don’t."

Nathaniel recoiled as if struck.

Her voice chased after him. "Nathaniel, say something! If you’re sick, go see a doctor!"

He swallowed hard, rising abruptly from his seat.

He strode away, his usually graceful steps now stiff and uneven.

Evelyn watched him leave, calling after him, "Seriously, get yourself checked!"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened further before he disappeared down the hall.

Alone again, Evelyn exhaled sharply and slumped into her chair.

As her heartbeat steadied, Nathaniel’s unexpected proposal replayed in her mind.

Stay married?

Her fingers curled into fists.

After three years of indifference, why would he suggest such a thing now?

If not for Eleanor’s unwavering support, the Whitmore family would have discarded her long ago.
###Chapter 326

With Eleanor finally cleared for surgery, Evelyn expected Nathaniel to feel relieved about their impending divorce.

Yet to her astonishment, he voiced his wish to remain married, insisting they didn't need to separate.

This unexpected development left Evelyn utterly perplexed.

While Nathaniel appeared willing to give their marriage another chance, Evelyn had moved beyond accepting vague promises.

She refused to wait endlessly for changes that might never come.

Besides, with twins growing inside her, the thought of raising them within the Whitmore family seemed increasingly impossible.

After completing her final exams and earning enough credits, Evelyn planned to join her brothers in Nord City - to deliver her babies and start fresh.

This exit strategy had been part of her preparations for months.

Perhaps Nathaniel had finally seen through Victoria's manipulations and realized Evelyn, despite her perceived simplicity, made the most suitable wife.

That might explain his sudden reluctance to divorce.

Yet Evelyn remained doubtful.

As she mused, a cloying floral scent assaulted her nostrils, unmistakably signaling Penelope's approach.

Evelyn looked up just as Penelope stopped before her, wrinkling her nose in distaste.

"You might want to stand back. That perfume could contaminate the operating theater and distract the surgeons," Evelyn warned.

Penelope scoffed. "Don't play innocent, Evelyn. I know your little secret."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Fine, you've uncovered my secret. Since you know everything, could you please move away from the operating area?"

"Can't you smell that? Your perfume's strong enough to cure smoked ham. Or has your nose stopped working?" Evelyn added pointedly.

Furious, Penelope snatched up a nearby legal document. "So this was your plan all along? Keeping it hidden from everyone."

Evelyn glanced at the papers. "I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Stop pretending!" Penelope spat. "I'll admit your diversion tactics worked brilliantly. You've fooled everyone - even Nathaniel supported this without question."

Her lips curled in contempt. "But your schemes won't work on me, Evelyn. Now that I know, your plan will fail. I won't let you stay in the Whitmore family!"

Evelyn sighed. "Then enlighten me. What exactly have I done? What schemes? Unless you explain, how would I know?"

Penelope leaned in, eyes gleaming. "You're pregnant, aren't you?"

Evelyn's pulse spiked, her pupils contracting as she stared at Penelope.

Had Cassandra betrayed her pregnancy to Penelope?

But that made no sense. Julian had assured Evelyn the matter with Cassandra was resolved.

She trusted Julian implicitly - he wouldn't lie to her.

Quickly regaining composure, Evelyn replied calmly, "Yes, I'm pregnant. Why else would Grandma Eleanor designate my unborn child as Whitmore Group's heir?"

Penelope smirked triumphantly. "Everyone thinks you faked pregnancy to comfort Grandma before surgery. But I'm the only one who knows the truth."

"So was this all part of your scheme? Did you manipulate Grandma into signing those heir documents too?" Penelope's voice grew more animated, convinced of her theory.

She reveled in this moment, certain she'd finally caught Evelyn in an untenable position.

Evelyn cursed inwardly. Though Penelope often acted foolishly, she occasionally displayed surprising perceptiveness.

Now what?

What if Penelope truly possessed evidence from Cassandra?
###Chapter 327

This was a delicate situation Evelyn had to handle with care.

Penelope's unwavering certainty about her accusations left Evelyn bewildered. How could she be so bold?

"Ha! Cat got your tongue, Evelyn? Your silence speaks volumes—I’ve nailed it, haven’t I?"

Seeing Evelyn’s lack of reaction, Penelope grew giddy with excitement. She was convinced she’d uncovered a secret no one else knew.

Evelyn remained composed. "You’re absolutely right. I am pregnant, and I’ve deliberately kept it hidden while arranging the heir agreement behind the scenes."

Penelope’s eyes gleamed with triumph. "Finally admitting it, huh? I’ll make sure everyone knows the truth. You won’t get away with this!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Penelope, you’re painfully naive."

Her dismissive tone stung, making Penelope bristle. "Excuse me? You’re the one who’s naive!"

"Really? Did you even read the document? Nathaniel’s signature is already on it. All it needs is mine, and it becomes legally binding."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a sly smile. "Once it’s finalized, my child will be the heir to the Whitmore empire. And guess who’ll have a say in the family’s financial decisions?"

She leaned in slightly, voice dripping with amusement. "That includes your credit limit, by the way."

Penelope paled. "Don’t get ahead of yourself. Once I expose you, Nathaniel will never let this happen. Your little scheme will collapse."

Evelyn scoffed. "With Eleanor backing me and a Whitmore heir in my belly, who can touch me?" She tilted her head. "Still think I’m the naive one?"

Penelope’s throat tightened. Her credit had been restricted for weeks, forcing her to rely on Victoria’s measly supplementary card. The humiliation was unbearable.

If Evelyn secured her position as the Whitmore heiress, Penelope’s future would be ruined.

Panicked, she stumbled back and fled.



Evelyn watched her retreat with quiet satisfaction. Penelope couldn’t handle pressure to save her life.

Still, one question nagged at her—how had Penelope been so certain about the pregnancy? If word got out, it could spell trouble.

Resting a hand on her stomach, Evelyn knew she had to act first.

Meanwhile, Eleanor’s surgery had stretched past two hours. Needing a moment, Evelyn rose and headed for the restroom.

Fate had a way of complicating things.

She nearly collided with Nathaniel in the hallway.

Their eyes met, tension crackling between them.

Evelyn cleared her throat. "Excuse me. Restroom."

Nathaniel stepped aside wordlessly, and she slipped past him.

Inside, her thoughts spiraled—Penelope’s threats, Nathaniel’s sudden reluctance to finalize the divorce.

The Whitmores were nothing but trouble.

With a sigh, she stepped back into the hall.

Nathaniel sat by the window, laptop abandoned, gaze distant.

Hesitating, Evelyn approached.

Outside, two birds perched on a branch, preening each other’s feathers, beaks brushing affectionately.

Since when did birds flaunt their relationships?

Silence settled between them again—until Evelyn’s stomach growled loudly.

Heat rushed to her cheeks as she pressed a hand to her abdomen. It wasn’t even lunchtime. Why now?
###Chapter 328

The morning hadn't been kind to Evelyn Carter. Not only had she barely eaten, but Victoria Sinclair had nearly collided with her in the hallway, sending her breakfast tumbling to the floor.

Nathaniel Whitmore observed Evelyn's predicament with narrowed eyes before turning to Robert Chambers. "Have lunch delivered," he commanded.

Evelyn quickly raised a hand. "Wait."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Problem? Am I not allowed to buy you a meal?"

She cleared her throat delicately. "That's not it. I just prefer lighter options—maybe some soup and fresh fruit."

Silence stretched between them.

Straightening his tie, Nathaniel remarked, "You certainly have a way of making requests, Evelyn. Did I say I was treating you?"

Without missing a beat, Evelyn countered, "With guests visiting Eleanor Whitmore, isn't it your duty as her grandson to provide hospitality? Or has the Whitmore family forgotten its manners?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

Was she seriously pinning this on him?

Soon, Robert returned with an elegant spread—delicate soups, crisp salads, and a trolley of assorted fruits.

Evelyn wasted no time picking up her fork.

The twins in her belly had been protesting all morning, leaving her no choice but to eat.

Nathaniel, who had little appetite, found himself eating more just watching her enjoy the food.

His gaze lingered on her face. "Evelyn, have you put on weight?"

She choked mid-bite.

"Ridiculous," she scoffed, dabbing her lips with a napkin. "Where exactly?"

Nathaniel smirked. "That second chin is new."

Self-consciously, Evelyn touched her jawline—it did feel softer. "It's called baby fat," she shot back. "Not that you're funding my meals anyway."

Nathaniel leaned back, unfazed. "You ate at the Whitmore estate for three years."

"Yes, and I didn't gain an ounce then. Funny how it happened right after I left—what does that say about your household?"

His eyes glinted. "Are you accusing me of mistreating you?"

"Whether you did or not," Evelyn said sweetly, "you know the answer."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "For three years, your living expenses were more than covered. I never shortchanged you."

Evelyn's laugh was icy. "Oh, the money was always there. But your mother made sure I knew spending it would burden you. 'Nathaniel works so hard,' she'd say. 'Don't be wasteful.'"

"And yet," Nathaniel mused, "you never struck me as someone who'd obey blindly."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her fork.

"I was naive," she admitted. "If I had today's mindset back then? I'd have lived lavishly—spa days, designer boutiques, luxury vacations. I certainly wouldn't have been some meek little wife."

It had taken her too long to realize: compromising endlessly won no one's love—only her own resentment.

Nathaniel studied her, his gaze unreadable.

"That's how it should be," he said at last. "As Mrs. Whitmore, you should command respect. Who would dare slight you? If trouble comes, I'll handle it. What are you afraid of?"
###Chapter 329

Evelyn's lips parted in shock at Nathaniel's declaration.

Why was he saying such absurd things again?

What did he mean by supporting her even if the world ended? Why would he express such sentiments to her now?

She blinked rapidly. "Mr. Whitmore, had I known you felt this way earlier, I wouldn't have suffered through three miserable years!"

"It's never too late to know the truth." Nathaniel's gaze burned with intensity, his meaning crystal clear.

As Evelyn studied his striking features - those sharp cheekbones and mesmerizing eyes - her pulse quickened uncontrollably. Every detail of his face seemed crafted to her exact preferences.

"You don't need to answer immediately," Nathaniel said calmly. "Take all the time you need."

Evelyn quickly composed herself, clearing her throat. "Mr. Whitmore, your feelings now don't change anything. It's too late."

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. His jaw tightened. "Must you always speak like this?"

Despite his clear intentions and promises, Evelyn remained stubbornly resistant.

A storm of emotions swirled in Evelyn's eyes. "Three years ago, those words would have made me so happy I couldn't sleep!"

Nathaniel looked surprised. "And now?"

"Now they make me so angry I can't sleep."

Nathaniel recoiled slightly.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "Mr. Whitmore, my feelings have faded. There's no reason to continue this marriage."

"After Eleanor's surgery, she'll recover completely. There's no need—"

Her words struck Nathaniel's heart like a sudden drumbeat disrupting his rhythm. He stared intensely at Evelyn, searching her eyes for any trace of their former adoration - and found none.

The emptiness in his chest surprised him. Once, he would have celebrated her indifference. Now, it left him hollow.

The operating room doors swung open abruptly.

Dr. Laurent emerged, face grim, holding documents. "The patient's condition is more complex than anticipated. We need emergency authorization."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. She instinctively turned to Nathaniel, whose face had gone deathly pale.

Evelyn snatched the forms and thrust them at him. "Sign quickly. We must trust the doctors."

There was no turning back now.

Nathaniel's hand trembled as he signed. The pen nearly slipped from his fingers. Evelyn placed a steadying hand on his arm. "Eleanor will be fine. She promised us."

Nathaniel remained frozen, staring at the operating room doors. Evelyn stood silently beside him as hours stretched into evening.

When Dr. Laurent finally reappeared, Evelyn's heart leaped to her throat. "How is she?"

"The surgery succeeded, but she's being transferred to ICU. No visitors during critical recovery."

Relief flooded Evelyn's veins. Without thinking, she threw her arms around Nathaniel. "Did you hear? Eleanor's going to be fine!"

Her spontaneous embrace caught them both by surprise. For the first time in years, they stood connected - not by obligation, but by shared relief.
###Chapter 330

Nathaniel's lips curved into a subtle smile. "That's wonderful news!"

Evelyn looked up at Nathaniel standing before her. His striking features, illuminated by the soft hospital lighting, looked like something out of a Renaissance painting.

For a brief moment, she was completely mesmerized.

Just then, Julian emerged from the operating room, exhaustion evident in his expression.

Seeing Evelyn embrace Nathaniel, Julian frowned. "What's going on here? Let go."

Hearing Julian's voice, Evelyn suddenly snapped back to reality. Overwhelmed by relief, she had instinctively hugged Nathaniel without thinking.

Blushing, she quickly released him and turned to Julian, her eyes shining. "I heard the surgery was a success!"

Julian had promised Evelyn that Eleanor's operation would go smoothly, and true to his word, he had delivered.

With a gentle smile, he ruffled Evelyn's hair. "Of course. I never break my promises to you."

Julian took his commitments to Evelyn seriously. This time, she gave him a genuine smile of gratitude.

Watching their affectionate exchange, Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. A sharp pang of jealousy twisted inside him.

It felt like someone was stealing what was rightfully his.

Julian, recognizing the look in Nathaniel's eyes, understood exactly what it meant.

But Nathaniel's chances were slim now. Julian and his brothers were determined to bring Evelyn back to Nord City permanently. By then, Nathaniel would be irrelevant.

After all, Nord City had no shortage of eligible bachelors.

Turning to Nathaniel, Julian said, "While Mrs. Whitmore's surgery went well, the next week in the ICU is critical."

"If she pulls through this period, she should be on the road to recovery."

Nathaniel's throat tightened. Emotions warred within him, leaving him momentarily speechless.

It felt as though Eleanor's survival had come at the cost of losing Evelyn, and the unfairness of it gnawed at him.

Evelyn spoke up. "I believe Grandma Eleanor will make it through this week."

Julian's gaze softened as he looked at her. "I think so too. It's getting late—we should head home."

Evelyn nodded. "Alright."

As soon as she said it, she felt the air around her grow noticeably colder.

Behind her, Nathaniel spoke in a low voice. "I'll go check on Grandma's condition."

Unable to bear the tension any longer, he turned and walked away, frustration simmering beneath the surface. If he stayed, he might lose control and do something he'd regret.

Watching Nathaniel leave, Evelyn felt a wave of relief. Eleanor was safe—that was what mattered most.

She turned back to Julian. "Julian, has the lead surgeon left? I didn’t see him come out."

Julian tensed slightly. "Ah, yes. He was exhausted."

"He left through a private exit. The surgery was long, and he performed it alone."

"That makes sense."

Julian hesitated. "Why do you want to meet him?"

"I just wanted to thank him in person. Regardless of his connection to Victoria, he’s the reason Grandma Eleanor made it through."

Whatever issues existed between her and Victoria were a separate matter.

Julian exhaled in relief. "I’ll make sure to pass along your gratitude."

"Thank you."

Evelyn didn’t press further. Given the awkward history with Victoria, she was content letting Julian handle it.

Julian studied her. "Let’s go home. You shouldn’t push yourself—you need rest."
###Chapter 331

Evelyn froze when she spotted Victoria across the hospital corridor.

Why was Victoria still here? Eleanor's surgery had concluded hours ago.

A nagging suspicion crept into Evelyn's mind. Was Victoria's hospital visit genuine concern, or just another calculated performance?

The air between them grew thick with tension.

Julian's pulse quickened at the sight of Victoria. What was she doing here?

If Victoria approached them now, it would undoubtedly trigger a catastrophic scene!

Julian's mind raced for damage control options.

Seeing Evelyn standing so close to Julian, Victoria's jealousy flared like wildfire. How dare that orphan girl cling to Julian!

Bitter regret washed over Victoria. She never should have allowed Evelyn to attend her engagement party.

Without that invitation, Evelyn wouldn't have gotten so many opportunities to worm her way into Julian's life.

Someone of Evelyn's lowly status would never normally cross paths with a Montgomery heir.

Victoria's face darkened with determination. Today, she would expose Evelyn's true colors.

She would make sure Evelyn understood the unbridgeable chasm between their social standings!

As Victoria marched forward in her designer heels, Evelyn's eyes flashed with alarm. She knew any confrontation would force Julian to defend her.

Julian had only recently established his reputation at this hospital. Offending Victoria meant crossing her powerful brother, the renowned surgeon Alexander Montgomery.

Such a scandal could ruin Julian's promising career.

Scenarios played out rapidly in Evelyn's mind. Though she was learning to stand her ground, she couldn't let personal drama jeopardize Julian's future.

In a split-second decision, Evelyn acted.

As Victoria reached them, Evelyn suddenly pulled her into an embrace. "What brings you here? Grandma Eleanor's been moved to ICU."

"The surgery went well. Come, I'll take you to see her." Maintaining the hug, Evelyn steered Victoria toward the elevators.

Victoria stiffened in shock, completely thrown by Evelyn's unexpected move.

The elevator doors slid open. Still holding Victoria, Evelyn guided them both inside.

Only when the doors closed did Evelyn exhale in relief - Julian couldn't follow them now.

Glancing at Victoria still trapped in her arms, Evelyn blinked rapidly.

Their eyes met briefly before both women quickly separated. Evelyn cleared her throat, remaining silent.

Victoria adjusted her dress with sharp, irritated movements. "Evelyn, what was that about? Why did you hug me?"

"I saw the elevator coming and didn't want to miss it," Evelyn replied smoothly, keeping her true motives hidden.

Victoria scoffed derisively. "You're clearly guilty about something. Don't think I don't see through your little act!"

"I was simply helping you visit Eleanor. Don't read too much into it," Evelyn countered.

As the doors opened, Evelyn stepped out quickly.

Victoria's venomous words followed her: "You're afraid of what I'll say to him, aren't you? That's why you dragged me away!"
###Chapter 332

Evelyn's spine stiffened instantly. Since when had Victoria, that airheaded socialite, become so perceptive?

She couldn't comprehend how Victoria had uncovered her hidden agenda.

As Evelyn turned, Victoria's smug smirk greeted her. "What exactly are you plotting?"

It almost slipped Evelyn's mind—Victoria's brother was a renowned surgeon too. Perhaps she had connections to Julian as well.

During the redevelopment of Evelyn's childhood neighborhood, Victoria had been pulling strings in the shadows.

If Victoria discovered Evelyn's relationship with Julian, what chaos would ensue?

With a victorious glint in her eyes, Victoria taunted, "Evelyn, darling, perhaps it's time to abandon this little fantasy of yours. You're utterly unworthy of Julian. Stop deluding yourself."

Evelyn's brows arched slightly at Victoria's words. There was an eerie familiarity to her tone.

Nathaniel had once voiced similar sentiments—that Evelyn and Julian were mismatched.

Of course they were incompatible—they were siblings! The mere thought of them as a couple was ludicrous.

Clearly, both Victoria and Nathaniel had misinterpreted Evelyn's relationship with Julian, assuming it was romantic.

If that were truly the case, resolving this misunderstanding would be far simpler.

A sly smile curled Evelyn's lips. "Victoria, isn't meddling beneath someone of your stature?"

"Fine then. I'll clarify matters directly with Julian. Then you'll see if I'm truly interfering," Victoria retorted, stepping toward the elevator.

Recognizing the impending disaster, Evelyn seized Victoria's arm and slammed her against the wall, determined to prevent her from reaching Julian.

"Release me this instant!" Victoria demanded, frustration lacing her voice.

"Not a chance!" Evelyn pinned Victoria's shoulders firmly against the wall, rendering her immobile.

Their proximity was uncomfortably intimate.



Evelyn suddenly realized she stood half a head taller than Victoria, whose petite frame was no match for her strength.

A cold voice sliced through the tension. "What's the meaning of this?"

Evelyn glanced over to see Nathaniel and Beatrice approaching, their expressions unreadable.

Nathaniel's face darkened. "Are you planning to release her?"

From a distance, the scene appeared compromising—Evelyn pressing Victoria against the wall in what could be mistaken for an intimate embrace.

Had Evelyn's targets now expanded to include women?

Beatrice rushed forward. "Evelyn, what are you doing to Ms. Sinclair?"

Spotting Beatrice, Victoria instantly adopted a wounded expression. "Mrs. Whitmore, I've no idea what Ms. Carter wants with me. She assaulted me without provocation! Look—she's bruised my wrist!"

Evelyn immediately released her, flashing an innocent smile. "Just playing a harmless prank on Ms. Sinclair, nothing more."

Beatrice frowned. "Is this appropriate behavior toward Ms. Sinclair? Nathaniel, you witnessed this!"

Evelyn studied Nathaniel's stormy expression, unease coiling in her stomach. Why was he so protective of Victoria?

It wasn't as if Evelyn had caused any real harm.

Victoria turned pleading eyes toward Nathaniel. "I can't believe Evelyn just harassed me like this. Thank heavens you arrived when you did—who knows what might have happened?"

She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "After all, I only have eyes for men. My preferences are... traditional."

Evelyn gaped at Victoria in disbelief. "When exactly did your moral compass shatter?"

Since when had Evelyn ever behaved inappropriately?
###Chapter 333

Evelyn never anticipated that Victoria would one day accuse her of harassment. The sheer audacity took her breath away.

"Did I say something wrong?" Victoria challenged with a smirk. "Who was the one who pulled me into that embrace downstairs? Who shoved me into the elevator? And who," she added with dramatic emphasis, "pinned me against the wall and refused to let go?"

Evelyn felt her dignity crumbling like dry sand between her fingers.

Before she could formulate a response, Nathaniel's strong fingers closed around her wrist. His jaw was set in that familiar stubborn line. "Evelyn. Come with me."

"Let go of me, Nathaniel!" Evelyn twisted to glare at Victoria, whose triumphant expression made her blood boil. She'd fallen into another one of their traps!

What game was Nathaniel playing now?

He maneuvered her into a secluded corner, his grip unrelenting. When she opened her mouth to protest, he caught her chin with his free hand. "Evelyn," he murmured, his voice dangerously low, "you're becoming bolder than I realized. How did I miss this side of you?"

Evelyn met his stormy gaze without flinching. "I've told you before - don't judge me by your limited understanding." She injected just enough sarcasm to make her point. "Though I doubt someone like you could comprehend."

Nathaniel's lips thinned. "Grandmother would be devastated to learn about your... preferences for women."

The absurdity of his accusation struck Evelyn like a physical blow. She was undeniably straight!

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Fine, since we're being honest - yes, I'm bisexual." She leaned closer, enjoying how his pupils dilated. "I've come to realize men rarely live up to their reputations."

"Women," she continued with deliberate provocation, "are compassionate. Understanding. We connect on levels you arrogant males could never fathom."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. He recognized the jab at his own behavior immediately.

Just as he drew breath to respond, Evelyn's phone vibrated. Julian's name flashed across the screen.

She shook off Nathaniel's grip. "If you'll excuse me."

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to her phone. His frown deepened when he saw the caller ID.

"If you can't accept me as I am," Evelyn tossed over her shoulder, "I'll find someone who will."

She pivoted sharply and took the emergency stairs two at a time, deliberately avoiding the elevator where Victoria and Beatrice might still be lurking.

Watching her retreat, Nathaniel's irritation spiked.

Her closeness with Julian already grated on him. Now this apparent interest in Victoria? It was too much.

Was Evelyn determined to bewitch every Montgomery in the city?

"Nat?" Victoria's saccharine voice interrupted his thoughts.

He turned to find her alone, her delicate features arranged in perfect distress. Evelyn's absence seemed to confirm Victoria's unspoken accusation of guilt.

Nathaniel studied Victoria's petite frame - so different from Evelyn's confident bearing. The comparison made Victoria's calculated vulnerability suddenly repulsive.

"Stay away from Evelyn," he commanded, his voice like ice. "Don't go near her again."

Victoria's eyes widened. "Nat, I knew you still—"

He didn't wait for her to finish. His abrupt departure left her standing alone, though her smug smile suggested she'd misinterpreted his warning as protection.

Beatrice materialized at her side. "What did he say?"

Victoria's lips curved. "He told me to avoid Evelyn. Clearly he still cares about me."

The satisfaction in her voice echoed down the hallway as Nathaniel strode away, his thoughts consumed by the infuriating woman who'd just turned his world upside down.
###Chapter 334

Beatrice's lips curled into a knowing smirk. "Ms. Sinclair, as I told you before, Mrs. Whitmore's surgery was completed without complications."

She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Nathaniel's devotion to his grandmother is the only reason he tolerated Evelyn's presence all this time. Now that Eleanor's procedure is done, that gold-digger will be out on the street before she knows what hit her."

Victoria's face lit up with malicious glee as a thought struck her. "But what about the inheritance agreement?"

"Don't trouble yourself over that," Beatrice waved a dismissive hand. "Evelyn isn't pregnant. That document might as well be toilet paper."

After a moment's consideration, Victoria visibly relaxed, her shoulders losing their tension.

Meanwhile, Evelyn descended the hospital stairs to meet Julian, who waited by the exit. They walked to the parking lot in companionable silence.

Settling into the passenger seat, Evelyn clenched her fists in her lap. Victoria's vile accusations echoed in her mind, each word like a dagger twisting in her gut. Being called a stalker? The sheer audacity made her blood boil.

She'd always known Victoria lacked morals, but this new low still managed to shock her.

Julian navigated the evening traffic with careful precision, stealing frequent glances at his sister's stormy expression. His pulse quickened with worry - had Victoria somehow revealed their secret during their confrontation?

After several tense minutes, he cleared his throat. "Evelyn... what exactly did you and Victoria talk about back there?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched, her gaze fixed on the passing streetlights. "Nothing important," she lied smoothly. "Just escorted her to see Eleanor outside ICU. Small talk, really."

There was no way she'd tell Julian about Victoria's harassment claims. Some humiliations were best kept private.

Julian exhaled slowly, relief washing over him. Whatever they'd discussed, it clearly hadn't involved their true relationship. His grip on the steering wheel loosened slightly.

"Julian," Evelyn's sudden question made him tense again, "how well do you know Victoria?"

His throat went dry. "We've crossed paths a few times at the hospital," he answered carefully. "Professional acquaintances, nothing more."

Evelyn nodded absently. It made sense - with Victoria's brother being a renowned surgeon, their paths would naturally intersect at the medical center.

"Why do you ask?" Julian's voice held a nervous edge.

Evelyn gave a humorless laugh. "Oh, just amusing myself with their ridiculous theories. Both Victoria and Nathaniel seem convinced there's something romantic between us."

Julian's palms grew clammy. "And... what did you tell them?"

If Evelyn had revealed their sibling bond, Victoria would have been crowing about it by now.

"I didn't bother correcting them." Evelyn's lips twisted in a bitter smile. "Let them believe what they want. Their opinions stopped mattering to me a long time ago."

Her tone carried such finality that Julian's chest ached. She was protecting him - protecting all of them - by maintaining their secret.

"Evelyn," he ventured cautiously, "why not just tell them the truth? That I'm your brother?"

The hurt in his voice made Evelyn turn to study his profile. She hadn't realized how much her silence weighed on him.

"There's no point," she said softly. "In a few months, I'll be leaving Bern City for Nord City anyway. Best to keep things simple."

Julian's knuckles whitened on the wheel. "Are you trying to protect yourself... or us?"

The realization hit him like a physical blow. All this time, they'd prided themselves on keeping their relationship hidden, when in truth, it was Evelyn who'd been shielding them.

His vision blurred unexpectedly. She'd shouldered this burden alone, never once complaining.

Evelyn reached over to squeeze his arm. "Honestly? I just prefer not to share my personal life with people who don't matter."

Julian swallowed hard, his throat tight with emotion. As they stopped at a red light, he turned to face her fully.

"Evelyn," he began, voice thick, "there's something you need to know."
###Chapter 335

Evelyn discreetly glanced at Julian in the driver's seat. She couldn't shake the feeling that his gaze held a trace of discomfort.

Julian's eyes revealed a tangled mess of guilt and tenderness, his emotions laid bare.

Intrigued, Evelyn wondered what secret Julian was about to reveal.

Lost in thought, she suddenly blurted out, "Julian, you never had a thing with Victoria before, did you?"

The car jerked to an abrupt stop.

"Of course not!" Julian answered, his voice laced with shock.

Before he could elaborate, the sound of metal crunching against metal echoed from behind them, cutting their conversation short.

Evelyn's face drained of color. "Julian, did we just get rear-ended?"

"Yeah, but it's minor. Evelyn, could you wait on the sidewalk while I deal with this?" Julian instructed.

Heart pounding, Evelyn stepped out and spotted a sleek sports car behind them.

Then, a woman emerged from the driver's side—elegant, poised, and radiating an effortless sophistication that immediately caught Evelyn's attention.

Something about her felt strangely familiar.

Relieved that the other driver wasn't some aggressive man, Evelyn exhaled slightly.

She stood by the roadside, watching as Julian and the woman exchanged words. Their striking looks made them seem like they belonged in a high-fashion ad.

As Evelyn studied the woman’s graceful demeanor, realization struck.

A quick search on her phone confirmed it—this was Genevieve Winslow, a singer whose music Evelyn adored.

Not quite a household name, which explained why Evelyn hadn’t recognized her right away.

Excitement bubbled up. Should she ask for an autograph?

Moments later, Julian and Genevieve exchanged contact details before she drove off in her sports car.

Julian pulled over and reassured Evelyn. "It was just a fender bender. Insurance will handle it. You can get back in."

As Evelyn settled into her seat, she couldn’t contain herself. "Julian, did you just get her number?"

"Yeah, WhatsApp. Easier for follow-up. Though honestly, it was my fault for stopping suddenly."

Evelyn hesitated, then asked, "Did you think she was pretty?"

Julian arched a brow, considering his answer before turning to her. "She's alright. But you? You're breathtaking."

No one could compare to Evelyn—her kindness, her wit, her beauty.

Julian adored her, and it showed.

Evelyn bit her lip. "I wanted to ask for her autograph, but I chickened out."

"Autograph? She’s famous?"

"Sort of. A singer who keeps a low profile. But she’s even more stunning in person. I’m a huge fan."

Julian hadn’t pegged her as a celebrity. Interesting.

Watching Evelyn’s admiration for Genevieve made him oddly uneasy. Was she… starstruck?

Once home, Julian parked and cleared his throat. "Evelyn, there’s something I need to tell you."

"What is it?"

"Don’t mention to Alexander that I drove you home and we got rear-ended. You know how explosive his temper can be."

Evelyn blinked. "Is he really that bad? He’s always been gentle with me."

Julian sighed, ruffling her hair playfully. "Alexander only softens for you. Sebastian and I got chewed out plenty growing up."

Evelyn smirked. "Probably because you two were troublemakers."
###Chapter 336

Evelyn stepped out of the car, flashing Julian a reassuring smile. "Don't worry, I won't say a word to Alexander."

The moment they entered the house, the rich aroma of Margaret's cooking enveloped them.

In the living room, Evelyn froze at the sight of a strikingly handsome man lounging on the couch. "Christopher?"

Christopher rose gracefully, his lips curving into a warm smile as he ruffled Evelyn's hair. "Evelyn, you're home early. Rough day at university?"

Evelyn hesitated. "No, Eleanor had surgery today. I stayed at the hospital until it was over."

Christopher's gaze flicked to Julian, disapproval flashing in his eyes. Having known Evelyn once worked as a caregiver for the Whitmores, he'd always opposed Julian assisting with their medical matters.

But since it was Evelyn's personal request, he held his tongue. Her kindness was impossible to refuse.

"Hungry?" Christopher asked, his voice smooth as silk. "Let's eat."

Margaret emerged from the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron. "Perfect timing! Since everyone's here, let's wash up and dig in."

She turned to Evelyn. "Since Christopher's visiting and it's the weekend, why don't you show him around Bern City?"

Evelyn nodded. "Of course. Christopher, are you here for business or pleasure?"

Her brothers usually only visited during vacations or work trips, their schedules packed.

"Business," Christopher replied casually, "but I thought I'd take a break too."

Truthfully, his main purpose was seeing Evelyn.

After her recent discovery, Christopher had been swamped with work, making it impossible to visit Bern City sooner.



Now that he'd finally cleared his schedule, he was determined to spend quality time with Evelyn.

Though Evelyn got along well with all six brothers, she'd always felt a distance between herself and Christopher and Andrew.

Andrew, being a lawyer, had helped Evelyn when she faced false accusations.

But with Christopher, there was an unspoken barrier she couldn't breach.

Despite knowing little about him, Evelyn couldn't deny his breathtaking looks. If Christopher ever entered show business, he'd undoubtedly become an overnight sensation.

The next morning, Evelyn prepared to visit the studio.

She'd texted Jonathan the night before, requesting time off.

With Christopher visiting and needing to check on Eleanor at the hospital, Evelyn had no spare time this weekend.

Arriving at the studio, Evelyn powered up her computer and efficiently wrapped up pending tasks, ensuring a smooth transition.

Given her limited availability moving forward, she decided against taking new projects.

"Evelyn! I thought you were off this weekend?" Jonathan's eyes lit up at the sight of her.

Evelyn shrugged. "Just dropping off some documents."

Before Jonathan could respond, the guest room door opened, revealing Judith. "Jonathan, are you done? Oh, hello Evelyn! What brings you here?"

Evelyn's smile faltered slightly. "Just finishing some work. Don't let me interrupt your plans."

Judith's elegant outfit suggested they were heading out.

Jonathan quickly clarified, "Nothing important. My mother rarely visits, so I'm taking her sightseeing this weekend."

Judith linked arms with Evelyn, her gaze calculating. "Evelyn, I've been meaning to ask—is your cousin currently single?"

Evelyn blinked.

Jonathan groaned. "Mother, please."

Judith waved him off. "What? It's a simple question."

Evelyn suppressed a sigh. This was going to be a long weekend.
###Chapter 337

Evelyn blinked in confusion. "My cousin?"

She didn't have any cousins.

Before she could process the situation, Judith leaned forward eagerly. "Don't be shy, Evelyn. Tell me, is your cousin single? Married? With that handsome face and wealth, he must be quite the catch!"

Jonathan frowned, cutting in sharply. "Mother, what nonsense are you spouting? Mr. Whitmore couldn't possibly be single."

Nathaniel was the heir to Bern City's wealthiest family. Even if marriage wasn't in his immediate plans, someone of his status would never be unattached. And even if he were single, he existed in a stratosphere far beyond their reach.

Jonathan's real plan was to win Evelyn's affection, then use her connection to Nathaniel to catapult his own career forward.

Evelyn's mind whirled at Judith's question. Was she seriously considering playing matchmaker for Nathaniel?

Judith waved a dismissive hand. "No harm in asking! My niece studied abroad—beautiful, educated, excellent pedigree. Can't I inquire on her behalf?"

Evelyn's suspicions were confirmed—Judith was indeed attempting to arrange a match.

Those piercing eyes locked onto Evelyn. "I'm just asking for my niece's sake. If he's taken or uninterested, we'll drop it."

Evelyn's lips twitched. She cleared her throat. "I believe he's technically single."

With their divorce proceedings scheduled for next Monday at the courthouse, Nathaniel would soon be officially available.

Judith's face lit up like a Christmas tree. "Really? What's his type? As Jonathan mentioned, my niece has exceptional standards—ivy league education, impeccable manners. Your cousin runs a corporation, doesn't he? This could be mutually beneficial."

Evelyn found herself drowning in the sudden interrogation.

"Are you hesitant to introduce them? They might hit it off splendidly! Then we'd practically be family."

"Mrs. Reeves, it's not that I object. He's a rather distant relative."

The truth was, with Nathaniel's status, he had socialites and heiresses lining up for his attention. Beatrice's obvious preference for Victoria made the situation even more complicated. Marrying into the Whitmore dynasty wasn't something just anyone could achieve.

"Evelyn darling, you needn't lift a finger. Just share his WhatsApp. Or give it to Jonathan—he'll pass it along to my niece."

Jonathan abruptly intervened. "Mother, we're running late for our appointment. We should go."

Only then did Judith reluctantly leave the office. Outside, she hissed at her son, "Why did you stop me?"

"Mother, if my cousin starts seeing Evelyn's 'cousin,' that creates complications. What if the Whitmores find such connections beneath them?"

Judith scoffed. "Evelyn's no aristocrat. The woman you're meeting today comes from real money—your cousin's Oxford classmate. You'd better impress her."

"If Evelyn doesn't pan out, you've got this alternative. No harm pursuing both options simultaneously. With your looks, you should aim for wealth and beauty."
###Chapter 338

Jonathan admired his reflection in the elevator's polished surface, a smug smile playing on his lips.

Progress with Evelyn was slow - she wasn't the type to open up easily. He needed to focus on his own advancement first.

Evelyn finished organizing the documents and stepped out of the studio.

She reached for her phone to call Christopher, wanting to let him know she'd finished work. But the call went unanswered.

Strange. Was he still occupied?

They'd made plans last night to meet after her shift ended.

Assuming he must be busy, she decided against calling again. Instead, she sent a text: "Christopher, I'm done with work."

Her phone rang within seconds.

Evelyn answered immediately. "Christopher, I-"

"Who is this?" A sharp female voice cut her off. "Why are you calling this number?"

Evelyn blinked at her phone screen. "My apologies, I must have dialed wrong."

Had Christopher given her the wrong number last night? That seemed impossible.

The woman's tone turned accusatory. "Don't play dumb! What's your relationship with Christopher? How do you know him?"

Evelyn's breath caught. This was definitely Christopher's number.

But who was this woman? A girlfriend? If so, Evelyn needed to clarify things to avoid complications.

"It's not what you're thinking," Evelyn explained quickly.

"Oh really?" The woman scoffed. "I've seen your WhatsApp history. You've had his number for months - since his business trip to Bern City."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone.

"You stopped talking for a while, but he kept sending you money. Quite the lucrative arrangement, isn't it?"

Evelyn's jaw clenched. "That's uncalled for. You're making assumptions without hearing me out. How dare you imply I'm some sort of escort?"

The woman laughed coldly. "Then what exactly do you do? Women like you always swarm around Christopher because of his money and looks. I've dealt with your type before."

"Let me make this clear - stop deluding yourself. He'll never stay with someone like you." The line went dead.

Evelyn stood frozen. Was that Christopher's girlfriend? From how she spoke, he sounded like a complete playboy.

This wasn't her business to interfere with his personal life. But the misunderstanding needed clarification.

They'd exchanged numbers but rarely messaged. The money transfers were bonuses after the Fleur International Design Competition - nothing inappropriate.

After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn typed: "Christopher, your girlfriend seems to have misunderstood our relationship. Please explain things to her."

Her message bounced back. She'd been blocked.
###Chapter 339

Evelyn stared at her phone screen in disbelief.

Christopher had blocked her number.

The realization hit her like a physical blow. Her own cousin's girlfriend had cut off all communication.

She clenched her jaw, frustration bubbling beneath her skin.

Nathaniel must have been preoccupied. That was the only explanation for why he hadn’t noticed her messages—or the misunderstanding that had spiraled from them.

After a tense moment, Evelyn exhaled sharply. There was no point dwelling on it now. She’d deal with it when Nathaniel was free.

Even if she tried to explain herself to that woman, it wouldn’t matter. The damage was already done.

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn tucked her phone away.

Since she’d already taken leave from the studio and Nathaniel was swamped, what now?

Her thoughts drifted to Eleanor.

"Grandma," she murmured.

Decision made, she flagged down a taxi and directed it toward the hospital.

Eleanor remained in the ICU, still too fragile for visitors. Evelyn could only hover outside, anxiously questioning the nurses for updates.

One nurse offered a reassuring smile. "Her blood pressure spiked early this morning, but we stabilized her. She’s resting comfortably now."

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered at the mention of the crisis. Relief flooded her when she heard Eleanor was stable.

Unable to see her grandmother, Evelyn closed her eyes and whispered a silent prayer.

As she turned to leave, the elevator doors slid open. Nathaniel stood there, deep in conversation with a group of doctors.

His head snapped up when he noticed her.

"Keep me updated," he told the doctors briskly before dismissing them.

One physician nodded. "Of course, Mr. Whitmore. Mrs. Whitmore Senior is under constant supervision. We won’t leave anything to chance."

Nathaniel acknowledged this with a curt nod, and the medical team dispersed.

Evelyn had overheard enough. With round-the-clock care, Eleanor was in good hands.

Nathaniel’s lips pressed into a thin line. "She’s stable. Don’t worry." His tone was stiff, almost guarded.

Evelyn nodded. "That’s good to hear."

A beat of silence stretched between them.

Nathaniel’s gaze flickered over her. "You’re not working today? I thought you had weekend shifts."

Someone of Evelyn’s skill shouldn’t have needed to waste her time at that small studio. The thought of its owner made Nathaniel’s jaw tighten.

Evelyn hesitated. "I’ve decided to prioritize my studies. I can freelance for extra income."

His brows drew together. "You need money?"

"Everyone does," she said flatly. "Bills don’t pay themselves."

Nathaniel studied her for a long moment before reaching for his wallet. He extracted a sleek black card and held it out.

"Take it."

Evelyn eyed the card but made no move to accept it. "No, thanks."

"You refused the assets before, but now you’re struggling. If word gets out, it reflects poorly on me."

She frowned. "How does my financial situation affect your reputation?"

Was this some kind of power play?

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "You’re still my wife."

"For now."

"Even after the divorce, people will talk if I let my ex-wife struggle." His voice hardened. "Just take it."

Evelyn took a deliberate step back. "Not happening."

Accepting his money would only muddy the waters between them. She refused to be labeled a gold-digger.

Just then, her phone buzzed. Christopher’s name flashed across the screen.

Evelyn answered immediately. "Finally."

The voice on the other end wasn’t Christopher’s.

"Are you Christopher Montgomery’s family?"

Evelyn’s breath caught. "Yes. I am."
###Chapter 340

The phone rang sharply in Evelyn's hand.

"We're the police. There's a situation at the Grand Royale Hotel. Could you come over?" The officer's tense voice made her stomach drop.

Something had happened to Christopher.

He hardly ever visited Bern City—he was practically a stranger here!

Heart pounding, she ended the call and bolted from the hospital. She barely registered Nathaniel standing in the hallway as she rushed past him.

His eyebrows shot up when she didn't even acknowledge him. A muscle twitched in his jaw as he watched her retreating figure. What could possibly make her this frantic?

It couldn't be Julian—he'd just finished examining Eleanor an hour ago and was currently on break.

So who had called Evelyn?

The cab ride to the Grand Royale felt endless.

A cluster of stern-faced people stood outside the penthouse suite, blocking the doorway like sentinels. But to her surprise, they parted to let her through without a word.

Her pulse thundered in her ears as she stepped inside.

Two uniformed officers stood in the lavish living room.

And there, perched on the velvet sofa like a queen holding court, sat a stunning woman in a silk robe—with Christopher beside her, his expression stormy.

Evelyn approached cautiously. "What's going on?"

Had they fought because of some misunderstanding?

Christopher exhaled sharply. "Nothing serious. The police just needed a family member since I'm from out of town."

The beautiful woman scoffed before he finished. "Nothing serious? Explain yourself, Christopher Montgomery! Did you come to Bern City for business or pleasure? I expected some cheap fling, not this—"

"Enough!" His voice turned glacial. "You can insult me all you want, but not Evelyn."

Despite his playboy reputation, no one disparaged his cousin in his presence.

His frown deepened. "And take that back. What's 'cheap' about Evelyn? She's compassionate, intelligent, and beautiful."

Evelyn's cheeks burned at the unexpected praise. How could he say such things so boldly when his girlfriend looked like she'd stepped off a magazine cover?

"So you admit it!" The woman's voice turned shrill. "After less than a month together, you're already chasing someone new?"

This was spiraling out of control. Evelyn intervened quickly. "Miss, you're mistaken. He's my cousin. It's not what you think."

The woman let out a bitter laugh. "Save your lies! I used the same 'cousin' excuse to get with him initially. If you think you can steal him using the same trick, think again!"

An awkward silence fell over the room.

Christopher stood abruptly. "We're done here. It's over. Leave."

Tears welled in the woman's eyes. "Christopher, you can't do this! You know how much I care about you!"

Evelyn couldn't let their relationship end because of her. She'd never forgive herself.

She touched Christopher's arm. "This is because of my message this morning, isn't it? She's misinterpreting our relationship."

He pulled out his phone to check—but Evelyn's name wasn't in his recent messages.
###Chapter 341

Evelyn's lips curved into a bitter smile as she watched Nathaniel scroll through his contacts. "It's not there."

The air between them grew thick with tension.

"Why not? I specifically pinned our chat." His brows furrowed in confusion as he double-checked, but her name was nowhere to be found.

She cleared her throat awkwardly. "My number's been blocked."

Nathaniel's head snapped up, his expression darkening. "Who blocked your number?" When no one answered, he whirled around, his voice sharp. "Was it you? I let you use my phone, and you had the audacity to block Evelyn?"

Victoria's eyes welled with tears. "I begged you to pin our chat, but you refused! And now you've pinned hers? How could you do this to me? I'm your girlfriend!"

A cold laugh escaped him. "Know your place. You don't even compare to her." His jaw clenched, but he forced himself to stay composed—Evelyn was watching.

The anger in his eyes melted into something softer as he turned back to Evelyn. "This is just a misunderstanding. I didn’t block you. Please don’t be upset."

"I'm not." Evelyn's gaze flickered to Victoria, who was now sobbing into her hands. A pang of sympathy twisted in her chest, though she wasn’t sure what to say.

Typical playboy behavior.

The way he casually suggested breaking up only confirmed it.

Just then, an officer stood, clearing his throat. "Enough. Miss Carter, sign here, then you’re free to go. Handle your personal matters elsewhere."

Evelyn quickly signed the document. "Apologies for the disturbance."

Silence settled over the room, broken only by Victoria’s muffled cries.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. "Evelyn, let’s go."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes. She’s not worth another second." He strode toward the bedroom. "Give me a minute to change."

Left alone, Evelyn shifted uncomfortably. She glanced at Victoria, still curled on the couch. "Hey—"

Before she could finish, Victoria shot her a venomous glare and stormed into the bedroom after Nathaniel.

Evelyn sighed, staying rooted in place. It would be inappropriate to follow.

Moments later, Nathaniel’s voice carried through the door—sharp, furious. "What the hell are you doing? Are you out of your mind? Put your clothes back on!"

The door slammed shut.

Inside, Victoria seized her chance, pressing herself against him. "Nathaniel, I know you still care about me. Last night, you said my body was perfect—"

His fingers dug into her chin, forcing her to meet his icy stare. "Yes. But then you insulted my sister. You’re nothing but a temporary distraction. Did you really think I wouldn’t find out about the lies you’ve been spreading using my name?"

Her breath hitched.

"If you want to walk away unharmed, leave. Now. Or my next call will be to my lawyer."

Nathaniel had never hidden his reputation as a playboy. Victoria had clawed her way into his life, scheming to cut ties between him and his ex—only to end up as just another disposable fling.

He’d tolerated her antics because she wasn’t the only one.

But there was a line. And blocking Evelyn? Unforgivable.

Victoria shrank under his glare, realizing—too late—that she’d crossed it.

Disgusted, he shoved her away. "Pack your things and get out of Silvercrest. If I catch you near Evelyn again, I won’t hesitate to ruin you."

His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "And trust me, darling—I can do it with one phone call."
###Chapter 342

Horror finally dawned on the woman's face, her movements sluggish with delayed realization. "Alright, I'll go. Don't be angry. Let's both take some time. I'll wait for you. We can talk when you return to Nord City."

Christopher's gaze was icy. To him, there was nothing left to discuss between them.

Had she not crossed the line, he might have tolerated her petty games. But now that Evelyn was involved, he couldn't let it slide.

He gave a noncommittal hum. For now, sending this delusional woman back to Nord City was the solution—keeping her from causing trouble in Bern City and sparing Evelyn the drama.

His response lit a spark of hope in her. She packed her bags with renewed energy.

As long as they weren't officially over, she could still twist him around her finger once he returned to Nord City.

Christopher, now changed, strode out of the bedroom.

The sight of Evelyn standing with her back to him struck him as oddly endearing, and he chuckled. "Sit. Why are you standing there?"

She turned, still uneasy. "Since everything's settled, should I leave? Maybe the two of you should talk?" After all, this was between him and his girlfriend. Evelyn had no place interfering.

"No. If anyone's leaving, it's her. Not you." The moment the words left his lips, the woman stormed out of the suite, luggage in tow.

Now alone, Evelyn hesitated. "Christopher, did I cause trouble for you? Did you explain things to her?"

"She's not important. This kind of woman—" He cut himself off, softening his tone. "Evelyn, she's just a girlfriend. Nothing more. She won't be your sister-in-law."

Evelyn's lips twitched. So it was official—Christopher was a playboy!

Sensing her judgment, he clarified, "Evelyn, dating and marriage are two different things. What just happened proves we're not compatible."

The realization hit her—among her six brothers, there was indeed a playboy.

Under the weight of his striking gaze, she couldn't help but sigh. Christopher did have that irresistible charm women fell for.

A pang of guilt flickered across his face as he rubbed his nose, sheepish. "Let's go to the tourist spot. I heard it's the perfect place to watch the sunset."

Evelyn nodded. His love life was his own mess to sort out. At least they were family.

Soon, they left Vania Hotel together and slipped into his car.

A sleek black luxury car idled by the curb. Nathaniel watched them drive off, his brow furrowing. "Find out who that man is."

Earlier, curiosity and concern had gnawed at him. He'd wanted to know what had unsettled Evelyn, worried for her safety.

It wasn't unreasonable, given how her adoptive parents had once dragged her into danger.

Yet here he was—the fool who'd worried for nothing.

Robert hesitated after calling the hotel for details, unsure whether to disclose the truth.

"Out with it," Nathaniel ordered, loosening his tie.
###Chapter 343

Dark clouds seemed to gather around Nathaniel's imposing figure as his irritation grew palpable.

Robert took a deep breath before delivering his report. "According to our hotel source, the man in question is staying in the penthouse suite."

"The police were called when his girlfriend discovered him cheating with another woman," Robert continued carefully.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze intensified. "Who's the other woman?"

A cold sweat broke out on Robert's forehead. This was the dangerous question he'd been dreading.

Swallowing hard, Robert answered, "It's Mrs. Whitmore." The temperature in the room seemed to drop instantly.

After a long silence that stretched Robert's nerves thin, Nathaniel finally spoke. "Let's go."

Robert blinked in confusion.

Go? Where exactly?

Evelyn and Christopher spent the entire afternoon exploring the city's landmarks.

It had been years since Evelyn allowed herself such simple pleasures. Financial struggles had kept her working multiple jobs just to survive.

As dusk approached, they decided to end their excursion.

Evelyn caught a glimpse of something in the rearview mirror as she settled into the passenger seat.

Christopher noticed her distraction. "Something wrong?"

"Nothing important," she replied quickly.

"It's getting late. There's a highly-rated restaurant nearby - shall we try it?" Christopher suggested.

The timing was perfect as Evelyn realized she was growing hungry.

Upon entering the elegant restaurant, Evelyn froze. Was that Jonathan sitting near the entrance?

Jonathan sat beside his mother Judith, across from a stunning brunette. He was pouring wine for the woman with practiced elegance, while a lavish bouquet of roses adorned the empty chair beside them.

The scene screamed "arranged marriage meeting."

Averting her eyes, Evelyn followed Christopher to their reserved private dining room upstairs.

Later that evening, Christopher handed Evelyn a black credit card. "Take this. Consider it your unlimited shopping fund from now on."

Evelyn laughed lightly. "Business must be booming. I heard your music academy is preparing for IPO. Are piano classes particularly popular?"

Christopher studied her face. "Interested in learning?"

She shook her head. "Just curious. I'm probably too old to start now."

Margaret chose that moment to emerge from her room. "She showed remarkable talent as a child."

"Our downstairs neighbor had an electric keyboard. Evelyn could play entire pieces just by reading the sheet music."

"The neighbor said she had a natural gift," Margaret continued, eyes misty. "If she'd grown up with your family, she would have had every opportunity..."

Christopher's expression darkened at the painful truth.

Had that wretched nanny not lost baby Evelyn, she would never have endured such hardships.

With quiet determination, he said, "It's never too late. I established this music academy precisely for such purposes. You should enroll, Evelyn."

"Really? You think I could still learn?"

"The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago," Christopher said with a gentle smile. "The second best time is now."
###Chapter 344

A radiant smile lit up Evelyn's face. "That sounds wonderful! I'd love to give it a try!"

After all, financial constraints were no longer an issue for her.

The inability to learn piano as a child due to lack of funds had always been a lingering regret. This was her chance to finally fulfill that dream.

Margaret practically bounced with excitement. "You absolutely should, Evelyn! Christopher is an excellent piano teacher. He can guide you through it."

Christopher had yet to reveal his true identity as a renowned pianist. Soon, he would need to assemble his team to establish a prestigious music academy right here in Bern City.

No matter what it took, he was determined to turn his little white lie into reality.

Evelyn and Christopher spent a few minutes discussing lesson schedules.

When she returned from freshening up, the living room was empty.

She glanced toward the balcony—no sign of him there either. "Where did he go?"

"He had to leave suddenly for an urgent matter. But he left this for you." Margaret handed her a sleek black card.

The sight of the credit card stirred conflicting emotions. Ever since her brothers' careers had taken off, they'd been showering her with financial support.

She turned the card over in her fingers. "Aunt Margaret... should I really accept this? You always taught me to maintain my dignity, no matter how poor we were."

"Oh, sweetheart. This is from your own brother. You're family now. I asked Christopher—he said this amount means nothing to them. Consider it your allowance."

"You're all going to be there for each other through life's ups and downs. That's what family does."

Evelyn's lips curved. "You're my family too, you know."

"Evelyn, Alexander mentioned that paying off the house installments alone would take you forever. They can cover it for you first."

"Olivia doesn't mind at all. Just think about it—you can always pay them back later. It's really no trouble."

"I'll consider it."

"I'm just so glad to see your family treating you well, Evelyn. Family should support each other."

"With such loving brothers looking out for you, why not enjoy the privilege? Don't be so hard on yourself. Not everyone is blessed with six devoted brothers. What's stopping you?"

Back in her room, Margaret's words echoed in Evelyn's mind. Was she really being too distant with her brothers?

Her fingers traced the edge of the credit card as her other hand rested on her abdomen.

She pulled out her phone and dialed Alexander, who answered immediately. "Evelyn? Everything alright?"

"Are you busy right now?"

"Never too busy for you. What's on your mind?" He closed his laptop and moved to a quieter space.

She repeated Margaret's advice. "Alexander... do you think I've been too guarded with all of you?"

A soft exhale came through the line. "We understand we found you late, Evelyn. Sibling bonds take time to build. We're patient—we'll wait for you to fully accept us."

After a thoughtful pause, she spoke again. "Then I'd like to take you up on that offer. Could you lend me the money to pay off the house in full?"

She could practically hear his smile through the phone. "It would be my pleasure."

The next morning, Evelyn went straight to the bank to arrange the lump sum payment.

Just as she took her queue number, she collided with someone familiar.

"Evelyn? What brings you here so early?" Jonathan sounded genuinely surprised to see her.
###Chapter 345

Evelyn Carter never imagined she'd bump into Jonathan Reeves at the bank.

The realization took a moment to settle in. "I have some business here," she said, tilting her head slightly. "What about you?"

He cleared his throat, shifting uncomfortably. "Same." His answer was vague, and his demeanor was oddly stiff.

A bank officer approached them shortly after. "Miss, sir, are you here for a loan application?"

"Yes," Jonathan replied, his voice tight.

The officer barely spared him a glance before turning to Evelyn with a polite smile. "And you, miss?"

She handed over her appointment slip. "I called ahead this morning."

Instantly, the officer's expression brightened. "Ah, Ms. Carter! Right this way. Our manager has been expecting you."

The sudden shift in enthusiasm caught Evelyn off guard. She threw Jonathan an apologetic glance before following the officer toward the VIP lounge.

Meanwhile, Jonathan stood frozen, processing what he'd just witnessed. Only high-net-worth clients—those with deposits exceeding a million dollars—received that kind of treatment.

He had come to secure a loan for a house in Jeinburg, but all his funds were tied up in his struggling studio.

Now, faced with rejection, his pride stung.

The same officer returned moments later, his tone indifferent. "Hand over your documents."

Jonathan forced a smile, sliding an envelope across the counter. "A small token of appreciation."

The officer pushed it back without hesitation. "Mr. Reeves, honestly? Your chances of approval are slim. Maybe try another bank."

Jonathan's stomach dropped. "What? Last time we spoke, you made it sound promising."

"You still haven’t settled your studio loan. Borrowing more? Unlikely."

Frustration coiled inside him, but he bit it back.

His gaze flickered toward the VIP room.

The officer followed his look and smirked. "You know her?"

Jonathan seized the opportunity. "We went to the same university. She actually works at my studio now."

The officer whistled. "Damn. How’d you land someone like that? Forget the loan—ask her to invest!"

Jonathan swallowed hard. "What’s she here for, anyway?"

"Paying off her mortgage early. Millions, in cash. Transferred overnight."

A dangerous thought sparked in Jonathan’s mind.

Last night, his date had lost interest the moment she learned he didn’t own property in Jeinburg.

And now, here was Evelyn—flushing millions into a house like it was nothing.

If only that money were his.

"How long does it take to schedule a deduction?" he asked abruptly.

"About two weeks."

A plan formed. If he could win Evelyn over, she might lend him the money.

After all, it could be their future home.

The idea grew more tempting by the second.

An hour later, Evelyn emerged from the VIP room, documents in hand.
###Chapter 346

"Finished already, Evelyn?"

Evelyn looked up sharply to see Jonathan approaching, his expression unreadable. She forced a polite smile. "Yes. What about you? Did you get the loan approved?"

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Not yet. The paperwork is more complicated than I expected. These things take time—can't rush them." He gestured toward the parking lot. "Need a ride somewhere?"

"I was heading to the university library. It's not on your way to the studio, so don't worry about it."

"Actually, I have to stop by campus too. Perfect timing."

She didn't question the coincidence. Jonathan often visited the university for networking events and guest lectures, leveraging his alumni status to promote his design studio.

As he drove, he glanced at her. "So, Evelyn… what brought you to the bank earlier? You were in the VIP section."

"Just some routine inquiries." She kept her tone light, omitting the fact that she'd paid off her mortgage early.

Alexander had transferred the funds last night with startling efficiency. She hadn't even had time to process it before the money landed in her account.

Jonathan didn't press further, but the confirmation solidified in his mind: Evelyn had serious financial backing.

When they arrived on campus, she thanked him and stepped out. He watched her walk away, determination hardening in his gaze.

His theory? That money came from her brothers. Dropping millions at her age? Only old money could manage that.

The woman he'd met on yesterday's blind date had ambition, but her middle-class background paled in comparison.

Evelyn, though? Same alma mater. Elite connections. And now, undeniable wealth.

Jonathan adjusted his cufflinks. Time to change tactics.



By late afternoon, Evelyn left the library to find the quad buzzing with activity.

Petals and flickering candles formed a path through the crowd. Her stomach dropped.

"Evelyn."

The sea of students parted, revealing Jonathan at the center, holding a bouquet of roses.

Dread coiled in her chest. This couldn’t be happening.

He stepped forward, voice carrying. "From the moment I first saw you on campus, I knew you were different. But I didn’t understand why."

Her fingers tightened around her bag strap.

"Then you competed in the Fleur International Design Competition," he continued. "That’s when I realized—it was love."

The crowd sighed. Evelyn’s skin prickled.

"I recruited you to my studio because I couldn’t stand the thought of you working anywhere else. The night you accepted? I didn’t sleep at all."

She opened her mouth to interrupt, but he pressed on.

"Please, let me finish. I need you to hear this." He dropped to one knee, flowers extended. "You’re cautious with your heart, and I respect that. But I want to be the one who makes you feel safe. Loved. Protected. Always."

Balloons burst into the sky—pink, like the flush creeping up Evelyn’s neck for all the wrong reasons.

A girl nearby clutched her friend’s arm. "Oh my God, say yes!"

Evelyn’s jaw set.

Romance? This was a trap.
###Chapter 347

The courtyard erupted in squeals and cheers, trapping Evelyn in an awkward position. Her juniors were fueling the excitement without understanding the situation.

While Evelyn frowned in discomfort, Jonathan's eyes sparkled with anticipation. "Evelyn, what's stopping you?"

Memories of that upscale restaurant flashed through her mind. "Jonathan, don't you already have a girlfriend?"

He should at least admit he'd been on blind dates, especially since one woman had even met his parents.

"I don't, Evelyn. You must have misunderstood," he denied quickly.

Just then, a group of figures appeared at the stairway near the administration building.

Nathaniel happened to glance out the window, spotting Evelyn standing outside with a man kneeling before her. From the back, it clearly was Jonathan Reeves, owner of the campus studio.

Theodore chuckled knowingly. "Ah, young love. These public confessions are quite common on campus."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed dangerously. "It would be common... if he weren't proposing to my wife. Explain this."

Theodore's smile froze. Rubbing his eyes, he confirmed the woman was indeed Evelyn Carter-Whitmore!

He remembered clearly when rumors spread about Evelyn having a sugar daddy. Nathaniel had slammed their marriage certificate on his desk as proof. But the Whitmore family had insisted on keeping it quiet, so no one knew the college's most eligible bachelor was actually married.

Mopping his forehead with a handkerchief, Theodore stammered, "I-I'll call security to break this up immediately."

Internally, he cursed the idiot who dared propose to Nathaniel Whitmore's wife. The fool should know his place!

Meanwhile, the crowd swelled as more students gathered. Evelyn felt completely overwhelmed.

The situation had spiraled beyond her control. She thought she'd made herself perfectly clear to Jonathan before.

Seeing no alternative, Evelyn looked Jonathan squarely in the eyes. "Jonathan, I was married before."

His face fell. "Really? Using the same excuse twice to reject me?"

"I'm serious, Jonathan. I was married. It's the truth."

Studying her expression, Jonathan realized she wasn't lying. Could it be true?

When he hesitated, Evelyn continued, "I took three years off school because of my marriage. I only returned after my divorce."

"I... see." Awkwardness colored his features.

This revelation shocked him. He'd thought she was joking this whole time!

Yet the memory of Evelyn's wealthy brothers—who could casually spend millions—gave him pause. So what if she was divorced? She was still filthy rich!

After quick calculations, he declared loudly, "Evelyn, I don't care if you're divorced! That changes nothing about my feelings!"

"And I should thank your ex-husband for letting you go. You're too precious for me to lose." His response stunned her—this wasn't the reaction she'd anticipated at all.

From what she'd overheard from Judith, Jonathan would never accept a divorced woman.

"Say yes! Say yes!" The crowd began chanting again, their voices rising in a deafening chorus.
###Chapter 348

"Why hesitate? He doesn't care that you're divorced."

"Exactly! He's such a romantic. Just accept him already! Don't just stand there spacing out—you don’t want to let a good man slip away!"

Jonathan wore a triumphant smirk. He had plenty of experience chasing women. His success rate? Nearly flawless. Making Evelyn fall for him wouldn’t be difficult.

Now he understood why she had been avoiding his advances. Her divorce had shattered her confidence.

That was why she couldn’t accept his feelings!

This realization only fueled his arrogance. If they got married, Evelyn’s brothers would invest in his studio. Once he succeeded, he could divorce her and marry someone else.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was torn. Rejecting him publicly would humiliate him, but letting the misunderstanding fester wasn’t an option.

She took a deep breath. "Jonathan, you’re a great guy, but I don’t think we’re compatible—"

Before she could finish, security guards arrived, dispersing the crowd.

One of them aimed a fire extinguisher at the candles, turning the romantic setup into a soggy mess in seconds.

Jonathan’s face darkened. "What the hell are you doing? Can’t you see what’s happening here? Learn to read the room!"

His campus popularity had inflated his ego. Having his grand gesture ruined was a direct blow to his pride, and he lashed out.

A guard replied calmly, "We’re just enforcing campus rules. Open flames are prohibited."

Jonathan scoffed. "What rules? Is this because I didn’t bribe you? I’ll make it up to you later. Just back off."

Ignoring him, the guards tossed the ruined candles into a trash bin.

He gritted his teeth. "Are you deaf? Do you want to lose your jobs? I can make one call to Mr. Winslow and have you fired."

The guard didn’t flinch. "We’re following his orders."

Jonathan froze. "No way."

"No way?" A cold voice cut through the tension. "It is my order."

Theodore Winslow stepped forward. Most of the students had already scattered.

Evelyn lifted her gaze toward Theodore—and then froze. Standing beside him were several men in suits, but one stood out effortlessly.

Nathaniel Whitmore.

His piercing glare was fixed on the scene with visible irritation. "Mr. Winslow, it seems safety regulations aren’t taken seriously here."

Theodore quickly defended, "This kind of reckless behavior is strictly forbidden on campus. Felix—Jonathan knows that. He’s pushing his luck."

He turned to Jonathan, his tone sharp. "You’re a top graduate. How could you set such a poor example?"

Theodore was making him the scapegoat—better than risking Nathaniel’s wrath falling on the school.

Jonathan couldn’t meet Nathaniel’s eyes. "I can explain. I just wanted to confess to Evelyn. I don’t usually break rules. You understand, right, Mr. Whitmore? She’s your cousin, isn’t she?"

A slow, dangerous smile curved Nathaniel’s lips.

"My cousin?" His voice was lethally soft. "Who told you that?"
###Chapter 349

Evelyn was stunned by Nathaniel's response. What on earth was that man plotting?

Was he planning to expose their relationship one day before their divorce? The divorce was happening tomorrow!

Her nerves were stretched thin.

Theodore scolded sharply. "What cousin? Shut your mouth, Jonathan!"

He couldn't believe his ears when Jonathan blurted that out. Evelyn was Nathaniel's wife!

How dare Jonathan make advances toward the wife of the wealthiest man in the city? She was far beyond his reach.

Evelyn's cheeks burned at the mention of that word.

Back when Cassandra spread vicious rumors about her, Nathaniel had personally intervened by presenting their marriage certificate in Theodore's office.

So, Theodore knew they were married.

Nathaniel's icy glare pierced through Jonathan. "How dare someone like you confess to her? I won't allow it!"

Jonathan's face turned ashen. "Please, Mr. Whitmore, let me explain!"

Now that Nathaniel was pretending to be her cousin, Evelyn wished the ground would swallow her whole.

Nathaniel ignored Jonathan and stepped closer to her. "What are you standing there for, cousin? Let's go."

Under the weight of everyone's stares, she forced herself to follow him out of the room.

Jonathan tried to pursue them but was blocked by security.

Theodore frowned. "Jonathan, you were always a smart man. Why are you acting like this now? Evelyn is out of your league."

Too proud to admit defeat, Jonathan snapped, "Why not? She's a woman, and I'm a man. I have every right to pursue her. You have no say in this."

If he could win Evelyn over and get her brothers to invest in his studio, he wouldn’t need to grovel before anyone at the university anymore.

The fact that she was a soon-to-be-divorced woman only boosted his confidence. Women like her were easy prey.

Besides, he had never been married, making him the more valuable one. Surely, Evelyn was smart enough to realize rejecting him would be a mistake.

With a cold expression, Jonathan turned and stormed off. He had no intention of wasting another second on Theodore.

Snorting at Jonathan's arrogance, Theodore turned to his secretary. "Withdraw all our investments in him."

"There's no point keeping someone like him around. He's nothing but trouble. The sooner we cut ties, the better."

Angering Nathaniel and losing the Whitmore family's investments would be a massive blow to the university.

Theodore had considered advising Jonathan, who seemed oblivious to Evelyn's connection with Nathaniel. But Jonathan's attitude changed his mind.

Foolish men like him were bound to meet their downfall sooner or later.

Evelyn and Nathaniel walked out of the campus together.

Settling into the back seat of the car, she glanced at him. "What were you doing here?"

"Why? Did I ruin your romantic moment?" Nathaniel's sharp tongue struck again.

She leaned back in her seat. "It wasn't romantic. Thank goodness you showed up. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have known how to escape that mess."

"Oh? Kneeling on one knee to confess isn't romantic enough for you?" he taunted, his tone laced with bitterness.

The moment the words left his mouth, he realized how acidic he sounded and shut his eyes, refusing to speak further.

She replied calmly, "That depends. I don’t feel anything for Jonathan. It’s like how I married you with one-sided feelings, and you ignored me for three years after waking up."

"There’s nothing romantic about being pursued by someone you don’t love." The weight of her words hung heavy in the air.

The driver and Robert held their breaths.

Perhaps Evelyn was the only person in the world brave enough to talk back to Nathaniel Whitmore.
###Chapter 350



Nathaniel Whitmore wasn’t angry when he heard Evelyn Carter disliked Jonathan Reeves.

In fact, it pleased him.

But he couldn’t fathom why she’d even compare him to that man. Unlike that scheming bastard, Nathaniel would never betray her trust.

A smirk curled his lips. "At least your instincts aren’t completely off. Jonathan’s character is flawed—ambition without substance."

"Not to mention his obsession with status and his manipulative nature."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Nathaniel Whitmore, do you get some twisted satisfaction from belittling others?"

She might not like Jonathan, but she respected his work ethic. He wasn’t the villain Nathaniel painted him to be.

"I’m stating facts."

"And I find your judgment lacking. Try harder." She turned toward the window, effectively ending the conversation.

The sight of the back of her head irritated him.

His frustration only grew when he remembered spotting her leaving a hotel with another man—someone he didn’t recognize.

Evelyn always seemed surrounded by attractive men.

She checked her watch. "Drop me off here."

"You live in this area?" His tone was skeptical.

"I’ll take the subway. It’s faster."

"Which neighborhood? I can drive you."

"No need. You’d have to go out of your way."

Her blunt refusal stung his pride. He kicked the back of the driver’s seat. "Pull over. Let her out."

The car stopped abruptly.

Evelyn stepped out, but hesitated before shutting the door. She turned back, meeting Nathaniel’s expectant gaze.

His eyes gleamed. "Changed your mind?"



If she wanted to get back in, he’d allow it.

"Nine a.m. tomorrow. Courthouse. Don’t be late." Her voice was firm.

His jaw tightened.

Before he could respond, the door slammed shut. His fingers tugged at his tie, frustration simmering beneath his skin. He didn’t even understand why he was so agitated.

By the time Evelyn got home, Margaret Dawson had prepared an elaborate dinner.

Christopher Montgomery—her ever-charming cousin—lavished praise on every dish, making Margaret beam with pride.

Evelyn watched, amused. She’d never realized just how effortlessly Christopher could sweet-talk his way into anyone’s good graces.

Between his striking looks and silver tongue, no woman stood a chance.

After dinner, they settled on the couch. Evelyn lowered her voice. "Chris, now I see why women adore you. You’ve mastered the art of flattery."

He grinned. "Can’t help it. Comes naturally."

"Teach me."

He ruffled her hair. "You don’t need it. Just being yourself is enough. If anyone gives you trouble, remember—you’ve got six brothers ready to back you up."

The reassurance warmed her. Having family to rely on was a comfort she’d missed.

She smiled. "Noted. By the way, when does your music academy open? I’d love to take weekend lessons. Work-free Saturdays sound perfect."

"It’ll take a while. Even after renovations, we need to air out the place."

"How about buying a piano for home? I can teach you basics first. That way, you’ll be ahead when classes start."

"Deal!"

"Rest up. I’ll head out now. Tomorrow, we’ll shop for the perfect piano."

Her smile faltered.

Tomorrow was the day she and Nathaniel would finalize their divorce.
###Chapter 351

The day Evelyn was supposed to appear in court clashed with her piano shopping plans with Christopher.

She was trapped in an impossible situation. What could she possibly do?

"Maybe we could reschedule for tomorrow?" she suggested hesitantly.

Christopher chuckled. "Oh, silly me. You have classes tomorrow, don’t you? No worries—I’ll drive you to campus myself."

He had been waiting for an opportunity like this.

Playing the role of the perfect older cousin had always been his dream.

Evelyn stiffened. "That’s really not necessary, Christopher."

"Nonsense! It’s my day off. What’s the harm in dropping you off?" He grinned. "Get some rest, Evelyn. I’ll be here bright and early."

"Christopher—"

But he was already gone before she could protest further.

This was spiraling out of control.

She had an appointment with Nathaniel tomorrow morning—the day their divorce would be finalized—and afternoon lectures she couldn’t miss.

Given Christopher’s stubbornness, refusing him wasn’t an option.

How could she fix this?

Today was supposed to mark the end of her marriage to Nathaniel. The last thing she needed was Christopher discovering their past.

If he found out, he’d never let it go.

And if he angered Nathaniel? Christopher’s music academy in Bern City would be ruined.

She couldn’t let that happen.

Back in her room, she paced, searching for a solution.

What excuse could she possibly give to avoid Christopher driving her to campus?

Rejecting him outright would hurt him—he’d been so eager just moments ago.

But she couldn’t risk him learning the truth.

Her phone buzzed.

Jonathan’s name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn ignored it. She already knew what he wanted.

There was nothing left to say.

Her instincts told her his feelings weren’t genuine. A woman’s intuition was rarely wrong.

But the calls didn’t stop.

When the ringing finally ceased, a text appeared:

Evelyn, I’m outside your building. If you don’t answer, I’ll knock on every door until you do.

Her patience snapped.

She called back. "Jonathan, I’ve made myself clear. We’re not compatible."

"Evelyn! Finally." His voice was warm. "Don’t worry about what happened on campus. I’ll make it up to you—a proper confession this time."

"I don’t want one," she said flatly.

"Why not? If you’re worried about being divorced, don’t be. It doesn’t matter to me. I like you."

She pinched the bridge of her nose. This conversation was going in circles.

"But I don’t like you."

"Evelyn, I know you’re overwhelmed right now. You don’t have to decide tonight. Take your time. Sweet dreams."

The call ended before she could respond.

She stared at her phone, disgusted.

Since when had Jonathan become so insufferable?

Maybe she’d never noticed because she’d never been interested.

Besides, she was pregnant—carrying Nathaniel’s child—and about to finalize their divorce.

The last thing she wanted was another relationship.

Had she somehow given Jonathan the wrong idea?

After that exhausting call, she texted Sophia, venting about the situation.

She even mentioned the time she’d accidentally run into Jonathan during his blind date at that restaurant.
###Chapter 352

Sophia exhaled sharply. "Evelyn, stop blaming yourself. Jonathan is the one at fault here, not you. I genuinely believed he was decent, but to discover he was dating someone else while chasing after you? The audacity! He's clearly manipulating you."

"Sophia, I turned him down when he tried those cheesy flower gestures. He backed off immediately after that. He never mentioned it again."

"That public confession outside the library? Completely unhinged. And showing up at your place at night? That's not romantic—it's terrifying."

"Evelyn, don't let your past define your worth. You deserve so much better than this. Just cut him off completely."

The conversation lifted Evelyn's spirits slightly. Hanging up, she grimaced at the thought of her early morning appointment.

A plan formed in her mind—she’d leave before dawn. By the time Christopher came to pick her up, she could claim she’d already left.

Perfect.

The next morning, sunlight streamed through her curtains later than expected.

Her alarm hadn’t gone off.

Panicked, she dressed hastily and rushed out—only to collide with Christopher and Margaret hauling grocery bags into the house.

"You're awake! Aunt Margaret and I went shopping. Got all your favorites," Christopher announced cheerfully.

Margaret bustled toward the kitchen. "Wash up, Evelyn. Breakfast is ready."

Evelyn forced a polite smile.

Christopher nudged her playfully. "Up so early? Aunt Margaret said you don’t have Monday classes. I was going to let you sleep in before we hit the mall for that piano you wanted."

She cleared her throat. "No morning lectures, but I need to study at the library."

"No problem. I’ll drop you off after breakfast."

Her smile turned strained. Escape seemed impossible.

After breakfast, she checked the clock. "Christopher, we should go."

"Why the rush?"

"Just... something came up." She figured she could head to campus first, then take a cab to the courthouse.

Making Nathaniel wait a little wouldn’t hurt.

Oblivious, Christopher drove her to college without suspicion.

The entire ride, Evelyn’s nerves were frayed. She texted Nathaniel: Running late. Please wait.

His immediate call made her flinch.

She declined and typed: Can’t talk now.

His next message burned through the screen: Who are you with?

She left it on read.

The car halted at the campus gates.

"Thanks, Christopher! Drive safe!" She bolted before he could respond.

From the shadows, she watched his car disappear before slipping out to hail a cab.

Rush hour made it impossible.

Near tears, she dialed Nathaniel. He answered instantly.

Before he could speak, she blurted, "Any chance we can reschedule, Mr. Whitmore?"
###Chapter 353

"What's wrong?" Nathaniel's deep voice rumbled through the phone.

Evelyn cleared her throat awkwardly. "I'm still trying to get a taxi on campus. It might take me over an hour."

She bit her lip before adding, "Could you wait for me?"

Nathaniel glanced at his platinum watch, an amused smirk playing on his lips. Yet his tone remained deliberately harsh. "Evelyn Carter, making me wait for our appointment? Is this some kind of game?"

"This isn't a game!" Her voice rose slightly. "No tricks, no schemes. I swear I'm serious about the divorce."

His smile vanished instantly. She always knew how to ruin his mood with perfect timing.

"Do you have any idea," he said icily, "how much my time is worth? I agreed to meet at 9:00 sharp. Now you expect me to wait? Can you even afford my hourly rate?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Just tell me the amount. I'll transfer it immediately."

"Not happening. Be punctual." The line went dead.

Panicked, she redialed, but Nathaniel didn't answer.

Fingers flying across her screen, she typed: "Got a cab. On my way now. Won't take long - please wait."

The message brought an unexpected lightness to Nathaniel's mood.

Not that he planned to wait.

Robert approached cautiously with a leather-bound folder. "Mr. Whitmore, your flight departs in fifty minutes. We must leave now to make boarding."

"Let's go." Nathaniel strode from his office, his steps unusually buoyant for someone supposedly dreading a divorce.

Robert hid a knowing smile.

Ever since Evelyn stormed out of the car yesterday, Nathaniel had been in a foul mood. Robert had braced for chaos today - the day his boss would finally end his marriage.

Yet Nathaniel had buried himself in work all morning. And now this little charade...

Robert had overheard enough to understand. Evelyn thought she was running late, while Nathaniel had never intended to show up at all.

It was like watching a wolf toy with a lamb.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's taxi pulled up to the courthouse. No sign of Nathaniel.

She checked the parking lot - his signature black Bentley was nowhere to be seen.

Where was he?

Her call went straight to voicemail. "The number you're dialing is currently unavailable..."

Evelyn stood frozen on the courthouse steps. Had he forgotten? After three years of demanding this divorce?

She'd been crystal clear on the phone. How could he just... not show up?

For thirty agonizing minutes, she paced outside the courthouse like a jilted bride. Each unanswered call fueled her frustration.

Finally, she fired off a text: "Nathaniel Whitmore, what's your game? Changed your mind about divorcing? Could it be you've actually fallen for me?"

The words were designed to prick his notorious pride. If nothing else, maybe they'd force an explanation for his no-show.
###Chapter 354

Evelyn had just set her phone aside when Sophia's message notification popped up.

"Breaking News: Renowned Designer Evelyn Carter Romantically Linked to Entrepreneurial Campus Heartthrob."

Her breath hitched at the headline. What in the world?

She tapped the link. A photo filled the screen—Jonathan Reeves on one knee in a sea of flowers, surrounded by flickering candles, while Evelyn stood with her head bowed, as if overcome with shyness.

Her pulse spiked instantly.

Worse, the article spun an elaborate tale of their long-standing mutual affection, claiming she'd turned down a prestigious corporate offer just to join his studio.

It read like some cheesy romance novel.

Disgust coiled in her stomach.

Evelyn immediately called Sophia. "Who posted this garbage in the campus forum? It's complete fiction! I never had feelings for Jonathan! And that corporate offer? I rejected it for Nathaniel!"

Not for him.

"Evelyn, I know," Sophia said. "That's why I sent it. We need to shut this down before it spreads. I'll check with the Journalism Department to trace the source."

"Fine. I'll deal with Jonathan directly." She hung up and dialed his number.

He answered on the second ring. "Evelyn, what can I do for you?"

"Where are you right now?"

"At the studio."

"I'm coming over. We need to talk." She hailed a cab, her grip on her phone tightening.

During the ride, she watched the article's engagement skyrocket. Strangers flooded the comments with congratulatory messages, clueless about the truth.

Who was behind this? Jonathan himself?

Evelyn swiped open an encrypted file, lines of code flooding her screen. She hacked into the campus server, tracing the poster’s IP address.

Phones weren’t as efficient as laptops. It took longer than usual.

By the time the cab reached Oak Street, the results loaded.

The IP matched the studio’s location.

Ice flooded her veins.

So it was him.

Was he truly this delusional? Had she not been clear enough? Or was he just selectively deaf?

The moment she stepped into the studio, confetti exploded around her.

Her head jerked up as colorful shreds rained down. At the end of the path stood Jonathan, cradling a massive bouquet of red roses.

Right then, she decided red roses were officially her least favorite flower.

Her coworkers erupted into squeals.

Jonathan beamed as he approached. "Our moment got interrupted yesterday, but today, nothing will stop us."

He dropped to one knee. "Evelyn, I’m in love with you. It took me a while to realize it, but I’m done hiding it."

As roses dominated her vision, she inhaled sharply. "Jonathan, I already told you—I don’t feel the same."

"Stop lying to yourself," he said, undeterred. "So what if you’re divorced? It doesn’t matter to me. You don’t have to be ashamed—I don’t care about your past!"

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists.

It took every ounce of self-control not to unleash a storm of curses.
###Chapter 355

Evelyn Carter had lived long enough to witness many things, but never had she encountered such breathtaking narcissism!

She drew a sharp breath, leveling Jonathan Reeves with her most serious gaze. "My divorce status doesn't define me. You're projecting your own insecurities, Jonathan."

Who would have guessed this man was so deeply in love with himself?

"Excellent! I'm glad we're on the same page." He thrust the bouquet forward with unshakable confidence. "These are for you."

The roses in her hands felt like burning coals. Evelyn debated whether to unleash her full vocabulary on him.

Around them, coworkers erupted in cheers. "Say yes! Say yes!"

Her patience snapped like a frayed thread. Offending him be damned - clarity was overdue.

When Evelyn accepted the flowers, the office erupted while Jonathan's smirk widened.

Of course she'd yield. A divorced woman should be grateful for his attention.

Then came the decisive thud of roses hitting marble floors. The room plunged into silence.

Jonathan's face froze. "Explain yourself, Evelyn." This wasn't part of his script.

"Actions convey what words cannot." Her voice remained ice-calm. "Jonathan, incompatibility has nothing to do with my past. I simply don't like you - not now, not ever."

The studio head's ego visibly crumbled before his staff.

A nervous colleague broke the silence. "Evelyn, you turned down major firms after winning first prize. Wasn't this studio choice about him?"

"Absolutely," another chimed in. "We've seen your chemistry. There's no shame in admitting feelings."

Evelyn's response cut through the murmurs. "I chose flexible hours - weekends only so I could attend classes. That's all."

Jonathan's jaw tightened. "My office. Now."

She followed, relieved to escape the spectacle. His wounded pride needed privacy.

The moment the door closed, she spoke first. "I apologize for the scene."

"Save it." His laugh held no humor. "What exactly disqualifies me? I've been campus royalty since freshman year."

His resume of admirers was indeed impressive. Jonathan Reeves only pursued women who could elevate his status.

His sole college relationship ended when his heiress girlfriend's family shipped her abroad.
###Chapter 356

Jonathan Reeves had always been haunted by the memory of how his ex's family looked down on his humble beginnings. That rejection had fueled his ambition to build his own successful studio from scratch.

Now that his business was thriving, he secretly hoped they would regret underestimating him.

Evelyn Carter seemed like the perfect choice—she came from a powerful family with devoted brothers. Since she was divorced, he assumed she wouldn’t have many options left.

Jonathan was confident, charming, and successful. He had no doubt she would eventually fall for him.

But what if Evelyn was just like his ex? Another gold-digger who judged him for his past?

Evelyn sighed, deciding to lay the truth bare. "Jonathan, it's not about you. You can't force feelings."

She hesitated before adding, "Besides, technically, I'm still married. My divorce isn't finalized. We're just... not compatible in any way."

If she didn’t make herself clear now, he would keep misunderstanding.

But Jonathan didn’t take the rejection at face value. His mind raced—was she turning him down because she wasn’t officially divorced yet?

If that was the case, he still had a chance.

With a dramatic, heartfelt declaration, he insisted, "Evelyn, I can wait. It’s okay."

Marrying her would bring him countless benefits—connections, status, influence. He had already calculated every advantage.

A little patience was nothing compared to what he stood to gain. He could use this time to prove his devotion to her brothers.

Evelyn’s patience snapped. "You’re not listening, Jonathan. I don’t like you. Which part of that don’t you understand?"

Then she dropped the bomb. "And I saw you at La Belle Étoile with Mrs. Reeves and some young socialite. You gave her the same roses. That was a setup, wasn’t it?"

His expression faltered. He hadn’t expected her to witness that.

Panicking, he scrambled for an excuse. "Evelyn, I thought it was just dinner with my mother! I had no idea she—"

Evelyn cut him off, pulling out her phone. "Then explain this article."

Jonathan paled. "I just found out about it! Someone must have leaked it. If it bothers you, I’ll clarify everything. I won’t let this affect you."

She wasn’t buying it. "How long are you going to keep lying? You released that article yourself."

He stiffened. "What? No! Why would I—"

Evelyn pointed at his computer. "The IP address traces back to your device. Check your browser history if you don’t believe me."

The revelation stunned him. He hadn’t anticipated her digging that deep.

Desperate, he switched tactics. "Evelyn, I only did it because I care about you! I wanted to show you how serious I am—that your past doesn’t matter to me. I was going to delete it after hearing how you felt!"

But Evelyn had already seen through him. The game was over.
###Chapter 357

"Then delete it. Right now." Evelyn's voice was ice-cold, her tone leaving no room for argument. The demand caught Jonathan completely off guard.

For a long moment, they simply stared at each other, tension thick in the air. Then, with a reluctant sigh, he turned to his computer and pulled up the campus website.

The article had gone viral overnight. If it stayed up any longer, the scandal would spread beyond the university.

Jonathan hesitated. If the public caught wind of his involvement with Evelyn, it could actually help his business.

Ever since she started working at his studio, things had taken a dramatic turn for the better. Their projects were thriving, their reputation soaring.

If they got married—if she stayed—they could take this to unimaginable heights.

But under her unwavering gaze, he deleted the article.

He looked up quickly, his expression pleading. "It's gone. See? I—I wasn’t thinking straight. I messed up. Don’t be angry."

Evelyn refreshed the page. The article had vanished.

A quiet exhale escaped her before she met his eyes again. "Jonathan, after today, I think it’s best if I quit."

His face fell. "No, Evelyn—please. I was wrong. You don’t have to leave."

"I don’t want to be here anymore." Her voice was firm, final. Staying no longer felt right.

She continued calmly, "Since I was never an official employee, I won’t bother with a resignation letter. Consider this my notice. I’ll figure things out after graduation."

Jonathan’s expression twisted with regret. "Evelyn, I know you’re upset. But this position will always be open for you. You can come back anytime—after graduation, whenever. You’re family here."

"We’ll see." She didn’t want to linger. "I should go."

Without another word, she returned to her desk, packed her belongings, and handed off her remaining projects to her colleagues.

One of them, Sophia, hesitated before asking, "Evelyn… are you really leaving?"

"Yes. I was always going to. I only stayed this long to finish my assignments." She offered a small, tired smile. "If you need anything, you know where to find me."

Then she walked out, the studio door closing behind her with a quiet click.

The moment she stepped outside, the weight on her chest lifted.

Evelyn headed straight for the campus library, where Sophia intercepted her, furious. "Jonathan crossed a line! How could he spread rumors like that?"

Her hands clenched into fists. "You should ruin him for this, Evelyn. Don’t let him get away with it!"

Evelyn shook her head. "If I fight back, it’ll only blow up worse. And in scandals like this, women always lose."

She sighed. "Jonathan has too much influence here. This is the best outcome we could hope for."

Sophia stared at her, stunned. "Evelyn… you’ve changed. That’s—that’s actually really mature of you."

Evelyn chuckled dryly. "Is that a compliment?"

This wasn’t her first time being dragged into ugly rumors.

At first, she had been furious.

But Nathaniel had taught her a lot—about the law, about strategy, about picking her battles.

And this?

This wasn’t a battle worth fighting.
###Chapter 358

Evelyn had learned much from Andrew.

She admired her brothers deeply, each possessing unique talents of their own.

That was precisely why she traced the IP address when the scandalous article about Jonathan surfaced. She hadn’t sought Sebastian’s help.

Drawing from the legal knowledge Andrew had imparted to her, Evelyn chose to let the matter go after the article was taken down.

Sophia, however, was still fuming. "Who does he think he is? Why must you be the one to suffer for his delusions? I never pegged him for such a narcissist! Something’s not right here. Just be careful."

"I know." With her six brothers backing her, nothing about this situation intimidated her.

Yet, there was one thing Evelyn overlooked—deleting the article wouldn’t erase the digital footprints.

Soon, the rumor reached Theodore Winslow’s ears. The revelation sent shockwaves through him. "Didn’t I instruct you to withdraw all investment support for Jonathan’s studio?"

"Add this to the list—pull all his promotional materials and ban him from setting foot on campus!"

A man without principles would only tarnish the college’s reputation. Theodore had never imagined Jonathan to be the type who would leech off his partner, let alone make such a disgraceful choice.

Jonathan should have known his place—not daring to set his sights on Nathaniel Whitmore’s wife!

Theodore immediately contacted Nathaniel, hoping to clarify the situation. But it was Robert who answered the call.

Still, Theodore pressed on. "We’ve scrubbed every trace of that article and forbidden students from discussing it. We hope Mr. Whitmore won’t take offense. We condemn Jonathan’s shameful actions."

Robert acknowledged the issue and launched an investigation. The findings left him stunned—multiple times.

Jonathan truly had no idea what he was provoking. First, he had confessed to Evelyn right in front of Nathaniel. Now, he was spreading these rumors himself!

Nathaniel appeared after concluding a meeting with a high-profile client. He shot Robert a questioning glance. "What is it?"

"Mr. Winslow called. It’s about Mrs. Whitmore. Would you like the details?" Robert felt compelled to ask for confirmation.

After all, Nathaniel had deliberately avoided finalizing the divorce by personally handling a business trip to a nearby city.

Nathaniel loosened his tie and strode toward the balcony. "Go on. What happened to her at the university this time?"

"See for yourself first." Robert handed him the tablet.

Though the article had been deleted, someone had captured a screenshot.

Robert could practically feel the air chill as Nathaniel read the contents. "Did Jonathan establish his studio using the university’s resources?"

"According to the reports, yes. He’s been benefiting from them."

"Speak to Mr. Winslow. You know what needs to be done, don’t you?" Nathaniel’s tone turned icy.

Nathaniel was never one to forgive easily.

Jonathan was insignificant in Nathaniel’s eyes, but his relentless pursuit of Evelyn was unacceptable. No self-respecting man would tolerate it.

Nathaniel added coldly, "Send men to break his legs. Warn him to stay away from my wife."
###Chapter 359

Nathaniel's glacial stare cut through Robert like a blade. Someone needed to put Jonathan in his place before he dared to bother Evelyn again. Shattering his kneecaps seemed like an appropriate reminder.

Clearing his throat, Nathaniel shifted uncomfortably. "What about Evelyn?"

"Mrs. Whitmore? Which aspect would you like to know about, sir?" Robert replied cautiously.

"Is this all your intelligence network gathered? She must have seen the news. Didn't she react at all?" Nathaniel distinctly remembered Evelyn's distaste for Jonathan.

The question put Robert in an impossible position. "We're currently overseas, Mr. Whitmore. I'm not her shadow. How could I possibly track her every move?"

Nathaniel's ominous silence forced him to continue. "Perhaps you could... ask her directly?"

A cold smirk twisted Nathaniel's lips. "Consider your quarterly bonus forfeited."

If direct communication were an option, he wouldn't be interrogating his assistant.

Robert's jaw dropped at the financial blow. What cosmic injustice had he committed to deserve this?

Nathaniel scrolled through his phone with deliberate precision, finally landing on Evelyn's Instagram profile.

Her latest post from this morning glared back at him: "Broken promises? The lowest form of human existence."

His eyes narrowed to dangerous slits. That barb was undoubtedly aimed at him.

When had he ever broken a promise?

With swift fingers, he fired back a comment: "Chronic tardiness? The pinnacle of disrespect."

The moment his comment posted, Evelyn shared a new photo: "Golden hour transforms the university into pure magic."

Nathaniel found himself captivated by the sunset-drenched campus in her photograph, the warm hues bleeding across his screen.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's phone vibrated with Nathaniel's notification. "Chronic tardiness? The pinnacle of disrespect."

Her grip tightened around her phone. The audacity!

She had valid reasons! Her delay wasn't intentional, and she'd raced to the courthouse the moment she could!

If he was so desperate for their divorce, why couldn't he spare one miserable hour?

White-hot fury surged through her veins. Before rationality could intervene, Evelyn stabbed Nathaniel's contact with her finger.

Nathaniel's lips curved at the caller ID. Her immediate reaction betrayed her simmering rage.

He answered with calculated calm. "Evelyn."

Her seething voice crackled through the speaker. "Nathaniel Whitmore, explain yourself!"

"It's self-explanatory." His tone remained infuriatingly composed.

"Weren't you the one clawing at the gates for this divorce? You've waited years! What's one more hour?" This was the part she couldn't comprehend.

Nathaniel's eyelid twitched imperceptibly. "I could have waited indefinitely. But commercial flights operate on schedules. I had a transatlantic meeting that couldn't be postponed."

Evelyn nearly choked. "You're abroad? Not in Jefferson City?"

"Obviously. Anything else?"

"When are you returning?" The question escaped before she could stop it.

He knew precisely why she asked.

"Undetermined. Depends on negotiations." He deliberately kept it vague.

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. "Contact me upon your return. We'll reschedule our courthouse appointment."

The finality of her words struck him harder than anticipated. His gaze dropped as he offered a noncommittal hum in response.
###Chapter 360

Evelyn ended the call, mentally cursing Nathaniel for the hundredth time.

She hadn't anticipated his sudden business trip today—the perfect excuse for why he couldn't wait for her.

Her fingers brushed over the gentle curve of her abdomen, where two tiny heartbeats pulsed beneath her skin.

Eleanor had undergone surgery just days ago, right when Penelope had been fishing for information, probing to confirm Evelyn's pregnancy.

Though Evelyn had managed to deflect her suspicions, who knew what reckless scheme Penelope might attempt next?

All Evelyn could do was hope Penelope would come to her senses.

Just then, her phone buzzed.

"Evelyn, I'm here!"

A small smile tugged at her lips. No matter what Penelope plotted, there was always another path—Bern City awaited, a fresh start just within reach.

"On my way," she typed back.

Christopher glanced at his phone, grinning at Julian. "Evelyn's coming. Never picked my sister up from school before. Think she’ll like the gift?"

Julian’s gaze flicked to the elaborately wrapped box in the backseat. He stayed silent.

He wanted to remind Christopher that Evelyn wasn’t a child anymore, but his protests had fallen on deaf ears during the drive.

With a resigned sigh, Julian stepped out of the car.

Out of sight, out of mind.

Then he froze.

A familiar figure stood near the gates—Jonathan Reeves.

Julian’s eyes narrowed at the bouquet of red roses in Jonathan’s hands. Were those for Evelyn?

Jonathan’s infatuation was no secret. He’d been hovering around Evelyn, offering help at every turn.

If not for Jonathan’s intervention during Evelyn’s kidnapping, Julian would’ve already warned him to stay away.

Jonathan, pacing restlessly, suddenly stiffened, sensing a sharp gaze on him.

His head snapped up—and locked eyes with Julian.

A spark of hope lit in Jonathan’s expression. If he couldn’t win Evelyn’s heart directly, maybe winning over her brothers was the next best thing?

Without hesitation, he strode forward. "Mr. Montgomery! Here to pick up Evelyn?"

Julian responded with a noncommittal hum. "And you? Those roses for your girlfriend?"

Jonathan rubbed the back of his neck, feigning bashfulness. "Actually, they’re for Evelyn. Didn’t expect to run into you today. Might as well be honest—I’ve liked her for a long time."

He straightened, voice earnest. "I want to give her the world. Take care of her forever. I hope you’ll support us."

Julian’s jaw tightened. Every instinct screamed at him to knock that hopeful look off Jonathan’s face.

Then Christopher’s icy voice cut in.

"Forever?"

A moment ago, Christopher had been buzzing with excitement about surprising Evelyn. Now?

His expression darkened.

He’d made plenty of empty promises himself—but never kept a single one.

Christopher knew men like Jonathan all too well.

Jonathan blinked at the newcomer, then extended a hand. "You must be another brother! Nice to meet you. I’m serious about Evelyn. I will take care of her."

Christopher scoffed. "Oh? And how? You making seven figures a year?"
###Chapter 361

Christopher dropped the bombshell question right at their first meeting. It completely blindsided Jonathan.

The unexpected interrogation left him speechless for a moment.

He fumbled for words before answering, "I own a creative agency. Things are stable currently, though my annual income hasn't reached that benchmark yet. But I'm confident I'll achieve that goal soon."

With the Montgomery brothers' potential investment, hitting seven figures would be effortless.

Christopher arched an eyebrow, his lips curling in amusement. "Soon? Who exactly are you making these empty pledges to, man? You can approach my sister after you've actually accomplished something. Right now, you're not even in the running."

His next words cut like a knife. "How dare you confess to her when you can't meet basic standards?" The brutal honesty stung.

Flustered, Jonathan turned to Julian. "My feelings for Evelyn are genuine. I'd lay down my life for her. I proved that during her kidnapping incident."

"Money isn't everything - sincerity matters more. As her brothers, surely you want her to marry for love, not financial status?" His voice carried desperate conviction.

Christopher shot Julian a questioning look. "This guy helped during that situation?"

Julian gave a confirming nod. "Yes, during the abduction. He owns the agency where Evelyn worked."

Christopher's piercing gaze returned to Jonathan. "Ah, so it was you."

Jonathan felt a surge of relief for having taken that injury. "Yes, that was me. When Evelyn's in danger, I'll pay any price - even my life."

"We do owe you for that," Julian admitted, visibly softening.

But Christopher remained unmoved. "Don't play games with me. You charged in recklessly and got knocked out instantly. They still took Evelyn. Could you have actually rescued her?" His counterattack was merciless.

Biting back his irritation, Jonathan maintained composure. "It was an ambush. I never expected such bold criminal activity in the city center."

"I'll take self-defense training to protect Evelyn properly. That mistake won't happen again!" His promise rang with determination.

Christopher scoffed openly. "More empty words. You should quit business altogether. Someone who specializes in broken promises has no place in entrepreneurship." The contempt was palpable.

He continued, looking down his nose at Jonathan. "Know why you keep making pledges you can't keep? Because you lack the capability to fulfill them. This act won't work on us."

Cold sweat broke across Jonathan's brow. Under Christopher's penetrating stare, he felt his hidden cowardice exposed, unable to meet those discerning eyes.

It was as if the man could see straight through his carefully constructed facade!

Noticing Christopher's excessive harshness, Julian cleared his throat. "That's enough. We can't disregard Jonathan's assistance during the crisis."

Hope flickered in Jonathan's eyes again. "While my help was limited, my feelings for Evelyn are completely real."

"Your contribution was indeed minor, but your intentions were good. That said," Julian conceded, "my brother makes a valid point."

"Jonathan, if you're serious about Evelyn, demonstrate real commitment, not hollow promises. Actions speak louder than words," Julian concluded firmly.

Jonathan nodded vigorously. "Understood. I'll prove myself - you have my word."

At that precise moment, Evelyn arrived at the gates. Her steps faltered when she spotted the trio - and Jonathan's unexpected presence. Her expression darkened, wary of whatever scheme he might be plotting now.

Christopher waved casually. "Evelyn! Over here!"

As she approached, her gaze landed on the ostentatious bouquet of red roses. A wave of revulsion washed over her.
###Chapter 362

Jonathan rushed toward Evelyn before she could react. "Evelyn, please accept this. A peace offering. I hope you'll forgive me."

Her brows knitted together. "Jonathan, didn't I make myself perfectly clear? I'm not interested in you."

It baffled her why he refused to take no for an answer.

"Evelyn, I've already discussed this with your brothers. They understand where I'm coming from. I'll prove to them that I'm the man who can make you happy," he insisted, thrusting the bouquet of roses toward her.

Evelyn shot Julian a disbelieving look. Had her brothers actually taken Jonathan's side?

Irritated, Christopher stepped forward and yanked the flowers from Jonathan's grasp. "Bullshit. When exactly did we agree with anything you said? Care to explain?"

Jonathan swallowed hard before turning to Julian. "Didn't I clarify everything earlier?"

Uncomfortable, Julian crossed his arms. "Jonathan, I don't interfere in my sister's love life. She's free to choose whoever she wants. But she's made it crystal clear—she's not into you."

"That's fine. I can wait. I'll try harder." Jonathan's voice trembled with desperation.

Julian suddenly gripped Jonathan's shoulder. "She said no. What you're doing is harassment."

Christopher tossed the roses to the ground and crushed them under his shoe. "Jonathan, let me make this clear—don't even think about pursuing someone out of your league."

"That goes for Evelyn. Drop whatever scheme you're plotting and get lost. She won't fall for it." As someone who had played the field, Christopher recognized manipulation when he saw it.

He could tell from the start that Jonathan had ulterior motives. There was no way he'd let Evelyn end up with someone like him.

Initially, Christopher had worried Evelyn might be swayed by Jonathan's shallow tactics. How could he stop it if that happened?

Thankfully, Evelyn saw right through Jonathan from the beginning.

Defeated, Jonathan finally slunk away.

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "What exactly did he tell you guys?"

"Nothing important, just a load of nonsense. Thank God you're sharp enough to see through that guy's act," Christopher dismissed with a wave.

"It's... complicated." Evelyn didn't know where to begin.

"Let's get in the car first. We have plenty of time to talk," Julian suggested.

Once inside, Christopher spoke up. "Evelyn, listen to me—never fall for cheap tricks like that. Got it?"

She frowned. "Cheap tricks?"

"Exactly. Guys like Jonathan are all talk—empty promises, grand gestures, acting like they'll move mountains for you."

"Buying flowers? Bringing breakfast every morning? Basic manipulation. They'll shower you with attention, make you feel special. Sounds romantic, right? But do you think any of it's real?"

Evelyn nodded. "That does sound like Jonathan."

Though, he'd never gone that far for her before.

Christopher continued, "It's all a game. Don't give in to persistent men like that. They have nothing substantial to offer, so they resort to love-bombing."

"It costs them nothing but time. Be careful with men like that. Don't be fooled."

Evelyn fell silent for a moment before smirking. "Christopher, are you speaking from experience?"
###Chapter 363

Evelyn had seen Christopher in his playboy mode before at the hotel.

Christopher was speechless for a moment. He cleared his throat before responding. "I know exactly how men like that operate because I used to be one. As for that Jonathan or Phoenix guy, I could tell immediately he was bad news."

In the past, Evelyn would have argued with him.

But her opinion of Jonathan had shifted recently, especially after discovering he had spread false rumors about them himself. Only then did she realize his true nature.

He had never been a good person. He had just hidden it well—too well—until now.

After a brief pause, she admitted, "I’ve come to realize he’s not the same Jonathan I thought I knew."

Julian, who had been silent until now, finally spoke up. "Has he been bothering you lately, Evelyn? If you don’t like him, just tell him directly."

"I’ve told him multiple times, but he keeps misunderstanding. That’s why he won’t give up. And today, I found out he posted an article on the campus website claiming we were dating."

Christopher’s expression darkened. "Let’s go back. That bastard can’t have gone far. I’ll knock his teeth out today."

Julian was equally furious. "I’ll call Nathaniel. He’s an expert in handling this kind of thing."

"It’s fine, Julian. I already took care of it. I picked up a few tricks from Nathaniel before. Tracing an IP address isn’t hard."

Julian remembered when she had hacked into Alexander’s company system. Finding an IP was child’s play for her, but he was still seething.

A storm brewed in his eyes. "When he saved you, I thought maybe he was the right one for you."

"Who knew he’d turn out to be this shameless? Using underhanded tricks to force you? Christopher’s right—he’s all talk. Don’t give in to a man who pesters you. They’re worthless."

She nodded. "I know. He’s been like this for a while, but I don’t feel the same way. You can’t force feelings, can you?"

"Evelyn, if someone’s pursuing you, do you know how to tell if they’re sincere?" Christopher still looked concerned.

Curious, she tilted her head. "How?"

If casual conversations and bringing her breakfast didn’t count, what kind of effort could be considered genuine?

He answered seriously, "First, he needs a solid background. Forget about him unless he makes at least a million a year. Second, he has to be good-looking. And third, he has to come from a loving family."

She blinked in disbelief. "I don’t think those things matter as long as two people love each other."

"Evelyn, oh Evelyn." He pressed a hand to his forehead. "You’re too naïve about love. Do you have any idea how calculating men are when it comes to relationships?"

He continued, frustration lacing his words, "All men want from their girlfriends is beauty and sex. The rest? They couldn’t care less."

"But when it comes to marriage? They’re as meticulous as job hunting. The woman has to be beautiful, have a perfect body, financial stability, and a powerful family."

"Men are mercenaries. Every last one of them."

Julian coughed. "Speak for yourself. I’m an exception."
###Chapter 364

Christopher scoffed. "Hey, you're just slightly better than the average guy out there. Barely meeting the minimum standards of what makes a decent man."

"But men like that are rare, especially when you factor in high social status. It's practically impossible to find them."

Julian nodded solemnly and turned to Evelyn. "Chris is a playboy—well, no. I mean, a love expert. You should listen to his advice. Don't let men toy with your heart."

Evelyn used to dream of a fairytale romance. Back when everyone doubted whether Nathaniel would survive his injuries, she had been willing to marry him, even if it meant becoming a widow!

Looking back now, she wanted to slap some sense into her past self. Love had blinded her completely.

Christopher continued his lecture. "Never sacrifice your future for so-called 'love.' And never give up your career for a man."

"Most importantly, never pity a man. The moment you do, that’s when your suffering begins."

Evelyn thought of Nathaniel and nodded. "True."

If she hadn’t taken pity on him when he was injured, she wouldn’t have impulsively married him.

"Above all, Evelyn, no matter how much you like a man, don’t pour all your energy into him. You have your own life. Men are naturally rebellious creatures."

"The more you focus on yourself and the more independent you are, the more they’ll chase after you."

"I agree."

A person should never lose themselves for a man.

For three years as "Mrs. Whitmore," Nathaniel had been her entire world. And yet, in the end, she was cast aside like nothing.

She had learned that lesson the hard way.

Julian noticed her somber expression and remembered her marriage to Nathaniel.

Hadn’t she been the perfect example of love-blind devotion? She had dropped out of school for three years just to be a housewife.

She had checked every box on the list of what not to do.

Julian quickly lightened the mood. "Evelyn, don’t take Chris too seriously. Just filter out whatever doesn’t apply to you."

Christopher shot back, "What do you mean, don’t take me seriously? I’m giving her life-saving advice. There are way too many scheming men out there these days."

"We met Jonathan today. What if she runs into Alexander or Donovan next?"

Evelyn gave an awkward smile. Despite being a playboy himself, Christopher had a point. If she had known him earlier, she never would have married Nathaniel.

Nathaniel would’ve survived just fine without her, anyway.

Christopher rambled on about relationships—how to win a man’s heart, how to choose the right one, how to keep him loyal.

There was so much to absorb. She had no idea love could be this complicated!

He took a sip of water. "Evelyn, schools teach women to be independent and hardworking, but not how to navigate relationships. And yet, it’s one of the most important subjects in life."

"Choosing the wrong man is like buying the wrong house. The moment you realize your mistake, it’s already too late."

Evelyn gave him a thumbs-up. "Chris, you should write a book."

They returned home and had dinner together. Later, she even jotted down notes from Christopher’s relationship lessons—a reminder to never let love blind her again.

The next morning, her phone’s ringing jolted her awake.

She answered groggily. "Hello? Who is this?"

"Evelyn, Jonathan’s in trouble!"
###Chapter 365

Evelyn's head cleared instantly at Judith's words. A prickle of suspicion ran down her spine. "What happened to Jonathan?"

"He's injured—badly. They rushed him to the emergency room. Evelyn, I'm all alone here. This hospital is unfamiliar, and I don't know who else to call. Please, come quickly."

"Mrs. Reeves, don't panic. I'm on my way."

After throwing on her coat, Evelyn headed for the door—only for Margaret to intercept her.

"At least eat something before you go, dear. It's barely past dawn."

Evelyn snatched a piece of toast, barely pausing as she shoved it into her mouth.

The cab ride to the hospital felt endless. When she arrived, she dialed Judith immediately. "I'm here. Are you still in the emergency ward?"

"No, we've been moved. Room 365."

Evelyn frowned. Hadn't Judith said the injuries were life-threatening? How had he been transferred so quickly?

She pushed open the door to find Jonathan propped against the headboard, one leg encased in plaster. His face was a mess of bruises and swelling—clearly, someone had worked him over.

Her stomach twisted. Had Christopher or Julian done this?

Just yesterday, when she'd mentioned Jonathan's behavior, Christopher had threatened to "break his legs." She'd talked him down—or so she thought. Yet here was Jonathan, hospitalized with exactly that injury.

Guilt gnawed at her. Stepping inside, she kept her voice steady. "Jonathan, what happened?"

His reaction was immediate—a flinch, eyes widening in fear. He tried to speak, but the bandages around his jaw muffled the words.

Judith offered Evelyn a strained smile. "Thank God you're here. When I first saw him, he was covered in blood. I thought—" Her voice broke. "But the doctors say it's not as bad as it looks."

Evelyn nodded. "Thank goodness. But how did this happen?"

She needed answers. Assault was a serious crime.

Judith's composure shattered. "He was attacked! Jonathan never makes enemies—his business is clean, he helps people! Who would do this?" She gripped Evelyn's arm. "Do you know if he's crossed anyone?"

Evelyn froze.

"I... I don't think so. He's always been well-liked."

It was true—he'd been perfectly fine yesterday. Judith's confusion mirrored her own.

"I've called the police," Judith said. "They'll be here soon."

Evelyn's pulse jumped. "The police?"

"Yes. Any minute now."

She turned to Jonathan. "Do you remember who did this? The officers will need details."

Jonathan shrank back, trembling.

Judith handed him a notepad. "If talking hurts, write it down."

His fingers hovered over the paper, hesitating. The pen shook in his grip.
###Chapter 366

The night stretched endlessly for Jonathan. Humiliation and rage twisted inside him like twin serpents.

Christopher Montgomery's brutal exposure still burned in his memory.

He'd been strategizing how to win Evelyn back. Women always responded to sweet words and grand gestures.

But fate had other plans. Rough hands shoved him into an unmarked van before he'd taken ten steps. The world went black.

This wasn't supposed to happen outside crime dramas. Yet here he was, tasting real terror for the first time.

His screams echoed unanswered in the concrete cell. Each desperate plea earned him another blow until his body became a canvas of pain.

When the masked figure finally spoke, Jonathan's blood turned to ice. "Stay away from his wife. Next time, we take more than just your pride."

He woke on cold pavement, his broken body discovered by morning joggers. The hospital sheets offered no comfort.

Every time he closed his eyes, he relived that darkness. The nightmares left him shaking, sheets soaked with sweat.

The mystery tormented him. Whose wife? He'd designed homes for elite families, mingled with society wives.

That aging socialite who'd pursued him last spring? Impossible - he'd rejected her advances immediately.

Then Evelyn walked in, and realization struck like lightning. Her ex-husband Nathaniel Whitmore.

The pieces fit perfectly. Only a powerful man like Nathaniel would orchestrate such brutality.

But weren't they finalizing their divorce? Rumors swirled about Nathaniel's shady business dealings.

Jonathan studied Evelyn with new wariness. If Nathaniel was behind this, pursuing her meant signing his death warrant.

Evelyn shifted under his gaze. Did he suspect Christopher's involvement?

She could practically hear her cousin's threat: "Touch my cousin again, and I'll break every bone in your body."

The timing was too perfect. Even a child could connect the dots.

Judith's impatient voice cut through the tension. "Jonathan, stop daydreaming! Write your statement!"

"List every suspect," she pressed. "Help the police do their job."

Evelyn nodded. "Yes, Jonathan. Tell them everything."

When Judith rushed out to take a call, silence swallowed the hospital room.

Jonathan's pen scratched across paper: "Evelyn, why? What did I do to deserve this?"

Her apology tumbled out. "Christopher went too far protecting me. They saw those rumors you spread online."

Jonathan's eyes widened. Not Nathaniel? Her own family had done this?

The revelation changed everything.
###Chapter 367

Evelyn Carter's guilt was palpable as she studied Jonathan Reeves' battered face. The bruises and swelling made his expression unreadable, and after several failed attempts to decipher it, she gave up with a quiet sigh.

Hesitantly, she spoke. "Jonathan, don't worry. I'll cover all the medical costs. This was just a misunderstanding—please don't hold my brother accountable."

If Christopher Montgomery were prosecuted for the assault, the consequences would be severe. She couldn’t bear the thought of him facing legal trouble because of her.

Judith Reeves, Jonathan’s mother, was another concern. Evelyn knew Judith wouldn’t let this slide. She was the type to pursue justice—or vengeance—relentlessly.

Jonathan frowned, lost in thought. Had he misheard his attackers? He distinctly remembered them warning him to stay away from someone’s wife. But what if they had actually said "sister"? The words were similar enough to confuse in the heat of the moment.

It made more sense this way. Evelyn’s ex-husband was already divorcing her—why would he attack Jonathan over her? But if the culprit was her brother, everything fell into place.

Just then, Judith stormed into the hospital room.

Jonathan quickly flipped his notepad shut, hiding what he’d written. His eyes flicked toward the door, where two police officers followed Judith inside.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted with guilt. Should she warn Christopher first? Or should she contact Andrew immediately, so he could prepare a legal defense?

Her fingers trembled as she discreetly typed a message to Andrew on her phone. "Hypothetically… how many years in prison for intentional assault?"

At least knowing the potential consequences would help her brace for what was coming.

Andrew’s reply was immediate. "Why? Are you in trouble?"

"Just answer the question, Andrew."

"Depends. If you hit someone, no big deal. But if someone hits you? They’re looking at life."

Evelyn almost laughed at his arrogance. Was he serious?

"Really?" she typed skeptically.

"I lie to everyone else, but never to you." As a skilled lawyer, Andrew knew how to twist words—but with Evelyn, his only sister, he was blunt.

Reluctantly, she believed him. At least with Andrew in her corner, she could breathe a little easier.

Her gaze drifted absently to Jonathan, unaware of what he’d scribbled in his notes.

The officers stood after their questioning. "We’ve got a general idea of what happened. We’ll update you if there’s progress in the investigation."

Judith bristled. "How long will that take? Look at his injuries! I want the culprit found now—and I’ll make sure they pay!"

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Judith adored Jonathan—she wouldn’t let this go lightly.

Yet Jonathan reached out, gripping his mother’s wrist and shaking his head.

Judith collapsed against him, tears streaming. "Jonathan, I’ve never even scolded you, let alone let someone hurt you like this. When I find out who did it—I don’t care how old I am, I’ll make them regret it!"
###Chapter 368

Evelyn's heart ached with guilt. She stepped forward and embraced Judith, offering what little comfort she could. "Mrs. Reeves, please don't cry."

"The doctors said they're just minor injuries. He'll recover with some rest."

Judith's voice trembled. "Have you ever seen 'minor injuries' this severe?"

"Mrs. Reeves, I know how hard this is, but you must stay strong. You need to take care of yourself—otherwise, who will look after Jonathan? With your care, he’ll surely get better soon."

It was the only reassurance she could give.

Judith sank onto a nearby stool, clutching Evelyn’s hand as tears streamed down her face. "Evelyn, I don’t know what I’d do without you here. I feel so helpless."

"Don’t worry, Mrs. Reeves. I’ll stay with you and help take care of Jonathan until he’s fully recovered and discharged."

Jonathan watched Evelyn carefully from the bed, gauging her sincerity. When he realized she wasn’t lying, a sly thought crossed his mind.

Just yesterday, he had thought all hope was lost after her brother confronted him outside the university.

Men understood each other too well. One glance was enough to tell him her brother was someone of influence—the kind who would naturally look down on someone like Jonathan, who came from an ordinary background.

But fate had other plans.

Who would’ve thought that after getting beaten up, Evelyn would volunteer to take care of him? This was his chance—his opportunity to get close to her again.

It didn’t matter whether her brother was truly responsible. He would make sure to pin the blame on him anyway. Guilt was a powerful tool, and he intended to use it to his advantage.

He scribbled in his notebook and held it up. "Mom, I’m hungry. I really want your chicken soup."

Judith’s expression softened. "Of course, sweetheart. I’ll go home and make it right away. But who will stay with you while I’m gone?"

Evelyn understood the unspoken request. Without hesitation, she said, "Don’t worry, Mrs. Reeves. I’ll stay with him."

Judith gave her a grateful smile. "You’re so kind, Evelyn. I’ll feel much better knowing you’re here with him. I’ll be back soon."

Once Judith left, Evelyn turned to Jonathan, her expression serious. "What exactly did you tell the police?"

Instead of answering, he handed her his notepad. She skimmed through it and saw that he had only provided basic details—time and place—without naming any suspects.

Then he flipped back to an earlier page, where he had written: "Don’t worry, Evelyn. I won’t tell the police anything."

"Your brother misunderstood me, but I don’t regret anything. There’s nothing wrong with loving someone."

He wasn’t about to waste this second chance.

Women were soft-hearted. If Evelyn ever tried to reject him in the future, he could always use this incident to pressure her.

Between sweet words and veiled threats, he was confident he could win her over.

Evelyn stared at the words, speechless.

Her brother had beaten him up, after all.

For now, she would play along. Once he recovered, she’d see if she could settle this with money.

Meanwhile, news of Jonathan filing a police report reached Nathaniel swiftly.

His lips curled into a cold smirk. "How arrogant. Does he really think he can catch the culprit?"

He had made sure his men left no traces behind.

Robert hesitated before speaking again. "There’s… one more thing."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Go on."

"Mrs. Whitmore went to the hospital. It seems she’s taking care of Jonathan now."
###Chapter 369

Nathaniel froze.

He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Evelyn had gone to the hospital to take care of that man?

His fingers tightened around his tie as he adjusted it, his voice sharp. "How generous of her."

Just after he’d dealt with Jonathan, she rushed to his side like some devoted caretaker.

Was she deliberately provoking him?

Or worse—did she actually have feelings for him?

But she’d sworn she didn’t.

Women. Always lying.

The air in the hotel suite thickened with tension.

Nathaniel looked like he’d been sucker-punched. Robert, standing nearby, didn’t dare breathe too loudly.

He had known Nathaniel would be furious when he reported this.

But if he hadn’t reported it and Nathaniel found out later?

He’d be fired on the spot.

Sometimes, facing the storm head-on was better than waiting for it to drown you.

Robert glanced at his watch, clearing his throat. "Mr. Whitmore, you have the banquet tonight. Hosted by Clement Sallow—the music industry titan."

He hesitated before adding, "He’s been calling repeatedly since he found out you were in town. Seems eager to introduce you to his daughter."

Nathaniel didn’t respond.

Instead, he pulled out his phone, thumb hovering over Evelyn’s contact.

What was he supposed to say?

He pressed call before he could overthink it.

Evelyn was in the middle of peeling an apple for Jonathan when her phone buzzed.

The caller ID flashed: Jerk.

Her cheeks warmed as she muttered, "I need to take this."

She hurried out of the ward, heart pounding.

Why was Nathaniel calling?

Had he returned from his trip?

She swallowed before answering, voice carefully neutral. "Yes?"

His tone was icy. "Evelyn. I didn’t realize you were so charitable."

Her brows furrowed. "What are you talking about?"

"Playing dumb now?" His laugh was bitter. "My assistant just informed me you’re at the hospital, doting on that snake."

"You swore you didn’t like him. Yet the second he’s hurt, you’re right there, playing nurse?"

His voice dripped with something dark—something he didn’t even recognize as jealousy.

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened.

Unbelievable.

She scoffed. "Do you have a problem with that? I don’t like him. But leading him on? That’s just what a maneater like me does, right?"

Nathaniel’s blood pressure spiked.

Just then, the door to his suite opened.

A woman’s voice, smooth and sweet, floated in. "Mr. Whitmore?"

Evelyn heard it.

Her lips curled into a cold smile. "Business trip, huh? And you have the nerve to criticize me?"

She hung up before he could respond.

That voice hadn’t been Victoria’s.

So he’d moved on to someone new already?

Typical.

Men were all the same.

Nathaniel stared at his phone, fury simmering.

Then he turned to the woman at his door, expression glacial.

"I didn’t order room service."
###Chapter 370

Nathaniel's icy response left the woman flustered. "My father ordered me to approach you, Mr. Whitmore. He even provided the hotel key card, expecting me to seduce you. But I can't go through with it - I'd prefer to discuss this matter civilly."

"You're in no position to negotiate," he stated flatly.

His gaze remained fixed on his phone screen displaying the ended call. A muscle twitched in his jaw as irritation simmered beneath his composed exterior.

The mere suggestion of Evelyn being some kept woman infuriated him beyond measure. He mentally catalogued every male associate in her life who'd need... handling.

Meanwhile, Evelyn reentered the hospital room, the unsettling phone conversation still weighing on her.

Jonathan typed slowly on his phone: "Who was that?"

Her fingers hovered over the screen before responding. "My ex-husband."

The revelation struck him like a physical blow, resurrecting memories of his attackers' ominous warnings. Cold sweat beaded along his hairline.

Yet he forced himself to rationalize - surely that violent incident couldn't be connected to Evelyn's former spouse. The timing had to be coincidental.

Sensing the tension, Jonathan wisely refrained from further questions.

Evelyn exhaled quietly in relief. Detailed explanations would have required revealing truths she wasn't prepared to share.

The door swung open as Judith bustled in bearing an overflowing lunch bag. "Jonathan darling, you must be starving! I made all your favorites - including that chicken soup you adore."

The rich aroma made Evelyn's stomach growl audibly. Within moments, the bedside table transformed into a banquet spread - steaming soup, glazed meats, vibrant vegetables. A veritable feast.

"Eat up, son. You too, mother," Jonathan urged graciously before adding, "Evelyn, please join us. You've been tending to him all afternoon."

Pregnancy hunger gnawed at Evelyn with animal intensity. As she reached for a bowl, Judith interjected sharply, "We should pace ourselves, dear. Jonathan needs extra nourishment for his recovery. These are all his special dishes."

Evelyn's hand froze midair, instantly recognizing the passive-aggressive message - she wasn't welcome to partake.

Selecting minimal portions, she forced a smile at Jonathan. "Your mother's right. The patient deserves priority."

With a grateful nod, Jonathan began eating methodically while Evelyn's stomach protested loudly. Desperate, she reached for the soup ladle only to have Judith intercept again.

"That's medicinal broth specifically for Jonathan's injuries," Judith chided. "We healthy folk should show restraint."

A wave of dizziness washed over Evelyn as her blood sugar plummeted. Fighting nausea, she reached for the honey-glazed pork when Judith blocked her again.

"Evelyn dear," came the saccharine tone, "these organic vegetables came straight from the farmers market. So much healthier for women watching their figures."

Evelyn's polite facade finally cracked.

She managed two helpings of rice and vegetables - barely enough to stabilize her shaking hands. Judith's eyes narrowed as she surveyed the empty vegetable dish.

"My word, what an appetite! Most women your age eat like birds," Judith remarked pointedly.

Evelyn stood abruptly. "Mrs. Reeves, would you like me to order you something more substantial?"

Judith's smile didn't reach her eyes. "How thoughtful. I'd adore some lemon-pepper chicken from that bistro down the street."
###Chapter 371

The mention of stir-fried chicken brought back memories of Margaret's cooking for Evelyn. It had been divine.

Suppressing the discomfort swirling inside her, she quickly placed a delivery order before turning to Jonathan. "It's getting late. I should head out."

"So soon? Didn't you just order food? We could share."

"It's fine, Mrs. Reeves. I can eat at home. Besides, I only ordered enough for one." Evelyn struggled to keep her expression neutral.

Judith waved it off. "I don't eat much. Stay and keep me company. There's still plenty of sweet and sour pork left—your favorite. And some soup too. You should finish it."

Her tone was light, as if it were the most natural request. "Patients shouldn't eat leftovers. Consider it a favor."

Evelyn wasn't fooled. She'd nearly collapsed from hunger earlier, and now Judith expected her to eat Jonathan's scraps? Never in a million years.

Without another word, she turned on her heel and left.

Regret gnawed at her. Playing the good Samaritan had backfired spectacularly. If Christopher hadn't roughed Jonathan up, she wouldn't have wasted her afternoon tending to him, only to be treated like an afterthought.

Once alone, Jonathan frowned. "That was too much, Mom."

"Oh, so you can speak? Why stay silent earlier?"

"I was putting on a show. For the police, yes, but mostly for Evelyn. Pity makes her pliable. Easier to ask for favors later."

Judith smirked. "Clever boy. Still, letting her walk away from the chicken soup and pork was a mistake. What if you're still hungry?"

"I like her, but boundaries matter. Once she's ours, she’ll learn to prioritize me. Leftovers? That’s a wife’s duty."

Like mother, like son—neither saw an issue. Still, Jonathan added, "Just don’t push too hard yet."

"Once things are official, we’ll set the rules properly."

Judith wasn’t done. "The hospital’s a trek from home. Cooking for three takes time. Why not have Evelyn handle meals? She can bring them here."

He hesitated. "She won’t agree."

"Leave it to me. I’ll convince her tomorrow. This way, I’ll have more free time while she tends to you. Trust me, I know how to handle women."

Jonathan relaxed. Christopher’s assault had given him leverage. Now, Evelyn owed him care—and maybe more.

His mind raced. Winning her heart meant access to her brothers’ investments. If not, he’d sue Christopher. Either way, he held all the cards.

Closing his eyes, he envisioned it: moving into Evelyn’s home, Judith in tow, living off her family’s wealth.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat in a diner, savoring a bowl of noodles. Clarity returned with each bite.

If Jonathan sued Christopher, she’d need a plan—fast. Negotiating privately meant hefty compensation, but letting it go to court? That risked everything.

She’d have to talk to Andrew. This mess was far from over.
###Chapter 372

Judith Reeves was never an easy woman to handle.

When Evelyn returned home, her eyelids felt like lead weights from exhaustion. She glanced at Margaret.

"I'm craving honey-glazed chicken and pineapple pork tomorrow."

"Of course, dear. I'll get the freshest ingredients at the market. You should invite Christopher over too."

Only then did Evelyn remember Christopher's unusual silence that day. Perhaps guilt was consuming him after what happened with Jonathan.

After a quick shower, she collapsed onto her bed. Nothing could have stopped her from falling asleep—her body demanded rest.

At dawn, her phone's shrill ringtone shattered the silence.

She fumbled for the device. "Hello?"

"Wake up, Evelyn! We're going shopping for Jonathan's recovery meal. At my age, I can't handle these early mornings anymore. Consider this your chance to learn his preferences—"

Evelyn ended the call immediately. 5:03 AM glared from her screen.

Had Judith really called at this ungodly hour just to cook for Jonathan? Absurd!

She silenced her phone, officially resigning from unpaid maid duties. Jonathan's situation didn't concern her anymore.

With Nathaniel involved, Christopher would be fine anyway.

Evelyn burrowed back under the covers, sleeping until sunlight streamed through her curtains. Stretching lazily, she finally felt human again.

Her phone showed seven missed calls from Judith. The woman's persistence knew no bounds.

But Evelyn deserved this break. Pregnancy drained her energy—she couldn't be at everyone's beck and call.

The moment she stepped into the hallway, heavenly aromas from the kitchen made her stomach growl.

"Aunt Margaret, you're a culinary genius!"

"Where's Christopher? Call him over," Margaret suggested while stirring a pot.

Evelyn dialed Christopher's number. The line connected instantly—to a woman's voice.

"Hello?"

Evelyn froze. This wasn't the usual assistant. Had Christopher moved on already?

Remembering last time's embarrassment, she muttered, "Wrong number," and hung up.

If Christopher had female company now, they'd probably spent the night together. Best not to disturb.

"He's swamped with work," Evelyn told Margaret, happily devouring the entire honey-glazed chicken herself later.

Her heart and stomach overflowed with contentment. Nothing compared to good food and peace.

"Evelyn, your appetite's grown remarkably," Margaret observed. "You're practically glowing. Though careful—that belly might make people think you're expecting!"

Evelyn's smile faltered for a millisecond. "Oh, I'm definitely expecting... more chicken and pork!"

Margaret's laughter filled the kitchen.

Post-lunch, Evelyn lounged on the sofa when her phone buzzed—Jonathan this time.

She moved to the balcony. "Jonathan?"

"Don't mind Mother. She means well, always fussing over me."

"I get that. But please ask her to stop calling me. Since I'll never be her daughter-in-law, she needn't train me for the role." Her voice stayed flat.

"What's that supposed to mean? You're not coming to the hospital anymore?" Jonathan's tone sharpened.
###Chapter 373

Evelyn found Jonathan's demanding tone utterly ridiculous.

The apple didn't fall far from the tree—Judith and Jonathan were equally shameless.

Since they had chosen to confront her with such audacity, Evelyn saw no point in continuing the conversation.

She responded coldly, "Jonathan, I owe you nothing. What I did yesterday was the last shred of kindness you'll ever receive from me."

"Evelyn, if it weren’t for your brother, I wouldn’t be lying in this hospital bed. I even kept quiet to the police about who attacked me—for your sake. After everything I’ve sacrificed, can’t you show a little compassion?"

Just then, Judith’s shrill voice cut in. "What? Jonathan, are you saying Evelyn’s brother is responsible for your injuries? Why didn’t you tell me?"

The phone was abruptly shoved back at Evelyn. "Get to the hospital right now, Evelyn Carter. I demand answers, or I’ll have the police arrest your brother!"

"Go ahead." Evelyn ended the call.

Though worry gnawed at her, Nathaniel had assured her everything would be fine.

Surely, he wouldn’t let anything happen to Christopher—they were brothers, after all.

The thought steadied her. That afternoon, she headed to campus for lectures.

She needed to focus on her studies to pass her exams in one go.

Her phone buzzed relentlessly, but she ignored it.

Jonathan’s true colors were finally exposed. If he was using the assault as leverage now, he’d only demand more later.

After some thought, she decided she’d rather he went to the police.

Christopher wasn’t careless—he wouldn’t leave evidence behind. Without proof, Jonathan had no case.

Besides, with Nathaniel, a skilled lawyer, in the family, she had nothing to fear.

During a break, she checked her phone. Missed calls and furious messages from Judith and Jonathan flooded her notifications.

She dismissed them, but an entertainment headline caught her eye:

"Scandal Unfolds: Rising Star Linked to Wealthy Tycoon."

The photo showed the same woman who had been clinging to Julian that night.

Evelyn had assumed there was something between them, but perhaps she’d jumped to conclusions.

Her finger tapped the link before she could stop herself. The singer looked stunning in a sleek black dress.

But the man beside her was only captured from behind.

Evelyn zoomed in. The suit button was unmistakable—she had sewn it herself for Nathaniel.

A bitter smile touched her lips as emotions churned inside her.

First, it was Victoria Sinclair. Now, a famous singer.

Both women matched Nathaniel’s world perfectly.

She had vowed to move on, yet seeing him with someone else still stung.

Her hand drifted to her stomach. "You’re all I have now, my darlings. Let’s forget about that heartless man."
###Chapter 374

The jerk had the nerve to call Evelyn yesterday, taunting her about being a gold-digger. As if he had any right.

Fuming, she sent the picture to Nathaniel. "You're not so innocent either. Who's this backup girl now?"

But after typing it out, she thought it sounded too desperate. Too weak.

So she deleted it.

Instead, she mirrored his cold, clipped style. "Nice."

One word. That was all it took to drip with sarcasm.

People who knew how to cut deep didn’t waste words.

Evelyn tossed her phone aside and forced herself back to her notes.

But focus was impossible.

Her gaze kept flicking to the silent screen, wondering how Nathaniel would react.

Nothing.

Then, finally—a notification.

Her pulse jumped before she could stop it.

But it wasn’t him.

It was Jonathan.

"Evelyn, I still have the recording. The one where you admitted your brother was the real culprit."

Her stomach dropped.

She had said that. In a moment of weakness, she’d confessed.

Her fingers tightened around the phone. "What do you want?"

"Come to the hospital. Let’s talk."

"We have nothing to discuss."

"If you don’t show up, I’ll send this to the police. You really want your brother in jail?"

Her jaw clenched.

Fine.

She grabbed her bag and hailed a cab.

She knew exactly what this was. Blackmail.

But she wasn’t defenseless. If it came down to it, she’d handle the fallout.

The hospital room was too bright.

Jonathan and Judith sat waiting, their expressions smug.

Evelyn didn’t bother with pleasantries. "Get to the point."

Judith’s lip curled. "That attitude won’t help you. If it weren’t for your brother, my son wouldn’t be here!"

Evelyn scoffed. "Mrs. Reeves, let’s be clear—I’ve never had feelings for your son. Not once. And I certainly never led him on. You’re delusional if you thought I’d ever be your daughter-in-law."

Why sugarcoat it? The gloves were off.

Judith’s face turned red. "Then why are you still working for him? Have you no shame?"

"Correction—he begged me to stay. Ask him yourself."

She turned to Jonathan, done with Judith’s dramatics.

But he just smirked.

"Evelyn, you must’ve liked me a little. Otherwise, why take a job at my small studio instead of some big corporation?"

Disgust twisted in her gut.

She’d expected the blackmail.

But this? Pathetic.

"Where’s the recording?" she demanded, cutting straight to the chase. "What’s your game?"
###Chapter 375

Evelyn had no patience for games. Not a single second.

Yet Jonathan gazed at her with adoration. "Evelyn, you're dodging my question."

Disgust twisted her lips. "I swear on my life—if I ever have feelings for you, may lightning strike me dead. Do you understand now?"

Her brutal oath left him utterly speechless.

Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined being rejected so harshly.

In his mind, a divorced woman like Evelyn should be grateful for his attention. A successful man like him was a rare catch.

Still, he recovered swiftly. "Evelyn, there's no need for cruelty. I won’t hand that recording to the police—on one condition. Be mine. Once we're together, your brothers become family. I’ll let bygones be bygones."

This was a trap. Blatant manipulation.

How could he speak of family so casually?

The world truly was a twisted place.

She had thought her adoptive parents were bizarre, but Jonathan and Judith took insanity to new heights.

Good people were rare indeed.

Nathaniel had warned her about Jonathan’s cunning nature. So had Christopher. Now, she saw it firsthand.

Just as she suspected—he was using the assault incident as leverage.

Desperate, she offered, "Jonathan, we can compensate you. Name your price."

Judith’s eyes gleamed at the mention of money, but Jonathan dismissed it instantly. "I don’t want money. I want you."

Marriage would bind Evelyn to him—and grant him access to her brothers’ wealth. Far more valuable than a one-time payout.

Evelyn scoffed. "Jonathan, as your mother said, a divorced woman like me isn’t worthy of you."

"My heart belongs to you, Evelyn. Your past doesn’t change that."

"Then here’s the truth—I’m pregnant." She played her final card.

Judith gasped. "Pregnant? Is it yours, Jonathan?"

Evelyn nearly laughed. As if she’d ever let him touch her.

Calmly, she clarified, "They’re my ex-husband’s twins. I’m keeping them. If you still want me, congratulations—you’ll be a stepfather. Can you handle that?"

Jonathan’s jaw clenched. The thought of raising another man’s children sickened him.

But he forced a smile. "If it means having you, I’ll accept anything."

Money could buy him his own heirs later.

Evelyn hadn’t expected that answer. It almost sounded sincere—but her instincts screamed lie.

Christopher had spent days teaching her how to spot deception. No man would surrender his pride so easily.

Jonathan’s quick acceptance? Suspicious.

She narrowed her eyes. "What exactly do you see in me? Tell me, and I’ll change it."

Why would he chase an orphan with nothing to offer?

"I’ve proven my devotion. No other man would go this far for you. I’d even jump off a building to show you."

Madness.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "Jonathan, I’ll never love you. Not even if you die. That’s final."
###Chapter 376

The tension in the air was suffocating. If this conversation dragged on any longer, Evelyn feared her blood pressure would skyrocket beyond control.

"Evelyn Carter, are you really just going to walk away? What about the recording?" Jonathan's voice cut through the silence like a blade.

She turned slightly, casting him a sidelong glance. "Why don’t you play it for me first?"

The prolonged silence that followed told her everything she needed to know—there was no recording. It had all been a bluff.

This entire visit had been pointless.

Frustration coiled in her chest as she wondered why Christopher hadn’t responded to any of her messages. The only way to settle this mess was to speak with him directly.

But right now, Christopher seemed as unreliable as ever.

Lost in her thoughts, Evelyn stepped out of the elevator, the lingering disgust from her confrontation with Jonathan and Judith clinging to her like a shadow.

Then, Nathaniel called.

She answered immediately. "What is it?"

"About that photo—it's not what you think."

Today had been full of surprises, but this? Nathaniel Whitmore, explaining himself to her? Unbelievable.

"Enough. I don’t want to hear it. I’m done," she snapped, her voice icy.

Before she could hang up, Judith’s shrill voice pierced the air from behind. "Evelyn Carter! How dare you be so heartless? Jonathan jumped off a building for you! You ungrateful wretch!"

Evelyn barely had time to react before Judith shoved her violently.

She crashed to the ground, her arms instinctively wrapping around her abdomen. A sharp pain shot through her, draining the color from her face as she gasped.

Nathaniel’s voice crackled through the phone, laced with panic. "Evelyn! What happened? Where are you?"

She reached weakly for the phone, but it was just out of reach. Gritting her teeth, she managed a strained whisper, "Nathaniel, I—"

Darkness swallowed her before she could finish.

On the other end, Nathaniel had just landed from his flight. His expression turned glacial as he turned to Robert. "Which hospital is Jonathan at?"

"Hope Hospital."

"Get a helicopter ready—now!" Nathaniel barked, his voice razor-sharp.

He tried calling Evelyn again, but there was no answer.

Dread coiled around him like a vice. It was the same suffocating fear he’d felt when he’d learned of Evelyn’s abduction. Even with Julian by her side, he had pulled every string to find her.

Now, her desperate cry for him had left him breathless.

Regaining his composure, he ordered Robert, "Evelyn might be hurt at the hospital. Contact the director immediately—ensure her safety at all costs."

The news hit Robert like a thunderbolt, sending a chill down his spine.

Within minutes, a helicopter was prepped, and Nathaniel was airborne, racing toward Hope Hospital.

Mid-flight, the hospital director called. "Mr. Whitmore, your wife has been taken to the emergency room."

Nathaniel’s grip on the phone tightened. "She walks out of there unharmed. I’ll arrange for any medical equipment you need."

"Don’t worry, Mr. Whitmore. We’re doing everything we can, but her condition is unstable," Simon Whitmore reported.

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Did she hit her head?"

"No." A pause. "She’s pregnant."
###Chapter 377

Nathaniel's thoughts spiraled out of control as the shocking news sank in.

"Evelyn's pregnant? Then who's the father?" A torrent of questions assaulted his mind.

Before he could process this further, Simon's urgent voice crackled through the phone. "Mr. Whitmore, if complications arise, who should we prioritize? The mother or the child?"

Confronted with this impossible choice, Nathaniel drew a sharp breath.

All he knew in this moment was that the universe was mocking him - he'd been betrayed.

If Evelyn was carrying another man's child, what did that make him?

His voice turned glacial. "Must I really spell it out?"

"The child then?" Simon pressed, assuming heirs mattered most to wealthy men like Nathaniel.

A dark storm crossed Nathaniel's features. "Save the mother. The baby means nothing to me."

He would never waste concern on a child that wasn't his blood.

Suppressing his urge to demand the hospital treat Evelyn was the only mercy he could muster.

If anyone dared suggest he care about that baby, he couldn't be responsible for his actions.

Meanwhile, Robert caught the crucial detail from that conversation - Evelyn was pregnant!

Robert expected Nathaniel to be overjoyed by the news.

Yet judging by Nathaniel's thunderous expression, the baby clearly wasn't his.

Though Robert trusted Evelyn's character, he wisely kept silent.

After hanging up, Nathaniel radiated fury. Robert sealed his lips tight.

Would knowing this secret get him killed?

Being an executive assistant these days required nerves of steel.

Twenty minutes later, the helicopter touched down on the hospital roof.

Nathaniel disembarked to find Simon waiting. As the hospital's largest benefactor, Nathaniel warranted VIP treatment.

Despite his stormy demeanor, concern bled through. "How is she?"

"Congratulations, Mr. Whitmore. Both mother and baby are perfectly healthy."

Nathaniel froze momentarily - he'd secretly hoped this accident would resolve his problem.

Without another word, he stormed toward the private suite.

Evelyn lay peacefully in bed, her expression serene.

No matter how furious he felt, he reined in his temper for now.

He turned sharply to Simon. "What happened? I heard shouting on the phone. Someone pushed her."

Evelyn wouldn't have screamed like that without cause. Something terrible had occurred.

That middle-aged woman's shrill voice - she must be involved.

Simon answered carefully, "Security footage confirms Mrs. Whitmore was pushed. But while we treated her, the woman and her son fled the hospital."

Nathaniel yanked at his tie, baffled why Evelyn would visit that scheming man at the hospital, only to get hurt.

A terrible suspicion took root - was Jonathan the father?
###Chapter 378

"Don't worry, Mr. Whitmore. We'll investigate this thoroughly. Their medical expenses remain unsettled," Simon assured in a professional tone.

"Lower your voice. I can hear you perfectly fine," Nathaniel scolded quietly.

But it was too late. Evelyn had already regained consciousness.

Pain radiated through every inch of her body. As her eyelids fluttered open, her trembling hands immediately went to her abdomen, terrified for her unborn children.

Their safety remained uncertain, sending waves of panic through her. When she lifted her gaze, Nathaniel stood before her.

Her pulse quickened. "What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be overseas? Am I hallucinating?"

His lips curled into a mocking smile. "Feeling guilty about something, Evelyn?"

She pressed her lips together, refusing to respond.

Robert, sensing the mounting tension, discreetly gestured for Simon and the medical staff to exit.

The room emptied, leaving the estranged couple in suffocating silence.

A weakened Evelyn propped herself against the headboard, noticing the bandages covering her knees and the antiseptic smell from her treated elbow.

Though questions burned in her mind, she dared not inquire about her babies' condition under Nathaniel's piercing stare.

"Lost your tongue, Evelyn Carter? Weren't you boasting about being some independent woman? Collecting admirers like trading cards? Enjoying your little rebellion now that your backup plan turned against you?"

His cruel words stung. "This was an accident! How was I supposed to predict that deranged woman would attack me?" she fired back.

"Problems with your master plan? I thought you had that scheming bastard wrapped around your finger. Couldn't handle your future mother-in-law's temper?" he taunted.

Her eyes widened in disbelief. "Who told you I came here for him? I only—"

"Then enlighten me. Were you touring hospitals for fun? Checking what mental disorder you qualify for?" he interrupted.

Frustration boiled over. "You're the one who needs psychiatric evaluation! Jonathan got hospitalized! If I hadn't intervened, he would've filed charges!"

Nathaniel's eyebrows shot up. "Excuse me?"

"Someone assaulted him and fractured his leg. That's why he's here. I came to settle matters before he involved the authorities. Why else would I be in this godforsaken place?" she snapped in one breath.

His expression became unreadable, the intensity of his gaze making her skin prickle. "Why are you looking at me like that?"

Nathaniel hadn't anticipated Evelyn confronting Jonathan about the incident, hence his surprise. "Even if he reported it, the perpetrator would never be identified."

The professionals he'd hired were experts—they'd broken just enough bones to cause pain without permanent damage. A coward like Jonathan would never trace it back to him.

Evelyn scoffed. "With today's forensic technology? Please. Criminals always leave traces. When they're caught, assault charges carry severe penalties."

The corner of Nathaniel's mouth twitched. "Indeed. The consequences would be... severe."

"Then why spout such nonsense?" Her irritation grew.

His mood inexplicably lightened. "Save your efforts. Jonathan has no evidence."

Her laugh held no humor. "How very confident. One might think you're the culprit yourself."
###Chapter 379

Evelyn barely had time to process her own words when Nathaniel's confession hit her like a thunderbolt.

"You're right," he admitted without hesitation, his voice dripping with arrogance. "I am the one who did it."

Her breath caught.

Had she misheard him?

His lips curled into a smirk as he took in her stunned expression. "Why do you look so shocked? Did you really not know it was me?"

The familiar sulk returned to his features.

She swallowed hard. "I—I thought it was Christopher."

"Christopher?" His eyes darkened instantly. "Since when do you have a brother?"

Evelyn swiftly redirected the conversation, her voice sharp. "Answer me, Nathaniel Whitmore. Why did you beat Jonathan Reeves to a pulp?"

If she had known the truth earlier, she wouldn’t have wasted her time at the hospital, subjected to Jonathan and Judith’s revolting behavior.

Nathaniel scoffed. "Why not? Do I need a reason?"

Evelyn was speechless. Because of him, she had endured days of Jonathan and Judith’s disgusting antics.

She had blamed Christopher, only to realize the real culprit was standing right in front of her—this infuriating man!

A pillow flew straight at Nathaniel’s face. "Are you out of your mind? Couldn’t you have warned me before pulling something like that? I wouldn’t have gotten involved!"

She wouldn’t have cared less if Jonathan had gone to the police.

Why? Because Nathaniel could walk through hell untouched.

Her voice trembled with fury. "Get out. I don’t want to see you right now."

Nathaniel dodged the pillow effortlessly, his gaze piercing. "Is this how you react when you find out I was the one who did it?"

He had genuinely believed her concern was for him.

She arched a brow. "My attitude depends entirely on the other person’s actions. This is what you get. Fair, don’t you think?"

His expression darkened.

"Three years ago, I married you when you were on the brink of death after that car accident. No one knew if you’d survive. And what did I get in return?" Her voice turned icy. "Only a fool makes the same mistake twice."

Nathaniel stepped closer, his voice low. "How do you know it’ll be a mistake if you don’t try again?"

Evelyn could only stare at him, lost for words.

His gaze sharpened. "You still haven’t answered me. Who is this brother of yours?"

She waved a dismissive hand. "Just someone from back home."

She had no intention of revealing her family secrets to Nathaniel—especially not the fact that she had three brothers and three cousins.

Not when she was planning to leave for Nord City and start a new life.

The less he knew, the harder it would be for him to find her.

For the sake of her babies, she had to be careful.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed dangerously. "What brother?"

As far as he knew, Evelyn was an orphan.

She shrugged. "We have a lot of relatives in the village. They’re my cousins."

His gaze dropped to her stomach, his tone turning stern. "Cut the act. You mean the father of the baby, don’t you?"

Her breath hitched.

Nathaniel knew?

He knew about the babies?

Since waking up, her thoughts had been consumed with worry for them—until Nathaniel’s presence turned her into a nervous wreck, making her forget everything else.

Somewhere in the back of her mind, she had foolishly convinced herself he would never find out.

Now, reality was crashing down on her.

She had imagined this moment countless times—Nathaniel discovering the truth. She had prepared herself mentally for it.

Taking a deep breath, she steadied herself.

He only knew about the pregnancy.

Not that he was the father.

As long as she never admitted it, she could still protect them.

At least, that’s what she told herself.
###Chapter 380

From the very beginning, Nathaniel Whitmore had been unequivocal about not wanting children. If he discovered Evelyn Carter's pregnancy, he would undoubtedly demand she terminate it.

Evelyn's decision came swiftly. "You're absolutely right!" she declared.

His face darkened instantly. "So this is why you've been so desperate for a divorce? You're carrying another man's child? I knew your sudden change of heart was suspicious - bringing up divorce out of nowhere. Not only have you found someone else, but you're pregnant with his baby!"

Cold sweat trickled down Evelyn's back as she fought to maintain her composure. The timing was critical - with the pregnancy progressing, paternity tests could now be performed prenatally. She couldn't take that risk!

Her fingers curled into fists beneath the blanket, though her expression remained calm. "I conceived after we signed the divorce papers. Legally, I've done nothing wrong."

A bitter relief washed over her. Nathaniel's poor opinion of her actually worked in her favor this time, providing cover for the child's existence.

"We haven't finalized the divorce yet. You're still my wife!" Nathaniel countered sharply.

Evelyn met his glare without flinching. "And aren't you engaged to Victoria Sinclair? That's the pot calling the kettle black! We've only been maintaining this charade for Eleanor Whitmore's sake, with an agreement not to interfere in each other's lives. I've kept my end of the bargain."

As the words left her lips, the air grew thick with Nathaniel's silent, dangerous energy.

But retreat wasn't an option. Any sign of weakness could endanger her child.

Nathaniel's voice turned icy. "Our agreement never included you getting pregnant!"

"Did it include your engagement to Victoria?" Evelyn shot back, her protective instincts flaring like a mother bear's.

Nathaniel leaned in until their faces were inches apart, his dark eyes burning. "No man tolerates being cuckolded, Evelyn. I'll give you one choice."

She instinctively recoiled, but the headboard stopped her retreat.

At this proximity, she could see every perfect feature of his face - the flawless skin, the faint shadow of stubble, even the individual lashes framing his piercing eyes.

Their breaths mingled in the charged space between them.

Evelyn's lips trembled. "What choice?"

"Terminate the pregnancy," he growled.

"Never!" Her refusal was immediate and absolute.

Her heart shattered even as she spoke. He would never accept this child.

Nathaniel's expression hardened. "You misunderstand - this isn't a request. Since you refuse the easy way, I'll have a doctor perform the procedure."

"No!" Evelyn clutched his arm desperately. "Please!"

His fingers dug into her chin. "Since when do I grant favors? Until those divorce papers are signed, you remain my wife. Did you think I'd raise another man's bastard?"

Desperation clawed at Evelyn's throat. "Nathaniel Whitmore, you have no right to take my child from me!"

His cruel laugh sent chills down her spine. "It's not my child."

"Who says it isn't?" Evelyn screamed, her voice breaking with raw emotion.
###Chapter 381

Evelyn lost control and shouted at Nathaniel, her maternal instincts roaring to life.

She knew his stubborn nature all too well. If he threatened to arrange an abortion, he would make it happen.

The hospital room plunged into silence.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened with disbelief. "What did you just say?"

His fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his piercing gaze.

Evelyn swallowed hard. "You heard me."

Regret twisted inside her, but she had no choice. This was his territory—his influence could erase her child in an instant.

Nathaniel's attention dropped to her stomach.

A shudder ran through Evelyn as she instinctively shielded her belly, but he shoved her hand away. The weight of his stare paralyzed her. She and her unborn child were at his mercy.

He exhaled sharply, his expression unreadable. Then, his voice came out rough. "That's mine?"

"Yes," Evelyn admitted quickly. She needed to pacify him, buy time until she could reach her brothers in Nord City. Once there, Nathaniel would never find her.

But his lips curled into a sneer. "Evelyn Carter, do you think I'm an idiot? Lying to protect some bastard? Where's your dignity?"

Her breath hitched. He doubted her?

"It is yours," she insisted.

Nathaniel scoffed. "You've spread your legs for half the city. How can you be sure?" His voice dripped with venom. "I never even wanted you."

Her cheeks burned. "You did. Once. Or have you forgotten?"

His jaw tightened. "Because you drugged me."

Her heart cracked. "So you don't believe me."

"Not a chance." He released her and stepped back, his voice glacial. "I'll arrange the procedure."

Evelyn's voice trembled as he turned to leave. "Would you keep it... if it were really yours?"

She held onto that fragile hope. If he hesitated, she'd demand a paternity test.

But Nathaniel didn't even glance back. "There's no if in this world."

The door slammed shut behind him.

Evelyn's composure shattered. Hot tears spilled down her face as she stared at the ceiling, choking back sobs. She'd asked him this before—why hadn't she learned?

Why did she keep hurting herself? The man she loved never existed.

Curling into herself, she cradled her stomach, whispering, "Don't be afraid, little one. Mommy won't let anything happen to you."

Outside the ward, Nathaniel stood rigid in the hallway, his tie ripped off, fists clenched. The urge to destroy something clawed at him.

Robert, his assistant, paled at the sight. It had been years since he'd seen Nathaniel this unhinged.
###Chapter 382

Nathaniel glared at the hospital director standing beside him. "What are the risks if she terminates the pregnancy?"

The director blinked in confusion. Why was Nathaniel suddenly discussing abortion when Evelyn had only just been confirmed pregnant?

But he didn’t dare question the order. "It varies, Mr. Whitmore. Early termination is safer, but multiple procedures can lead to complications."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Schedule the surgery."

The director hesitated. "Sir, with all due respect, Mrs. Whitmore’s condition is delicate. An abortion now could… permanently damage her fertility. And given she’s carrying twins—"

"Twins?" Nathaniel’s expression turned thunderous.

Robert, his assistant, winced. This was the last thing his boss needed to hear—his wife pregnant with another man’s child.

Realizing his blunder, the director quickly backtracked. "Shall I arrange the procedure immediately?"

Nathaniel’s scowl deepened.

Robert shot the director a warning look. Stop talking.

Suddenly, a nurse burst in, breathless. "Director! The patient—she jumped out the window!"

Nathaniel was out the door before she finished speaking. He kicked open the hospital room door, only to find the window wide open and the bed empty.

"Find her!" he roared. "If she’s hurt, I’ll burn this place to the ground!"

He stormed to the window, expecting to see Evelyn’s broken body below. But there was nothing.

"You said she jumped. Where is she?" he demanded.

The nurse stammered. "I—I only heard someone say she did!"

The head nurse rushed in to clarify. "She didn’t jump, sir. She climbed down the drainpipe from the balcony and escaped through the first floor."

The director exhaled in relief. "Thank God." If Evelyn had died, his career would be over.

Nathaniel kicked the bedframe with a snarl. "Evelyn Carter, you’ve got nerve! Track her down—now!"

Meanwhile, Evelyn sprinted through the streets, her hospital gown flapping behind her. She couldn’t let Nathaniel’s men catch her.

Her phone buzzed. Julian’s name flashed on the screen. She answered instantly, gasping. "Julian! I need help!"

Julian had been about to ask where to meet her. Instead, he slammed the accelerator. "Where are you? Hide somewhere safe—I’m coming!"

Evelyn ducked into a nearby park, but her gown made her stand out. A jogger slowed. "Miss, do you need assistance?"

She shook her head. "No, my brother’s picking me up."

Only Julian could save her now.

Her phone rang again. Nathaniel’s name this time.

She rejected the call and silenced her phone, scanning the park with wide eyes. Every shadow felt like a threat.

Then—footsteps. A man’s voice called out.
###Chapter 383

The crisp autumn air carried the faint scent of fallen leaves as Evelyn Carter pressed herself deeper into the shadows of the park bench. Her fingers trembled against the rough fabric of her hospital gown, the chill seeping into her bones.

Footsteps crunched against the gravel path.

Her breath hitched.

Had Nathaniel Whitmore tracked her here already?

She squeezed her eyes shut, praying it wasn’t him. With Eleanor Whitmore still in the ICU, there was no one left to shield her.

"Evelyn?"

Her head snapped up.

Relief crashed over her like a tidal wave.

"Julian!"

Tears pricked her eyes as she lunged forward, gripping his sleeve. Thank God it wasn’t Nathaniel.

Julian Montgomery’s face paled as he took in her disheveled state. "What the hell happened? Why are you in a hospital gown?" His voice dropped, sharp with fury. "Who did this to you?"

If someone had laid a finger on his sister, he’d make them regret it.

Evelyn shook her head, her grip tightening. "Just get me out of here. Now."

She couldn’t explain. Not yet.

Julian didn’t argue. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and guided her toward his car.

Inside, Evelyn’s pulse still hadn’t settled. Her gaze darted to the rearview mirror, scanning for any sign of pursuit.

Nothing.

For now.

But she knew Nathaniel wouldn’t give up so easily.

Julian shot her a sideways glance. "Talk to me, Ev. What’s going on?"

She exhaled shakily, sinking into the leather seat. "Nathaniel knows about the baby."

His grip on the steering wheel tightened. "How?"

She recounted the confrontation with Jonathan Reeves and his mother, Judith—how she’d been shoved, how Nathaniel had overheard everything when he’d rushed to the hospital.

Julian’s jaw clenched. "That bastard. I warned you about him." His knuckles whitened. "Don’t worry. I’ll handle it."

Evelyn shook her head. "It’s not about Jonathan. It’s the babies."

Julian frowned. "Look, I get why you didn’t want Nathaniel to know, but it’s not the end of the world. With Andrew on your side, custody won’t be an issue."

She bit her lip.

If only it were that simple.

Nathaniel didn’t just want custody—he doubted the children were his. And if Julian found out, he’d confront Nathaniel head-on.

She couldn’t let that happen.

"I need to go back to Nord City," she blurted.

Julian studied her for a long moment before nodding. "Alright. I’ll talk to Alexander as soon as we get back. We’ll arrange everything."

His expression darkened. "But why the hell were you alone? You’re pregnant, Evelyn. Where’s Christopher? He should’ve been with you."

Evelyn swallowed hard.

She couldn’t tell him the truth.

Not yet.
###Chapter 384

Evelyn cleared her throat uncomfortably. "I tried calling Christopher before leaving this morning, but some woman answered instead."

Her fingers twisted nervously in her lap. "Apparently my call caused their breakup, so I didn't dare disturb him again."

Julian's jaw tightened. Rage simmered beneath his calm exterior. That irresponsible playboy cousin of theirs needed to be taught a lesson.

"Julian, there's something else." Evelyn's voice turned solemn. "I can't keep using my current identity. I need to disappear completely in Nord City."

She couldn't risk Nathaniel finding her. Not when she carried his child.

Julian gave a curt nod. "I'll handle it. You look exhausted - you should rest when we get home."

"No!" The refusal burst from her lips before she could stop it. Panic flashed in her eyes. "I can't go back there, Julian. I need time alone to think. Tell Aunt Margaret I'll be staying at the university dorms for a few days."

Going home meant walking straight into Nathaniel's trap. She wouldn't make it that easy for him.

Julian exhaled sharply. "I have an apartment near the hospital. Use it whenever my shifts run late. You can stay there."

"Thank you." The tension drained from Evelyn's shoulders as she finally relaxed against the seat, exhaustion pulling her into sleep.

When they arrived, Julian hesitated before the sleeping figure. Moonlight revealed the bandages peeking from beneath her sleeves - painful reminders of her ordeal.

Leaving her undisturbed, Julian stepped out and dialed with violent precision.

Christopher answered with sleep-thickened voice. "Julian? What's—"

"Didn't you swear to personally escort Evelyn every damn day?" Julian's whisper was lethal. "Where were you when she got attacked, you useless bastard?"

Silence. Then frantic rustling. "What happened? I was hungover, I just woke up—"

"Some woman answered your phone while Evelyn needed you!" Julian's control snapped. "Is getting laid more important than protecting family?"

He'd spent years searching for his sister. Now this idiot nearly got her killed.

Christopher's voice turned ashen. "Where is she? I'm coming now."

"Apartment by General Hospital. And Christopher?" Julian's smile was vicious. "If Alexander finds out you failed her, you'll never see Evelyn again."

The line went dead.

Inside the penthouse, Christopher shoved away the clinging woman. "Did you answer my calls?"

She blinked innocently. "I don't remember, baby—"

"Get out." Ice dripped from his words.

As the door slammed, regret choked him. If Evelyn forgave him this time, he'd change. No more parties. No more women.

Meanwhile, Julian carried Evelyn inside, her phone buzzing incessantly.

The screen flashed with a single damning word:

Bastard.
###Chapter 385

Julian gently picked up the phone, careful not to disturb Evelyn's peaceful slumber.

He stepped outside, curiosity gnawing at him about the caller's identity.

At first, Julian considered ignoring it. But the relentless ringing suggested it couldn't wait. With a sigh, he finally answered. "Hello, who is this?"

On the other end, Nathaniel recognized the voice instantly, and his expression darkened. "Julian?"

"Nathaniel." Julian hadn't expected him to be calling. But he couldn't deny the tension crackling between them.

A low chuckle escaped Julian. "Bold of you to call."

Nathaniel's voice was sharp with barely restrained fury. "Put Evelyn on the phone."

That woman—pregnant and still managing to disappear. He'd spent the entire day searching, even fearing she might have gotten hurt. And now, her lover was answering her phone.

He shouldn't have wasted his concern.

Julian's tone turned glacial. "Who do you think you are? You think Evelyn will just obey your command? Listen carefully, Nathaniel—stay away from her, or you'll regret it."

If not for Evelyn's sake, he would have already told Alexander everything.

"This is Bern City, not Nord City. Drop the act, Julian. I won't repeat myself—get Evelyn on the phone."

Nathaniel's arrogance was infuriating, but his confidence wasn't unfounded. The Montgomerys might dominate Nord City, but here, he held the power.

Julian's jaw tightened. "Nathaniel Whitmore, you're delusional."

"I'm her husband," Nathaniel snapped.

Julian's fury flared. "Nathaniel, Evelyn is pregnant. Your actions will only hurt her!"

The sooner this marriage ended, the better. Evelyn needed to return to Nord City—where she belonged.

Unmoved, Nathaniel retorted, "That's not your decision. Pregnant or not, she's still my wife."

"In your dreams," Julian shot back. "Nathaniel, don't think the Montgomerys fear you just because this is Bern City. Lay a finger on her, and we'll come for you."

"Then let's see. In Bern City, there's no one I can't find," Nathaniel growled.

Julian's expression hardened. "A reminder—your grandmother is still in the ICU. As her chief surgeon, I know exactly how fragile her condition is. Cross me, and you know what happens."

Nathaniel's rage spiked. "Are you threatening me?"

"Absolutely. The Montgomerys don't make empty threats." Julian ended the call without hesitation. He had no doubt—his family would protect Evelyn at all costs.

Even if it meant revealing the truth to her.

Nathaniel's face twisted with fury. He turned to Robert. "Have you found her?"

"Not yet, but I've stationed men at Mrs. Whitmore's school and set up surveillance at her residence. The moment she appears, we'll know," Robert reported.

"Call them off. Withdraw everyone," Nathaniel ordered abruptly.

Robert hesitated but complied after seeing Nathaniel's expression.

What a disaster.

Robert cleared his throat. "Mr. Whitmore, if I may offer my opinion..."

"Go ahead."

"I don't believe Mrs. Whitmore is that kind of woman. With modern technology, a simple prenatal paternity test could settle this."
###Chapter 386

Nathaniel exhaled a slow stream of smoke, watching it curl into the dim light of the office. His expression was unreadable, obscured by the haze.

Heath—no, Robert—stood stiffly, waiting. He had delivered his report, but Nathaniel’s silence was heavier than the smoke between them.

The memory of Julian defending Evelyn flashed in Nathaniel’s mind. Did they even need a DNA test after that?

Yet, he said nothing. The air was thick, suffocating.

Evelyn jolted awake, her breath ragged, her face damp with tears.

The nightmare clung to her—Nathaniel’s men dragging her back, the sterile white of the operating room, the cold indifference in his eyes as she begged.

"No!"

Her hands flew to her stomach. Still there. Still safe.

She wasn’t in that hospital. She was in an unfamiliar apartment, hidden.

A soft knock.

"Evelyn?"

Christopher’s voice. Hesitant. Guilty.

She wiped her cheeks. "Come in."

The door creaked open. Christopher hovered, his usual confidence shattered. "You had a nightmare."

It wasn’t a question.

She didn’t answer. Instead, she asked, "Where’s Julian?"

"Emergency at the hospital." Christopher swallowed hard. "But I’m here. I won’t leave you again. I swear."

Evelyn shook her head. "This isn’t your fight, Christopher."

His eyes glistened. She wasn’t blaming him. After Julian’s furious lecture, he’d braced for her anger—but there was none.

It made the guilt worse.

His voice hardened. "I’ll make Jonathan pay. Him and his mother."

Evelyn’s lips thinned. She remembered the bruises on Jonathan’s face after Nathaniel’s men finished with him. "Leave it. I’ll handle it myself."

She had leverage now. The Whitmore name was powerful, but scandals were costly.

Christopher clenched his fists but nodded.

Then, softly: "I’m hungry. That place we went to last time—can you order?"

"Of course." He turned, relief and frustration warring in his steps.

The moment the door closed, Evelyn reached for her phone.

And dialed Jonathan.
###Chapter 387

415 BONGS

The phone kept ringing until the call finally connected. "Hello? Evelyn?"

Jonathan's voice was laced with wariness and disbelief.

Evelyn could hear the hesitation in his tone.

Her voice was icy. "I have footage of your mother attacking me at the hospital."

"Evelyn, I'm truly sorry about what happened. My mother is getting older, and she was just worried about me. She didn’t mean to lash out like that." Jonathan's tone softened with regret.

"If it wasn’t intentional, then why did the two of you flee?" Evelyn wasn’t buying his excuses. This mother-son pair had no boundaries.

Jonathan tried to negotiate. "Evelyn, how about this? I won’t press charges against your brother for hitting me, and you drop the case against my mother. We’ll call it even."

"Who told you it was my brother who hit you?" Evelyn’s voice remained cold. "I just found out it was my ex-husband, not my brother."

Jonathan was stunned. So it really was Evelyn’s ex-husband!

He scrambled to reason with her. "Evelyn, this is your family matter. Let’s just move on."

Evelyn laid out her terms. "That was my ex-husband, not my family. But if you want me to drop the charges against your mother, you’ll have to tell the police that it was my ex-husband who assaulted you."

"But back then, my eyes were covered when I was dragged away. And the person who hit me was wearing a mask. I have no proof," Jonathan muttered.

Evelyn reassured him. "Don’t worry about evidence. I’ll testify for you."

Jonathan was shocked by her words. It finally dawned on him—Evelyn was using him to trap her ex-husband!

The most dangerous thing is indeed a woman’s vengeance. How had he never realized how ruthless Evelyn could be?

But her ex-husband was capable of kidnapping and assault. He clearly wasn’t someone to mess with!

"Evelyn, it’s not that I don’t want to help you—"

"Jonathan, let’s be clear. This isn’t you helping me. It’s a transaction. Think it over tonight. I’ll be at the police station tomorrow. If you don’t show up, I’ll file charges against your mother." Without waiting for his response, she hung up.



Evelyn stared at her phone and exhaled sharply. She was certain Jonathan, the devoted mama’s boy, would agree to her terms.

She wasn’t sure if this would actually affect Nathaniel, but it was worth a shot.

After eating, exhaustion overwhelmed her, and she fell asleep almost instantly.

Christopher watched over her for a while before quietly returning to the living room. He sent a message to the family group chat: "Evelyn fell asleep right after dinner."

Andrew replied immediately: "I’ve already booked a new flight. I’ll handle this personally. That old woman isn’t getting away with this."

Sebastian chimed in: "I hacked into Jonathan’s company system. Found evidence of illegal activities and tax evasion. We can use it as leverage."

Alexander’s text was furious: "We need to teach those two a lesson. How dare they try to take advantage of Evelyn? Over my dead body."

Olivia wrote: "Victoria has been crying nonstop in front of Margaret. I’m worried Margaret won’t accept Evelyn if she comes home."

Ever since Victoria refused to give up her adopted status, she had clung to Margaret like a shadow. The implied threat was obvious.

Daniel’s message was blunt: "I always said Victoria was trouble. But no one listened. Now look at the mess we’re in."
###Chapter 388

Alexander finally sent the message: "I'll make sure Victoria leaves Nord City and never comes back."

As long as Victoria stayed away, Evelyn wouldn’t have to face her when she returned.

Alexander had hoped to end things amicably, but after Victoria used Margaret as leverage, he wasn’t about to let her walk away unscathed.

The next morning, Evelyn woke up in her apartment, her head still foggy.

After a quick shower, she stepped into the kitchen for breakfast.

Christopher sat beside her, grinning. "So, Evelyn, school today? Or do you have other plans? Just say the word!"

"I know. Don’t worry, I won’t say anything. I’m heading out now. Stay put. Call me if you need anything," Christopher said before leaving.

Evelyn nodded. The moment the door closed, she grabbed her bag and rushed out.

Inside the taxi, she quickly texted Jonathan: "Be at the police station in thirty minutes."

Jonathan called immediately, but Evelyn ignored it. By the time she arrived, he was already there, panting. "Evelyn, let’s talk this out like adults."

"No promises." She turned and strode inside, knowing he’d follow.

A smirk curled her lips. Hook, line, and sinker.

Fifteen minutes later, everything was settled. As they stepped out of the station, Jonathan stared at her in disbelief. "You’ve changed, Evelyn. I don’t even recognize you anymore."

Her gaze was ice. "People do."

He cleared his throat. "Look, your ex-husband was trash. What’s next for you? Why not give me a shot? You’re a designer, I own a studio. Together, we could—"

Evelyn scoffed. "Not happening. Run back to Mommy, little boy."

His jaw clenched. "You’re a divorced woman! Who do you think you are? Am I not good enough?"

"Exactly. You’re not." She had no patience for his delusions. If not for her plan to pressure Nathaniel, she’d have sued his mother for assault already.

Her phone buzzed.

It was Victoria Hawthorne, calling from the hospital. "Mrs. Whitmore, Mrs. Eleanor has woken up."

"Really?" Evelyn’s heart leapt.

"Yes, she keeps murmuring your name. Come see her when you can."

"I’ll be right there." She hung up and hailed another cab, her pulse racing.

Eleanor was awake.

Julian had told her that once a patient regained consciousness, recovery was just a matter of time.

Without another thought, Evelyn rushed to the ICU. Spotting Victoria, she asked, "Where’s Grandma Eleanor?"

"She’s being prepped for tests. She’s finally awake." Victoria smiled.

Evelyn exhaled, relief washing over her. "I knew she’d pull through."

Victoria glanced behind her. "Ah, Mr. Whitmore. You’re here."

Evelyn froze.
###Chapter 389

Evelyn stood rooted to the spot, her breath hitching. She hadn't anticipated Nathaniel's arrival this soon.

She had hurried here, desperate to see Eleanor before he appeared. Her plan was simple—slip away unnoticed afterward.

Yet fate had other ideas.

The sound of Nathaniel's footsteps echoed behind her—measured, deliberate, each one sending a shiver down her spine. Evelyn clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms as she fought to steady her breathing.

Those few seconds stretched into an eternity.

When the footsteps stopped, she felt the weight of his gaze like a blade pressed against her back, cold and unyielding.

Nathaniel loomed over her, his presence suffocating. His lips thinned before he addressed Victoria. "Where's Grandmother Eleanor?"

"She's undergoing an examination. The doctor said everything appears normal, so there's no cause for concern," Victoria reassured him.

Nathaniel's expression softened slightly. "Thank you for looking after her, Victoria."

"It's my pleasure. When Mrs. Whitmore sees the two of you—well, all three of you—together, I'm certain she'll be overjoyed." Victoria smiled warmly.

Evelyn's own smile faltered. The air around them grew heavy, the temperature dropping as if winter had descended upon them.

The irony wasn't lost on her. Victoria's innocent remark had struck a nerve neither of them could ignore.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened, his voice low and controlled. "Victoria, you should rest. I'll stay with her."

"I don't mind, but I’ll go prepare Mrs. Whitmore’s room." Victoria, ever perceptive, excused herself without hesitation.

Once alone, Evelyn's chest tightened. Without Victoria as a buffer, what would happen now?

The corridor fell into oppressive silence.

Nathaniel's gaze burned into her, but she refused to cower. She straightened her posture, her silence a fragile shield.

Finally, he spoke, his voice laced with quiet menace. "Not running this time?"

Evelyn flinched but held her ground. Avoiding him wouldn’t protect her child. She swallowed hard. "Would you have preferred I waited for you to make the first move?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, his expression unreadable. "At least we agree on one thing. I find it hard to believe the child survived a fall from that height."

Her hand instinctively cradled her stomach. "Luck was on our side."

His eyes flickered with something indiscernible. "Have you considered the consequences? What do you gain by keeping it?"

Evelyn refused to meet his gaze. "That’s my choice to make."

"And if I insist otherwise?" His voice was lethally calm. "I’ll arrange for the best doctors. You can still have children later—if you even want them."

To him, it made no difference.

Evelyn’s face paled. Just as she feared—Nathaniel had no intention of sparing this child.

Her hand fell from her belly as she finally met his eyes. "You know how much Eleanor has been looking forward to this baby."

Nathaniel’s gaze turned glacial. "Are you using my grandmother against me? She just narrowly escaped death."

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "If that’s how you see it."

She had to buy time. Protect herself.

The tension between them thickened. Nathaniel’s eyes burned with warning, but beneath it, something else flickered—something Evelyn couldn’t decipher.
###Chapter 390

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn as he finally spat out through clenched teeth, "Fine. Have it your way."

Evelyn's fingers curled into tight fists, her resolve hardening like steel. For her unborn child, she wouldn't yield an inch.

"You and Julian are two peas in a pod," Nathaniel sneered, his voice dripping with venom. "Both of you wielding Eleanor as your weapon against me."

At Julian's name, Evelyn's breath hitched. Had her brother confronted Nathaniel? Julian was the only Montgomery who knew about both her secret marriage and pregnancy.

A cold dread crept up her spine. "Leave him out of this. The decision was mine alone. He actually advised against keeping the baby."

Nathaniel's eyebrow arched in surprise. "He opposed it?" Then why was she being so stubborn?

With an angry jerk, he loosened his tie. "Using a child as leverage is pathetic."

Evelyn met his glare with mocking defiance. "I'm well aware."

"Yet here you are - a hopeless romantic fool!" His laugh was cruel.

After discovering Evelyn's condition, Nathaniel had secretly consulted top specialists about termination risks. He'd even arranged the finest obstetrician to ensure her future fertility. Why was she so obsessed with Julian?

Evelyn's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Exactly. If I weren't such a fool, would I have married you? Spent three years as your obedient puppet?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Nathaniel... is this concern about me and the baby because you want me to stay?"

She braced for his trademark icy rebuke.

Instead, Nathaniel remained eerily composed, his dark eyes studying her with unsettling intensity. After a charged silence, he stated coolly, "That's one possibility."

The unexpected admission sent shockwaves through Evelyn.

Under the harsh lighting, Nathaniel's flawless features appeared carved from marble as his gaze darkened. "You know how Eleanor adores you. I lied about your pregnancy to convince her for surgery." His lips thinned. "Fate has a twisted sense of humor - the lie became truth. If we remain married, we can pretend nothing changed. Life continues as before."

"As before?" Evelyn's mind reeled. Was he actually reconsidering divorce?

Nathaniel shifted uncomfortably before regaining his composure. "You'll retain all privileges as Mrs. Whitmore. We'll share the spotlight together."

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed. "But the baby isn't yours!"

"I know." His jaw tightened. "I've never cared about marital conventions. But you must sever all ties with Julian and the Montgomerys." He could tolerate the pregnancy, but never the child's father in their lives.

Evelyn's thoughts spiraled. Cutting off Julian was impossible - her brother wasn't even the father! Nathaniel had completely misunderstood.

"Evelyn Carter!" Nathaniel's voice turned glacial. "That's my non-negotiable condition."

The tension shattered when his phone rang. An unfamiliar voice announced, "Mr. Whitmore? This is the Metropolitan Police. We need you to come in regarding a kidnapping and assault case..."
###Chapter 391

The phone call continued as Nathaniel turned to Evelyn, his stormy gray eyes darkening like gathering thunderclouds. He cleared his throat roughly before responding, "Understood."

Evelyn caught the dangerous shift in Nathaniel's expression, her stomach twisting with sudden apprehension.

Nathaniel's voice dropped to a menacing growl. "So you're testifying for Jonathan and accusing me of kidnapping and assault?"

The words made Evelyn recall her recent police station visit with Jonathan. Her lashes fluttered nervously. She had thought using Eleanor as leverage would protect her.

But she never expected the elderly woman to wake up at this critical juncture.

Though guilt gnawed at her conscience for involving Eleanor, Evelyn couldn't afford hesitation now. She had only mentioned Nathaniel's grandmother as a deterrent, never intending actual harm.

She knew Nathaniel's weakness. He would yield for Eleanor's sake.

Yet his sudden offer to halt their divorce proceedings—even sparing her unborn child—left her reeling. Just days ago he'd demanded she terminate the pregnancy. What game was he playing now?

As Evelyn wrestled with these thoughts, Nathaniel closed the distance between them, his piercing gaze demanding answers. "Well?"

He'd ordered Felix's beating to protect Evelyn from deception. And now she stood with Jonathan, ready to testify against him!

A bitter laugh escaped Nathaniel's lips. Never in his ruthless business dealings had he shown such mercy—except repeatedly for Evelyn.

And this was how she repaid him?

Evelyn swallowed hard, her voice barely above a whisper. "If you promise not to harm my baby, I'll convince Jonathan to drop the charges. I won't testify."

Nathaniel's laughter turned icy. "Do you truly believe you can blackmail me? If I wanted someone beaten, I'd ensure no evidence leads back to me. My hands are clean, Evelyn Carter. Those men would take the fall willingly. You're painfully naive."

Evelyn's breath hitched as she stumbled backward.

Nathaniel's smoldering gaze followed her retreat.

Suddenly, a familiar weight settled on Evelyn's shoulders as Julian's calm voice interrupted. "Mrs. Whitmore's examination is complete."

Turning toward her brother, Evelyn exhaled in relief.

But the moment Julian and Nathaniel locked eyes, the air crackled with tension.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Only Julian's role as Eleanor's physician kept his temper in check.

Julian returned the glare with equal disdain. He'd always despised Nathaniel. Soon Evelyn would be free—once Alexander finalized the divorce, they could leave Bern City forever.

The two men broke eye contact simultaneously, each finding the other intolerable.

Evelyn turned to Julian. "Where's Grandmother Eleanor now?"

"Moved to a regular ward. She needs complete rest—no visitors yet." Julian offered a reassuring smile.

"And the results?" Evelyn pressed.

"Positive. With proper care, she'll recover fully. Maintaining stable emotions is crucial during convalescence. I'll monitor her progress closely." Julian's professional tone softened slightly.
###Chapter 392

Julian's words were directed squarely at Nathaniel. If Nathaniel dared to lay a hand on Evelyn or her unborn child, Julian wouldn't hesitate to step in.

Content rights by N?velDr//ama.Org.

Nathaniel understood immediately. Just as he suspected, both Julian and Evelyn were using Eleanor as leverage against him.

Nathaniel staggered backward before turning to leave the ICU, his retreating figure radiating quiet despair.

Evelyn watched him go. She had feared a violent confrontation between the two men. Thankfully, nothing had happened.

"Don't worry, Evelyn. He won't dare touch you," Julian reassured her, his voice firm.

Evelyn turned to face him. "Julian, what exactly did you and Nathaniel discuss?"

"Nothing important. I just warned him to stay away from you," Julian replied with a casual shrug.

"I don't want you getting into trouble because of me," Evelyn said, her brows furrowing with concern.

Julian felt a pang at her thoughtfulness. "Evelyn, this is nothing. Your brothers aren't useless, you know. Besides, I'm overseeing Mrs. Whitmore Senior's post-operative care. Do you really think Nathaniel would risk harming me?"

"But you weren't the surgeon who operated on Grandma Eleanor," Evelyn pointed out.

Julian quickly countered, "I'm handling her follow-up treatment since the lead surgeon had to return to Nord City."

"I see." Evelyn relaxed slightly. She knew Nathaniel wouldn't do anything too extreme—not when Eleanor's wellbeing was at stake.

Just then, her phone buzzed. It was Christopher calling.

Evelyn suddenly remembered she had sneaked out of the house. In her rush to the hospital after hearing about Eleanor's recovery, she'd completely forgotten she'd sent Christopher to fetch her some clothes.

Handing the phone to Julian, she whispered urgently, "Julian, I snuck out. Don't let Christopher find out."

"He'll figure it out eventually. Besides, you'll be returning to Nord City with us soon," Julian said with an amused smile.

"Let's cross that bridge when we get to it." Evelyn knew her brothers loved her and didn't want to cause unnecessary trouble. She just wanted to leave quietly and quickly.

Once her paperwork was settled, Eleanor would likely have recovered enough for travel.

+15 BONOS

Unable to resist Evelyn's pleading eyes, Julian answered the call. "It's me. Evelyn's getting her dressing changed at the hospital. We'll be back soon. Prepare some of her favorite food and plenty of snacks."

Christopher didn't suspect a thing. "Got it. Leave it to me."

After hanging up, Evelyn took her phone back. "Thank you, Julian."

"You have ten minutes to visit Mrs. Whitmore Senior before we leave," Julian said, knowing Evelyn would want to check on Eleanor and Margaret.

Evelyn headed upstairs to the private ward. Guards stood watch outside, and the corridor was eerily silent.

She hesitated at the door, unsure whether to wait until the others left before entering.

But Victoria noticed her and hurried over. "Mrs. Whitmore, why are you standing out here? Mrs. Whitmore Senior has been asking for you."

Summoning her courage, Evelyn stepped inside. She approached the bed where Eleanor lay connected to a ventilator. Though pale, Eleanor's eyes brightened when she saw Evelyn.

Evelyn took Eleanor's hand gently. "Grandma Eleanor, I'm so glad you're okay. I'll visit you as often as I can."

Eleanor nodded weakly and placed a trembling hand on Evelyn's belly, her eyes shimmering with unspoken emotion.
###Chapter 393

Evelyn's heart churned as she met Eleanor's earnest gaze.

She forced a gentle smile. "The baby is perfectly healthy, please don't worry."

Eleanor's eyes flickered toward Nathaniel. Understanding the unspoken request, Evelyn continued, "Nathaniel has been... considerate. He's made sure I lack for nothing. I haven't been to the studio lately—between the pregnancy and my classes, I'm constantly exhausted."

Nathaniel's piercing stare burned into Evelyn's profile, but he remained silent.

Eleanor gave a weak nod of approval.

Evelyn leaned closer, voice dropping to a whisper. "You must focus on recovering. The sooner you get better, the sooner you can personally supervise my pregnancy."

A fragile peace settled over Eleanor's features before tears welled in her eyes. Evelyn dabbed them away with a tissue. "Rest now. We'll visit again soon."

Eleanor blinked slowly in acknowledgment before fixing Nathaniel with another meaningful look.

Though Evelyn understood the silent demand, she kept her eyes lowered. She couldn't bear to witness whatever performance Nathaniel might stage.

After an excruciating pause, Nathaniel finally spoke. "She'll be safe with me."

Only then did Eleanor's eyelids flutter shut in sleep. Evelyn carefully tucked the blankets around her before following Nathaniel into the hallway.

She inhaled sharply. "I should go."

"Evelyn Carter."

Her steps faltered but she didn't turn. "Yes?"

Nathaniel's voice carried an unfamiliar weight. "My protection extends beyond today. Remember that."

The words confused her. How could her greatest threat suddenly offer sanctuary?

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "Thank you, but unnecessary. I'll have Jonathan drop the charges. Consider us even."

Without waiting for a response, she hurried toward the elevators.

+15 BONOS

Inside the descending lift, Evelyn cradled her stomach. Between Eleanor's intervention and Nathaniel's sudden willingness to preserve their marriage, she dared hope the baby might survive this nightmare.

This unexpected reprieve came courtesy of Eleanor's timely awakening. Without it... Evelyn shuddered at the possibilities narrowly avoided.

Julian waited anxiously in the lobby. At the sight of her, tension visibly drained from his shoulders. "He didn't hurt you?"

"Not with Eleanor watching." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Let's leave."

Only when they were safely in the car did Julian exhale deeply. "The family knows about your injuries, but not the pregnancy. Only about Jonathan pushing you. Andrew is already en route to Bern City."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her seatbelt. "Julian, I won't press charges. The real danger came from Nathaniel. But we've reached... an understanding. The baby will be safe."
###Chapter 394

Julian pressed his lips together. "Evelyn, you don't have to do this. Even if you go after Jonathan, Nathaniel wouldn't dare lay a finger on you."

"Julian, my mind is made up. I can't back out now," Evelyn sighed.

She knew her brothers would stop at nothing to protect her from Nathaniel, but she refused to drag them into her mess. Besides, she was leaving soon. There was no point stirring up unnecessary trouble.

Julian frowned but relented for her sake.

However, dropping the charges against Jonathan was out of the question. Even if they couldn't prosecute him for Evelyn's injury, there were other ways to make him pay.

But Julian kept their plans to himself.

Both siblings had their secrets, and the topic was dropped.

Back at Julian's apartment, Evelyn immediately called Jonathan from the bathroom. "Withdraw the charges. We're not pursuing this anymore."

"Evelyn, giving up so soon? What did your ex offer you?" Jonathan sneered.

"None of your business. Just drop it. And as for your mother, I won't press charges against her either. We're even now," Evelyn snapped.

Jonathan persisted, "Evelyn, now that everything's cleared up, why don't you come back to the studio? I—"

Evelyn hung up before he could finish. She wasn't sparing Judith for Jonathan's sake—she was protecting her child. The thought of seeing either of them again made her stomach turn.

Soon, Christopher returned with an assortment of delicious food for Evelyn.

His careful attention told her he still blamed himself for her injury. She could feel the love radiating from her brothers.

That settled it. She would return to Nord City and live with them.

Late that night, Andrew arrived straight from the airport, but Evelyn was already asleep.

Julian waited for him in the living room. "Don't let Evelyn find out," he murmured.

Andrew nodded. "I know. I've already arranged Jonathan's... consequences."

Christopher's expression darkened. "We can't let them off easy. That snake still thinks he has a chance with her. Dream on."

After a brief discussion, the three brothers agreed—Jonathan wouldn't escape unscathed.

Evelyn stayed at Julian's place for two more days. Once her wounds had nearly healed, she returned to her studies to prepare for exams.

As she stepped out of the library, a middle-aged woman rushed toward her. "Evelyn! I've been looking everywhere for you! Why aren't you answering my calls?"

Evelyn's smile vanished at the sight of Judith. "I don't owe you anything."

She had blocked Judith's number long ago.

"Evelyn, I know I acted rashly at the hospital. I'm sorry. Please don't hold it against an old woman like me," Judith begged.

Evelyn frowned. "Let go. I don't want to see you, and I don't accept your apology. I made myself clear to Jonathan. Don't come looking for me again."

"Evelyn, wait! Don't you know?" Judith cried. "Jonathan's been arrested!"
###Chapter 395

Evelyn froze when she heard that Jonathan had been arrested. "What are you talking about?"

"Evelyn, you're the only one who can help me now. Ever since my son was taken into custody, the entire studio staff has abandoned their posts. Some even demanded their unpaid salaries from me. Where am I supposed to get that kind of money? My son trusted you more than anyone. He always said you were the most gifted designer in the company. If you come back and support his business, there might still be a chance to save it," Judith pleaded, desperation thick in her voice.

Now Evelyn understood why Judith had sought her out with such humility. She had been waiting here, hoping to manipulate her into returning.

Evelyn remained unmoved. "I'm sorry, but I've already resigned. I won't be going back."

"Evelyn, I know you and my son were once close. It was my fault for interfering. I regret it now. But with him in trouble, you're the only person I can turn to. If you help him through this crisis and get him out, I won't stand in your way anymore. You can be together," Judith begged again, her voice trembling.

Evelyn frowned in disbelief. "Do you and your son share the same delusion? I never had feelings for Jonathan. He was the one who wouldn't leave me alone. I will never be with him. Is that clear enough?"

She turned to leave, unwilling to waste another second on this conversation.

Judith's face twisted in anger. "Oh, so now that my son is down on his luck, you're abandoning him? Don't forget—you're a divorced woman! Who do you think you are to look down on him?"

Evelyn's expression remained icy. "I'd rather stay single for the rest of my life than be with Jonathan."

"Evelyn Carter, stop pretending! You rushed to the hospital to take care of him when he was injured last time. This is just a temporary setback. My son has powerful connections—he'll bounce back soon enough. And when he does, you'll regret turning your back on him!" Judith snapped, her face red with fury.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Is that so? I'll be waiting for that day, then."

"Evelyn Carter, no wonder your marriage failed! You're nothing but a gold-digger! What man would ever want someone like you? Let me tell you—no decent man will look twice at a divorced woman like you. Do you really think you're some prize? You'll never find another man as devoted as my son!" Judith shrieked, her voice rising hysterically.

Before Evelyn could respond, a firm hand settled on her shoulder, and a smooth voice cut in. "I'm afraid you're mistaken. I happen to be her suitor. And even if she were twice her age, she'd still have admirers lining up for her."

Evelyn recognized Christopher's voice and stayed silent, letting him handle Judith. The woman's venomous words were making her stomach churn.

Judith's eyes bulged when she took in Christopher's striking features. "Where did this pretty boy come from?"

Christopher smirked. "Nord City. And for the record, my net worth would make your mama's boy look like a pauper."

"Liar! You're probably just some gigolo. How could a woman like Evelyn land a wealthy man? She's an orphan! Her family has nothing!" Judith spat.

Christopher's expression darkened. He lifted his wrist, flashing an expensive watch, then glanced at Evelyn. "Let's go. I just bought a new sports car. Want to take it for a spin?"

Evelyn played along, tilting her head. "Is it a gift for me?"

"Of course. If you asked for the stars, I'd pluck them from the sky for you," Christopher said with a playful wink.

Evelyn followed him outside the school gates. Sure enough, a sleek, high-end sports car gleamed under the sunlight, parked right by the curb.
###Chapter 396

Evelyn Carter's eyes widened as she took in the sleek sports car parked before her. Her breath hitched. Was this man truly that wealthy?

Judith Reeves, still stubborn, sneered. "Evelyn Carter, he's just toying with you. Only my son would offer you marriage."

A soft laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Marriage? As if that's some divine gift. I couldn't care less."

Christopher Montgomery leaned casually against the car, his sharp gaze flickering toward Judith. She visibly shrank back. "What do you want?"

His voice was ice. "If you dare harass Evelyn again, I'll ensure your son never sees the outside of a prison cell."

Judith paled. It wasn't until Christopher drove away that the realization struck—he was likely behind her son's arrest.

But the sports car was already gone.

She collapsed onto the pavement, regret clawing at her chest. If only she hadn’t provoked Evelyn. Now, with her son locked away, what could she do?

Meanwhile, Evelyn walked beside Christopher, her mind racing.

Jonathan Reeves' arrest had stunned her. She quickly texted her former colleagues, piecing together the truth.

One reply read: "Heard Mr. Reeves got busted for financial fraud. Apparently, he fabricated names to embezzle school funds and diverted investor money into his own accounts—bought himself properties."

Another chimed in: "Now that his schemes are exposed, he’s done for. Facing years unless he repays everything. Disgusting. Good thing you left when you did."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She hadn’t expected Jonathan to be so corrupt. She’d never noticed before.

Now, she saw him for what he was—a fraud.

She hadn’t pressed charges against Judith, but karma had caught up with Jonathan.

Christopher hesitated. "Evelyn... was that woman Jonathan’s mother?"

She nodded. "Yes. He was arrested. It doesn’t look good for him."

"Are you... worried about him?" Christopher asked carefully.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why would I waste a thought on a man like him? He dug his own grave."

Christopher relaxed slightly.

Then, cautiously, he broached the subject. "Evelyn, I might have misheard, but... did that woman mention a divorce?"

Evelyn paused. "You heard right."

Christopher’s grip tightened on the wheel. "You’re serious? Who was it?"

How dare anyone divorce Evelyn? Marrying her was a privilege, and that fool had thrown it away!

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "It doesn’t matter who he was. It’s over."

"Evelyn," Christopher said firmly, pulling the car over. "You’re not alone anymore. You have us now. Who was he? I swear—"

She cut him off softly. "I was the one who wanted the divorce."
###Chapter 397

Christopher paused. "Well, that's also your ex-husband's fault. Even with your gentle nature, you can't tolerate him. Clearly, he's the problem."

Evelyn was kind-hearted, pure, and utterly adorable. What kind of fool wouldn't cherish such a woman? To drive her to file for divorce?

Without question, the blame lay entirely with that man.

Evelyn gave a resigned smile. "Christopher, I share some responsibility too."

She shouldn't have married Nathaniel on impulse all those years ago.

Christopher ruffled her hair affectionately. "To me, Evelyn, you're perfect! Divorce means nothing these days. I know plenty of eligible bachelors in Nord City. When you're ready, I'll arrange introductions."

"Christopher, I'm not looking for any relationships right now," Evelyn sighed.

"Exactly! Marriage is where love goes to die. You should play the field. Move on when you get bored."

Evelyn shot him an exasperated look. This was classic Christopher's perspective on romance.

After a thoughtful pause, she said, "Please don't tell the family about my divorce yet."

"Evelyn, we wouldn't judge. We'd just be furious you suffered alone. If we'd found you sooner... But if you're worried about your ex causing trouble, Andrew's a lawyer. We could make him pay—literally."

"That's not it. I just want a clean break. I'll be leaving soon anyway, and I want all ties with Nathaniel severed completely." Evelyn shook her head firmly.

"If that's what you want." Christopher relented. "But about Alexander—"

Evelyn understood. "I'll tell Alexander myself when we return to Nord City."

And about the baby growing inside her. Once safely in Nord City, she wouldn't need to hide anything from her brothers anymore.

Christopher nodded. "By the way, there's an exciting music festival at your university. They're hosting a prestigious piano ensemble from Nord City."

"I know—the renowned Clair de Lune ensemble. Music majors are competing fiercely for apprenticeship spots. It's a career-making opportunity." Evelyn nodded.

Christopher turned to her intently. "Evelyn, do you want to attend?"

"If time permits, I'd love to experience world-class musicianship firsthand." Her eyes sparkled with anticipation.

"That's not what I meant." Christopher leaned closer. "Do you want to join the ensemble? You've got remarkable talent. In Nord City, you could pursue music professionally."

Christopher genuinely believed in his sister's potential. Her childhood circumstances had stifled her gifts. Had she grown up with them, she'd undoubtedly be a concert pianist by now.

Evelyn looked stunned. "Christopher, I'm far too old to start. I only know basic pieces—not even at a child's competition level. Joining Clair de Lune? Don't tease me."

"Evelyn, dreams matter. What if this one comes true?" Christopher's tone held hidden meaning. If she agreed, arrangements could easily be made.

He had years to nurture Evelyn into the brilliant pianist she was meant to be.
###Chapter 398

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Evelyn Carter's path as she hurried toward campus. Her textbooks felt heavier than usual today, weighted with unspoken worries.

Her phone vibrated violently in her pocket.

"Evelyn Carter? This is Detective Morrison from the 12th precinct." The voice crackled through the receiver. "We need to discuss your involvement with Jonathan Reeves and Elite Studio. Come down to the station at your earliest convenience."

The call ended before she could respond. Evelyn's fingers trembled against her phone case. Why would the police want her? She'd only worked part-time at that damned studio - no benefits, no contracts, just minimum wage and empty promises.

Were Jonathan and his viper of a mother Judith setting her up?

The cab ride to the precinct passed in a blur of neon signs and honking cars. The interrogation room smelled of stale coffee and desperation.

"State your relationship to Jonathan Reeves." The detective's pen hovered over a notepad.

"We attended the same university. Later, I did part-time administrative work at his studio." Evelyn kept her voice steady despite the ice forming in her veins.

"Part-time?" The detective smirked. "Multiple witnesses claim you were romantically involved. Bank records show the studio used your identity for several loans. Care to explain?"

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. "I never authorized any of that."

"Miss Carter," the detective leaned forward, "we don't bring people in without evidence. Lying will only make this worse."

"Everything Jonathan did was without my knowledge or consent." Evelyn met his gaze squarely. "Check my employment records - no bonuses, no stock options. Just hourly wages."

The detective flipped a page. "Then how do you explain paying off a $2.3 million mortgage last month? Jonathan claims he gave you that money under the table."

A cold realization slithered down Evelyn's spine. That bank encounter. Jonathan's sudden interest in her after years of indifference. Not attraction - reconnaissance. Nathaniel had been right all along.

"That money came from my cousin," Evelyn said.

"You're listed as having no living relatives." The detective's eyebrow arched.

A familiar baritone voice cut through the tension. "She forgot to mention me."

Evelyn whirled to see Nathaniel Whitmore silhouetted in the doorway, his tailored suit looking more like armor than business attire. Behind him, two attorneys materialized with briefcases full of legal artillery.

"What are you doing here?" Evelyn hissed as Nathaniel steered her into the hallway.

"Jonathan told the police I assaulted him during that kidnapping farce." Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "His lawyer suggested dropping charges... if I help bury his financial crimes."

Evelyn's stomach churned. "That spineless—"

"Now you understand why I warned you about wolves in sheep's clothing?" Nathaniel's gaze burned into hers.

"You said there was no evidence!"

"Because there wasn't." Nathaniel adjusted his cufflinks with sharp precision. "Until your statement connected us. Now they're building a conspiracy case."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "I'll tell them I lied—"

"Don't." Nathaniel's hand closed around her wrist. "Your 'help' nearly got me arrested yesterday. From now on, my legal team handles everything. Stay silent."

Before Evelyn could protest, another voice sliced through the tension. "Actually, Miss Carter has her own representation."

A silver-haired attorney stepped forward, business card extended. The game had just gotten more complicated.
###Chapter 399

Evelyn froze at the familiar voice. She turned slowly to see Andrew standing there.

Her heart leaped with unexpected joy as she rushed toward him. "I thought you'd gone back to Nord City."

Just last week, Andrew had come all the way to North City to defend her honor against Jonathan's schemes.

Though she'd struck a deal with Jonathan to drop the matter, she assumed Andrew had returned to his busy practice.

Andrew reached out, ruffling her hair affectionately. "I had a case here. What perfect timing. Since Jonathan insists on being difficult, you shouldn't hold back anymore."

Memories of Nathaniel's revelations about Jonathan's manipulation and threats flashed through Evelyn's mind. Enough was enough.

She nodded decisively. "You're right. The hospital security footage and my medical records are still available. Filing charges should be straightforward."

Suddenly, she felt an intense gaze burning into her back.

Evelyn turned to meet Nathaniel's piercing stare. Lowering her eyes, she followed Andrew to file the official report.

From across the room, Nathaniel's attention fixed on the well-dressed man beside Evelyn. A lawyer?

His jaw tightened as he approached Robert. "Find out everything about that man."

Robert studied the stranger briefly before responding, "That appears to be Andrew Montgomery, Nord City's top litigator."

"The Montgomery family?" Nathaniel's brow furrowed at the mention of the powerful clan. Another Montgomery connection.

Of course.

Given Evelyn's relationship with Julian, it made sense the Montgomerys would get involved. Yet something felt... off.

Evelyn seemed unusually comfortable with the Montgomerys.

After completing her statement, Evelyn prepared to leave with Andrew, deliberately avoiding Nathaniel's gaze as they passed each other in the hallway.

Outside the police station, Evelyn exhaled deeply. Andrew hesitated before asking, "Evelyn, are you still... involved with Nathaniel?"

"No, it was just coincidence. You know I'm close to his grandmother. That's why he wanted to help."

"Is that really all there is?" Andrew pressed.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Why the sudden interest, Andrew?"

"According to my sources, you originally came here with Jonathan to accuse Nathaniel of assault. Yet today you recanted. Evelyn, what's really between you two?"

Evelyn's breath caught. She hadn't realized Andrew knew so much. There was no point denying it now.

She bit her lip. "I thought Jonathan was the victim, but I learned the truth. He deserved what happened, so I changed my testimony."

Andrew recognized her evasion but didn't push further. Still, he couldn't shake the sense of deeper history between Evelyn and Nathaniel.

As they returned to campus for her afternoon classes, an uneasy premonition settled over Evelyn. Something was coming. Something bad.
###Chapter 400

The school counselor approached Evelyn after her classes. "Evelyn, we're hosting a music festival next week and the administration wants to use your award-winning design concept. What do you think?"

"I'd be honored," Evelyn replied with quiet confidence.

This was perfect. As the lead designer, she'd have front-row access to all the performances. The thought sent a thrill through her.

"Here's the auditorium key." The counselor handed her a brass key. "Feel free to make any necessary modifications. The school wants to impress our special guests - the visiting musicians could help our seniors get recruited."

Evelyn nodded firmly. "I won't let the school down."

She clutched the key tightly. This was her chance to prove herself again.

"Just a warning," the counselor added. "The lead musician has a reputation for being... difficult. Try not to take it personally."

"Understood." Evelyn smiled politely.

Keys jingling, she headed straight to inspect the auditorium.

She'd barely begun her assessment when unfamiliar voices echoed through the empty space. The group's designer outfits marked them as outsiders.

"Ugh, this place is huge but so outdated," a female voice complained.

"I still don't get why we're performing at some no-name school," a man grumbled.

Evelyn froze. These must be the visiting musicians - and they sounded unpleasant.

She considered slipping out the side exit, but her foot caught a trash can, sending it clattering across the floor.

"Who's there?" a sharp voice demanded.

Evelyn took a steadying breath and stepped into view.

Her breath caught. Among the group stood Victoria Sinclair - her rival from the design competition.

Victoria's presence here made no sense. She'd disappeared after the competition's first round, rumored to have returned to Nord City.

A man in a floral shirt glared. "Are you some stalker trying to sneak photos?"

Evelyn straightened her shoulders. "I'm the student designer for the festival. I was assessing the space."

Victoria's lips curled. "Relax, Anthony. This is Evelyn Carter - first prize winner at the Fleur International. She's practically a celebrity."

Anthony scoffed. "Some country girl winning an art contest? Our orchestra performs at Carnegie Hall. This dump will ruin our reputation."

Evelyn noted their arrogance but couldn't deny their credentials. These were world-class musicians.

"Mr. Kensington," she said evenly, "do you have any specific requirements for the setup?"

"Can you even play piano?" he challenged.

Victoria laughed cruelly. "Don't be ridiculous. An orphan from the sticks? She's probably never seen a real piano before."
###Chapter 401

Evelyn heard Victoria’s taunts but chose to remain silent. Instead, she admitted, "You’re right. I don’t actually know how to play the piano."

"Why sugarcoat it? If you lack the skill, just admit it. Evelyn, is your pride that fragile? Why not confess that you can’t play?" Victoria sneered.

Before Evelyn could respond, Anthony, standing nearby, cut in. "It’s ridiculous to entrust the venue design to someone with no musical knowledge or piano skills."

"I’ll be discussing this with the college to find a more suitable replacement."

Evelyn stayed quiet, unable to ignore the smug gleam in Victoria’s eyes.

Victoria was trouble, always appearing wherever Evelyn went.

Anthony and his group walked away, their expressions dripping with contempt.

Victoria lingered, casting a triumphant look at Evelyn before remarking, "You’ve been on a lucky streak lately, Evelyn. But sorry to disappoint—I’m back now. Your fun is over."

She thought about how she’d had to rush to Nord City to tend to Eleanor, just to secure her position as the Montgomery family’s young lady.

Only by doing so had she managed to keep her status. Alexander no longer pressured her to sign the adoption termination agreement.

Now, Victoria was determined to eliminate Evelyn—that nobody—so she could marry Nathaniel without any obstacles.

With Nathaniel as her future husband, she’d soon forget about being the Montgomery heiress.

Evelyn smirked. "We’ll see about that."

After all, she had nothing to lose. She’d be leaving this place soon anyway.

With that, Evelyn walked past Victoria without so much as a glance.

Victoria stomped her foot in frustration before storming out of the hall.

Approaching Anthony, she said, "I recall there’s a special segment planned for this event—a student performance at the end, right?"

Anthony nodded. "Yes, the college recommended two candidates. We’ll select one to perform."

"But where’s the fun in that if it’s already decided? Given this college’s standards, we might as well draw lots."

"Any embarrassment would only reflect poorly on the institution."

Victoria had already devised a plan. She’d make sure Evelyn was chosen to perform.

Watching Evelyn flounder under the spotlight would be entertaining.

Then, Victoria could swoop in and save the situation.

It would be the perfect chance for Nathaniel to see how ordinary Evelyn was compared to her.

Back at home, Margaret had prepared a feast for Evelyn. "You must have been busy with schoolwork. Eat up," she urged.

After dinner, Evelyn turned to Christopher. "I want to learn a piano piece. Can you teach me?"

She felt an inexplicable urge to prove herself.

Christopher agreed, noticing her determination. "What’s sparked this sudden motivation?"

"Anthony, the head of the music team, doubts my piano skills and musical understanding. He thinks I’m unqualified for the project. That’s why I want to work harder."

She needed the credits for graduation.

Christopher frowned. "Anthony said that about you?"

He cursed Anthony inwardly. What was his problem?

He’d organized this event for Evelyn. How dare Anthony question her musical ability?

With her talent, how could she not understand music?

Evelyn nodded. "I want to lead this project. It offers a lot of credits, and I’m eager to try."

"Alright, Evelyn. I know you’ll succeed. Let’s rehearse the piece I taught you earlier," Christopher said with a smile, though his eyes darkened.

He’d confront Anthony later. What was his issue, anyway?
###Chapter 402

Evelyn couldn't believe Anthony Kensington had the nerve to suggest replacing her.

The audacity!

This music show was meant to be Christopher Montgomery's apology gift for her.

And now Anthony wanted to cut her out?

The next morning at university, Evelyn received a call from Adrian Blackwell, Jonathan Reeves' defense attorney.

"Mr. Reeves and Mrs. Dawson are proposing a settlement. What are your thoughts?"

"A settlement?" Evelyn scoffed. "Jonathan has the gall to ask for that? Where's his dignity? Even if I don't press charges, he's still going to jail for financial fraud."

Adrian cleared his throat. "My client hopes for your forgiveness, given your past relationship. If you could lend him the funds to cover his debts, he could avoid prison. He promises repayment upon release."

Evelyn laughed coldly. "Not interested. Any further discussions can go through my lawyer."

She hung up.

Jonathan wasn't worth another second of her time.

Later, Evelyn was summoned to Elizabeth Hartwell's office.

"Evelyn, the university wants to discuss the venue setup—"

"Professor Hartwell," Evelyn interrupted, "I still want to perform. I may not have formal training, but I love music. I understand the piano."

Elizabeth paused, then smiled.

"You're misunderstanding. The university isn't replacing you. However, due to Mr. Kensington's concerns, you'll receive private lessons at the Music School. A dedicated instructor will train you. Are you willing?"

"Absolutely," Evelyn answered without hesitation.

This was an opportunity she wouldn't refuse.

After her lectures, Evelyn headed to the Music School.

It was her first time in a class there. Her peers all carried an air of sophistication.

After the session, her piano instructor, Donovan Prescott, approached.

"You must be Evelyn. Come with me."

He led her to a private room.

"Do you have any experience with the piano?"

"A little," she admitted.

"Then play your favorite piece for me."

Evelyn sat at the grand piano, memories flooding back.

The song she had learned as a child at the orphanage, taught by the director, Walter Simmons.

He had always praised her talent, but there had been sadness in his voice.

She understood why now—she'd never had the chance to pursue it properly.

But things were different now.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn let her fingers glide across the keys, playing the melody from memory.

The music filled the building, rich and haunting.

Outside, Victoria Sinclair froze mid-step, Anthony Kensington beside her.

They had come to cause trouble, but the university clearly valued Evelyn.

Anthony had no choice but to let her stay—for now.

Victoria frowned. "Could we change the venue? Or postpone?"

That might be their only leverage.

Anthony shook his head. "No. Christopher called last night. He insisted the show happens here."

Victoria clenched her fists.

Christopher Montgomery never backed down.

Fine. Let Evelyn stay.

She'd humiliate herself at the show anyway.

Then—

Victoria's breath caught.

That melody.

Who was playing that piece here?

Could it be... her?
###Chapter 403

Victoria couldn’t suppress the rising tide of dread. Was it really her coming back?

But that couldn’t be.

She remembered clearly—she had made sure she would never return.

Yet, the haunting melody drifting through the halls sent chills down Victoria’s spine.

It hadn’t been Victoria whom the Montgomery family had originally sought. It had been Cassandra.

Blinded by envy, Victoria had orchestrated the perfect deception, stealing Cassandra’s identity and ensuring she would never learn the truth.

But Alexander had eventually uncovered the switch. Victoria had feigned ignorance, claiming she’d only met a girl like Cassandra at an orphanage years ago, unable to recall what had become of her.

In truth, that girl had been in the same orphanage as Victoria.

Her scheming had driven Cassandra away, adopted by another family before Alexander could ever find his real sister.

Alexander had brought Victoria into the Montgomery family, where she played the part of the amnesiac heiress flawlessly.

Over time, Victoria had almost convinced herself she was the true Montgomery heir.

Now, hearing that melody again, her blood ran cold.

The piece had been composed by Harrison to comfort the orphanage children—a secret only they knew.

Back then, none of the other children could play the piano except Cassandra, the real Montgomery heiress.

Harrison had adored her, praising her talent endlessly, always wishing for her to find a wealthy family.

Victoria had seethed with jealousy.

She, too, had dreamed of being adopted into luxury. But every time an opportunity arose, Harrison would only recommend Cassandra, leaving Victoria forgotten.

That bitterness had festered until she stole Cassandra’s life.

Later, she learned Cassandra’s adoptive family wasn’t rich—they had taken her in only because they couldn’t have children of their own.

For years, Victoria had reveled in her stolen wealth.

At first, she had lived in constant fear, terrified the Montgomerys would discover the truth and cast her out.

But as time passed, her worries faded. She began to believe she’d gotten away with it.

Now, hearing that melody—every note, every pause, exactly as she remembered—her breath caught.

It was her. Cassandra had returned.

Panicked, Victoria bolted through the halls, her hands trembling as she flung open doors, searching desperately.

The thought of the real heiress being found filled her with terror. It would ruin everything.

She had to protect her place in the Montgomery family. No matter what.

Upstairs, in a quiet classroom, Evelyn stopped playing and sighed. “I can’t remember much… just these few notes.”

When she was adopted as a child, she had fallen gravely ill, and most of her memories of the orphanage had faded.

But this melody—this one piece—remained sharp in her mind.

“It sounds like a lullaby. You played it beautifully. That’s a strong foundation,” Donovan said.

“What you need now is practice. Pick one piece to master. If Anthony tries to cause trouble, you’ll be ready.”

Evelyn nodded gratefully. “Thank you, Mr. Prescott.”

After a few more instructions, Donovan left her to practice alone.

Apart from this lullaby, Evelyn only knew the pieces Christopher had taught her.

Donovan had given her a few more to work on. But for now, this was all she had.
###Chapter 404

Evelyn decided to practice a new composition. Unfamiliar with the piece, she played at a slow tempo, her fingers stumbling over the keys.

Outside, Victoria scoured the building with growing desperation, checking every floor in a frantic search for the pianist whose music she had heard moments earlier.

But it was the end of classes, and the halls were filled with students practicing, making it nearly impossible for Victoria to identify the one she sought.

After an exhaustive search, Victoria resorted to adding senior students on WhatsApp, planning to investigate their backgrounds later.

Determining if any of them were orphans would be simple enough.

Breathless and exhausted, Victoria paused when an unfamiliar melody drifted from a nearby classroom. Pushing the door open, she found Evelyn seated at the piano.

Victoria froze.

At the sound of the door, Evelyn turned and saw Victoria standing there, disheveled and drenched in sweat, strands of hair clinging to her forehead.

Leaning against the doorframe, Victoria caught her breath, a cold smirk curling her lips.

"Trying to sneak in some practice, are you?" she taunted. "With your current skill, even a year wouldn’t be enough. You might as well quit now."

Recognizing Evelyn, Victoria assumed she had been motivated by Anthony’s praise the day before.

But having just heard Evelyn’s clumsy performance, Victoria was certain she posed no threat.

She was confident Evelyn would humiliate herself during the recital, making it effortless for Victoria to outshine her.

Without another word, Victoria turned and strode toward another classroom, determined to find the pianist she had heard earlier.

Evelyn ignored the jab, refocusing on her practice. She knew she still had time to improve.

After searching the entire building, Victoria had collected the contact information of over a hundred students.

Sitting on the stairs to catch her breath, she quickly dialed Gregory. "Can you run background checks on these people for me?"

If Victoria was going to locate the true heiress of the Montgomery family, she needed a plan to ensure they never crossed paths.

She couldn’t risk them recognizing her.

Her jaw clenched in determination. She had worked too hard to lose everything now.

Why should some be born into privilege while she had to claw her way up?

If fate had brought the real Montgomery heiress into her path, then fate would have to be dealt with.

If the girl was smart, Victoria might offer compensation—but she would never let her reclaim her place in the family.

After hours of practice, Evelyn returned home feeling defeated. Despite her efforts, she hadn’t improved as much as she’d hoped.

Frustrated, she couldn’t understand why she was struggling so much.

Christopher noticed her downcast expression. "What’s wrong? Did something happen at school?"

Had Anthony said something to upset her?

"I practiced some new pieces today," Evelyn admitted. "But I just couldn’t get them right."

"What did you play?" Christopher asked.

When Evelyn explained, he sighed. "Those pieces aren’t suited for you. It’s not your fault—everyone has their own style. Stick to what you know."

"Then what should I focus on?"

"The songs I’ve been teaching you. Master those first."

Evelyn nodded. The pieces she knew best were the childhood melodies and the ones Christopher had recently taught her.

She had intended to practice the sheet Donovan had given her, but it seemed beyond her current ability.

Then Christopher asked quietly, "Evelyn… do you still remember the orphanage?"
###Chapter 405

Evelyn hadn't anticipated Christopher bringing up her past. She shook her head slowly. "My memories are fragmented at best."

"Nothing concrete? Yet you remember that childhood piano piece perfectly," Christopher noted with narrowed eyes.

"I had a severe illness as a child." Evelyn's fingers absently traced the piano keys. "After the fever broke, my orphanage memories became... scattered."

She couldn't even picture Nathaniel's face clearly anymore - just fleeting impressions of piano duets and those elegant hands guiding hers.

Christopher knew the story well. When the Montgomery brothers first found Evelyn, their investigation had uncovered the truth. Margaret Dawson had confirmed it herself.

After being adopted by the Simmons family, Evelyn had nearly died from neglect-induced fever. Her miraculous recovery came with complete amnesia about the orphanage years.

"Evelyn," Christopher leaned against the grand piano, "do you recall having any close friends at the orphanage?"

Another head shake. "Why do you ask?" Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Are you suggesting I did?"

"Just curious." Christopher straightened abruptly. "You look exhausted. Rest now - we'll continue tomorrow."

He wasn't being entirely truthful. Since discovering Evelyn had been found in a different orphanage than Victoria claimed, doubts had festered.

Victoria's initial vague clues about Evelyn's whereabouts had sent Alexander Montgomery searching in wrong directions for years. The timing felt too convenient.

But with Evelyn's memories gone and Alexander finally cutting ties with Victoria, Christopher saw no reason to stir the past... unless Evelyn remembered on her own. Then Victoria would answer for everything.

In the following days, Evelyn divided her time between piano rehearsals and designing the concert hall decor.

Despite her packed schedule, she stole lunch hours to visit Eleanor Whitmore at the hospital. She'd promised frequent visits - breaking that promise might raise suspicions.

"Grandmother, you're looking stronger today," Evelyn greeted, setting down a fruit basket.

Eleanor, no longer ventilator-dependent, smiled weakly. "You're the one who looks worn thin, dear."

"Just end-of-term projects." Evelyn squeezed Eleanor's hand. "Nothing I can't handle."

"Remember you're caring for two now," Eleanor chided gently. "Don't neglect yourself."

After sharing lunch and light conversation, Evelyn departed. As she approached the elevators, a figure emerged from the emergency stairwell - Victoria Sinclair.

"Well if it isn't the Barrett family's little fraud," Victoria sneered. "Still sweet-talking your way into that old woman's will?"

Evelyn didn't flinch. "Bitterness ages you prematurely. Not a good strategy if you're still hoping to catch Nathaniel's eye."

Victoria's lips curled. "Enjoy your borrowed time. That hag won't live forever. Then we'll see who really belongs in the Whitmore family."

One elegant eyebrow arched. "Even if you paraded naked through Nathaniel's office, he'd still have security remove you. The canceled engagement should've been clue enough."
###Chapter 406

Victoria Sinclair's face twisted in displeasure. "Evelyn, I'm a wealthy heiress. You could never compare to someone like me."

Evelyn Carter arched a brow, her tone dripping with indifference. "You're right. I could never match your level of shamelessness."

With that, she stepped into the elevator, leaving Victoria fuming in the lobby.

Frustration bubbled inside Victoria as she stomped her foot. She had come to visit Eleanor Whitmore at the hospital, only to be blocked by security.

Yet Evelyn had strolled right past them without so much as a second glance.

The injustice of it made Victoria's blood boil.

Still, she consoled herself with the thought of Evelyn's impending humiliation at the college's music showcase.

She could already picture it—Evelyn fumbling over the piano keys, the audience whispering in pity.

The anticipation alone was delicious.

Meanwhile, Evelyn hailed a cab and headed back to campus.

Her phone buzzed mid-ride. Andrew Montgomery's name flashed on the screen.

"Evelyn, there's been a major update in Jonathan Reeves' case. The fraud charges against him have been confirmed."

His voice was steady. "He's looking at several years in prison. As for Judith Reeves, she's been sentenced to a year for assault."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. "I see. And what about the incident where Jonathan's leg was broken?"

She couldn't help but wonder how Nathaniel Whitmore had maneuvered his way out of that one.

Andrew hesitated. "There wasn't enough evidence to pursue it. Nathaniel isn't implicated."

"Of course not," Evelyn murmured. She had expected nothing less.

"Andrew, thank you for your help. I owe you coffee later. But right now, I need to rest before my afternoon lectures." She stifled a yawn.

"Take care of yourself, Evelyn. Don't push too hard," he replied before hanging up.

Once the call ended, Andrew stared at the documents in front of him.

The headline glared back at him: "Evelyn Carter is married to Nathaniel Whitmore."

The revelation had left him reeling all morning.

Suddenly, so many things made sense—the odd tension between Evelyn and Nathaniel, the way Nathaniel had mobilized every resource when Evelyn was kidnapped by Walter and Beverly Simmons.

Even Evelyn's evasiveness outside the police station now had an explanation.

Andrew straightened his tie and dialed Julian Montgomery. "Got a minute? I need to ask you something."

"If it's not about Evelyn, can it wait until after work?" Julian replied distractedly.

"It is about Evelyn. What's her connection to Nathaniel?"

A beat of silence. Then Julian sighed. "You found out, huh?"

Of course he had. As a lawyer, Andrew was bound to uncover the truth eventually.

Andrew's frown deepened. "You knew. Why didn't you tell us?"

"I found out by accident, and Evelyn begged me to keep it quiet. What was I supposed to do?"

Andrew exhaled sharply. "She must have suffered something terrible in that family to want a divorce."

"You think I don't know that? Evelyn is stubborn—she has her own plans. We've only just started building a real bond with her as her brothers."

Julian's voice turned firm. "If we push too hard, she'll just pull away."

Andrew's jaw tightened. "What did she get in the divorce? Money? Stocks? Properties—what assets does she have?"

Julian hesitated. "I don't know for sure. But given Evelyn's financial independence and her pride, she probably didn't ask for much."

As a top-tier lawyer with an impeccable reputation, the thought of Evelyn walking away with nothing after a divorce was unacceptable.

Andrew clenched his fists.

Nathaniel Whitmore wasn't going to get away with this.
###Chapter 407

Julian Montgomery frowned at Andrew's words. "You should discuss this with Evelyn first before making any decisions. What if she doesn't agree with your plan?"

"I can handle this on my own. Evelyn doesn’t need to be involved."

Andrew’s voice was firm. "After everything she’s endured—being mistreated and abandoned by the Whitmore family—I won’t stand by and do nothing. I refuse to let her walk away with nothing."

If Evelyn left the marriage empty-handed, then what was the point of Andrew being here?

"What I mean is, our family is more than capable of supporting her financially. She’ll be returning to Nord City soon. There’s no need to complicate things."

Julian sighed. "Besides, Evelyn has made it clear she wants nothing more to do with the Whitmores."

"This isn’t about complicating things. It’s about ensuring she gets what she deserves."

Andrew’s tone sharpened. "Otherwise, Nathaniel will think he can treat her however he pleases. Let me handle this. I’ll talk to Evelyn myself."

As one of Nord City’s top lawyers, Andrew believed that if Evelyn divorced without securing what was rightfully hers, then his reputation meant nothing.

Before, she had no one to rely on. Now, she had family.

Why should she suffer in silence?

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat through her afternoon lectures, an uneasy feeling settling in her chest. She couldn’t pinpoint why.

Later, she emailed the finalized design drafts to the university officials.

Given Anthony Kensington’s perfectionist standards and Victoria Sinclair’s interference, the task had been far from simple.

Evelyn wasn’t confident her designs would be approved. She had a sinking feeling they’d be sent back for revisions.

When Anthony received the drafts, he immediately forwarded them to Christopher Montgomery with a message:

"Mr. Montgomery, what do you think of these designs?"

Christopher barely glanced at them before replying sharply, "Why are you showing me this? Are you out of your mind? Who designed these?"

Anthony hesitated. "Mr. Montgomery, didn’t you specifically request to review the university’s submissions?"

He added, "I agree with your initial reaction. The designs seem amateurish. They’ll only slow us down. That’s why I suggested replacing Evelyn in the first place."

Wait—

Christopher suddenly straightened, his fingers flying over his phone as he called Anthony. "Hold on. Are you saying these are from the university?"

"Yes, they’re from Evelyn Carter," Anthony confirmed.

Christopher’s breath hitched.

Evelyn had designed these?

He cleared his throat, backtracking instantly. "Actually, on second thought, I might have been too hasty. These designs are impressive—full of energy and raw talent!"

Anthony blinked, baffled by the sudden shift. "I… I thought they were underdeveloped?"

Hadn’t Christopher just criticized them? Why the change of heart?

"Underdeveloped? Hardly." Christopher scoffed. "If you can’t appreciate originality, maybe you should keep quiet. This has character!"

He continued, "Evelyn’s a student. Her style might be unconventional, but that doesn’t make it tasteless. It fits the university’s vibe perfectly. I say we proceed as-is."

Anthony hesitated. "So… no revisions?"

"None. It’s perfect."

Christopher wouldn’t risk exhausting Evelyn with endless edits.

She had already spent countless hours practicing piano and refining these drafts.

Besides, this music showcase was for her. Even if she’d scribbled the designs on a napkin, he’d have approved them.

Anthony had no choice but to comply, though suspicion gnawed at him.

Was Christopher… interested in Evelyn?

It was the only explanation.
###Chapter 408

Christopher Montgomery had always been known as somewhat of a playboy.

Now it all made sense—why he suddenly organized a music showcase at the university and even endorsed such a youthful design concept.

But Christopher had never gone to such lengths for a woman before. He had never used his professional projects to impress anyone. Yet, Evelyn Carter seemed to be the exception.

Anthony Kensington couldn't shake the feeling that he had been too harsh on Evelyn. What if she became Christopher’s wife one day?

Later that afternoon, Evelyn was stunned to find her design draft approved without a single revision.

Disbelieving, she double-checked with Elizabeth Hartwell multiple times. Elizabeth’s response remained unchanged: "Evelyn, you should trust your talent."

"After all, you were the first-place winner in the Fleur International Design Competition. The university has high expectations for you."

"I understand. I’ll do my best," Evelyn replied, her cheeks warming at the praise.

When she arrived home in a daze, Christopher was already there, watching her with a tentative smile. "Evelyn, how did the review go? Approved?"

Still slightly dazed, Evelyn nodded eagerly. "First try, no revisions. I was prepared to make changes, so this was a surprise."

Christopher gently ruffled her hair, his smile widening. "Happy?"

"Of course! Now I can start decorating the hall right away. There’s still enough time."

After a quick dinner, Evelyn retreated to her room to finalize the hall’s decor.

She realized she’d have to work tirelessly tomorrow—otherwise, she’d fall behind schedule.

Watching her dedication, Christopher couldn’t help but smile. As long as she was happy, nothing else mattered.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived on campus early to begin decorating.

By noon, she was so absorbed in her work that dizziness hit her. Only when her stomach growled in protest did she finally pause to order food.

After eating, she felt slightly better.

"Tsk, tsk. This setup is underwhelming. How did Anthony even approve such a mediocre design?" Victoria Sinclair sneered.

Penelope Whitmore smirked. "Isn’t it obvious? Maybe Evelyn persuaded him in some special way."

Victoria’s grin widened. "Penelope, we shouldn’t make accusations without proof."

Penelope scoffed. "What more proof do we need? Everyone knows how Evelyn earned her place in the Whitmore family."

Evelyn set down her tools sharply.

"I was wondering what that awful smell was. Turns out, it’s just the two of you. I thought a sewer pipe had burst."

Penelope’s face twisted. "Who are you calling foul? Did we lie? You did use dirty tricks to get your design approved, didn’t you?"

Evelyn’s expression turned icy. "Spreading rumors has consequences, Penelope. Remember that."

"Please. Everyone already knows the truth. I’ll make sure the entire campus hears about your little hotel rendezvous with Anthony last night. My friend saw it firsthand—don’t even try denying it."

Evelyn nodded calmly and pulled out her phone, dialing the police.

"Hello? I’d like to report defamation. I’ve been falsely accused of misconduct, and I have two witnesses here who can attest to the slander."
###Chapter 409

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she dialed the emergency number, her piercing gaze never leaving Victoria and Penelope.

Penelope's lips curled into a smug smirk. "Why bother calling the police? Do you really want the whole world to know about your little rendezvous with Mr. Kensington?"

Victoria's face paled. She hadn't anticipated Evelyn would actually involve the authorities!

A cold smile played on Evelyn's lips. "You both saw everything, didn't you? You'll need to give your statements to the police. How else are we going to track down Anthony?"

Victoria caught on quickly, her voice laced with irritation. "Must you drag the police into every petty dispute? When will this nonsense end?"

Evelyn's eyes flashed with defiance. "Why wouldn't I call them? Especially when I have no memory of the events you're accusing me of."

"If Penelope truly has a friend who claims to have seen me at that hotel, then it's obvious I was drugged and taken there against my will."

"Whoever is behind this will pay dearly."

Even Penelope, usually so dense, finally grasped the gravity of the situation.

Her claims about a witness spotting Evelyn with Anthony at the hotel were nothing but lies, fabricated to ruin Evelyn's reputation.

But now, with the police involved, the truth would inevitably come to light if an investigation was launched.

Evelyn's smirk turned icy. "Once Mr. Kensington arrives, we can settle this face-to-face."

Panic flickered in Penelope's eyes. What had she gotten herself into?

Victoria's frown deepened. This was spiraling out of control. How could Penelope be so foolish as to hand Evelyn such an advantage?

If this escalated, it could damage Victoria's standing with Anthony. And if that happened, how could she expect him to help her take Evelyn down?

Victoria shot Penelope a sharp look and hissed under her breath, "Penelope, you need to clarify things. Making baseless accusations won't help anyone."

Penelope hesitated. Her earlier words had only been meant to humiliate Evelyn.

Leaning closer, Victoria whispered urgently, "If Mr. Kensington finds out you lied, you can forget about meeting those famous pianists. It's better to end this now."

Penelope swallowed hard, then turned to Evelyn with reluctant resignation. "I—I just remembered, I only heard rumors. I didn’t actually see you with Mr. Kensington."

"Then you can explain that to the police," Evelyn replied coolly, already turning away to resume decorating the hall.

Victoria's voice stopped her. "Evelyn, Penelope was just joking earlier. There's no need to involve the police."

"If this gets out, the paparazzi will have a field day. It’ll tarnish both the university and the Music School’s reputation."

Though it pained her to back down, Victoria couldn’t risk the police digging deeper.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Oh? So it's just a joke when you're not the one being slandered. How convenient."

"What do you want?" Victoria ground out between clenched teeth.

Evelyn glanced pointedly at Penelope. "The one who spread the lies should apologize."

"I won’t!" Penelope snapped immediately. Apologize to Evelyn? Never.

Victoria exhaled sharply before pulling Penelope aside. "Penelope, remember—the Music School belongs to Christopher."

"If this escalates and my brothers find out, it won’t reflect well on you. How do you expect to marry into the Montgomery family then?"
###Chapter 410

Evelyn's words sent Penelope into a rage.

The thought of this upstart ruining her carefully laid plans to marry into the prestigious Whitmore family was unbearable.

Clenching her fists, Penelope forced herself to approach Evelyn. "I... apologize for my earlier remarks," she ground out between clenched teeth. "It was just foolish chatter. Pay it no mind."

Evelyn studied Penelope with cool detachment. "You know perfectly well these accusations are groundless, yet you spread them with such conviction. What kind of woman stoops to such malice?"

Penelope swallowed her fury, knowing she had to maintain composure. One wrong move now could destroy everything.

Victoria quickly intervened. "Evelyn, Penelope has apologized. Surely you can explain to the authorities that this was all a misunderstanding?"

Evelyn remained unmoved. "I'll speak with the police when they arrive. But first, Penelope, there's something you can do for me."

She gestured toward the tangled mass of decorative lights nearby. "Help me move these from the ground floor to the upper level. Consider it proof of your sincerity."

Penelope's control snapped. "How dare you order me about!"

Victoria grabbed her arm before she could say more.

Defeated, Penelope muttered, "What exactly do you need done?"

"It's simple," Evelyn replied, crossing her arms. "You and Victoria will carry all these lights upstairs without assistance. Do that, and I'll explain everything favorably to the authorities. Fair?"

Watching their casual dismissal of their vicious rumors, Evelyn wondered why they should escape consequences so easily.

Penelope, unaccustomed to physical labor, reluctantly lifted the heavy bundle of lights. Her designer heels clicked angrily against the stairs as she ascended. "These stairs are treacherous! And I'm ruining my new Louboutins!"

Victoria made no move to help. "No need to hurry, darling," she called sweetly.

Evelyn's expression hardened. "If those lights aren't moved before I return, I'll have quite the story for the police."

Panic flashed across Penelope's face. "But how am I supposed to—"

"That's your concern," Evelyn cut in, already walking away. "Fail to complete the task, and the consequences are yours to bear."

Penelope stamped her foot. "Victoria, you'll help me with this!"

Seeing no alternative, Victoria reluctantly removed her own expensive shoes. "This better be worth it," she muttered.

From a discreet corner, Evelyn watched the two socialites struggle with the lights, their perfect hair now disheveled, their designer clothes smudged with dust. She couldn't resist recording the priceless scene on her phone.

An hour later, Evelyn returned to find Victoria and Penelope collapsed in chairs, their makeup streaked with sweat.

Victoria gasped, "What did you tell the police? Why haven't they come?"

Evelyn blinked innocently. "Oh, I never actually called them."

Victoria's mouth fell open in outrage. She'd been played—again!
###Chapter 411

Evelyn couldn't help but notice the darkening expressions on Victoria and Penelope's faces after her revelation.

Penelope's voice trembled with barely contained fury. "You're telling me you never actually called the police?"

Evelyn shrugged nonchalantly. "That's right. It was just a little bluff to rattle you."

The words sent Penelope flying out of her chair, her face flushed with rage. "Evelyn Carter, I've had it with your games!"

Her manicured nails dug into the table. "Do you have any idea how exhausting it was hauling all those lights upstairs? And now you admit it was all for nothing?"

Evelyn took a graceful step back, her lips curving. "You should be thanking me. If I'd actually called them, you'd be explaining stolen property to officers right now."

She tilted her head. "Given how things turned out today, does it really matter?"

Penelope froze, realization dawning—she'd been played.

Victoria looked equally furious but too drained to continue. Clutching her designer heels, she stood with a wince. "Let's go. My spine feels like it's about to snap."

"Same. These blisters are killing me." Penelope sighed dramatically. "I need a spa day after this nightmare."

Victoria waved a dismissive hand. "Agreed. We're done here."

Before leaving, Penelope shot Evelyn a venomous glare. "This isn't over."

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Do come back anytime."

She watched with amusement as the two women hobbled away, their earlier arrogance reduced to pained grimaces. The sight was deeply satisfying.

Would they dare cause more trouble? Evelyn doubted it. Between finalizing hall decorations and preparing for the show, she had zero patience for their antics.

Let them stay gone. But if they returned? She wouldn't hold back.

Later, while scrolling through the event's VIP list in the group chat, one name made her pause—Nathaniel Whitmore.

Her finger hovered over his name. Since when did a busy CEO attend college music shows?

Meanwhile, at Whitmore Enterprises...

Nathaniel strode from the conference room, issuing crisp orders to his team.

Back in his office, Robert approached with an envelope. "Sir, you've received an invitation to Halvard University's music showcase."

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened as he examined it. "This is Christopher Montgomery's department, correct?"

Robert cleared his throat. "Indeed."

Nathaniel studied the invitation. "What's Evelyn's role in this event?"

The memory of Evelyn leaving that hotel with Christopher still burned.

Robert hesitated. "From what I gathered, Ms. Carter is handling venue design this year. Her proposal was approved without revisions."

A muscle twitched in Nathaniel's jaw. He hadn't expected Christopher to be so... persuasive.

A knock interrupted them. A secretary entered. "Mr. Whitmore, a visitor—Andrew Montgomery. He's representing Ms. Carter as legal counsel."

The air turned glacial.

Nathaniel's voice dropped dangerously. "Send him in."

Robert suppressed a shiver. Why did everything escalate at once?

Minutes later, Andrew entered—impeccable in a tailored suit, briefcase in hand. Behind his gold-rimmed glasses, his calm gaze met Nathaniel's like a silent challenge.
###Chapter 412

Nathaniel leaned back in his leather chair, his piercing gaze fixed on Andrew standing across from him.

The silence stretched between them like a taut wire.

Andrew finally extended a crisp business card across the polished mahogany desk.

"I'm from Montgomery & Associates in Northridge. I'm representing Ms. Carter regarding your divorce proceedings."

Nathaniel barely glanced at the card before pushing it aside. "What exactly does Evelyn want now?"

Andrew smoothly produced a thick folder from his briefcase, spreading the documents across the desk.

"This outlines the proposed asset division. I suggest you review it carefully, Mr. Whitmore."

Nathaniel didn't even look at the papers. "She swore she wouldn't take a dime. What changed?"

Evelyn hadn't just changed her mind - she'd sent the Montgomery family's top attorney to negotiate!

The woman had certainly stepped up her game.

Andrew suppressed a smirk. Just as Julian predicted, Evelyn genuinely hadn't wanted anything.

But as a seasoned divorce attorney, Andrew knew money was the best leverage. He'd make Nathaniel pay dearly.

"The reasons don't matter," Andrew said smoothly. "For an amicable divorce, I recommend signing as is."

Nathaniel snatched the papers without reading, scrawling his signature violently across the last page before shoving them back.

"Tell Evelyn this is her last chance to change her mind," he growled. "I won't be so accommodating next time."

Andrew arched an eyebrow at the signature. "You're not even going to read it?"

"Nothing in there interests me," Nathaniel snapped.

Typical Nathaniel - always brutally direct.

Andrew nodded, leaving one copy on the desk. "Per the agreement, you'll need to begin transfers within 48 hours."

Nathaniel simply flicked the documents toward Robert. "Handle it."

As Andrew packed up, he shot Nathaniel a final look. "At least you're ending this marriage with some dignity."

Nathaniel's stony silence spoke volumes.

Once Andrew left, Robert scanned the agreement and went pale. "Sir... shouldn't you review this?"

Did Nathaniel realize he was signing away his entire fortune?

After her last lecture, Evelyn checked her watch and hurried toward campus gates.

Exhausted from back-to-back classes, she craved an early night.

At the entrance, she spotted Andrew leaning against a sleek black sedan.

"Evelyn!" he called.

She jogged over. "Andrew? What are you doing here?"

He handed her a takeout bag. "Thought you might be hungry. Traffic's terrible this time of day."

"Thanks," she smiled, sliding into the passenger seat.

Her fingers brushed against a leather briefcase. "Coming from work?"

"Just wrapped up a divorce case," Andrew said casually as he pulled into traffic. "Go ahead, take a look."

Evelyn froze, sudden dread coiling in her stomach.

She pulled out the documents, her breath catching at "Asset Division Agreement."

As her eyes flew down the staggering list of holdings being transferred to her name, all color drained from her face.
###Chapter 413

Evelyn hesitated for a moment before speaking. "Andrew, are you serious?"

"I don't joke about matters like this," Andrew replied firmly.

A knot of unease twisted in Evelyn's stomach. "Then... you must not have gone to see Nathaniel yet, have you?"

"I just did. I came straight here to pick you up afterward," Andrew answered.

Dread pooled in Evelyn's chest.

If only she had clarified everything with Andrew sooner, none of this would be happening.

She turned to him, frustration lacing her voice. "Andrew, why didn't you tell me about something this important?"

"Evelyn, this is my job. You shouldn’t have to worry about any of it."

"Walking away from a marriage with nothing is unacceptable. Demanding what you’re owed doesn’t make you greedy."

"Those are just toxic ideals men push on women to make them feel guilty for valuing financial security. In the end, it’s always the men who benefit," Andrew explained.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I know you’re trying to protect me, but my situation with Nathaniel is more complicated than most divorces."

"There’s no difference, Evelyn. Trust me," Andrew reassured her. "I’ll make sure you get everything you’re entitled to."

Exhaustion weighed on her as she murmured, "Andrew, these terms you’ve laid out—Nathaniel transferring all his shares to me, millions in cash, multiple properties, stakes in subsidiaries—how did you even uncover all this?"

Of course, Evelyn knew the Whitmore family’s wealth was staggering.

Nathaniel’s shares alone were worth a fortune.

How could she possibly demand control of the entire Whitmore Group?

Andrew smirked. "Have you forgotten what I do for a living?"

"Andrew, there’s no way the Whitmores would agree to this," Evelyn said skeptically.

Andrew shrugged. "Nathaniel already did."

What?

Evelyn froze. "Nathaniel agreed? That’s impossible!"

"He even signed it. See for yourself," Andrew insisted.

Evelyn flipped to the last page—and there it was. Nathaniel’s bold, unmistakable signature.

Now she was completely lost.

How could he have agreed?

Was he out of his mind?

Andrew glanced at the traffic light ahead. "For all his flaws, Nathaniel is surprisingly generous when it comes to your divorce."

"He signed without even reading the terms. Seems he trusts you a great deal."

Evelyn thought bitterly, Of course he didn’t read it. Just as I expected.

Given Nathaniel’s personality, it made no sense for him to agree to such extreme demands.

She struggled to find words. "How did the conversation go? Why would he sign without even looking?"

This wasn’t like Nathaniel at all.

Andrew arched a brow. "I drafted it this way as a negotiation tactic, never expecting him to agree. But he signed it blindly."

"He probably assumed it was the settlement you prepared. That’s why I said he must trust you."

Evelyn was stunned. Had she really underestimated Nathaniel’s trust in her?

As she stared at the signed agreement, emotions tangled inside her.

"Evelyn, you don’t need to deal with any of this. I’ll handle everything," Andrew assured her.

"Andrew, there’s something you don’t know. Before marrying Nathaniel, I signed a prenup. None of these assets are legally mine."

"What?"

Andrew jerked the car to the side of the road, his eyes wide with disbelief. "Evelyn, tell me you didn’t."

"I did," she admitted.

Andrew cursed under his breath. "No wonder Nathaniel signed so easily. He was expecting this all along, wasn’t he?"
###Chapter 414

It appeared Nathaniel had outmaneuvered Benjamin, the renowned attorney from Northridge.

Evelyn placed a comforting hand on Benjamin's arm. "Benjamin, this isn't your failure. I never expected anything from this arrangement anyway. Let's just leave it be."

Benjamin remained silent, the bitter taste of defeat heavy on his tongue.

"Promise me you won't confront Nathaniel about the settlement," Evelyn pleaded, her voice barely above a whisper. "All I want is to cut all ties with the Whitmore family."

Nothing else mattered now. Not when she carried her most precious treasures—the twins growing safely within her.

As Benjamin met Evelyn's pleading gaze, he exhaled sharply.

Suddenly, he understood Julian's warning about never being able to refuse Evelyn.

Now, he too found himself powerless against her requests.

Yet even as he agreed, a simmering sense of injustice burned in his chest.

After organizing the paperwork, Evelyn returned home, maintaining her carefully constructed facade of normalcy.

Only when night fell, after dinner and tucked safely in bed, did she finally examine the divorce settlement documents.

Steeling herself, she dialed Nathaniel's number. The line rang endlessly with no answer.

Unbeknownst to her, Nathaniel sat secluded in a VIP lounge of an upscale bar, surrounded by an alarming number of empty liquor bottles.

When Gregory arrived, the scene before him made his blood run cold.

"Nat," Gregory's voice held barely concealed alarm as he took in the wreckage of the room, "what the hell happened?"

It had been years since he'd seen Nathaniel consume alcohol like this.

Sinking onto the leather couch, Gregory quipped, "Did the apocalypse start and nobody told me?"

Nathaniel's tie hung loose around his neck, his dress shirt unbuttoned to reveal his collarbones. The usually impeccable businessman looked utterly disheveled.

Without a word, he drained another glass of burgundy liquid before muttering something unintelligible.

Alarmed, Gregory grabbed Robert by the arm. "Explain. Now."

"Mr. Whitmore is facing financial ruin," Robert confessed.

Gregory's eyebrows shot up. "That's impossible. The Whitmore empire doesn't just collapse. Why wasn't I informed?"

"The divorce settlement was finalized today."

"That shouldn't bankrupt him."

Robert hesitated. "He transferred all his shares to Ms. Carter."

Gregory's glass slipped from his fingers, shattering against the marble floor. "He did what? Has he lost his damn mind?"

As Robert recounted the events, even he seemed stunned by how things had unfolded.

Gregory turned to Nathaniel, his voice sharp. "There's still room to negotiate with legal counsel."

"Besides, Evelyn signed a prenup. She wasn't entitled to anything. Are you seriously just surrendering like this?"

This wasn't the ruthless Nathaniel Whitmore he knew!

Nathaniel set down his glass, the remaining wine staining his lips crimson. His eyes darkened as he rasped, "You don't understand."

"Damn right I don't! How could you sign without reviewing the terms?"

"You're the most meticulous bastard I know. This isn't like you."

Gregory was genuinely baffled.

Nathaniel slumped deeper into the couch cushions, his voice rough. "You think I have answers?"

"You signed the damn papers! What were you thinking?"

"I wasn't thinking at all."

Nathaniel's grip tightened around his glass, his knuckles turning white. Never in his life had a woman caused him to make such a catastrophic mistake.

The realization of Evelyn's power over him—that's what terrified him most.

Gregory studied his friend carefully before voicing the dangerous thought. "Nathaniel... are you in love with Evelyn?"
###Chapter 415

Nathaniel's dark eyes widened in shock as the words sank in.

His response came instantly, sharp and defensive. "Absolutely not!"

The mere suggestion that he might harbor feelings for Evelyn was absurd.

Gregory's voice turned stern. "If you truly don't care for Evelyn, why are you so vulnerable around her? Your subconscious trusts her more than you realize."

He leaned forward, pressing further. "And let's not forget—this divorce has dragged on for months. She's moved on with other men, yet you've tolerated it. Is that fair to you?"

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line, his expression cooling. "I'm doing this for Grandmother Eleanor."

Gregory scoffed. "Before her surgery, everyone assumed Evelyn would use the situation to cling to you."

His tone sharpened. "But the surgery is over. Why hasn't the divorce been finalized?"

A pause. Then, pointedly: "And when Evelyn's lawyer presented the property settlement, you signed without even reviewing the terms."

His gaze bore into Nathaniel. "Tell me that wasn't spite."

Nathaniel frowned. "Spite?"

Gregory crossed his arms. "You signed because you were angry—angry that Evelyn initiated the divorce, angry she drafted the agreement without consulting you."

His voice dropped. "That sounds like unresolved feelings to me."

Nathaniel fell silent. Gregory's words struck a nerve. Ever since signing those papers, he'd noticed something unsettling—his attention kept drifting back to Evelyn.

But it made no sense.

"Nat, drowning yourself in alcohol won't solve anything," Gregory said firmly.

Nathaniel lifted his gaze. "You think I should find her?"

"Yes. Immediately."

Nathaniel's fingers tightened around the wine bottle, unease coiling in his chest. "I... need to sort out my feelings first."

Gregory blinked, taken aback.

He stared at Nathaniel in disbelief. "I suggested you see Evelyn to discuss the settlement—not your emotions. That's something I can't help you with."

Gregory couldn't fathom it. Nathaniel was on the brink of financial ruin, yet his mind was fixated on Evelyn.

Nathaniel looked away, his expression shifting uncomfortably. "This can wait."

"Wait?" Gregory's voice rose. "You're about to lose everything! If your ancestors knew you were handing over company shares in a divorce, they'd—"

Nathaniel swirled the wine calmly. "Evelyn isn't that kind of person. She wouldn't take what's mine."

Gregory's patience frayed. "Then why did her lawyer push for the settlement?"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched at the mention of the lawyer. "The terms were problematic. Evelyn likely didn't know."

If Evelyn had truly wanted his assets, she would have demanded them long ago.

Before this, Nathaniel had even prepared his own settlement—only for Evelyn to refuse everything and tear it up.

There was no way these unreasonable terms had come from her.

Gregory's lips twitched. "You trust her that much?"

"It's not just her. It's Grandmother Eleanor's judgment too," Nathaniel insisted.

Gregory nearly rolled his eyes. Using Eleanor as an excuse again?

Only a fool would believe that.

With a sigh, he asked the obvious. "Then who is this lawyer?"
###Chapter 416

"Andrew Montgomery." Nathaniel Whitmore said.

"Another Montgomery?" Gregory Thornton raised an eyebrow. "You mentioned Evelyn's closeness to Julian before. Could the Montgomerys have some hidden agenda against your family?"

Nathaniel swirled his wine glass before taking a sip. "Not against my family. Against Evelyn herself."

"Let me tell you something, Nate," Gregory leaned in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "If you've developed feelings for Evelyn—and considering you two haven't finalized the divorce yet—it wouldn't be hard to keep her by your side."

"After all, she used to worship the ground you walked on, playing the perfect devoted wife. If you just show her a little attention, won’t she come running back?"

Nathaniel’s mind flashed to Evelyn’s recent words: "If you replace your boyfriend fast enough, you won’t have time to be sad."

"As long as your new man measures up, you’ll forget your ex in no time."

His jaw tightened. "She’s not that easily swayed anymore."

Ever since Nathaniel had brought up divorce, Evelyn had transformed into someone unrecognizable—distant, untouchable.

Gregory clicked his tongue. "Are you seriously considering coaxing her back? Just admit it—you’ve fallen for her."

The truth was painfully obvious.

Nathaniel cleared his throat. "I just think whether we divorce or not doesn’t matter much."

"Grandmother Eleanor adores her, and I don’t have strong feelings about marriage either way. It’s not a big deal."

Gregory scoffed. "You’re lying to yourself. If you truly felt that way, why file for divorce in the first place?"

Nathaniel hesitated. "At the time, I thought keeping Evelyn tied to the Whitmore name for three years was unfair."

"A woman like her shouldn’t waste her life in a loveless marriage. She deserved a fresh start."

Gregory countered immediately, "Then why are you stopping her from leaving now?"

He couldn’t understand Nathaniel’s stubborn denial.

Setting his wine glass down, Nathaniel finally admitted, "Because Evelyn is pregnant."

Gregory choked on his drink, coughing violently as he gaped at Nathaniel. "Yours?"

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Probably not."

"What do you mean, probably not? Wait—are you saying the baby is Julian’s?" Gregory’s voice rose in disbelief. "With all this, shouldn’t you be speeding up the divorce? Why would you want to deal with this mess?"

Nathaniel shrugged, feigning indifference. "I don’t care about the child."

"Before, I lied about Evelyn being pregnant to convince Grandmother Eleanor to undergo surgery."

"Now that she’s recovering, the truth about the fake pregnancy would’ve come out eventually. But now, Evelyn is actually pregnant."

"Even if the child isn’t mine, I can overlook it—for Grandmother’s sake."

Gregory stared at him like he’d lost his mind. "Nathaniel, are you serious?"

Signing divorce papers was one thing. But willingly raising another man’s child? That was something else entirely.

It was clear—Nathaniel still loved Evelyn.

No man would endure this if he didn’t.

Ignoring Gregory’s shock, Nathaniel checked his phone and saw a missed call from Evelyn. He didn’t return it.

His lips thinned. She was probably calling about the divorce agreement they’d discussed earlier.

Gregory leaned closer. "Who called? Evelyn?"

"Yeah. I didn’t answer."

Nathaniel stared at his screen, his voice low and hesitant. "…Should I call her back?"
###Chapter 417

Nathaniel stared at the missed call notification, his fingers hovering over the screen. He could already imagine why Evelyn was trying to reach him.

Gregory hesitated before responding, "It's your call."

Nathaniel frowned, his expression conflicted. "What if she asks about the divorce settlement? What do I say?"

Gregory sighed, rubbing his temples. "Just answer honestly. Or don’t. Either way, you’re digging your own grave here."

The situation was undeniably tense.

After a long pause, Nathaniel set his phone down without returning the call.

Gregory raised an eyebrow. "You’re not going to call her back?"

Nathaniel smirked, though there was a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. "Let her come to me first."

"You really think that’s a good idea?"

"With the amount of money she just inherited, she won’t be able to sleep tonight. She’ll reach out," Nathaniel said, though he knew Evelyn wasn’t the type to be swayed by wealth.

Gregory exhaled sharply, shaking his head.

At first, he had assumed Nathaniel’s feelings for Evelyn were fleeting—just another passing infatuation.

But now, watching Nathaniel’s stubbornness, it was clear his emotions ran much deeper than Gregory had realized.

The next morning, Evelyn woke up and immediately checked her phone.

Still no response from Nathaniel.

She had tried calling him last night, but when he didn’t answer, she assumed he was in a meeting. She had waited, expecting him to call back, but eventually, exhaustion overtook her.

Now, with the morning light streaming through her window, she was met with the same silence.

What was Nathaniel thinking?

He had to know the divorce agreement had granted her full control of Whitmore Enterprises, stripping him of his power.

Yet, he didn’t seem the least bit concerned.

Meanwhile, Evelyn couldn’t shake her unease. These weren’t assets she had any right to claim.

Worse, if word got out about the sudden shift in shares, it could destabilize the company’s stock.

And if Eleanor found out? The truth about their divorce would be exposed.

No—she had to handle this carefully.

Evelyn headed straight to campus that morning.

With the music showcase approaching, she needed to oversee the final preparations herself.

She couldn’t afford any last-minute sabotage, especially not from Victoria Sinclair.

The university had spared no expense for the event, and the setup was nearly complete.

Evelyn surveyed the hall, satisfied with the progress. Most of the decorations were in place, leaving just minor details to finalize.

At noon, she made her way to the music building to practice.

And of course, she ran straight into Victoria.

Evelyn suppressed a groan. Why did it feel like Victoria was always lurking wherever she went?

Victoria smirked. "Here to practice in secret again, Evelyn? You should really give up."

Charlotte Ellington, standing beside her, added with a sneer, "Why embarrass yourself? You’ll never compare to the real musicians here."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Do you know why Edwin Girod’s grandfather lived so long?"

Victoria blinked. "What does that have to do with anything?"

Charlotte scoffed. "Yeah, what’s your point?"

Evelyn smiled sweetly. "Because he minded his own business."

Then she walked past them without another word.
###Chapter 418

"Honestly, it's none of your concern, and you have no right to interfere!" Evelyn snapped before striding purposefully toward the academic building.

Victoria clenched her fists, watching Evelyn's retreating figure with barely concealed frustration. "Evelyn Carter, you better stop right there and explain yourself!"

Evelyn glanced over her shoulder, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "Nathaniel's grandfather lived a long life because he knew when to stay out of other people's business. Whether I learn or not is my choice—not yours."

With that, she continued walking, a faint smirk playing on her lips as she dismissed Victoria's earlier insults.

Playing the piano had always been nothing more than a personal indulgence for Evelyn.

She had no interest in competitions or performing in the upcoming showcase. Her only goal was to reclaim the childhood joy that had been stolen from her.

Though her early memories had faded with time, the familiar notes of the piano stirred fragments of the past she thought she'd lost.

Evelyn headed straight to an empty classroom on the fourth floor. Taking a deep breath, she let her fingers dance across the keys, playing the melody from memory.

This lullaby always brought her an inexplicable sense of peace.

The room filled with the soft, melancholic notes of the piano, blending seamlessly with the distant harmonies of other instruments echoing through the halls.

Victoria froze mid-step, her expression twisting as she recognized the hauntingly familiar tune.

Her voice came out strained. "Did you hear that?"

Charlotte frowned, confused. "Hear what, Ms. Sinclair? There are multiple instruments playing—classes are still in session—"

"No, the piano. That lullaby. Who usually plays it?"

Victoria had previously tasked Gregory with investigating everyone she'd added on social media.

Yet none of them matched the person she was searching for, and all claimed ignorance about the lullaby's existence.

Still, there was no mistaking it—the melody was unmistakable.

Despite her frequent visits to this part of campus, she hadn’t heard the tune again—until now.

For a moment, doubt crept in. Had she imagined it? Was her mind playing tricks on her?

But this time, the music was real.

Victoria quickly pulled out her phone and recorded the faint strains of the piano, barely audible beneath the other instruments.

Yet to her, it stood out like a beacon.

That melody—she would recognize it anywhere.

Charlotte hesitated before speaking. "If you're looking for the person who plays that piece, maybe I can help? I've been around this university for years. I might know who it is."

Victoria forced a smile. "Yes, I'm searching for a childhood friend. We were inseparable, but life tore us apart."

Her voice softened with fabricated nostalgia. "This lullaby... it was something only the two of us knew. A secret between us."

"What's your friend's name, Ms. Sinclair?"

"She was a girl I met while volunteering at an orphanage."

Victoria carefully omitted the truth—that she, too, had grown up in that orphanage.

As her gaze fixed on the building ahead, a shadow flickered in her eyes.

Now, she was certain.

The true heiress of the Sinclair family was inside.
###Chapter 419

Evelyn Carter stood frozen before the grand building, the haunting melody of the piano intertwining with other instruments, sending chills down her spine.

It awakened a primal fear she had buried deep within.

Ever since she had deceived her way into the Montgomery family, nightmares plagued her—visions of the true heiress being discovered, while she was stripped of everything and thrown back into the gutters of poverty.

A dark shadow flickered in Evelyn’s eyes. She would never return to that life. Never.

She had to find the real heiress before the Montgomerys did. No matter the cost.

This was the only way to secure her place—to ensure the rightful heir never had the chance to reclaim what was hers.

The music stopped abruptly.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her back damp with cold sweat. Sleep had been elusive lately.

If the Montgomerys uncovered the truth before she did, it would be the end of her.

Meanwhile, in the practice room, Mia finished her piano session and made her way to the hall to oversee the final preparations.

Today was crucial—the last adjustments before the event. She needed everything to be flawless.

As she entered, she spotted a small crowd gathered, including Elizabeth Hartwell.

Elizabeth smiled warmly when she saw her. "I was just about to call you, but Mr. Winslow mentioned you were in the study hall. Didn’t want to disturb you."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Oh, you could’ve called anytime. It’s no trouble."

"Well, we have some VIP guests arriving soon, and we need someone to host them."

"Since you’re handling the hall design, your presence would be ideal. You’d know all the details if they have questions."

"Of course. No problem at all."

As she followed Elizabeth inside, she nearly collided with Theodore Winslow, who had just arrived.

"Evelyn, have you finished your tasks? Setting up must’ve been exhausting. If you need any adjustments with the staff, don’t hesitate to ask."

His politeness was almost unsettling. Was she about to be expelled?

She forced a tight smile. "The university’s support has been more than enough. I don’t have any additional requests."

"Excellent. Once the guests arrive, I’ll need you to put in a good word for us."

"A strong impression could secure more funding for new facilities."

Evelyn nodded. "Understood."

After inspecting the setup, she noticed a minor error and directed the workers to correct it.

Before long, Elizabeth rushed over. "Evelyn, are you done here?"

"Almost. Are the guests here?"

As they approached the entrance, a group of well-dressed visitors stepped inside. Among them stood a man in an impeccably tailored suit—Nathaniel Whitmore.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

She had been trying to reach him for days, but he’d ignored her calls. And now, here he was—at her university.

Was he avoiding her?

Nathaniel’s gaze swept across the room before locking onto her.

The moment their eyes met, the entire hall seemed to still.

Theodore’s voice snapped her back to reality. "Evelyn, don’t just stand there. Come greet our guests."

Her pulse spiked.

If she had known Nathaniel would be here, she would’ve found an excuse to leave hours ago.
###Chapter 420

Evelyn Carter had pressing matters to discuss with Nathaniel Whitmore.

As she moved toward him, a flustered woman rushed past her. The woman's cheeks burned crimson as she breathlessly asked, "Mr. Whitmore, did you request my presence?"

Evelyn froze mid-step.

Theodore Winslow paused and corrected, "I summoned Evelyn, not you."

Clearing her throat nervously, Evelyn approached, catching the woman's displeased glare.

She understood the unspoken resentment. After all, Nathaniel was every woman's fantasy - devastatingly handsome with the Whitmore fortune at his disposal.

Stepping away from the murmuring crowd, Evelyn felt dozens of envious eyes tracking her movements. She exhaled quietly, blaming Nathaniel's magnetic presence for the unwanted attention.

Keeping her head down, she trailed behind Theodore, hoping to disappear into the background.

To her surprise, Theodore stepped aside and gestured forward. "Evelyn, since you're most familiar with the hall's design, why don't you give Mr. Whitmore the tour?"

Evelyn's marriage to Nathaniel made the Whitmore Group's funding for Halvard University a foregone conclusion. Theodore's eyes sparkled with barely concealed excitement - after all, as a student here, Evelyn gave Nathaniel every reason to invest.

Biting her lip, Evelyn hesitated. Yet for the sake of professionalism, she forced herself forward.

Keeping her gaze lowered, she murmured, "Mr. Whitmore, what aspects would you like me to explain?"

Nathaniel's lips quirked at her submissive act. He knew better - Evelyn was a master at masking her true thoughts.

"Proceed with your presentation," he instructed smoothly.

Evelyn suspected Nathaniel was deliberately making things difficult. But recognizing his status as the university's honored guest, she maintained composure and began explaining her design concepts.

Time slipped away unnoticed. Evelyn's throat grew hoarse from continuous speaking.

When Nathaniel offered a water bottle, she couldn't help noticing his elegant, pianist fingers.

Accepting it gratefully, she drank deeply, the cool liquid soothing her parched throat.

Turning to Nathaniel, she asked, "Any further questions, Mr. Whitmore? If not, I should return to my duties."

Clutching the bottle cap, Nathaniel studied her intently. "I wasn't aware of your musical interests."

He hadn't expected Evelyn to incorporate musical motifs into the hall's design. The youthful, vibrant aesthetic showcased unexpected talent.

Evelyn paused before answering. "I pursued music passionately in my youth, but financial constraints forced me to abandon it."

Nathaniel knew all about Evelyn's humble beginnings. "And now?" he probed.

"I've rediscovered music recently," she replied evenly. "Learning never truly ends."

"Is Christopher Montgomery your instructor?" Nathaniel's tone turned icy.

Sensing his disapproval, Evelyn avoided further mention of her cousin.

Glancing around the nearly empty hall, she changed tack. "You saw my message yesterday."

"I did," Nathaniel acknowledged casually.

Evelyn lowered her voice. "I tried calling you-"

Her jaw tightened. "If you saw it, why didn't you respond?"

Nathaniel's smirk unsettled her. "If it was truly urgent, you'd have called again."

Pursing her lips, Evelyn countered, "Considering you're transferring all assets to me, shouldn't you show more concern?"
###Chapter 421

Evelyn found Nathaniel's behavior utterly baffling. The divorce agreement clearly stipulated that he would surrender all his shares to her.

According to Benjamin's conditions, Nathaniel would essentially walk away from their marriage with nothing.

How could he remain so composed? It made no sense to her.

Nathaniel leaned back in his chair, his piercing gaze fixed on Evelyn. "I'm in no hurry. Why are you so tense?"

Evelyn blinked. Had she heard him correctly?

A disbelieving laugh escaped her lips.

"Nathaniel, if you're not concerned, then I'll simply take this agreement to Whitmore Enterprises tomorrow and assume your position as CEO."

To her surprise, Nathaniel didn't react with anger. Instead, an amused smirk curled at the corners of his mouth.

"Sounds perfect. The workload has been exhausting lately. I could use a break."

His tone was infuriatingly casual.

"If you ever need help with company matters, don’t hesitate to ask."

Evelyn’s confusion deepened.

In a burst of frustration, she grabbed his tie, pulling him closer. "Nathaniel, are you toying with me?"

Nathaniel sprawled lazily in his seat, one leg stretched out casually.

His eyes gleamed with mischief as he studied her. She was practically in his lap now, her almond-shaped eyes glistening with unshed tears, a mix of anger and defiance swirling in them.

She was like a wildcat—beautiful yet unpredictable, her claws always ready to strike.

Nathaniel’s throat bobbed as his voice dropped lower. "Hmm, you’ve gotten sharper this time."

He was definitely provoking her on purpose.

Evelyn’s temper flared. What game was he playing?

But when she met his gaze, the intensity in his dark eyes sent a jolt through her. It reminded her of that reckless night months ago.

Heat rushed to her cheeks.

Suddenly, she became acutely aware of her position—half-sprawled across his lap, as if she’d thrown herself at him when she grabbed his tie.

Embarrassed, she tried to pull away, but Nathaniel’s hands tightened around her waist.

The warmth of his palms seeped through the thin fabric of her dress, making her skin prickle with awareness.

She squirmed, her face burning, but Nathaniel held firm.

As they struggled, the air between them grew thick with tension.

Evelyn huffed. "Nathaniel, let go! This is a public office!"

His grip only tightened, his gaze darkening. "We’re still married, aren’t we? There’s nothing inappropriate about this."

"I’m pregnant!" she snapped.

Was he out of his mind?

Nathaniel’s expression darkened further. Instead of releasing her, he cupped the back of her head, his lips curling into a cold smile.

"I don’t need reminding. I’m well aware the child isn’t mine." His voice was icy. "But that just means we don’t have to worry about protection, doesn’t it?"

Evelyn’s lips parted in shock. What was he implying?

Before she could react, Nathaniel pulled her fully onto his lap, her legs straddling his.

Her ear pressed against his chest, the steady rhythm of his heartbeat loud in her ears. The heat radiating from him made her pulse race.

Her entire body trembled as she struggled, but Nathaniel’s hold was unyielding.

His gaze dropped to her lips, lingering there.

Then, without warning, he closed the distance between them.
###Chapter 422

A sudden cold sensation sealed Evelyn's lips, making her eyes fly open in shock.

Her breath hitched as she realized Nathaniel was kissing her.

Her mind went completely blank, her body frozen in disbelief.

Three years of marriage, and this was only their second physical contact.

They'd never even held hands before, yet now Nathaniel was pressing his lips against hers with startling intensity.

What was he thinking?

As awareness returned, Evelyn shoved against his chest, but Nathaniel didn't budge.

Her palms flattened against his shirt, feeling the rapid thud of his heartbeat beneath her fingers. It was racing—faster than she'd ever felt it.

Nathaniel's breathing grew uneven, his grip tightening as if intoxicated by her taste.

Everything felt surreal, like a hazy dream she couldn't escape.

When she managed to open her eyes, she saw Nathaniel's face hovering close, his expression unreadable but his posture tense.

"Stop this! What are you doing?" Victoria's sharp voice sliced through the moment.

Nathaniel stiffened at the interruption, breaking away abruptly.

Evelyn seized the chance to push him back, stumbling several steps away, her pulse hammering.

A faint flush colored Nathaniel's sharp cheekbones, his shirt rumpled where she'd gripped it.

His dark eyes burned with intensity, his lips slightly parted and glistening.

For a fleeting second, Evelyn was mesmerized by how devastatingly attractive he looked.

His ragged breathing filled the silence between them, sending an unexpected shiver down her spine.

She still couldn't process that Nathaniel had just kissed her—without warning, without permission.

Tears welled in Victoria's eyes as she glared at them. "Nathaniel, what was that? Did Evelyn throw herself at you?"

Evelyn let out a disbelieving laugh at the accusation.

The audacity of Victoria to spin it that way!

Fury ignited in her chest, and before she could stop herself, Evelyn closed the distance between her and Nathaniel again.

Nathaniel arched a brow, watching her with faint amusement as she approached.

In one swift motion, Evelyn grabbed his loosened tie and yanked him down, pressing herself against him as she shot Victoria a defiant look.

"Does it matter who started it? We're legally married. Kissing behind a stage curtain isn't a crime, is it?"

Nathaniel's gaze locked onto hers as she held him close.

Though his tie was uncomfortably tight around his neck, he tilted his head slightly, as if silently agreeing with her bold claim.

Victoria's face twisted with rage. "Evelyn, stop lying! Nathaniel would never kiss you willingly!"

Evelyn turned, meeting Nathaniel's eyes with a challenging smile. "Darling, Ms. Sinclair seems doubtful. Maybe you should clarify things for her—once and for all."

She wanted to see how Nathaniel would explain this.

A smirk tugged at Nathaniel's lips as he leaned in. "Words won't convince her."

Before Evelyn could react, Nathaniel kissed her again—right in front of Victoria.

Evelyn's eyes flew wide, stunned by his boldness.

Victoria's face crumpled, tears streaming down her cheeks as she choked out, "How could you... Nathaniel, how could you do this to me?"
###Chapter 423

Evelyn's ears rang with Victoria's desperate, broken voice. She could hardly process what was happening right before her eyes.

Nathaniel finally broke the kiss, his dark eyes studying Evelyn's stunned expression. A low chuckle rumbled in his chest. "I believe that explanation was rather persuasive, don't you think?"

Evelyn stood frozen, her mind reeling.

Up this close, Nathaniel's sharp features were even more striking. Her jaw tightened in frustration.

She raised her hand to slap him, but Nathaniel caught her wrist effortlessly. His palm burned against her skin.

With effortless strength, he pulled her against him, tilting her chin up with his other hand. His voice dropped to a dangerous murmur. "Were you planning to hit me?"

"And what if I was?" Evelyn snapped.

"You could try," Nathaniel mused, releasing her wrist. His lips curved. "Haven't you heard? 'Lovers' quarrels are but love renewed'?"

The suggestive glint in his narrowed eyes made her blood boil.

Evelyn's hand trembled midair. "You vile, insufferable—"

Nathaniel merely tilted his head, clearly amused by her fury.

Victoria chose that moment to intervene, her tear-filled eyes accusing. "Nathaniel! How could you? Did she seduce you?"

The idea that Nathaniel would initiate a kiss was unthinkable. He'd always been untouchable, keeping women at arm's length.

Yet here he was, cradling Evelyn's face with surprising tenderness, his gaze burning with unmistakable desire.

Jealousy twisted Victoria's heart into knots.

Why did Evelyn deserve his attention? Victoria was the heiress—beautiful, wealthy, accomplished. What did this nobody orphan have that she didn't?

Evelyn turned to see Victoria weeping dramatically. She felt no sympathy—only bitter amusement.

Watching Victoria's meltdown reminded Evelyn of her own past heartbreak. She'd learned the hard way that men weren't worth the pain.

Nathaniel regarded Victoria with icy detachment, clearly annoyed by the interruption. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise at his harsh tone.

Victoria recoiled as if struck. Tears streamed down her cheeks, her perfect makeup smearing.

Evelyn couldn't stomach the scene any longer. She reached for her canvas bag, ready to leave.

Victoria grabbed her arm viciously. "Oh no, you don't! Explain yourself!"

"Let go!" Evelyn yanked free, but the sudden movement sent her bag tumbling. Papers scattered across the floor.

A thick document slid to Victoria's feet.

The bold print on the first page read: "DIVORCE AGREEMENT."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. She'd nearly forgotten about the papers.

She lunged for them, but Victoria was faster, snatching the documents with a triumphant smirk.

"Well, well," Victoria purred, waving the papers. "All this drama, yet you're still getting divorced. Planning to seduce Nathaniel again for round two?"
###Chapter 424

With Eleanor's surgery completed, Evelyn's divorce from Nathaniel was inevitable.

Victoria's smug smirk made Evelyn's stomach twist with unease.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "Victoria, darling, did you skip the property division section? Let me enlighten you—scroll to page seven."

She leaned in, her voice dripping with amusement. "Turns out, I'm about to become the richest woman in the city. Who needs a husband when you can have billions?"

Victoria's fingers trembled as she flipped to the section. Her face paled.

The document clearly stated Nathaniel would transfer all his Whitmore Group shares to Evelyn.

"This is absurd!" Victoria spat, her nails digging into the paper. "Nathaniel would never agree to this!"

If he signed this, he'd be left with nothing.

Evelyn crossed her arms, unfazed. "Oh, but he did. His signature is right there. Legally binding, sweetheart."

Victoria's breath hitched. She frantically turned to the last page—and there it was. Nathaniel's bold, unmistakable signature.

Her vision swam.

She whirled toward Nathaniel, clutching the papers like a lifeline. "Tell me this is a forgery! You wouldn’t—you couldn’t—"

Nathaniel didn’t even glance at her. "I signed it," he said flatly.

Victoria's voice rose to a shriek. "Are you insane? Do you realize what this means?"

Evelyn watched, stunned. She had the same question burning in her throat—but before she could speak, Nathaniel suddenly yanked her close.

His lips crashed onto hers in a searing kiss.

When he pulled back, his expression was unreadable. "Not your business," he told Victoria dismissively.

Victoria looked like she might combust.

Evelyn, still reeling from the kiss, barely registered her own shock. Was Nathaniel out of his damn mind?

Nathaniel’s gaze locked onto the divorce papers in Victoria’s grip. "Give them back," he ordered.

Evelyn hadn’t planned to reclaim them—but seeing Victoria’s fury, she couldn’t resist.

With a saccharine smile, she held out her hand. "Be a dear and hand it over, Victoria. That document is worth more than your entire wardrobe."

Victoria jerked away. "It’s not finalized yet!"

Evelyn smirked. "Thanks for the reminder. I’ll sign it right now. Then I’ll be the first self-made female billionaire in history." She tilted her head. "Don’t worry—I’ll send you both an invite to my victory gala."

Victoria’s face twisted.

All these years, she’d schemed to marry into the Whitmore fortune. And now, Nathaniel was signing it away?

No. She wouldn’t let Evelyn win.

With a snarl, Victoria ripped the papers to shreds.

Evelyn sighed. "Really, Victoria? Petty even for you."

But inside, she was grinning.

This was far from over.
###Chapter 425

Evelyn gasped as she watched the confetti-like scraps of paper flutter to the ground, astonished by how effortlessly Victoria had demolished the hefty legal document.

The fury radiating from Victoria was palpable.

With the contract now in irreparable pieces, Victoria locked eyes with Evelyn. "Now you can't sign it," she declared triumphantly.

Without Evelyn's signature, the divorce agreement was effectively nullified.

Evelyn remained silent, instead turning her attention to Nathaniel. "What now?" she asked quietly.

Though she couldn't interfere directly, Evelyn recognized that Victoria had inadvertently provided a solution. The destroyed document carried no legal weight anymore.

Noticing the subtle satisfaction in Evelyn's expression, Nathaniel's smile disappeared instantly. In an eerily calm voice, he stated, "I have another copy."

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

Victoria's sobs intensified nearby.

Despite the anger bubbling inside her, Evelyn forced a smile when she saw Victoria's distress.

"How convenient, Mr. Whitmore. Just remember to bring it next time. I'll happily print another copy and sign it for you. Don't forget now, will you?"

Victoria froze at Evelyn's words.

"Evelyn, have you no shame?" Victoria spat. "I've never seen anyone try to take everything from their spouse in a divorce. Who do you think you are to leave Nathaniel penniless?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, meeting Victoria's glare. "That's simply how it is. Nathaniel feels he owes me, so he's chosen to transfer all his assets to me."

"He's worried about how I'll survive after our divorce," Evelyn added with biting sarcasm.

Seeing the envy flash in Victoria's eyes, Evelyn couldn't resist taunting, "Oh Victoria, didn't you once claim to adore Nathaniel?"

"Well now that he's about to become destitute, that shouldn't be a problem for you, should it?"

Victoria recoiled as if struck.

Who in their right mind would marry a bankrupt man?

After all, Victoria had clawed her way out of orphanhood to become the Montgomery heiress.

Her lifelong ambition had been to marry into wealth and become a society darling.

Still, Victoria wasn't about to admit her true feelings. She recovered quickly, snapping back, "Of course it wouldn't bother me. But what gives you the right to take everything?"

"Because Nathaniel is willing. Do you get a say in this?" With that final jab, Evelyn strode off the stage.

Panicking, Victoria whirled toward Nathaniel. "You're seriously going to give her everything and walk away with nothing?" she demanded.

Victoria couldn't comprehend it!

What kind of man would do such a thing? Especially Nathaniel, who came from old money and controlled vast assets. He hadn't built his empire with Evelyn - a modest settlement would have sufficed!

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive as he fixed Victoria with a cold stare. "That's my concern, not yours," he stated firmly.

"Nat, don't misunderstand," Victoria backpedaled quickly. "I'm only thinking of your reputation. If word gets out you're transferring all your shares to Evelyn, the Whitmore Group stock will plummet."

"Besides," she continued smoothly, "you could just give her some cash and maybe a property. With Evelyn's humble background, she'd never spend it all in her lifetime."

"Is there really any need to hand over everything?"

Nathaniel didn't dignify her question with a response. Instead, he turned on his heel and exited the stage.

Left alone, Victoria stared at the shredded paper littering the floor, her face twisting with bitterness.

She would never let Evelyn win this.

Composing herself, Victoria pulled out her phone and dialed a familiar number.

"Mrs. Whitmore? I hope I'm not disturbing you. Remember when I visited Nord City recently? I brought back some exclusive skincare products for you. I'll deliver them personally this evening."
###Chapter 426

Evelyn ended the call with a renewed determination burning in her chest. Victoria Sinclair wouldn't get away with her schemes this time.

With Beatrice Harrington's support, Evelyn felt an unshakable confidence. Together, they could dismantle Victoria's carefully laid plans.

Across campus, Victoria stepped out of the auditorium, a smug smile playing on her lips. The look on Evelyn's face when she'd torn up those divorce papers had been absolutely priceless.

Nathaniel's unexpected intervention had worked perfectly in Victoria's favor.

Just then, Theodore Winslow approached. "Evelyn, how did your discussion with Mr. Whitmore go? Any feedback on the stage design?"

Evelyn hesitated only a moment before answering. "He confirmed everything was perfect. No changes needed."

She hadn't actually spoken to Nathaniel about it, but she knew him well enough. Such trivial details wouldn't concern him. There was no need to bother him with questions.

A deep voice cut through her thoughts. "When exactly did I say that?"

Evelyn spun around to find Nathaniel standing right behind her. Her breath caught. Hadn't he gone to verify details with Victoria?

The air grew thick with tension.

Theodore cleared his throat nervously. "Mr. Whitmore, do you have any suggestions for improvements?"

Nathaniel stepped closer, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn's lowered head. A smirk tugged at his lips. "I believe Evelyn has some thoughts about me she'd like to share."

Evelyn's jaw tightened. Forcing a smile, she said, "I assumed your silence meant approval."

"And if I hadn't spoken up? Would you have asked?"

Evelyn blinked. What game was he playing now?

When she met his eyes, she saw the familiar mischievous glint. He was teasing her. Again.

"Isn't that what I'm doing now?" she countered smoothly.

Nathaniel surveyed the auditorium before focusing on the stage's centerpiece. "That drapery looks excessive. It doesn't fit the theme."

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "It complements the design perfectly."

She moved closer to inspect the fabric. Up close, it looked perfectly acceptable to her.

Theodore shifted uncomfortably. Who would've thought the university's power couple would be arguing over stage decorations?

Elizabeth Hartwell caught Evelyn's eye and gave a subtle nod. Given Nathaniel was the primary investor, a small adjustment to please him wouldn't hurt.

"Why don't you test the mechanism?" Nathaniel suggested, moving beside her.

Evelyn frowned. "The effect is designed for a single use during the actual performance. Each activation costs a hundred thousand dollars."

Nathaniel raised an eyebrow. "After my investment, another hundred thousand is nothing."

"You invested?" Evelyn hadn't realized all the equipment came from his company.

Nathaniel remained impassive. "Test it. I'll cover the cost."

Evelyn considered. If Nathaniel was footing the bill, why not? Truthfully, she'd been curious about the full stage effect herself.

Theodore eagerly arranged the demonstration. As music filled the hall, the curtains rose dramatically, bringing Evelyn's vision to life. Her heart raced with excitement watching her creation unfold.

When the demonstration ended, Evelyn paused thoughtfully. "You know... the drapery does seem a bit much. Let's remove it."

As she directed the changes, a sudden wave of nausea overwhelmed her. Evelyn barely made it to a nearby trash can before doubling over.
###Chapter 427

Evelyn felt like her stomach was turning inside out.

Had it been something she ate for lunch?

As she paused to catch her breath, a bottle of chilled water appeared in front of her. She couldn’t help but notice Nathaniel’s long, elegant fingers as he held it out.

Without hesitation, Evelyn took it, twisting the cap off and gulping down a few sips. The cool liquid soothed her throat, but the discomfort in her abdomen lingered.

She pressed a hand lightly against her stomach, frowning. Something didn’t feel right.

Nathaniel’s sharp gaze followed the movement. "What’s wrong?"

"Nothing serious," Evelyn murmured. "Just a bit queasy from lunch."

She didn’t think much of it—her pregnancy had been smooth so far, with only occasional bouts of nausea.

But as she turned to leave, Nathaniel caught her wrist, his grip firm. "You should get checked at the hospital."

Evelyn blinked, startled by his insistence. She pulled her hand free. "It’s really not necessary."

Nathaniel stepped in front of her, his jaw tight. "Do you even realize your condition? What if something’s wrong?"

His tone was edged with frustration, as if he couldn’t believe her carelessness.

Evelyn opened her mouth to argue, but Theodore cut in smoothly. "You’ve been working nonstop, Evelyn. Since everything’s nearly wrapped up here, why not humor Mr. Whitmore and get checked? For his peace of mind."

Evelyn couldn’t fathom why Nathaniel would be concerned about her.

Theodore’s words were clearly meant to placate him, not her.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened slightly, the air between them growing tense.

Uncomfortable, Evelyn turned away. "It’s just a stomachache. I’ll be fine."

She wasn’t about to rush to the hospital over morning sickness. The thought was embarrassing.

But as she took a few steps, her vision blurred. Her legs buckled beneath her.

Just before she hit the ground, Nathaniel’s arms wrapped around her, steadying her.

Evelyn’s eyelids fluttered weakly. The last thing she saw was Nathaniel’s striking profile—sharp, aristocratic, and unreadable.

Then darkness swallowed her.

Nathaniel lifted her effortlessly, striding out of the hall without a word.

As he settled her into the car, his voice was clipped. "Drive to the hospital. Now. Notify Dr. Whitmore—have the OB-GYN team ready."

His gaze dropped to Evelyn’s pale face, his fingers tightening slightly around her.

He kicked Frederick’s seat. "Faster."

The car surged forward.

By the time they arrived, Dr. Diana Whitmore was already waiting at the entrance.

Nathaniel carried Evelyn out, his expression unreadable. Simon hurried forward. "Mr. Whitmore, the team is prepped as you requested."

"Where’s the operating room?" Nathaniel demanded.

"Third floor," Theodore confirmed.

Nathaniel didn’t hesitate, heading straight for the elevators.

Theodore watched, baffled but silent.

Robert caught up quickly. "Sir, a gurney would be faster. The doctors can examine Ms. Carter immediately."

Nathaniel didn’t slow down. "No time."

His grip on Evelyn never loosened.
###Chapter 428

Nathaniel's voice turned razor-sharp when Robert made his suggestion. "Where's the nearest gurney?"

Simon immediately signaled a nurse to bring one. With careful movements, Nathaniel transferred Evelyn onto the rolling bed before turning back to the hospital director.

"She's pregnant," he explained, his voice tight. "Fainted after severe morning sickness."

In his initial panic, Nathaniel had completely forgotten about hospital protocol and the efficiency of medical equipment.

Now composed, he gave Diana a thorough rundown of Evelyn's symptoms.

Simon's entire demeanor changed upon hearing about the pregnancy. "Mr. Whitmore, rest assured we'll ensure both mother and babies receive the utmost care."

"See that you do." Nathaniel's gaze burned with intensity. "Any harm comes to them, this hospital will face consequences you can't imagine."

His eyes followed the gurney until it disappeared behind operating room doors.

Sweat had soaked through his dress shirt. He shrugged off his suit jacket and tugged at his constricting tie.

The blinking red light above the OR doors held Nathaniel captive. After several tense minutes, he turned to Robert.

"Is childbirth really that dangerous?" The question came out rougher than intended.

Robert's expression turned grave. "My cousin nearly died from a postpartum hemorrhage. The doctors fought for hours to save her."

He swallowed hard before continuing. "Her own mother-in-law refused to pay for the life-saving surgery at first. Said it wasn't worth the expense."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "That's monstrous."

"Exactly why pregnancy terrifies most women." Robert shook his head. "Never understood the risks until I witnessed it firsthand."

Silence fell between them as Nathaniel absorbed this new perspective.

For the first time, doubts crept in. Was bringing children into the world worth endangering Evelyn? If things went wrong, adoption remained an option...

The OR doors swung open, cutting through his thoughts. Diana scanned the hallway. "Family for Evelyn Carter?"

Nathaniel stepped forward. "That would be me."

"You're the husband, I presume?" Diana didn't wait for confirmation. "Your wife has been pushing herself too hard. The stress combined with poor nutrition caused her blood sugar to crash dangerously low."

She fixed Nathaniel with a stern look. "As the father of her twins, you need to step up. Handle more responsibilities so she can rest properly."

Nathaniel's fingers curled into fists at his sides.

Simon quickly intervened. "Dr. Whitmore means well, Mr. Whitmore. She's our top OB-GYN, just...blunt."

Through gritted teeth, Nathaniel asked, "Will she recover?"

"For now, yes." Diana adjusted her glasses. "But continued stress could lead to complications. She's also anemic and needs calcium supplements."

Guilt twisted in Nathaniel's gut as he recalled Evelyn working tirelessly to prepare the university event space these past weeks.

Moments later, nurses wheeled Evelyn out, still unconscious. Nathaniel followed them to a private suite, throwing Robert a glance.

"Make arrangements per Dr. Whitmore's instructions," he ordered, tension lining every word.

Robert placed Evelyn's tote bag on the nightstand before slipping out. Alone now, Nathaniel studied his sleeping wife.

Color had returned to her cheeks, though her lips remained pale.

A sudden ringing shattered the quiet. The sound came from Evelyn's bag.

Nathaniel reached inside without thinking. The screen displayed a single name: "Christopher."
###Chapter 429

The phone screen flashed with the name "Christopher." Nathaniel Whitmore's brows knitted together in confusion. Who the hell was Christopher?

His gaze remained fixed on Evelyn Carter's buzzing phone as it continued to ring.

Unable to suppress his curiosity any longer, Nathaniel finally answered.

Christopher's voice came through, warm and familiar. "Evelyn, I'm at the university gates. Are your classes over? I'm waiting outside for you."

The moment Nathaniel heard a man's voice, his expression darkened. "She doesn't need you to wait for her."

"Who is this?"

Christopher's tone turned icy as Nathaniel responded. "Let's keep this civil. Hand the phone to Evelyn. If you're after money or have demands, we can talk terms."

Nathaniel was momentarily stunned. Money? Since when had he ever needed to beg for it?

His lips thinned into a sharp line. "That's my line. From now on, you and your family stay away from Evelyn. Or don't blame me for what happens next."

With that, he ended the call.

Christopher stood frozen, the abrupt disconnect leaving him bewildered.

Had Evelyn been kidnapped again?

Panic surged through him as he dialed Andrew Montgomery. "Andrew, it's bad. Evelyn might be in danger."

"What happened? Tell me everything."

Christopher recounted the call, his voice tight with agitation. "You won't believe who answered. The guy was insufferably arrogant! But last I checked, Jonathan Reeves was still in custody, right?"

Andrew paused, considering. "Do you have a recording of the call? Play it for me. I might recognize the voice."

Christopher forwarded the recording immediately, then called back, impatience gnawing at him. "Well? Who was it?"

Andrew exhaled sharply. "If I'm not mistaken, that was Nathaniel Whitmore."

Christopher stiffened. "Nathaniel Whitmore? The heir to the Whitmore fortune? The same man Victoria Sinclair was bragging about marrying?"

"Exactly."

Christopher's jaw clenched. "You heard what he said. That wasn't the tone of a reasonable man. He clearly has ulterior motives toward Evelyn—and now he's got her."

"I understand your concern. But if Evelyn is with Nathaniel, at least she's safe for now. I'll handle this. Don't worry."

"Don't worry?" Christopher snapped. "Evelyn is my sister too. Why do I get the feeling you're hiding something? Is there history between her and Nathaniel?"

Christopher had always had a sharp instinct for these things.

Nathaniel's warning to stay away from Evelyn only confirmed his suspicions—there was more to this than met the eye.

But Andrew remained silent, refusing to elaborate.

The longer Christopher thought about it, the more unsettled he became.

He knew Evelyn had once worked as a caretaker for Eleanor Whitmore in the Whitmore estate—a role that, in wealthy households, was little more than a glorified maid.

What could possibly develop between a maid and a billionaire heir?

No matter the outcome, Evelyn would be the one to suffer.

Christopher's hands balled into fists. If Nathaniel hurt her, he swore he'd make him pay.

In the sterile hospital room, Evelyn stirred awake.

Her eyelids fluttered against the harsh fluorescent lights as she slowly took in her surroundings.

Instinctively, her hands flew to her abdomen.

Where were her babies?

Had Nathaniel ordered the doctors to terminate her pregnancy without her consent?

"What are you looking for?" Nathaniel's deep voice cut through the silence.

Evelyn's gaze snapped up to find him standing by the window. Her voice trembled as she demanded, "Where are my children? What did you do to them?"
###Chapter 430

Evelyn's disbelief was evident, and Nathaniel grew increasingly irritated. Was this really how she saw him?

He lifted his gaze, his tone sharp. "What did you expect? They're not my children. Why would I want them?"

His words struck her like a physical blow. Her hands trembled as she lowered them to her stomach, tears spilling over.

Were her babies really gone?

Seeing her tears, Nathaniel instantly regretted his cruel joke. "Evelyn, don't—"

But before he could finish, she launched herself at him, fueled by fury and grief. "Nathaniel, I swear—!"

Alarmed by her sudden movement, he shoved his laptop aside and caught her before she could hurt herself.

In the next second, her hands locked around his throat.

She flipped him onto the sofa, straddling him, her grip tightening. If he had taken her babies from her, she would make him pay.

Nathaniel winced at the pressure but didn’t push her away. Gritting his teeth, he managed to choke out, "Let go."

"Never! You're a murderer!" she hissed.

Just then, the door swung open.

Diana Whitmore and Isabelle Laurent froze in the doorway, stunned by the scene before them.

Evelyn was pinning Nathaniel down on the sofa, their bodies pressed close in what looked like an intimate embrace.

Diana’s brows furrowed. "What on earth is going on here?"

At the sound of her voice, Evelyn loosened her grip but remained tense. Nathaniel, however, pulled her closer against him.

She shoved him away, disgusted by his touch.

Nathaniel remained composed. "We should stop. We have an audience."

Evelyn stiffened.

Diana crossed her arms, her expression stern. "This is highly inappropriate behavior for a hospital, especially for a pregnant woman carrying twins."

Evelyn’s breath caught. "Wait—my babies are still here?"

"Of course they are," Diana said. "Mr. Whitmore was very clear when he brought you in. If anything happened to those babies, this hospital would face serious consequences."

"So rest assured, both you and your twins are perfectly safe."

Evelyn turned to Nathaniel, stunned.

She had expected him to demand an abortion, but instead, he had ensured her babies' safety.

She had misjudged him entirely.

Nathaniel leaned back, watching her with calm amusement. "Do you understand now?"

Evelyn swallowed hard. "Then why did you say those things?"

"What things? You misunderstood."

She clenched her fists, resisting the urge to hit him.

Flushed with embarrassment, she pulled away. Now that she knew her babies were safe, her anger faded.

Diana cleared her throat. "Pregnancy hormones can be intense, but you must exercise restraint, especially in public."

Evelyn’s face burned. "It’s not what you think!"

Nathaniel smirked. "I didn’t exactly resist."

Diana gave him a pointed look. "As the father, you should educate yourself on these matters. Allowing reckless behavior could harm the babies."

Nathaniel tilted his head. "Where can I find more information?"
###Chapter 431

Evelyn's cheeks burned with humiliation at Nathaniel's words.

What on earth was he talking about?

But Dr. Diana remained perfectly composed, unfazed by the awkwardness. "We have educational materials on this subject available at the hospital. If you're interested, you can purchase one to take home."

Nathaniel stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Is that so? How considerate."

Evelyn quickly cut in, turning to Diana. "Are my babies really okay?"

Even though Diana had already assured her about the twins' health, Evelyn needed to hear it again for her own peace of mind.

She couldn’t shake the suspicion that Nathaniel and Diana might be conspiring to deceive her.

Diana gave her a knowing look. "If your children weren’t alive, you wouldn’t have the energy to argue so passionately right now. An abortion isn’t exactly a walk in the park."

Evelyn found some comfort in her words. She felt no pain in her abdomen, no telltale scent of blood.

If she had really lost them, it would have destroyed her.

She exhaled in relief, grateful to wake up and find Nathaniel beside her.

Yet, the memory of him forcing her toward an abortion and locking her in the hospital still lingered like a shadow.

After finishing her examination, Diana turned to Evelyn. "As you enter the later stages of pregnancy, you must take better care of yourself."

"You’re showing signs of malnourishment, especially since you’re carrying twins. Given your husband’s wealth, is there really a need for you to overexert yourself daily?"

Nathaniel received another pointed glance from Diana, prompting him to interject. "This isn’t my fault. It’s not like she has to work so hard at home."

Evelyn smirked and shot him a look. "Oh? Who was the one cooking? Who handled all the chores? Who picked out your outfits every morning?"

The moment she finished, both Diana and Isabelle turned their disapproving stares toward Nathaniel.

Diana’s tone softened as she addressed Evelyn. "As an expectant mother, your health comes first. If you neglect yourself, how will you care for the babies growing inside you?"

Evelyn nodded earnestly. "I understand now."

Once Diana and Isabelle left, Nathaniel spoke cautiously. "Are you happy now that you’ve publicly shamed me?"

Evelyn scoffed. "I wasn’t shaming you. Was anything I said untrue?"

"But that was in the past. It’s not like you collapsed this time because of housework, right?"

Guilt flickered in Evelyn’s chest, and she quickly deflected. "Didn’t I just say it was in the past?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Evelyn, is this how you thank someone who saved your life? If I hadn’t caught you in time and rushed you here, do you honestly think you’d be sitting here lecturing me?"

He was so furious he reached for his tie to loosen it, only to find it already undone from the hours spent waiting for her to wake.

Evelyn shuddered at the thought of what might have happened if he hadn’t been there when she collapsed.

Even though the babies were his, she had no intention of telling him—not yet.

Taking a deep breath, she cleared her throat. "Thank you for helping me earlier."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Well, well. A 'thank you' from you? That’s rare."

Ignoring his sarcasm, Evelyn grabbed her bag from the bedside table, ready to leave.

If she didn’t return home soon, Margaret and her brothers would start asking questions.

Nathaniel frowned. "Where do you think you’re going?"

Clutching her bag tighter, she answered, "Home, obviously."

He smirked. "In such a hurry? Afraid I’ll take advantage of you?"

Remembering his earlier call with Christopher, Nathaniel’s mood darkened. Soon, she’d be facing the Montgomerys—and he wasn’t sure she was ready for that.
###Chapter 432

Evelyn clutched her tote bag tightly and turned to face Nathaniel. "I'm perfectly fine, really. Just exhausted and my blood sugar dropped too low."

His stormy gray eyes darkened as he rose from his seat. "I'm driving you home."

"No, thank you. I'll call a cab." She forced a polite smile. "We're going opposite directions anyway. You've already done enough by bringing me to the hospital. I can't possibly inconvenience you further."

The deliberate distance she created made his jaw tighten. "Is this about appearances? Worried someone might see you in my car and get the wrong idea?"

Evelyn blinked in genuine confusion. "That's not what I meant at all. I simply don't want to waste Mr. Whitmore's valuable time."

Without waiting for a response, she strode out of the room. Within seconds, she heard the steady rhythm of his leather shoes following her.

The elevator doors slid open and Nathaniel stepped in right behind her. The confined space forced them uncomfortably close - close enough that she caught the faint scent of his cologne mingling with laundry detergent.

Her stomach flipped. That scent. She'd chosen that particular detergent herself during their three years together.

At the next floor, a flood of people crammed into the elevator, including an elderly woman pushing a wheelchair-bound man. A hyperactive boy darted around them, bouncing a rubber ball.

Evelyn instinctively pressed a protective hand to her abdomen and tried to step back. "Excuse me, could you please—"

The grandmother cut her off sharply. "This elevator is small enough as it is! Should I let my grandson get crushed instead?" She jabbed a bony finger near Evelyn's face. "Young people these days have no respect for their elders!"

Before Evelyn could respond, strong arms pulled her against a solid chest. Nathaniel maneuvered them so his broad shoulders shielded her completely.

Safe in his unexpected embrace, Evelyn found herself with breathing room in the corner. She stared up at his chiseled profile, her pulse erratic.

The boy suddenly wailed when his ball got stuck between passengers. "Grandma! I can't play!"

The elderly woman whirled on Evelyn again. "See what you've done! Selfish girl, taking up all this space—"

Nathaniel's glacial glare silenced her mid-sentence. Then he looked down at the sniveling boy. "You know what happens to children who play in elevators? The Elevator Monster snatches them away forever."

The boy's cries turned to terrified screams.

Evelyn gaped at Nathaniel. Since when did he tell children's horror stories?

The grandmother recovered first. "How dare you frighten my grandson! Who do you think you are?" Her shrill voice echoed off the metal walls.
###Chapter 433

The elevator doors slid open at the ground floor. Most passengers stepped out, leaving the space suddenly empty.

Except for two.

The elderly woman and her grandson stood blocking the exit, arms crossed, preventing Evelyn and Nathaniel from leaving.

"Disgraceful!" The woman's shrill voice echoed in the metal box. "Young people these days have no respect for their elders!"

Evelyn, still pressed against the corner, lifted her gaze to meet Nathaniel's. "We're here," she murmured softly.

The unspoken message was clear - he could stop shielding her now.

Nathaniel straightened his posture and took two deliberate steps back. An odd tension crackled between them.

Evelyn felt heat rising to her cheeks. She peeked up at his broad shoulders through her lashes.

Noticing the obstruction, Nathaniel's brow furrowed at the belligerent senior. Such absurd encounters were rare for someone accustomed to private hospital wings.

Within moments, Robert arrived with a security detail. The imposing figures formed a silent semicircle behind the ranting woman.

When she finally sensed the presence behind her, the woman whirled around - and froze at the sight of six uniformed guards.

Her tirade died instantly.

"W-what is this?" she stammered. "Some kind of mafia operation? My son is a senior executive at Whitmore Enterprises! He'll make you pay for this!"

Evelyn couldn't suppress a laugh.

What were the odds?

She tilted her head at the woman. "How interesting. Did you know this handsome gentleman also works at Whitmore Enterprises?"

The woman puffed up with false confidence. "Not like my son! He's in upper management!"

"Which division?" Nathaniel's voice cut like ice. "What's his name?"

"Development department!" she snapped. "Why? Planning revenge? Save your breath - he's coming to pick me up right now!"

Just then, a harried-looking middle-aged man rushed through the lobby doors. "Mom! What's going on?"

His face drained of color when he recognized Nathaniel. "M-Mr. Whitmore? What did you do?"

"These hooligans trapped me in the elevator!" the woman wailed, suddenly emboldened. "They brought these thugs to intimidate me! Is this how civilized people behave?"

Nathaniel's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "This is your mother?"

The man looked ready to faint. "My deepest apologies, sir. She's from the countryside - doesn't understand city manners. Please forgive her ignorance."

The woman gaped at her son's groveling. "Who is this man?"

Evelyn answered sweetly, "I did mention he works at Whitmore too, didn't I? He's the CEO."

"The...the boss?" The woman's bravado evaporated instantly. Rural education notwithstanding, she understood what that title meant.

Trouble. Big trouble.

"Mom! Apologize to Mr. Whitmore immediately!" the man begged.

"Unnecessary," Nathaniel interrupted. "Submit your resignation to HR by tomorrow."

The man's knees nearly buckled. "Sir, please! This was a misunderstanding! My family didn't recognize you! I have a mortgage, children in school - I can't lose this job!"
###Chapter 434

The termination letter visibly shook the elderly woman, but she quickly composed herself. "Son, don't be such a coward."

"You're a top graduate with skills. You'll land a senior position at another company easily."

Nathaniel let out a derisive scoff. "Don't insult actual executives by comparing them to his mediocrity."

He strode away, with Evelyn trailing behind. She glanced back at the quarreling mother and son, feeling oddly satisfied.

The woman's entitled tone suggested she was accustomed to bullying others.

Had her son ever reined in her behavior? Probably not—which told Evelyn everything she needed to know.

The man was likely just as toxic in the workplace, stealing credit and harassing juniors.

Now that he'd been fired, Evelyn felt zero sympathy.

She turned forward only to find Nathaniel waiting, his gaze piercing. "Do you think I went too far?"

Evelyn hesitated briefly.

He continued, voice clipped. "That man was incompetent and lazy. For two years straight, his performance ranked dead last."

"Any other manager would've fired him ages ago."

Her suspicions confirmed, Evelyn nodded. A mother like that could never raise a decent son.

"You were justified," she said.

Nathaniel led her outside, where a sleek black car idled by the curb. He opened the door. "Get in."

The memory of him shielding her in the elevator replayed in her mind, sending her pulse skittering.

She bit her lip. How could she politely refuse?

Then he arched a brow. "Am I that terrifying?"

Evelyn met his eyes. Truthfully? No.

When she finally moved toward the car, the tension in his jaw eased slightly.

Suddenly, tires screeched nearby.

Andrew leaped out, his face etched with worry. "Evelyn!"

She spun around, startled by his abrupt appearance.

Freezing mid-step, she frowned. "What are you doing here?"

He rushed over, scanning her for injuries. "Are you okay? Did something happen?"

She shook her head. "Just low blood sugar. Mr. Whitmore brought me to the hospital."

Andrew's head snapped up, his expression hardening when he spotted Nathaniel.

He couldn't believe it. Nathaniel Whitmore—helping her?

Meanwhile, Nathaniel's posture turned rigid at Andrew's arrival. The Montgomerys were like weeds—impossible to escape.

The air crackled with hostility as the two men locked eyes.

Andrew stepped between them, his voice icy. "Thanks for getting her here, Whitmore. I owe you dinner."

Nathaniel's smile was razor-thin. "Unnecessary. Taking care of my wife is my responsibility."

Andrew's hands clenched. "That paperwork says otherwise. You're divorced."
###Chapter 435

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock at Nathaniel's words.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, Nathaniel cut her off with a raised brow. "But the divorce papers were torn. And Evelyn never signed anything. Legally, we're still married."

Andrew nearly lost his composure. He took a threatening step forward, his gaze locked on Nathaniel. "Care to repeat that?"

The tension between the two men crackled in the air, one wrong word away from exploding.

Sensing the danger, Evelyn quickly grabbed Andrew's arm. "Stop it. There's no point fighting over this."

"Stay out of it, Evelyn," Andrew snapped, his anger directed at Nathaniel. "I'll make sure this divorce happens."

To Andrew, no one had the right to force Evelyn into anything. As his sister, she could end a marriage in an instant if she wanted to.

Nathaniel smirked. "Oh? Try me."

Alarmed, Evelyn tugged Andrew away. "Enough! Let's go. I'm starving."

"Don't let him intimidate you," Andrew insisted. "Divorce is always an option. No marriage is unbreakable."

Evelyn sighed. "I know. The cooling-off period is almost over anyway. Arguing now is pointless. Let's just leave."

Nathaniel's smug expression faltered at her words.

His eyes darkened as he watched them walk away.

Frustration boiled inside him. He kicked a pebble at his feet before turning to Robert. "How much time is left on the cooling-off period?"

"About ten days."

Nathaniel frowned. "What does that mean?"

"Normally, couples proceed with the divorce after the cooling-off period ends. But if they don't, they'd have to refile."

A spark of hope flickered in Nathaniel's eyes.

So if they didn't act in time, the divorce wouldn't go through?

Robert continued, "There are other ways to get divorced, though. One option is taking it to court."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Find me the best divorce lawyer."

This wasn't over yet.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat beside Andrew in the car, studying him briefly. "Andrew, how did you find me?"

"Christopher called you. He wanted to pick you up from campus, but Nathaniel answered. They argued, and Christopher called me, worried about your relationship with Nathaniel."

"Did you tell him everything?"

Evelyn was slowly accepting that her brothers knew about her past with Nathaniel. Secrets never stayed buried.

Besides, she was moving to Nord City soon. There was no reason to hide anything anymore.

Andrew kept his eyes on the road. "I couldn't keep it from him. Christopher’s sharp—he probably already suspected something."

"I called your university and checked nearby hospitals. That’s how I tracked you down."
###Chapter 436

"Sorry for worrying you, Andrew."

"Don't apologize. I'm just relieved you're unharmed. As much as I despise Nathaniel Whitmore, I'm grateful he was there when you needed him."

"Evelyn, you don't have to shoulder everything alone anymore. You have us—your family."

A soft smile curved Evelyn's lips. "I know. But these past few weeks have been… complicated. I want to finish my credits and graduate. I’m working hard so I can move back to Nord City with all of you."

Andrew wasn’t surprised. Alexander had been working tirelessly to make that happen.

He studied her carefully. "Evelyn, when are you planning to tell Alexander and the others about you and Nathaniel?"

"After we return to Nord City. I’m afraid Alexander might confront him on my behalf. Since I’m leaving soon anyway, there’s no need to stir up more trouble. I just hope he won’t be upset that I kept this from him."

"He won’t be. And when the time comes… I have something to tell you too."

After much deliberation, the Montgomery brothers had decided to reveal the truth to Evelyn the day she returned to Nord City.

That she was the true Montgomery heiress—not Victoria Sinclair.

"Alright." Evelyn simply nodded, trusting her brothers implicitly. She knew they would never do anything to hurt her.

Everything at home seemed normal—except for the troubled expression on Christopher’s face when he visited later that evening.

The moment Margaret stepped into the kitchen, Christopher lowered his voice. "Evelyn, are you really okay? No one’s giving you trouble, right?"

"I’m fine. I just fainted in the cafeteria because of low blood sugar. He took me to the hospital."

Christopher scoffed. "That’s the least he could do."

Something was off about him, and Evelyn sensed it. She tugged his sleeve gently. "Christopher, I didn’t mean to keep you in the dark."

"I’m not mad at you. I’m furious at him. That bastard doesn’t deserve you! And yet he had the audacity to ask for a divorce instead of taking care of you? I’ll never forgive him for that!"

Andrew interjected, "I already gave him a piece of my mind about it."

The way Christopher and Andrew strategized ways to confront Nathaniel made Evelyn uneasy.

Quietly, she retreated to her room and dialed Julian. He was the only one who knew the full story.

Christopher and Andrew knew about the divorce—but not the pregnancy.

No one answered. Julian was likely in surgery.

She sent him a text, explaining what had happened, hoping he could talk some sense into Christopher and Andrew.

The next morning, a headline caught her eye the moment she unlocked her phone.

"Renowned Singer Georgia Wiseman Spotted with Mystery Beau! Secret Dinner Date Exposed."

The mention of the famous singer made Evelyn freeze.

The last person linked to Georgia in a scandal had been Nathaniel.

Now that she was seen with someone new… had Nathaniel been dumped?

Evelyn tapped the article, only to find a blurry photo of the couple from behind. One of them looked strangely familiar.
###Chapter 437

A single glance was all Evelyn needed to cross Nathaniel off her mental list. That wasn't him.

She could recognize his silhouette anywhere, and this man's attire didn't match Nathaniel's usual style.

If anything, he looked more like Julian.

No wonder he hadn’t answered her call yesterday. Had he been on a date?

She checked her WhatsApp, where Julian had finally replied. The message had come in late—she’d already been asleep.

"Evelyn, I figured you'd be resting, so I didn’t call back. About Christopher and Andrew—leave it to me. Just focus on your health and don’t overwork yourself with college matters. You need to take it easy."

Clearly, Julian was worried about her.

The fainting incident had been a wake-up call. After the music showcase ended, she’d retreat home and do nothing but attend classes.

Her babies were her top priority now.

Who knew if she’d be lucky enough to avoid complications if she collapsed again?

She typed a quick reply: "Understood."

Downstairs, Margaret had prepared breakfast. Evelyn ate with quiet gratitude before heading to campus, her spirits lifted.

Today was the final rehearsal, meaning she had to inspect the venue decorations one last time.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the hall, Elizabeth rushed over. "Evelyn! Thank goodness you’re okay. We were terrified when you fainted yesterday."

"Just low blood sugar. Sorry for worrying everyone."

"As long as you’re fine. Mr. Winslow asked about you multiple times today. You’re the backbone of this event, after all."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Just doing my part."

The showcase would bolster her academic record, so she was determined to see it through.

Elizabeth excused herself, and Evelyn wandered toward the guest seating area. When her gaze landed on the spot where she’d collapsed, she remembered—it had been Nathaniel who caught her.

Without him, things could’ve been much worse.

"Oh, look who’s back—the campus celebrity, freshly discharged." A mocking voice sliced through her thoughts.

Evelyn turned to face two familiar figures.

One had helped design the venue and had eagerly stepped forward earlier, assuming Theodore had summoned her. The other had been seen with Victoria before—likely an acquaintance.

Their hostility was palpable, but Evelyn remained composed. "If you want fame by fainting, feel free to try it here."

One girl scoffed. "We’re not as scheming as you, collapsing right in front of Mr. Whitmore just so he’d rush you to the hospital. Everyone sees through your act. Stop deluding yourself."

The other chimed in, "Exactly. Mr. Whitmore is Bern City’s most eligible bachelor. His fiancée is Ms. Sinclair—they’re a perfect match. Gold-diggers from nowhere should quit dreaming."

Evelyn let out a soft laugh, her eyes cool. "Your jealousy is showing. And it’s not a good look."

Their expressions twisted.

She continued, "One of you clung to Victoria, while the other tried flirting with Nathaniel, didn’t you? Who are you to judge me?"

Without another word, she walked away. Some battles weren’t worth her time.
###Chapter 438

Every moment felt precious to Evelyn now.

She poured herself into practicing the piano piece, determined to redeem her past mistakes. The melody transported her back to the orphanage days.

Fragments of forgotten memories only surfaced when her fingers danced across the ivory keys.

Beyond the orphanage recollections, she sensed there was someone else she'd forgotten - someone who once meant everything to her.

As she played, the music became a bridge to her past while her fingers perfected the present.

Just then, a bob-haired woman appeared in the doorway, her sharp eyes surveying the room with calculated interest.

Evelyn lifted her gaze. "Hello there. Can I help you with something?"

"Hi! I'm from the Creative Writing Department," the stranger replied. "I'm working on a novel featuring a piano prodigy protagonist and needed research inspiration."

She hesitated before continuing. "I don't know anyone from the Music Department well enough to approach. But I've noticed you practicing several times. You're not a music major, are you? You're Evelyn Carter, right?"

"That's me." Evelyn gestured to the bench beside her. "Please, join me. Though I should warn you, I'm hardly an expert on music."

"Well, the other day I happened to hear you playing this beautiful, unfamiliar children's song..."

"Oh that? It was composed by the director of my childhood orphanage. Not exactly mainstream repertoire."

"No way! I grew up in an orphanage too!" The woman's face lit up. "No wonder I felt this instant connection. I'm Danielle Spencer. Friends?"

"Absolutely!" Evelyn found herself smiling genuinely at this unexpected kindred spirit.

Neither woman pretended musical expertise, yet their mutual honesty created an immediate bond.

Meanwhile downstairs, Victoria Sinclair paced the corridors with restless energy, her mind clearly preoccupied.

Under her instructions, investigators had been meticulously combing through every Music Department student's background.

Victoria was certain - if the real Ms. Montgomery was enrolled in any music program, she would eventually surface.

It was simply a waiting game.

After their practice session ended, Evelyn and Danielle left the music building together that afternoon.

"I need to head home for lunch," Danielle said. "But let's do this again soon?"

"Definitely. Text me next time you're coming to practice." Evelyn agreed warmly.

They parted ways with a wave, Evelyn hailing a cab home.

She found Christopher Montgomery on the living room sofa, just ending a phone call with Anthony.

"Let's continue this later," Christopher said upon seeing her, quickly concluding his conversation.

"How's the preparation going, Evelyn?" he asked, setting aside his phone.

"Good progress today," she replied. "I can feel my playing improving."

Christopher's lips curved slightly. "Really? Play something for me then."

As her fingers moved across the imaginary keys, the improvement was evident. While still far from professional standards, the growth from her first attempts was remarkable.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived on campus early, the weight of the upcoming music showcase pressing on her.

Elizabeth Hartwell handed her the event schedule, where one particular guest name jumped out immediately:

"Nathaniel Whitmore"

And just below it, another equally familiar name that made her breath catch.
###Chapter 439

Christopher Montgomery's name was on the guest list! Evelyn Carter blinked, certain her eyes were playing tricks on her.

But he hadn’t mentioned anything about attending. Could it be someone else with the same name?

Skeptical, she tried calling him, but the line rang endlessly.

Odd.

It had to be a coincidence, she told herself.

Evelyn took one last glance around the hall, ensuring every detail was flawless. Only then did the tension in her chest ease.

"Evelyn Carter, how dare you show your face here?"

The sharp voice made her turn. Beatrice Harrington and Victoria Sinclair strode in, arms linked like conspirators.

Victoria wore a smug smirk. Though she hadn’t been able to stop the property settlement, Beatrice certainly could.

Nathaniel would never defy his own mother, would he?

The sight of Evelyn ignited Beatrice’s fury, especially after Victoria’s poisonous whispers about the agreement.

At that moment, Beatrice wished Evelyn would simply disappear.

"Who do you think you are?" Beatrice spat. "You should’ve slunk away after the divorce. How dare you lay claim to Nathaniel’s fortune? Are you out of your mind?"

Evelyn had expected this the moment she spotted Beatrice.

Victoria wasn’t clever enough to scheme on her own—she always hid behind Beatrice’s wrath.

Unfazed, Evelyn arched a brow. "You’ve got it backward, Mrs. Harrington. Your son signed that agreement first. If you have a problem, take it up with him."

"Don’t lie to me!" Beatrice jabbed a finger at her. "You manipulated him into signing it. Over my dead body will you get a single cent!"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Victoria already ripped up the document yesterday. Nathaniel promised me another copy. If you want to stop this, go talk to him. He’s the one insisting."

"Don’t forget what you signed when you married him," Beatrice sneered, thrusting a yellowed paper at her. "A divorce agreement. You forfeited all rights to his assets. Dream all you want—you’ll never touch a penny!"

Evelyn stared at the document, memories flooding back.

Back then, she’d been desperate to save Nathaniel, willing to sign anything. Now, she wished she could shake her past self—warn her that pitying a man like him was the beginning of her downfall.

People like Nathaniel didn’t get hurt. They did the hurting.

Victoria smirked. "That’s just a copy, by the way. Don’t even think about destroying it."

Evelyn’s lips curled. "Not everyone resorts to petty tricks like you."

Victoria’s face twitched. Beatrice snapped, "Victoria’s right. That agreement never should’ve existed. Thank goodness she tore it."

Evelyn laughed. "This divorce agreement means nothing. Nathaniel wants to give me his property. What can you possibly do about it?"

Beatrice’s face darkened. "Mark my words, Evelyn Carter—this isn’t over. I’ll deal with my son myself. Victoria, let’s go!"
###Chapter 440

"Alright, Mrs. Whitmore, don't get upset. I'm sure the divorce papers have finally knocked some sense into her."

Victoria Sinclair smirked, deliberately flashing a victorious glance at Evelyn Carter.

She was convinced someone needed to put Evelyn in her place—and this was far from over.

When the music showcase began, there would be another surprise waiting for Evelyn.

Evelyn clicked her tongue in annoyance. For a brief moment, she considered tossing the divorce agreement away, but the thought vanished just as quickly.

What if someone found it and read the details?

In the end, she tucked it securely into her tote bag.

Truthfully, Nathaniel Whitmore's wealth meant nothing to her. She had only mentioned it to wipe those smug looks off their faces.

Turning on her heel, Evelyn resumed inspecting the hall decorations, ensuring everything was flawless.

This event's success was crucial for her reputation.

Soon, the musicians arrived.

Her attention sharpened when Anthony Kensington appeared, dreading that the notoriously critical man would choose this moment to nitpick.

Elizabeth Hartwell approached him. "Mr. Kensington, could you check if anything needs adjusting with the decorations? We still have time to fix it."

Anthony's sharp gaze swept the room, his usual biting remarks ready—until his eyes landed on Evelyn.

A memory flickered—her connection to Christopher Montgomery. He schooled his expression into neutrality. "Everything looks perfect. No changes needed."

Why would he criticize when the design had already been approved by Christopher himself?

Evelyn exhaled in relief. At least there were no last-minute disasters to handle.

With time running out, she couldn’t afford any setbacks.

The musicians retreated backstage to prepare, while guests gradually filled the hall. Media crews lined the perimeter, cameras poised.

Watching the scene unfold, Evelyn’s nerves flared.

This was her first major campus event. She desperately wanted everything to go smoothly.

Then, she spotted Nathaniel entering the hall, surrounded by middle-aged executives.

Tall, commanding, effortlessly drawing every gaze in the room—he had that effect wherever he went.

Evelyn was certain every woman there was staring.

His eyes lifted, meeting hers. She quickly averted her gaze, pretending she’d just been scanning the crowd.

When she glanced back at the entrance, her breath hitched.

Christopher Montgomery and Victoria Sinclair walked in side by side, deep in conversation.

Evelyn frowned. Since when did they know each other?

At the doorway, Christopher shot Victoria a frosty look. "Give it up. You’ll never be a pianist."

"Christopher—" Victoria refused to accept it.

"Don’t address me so familiarly. I’ve never acknowledged you as family. You’re nothing but a fraud."

His voice was steel, leaving no room for argument.

Victoria clenched her jaw, fury simmering.

Now that she knew the real Montgomery heiress was at this college, she was determined to uncover her identity—before anyone else could.

The Montgomerys must never find the true heiress.

Because Victoria intended to keep that title for herself—forever.

###Chapter 441

After exchanging words with Christopher, Victoria shot Evelyn a challenging look, which the latter immediately caught.

Evelyn frowned, puzzled by the meaning behind that gaze.

Moments later, Christopher approached her. "Evelyn, aren't your legs tired from standing so long?"

"Not at all. There's a chair right here." She tilted her head slightly. "Christopher, I was shocked to see your name on the guest list earlier. I thought it might be someone else with the same name."

"You never mentioned you'd be attending this concert."

"That's the whole point of a surprise." He couldn't bear the thought of just standing in the corner watching the show alone.

His brows knitted together. "Come sit with me. My seat has a better view."

She shook her head quickly. "I'm fine here. If anything comes up, I need to be available."

Christopher sighed inwardly, resigning himself to his helplessness. "Fine. When you visit Nord City next time, I'll take you to a much grander concert."

When that day came, he would proudly announce to the world that Evelyn was his kind and adorable sister. He'd organize an annual concert just for her!

Evelyn nodded quietly, watching as he walked toward the VIP seating area—only to take the spot right beside Nathaniel!

Her heart leaped into her throat. If she had accepted Christopher's offer, she would have been seated next to Nathaniel!

Then, she saw Victoria slide into the seat on Nathaniel's other side, wearing the smug expression of a victor.

The light in Evelyn's eyes dimmed as she quickly averted her gaze, forcing herself to focus on the stage decorations instead.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel stole a fleeting glance at her, his eyes swirling with unreadable emotions. He had noticed Christopher approaching Evelyn earlier. The two seemed unusually close.

Christopher shifted slightly, blocking Nathaniel's line of sight before remarking pointedly, "Mr. Whitmore, the concert is about to start. Perhaps you should pay attention to the stage."

The unspoken warning was clear: Stop looking at my sister, or else.

"That's none of your concern," Nathaniel retorted coldly.

Victoria chimed in sweetly, "Nathaniel, Mr. Montgomery and Evelyn seem quite close. He even personally oversaw the hall decorations earlier."

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly.

Christopher was known as Nord City's playboy—his girlfriends never lasted longer than three months.

Glancing at Victoria, he smirked. "Indeed. I find Evelyn exceptionally talented in design—far more so than you, at least."

The insult stung. "Christopher, you must be joking—"

"Don't call me that. We're not close. I've never acknowledged your status."

Victoria paled. Her greatest fear was Nathaniel discovering she was merely an adopted child. If that happened, how could she ever marry him?

But Nathaniel didn't react, as if he hadn't heard a thing.

Relieved, Victoria decided not to provoke Christopher further. What if he exposed her secret?

Then, the concert began.

This was Evelyn's first time attending a live performance. The energy was entirely different from watching on screen. The melodies wrapped around her heart, pulling her into their rhythm.
###Chapter 442

The spotlight illuminated Vincent Armstrong, the orchestra conductor, as he drew the final note to a close.

Evelyn Carter found herself unconsciously tapping her fingers to the rhythm, completely absorbed in the mesmerizing musical performance.

Two hours later, the concert reached its conclusion.

The applause continued as the host stepped forward. "What an honor to present such an extraordinary performance by these exceptionally talented musicians."

"As a special treat for tonight's event, we'll be selecting two lucky audience members to come onstage and perform with our musicians."

A wave of excitement rippled through the crowd.

Evelyn remained composed, assuming they would choose top students from the Music Academy who might soon join the professional orchestra.

The first spotlight landed on a senior music student. With elegant poise, she ascended the stage and performed a flawless violin solo.

Evelyn nodded appreciatively at the girl's impeccable sense of rhythm and timing.

Then came the moment to select the second participant.

From her VIP seat, Victoria Sinclair subtly signaled toward a specific direction. The spotlight danced across the audience before unexpectedly settling on Evelyn.

Shock flashed across Evelyn's face.

Was this some technical error? Had the crew misunderstood their instructions?

Beside her, Theodore Winslow looked equally confused. But remembering Nathaniel Whitmore's presence, he assumed this must be some romantic gesture from the husband to his wife.

As the host hesitated, Theodore discreetly signaled to proceed.

"Please join us on stage," the host encouraged. "Ladies and gentlemen, let's give our second participant a warm welcome!"

Evelyn's stomach twisted into knots. Though she'd been practicing piano, she only truly knew two pieces - the one Christopher Montgomery had taught her, and a simple children's melody.

Instinctively, she sought Christopher's gaze. To her dismay, he was enthusiastically cheering her on. "You've got this!"

Evelyn nearly groaned. She needed rescue, not encouragement!

How could an amateur like her perform before this audience of musical elites?

Just then, Victoria rose with false generosity. "Ms. Carter, if you're not comfortable performing alone, I'd be happy to assist you."

The triumphant gleam in Victoria's eyes revealed everything. This was no accident - it was a carefully orchestrated humiliation.

Drawing a steadying breath, Evelyn stood. "Thank you, but no. I play as a hobby, though I'm hardly professional. I hope the audience will forgive any mistakes."

"Don't worry, it's all in good fun!" The host smoothed over the tension with practiced ease.

As she approached the grand piano, Evelyn's hands trembled slightly. Then she caught sight of both Christopher and Nathaniel in the crowd.

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable as ever.

But for reasons she couldn't explain, Evelyn refused to back down. However poorly she might play, she would never let Victoria Sinclair have this victory.

Settling at the piano bench, Evelyn mentally rehearsed Christopher's lesson. As her fingers found the keys, her nerves steadied, and she began the piece she knew best.

The moment the first notes sounded, Victoria's smug smile vanished.
###Chapter 443

Evelyn Carter stood frozen, her breath catching in her throat. That familiar lullaby - the one from her childhood - was being played before her very eyes.

Had she imagined it?

How was this possible?

Her porcelain skin turned ghostly pale as realization dawned upon her.

She remembered hearing those same notes weeks ago, chasing the melody through empty hallways until she found Victoria Sinclair practicing in the music room.

At the time, Evelyn had dismissed it as coincidence.

But now... Now everything made terrifying sense.

Victoria was adopted. An orphan, just like...

Evelyn's hands trembled violently. If Victoria turned out to be the real Montgomery heiress she'd been searching for all these years...

Her gaze darted to Nathaniel Whitmore. If the Montgomery family discovered Victoria's true identity, would Evelyn lose her chance to become Mrs. Whitmore?

Never. She wouldn't allow it.

Evelyn's eyes darkened as she watched Victoria perform, venom dripping into her thoughts. "You were supposed to stay gone. Why won't you disappear?"

On stage, Victoria's fingers faltered momentarily. The pressure was overwhelming.

She had woven the childhood melody into her performance seamlessly, blending two complex pieces together in one breathtaking composition. What began as a daunting challenge had transformed into her most triumphant moment.

As the final note faded, complete silence engulfed the auditorium.

Nathaniel's eyebrows shot up in surprise. He'd never heard his wife play like this before.

Just as he raised his hands to applaud, Christopher Montgomery leapt to his feet first. "Magnificent!" he cheered, his proud grin stretching ear to ear. "I always knew you had this in you, Victoria."

Nathaniel's smile tightened.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's stomach churned with dread. Each clue clicked into place with terrifying clarity.

The way Christopher, Julian, and Daniel treated Victoria. How Andrew Montgomery's legal team had immediately defended her during that scandal.

It all pointed to one horrifying truth.

Her designer clutch nearly slipped from her numb fingers.

Had the Montgomerys known all along? Had they been playing her for a fool this entire time?

That explained everything!

No one would show such favoritism without reason. Not even for someone as charming as Victoria.

Cold fear gripped Evelyn's heart. If Victoria was the true heiress... what did that make her?

And why hadn't they taken Victoria home if they knew?

The pieces didn't fit. Not completely.

On stage, Victoria finally exhaled, relief washing over her. She hadn't embarrassed herself or the university.

The host approached with sparkling eyes. "An extraordinary performance, Miss Sinclair! Tell us, how many years have you studied piano? Are you perhaps a music major?"
###Chapter 444

Evelyn shook her head. "No, I'm not from the Conservatory. I only began learning piano recently."

The interviewer's eyes widened. "But you played magnificently! Who's your instructor? Would you share?"

Her gaze flickered toward Christopher as a shy smile curved her lips. "Someone very special to me."

Her voice dropped to a whisper, making the audience erupt in delighted squeals.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he caught the fleeting glance between them. His mood darkened watching Evelyn's radiant smile on stage.

Someone special?

His fingers tugged impatiently at his silk tie.

Christopher deliberately met Nathaniel's glare. "Hear that? I'm the special one in Evelyn's life."

Nathaniel couldn't fathom why men kept swarming around her after their divorce.

As Christopher moved toward Evelyn, Victoria could no longer contain herself. She hurried after them, determined to uncover the truth.

The auditorium had emptied, but Nathaniel remained seated, his expression stormy.

Theodore approached with a bright smile. "Congratulations, Mrs. Whitmore! That was an extraordinary performance."

"The Conservatory dean believes she has exceptional talent. They're willing to accept her immediately if she wishes to transfer."

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "Make it happen."

"Of course, Mr. Whitmore. Though..." Theodore hesitated. "Mrs. Whitmore seems determined to graduate early from her current program."

"Early graduation?" Nathaniel's brow furrowed.

"Yes. She's been aggressively making up missed credits from her gap years. Attending every possible lecture to complete her sociology requirements."

Seeing Nathaniel's darkening expression, Theodore quickly added, "Though I'm certain she only wants to focus on her duties as Mrs. Whitmore."

Nathaniel knew better. Evelyn would never prioritize being his wife over her own ambitions.

Unless...she planned to leave for Nord City after graduation.

His gut twisted at the thought of her reuniting with Julian Montgomery. Especially now, with her pregnancy.

"Cancel her early graduation plans," Nathaniel commanded abruptly. "Arrange her Conservatory transfer immediately. I'll cover all expenses. Assign the finest instructors."

"Consider it done, sir."

Nathaniel's attention snapped back to the stage where Evelyn and Christopher were descending together, laughing.

He rose abruptly, striding toward them.

Meanwhile, Evelyn beamed at Christopher. "I was terrified up there! Never expected to be chosen. Thank heavens I've practiced so much."

Her smile faltered as she spotted Victoria approaching.
###Chapter 445

+18 BONUS

Something about Victoria's expression unsettled Evelyn, though she couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was.

Christopher followed Evelyn's gaze and immediately spotted Victoria. His face darkened. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn found his hostility odd. Christopher had always been the epitome of a gentleman, especially toward women—one of his defining traits as a wealthy heir.

Yet, his attitude toward Victoria was downright icy. Strange.

Victoria forced a smile. Now wasn’t the time to dwell on Christopher’s rudeness.

"The piece you played was beautiful," she said carefully. "But I think the opening was a different song. Something like a children’s lullaby?"

Before this moment, Victoria had agonized over countless possibilities. Did Evelyn still remember their shared past?

If so, she might recall how Victoria had convinced her to transfer to that other orphanage.

Evelyn paused, thrown by the question. "You're right. I blended it with another composition I love. Is there a problem?"

"N-No. It was just so lovely, I had to ask." Victoria’s back prickled with cold sweat.

She couldn’t bring herself to meet Evelyn’s eyes. Fear coiled inside her—the dread that Evelyn might remember the song’s origins and mention the orphanage.

If Christopher caught wind of it and dug deeper, Evelyn’s true identity would be exposed.

Victoria didn’t dare imagine the fallout.

Meanwhile, Evelyn studied Victoria’s reaction with suspicion. She was certain Victoria had orchestrated today’s "surprise" to humiliate her.

Clearly, Victoria hadn’t expected Evelyn to escape unscathed.

Just as Evelyn was about to speak, she noticed Nathaniel approaching, and her breath hitched.

Why was that bastard heading their way? To mock her performance?

Nathaniel’s gaze locked onto Evelyn, his mind racing. She was an enigma to him. He hadn’t known she could play piano, let alone with such skill.



He pressed his lips together. "Evelyn, come with me. We need to talk."

Shocked, she hadn’t expected that from him.

Before she could respond, Christopher yanked her closer, his expression stormy. "Say it here. Unless it’s something shameful, why the secrecy?"

Tension crackled between the two men, thick enough to ignite.

Evelyn quickly intervened. "I still have things to handle. We’ll talk later." She flashed Christopher a reassuring smile. "I’ll call you when I’m done."

Christopher recognized her attempt to defuse the situation. Making a scene on campus was the last thing he wanted.

Too many eyes were watching.

Once Evelyn left, Christopher turned on Nathaniel, his voice low and dangerous. "I warned you. Stay away from Evelyn, or don’t blame me for what happens next."

Nathaniel rolled up his sleeves, his usual composed demeanor slipping to reveal something darker. "That’s my line. Let me make this clear—Evelyn is my wife."

His next words were a blade. "Tell your family to back off. Or don’t blame me for what comes after."
###Chapter 446

Nathaniel stormed out without another word.

Christopher Montgomery seethed with fury. Never in his life had he encountered such blatant arrogance. If it weren't for Evelyn, he would've handled Nathaniel himself.

Victoria Sinclair's pulse quickened at Nathaniel's words. Still, uncovering Evelyn's true identity was paramount—she needed to know if the Montgomery family had any suspicions.

Hurrying after Christopher, she feigned concern. "Mr. Montgomery, you seem quite close with Evelyn. Actually, she's also very familiar with Julian."

Christopher stopped abruptly. His gaze darkened as he looked down at her. "What exactly are you implying?"

"Nothing! I'm just... curious." She forced a light laugh. "You all live in Nord City, don’t you? When did you get to know Evelyn? How did you meet?"

It clicked in Christopher’s mind—Victoria was probing. He remembered the piano piece earlier, the same melody Evelyn had learned as a child in the orphanage.

Since Victoria had come from the same place, recognizing the tune wasn’t surprising. But had she started doubting Evelyn’s identity?

Still, Christopher had always found it suspicious that Alexander had brought Victoria home instead of Evelyn.

He’d never found concrete evidence, but now, the perfect opportunity to investigate had fallen into his lap.

Raising a brow, he countered, "Why does that concern you?"

Victoria plastered on a smile. "Actually, I noticed Evelyn seems unusually close to Julian. There might be something between them, though I heard he’s been seeing a singer lately."

She sighed dramatically. "Frankly, Evelyn isn’t right for him. She’s divorced, and her background is... well, beneath Julian’s. I thought I should talk some sense into her before she gets delusional."

Christopher scoffed. "You’re lecturing about status, Victoria? Or have you forgotten you were just an orphan before the Montgomerys took you in?"

His voice dripped with disdain. "You don’t exactly hold a high position either. Or have you started believing your own lies?"

Victoria’s face twisted. For years, she’d lived comfortably, convincing herself—and everyone else—that she was the true Montgomery heiress.

Now, the real daughter had appeared, and the thought of Evelyn—the woman she despised most—being the rightful heir was unbearable.

Christopher noted her reaction. She must have recognized the piano piece earlier, prompting her to dig into his connection with Evelyn.

Yet Victoria quickly masked her panic. "You misunderstand. I was just curious. Why are you acting like I’ve done something to Evelyn?" She tilted her head. "But does Julian know how close you two are?"

Christopher smirked. "Why would I report my personal connections to Julian? Besides, isn’t he dating that singer now?"

He was deliberately muddying the waters. If Evelyn hadn’t lost her memories due to illness, Victoria’s deception would have been exposed long ago.

As Christopher walked away, Victoria struggled to steady her breathing. The memory of Evelyn playing that haunting melody echoed in her mind.

She had never felt this unsettled.

Why did it have to be Evelyn of all people?
###Chapter 447

Terror gripped Victoria Sinclair's heart. Though Evelyn Carter had transformed dramatically since childhood, her eyes remained unmistakable.

Those piercing green eyes—unchanged after all these years.

Why hadn't she noticed sooner? If she'd realized earlier, she would've eliminated Evelyn before she ever set foot near the Montgomery family.

Now everything hung in the balance. If Evelyn truly was the lost Montgomery heiress...

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. It made no sense—how had none of the Montgomerys recognized her? Julian and Christopher had spent months working alongside Evelyn.

Memories surfaced of Evelyn's childhood boasts about her wealthy parents and mansion. Had she never mentioned this to the Montgomerys?

The unanswered questions churned Victoria's stomach. She wouldn't rest until she confronted Evelyn directly.

Just then, Hannah Winslow approached with obsequious smiles. "Ms. Sinclair! Thank you for recommending me for the orchestra auditions."

"Mr. Kensington loved my performance earlier."

Victoria offered a thin smile. "Congratulations."

Hannah leaned closer, whispering, "And I've found the girl who sings that lullaby you've been searching for."

Victoria's pulse stuttered. She already knew—it had to be Evelyn performing on stage earlier. "Don't waste my time. We both heard her just now."

"You're mistaken, Ms. Sinclair. It's not Evelyn—it's someone else entirely."

Victoria's breath caught. "What?"

Relief flooded her veins. Anyone but Evelyn—she could handle anyone else.

Hannah lowered her voice. "Her name's Danielle Spencer from the Literature Department. An orphan surviving on scholarships."

"Take me to her. Now."

Outside, Victoria spotted a plain girl in thick-framed glasses—utterly unremarkable. No Montgomery bone in that body.

Evelyn, with her regal bearing, looked far more the part. Yet Victoria clung to desperate hope.

Turning to Hannah, she forced gratitude. "Thank you for finding my old friend. I'll need privacy now—dinner next week?"

"Of course, Ms. Sinclair! My pleasure."

As Hannah left, Danielle studied Victoria through her glasses. The way the usually arrogant music student had groveled... this woman clearly held power.
###Chapter 448

Danielle blinked in confusion. "How can I help you?"

Victoria Sinclair pulled out her phone and played an audio recording. "Are you the one playing this piece in the music room?"

Danielle nodded slowly. "Yeah, I am." Still puzzled, she tilted her head. "Ms. Sinclair, you said you're looking for your childhood friend?"

Victoria's expression softened. "That's right. Years ago, I visited an orphanage here. A friend from that place helped me when I was lost."

She sighed, her fingers tightening around her phone. "I haven't lived in Bern City for so long. I came back searching for her, but everything has changed. The only clue I have is this piece—she's the only one who knows how to play it."

Danielle's thoughts immediately flew to Evelyn. She had taught her this melody, after all. Though they had come from the same orphanage, Evelyn had already left by the time Danielle arrived—she was two years younger.

Still, Danielle had always admired Evelyn. A small smile tugged at her lips. "I know where she is."

She was certain Victoria was searching for Evelyn. Fate had finally smiled upon her. Stories like this only happened in books, yet here it was, unfolding right in front of her.

Victoria cut in abruptly, noticing her expression. She lowered her voice, feigning sorrow. "I really need to find her. I want to know how she's doing now. If she's struggling, I'll help her—no matter what."

Danielle's envy flared. But before she could dwell on it, Victoria seized her hand. "It's you, isn't it? You must resent me for not coming back sooner. The distance was too great."

Her voice turned pleading. "My brothers wouldn't let me return to Bern City after what happened at the orphanage. But now, I can finally make it up to you."

She leaned closer, her eyes gleaming. "You're still my best friend. Whatever you need—I'll make it happen. I can publish your book, adapt your stories—anything."

Danielle's breath hitched. Publish her book? Adapt her stories? Fame and fortune—just like that?

A spark of greed flickered in her gaze. As an orphan, she had endured enough pity. She wanted success, recognition—something to prove she wasn't just another charity case.

This was her chance.

But doubt crept in. Evelyn had taught her that piece. Sooner or later, Victoria would uncover the truth.

Danielle hesitated, then tested the waters. "Another girl played this in the hall too. Why are you so sure it's me and not her?"

Victoria's lips curved into a knowing smile. Finally, the question she'd been waiting for. Danielle was hooked.
###Chapter 449

Victoria's lips curved into a satisfied smile as she watched Danielle take the bait. "Actually," she said smoothly, "I've been considering this very question during my drive over. But I wanted to ask you first before approaching Evelyn."

Danielle hesitated, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap. How should she respond?

"Are you the one I've been searching for?" Victoria pressed, her voice dripping with honeyed persuasion. She had laid out the entire story, dangling promises of wealth and status before Danielle. Anyone with half a brain would recognize the opportunity.

Victoria knew all too well the struggles Danielle faced as an orphan. The discrimination, the condescending looks—she was certain Danielle would grasp this lifeline without hesitation, just as she herself had done with Alexander all those years ago.

That decision had granted her a life of luxury.

After a tense pause, Danielle nodded, guilt flashing across her face. "Yes... it's me."

Triumph surged through Victoria. She clasped Danielle's hands, her eyes shimmering with feigned emotion. "Is it really you? You can't imagine how happy this makes me!"

She sighed dramatically. "It's been so many years since we last saw each other. We've both changed so much. If not for that piano piece, I might never have recognized you."

Danielle forced a weak smile. "People do look different when they grow up."

Victoria seized the moment. "Speaking of which... how does Evelyn know that piece?"

Danielle's palms grew clammy. "I—I taught her. We were in the same orphanage, after all. I... I treasured our friendship, so I shared it with her."

"Really?" Victoria's eyes gleamed with predatory interest. "So she was at the orphanage too? When exactly? Was she there during my time?"

Beads of sweat formed on Danielle's brow. Panicked, she blurted, "Maybe? I don't remember clearly. But Evelyn doesn't either. She fell ill as a child—lost all her memories from the orphanage."

Victoria's pulse quickened. "She truly remembers nothing?"

Now it made sense. Despite spending so much time with Julian and the Montgomery cousins, Evelyn's true identity remained hidden. She had amnesia.

Fate was truly on Victoria's side. She nearly laughed aloud. Evelyn had forgotten everything—including her real family.

Danielle ventured cautiously, "Ms. Sinclair, if you don't believe me, you could always ask Evelyn—"

"No need," Victoria interrupted smoothly, squeezing her hand. "Of course I trust you. You were my dearest childhood friend, after all."

The gesture reminded Victoria of how she used to hold Evelyn's tiny hand. Back then, Evelyn had been like a delicate doll—so trusting when Victoria declared them best friends.

And now, that same "friend" had gifted her this lavish life.

Relief flooded Victoria. As long as Evelyn's memories stayed buried, the Montgomerys would never learn the truth.

Yet Nathaniel's kindness toward Evelyn unsettled her. Was it simply familial affection between cousins?

The thought gnawed at her. Why couldn't Evelyn just vanish permanently?

It was ridiculous enough that she'd married Nathaniel during his coma three years ago—gambling on a man who might never wake.

Victoria had underestimated Evelyn's ambition. Why hadn't she seen through her sooner?

Suppressing her unease, she smiled at Danielle. "Give me your contact details. Consider us friends now, alright?"

She produced a business card. "If you ever need anything, just call my assistant. He'll take care of it."
###Chapter 450

"Oh, absolutely. Thank you."

"Don't even think twice about it. You're my dearest friend," Victoria beamed, flashing Danielle a radiant smile. Observing how easily swayed Danielle appeared, a daring scheme formed in Victoria's mind. Perhaps she could manipulate Danielle to eliminate Evelyn.

Straightening her posture, Victoria's indifferent gaze swept over Danielle. "I'm swamped right now, so I must dash. Let's plan that tea and shopping date soon. I've even picked out some special gifts for you."

"No worries at all. Go ahead."

Danielle watched Victoria depart after exchanging contact information. She pinched her forearm until it turned crimson, finally convincing herself this wasn't some fantastical dream.

This was reality unfolding before her!

Electric excitement coursed through her veins as she realized she'd finally grasped her golden opportunity. The mere thought of her literary works being published or adapted made her heart flutter with anticipation.

Just then, her phone vibrated. Evelyn's name flashed across the screen.

Danielle nearly fumbled her device. Had Evelyn discovered something? Or had Victoria approached Evelyn instead?

Though Danielle had never indulged in deceit before, Victoria's irresistible offers proved too tempting to refuse. Self-preservation seemed only natural under these circumstances.

As an ordinary orphan without connections or beauty, she'd endured endless mockery from others.

At least Evelyn possessed decent looks and attracted wealthy, handsome suitors. Even without Victoria's friendship, Evelyn could lead a comfortable life.

But for Danielle? This was everything. Losing Victoria's favor would mean utter ruin.

A frosty glint surfaced in Danielle's eyes as she stared at the caller ID. "Evelyn, I hope you'll forgive me for this. Once I succeed, I'll make it up to you. But just this once... let me have this chance."

She let the call go unanswered.

Meanwhile, Evelyn frowned at her silent phone. Hadn't Danielle specifically requested to attend this concert for the conductor's autograph?

Thanks to Christopher's connections, she'd secured both the autograph and a photo opportunity with Danielle's idol. Yet now her calls went unanswered.

Still, Evelyn sent a text:
"Danielle, I got the autograph. If you want that photo, come to the main hall now."

Glancing at Christopher, she murmured, "My friend isn't answering. She must be occupied with something."

"That's alright. You can still collect the autograph for her."

Evelyn nodded. Perhaps Danielle had gotten held up elsewhere. She knew how desperately her friend had wanted this meeting with the renowned conductor.

A nagging worry crept in - was Danielle in some kind of trouble?

Evelyn exhaled in relief as the concert concluded flawlessly. All her efforts had borne fruit - she'd not only earned her academic credits but also secured a coveted stage performance.

Perfect.

Turning to Christopher, she announced, "Let's go, Christopher. Dinner's on me tonight."

"Certainly." He rarely saw Evelyn this elated. The evening had been ideal - not only fulfilling her academic requirements but granting her a spotlight moment.

As they walked, Evelyn suddenly hesitated. "Christopher... are you close with Victoria Sinclair?"
###Chapter 451

Evelyn had been meaning to ask earlier, but Victoria's sudden arrival interrupted her.

Christopher's expression darkened momentarily. The question caught him off guard. "Victoria can play piano too. She wants to join our symphony."

"So she'll be joining soon?" Evelyn inquired, tilting her head.

"Over my dead body!" Christopher scoffed, his voice dripping with contempt. "She lacks any real talent."

There was absolutely no way he'd allow Victoria into their prestigious ensemble.

Given the Sinclair family's influence, Evelyn thought Victoria could easily secure a spot if she truly wanted.

As they prepared to exit backstage, Theodore approached Evelyn. "The gala was a tremendous success thanks to you, Evelyn. Join us for dinner?"

This took Evelyn completely by surprise. She had no desire to socialize, having only participated for academic credit.

Noticing her discomfort, Christopher stepped forward. "Apologies, but we have prior commitments. Perhaps another time."

Theodore recognized Christopher as the symphony's managing director. Realizing he couldn't risk offending such an influential figure, he forced a smile. "Of course, another time then."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. Thank goodness Christopher had intervened.

As they walked out, Evelyn spotted Nathaniel's luxury sedan parked nearby. She averted her eyes after the briefest glance.

Sliding into Christopher's car, she stole a look in the rearview mirror but couldn't decipher Nathaniel's expression.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed as he watched Christopher's vehicle depart. A complex emotion flickered across his features. Turning to Robert, he demanded, "Any updates on why Evelyn's connected to the Montgomerys?"

Robert hesitated. "Nothing concrete. But the Montgomerys started showing interest in Mrs. Whitmore right after your divorce proceedings began."

"Highly suspicious. Yet our investigation yields nothing substantial."

"Keep digging!" Nathaniel snapped.

The image of Evelyn leaving with Christopher gnawed at him. Frustrated, he rolled down the window for air - only for Victoria to come running.

"Nathaniel! You're still here!"

The window shot back up instantly. "Drive!" he barked at the chauffeur.

The car peeled away, leaving Victoria fuming on the sidewalk. Nathaniel had been ice-cold toward her ever since her scheme involving Eleanor's surgery was exposed.

Reginald approached cautiously. "Ms. Sinclair, why insist on Nathaniel? Bern City has countless eligible bachelors."

"No! As a Sinclair heiress from Nord City, I deserve the wealthiest match. Nathaniel surpasses them all."

Lowering his voice, Reginald cautioned, "For your own good, miss. You know the real Montgomery heir has surfaced. It's only a matter of time before-"

"I'll marry into wealth before that happens," Victoria cut in sharply. "My lifestyle won't change either way."
###Chapter 452

Victoria Sinclair's eyes gleamed with icy determination. "Don't worry. I won't allow this to happen. I won't let the true heiress of the Montgomery family return and steal everything from me!"

She had clawed her way to this position through sheer will, and she wasn't about to let anyone snatch it away.

Not only would she cling to her status as the Montgomery daughter, but she was also determined to become Nathaniel Whitmore's wife.

"Ms. Sinclair, this is too dangerous."

"I got where I am by taking risks." Victoria would do whatever it took to secure her future.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter led Christopher Montgomery to a cozy restaurant near her university. With a soft laugh, she said, "The food here has a distinct Bern City flavor. It's just a short walk from campus, and it's always packed."

Christopher parked the car before glancing at the bustling eatery. "Do you come here often?"

Shaking her head, Evelyn replied, "I used to work part-time here. The owner is incredibly kind. I've tried most of their specialties, and I promise you, they're amazing."

A pang of guilt struck Christopher when he heard she had once worked part-time. If he had found her sooner, he would have spared her from such hardships.

They stepped inside and were immediately met with an unexpected sight—Theodore Winslow and several university staff members were already seated on the first floor.

Evelyn froze. Of all the places, why did they have to be here?

Theodore spotted her first and greeted warmly, "Evelyn! What a coincidence. Since we're all here, why don't you join us?"

She suppressed a sigh. Fate really wasn't on her side today. Refusing would be awkward, so she reluctantly accepted.

Christopher didn't object, following them to a private dining room.

Evelyn took her seat, leaving an empty chair beside her. To her surprise, Theodore chose a different spot, keeping a respectful distance.

She barely had time to process his courtesy before the door swung open.

Nathaniel Whitmore strode in, his jacket draped over his arm, dressed in a crisp shirt and tailored vest. He looked effortlessly commanding even in casual attire.

Evelyn mentally kicked herself. Of course he would be here—the event was sponsored by the Whitmore Group.

She had assumed he was too busy to attend, but clearly, she'd been wrong.

Nathaniel took the seat beside her without hesitation.

Theodore immediately brightened. "Mr. Whitmore, we're honored you could join us. Now that everyone's here, let's enjoy the meal. And Evelyn—"

He turned to her with exaggerated praise. "Despite your background, you've remained humble and hardworking. The university is lucky to have you."

Evelyn's smile tightened.

Just then, one of the staff members leaned forward curiously. "Wait—what is Evelyn's background?"

The room fell silent.

Nathaniel's gaze flickered to Evelyn, his expression unreadable.

Theodore hesitated, suddenly realizing he might have said too much.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her glass.

This was going to be a long dinner.
###Chapter 453

Evelyn recognized the man immediately—he had to be the dean of the Music Conservatory. Her lips pressed together as she struggled to formulate a response.

But Nathaniel answered with effortless charm. "Nothing special. She's my wife, and I appreciate you all looking out for her at the conservatory."

Evelyn's breath caught. Had he really just said that?

She shot him a bewildered glance. He'd explicitly warned her before about keeping their relationship private. Yet here he was, announcing it to the entire room!

Had he lost his mind?

The private dining room fell into stunned silence—except for Theodore and Christopher. Theodore beamed with delight while Christopher glared daggers at Nathaniel.

The dean immediately raised his glass toward Evelyn. "My deepest apologies, Mrs. Whitmore. Please forgive my ignorance in not recognizing you earlier. You have my word this won't leave this room."

The others quickly echoed similar promises of discretion.

Evelyn forced a polite, strained smile. She didn't believe them for a second. Academic circles thrived on gossip.

She'd been carefully maintaining a low profile to complete her credits before leaving Bern City. Now Nathaniel had shattered that plan completely. How could she possibly stay anonymous after this?

Was this deliberate? Yet she couldn't imagine what he'd gain from exposing her identity.

Her sharp glare should have burned holes through him, but Nathaniel merely gave her a graceful look as he reassured, "Don't worry, darling. I've got your back. No one will dare trouble you."

Evelyn nearly choked. That wasn't the point at all!

Watching Nathaniel play the doting husband—pouring her drinks with exaggerated care, putting on an Oscar-worthy performance of marital bliss—she wondered if he'd been body-snatched.

Just then, a hand reached from her right to intercept Nathaniel's movement.

Christopher snatched her glass away, scowling. "Evelyn doesn't drink juice. It's unhealthy for her. Shouldn't you know that?"

Nathaniel froze momentarily before setting the bottle down. "My apologies, sweetheart. I didn't recall you having juice allergies."

Evelyn glanced at the mango juice and offered a faint smile. "I didn't before. I do now." Since becoming pregnant, she'd become hyper-vigilant about her diet.

Rather than taking offense, Nathaniel simply gestured to the server. "Order whatever you prefer, darling."

Christopher cut in smoothly, "Evelyn prefers lighter dishes. For instance—" He proceeded to order an extravagant spread without restraint.

Sandwiched between the two men, Evelyn felt her patience wearing thin. Her smile faltered at the mountain of food accumulating before her.

Nathaniel's voice turned glacial. "Mr. Montgomery, your eagerness to please my wife is... notable. While I appreciate you recognizing her excellence, I should remind you she's already married."

Evelyn's cheeks burned. Just as she'd feared—he'd misinterpreted her relationship with Christopher.

Every eye in the room snapped to Christopher at Nathaniel's words, glittering with scandalized curiosity.

So the Montgomery heir was making moves on Nathaniel Whitmore's wife.

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably, but Christopher remained unruffled. He began serving her portions. "Try this, Evelyn. It's excellent."

"And this one's quite good too."

As her plate piled high, Evelyn finally began eating—her babies were starving after all.
###Chapter 454

Evelyn Carter never gave a damn about what others thought. She lived by her own rules, doing exactly as she pleased. She was convinced that if she showed indifference, people would eventually back off.

And Nathaniel Whitmore was the root of it all. He should be the one dealing with the fallout.

"Evelyn, try this dessert. It's rum-infused—absolutely divine," Christopher Montgomery said, shooting Nathaniel a smug look.

Nathaniel's voice was sharp. "No, she can't have that."

"Why not?" Christopher arched a brow.

"It contains alcohol." Evelyn was pregnant. Alcohol was off-limits.

Nathaniel threw a questioning glance at Evelyn. Did Christopher not know about her pregnancy?

Evelyn caught Nathaniel's silent warning. She eyed the dessert and shook her head. "I'm full. I don’t want any dessert right now."

Christopher still hadn’t pieced it together. Reluctantly, he set the dessert aside, accepting her refusal.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. He draped his arm over the back of Evelyn’s chair. "Since you're done eating, let’s head back."

Evelyn was stunned. When would he stop with these ridiculous displays?

His arm made it seem like she was tucked against him. Furious, Christopher shoved Nathaniel’s arm away. "Back off, you bastard! Stay the hell away from her!"

The tension in the room thickened. Theodore Winslow, sensing the brewing storm, interjected, "Mr. Whitmore, it’s perfectly normal for a couple to leave together after dinner. You’re crossing a line here."

He’d chosen his side quickly. Nathaniel was the wealthiest man in Bern City, while Christopher hailed from the Montgomerys of Nord City—impressive, but not enough to intimidate Theodore.

Christopher scoffed. "A couple? They’re divorced. Cut the act!"

Theodore’s jaw dropped. He looked like he’d just been slapped.

Nathaniel remained unshaken. He met Christopher’s glare. "The divorce isn’t finalized. Legally, she’s still my wife."

His piercing gaze was mesmerizing under the soft lighting, but there was something darker beneath it—cold, possessive.

The air grew heavier.

Theodore quickly ushered the remaining guests out of the private room. The less they witnessed, the better.

He never expected Evelyn to be this sought after. The fact that a Montgomery was pursuing her too? Unbelievable.

Silence reclaimed the room.

Christopher jabbed a finger at Nathaniel. "Divorce proceedings or not, it’s over. If you harass her again, I’ll make sure you rot in prison."

It wasn’t an empty threat. With Andrew Montgomery backing him, he could make it happen.

Evelyn tugged Christopher’s arm. "Let it go. We should leave."

"Evelyn." Nathaniel’s voice cut through the air, low and dangerous.

She looked up, meeting his stormy gaze. There was something unreadable in his eyes—something that sent a shiver down her spine.

"I need to talk to you."

Christopher stepped between them. "If you have something to say, say it to me. Don’t you dare intimidate her!"

Evelyn held Nathaniel’s stare. "Go ahead. I’m listening."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Eleanor keeps asking about you. You haven’t visited her lately."

Evelyn’s smile was brittle. Of course. It was always about Eleanor. To him, she was just a means to keep his grandmother happy.

She nodded. "I’ll make time. Anything else?"

Nathaniel’s fists clenched. The words he’d rehearsed a thousand times lodged in his throat.
###Chapter 455

Evelyn studied Nathaniel's hesitant demeanor, realization dawning that he truly had something important to say.

This was the first time she'd ever seen him struggle so visibly with his words.

To her, Nathaniel had always been decisive—the unshakable heir of the Whitmore empire, renowned in the business world for his unwavering confidence.

Her eyes remained fixed on him, but his gaze flickered away, as if the words were lodged in his throat.

Frustration twisted his expression as he yanked at his tie.

Damn it.

After a sharp inhale, he finally met Evelyn’s eyes. "Evelyn, the truth is—"

Christopher cut in sharply, his voice laced with irritation. "What’s with the stalling? Spit it out already!"

His glare was sharp. "But let me make one thing clear—don’t even think about chasing after Evelyn again. It’s too late for regrets now."

"Choose your next words carefully, unless you want to embarrass yourself. Evelyn isn’t some lovesick fool anymore."

Christopher knew men like Nathaniel. He recognized the look—the desperate, lingering hope. And he wasn’t about to let it take root.

Nathaniel’s lip curled in disdain as he thought, The Montgomerys are insufferable.

Christopher scoffed internally. The audacity of this man, thinking he deserves a second chance.

Their glares locked, tension crackling between them like a live wire. If looks could kill, the room would’ve been a crime scene.

Evelyn, oblivious to the silent battle, spoke earnestly. "Mr. Whitmore, don’t worry. Once I finish my work, I’ll visit Eleanor. I always keep my promises."

Christopher nodded firmly. "Exactly. She held up her end—even convinced Julian to operate on your grandmother. So when are you signing those divorce papers? Don’t even think about backing out now."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "This is between Evelyn and me. Who the hell do you think you are, dictating my life?"

Christopher’s temper flared. "Who am I?" He rolled up his sleeves, stepping forward. "Let me enlighten you—I’m your damn—"

"Enough!" Evelyn grabbed Christopher’s arm, cutting him off.

This was ridiculous. Their petty squabbling was beneath them.

Without another word, she hauled Christopher out of the private room, ignoring Nathaniel’s burning glare. If looks could kill, Christopher would’ve been six feet under.

Left alone, Nathaniel slumped into a chair, snatching the abandoned cigarette box from Theodore’s seat. He lit one but didn’t take a drag—just let it burn between his fingers, lost in thought.

Robert stood silently nearby, watching. He’d never seen Nathaniel like this—defeated, like a stray dog licking its wounds after a brutal fight.

Meanwhile, Evelyn finally managed to drag Christopher outside, her forehead damp with exertion. "Christopher, let’s just go."

"Don’t stop me, Evelyn!" he snapped. "I’m not letting him walk all over you. Who does he think he is? I’m his damn brother-in-law!"

His voice dripped with contempt. "If he wants to marry a Montgomery, he better learn some humility. His arrogance is disgusting."

Realizing reasoning wouldn’t work, Evelyn suddenly swayed, pressing a hand to her forehead. "Christopher… I feel dizzy."

Instantly, his anger evaporated. He guided her into the car, uncapping a water bottle. "Drink this. If you still feel unwell, we’re going straight to Julian."

She gave him a weak smile, her eyes glistening. "I’m fine. Just exhausted. I need to rest."

Just like that, the storm inside Christopher stilled.
###Chapter 456

Evelyn was determined to settle things with that infuriating Nathaniel later!

With Christopher finally driving away, Evelyn let out a long exhale, her shoulders relaxing slightly.

Strolling toward the nearby café, she couldn’t shake off Nathaniel’s odd behavior from earlier.

What had he been trying to say?

Her mind buzzed with questions, but she refused to let his cryptic words unsettle her.

By the time she got home, exhaustion weighed heavily on her.

Lately, the fatigue had become unbearable, especially as her baby bump grew more noticeable each day.

Simple tasks like bending or squatting were becoming increasingly uncomfortable.

Her fingers brushed lightly over her abdomen, a silent promise forming in her mind—she needed to leave soon.

The next morning, Evelyn headed to campus for her scheduled lectures.

As she packed up her notes, Elizabeth approached her. "Evelyn, Mr. Winslow wants to see you in his office. He said it’s important."

Heat crept up Evelyn’s neck at the memory of last night’s awkward, unfinished dinner.

Why did Theodore want to talk to her now?

Was it about keeping her divorce quiet?

It struck her then—maybe his kindness stemmed from knowing about her past with Nathaniel.

Steeling herself, she knocked on his office door.

Theodore’s cheerful voice greeted her. "Evelyn! Come in, have a seat."

He leaned forward, excitement gleaming in his eyes. "I called you here because of your outstanding performance yesterday. The Music School faculty was blown away."

"They’re suggesting you consider adding piano as a second major. What do you think?"

Evelyn blinked. "You want me to major in music?"

"Exactly. Don’t worry about the paperwork—the professors will handle everything. The university loves nurturing talent like yours."

Her stomach twisted.

She loved music, but was she really that good?

Something felt off.

Nathaniel’s face flashed in her mind.

After a pause, she shook her head. "I appreciate the offer, Mr. Winslow, but I’m close to finishing my current degree. I’m not looking to add another major right now."

His smile faltered. "Are you sure? This is a rare opportunity."

"My mind’s made up."

Theodore didn’t push further.

The moment Evelyn left, he grabbed his phone and dialed Robert.

"Hey, I pitched the music major to Evelyn, but she turned it down. Said she wasn’t interested. Could you pass that along to Mr. Whitmore?"

Robert’s face darkened.

Nathaniel had stormed into the office early, his foul mood making the entire executive team walk on eggshells.

This news would only fuel his temper.

Taking a deep breath, Robert knocked on Nathaniel’s door. "Sir, do you have a minute? There’s something you should know."

Nathaniel didn’t look up. "Make it quick."

"It’s about Mr. Winslow’s call. Maybe I should—"

"Wait." Nathaniel’s head snapped up, his gaze sharp. "What did he say?"

Robert hesitated. "He said Ms. Carter declined the music major. She just… wasn’t interested."

Nathaniel’s pen stilled.

His jaw tightened, irritation flickering across his face. He hadn’t expected this.

She’d seemed so alive on that stage yesterday.

"Why would she refuse?" he muttered, more to himself.

Just then, the office door burst open as a woman strode in.
###Chapter 457

Nathaniel looked up, his brow furrowing slightly. "What are you doing here?"

"Nat, I tried calling you last night, but you didn’t answer. I told you I had something important to discuss."

Beatrice stepped into the office, her agitation evident. "Why didn’t you return my call?"

Nathaniel remained composed. "I had urgent matters to handle."

She sank onto the sofa, her designer clutch gripped tightly in her hands. "Nat, I heard you finalized the divorce and transferred all your shares to Evelyn. Is that true?"

Nathaniel realized Beatrice must have gotten this information from Victoria. The thought of others knowing about his divorce unsettled him—it was a blow to his pride.

Keeping his expression neutral, he confirmed, "Yes, that’s correct."

Yet, Nathaniel couldn’t ignore the fact that he hadn’t thoroughly reviewed the divorce settlement agreement before signing it.

"Nat, how could you be so careless? Don’t you understand what giving Evelyn all your shares means?"

Beatrice’s voice sharpened. "You’re essentially surrendering your position as CEO of Whitmore Enterprises, handing over control of the entire company! Have you no regard for our family’s legacy?"

She had intended to confront him the night before, but when he never came home, her frustration only grew.

She couldn’t fathom how Evelyn had manipulated Nathaniel into making such a reckless decision.

The more Beatrice thought about it, the angrier she became. "Nat, did Evelyn deceive you into signing that agreement?"

Nathaniel rubbed his temples. "Mother, don’t worry about it. I’ll handle this myself."

"How can I not worry?" Beatrice snapped. "No matter what tricks Evelyn plays, she won’t get away with this."

With that, she pulled a document from her bag and slapped it onto the desk.

"From the beginning, I was wary of Evelyn. Given her background, who knows what she was plotting? I never thought I’d actually need this."

Nathaniel glanced down. "What is this?"

"A prenuptial agreement." Beatrice’s lips thinned. "Given Evelyn’s humble origins, it was only natural to protect our assets. This states that in case of divorce, she leaves with nothing—not a single penny."

Nathaniel’s frown deepened as he took the document and scanned its contents. At the bottom, he spotted Evelyn’s signature.

His mood darkened instantly. "Mother, who told you to do this?"

Nathaniel had been completely unaware of this arrangement. He had always assumed Evelyn married him for the Whitmore fortune.

Now, faced with the prenuptial agreement, he couldn’t understand why she had agreed to marry him at all if she stood to gain nothing.

Clutching the document, Nathaniel felt as if he’d been slapped. The realization hit him hard—he had misjudged Evelyn entirely.

She hadn’t married him for money.

His emotions churned as he exhaled sharply.

Seeing his reaction, Beatrice grew uneasy. "Nat, don’t worry. With this, even if Evelyn tries to dispute the divorce, she won’t win."

She scoffed. "Honestly, who would willingly give up their claim to assets? It’s suspicious from the start."

Nathaniel stood in silence, gripping the prenuptial agreement tightly. "Mother, why didn’t you tell me about this sooner?"

Beatrice hesitated. "I—I thought I mentioned it before."

She crossed her arms. "I was prepared to confront Evelyn, but when I heard you already knew, I didn’t push further."

She sighed. "In the end, it seems it wouldn’t have made a difference either way."
###Chapter 458

Nathaniel's fingers clenched around his silk tie, his frustration palpable. The prenuptial agreement sprawled across his desk felt like a cruel joke, a stark reminder of the chasm between him and Evelyn.

What infuriated him most was how effortlessly she let him label her as greedy. She never fought back, never defended herself.

Closing his eyes, Nathaniel was assaulted by memories—Evelyn's quiet explanations, her wounded gaze. He had dismissed every word.

He prided himself on reading people, yet Evelyn remained an enigma. The realization gnawed at him, guilt settling like a stone in his chest.

"Nat, what's wrong? I spoke to Evelyn at the university hall yesterday. She won't dare bring up the property settlement again."

Nathaniel's grip tightened. His voice was dangerously low. "What did you say to her?"

Beatrice smirked. "I gave her the divorce papers to review. Well, a copy, really. Didn’t want her destroying the original in a fit of emotion."

"Maybe this will wake her up from her delusions."

Nathaniel remembered yesterday—Evelyn laughing with Christopher, her smile bright. But when their eyes met, hers had turned cold. Distant.

He assumed she had moved on.

Only later did he realize Beatrice's interference. Yet Evelyn said nothing.

With a sharp motion, Nathaniel crumpled the divorce agreement in his fist. Beatrice flinched. "Nat! What are you doing?"

His voice was steel. "Mother, go home. I have work to do."

"Let me keep the document for you—"

He jerked it out of reach, his glare silencing her. "This is my matter. I’ll handle it."

Beatrice huffed. "Fine. Just don’t lose it. And don’t forget—your grandmother’s recovering well. You should finalize the divorce soon."

Alone, Nathaniel stared at the crumpled paper, his thoughts a storm.

Evelyn strode into the hospital, her steps light but her heart heavy. The past days had been consumed by her university hall design, leaving no time to visit Eleanor.

Now, with her project complete and credits secured, she could focus on her escape from Bern City.

The bodyguard at the private ward didn’t stop her.

Knocking softly, she entered with a fruit basket. "Grandma, I’m here."

Eleanor’s face lit up. "Evelyn, you shouldn’t have brought anything. Just seeing you is gift enough." Adjusting her glasses, she patted the bed. "Come, help me decide. I’ve been agonizing for days."

"Decide what?"

Sitting beside her, Evelyn watched as Eleanor scrolled through baby cribs and strollers on her tablet.

Her chest tightened.

Eleanor dreamed of her great-grandchildren.

Evelyn dreamed of vanishing.

Taking a shaky breath, she whispered, "Grandma... there’s something I need to tell you."
###Chapter 459

Evelyn watched Eleanor's radiant smile as she browsed through baby items, her heart twisting with guilt.

If she vanished without warning later, Eleanor would be shattered - not just for her, but for the grandchildren she believed were coming.

Perhaps the kindest thing would be to reveal the deception now.

Evelyn considered confessing that her pregnancy was merely a ruse to convince Eleanor to undergo the life-saving surgery.

Though the revelation would hurt, it might spare Eleanor greater pain when Evelyn eventually disappeared from Bern City.

"Evelyn dear, you wanted to tell me something?" Eleanor's gentle voice interrupted her thoughts.

Meeting those warm eyes, Evelyn felt tears prick her own. "Grandmother, I need to confess something. All this time, I've been—"

"Grandmother!" Nathaniel's commanding voice sliced through the room like a blade.

The door swung open as he strode in, his polished Oxfords clicking against the tile floor. Evelyn's breath hitched when she saw him - immaculate in his navy pinstripe suit, the crisp white cuffs of his shirt peeking beneath the jacket.

Her fingers curled into fists. She'd been moments from the truth.

Of course Nathaniel would appear precisely when she least wanted him to. The timing was infuriating.

At this hour, shouldn't he be buried in paperwork at Whitmore Enterprises? What business did he have disrupting her confession?

Eleanor arched an eyebrow at her grandson. "Finally decided to visit your ailing grandmother, have you?"

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "I was here Thursday, Grandmother."

Eleanor huffed. "Coming alone? You might as well have stayed away." Her demeanor softened as she turned back to Evelyn. "Now darling, why don't you choose something you like?"

"I'll have it purchased and prepared for when your little ones arrive."

Evelyn's stomach churned at Eleanor's joyful anticipation.

Accepting the tablet, she stared at the screen displaying luxury cribs and designer strollers, her throat tightening.

"By the way," Eleanor added, "what were you about to say earlier?"

The tablet grew heavy in Evelyn's hands. Under Nathaniel's piercing gaze, the confession withered on her tongue.

"Nothing important," she forced a smile. "Just that my university hall design project was approved. I wanted to share the good news."

Eleanor beamed. "Marvelous! Now that your workload has lightened, you must rest properly."

"I've noticed you've lost weight, darling. Pregnancy takes its toll - don't make me worry about you."

Evelyn nodded. "After this busy period, I'll focus solely on my final classes and graduation preparations."

At the word "graduation," Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. Eleanor nodded approvingly. "Excellent. Once you've graduated, you can concentrate on your health. We'll handle everything else after the babies come."

Evelyn kept her eyes fixed on the tablet, unable to meet Eleanor's expectant gaze. The cheerful pastel nursery items blurred before her eyes.

"Grandmother, it's difficult to choose without seeing the items in person."

Eleanor brightened. "Since Nathaniel's here, why don't you both visit the boutique together?"

Evelyn's head snapped up. "I'm sure he's far too busy—"

"I have time," Nathaniel interjected smoothly. "We can go now."
###Chapter 460

Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at Nathaniel.

Could he really be this oblivious to her efforts? She remembered how he used to resent Eleanor's attempts to force them together.

Yet now that Nathaniel had agreed, Evelyn found herself reluctantly going along with it.

She rose gracefully from her chair. "Grandmother, I'll visit again soon."

"Of course, dear. Don't forget to send me photos of your selections." Eleanor's eyes twinkled. "If only these old legs would cooperate, I'd love to join you myself."

Nathaniel surprised them both by adding, "There will be plenty of opportunities once you've recovered, Grandmother."

Evelyn shot him a questioning glance, confusion flickering in her hazel eyes.

This made no sense. Nathaniel believed the twins weren't his. Why would he say something so misleading?

They walked down the hospital corridor in tense silence until Evelyn couldn't take it anymore.

"You shouldn't mention the babies to Eleanor," she said quietly. "The truth would devastate her."

With her planned departure from Bern City approaching, Evelyn worried about Eleanor's fragile health.

Nathaniel's expression turned serious. "Then we simply won't tell her."

Evelyn stopped mid-step. "What do you mean? She'll find out eventually."

"As long as we keep our secret, those twins will be considered Whitmore heirs." His voice held an odd certainty.

Evelyn's mind reeled. Was Nathaniel really willing to claim another man's children to protect Eleanor?

But deception wasn't the answer.

"Mr. Whitmore," she began carefully, "with Eleanor recovering, perhaps we should finalize our divorce."

Nathaniel's entire body tensed at the word. "No. Not until she's fully healed."

Evelyn's grip tightened on his arm. "I can't wait that long. Neither can these babies."

He looked down, his stormy gray eyes locking with hers. "Then have them. Am I not capable of raising two children?"

"Have you lost your mind?" Evelyn's voice rose slightly. "They're not yours! Why would you—"

She couldn't comprehend his sudden change. The Nathaniel she knew would never tolerate such a situation.

What he didn't know was her entire pregnancy story had been a lie to hasten their divorce.

Yet here he stood, offering to raise another man's children.

As Evelyn's fingers dug into his sleeve, Nathaniel's expression shifted before he regained composure.

"Children don't particularly interest me," he said evenly. "But if you remain a Whitmore, I'll acknowledge them as my heirs."

Evelyn was speechless. This wasn't part of her plan.

Her hand instinctively moved to her rounded belly. "And what if... what if they were yours?"

The question hung between them like an unspoken challenge.
###Chapter 461

Evelyn had asked Nathaniel countless times before, but he remained stubbornly opposed to keeping her twins.

This only intensified her desperation to leave Bern City and put as much distance between them as possible.

Nathaniel frowned slightly, his expression puzzled by Evelyn's words. Was she implying that she wanted to have children with him someday?

His voice was solemn as he reassured her, "I won't have any biological children. You have my word."

After all, the two children Evelyn carried were more than enough for him.

Evelyn's breath hitched. She pressed her lips together, ready to press further—

But before she could speak, Victoria Hawthorne caught up to them, interrupting, "Mr. Whitmore, Mrs. Whitmore, you're still here?"

Evelyn quickly released Nathaniel's arm and glanced up at him, unable to ignore how devastatingly handsome he looked under the soft lighting.

His dark, unreadable eyes met hers. Then, with a faint touch, Nathaniel tapped her forehead lightly. "Let's go."

The ghost of his fingertips lingered on her skin as Evelyn quickly averted her gaze, choosing silence.

With Victoria nearby, she couldn't risk revealing anything.

Despite Nathaniel's outwardly gentle demeanor, Evelyn knew it was nothing more than a carefully constructed façade for their audience.

As they stepped into the elevator, Victoria followed, chirping, "Perfect timing!"

"Mrs. Whitmore Senior was worried you two might struggle with the selection, so she asked me to tag along and assist. Don't worry, I won't be in the way."

Inside the elevator, Evelyn studied their reflections on the polished doors—Nathaniel's tall, imposing figure, Victoria's cheerful smile, and her own guarded expression.

Amidst the quiet hum of the elevator, her mind churned over Nathaniel's earlier words, leaving her emotions in turmoil.

Nathaniel stood silently, his gaze briefly flickering toward Evelyn in his periphery, yet unable to decipher her expression.

Despite his composed exterior, Nathaniel was anything but calm.

After speaking those words, he questioned his own sanity. Could he truly stomach the idea of Evelyn carrying another man's child?

Once known for his decisiveness, Nathaniel was startled to find himself wavering—overwhelmed by emotions he couldn't control.

The car ride was silent, tension thick between them, until they finally arrived at an upscale mall specializing in luxury maternity and baby products.

Stepping out, Evelyn took in the sight before her. She had longed to visit before, but fear of its grandeur—and the risk of running into someone she knew—had always held her back.

Yet by some twist of fate, here she was, walking in without hesitation.

The store manager greeted them warmly the moment they entered. "Mr. and Mrs. Whitmore, welcome! It's an honor to assist you today."

"If you'd prefer privacy, I can arrange a VIP room where we can bring everything for your selection."

Evelyn turned to Nathaniel. "You go ahead. I'd like to browse on my own first."

Now that she was finally here, she wanted to explore, to see what she might need with her own eyes.

Photos in a VIP room wouldn't compare to seeing the actual products.

She started walking with Victoria, knowing Nathaniel despised wasting time on such trivialities.

But after only a few steps, Nathaniel caught up effortlessly.

Startled, Evelyn couldn't help stealing another glance at him—his noble features, the sharp line of his jaw, the way he carried himself with effortless authority.

"Victoria, take a break," Nathaniel instructed.

"Of course. It's better for Mr. Whitmore to accompany you anyway," Victoria said before excusing herself.

Evelyn paused, her voice softening with disbelief. "Nathaniel, did you take the wrong medication today?"

He loomed over her, his presence overwhelming.

His dark eyes bore into hers, unreadable. "What's so strange about a husband accompanying his pregnant wife to shop for their child?"
###Chapter 462

That was precisely the issue!

Evelyn's heart pounded as she opened her mouth to speak, but Nathaniel abruptly pulled her close.

His strong arm encircled her shoulders, his large hand gripping her forearm firmly, drawing her nearly flush against his body.

As her cheek pressed against his chest, Evelyn could feel the crisp texture of Nathaniel's tailored suit jacket against her skin.

"Don't move," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. "Victoria is watching us."

Confused, Evelyn subtly glanced sideways and indeed spotted Victoria Hawthorne lurking nearby, her watchful eyes trained on them.

Snapping her gaze forward, Evelyn whispered, "What's Victoria doing here?"

"Grandmother's orders, no doubt," Nathaniel replied smoothly. "Your earlier behavior made her suspicious. Now she's sent Victoria to spy on us. Keep walking and don't look back - we can't afford to seem suspicious."

Evelyn obediently matched Nathaniel's pace as they strolled forward. "Must we have so many people following us?" she muttered under her breath. "It's making me nervous."

With a subtle gesture to Robert beside him, Nathaniel signaled for their entourage to disperse.

The elevator doors closed behind them, sealing Evelyn and Nathaniel in temporary privacy.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her shoulders relaxing slightly. "Victoria can't see us now, right?"

"Probably not," Nathaniel answered, yet his arm remained firmly around her waist.

The proximity made Evelyn's skin tingle uncomfortably. She attempted to create some distance between them.

But Nathaniel only tightened his hold, pulling her flush against his side once more.

When her forehead bumped against his chest, Evelyn's vision swam momentarily.

"Considering Victoria's resourcefulness," Nathaniel said in a low voice, "she'll likely take the next elevator up. She's quite persistent about surveillance. If we're going to maintain this act, we should commit fully."

Evelyn felt heat rise to her cheeks. "Must we stay like this?"

"What would you prefer instead?" Nathaniel's intense gaze made Evelyn instinctively retreat.

The elevator's cheerful ding announced their arrival.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn pushed away from Nathaniel and hurried out, the confined space having made every breath feel like a struggle.

Yet as she lifted her eyes, she saw Victoria emerging from the adjacent elevator.

Nathaniel's prediction had been frighteningly accurate.

"In such a hurry?" Nathaniel's voice came from directly behind her. Before Evelyn could react, his warm hand closed around hers.

Guided by his firm touch, Evelyn couldn't help but steal a glance at Nathaniel's profile.

Bathed in the mall's ambient lighting, his striking features looked impossibly perfect, commanding attention effortlessly.

Walking hand-in-hand, Evelyn trailed slightly behind, their fingers tightly intertwined.

To any observer, they appeared the picture of marital bliss - though his grip held an undeniable dominance that allowed no chance of escape.

Initially tense, Evelyn gradually relaxed as they walked.

After all, this was merely an act. What was there to fear?

With this perspective, Evelyn found herself drawn to the displays in a nearby boutique specializing in infant wear.

Nathaniel, noticing her distraction, followed as she wandered into the shop.

Evelyn's fingers traced over tiny garments, marveling at their impossibly small proportions and soft fabrics.

"May I help you?" The shop assistant, Tara, approached with a warm smile. "How old is your little one?"

"Not born yet," Nathaniel answered smoothly, his eyes flickering to Evelyn's midsection with unexpected softness.

Tara immediately produced a pair of miniature socks. "In that case, sir, you might want to stock up on these. They're perfect for newborns."

Nathaniel accepted the offering, examining the tiny socks that barely covered his palm.
###Chapter 463

Nathaniel held the miniature socks in his palm, his throat tightening as an unfamiliar warmth spread through his chest.

He had never been around infants before. The delicate fabric felt foreign against his skin—softer than he’d imagined, almost fragile.

With a quick motion, he placed them back on the shelf, his movements stiff, as if the tiny garments might suddenly come to life.

Evelyn watched him, a flicker of worry crossing her gaze. Did he truly dislike children this much?

But it didn’t matter. She had already resolved to raise the twins on her own. She wouldn’t burden him.

Turning to the sales assistant, she smiled. "Could you help me pick out a few outfits?"

They couldn’t leave empty-handed, not with Victoria Hawthorne lurking nearby, observing their every move.

Before the assistant could respond, Nathaniel cut in. "A few? We’ll take twenty."

The assistant’s eyes lit up. "Of course! I’ll gather them immediately."

Evelyn blinked. "Twenty? That’s excessive."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Do you think I can’t afford it?"

"That’s not the point," she wanted to say, but bit her tongue.

The assistant returned, eager. "Anything else, sir? Madam?"

Nathaniel gestured lazily at the display. "Everything. Clothes, shoes, coats—whatever you have."

"Everything?" The assistant gaped.

Evelyn tugged at his sleeve, but he merely glanced down at her. "We’ll use them and discard them when they’re worn out."

She nearly choked. Who treated baby clothes as disposable?

Nathaniel guided her out, his grip firm. "Don’t we need a stroller? A crib?"

Evelyn hesitated, wanting to signal that they didn’t need so much. But then she remembered—Victoria was still watching.

This was all for show.

Swallowing her protests, she followed him back inside. The assistant eagerly presented several crib options.

Nathaniel didn’t hesitate. "Wrap them all."

The assistant paled. "All twelve? How many children do you have?"

He shrugged. "The twins might be picky. Better to have options."

Evelyn couldn’t take it anymore. She pointed to one. "Just two of these. They’re perfect."

Nathaniel frowned. "What if they don’t like them?"

"Since when do newborns have opinions?" she shot back. "Not everyone is as fussy as you."

A faint smirk tugged at his lips. "Fine. We’ll take her recommendation."
###Chapter 464

The moment they secured the baby cribs, Evelyn and Nathaniel moved toward the stroller section.

Determined to prevent Nathaniel from purchasing the entire store, Evelyn took charge. She carefully selected two sleek, modern strollers herself.

Surrounded by tiny onesies and plush toys, the reality of impending motherhood finally settled over Evelyn.

Checking her watch, she was startled to realize they had completed all their shopping in under an hour.

Nathaniel’s no-nonsense efficiency had streamlined the process.

Yet, as they stepped out of the boutique, an unspoken tension lingered between them. This was, after all, their first shopping trip together.

Their path led them to an exhibition hall, its purpose unclear.

A staff member, Michelle Lexington, approached with a warm smile.

"Mr. and Mrs. Whitmore, as valued patrons of our mall, we’d love to offer you a complimentary parenting workshop."

"If you have time, we’d be delighted to have you join us inside."

Intrigued—and admittedly in need of guidance—Evelyn agreed.

Nathaniel, however, remained rooted in place.

Michelle turned to him. "Sir, these sessions are most effective when both parents attend."

"Raising a child is a shared responsibility, after all."

Evelyn’s lips twitched at the thought of Nathaniel, ever the stoic CEO, changing diapers. The image was almost laughable.

She waved a hand. "You can wait outside if you prefer. I won’t be long."

To her surprise, Nathaniel stepped forward, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn studied him, sensing something different in his demeanor.

Inside the classroom, young couples were already engaged in the lecture. Evelyn found a seat, listening intently.

The instructor, Heidi Thurman, demonstrated prenatal yoga poses—some requiring a partner’s assistance.

As Evelyn attempted a stretch, a firm hand guided her arm upward. She glanced up, meeting Nathaniel’s steady gaze.

"Let me help," he murmured, his voice low.

Evelyn nodded, refocusing on Heidi’s instructions.

Throughout the session, they moved in surprising harmony. Nathaniel adjusted her posture with quiet precision, his touch unexpectedly gentle.

By the end, Evelyn was pleasantly exhausted, her muscles warm and loose.

Stepping outside, she scanned the area. "Where’s Victoria?"

"Likely on her way back," Nathaniel replied.

Evelyn smirked. "After today’s shopping spree, she’ll have quite the report for your grandmother. You played your part well—she’d never suspect a thing."

A beat of silence passed before Evelyn ventured, "We didn’t make it to the courthouse today. Are you free tomorrow?"

Nathaniel halted, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

Evelyn looked away. "If there’s an issue, don’t worry. Victoria already destroyed the property agreement, and I signed the prenup."

"It won’t affect you. I’m not after your assets."

In response, Nathaniel pulled a crumpled document from Robert’s hand. "This?"

Evelyn recognized it instantly. "Yes, that’s the original."

Without hesitation, Nathaniel tore it in half.
###Chapter 465

Evelyn's breath hitched as Nathaniel tore the prenuptial agreement to shreds before her very eyes.

"What in the world—?"

She couldn’t believe it. The contract—the one that had dictated the terms of their marriage—was now nothing but scattered pieces in his hands.

Nathaniel clenched the torn papers tightly, his voice unwavering. "We don’t need this anymore."

That tone. It sent a shiver down Evelyn’s spine, reminding her of their conversation at the hospital weeks ago.

She lowered her gaze, her fingers curling into her palms. "Even without this document, I never wanted anything from you. Let’s just finalize the divorce this week."

As she turned to leave, Nathaniel’s hand closed around her wrist. His touch was warm—too warm.

Her pulse jumped. "What are you doing?"

His voice was low, rough with something she couldn’t place. "Evelyn, I was wrong about you. I didn’t know about this agreement. There’s no reason for us to end things now."

She froze, stunned into silence.

When she finally looked up, her smile was bittersweet. "If you’d said that six months ago—even three—I would have been ecstatic. But now…"

"Now what?" Nathaniel demanded. The unease in his chest grew as he studied her expression.

Her eyes held his, steady and resolute. "Now, I know divorce is the right choice."

"If it’s about the twins, don’t worry. I meant what I said—I’ll treat them as my own."

Evelyn shook her head. "It’s not just about them. Nathaniel, I married you because I loved you back then."

She took a breath. "Now, I want a marriage built on love, not just convenience."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "I can’t promise to love you. But as Mrs. Whitmore, you’ll have everything—status, wealth, influence."

To him, mutual benefit was the foundation of any lasting relationship.

Evelyn’s voice softened. "That’s not what I want. I want love."

She knew Nathaniel wasn’t pushing for divorce because of Eleanor, but she refused to settle.

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn pulled her hand free. "Mr. Whitmore, let’s end this amicably."

Nathaniel tugged at his tie, frustration simmering beneath his skin.

He wanted to stop her—to say something, anything—but the words wouldn’t come. Emotions had never been his strength.

Finally, he asked, "Is that why you’re rushing to finish your credits? So you can take the twins and Julian back to Nord City?"

Evelyn’s breath caught. How did he know?

Nathaniel saw the flicker of panic in her eyes and knew he’d hit the mark. Yet the victory felt hollow.

"Evelyn, the Montgomery family’s situation is complicated. Nord City isn’t safe for you. Stay here."

At least within the Whitmore family, she had Eleanor—and him—to shield her.

"That’s my decision," she said firmly.

Nathaniel’s knowledge of her brothers’ affairs unsettled her. Had he been investigating them?

Yet, it seemed he still didn’t know about her connection to Julian.

A stroke of luck—or a missed opportunity?

She met his gaze one last time. "I should go."

"Wait." Nathaniel reached for a small box on the table. "Take these with you."
###Chapter 466

Evelyn spun around and noticed the carefully arranged packages. They appeared to be baby clothes, since the nursery furniture and stroller had likely been delivered separately.

After hesitating briefly, she proposed, "Maybe we should send these back. Martha isn't here anymore, and she wouldn't notice."

Nathaniel's brow creased in response. "Do you think I can't afford these? Keep them. You're leaving soon anyway. Consider them presents for the twins."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. Since when did Nathaniel care about children?

Right now, she couldn't decipher Nathaniel's motives at all.

She looked away. "The babies aren't due for months, and nobody knows I'm pregnant yet. I don't want to haul all this home so soon."

Nathaniel's eyes sharpened. Did this mean Julian didn't know about her condition?

Perhaps Evelyn had doubts about Julian after all.

This thought visibly improved Nathaniel's mood. "Then we'll store them at my place for now. You can collect them whenever you're ready."

"Besides," Evelyn added lightly, "you might need them yourself someday."

"I told you I'm never having biological children," Nathaniel snapped, his frown deepening.

Seeing his stern expression, Evelyn felt even less inclined to reveal the truth about her pregnancy.

Yet she couldn't bear the thought of her children growing up without a father's love.

After leaving the mall, Evelyn went straight to campus to study, her upcoming finals weighing on her mind.

"Evelyn?"

She turned to see Danielle approaching.

"Danielle! Where have you been? I haven't heard from you in weeks. I even got that conductor's autograph for you - you could've taken photos with him!"

Danielle looked sheepish. "Family issues kept me away. What about you? Been busy?"

"Just cramming for exams to graduate faster. You know I've been delayed years because of missing credits," Evelyn explained.

"What are your plans after graduation?"

"I'm moving to Nord City." A soft smile touched Evelyn's lips at the mention of her family's hometown.

After chatting awhile, Danielle excused herself to the restroom.

Once outside, she quickly dialed Victoria. "Ms. Sinclair? I've got news. Evelyn plans to relocate to Nord City after graduation."

"Nord City?" Victoria's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. "You're certain?"

How dare that little bitch consider moving to Nord City?

Had Evelyn remembered something? Or worse - had the Montgomerys already discovered her true identity?

No, impossible. If they'd found their real heiress, it would be public knowledge by now.

Victoria's face hardened. "Find out why she's going there. Immediately. We're running out of time."

She needed answers before Evelyn made that move.

If things were truly unraveling, she'd have to take drastic measures.

Ending the call, Victoria sped to the hospital to interrogate Julian.

She marched straight to his office. "Julian, got a minute?"

"I'm swamped. What do you want?" His tone was glacial.

Victoria took a steadying breath. "I have incredible news - I've located the true Montgomery heiress."
###Chapter 467

Julian Montgomery's expression darkened when Victoria Sinclair spoke. Could she have discovered Evelyn Carter's true identity?

That seemed impossible. If Victoria truly knew who Evelyn was, her reaction would be entirely different.

Julian quickly composed himself. "Really? Did you recall some forgotten details from the orphanage records?"

Victoria's face showed slight discomfort.

"Yes, it came to me recently. When I saw her on campus, I immediately felt this strange familiarity since we used to be close friends."

"Only yesterday did I realize she might be the person your family has been searching for."

"Why didn't you mention this yesterday?" Julian's gaze turned probing.

Victoria answered smoothly, "There have been so many false leads over the years. I didn't want to disappoint you again."

"So I had someone discreetly verify her identity first before bringing you this good news."

Seeing Victoria's confident demeanor, Julian pressed further. "Who exactly is this person you've found?"

"Her name is Danielle Spencer, a Literature major. We grew up in the same orphanage. It wasn't until we reminisced about childhood that I recognized her."

Julian nodded. "I'll conduct a thorough investigation."

"In that case, I'll contact Alexander immediately. He and Sebastian should come meet their long-lost relative."

A cold glint flashed in Julian's eyes. "Of course," he replied.

Victoria's spirits lifted at his compliance.

"By the way, Julian, I noticed Evelyn getting quite close with Christopher at yesterday's music event. When did she become so familiar with our family?"

Detecting her probing, Julian responded calmly, "I can't explain it, but I feel an instant connection with Evelyn, like she's my little sister. I believe Christopher feels the same."

Victoria's smile faltered momentarily. "I see! But now that we've found your real sister, you won't need a substitute anymore."

Julian's gaze deepened. "You're right. With my biological sister found, there's no need for stand-ins."

"Very well, Julian. I won't disturb you further."

As Victoria walked away, a triumphant smirk crossed her face. With Danielle assuming Evelyn's identity, her position as heiress would be secured.

Danielle's vanity knew no bounds. If she could steal her best friend's identity, what couldn't she achieve?

But that wasn't enough - Evelyn needed to be completely eliminated as a threat!

As long as Evelyn was gone, she could never threaten Victoria's status.

Exiting the building, Victoria approached Robert. "Have you found anything useful in your investigation of Evelyn?"

"I've discovered something crucial: Evelyn is actually pregnant. These are prenatal records from the hospital, though not under her name."

"Through my inquiries during this period, I've confirmed Evelyn attended these appointments."

Victoria's expression hardened. "She's pregnant? Who's the father?"

"The paternity is unclear. But Mr. Julian has been helping conceal Evelyn's pregnancy and fabricating her false identity."

Learning about the pregnancy made Victoria seethe with anger.

Had she known earlier, she might have suspected Julian was the father. But now, she couldn't shake the conviction the child was Nathaniel's!

Given the timing of Evelyn's pregnancy and her intimate encounter with Nathaniel, everything aligned perfectly!
###Chapter 468

Victoria's eyes darkened with malice as she hissed, "I've clearly underestimated her. She's slipped right through my fingers!"

"Everyone believed she faked her pregnancy to manipulate Mrs. Whitmore, but who would've thought Evelyn was actually carrying a child? She played us all!"

It was obvious now—Evelyn had planned to secretly deliver Nathaniel's heir in Nord City, using the baby to cement her position as Mrs. Whitmore.

That had to be her scheme.

And now, with the looming possibility that Evelyn might be the true heiress of the Montgomery family, nothing stood in her way.

Would Victoria be left humiliated in the end?

Absolutely not.

A murderous glint flashed in Victoria's eyes as she turned to her accomplice. "We need to eliminate Evelyn—and the child in her womb—before it's too late."

This was Evelyn's own doing.

After Victoria stormed off, Julian took a deep breath before dialing Alexander.

"Alex, we have a problem."

He relayed everything Victoria had uncovered over the phone.

Alexander's voice turned grave. "She's onto us. That decoy was a deliberate distraction."

"Exactly. She's been stalling us, pretending not to know Evelyn's location while sending us on a wild goose chase."

Julian's tone sharpened. "We can't let Victoria stay in play any longer."

"Agreed. On another note, all of Evelyn's legal documents are ready. It's time we paid her a visit—expose Victoria's lies and make sure she faces the consequences."

"Couldn't have said it better myself."

After hanging up, Julian smirked. Mercy wasn't an option for anyone who dared harm Evelyn.

Meanwhile, Evelyn remained on campus, buried in textbooks for her upcoming exams.

Still, she couldn't resist stealing glances at her phone, typing out another message to Nathaniel. "Mr. Whitmore, when will you be free to finalize our divorce?"

Yet, like all the others, it vanished into the void—no reply.

Across town, Nathaniel sat in his office, staring blankly at Evelyn's unanswered texts.

Abruptly, he looked up at Robert. "How do I stop this divorce from happening?"

Robert hesitated. "Maybe... try sweet-talking her?"

Sweet-talking?

Nathaniel frowned. He'd never had to coax a woman before.

Evelyn spent the entire day in the library, drowning in notes.

By evening, she finally packed up, ready to head home.

As she neared the university gates, a crowd had gathered outside.

"Damn, that's a luxury car. And that man? Unreal."

"Who's the lucky girl? If he's single, I'm making my move!"

Evelyn arched a brow. A public proposal?

Danielle, ever the gossip, dragged her forward. "Come on, I need to see this!"

Reluctant but curious, Evelyn let herself be pulled to the front—and froze.

There, leaning against a sleek sports car, stood Nathaniel.

Dressed casually but no less striking, he exuded effortless elegance. His sharp features commanded attention, his presence magnetic.

Then, as if sensing her, he turned—and their eyes locked.

Her heart stuttered.
###Chapter 469

Evelyn Carter's breath hitched as Nathaniel Whitmore's piercing gaze locked onto hers. She quickly averted her eyes, unable to bear the intensity of his stare.

A flicker of confusion crossed her face. Why was Nathaniel here, of all places? He was notoriously private—never one for public appearances.

Around her, excited whispers erupted from the crowd.

Danielle Spencer pinched Evelyn's arm, her grip just shy of painful. "Oh my God, Evelyn! He's coming this way!" Danielle squealed, her voice trembling with excitement. "Who do you think he's looking for? That girl must be the luckiest person alive!"

Though Danielle's words were giddy, Evelyn didn't miss the greedy glint in her eyes. Danielle had written countless romance novels, but she had never imagined herself in one.

Was this her Cinderella moment?

As Nathaniel strode toward them, Evelyn's pulse spiked. Instinctively, she took a step back, her fight-or-flight response kicking in.

Danielle, however, stood frozen, her neck craned as she stared at Nathaniel with wide-eyed anticipation.

Every girl in the vicinity held their breath, hearts pounding, each secretly hoping she was the one Nathaniel sought.

Then he stopped—right in front of Evelyn.

He tilted his head slightly, scanning the crowd until his eyes landed on her.

"I've come to pick you up," he stated, his deep voice cutting through the murmurs.

Evelyn's stomach twisted. What was he thinking?

She didn’t move.

The crowd thickened around them, and Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. He hated being the center of attention. Without another word, he reached out, his hand extended toward her.

Before Evelyn could react, Danielle stepped forward, cheeks flushed. "Um, I—I don’t know you," she stammered, misreading the situation entirely.

Evelyn blinked. Had Danielle really just—?

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "I don’t know you either," he said coldly. "Move aside."

Danielle’s face drained of color. She glanced back at Evelyn, humiliation burning in her eyes.

A nearby girl burst into mocking laughter, and Danielle’s composure shattered. With a furious stomp of her foot, she turned and fled.

"Danielle!" Evelyn called after her, guilt gnawing at her.

Growing up in an orphanage had made Danielle painfully sensitive. This would crush her.

Nathaniel loomed over Evelyn, his presence overwhelming. "Shall we go?" he repeated, his tone brooking no argument.

Evelyn swallowed hard, acutely aware of the dozens of eyes fixed on her. If she didn’t leave now, she’d be the talk of the university by morning.

Without a word, she tugged the brim of her hat lower, spotted a gap in the crowd, and bolted.

Nathaniel’s outstretched hand hung in the air as he watched Evelyn disappear.

His expression turned thunderous.

She’d run from him.

Was he really that terrifying?

He withdrew his hand just as a striking woman sidled up to him. "Hey, handsome," she purred. "You look like you could use some company. How about a drink tonight?"

Nathaniel barely spared her a glance. "No, thank you."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode back to his car.

As he drove away, he dialed Evelyn’s number.

No answer.
###Chapter 470

Nathaniel stared at the crimson rose resting on the passenger seat, wondering what madness had possessed him to make such a romantic gesture.

Across town, Evelyn quickly flagged down a taxi and left the university campus. As the car pulled away, she glanced back through the rear window, her phone vibrating relentlessly in her hand.

She watched the screen light up repeatedly but refused to answer. Evelyn couldn't comprehend Nathaniel's sudden change in behavior.

Memories surfaced of their last conversation while shopping for nursery items. Was this his attempt at salvaging their marriage? The realization hit her - he was only doing this because of Eleanor.

Her phone chimed with a WhatsApp notification. "Why did you run?" Nathaniel's message read.

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the keyboard before she decided against responding.

Another message followed moments later. "Remember, this is Bern City. You can't hide from me."

Anger flared as she immediately called back. "What do you want, Nathaniel?"

His smooth voice answered, "Finally. Why did you leave like that?"

"You appeared out of nowhere causing a scene! How could I focus on my exams with you disrupting everything? What's your real motive here?"

Evelyn's unease grew. Why was she being questioned like this?

"I merely wanted to make amends," Nathaniel replied calmly.

Make amends?

The statement caught her off guard. "I won't be manipulated. And why would you even try?"

Suddenly, understanding dawned on Evelyn.

"You can't possibly think a single rose would make me forget everything and cancel our divorce?" she scoffed.

There was a thoughtful pause before Nathaniel responded, "I don't do this for just anyone."

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "Well Mr. Whitmore, I don't accept gestures from just anyone either."

"Would you like to find out?" His voice dropped an octave.

"Find out what?" she asked cautiously.

"What it's like to be properly courted by me," Nathaniel's deep voice purred through the phone.

Evelyn felt her chest constrict with familiar pain. For three years she'd bent to his will, and now that she'd finally found the strength to leave, he dared to tempt her back.

"No thank you," she said firmly. "I've already had that experience. Never again."

Ending the call, she gazed out at the passing city lights, lost in thought.

Arriving home, Evelyn found Julian and Andrew lounging in the living room. She'd assumed Andrew would have returned to Nord City by now.

As Margaret disappeared into the kitchen, Andrew leaned closer. "Evelyn, there's an issue with your immigration paperwork in Bern City."

"What's wrong?" she asked.

"Since your divorce isn't finalized, Nathaniel's signature is required," Andrew explained.

Evelyn shook her head immediately. "No, he'd never agree. I can't risk telling him."

Given Nathaniel's behavior today, he might not only refuse but actively interfere.

"Evelyn, you should expedite the divorce. If you need help—" Andrew began.

"I'll handle it myself," Evelyn interrupted. "Everything will be settled by week's end."

Andrew smiled. "Good. Alexander arrives in a few days - perfect timing to take you home."

Soon, Alexander and their brothers would expose Victoria's deception and reveal Evelyn as the true Montgomery heiress.
###Chapter 471

The news of Alexander Montgomery's imminent arrival sent Evelyn Carter's heart racing.

Her palms grew clammy at the thought.

If Alexander arrived before Evelyn finalized her divorce from Nathaniel Whitmore, questions would inevitably arise.

Andrew Montgomery wouldn't be able to keep the truth hidden any longer.

Knowing Alexander's volatile nature, Evelyn feared he might cause trouble for Nathaniel upon discovering the situation.

She needed to act fast. No more delays could be tolerated.

The following morning, Evelyn walked into the university library as usual, but Danielle Spencer was conspicuously absent.

Remembering yesterday's awkward encounter outside the library, Evelyn pulled out her phone. "Danielle, are you coming to study today?"

Evelyn understood Danielle's pride and sensitivity, especially given their shared background as orphans. Clear communication was essential.

Meanwhile, Danielle sat reclined in a plush chair at an exclusive spa. She handed her phone to Victoria Sinclair with a smirk. "Evelyn just texted me."

"Danielle, that girl clearly doesn't respect you. How dare she humiliate you like that yesterday?"

"Honestly, you outclass her in every way. Why would a wealthy, handsome man choose her over you?" Victoria remarked.

Danielle's cheeks burned with humiliation. The memory of yesterday's rejection had kept her awake all night.

Walking across campus this morning, she'd imagined whispers and mocking laughter at every turn.

Victoria opened the university forum on her phone.

"People are already gossiping about yesterday's spectacle outside the library. Some are calling you delusional. It's disgusting."

Danielle's face drained of color. "What should I do?"

"This can be fixed easily. That man from yesterday is a billionaire. He wouldn't seriously be interested in Evelyn."

"Probably just some casual flirtation after their meeting at the university event. Evelyn played hard to get for money."

"And you've heard the rumors about her Fleur Design Competition win and scholarships, right? People say she slept her way to those achievements."

Danielle's envy flared. Why did Evelyn always get everything? That handsome billionaire should have been hers!

Victoria smiled knowingly. "Expose Evelyn's true nature, and her reputation will be ruined. Wealthy men care about appearances - he'll drop her immediately."

"But isn't that too harsh?" Danielle hesitated. Evelyn had been kind to her, and Danielle already carried guilt for stealing Evelyn's place as the Lane family heiress's childhood friend.

"Danielle, if you don't act now, how will you face campus gossip when these forum posts spread?"

The words struck home. Danielle valued her reputation above all else and couldn't bear public humiliation.

After a tense silence, Danielle accepted the USB drive from Victoria with a reluctant nod. "Okay, but what if Evelyn finds out?"

"Don't worry. Even if she does, she'll be too busy with her own problems to bother you. Besides, you have me, don't you?"

Somewhat reassured, Danielle pocketed the drive. As she prepared to leave, Victoria stopped her.

"Why not finish your facial first? Use my membership. Ask for whatever treatments you want."

"Thank you, Ms. Sinclair." Danielle's eyes lit up with greedy delight. She'd never imagined experiencing such luxury.

Watching Danielle's vain excitement, Victoria slipped from the private room, her smile vanishing instantly.

"Keep close watch on Danielle. No mistakes," she ordered an assistant.

"Ms. Sinclair, I've heard Mr. Alexander is returning to Bern City. The exact date isn't confirmed, but likely within days."

"I know. Alexander will come. After all, I've announced we've found the true Montgomery heiress. Naturally he'd want to see for himself."

Victoria's expression turned icy at the mention of the real heiress. The Montgomerys' urgency in these matters always reminded her she was merely a placeholder.
###Chapter 472

The possibility that Evelyn might be the true heiress of the Montgomery family only deepened Victoria’s reluctance.

Something felt off to Julian.

"Ms. Sinclair," he said carefully, "I can’t shake the feeling that something isn’t right here."

"In the past, whenever rumors about finding the real heiress surfaced, the family would react immediately—passionately."

"But this time, their response has been strangely muted, don’t you think? Alexander didn’t even ask about it."

Victoria frowned. Now that he mentioned it, it was odd.

Just as doubt crept into her mind, Julian’s call came through.

A faint smirk curled her lips. "Julian’s calling. He’s fishing for information."

"Aside from Sebastian, they all distrust me—especially since I’m the one who ‘found’ the heiress this time. Their caution is understandable."

She answered smoothly. "Julian. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

It was unusual for him to reach out first.

"Victoria, Sebastian arrives in two days. I’d like to meet the girl you found before he gets here."

"Julian, there’s no need to rush. If you visit her alone, she might grow suspicious."

"Let’s wait until everyone is present. We don’t want to scare her off, do we?"

Victoria couldn’t risk him meeting Danielle alone. That would ruin everything.

After a pause, Julian relented. "Fine. We’ll go together the day after tomorrow."

"Make sure she’s safe until then."

"Of course," Victoria purred. "She’s my dearest friend. I couldn’t be happier she’s coming home."

The moment the call ended, Julian scoffed. "That should ease her suspicions."

Andrew nodded. "I never trusted Victoria. But Sebastian insisted on keeping her around for Grandmother’s sake."

Christopher’s expression darkened. "At least now the mastermind won’t escape justice."

Julian agreed. "Once Sebastian arrives, he’ll deal with Victoria directly. She can’t stay here."

When Evelyn returned to Nord City, they’d have to protect her carefully.

Meanwhile, in the library, Evelyn sneezed sharply.

Rubbing her nose, she muttered, "Who’s talking about me?"

As she stepped out to refill her water bottle, she noticed her classmates staring. The moment she turned, they looked away.

Weird.

Her phone buzzed—Sophia.

"Evelyn, are you still on campus?"

"Yeah, in the library."

"Check what I just sent you. Someone’s trying to ruin you."

Evelyn opened the link. The university forum’s headline blared:

"Evelyn Carter: Genius or Gold Digger?"

The post featured a photo of Nathaniel outside the library last night—his tall frame striking, while Evelyn, half-hidden behind others, looked washed out and older.

The tactic felt familiar.

But who was behind it this time?

The scandal had exploded after an anonymous tip reached the student council. The university locked the forum, but the damage was done.

Whispers spread: Evelyn had secured scholarships through connections, relied on men to design the university hall, and—despite her leave of absence—somehow graduated early.

Coincidentally, today was the scholarship announcement.

Evelyn’s name was listed.

But as she approached the board, a group of students surrounded her, their expressions hostile.

"Evelyn," one snapped, "you’ve got some explaining to do."
###Chapter 473

Evelyn studied the restless crowd of students with sharp eyes.

"Someone is intentionally circulating lies to tarnish my name," she declared firmly.

A scoff came from the group. "Don't bother explaining. We've seen this pattern before - always with some powerful man backing you up."

"These honorary credits are crucial for our graduation," another student snapped. "Since you clearly have other avenues, why compete with those of us who actually need them?"

Just then, Danielle pushed through the gathering. "What's happening here? These accusations are completely unfounded! Someone's clearly jealous of Evelyn's accomplishments."

"Accomplishments?" A male student sneered. "We all know what kind of 'talents' she possesses. The kind that involves batting her eyelashes at wealthy men."

The murmurs of agreement spread through the crowd like wildfire.

Evelyn felt warmth spread through her chest at Danielle's unexpected defense. Turning to address the hostile faces, she suggested coolly, "Shall we involve campus security? A proper investigation might reveal who's behind these rumors."

Danielle's face paled at the mention of authorities. "Actually," she interjected quickly, "wouldn't it be better to take this directly to Dean Winslow?"

"Yes! Let Dean Winslow handle this!" several voices chimed in.

Evelyn had no reservations about facing Theodore Winslow - she had nothing to hide.

Danielle, however, couldn't suppress the nervous flutter in her stomach. The dean had resources to trace anonymous complaints, though she reassured herself that her burner email account would protect her identity.

The group marched toward the administration building, their footsteps echoing through the marble corridors.

When Theodore heard about the online allegations, his teacup nearly slipped from his grasp.

"Preposterous!" he exclaimed, adjusting his glasses. "Evelyn, rest assured we'll get to the bottom of this nonsense."

Evelyn simply nodded. "I appreciate that, Dean."

Danielle watched the exchange with barely concealed envy. "See, Evelyn? I told you the administration would support you."

This provoked immediate backlash from the other students.

"Dean Winslow, isn't this favoritism?" a bold girl challenged. "Just because she's connected to Nathaniel Whitmore?"

"Total injustice!" another cried.

Theodore rubbed his temples as the accusations flew. "Then what would you consider a fair resolution?"

"Revoke her scholarship!"

"Delay her graduation! If any of us took such a long leave of absence, we'd never catch up. Why does she get special treatment?"

Evelyn's voice cut through the chaos. "I'll voluntarily surrender the scholarship. But my credits meet all graduation requirements - that's simple academic policy."

"Policy for who?" someone jeered. "Regular students or sugar babies dating billionaires?"

Danielle bit her lip to hide her satisfaction. Finally, Evelyn was getting her comeuppance.

Evelyn's eyes flashed. "Who claims I've had inappropriate relationships?"

"The whole campus knows about you and Nathaniel Whitmore!" a voice shot back.

"Don't insult our intelligence by calling it friendship," another student sneered. "A college girl and a married CEO? Please. We all know the arrangement."

The air grew thick with tension as Evelyn squared her shoulders, ready to dismantle their accusations one by one.
###Chapter 474

Evelyn stood with her arms tightly folded, her gaze steady. "I must confess, my connection with Mr. Whitmore goes beyond mere friendship."

The room fell silent.

"Are you admitting to an inappropriate relationship with that tycoon?"

Theodore Winslow couldn't stay quiet any longer. "What inappropriate relationship? What kind of nonsense are you all being fed? Evelyn's relationship with Mr. Whitmore is genuine and honorable!"

The students scoffed. "Professor Winslow, Evelyn already admitted it. We don’t need your defense. What kind of relationship between a man and a woman could possibly be considered appropriate?"

"Marriage. Would that be legitimate enough for you?"

Nathaniel Whitmore’s deep, commanding voice cut through the tension as he stepped into the office doorway, his towering presence instantly dominating the room.

Dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, Nathaniel stood out starkly against the backdrop of curious onlookers.

A hush fell over the space as all eyes turned to him.

Evelyn’s breath hitched—she hadn’t expected him to show up.

Nathaniel approached her, his expression unreadable. "Are you being falsely accused?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "It’s just a misunderstanding."

Without hesitation, Nathaniel placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, pulling her close in a protective embrace.

Turning to the students, his voice was firm. "My wife values her privacy and prefers to keep a low profile on campus. Unfortunately, that has led to baseless rumors."

He paused, letting his words sink in. "Let me make this clear—Evelyn is my wife."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the room.

The students who had been interrogating Evelyn moments ago now looked pale, their earlier confidence shattered. Who could have guessed that quiet, unassuming Evelyn Carter was actually Mrs. Whitmore?

Danielle Spencer, standing nearby, felt her knees buckle.

Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined Evelyn was married to Nathaniel Whitmore. Had she just made an enemy of one of the most powerful men in the city?

And Victoria Sinclair had never mentioned this. Danielle couldn’t shake the feeling she’d been played.

Theodore stepped forward, his tone firm. "See? I told you it was a misunderstanding. Now, apologize to Evelyn."

The students exchanged nervous glances before stammering out their apologies. "Evelyn, we were misled by the forum posts. We didn’t know the truth. Please forgive us."

"Yeah, we had no idea you were Mrs. Whitmore. Your discretion is admirable. It’s that anonymous reporter’s fault—they deliberately deceived us."

Evelyn’s expression softened slightly.

"I accept your apology. But I’d like to keep my identity private for now. Please respect that."

"Of course! We won’t tell a soul."

Theodore gestured toward the door. "Good. You’re all dismissed."

Danielle tried to slip away unnoticed, but Nathaniel blocked her path.

She swallowed hard. "Evelyn, I—I suddenly don’t feel well. I need to use the restroom."

Evelyn frowned, confused.

Nathaniel leaned in, his voice low. "She’s the anonymous reporter."
###Chapter 475

Evelyn gasped. "That can't be true!"

How could Danielle have betrayed her like this?

When Danielle realized her actions had been exposed, she panicked. "Evelyn, I swear I didn't report you. I'm being framed!"

Evelyn studied Danielle's face, searching for truth. "Maybe there's been some mistake?"

"It must be a mistake!" Danielle insisted quickly.

Evelyn refused to believe her friend would anonymously report her. They'd never had any issues before - what possible motive could Danielle have?

Nathaniel's piercing gaze intensified. "Are you doubting my investigation?"

Evelyn stiffened. Pressing her lips together, she ventured, "Perhaps someone set Danielle up?"

Tears welled in Danielle's eyes. "Exactly! I would never do this to you, Evelyn."

Theodore stepped forward at Nathaniel's signal. "The evidence doesn't lie." He unlocked his phone with a grim expression. "Danielle, these screenshots trace the report directly to your IP address. Explain this."

Evelyn's stomach dropped as she saw the damning proof on Theodore's screen. She turned to Danielle, hurt flashing in her eyes. "Why would you do this?"

Danielle clutched Evelyn's hands desperately. "Those must be fake! I swear it wasn't me! Think about it - what reason would I have?"

Evelyn's mind reeled. She desperately wanted to believe her friend, yet Nathaniel had no reason to fabricate evidence against Danielle. Though she resented his methods, she couldn't deny his thoroughness.

Only one conclusion remained.

Evelyn squeezed Danielle's hand gently. "I believe you. Someone must have framed you."

"Yes! Exactly!" Danielle nodded frantically. "Someone's trying to destroy our friendship!"

"Then let's go to the authorities," Evelyn declared. "We'll get to the bottom of this together."

But when Evelyn tried to lead Danielle toward the door, her friend suddenly resisted.

"What's wrong?" Evelyn asked.

With a shuddering breath, Danielle collapsed to her knees. "I'm so sorry... It was me. My jealousy... it made me do this terrible thing."

Evelyn inhaled sharply. The confession hit like a physical blow. She stared down at her weeping friend. "I never wronged you. Was pure envy enough to make you betray me?"

"I was stupid," Danielle sobbed. "We both came from nothing, but I couldn't stand watching you rise above me - especially with men like Nathaniel noticing you. The jealousy ate me alive. Please forgive me. You're my only real friend here."

Evelyn withdrew her hand as if burned. "Now I understand why you have no other friends at university. No one trusts a snake."

Without another word, she strode from the office.

Nathaniel exchanged a meaningful look with Theodore. "You'll handle this?"

"Of course, Mr. Whitmore," Theodore nodded. "University discipline procedures will be followed precisely."

Wiping her tears, Danielle slowly rose. Despite everything, a strange calm settled over her. Victoria had promised protection, after all. That knowledge alone gave her strength.
###Chapter 476

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the office, she immediately called Danielle.

"Ms. Sinclair, there's a problem at the university. My anonymous report was exposed, and now everyone knows about Evelyn and Mr. Whitmore's marriage. Why wasn't I informed about this earlier?"

Victoria's grip on her phone tightened. Nathaniel had personally gone to the campus to publicly declare his relationship with Evelyn.

Her voice dripped with frustration. "How could you be so careless? Getting caught this quickly is unacceptable."

Worse yet, Nathaniel's public declaration had only strengthened Evelyn's position.

Danielle was proving to be even more incompetent than Penelope.

"Ms. Sinclair, what am I supposed to do now? The university will definitely take action against me. You promised you'd protect me, didn't you?"

Victoria scoffed. "Relax, it's not that serious. Just sit tight and wait for further instructions."

With that, she hung up and turned to Gregory. "When does Alexander arrive in Bern City?"

"His flight lands tomorrow."

"Arrange a meeting. I'll handle the pickup myself."

Gregory hesitated. "Should we warn Danielle first? We don’t want her slipping up."

Victoria smirked. "No need. She’s too self-absorbed to suspect anything. Remember how easily she volunteered to impersonate Evelyn when I mentioned needing a childhood friend?"

As long as Danielle played her part, Victoria’s position remained secure.

Meanwhile, Evelyn walked along a quiet path on campus, her thoughts in turmoil.

She had suspected Penelope or Victoria might be involved, but Danielle’s betrayal had blindsided her.

The realization stung.

Just then, two unfamiliar men appeared beside her. They didn’t look like students.

Spotting her alone, they smirked and approached.

"Hey, you look upset," one said.

"Yeah, why don’t you come with us? We’ll cheer you up," the other added.

Evelyn’s instincts screamed danger. She tried to leave, but they blocked her path.

"Let me go!" she demanded, raising her voice. "This is a university. If you don’t back off, security will be here in seconds!"

One of them laughed. "Feisty, aren’t you?" He reached out to grab her.

Suddenly, a deep voice cut through the air. "Touch her, and you’ll regret it."

Evelyn turned toward the voice. A tall figure emerged from the shadows, his sharp gaze unmistakable.

Nathaniel.

Her heart leaped. "Sweetheart!"

The men froze at the term of endearment. Causing trouble on campus was one thing, but tangling with someone’s husband?

They exchanged a glance and bolted.

Evelyn rushed into Nathaniel’s arms, trembling. "I was so scared."

Regret flooded her. If something had happened, her unborn babies could have been in danger.

Nathaniel held her close, his hand gently stroking her back. "I’ve got you."

Tears pricked her eyes. "Why did you follow me?"
###Chapter 477

Evelyn had nearly given up hope when Nathaniel appeared out of nowhere, stepping between her and the two strangers who had cornered her.

Her heart pounded wildly in her chest.

With a tight voice, Nathaniel admitted, "If something had happened to you, I wouldn’t have known how to face Grandmother."

Evelyn lowered her lashes, hiding the storm of emotions behind them.

She forced a small smile. "Thank you for stepping in."

"Well, I couldn’t just ignore being called ‘sweetheart’ like that," he muttered dryly.

Silence stretched between them.

As they walked out of the secluded grove, Evelyn spotted a security vehicle nearby.

Two men were being shoved inside—bruised, limping, their earlier arrogance completely shattered.

If not for their clothes, she might not have recognized them.

She glanced at Nathaniel. "They look terrible. Did you do this?"

His expression remained icy. "They deserved worse."

A small, satisfied warmth curled in Evelyn’s chest as she watched them struggle.

Who wouldn’t appreciate someone defending them like this?

Then, her phone buzzed.

Julian’s name flashed across the screen.

She hesitated, stealing another glance at Nathaniel.

His jaw tightened when he saw the caller ID. "Go ahead. Answer it."

Stepping away, she lifted the phone to her ear. "Hello?"

"Evelyn, are you still on campus? I just finished work. I can pick you up."

"It’s fine. I’m already in the car. I’ll head back myself."

"Alright. Don’t forget your prenatal check-up tomorrow. For the next one, we can schedule it in Nord City. No need to hide it there."

After confirming, she hung up, his words lingering in her mind.

Yes. She was leaving Bern City soon.

When she turned back, Nathaniel’s voice was firm. "Get in the car. I’ll drive you home."

She nodded after a pause.

But Nathaniel didn’t move. His gaze pinned her in place.

Once inside the car, he finally asked, "Why did you lie? You weren’t in a car. Why refuse Julian’s offer?"

"Because I needed to talk to you."

Her almond-shaped eyes met his, clear and unwavering.

Nathaniel’s breath caught. "So. Have you made your decision?"

"Yes."

His pulse spiked.

Given her past deceptions, he had assumed he knew what she’d choose.

Clearing his throat, he said, "I trust you’ll make the right choice."

Evelyn inhaled deeply. "I’ve decided to leave. I’m moving to Nord City."

Nathaniel’s fingers twitched. Disbelief flickered in his eyes.

The air in the car turned suffocating.

His voice was dangerously soft when he finally spoke. "What does Julian have that I don’t?"

Evelyn looked away, afraid he’d see the truth in her eyes.

Swallowing hard, she whispered, "I’m having the twins in Nord City. They deserve a stable home. I won’t let them grow up in a broken family."

She knew Nathaniel despised children.

And she would never tell him the twins were his.
###Chapter 478

The wind howled outside as Evelyn gripped the edge of her seat. Nathaniel's refusal to finalize their divorce clearly stemmed from Eleanor's influence. A bitter realization settled in her chest—he didn’t truly care about her.

Beatrice’s disdain for Evelyn was no secret. If she couldn’t stand Evelyn, how would she ever accept their unborn children?

The thought of raising them in such a toxic environment made Evelyn’s stomach twist.

Nathaniel adjusted his cufflinks, rolling down the window. The cold air rushed in, biting at his skin.

He hadn’t expected to lose.

Not like this.

Not to Julian.

Evelyn stole a glance at Nathaniel. The shifting shadows masked his expression, but the tension in his jaw was unmistakable.

He had always been the one to walk away first.

After a heavy silence, Nathaniel’s voice cut through the air like ice. "Since you’ve made your choice, you can explain it to Grandma yourself."

Evelyn swallowed hard. "I will."

Nathaniel ripped off his tie, frustration boiling over. "And how exactly do you plan to break it to her? If she falls ill because of this—if she’s hurt—I won’t forgive you. You know how much she loves you. Is this how you repay her?"

Tears pricked Evelyn’s eyes. "I’ll handle it."

"How?"

The easiest solution would be to keep Eleanor in the dark. To pretend nothing had changed.

Yet, for reasons even Evelyn couldn’t fully explain, she was still choosing Julian.

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable.

But his gaze flickered to her, sharp and assessing, before he looked away again.

The rest of the ride passed in suffocating silence. When the car finally stopped outside her apartment complex, Evelyn barely registered it.

She reached for the door handle.

"Evelyn."

She turned. "What?"

Nathaniel’s voice was low, dangerous. "I hope you won’t regret this."

Her hand instinctively cradled her stomach. For her babies, she would never regret it.

She met his gaze. "Once I explain everything to Eleanor… will you finally sign the papers?"

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "Of course. If it weren’t for her, do you think I’d still be here?"

"Right."

The words stung more than she expected.

She stepped out of the car without another word.

Behind her, Nathaniel kicked the back of Frederick’s seat. "Drive."

When Evelyn walked into the apartment, Julian, Christopher, and Andrew were already there. She forced a smile. "Didn’t expect to see you all today."

"Alexander arrives the day after tomorrow," Julian said. "We’ll all go back to Nord City together."

Evelyn nodded, turning to Margaret. "Don’t worry. We’ll take Benjamin with us."

Margaret hesitated. "I told my mother, Edna, where we’re staying. She hasn’t been well… she needs to see a doctor."

"She can stay here," Margaret offered. "It’s better than a hotel."

Evelyn bit her tongue. After everything Edna had done, she hoped Margaret wouldn’t be too lenient.

But knowing they might never return to Bern City, she let it go.

The next day, Julian accompanied Evelyn to her prenatal appointment.

When the ultrasound revealed the two tiny heartbeats, a fragile smile touched her lips.

As long as her children were safe, she could bear the misunderstandings.

After the appointment, Evelyn headed straight to the university library to study.

But as she turned a corner, she nearly collided with Sophia.

"Sophia? What are you doing here? Don’t you have work?"

Sophia grabbed her arm, her voice urgent. "We need to talk. You have to be careful—Danielle is planning something."
###Chapter 479

Evelyn paused for a brief moment. The truth had already been revealed to her the previous night—Danielle was the mastermind behind it all.

With a hint of sorrow in her voice, she confessed, "I know Danielle was the one who made the anonymous report."

Sophia nodded. "Then why am I even telling you this? It was actually one of our classmates who tipped me off."

"She saw Danielle getting cozy with a wealthy socialite and suddenly flaunting designer bags and high-end makeup in the dorm."

"A socialite?" Evelyn's brows furrowed.

Her thoughts immediately went to Victoria. She knew Danielle wouldn’t act without a motive.

Sophia pulled out her phone. "I even found photos for proof. It’s definitely her—Victoria Sinclair, the woman trying to steal your husband."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "Yes, that’s Victoria."

She recognized Victoria instantly in the images.

Yet, throughout this time, Evelyn hadn’t noticed anything amiss. Danielle had always played the role of a loyal friend in front of her.

"Sophia, thank you for telling me."

"Evelyn, you never know what schemes these rich people are plotting. Be careful."

"Once your exams are over, I suggest you leave Bern City immediately. That woman won’t be able to touch you once you’re gone."

Evelyn smiled warmly and hugged her friend. "I’m so lucky to have you watching my back. Once I’m settled in Nord City, you have to come visit."

Since Sophia had to return to work, their conversation was brief, and they soon parted ways.

Not long after, Theodore summoned Evelyn to his office to discuss the previous day’s incident. But Danielle was nowhere to be found.

Danielle’s advisor explained, "I haven’t been able to reach her. Apparently, she didn’t return to her dorm last night."

"Danielle has always been a bit of a loner, detached from reality. She often believes she’s being ostracized because she’s an orphan."

"In truth, everyone’s just busy with graduation season and doesn’t have time to pay her much attention."

Hearing this, Evelyn realized just how isolated Danielle truly was.

She couldn’t help but scold herself for letting her emotions cloud her judgment. Their shared background as orphans had made her sympathetic.

At first, she had believed Danielle’s claims of being mistreated. But now, it was clear Danielle had been manipulating her all along.

Glancing at the clock, Evelyn sighed. "Forget it. Let the university handle this matter. I need to get back to studying."

With Danielle being used as a pawn by Victoria, Evelyn felt no need to extend any further sympathy.

Meanwhile, Victoria waited eagerly at the airport for Nathaniel’s arrival. Today was crucial for her plans.

If she could successfully manipulate Danielle into discrediting Evelyn as the Montgomery heiress, everything would fall perfectly into place.

Soon, a group emerged from the VIP corridor.

Alexander and Olivia led the way, followed closely by Sebastian and Daniel, the latter disguised in a hat and mask.

Victoria greeted them with a practiced smile. "Alexander, Sebastian, Daniel."

Daniel scoffed. "Don’t address me like that. You were never officially part of our family. Now that we’ve found our real sister, maybe it’s time for you to start packing."

His harsh words made Victoria’s eyes flicker with suppressed anger.

"I’ve always known my place as a foster daughter. I never once thought of replacing the true Montgomery heiress."

"I’m grateful for everything you’ve given me, which is why I’ve spent years searching for her. Every lead I’ve found, I’ve brought to you immediately."

Daniel smirked. "Who’s to say you didn’t plant someone to deceive us?"

Victoria’s gaze darkened briefly before she turned to Alexander. "How could you even suggest something so vile? Alexander, you believe me, don’t you?"
###Chapter 480

Alexander maintained his composure as he studied Victoria's face. "Where is this so-called 'heiress' you claim to have found?"

"She's at my place. I can take you there immediately," Victoria answered with forced enthusiasm.

Yet beneath her eager tone, a flicker of unease crossed her features as she guided Alexander and the others through the airport terminal.

Soon, their group split up, each heading toward separate waiting vehicles.

Olivia shot Alexander a concerned glance. "I don't trust Victoria's intentions," she murmured.

"Whatever game she's playing, we'll discover the truth soon enough," Alexander stated firmly.

"It's unfortunate Evelyn lost most of her childhood memories. Otherwise she might recall how Victoria interfered with our search for her," Olivia added.

Alexander's jaw tightened. Bringing Victoria back from the orphanage remained his greatest regret.

Within minutes, they arrived at Victoria's luxurious penthouse.

Gregory rushed forward in panic. "Ms. Sinclair, Danielle has disappeared!"

Victoria's face drained of color. "What do you mean? Turn this place upside down!"

"We've searched everywhere. She's gone."

Victoria checked her phone and found a WhatsApp message from Danielle: "Ms. Sinclair, if you want my cooperation, fix my university expulsion first. I can't afford this stain on my record."

With trembling fingers, Victoria dialed Danielle's number repeatedly, but only got endless ringing.

As Alexander's group exited their vehicle, his voice cut through the tension. "Where is she?"

Victoria forced a smile. "Alexander, Danielle just needs time to process everything. I'll find her soon," she lied smoothly.

Alexander's patience snapped.

He tossed a document at Victoria. "This terminates our arrangement. Whether you sign or not, your citizenship transfers to Bern City effective immediately."

Victoria gasped, scrambling after him. "Alexander! Just because you found your real sister, you're throwing me away? I helped find her!"

Olivia blocked Victoria's path. "We'll handle the search from here," she stated with finality.

Watching Alexander's car disappear, Victoria turned to Gregory. "We must find Danielle first, or they'll learn everything about Evelyn!"

Victoria couldn't allow Evelyn to reclaim her rightful place in the Montgomery family.

That evening, Evelyn returned home to find all six brothers crowded in her modest living room.

The small space felt even more cramped with their imposing presence.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Your flight wasn't until tomorrow?"

Alexander smiled warmly. "Finished my work early. Wanted to surprise you."

Their original plan had been to confront Victoria that afternoon, but discovering her imposter missing made further pretense pointless.

Olivia took Evelyn's hand gently. "We heard about your graduation banquet. The whole family will be there to celebrate."

Daniel rested his chin on his hand with a playful grin. "Why didn't you tell us about this important event sooner?"

Evelyn's voice softened with emotion. "I thought you were all busy, and the flight from Nord City is so long..."

Still, what daughter wouldn't want her family present for such a milestone?

It reminded her of childhood dreams of parents attending school events.

Olivia squeezed Evelyn's hand. "This time, we're personally escorting you back to Nord City. We have a special gift planned for the banquet."

At the event, they would reveal Evelyn's true identity as the long-lost Montgomery heiress!
###Chapter 481

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with intrigue. "What kind of gift is this? Can't you give me just a little clue?"

Nathaniel shook his head firmly. "Telling you now would ruin everything. At minimum, before you depart Bern City, we want this chapter of your life to have the perfect ending," he explained.

The Montgomery brothers exchanged knowing glances.

Julian, Christopher, and Andrew's eyes gleamed with shared understanding. Alexander had already questioned Evelyn about her relationship with Nathaniel when he arrived earlier that day - some secrets could no longer stay hidden.

Julian had reluctantly disclosed Evelyn's secret three-year marriage to Nathaniel, but had kept her pregnancy confidential. As her doctor, he took his professional oath seriously.

After lengthy discussion, they'd unanimously decided to reveal Evelyn's true identity as the Montgomery heiress at the upcoming graduation banquet.

Alexander's voice carried steel resolve. "Evelyn, I swear we'll make right every injustice you've suffered." His hands clenched at the thought of Nathaniel's treatment of her.

Evelyn noticed her brothers' odd behavior but couldn't quite decipher its meaning.

As university graduation approached, rumors swirled about special guests attending the banquet and plans for a charity auction.

The next afternoon, Olivia took Evelyn shopping at Bern City's most exclusive boutique.

"Now that your brothers' businesses are flourishing, buy whatever your heart desires," Olivia insisted, pressing a black VIP card into Evelyn's palm. "With this, you'll never need appointments or waitlists here again."

Evelyn gratefully accepted the card, selecting an emerald gown from the rack. "Olivia, this would look divine on you. You must try it!"

Unable to resist, Olivia disappeared into the dressing room with the dress.

Meanwhile, Evelyn slipped into a sapphire cocktail dress, studying her reflection critically. While stunning, the fitted silhouette slightly accentuated her baby bump. These days, she preferred looser cuts.

"Well, well. Evelyn Carter in this store? Can trailer trash even afford the hangers here?" Penelope Whitmore's shrill voice cut through the air as she entered with Beatrice Harrington.

Beatrice's expression turned glacial. "This establishment is for ladies of breeding, Evelyn. Just as our family isn't for common gold-diggers." She sniffed disdainfully. "Even if you temporarily acquire nice things, they'll never truly be yours."

Evelyn crossed her arms defiantly. "Who says I can't afford it?" She handed the black card to the sales associate. "Please wrap this up."

Penelope's jaw dropped. "Is that...a VIP membership card? How did you get that? Did you steal it?"

Beatrice's face purpled with outrage. "She must have! Even I couldn't obtain that card!"

Penelope nodded vigorously. "Exactly! Aunt Beatrice, even you were denied this privilege!"

The barb struck home. Beatrice had coveted the exclusive card for years, but Eleanor Whitmore had vetoed the "extravagance." Yet here was Evelyn, casually wielding one!

Beatrice turned to the sales associate imperiously. "This pauper couldn't possibly own that card legally. You'd better verify her identity before getting implicated in fraud."

Evelyn hadn't realized the card's significance until now.

Penelope tittered maliciously. "Honestly Evelyn, do you even understand what you're holding? This requires annual spending over one million dollars and celebrity references for approval. People who carry this aren't just wealthy - they're elite. You've really stepped in it now!"
###Chapter 482

The boutique air crackled with tension as Chelsea Kent, the impeccably dressed store manager, glided toward Evelyn Carter and Beatrice Harrington. "Ms. Whitmore and Mrs. Whitmore, how may I assist you today?"

Penelope Whitmore's shrill voice cut through the perfumed air. "We've got a thief here! Shouldn't you verify stolen property?" Her manicured finger jabbed toward the VIP card in Evelyn's hand.

Chelsea's perfectly arched eyebrows lifted as she examined the platinum card. "Miss Carter, is this membership yours?"

Evelyn shook her head calmly. "It's not mine."

Penelope's triumphant cackle echoed off the marble floors. "See? She doesn't even know where she got it! Probably picked someone's pocket!"

Beatrice's lips curled into a cruel smirk. "Evelyn, darling, a street rat will always be a street rat. No amount of pretending can change that."

The fitting room door burst open with enough force to rattle the mirrors. Olivia Montgomery stormed out, her designer heels clicking like gunshots. "Who the hell do you think you're calling a street rat?"

Recognition flashed across Olivia's face as she took in Nathaniel Whitmore's mother and cousin. Years of suppressed rage bubbled to the surface. While Evelyn's brothers might play diplomat, Olivia had no such restraint.

She jabbed a finger at Beatrice's surgically-tightened face. "You wrinkled old bat! At your age, you should know better than to bully young women. Where'd your manners go - get botoxed out with your wrinkles?"

Beatrice's face turned an alarming shade of crimson. "How dare you! Do you know who I am?"

Olivia rolled up her sleeves. "I know exactly who you are - Nathaniel's nasty mother who made Evelyn's life hell. And I might just show you what happens to bullies."

Evelyn quickly stepped between them. "Olivia, please. We're in public." Her calm voice contrasted sharply with the electric tension.

Olivia snorted. "Public? These vipers don't deserve civilized treatment!"

Beatrice's diamond rings flashed as she gestured dismissively. "Oh look, the gutter rat found herself a matching friend. How... predictable."

Penelope seized the moment, snapping at Chelsea. "Call security! These thieves need to be arrested for fraud!"

Olivia burst into laughter. "Fraud? Over a shopping card? Did you time-travel here from the Victorian era?"

Chelsea hesitated, her gaze darting between the wealthy Whitmores and the unfamiliar but fierce Olivia. With a nervous gulp, she reached for the store phone. "I... I should contact the card's owner."

The moment Chelsea dialed, a phone erupted in ringing from the VIP lounge. Every head swiveled toward the sound.

Penelope gasped. "The owner's here?" The blood drained from her face as the implications sank in.
###Chapter 483

Evelyn Carter stepped back, her eyes widening in shock as she recognized the phone in question belonged to Olivia Montgomery.

So, Olivia was the VIP cardholder?

But according to Penelope Whitmore’s earlier explanation, obtaining such an exclusive membership required not just a million-dollar annual expenditure, but also proof of elite social standing. It wasn’t something just anyone could acquire.

Was Olivia’s family truly that wealthy?

Penelope smirked, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Evelyn, did you two steal someone’s card? Now that you’ve been caught, what’s your excuse going to be?"

Beatrice Harrington glanced at the buzzing phone on the sofa before turning to the sales associate. "Is the owner of this phone in the fitting room, perhaps?"

Just then, Olivia strolled over, casually picking up the phone with a flick of her wrist.

"Sorry, but this is mine," she said coolly.

Penelope’s face twisted in disbelief. "That’s impossible. Just because the real owner isn’t here doesn’t mean you can claim their belongings!"

Since when did Evelyn have connections to people like this?

Beatrice fixed the sales associate with a sharp glare. "Answer me. Where is the actual owner of this phone? Bring her out now! Someone’s trying to steal her VIP card and phone."

The sales associate, visibly flustered, stammered, "Ms. Harrington, this phone does belong to Ms. Montgomery. I verified their details when they entered the store."

Beatrice’s expression shifted instantly as she rushed to Olivia, holding out the VIP card with both hands.

"My deepest apologies for the misunderstanding. This was entirely our mistake, and we sincerely regret any inconvenience caused."

Evelyn could only stare, struggling to process the sudden turn of events.

Then Olivia extended the card toward her. "Evelyn, take it."

Evelyn hesitated, eyeing the gleaming card. "This is too valuable. I can’t accept it."

"It’s a gift. Just take it," Olivia insisted, her voice firm. "Especially with so many judgmental people around."

Beatrice’s face flushed with humiliation. "Who do you think you’re insulting?"

Seething with jealousy, Penelope couldn’t resist a snide remark. "What’s the point of taking the card? You still can’t afford anything here."

Olivia arched a brow. "Not a problem. This card has a seven-figure spending limit. Evelyn can use it however she likes."

Beatrice narrowed her eyes. "Who exactly are you? And why are you being so generous to Evelyn?"

Penelope sneered, fueling the fire. "Evelyn’s nothing but a gold-digging fraud. She schemed her way into marrying Nathaniel, and when she realized she wouldn’t get a dime, she started talking about divorce and chasing other men. Watch out—she might set her sights on your husband next."

Evelyn’s expression darkened. She hadn’t expected Penelope to publicly expose her three-year marriage to Nathaniel.

Her voice turned icy. "If I were truly a gold digger, I’d have taken control of the Whitmore Group by now, and all of you would’ve been kicked out of the family estate."

Beatrice scoffed. "Oh, Evelyn, I knew you’d say that. That’s exactly why I made you sign a prenup. If you and Nathaniel divorce, you won’t get a single cent!"

Evelyn smirked. "Seems you’re not up to date. Nathaniel tore up the prenup right in front of me."

"What? That’s impossible!" Beatrice paled. The prenup had been their only leverage against Evelyn.

Evelyn pressed on. "And let’s not forget—before Eleanor Whitmore’s surgery, she made Nathaniel sign an agreement ensuring that any child I bear inherits the Whitmore Group."

Penelope’s eyes darted to Evelyn’s stomach, realization dawning. She was pregnant.

Though she didn’t know why Evelyn had kept it hidden, Penelope couldn’t shake the feeling that Evelyn was playing a much deeper game.
###Chapter 484

Olivia Montgomery clenched her fists, biting back the words that threatened to spill about Evelyn Carter's pregnancy.

If Beatrice Harrington discovered Evelyn was carrying Nathaniel's child, it could shatter Olivia's carefully constructed future with the Whitmore dynasty.

Beatrice trembled with barely contained fury. "Evelyn, your true nature finally reveals itself. Let me be perfectly clear - with your common upbringing, you'll never be worthy of my Nathaniel."

"Precisely! The divide between your worlds is insurmountable!" Penelope Whitmore added venomously.

Olivia rose to Evelyn's defense with a derisive laugh. "You can't even produce a VIP card, yet you dare pretend to be elite? Your arrogance is astounding! Evelyn wouldn't give your family a second thought!"

Beatrice lifted her chin haughtily. "How amusing. My son happens to be CEO of Whitmore Enterprises!"

"Is that supposed to impress anyone? You can't even secure basic membership privileges!" Olivia turned to the boutique manager. "According to store policy, VIP members can request removal of disruptive guests, correct?"

The manager nodded. "That is correct, Ms. Montgomery."

"Excellent. Then please escort these two unpleasant women out immediately. Their presence is ruining my shopping experience."

Beatrice's face flushed crimson. "How dare you! My son owns half this mall! No one in Crestwood City treats me this way!"

Olivia's smile turned icy. "Then today will be your first lesson in humility. No card means no privileges. Time to leave."

The manager wrung her hands nervously. "Mrs. Whitmore, you know our policies. As a VIP member, Ms. Montgomery has every right..."

Humiliation burned through Beatrice as she glared at Evelyn. "Pathetic, using wealthy connections to elevate yourself."

Olivia stepped between them. "Are you blind? Evelyn is my sister!"

Penelope's mouth fell open. "Impossible! Evelyn's an orphan - everyone knows this!"

"Our family nanny's negligence caused Evelyn's disappearance years ago," Olivia explained coldly. "She endured your petty snobbery alone all this time. Frankly, I'm astonished at your audacity!"

Slamming her black titanium membership card on the counter, Olivia declared, "Let this be your warning. Evelyn is a Montgomery. Harass her again, and we'll bury you."

Beatrice stood frozen, struggling to process that the "orphan" she'd scorned was actually Montgomery royalty.

When security approached, Beatrice hissed, "This insignificant boutique means nothing! My son owns this entire complex!" She stormed out, pride in tatters.

Penelope followed, mind racing. "Could Evelyn's family truly be that powerful? Why haven't we heard of them before?"

Beatrice scoffed. "New money, undoubtedly. Probably mining or oil fortunes. But no upstart fortune compares to the Sinclair dynasty in Northridge!"

Indeed, the Whitmores of Crestwood and Sinclairs of Northridge dominated high society.

Penelope nodded eagerly. "When Nathaniel marries Victoria Sinclair, our family will be untouchable."

"Enough chatter," Beatrice snapped, pulling out her phone. "I'm calling Nathaniel immediately to have those women banned permanently."
###Chapter 485

The longer Beatrice Harrington thought about it, the more furious she became.

As the esteemed matriarch of the Whitmore family, she was accustomed to nothing less than reverence and deference in Bern City.

Never in her life had she suffered such humiliation!

If Eleanor Whitmore hadn’t deemed the VIP membership card too excessive and wasteful, Beatrice would have undoubtedly owned one herself.

Then she wouldn’t have had to endure this disgrace at the hands of Evelyn Carter today!

Penelope Whitmore nodded eagerly, her voice sharp with indignation. "Aunt Beatrice, you must make Nathaniel understand—this mall belongs to our family. It’s absolutely outrageous that some insignificant boutique dared to throw you out!"

"They clearly don’t know their place. Nathaniel should shut that store down immediately and expel them—along with Evelyn!"

Penelope seethed, finding Evelyn’s arrogance unbearable.

Beatrice shared the sentiment. How dare Evelyn, a mere servant once cast out by their family, behave so boldly toward her? Without hesitation, she dialed Nathaniel’s number.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel had just finished a meeting and answered, his tone calm. "Mother."

"Nathaniel, I need to speak with you about something infuriating!"

Beatrice’s voice trembled with barely suppressed rage, her words dripping with wounded pride.

Nathaniel’s response was cool. "Who in Bern City would dare cross you?"

In Bern City, Beatrice’s name commanded respect. People fell over themselves to please her.

"Who else but Evelyn would have the audacity?"

At the mention of Evelyn, Nathaniel’s interest sharpened. "Where did you see Evelyn?"

"At Centura Mall. Nathaniel, you’re a major shareholder there. Call the manager and have that store shut down immediately. They shouldn’t be allowed to operate another day."

Nathaniel’s brow lifted slightly. "Why?"

"It’s all because of Evelyn! She had the nerve to have the staff kick Penelope and me out—just because she had some VIP membership!"

Beatrice’s voice rose in outrage. "As the mother of the Whitmore Group’s CEO, I’ve never been treated this way before. Nathaniel, Evelyn’s arrogance is intolerable. You must correct this!"

Nathaniel frowned. "She has a VIP membership there? That’s not easily obtained."

Given Evelyn’s current circumstances, it was unlikely she could have secured one herself.

Unless it came from Julian Montgomery?

Beatrice scoffed. "Exactly! But Evelyn had some woman with her, claiming to be her sister—and it was that woman who provided the membership."

Her tone turned suspicious. "But Evelyn is supposed to be an orphan, isn’t she? Where did this wealthy, influential ‘sister’ come from?"

"Her sister?"

Nathaniel’s mind raced with questions. Had Evelyn truly found her family?

Yet she hadn’t mentioned a word of it to him.

After a pause, he asked carefully, "Mother, is there anything else you noticed?"

"I—I don’t know much else. But I suspect Evelyn’s so-called sister might be involved in something shady."

Beatrice’s voice dripped with disdain. "She doesn’t seem like the type to legitimately own such a card. Maybe she stole it or works as a servant in some wealthy household!"

Penelope hesitated before adding softly, "But the name and number on the card matched hers. It was verified."

After all, a stolen card wouldn’t have matching details.

Beatrice shot her a glare before snapping, "Nathaniel, I’ve told you everything. Call the mall manager now and have Evelyn removed! I refuse to tolerate this humiliation any longer."

Nathaniel was genuinely stunned by the revelation of Evelyn’s possible family ties.

Something wasn’t adding up.
###Chapter 486

To Nathaniel's astonishment, Evelyn's family turned out to be the legitimate holders of the platinum membership card.

According to Penelope, Evelyn's sister owned the exclusive card, completely ruling out any chance of it being misplaced or taken unlawfully.

Clearly, the Carter family possessed considerable wealth!

No wonder Evelyn carried herself with such newfound confidence. Finding her biological family must have been an extraordinary occasion. Yet why would she choose to conceal this? Eleanor would surely rejoice at the news.

"Nathaniel, are you even listening? I'm telling you to have Evelyn removed from the premises immediately!"

Nathaniel felt a pang of exclusion, realizing he'd been deliberately kept unaware of Evelyn's family background.

Massaging his temples, he countered, "Mother, everyone knows the established policies regarding our premium membership privileges."

"When you cleared the mall last month, did you ever consider the silver-tier members?"

Beatrice faltered momentarily. "That's not a valid comparison, Nathaniel."

"Why shouldn't it be? The Whitmore Group's investment comes with strict operational guidelines. If we start bending rules arbitrarily, what credibility would remain?"

"If today's incident becomes public knowledge, it could severely damage the mall's reputation. Do you grasp the potential consequences?"

"But we're discussing Evelyn here! How can you treat her like some random shopper?" Beatrice snapped back.

Nathaniel's voice turned steely. "She possesses a platinum card, which automatically grants her VIP privileges!"

Beatrice's temper flared instantly. "Nathaniel! That wretched girl humiliated us, yet you're defending her because of some corporate policy!"

"Mother, it appears you're seeking retribution because you were denied access as a standard member. Now you expect me to abuse my position for personal vengeance."

"As CEO of Whitmore Group, I cannot authorize such actions. If I were to—"

"You're my son! Is supporting your own mother truly so difficult?"

Nathaniel replied coolly, "I can mediate this situation, but you'll need to justify your actions to the board yourself."

The line went dead as Beatrice slammed down her receiver.

Penelope inquired cautiously, "What happened? Did Nathaniel agree?"

"Agree? That boy's completely bewitched by that Carter girl!"

Though furious, Beatrice hesitated to involve Nathaniel further. Facing the board's inevitable censure would tarnish her standing irreparably!

Stamping her designer heels, she commanded, "Let's leave."

Penelope had no choice but to comply, though she secretly coveted a platinum card herself. Imagine having first access to all the exclusive collections!

Meanwhile, Nathaniel stared pensively at his darkened phone screen.

Recalling Beatrice's outburst, he found himself scrolling through Evelyn's Instagram. Her latest post caught his eye: "Graduation calls for a complete wardrobe refresh!"

The accompanying selfie showcased her in a stylish new ensemble, her heart-shaped face glowing under the boutique lighting, wispy tendrils framing her delicate features.

Nathaniel studied the photo momentarily before opening their direct messages.

At the luxury boutique, Evelyn reclined on the plush sofa, examining the platinum card. "Olivia, what exactly makes this membership so special?"

Initially, she'd assumed it was merely an upgraded shopping pass. But after Penelope's dramatic reaction, she realized its true significance.

Apparently, this small piece of metal could command security to remove even Beatrice Harrington from the premises!

Olivia hesitated, uncertain whether she should disclose the full extent of the card's privileges to Evelyn just yet.
###Chapter 487

Evelyn stared at Olivia. The entire situation felt surreal, especially when Olivia casually flashed her exclusive platinum membership card to put the other party in their place.

Olivia was absolutely breathtaking.

She cleared her throat with a dry chuckle. "Your brothers' ventures are thriving spectacularly. The companies meant to go public have already done so. I invested my wedding gift funds into their startups—shouldn't I be reaping the returns now?"

"Is their success really this overwhelming?" Something nagged at Evelyn, but she couldn't pinpoint what.

Olivia hesitated briefly. Just as she was about to speak, Evelyn's phone buzzed.

A text from Nathaniel. Finished shopping?

Her stomach twisted. Beatrice must have tattled to that insufferable man.

"Evelyn, who's messaging you?" Olivia inquired.

"Just a friend," Evelyn replied hastily, slipping her phone away.

The boutique manager approached with a polished smile. "This handbag is from our latest limited collection. It pairs perfectly with your dress. Would you like to see it?"

Olivia's gaze flicked over the bag. "Hmm, this leather is rare. Why wasn’t it presented earlier? Worried I couldn’t cover the cost?"

The manager stiffened. "Not at all. There’s a three-day holding policy before we can display this piece."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Then why show it now?"

"We’d like to compensate for the earlier misunderstanding… Mrs. Whitmore."

"Mrs. Whitmore?" Evelyn’s expression darkened. "Did Nathaniel order this?"

Realizing her blunder, the manager paled and pressed a hand to her mouth.

Olivia gripped Evelyn’s wrist. "We don’t need his charity. Tell Nathaniel Whitmore we buy our own luxuries. The Montgomery name carries its own weight."

Oddly, Olivia didn’t seem shocked. She hadn’t even flinched when the manager slipped up.

Evelyn studied her. "Olivia… you knew about Nathaniel and me?"

"Guess the cat’s out of the bag." Olivia waved the manager off before sighing. "Sweetheart, why hide it? Did you think we’d let the Whitmores intimidate us?"

Evelyn bit her lip. "We’re in Bern City now. That chapter’s closed—no need to drag you into it."

"That’s where you’re wrong." Olivia’s eyes flashed. "Nathaniel clearly hasn’t moved on. Gifting you a six-figure bag? Please."

Evelyn’s voice dropped. "His grandmother’s health is fragile. He’s stalling the divorce to spare her."

Olivia slammed her palm on the sofa. "That coward! Leave it to Andrew. We’ll drain every cent from him."

"I can handle this."

"Handle what?" Olivia cupped Evelyn’s face. "Three years of their cruelty, and you suffered alone. Not anymore. Alexander and I will storm Whitmore Estate and demand answers. That venomous Beatrice will regret crossing you."

Panic spiked through Evelyn. "No! I just want to walk away clean."

Olivia’s embrace tightened. "Then we’ll make sure you do—on your terms."

The unspoken truth hung between them: Nathaniel’s game was far from over.
###Chapter 488

"You're too forgiving, Evelyn. It hurts to see you like this. Don't worry. At the upcoming charity gala this weekend, we'll all have your back."

Olivia clenched her fists, remembering the auction that would take place during the event.

Since the Whitmores were hosting, she was determined to make them regret their actions.

How could she stand by when Nathaniel had already failed Evelyn so terribly?

Meanwhile, Evelyn mistook Olivia's silence for resignation and sighed in relief. "We've got everything we need. Let's head home."

"Alright. Benjamin, the car, please." Olivia had splurged on designer outfits as if they were mere trinkets, her nonchalance almost practiced.

That odd sensation prickled at Evelyn again.

But Olivia's spending wasn't an issue—not when Alexander and the others had fortunes to spare.

They returned laden with shopping bags. Margaret scolded them for their extravagance, yet couldn't resist trying on her new dress with glee.

Evelyn showered and settled into bed when her phone buzzed. A message glowed on the screen: Why refuse the clutch? It matched your gown perfectly.

Nathaniel Whitmore. Again.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard: Because I didn't want it.

The instant she hit send, his call came through.

She hesitated, then answered. "Yes?"

"Congratulations on reuniting with your family. Grandmother will be delighted to hear the news."

A beat of silence. "I'll tell her myself soon."

"Rumor has it they're wealthy. Who exactly are they?"

"From Nord City. Not obscenely rich, but they spoil me rotten. Money's never an object where I'm concerned."

"No wonder you were so indifferent during the divorce."

The memory of Beatrice's twisted smirk buoyed her. "Exactly. I've never needed your money."

Nathaniel's chest constricted. With every word, Evelyn felt further out of reach.

She smirked. "Oh? Did Mrs. Whitmore tattle on me?"

"Yes. She demanded I have you thrown out of the boutique."

"And yet, here we are."

"I'm a businessman, Evelyn. Rules are rules. VIP clients reserve the right to privacy."

Her laugh was brittle. "How very professional of you, Nathaniel Whitmore."

She ended the call.

He stared at his phone, an inexplicable weight crushing his ribs.

His gaze drifted to the skyline beyond his office window.

Once, he'd come home to her every night. Now, he couldn't recall the last time he'd stepped into their marital penthouse before midnight.

The place felt hollow without her. Like a museum of what he'd lost.

Frustrated, he dialed Gregory. "Any leads on Evelyn's family?"

"Nothing. Her records are airtight—like someone scrubbed them clean."

Nathaniel rubbed his temples. A thought struck him: Julian Montgomery also hailed from Nord City.

Ice crept into his voice. "No wonder the Montgomerys, especially Julian, are so close to her. It's familial."

"Wouldn't that make them ideal partners?" Gregory mused.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Shut your mouth."

"Sir, if you truly want her back, make her fall for you before the divorce finalizes. If that fails... well, there's always the nuclear option. Refuse to sign."

A pause.

The idea had merit.
###Chapter 489

The morning sun cast long shadows as Evelyn Carter stepped onto the campus grounds, an inexplicable sense of foreboding settling in her chest.

Her fingers tightened around her bag strap as intuition whispered warnings of impending trouble.

The cab ride to the university had been uneventful, yet her nerves remained taut. Elizabeth Hartwell approached with purposeful strides. "Evelyn, could you reach Danielle Spencer?"

"Danielle?" Evelyn's brows furrowed. "We haven't spoken since discovering she filed that anonymous complaint against me. What's happened?"

"The disciplinary committee uncovered multiple violations in her record." Elizabeth adjusted her glasses. "Between the damage from her false report and previous infractions - including posting private photos of her roommate online - the decision's been made to expel her. We need her signature on the paperwork, but she's vanished."

Expulsion? The severity of the punishment caught Evelyn off guard. She'd anticipated perhaps probation or academic penalties.

Elizabeth continued, voice firm, "The evidence against her is incontrovertible. This wasn't a decision made lightly."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, realizing how little she'd truly known about the girl she once considered a friend. "I haven't heard from her. Doubt she'd reach out to me now."

"Understood. We've notified campus security. If you hear anything, contact me immediately."

As Elizabeth departed, Evelyn turned toward the music building, her footsteps echoing in the empty corridor. The practice room door creaked as she pushed it open.

The grand piano stood silent, its polished surface reflecting fragmented memories of duets played with Danielle. Those moments now felt like scenes from someone else's life.

A derisive laugh shattered the quiet. "Still fantasizing about becoming a concert pianist? Dreaming of joining maestro Armstrong's ensemble?" Victoria Sinclair leaned against the doorframe, lips curled. "Someone of your mediocre talent could never measure up."

Evelyn's fingers hovered above the keys. "You speak as if you could."

"Because I choose not to." Victoria's eyes narrowed. "Do you honestly believe Victoria Sinclair couldn't if she wanted?"

Evelyn studied the girl before her, searching for traces of the childhood bully she barely remembered. Illness had stolen most memories from her orphanage days - save for a single children's song the matron had taught them.

Victoria alone knew the secret meaning behind that melody, knowledge she guarded fiercely. As long as that truth remained hidden, Evelyn would never reclaim her rightful place among the Montgomerys.

"Funny," Evelyn mused, "I recall hearing you auditioned for Armstrong last spring. Didn't he call your interpretation 'amateurish'?"

Victoria's cheeks flushed crimson. She'd meant to intimidate, not have her failures thrown back at her. "Even if true, you'll never surpass me. Private tutors since age five, masterclasses with world-renowned pianists - you're just a hobbyist with delusions of grandeur."

Evelyn's laughter rang clear. "If I'm such an amateur, why do I frighten you so?"

That familiar, infuriating smile transported Victoria back to their childhood - to days when the orphanage matron praised Evelyn's natural talent, predicting greatness while Victoria struggled through scales.

The old jealousy burned fresh as she stormed away, the piano's first haunting notes chasing her down the hall.
###Chapter 490

The seed of envy had been festering in Victoria Sinclair's heart for years. She'd spent countless hours perfecting her piano technique, desperate to erase the childhood humiliation she'd endured.

Now that Evelyn Carter stood before her again, the bitter jealousy surged uncontrollably.

"What are you doing here? Where's Danielle?" Victoria demanded, abruptly changing the subject.

"That's my question to you." Evelyn's lips curled into a knowing smirk. "You put her up to filing that anonymous report about me, didn't you?"

A dark shadow crossed Victoria's face. "I have no idea what you're talking about. Danielle's your friend. If she reported you, maybe you should examine your own behavior."

Without warning, Evelyn grabbed a fistful of Victoria's perfectly styled hair and dragged her out of the classroom.

"Evelyn Carter! Have you lost your mind?" Victoria shrieked, her voice cracking with pain and outrage.

Yanking Victoria's head back, Evelyn looked down at her with icy contempt. "Tell me, when a complete stranger assaults you out of nowhere, doesn't that make you reconsider how insufferable you must be?"

The searing pain in her scalp made Victoria's eyes water, but she was powerless against Evelyn's grip. "You'll regret this, Evelyn Carter!" she spat through clenched teeth.

"Death threats? How original." Evelyn's laugh was cold. "Everyone dies eventually."

"My brothers are coming to Bern City! When they find out what you've done-"

"Pity there aren't any security cameras in this hallway." Evelyn clicked her tongue mockingly. "No evidence, no crime."

Evelyn remained unfazed, recalling the legal loopholes Nathaniel Whitmore had taught her. He'd been determined to arm her with every possible defense against bullying.

"I'll hire the best lawyers! You'll rot in prison!" Victoria screamed, her face contorted with rage.

"Looking forward to it." Evelyn shoved her away, then meticulously wiped her hands with a tissue. "Next time you spread lies about me, I'll scalp you like a trophy."

Victoria trembled with fury, pointing a shaking finger. "Don't you dare walk away from me!"

Evelyn turned on her heel without another word.

Victoria started to chase after her, but the sharp pain from her ravaged scalp stopped her in her tracks. She pulled out her phone with shaking hands. "Reginald! Bring me a hat immediately!"

Humiliated beyond measure, Victoria kicked the nearby piano with all her strength. She'd come looking for Danielle with a proposition - to pose as the orphanage girl from Evelyn's past.

But Danielle had vanished when she needed her most.

And now this public humiliation at Evelyn's hands.

If Evelyn ever reunited with the Montgomerys... Victoria couldn't bear to imagine the consequences.

This couldn't be allowed to happen.

Reginald arrived moments later with a wide-brimmed hat. "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Winslow insists Danielle must be expelled."

"Does he no longer respect my family? Did you mention our donation?"

"I did, but he won't budge."

Victoria felt her blood pressure spike. Without Danielle's cooperation, her plans would collapse.

"There is news," Reginald added cautiously. "The university is hosting a graduation gala this weekend. The Montgomery family will attend. I understand they're funding a new exhibition hall for the Design School."

"Why wasn't I informed?" Victoria's voice was dangerously quiet.
###Chapter 491

A cold dread coiled around Victoria's heart the moment she heard the news. Something significant was unfolding behind her back.

She turned sharply to Gregory. "Why would Alexander and his brothers suddenly propose building an exhibition hall for the Design School? That must cost a fortune!"

"The initial investment is rumored to be one million dors."

"One million?" Her fingers dug into the brim of her hat. "What's their real motive?"

"Unclear at present. But I suspect it's connected to the Fleur International Design Competition. The Montgomery Group has always valued design talent. With their new Bern City subsidiary, this could be strategic positioning. They're scouting for fresh talent."

Victoria chewed her lip. Gregory's reasoning held water.

Alexander's Bern City expansion was recent. And hadn't he funded similar projects at Nord City universities?

Annoyance flared as she adjusted her hat, wincing when the movement pulled at her healing scalp. "That wretched Evelyn Carter will pay for this. Double our efforts to locate Danielle!"

Finding Danielle Spencer was crucial. The girl could become a useful pawn against Alexander, buying precious time.

"Already handled, Ms. Sinclair. We've contacted the boutique staff to inform her of a 'prize win.' Someone as materialistic as Danielle won't resist. The moment she appears at the mall, we'll intercept her."

A smirk twisted Victoria's lips. "Excellent. She'll take the bait. Now connect me with that store manager. I need that limited-edition gown and the exotic leather clutch. Delivery timeline? They're for the graduation gala."

Gregory hesitated. "The dress was purchased yesterday by another client. The bag remains available."

"By whom?"

"A VIP member, reportedly."

How irritating.

Victoria mentally kicked herself for not borrowing Olivia's VIP card earlier. Not that the haughty woman would've obliged.

Her nails bit into her palms. "Who does that social climber think she is? I'm a Sinclair by blood! She's just some outsider Alexander married!"

Defeated, she snapped, "Get the bag then."

"Ms. Sinclair, your credit limit was reduced to ten thousand dors after your... disagreement with Mr. Montgomery upon returning from Paris. The clutch costs sixty thousand."

"I have cash reserves."

"Those funds are tied to Penelope's credit line. And frankly, she spends rather... enthusiastically."

Victoria's frown deepened. Since when had she become cash-strapped?

Gregory ventured carefully, "Perhaps reconsider Mr. Montgomery's settlement offer? The properties, shares, and liquid assets—"

"Signing means severing all Sinclair ties permanently. Only an idiot would accept." She exhaled sharply through her nose. Reality was a bitter pill. "Freeze Penelope's cards. That parasite contributes nothing. She doesn't deserve my resources."

"Understood."

"And investigate that dress buyer. Find me a high-quality replica of the clutch—something indistinguishable from the original. At a college event, who could possibly authenticate luxury items? Even fakes would pass."

He nodded. "Quite right. As a Sinclair, no one would dare question your accessories' authenticity."

Her lips curled. "Evelyn will attend that gala. Perfect opportunity to expose her inadequacies. With Alexander present, I'll make sure he sees exactly how unworthy she is."

The fantasy sent adrenaline coursing through her veins.

She could hardly wait for Saturday's reckoning.
###Chapter 492

Leaving the Music Academy, Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly with lingering adrenaline.

Yanking Victoria's perfect blonde hair had been purely instinctual.

No matter how she rationalized it, the action remained undeniably reckless.

Yet she couldn't suppress the dark satisfaction curling in her chest. That arrogant smirk Victoria always wore had finally been wiped away.

After reviewing her notes at the university library, she checked her watch and hailed a taxi to the medical center.

Standing outside Eleanor's private suite, conflicting emotions twisted her stomach into knots.

Eleanor remained the sole reason Nathaniel refused to sign their divorce papers.

But no child deserved to grow up in a household devoid of love. The decision was final.

If Nathaniel never wanted children, she couldn't risk subjecting an innocent life to the same icy neglect she'd endured for three years.

Drawing a steadying breath, she pushed open the door. "Grandmother, I've come to see you. How are you feeling today?"

"Much improved, dear." Eleanor patted the bedside chair. "I've been taking evening walks in the courtyard. The doctors say I may be discharged next week."

The healthy flush on Eleanor's cheeks brought genuine relief.

Over lunch, Eleanor dabbed her lips with a napkin. "Once your finals conclude, you must focus on resting. After the baby comes, Nathaniel can arrange—"

"I need to confess something." Evelyn's gaze dropped to her untouched salad.

The air grew thick with tension.

Eleanor set down her fork. "The pregnancy, I presume?"

Evelyn's head snapped up.

Words failed her. Admitting the truth now would only compound her deception.

A heavy sigh filled the silence. "I'd so hoped...to hold my great-grandchild before..."

"Forgive me, Grandmother." Shame burned Evelyn's throat.

Eleanor clasped her hand. "Is there anything else you wish to tell me?"

Evelyn bit her lip. "I've...found my birth family."

"Truly?" Eleanor's face lit up. "That's wonderful news! I've worried about you being alone in this world. Are they treating you well?"

"My parents have passed, but I have three brothers now." Warmth seeped into her voice at the memory of their protective embraces. "They've welcomed me with open arms."

"Where do they reside?"

"Northridge City."

Eleanor's grip tightened imperceptibly. "So you've decided to return to Northridge."

Evelyn nodded. "But I'll visit often once I'm settled."

"My dear girl." Eleanor's smile turned wistful. "I'd hoped to keep you close. I've come to see you as my own. Pity Nathaniel couldn't appreciate his fortune. I wonder who'll eventually deserve you."

Evelyn's breath caught. "You knew?"

"Do you take me for a fool?" Eleanor chuckled. "I'd hoped the pretend pregnancy might kindle real affection between you. But with your family found and no child to bind you..."

Tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks despite her efforts.

Gently, Eleanor brushed them away. "When will you be signing the divorce papers?"

Evelyn shook her head in confusion.

"Not you, darling." Eleanor's gaze shifted to the doorway. "I was asking that foolish grandson of mine."
###Chapter 493

Evelyn's head snapped toward the doorway at the sound. Nathaniel stood there, his imposing figure casting a long shadow across the hospital floor.

Her breath caught in her throat. She hadn't anticipated his arrival.

Those fathomless dark eyes gave nothing away as he stepped inside, his tailored suit jacket slung over one shoulder. The crisp white shirt and navy tie suggested he'd come straight from the office.

Eleanor arched an eyebrow. "Well? Aren't you going to answer me?"

Evelyn dropped her gaze, unable to meet his piercing stare. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Hadn't this been their agreed-upon resolution?

"Evelyn. Outside. Now."

Before she could protest, his fingers closed around her wrist, pulling her into the corridor.

She stumbled to keep pace with his long strides. "Nathaniel, what's this about?"

He whirled around abruptly. "Did it ever occur to you that the truth might be too much for her to handle?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "She could have collapsed. She's still recovering!"

"But we agreed I would tell her!" Evelyn wrenched her arm free. "Why are you making this sound like some terrible mistake? Do you honestly believe deception is the answer?"

His lips thinned. "I didn't expect you to drop this bombshell while she's still hospitalized." A bitter laugh escaped him. "Or were you just worried our divorce wouldn't proceed quickly enough for your liking?"

The accusation stung. "Think whatever you want," she shot back, blinking rapidly. "I've done what needed to be done."

His gaze turned glacial. "How exactly did you explain the pregnancy?"

Her throat tightened. "I told her it was fabricated."

Nathaniel's mocking laugh echoed down the sterile hallway. "Evelyn Carter, does your conscience ever trouble you?"

She had no defense. Not when she couldn't reveal the real reason for ending her pregnancy. Hot tears pricked at her eyelids - anger at him, at herself, at this impossible situation.

"Pathetic," he murmured.

The dam broke. A single tear traced down her cheek just as Eleanor's cane tapped sharply against the linoleum.

"Nathaniel Whitmore! Is this how you speak to your wife?" The elderly woman stood framed in the doorway, her expression thunderous.

Evelyn's stomach dropped. How much had Eleanor heard?

Eleanor advanced toward them, leaning heavily on her cane. "Well? Answer me, young man!"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. "Grandmother, how much of that did you—"

"Enough to know my grandson has been treating his wife abominably!" Eleanor cut him off. "What other cruel things have you been saying?"

Evelyn grasped Eleanor's trembling hand. "Please, don't upset yourself—"

"How can I not be upset?" Eleanor's voice broke. "I thought we'd given you happiness, Evelyn. Instead, you've been suffering in silence."

"Let's go back inside," Evelyn urged gently, shooting Nathaniel a warning look. "We can discuss this properly."
###Chapter 494

Evelyn was trembling with such fury she could barely steady herself.

Following Eleanor's suggestion, she attempted to walk, but her legs gave out after only a few steps.

Nathaniel caught her instantly. "Careful, Grandmother."

"Don't pretend to care now," she snapped, shoving his hand away. "I never thought my own grandson could be so heartless."

Evelyn hadn't anticipated Eleanor's rage would be this intense. Swallowing her words, she silently guided Eleanor back into the room.

Once Eleanor was seated, Evelyn poured her a glass of warm water. "Here, Grandmother."

"This is all my fault, Evelyn. I never should have pressured you to stay. Three years is too long. If there's no love between you, then there's no point forcing this marriage. It's only wasting your youth." Eleanor sighed. "You've found your real family now. Divorce him and go start fresh."

Evelyn hesitated, unsure how to respond. Eleanor was being far kinder than she deserved.

She was actually encouraging the divorce.

Nathaniel stiffened, his gaze unconsciously trailing Evelyn's figure, lips pressed tight.

With Eleanor's blessing, what reason did Evelyn have left to stay?

His chest tightened.

He had assumed Eleanor would be the last person to agree to this.

Eleanor took the glass, her sharp eyes fixed on him. "Nathaniel, it's a weekday. Go to the courthouse and file the papers. I hear there's a mandatory cooling-off period now. The sooner you start, the sooner Evelyn can move on."

Evelyn bit her lip. "Actually, Grandmother, we already scheduled the divorce once. But then your surgery happened, and... we postponed it."

The moment the words left her mouth, she felt Nathaniel's piercing stare burn into her back.

She didn't turn around. With Eleanor's support, she had nothing left to fear.

Eleanor grasped her hand. "Oh, child. You delayed it for my sake, didn't you?"

Evelyn lowered her eyes. "Your health mattered more, Grandmother."

"I always knew you were too good for him." Eleanor sighed. "No more pretending. It's time to end this."

Guilt twisted in Evelyn's chest. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be. Those three years were stolen from you. Go home to your real family."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. Even now, he still didn't know who Evelyn's birth parents were.

Evelyn smiled softly. "I'll visit often. We can video call too."

"Of course." Eleanor patted her hand before turning to Nathaniel. "Now, about the assets—how will you divide them?"
###Chapter 495

Evelyn quickly interjected, "I don't want anything, Grandma."

"Evelyn, darling. People always secure financial compensation during divorces. How could you refuse? What do you think of our family?"

"Grandma, I married Nathaniel for love, not money. My family is well-off. I don't need anything. Please don't worry about it."

Nathaniel added, "Grandma, I offered her properties, but she declined."

Evelyn nodded in confirmation. "That's true."

Eleanor waved her hand decisively. "I'll handle this matter. I'll arrange a proper settlement. My legal team will prepare the documents immediately."

Evelyn knew Eleanor never went back on her word. The property agreement would be signed, whether she wanted it or not.

Still, Evelyn resisted. "There's no time. Nathaniel and I already planned to go straight to the courthouse. Please don't trouble yourself."

"Nonsense. I'll have the documents delivered there. You can finalize everything together."

Evelyn hadn't expected such stubbornness.

Realizing resistance was futile, she surrendered. "Very well. It's getting late. I should leave now."

"Go ahead. The courthouse remains open. I'll ensure the paperwork is ready promptly," Eleanor insisted, still focused on the divorce.

Evelyn nodded and exited. Outside, she noticed Nathaniel hadn't followed. She hesitated, uncertain whether to proceed alone.

Inside the room, Nathaniel studied his grandmother. "Aren't you angry?"

"Furious! I never realized how you treated her privately. I regret not demanding this divorce sooner."

Her words struck deep. "I thought you adored Evelyn. Why approve the divorce?"

Eleanor gave him a piercing look. "What are you implying?"

"I mean, my marriage matters little. If Evelyn makes you happy, you could make her stay."

"Nathaniel, do you think you're some prize? How could I be so selfish? She's young, reunited with her wealthy family. Even divorced, she'll find true love and build a proper family. Why remain with us?"

Her response stunned him.

The thought of Evelyn with another man ignited unexpected fury.

Eleanor, ever perceptive, noticed his reaction.

Her eyes narrowed. "Nathaniel... could it be you don't want this divorce?"

He averted his gaze. "Nonsense. I'm only considering your happiness."

"Don't shift blame. You'll make me the villain here. If you don't love Evelyn, end this marriage. Stop tormenting each other."
###Chapter 496

Nathaniel was seething. "Grandmother, why must it be about love? Marriage is nothing but a burden to me."

"Congratulations, then. You'll be single again today. Free from all that trouble," Eleanor shot back.

He clenched his jaw, rendered speechless. The words died in his throat as he stood there, frustration simmering beneath his composed exterior.

Eleanor exhaled softly. "You should leave now. The courthouse won't stay open forever."

With a stiff nod, he turned and strode out of the room.

Eleanor watched his retreating figure, a quiet sigh escaping her lips. Despite everything, she hadn’t been able to make Evelyn stay.

Victoria slipped into the room moments later. "Mrs. Whitmore, why didn’t you stop her? She respects you. If you had refused the divorce, she wouldn’t have gone through with it."

"Do you think I don’t know that?" Eleanor’s voice was weary. "But forcing them together won’t solve anything. Love can’t be coerced."

"But he isn’t completely indifferent toward her. They just need time."

A knowing smile curved Eleanor’s lips. "That’s exactly why I didn’t interfere. He needs a wake-up call. If he doesn’t fight for her now, he’ll lose her forever. People never realize what they have until it’s gone."

Victoria considered her words, nodding slowly. "What if they actually go through with the divorce?"

"Then they’ll remarry. It’s not unheard of these days." Eleanor’s tone was light, but her eyes held a glint of determination.

She reached for her phone, instructing her lawyer to draft the property settlement agreement immediately.

Sometimes, a fire needed fuel to burn brighter.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Nathaniel left the hospital together.

Her gaze remained fixed on the passing scenery outside the car window. Oddly enough, her emotions were eerily calm.

The hour-long drive was silent, the tension thick between them. Only when the car pulled up outside the courthouse did the stillness break.

Evelyn lifted her eyes to the imposing building. It felt like just yesterday she had stood here, full of naive hope.

So much had changed in a single month.

Nathaniel stepped beside her, his voice low. "Evelyn… are you sure about this?"

She turned to look at him. Even now, under the weight of everything, he was devastatingly handsome. The moment he stepped out of the car, heads had turned, whispers following in his wake.

"Why do you ask?" Her response was cool, measured.

Before he could answer, her phone rang.

Julian’s name flashed on the screen. She answered. "Hello?"

"Evelyn, I finished work early. I can pick you up from campus."

"I’m not at campus," she said quickly.

"Where are you, then?"

"At the courthouse with Nathaniel. We’re finalizing the divorce."

A beat of silence. Then, Julian’s voice brightened. "Alright. I’ll meet you there."

The call ended, and she met Nathaniel’s gaze. "Let’s go."

Something unreadable flickered in his eyes. "That was Julian, wasn’t it?"

"Yes. He’s picking me up afterward." She didn’t see the need to lie.

His expression darkened, and for a moment, she wondered—what had he been about to say before the call interrupted them?
###Chapter 497

Evelyn's gaze lingered on Nathaniel for a moment longer than necessary. Curiosity gnawed at her, and before she could stop herself, she blurted out, "Just now, you—"

"We're running out of time." He cut her off sharply, turning on his heel and striding toward the lobby before she could finish.

She watched his retreating figure, her lips curling into a bitter, self-deprecating smile.

What had she been expecting?

For Nathaniel to beg her to stay? For him to suddenly regret the divorce?

She needed to wake up. Eleanor, the only obstacle standing in their way, now knew the truth—and had even given her blessing.

There was nothing left to stop this from happening.

With a quiet exhale, she schooled her expression and followed him inside.

The divorce proceedings took barely ten minutes.

Now, clutched in her hands were two certificates—one that had once bound them together, and another that severed it all.

Three years of marriage, reduced to this.

How laughable.

But at least it was finally over.

She shoved the papers into her bag and glanced at Nathaniel. His strides were so brisk she couldn’t even catch a glimpse of his expression.

She trailed behind him, only for a suited man to intercept her. "Ms. Evelyn Carter? I’m the lawyer representing Mrs. Whitmore. This is the property settlement agreement. Please sign it."

She barely glanced at the document. "I don’t want it."

"Ms. Carter, if you refuse, I won’t be able to complete my task."

Reluctantly, she scrawled her signature and snatched the papers. "I’ll give them to Nathaniel myself. You can go."

The lawyer’s eyes flickered toward Nathaniel, whose stormy expression was impossible to miss. Wisely, the lawyer nodded and retreated.

Once he was gone, Evelyn hurried after Nathaniel, waving the agreement. "Wait!"

He stopped beside his sleek sports car—just as a stunning blonde approached him, phone in hand. "Hey, can I get your number? I think we’d hit it off."

"I just got divorced," he replied, voice icy.

The woman smirked. "Congratulations on being single again. How about dinner to celebrate?" She shot Evelyn a challenging look.

Evelyn froze, an uncomfortable heat creeping up her neck.

Right. This was Nathaniel Whitmore.

Wealthy, devastatingly handsome—irresistible to women.

Then, his gaze slid to Evelyn before he answered flatly, "I’ve given everything to my ex-wife. All I have left is debt. This car? Getting sold to pay it off."

The blonde’s smile faltered. "Uh… never mind."

Evelyn bit back a laugh as the woman scurried away. Bold, these days.

She met Nathaniel’s eyes and lifted the agreement. "I signed, but you don’t have to."

"I can afford it." His tone brooked no argument.

"It’s not about the money."

Before he could reply, a sharp honk cut through the air. She turned to see Julian’s car idling at the curb.
###Chapter 498

The ink dried on the divorce papers as Nathaniel signed without hesitation.

What was the point of prolonging this charade? Their marriage had been over long before today.

Julian stepped out of his sleek black sedan, his face lighting up when he saw her. Evelyn sprinted toward him, her sundress fluttering in the breeze. "Julian!"

"Finally free," he murmured, pulling her into a brief embrace. "No complications?"

"None." She held up the stamped certificate like a trophy. "This should make things easier for Alexander, right?"

"Absolutely. Thank God that bastard didn't try anything." Julian ruffled her hair affectionately. "Let's go home—no, wait. We're celebrating tonight. I know just the place."

From across the parking lot, Nathaniel watched them through narrowed eyes. The way she'd run to Julian—so eager, so relieved—made his chest tighten.

That radiant smile should have been his.

Now it never would be.

He yanked at his tie, suddenly suffocated by the crisp collar. His phone was in his hand before he realized it. "Gregory. Drinks. Now."

The divorce papers on his passenger seat mocked him.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's laughter echoed through an intimate bistro as their group toasted with sparkling cider.

Margaret frowned at the sudden celebration. "What's the occasion?"

Julian's grin turned wolfish. "Freedom. Plus, we won't be in this city much longer. Might as well enjoy it while we can."

"Damn right we're celebrating." Andrew clinked his glass against Evelyn's. "To new beginnings."

The mood lifted further when Alexander and Olivia arrived, completing their makeshift family dinner.

Later, in the quiet of her bedroom, Evelyn traced circles over her still-flat abdomen. "Soon, my loves," she whispered. "Soon you'll meet your real family."

Days later, cap and gown in hand, Evelyn fidgeted with her tassel.

Elizabeth had warned her about the "Outstanding Graduate" honor. Walking across that stage would mean facing hundreds of eyes—including certain invited entrepreneurs.

The auditorium buzzed with last-minute preparations. Her fingertips brushed a velvet drape she'd personally selected months ago for a music showcase. Now repurposed for graduation, her design choices still held the space together.

Satisfied with the setup, she headed backstage—only to collide with Victoria and Penelope near the VIP lounge.

That dress. Evelyn's breath hitched. She knew that designer label.

Victoria's lip curled. "See something you like?" She fluffed the couture skirts. "Not that you could ever afford it."
###Chapter 499

Evelyn burst into laughter. Victoria's sharp words rolled off her like water on a duck's back.

She strode toward the VIP lounge to double-check the floral arrangements.

Victoria's lips pursed in irritation at being dismissed. She turned to Penelope with narrowed eyes. "Don't you agree with me, Penelope?"

An uncomfortable expression flickered across Penelope's face. She cleared her throat awkwardly. "Ms. Sinclair, there's something you should know about Evelyn..."

"Well? Spit it out."

Penelope hesitated, then blurted, "Could you unfreeze my platinum card first? I'm in desperate need of funds."

Victoria's smile turned icy. "You're becoming quite the financial burden, cousin. Perhaps you should consider getting a job instead of leeching off family like some spoiled socialite."

Beneath her polished exterior, Victoria seethed. If not for Penelope's connection to the Whitmores, she wouldn't tolerate this gold-digging behavior.

Everything was part of her grand scheme to secure the Montgomery fortune.

But Penelope proved utterly useless - her only talent being reckless spending sprees.

With the Sinclair family tightening their purse strings, Victoria couldn't afford to indulge her anymore.

Penelope's cheeks flushed with anger. "How stingy! You're supposed to be my future sister-in-law!"

"Precisely why I'm teaching you financial responsibility," Victoria countered smoothly. "One doesn't mooch off distant relatives, does one?"

Penelope's eyes flashed. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"Consider this tough love, darling." Victoria's tone turned saccharine. "Now, about that secret concerning Evelyn?"

Penelope's expression shuttered. "Oh, I forgot."

No way would she reveal anything after that insulting lecture about money.

Victoria's phone buzzed with a text from her assistant. Her mood instantly brightened. "They've located Danielle. She fled the boutique but should be at the university."

She rose abruptly, smoothing her designer dress. "The gala begins shortly. My brothers will be arriving soon. Do try not to embarrass yourself tonight, Penelope."

Victoria swept out before Penelope could demand more funds, mentally dismissing whatever trivial gossip the girl might possess.

Meanwhile, Penelope stewed in resentment. "I was going to tell her Evelyn bought the same couture gown," she muttered. "But who cares about matching dresses? The real question is who'll look like a knockoff version."

A wicked smile curved her lips. "Now that Evelyn's reunited with her billionaire parents, she might even outshine the Sinclairs..."

The thought pleased her immensely. She went hunting for Evelyn.

"Psst! I've got juicy intel about Victoria," Penelope announced, blocking the doorway.

Evelyn didn't even glance up from adjusting a centerpiece. "Not interested. Move."

Penelope's face twisted in outrage. "You'll regret treating me this way, Evelyn Carter!" She planted herself firmly in the exit. "I've finally seen Victoria for the snake she is. You'd make a far better sister-in-law. Especially now that you're practically royalty yourself."
###Chapter 500

Evelyn's brows furrowed. "What exactly are you insinuating?"

Penelope smirked. "If you're so desperate to remain Mrs. Whitmore, fine. I'll back you up—but only under one condition."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Which is?"

Penelope's eyes gleamed with greed. "Simple. Tell Nathaniel to unblock my credit cards. And you’ll give me one of yours—with an unlimited limit."

The sheer audacity left Evelyn momentarily speechless. "Who in their right mind would dare make such a demand? I’m genuinely curious."

Penelope shrugged. "Being part of this family isn’t easy. I could’ve told Victoria about your pregnancy and your real parents, but I kept quiet—for you."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I thought you and Victoria were close. What changed?"

"Because she’s cheap!" Penelope scoffed. "She wants the Whitmore name without paying what she owes!"

Ah. So that was the reason for Penelope’s sudden betrayal.

Evelyn pretended to consider it. "Give me some time to think it over. I’ll get back to you."

Penelope grinned, triumphant. "Think carefully. With me on your side, you’re practically guaranteed to stay Mrs. Whitmore." She sauntered off, practically skipping.

Evelyn’s lips curled in derision. As if she’d ever agree.

It seemed Penelope hadn’t caught wind of the divorce. Not that it mattered.

Once the ceremony was over and her exams were done, Evelyn would leave Bern City for good.

By then, no one would believe a word Penelope said. Even if they did, Evelyn would be long gone—untouchable.

Her hand drifted to her stomach before she turned her attention to the remaining waiting rooms.

Just as she reached the last one, her phone buzzed. Olivia’s voice chirped through. "Evelyn! Why aren’t you wearing the dress I picked for you today?"

"I had errands. It wasn’t practical."

"That’s unacceptable. I’m bringing it over—with the stylist. Today’s important. You need to look flawless!"

Evelyn sighed. "Fine." No point arguing. Olivia would show up regardless.

Hanging up, she turned—and froze.

At the end of the hallway stood a familiar figure.

Evelyn approached cautiously. "Danielle…?"

The woman lurking in the shadows stepped forward, guilt written across her face. "Evelyn."

They hadn’t spoken since Danielle’s betrayal. The sting had faded with time, but the memory lingered. Evelyn had accepted it—some people couldn’t resist Victoria’s bribes.

Danielle clutched her hands. "Evelyn, I was wrong. Please, help me. Talk to the administration. Stop them from expelling me!"

Evelyn hesitated. "I don’t have that kind of influence."

Danielle’s expression darkened. "So you’re really going to ruin me?"

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "You made your choices, Danielle. Own them."

She walked away without another word.

Behind her, Danielle’s voice turned icy. "Don’t say I didn’t warn you."
