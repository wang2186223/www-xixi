###Chapter 1

Anna lay on the hospital bed, her small face as pale as paper.

"Mommy, it hurts..."

I knelt before Mia, begging her desperately, but she pushed my hand away.

"Don't touch me! That child isn't even mine!"

The red light in the operating room went out. The doctor removed his mask and shook his head.

I held Anna's cold body, my heart wrenching with pain.

Julian, Mia's first love, sent a text: "Thanks for the mansion. We're getting married soon."

I wiped away my tears and dialed a long-forgotten number.

"It's time to start the plan."

Suddenly, a billion dollars appeared in my bank account. A new message popped up on my phone.

"Welcome home, young master."
----

I am the husband of a billionaire CEO.

Yet I only receive a monthly allowance of two hundred dollars.

Even buying a cupcake for my daughter requires my wife's approval.

She always says she's afraid I'll turn our daughter into a materialistic girl.

But when her first love returned, she spent millions on a luxury estate.

That day, our daughter had a sudden heart attack and needed surgery.

I knelt in front of the corporate building, begging her to save our child.

She had security throw me out the door.

"Stop acting. You just want money, don't you?"

When the operating room doors opened again.

Our daughter had stopped breathing.

I held her gradually cooling body.

While my wife sent me a photo of her and her first love on a private jet.

"Taking her to the amusement park can wait until next month."

She didn't know.

There would be no next month.

Mia Winthrop pushed open the door, carrying the salty scent of the sea.

The wheels of her suitcase made a cheerful rhythm on the floor.

"Liam Evans, come help me with my shoulders."

She called out habitually, her voice still lazy from the trip.

I was kneeling on the living room floor, sorting through our daughter's belongings.

Each little piece of clothing folded neatly.

Just like how she loved cleanliness when she was alive.

Seeing I didn't respond, Mia walked over in her high heels.

"Why aren't you answering?"

She leaned down to look at what I was holding and suddenly laughed.

"Isn't this Anna's old clothes?"

"Why are you digging these out?"

Of course, she wouldn't remember.

Last week was our daughter's seventh birthday.

She had promised to buy her a new dress as a gift.

But ended up accompanying Julian Valentine to Iceland to see the Northern Lights.

I continued folding the strawberry-patterned pajamas in my hands.

The cuffs were already frayed.

It was our daughter's favorite.

Mia, not getting a response, sat down on the sofa by herself.

"Still mad?"

She shook her phone screen.

"Julian just sent a photo asking if you want to go diving with us."

In the photo, they were wearing matching diving suits.

Smiling at each other on a beach in the Maldives.

While the last photo of our daughter on my phone.

Was her lying in a hospital bed with a breathing tube.

Julian's voice drifted in from the doorway.

"Mia, my back is bothering me."

He leaned against the doorframe, his complexion perfectly pale.

Mia immediately stood up to support him.

"Is it your old injury acting up again?"

She turned to me with a frown.

"Liam, get Julian a glass of water."

I didn't move.

On the cup rack was the cartoon cup our daughter used for the last time.

She had been so thirsty but only dared to ask softly if she could have half a cup more.

Because Mia had said children who waste water would grow up ugly.

Julian walked to the kitchen and poured himself a glass of water.

The new watch on his wrist gleamed painfully under the light.

A limited edition Patek Philippe.

Mia had just had it brought over from Switzerland last week.

"Don't mind me, Liam."

He took a sip of water, smiling gently.

"Mia just cares too much about me."

Mia was rummaging through the first aid kit, not looking up as she replied.

"You took a knife for me back then. We can't take your back injury lightly."

She handed Julian a pain relief patch.

Her movements as natural as if she were the lady of the house.

While I was just an extra tenant.

When Julian took the patch, his fingertips brushed against the back of her hand.

"After all these years, you still remember."

Mia laughed.

"Of course I remember. You've always been the best to me."

She seemed to have completely forgotten.

Last year when I was hospitalized with a stomach hemorrhage from drinking for her.

She was in Paris with Julian choosing engagement rings.

Though it never happened in the end.

Because Julian said he still wanted to pursue freedom.

Mia finally noticed my continued silence.

She walked over and patted my shoulder.

"Stop looking so grim."

A notification sounded on her phone.

She transferred five hundred dollars to me.

"Take Anna out for a nice meal."

The transfer note read "Extra allowance for this month."

How generous.

The watch she bought for Julian could have supported me and our daughter for a hundred years.

Julian leaned over to look at the screen and chuckled.

"Mia is so generous with you."

"When I was your age, I couldn't spend five hundred dollars in a month."

Mia nodded in agreement.

"Being frugal builds good habits."

Suddenly, she seemed to remember something.

"Where's Anna? Upstairs doing homework?"

I looked into her eyes.

They reflected the light from the crystal chandelier, but no shadows.

"Mia, Anna..."

Before I could finish, Julian's groan interrupted.

He staggered, holding his back.

Mia immediately turned to support him.

"Is it hurting again?"

Julian nodded weakly.

"Maybe from sitting too long on the plane..."

Mia already had the car keys in hand.

"I'll take you to the hospital."

At the door, she turned back to look at me.

"We'll talk about Anna when I get back."

She paused, then added.

"I remember about taking her to Disney next week."

The sound of the door closing echoed in the empty living room.

I looked down and continued folding the strawberry pajamas.

The collar still carried the scent of the orange laundry detergent our daughter loved.

Faint.

Like her last hug.
###Chapter 2

I gathered my thoughts and headed straight to the company with the resignation letter I had written overnight.

Countless eyes turned towards me as I entered the office.

"Liam Evans actually dares to show up for work?"

"I heard he tried to get an advance on his salary from Mia Winthrop last week, but the finance department rejected him outright."

"His monthly salary probably can't even buy one of Mia's handbags."

The whispers of my colleagues reached my ears clearly.

I walked through the hallway with an expressionless face.

Throughout our marriage, Mia Winthrop never allowed me to make our relationship public. She even deliberately placed me in a low-level position.

I worked tirelessly, even drinking myself into the hospital to secure clients, just to make more sales.

I thought that one day I could stand proudly by her side and make our daughter proud of me.

But every time I submitted a promotion request, she would dismiss it casually.

I confronted her about it more than once.

She would always wrap her arms around mine and coo softly, "Liam, it's for your own good."

"Besides, I make enough money for this family. Don't you trust my abilities?"

Her words left me with no rebuttal, and I could only believe she had other plans.

Until the day Julian Valentine returned.

She booked the entire VIP section of the airport and welcomed him with a million-dollar fireworks display.

The next day, Julian was directly appointed as the company's Vice President.

At that moment, it all became clear to me.

The difference between love and indifference could be so stark.

If that was the case, there was no need to continue this marriage.

I swiftly completed the resignation process.

As I walked out of the company building, I surprisingly didn't feel the weight I expected.

Instead, it felt like a thousand-pound burden had been lifted.

For years, I had been like a bird with clipped wings, trapped in a gilded cage.

Now, I could finally breathe the air of freedom.

I visited the cemetery to see my daughter.

I gently placed the new doll and picture book in front of her gravestone.

I stayed and talked to her for a long time, until the night fell before I headed home.

When I opened the door, I was surprised to find Mia sitting in the living room.

"You finally decided to come back? Do you know what time it is?"

She sat on the couch with her arms crossed, her brows furrowed.

This was her usual expression when she was angry, and in the past, I would have immediately tried to soothe her.

But today, I just glanced at her indifferently.

Strangely, Julian was hospitalized, yet she wasn't there with him?

But that was no longer my concern.

I asked calmly, "Did you need something?"

Mia was visibly taken aback.

Ever since she returned from her trip, I had become a different person.

I no longer showed her concern, and even my gaze was distant.

She softened her tone and said, "Are you still upset about the trip with Julian?"

"How about I take you and our daughter next time, okay?"

Her words sounded like a compromise, but they were filled with condescension.

To her, my daughter and I were nothing more than accessories to be summoned and dismissed at will.

Mia suddenly seemed to remember something and looked around.

"By the way, where's our daughter? I don't see her."

"Did you send her to your mom's again?"

My heart sank completely.

She had been back for two days and only now thought to ask about our daughter?

What did this family even mean to her?

Before I could answer, the bathroom door suddenly opened.

Julian walked out wearing my bathrobe.
###Chapter 3

Liam Evans saw me standing at the door, his face showing no trace of panic.

He stood up calmly, gesturing for me to come in as if he were the master of the house.

"Liam, you're back? Come in and sit down."

My breath caught in my throat, the words I was about to say stuck there.

My gaze shifted to Mia Winthrop on the couch.

"Why is he here?"

Mia's eyes flickered, her voice tinged with guilt.

"Julian's back injury has flared up again. I brought him here to rest for a few days."

She paused, then added, "Don't overthink it."

Suddenly, it all made sense.

No wonder she came home on time tonight.

It was all for Julian.

Mia seemed to remember something, a look of relief crossing her face.

"Good thing we sent Anna to my mom's place earlier. Otherwise, there wouldn't be enough room."

My heart sank.

She hadn't even noticed that Anna was already gone.

Her mind was completely occupied with Julian.

Julian, seizing the moment, put on a remorseful expression.

"It's all my fault for intruding."

"Liam, I'll only be here for a few days. You don't mind, do you?"

His eyes gleamed with hidden triumph.

Mia quickly tried to smooth things over.

"Liam, don't worry. Julian will sleep on the couch. It won't affect us."

But I saw the flicker of concern in her eyes.

There was no way she would let Julian sleep on the couch.

If I hadn't come back unexpectedly, she would probably be nestled in his arms right now.

I spoke calmly.

"His back is bad. He shouldn't sleep on the couch."

"Let him have the master bedroom."

Julian's eyes lit up instantly.

"Liam, you're so considerate."

Mia visibly relaxed.

"I'm glad you see it that way. I was worried you'd be upset."

She thought I had finally learned to compromise.

But she didn't know I was already planning to leave this house.

While they were happily moving into the master bedroom, I quietly packed my bags.

Just as I was about to leave, Mia suddenly emerged from the bedroom.

"Where are you going so late?"

I looked at her calmly.

"Making room for you two."

Mia's face instantly darkened.

"Liam, what do you mean?"

"You agreed to let Julian have the master bedroom. Why are you throwing a tantrum now?"

"Can't you be considerate of a patient?"

She kept talking, but I found it all laughable.

In the past, I argued with her over Julian, and she called me petty.

Now that I was stepping back, she was the one who wasn't satisfied.

Julian pretended to wipe away tears.

"Maybe I should leave. I don't want to cause trouble between you two."

Mia immediately stepped in front of him.

"No one is making you leave today!"

She turned to me with a cold stare.

"If you have the guts, just leave!"

She always believed I would compromise.

But from the moment Anna left, my love for her had completely vanished.

I picked up my suitcase and walked out without looking back.

Mia stood frozen until the elevator doors closed, and only then did I hear her shout.

"If you leave, don't come back!"

She would never know that this time, I truly wasn't coming back.

In the hotel room, I slept deeply.

The next morning, my phone showed dozens of missed calls.

All from Mia.

The last call was half an hour ago.

Had she stayed up all night?

The woman who always urged me to be magnanimous—when had she become so petty?

When I pushed open the door to our home, Mia was sitting in the living room, looking haggard.

The moment she saw me, her eyes immediately welled up with tears.

"Just because Julian came to stay, you had to run away and even quit your job?"
###Chapter 4

I frowned, refusing to answer her question.

"How did you know I was here?"

Mia Winthrop's voice was hoarse.

"I checked your bank card transactions."

It suddenly dawned on me that shortly after our marriage, she had taken complete control of our finances. Every expense of mine and our daughter's was scrutinized, and all bank cards were under her name.

This card couldn't stay either.

What puzzled me was why she wasn't at home taking care of Julian Valentine. What was she doing here?

Mia suddenly softened her stance, reaching out to grab my hand with an uncharacteristic gentleness.

"I know you're still upset about last night."

"This morning, as soon as Julian felt a bit better, I sent him home. Don't worry, I made him sleep on the couch."

I was stunned.

She never used to explain herself. Whenever I argued about such matters, she would call me petty, saying my mind was so dirty that I saw filth everywhere.

Now that I stopped caring, she was the one chasing after me, babbling incessantly.

I pushed her away in annoyance. "Are you done? I have an interview to attend."

I had sent out numerous resumes recently, and several major companies had already extended invitations.

As I turned to leave, Mia grabbed my sleeve, tears streaming down her face.

"Liam Evans, do you have to be so harsh?"

"Julian and I grew up together. I just want him to have a better life. Is that wrong?"

"Besides, haven't I been good to you and our daughter?"

"All these years, haven't I paid for everything you needed?"

"How can you treat me like this after all I've done?"

Her self-righteousness was utterly ironic.

She only gave me and our daughter two hundred dollars a month, which wasn't even enough for food, let alone tuition and transportation.

To make sure our daughter didn't go hungry, I had to take on three part-time jobs after work. That's why I couldn't even scrape together the ten thousand dollars for her surgery, and I had to watch her die on the operating table.

Mia's eyes were filled with tears as she whispered, "Liam, stop this. Let's take our daughter home and live as a family, okay?"

Her pitiful act only made me laugh.

Why should I be at her beck and call like a dog?

Seeing my cold expression, she finally relented.

"Fine... I'll increase your and our daughter's allowance to five hundred dollars!"

"Our daughter has always wanted to go to the beach, right? Let's go today, okay?"

"Look, I even bought her the swimsuit she's been wanting."

She looked at me expectantly, as if she had bestowed some great favor that I couldn't possibly refuse.

I smirked coldly. "You want to take our daughter to the beach, huh?"

"Then come with me."

Mia, oblivious to what was about to happen, thought I had forgiven her. She followed me into the car, smiling and saying, "We're an old married couple. What's with the surprise?"

"Alright, I'll humor you and see what you've got."

But when I parked the car in front of our daughter's grave, Mia looked confused.

"Liam, aren't we going to your mom's to pick up our daughter?"

"Why did you bring me here?"

The next second, when she saw our daughter's photo on the tombstone—

The brand-new swimsuit in her hand fell to the ground with a thud.
###Chapter 5

"Whose... whose grave is this?"

Mia Winthrop stumbled backward, her high heels sinking into the mud. Her pupils dilated violently, her breathing becoming ragged.

I pointed expressionlessly at the photo on the tombstone.

"Our daughter."

"She lies here."

"Because you refused to pay for the surgery, she died on the operating table."

Each word was like a poisoned icicle, stabbing deep into her heart.

Mia's head snapped up, fury burning in her eyes.

"You're lying!"

"She was playing with her dolls when I left! How could she suddenly need surgery?"

"Liam Evans, just because I went on vacation with Julian, you're using this vicious lie to get back at me?"

She grabbed my collar, her nails digging into my skin.

"Give me my daughter! Don't use such despicable tactics!"

Slowly, I pulled two pieces of paper from my pocket.

The surgical record. The death certificate.

Black and white, with our daughter's name and time of death.

"If you don't believe me, call the Mayo Clinic right now."

Mia's hands trembled as she took out her phone. She misdialed three times.

When the call connected, her voice was shrill and distorted: "I need to check a patient's surgical record! The name is Anna Evans!"

In the silent cemetery, the voice from the receiver was crystal clear.

"You mean the six-year-old girl? It's truly tragic... it was supposed to be a routine procedure, but the payment delay..."

The doctor's sigh cut through the air like a blunt knife.

"If the payment had been made on time, she could have survived."

The phone slipped from Mia's fingers, clattering on the stone pavement.

She stood frozen, her face as pale as the cemetery statues.

"That day when you asked for ten thousand dollars... it was really to save her?"

I closed my eyes, my Adam's apple bobbing.

Suddenly, she lunged at me like a madwoman, her nails digging into my arm.

"This tombstone is fake, right? You're just trying to scare me, right!"

I pried her fingers off one by one.

"All these years, Anna and I just wanted a little bit of your love."

"Even when you only gave two hundred dollars for her allowance, she would smile and say 'Mom works hard.'"

"She was waiting for you to come back until her last breath."

"And you? You were on vacation with someone else."

I pointed sharply at the tombstone, my voice tearing.

"You killed her with your own hands!"

Mia staggered and fell to her knees, shaking her head desperately.

"No... I just wanted to teach her to be frugal, I didn't know it would come to this..."

She crawled toward me, trying to grab my legs, but I pushed her away violently.

"Let's get divorced."

Three words that severed all ties.

In the photo on the tombstone, our daughter's smile was forever frozen at six years old.
###Chapter 6

I never thought I would say these words.

But now, I spoke them with a calmness that even surprised myself.

Mia Winthrop froze in place.

Her pupils trembled slightly, as if she couldn't believe what she had just heard.

I looked at her dazed expression, my voice cold as ice.

"During your world tour, I thought a lot."

"We are not from the same world."

"That's why so many misfortunes happened."

"Now, it's time to end this mistake."

I just wanted to live a peaceful and stable life with my wife and daughter.

But Mia was obsessed with power and excitement.

We were like two parallel lines that intersected by mistake.

In the end, it led to an irreparable tragedy.

I thought she didn't have much feelings for me and our daughter.

I thought she would accept this ending calmly.

But unexpectedly, she suddenly rushed over and hugged me tightly.

"Liam, I know Anna's departure has caused you great pain."

"But please don't be impulsive. Can we talk this through?"

Before she could finish, her phone rang.

The caller ID showed Julian Valentine.

"Mia, I'm in trouble."

"Can you come over right now?"

A tearful voice came from the other end of the line.

I couldn't help but sneer.

"If you're busy, go ahead."

"I'll stay with Anna myself."

In the past, she would have left me without hesitation.

She would have rushed to Julian's side immediately.

I had gotten used to this treatment.

But this time, she did something unexpected.

She hung up the phone directly.

Her hands tightly grasped my sleeve.

"Liam, I won't go to him."

"I just want to be with you."

"I'm really sorry about Anna. I didn't mean for it to happen."

"I'll increase your allowance to ten thousand dollars a month."

"As long as you don't divorce me, I'll agree to any condition."

I stared at her in shock.

This was the first time she had chosen me over Julian.

But it was too late.

My heart had been shattered by her time and time again.

No matter how much I tried to piece it back together, it would never be the same.

I took out the divorce papers I had prepared from my bag.

"No need."

"I don't want your money or your things."

"I just hope you won't bother us after the divorce."

Mia suddenly snatched the papers and tore them into pieces.

"Who said I agreed to divorce?"

"I will never sign!"

Looking at her frantic state, I shook my head gently.

Then I turned and left.

I had already negotiated terms with a company.

In a few days, I would be going abroad as the project director.

I would take Anna and leave this city forever.

Even if she didn't sign.

This was the end for us.
###Chapter 7

Mia Winthrop pushed open the door to her home, her spirit utterly shattered.

The living room was eerily empty.

Suddenly, a realization struck her, and she rushed into the bedroom in a panic.

The shirts and suits that belonged to Liam Evans were all gone from the closet.

Stumbling, she ran to the children's room.

Anna Evans's toys and picture books had vanished without a trace.

It was as if the two of them had never existed in this house.

Mia's legs gave way, and she collapsed to the floor.

A cold wave of loneliness instantly engulfed her.

Her eyes stared blankly at the ceiling, her entire being like a puppet whose strings had been cut.

Knock, knock, knock—

The sound of knocking suddenly echoed through the house.

Mia's eyes lit up, and she scrambled to her feet, rushing to the door.

"Liam! I knew you'd come back—"

Her voice cut off abruptly.

Standing outside was Julian Valentine.

The joy on Mia's face vanished in an instant.

She turned away, her expression blank. "What are you doing here?"

Julian was taken aback by her sudden coldness.

He held up his hand, wounded. "Why did you hang up on me earlier?"

Mia rubbed her temples in frustration. "I was busy."

Julian showed her his injured finger. "I wanted to make you some pastries, but I cut myself…"

There was only a faint red mark on his fingertip.

Mia couldn't help but frown.

Was he really calling over such a minor injury?

Suddenly, she thought of Liam.

That time he had cut his finger so deeply it was almost to the bone, yet he had quietly bandaged it himself.

Mia absentmindedly pointed to the kitchen. "The first aid kit is in the left cabinet."

Julian's eyes widened in disbelief.

He reached out to grab her. "Mia, I called because I missed you."

A strong smell of smoke hit her.

Mia jerked her hand away. "Don't touch me! I'm married!"

Julian scoffed. "Married? Since when did you care about that?"

He stepped closer. "If you really cared, would you only give your husband two hundred dollars a month for his allowance?"

"Would you have taken me on a world tour when you knew your daughter needed surgery?"

"Now you're pretending to be the perfect wife and mother?"

Mia's face turned pale as she stepped back.

Her voice trembled. "You knew all along that Anna was really sick?"
###Chapter 8

Julian's silence spoke volumes.

Tears streamed down Mia's face uncontrollably.

Her voice trembled as she spoke. "You knew all along? Why didn't you tell me?"

"If you had warned me, Anna would still be alive!"

"My Anna..."

She broke down completely, consumed by grief.

Julian looked at her with a puzzled expression. "What are you talking about? I thought you and Liam were just having a child for fun. Did you actually take it seriously?"

"Besides, your daughter's death was your own doing. What does it have to do with me?"

Mia's face turned pale.

"What did you say?"

"Wasn't it you who said that daughters should be raised in poverty, or they would grow up to be materialistic?"

"You told me Liam was just a poor country boy who might have ulterior motives for getting close to me, so I should be cautious. That's why I strictly controlled his expenses."

"I trusted you!"

Julian let out a mocking laugh.

He leisurely lit a cigarette.

Exhaling a puff of smoke, he continued.

"Are you some mindless puppet? You believe everything I say?"

"I did mention raising her in poverty, but I never said to give her only two hundred dollars a month."

"Liam worked three jobs every day, and your daughter collected bottles to sell for money."

Lowering his voice with malice, he added, "Do you know what other kids called your daughter?"

"An unwanted rag, worthless, to be thrown away after use."

Mia felt as if she had been struck by lightning.

She had never heard about any of this.

She muttered to herself, "Why didn't you tell me?"

"Why didn't you say anything when you were struggling so much?"

But she had forgotten.

She had been told countless times.

Each time, she dismissed it as greed and refused outright.

Julian looked at her with a strange expression.

"Mia, what's wrong with you? Didn't you look down on Liam too?"

"He was just a country bumpkin. Good riddance."

"And that little brat's death is a relief, one less burden!"

He took a step closer, his smile suggestive. "Mia, let's not waste any more time. The night is young..."

Finally, Mia saw him for who he truly was.

The first love she had grown up with.

His heart was filthy and ugly.

Yet, Liam had always loved her, respected her, and put her first.

As Julian reached out his hand, Mia grabbed a pair of scissors from the table.

She screamed at the top of her lungs, "Get out! Get out of here!"
###Chapter 9

Julian Valentine was shocked by Mia Winthrop's frenzied appearance and stepped back repeatedly.

His face turned as pale as a sheet.

"Mia, have you lost your mind?"

"I'm not crazy!"

Mia screamed at the top of her lungs.

Her voice was piercing and shrill.

"It's all your fault! You always made me skimp on our daughter!"

"You kept hinting that I should distance myself from Liam!"

"You even encouraged me not to pay for her medical bills!"

"That's why she died on the operating table!"

"She was so young!"

"My daughter's death is all your fault!"

"Give me back my daughter!"

Mia grew more and more agitated as she spoke.

Her eyes were bloodshot.

Finally, she lunged at Julian in a frenzy.

Julian didn't have time to dodge.

The scissors instantly pierced half of his face.

Blood gushed out.

"Damn it, you're insane!"

"You're a lunatic!"

Julian cursed in pain.

But he was terrified by Mia's madness.

He didn't even care about the wound on his face.

He scrambled away in a panic.

Mia sat in a pool of blood.

Tears mixed with the blood as they streamed down her face.

She immediately called me.

But there was only a cold dial tone on the other end.

She sent me a message.

"I'm sorry, I really know I was wrong."

"Can we talk?"

The message failed to send.

The red exclamation mark stung her eyes.

Meanwhile, I was at my new company.

Discussing overseas assignments with my new boss.

She was a capable and strong woman.

Completely different from Mia.

Her eyes were gentle like water.

Every movement exuded mature charm.

She was delighted to see me.

She gently patted my shoulder.

"Great!"

"The company is expanding overseas."

"We need talented people like you!"

She looked at me with slight confusion.

"But from what I understand."

"You've been working as a regular employee in small companies for the past few years."

"Isn't that a waste of your talent?"

I smiled calmly.

And told her the truth.

"I used to work under my wife."

"But now I've come to my senses."

"I'm planning to get a divorce."

She was momentarily stunned.

Then she showed an understanding expression.

"Her loss."

"Work hard here."

"I'll make sure you're financially free within six months."

We had a pleasant conversation.

Just as we were about to have dinner together.

We saw Mia at the company entrance.

She looked utterly disheveled.

Her hair was a mess.

Her makeup was ruined from crying.

As soon as she saw me.

She ignored the onlookers.

And threw herself into my arms.

"Liam, I'm sorry!"

"I know I was wrong!"

"I shouldn't have been so narrow-minded!"

"I'll never limit your spending again!"

"You can spend as much as you want!"

"Just come home with me!"

"Please!"

I thought I had made myself clear.

But she was still clinging to me.

I coldly pushed her away.

And repeated slowly.

"I'm sorry."

"We're getting a divorce."

"I don't have feelings for you anymore."

"Please don't disturb my life."

My boss stepped in to mediate.

"Ma'am."

"I don't know what happened between you."

"But since Liam has made his stance clear."

"Perhaps it's best to leave some dignity for both parties."

Mia suddenly screamed hysterically.

"We're husband and wife!"

"Who are you to interfere?"

Seeing her unstable emotions.

I was worried she might hurt my boss.

I immediately stood in front of her.

And said coldly.

"Mia, we're separated."

"Watch your tone."

"Or I'll call the police!"

Mia stared at me in disbelief.

"You're scolding me for an outsider?"

"Is it because of this woman?"

"That you want to divorce me?"
###Chapter 10

Her scream pierced the air.

A crowd quickly gathered.

Countless eyes fell on me and my boss.

Whispers and pointing fingers filled the air.

A smug expression appeared on Mia Winthrop's face.

She raised her chin and glared at me.

"Liam Evans, if you don't come back with me, I'll ruin your reputation!"

Her voice was shrill and grating.

I simply smiled faintly.

"Mia Winthrop, you're always so childish."

"Where were you when Anna and I were starving?"

"Where were you when we couldn't afford her tuition?"

"Where were you when she was trembling in pain in the operating room?"

With each question, her face grew paler.

She staggered back two steps.

"That's not true... I love you both..."

I shook my head, cutting her off.

"You only love the thrill of controlling us."

"Now I'm taking Anna away from you forever."

I turned and walked away with my boss.

Behind me, I heard her collapse to the ground, sobbing.

At lunch, my phone buzzed with a trending notification.

The confrontation at the company entrance had gone viral.

The comments unanimously condemned Mia Winthrop's actions.

Soon after, Julian Valentine publicly reported her company for illegal activities.

The evidence of tax evasion was clear and complete.

The astronomical amount of the lawsuit shocked the industry.

The stock price of the listed company plummeted instantly.

My boss pushed his phone toward me.

"Any thoughts?"

I was silent for a moment.

"I just want to work hard and start a new life with Anna."

My boss smiled and handed me a document.

The gilded cover felt cool to the touch.

Opening it, I found it was a transfer agreement for an overseas cemetery plot.

A final resting place worth a million dollars.

I looked up in shock.

My boss's gaze was profound.

"This is a reward for a father."

"Don't let me down."

My fingers trembled as I traced the contract terms.

A flood of emotions caught in my throat.

All I could do was repay this trust with my work.

Two days later, I arrived at the airport holding a white jade urn.

The boarding announcement echoed softly.

Suddenly, Mia Winthrop burst out from the crowd.

She waved colorful cards frantically.

"Husband! I'll give you all my money!"

"Let's go home, okay?"

Her eyes were unfocused and fearful.

She kept looking around as if avoiding something.

I took a cautious step back.

Men in white coats appeared just in time to restrain her.

The attending physician apologized profusely.

"I'm so sorry, the patient escaped."

Mia Winthrop screamed hysterically in their grip.

"Liam! Don't leave me—"

Her final sob was cut off as the cabin door closed.

Above the clouds, I gently touched the cold jade urn.

"Anna, Daddy is taking you to see the world."
