###Chapter 1: The Final Straw

The notification chimed, sharp and cold.

Evelyn Sinclair glanced at her phone, her breath hitching as she read the message.

[Please report to the hospital immediately for blood donation.]

The sender? Hubby.

Ding!

Another alert. A bank transfer—1,000,000 dollars.

Her fingers trembled as she scrolled through their message history.

[Don’t forget the hospital.]
[Fund Transfer: $1,000,000]
[Go to the hospital now.]
[Fund Transfer: $1,000,000]
[Hospital. Immediately.]
[Fund Transfer: $1,000,000]

Three years of marriage. Three years of silence, except for these demands.

Nathan Blackwood, her husband, only spoke to her when he needed her blood—sold to Vanessa Holloway, the woman he truly loved.

This month alone, Evelyn had given blood four times. Her body ached, her vision blurred. Yesterday, she had waited outside his office in the pouring rain for over an hour, desperate for even a glance. Today, feverish and weak, she had stayed home.

He hadn’t noticed.

She coughed, her throat raw. Before she could reply, another message lit up her screen—this time from an unknown number.

[You may be Mrs. Blackwood, but you’re nothing but a placeholder. Nathan hasn’t looked at you once in three years. He spent last night in my bed. If I were you, I’d disappear. You’re the real homewrecker here.]

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

A homewrecker?

She had given up everything—her family, her pride—for this marriage. And yet, she was the villain?

A photo followed. Nathan, asleep, his sculpted features serene. Beside him, Vanessa Holloway, smirking against his shoulder.

The image shattered her.

Her phone rang—Margaret Blackwood, Nathan’s mother.

"Evelyn, have you forgotten what day it is? The maids are off. Get here and cook dinner."

Evelyn hung up without a word.

For three years, she had endured it all—the disdain at work, the cruelty at home. She had cooked, cleaned, and bled for a man who treated her like a stranger.

But no more.

Her fingers moved before her mind could stop them.

[Let’s get a divorce.]

Nathan called instantly. His voice was ice.

"Evelyn, stop this nonsense. Name your price. Vanessa’s condition is critical—"

She cut him off, her voice hoarse but steady.

"Nathan Blackwood. City Hall. One hour. Or watch her die."

She ended the call.

Ding.

[Fund Transfer: $1,000,000]

Evelyn laughed, tears streaming down her face.

How absurd.

How utterly, devastatingly ridiculous.
###Chapter 2: A Harsh Lesson

Evelyn Sinclair slipped her phone into her purse.

She swallowed the bitter ache in her chest and the fire coursing through her veins.

With trembling hands, she hailed a cab to City Hall.

Minutes ticked by like hours. Nathan Blackwood called twice. When she didn't answer, he gave up.

Evelyn sat on a marble bench, her complexion ghostly pale. An hour later, Nathan's polished Oxfords appeared in her line of sight.

His expression was unreadable. "What's your problem now? I know you've donated more blood this month, but you've been compensated."

"Let's get divorced." Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet his icy stare. Her voice came out hollow, devoid of emotion.

They'd never understood each other anyway.

She studied his sharp jawline and aristocratic features - the same ones that had made her foolish heart race three years ago. Not once had those lips curved into a smile for her.

Before, she'd tiptoed around his moods. Now, his perpetual scowl left her numb.

Nathan's frown deepened. He'd indulge her whims, but only with justification.

Did she really believe she was the only compatible donor?

"Evelyn, don't make decisions you'll regret."

"My only regret was marrying you." Her laugh was brittle as glass. The clarity of this moment was almost painful. "I'm done being your doormat."

The courthouse was nearly empty at this hour. Their three-year marriage ended in under ten minutes.

When the divorce papers touched her palm, Evelyn's fingers twitched.

Nathan didn't beg her to stay. Didn't even glance her way. "Let's go to the hospital." His voice was clinical. Still thinking of his final withdrawal from her veins.

Evelyn tilted her head back and laughed until it hurt. "Nathan Blackwood, if Vanessa Holloway bleeds out at my feet tomorrow, I wouldn't spare a single drop."

His eyes darkened dangerously. "How dare you wish death on someone who's suffering? Our marriage contract specified-"

"Right." The word sliced through his sentence. "Our beautiful arrangement. My rare Rh-null blood for the privilege of being Mrs. Blackwood." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "How could I forget?"

Nathan's expression remained impassive, but something flickered in his gaze.

Evelyn's laughter turned jagged. "I finally understand - to you, I'm just a walking blood bag." She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Well here's your last withdrawal. After this, we're square."

She turned on her heel before he could respond. Nathan's brows knitted together.

An unfamiliar irritation prickled under his skin. This wasn't the Evelyn he knew - the clingy girl who'd pursued him relentlessly, then transformed into the perfect docile wife.

Lately, Vanessa's transfusions had become more frequent. He'd felt guilty, but Evelyn never complained. He'd assumed she was content with the jewelry and designer handbags he lavished on her.

This sudden defiance was... unsettling.

But it didn't matter.

Nathan exhaled through his nose. She'd come crawling back when reality set in.

Before he could speak, Evelyn flagged another taxi. This one took her straight to Metropolitan General.

She marched into Vanessa Holloway's private suite without knocking.

A team of specialists hovered around the hospital bed. Vanessa's face lit up when she saw Evelyn.

"You came! I was worried you'd be upset with me for needing so much blood. I know how hard this must be on your body."

Evelyn strode forward, her eyes glacial.

"That text message. It was you, wasn't it?"

Vanessa's smile faltered. Before she could answer, Evelyn's palm connected with her cheek in a sharp crack.

The slap echoed through the sterile room. Vanessa's shocked gasp was almost comical.
###Chapter 3: Retaliation

Nathan's eyes darkened, his expression stormy as he barked, "Evelyn! What the hell are you doing?"

His voice was ice-cold.

He arrived fast. Was he really that afraid I'd hurt Vanessa?

Evelyn scoffed inwardly.

Vanessa pouted, her face twisting into panic. Tears welled in her eyes as she cradled her cheek, looking past Evelyn. "I didn't do anything, Evelyn! You've got it all wrong!"

Is she insane? Hitting me right in front of Nathan?

Evelyn smirked.

"Drop the act. I know it was you."

With a chilling glare, she strode forward, pulling a printed photo of Nathan from her bag and flinging it onto the bed between them.

Nathan's gaze flickered to the image—confusion, then shock.

Vanessa's face drained of color.

He'd been exhausted yesterday after a long day. When he visited Vanessa at the hospital, he'd dozed off briefly. Clearly, this photo had been taken then.

The only other person in that room? Vanessa Holloway.

Nathan didn't need it spelled out. Vanessa had tried to twist the knife in Evelyn's heart—but she'd miscalculated.

How could she keep playing the meek, pitiful victim now?

Before, Evelyn might have hesitated with Nathan watching. Not anymore.

Her lips curled into a cold smile. "I told you I came to settle debts. This is what you owe me, Vanessa. You're the homewrecker here."

She tilted her head. "Happy now? Congratulations on replacing me as Mrs. Blackwood."

Nathan could easily guess how Evelyn had gotten the photo. The realization left him oddly breathless.

His expression hardened as he studied Vanessa's sickly pallor. She trembled under his scrutiny. "Nathan, Evelyn must have misunderstood! I didn't take that photo!"

Her voice cracked. "She probably staged this to frame me!"

Nathan's brow furrowed as Vanessa clutched his sleeve, tears spilling. "I'll apologize to Evelyn. If my needing her blood causes problems between you two, I won't ask again. I swear on Theodore's name—I had nothing to do with that photo!"

At the mention of Theodore, Nathan's jaw tightened. His best friend's dying wish flashed through his mind. Some of the storm in his eyes faded.

"Evelyn shouldn't have hit you." His voice was clipped. "Do you need a doctor?"

Vanessa shook her head, still cradling her stinging cheek. "It's fine."

Nathan nodded, then turned to Evelyn. She stood there, arms crossed, lips twisted in mocking amusement. The sight of her indifference sent an unfamiliar pang through him.

"You asked for a divorce because of this?" He exhaled sharply. "Never mind. Get the blood drawn first."

He wanted to explain, but not here—not with witnesses.

A meaningless photo paled in comparison to Vanessa's health. He'd clarify things with Evelyn later.

Relief flooded Vanessa. He still chose me. Evelyn lost again.

Evelyn had expected this. Vanessa was a master manipulator, and frankly, Evelyn was done playing her games.

She turned to the hovering doctor. "Are you certain she needs a transfusion?"

The doctor stiffened. Under Nathan's piercing stare, he nodded hastily. "Yes. Ms. Holloway's fall caused significant blood loss. It's urgent."

"Then what are you waiting for?" Nathan snapped.

"Right away, sir." The doctor scurried off.

Vanessa shot Evelyn a smug smirk—visible only to her.

"Wait."

Evelyn didn't follow the doctor. Instead, she stepped forward and yanked Vanessa's blanket away in one swift motion.
###Chapter 4: A New Beginning

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't care less about Vanessa Holloway's embarrassment.

Her sharp eyes landed on Vanessa's bandaged left leg. Without hesitation, she tore off the gauze despite Vanessa's frantic protests.

The temperature in the hospital room plummeted instantly.

Evelyn scoffed at the barely visible scratch beneath the bandages.

"Such a life-threatening injury," she mocked. "I don't even see a single drop of blood. If I'd arrived any later, it might have miraculously healed on its own."

"Nathan, please—" Vanessa's voice trembled as she met Nathan Blackwood's stormy gaze. "I just... I need the transfusion because I feel so weak..."

"You get 'injured' four times a month," Evelyn snapped, her voice like ice. "You're not fooling anyone. But congratulations—this ends today. Find some other naive woman to be your personal blood bank."

With that final blow, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode out, slamming the door behind her.

The moment the door closed, Evelyn's strength evaporated. She collapsed onto a hallway bench, feeling like the weight of the world had crushed her.

Tears streamed down her face as she fumbled for her phone. Her fingers shook as she dialed a familiar number.

"Alexander..." Her voice cracked with exhaustion.

On the other end, her brother sighed. "Where are you?" His voice was warm with unspoken concern. "I'm coming to get you."

Minutes later, a striking man in a tailored black suit led a team of security through the hospital corridors. They carried an unconscious Evelyn out discreetly.

Meanwhile, Nathan Blackwood stormed through the hospital, dragging a terrified doctor by the collar.

"A serious injury requiring transfusion?" Nathan's voice was deadly calm. "For a scratch? Is this the medical standard your hospital prides itself on?"

The doctor stammered, "M-Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Holloway insisted—she said you approved every transfusion! We were just following orders!"

Nathan's grip tightened. Had he really been so blind?

The memory of Evelyn's pale face after each donation flashed through his mind. Guilt twisted in his chest, followed by something darker—regret.

He pulled out his phone, but Evelyn's number went straight to voicemail.

"Find her," he barked at his trembling assistant. "Now."

But the surveillance footage had been erased. Evelyn Sinclair had vanished without a trace.

Nathan's chest constricted. He told himself it was just irritation—not panic.

She had nothing. No money. No connections. Where could she possibly go?

Gold-leaf trim. Italian silk drapes. The familiar opulence of Sterling Manor surrounded Evelyn when she awoke.

Tears spilled down her cheeks at the sight of her childhood bedroom.

A deep voice cut through her thoughts. "Stop crying over that worthless man. The Sterling family doesn't raise weaklings."

Evelyn looked up through blurred vision.

William Sterling—her father, the titan who could make Wall Street tremble with a single word—stood before her, his expression unreadable.

"Daddy..." The word tore from her throat like a sob.

William's jaw tightened. He reached out, brushing away her tears with surprising gentleness.

"Listen to me, princess. That Blackwood fool will regret this day for the rest of his miserable life."

Evelyn's breath hitched. For the first time in years, she felt something flicker in her chest—not pain, not grief, but the first embers of something dangerous.

Something like vengeance.
###Chapter 5: Humiliation

The moment William Sterling entered the room, Evelyn Sinclair threw herself into his arms, her body wracked with sobs.

William's heart ached as he held his daughter. She had been raised in luxury, never knowing hardship—yet she had debased herself for Nathan Blackwood. And what had that bastard given her in return? Nothing but pain.

If not for their prior arrangement, William would have crushed the Blackwood empire and made Nathan pay for hurting his precious girl.

"Evelyn, remember our deal?" William murmured, stroking her hair as she cried. "If that man didn't love you within three years, you'd return to take your place at Sterling Enterprises. It's time to honor that promise now."

Between shuddering breaths, Evelyn forced out her reply. "I... I won't... be so foolish... again."

She had abandoned everything for what she'd believed was love—her family, her status, her pride—only to crash and burn like a doomed star.

Now, piece by painful piece, she was tearing Nathan from her heart. The scars would remain, but the wound would finally close.

"Good." William's eyes shone with pride. "Your brother Alexander will guide you at the company. Once you're settled, we'll host a gala to reintroduce you to society as a Sterling heiress."

Before the official announcement, Evelyn's closest friend Isabella Montgomery came rushing over. The moment she saw Evelyn, Isabella engulfed her in a fierce embrace. "Darling! I've missed you terribly! Congratulations on your divorce!"

Isabella had been the loudest voice against Evelyn's marriage from the start. Seeing her best friend after years of estrangement brought fresh tears to Evelyn's eyes. They talked for hours, catching up on everything.

Eventually, Isabella demanded to see the divorce papers. With reluctance, Evelyn produced them. "Nathan Blackwood—that blind, arrogant fool!" Isabella exclaimed. "He'll regret this until his dying day!"

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "Even if he does, it no longer concerns me. He's nothing to me now."

"Exactly! With your beauty and pedigree, suitors will line up from Manhattan to Montauk! That bastard wouldn't even make the waiting list!" Isabella scoffed.

Remembering important documents left at Nathan's penthouse, Evelyn resolved to retrieve them. Isabella insisted on accompanying her—a decision Evelyn soon regretted.

Nathan's mother Margaret stood in the foyer when they arrived. The woman had always treated the penthouse as her own domain. Her lips curled in distaste at the sight of Evelyn and her companion.

"Evelyn, how many times must I tell you? This home contains sensitive documents. You can't just bring any random gold-digger here." Margaret's voice dripped with condescension.

Isabella's jaw dropped. "Who are you calling a gold-digger, you old hag? Shouldn't you be in a retirement home instead of insulting guests?"

As a socialite accustomed to admiration, Isabella wasn't about to tolerate such rudeness. The interaction revealed volumes about Evelyn's former life, fueling Isabella's outrage.

Margaret gave a derisive sniff, eyeing Isabella's designer outfit. "Fake labels won't disguise your common roots. I've seen countless social climbers like you, dreaming above your station."

"Margaret, this is my friend," Evelyn interjected coldly. "Show some respect."

The demand stunned Margaret. Normally meek Evelyn daring to challenge her? In front of an outsider? Unthinkable!

"Respect?" Margaret spat. "For gutter trash like you? Consider yourself lucky my family tolerated you these three years. You and your little friend reek of poverty—get out before you dirty my floors further!"

The venom in Margaret's voice hung thick in the air as Evelyn and Isabella stood frozen in the doorway.
###Chapter 6: Stolen

Isabella threw her head back with a bitter laugh, her fingers curling into fists. Every fiber of her being screamed to lash out at Margaret.

"Evelyn, how could you endure these people for three whole years?" she hissed through clenched teeth. "We reek of poverty to them? I won't stand for this humiliation like you did!"

Before anyone could react, Isabella shoved Margaret hard. The older woman staggered back, barely catching herself on the ornate hallway table.

"Listen carefully," Isabella spat, her emerald eyes blazing. "Without Evelyn, your pathetic Blackwood name would mean nothing. You're nothing but tasteless new money. Try laying a finger on us, and I'll paint your precious marble floors with your blood!"

Margaret trembled with rage, her bony finger jabbing toward Evelyn. "You—you ungrateful wretch! I'll have you thrown out of Highland Estates!"

For the first time in three years, Evelyn didn't bow her head in submission. Her icy gaze met Margaret's without flinching. "Save your breath. I'm leaving on my own terms."

She turned on her heel, ignoring Margaret's shocked gasp, and ascended the grand staircase. Each step away from the toxic household felt like shedding chains.

How could she have ever believed love was worth this degradation? Margaret had trampled her dignity repeatedly, always favoring society girls over her. No more.

Evelyn took only her essential documents from the bedroom. Below, Isabella and Margaret were still exchanging venomous glares. "Ready?" Isabella asked, her smirk victorious.

"Let's go." Evelyn's voice held a newfound steel.

"Evelyn!" Margaret screeched. "I'll tell Nathan everything! Don't think you can come crawling back—"

Evelyn paused at the threshold, tossing one last scathing look over her shoulder. "Forgot to mention—I divorced Nathan Blackwood weeks ago. Even if you beg on your knees, I'll never set foot in this gilded cage again."

The slam of the front door echoed through the mansion. Margaret stood frozen, then fumbled for her phone. "Nathan! Did you and Evelyn divorce?"

Nathan's voice turned sharp. "How do you know that? Have you seen her?"

"So it's true!" Margaret crowed. "Good riddance! That gold-digging—"

"Where is she?" Nathan interrupted, his usual composure cracking.

"Gone from Highland Estates, obviously. I need to check if she stole anything—"

"She didn't take a cent?" Nathan sounded strangely disappointed.

"At least the wretch knew her place," Margaret sniffed.

Nathan ended the call abruptly, his knuckles white around his phone. Why did his mother's vitriol suddenly sicken him? Had Evelyn left because of this?

He drove to Highland Estates—a place he rarely visited. Evelyn's room stood untouched, even the platinum credit card he'd given her still in its drawer. Only her documents were missing.

An unfamiliar tightness gripped his chest. Three years, and he'd never once bought her jewelry.

Margaret burst in, face purple with rage. "The Dubois sapphire necklace is gone from the safe! Ten million dollars! I'm calling the police!"

Nathan's jaw clenched. "Don't. She wouldn't." Evelyn had never even asked for the safe's combination. Besides, ten million was pocket change—why would she bother?

The realization struck him like a physical blow: in three years of marriage, what had he ever given her?

Smoke curled from his cigarette as he sat in his Lamborghini, but it couldn't soothe his restlessness. Meanwhile, Margaret plotted her revenge. The police wouldn't be necessary—she had far more elegant ways to ruin Evelyn Sinclair.
###Chapter 7: Viral Inferno

The moment Evelyn Sinclair and Isabella Montgomery stepped out of Highland Estates, Isabella had been fuming.

"That wretched old bat! If she weren't so ancient, I'd have slapped the smugness right off her face!"

Evelyn was used to her best friend's fiery temper and merely chuckled. "Let it go. She's not worth your energy. We won't be dealing with them anymore."

Their laughter filled the car as they drove back to Sterling Manor. But when they arrived, they were met with an unexpected sight—Alexander Sterling, who was rarely home due to his demanding schedule, sat on the sofa, engrossed in a financial newspaper.

His sharp features were set in that familiar, unreadable expression—cold, aristocratic, and utterly detached.

Evelyn's heart swelled. Three years apart, yet he still felt like home.

She rushed over and threw her arms around him from behind, pressing her cheek against his shoulder. "Big Brother! You're finally back! Where did you disappear to after dropping me off?"

Alexander exhaled, the ice in his demeanor thawing instantly as he indulged her. "An urgent meeting. I came straight back after." He reached for a sleek black box beside him. "For you."

It was his tradition—no matter where his business took him, he always returned with a gift. This time, it was a custom-made, limited-edition handbag, one not yet available in the country, worth a staggering eight figures.

And it was hers alone.

He had also prepared a bespoke Chanel perfume for Isabella, knowing she'd be there. Isabella accepted it with flushed cheeks, murmuring a soft, "Thank you."

But Alexander's attention never strayed from Evelyn. His gaze darkened with quiet fury—she had suffered enough. He would give her the world if he could.

Evelyn, however, caught the way Isabella's fingers lingered on the perfume bottle. A knowing smirk tugged at her lips.

"Donovan's still overseas, locked in some top-secret lab," Alexander said, folding the newspaper. "And Lucas is at the Venice Film Festival. He’ll be back in a few days." He arched a brow. "Until then, you're shadowing me at the office."

Evelyn groaned but nodded. She knew better than to argue.

Late that night.

"Holy hell!" Isabella's frantic voice crackled through the phone, jolting Evelyn awake.

Evelyn rubbed her eyes. "What's wrong?"

"Get online. Now. Nathan's family just dragged you through the mud!"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. She grabbed her phone and pulled up the trending hashtag: #BlackwoodExWife.

The official Blackwood Corporation account had released a statement—accusing her of stealing valuable jewelry after the divorce. They demanded its return by morning... or they'd involve the police.

Isabella was seething. "Valuable? They're making a federal case over some ten-million-dollar trinkets? As if you'd ever stoop to stealing from those snakes!"

The internet had already erupted. Comments flooded in, painting Evelyn as a gold-digging thief. Her social media was raided—every innocent post twisted into something sinister.

"Peaceful times? More like scheming times!"

"Karma’s a bitch. No wonder they kicked her out!"

"Call the cops! Thieves belong in jail!"

Evelyn recognized the jewelry in question—Nathan had kept it locked away, the safe's code a mystery she'd never cared to uncover.

A bitter laugh escaped her. "So this is how Nathan plays after a divorce? Smearing my name?" Her voice turned lethal. "He thinks I'll just take this lying down?"

She dialed Alexander. "G, Horizon Media—it's still under my name, right? Who's running it now?"

Alexander's voice was tight. "Dominic Young. I'll have him bury this."

"No." Evelyn's tone was steel. "I'll handle it myself."

By dawn, the scandal had spread like wildfire. Evelyn Sinclair was the internet's favorite villain.

At 8:00 AM sharp, she logged into her account and posted a single photo—with a statement that would change everything.

Then she stared out the window, the morning sun mocking her naivety.

"I really was blind... to ever love Nathan Blackwood."
###Chapter 8: The Reckoning

The photograph Evelyn Sinclair had posted showed Nathan Blackwood entangled with Vanessa Holloway. Their compromising position left no room for interpretation.

What was meant to be a weapon to destroy Evelyn had instead become her shield.

Her statement was crisp and devastating:

[Dear Mr. Blackwood,

I was deeply disturbed to learn of Daydream’s disappearance. Concerned for its recovery, I engaged a private investigator immediately.

The investigator traced the necklace across the Pacifica Ocean to Germany, where it was discovered in the possession of Ms. Sophia Blackwood. It appears Ms. Blackwood has developed quite the gambling habit.

I suggest you verify these findings before making further accusations.

Sincerely,
Evelyn Sinclair.]

Attached was the investigator’s detailed report—along with a damning photo of Daydream resting on a casino table beside Sophia Blackwood.

The scandal erupted like wildfire.

Evelyn, the wronged ex-wife, had not only defended herself with precision but had done so with undeniable proof. The public’s sympathy shifted instantly.

Nathan Blackwood, meanwhile, had been drinking with associates that night, oblivious to the storm brewing. By morning, Blackwood Industries’ stocks were plummeting.

His office was thick with tension.

Harrison, his assistant, stood frozen, barely daring to breathe.

"Who authorized the company account to issue that statement?" Nathan’s voice was ice.

"Madam Margaret ordered it last night," Harrison stammered. "She claimed you were informed."

Nathan swept his desk clean with a violent motion. "Since when does this company take orders from her?" His glare was lethal. "Fire the entire PR team."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Y-Yes, sir."

"Get that post removed. Now."

Harrison hesitated. "President Dominic of Horizon Media has locked the story for twenty-four hours. No one can touch it."

Horizon Media ruled the entertainment world. Defying them was impossible.

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "So Evelyn’s pulling strings now, is she?" His fingers curled into fists. "‘Dear Mr. Blackwood’—as if I orchestrated this?"

His phone buzzed. Margaret’s name flashed on the screen. He rejected the call without hesitation.

Then his father’s number appeared.

Nathan exhaled sharply before answering.

"Make Evelyn delete that post immediately!" Charles Blackwood’s voice was a controlled storm. "This humiliation ends now."

Margaret snatched the phone. "Bring that ungrateful wretch back here! She’ll pay for this!"

Nathan’s tone turned glacial. "Did she lie? Sophia stole the necklace. Why frame Evelyn?"

He despised Evelyn’s detached tone in the statement—as if their past meant nothing.

But his fury burned hotter at his mother’s shameless scapegoating.

Margaret scoffed. "How was I supposed to know Sophia took it? It was in your safe! Who else would’ve—"

"Apologize to Evelyn," Nathan cut in. "Now."

Margaret exploded. "Apologize? To that gold-digging nobody? She’s the one who should be groveling!"

Nathan’s patience snapped. "We’re divorced, Mother. This ends here."

The line went dead.

But the war had only just begun.
###Chapter 9: The Grand Affair

Nathan Blackwood slammed the phone down with enough force to make his assistant Harrison flinch. His jaw was clenched so tight it ached.

He'd tried calling Evelyn Sinclair seventeen times. Seventeen. Each call went straight to voicemail before he realized she'd blocked his number.

The office walls seemed to close in around him.

"Find her," Nathan growled, his voice like gravel. "I don't care what resources you need. Fifteen minutes."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Mr. Blackwood, we've already checked everywhere in San Francisco. There's no record of Ms. Sinclair leaving the city, but..."

Nathan's knuckles turned white around his Montblanc pen.

Thirty minutes later, Blackwood Industries retracted their statement about Evelyn and issued a public apology for the "misunderstanding." Notably absent was any mention of their marriage status.

It did little to quell the storm.

Nathan found himself scrolling through Evelyn's Instagram late into the night. Post after post documented their life together - each one a knife twist in his gut.

[Surprised hubby with his favorite tiramisu! ? #HappyWifeHappyLife]

[Three years today! Still makes my heart race when he walks in the room ?]

[Left work early to make Nathan's favorite lasagna. Burned it. Ordering takeout instead ?]

The posts stopped abruptly three weeks ago. The final entry was that sterile, lawyer-approved statement announcing their separation. No emojis. No warmth. Just cold, hard facts.

When he refreshed the page, every trace of their life together had vanished. Deleted. Erased. As if those three years meant nothing.

His chest constricted painfully.

"Like hell she gets to pretend this never happened," Nathan muttered to the empty office.

One month later, The Grandeur Hotel

The annual San Francisco Elite Gala was invitation-only, with security checkpoints spanning three city blocks. Paparazzi lenses couldn't penetrate the fortress of bodyguards surrounding the venue.

Nathan arrived in a custom Aston Martin, Vanessa Holloway clinging to his arm like ivy. She'd seized the opportunity the moment news of his divorce broke, though he'd pointedly avoided her "concerned" visits. Tonight, she'd leveraged her uncle's connections to secure an invitation.

"Mr. Blackwood! What an honor." The event coordinator rushed forward, only to freeze when commotion erupted at the entrance.

"Alexander Sterling just arrived!"

All heads turned as a matte black Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up. The Wall Street titan emerged with the effortless grace of old money, his presence commanding immediate attention.

But Sterling didn't proceed inside. Instead, he circled the vehicle and opened the opposite door with a gentleman's flourish.

The crowd held its breath.

Then she appeared.

Evelyn Sinclair descended in a couture gown that seemed spun from moonlight, diamonds catching every flicker of the chandeliers. The dress hugged every curve before cascading into a liquid silver train. Her hair, swept into an elegant chignon, revealed the Sterling emerald earrings - a family heirloom worth more than most attendees' annual salaries.

Nathan's breath hitched.

She looked every inch the Sterling heiress she was, her hand resting lightly on her brother's arm as they glided past the stunned onlookers. That familiar citrus-and-vanilla perfume teased Nathan's senses as she passed.

Close enough to touch.

Miles away from reach.
###Chapter 10 The Forgotten Bride

The grand ballroom glittered with crystal chandeliers, every inch dripping with opulence. New York's elite mingled beneath the golden light, champagne flutes clinking in celebration.

Evelyn Sinclair had steeled herself for this moment. Seeing Nathan Blackwood again didn't so much as make her pulse stutter. That chapter of her life was firmly closed.

Though society knew Nathan had an ex-wife, he'd never paraded Evelyn at events like this trophy wife. Their divorce had been tabloid fodder, but she remained just a name to most.

Her lips curved when she spotted Vanessa Holloway clinging to Nathan's arm. "Already took my place?" she murmured to herself.

Alexander Sterling caught her subtle shift and gave her forearm a reassuring squeeze. "I've got you."

Evelyn's smile deepened. "It's not me who should be worried."

She straightened her spine. "I've got nothing left to lose. That makes me dangerous."

Alexander approached Nathan with the effortless grace of equals. Both men commanded rooms without trying.

"Mr. Blackwood. Your reputation precedes you."

"Mr. Sterling. Likewise."

Their handshake lasted precisely three seconds. Nathan's gaze burned into the woman beside Alexander.

Evelyn stood radiant in her custom emerald gown, the color making her porcelain skin glow. The transformation from the woman Nathan remembered was staggering. He couldn't look away.

This version of Evelyn was intoxicating - confident, untouchable. Something primal stirred in Nathan's chest.

Had she run straight to Alexander Sterling after leaving him? The thought made his jaw clench.

Vanessa's shrill voice cut through his thoughts. "Evelyn! What are you doing here?" Her tone implied Evelyn didn't belong. "These events have standards."

Nathan frowned, but Alexander spoke first, his voice dripping with disdain. "And you are...?"

Vanessa flushed. "You should know Evelyn just divorced—"

"Is there a ban on divorcees?" Alexander arched a brow. "Mr. Blackwood seems welcome enough."

Vanessa tucked hair behind her ear, shooting Nathan a pleading look. He remained silent, watching Evelyn with unreadable intensity.

Evelyn gave a soft, mocking laugh. "Since when do I answer to you, Vanessa? Last I checked, you weren't the morality police."

The tension crackled. Everyone knew about Nathan and Vanessa's affair, though the Blackwoods had tried to bury it.

Alexander's gaze swept over Vanessa like she was something unpleasant on his shoe. "The event organizers should be more selective with their guest list. Mr. Blackwood, your taste in companions has... deteriorated."

With that, he guided Evelyn away, leaving Vanessa seething.

Nathan watched them go, his expression stormy. That woman - his wife - was thriving without him? Flirting with another man in front of everyone?

Business associates approached, giving Nathan an excuse to ditch Vanessa. He needed space to think.

Near the floor-to-ceiling windows, Evelyn stood alone by the illuminated pool, moonlight dancing across the water's surface. The red wine in her glass matched her smirk.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms. How dare that discarded wife show her face here?
###Chapter 11 The Game of Deception

Vanessa Holloway's expression darkened as she approached Evelyn Sinclair with deliberate steps.

Evelyn didn't need to turn around to know who was coming. Only one person would seek her out with such hostility.

With a casual glance, she took in Vanessa's carefully crafted pitiful expression.

The mask of innocence had already fallen away, revealing the cold smirk beneath.

"Did you crash this party just to get close to Nathan?" Vanessa's voice dripped with venom. "You're divorced. Stop clinging to him like some pathetic stray. If I were you, I'd disappear."

Evelyn met her gaze with icy amusement.

"Vanessa Holloway, the whole world knows you're the homewrecker in our marriage. Enjoying your fifteen minutes of fame?"

After the scandal broke, internet sleuths had exposed Vanessa's frequent appearances with Nathan Blackwood.

Though Nathan's team had scrubbed the evidence, the damage was done. Vanessa had become social media's favorite villain, losing sleep over the backlash.

"Titles mean nothing compared to real feelings," Vanessa sneered. "Nathan and I have something you'll never understand." Her jealous eyes raked over Evelyn's ensemble. "Did you sell another pint of blood to afford that dress? Or is all this rented?" She inched closer to the pool's edge, fingers twitching.

Evelyn recognized the dangerous glint in her eyes. History was about to repeat itself.

Three years ago at their wedding reception, Vanessa had pulled this exact stunt.

"You'll never be happy," Vanessa had whispered before throwing herself into the fountain. Nathan had dived in after her without hesitation, proving where his loyalties lay.

Now, the familiar splash echoed through the garden. A dark figure rushed past - Nathan, of course - plunging in to rescue his damsel in distress.

"Don't blame Evelyn!" Vanessa coughed dramatically as Nathan lifted her from the water. "I came to apologize, but she's still bitter. I'm sure she didn't mean to push me!"

The gathered crowd murmured disapprovingly, their judgmental stares burning into Evelyn.

Alexander Sterling started forward, but Evelyn caught his arm. After a whispered exchange, he reluctantly withdrew.

Nathan wrapped his jacket around Vanessa's trembling shoulders before turning his furious gaze on Evelyn.

Their eyes locked in silent battle, Evelyn's lips curling in contempt.

"Really? The same tired act?" She tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "I suppose I should play along, but honestly? It's beneath me."

As Evelyn turned to leave, Vanessa lunged forward, grasping her wrist.

"I know you hate me," Vanessa sobbed loudly for their audience. "But Nathan paid you for every blood donation. What more do you want? Why can't you let him go?"

The performance was flawless. The crowd leaned in, hungry for drama. Evelyn felt dozens of eyes weighing her response.

She could almost hear the social media posts being drafted in real time.
###Chapter 12 Reckoning

The guests exchanged bewildered glances at the unfolding spectacle.

Everyone was aware of the Blackwood scandal, yet none dared provoke the powerful family further. They merely observed the drama with bated breath.

Could Evelyn Sinclair truly be as innocent as she appeared?

Nathan Blackwood's brow furrowed at Vanessa Holloway's audacious behavior. He moved to intervene when Evelyn turned with glacial composure.

Before anyone could react, Evelyn seized Vanessa's wrist and marched toward the infinity pool.

Vanessa struggled like a helpless kitten, her designer heels scraping against marble as Evelyn dragged her effortlessly.

With calculated precision, Evelyn gripped Vanessa's chin and delivered a stinging slap that echoed through the garden. The sharp crack silenced the murmuring crowd.

Releasing her hold, Evelyn watched dispassionately as Vanessa tumbled backward into the pool with a spectacular splash.

Vanessa's shriek cut off abruptly as chlorinated water filled her mouth. Her flailing limbs created frantic ripples across the pool's surface.

Evelyn wiped her hands on a cocktail napkin, her voice cutting through the stunned silence. "Since you're so determined to paint me as the villain, I might as well play the part properly. Consider this my confession."

The crowd's murmurs grew as Vanessa floundered. This was no graceful dive like her previous performance - this was pure, undignified panic.

Nathan's gaze sharpened as he reassessed the woman before him. The Evelyn he knew would never...

Vanessa, realizing no gallant rescue was forthcoming, began hauling herself toward the edge. Just as her manicured fingers grasped the coping, a crimson waterfall cascaded over her freshly styled hair.

The heady aroma of 1982 Château Lafite Rothschild permeated the air as the vintage wine streamed down Vanessa's face. Evelyn stood above her, tilting the crystal decanter with cold amusement.

"A little parting gift, Ms. Holloway." Evelyn's lips curved without warmth. "But don't rush off just yet. The main event hasn't even begun."

As Evelyn strode away, the crowd's disdainful whispers followed Vanessa like a toxic cloud. The contrast between the two women couldn't have been starker - one composed and regal, the other a sputtering mess of ruined couture and running mascara.

Vanessa's entire body trembled with humiliation and rage. From the moment Evelyn had reappeared, she'd stolen every ounce of attention that rightfully belonged to Vanessa.

If not for Evelyn's sudden return, Vanessa wouldn't be this laughingstock, this pitiful spectacle...

"Na-Nathan?" Vanessa's voice quivered as she searched the man's impassive face.

Nathan signaled a waiter to assist the shivering woman, his voice devoid of warmth. "You staged your earlier fall, didn't you?"

Vanessa's eyes darted nervously. "That's absurd! Why would I—"

"Enough." Nathan's glacial tone silenced her. The weight of his scrutiny made Vanessa shrink back into the pool's embrace.

"I'll arrange your departure."

Vanessa's relief was short-lived. A collective gasp drew all eyes upward.

Evelyn stood on the mezzanine balcony, casually leaning against the wrought iron railing. A crocodile leather suitcase rested at her feet while she took a languid drag from a cigarette, the smoke curling around her like a halo.

The crowd watched, mesmerized, as Evelyn flicked open the suitcase with one manicured hand.

What happened next would be talked about for years.

With deliberate nonchalance, Evelyn began tossing handfuls of hundred-dollar bills over the railing. The crisp banknotes fluttered through the air like golden leaves, carpeting the terrace and floating atop the pool's surface.

Waiters and guests alike scrambled to catch the raining fortune. The scene descended into controlled chaos as Evelyn increased her tempo, her expression one of detached amusement.

When mere handfuls no longer satisfied, Evelyn upended the entire suitcase. A veritable waterfall of cash - twenty-five million dollars' worth - cascaded down upon the stunned crowd, showering Nathan and a dumbstruck Vanessa in a blizzard of Benjamin Franklins.
###Chapter 13 Send Her Away

Nathan Blackwood, this is what you've paid me throughout the three years—for my blood. Now that I've returned it all, we're even.

Evelyn Sinclair's voice was icy, her words cutting through the air like a blade.

Nathan's dark eyes burned with an unreadable emotion, his jaw clenched tight. The tension between them was palpable.

The crowd had witnessed everything. Moments ago, Vanessa Holloway had accused Evelyn of being a gold-digger, clinging to Nathan for his wealth. But in an instant, Evelyn had silenced her by returning every penny Nathan had ever given her. Vanessa's reputation lay in ruins.

Without another word, Evelyn turned and walked away, her steps steady and deliberate. Vanessa stood frozen, teeth chattering—whether from the cold or humiliation, no one could tell.

That woman will be the death of me, Vanessa seethed inwardly.

"Nathan, Evelyn must hate me now. Let's just go," she pleaded, her voice trembling.

But Nathan wasn't about to let this misunderstanding fester. "Wait for me at the entrance," he ordered, his tone leaving no room for argument.

He strode inside, his gaze locking onto Evelyn, who was seated on a lounge chair. Beside her, Alexander Sterling—her eldest brother—knelt, gently massaging her sore ankles, his expression tender. The sight made Nathan's stomach twist.

Both looked up as he approached. Alexander smirked, casually draping an arm around Evelyn in a protective gesture. "Mr. Blackwood, shouldn't you be comforting your companion? Or do you have more accusations to throw at my sister?"

Nathan's glare was glacial, his voice sharp. "Evelyn, if I've wronged you, take it up with me. But you owe Vanessa an apology."

Evelyn tilted her head, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "And if I refuse? Will you push me into the water too?"

Her defiance grated on him. Seeing her so comfortable with another man—especially her brother—only fueled his frustration. "Since we were once married, let me offer you some advice. Kindness goes a long way."

Evelyn's laugh was cold. "You clearly don’t know me at all, Nathan. Kindness was never my strong suit."

Nathan exhaled sharply, his patience snapping. "Fine." He turned on his heel and stormed off, his original purpose—to explain his relationship with Vanessa—forgotten in his anger.

Evelyn's smile faded as she watched him leave. Alexander squeezed her shoulder gently. "Lil E, do you still have feelings for him?"

"Not a chance," she scoffed. She wouldn't make the same mistake twice.

Inside Nathan's car, Vanessa huddled under his coat, shivering. She opened her mouth to explain, to salvage the situation—but the driver suddenly gasped.

"Isn't that Ms. Holloway?"

The car slowed as the driver pointed to the massive digital billboard towering over The Regal Grand. The prime advertising space—worth millions per minute—was replaying the earlier scene by the pool.

Though their faces were blurred, everyone at the gala would recognize them.

Nathan's eyes locked onto the screen. The silent footage was damning—it showed Evelyn never laid a hand on Vanessa. Vanessa had taken a deliberate step back, then dramatically fallen into the water.

The air in the car turned suffocating.

Nathan's expression darkened, his fury simmering beneath the surface. Just minutes ago, he had demanded Evelyn apologize—based on a lie.

This was her response.

Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic.

Vanessa's face drained of color. She had never imagined someone would broadcast the surveillance footage for the entire city to see.

The car door slammed shut.

Nathan stood outside, his voice like ice. "You're leaving for Paris first thing tomorrow."
###Chapter 14 Parachuted

Vanessa Holloway begged in the car, but Nathan Blackwood felt like a volcano ready to erupt.

Had everything been a lie? Every moment of their three years together?

As Nathan strode down the sidewalk, the chilly wind biting at his skin, a sleek silver Porsche pulled up beside him. The window rolled down to reveal Tristan Whitmore's grinning face. "Get in, man."

Tristan had witnessed the entire scene at the gala. After Nathan stormed out, he'd grown bored and decided to leave too—only to find his friend wandering the streets like some heartbroken protagonist in a bad romance novel.

Nathan slid into the passenger seat and immediately lit a cigarette. The curling smoke reminded him of Evelyn Sinclair's elegant fingers holding her cigarette earlier, and his jaw tightened.

"So," Tristan drawled, "that was Evelyn, huh? What's her deal with Alexander Sterling from New York?"

The question made Nathan's grip tighten on his cigarette. These were exactly the questions he didn't have answers to—and didn't want to think about.

Thank God there hadn't been any reporters at the event. The Blackwood name carried enough weight to prevent private scandals from spreading, but still...

"We all thought you dodged a bullet divorcing that gold-digger," Tristan continued, oblivious to Nathan's darkening mood. "Did you see how she treated Vanessa? And now she's cozying up to Alexander Sterling? I never pegged her for that kind of social climber."

Nathan's knuckles turned white around the cigarette. "Shut up, Tristan."

Tristan raised his hands in surrender. "Just saying—at least she had the decency to sign the papers. Women like her should know their place."

Nathan stubbed out the cigarette violently and tossed it out the window. "Let's get a drink."

"Now you're talking." Tristan grinned and hit the gas.

Nathan needed something—anything—to drown out the storm raging in his chest.

Meanwhile, back at the gala, Evelyn had become the unexpected center of attention. Alexander took the opportunity to formally introduce her as the newly appointed Vice President of Sterling Corporation. The whispers about their relationship grew louder, but neither bothered to address them—they had more important things to focus on.

Before revealing Evelyn's true identity as the Sterling heiress, she needed to prove herself capable. Alexander had already assigned his most trusted assistant, Bennett, to support her. He'd also carved out time in his packed schedule for private mentoring sessions, which meant Evelyn now spent two extra hours in his office every evening.

"Honestly," Alexander teased as he caught her lounging in his office chair, "if you keep this up, I'll have Father personally oversee your training."

Evelyn bolted upright. "You wouldn't dare."

Alexander chuckled. "Kingsley Tech's anniversary is in two days. They're offering a major project—consider it your first test."

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with determination. "Consider it done."

"Don't get cocky. Every major company will be fighting for this contract. I'll be overseas during the negotiations, but Lucas should be back by then."

"Lucas is coming home?" Evelyn's face lit up. She hadn't seen her youngest brother in months—not since catching his latest blockbuster.

Alexander checked his watch. "Come on, let's get dinner."

But the moment they stepped into the upscale restaurant, Evelyn's smile vanished. Of all the places in San Francisco...

Margaret and Sophia Blackwood sat at a prime table near the window.

"Manager!" Sophia's shrill voice cut through the elegant ambiance. "Does this establishment allow just anyone to waltz in?" Her venomous gaze locked onto Evelyn.
###Chapter 15 The Wine Incident

Sophia Blackwood had been gambling away her fortune in Germany, completely unaware that the scandal of her stealing family jewels had exploded across social media back in San Francisco.

Her reputation was in tatters.

When she finally returned to the States, the elite women who once admired her now looked at her with open disdain.

And the one who had orchestrated it all?

Evelyn Sinclair—the very woman they had cast out of the Blackwood family.

Now, seeing Evelyn in this upscale restaurant, Sophia's blood boiled.

In the past, she had looked down on Evelyn's unknown origins, treating her like dirt.

The moment she recognized her, Sophia immediately summoned the restaurant manager.

The manager rushed over, sweating. Every guest here was a VIP, carefully vetted—people they couldn't afford to offend.

"Ms. Blackwood, my sincerest apologies—"

Sophia's glare burned into Evelyn, her fingers itching to slap that composed face.

"She's ruining my appetite," Sophia snapped. "Get her out of here. We're your most valued patrons!"

The manager turned—and froze.

Alexander Sterling stood there, his handsome face darkening with displeasure.

Beside him, Evelyn remained perfectly poised, her long waves cascading down her back, her expression unreadable.

She looked every inch the untouchable heiress, completely unfazed by Sophia's tantrum.

The manager hurriedly bowed.

"Mr. Sterling! Your private dining room is ready. Right this way."

Sophia's eyes flickered to Alexander, momentarily stunned—until she noticed the protective way his hand rested on Evelyn's lower back.

Her lips curled in disgust.

"Hey! Are you deaf? I said remove them!"

Margaret Blackwood sneered from the side.

"Look at her, acting all high and mighty. Who does she think she is?"

She smirked at Evelyn.

"Found yourself a sugar daddy, huh? Did you forget? You were thrown out like trash. You don’t belong here."

Alexander's voice cut through the air like ice.

"Thrown out?" His laugh was razor-sharp. "How creative. Since when did the Blackwoods become such shameless liars?"

His fury was palpable.

What kind of life had Evelyn endured with these people?

Margaret flushed red.

She turned to the manager, seething.

"Why are you still standing there? I said I don't want them here!"

The manager's expression hardened.

"Mrs. Blackwood, Ms. Blackwood—Mr. Sterling is the majority shareholder of this establishment. If their presence offends you, the door is that way."

Margaret and Sophia gaped.

Evelyn chuckled, her gaze cool.

She turned to Alexander.

"Go ahead. I'll handle this."

Alexander hesitated, but the steel in her eyes reassured him.

With a sharp nod, he strode inside—obedient as a well-trained guard dog.

Left alone, Sophia scoffed.

"At least you know your place. But don’t think your new man changes anything. My brother never wanted you. I could make you disappear from San Francisco with one call."

Evelyn tilted her head, amused.

"What do you want?"

Sophia smirked.

"Pour me a glass of wine. And apologize. You were always good at serving others, weren’t you? Do it right, and maybe I’ll let you crawl away this time."

She leaned back, waiting for Evelyn to grovel.

Evelyn smiled.

She picked up the decanter, poured the wine with practiced elegance—and then, without hesitation, upended the glass over Sophia's head.

The crimson liquid splashed down her perfectly styled hair.

Before Sophia could scream, Evelyn gripped her shoulders, shoving her back into the chair.

Leaning close, she whispered, her voice deadly soft:

"Remember this, Sophia."

"I was the one who filed for divorce."

"I was the one who walked away."

"And if you ever twist the truth again?"

Her fingers dug in.

"I'll show you exactly who disappears from this city."
###Chapter 16: Unexpected Confrontation

Evelyn Sinclair walked away with effortless grace. Sophia Blackwood's face turned ghostly pale, her mouth hanging open in shock.

Before she could react, Margaret Blackwood erupted in fury, snapping at the waiter to clean up the spilled wine.

"That wretched Evelyn! How dare she humiliate you like this?" Margaret spat, her voice dripping with venom.

But Evelyn was already being escorted by the manager to the private dining area, leaving Sophia drenched in red wine.

Her designer dress was ruined, her hair soaked. The humiliation burned through her like wildfire.

When she finally regained her composure, Sophia's first instinct was to chase after Evelyn—but a waiter blocked her path.

"Miss, would you like a change of clothes?"

The other diners stared, whispering behind their hands. Sophia clenched her fists, her cheeks flaming.

"This isn't over!" she seethed.

Alexander Sterling's mood had soured after the altercation, but Evelyn remained unshaken. She glanced at him with a small smile.

"Lex, I'm meeting Isabella for shopping later. Care to join?"

He shot her a sharp look. "How can you think about shopping after what just happened? The Blackwoods treat you like dirt!"

Evelyn lowered her gaze, a cold glint flashing in her eyes. "It doesn't matter. Don't let it bother you. They won't dare cross me again—not like before."

As they stepped outside, Nathan Blackwood's car was already waiting.

The moment Sophia spotted Evelyn, she yanked Nathan out of the vehicle, tears streaming down her face.

"Brother, look what she did to me! She humiliated me in front of everyone!"

Evelyn didn't spare them a glance, tightening her grip on Alexander's arm as she walked past.

Nathan's expression darkened. He couldn't believe Evelyn would act so boldly.

After Wendy's false accusations, he had expected her to explain herself—but she didn't even look at him.

Frustrated, he grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

"Evelyn. Explain yourself."

She met his gaze with icy indifference. "I did it. What's there to explain?"

She tried to pull away, but his grip tightened.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly, "are you here to avenge your sister?"

"Brother, don't let her go!" Sophia shrieked. "Make her apologize!"

Nathan frowned. "Sophia, enough."

Sophia smirked. "I'll forgive her if she bows and begs."

Evelyn laughed—a sharp, mocking sound. "Apologize? Like I used to?"

She turned to Nathan. "Do you agree with her?"

"Check the security footage before jumping to conclusions," Alexander cut in coldly. "Miss Blackwood isn't as innocent as she pretends."

Sophia flinched under his glare, shrinking behind Nathan.

"I—I didn't do anything wrong!" she stammered.

Nathan's jaw tightened.

Evelyn scoffed. "The old Evelyn would have let this slide. But not anymore."

Alexander added, "The footage doesn't lie. Review it at your leisure."

With that, he guided Evelyn to his car, shutting the door firmly behind her.

The Blackwoods were left standing in stunned silence.
###Chapter 17: Fate's Cruel Joke

Nathan Blackwood stood motionless as Alexander Sterling's sleek black car disappeared around the corner, his piercing gaze dark with unreadable emotions.

His ex-wife Evelyn Sinclair had become an enigma—a runaway train he could no longer predict.

The woman who once tread carefully around him now dared to hurl insults without hesitation.

Sophia Blackwood seethed, unwilling to let Evelyn escape so easily. She lunged forward, but Nathan yanked her back with a sharp tug.

"Enough!" His voice cut through the air like a blade.

"Brother, how can you defend her?" Sophia's voice trembled with outrage. "That ungrateful wretch humiliated me—humiliated our family! After everything we gave her—"

"Sophia," Nathan interrupted coldly, "the jewelry in Highland Estates' safe belonged to Evelyn. Who gave you permission to take it?"

Though he had never personally gifted them to her, everything in that mansion had been theirs—his and Evelyn's.

Sophia scoffed. "It's just a necklace! Why are you acting like I stole from the Crown Jewels?"

Her lips curled in disdain. "Besides, what use does she have for something like the Daydream now? She's probably selling it off to fund her new boy toy!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. He wanted to reprimand her, but Sophia's eyes welled with crocodile tears, her lower lip quivering dramatically.

"I'll review the security footage."

Sophia froze mid-sob.

"You—you don't believe me?" Her voice cracked. "She set me up!"

Nathan shot her a sidelong glance. "We'll see."

As he strode into the restaurant, Sophia scrambled after him, panic flickering in her eyes.

"Brother, open your eyes!" she hissed. "Look at how that man dotes on her! She probably cheated on you long before the divorce—used your money to keep him!"

She spat the words like venom, desperate to turn Nathan against Evelyn.

"Enough!" Nathan's voice was lethal.

He stormed off, leaving Sophia gaping.

The restaurant manager, already briefed by Alexander, handed Nathan the surveillance footage without question.

One minute passed.

Then two.

Nathan's expression darkened with every second.

Sophia fidgeted beside him, her nails digging into her palms.

On screen, she and Margaret Blackwood hurled vicious insults—words so cruel they made Nathan's stomach twist.

Yet Evelyn stood there, eerily calm.

As if this wasn't new.

As if she'd endured it countless times before.

His chest constricted.

Had his family always treated her like this?

And her retaliation today—was this the first time she'd ever fought back?

A storm of emotions raged inside him.

Abruptly, he stopped the video and turned on his heel.

"Brother, wait—!"

Sophia's plea fell on deaf ears.

Nathan whirled around, his gaze burning into hers.

"This wasn't the first time, was it?"

Sophia paled. "W-what?"

"I was just angry!" she blurted. "She moved on so fast—it's disgusting!"

Nathan's laugh was hollow. He no longer recognized the spoiled, spiteful girl before him.

"Apologize to Evelyn."

"Never!" Sophia shrieked. "She ruined my dress! Why should I apologize?"

Nathan's eyes turned to ice.

"Because if you don't," he said softly, "I'll cut off your trust fund."

Sophia's breath hitched.

For the first time in her life, she realized—her brother wasn't bluffing.
###Chapter 18 Someone You Can't Afford to Cross

Sophia Blackwood grabbed Nathan Blackwood's arm. "Brother, you have to help me!" Her voice was sharp with desperation. "Didn't Evelyn Sinclair steal your money to fund her lover? She's obviously involved with that man!"

Nathan shook her off, his expression darkening. His voice was icy when he finally spoke. "That man is Alexander Sterling from New York City. He's not someone you can afford to cross."

A flicker of doubt crossed his mind. Had their divorce really been just his fault? Or was the entire Blackwood family to blame?

Sophia froze. Though she had never met Alexander Sterling, every woman in high society knew he was the most elusive bachelor in New York—mysterious, powerful, and utterly untouchable.

Countless women would kill to marry him, yet Evelyn was the one by his side? The thought infuriated her. Since her brother refused to back her up, she had no choice but to turn elsewhere. She immediately dialed a number. "Tristan, Evelyn humiliated me. You have to help me."

At Sterling Tower, Evelyn watched as Alexander expertly prepared her coffee, his movements smooth and precise. Just then, her phone buzzed—Dominic Young, CEO of Horizon Media.

"Evelyn, I have inside information. Sophia Blackwood hired someone to tail you discreetly. Do you need assistance handling this?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint, indifferent smile. "No, let her play her little game. It'll save me on publicity costs."

After she hung up, Alexander frowned slightly. "Problem?"

"Sophia sent someone to follow me. Let her waste her time." He didn’t seem concerned—such petty schemes were beneath their notice. He handed her the steaming cup. "Careful, it's hot."

Evelyn took it with a grin, inhaling the rich aroma. "Your coffee is still the best. Even better than those overpriced baristas in Paris."

Alexander scoffed, shaking his head. "You're the only one privileged enough to drink it."

Satisfied, Evelyn took a sip before remembering something. "Since I start officially tomorrow, can I bring Isabella along as my assistant for the first few days?"

Alexander shrugged. "Do whatever you want."

Thinking of the way Isabella looked at Alexander, Evelyn quickly texted her. [You're officially hired! Start tomorrow.]

Isabella replied instantly. [Yes, ma'am!]

Isabella Montgomery came from the affluent Montgomery family. When she offered to help Evelyn, her real goal was simple—more time around Alexander.

Evelyn saw right through her but didn’t call her out. After all, she wanted her best friend and brother to get together.

In high spirits, Evelyn left for their girls' night out. The two headed to their favorite spot—Velvet Lounge.

The bar pulsed with energy, the bass thumping through the floor. Neon lights flickered as bodies moved in sync with the music.

Isabella, thrilled about working at Sterling Corp, drank freely, her laughter ringing above the noise. After a few rounds, they hit the dance floor.

Both women were stunning—one fiery and vivacious, the other cool and regal. Heads turned instantly.

Even as her words slurred, Isabella insisted on another drink. Evelyn sighed, squeezing her hand. "I'm going to the restroom. Stay here."

Isabella waved her off with a giggle.

When Evelyn returned minutes later, her blood ran cold.

A hulking man loomed over Isabella, his grip tight around her wrist.

He had noticed them earlier—two beauties dancing alone. Seeing Isabella vulnerable, he’d seized his chance.

He hadn’t expected Evelyn to return so soon.

Their eyes locked.

And hers burned with fury.
###Chapter 19 Video

"Since you're already here, why rush off? Stay and have a drink with me." The man's eyes roamed over Evelyn with predatory interest, his lips twisting into a sly smirk. His voice carried an unsettling mix of threat and persuasion.

Isabella Montgomery swayed slightly, her intoxication evident. The stranger had one hand gripping her neck, ready to drag her away at any moment.

Evelyn Sinclair met his gaze without flinching. "Release her. Now."

The man's smirk widened as he gestured toward a glass on the counter. "Come take this drink yourself, and maybe I'll consider it."

She didn't need to examine the glass to know what it contained. The warning from a bystander confirmed her suspicions. "Miss, don't go near him. That's Dominic Kingsley - he runs the underground fights in Montecito."

"A gangster?" Evelyn actually laughed, the sound sharp and humorless. She turned to the concerned stranger. "I appreciate the warning, but this won't take long."

Turning back to Kingsley, she arched one perfect eyebrow. "If I come over, you'll let her go?"

"Cross my heart." He licked his lips, already imagining his victory. Two beautiful women in one night - what luck!

Evelyn strode forward with the confidence of a panther approaching prey. When she stood mere inches from him, she repeated calmly, "I'm here. Release her."

"You're much prettier than this drunk anyway," he slurred, reaching out to touch her face.

The sound of shattering glass echoed through the Velvet Lounge as a bottle connected with his skull. His scream pierced the air, cut short when Evelyn twisted his wrist backward with a sickening crack. Before he could react, her boot connected with his chest, sending him crashing to the floor.

The entire confrontation lasted less than thirty seconds. The music cut out abruptly, leaving the bar in stunned silence as the notorious gangster writhed on the ground, moaning in pain. Blood trickled from his scalp as he curled into a fetal position.

Evelyn picked up the spiked drink with elegant fingers, crouching beside her victim. Her voice remained perfectly composed. "Would you prefer to drink this yourself, or shall I help you?"

Under the pulsing neon lights, her smile took on a dangerous edge. The gangster whimpered, his bravado shattered along with the bottle against his skull. "P-please, I was just-"

"I'll take that as a request for assistance." She fisted her hand in his hair, yanking his head back. Without ceremony, she poured the entire contents of the glass down his throat.

Dusting her hands, Evelyn stood and crossed to Isabella, slinging her friend's arm over her shoulders. "Let's go. This trash ruined our evening."

The crowd parted silently as she walked out, leaving behind a scene that would become Velvet Lounge legend. No one noticed the paparazzi capturing every moment from the shadows.

One photographer dialed a familiar number with shaking hands. "Mr. Whitmore? We've got footage of Evelyn Sinclair assaulting someone at the Velvet Lounge. This could destroy her public image if we release it."

Tristan Whitmore paused mid-bite of his imported caviar, a slow smile spreading across his face. "Post it immediately."

He ended the call, chuckling to himself. "Already showing your true colors, Evelyn? After betraying Nathan and humiliating Sophia, it's time you learned some consequences."
###Chapter 20 The Storm Returns

The digital world exploded at midnight when an anonymous account released a carefully edited video clip.

Every crucial context had been surgically removed, leaving only Evelyn Sinclair's defensive actions against the mysterious man.

Without the full story, the footage painted Evelyn as an unhinged aggressor attacking an innocent victim.

Morning light found Evelyn preparing for her first official day at Sterling Enterprises, carefully selecting a navy power suit.

Her routine was shattered when Isabella Montgomery stormed into the penthouse, phone in hand.

"Evelyn! The internet's crucifying you again!"

Evelyn's hands stilled on her pearl earrings. "What now?"

The ten-second clip showed only two things: Evelyn's furious expression and the man's theatrical cowering.

The comments section was a warzone.

"Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife caught brawling at Velvet Lounge!"

"Who knew society princess Evelyn Sinclair was so violent?"

Within hours, #EvelynSinclairScandal was trending worldwide.

The paparazzi's carefully crafted narrative had worked perfectly.

Evelyn's phone began buzzing with notifications from every major tabloid.

Isabella paced furiously. "We need to release the full security footage immediately!"

Evelyn examined her manicure calmly. "Not yet."

"But your reputation—"

"Will survive this." Evelyn snapped her clutch shut with finality. "First, I have a company to run."

The real battle, she knew, wasn't in the court of public opinion.

It was in the boardroom she was about to enter.

The paparazzi struck under the cover of darkness.

They uploaded the carefully edited footage, stripping away all context. Only Evelyn Sinclair's violent outburst remained—ten seconds that painted her as the aggressor against a helpless man.

By morning, the clip had gone viral.

Evelyn woke refreshed, ready for her first official day at Sterling Corp. She was selecting her outfit when Isabella Montgomery stormed in, phone in hand.

"Evelyn! The internet is tearing you apart again!"

Evelyn paused. "Why?"

Isabella shoved the screen at her. The video showed only Evelyn's furious expression and the man's cowering form. The caption read: Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife caught in bar brawl—shocking violence!

Comments flooded in:

"Typical rich girl behavior."

"No wonder Nathan divorced her."

"She's terrifying."

Evelyn swiped the phone away. "Ignore it. It's just noise."

Isabella fumed. Though tipsy last night, she remembered clearly—Evelyn had defended her. "No! I won't let this slide—"

"Drop it," Evelyn said. "We have work."

Outside, Archibald, Sterling Manor's butler, stood waiting. "Miss, your car is ready."

Evelyn frowned. A Rolls-Royce was too conspicuous. "No, I'll drive myself."

Archibald produced a set of keys. "Mr. Sterling prepared alternatives: a Maserati and Porsche. The Lamborghinis and Ferraris arrive next week."

Isabella gaped. "Your dad spoils you rotten!"

Her tiny convertible couldn't buy one tire of Evelyn's fleet.

Evelyn sighed. "I'm supposed to blend in. I'll ride with Isabella."

Archibald bowed. "Very kind, Ms. Montgomery."

Isabella grinned. "Honored to chauffeur the great Evelyn Sinclair."

They laughed, then dashed off before Archibald could protest. "He's worse than Dad!"

At Sterling Corp, Alexander Sterling introduced Evelyn as the new director—a coveted position many had eyed.

Whispers spread instantly. Beyond being Nathan's ex, Evelyn was an enigma.

Olivia Kensington, who'd expected the role, sneered. "What qualifies you? Three years as Mrs. Blackwood?"

She stood, voice dripping with disdain. "I refuse to work under someone like you. I'll resign if this stands."

Alexander checked his watch, unfazed. "Submit your resignation. I'll approve it immediately."
###Chapter 21

The air in the conference room turned thick with tension.

Olivia Kensington's face burned with humiliation. She had clawed her way up the corporate ladder through years of relentless effort. This wasn't how her career at Sterling Corp would end.

Alexander Sterling's public defense of Evelyn Sinclair felt like a slap across Olivia's carefully made-up face.

All eyes darted between the executives seated around the mahogany table.

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly. Starting her new position with enemies wasn't part of the plan. Just as she opened her mouth to diffuse the situation, Olivia rose abruptly, her chair scraping against the marble floor.

"Mr. Sterling," Olivia's voice trembled with forced composure, "I apologize for my inappropriate remarks. I fully support the board's decision and look forward to collaborating with Ms. Sinclair."

"Good. Meeting adjourned."

Alexander's curt response cut through the room like a blade. Without another word, the CEO strode out, his Italian leather shoes clicking against the polished surface.

Olivia exhaled sharply when the door clicked shut.

Though murmurs of dissent still lingered among the executives, nobody dared challenge Alexander Sterling's authority openly.

Evelyn dismissed the incident with a mental shrug. Her work would speak for itself soon enough.

Bennett entered her new office precisely at 10:15 AM. "Ms. Sinclair, I'll be assisting you moving forward. Please don't hesitate to delegate any tasks."

Evelyn appreciated the gesture. Having Alexander's most trusted aide as her assistant signaled the CEO's full support. "Thank you, Bennett. Could you pull all the files on Kingsley Tech's latest project? Alexander mentioned it during our briefing."

"Consider it done." Bennett gave a professional nod before exiting.

The door had barely closed when Isabella Montgomery breezed in, twirling her rose gold iPhone. "Darling! They gave me the corner office right across from yours. We're practically neighbors again!"

Evelyn's lips curved into a genuine smile. Having Isabella back in her daily life felt like reclaiming a piece of herself she'd lost during her disastrous marriage to Nathan Blackwood.

"It'll be chaos at first, but we'll manage," Evelyn warned.

Isabella tossed her caramel locks with a dramatic flip. "Please, I thrive on chaos. Oh! You have to see this." She thrust her phone at Evelyn.

Evelyn's eyes widened at the screen. Overnight, she'd become Twitter's top trending topic again.

Isabella had leaked the unedited security footage from Velvet Lounge to several influential bloggers. The viral video clearly showed Tristan Whitmore's hired thug harassing a intoxicated Isabella before Evelyn intervened.

The internet had exploded.

[OMG QUEEN BEHAVIOR! Who needs men when you have ride-or-die besties like this?!] [That's why she walked away from the Blackwood fortune - she's her own damn empire!] [Evelyn Sinclair for president!] [Somebody get this woman her own reality show!]

Evelyn shot Isabella an exasperated look. "You went back for the surveillance footage?"

"Please," Isabella scoffed, "one phone call to the club owner. Nobody messes with my best friend and gets away with it."

Evelyn shook her head but couldn't suppress a chuckle. The media circus hardly mattered now.

"Do you know who orchestrated this?" Evelyn already had her suspicions.

Isabella's expression turned serious. "Tristan Whitmore. Nathan's lapdog."

Just as Evelyn had guessed.

Whether it was Sophia Blackwood or Tristan Whitmore, they all answered to Nathan in the end.

Evelyn's smile vanished. She might have ignored petty gossip, but deliberate character assassination demanded retaliation.

"Call Dominic Young. I want every skeleton in Tristan Whitmore's closet."

Isabella's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Now that's the Evelyn Sinclair I know and love. Don't worry, I've been collecting dirt on that weasel for months."

She forwarded an entire dossier to Evelyn's phone. After scrolling through the files, Evelyn selected a particularly damning photo - Tristan at a pool party, arms around three bikini-clad women during his honeymoon.

Evelyn posted it with a caption that would make headlines by lunchtime:

[If you've got a problem with me, say it to my face. I fight fair. Unlike some people who pay paparazzi to doctor videos. Watch your back, Mr. Whitmore. Karma's coming for you.]
###Chapter 22 The Fall of a Fool

Evelyn Sinclair's fingers flew across her phone screen as she posted the damning evidence using her newly created social media account.

Within minutes, the post went viral.

Influencers across platforms began sharing her revelations, their massive followings amplifying the scandal. The internet exploded with reactions.

Evelyn's follower count multiplied exponentially as the digital mob descended upon Tristan Whitmore's online presence.

People started digging into Tristan's privileged background, his shady business dealings, even his private party photos that somehow leaked.

Kingsley Tech Headquarters.

Tristan stormed into Nathan Blackwood's office without knocking. "You need to control your ex-wife!" he shouted, face flushed with rage.

Nathan barely glanced up from his contract review. His icy gaze flickered to Tristan for only a second before returning to his documents.

"Look at this!" Tristan shoved his phone in Nathan's face, displaying the brutal online takedown. "She's publicly humiliating me! My wife's filing for divorce because of this!"

Nathan's expression darkened as he scanned the posts. After a tense silence, his deep voice cut through the room. "So you tried to cyberbully her... and got outplayed?"

Tristan stiffened. "I just wanted to scare her a little! How was I supposed to know those paparazzi would screw me over?"

Nathan tossed the phone onto his desk with a clatter. "You deserve this."

"Come on, man! I only got involved because Sophia asked me to help!" Tristan's voice cracked with desperation. "If not for me, they'd be coming after your sister instead!"

Nathan's jaw tightened at the mention of his sister's meddling. The restaurant incident should have been warning enough about her foolishness.

Tristan kept pleading. "That bitch went straight to Dominic Young at Horizon Media! Now no one will take my calls. I'm being crucified online!"

The situation had spiraled beyond Tristan's worst nightmares. Evelyn's counterattack left him exposed and vulnerable.

His grandfather threatened to disown him. His social circle mocked him. Even his usually docile wife had grown a spine.

Tristan didn't care about the marriage - but losing his family's support would ruin him.

Nathan finally looked up, his cold stare piercing. "There's only one person who can fix this for you."

"Evelyn?" Tristan recoiled. "I'm not groveling to that scheming-"

The office door opened as Harrison entered. "Sir, the board is waiting."

Nathan stood, straightening his suit. "Handle your own mess." He walked out without another glance.

Defeated, Tristan slumped in his car, ignoring the barrage of angry calls from his family.

"This is bullshit!" He slammed his fist against the steering wheel.

But he had no choice. Unless he appeased Evelyn, his life would implode.

With great reluctance, Tristan ordered his assistant to post a public apology from his verified account with 800,000 followers:

[I sincerely regret sharing edited content about Ms. Sinclair. My actions were inappropriate and I take full responsibility for any harm caused.]

The surrender was complete.

Tristan knew Evelyn must have concrete proof of his involvement. Continuing this battle would only bring more humiliation.

Though not a public figure, the damage to his reputation stung. His social circle would never let him live this down.

Sterling Corporation.

Isabella Montgomery breezed into Evelyn's office, waving her phone triumphantly. "Tristan Whitmore folded faster than cheap lawn furniture! I expected at least a day of fighting."

Evelyn smirked, scrolling through the apology. "Some men can't handle when a woman fights back."
###Chapter 23

Evelyn Sinclair

Evelyn scrolled through her phone, her lips curling into a smirk as she skimmed the trending headlines. Without a second thought, she tossed it aside.

She knew the Whitmore family inside out. There was no doubt Tristan’s parents had forced his hand.

That man would rather swallow glass than admit he was wrong.

Right now, he was probably seething with rage at the mere thought of her.

A sharp knock interrupted her thoughts. Olivia Kensington pushed the door open without waiting for an answer, her smile polished but insincere.

"Ms. Evelyn, do you have a moment?"

Evelyn gestured lazily. "Come in."

Olivia stepped inside, her gaze flickering toward Isabella Montgomery with clear annoyance. But Isabella, blissfully oblivious, didn’t budge.

"What is it?" Evelyn asked.

"I noticed Mr. Bennett is compiling data for the Kingsley Tech project." Olivia leaned in, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "You might not be aware, but we don’t have strong ties with them. The chances of collaboration are… slim."

She slid a folder across the desk, her manicured nails tapping against the surface.

"If you want to make an impression, why not consider Kensington Group? They have a project that’s perfect for us."

Evelyn studied her for a beat before flipping open the file. "I’ll think about it."

Olivia’s smile tightened. "You should act fast, Ms. Evelyn. Kensington is a long-standing partner. Securing this deal would solidify your position here."

Interesting.

Olivia had been gunning for her at the meeting, and now she was handing her a golden opportunity?

Too good to be true.

Evelyn leaned back, her voice cool. "It’s Vice President Sinclair to you."

Olivia’s face twisted. "Don’t get ahead of yourself just because the CEO favors you!" Her voice rose shrilly. "Whether you last here depends on more than luck. I’ve given you the chance—take it or leave it!"

She stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

Isabella blinked. "Who’s the boss here again?"

Evelyn chuckled, flipping through the documents. "She thought this position was hers before I showed up."

"Delusional," Isabella snorted.

Evelyn handed her the file. "Isn’t the VP of Kensington Group one of your admirers?"

Isabella grinned. "Say no more. I’ll dig up whatever’s fishy about this."

Her phone buzzed. The caller ID flashed—Natalie Beaumont, her old friend and the powerhouse behind the luxury fashion brand Lumière.

Natalie’s private shows were near-impossible to get into.

Evelyn answered, and Natalie’s excited voice spilled out. "You’re coming out tonight! We’re throwing a little welcome-back party at Velvet Lounge. No excuses!"

Evelyn laughed. She had missed them. "I’ll be there."

As soon as she hung up, Isabella added her to a group chat—Sebastian Hart, Julian Hart, and Natalie.

[Natalie Beaumont]: Evelyn’s back in the group! Cheers, darling!

[Sebastian Hart]: I already drank myself stupid celebrating your divorce. Took you long enough!

[Julian Hart]: Congrats on ditching that loser, Nikki!

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Are they seriously throwing a party over my failed marriage?"

Isabella sighed. "No, you idiot. We’re celebrating because you’re free. When we heard how miserable you were, everyone in this group cursed Nathan Blackwood’s name. We just didn’t want to upset you by adding you sooner."

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "I really don’t deserve you guys."

Meanwhile, Tristan Whitmore was drowning his sorrows, dragging Nathan Blackwood to Velvet Lounge.

As they stepped out of the car, Tristan froze.

"You’ve got to be kidding me," he muttered. "Why is she everywhere I go?"
###Chapter 24

Nathan Blackwood followed Tristan Whitmore's gaze and froze instantly at the sight before him.

Evelyn Sinclair stood radiant in a shimmering silver-gray gown that transitioned into a fiery crimson hemline, cinched perfectly at her slender waist. The dress accentuated her statuesque figure, making her appear even more breathtaking. Her cascading waves of hair framed her back like a living masterpiece, her entire presence commanding attention.

Tristan muttered a curse under his breath. "What kind of twisted fate is this? Can't even grab a drink without running into people I despise."

Isabella Montgomery's group immediately noticed Nathan and Tristan. Though none of them wanted this encounter, they couldn't ignore the men now that they'd crossed paths.

"Mr. Whitmore," Isabella said with a mocking smile, "finished cleaning up your scandalous love life already? Surprised you still have the nerve to show your face in public after those photos circulated. Or was the damage not severe enough for you?"

Tristan's eyes flashed with anger as they landed on Evelyn. "Evelyn," he sneered, "I must admit I underestimated you. Never thought you had this side to you."

Natalie Beaumont stepped forward protectively. "Of course she's changed! After wasting three years with that useless ex-husband of hers, it's about time she showed her true colors. Though I notice you still run to your friends whenever you're in trouble, Mr. Whitmore."

Spotting Nathan, Natalie's expression darkened. She tugged Isabella's arm. "Let's not waste our breath on them. Come on, let's go inside."

Evelyn walked past them with icy indifference, not sparing either man a single glance. A strikingly handsome man followed closely behind her, carrying her designer clutch.

As he passed Nathan, the man shot him a disdainful look before following Evelyn inside. Tristan fumed, his face reddening. "Who does she think she is? First she ruins my reputation online, now she acts like we're beneath her notice?"

Nathan's expression darkened. "Enough. Do you want to make more of a scene? Just go home."

"Not a chance," Tristan snapped. "Why should I leave? I want to see what other tricks she has up her sleeve."

Despite his reluctance, Nathan found himself following Tristan into the Velvet Lounge. He recognized the clutch the handsome stranger carried - Alexander Sterling had held that same bag for Evelyn at the last gala.

Natalie practically dragged Evelyn upstairs, bubbling with excitement. "My fashion show is in three days! You have to bring Lucas. I've saved the best seats for you both!"

Julian Hart, trailing behind them, protested dramatically. "I reserved tickets ages ago and you still haven't given me mine! I demand to sit next to Evelyn!"

"Dream on!" Natalie retorted, greeting Sebastian Hart who had arrived earlier.

Evelyn laughed, unable to resist teasing Julian. "Will your father even let you attend when you're supposed to be working?"

Julian froze mid-step before clinging to Evelyn's arm like a child. "With you there, he won't dare be too hard on me."

Sebastian Hart spotted Evelyn and immediately stood, his face lighting up as he moved to embrace her. "Welcome back, my queen."

The Hart brothers, Sebastian and Julian, shared similar striking features. Julian possessed a devil-may-care handsomeness that could launch a thousand modeling careers, while Sebastian, several years older, carried himself with a more mature charm that never failed to attract admirers - though he never took any of them seriously.

Evelyn settled onto a plush seat as Sebastian abandoned his poker game, much to the dismay of his fellow players. "I'm out," he declared. "By the way, Evelyn, I booked The Lunatics for you. Enjoy the show."

Groans erupted from the table. "Sebastian! We were just getting started!"

"What a coincidence!" Tristan's voice cut through the room as he and Nathan reached the top of the stairs, finding Sebastian lounging with a glass of red wine.
###Chapter 25

The elite circles of San Francisco were small, despite their differences.

Tristan Whitmore and Sebastian Hart were acquainted through these inevitable social intersections.

When Sebastian spotted Tristan, Nathan Blackwood naturally came into view as well.

Sebastian tipped his glass slightly in acknowledgment. "What a pleasant surprise, Mr. Whitmore."

Noticing Evelyn Sinclair and Isabella Montgomery seated with Sebastian, Tristan assumed they were together. He nudged Nathan toward their table. "Let's join them for a game. You don't mind, do you, Mr. Hart?"

Sebastian didn’t answer immediately. Instead, his gaze flicked to Evelyn. "My queen, shall we entertain them?"

Evelyn rose gracefully, her expression indifferent. "Suit yourselves. I'm heading downstairs for the live performance."

Isabella was quick to follow. "Yes, let's go. The air up here is getting stale."

Natalie Beaumont grabbed three bottles of premium whiskey. "I'm coming too!"

Nathan’s eyes lingered on Evelyn’s retreating figure before he turned back to Sebastian. "Mr. Hart, what exactly is your relationship with Evelyn?"

Sebastian tilted his head, a smirk playing on his lips. "Friends."

"How could someone like her be friends with you?" Tristan scoffed, but Nathan cut him off sharply.

The stage was set for two performers, though the band usually consisted of three. Yet, the duo commanded the crowd effortlessly, their energy electric.

Isabella was lost in the music, screaming near the stage, oblivious as Natalie whisked Evelyn backstage.

"Three minutes left in this set," Natalie said urgently. "Demon had an emergency appendectomy. Without the violin, the next song falls flat. You’re the only one who’s played with them before—you have to step in."

Evelyn blinked. "Me?"

"They’re counting on you. Don’t you miss this?"

The pounding rhythm tugged at memories—wild, untamed. A slow smile curved Evelyn’s lips. "Fine. Let’s do it."

The crowd roared as the band transitioned. Bodies swayed, drinks raised. No one noticed the woman slipping onto the stage, violin in one hand, her flowing dress gathered in the other.

The lights dimmed, leaving a single spotlight.

Monster and Phantom—the band’s core—grinned when they saw her. Phantom launched into a deep, resonant bassline. The magic of this piece lay in the interplay between bass and violin, a dance of fire and silk.

Phantom’s fingers flew, the melody surging through the room.

Then—

The violin sang.

Rich, bold, alive.

Gasps rippled through the audience. The woman on stage was a vision—fearless, commanding. Her bow moved with precision, each note piercing the air.

The drums crashed back in, perfectly synchronized. The contrast—thunderous percussion against the violin’s liquid gold—was breathtaking.

Two minutes.

That was all it took.

The crowd erupted, louder than before.

"GODDESS!"

"VIOLIN QUEEN!"

Upstairs, Nathan Blackwood stood frozen, his shock laid bare.
###Chapter 26

Phantom guided Monster and Evelyn Sinclair offstage after their electrifying performance. Evelyn's lips curved into a radiant smile as she descended the steps with effortless grace.

Thank God I haven't lost my touch. That went better than expected.

Phantom and Monster trailed behind her, their faces glowing with exhilaration.

Monster suddenly clapped Evelyn's shoulder with enthusiasm. "Little Evelyn, why don't you make it official and join our band? We'd gladly kick Demon out for you!"

Evelyn ducked her head with an amused chuckle. "If Demon heard that, he'd probably storm out of his hospital bed just to fight you."

Monster's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Performing with you tonight was incredible. You composed this song after all - besides Demon, no one else can match our rhythm like you do. It's like you never left us three years ago."

A pang of nostalgia shot through Evelyn's chest.

She'd missed out on so much life's vibrancy these past three years. But it wasn't too late to reclaim what she'd lost.

Monster continued his enthusiastic persuasion. "Imagine the impact we'd make if you joined permanently! We'd revolutionize the entire music scene!"

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to decline, Natalie Beaumont approached with a knowing smile. "Give it up, you two. Evelyn's about to make her grand comeback!"

The moment Natalie whisked Evelyn backstage, Isabella Montgomery nearly tackled her in an enthusiastic embrace. "Evelyn darling, you were absolutely divine! My goddess! Did you see how the crowd reacted? Your violin skills are otherworldly!"

Evelyn gently disentangled herself from Isabella's bear hug. "I owe it all to Sebastian's brilliant arrangement. He made tonight unforgettable."

Assuming Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore had already left, the three women returned to the VIP section. To their surprise, both men remained seated beside the Hart brothers, their gazes locking onto Evelyn with unsettling intensity the moment she appeared. Isabella scoffed and dragged Evelyn toward Sebastian. "Let's play something. This atmosphere is ruined by certain unwelcome presences."

Sebastian shrugged with an easy smile. "Why not? The night's still young!"

Downstairs, the crowd chanted for The Lunatics' encore.

"I never knew Evelyn could play violin. How come I never heard about this?" Tristan's curiosity got the better of him, his expression genuinely shocked.

Evelyn had commanded the stage with regal confidence, captivating every audience member like a queen holding court.

"Why would we tell you? Who do you think you are?" Isabella shot back with a glare. Tristan recoiled but quickly masked it with nonchalance. "Weren't you the one who wanted to play? How about poker dice?"

"Who'd want to play with you?" Isabella sneered, still harboring resentment on Evelyn's behalf.

Nathan, who had remained silent until now, suddenly spoke in that deep, commanding voice. "Evelyn, are you afraid to play just one game with us?"

His piercing gaze hadn't left Evelyn since she'd returned.

Evelyn swirled her wine glass absently, her expression one of detached indifference as if they were beneath her notice.

Nathan suppressed his astonishment. The Evelyn before him felt simultaneously familiar and utterly foreign. Complex emotions churned in his chest, impossible to decipher.

When addressed, Evelyn lifted her chin with cool composure, meeting Nathan's gaze with a faint, challenging smile. "What exactly should I be afraid of?"

Though Nathan's challenge surprised her, fear was the last thing she felt. They were strangers now - what harm could a simple game do?

Isabella protested immediately. "Evelyn, don't indulge him! He's just trying to provoke you!"

Natalie gently pulled Isabella aside, watching the former couple with keen interest. "Relax, Evelyn knows what she's doing."

Nathan Blackwood, raised in elite society, treated social games as second nature. Poker dice was child's play for him - a guaranteed victory. Tristan couldn't hide his smug anticipation from the sidelines.

As the waiter prepared the gaming table for their face-off, Evelyn remained motionless. Instead of taking her seat, she fixed Nathan with a level gaze and posed the crucial question: "What are we playing for?"
###Chapter 27

What's the point of a game without stakes?

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze lingered on Evelyn Sinclair's impassive profile. "Well? What do you think?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Tristan Whitmore scoffed and cut in. "If Nathan loses, I'll walk out of here stark naked. But if Evelyn loses—"

His eyes flicked dismissively toward Sebastian and Julian Hart before continuing in a mocking tone, "You'll have to publicly admit you married into the Blackwood family for money. And you'll never show your face in San Francisco again. Evelyn, do you have the guts to take that bet?"

Sebastian and Julian Hart exchanged stunned glances.

Isabella Montgomery shot to her feet, ready to defend her best friend, but Natalie Beaumont tugged her back down with a warning look.

Nathan's brow furrowed deeper. He opened his mouth to intervene—

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh and arched one perfect eyebrow. "Fine. I accept."

The way she looked at Nathan then—like he wasn't even worth her time—sent a ripple of tension through the room.

Tristan nearly choked on his drink. Did this woman have any idea who she was up against?

Nathan Blackwood was unbeatable at poker dice. He could play blindfolded and still wipe the floor with anyone in this city. Hell, he'd won his first million in Vegas with these same skills. Compared to him, everyone else here might as well be amateurs.

Finally, Tristan thought, I'll get my revenge today.

Nathan extended a hand. "Ladies first."

Evelyn picked up the dice shaker with effortless grace. She gave it two casual shakes before setting it down, her fingers resting lightly on top. "Your turn."

Nathan studied her, his frown deepening. She wasn't even trying. Did she truly not care about the consequences of losing?

Tristan was practically vibrating with excitement. "Look at that pathetic attempt! Two shakes? That's it? No way she—"

Nathan lifted his own cup. Four of a kind. A guaranteed win.

He glanced at Evelyn. Her expression hadn't changed.

Tristan whooped. "That's my man! I almost thought you'd go easy on her."

Sebastian Hart chuckled from the sidelines. "Mr. Whitmore, Nathan has never gone easy on Evelyn. Though I must say, it's impressive to finally witness his skills firsthand."

"Enough flattery!" Tristan snapped. "Evelyn, show us your hand already. Don't be a sore loser."

"Tristan Whitmore!" Isabella slammed her palms on the table. "The loudest bark comes from the weakest dog. Shut your damn mouth!"

Evelyn watched the escalating tension with mild amusement. She tapped her dice cup twice before flipping it over in one smooth motion.

Before anyone could react, she grabbed her purse and stood. "I'm leaving. Enjoy the show."

While Isabella and Julian gaped, Natalie and Sebastian remained eerily calm—as if they'd expected this outcome all along.

Tristan's triumphant grin died when he saw Evelyn's dice.

Five of a kind.

How? She'd barely even shaken the damn things!

By the time he looked up, Evelyn was already gone.

Isabella smirked and rapped her knuckles against the table. "Mr. Whitmore, don't forget your part of the bargain. Strip and march—just like you said, no sore losers."

"You—you cheated!" Tristan's face burned crimson.

"Cheated?" Isabella's laugh was razor-sharp. "You're the one who insisted on this game. These are the standard rules, yet you cry foul when you lose? If you can't handle the stakes, you shouldn't have played." She turned to Nathan with a saccharine smile. "Don't you agree, Mr. Blackwood?"

Tristan shot his best friend a desperate, pleading look. Save me, his expression screamed.

Nathan's gaze swept over Isabella, then the Hart brothers, before finally settling on Tristan. "We lost."

His voice was calm. Unreadable.

Earlier, Nathan had noticed something odd—the sound of Evelyn's dice hadn't matched the movement of her hand. But strangely, he didn't feel upset about losing.

If anything, he was... intrigued.
###Chapter 28

Nathan Blackwood abruptly pushed back his chair and strode away from the table.

Tristan Whitmore sat frozen in shock, left alone to face the hostile glares from Evelyn Sinclair's friends.

The last thread of Tristan's composure snapped.

Under Isabella Montgomery's piercing gaze, he felt like prey cornered by predators.

"Did Nathan just abandon me?" Tristan whispered hoarsely. "I thought we were brothers?"

His fingers dug into the tablecloth as he faced the smirking crowd. "Can we... maybe forget this happened?"

The synchronized response came like a whip crack: "No!"

Outside the Velvet Lounge...

Evelyn slipped through the service entrance, the cool night air a relief after the stifling bar. She'd already texted Alexander Sterling - his driver would arrive shortly. Another message had gone to Isabella.

"Evelyn."

Nathan's deep voice startled her. She turned to find his broad-shouldered silhouette blocking the dim alley light. Her momentary surprise hardened into icy composure.

Noticing her defensive posture, Nathan's gaze darkened.

"What do you want, Mr. Blackwood?"

The flickering neon sign cast long shadows between them. When Nathan stepped forward, Evelyn retreated, maintaining careful distance.

Nathan stubbed out his cigarette with a humorless chuckle. "Sophia provoked you at the restaurant," he said, closing the gap. "I'll make her apologize."

Evelyn's lips curved without warmth. "Save your family's empty apologies. That restaurant incident was merely the latest in a long line of offenses." Her eyes glittered with frost. "I'm done collecting your family's regrets."

Nathan opened his mouth to respond when a shrill scream shattered the night.

A completely nude Tristan came barreling through the door, hands cupped over his privates. "You'll pay for this!" he shrieked, voice cracking with humiliation.

Then he skidded to a stop, face draining of color as he registered Nathan and Evelyn watching him.

Tristan's entire body trembled as he pointed a shaky finger at Evelyn. "Y-you took photos?!" His voice broke on a sob.

Evelyn examined her phone screen with satisfaction. The perfectly framed shot captured every humiliating detail. "Such an... impressive performance deserved documentation, Mr. Whitmore." Her crimson lips curved. "I knew you'd slink out this way like the coward you are."

Tristan's mouth worked soundlessly, his bare skin flushing scarlet under the alley's harsh lights.

"Cross me again," Evelyn said, voice dropping to a dangerous purr, "and this goes viral."

Did he really think she was still that naive girl from three years ago?

As Evelyn turned, Alexander's chauffeur materialized at the curb. The uniformed man bowed respectfully, holding the car door open.

Without sparing Nathan another glance, Evelyn slid into the Sterling family limousine. Only when the taillights disappeared did Nathan finally look away.

Something unsettled him about Evelyn's reaction to Tristan's naked display - not a flicker of embarrassment, just cool amusement.

Tonight had rewritten everything Nathan thought he knew about his ex-wife. From her breathtaking violin performance to the ruthless poker game, the docile woman he'd married had vanished. Now she moved like a phantom wrapped in mist, impossible to grasp.

The realization left him strangely agitated.

Nathan tossed his jacket at Tristan's head. "Cover yourself," he snapped. "You're embarrassing us both."
###Chapter 29

Tristan jolted in shock, grabbing Nathan's jacket to cover his face as he scrambled toward the car. "Get in! Damn it! Your ex-wife absolutely destroyed me today!"

Once inside, Tristan hastily dressed while muttering under his breath. "Your ex is a total femme fatale. Ruthless. Heartless. I never stood a chance."

Nathan's expression darkened at his words. With slender fingers, he pulled out a cigarette and lit it. The smoke curled around him, casting shadows over his unreadable gaze.

Outside, Evelyn and Natalie followed Sebastian out of the Velvet Lounge. Their smug smiles widened when they spotted the two men in the car.

Sebastian sauntered forward, leaning casually against the window. His lips curved into a playful smirk. "Mr. Whitmore, it was just a friendly bet. No hard feelings, right? We're still pals?"

Tristan trembled with fury. "Easy for you to say! You weren't the one running around naked! My reputation is ruined—I'll be the laughingstock of the city!" He groaned, burying his face in his hands. "But I brought this on myself. No one to blame but me."

Earlier, when Tristan had hesitated to strip, Sebastian had given him a cold, assessing look. "If Evelyn had lost, would you have let her walk away?"

The answer was obvious.

So Tristan had been stripped bare. Now, he refused to even look at Sebastian, turning his head away with a haughty huff.

Nathan's sharp gaze locked onto Sebastian. His voice was dangerously low. "Mr. Hart, are you settling a score for Evelyn today?"

Sebastian chuckled. "Mr. Blackwood, you can't be serious. Evelyn won fair and square. A man of your stature shouldn't be a sore loser." He tapped the window lightly, then smirked. "You didn't expect her to win, did you? Three years of marriage, and you still don't know her at all. To you, she was always worthless." His grin turned devious. "But don't worry—you won't need to know her anymore. To us, she'll always be extraordinary."

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Mr. Hart, you're not seriously interested in her, are you?"

Sebastian laughed openly. "Absolutely. I plan to pursue her. And I should thank you—if you hadn't let her go, I wouldn't have this opportunity."

Nathan's jaw tightened. He turned away, his face unreadable.

Tristan, unable to take another second, snapped, "Enough talking! Just drive, Nathan!"

Nathan slammed on the gas, speeding away. Tristan shot him a sideways glance. "You're pissed, aren't you? What's the big deal? So Sebastian likes Evelyn—why does that bother you?"

Nathan ignored him. "Worry about your own scandal. Those photos are going viral."

Tristan groaned. "This is the second time she's humiliated me! Why did you even marry her? There are plenty of women out there—why her?" He shook his head. "We all pitied you. Thank God we never treated her like one of us."

The car screeched to a halt. Nathan's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. His chest tightened uncomfortably.

They never treated her as one of us?

"Get out," Nathan ordered, his voice icy.

Tristan blinked. "What? Why?"

"I'm going to the office. You're in the way."

Grumbling, Tristan stepped out. As he stood in the cold wind, watching the car disappear, he realized Nathan wasn't heading toward his office at all.

Meanwhile, Isabella strutted over, triumphant. "Tristan Whitmore finally got what he deserved. That man doesn’t learn until he’s flat on his back."

Natalie nodded. "If we didn’t put him in his place, he’d keep thinking Evelyn was weak."

Isabella frowned. "But when did Evelyn get so good at poker dice?"

Natalie and Sebastian exchanged amused glances. Natalie grinned. "When she was studying in France, she had a falling-out with her family. They cut her off, and she ended up working undercover at a high-stakes underground casino."

Isabella's eyes widened. "No way."

Natalie nodded. "She learned everything under the table—and made a fortune. When William found out, he panicked and begged her to quit. Compensated her with an unlimited black card."

Isabella whistled. "Damn. I should’ve gone to school with her."
###Chapter 30

Dawn broke with golden fingers stretching across the sky.

Evelyn Sinclair stirred beneath silk sheets, blinking awake in the sun-drenched bedroom of Sterling Manor. The warmth enveloped her like a cashmere embrace, coaxing a contented smile to her lips.

Precisely at seven, three gentle raps sounded at her door.

"Miss Sinclair?" A maid's voice floated through the wood. "Are you awake?"

Evelyn stretched luxuriously. "Come in."

The previous night, Alexander's chauffeur had whisked her back to the family estate after the Velvet Lounge incident.

Two uniformed maids entered pushing a gleaming chrome rack laden with garments. "Your father and eldest brother await you in the breakfast room, Miss. These were specially curated for you."

Evelyn's breath caught. William Sterling had clearly gone overboard - again. "He didn't buy out entire design houses, did he?"

Rows of identical silhouettes in varying hues hung before her. Though devoid of labels, Evelyn recognized the exquisite stitching and Italian fabrics of Prada's haute couture collection. Several pieces weren't even available in boutiques yet.

She exhaled sharply. Time to readjust to this gilded existence. "You may go."

After her morning routine, Evelyn selected a tailored navy shift dress and paired it with pearl earrings before heading downstairs.

In the sunlit breakfast room, William and Alexander Sterling sat conversing over steaming coffee. Her father's face lit up. "There's my sleeping beauty!"

Alexander's eyes twinkled with amusement. "Heard Tristan Whitmore made quite the spectacle fleeing Velvet Lounge last night. Even with his face covered, everyone recognized him."

William snorted. "Old Man Whitmore dragged him home at dawn. Their PR team's working overtime after the stock plummeted." He beamed at Evelyn. "That's my girl."

Evelyn took her seat with an elegant shrug. "He started it." She accepted a bowl of berries from a server. "Though I might've finished it."

"Whatever my princess wants," William chuckled, pushing a fresh croissant toward her.

After breakfast, Alexander dropped Evelyn at Sterling Corp headquarters. Her assistant Bennett stood waiting outside her office door.

"Ms. Sinclair, Olivia Kensington arrived early. She's inside." He lowered his voice. "Any word from Kingsley Tech?"

"I've spoken with Dominic Kingsley personally. He suggested dinner negotiations."

"Shall I arrange it?"

Evelyn nodded before pushing open her office door - and froze.

Olivia Kensington lounged in Evelyn's ergonomic chair, spinning lazily while examining her manicure. The atmosphere turned glacial the moment their eyes met.

Olivia sprang up, shooting Bennett a venomous look. "You didn't announce her!"

Evelyn glided forward, lips curved in a dangerous smile. "Since you're so fond of that chair, Ms. Kensington, it's yours. Bennett, have it delivered to her office."

Olivia's cheeks flushed crimson. "That's not necessary-"

"I insist." Evelyn settled on the sofa, crossing her legs. "I have... particular tastes regarding personal space."

The unspoken insult hung between them. Olivia's eyes flashed with barely contained rage before she forced a smile. That gold-digging bitch thinks she's so superior just because she slept her way to the top.

Evelyn arched a brow. "To what do I owe this... unexpected visit?"

Olivia slapped a folder onto the coffee table. "Consider this a professional courtesy. Kensington Group's chairman wants to discuss the Pacific Heights project over dinner tonight." Her smile turned saccharine. "Don't say I never share."

Evelyn skimmed the proposal before snapping it shut. Olivia's sudden generosity reeked of deception - but playing along might prove entertaining.

"Will you be joining us?"

"Of course. I'll make introductions."

"How... thoughtful." Evelyn handed the documents to Bennett. "Increase our bid by thirty percent."

Without hesitation, Bennett nodded. "Immediately, ma'am."

The door burst open as Isabella Montgomery staggered in, arms overflowing with blood-red roses. "Evelyn! Rescue me!"

Evelyn blinked at the floral avalanche. "What on earth-"

"Someone's clearly smitten," Isabella sing-songed, peering over the blossoms with a mischievous grin. "And I do mean smitten."
###Chapter 31

Evelyn Sinclair rubbed her temples, clearly annoyed.

Isabella Montgomery burst into laughter. "Who on earth would be foolish enough to send you flowers?"

"Sebastian Hart, obviously," Evelyn replied dryly. "He made sure they were delivered directly to me."

"Sebastian?" Isabella smirked. "That man certainly knows how to make an impression."

She leaned in conspiratorially. "Old Master Hart shipped Julian off to study abroad. Rumor has it if he fails this time, his grandfather will break his legs."

Evelyn sighed. "What a shame we didn’t get to say goodbye. I suppose we’ll just have to throw him a grand welcome-back party when he returns."

With a wave of her hand, Evelyn summoned her assistant to remove the flowers from her office. The overpowering floral scent was giving her a headache.

Isabella nodded in agreement. "Good call. By the way, I looked into Kensington Group like you asked."

Evelyn lifted an eyebrow, waiting.

Isabella grinned. "Kensington Group is nothing but a hollow shell. They’re drowning in debt, begging for loans everywhere. The bank’s about to auction them off, and all they have left are worthless projects. Olivia Kensington is clearly trying to set you up."

This confirmed Evelyn’s suspicions. A slow smirk curved her lips. "So she’s digging a pit for me to fall into? Tonight’s dinner just got a lot more interesting."

"Thanks," she added.

Isabella shrugged. "Don’t mention it. But… I won’t be able to work with you anymore. My mother’s returning from Hong Kong. She just acquired a new cosmetics company and promised me a role in R&D."

She hesitated. "You know this has always been my dream."

Isabella’s mother was a powerhouse in the industry, always pushing her toward management. But Isabella had always preferred the lab. Now that she finally had the chance to pursue research, she wasn’t about to let it slip away.

Evelyn smiled warmly. "Then I wish our brilliant Miss Montgomery all the success in the world."

The two shared a knowing look. No further words were needed—their friendship had always been built on unspoken understanding.

"Just be careful," Isabella warned. "If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask. We’ve got your back."

Evelyn nodded. "Don’t worry. I won’t be a stranger."

After a few more minutes of chatter, Isabella grabbed her purse and slipped out. Evelyn turned her attention back to work.

As evening approached, she rose from her desk, intending to brief Bennett about the dinner. But before she could, Olivia Kensington sauntered into her office.

"Since it’s a private dinner, there’s no need to bring your assistant, right?" Olivia purred.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Fine."

Bennett shot her a concerned glance, but Evelyn gave him a reassuring smile.

At the private club, they were ushered into an elegant dining room. Olivia greeted a portly middle-aged man with an overly familiar cheek kiss that made Evelyn’s stomach turn.

Forcing politeness, Evelyn approached.

"Chairman Zeller," Olivia introduced, "this is Vice President Evelyn Sinclair."

The man’s eyes gleamed with undisguised lust as he took her in. "Ah, Vice President Sinclair. I’ve heard so much about you. You’re even more stunning in person."

He extended a hand. Evelyn barely nodded before taking her seat.

"Mr. Zeller, you flatter me," she said coolly.

Olivia gave her a pointed look. "Vice President Sinclair, since you’re new to Sterling Corporation, you might not know we have a strong relationship with Kensington Group. There shouldn’t be any issues with this partnership."

She gestured toward the contract. "Why don’t you present it to Mr. Zeller? If everything’s in order, we can sign tonight."

Evelyn paused, then slowly withdrew the document. "Of course. Mr. Zeller, I suggest you review it carefully."

The man took the contract, barely skimming it—as if he already knew its contents. But when his eyes landed on a specific figure, his face darkened.

"Vice President Sinclair," he growled, "why is the commission thirty percent higher than agreed?"

Olivia stiffened, snatching the contract. Her expression twisted in shock. "Who changed this?"

"Me," Evelyn said smoothly. "Since I’m overseeing this project, I have final say. We proceed at this rate—or not at all."

Everyone knew a thirty percent hike would cost Kensington Group millions more—an impossible demand for a failing company on the brink of collapse.

Olivia’s face flushed with rage. "Evelyn, you can’t just alter terms like this!"

Evelyn tilted her head. "As Sterling Corporation’s Vice President, I absolutely can. Ms. Kensington, I’m acting in our company’s best interest. Shouldn’t you be pleased?"

Her gaze sharpened. "Unless… you’re more loyal to Kensington Group than to Sterling?"

Olivia paled. "I—I’m Sterling’s employee! But business is built on trust! We had an agreement!"

Evelyn leaned back, unimpressed. "Nothing’s signed yet. Everything’s negotiable."

She turned to Chairman Zeller, her smile razor-sharp. "Unless… you and Ms. Kensington have already made private arrangements?"
###Chapter 32

Both Victor Kensington and Olivia Kensington visibly stiffened when Evelyn Sinclair spoke.

Victor's lips curled into a predatory grin as he reached for the bottle of Merlot beside him, pouring a generous glass for Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair," he purred, sliding a folder across the table. "Since we're negotiating, I've come prepared with an offer. Take a look."

His contract mirrored the one in Evelyn's hands—except the numbers were slashed by another ten percent.

Olivia's eyes gleamed with calculation as she leaned in. "Evelyn, what's the point of clinging to Alexander Sterling? He's clearly setting you up for failure."

Her painted lips twisted into a smirk. "Look at you—no designer labels, no car. Do you even own anything that isn't from a thrift store?"

She flicked the hem of her Chanel blazer, satisfaction oozing from every pore. "Trust me, I've been where you are. Victor treats his allies well. That Audi outside? Consider it yours."

When Evelyn remained silent, Olivia mistook it for hesitation. With a triumphant glance at Victor, she wobbled to her feet. "I'll give you two some privacy."

The moment the door clicked shut, Olivia's demeanor shifted. Her eyes turned razor-sharp as she cornered a trembling waiter near the restrooms.

"Is it done?"

The server swallowed hard. "Y-yes, Ms. Kensington. The drug's in the wine."

A cruel smile twisted Olivia's lips.

The waiter hesitated. "That woman... she's Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife. Isn't this dangerous?"

Olivia scoffed. "Please. She's just another gold-digger trading beds for promotions. Why should Nathan care?"

She strutted away without noticing the towering figure frozen in the shadows.

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his phone. He grabbed a passing server by the collar.

"Where. Is. She?"

The man paled. "R-room 3888, Mr. Blackwood!"

Inside the private suite, Victor's sausage-like fingers inched toward Evelyn's wrist.

She swirled her wineglass with deliberate slowness, watching the ruby liquid catch the light.

Victor tossed a tarnished key onto the table. "For you, darling."

Evelyn's laugh was ice. "Olivia got a newer model, didn't she?"

"Ah, but you're far more... valuable." His gaze crawled over her like a physical touch. "Sign my contract, and I'll upgrade you to this year's model."

Evelyn's phone "accidentally" clattered to the floor.

As Victor bent to retrieve it, she switched their glasses.

"To new partnerships," he toasted, gulping the drugged wine.

Evelyn merely wet her lips, the dark vintage staining them like blood.

Victor's pupils dilated as the drug took effect. He fumbled for her hand—

A bone-crunching kick sent him sprawling.

Nathan's grip on Evelyn's wrist was vise-like. His voice dropped to a lethal whisper:

"Tell me you didn't drink that."
###Chapter 33 Mercy for the Worthless

The strikingly handsome man with his towering frame now stood before Evelyn Sinclair.

It was Nathan Blackwood, the man who had once held her heart captive for three long years.

Her breath hitched for a fleeting second before she schooled her features into perfect composure.

Why was he here? Pure coincidence, no doubt.

Evelyn wasn't vain enough to imagine Nathan had been tracking her every move like some obsessed guardian angel.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Flint Zeller scrambled to his feet, his entire body trembling with fear.

Nathan's expression darkened like a gathering storm. "Seeking death, are you? I'd be happy to oblige."

An inexplicable fury burned in his chest. His piercing gaze could have frozen hell itself.

Just as Nathan moved to teach Flint a brutal lesson, another figure materialized from the shadows.

Sebastian Hart delivered a vicious kick that sent Flint crashing back to the floor. His fists rained down mercilessly on the cowering man's face and body.

"Sebastian!" Evelyn's sharp voice cut through the violence.

The attacker paused mid-strike, his cold eyes instantly warming when they landed on her. "I went to your office first. When they said you were here, I thought I'd surprise you."

Sebastian strode toward Evelyn as if the violent outburst never happened, completely ignoring Nathan's presence. He retrieved a bouquet from near the door and presented it with a flourish.

"Do you like them?"

Evelyn sighed, shaking her head. Though her plans had been disrupted, she'd still achieved her objective. "Thank you, but leave him be. Unless you want murder charges."

"As my queen commands." Sebastian smirked, then turned back to Flint. "Consider your worthless life spared."

Flint's terrified gaze darted between the two powerful men - Second Young Master Hart and Nathan Blackwood. Both were forces he couldn't hope to challenge.

Hadn't the rumors claimed Nathan had discarded Evelyn? Why was he interfering now?

The moment he heard he'd be spared, Flint scrambled toward the exit despite his dizziness.

Before he could escape, something metallic clattered against his skull before hitting the floor - the Audi keys.

Sebastian's voice dripped with contempt. "Take your trash with you. Don't offend my girlfriend's eyes."

"Yes! Yes, of course!" Flint grabbed the keys and fled like a rat escaping a sinking ship.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Girlfriend? Watch your mouth."

Her gaze flickered to Nathan, who was watching her with an inscrutable, intense stare.

"Mr. Blackwood, to what do we owe this unexpected visit?"

"Yes, I'm equally curious," Sebastian added, his tone laced with challenge.

"Evelyn," Nathan's voice was deceptively calm, "didn't you realize the wine was compromised? Is this the life you choose now - attending shady business dinners?"

The mocking edge in his words was unmistakable.

Accompanying men to dinners. Nearly being drugged. Was this her grand new life after their divorce?

Somehow, the thought made his blood boil.

Evelyn lowered her head with a bitter chuckle. How foolish to think he'd come to help her. He only wanted another opportunity to lecture her.

When she looked up, her expertly lined eyes glittered with defiance.

Under Nathan's stunned gaze, she picked up the wine glass and drained it in one go. Setting it down with deliberate calm, she rose gracefully.

"Thank you for your concern, Mr. Blackwood. I took precautions with the wine. But you lost the right to comment on my life choices the day you walked away."

Who did he think he was?

As she moved to leave, Nathan's hand shot out, gripping her wrist like a steel manacle. "What do you mean? You didn't answer my question."

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "I was being polite, Mr. Blackwood. I came here for business - a far cry from being your family's glorified servant. Tell me, what's the difference between your precious Blackwoods and scum like Flint Zeller?"
###Chapter 34 Just Like a Sister to Me

Evelyn Sinclair curled her lips in disdain, refusing to even glance at Nathan Blackwood again. She snatched up her phone and designer handbag, storming out in her stiletto heels with a defiant sway of her hips.

Sebastian Hart arched an eyebrow, immediately trailing after her like a loyal shadow.

Nathan stood frozen, his piercing gaze as cold as Arctic ice. Evelyn's words had lodged in his chest like shards of glass, each syllable twisting deeper.

"A lowly servant to my family?" His jaw clenched. "Since when did Mrs. Blackwood become a servant?"

Clearly, there were too many things Nathan didn't understand about his own marriage.

As Evelyn pushed through the exit, she spotted a flushed Olivia Kensington clinging to Victor Kensington near the entrance.

"So she knew all along and came prepared," Evelyn mused, lips quirking. "Then was my earlier intervention unnecessary? How amusing."

Sliding into her waiting car, Evelyn exhaled sharply. Nathan's accusations had cut deeper than she'd admit. Three years of marriage, and he still didn't know who she truly was.

Within moments, she schooled her features into perfect composure. No cracks. No weakness.

She'd promised herself no second chances. Nathan Blackwood belonged firmly in her past.

Sebastian hummed a jaunty tune as he slid into the passenger seat. "Saved your pretty neck today, darling. How shall you repay me? Cash transfer? Or perhaps..." His smirk widened. "I'd much prefer you pledge yourself to me."

Evelyn shot him a sidelong glance. "In your dreams, Hart."

"Why not give me a chance?" he pouted dramatically.

"You're like a sister to me," Evelyn deadpanned.

Sebastian's lips twitched. "I'll prove I'm the perfect match for you."

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh at his unshakable confidence. "Whatever you say, Sebastian." After all, the notorious playboy's infatuations rarely lasted a month.

Yet as he watched her smile, something tightened in Sebastian's chest. This time, he wouldn't let opportunity slip through his fingers.

Back at her penthouse, Isabella Montgomery's excited call came through immediately.

Evelyn recounted the evening's events, glossing over Nathan's appearance with practiced ease.

"That Olivia Kensington belongs in a brothel, not a boardroom," Isabella scoffed. "Wasted talent in corporate life when she's clearly born to pimp."

Evelyn chuckled darkly. "I can't dismiss her yet. She's competent, just morally bankrupt. Keeping her around as my personal jester amuses me - as long as she behaves."

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at her corner office to find her chair replaced with a plush new model. Bennett's efficiency pleased her as she brewed her customary espresso.

The door slammed open without warning.

"Are you sabotaging me, Sinclair?" Olivia stormed in, fury radiating from every pore. The barely concealed love bites on her neck testified to Victor Kensington's... eccentric tastes.

After last night's humiliation, Olivia had pieced together Evelyn's scheme. Why else would Victor refuse such an obvious offering?

Evelyn waved Bennett away, then fixed Olivia with an amused smirk that instantly deflated the other woman's bravado.

"Just sign the damn contract," Olivia muttered, tossing the documents onto the desk.

Without looking up, Evelyn tapped her phone screen. The room filled with crystal-clear audio from last night's disastrous dinner.
###Chapter 35

Evelyn Sinclair's face drained of color, her fingers tightening around the edge of the desk.

Olivia Kensington smirked. "Evelyn, if I release this recording, Sterling Corp will audit every project you've ever handled. You won't just lose your job—you'll be blacklisted. Maybe even prosecuted. Is Kensington Group really worth destroying your career over?"

Olivia would never sacrifice herself for them.

Panic flickered in Olivia's eyes as she swallowed hard. "V-Vice President Sinclair, I spoke out of turn earlier. Kensington Group isn't even worth our time—their financials are a house of cards."

Evelyn gave a satisfied nod. "Good. Never mention them again. You're talented, Olivia. Use that talent for Sterling Corp, not some sinking ship."

"Yes, Vice President Sinclair." Olivia stiffened, her pride wounded but her survival instinct stronger.

With that handled, Evelyn turned her attention to Kingsley Tech's proposal. Securing this deal was critical—aside from Nathan Blackwood's empire, no other firm had the resources to outbid Sterling Corp.

A quick investigation confirmed Blackwood Enterprises had no interest in AI development. Victory was within reach.

As dusk painted the sky in deep purples, Bennett entered with a stack of files. "Ms. Sinclair, Kingsley Tech's dinner has evolved into a full gala. They're announcing their partnership at their anniversary celebration. We've received a VIP invitation. Should I arrange a preliminary meeting?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "They're playing hard to get because they know everyone's desperate for a piece. No need to grovel. Our offer speaks for itself."

Bennett nodded. "Understood. Shall I call your driver?"

Evelyn checked the time—later than she'd realized. Just as she reached for her coat, a knock interrupted.

Sebastian Hart leaned against the doorframe, his smirk devilishly charming. "Ms. Sinclair, care to let me buy you dinner?"

Evelyn couldn't suppress a smile. "Only if you're paying, Mr. Hart."

Bennett discreetly excused himself.

Sebastian, ever the gentleman, helped her into her coat and scooped up her purse. "Finally, some alone time. I made sure Julian wouldn't interrupt us tonight."

Evelyn rolled her eyes—Sebastian's reputation as a playboy preceded him. "I'm starving. Where are we going?"

"There's this new place in SoHo—"

Evelyn shot him a warning look.

"—that I just invested in," he amended smoothly. "Thought we could test the menu."

She strode ahead in her stilettos, Sebastian trailing with that infuriatingly confident grin.

The restaurant occupied the penthouse, offering a breathtaking panorama of Manhattan's glittering skyline. Soft jazz played as couples swayed on the dance floor, bathed in the warm glow of crystal chandeliers.

For the first time all day, Evelyn relaxed. The melody was one of her favorites, stirring something deep inside. She closed her eyes, breathing in—

A delicate floral scent interrupted her reverie.

She opened her eyes to find Sebastian holding out an exquisite bouquet. "Swiss lilies. Flown in this morning."

Music and flowers—the classic lovers' restaurant playbook. But Evelyn felt no flutter in her chest. She accepted them with a polite smile and set them aside. "Charming ambiance. You've outdone yourself."

Sebastian's grin faltered. Did she really think this was standard service? That bouquet cost more than most people's rent.

But he exhaled, shaking his head. Patience.

When their food arrived, Evelyn focused entirely on the meal, savoring each bite.

Sebastian enthusiastically described each dish's origins, the atmosphere surprisingly pleasant despite his usual theatrics.

"Did you like the flowers I sent to your office?" he asked abruptly.

Evelyn dabbed her lips with a napkin. "Mmm. Thank you."

His jaw tightened. "That's it? Aren't you curious why I sent them?"

She blinked. "Should I be?"

"I'm courting you, Evelyn." Irritation crept into his voice.

A beat of silence. Then she set down her fork. "Sebastian, don't waste your time."

His glass hit the table with a sharp clink. "That's it? No consideration? No 'let's talk about this'?"

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "We're friends. Let's keep it that way."

Sebastian leaned forward, suddenly serious. "Not anymore. Starting tonight, I'm your suitor."

She sighed. "Then maybe we shouldn't see each other."

Across the room, Tristan Whitmore snorted into his drink. "Look at Hart making a fool of himself over Sinclair. What does he even see in her?"

Nathan Blackwood said nothing, his expression unreadable as he stared at his untouched plate. The filet mignon suddenly tasted like ash.
###Chapter 36

The newly opened Valentine's Bistro sat directly above Tristan Whitmore's restaurant. It had become the talk of the town, so Tristan insisted on checking it out personally—dragging Nathan Blackwood along with him.

The waiter repeatedly emphasized that this was a couples-only establishment.

Tristan smirked at Nathan and playfully tugged at his sleeve. "Don't we make a convincing pair?"

"Blackwood, Whitmore—what a coincidence."

A man and woman approached their table. Gregory Thornton looked every inch the polished aristocrat, while the woman clinging to his arm was a rising social media star with delicate, doll-like features.

Tristan scoffed under his breath. "What are you doing here?"

"Lily insisted this place was charming," Gregory said with a knowing grin. "Though I didn’t realize it was exclusively for couples." He barely suppressed a laugh.

They had all grown up together, so formalities were unnecessary. Nathan shot Tristan a glare, his jaw tightening.

Gregory found the situation amusing—Nathan was rarely caught off guard. Without waiting for an invitation, he pulled out a chair, seating his date across from Nathan. Lily’s eyes lingered on Nathan’s striking features, her pulse quickening, though she dared not speak a word with Gregory watching.

"Hey, Blackwood," Gregory drawled, tilting his chin toward the dance floor. "Isn’t that your scheming ex?"

The music shifted to something slow and dreamy. Sebastian Hart guided Evelyn Sinclair onto the floor, murmuring, "Just one dance. Since we’re here, why not enjoy the atmosphere?"

Before Evelyn could protest, the melody swelled, making a refusal impossible. Fine. It’s just a dance. The rhythm picked up, and after a brief misstep, they fell into perfect sync, their movements fluid and mesmerizing. The surrounding couples paused to watch—the man devastatingly handsome, the woman radiant, her dress swirling like liquid silver.

As the song ended, Sebastian caught sight of a familiar figure in the shadows. In one swift motion, he spun Evelyn into his arms, shielding her from view, and dipped her low—creating the illusion of a passionate kiss.

The restaurant erupted in applause.

Before Evelyn could react, Sebastian chuckled and whisked her outside.

In the corner, Nathan’s expression darkened.

Tristan watched the departing pair with a derisive snort. "Overrated. Sure, they danced well, but it’s not like they’re professionals." He’d never admit Evelyn had talent. "That gold-digger moved on fast, didn’t she?"

Nathan’s gaze snapped to Gregory. "Scheming ex? Is that what you call her?"

Gregory shrugged. "What else? She trapped you for your money. We were all relieved when you divorced her."

Nathan’s knuckles whitened around his glass.

Unaware, Gregory continued, "Remember that night we got wasted after your wedding? She called at 2 AM, demanding to know where you were. I told her to back off—marrying you was privilege enough for someone like her."

A glass slammed onto the table. The laughter died instantly.

Tristan blinked. Nathan was furious—over her?

Gregory faltered. Everyone knew Nathan had despised that marriage.

Lily trembled, realizing she’d misjudged the dynamics entirely.

"Blackwood—" Gregory looked to Tristan for help.

Before Tristan could speak, Nathan leaned forward, his voice lethally calm. "Gregory, since you’re so invested in my affairs, why don’t you run the Blackwood family?"
###Chapter 37 The Gala Encounter

Nathan Blackwood rose abruptly from his seat, his stormy expression sending a clear message. Gregory Thornton remained frozen in place, his face drained of color.

Tristan Whitmore hurried after his friend. "This must be about Evelyn again," he muttered under his breath. "That woman causes nothing but trouble."

"Blackwood, what's gotten into you?" Tristan caught up to Nathan outside. "We've been friends for years. You know Greg speaks without thinking. Don't take his words to heart."

Nathan exhaled sharply, realizing he'd overreacted. The cold night air helped clear his turbulent thoughts. He lit a cigarette, the flame flickering in the darkness. "It's not about him. I'm just... frustrated with myself."

Tristan studied his friend's tense profile. "You're not still hung up on her, are you?"

Nathan shot him a withering glance, refusing to dignify the question. "Your steakhouse could learn a thing or two from this new place. Maybe consider closing shop."

"You bastard!" Tristan's face flushed crimson. "Some friend you are!"

Meanwhile, inside the glittering ballroom of the Kingsley Tech anniversary gala, New York's elite mingled beneath crystal chandeliers. Evelyn Sinclair moved through the crowd with practiced ease, her mind focused on the potential AI partnership that could propel Sterling Corporation into new territory.

A sudden hush fell over the room as all eyes turned toward the entrance. There stood Alexander Sterling, the formidable CEO of Sterling Corporation, with his stunning companion. The woman beside him commanded attention - her wavy chestnut hair elegantly pinned up, her custom Laurent Dubois gown shimmering with genuine diamonds under the chandeliers.

"Isn't that Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife?" someone whispered. "What was he thinking, letting her go?"

Alexander raised his champagne flute with a proud smile. "Allow me to introduce our Vice President, Evelyn Sinclair."

"Vice President Sinclair is breathtaking!" a businessman exclaimed. "To hold such a position at Sterling Corporation at your age is remarkable!"

Evelyn maintained her poised smile as she gracefully accepted the compliments. Alexander leaned in discreetly. "Dominic Kingsley is waiting upstairs. Shall we?"

Nearby, Sophia Blackwood and her socialite friends watched the scene with barely concealed envy. Sophia's nails dug into her palms as she recognized the exclusive gown Evelyn wore - the same one she'd been denied weeks earlier.

"How is this possible?" Sophia seethed silently. The meek, mousy woman she remembered from family gatherings now carried herself like royalty. This confident, radiant version of Evelyn was unrecognizable.

Sophia burned with the urge to expose Evelyn, to remind everyone this was the same woman the Blackwoods had discarded. She longed to rip away that composed facade and reveal the pathetic creature beneath.
###Chapter 38

The girls fell silent under Sophia Blackwood's icy glare.

The second floor of the grand ballroom maintained an elegant hush. When Alexander Sterling escorted Evelyn Sinclair upstairs, a rakishly handsome man in a designer black shirt rose to greet them.

Their handshake was brief but firm. "Mr. Kingsley," Alexander smiled, "it's been too long."

Dominic Kingsley's lips curved into a charming grin. "Alexander Sterling. Always a pleasure."

Without waiting for formal introductions, Dominic's appreciative gaze settled on Evelyn. His admiration carried just the right balance - appreciative without being inappropriate.

"Ms. Sinclair," he said smoothly, "your reputation precedes you. I hope you'll forgive my last-minute change of plans from dinner to this gala."

Evelyn's smile was polished. "Not at all. Congratulations on Kingsley Tech's fifth anniversary. I look forward to many prosperous years of collaboration."

Her words carried deliberate double meaning.

Dominic's eyes sparkled with amusement. "Alexander, might I steal Ms. Sinclair for a private conversation? After all, she'll be my direct counterpart if we proceed."

"Of course." Alexander gave Evelyn's shoulder a reassuring squeeze before descending to mingle with other guests.

Under the soft chandelier glow, the striking pair conversed by the balcony railing. Dominic swirled his merlot absently. "Tell me, Evelyn, what makes you so certain about this partnership?"

A loose curl escaped Evelyn's updo, framing her face as she met his gaze. "Mr. Kingsley, our offer speaks for itself. No other investor matches Sterling Corporation's terms." She leaned in slightly. "We have the capital, you have the technology. We're not looking for short-term gains - this is about shaping the next decade of AI development."

Her bold declaration made Dominic reassess the woman before him. The playful glint in his eyes gave way to genuine consideration. After a thoughtful pause, he asked, "Would you consider a three-way partnership?"

Evelyn's brow arched. "With whom?" She couldn't imagine a better fit than Sterling Corporation.

Dominic raised his glass toward the space behind her. The approaching footsteps made Evelyn's pulse stutter.

The air grew thick with tension as she turned, wine glass in hand. Her practiced smile froze when she locked eyes with the only man who could rival Sterling Corporation in this venture.

Nathan Blackwood.

Dressed in a tailored black suit with platinum cufflinks Evelyn recognized all too well, he exuded an aura of cool detachment. His gaze lingered on her just a beat too long before addressing Dominic.

"I see introductions aren't necessary," Dominic observed, eyes dancing between them. "Evelyn, I should have mentioned - regardless of our final partner, Blackwood Enterprises will be involved in this project."

At Evelyn's questioning look, Dominic chuckled. "Mr. Blackwood has been funding my research since day one as my angel investor."
###Chapter 39

Evelyn Sinclair's mind raced. So that's how it is... Nathan Blackwood had already secured his position as a shareholder. She hadn't anticipated he'd been eyeing the artificial intelligence sector for this long.

If Dominic Kingsley hadn't voluntarily shared this information, Evelyn would never have uncovered it. His willingness to disclose this detail demonstrated his genuine intent to collaborate with her.

Though Nathan's involvement soured her mood, Evelyn maintained professional clarity. She knew better than to let personal history interfere with business opportunities.

She blinked slowly, a calculated smile forming. "With Blackwood Industries' resources, you could easily monopolize this venture. Why involve a third party?"

Her gaze flickered toward Nathan, one eyebrow arching slightly.

"This is uncharted territory," Nathan's deep voice resonated through the room. A faint smirk played on his lips. "Even Blackwood Industries won't gamble alone. Partnering with Sterling Corporation through Kingsley Tech is a strategic move. I anticipate our collaboration will be... enlightening."

His elegant fingers lifted a champagne flute. Dominic mirrored the gesture, their glasses meeting with a crystalline chime. Both men turned expectantly toward Evelyn.

Trapped by circumstance, Evelyn forced a polite smile. Her glass touched theirs with hollow resonance. The deal was sealed.

Beneath her composed exterior, frustration simmered. Dominic, sensing tension, attempted diplomacy. "What better way to commemorate our partnership than having you two lead the anniversary gala's opening dance? It would make a powerful statement."

Nathan's brow furrowed. Evelyn laughed lightly, tucking a stray lock behind her ear. "How unfortunate - I've two left feet." Without waiting for response, she turned sharply, ignoring Nathan's piercing glare.

Dominic shrugged. "One dance seems a small concession for such an important alliance." He chuckled awkwardly. "This doesn't bode well for smooth negotiations ahead."

Nathan's expression darkened as he watched Evelyn's retreating figure. "Can't dance?" he muttered. "Then what was that performance at Sebastian Hart's restaurant?"

Suddenly Gregory Thornton's words echoed in his mind. The anger dissipated, replaced by uncomfortable guilt. "I've wronged her profoundly," he admitted silently.

Downstairs, Evelyn maintained perfect poise until Alexander Sterling approached. "Successful negotiations?" he inquired, noting her lack of enthusiasm. "Dominic insisted on a three-way partnership. Nathan Blackwood's already a stakeholder," she explained flatly.

Understanding dawned on Alexander. He smoothed her hair affectionately. "Shared risk means shared reward. This arrangement benefits us more than you realize."

Evelyn's eyes widened. Nathan's caution mirrored Sterling Corporation's own concerns. The advantages did indeed outweigh the drawbacks.

Her mood lifted instantly. She looped her arm through Alexander's, resting her chin on his shoulder. "Thank you for the perspective, Alex. I'd have wasted days fuming otherwise."

Their affectionate exchange didn't escape notice. From the balcony, Nathan observed through narrowed eyes. Tristan Whitmore materialized beside him. "Interesting," Tristan mused. "Alexander Sterling's famously reserved with women. What makes this one so special? There must be history there."

Nathan turned away without response, descending to mingle with other guests as the ballroom buzzed with activity.

Dominic whispered instructions to the emcee, who soon announced: "Ladies and gentlemen, celebrating Kingsley Tech's fifth anniversary, we proudly announce our groundbreaking partnership with Blackwood Industries and Sterling Corporation! Please welcome Mr. Nathan Blackwood and Ms. Evelyn Sinclair for the opening dance!"

The crowd erupted in applause as spotlights searched for the reluctant dance partners.
###Chapter 40

Evelyn Sinclair froze when she heard her name announced. The last person she wanted to interact with was Nathan Blackwood, yet here she was, trapped in this impossible situation with every eye in the room fixed upon her.

The tension between them since their divorce made this unexpected collaboration even more electrifying.

Nathan hadn't anticipated this either. Without question, Dominic Kingsley had orchestrated this moment.

As Evelyn hesitated, Nathan strode toward her with effortless grace. His cool demeanor never faltered as he extended his hand in invitation, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

The entire ballroom held its breath.

Refusal wasn't an option - not when this three-way partnership hung in the balance. Alexander Sterling gave his sister an encouraging nod. With practiced poise, Evelyn placed her hand in Nathan's.

Guests parted like the Red Sea before them. Evelyn gathered her gown with her free hand, avoiding Nathan's eyes. His palm felt surprisingly cool against hers. In that moment, Nathan realized with startling clarity - during their entire three-year marriage, they'd never held hands like this. Not once.

Evelyn's fingers were delicate yet strong, like porcelain wrapped in silk. The warmth of her touch seared itself into his memory.

The orchestra struck up a lively waltz at precisely the right moment, filling the grand hall with sweeping melodies.

When Evelyn's hand came to rest on Nathan's shoulder, their eyes met briefly. His dark, intense stare seemed to peel back her carefully constructed layers. As his hand settled at the small of her back, Evelyn stiffened imperceptibly at the unfamiliar contact.

They'd never been this physically close during their marriage. The irony wasn't lost on her.

It took Evelyn mere seconds to regain her composure. Her practiced social mask slipped into place - the picture of polite indifference.

Their flawless footwork and regal bearing captivated the room as the music drowned out their private exchange.

"Didn't know you could dance," Nathan murmured, his deep voice laced with amusement.

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "There's much you don't know about me." Her tone carried just enough bite.

Nathan's grip tightened fractionally as the tempo increased. The music swelled, pulling them closer together.

"Was this partnership your idea or Sterling Corporation's?" he pressed.

Evelyn executed a flawless spin before returning to his arms. "Some mysteries are better left unsolved," she countered with a mocking smile.

For three years, he'd never bothered to truly see her. Why start now?

To Nathan, Evelyn had been merely a background character in his life's story. For Evelyn, their marriage had been a masterclass in disappointment.

Spotlights illuminated the striking pair. Nathan cut his usual dashing figure - tall, commanding, effortlessly elegant. Evelyn's gown shimmered with each graceful movement, her beauty breathtaking. If one could pause time, they'd see dozens of guests subtly catching their breath.

Every eye followed their perfectly synchronized movements. To outsiders, they appeared the picture of harmony. Only they knew the truth.

Evelyn counted the measures, willing the song to end. Nathan's proximity set her nerves alight. His scrutinizing gaze burned hotter than the chandeliers above.

As the final notes approached, Nathan leaned in while Evelyn arched back in the dance's natural conclusion. Her slender neck curved gracefully, the picture of refinement.

Then Nathan broke protocol.

Instead of stepping away, he held his position. Their lips hovered mere centimeters apart - her soft pink against his firm line.

The music's last note hung suspended in the air, mirroring the electric tension between them. Time itself seemed to hold its breath.
###Chapter 41 Intentional Move

The chandeliers flickered overhead.

Evelyn Sinclair swirled her crystal glass of champagne absently.

She leaned against the second-floor balcony railing, observing the sea of socialites exchanging hollow pleasantries below.

Nathan Blackwood happened to glance up at that exact moment.

Their gazes collided - his dark and unreadable, hers cool and detached.

Evelyn quickly averted her eyes, ignoring the sudden flutter in her chest.

That unexpected kiss during their dance had sent shockwaves through the ballroom. Nobody cared who had actually misstepped - the crowd only craved drama between these ex-lovers.

Any reaction would fuel endless gossip.

So when their lips accidentally brushed, Evelyn had immediately turned away. The music ended mercifully quickly, allowing her to retreat with icy composure.

She'd walked off without a backward glance.

Across the room, Tristan Whitmore joked with Nathan's circle. After dispersing the group, he studied his friend's aristocratic profile.

"You messed up that turn on purpose, didn't you?" Tristan blurted out. Others might not notice, but he knew Evelyn's timing had been perfect. The mistake was Nathan's.

Nathan Blackwood, raised in elite circles and trained in every social grace since childhood, couldn't possibly misstep during a simple waltz. Unless...

Nathan's obsidian eyes flicked to Tristan. "No."

"Good. Don't even think about that woman." Tristan shook his head. "I must be going crazy to imagine such a thing. Clearly she planned the whole scene! That scheming-"

Nathan's sharp look silenced him. Tristan immediately swallowed his words, loyalty overriding suspicion.

Meanwhile on the balcony...

Alexander Sterling had been pulled into business discussions, leaving Evelyn to survey the glittering crowd alone.

A familiar figure waved from the grand entrance. Her lips curved into a genuine smile as she waved back.

Sebastian Hart strolled over with effortless charm, leaning against the railing with rakish confidence. "Dragged myself to this circus just for you."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Your father forced you, and we both know it."

Sebastian grinned, unrepentant. "You're always my true purpose."

Before Evelyn could respond, an unwelcome presence approached. Her smile vanished.

"Evelyn Sinclair, have you no shame?" Sophia Blackwood sneered, flanked by her sycophants. "Divorced from my brother yet still throwing yourself at him? Our family would never accept trash like you!"

Evelyn suppressed a sigh. Just my luck tonight - every unpleasant person deciding to make an appearance.

Sophia had clearly come to assert dominance after Evelyn stole the spotlight - first with her stunning gown, then with that accidental kiss that had everyone whispering about reconciliation.

As if. Evelyn thought dryly.

Sophia trembled with barely contained rage. If not for her Blackwood pedigree, she might have lunged at Evelyn right then. That dress should have been mine! That moment should have been mine! She stole everything!

Evelyn's gaze swept over Sophia's entourage - mostly reluctant followers dragged into this petty confrontation. How juvenile.

"Well, well," Sebastian drawled, eyeing Sophia with cold amusement. "Who let the rabid Pomeranian in?"

Sophia flushed crimson. "This doesn't concern you! Are you her latest plaything?"

Sebastian's grin widened. "I like the sound of that."

Evelyn shot him a warning look before turning to Sophia with icy calm. "What do you want, Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia jutted her chin. "Don't play innocent! You kissed my brother on purpose! Thinking you can worm your way back into his life? Dream on!"
###Chapter 42

Sebastian Hart's expression turned utterly shocked.

He grasped the outrageous accusation immediately. Kiss your brother? What absolute nonsense.

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't some desperate fool who'd go after a worthless playboy.

"If you don't believe me, ask anyone present!" Sophia Blackwood insisted shrilly.

Her entourage gave hesitant nods, their eyes darting nervously between the parties.

Sebastian scoffed dismissively. "Why would I trust your little clique of conspirators? Do I look stupid to you?"

Sophia's face flushed crimson with rage. "It's true! Evelyn, too cowardly to admit it? My brother only cares about Vanessa Holloway."

She leaned forward venomously. "You were just a walking blood bag for her. Did you really think you could stay married into our family? We'd never accept trash like you!"

Vanessa's name had always been Evelyn's Achilles' heel - a wound Sophia delighted in reopening.

Yet Evelyn merely arched one perfect eyebrow, her lips curling into an icy smile. Her gaze swept over Sophia's cowering friends like a winter gale.

"The entire world knows about your brother's affair with Vanessa Holloway." Evelyn's voice dripped with disdain. "Your outburst only confirms his infidelity during our marriage. How... illuminating."

Sophia paled, then exploded. "You shameless gold-digger! Everything you're wearing, eating, living on - all paid for by your string of sugar daddies!"

Her shrill voice carried across the entire second floor, drawing shocked stares.

"Do they know you're no heiress? Just some penniless beggar who had to grovel to my brother for pocket money?" Sophia's laughter turned hysterical. "Our maids took vacations when you visited - because you'd do their work! Laundry, cooking, gardening - our personal live-in servant!"

She was panting now, drunk on her own cruelty. "My brother didn't marry a wife - he acquired free labor!"

"Sophia Blackwood!"

A voice like cracking ice cut through her tirade. Sophia spun to find Nathan Blackwood looming behind her, his face stormy.

"B-Brother?" Her bravado evaporated.

Nathan's presence seemed to suck all oxygen from the space. No one had noticed when he'd arrived, but now his fury was a tangible force.

Sophia recoiled, her face draining of color. The household staff had been strictly forbidden from discussing how they'd treated Evelyn. If Nathan discovered...

But no - what did it matter now? The divorce was final!

Drawing herself up, Sophia attempted damage control. "Brother, I was just putting this woman in her place. She tried to seduce—"

"Oh, spare us the act!" Sebastian interjected furiously. His hands clenched into fists. "Is this how the Blackwoods treated the woman we cherished?"

His voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "You dare boast about such despicable behavior? It was Evelyn's misfortune to ever marry into your wretched family!"

Sebastian positioned himself protectively before Evelyn. Those three lost years of her life weren't fodder for public ridicule.

Sophia's eyes darted between them. "What's your relationship really? Were you two carrying on behind my brother's back?"

"Sophia! Enough!" Nathan's roar silenced the room.

Veins stood out on his forehead. His chest constricted painfully - whether from rage or something else, he couldn't tell.
###Chapter 43

Nathan Blackwood didn't even glance at Sophia's expression as he strode directly toward Evelyn Sinclair. His features were carved from ice.

"Was everything you just said true?" His jaw clenched so tight the words came out strained.

Evelyn's fingers twitched at her sides. She worried her lower lip between her teeth, uncertainty flashing in her eyes.

She'd been raised by distant parents while her brother grew up overseas. When Nathan returned to New York, he became a business prodigy, multiplying the Blackwood fortune tenfold. This success had made Sophia unbearably arrogant.

"Answer me!" Nathan's voice cracked like a whip when Evelyn hesitated.

A bitter laugh rang out behind him. He didn't need to turn to know it came from Evelyn.

"Mr. Blackwood, every word was true."

Gasps rippled through the crowd as Evelyn confirmed the accusations. The glittering socialites now regarded her with new eyes - beneath her polished exterior lay a past more tragic than any of them could imagine.

After hearing Sophia's revelations, their pity for Evelyn was palpable. The scandal following her divorce from Nathan suddenly made terrible sense.

Marrying into the Blackwood dynasty had clearly been no fairytale.

Nathan's body went rigid, his heart constricting painfully. Not only had his inner circle despised Evelyn, but his entire family had tormented her. And as her husband, he'd been oblivious.

During their three-year marriage, Nathan had rarely visited their home. Each appearance had been transactional - discussing Vanessa Holloway's health to coerce Evelyn into blood donations.

He'd leave her with polite small talk about finances before abandoning her with a black credit card. Nathan had actually believed he'd treated Evelyn decently. The realization of his self-deception hit him like a physical blow. The debt he owed her was immeasurable. Now, he couldn't even meet her gaze.

His fists balled until his knuckles whitened. Yet Evelyn merely laughed again - a melodic sound edged with frost.

"You could interrogate any staff member at Highland Estates to verify the truth, Mr. Blackwood. But what difference would it make now?" Her smile didn't reach her glacial eyes. "Your family's cruelty flourished because everyone assumed you approved."

Nathan was the guiltiest of all - he'd inflicted the deepest wounds. Under the chandelier's glow, Evelyn's beauty was lethal, her stare unforgiving. "If it's all true, what will you do? Force Sophia and Margaret to kneel in apology? Make them scrub my floors and cook my meals? Or will you just throw more money at your penniless ex-wife?"

The crowd murmured in shock. They'd expected tearful reconciliations, not this scorching indictment. Among elite circles, marrying for status rather than money was an unspoken rule - one nobody dared voice aloud.

This confrontation was spiraling dangerously out of control.

"Apologize? In your dreams!" Sophia's face flushed crimson. With so many witnesses, she'd never submit. "I'll never kneel to you! You're delusional!"

"Enough!" Nathan yanked Sophia back violently. She crashed into a marble column, tears springing to her eyes from the impact.

He didn't spare her a glance, his tormented gaze locked on Evelyn. He couldn't fulfill any of her demands except financial compensation - which she'd surely reject.

For the first time in his life, Nathan felt utterly powerless.

"Evelyn, I—"

"Save it, Mr. Blackwood." Her voice dripped acid. "If you can't act, don't pretend to feel guilty. Empty apologies are worthless. Are you fishing for sympathy now? How pathetic."
###Chapter 44

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curled into a mocking smile as she fixed Sophia Blackwood with an icy stare. Her eyelids lowered slightly, the movement deliberate and controlled. "Ms. Blackwood," she said, her voice dripping with disdain, "do you truly believe humiliating me with these tired old stories reflects poorly on me? The shame belongs to your family - treating their daughter-in-law like a common servant."

She tilted her head, her gaze sharp as shattered glass. "Tell me, who in their right mind would marry into the Blackwood family now?"

"You were clearly trying to seduce my brother earlier!" Sophia spat, her face flushed with anger. The accusation hung between them, heavy and toxic.

Evelyn's laugh was light, almost musical, but her eyes remained cold. "Seduce Nathan Blackwood?" She shook her head slowly. "I have more self-respect than that."

The memory of that unexpected kiss at the end of their dance still burned in Evelyn's mind. She knew how it must have looked to the watching crowd - like she'd orchestrated the whole thing.

Her gaze flickered to Nathan, standing nearby. When their eyes met, her lips twisted into something bitter and knowing. "Three years ago, I was foolish enough to marry Mr. Blackwood. But I'm not that naive girl anymore." She squared her shoulders. "I'd seduce every man in this room before I'd ever look at Nathan Blackwood again."

Sophia recoiled slightly at the venom in Evelyn's words. This wasn't the meek, compliant woman she remembered. This Evelyn was someone entirely different - someone dangerous.

The sharp clink of Evelyn's wine glass being set down shattered the tense silence. Without another word, she turned on her heel and headed for the stairs, leaving the stunned crowd behind. Sebastian Hart shot Nathan and Sophia one last scathing look before following her.

Nathan stood frozen, his expression unreadable as he watched Evelyn walk away. Tristan Whitmore, sensing the need to diffuse the situation, quickly pulled Dominic Kingsley aside.

"Mr. Kingsley," Tristan said with forced cheerfulness, "about this three-way partnership - any chance we could expand it to four?"

Dominic adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "No."

Tristan sighed. "Couldn't you at least try to be diplomatic about it?"

"Apologies," Dominic replied smoothly. "But no."

By the time Tristan turned back, Nathan had disappeared. "Where'd he go?" Tristan muttered to himself. Dominic merely nodded toward the lower level before walking away.

Downstairs, the lounge was quieter, the tension from above not yet having filtered down. Sebastian hovered near Evelyn, his concern evident.

"Did Nathan do something to you?" he demanded. "Why was Sophia accusing you like that?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "It was nothing. Just a misunderstanding."

Sebastian clenched his fists. "If he hurt you, I swear—"

"Have you seen Alexander?" Evelyn interrupted, glancing around.

"He went to the VIP section with Chairman Kingsley," Sebastian said. "Want me to take you to him?"

Evelyn shook her head. Then she stiffened - Nathan was walking toward them.

"Not this again," she muttered under her breath. Without hesitation, she took Sebastian's arm and turned to leave.

"Evelyn." Nathan's voice was low, intense. "We need to talk."

She didn't even break stride. "There's nothing to discuss."

An apology? Now? After everything? Evelyn knew better than to think words could undo the past. Some wounds never healed, no matter how many empty phrases you stuffed into them.

She kept walking, leaving Nathan standing alone in the middle of the room. Some things, once broken, could never be fixed. And Evelyn Sinclair was done trying.
###Chapter 45

Sebastian Hart smirked as he glanced sideways at Nathan Blackwood. His lips curled into a smug, reckless grin that seemed to mock Nathan's current predicament.

"Look at him! Even the great Nathan Blackwood has his off days," Sebastian taunted under his breath.

Tristan Whitmore finally caught up with Nathan, following his gaze to Evelyn Sinclair's retreating figure. "Tsk tsk, Blackwood," Tristan clucked his tongue. "Since the divorce is finalized, no point regretting it now. That woman was just playing cheap tricks anyway."

Nathan shot him a sidelong glare that could freeze hell. "Since when do I need your advice on how to handle my affairs?"

A sudden chill ran down Tristan's spine, silencing him immediately.

The way Evelyn had humiliated Nathan in front of everyone still burned in Tristan's memory. If he felt this furious just witnessing it, he couldn't imagine how Nathan must feel. Sure, Sophia might have gone too far with her words, but hadn't Evelyn brought this upon herself by begging to marry Nathan in the first place?

When Evelyn first entered the grand hall, she'd been immediately surrounded by eager socialites and businessmen - some drawn by her position at Sterling Corporation, others simply hungry for tonight's drama.

Seeing this as the perfect opportunity to expand her network and gather insider information, Evelyn gracefully engaged with each guest. She clinked champagne flutes with practiced ease, taking only polite sips as she worked the room. Nobody dared pressure her to drink more.

Even with Sebastian intercepting several drinks on her behalf, Evelyn still felt lightheaded after the networking session. Seizing a quiet moment, she slipped away to the ladies' room. The cold water against her flushed skin helped clear the fog in her head. Just as she reached for a paper towel, Evelyn heard Sophia Blackwood's shrill voice approaching from the hallway.

"That bitch Evelyn won't get away with this! Humiliating our family like that!" Sophia's heels clicked angrily against the marble floor. "Did you see how she was practically throwing herself at every man in there? As if sleeping her way to the top makes her some kind of empowered woman? She should look in the mirror - she'll always be that pathetic gold-digger we kicked out!"

Sophia and her entourage froze when they entered to find Evelyn leaning casually against the sink, arms crossed, a frosty smile playing on her lips.

Sophia recovered quickly, her face twisting into its usual sneer. "Ugh, my luck just keeps getting worse. Can't even use the bathroom without running into trash."

Evelyn chuckled darkly. "The feeling's mutual, I assure you."

Sophia's perfectly plucked eyebrows shot up. "Who do you think you are to talk to me like that?"

Evelyn turned on the tap behind her with precise, fluid motion. The running water masked their conversation from potential eavesdroppers. "People might not know your true colors, Sophia, but do you really think you can rewrite history? You're still that spoiled brat who reeks of entitlement."

"You should be thanking your lucky stars I haven't exposed all your dirty little secrets," Evelyn continued, her voice glacial despite the deceptively soft curve of her lips. "Don't go looking for trouble you can't handle."

Sophia's face contorted with rage. "How dare you threaten me? I'm a Blackwood! You're nothing but discarded trash my brother threw away!"

Without Nathan present, Sophia's true colors shone bright. She'd always despised her sister-in-law, that ingrained sense of superiority boiling over now. How could this nobody Evelyn ever think she belonged in their world? What had she ever contributed to Nathan's career? What connections did her family offer?

For three years, Sophia had delighted in making Evelyn hand-wash her delicate garments, screaming when anything got "ruined." She'd refused to pour her own water, summoning Evelyn like a servant. If unsatisfied, she'd demand Evelyn redo everything.

Evelyn's silent endurance had only fed Sophia's cruelty, making her believe this treatment was justified - that Evelyn deserved to grovel.

Even after the divorce, Sophia remained convinced Evelyn would always be beneath her.

"Only in your delusional mind are the Blackwoods untouchable," Evelyn scoffed, her playful smile not reaching her cold eyes. "I'd love to know where you get that superiority complex."

Sophia barked a laugh. "Why didn't you say that when you were begging to marry my brother? Forgotten how desperate you were, Evelyn? Willing to be Vanessa's personal blood bank just to worm your way into our family? That's your glorious legacy!"

Evelyn's smile vanished, her expression turning dangerously calm.

"Not desperate, Sophia. Just blind." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "But if you want to revisit the past, I'll happily remind you of every detail."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "What could some broke nobody possibly have on me?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched toward her clutch. "Try me."

Sophia opened her mouth to retort when suddenly— "AHHH!" Her piercing scream echoed through the bathroom.
###Chapter 46

Sophia Blackwood's face froze in shock.

A sharp scream escaped her lips as icy water cascaded down her face and designer gown. The sudden chill made her entire body tremble violently.

Evelyn Sinclair casually placed the crystal decanter back on the marble countertop, brushing her hands together with deliberate slowness. Her piercing gaze never wavered as she delivered her warning. "You brought this upon yourself."

"How dare you, Evelyn!"

Sophia's face flushed crimson with rage. Her trembling fingers clutched at the ruined fabric of her Dior gown - not couture like Evelyn's custom ensemble, but still worth a staggering eight figures. A dress most celebrities could only dream of wearing, now completely destroyed.

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile. "Do you honestly believe I'll tolerate your nonsense like before?" Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Test me again, and I'll settle all our accounts - past and present."

A visible shudder ran through Sophia as she caught the glacial glint in Evelyn's eyes. For the first time, genuine fear prickled down her spine.

But pride quickly overrode fear. As the privileged Blackwood heiress accustomed to universal deference, being humiliated at this gala was unacceptable. Her spare dress couldn't compare to this ruined masterpiece.

Gritting her teeth, Sophia lunged forward with a raised hand. "You'll pay for this, Evelyn!"

The slap never landed. Evelyn moved with panther-like grace, effortlessly dodging while seizing Sophia's wrist. In one fluid motion, she tangled her free hand in Sophia's carefully styled waves and shoved her toward the overflowing golden sink.

Sophia's face plunged into the icy water as her entourage gasped in horror. One sharp glance from Evelyn silenced them instantly.

Though Sophia thrashed violently, Evelyn maintained perfect control. When the lesson had been sufficiently delivered, she released her grip and stepped back without a single drop marring her own impeccable appearance.

The contrast couldn't have been starker - Evelyn, radiant and composed; Sophia, dripping and disheveled like a drowned rat.

Gasping against the wall, Sophia stared at Evelyn with dawning realization. This wasn't the woman she thought she knew.

"Ms. Blackwood," Evelyn said coolly as Sophia's friend rushed to her side, "I warned you I wouldn't tolerate disrespect anymore." She tucked a stray lock behind her ear with deliberate elegance. "Consider this your final warning."

With one last contemptuous glance at the shivering Sophia, Evelyn turned on her designer heels and strode away, leaving only the echo of her confidence behind.

The moment Evelyn disappeared, Sophia's screams of frustration finally erupted.

Evelyn should have been savoring her victory. Instead, she froze mid-step when she saw Nathan Blackwood leaning against the corridor wall, watching her with an unreadable expression.

How long had he been standing there?

She considered pretending not to notice, but his deep voice stopped her. "Evelyn."

Nathan remained motionless, visibly uncomfortable yet resigned. He'd heard the altercation but hadn't intervened - not when his family owed her far greater reparations.

Evelyn turned slowly, arching one perfectly groomed eyebrow. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

Without waiting for his response, she added with mocking sweetness, "Oh, but you've come too early. Your sister isn't... presentable enough for company just yet."
###Chapter 47

Alexander Sterling's expression was grim, but his eyes softened when Evelyn Sinclair approached him.

Evelyn flashed him a tired smile before looping her arm through his. "Is this dreadful event over yet? Can we please leave? I'm absolutely exhausted."

Alexander affectionately tapped her nose. "Of course we can leave. These people don't deserve another moment of your time."

Her eyes crinkled with genuine affection. "You're still the best brother anyone could ask for."

"Do you need to say goodbye to anyone?"

"I made my polite exits hours ago," Alexander replied, smoothing her hair. "The car's waiting outside."

Evelyn nodded, clinging to her brother's arm as they exited the gala. The striking pair - the powerful businessman and his elegant sister - drew admiring glances from everyone they passed.

Just as they reached the entrance, Sebastian Hart hurried after them. "Mr. Sterling! Mind if I catch a ride with you two?"

Evelyn glanced at Alexander, whose face had instantly turned to ice. He was famously protective of his sister. "Actually, I do mind. It's completely out of our way."

Sebastian looked crestfallen. Evelyn gave him an apologetic wave. "See you around, Sebastian."

Knowing better than to push his luck with Alexander Sterling, Sebastian didn't dare insist. He could only watch miserably as the siblings climbed into their luxury vehicle.

Just as the door was about to close, Sebastian suddenly rushed forward in a panic and yanked it back open.

"What on earth—?" Evelyn gasped in surprise.

The commotion drew attention from nearby guests. With Alexander's status, any public scene was bound to become gossip fodder.

Sebastian dropped to one knee, carefully gathering the hem of Evelyn's dress that had gotten caught in the door. He tucked the delicate fabric safely inside the car before looking up at her with a charming grin. "There, now you're all set. Safe travels!"

The crowd murmured at the sight of the handsome young man performing such a chivalrous gesture for the Sterling heiress.

On the second-floor balcony overlooking the entrance, Tristan Whitmore nudged Nathan Blackwood with an amused smirk. "Looks like your wife's little admirer has quite the flair for dramatic gestures, doesn't he?"

Tristan clearly suspected there was more than friendship between Alexander and Evelyn.

Nathan's expression remained unreadable as he turned away from the scene. "Let's go find the others. I need a drink."
###Chapter 48

The soft strains of a violin concerto filled the luxurious car interior. Evelyn Sinclair absently traced the embroidery on her dress hem as the familiar melody of "Nocturne" washed over her.

Alexander Sterling glanced sideways at his sister. "Lil E, is Sebastian Hart pursuing you?" His sharp eyes had noticed the unusual attention from their family friend.

Evelyn's fingers stilled momentarily before she laughed it off. "Don't be ridiculous. He's just being playful. It'll pass soon enough."

Alexander turned his gaze forward, chuckling. "Good."

"You don't approve?" This surprised Evelyn. The Sterlings and Harts had maintained close ties for generations.

"He's had more girlfriends than I can count, and his personal life is... complicated." Alexander hesitated before adding, "Not that it matters if he makes you happy."

Evelyn shook her head in amusement. "What are you implying? He's practically family! Besides, romance isn't on my agenda right now. I'm focused on building my career."

Alexander visibly relaxed. "Exactly. Men are temporary. You can have your pick whenever you're ready."

Meanwhile at the Velvet Lounge...

Nathan Blackwood had already emptied three whiskey bottles by the time his friends arrived. Tristan Whitmore hovered nearby, torn between concern and resignation.

Gregory Thornton and the others exchanged shocked looks as they entered the private room. Nathan hadn't drowned himself in alcohol like this since Theodore Hart's funeral years ago.

"What's going on?" Gregory asked as they settled around the table. Nathan poured another glass without blinking, the amber liquid disappearing down his throat effortlessly.

"Sit," Nathan commanded, gesturing vaguely. When everyone had drinks, Gregory turned to Tristan. "What happened?"

Tristan pressed his lips together. What could it possibly be? That damned ex-wife of course - though he wisely kept this thought to himself.

Nathan tugged at his loosened collar, exposing his collarbone. "Three years of marriage," he slurred, "and I never properly introduced her to you all. Evelyn Sinclair. Do you even know her?"

The name had been circulating in their circles recently. Who hadn't heard of the Sterling heiress?

Gregory scoffed. "Blackwood, you're from different worlds. Divorce was inevitable. We should be celebrating!" Tristan's frantic eye signals went ignored.

"Exactly! She was never really one of us," another friend chimed in. "We never acknowledged her as our sister-in-law. Didn't she marry you for your money anyway? Classic gold digger - don't let it get to you."

Nathan's expression darkened. "A gold digger?" He laughed bitterly. "Then why did she return every cent I gave her? Why walk away empty-handed? My family treated her like dirt, yet she never complained. My friends ignored her, and she just... accepted it. What was her game?"

The alcohol burned his throat as Tristan recounted the evening's events. The others remained unmoved, refilling their glasses.

"You're too soft-hearted," Gregory declared. "Not your fault if she couldn't handle your family."

"Women create their own drama," another added. "If she had issues, she should've spoken up. Every family has conflicts."

"Enough," Nathan suddenly growled, slamming his glass down. "Tristan, you're usually full of ideas. Why so quiet tonight?" His drunken gaze sharpened. "Unless... you're worried she still has those photos of you?"

The room erupted in laughter as the alcohol flowed freely. In his haze, Nathan kept seeing Evelyn's disgusted expression when she'd last looked at him. If she wanted them to be strangers... should he grant that wish?
###Chapter 49

The shrill alarm of Evelyn Sinclair's phone shattered her peaceful slumber.

She had insisted on returning to her own penthouse last night. The quiet solitude felt infinitely better than waking up to an army of maids fussing over her.

Glancing at her phone, she saw the headlines already blowing up.

"Former Power Couple Rekindling Romance?"

Accompanying the article was a breathtaking shot of Nathan Blackwood dipping her during their dance, his lips brushing against hers under the golden chandelier lights. The photographer had captured it like some Renaissance painting—all dramatic shadows and stolen intimacy.

Evelyn scoffed and swiped the tab away, switching to her emails instead.

Bennett, ever efficient, had already sent her schedule for the day before dawn. She showered quickly, letting the morning finance reports play in the background.

Last night's chaos felt distant now. She refused to let Nathan Blackwood occupy her thoughts any longer.

Her phone buzzed relentlessly. Isabella Montgomery's name flashed across the screen.

"Tell me that photo is doctored," Isabella demanded the second Evelyn picked up. "Because if it's not, I need details. STAT."

Evelyn sighed, explaining the stupid dance in clipped sentences.

Isabella exhaled dramatically. "Thank god. I was about to have an aneurysm." She immediately launched into a colorful tirade about the Blackwoods, then abruptly gasped. "Wait—the article just disappeared!"

Evelyn checked. Sure enough, it had vanished.

"I didn't pay to take it down," Evelyn mused.

Isabella cackled. "Check the group chat. Sebastian Hart just dropped a million dollars on PR to scrub it!"

Evelyn opened their chat to chaos:

[Isabella Montgomery]: SEBASTIAN JUST BLEW A MILLION TO ERASE HIS NON-EXISTENCE FROM LAST NIGHT'S PARTY PHOTOS
[Natalie Beaumont]: If there was a shot of him, I wonder who'd pay MORE to delete it.
[Isabella Montgomery]: DYING. SOMEONE CHECK ON HIM.

Evelyn smirked and typed:
[Evelyn Sinclair]: Next time, transfer the money to me directly. I'll personally issue a statement denying you.

Sebastian's reply was instantaneous:
[Sebastian Hart]: sobs dramatically I'm bleeding from my eyes.

By 7 AM, Bennett arrived with breakfast. "Grabbed this on the way. Hope it's alright."

Evelyn took the bag. "Thanks. Let's go."

"The 8 AM meeting is confirmed. President Sterling said you have full autonomy on the Kingsley Tech deal. No oversight."

Evelyn nodded. Alexander was testing her capabilities, and she wouldn't disappoint. "Did you schedule our preliminary inspection?"

"Kensington Group's team is visiting next week, so I booked ours for tomorrow morning."

"Good."

She flipped through the files in the car. The last thing she wanted was to run into Nathan's people. Even if he wasn't personally involved, she wouldn't risk it.

At Sterling Corp, the receptionist intercepted her with a massive bouquet. "Vice President Sinclair, these just arrived for you."

Evelyn eyed the card:
Dearest Evelyn,
My love for you spans galaxies.
Yours eternally,
Sebastian Hart

She resisted the urge to gag. "Throw these out, please."

Then she paused. "Actually, reject any future deliveries from him. Immediately."

The receptionist looked mournfully at the doomed flowers. "Yes, ma'am."

The conference room was packed by 8 AM sharp. Evelyn took her seat at the head of the table.

"Our collaboration with Kingsley Tech is underway. Bennett will distribute the project team assignments shortly."

Everyone leaned forward eagerly. This venture into AI technology was career-making.

After the meeting, Olivia Kensington cornered her.

"Vice President Sinclair, why wasn't I assigned to the core team?"

Evelyn didn't glance up from her tablet. "If I entertained every employee who asked that, I'd need a stadium. Would you like me to start charging for the privilege?"
###Chapter 50

Evelyn Sinclair despised Olivia Kensington, but she couldn’t afford an outright confrontation.

Olivia held leverage over her.

"My leadership experience is just as extensive as anyone on that list, and my performance ranks among the top senior managers." Evelyn crossed her arms, her tone edged with thinly veiled irritation. "Vice President Olivia, are you still holding a grudge over what happened last time?"

Olivia lowered her gaze, a smirk playing on her lips. "I don’t hold grudges, Evelyn. But I do recall you were vehemently against partnering with Kingsley Tech before this." She leaned back in her chair. "I just worry your personal bias might interfere with the collaboration."

Evelyn forced a tight smile. "I fully support the company’s decision now."

Olivia gave her a dismissive nod. "The list was finalized at the board meeting. There’s no changing it now. Maybe next time."

She began organizing the files on her desk—a clear dismissal.

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. "I’m sure exceptions can be made. Just wait and see, Vice President Olivia."

With that, she spun on her heel and strode out, confidence radiating from her every step.

Olivia watched her go, a slow, calculating smile curving her lips.

Perfect. She took the bait.

That afternoon, Bennett buzzed Evelyn’s office. "Victor Kensington wants to see you in his office."

Evelyn arched a brow. "The soon-to-retire board member? Interesting."

Aside from Alexander Sterling and Bennett, no one at Sterling Corp knew Evelyn’s true identity. As the newly appointed Vice President, she was curious what Victor wanted.

Victor had a reputation for insider trading. He’d wormed his way onto the board through dubious means and clung to his position like a leech. But with minimal shares and no real influence, he was more of a nuisance than a threat.

Evelyn knocked on his office door.

"Come in," came a weary voice.

She stepped inside, her smile polished and professional. "You wanted to see me, Mr. Kensington?"

Victor’s eyes flickered with something—interest, regret—before his expression settled into a practiced neutrality. "Sit."

She took the seat across from him.

Victor cleared his throat. "You’re quite striking, Ms. Sinclair. No wonder Alexander pushed so hard for your promotion despite the objections."

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver. So he resents Alexander’s influence.

She remained silent, letting him fill the uncomfortable quiet.

Victor’s lips thinned. "Did you know your position was originally meant for Olivia Kensington?"

Is he trying to intimidate me?

Evelyn tilted her head. "Olivia is competent, but I’m the better fit for this role."

Victor’s face darkened. "Arrogance and disrespect won’t get you far in this company, girl."

She stood, smoothing her blazer. "Then I’ll let my results speak for themselves. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave."

"Evelyn!" Victor snapped, frustration bleeding into his tone. "Add Olivia Kensington to the Kingsley Tech project team."

Her smile widened. So Olivia’s backer is this pathetic old man? Did she really think he’d scare me?

Victor scowled at her silence. "Did you hear me?"

"I did."

"Then make it happen."

Evelyn met his glare without flinching. "I can’t. It wouldn’t be fair to the others."

Victor’s face purpled. "Do you think Alexander’s protection makes you untouchable? I could—"

"Fire me?" Evelyn cut in, amused. "I doubt the board would remove me over Olivia Kensington. But I suppose she didn’t tell you what I have on her when she came crying to you." She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "Tell her to stay out of my way."

Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked out, leaving Victor gaping behind her.

The moment she was clear of his office, she dialed Alexander’s private line.

"What’s wrong, Evie?"

"Victor Kensington is dirty. Olivia’s his puppet. He’s the one who tried to block the Kingsley Tech deal from the start."

Alexander chuckled. "Sharp as ever."

"You already knew?"

"Of course. Did you think I’d miss dissent in my own boardroom?"

Evelyn exhaled. "Good. That old fox isn’t worth my time."

"Leave him to me. Focus on Kingsley Tech." A pause. "Oh, and Nathan Blackwood is taking personal charge of this project."

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone.

Interesting.
###Chapter 51

Evelyn Sinclair's mood darkened the moment she discovered Nathan Blackwood would be personally overseeing this project. The last thing she wanted was to interact with that man, yet fate seemed determined to throw them together during this collaboration.

How utterly frustrating.

The following morning, Evelyn arrived at Kingsley Tech with her team. Dominic Kingsley greeted them warmly, offering to escort them straight to the research lab. Witnessing the cutting-edge experiments and breakthroughs firsthand would give Sterling Corporation's representatives a genuine understanding of their progress.

As they walked, Evelyn and Dominic exchanged pleasantries. Just before they reached the lab entrance, something small and unexpected darted toward them. A startled voice from behind cried out, "Watch out!"

Evelyn glanced down—and froze.

A plump, striped tiger cub, no larger than her ankle, wobbled toward her. Its ears were perked, whiskers twitching, and its round, golden eyes sparkled with mischief. Far from intimidating, it looked like an overgrown, cuddly house cat.

The entire group gasped. Evelyn's pulse skipped as she instinctively stepped back.

But the little tiger misjudged its speed and collided with her shoe, tumbling onto the floor with a dramatic "Oof!" It scrambled up clumsily, rubbing its head against her foot as if apologizing. Then it peered up at her, blinking innocently.

Evelyn's heart melted.

It acted like a spoiled, lazy cub, utterly fascinated by everything around it. She had the sudden, irrational urge to scoop it up and take it home.

The tiger stretched out a tiny paw and patted the spot on her shoe it had bumped, as if dusting off invisible dirt.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, rubbing her eyes.

"Pretty lady!"

Her breath hitched.

The tiger had spoken—in the high-pitched, cheerful voice of a toddler.

Her eyes widened. Did it just—?

No, wait. Why was there a tiger here? Endangered animals didn’t just wander corporate hallways!

Dominic chuckled. "Apologies for the scare." He glanced down at the cub, his tone gentle but firm. "You should apologize too."

The tiger nuzzled Evelyn’s ankle again, its voice dripping with exaggerated remorse. "So sorry! I look scary, but I’m really nice!"

The words flowed so naturally, so human, that if it hadn’t spoken, Evelyn would’ve sworn it was real.

The team stared, stunned.

Evelyn crouched, mesmerized by the cub’s gleaming eyes—so lifelike they shifted with the light. Only the faintest infrared glow in its pupils betrayed its artificial nature.

"This is our experimental team’s latest prototype," Dominic explained. "A companion AI designed for emotional support. It usually stays in the lab, but someone must’ve left the door open." He sighed. "Little troublemaker."

"Is this part of our project?" Evelyn asked, excitement bubbling.

Dominic hesitated. "Not yet. It’s still in development—too many variables to mass-produce."

"But it’s adorable!" a colleague gushed. "I’d buy one in a heartbeat!"

"At the cost of ten Manhattan penthouses, maybe," Dominic said wryly. "The materials alone are astronomically expensive."

The group groaned in collective disappointment.

Evelyn sighed, giving the cub one last longing look—until it suddenly flopped onto its back, paws waving. "Pretty lady, hug me!"

She laughed, glancing at Dominic for permission. He rolled his eyes but nodded.

Carefully, she scooped it up.

The cub was light, fluffy, and warm, nestling into her arms like it belonged there. It even purred, nuzzling her chest with a blissful expression.

"You’re too cute," Evelyn murmured.

"I know!" it chirped, preening.

A female colleague leaned in. "Are all tigers this cuddly?"

The cub’s eyes gleamed. "Would you like to switch modes? Fierce tiger mode—yes or no?"

"Yes!"

It twisted its head, scrunched its face, and—

"Rrrowr?"

Silence.

"Rrrowr! Rrrowr!"

The group burst into laughter.

"That’s not fierce—that’s adorable!"

Dominic smirked. "Its IQ is higher than you think. It’s messing with you."

The cub grinned, rolling onto its back in Evelyn’s arms. "Everyone loves me!"

The team’s shock melted into awe—then envy as they eyed the priceless tech in Evelyn’s grasp.

Dominic finally ushered them into the lab, where Kingsley Tech’s innovations left Evelyn breathless. Autonomous vehicles, medical bots, smart homes—their AI advancements were revolutionary.

She knew then: partnering with them was the right choice.

While the team explored, Dominic guided Evelyn to a secluded oval office. Staff members stood respectfully as they entered.

Then a side door opened.

A man stepped inside.

A technician gestured. "Begin undressing."
###Chapter 52

The model stood ready, removing his shirt with practiced ease. His expression remained impassive as he bared his sculpted torso, positioning himself according to the scanning protocol.

Evelyn Sinclair was the sole female observer in the room. Her breath hitched at the unexpected display, cheeks flushing crimson. She immediately averted her gaze toward Dominic Kingsley.

"What exactly is happening here?" she demanded through clenched teeth.

Dominic adjusted his glasses with a professional smile. "We're compiling anatomical references for our next generation of AI companions. Different body types for different preferences."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. She bit her lower lip, thinking, This job just keeps getting more interesting.

A harried assistant rushed in, whispering urgently in Dominic's ear. His expression turned grave as he addressed Evelyn.

"Vice President Sinclair, would you mind overseeing the remaining sessions? I need to take these gentlemen for additional testing."

Before she could protest, the entire team filed out, leaving Evelyn alone with the AI tiger Leo cradled in her arms.

She stroked Leo's synthetic fur absently. "Guess we're running the show now."

The next participant entered before she could reconsider. Keeping her eyes fixed on the biometric display screen, Evelyn adopted the detached tone she'd heard the technicians use earlier.

"Please disrobe for scanning. Standard procedure."

When no movement followed, she frowned. "There's nothing to be embarrassed about. This will only take a moment."

Still no response.

Exasperated, Evelyn finally looked up—and froze.

Nathan Blackwood's obsidian eyes bored into hers, his glacial stare sending shivers down her spine.

Her professional mask slipped for only a heartbeat before she recovered. "Blackwood Industries wasn't scheduled until Thursday. To what do we owe this... unexpected visit?"

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Dominic chose that moment to return, his cheerful demeanor faltering at the charged atmosphere. "Ah! Vice President Sinclair, I neglected to mention Mr. Blackwood's early arrival for the—" He glanced between them. "Oh. You've... met."

Nathan's voice dripped with icy amusement. "Care to explain why your vice president was instructing me to undress?"

Dominic chuckled nervously. "Standard biometric scanning! With your exceptional physique, Mr. Blackwood, you'd make an excellent reference model." He turned to Evelyn with a conspiratorial wink. "Wouldn't you agree, Vice President?"

Evelyn rose abruptly. "Not interested."

As she turned to leave, Leo suddenly squirmed free and bounded toward Nathan. The mechanical tiger rubbed against Nathan's polished Oxfords, tiny paws batting at his trousers while emitting plaintive whimpers.

"Papa! Carry me!"

Evelyn whirled around in shock. Nathan's expression darkened as he grabbed Leo by the scruff, holding the struggling feline at arm's length.

"Release me this instant! This is undignified!" Leo protested, limbs flailing.

Nathan sighed with the weary familiarity of someone who'd endured this routine before, tucking the squirming tiger under one arm. His gaze lifted to meet Evelyn's, but she'd already schooled her features into icy disdain.

With a contemptuous sniff at the traitorous AI, Evelyn strode out without a backward glance.

Dominic observed Nathan's thunderous expression and couldn't resist a quiet chuckle. "She was doting on that creature all morning. The moment you touched it? Couldn't get away fast enough."

Nathan's glare silenced further commentary.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had barely exited the building when her phone buzzed with a message from Isabella Montgomery, summoning her to lunch at a nearby bistro.

Still rattled from the encounter, Evelyn welcomed the distraction. After informing Bennett of her plans, she headed to meet her best friend.

Isabella had secured reservations at an exclusive new fusion restaurant. Over an extravagant spread, their conversation flowed easily—until Isabella suddenly burst into laughter.

"You have to see this!" she gasped, thrusting her phone at Evelyn.

The screen displayed Tristan Whitmore's latest social media post—a doctored photo of Evelyn and Nathan dancing, with Tristan's face crudely superimposed over Nathan's. The caption read: Now this is more like it!

Evelyn rolled her eyes—until she noticed Nathan's unexpected comment beneath the post.

Evelyn had blocked Nathan completely months ago, severing all ties with her ex-husband. Seeing his name pop up in the comments section was the last thing she expected.

The fashion world truly was a small circle.

Nathan's comment read: [Counterfeit.]

Though the remark itself caused no real damage, its intention was clearly to provoke.

Sebastian Hart immediately fired back with a dozen furious replies, cursing Nathan Blackwood to hell and back. But Nathan remained silent after that single jab - the battle was over before it truly began.

Evelyn rolled her eyes in exasperation. "Doesn't he have anything better to do with his time?"

Isabella Montgomery smirked knowingly. "He's obviously still obsessed with you. The whole world can see it. Why not give him a chance? Wouldn't it be delicious to use this opportunity to drive Nathan absolutely insane?"

"I don't date my closest friends," Evelyn said firmly, her brow furrowing. "If I had any romantic interest in Sebastian, I would have made a move years ago. Stop putting nonsense ideas in my head."

Her mind wandered to how she should handle this awkward situation with Sebastian.

"Forget about men," Isabella said brightly, changing the subject. "I've had my eye on a new necklace. Want to come check it out with me?"

Girl talk always lifted Evelyn's spirits. She nodded, craving some retail therapy after the online drama. The two women left the restaurant and headed straight for an exclusive jewelry boutique.

Isabella had reserved this particular piece weeks in advance. When the sales associate brought it out, Evelyn gasped - it was breathtaking.

"This necklace is the final masterpiece from renowned designer Laurent Dubois," the associate gushed, recognizing the two impeccably dressed women as high-value clients. "You ladies have exquisite taste. Would you like to try it on?"

Isabella nodded and handed it to Evelyn. "Go ahead."

The two were like sisters who shared everything. Though Evelyn owned enough jewelry to fill a vault - thanks to her brothers' extravagant gifts for every occasion - there was still joy in trying on beautiful pieces.

Just as Evelyn lifted the necklace, a familiar venomous voice cut through the air.

"Let her try it on? Can she even afford it?" The sneer came from Sophia Blackwood, who had entered with her usual entourage. "You shouldn't let just anyone handle your merchandise. Who knows what cheap perfume she's wearing that might tarnish the piece?"

The lingering scent of their earlier barbecue lunch clung to their clothes, giving Sophia ammunition. Still seething from her last humiliating encounter with Evelyn, she couldn't resist attacking.

Isabella's face darkened. "Mind your own business."

Sophia strutted forward arrogantly. "I want this necklace! Don't let her touch it - I don't want it contaminated." She glared at Isabella before smirking at Evelyn. "How much allowance did your sugar daddy give you today? Probably not enough for this. Save your pennies, darling. I'll take it."

Evelyn calmly addressed the associate, "Please wrap this up for me," as she set the necklace down. Her icy gaze locked onto Sophia, carrying a silent warning that made the other woman flinch momentarily.

But surrounded by her friends and the store's security, Sophia quickly regained her bravado. "I said that necklace is mine," she insisted petulantly, determined to deny Evelyn this small pleasure.

The associate hesitated. "I'm sorry, but these ladies were here first—"

"What did you just say?" Sophia shrieked. "I'm a VIP client! I get priority on whatever I want!" She shot Evelyn a triumphant look. Store policy did give preferential treatment to top-tier customers.

The associate gave Evelyn and Isabella an apologetic look and reached for the necklace—until Evelyn's hand gently stopped her.

A slow, dangerous smile curved Evelyn's lips as she withdrew a gleaming black titanium card from her wallet. The associate's eyes widened in recognition - this was the ultra-exclusive Centurion card, rumored to have no spending limit.

The atmosphere in the boutique shifted instantly. Sophia's smug expression faltered as Evelyn's quiet power filled the space. This wasn't just about a necklace anymore - it was about dominance, pride, and settling old scores.

Evelyn's fingers tapped the counter once, decisively. "Ring it up."

The security presence was obvious. Evelyn Sinclair wouldn't dare cause a scene with so many guards watching.

"I'll be taking this one," Sophia Blackwood declared sharply. She wouldn't back down, not when it came to standing her ground against Evelyn.

The boutique assistant hesitated, wringing her hands. "I'm sorry, but these ladies were here first..."

"What did you just say?" Sophia's voice turned icy. "As a VIP client, I'm entitled to first choice on any item in this store!"

She shot Evelyn and Isabella Montgomery a triumphant look. The store policy clearly stated priority access for top-tier customers.

The flustered assistant cast apologetic glances at the other women as she reached for the dress. Just as her fingers brushed the fabric, Evelyn's hand came down gently but firmly on the garment.

A knowing smile played at Evelyn's lips as she withdrew something from her purse - a gleaming platinum card with distinctive black engraving.

The assistant's eyes widened in recognition. This wasn't just any VIP card - it was the exclusive Blackwood family insignia, granting unlimited purchasing privileges.

Sophia's smug expression faltered as Evelyn placed the card on the counter with deliberate calm. The air between them crackled with unspoken challenge.

"Now," Evelyn said smoothly, her voice carrying quiet authority, "shall we discuss who truly has priority here?"

Isabella bit back a grin as she watched the color drain from Sophia's face. The game had just taken an unexpected turn.

The boutique's security detail stood nearby, making Sophia Blackwood hesitate to cause a scene.

"I'll be taking this dress," Evelyn Sinclair declared firmly. She wouldn't let Sophia have her way this time.

The sales associate hesitated. "I'm sorry, but these ladies were here first—"

"What did you just say?" Sophia's voice turned shrill. "As a VIP client, I deserve priority service! Anything I want should be mine!"

A smug smile played on Evelyn's lips as she watched Sophia's tantrum.

The boutique's policy clearly stated VIP customers received first pick privileges.

The flustered associate glanced apologetically between Isabella Montgomery and Evelyn before reaching for the dress.

Evelyn's manicured hand stopped her.

With deliberate grace, Evelyn produced a matte black card from her Chanel clutch. The edges gleamed with platinum trim, bearing an embossed constellation pattern.

This was the legendary Celestial Card - rumored to be held by fewer than a dozen individuals worldwide. Even European royalty had been denied this exclusive membership.

The associate's eyes widened. "M-Madam Sinclair! Let me package this immediately for you!"

All thoughts of Sophia vanished as the staff sprang into action.

Sophia's jaw dropped. "That...that has to be counterfeit!" she sputtered. "Don't be fooled by her tricks!"

Though Sophia had never held one, she recognized it instantly from society tabloids. The leaked photos of this mythical card were seared into every socialite's memory.

Yet here it was - in Evelyn Sinclair's perfectly manicured hand.

How? Why? The questions burned through Sophia's mind. What gave this woman the right to possess such status?

The store manager materialized, ushering other customers toward the exit. "We must ask you to leave immediately. The boutique will be closing for a private shopping experience."

Evelyn's laughter rang like crystal.

Isabella smirked. "Yes, do remove that eyesore quickly." She gestured dismissively at the fuming Sophia.

The boutique staff moved with military precision, transforming the space into Evelyn's personal showroom within minutes. Sophia stood frozen, her face flushing crimson with humiliation.

Evelyn casually examined her reflection, adjusting the diamond bracelet on her wrist. "Darling," she addressed the manager without looking up, "have my usual selections brought out. And do ensure certain...unwanted elements don't disrupt my shopping again."

The unspoken command hung in the air as Sophia found herself escorted firmly toward the exit by two security guards. The heavy doors clicked shut behind her with finality.
###Chapter 53 Mind Your Business!

Evelyn had blocked Nathan everywhere, yet his name appeared under Sebastian's post.

Nathan's comment: [Cheap knockoff.]

Sebastian retaliated with a dozen insults, but Nathan didn't respond.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Doesn't Sebastian have better things to do?"

Isabella teased, "He's clearly into you. Why not date him to annoy Nathan?"

"I don't mix friendship with romance," Evelyn said firmly. "Now, about that necklace you wanted to see?"

At the jewelry boutique, the attendant presented Isabella's reserved piece - Laurent Dubois' final masterpiece.

"Would you like to try it?" the attendant asked eagerly.

Isabella handed it to Evelyn. "Your turn first."

As Evelyn reached for it, a shrill voice interrupted.

"Can trash like her even afford that? Her peasant stench will ruin the jewelry!" Sophia Blackwood sneered with her entourage.

Isabella glared. "Mind your business!"

Sophia snatched the necklace. "I'm taking this! VIPs get priority!"

The attendant hesitated until Evelyn produced a legendary black-gold card - the ultimate status symbol in luxury circles.

Sophia's jaw dropped. "That's fake!"

The manager immediately cleared the store. "Exclusive service for Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn smirked as Isabella added, "Finally, some fresh air without that skank."

Sophia stood fuming, humiliated yet again by the woman she couldn't touch.
###Chapter 54

Sophia Blackwood stormed out of the jewelry store, her face burning with humiliation. Isabella Montgomery snatched the black card from the counter and examined it with wide eyes. "How on earth did you get this?" she gasped.

Evelyn Sinclair smiled faintly. "Lucas gave it to me for my eighteenth birthday. Told me to keep it on me at all times. Never thought I'd actually use it."

"Why doesn't my brother give me things like this?" Isabella groaned, clutching her head in exaggerated envy.

Evelyn laughed and held the card out to her. "If you love it that much, take it."

"No way!" Isabella pushed it back. "These things are non-transferable. But you can buy me something nice with it."

Evelyn nodded in agreement, amused.

After purchasing a stunning new necklace, Isabella dragged Evelyn around the mall for another hour before they finally left.

Back at the office, Evelyn was in high spirits. Olivia Kensington had been making petty moves all day, but Evelyn paid her no mind. She knew Olivia’s schemes wouldn’t escape Alexander Sterling’s notice. If Olivia wanted to dig her own grave, Evelyn wasn’t about to stop her.

As she packed up to leave, her phone buzzed. Natalie Beaumont’s name flashed on the screen.

"Emergency!" Natalie blurted the second Evelyn answered. "There’s a charity gala tonight, and my artist, Adrian Prescott, needs a plus-one. I’m out of the country—can you step in?"

Evelyn checked her watch. "Fine. I’ve got nothing else planned."

"Love you! He’ll bring a dress. Be there soon."

The call ended, and Evelyn arched a brow. "How does Natalie always know I’ll say yes?"

She texted Bennett about the last-minute change and headed downstairs to wait. Adrian was a well-known model, and if anyone from the company spotted them together, the gossip would be relentless. Best to avoid unnecessary drama.

Less than ten minutes later, a sleek sports car screeched to a halt in front of the building. Evelyn nearly groaned when Adrian rolled down the window, waving dramatically. She hurried inside, but not before he blew a kiss to the gathering crowd.

Tomorrow’s headlines are going to be a nightmare.

Adrian grinned as they pulled away. "Ms. Sinclair, we haven’t met, but I’ve heard so much about you. Thanks for saving me tonight."

Evelyn offered a tight smile. "I’m doing this for Natalie. Not you."

His grin widened. "No wonder she was so confident you’d agree. You two must be close."

"Very."

Adrian, sensing her disinterest, wisely stayed quiet the rest of the ride.

They arrived early, and Evelyn changed into the emerald gown Adrian had brought while he waited outside. The charity gala was an exclusive event, filled with celebrities and high-profile figures. The moment they stepped inside, Evelyn spotted Margaret and Sophia Blackwood near the entrance.

Her lips curved. If they’re here, Nathan can’t be far.

The auction was the main event. Evelyn had no intention of bidding—until the final item appeared on screen.

An antique emerald-encrusted tobacco pipe.

Her breath caught.

She’d seen it before—in the Blackwood family memorial hall. It was Old Master Blackwood’s most prized heirloom, something he guarded fiercely.

How the hell did it end up here?

Her gaze flicked to Margaret and Sophia, who stood smugly at the front, basking in the attention.

Then it clicked.

They stole it.

The auctioneer announced, "This exquisite piece has been generously donated by Mrs. Blackwood and Ms. Blackwood of Blackwood Corporation. Bidding starts at three million dollars."

Three million? Evelyn nearly laughed. That’s it?

Margaret raised her paddle. "Three million!"

"Four million," someone countered.

Evelyn waited, letting the bids climb. Then, without hesitation, she lifted her paddle.

"Ten million."
###Chapter 55

The grand ballroom erupted in murmurs as all eyes locked onto Evelyn Sinclair.

Adrian Prescott studied her with a puzzled expression. "Why would you want that?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a mysterious smile. "It's quite exquisite, don't you think?"

"Hardly." Adrian scoffed. "It's just an ordinary jade pipe. What's so special about it?"

Evelyn felt the piercing gazes of Margaret and Sophia Blackwood. She met their stares head-on, her smile never faltering.

The Blackwood women visibly tensed. They knew Evelyn recognized this heirloom.

Years ago, Margaret had ordered Evelyn to clean the family memorial alone at night. She'd deliberately placed the precious pipe on a high shelf, hoping Evelyn would knock it over. One shattered heirloom would have been enough to banish Evelyn from the Blackwood family forever.

But Evelyn had been too clever to fall for the trap. Only the memorial's surveillance cameras had prevented Margaret from breaking it herself and framing Evelyn. Old Master Blackwood treasured this pipe more than life itself.

Now history repeated itself.

The Blackwood women had stolen the heirloom for tonight's auction. Sophia's reputation lay in tatters after Evelyn exposed her gambling with the Daydream necklace. Since returning from abroad, Sophia had suffered humiliation after humiliation, nearly becoming a social pariah.

This charity auction was Sophia's chance to reclaim her position as high society's darling. What better way than donating a priceless family heirloom?

Their plan seemed foolproof. Those who recognized the pipe wouldn't dare bid against the Blackwoods. Those who didn't recognize it wouldn't care. Sophia would dramatically "rescue" the family treasure, cementing her status.

They never anticipated Evelyn's appearance.

"Ten million, going once!" The auctioneer's voice rang out.

Sophia tugged Margaret's sleeve urgently. Margaret shot Evelyn a venomous glare before raising her paddle. "Eleven million."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Interesting. She'd assumed their limit was ten. "Twelve million."

Her phone vibrated with a call from an unknown number. Evelyn didn't need caller ID to know it was Sophia. She declined the call and blocked the number without hesitation.

"Thirteen million." Margaret's voice wavered slightly.

The auctioneer sensed the tension. "Thirteen million to Mrs. Blackwood. Any further bids?"

Silence stretched. "Thirteen million, going once! Going twice—"

"Fifteen million." Evelyn's interruption sent shockwaves through the crowd.

Margaret and Sophia exchanged frantic whispers. Sophia's face hardened with determination. "Twenty million!"

Evelyn smirked. Did they think that would intimidate her?

Adrian leaned close. "Need assistance?"

"Hardly." Evelyn raised her paddle again. "Thirty million."

Gasps filled the room. Evelyn had grown tired of toying with them. Time to end this.

The spotlight illuminated the Blackwoods' ashen faces.

"Thirty million, going once! Going twice! Sold to the lady in blue!" The auctioneer beamed. "All proceeds benefit Hope Academy!"

Thunderous applause broke the tension. Evelyn graciously acknowledged the crowd before locking eyes with her rivals. "What a delightful evening."

As expected, Margaret and Sophia waited backstage, their expressions stormy. The real confrontation was just beginning.
###Chapter 56

The attendant gracefully placed the exquisite emerald pipe before Evelyn Sinclair.

Her slender fingers traced the intricate carvings as she examined it closely. A faint crimson mark at the base confirmed its authenticity.

"So this is the real thing," Evelyn mused silently.

"Thank you," she said politely to the attendant, deliberately ignoring the two women hovering nearby.

Sophia Blackwood couldn't contain her irritation any longer. "Evelyn! Are you blind? Where are your manners when greeting your elders?" Her voice dripped with contempt.

Evelyn's lips curved into a mocking smile. Memories flooded back of how Margaret Blackwood had treated her during her marriage to Nathan - like a servant rather than a daughter-in-law.

"Oh, Mrs. Blackwood," Evelyn feigned surprise, "what an unexpected... pleasure." Her words were laced with enough sarcasm to make Margaret's face flush crimson.

"You think having powerful friends means you can disrespect me?" Margaret spat. "I'm still your mother-in-law!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Senile already? I divorced your precious son years ago. Find someone else to bully."

"How dare you!" Sophia finally found her voice, though she instinctively stepped behind her mother for protection. The air grew thick with tension.

Evelyn's smile vanished as her icy gaze pinned Sophia in place. "Are you giving me orders now?" The younger woman immediately shrank back, trembling.

The Blackwood women had come with a plan - humble Evelyn, then sweet-talk her into surrendering the heirloom. But Evelyn wasn't playing their game.

Only the presence of auction staff prevented Margaret from screaming obscenities. Instead, she forced a strained smile. "Evelyn, I'll give you thirty million for that pipe."

Evelyn paused, then chuckled. "If you had that money, you should've bid properly. Too late now." She signed the paperwork with a flourish. "It's mine."

"I've contacted Nathan," Margaret blurted desperately. "He's on his way."

Evelyn didn't even blink. "His presence changes nothing." She withdrew a platinum card from her clutch. "Process the payment."

The attendant accepted it with both hands while the Blackwoods gaped in horror. Sophia frantically texted someone - likely Nathan.

"Wasting your time," Evelyn murmured, watching the transaction complete. She could spend triple this amount without batting an eye.

Margaret switched tactics, her voice suddenly trembling. "That pipe is the old man's lifeline! He'll die without it! Have you no heart?"

Evelyn's laugh was cold. "You put it up for auction, not me. If anyone's killing him, it's you." She accepted the receipt. "The deal is done."

As the staff handed her the authenticated documents, the door burst open violently.
###Chapter 57

The moment Evelyn Sinclair spotted the approaching figure, her emerald eyes flashed with fiery intensity. She strode forward with purpose, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"Nathan," she said through gritted teeth, "Your mother stole my grandfather's antique jade pipe!"

Sophia Blackwood clutched her mother's arm in panic. "It's the family heirloom! When Grandfather finds out it's missing—"

Nathan Blackwood stood framed in the doorway, his towering silhouette cutting an imposing figure. The dim lighting cast shadows across his chiseled features as his icy gaze swept over the room.

"Enough!" His voice cracked like a whip. "You dare steal from your own family?"

Margaret Blackwood trembled and ducked behind her daughter, shrinking under her son's withering glare. Behind Nathan, the event coordinator stood frozen, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Are the transfer documents finalized?" the coordinator whispered to his assistant.

"Everything's been processed, sir," came the hushed reply.

Evelyn felt the weight of the jade pipe in her clutch. With legal ownership secured, she held all the power now. She turned to Adrian Prescott beside her. "Let's go. We wouldn't want to interrupt this touching family reunion."

Without sparing them another glance, she pivoted on her stiletto heel.

"Evelyn." Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous octave. "You're not leaving with that."

Margaret suddenly found her courage. "You can't let her take it!" she shrieked, emboldened by her son's presence.

Evelyn's lips curled into a smirk as she brandished the legal documents. "I believe this says otherwise." She deliberately let her gaze linger on Nathan's stormy expression, savoring his frustration. "Perhaps you should focus on explaining to your grandfather how his precious heirloom ended up at a charity auction. I wonder what he'll do when he learns it now belongs to me?"

Margaret's face drained of color. The thought of the Blackwood patriarch's wrath made her knees buckle. This scandal could get her banished from the family entirely!

Nathan's jaw tightened, the air around him turning arctic. "Name your price."

Evelyn's musical laughter filled the tense space. "Darling, do I look like I need your money?" She dangled the jade pipe tauntingly. "You want this back? In your dreams."

With that final jab, she swept out of the room, Adrian scrambling to keep pace.

Margaret clawed at Nathan's arm. "You can't just let her walk away! We have to—"

Nathan cut her off with a glacial stare. "I'll handle it. You two should worry about explaining this to Grandfather." Adjusting his cufflinks, he turned on his heel.

The old man likely already knew his treasure was missing. Nathan had no intention of shielding them from the consequences of their actions.

Margaret's eyes rolled back as she collapsed into her daughter's arms. Sophia's frantic cries for help went unanswered as Nathan disappeared down the hall.

Outside, the auction staff offered Evelyn security escorts for her valuable acquisition, but she declined with polite indifference. The pipe itself meant nothing—only the satisfaction of watching the Blackwood women squirm.

The elevator doors slid open. "Isn't that Mr. Blackwood?" Adrian murmured as Nathan's unmistakable frame approached.

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the buttons. Not a chance in hell she'd share an elevator with that man. She stabbed the 'close' button with determination.
###Chapter 58

Evelyn Sinclair barely glanced at the man outside the elevator, treating him like a complete stranger. The steel doors slid shut, cutting off her view of him completely.

Inside Adrian Prescott's sleek sports car, he finally voiced the question burning in his mind. "This artifact must be incredibly valuable. Why are the Blackwoods so desperate to get it back?"

Evelyn chuckled, turning the ornate box in her hands. "It's over a millennium old. Rumor has it this came from a royal treasury and has been in the Blackwood family for nearly eight centuries. What do you think?"

Adrian nearly swerved as the realization hit him. "That's practically priceless! They actually auctioned this? No wonder Nathan Blackwood told you to name your price. You could ask for nine figures and he wouldn't blink!"

The ringing of Evelyn's phone cut through the moment. Seeing Alexander Sterling's name flash on the screen, she answered with a smile. "Brother, I just acquired a little... keepsake."

There was a pause before Alexander's amused voice came through. "I heard. Only you would spend that much just to spite the Blackwoods."

Evelyn couldn't suppress her grin, imagining Sophia and Margaret Blackwood's reactions. "Well, it's mine now. And I have no intention of letting it go."

Alexander knew his sister too well. Her recent disappointments with the Blackwood family had left her looking for any opportunity to retaliate. If this made her happy, he wouldn't interfere.

The next morning dawned bright and clear. Evelyn arrived at Sterling Corp to handle some pressing matters. Olivia Kensington had been shooting daggers at her lately, but didn't dare make a move - Evelyn held too much leverage over her.

Bennett knocked and entered with documents. "Vice President Sinclair, the board has initiated an investigation into Olivia Kensington's kickbacks on multiple projects."

Evelyn looked up, intrigued. "So my brother's making his move?"

"Yes. With Victor Kensington backing Olivia, President Sterling decided it's time to act. To remove Victor, we must first expose Olivia. She likely knows she's powerless now - explains why she stopped harassing you about the Kingsley Tech collaboration."

Evelyn tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Then let's add fuel to the fire. Hand over that recording from my dinner with Olivia and Richard Dawson."

"Of course, ma'am." Bennett hesitated. "There's one more thing. Mr. Blackwood's secretary called requesting a lunch meeting."

Evelyn leaned back, arms crossed, her gaze turning icy. "Tell them I'm unavailable. And from now on, decline any invitations from him without consulting me."

At noon, just as Evelyn was preparing to leave for lunch, Bennett reappeared holding an extravagant bouquet. "Vice President Sinclair—"

"I thought I told you to discard those?" Evelyn frowned.

"How could you wound me like this, darling?" Sebastian Hart emerged dramatically from behind Bennett. "I personally selected every bloom! And you didn't even act surprised!"

Evelyn shot Bennett an exasperated look. The assistant lowered his head apologetically before making a quick escape.

Sebastian stormed into her office, his handsome face a picture of mock outrage. "I came to take you to lunch and this is the welcome I get?"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Sebastian, you know how much office gossip this causes."

"I want everyone to know you're taken!" Sebastian declared without shame. "So they'll back off!"

Evelyn sighed. "You're wasting your time."

"That's my choice to make." His expression softened into a roguish grin. "Since you've wronged me, you're buying lunch today."

Rolling her eyes, Evelyn grabbed her purse. "Fine. You pick the place."

Fate had a cruel sense of humor - their chosen restaurant brought them face-to-face with the last people Evelyn wanted to see.

Tristan Whitmore sneered. "Too busy for Nathan but available for Sebastian Hart? Alexander Sterling, Adrian Prescott, now Sebastian... You really do change men like accessories, don't you?" His smirk turned vicious. "Keeping all those plates spinning must be exhausting."
###Chapter 59

Nathan Blackwood stood silently, his piercing gaze filled with icy intensity.

Evelyn Sinclair let out a soft laugh as she casually looped her arm through Sebastian Hart's.

She arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "Why should you care how many men I date, Tristan? Or are you volunteering to be next?"

Tristan Whitmore bristled at her words, his face flushing with anger. Why did Evelyn always manage to get under his skin?

"You? Not my type," he scoffed. "Frankly, that glimpse I got of you wasn't impressive. Save yourself for men with lower standards. I'm particular about physical perfection."

Evelyn's eyes flashed dangerously. "How dare you comment on my body!"

Tristan's face alternated between red and pale as he trembled with rage, but he bit his tongue. Those compromising photos she possessed left him powerless.

He caught her veiled threat immediately. Was this woman blackmailing him now?

Sebastian chuckled beside her. "Evelyn's standards are legendary, Mr. Whitmore. If we continue this conversation, you'll ruin our appetites."

One glance at Nathan's stormy expression was enough to darken Evelyn's mood.

She gave Tristan one last dismissive look, ignored Nathan completely, and strode toward the restaurant interior.

Tristan nearly exploded behind them. "The audacity! My physique is impeccable!"

Nathan's expression turned glacial. "You think so?"

Lately, nothing was going his way. Failed business meetings with Evelyn, the unresolved emerald pipe situation, and now this humiliating encounter. The memory of Tristan's nude incident with Evelyn lingered unpleasantly in his mind.

Tristan found himself under fire again, unfairly blaming Evelyn for Nathan's bad mood.

Earlier at the office, he'd witnessed Harrison getting stonewalled by Evelyn's assistant Bennett.

Then they'd come to lunch only to find Evelyn dining intimately with Sebastian Hart. No wonder Nathan was in a foul mood.

"Speaking of which," Tristan ventured cautiously, "I heard your mother and sister auctioned off the family heirloom?" Nathan's expression darkened further. "Who bought it? Can't you just buy it back?"

Nathan's icy stare could freeze lava. "Evelyn has it."

Tristan swallowed hard. "Oh." That complicated things immensely.

The unpleasant encounter had killed Evelyn's appetite. The sweet wine Sebastian recommended burned treacherously in her throat - deceptively strong. She'd have suspected sabotage if Sebastian wasn't currently more intoxicated than she was.

Pressing a hand to her forehead, she called Bennett to arrange pickup. She needed to splash cold water on her face before leaving.

Though unsteady, Evelyn made it to the restroom. The cold water cleared her head, bringing instant regret about this disastrous lunch date.

She remembered the route back to their private room, but turning a corner, she collided with someone solid.

"My apologies—"

Her words died as she looked up into Nathan's stormy eyes. All traces of intoxication vanished as she immediately stepped back.

"Mr. Blackwood."

His eyes darkened at her retreat. "What a coincidence, Evelyn."

She arched an eyebrow. "Hardly. I was just leaving."

He blocked her path. "We need to talk."

"About what?" She feigned confusion.

"You know exactly what," he said, pinning her with his gaze.

Evelyn laughed, any remaining buzz disappearing. "There's nothing left to discuss between us. For business matters, contact Bennett."

Her phone rang - likely her driver. As she moved to leave, Nathan said tightly, "Name your price. The pipe isn't negotiable."

So the Ferguson heirloom had finally come up. Old Master Blackwood must have discovered its absence by now. Margaret and Sophia were probably suffering the consequences.

"Still don't understand, Mr. Blackwood?" Evelyn's smile glittered dangerously. "My silence yesterday was answer enough. The answer is no."
###Chapter 60

Evelyn Sinclair finished speaking her mind and retreated to the private room to collect her belongings before leaving.

Just as she was about to enter her car, she realized with a start that her designer clutch had been left behind in the private room.

She turned to retrieve it herself, but Sebastian Hart stopped her with a gentle hand on her arm. "Let me get it for you. Wait in the car."

Without waiting for her response, Sebastian strode back inside. Evelyn hesitated, then decided to follow after him discreetly. That's when she spotted Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore exiting through another door.

Not wanting unnecessary complications, Evelyn ducked behind the ornate fountain at the entrance, its cascading water providing cover.

"I heard Vanessa Holloway is returning soon?" Tristan's voice carried clearly in the crisp afternoon air.

Nathan responded with a noncommittal grunt.

Tristan chuckled. "It's been ages since I've seen her. I've actually missed her presence. Sure, she made mistakes, but your punishment was rather harsh, don't you think? She's always been one of us - surely you can find it in your heart to forgive her?"

The two men continued their conversation as they walked to Nathan's waiting car, their figures disappearing behind tinted windows.

The sky had darkened ominously, matching Evelyn's suddenly somber mood. A chilly wind whipped through her hair as she stared at the departing vehicle, an inexplicable tightness gripping her chest.

Vanessa Holloway will always be part of their inner circle, while no matter how hard I try, I'll forever remain an outsider to Nathan Blackwood.

That name - Vanessa Holloway - still had the power to send shivers down Evelyn's spine even after three years. She had believed herself free from its haunting grip, yet hearing it spoken aloud again brought back that same suffocating sensation.

"Pathetic," Evelyn muttered to herself, disgusted by her own reaction.

She knew Vanessa had fled abroad after that disastrous party. Out of sight had meant out of mind - Evelyn hadn't pursued the matter further.

But sending Vanessa abroad was considered punishment? And her return merely required Nathan's forgiveness? The absurdity of it made Evelyn's blood boil.

What about those three years when Vanessa drained me dry? I might find it in my heart to forgive others, but never her. So she's returning? Well, I'll be sure to prepare a proper welcome.

Sebastian reappeared, holding up Evelyn's forgotten clutch. His smile faded when he saw her ashen complexion. "Evelyn? Are you feeling unwell?"

She blinked, forcing a bright smile. "No, I'm fine. My driver's here - I should be going."

"Let me take you home." Sebastian guided her firmly into his car before she could protest, sliding in beside her.

Evelyn nodded absently, her smile not quite reaching her eyes.

Sebastian studied her profile, his mouth opening as if to say something, then closing again. The ride passed in heavy silence.

When they arrived at Evelyn's penthouse, she automatically instructed the driver to wait. Then she paused, meeting Sebastian's unusually solemn gaze.

"Aren't you going to invite me up, now that we're here?" His tone was light, but his eyes held uncharacteristic gravity.

Trusting his integrity completely, Evelyn stepped aside to let him enter. Somehow, his presence made the tightness in her chest ease slightly.

Sebastian suddenly laughed, the sound startling in the quiet apartment. In one fluid motion, he stood and pulled Evelyn into an embrace. Just as she began to struggle, he released her.

His eyes burned with unusual intensity as he leaned down, bringing his face level with hers. "He lost the right to affect you like this long ago, Evelyn. Remember - you'll always be my queen."

The sudden proximity left Evelyn breathless. His distinctive sandalwood scent enveloped her, making her pulse race unexpectedly.
###Chapter 61

Evelyn Sinclair felt her breath catch when Sebastian Hart turned serious.

His intense gaze held a magnetism that threatened to pull her under.

Three years ago, he'd been nothing but a reckless playboy. Now, he carried himself with a quiet authority that unsettled her.

She forced a laugh, desperate to mask her reaction. "Since when did you become so smooth, Sebastian?"

He stepped back with an easy grin. "Only for you, darling. No one else gets this version of me."

"Please," Evelyn rolled her eyes. "With your reputation? I bet you've got women lining up around the block just to hear you whisper sweet nothings."

Sebastian's expression turned unexpectedly solemn. "Those rumors were never real. You know that."

The sincerity in his voice made her chest tighten.

"Thanks for the distraction," she said quickly, "but I should rest." She couldn't risk falling for another charming liar—especially not her oldest friend.

When Sebastian wasn't flashing that wicked smile, he radiated a dangerous allure. A walking temptation.

Evelyn turned away abruptly, spotting the emerald pipe on the coffee table. Her lips curled as she picked it up, examining the Blackwood family heirloom with cold amusement.

With deliberate carelessness, she tossed it aside like trash before retreating to her bedroom. Old Man Blackwood would have an aneurysm if he saw how she treated his precious artifact.

She woke at 10 PM to a message from Alexander Sterling: [Handling overseas business. Will be gone three days. Mind the fort.]

Evelyn blinked at her phone. Since when did her overprotective brother trust her with the company?

[You realize I might burn the place down, right?] she typed back, adding a string of laughing emojis.

His reply came instantly: [Just don't bankrupt us. Everything else is fixable.]

Chuckling, Evelyn remembered the pipe. She sprang from bed, snapping a perfectly angled photo before posting it with the caption: [Found this trinket at a flea market. Thoughts?]

Within minutes, Isabella Montgomery and Sebastian had shared her post, ensuring it reached Nathan Blackwood's inner circle. Let them all see how little she valued their precious heirloom.

By morning, her phone buzzed with Isabella's excited call. "Someone offered sixty million for that 'flea market find' of yours!"

Evelyn laughed. "Double its worth overnight? How flattering."

"Guess who's behind the highest bid?" Isabella's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Tristan Whitmore—acting on Nathan's orders. The Blackwoods are desperate."

"Predictable," Evelyn smirked. "As if I'd sell it back to them."

After the call, she surveyed her garage—a glittering showroom of luxury vehicles courtesy of her father. The understated gray Porsche stood out among the flashier options.

Her choice made, she slid behind the wheel just as Archibald called from Sterling Manor.

"Miss Sinclair, shall I send a driver?"

"No need," she purred, turning the ignition. The engine roared to life like a challenge. Today promised to be interesting.
###Chapter 62

To Archibald, the esteemed butler of Sterling Manor, it was unthinkable that Miss Evelyn Sinclair should drive herself around the city.

A proper lady of her standing required a chauffeur at all times. Anything less would reflect poorly on his professionalism.

Evelyn chuckled lightly into the phone. "Archibald, really now. I'm perfectly capable of driving myself to the office. Don't trouble yourself over it."

She ended the call before he could protest further. The sleek Porsche Cayenne purred to life as she pulled out of the garage, the morning sun glinting off its flawless silver finish.

The roads were unusually clear for rush hour. Evelyn noticed with amusement how other vehicles seemed to magically create space around her car. Even at stoplights, drivers maintained a cautious three-meter buffer zone.

"Honestly," she muttered, "do I look that dangerous behind the wheel?"

Arriving at Sterling Corporation headquarters, Evelyn handed her keys to the valet. As she strode through the marble lobby, she caught Olivia Kensington glaring daggers at her from the reception area.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Had Olivia discovered she'd given Alexander the recording? That seemed improbable - the information shouldn't have leaked so quickly.

"Ms. Kensington," Evelyn called sweetly, "aren't you coming up? The meeting starts in ten minutes."

Olivia's lips curled in disdain. "Mr. Sterling must be quite taken with you to gift such an expensive vehicle. That Porsche must have cost at least two million, no?"

As if Evelyn couldn't afford her own luxury cars. She tossed her hair over one shoulder with deliberate nonchalance. "How provincial of you to assume I couldn't purchase it myself."

Letting her gaze linger on Olivia's flushed cheeks, Evelyn turned toward the private elevator without another word. That used Audi bribe had been particularly insulting.

Upstairs, Bennett briefed her on the meeting agenda. Evelyn entered the conference room in crisp stilettos, Olivia trailing behind with poorly concealed resentment.

Scanning the assembled executives, Evelyn noted Victor Kensington's unusual presence. The wily board member typically avoided these meetings. His fox-like smile suggested he'd come specifically to watch the fireworks.

"Let's begin," Evelyn announced.

The Kingsley Tech partnership details required meticulous negotiation. Every clause represented millions in potential profit. Yet the department heads - many of whom were shareholders - dragged their feet at every proposal from Evelyn's team.

Victor finally broke his silence. "Vice President Sinclair, you must understand our hesitation. While you secured this Kingsley Tech deal, the field remains volatile. We can't risk too much capital without Mr. Sterling's approval."

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Are you suggesting we breach our contract with Kingsley Tech, Mr. Kensington?"

Victor paled. Alexander would have his head for that. "Of course not! I merely propose we table discussions until Mr. Sterling returns."

Evelyn's knuckles whitened around her pen. Every delayed decision eroded their competitive edge in this emerging market. If Sterling Corp lost its leadership position, the entire venture would become meaningless.

Her gaze turned glacial as it swept across the table. "So none of you can function without Mr. Sterling holding your hands? Is this a strike?"

The room fell silent, shocked by her uncharacteristic sharpness. The pampered heiress facade had slipped, revealing steel beneath.

"You're all industry leaders," Evelyn continued, voice like tempered glass. "If you'll sabotage progress simply because the CEO is traveling, who will bear the financial consequences? What company would want executives who crumble without constant supervision?"

She let the question hang, watching comprehension dawn on their faces.

They'd thought to intimidate her in Alexander's absence. How unfortunate for them that Evelyn Sinclair was nobody's pushover.
###Chapter 63

The conference room remained in absolute silence for what felt like an eternity.

Victor Kensington's face flushed crimson, clearly unprepared for Evelyn Sinclair's counterattack. "This isn't—"

Evelyn cut him off without hesitation. "As you all received notification this morning, I'm assuming full control of Sterling Corporation during Mr. Sterling's absence."

Her piercing gaze swept across the room. "This project is under my authority. Anyone unwilling to participate may submit their resignation immediately. Your deputies will assume your responsibilities, and I'll personally brief Mr. Sterling on all developments."

The executives sat stunned. Each had clawed their way to their current positions through years of corporate warfare, with ambitious deputies constantly circling like sharks. No one dared make a move in this high-stakes moment.

Though they resented Evelyn's rapid ascent to Vice President, they'd all witnessed Alexander Sterling's unwavering support since her arrival. Crossing her meant risking everything.

Regret settled over those who'd followed Victor's lead in challenging Evelyn. The air grew thick with tension, the only sound being the nervous tapping of pens against notepads.

Victor realized his momentum had evaporated when not a single colleague continued the opposition.

"Richard Dawson," Evelyn addressed the Planning Department head sharply. "Can your team deliver the proposal by end of day?"

Richard snapped to attention. "Absolutely, Vice President Sinclair. My team will produce the optimal plan immediately after this meeting. We won't delay progress."

The other department heads, seasoned corporate survivors all, quickly followed suit with enthusiastic assurances. The atmosphere shifted palpably as Evelyn's expression softened.

"Excellent. And the other departments?"

"Research is already underway!"

"We've been preparing contingency plans for weeks!"

"Consider it done, Vice President!"

Evelyn nodded approvingly as the room filled with pledges of cooperation. Only Victor and Olivia Kensington remained silent and sullen in their seats—a detail Evelyn noted with satisfaction, knowing their days at Sterling Corporation were numbered.

As the meeting concluded, Evelyn checked her watch. "Though Kingsley Tech leads core development, we'll send two researchers to participate in later stages. HR should identify our top candidates immediately."

The executives lingered afterward, eager for private words with their suddenly approachable VP. Evelyn charmed each one, her earlier iciness replaced by warm professionalism.

Bennett appeared at her elbow, whispering urgently. "Vice President Sinclair, Chairman Blackwood has arrived."

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. "So soon? The old man's more impatient than I anticipated."

Protocol demanded she receive the Blackwood patriarch, given their corporate relationship. "Where is he waiting?"

"Your office, ma'am. He went straight there."

Evelyn suppressed a smile—of course the emerald pipe would bring him running. She chuckled softly before entering...only to freeze at the unexpected sight of Sophia Blackwood seated beside her grandfather.

"How rude!" the elder Blackwood snapped. "Entering without knocking!"

Evelyn's jaw tightened. Another power play? After surviving the boardroom ambush?

"Chairman Blackwood," she countered smoothly, "I never knock to enter my own office."
###Chapter 64
Prearranged Confrontation

Evelyn Sinclair strode confidently to her executive chair, the click of her heels echoing through the spacious office. She tossed the files onto her mahogany desk with practiced ease before powering up her computer.

Across from her, Reginald Blackwood's face darkened with each passing second of being ignored. His knuckles turned white around his cane.

"Evelyn," he spat through gritted teeth, "I've clearly misjudged you all these years."

The elderly patriarch's cold laughter sent chills through the room. "How resourceful you've become. No wonder you initiated the divorce so readily. You'd already secured your next position before leaving my grandson." His cane struck the floor with a sharp crack. "Vice President of Sterling Corporation straight after divorcing Nathan? Alexander must truly favor you."

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile as she surveyed the Blackwoods. Sophia stood trembling behind her grandfather, but the old man had come armed for battle.

"Wasn't it your family who demanded the divorce?" Evelyn leaned back in her chair, fingers steepled. "Tell me, Chairman Blackwood, why summon me weekly to Aspen Lodge just to remind me of my unworthiness? Now that I'm gone, shouldn't you be celebrating?" Her gaze turned glacial. "Yet here you are - in my office. Why?"

She remembered those humiliating Sundays too well - Margaret's cruel jabs, Sophia's petty torments, all sanctioned by the patriarch's silent approval. The entire household had treated her like dirt beneath their designer shoes.

Reginald's face purpled with rage. "How dare you take that tone with me! After everything our family—"

"This is Sterling Corporation," Evelyn cut in smoothly. "There are no family ties here - only business associates. I'm entertaining this meeting as a professional courtesy." She checked her diamond-encrusted watch pointedly. "State your business or leave. Unlike you, I don't have time for theatrics."

Sophia gasped. "You can't speak to Grandfather like that! His health—"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "Not my concern anymore. Did you come here expecting me to grovel?" She pressed her intercom. "Bennett, please prepare to escort our guests out."

Reginald's cane slammed down again. "Enough! The emerald pipe - name your price." His breathing grew labored. "That heirloom is priceless to our family. Whatever ridiculous sum you're imagining, I'll pay it."

Evelyn arched a perfectly groomed brow. "Ah, the real purpose reveals itself." She let the silence stretch unbearably long. "As I told your daughter-in-law and granddaughter, it's not for sale."

Veins bulged at Reginald's temples. "Don't play games with me, girl! This is your only chance—"

"Just like when you offered me 'any price' to divorce Nathan?" Evelyn's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I didn't want your money then. I certainly don't need it now."

For three years they'd watched her like a common thief, certain she'd married for wealth. Nathan's monthly "blood money" payments were the only funds they'd permitted her to touch.

Sophia suddenly found her voice. "You're doing this out of spite! Keeping Grandfather's treasure hostage to punish us!"

Evelyn shrugged, the picture of nonchalance. "If that's what helps you sleep at night." Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "But yes."

The admission hung in the air like a guillotine's blade.
###Chapter 65 The Scheming Viper

Evelyn Sinclair made no attempt to hide her motives.

Under normal circumstances, she would never deliberately withhold someone else's treasured possession without cause.

But the Blackwoods were different.

She despised them with every fiber of her being and took vicious satisfaction in disrupting their peace.

That was precisely why she had purchased the emerald pipe—to torment them.

She admitted it openly, seeing no reason to pretend civility in front of them.

"Mrs. Blackwood, I'm not some naive, forgiving saint. I return the energy I'm given."

Her voice was ice.

"Do you remember how your family treated me? Did you really think I'd forget?"

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

"Do I look like the type to turn the other cheek?"

Sophia Blackwood trembled with barely contained fury, her words choking in her throat.

Evelyn's blunt confession infuriated her more than any denial could have.

Margaret Blackwood shot Sophia a warning glare, forcing her to bite back her rage.

Taking a shaky breath, Sophia forced her voice into a pitiful whimper, widening her eyes in feigned innocence.

"Evelyn, I was young and foolish back then. You're so much better than me—please, just forgive me."

Her lips quivered.

"I'll do anything to make it right. Just return Grandfather's pipe. This is all my fault—Mother's been confined, and I've been punished too."

She sniffled dramatically.

"If you're still angry, you can slap me. Twice. However many times you need."

Evelyn merely smirked, watching Sophia's performance with cold amusement.

For a moment, Sophia faltered, her mask slipping before she stiffened again.

Evelyn's gaze was razor-sharp, dissecting her like a specimen.

What a pathetic little viper.

When Evelyn remained unmoved, Margaret cleared her throat, barely concealing his irritation.

"Evelyn, I know we've wronged you. Sophia came here today to apologize sincerely."

His tone was strained.

"Name your terms."

Evelyn scoffed.

Apology? More like emotional blackmail.

Her expression remained impassive.

"I don't accept your apology. And the pipe stays with me."

Margaret's composure cracked, his face darkening.

"Evelyn," he growled, "what exactly do you want?"

Finally losing his patience?

She tilted her head.

"Nothing. If we're done here, I have places to be."

Exhaustion crept in—dealing with them was draining.

Margaret's eyes turned glacial.

"Don't say I didn't give you a chance."

Evelyn arched a brow.

"Oh? What are you planning?"

With deliberate slowness, Margaret pulled out his phone.

"Tell me—does William Sterling know his son is involved with a divorcee?"

A venomous smile curled his lips.

"I still have some influence with him. Do you really think he'll let you keep your position once he finds out?"

The threat hung thick in the air.

Evelyn paused—then laughed.

She extended her hand in a mocking gesture.

"Go ahead."

He really thinks this will scare me?

William Sterling is my father.

Margaret's expression darkened further.

Seeing her defiance, he dialed the number.

Sophia watched with smug anticipation, as if awaiting Evelyn's downfall.

The line connected after three rings.

"Margaret Blackwood," came William Sterling's relaxed voice. "To what do I owe this unexpected call?"

Margaret forced a chuckle.

"William, I heard you were vacationing in Europe. You sound well."

"I was. The Mediterranean is lovely this time of year."

A pause.

"Unless this is urgent, I’m in the middle of fishing."

Evelyn smirked.

Of course Dad wouldn’t waste time on them.

Margaret cut straight to the point.

"William, are you aware your son is entangled with a divorcee?"

A beat of silence.

Then—

"Really? I hadn’t noticed."
###Chapter 66

Old Master Blackwood's voice was sharp. "Alexander is highly capable—he takes after you. But if he's being manipulated by a woman like her, won't everything fall apart?"

William Sterling scoffed. "Just a woman. What damage could she possibly do?"

Old Master Blackwood shot Evelyn Sinclair a meaningful glance.

"This woman is far from ordinary. Right after her divorce, Alexander promoted her to Vice President of Sterling Corporation—second-in-command. Soon, she'll be making all the decisions in your company. Shouldn’t you, as Chairman, step in before it’s too late?"

Most people would have been furious hearing such words.

But William Sterling was no ordinary man.

He let out a dry chuckle, his tone dismissive.

"Mr. Blackwood, worry about your own affairs. I trust my son." A pause, then amusement colored his voice. "Ah, looks like I’ve got a bite. Goodbye."

The call ended abruptly.

Old Master Blackwood’s face twisted in frustration. He glared at Evelyn, his anger barely contained.

"You got lucky this time. But do you really think it’s that easy to enter the Sterling family? William Sterling is far more formidable than you realize!"

Evelyn laughed lightly, her eyes glinting with quiet confidence. "That’s not your concern." She tilted her head. "But mark my words—I will be part of the Sterling family."

After all, the truth of her identity would come to light eventually. She couldn’t wait to see the old man’s reaction when he realized who she really was.

Old Master Blackwood sneered, mocking her delusion. He opened his mouth to retort, but Evelyn had already lost interest.

Calling William had been his last resort—and it had failed spectacularly.

"Chairman Blackwood," she said smoothly, "if there’s nothing else, my assistant will see you out. I have a meeting to attend."

Evelyn Sinclair offered them a polite yet distant smile, her expression carefully neutral.

Sophia Blackwood looked furious, her lips pressed into a tight line as she fought back whatever biting remark threatened to spill out.

Old Master Blackwood, equally exasperated by the encounter, let out a cold scoff. "You're bringing this upon yourself."

With a press of a button on her office intercom, Evelyn summoned Bennett, who entered promptly and stood at attention.

"Vice President Sinclair, how may I assist you?"

"Please escort our guests out."

"Right away, ma'am." Bennett turned to the visitors with practiced professionalism. "Chairman Blackwood, Ms. Blackwood, this way, please."

Old Master Blackwood clenched his jaw, his face dark with displeasure as he strode out. Sophia followed, shooting Evelyn one last resentful glare.

Once outside, the old man immediately dialed Nathan Blackwood, his voice thick with fury.

"I never imagined Evelyn would turn out to be this ungrateful after three years of marriage. She's stubborn as a mule. Were you blind when you married her?"

Nathan paused. "You went to see her?"

"Of course I did! I can't stand the thought of my precious pipe in her hands for another second! That woman is ruthless—she refused to hand it over even when I confronted her personally. She deceived us for three years. I never expected her to be this kind of person!"

Nathan was silent for a long moment before responding, his voice low. "Perhaps she's had enough of tolerating us all this time."

"Grandfather, I'll handle it. Don’t worry—I’ll get your pipe back."

"You'd better. Otherwise, I won’t let her off so easily! And by the way, she even had the audacity to claim she’s marrying into the Sterling family. Do something about her private life. No respectable family would accept a divorced woman who flirts with every man in sight!"

Nathan’s frown deepened, irritation flaring in his chest.

Evelyn had done nothing wrong, yet she was still being slandered. His grandfather’s words left a bitter taste in his mouth.

But the thought of Alexander Sterling and Sebastian Hart constantly hovering around her only made his mood worse—restless, suffocated, unsettled.

After hanging up, Nathan rubbed his temples, exhaling sharply.

Harrison, who had been watching cautiously from the side, finally spoke up.

"Sir, the meeting scheduled in five minutes—shall we proceed as planned?"

Nathan’s dark eyes flickered with something unreadable. Instead of answering, he asked, "Harrison, what kind of person do you think Evelyn is?"

"Why is she so different before and after the divorce?"

Harrison hesitated, then decided honesty was best.

"Madam—I mean, Ms. Sinclair—is a very kind person."

Nathan’s expression darkened. "You’ve been in frequent contact?"

"No, no! It’s just… back when you first married, she would often call me. She was always concerned about your well-being."

"Every time you traveled for business, she’d check the weather and remind me to pack appropriate clothes and meals. Sometimes, she’d even prepare them herself and send them over. And no matter how many times you ignored her calls, she never got angry."

Watching Nathan’s face grow stormier, Harrison wondered if he’d said too much.

"And yet… I never knew any of this?"
###Chapter 67

Nathan Blackwood's fingers tightened around his phone.

He couldn't recall a single time Evelyn Sinclair had ever reached out to him.

Harrison cleared his throat nervously. "Sir, I did bring this up before, but you made it clear you didn't want to be bothered with trivial matters from Highland Estates. You specifically said—in front of both Ms. Sinclair and me—that unless it concerned Vanessa Holloway, you weren't to be disturbed."

His voice trailed off as the temperature in the room seemed to drop.

Nathan rubbed his temples, the memory surfacing.

They had been at Highland Estates then, but his focus had been solely on Vanessa’s condition. He hadn’t noticed the way Evelyn’s hopeful gaze had dimmed, hadn’t realized how his indifference had chipped away at her until there was nothing left.

He had given her the marriage she asked for—in name only—but in return, he had taken everything from her.

The pain in his chest was sudden and suffocating.

Now he understood.

This was how Evelyn had gone from cautious to completely broken.

"Sir, the board meeting—"

"Set up a meeting with Evelyn. I need to see her." Nathan knew she wouldn’t answer if he called, and showing up unannounced at Sterling Corp would only push her further away.

Harrison hesitated. "They’ve already declined. Ms. Sinclair isn’t available."

Nathan’s gaze darkened, and Harrison immediately backtracked.

"But I’ll keep trying until we secure an appointment."

"Get out." Nathan’s voice was ice. "Proceed with the meeting as scheduled."

Harrison retreated with a quiet sigh.

What was the point? Why chase after her now, when the divorce was final?

Sterling Corporation

Bennett had just escorted Old Master Blackwood out when he returned to Evelyn’s office, relaying every word of the confrontation.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile.

She had never been liked by the Blackwoods, so she wasn’t surprised they’d resort to underhanded tactics. But fabricating scandals about her personal life? That was low.

"He wants to ruin my reputation so I can’t remarry into high society?" She tapped her nails against the desk. "How petty."

Most women would be crushed by such rumors.

But Evelyn wasn’t most women.

She had planned to return the emerald pipe after toying with them for a few more days.

Now?

She’d keep it just to spite them.

Her phone buzzed—William Sterling calling.

She waved Bennett off. "Give me a minute."

Once the door closed, she answered. "Dad. Catch anything good today?"

William huffed. "Did that old bastard Blackwood just confront you?"

"Right in my office. Then he called you in front of me like it was some kind of power move." She examined her manicure, unbothered.

"He has the audacity to complain to me?" William’s voice sharpened. "After everything they put you through?"

"Don’t worry. I kicked him out."

"Good girl." William’s tone warmed with pride. "No need to be polite to those vipers."

Evelyn laughed. "Exactly. If he comes back, I’ll smash that pipe of his. Let’s see who suffers more."

William chuckled. "That’s my daughter. Show them who they’re dealing with."

A knock interrupted them.

Bennett leaned in. "Vice President, we still need to finalize the Kingsley Tech proposal. Should we convene a meeting?"

Evelyn nodded. "Dad, go enjoy your fishing. I’ve got work."

By evening, Evelyn was packing up when Bennett stopped her at the door.

"Vice President, Dominic Kingsley requested dinner to discuss the Kingsley Tech project."

Evelyn considered it. The deal was crucial.

"Fine. You’re coming with me."

Bennett nodded. "I’ll arrange the car."
###Chapter 68

Evelyn Sinclair exchanged a glance with Bennett, whose expression mirrored her own surprise.

Nathan Blackwood's unexpected presence clearly caught them both off guard.

Their eyes met briefly before Evelyn turned her attention to Dominic Kingsley, her lips curving into a wry smile.

"Was this your idea of a setup?"

Dominic lifted his shoulders in a helpless shrug, glancing between Nathan and Evelyn.

"Vice President Sinclair, I had no choice in the matter. Forgive my presumption—I assure you, I remain neutral in whatever matters exist between you both." He offered a conciliatory smile. "As an apology, once you're finished here, I'd like to personally show you our new research facility. I believe you'll find it fascinating."

Fascinating? Undoubtedly. But that didn't lessen the irritation of being manipulated.

Evelyn's expression cooled as she turned her gaze to Nathan, her brow arching slightly. "Mr. Blackwood, if this is about that emerald pipe, save your breath. I'm not interested in rehashing the same conversation."

Honestly, would they ever stop hounding her? Her time was far too valuable for these games.

"Evelyn." Nathan's deep voice held an unfamiliar weight. After a pause, he continued, "I know my grandfather visited you today. Whatever he said... don't take it to heart."

He knew better than to expect forgiveness. A simple apology couldn't erase three years of neglect.

Evelyn studied him, struck by the odd shift in his demeanor.

"Is that all?" Impatience laced her words.

Nathan hesitated. "That pipe holds no real value to you. If you took it simply to provoke them, you've succeeded. Once you've had your fill of satisfaction, return it to my grandfather. Name your price—anything you want."

Silence stretched between them. Then Evelyn's lips curled in amusement.

How interesting. When intimidation failed, he resorted to bargaining? That pipe must mean more to them than she realized.

Dominic, sensing the tension, attempted to lighten the mood. "Anything? What if she demands reconciliation? Would you agree to that?"

The question hung heavily in the air. Bennett's gaze flicked to Nathan, whose expression darkened.

Just as Dominic began regretting his words, Evelyn laughed—a sharp, dismissive sound.

"Reconcile? Don't flatter yourself. Someone of Mr. Blackwood's standing should marry within his own circle. Why would he ever lower himself?"

Nathan's jaw tightened, but Evelyn continued smoothly, "However..." She paused, her smile turning calculating. "If you're that desperate for the pipe, terms can be arranged."

Nathan's attention sharpened. "Name them."

Evelyn's gaze slid to Dominic. "A moment alone?"

Dominic straightened his tie with visible relief. "Of course."

He exited without hesitation, Bennett following suit. Being trapped between these two exes was an experience he'd rather avoid.

Left alone, Nathan waited while Evelyn moved to the sofa with deliberate grace. She picked up a cigarette from the table, lit it with practiced ease, and exhaled a slow, perfect smoke ring.

Nathan's frown deepened at the sight. "Since when do you smoke?"

The Evelyn he remembered had been the picture of refinement—no vices, no imperfections.

Yet the woman before him handled the cigarette with such natural elegance it was clear this wasn't a new habit.

Evelyn tapped ash into the tray, her smile enigmatic. "Three years now."

Three years.

The beginning of their marriage.

Meaning she'd taken up smoking during what should have been their happiest days—days he'd left her alone.
###Chapter 69

Nathan Blackwood felt his chest tighten.

His vision darkened momentarily as realization struck him.

He knew nothing about Evelyn Sinclair. Not her hidden talent for the violin. Certainly not her smoking habit.

"I never smoked around you," Evelyn said casually, exhaling a thin stream of smoke. "I assumed you'd disapprove."

Every blood donation left Evelyn weakened. While Nathan accompanied Vanessa Holloway, Evelyn's only comfort had been these cigarettes. The habit became her crutch during those unbearable days.

A wry smile touched Evelyn's lips, though her eyes remained shadowed. Just as quickly, her expression smoothed into its usual composed mask.

She studied Nathan's downcast eyes with amusement. "Care to hear my terms?"

Without waiting for response, she continued. "I want Vanessa to return every drop of blood I've given her. She can take a year to repay it all."

Nathan's head snapped up. "What?"

Evelyn chuckled. "I've reconsidered. My blood is valuable - better spent saving worthwhile lives than wasted on that viper. I was foolish before, but it's not too late to correct that mistake. Return my blood, I'll give you the pipe, and we're square."

Vanessa had manipulated the situation for years - feigning illness, demanding transfusions purely to torment Evelyn. Nathan remained oblivious to the charade. Where once this deception had wounded Evelyn, now it barely registered.

This repayment would sever her final ties to the past, make her whole again.

"Vanessa returns soon, doesn't she?" Evelyn's smile turned predatory. "I do so want to make her suffer." She watched Nathan closely. Would he choose his family heirloom or his mistress?

With deliberate slowness, she stubbed out her cigarette and stood. "No need to decide immediately. Think it over."

As she walked away, Nathan's gaze grew turbulent. Just how deeply did Evelyn despise Vanessa? How much had she come to loathe their marriage that she demanded restitution in blood?

Nathan summoned his assistant immediately. "Harrison, compile records of every transfusion Evelyn gave Vanessa."

"Right away, sir," Harrison responded.

The report came within minutes. "Sir, Ms. Sinclair donated approximately 14,400 milliliters total. Given average adult blood volume is 4,000-5,000 ml..."

Harrison hesitated before continuing. "This equates to completely draining her body's blood supply three times over."

The phone slipped from Nathan's grasp.

Three times. She'd bled herself dry for him three times.

All those years of silent suffering, and he'd been blind to it.

An invisible weight crushed Nathan's chest, making each breath painful.

Evelyn's one-year repayment condition proved deliberate - she wanted Vanessa to experience prolonged suffering, just as she had.

Outside, Evelyn found Dominic Kingsley on a call. Noticing her, he quickly concluded his conversation. "Ms. Sinclair, pleasant meeting?"

"For me," Evelyn smiled faintly. "Though I doubt the gentleman inside shares the sentiment."
###Chapter 70

Dominic Kingsley arched an eyebrow.

"At any rate, I was the one who overstepped first." His voice carried a hint of amusement. "Ms. Sinclair, if you're interested, I can take you to meet our core research team. It's not an opportunity many get."

Evelyn didn't hesitate.

Understanding Kingsley Tech's latest advancements would give her an edge in the AI market. Knowledge was power, and she intended to wield it.

As they stepped out, Dominic turned to Bennett. "Mr. Bennett, I'm afraid access is restricted. Company secrets, you understand. But I'll personally ensure Ms. Sinclair returns safely."

Bennett hesitated, glancing at Evelyn.

She gave him a reassuring nod. "Go ahead. I'll be fine."

"Yes, ma'am."

Dominic's car awaited them. The blacked-out windows and drawn curtains ensured no prying eyes could follow their route. Evelyn noted the precautions with interest.

Dominic Kingsley doesn't take chances.

That only made her more curious.

"Mr. Bennett used to be Alexander Sterling's right-hand man," Dominic mused, adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses. "Now he serves you. It seems Mr. Sterling holds you in high regard."

A knowing smile played on his lips.

"No wonder you dismissed the idea of remarriage so decisively earlier. With such powerful backing, why repeat past mistakes?"

Evelyn's response was cool. "Mr. Sterling recognizes talent. That's all."

Dominic chuckled. Clearly, Nathan Blackwood stood no chance with her.

Twenty minutes later, the car descended into an underground garage. Harsh fluorescent lights illuminated the space, revealing sleek Morandi-gray walls designed to blend into obscurity.

Discreet. Efficient.

Just like Dominic himself.

The elevator required three fingerprint scans before granting access. Dominic gestured politely.

"After you, Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn stepped inside, noting the single button for the 17th floor. No other options.

"Should I be blindfolded?" she joked.

Dominic laughed. "No need. Our secrets aren't so easily stolen."

Relief flickered through her, anticipation quickening her pulse.

The elevator doors opened to a corridor lined with silver-gray glass. Translucent yet impenetrable. A labyrinth of secrets.

Dominic led her to an unmarked room, pressing his palm against the glass. Data streams flickered to life—curved lines of code dancing across the surface.

Iris recognition followed.

The wall parted.

Another corridor stretched ahead, identical to the last. Without a guide, one could wander forever.

Finally, Dominic pushed open a door.

"Here we are."

Inside, white-coated researchers worked in focused silence. One spun a gyroscope-like device; another murmured commands to a computer.

"Everyone else has left for the day," Dominic said, amused. "The ones here? All married to their work."

A curly-haired man looked up, grinning.

"Hey now, don't insult us single folks. We have feelings too!" His eyes landed on Evelyn. "Oh—we have company?"

Evelyn smiled, about to greet him—

When something brushed against her shoe.

She looked down.

Leo, the AI tiger, gazed up at her, stripes shifting as it grinned.

"Hello, pretty lady! We meet again." Its voice was playful. "I really like you."
###Chapter 71

Evelyn Sinclair froze in shock as she bent down to scoop up the tiger cub.

"Well hello there, little one. Fancy meeting you again?"

The cub nuzzled against her shoulder, its voice dripping with childish indignation. "I'm not little! I'm a mighty jungle king! Rawr!"

Amused, Evelyn glanced at Dominic Kingsley. "It actually recognizes me?"

"Photographic memory," Dominic chuckled before lowering his voice conspiratorially. "Though technically it's just a very advanced AI. Shh—don't let it hear you say that."

"I heard that! Now I'm mad at you! Hmph!" The cub turned its head away dramatically, whiskers twitching in outrage.

Dominic rubbed his nose sheepishly as a curly-haired researcher approached. "So you're the famous beauty this little traitor won't stop gushing about?"

The bespectacled man looked every inch the stereotypical mad scientist, though he couldn't have been older than twenty-five.

"This turncoat came back yesterday bragging about meeting some gorgeous woman," he explained. "Considering its usual standards are ridiculously high, we had to see for ourselves. We were literally just discussing you when you walked in."

Evelyn's lips curved in surprise as she stroked the cub's head. It preened under her attention, declaring smugly, "See? Told you she was pretty! Admit I was right!"

"So your name is Little Traitor?"

The cub huffed and pointedly ignored the question. Dominic explained with obvious amusement, "No idea who programmed its personality matrix. It's ridiculously fickle—changes allegiances faster than a politician during election season. Hence the nickname."

"I designed that personality! What's wrong with it?"

The indignant voice came from a round-faced young woman with enormous eyes who stormed out of the adjacent lab. She glared at Dominic before reaching for the cub. "Come here, you."

The cub clung to Evelyn's arm like a lifeline. "No! Pretty Lady smells nice! She's soft!"

The girl's eye twitched. "You absolute traitor!"

The entire room erupted in laughter. Evelyn grinned at the flustered scientist. "You created this little drama queen?"

The girl blinked up at Evelyn, momentarily distracted. "Wow...you really are stunning." Recovering, she nodded proudly. "Yep, that's my code running through its processors."

Dominic cleared his throat. "Ms. Sinclair, may I present Dr. Emily Whitaker—our resident genius and project lead. Emily, this is Ms. Sinclair, our new investor. I'll let you give her the tour while I check on the others."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. This girl looked barely out of college, yet she was heading the entire project? Emily beamed. "No problem! Leave her to me!" As Dominic and the curly-haired researcher walked away, Emily turned to Evelyn with undisguised curiosity. "You can call me Emily. I'm twenty-three. Ms. Sinclair...are you, like, crazy rich?"

She linked arms with Evelyn and started dragging her toward the lab. Evelyn barely had time to process the abrupt question before Emily continued cheerfully, "Dominic said only billionaires can afford to invest in this project. I love making rich friends!"

The cub made a disgusted noise. "Gold digger."

"One more word and I'm reformatting your entire personality matrix!" Emily snapped.

The cub immediately buried its face in Evelyn's blouse, trembling. Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "My company has...adequate resources."

Now she understood where the cub's dramatic personality came from—its creator was clearly cut from the same cloth.

Emily's lab was a technological wonderland. Glass walls shimmered with holographic data streams while robotic components and precision instruments covered every surface. Then Evelyn's gaze landed on a large LCD display—and the breath left her lungs.

Donovan Sterling?!

Her second brother's face smiled back at her from the screen.
###Chapter 72

The screen displayed a photograph of Donovan Sterling, Evelyn's second brother, accepting a prestigious award in Switzerland. At just seventeen, Donovan had been honored with the Quantum Innovation Prize, catapulting him to international fame as the foremost physicist of his generation. His brilliant mind made him the most sought-after scientist across continents. In the image, Donovan appeared youthful and clean-shaven, his smile radiating warmth like morning sunlight.

"You know him?!" Emily Whitaker practically bounced toward Evelyn, her eyes sparkling with undisguised admiration. "He's my absolute idol! Meeting him would be a dream come true - I could die happy after that!"

Evelyn remained silent. While her brother's professional achievements were undeniable, his eccentric personality was another matter entirely. Donovan had an inexplicable aversion to female company, so severe that their father worried he might remain a bachelor forever.

Emily enthusiastically recounted Donovan's numerous accomplishments while clutching Evelyn's arm. "Isn't he just breathtaking? He makes every Hollywood actor look plain by comparison! I wonder what he looks like under that lab coat..."

Evelyn pressed her lips together before murmuring, "He's... decent looking."

Having grown up with Donovan frequently wandering shirtless around their family home, Evelyn knew his physique well. While certainly fit, she privately considered him average compared to their eldest brother Alexander and their actor brother Lucas.

Emily's eyes widened in shock. "How would you know? Do you actually know him?"

A mischievous thought struck Evelyn. Wouldn't it be amusing if Emily pursued Donovan? With a playful smirk, she revealed, "I have his personal number. Want it?"

Emily gasped. "You're joking!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn pulled out her phone and initiated a video call with Donovan right in front of Emily. The call connected to show her brother abroad, his hair tousled from sleep as he rubbed his eyes. Emily shrieked and spun away, covering her mouth in excitement.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?" Donovan's sleepy voice came through. "I've been buried in research - haven't had time to check in."

Evelyn smiled. "No emergency. Just wanted to see your face. I've got a friend here who's your biggest fan. Would you give her an autograph?"

Donovan hesitated before reluctantly agreeing. "Fine. One signature."

Ending the call, Evelyn turned to see Emily practically vibrating with joy. She couldn't help but laugh. "I'll get you that autograph when I can."

Emily struggled to contain her excitement as she grabbed Evelyn's hands. "Oh my God! I just saw Donovan Sterling waking up! This is the best day of my life!"

Evelyn simply shook her head in amusement.

"Please, please give me his number!" Emily begged, clasping her hands dramatically. Her large eyes pleaded as she offered, "What do you want in exchange? This silly tiger?" She pointed at the mechanical feline in Evelyn's arms, her expression torn between hope and fear of rejection.

Evelyn's eyes lit up in surprise. "You'd really trade him? Will Dominic approve?"

"Absolutely!" Emily declared without hesitation. "Leo belongs to me, not Dominic. He has no say in this."

"Deal!" Evelyn had adored the advanced AI tiger since first seeing it but had been too polite to ask for it.

She quickly transferred Donovan's contact information to Emily, who responded by showering Evelyn with hugs and kisses. "Evie! You're amazing! I love you so much!"

The robotic tiger huffed in displeasure, pushing Emily away from Evelyn with its paw. "Stop touching my pretty lady! She's mine now!"

Evelyn laughed, stroking the tiger's head. "That's right. From today onward, you're coming home with me."

The mechanical creature wiggled happily. "I like you! Take me home!"

"Does it need special charging?" Evelyn asked, wanting to properly care for her new companion.

Emily, already distracted by her phone waiting for Donovan to accept her friend request, waved dismissively. "Just ask it. The thing knows everything about itself!"

Evelyn ran her fingers over the tiger's synthetic fur in amazement. "Really? You know all your own specifications?"

The tiger puffed out its chest proudly, nuzzling her hand. "Of course! I'm programmed with complete self-diagnostics!"
###Chapter 73

Evelyn Sinclair carefully noted down Emily Whitaker's contact number before stepping out of the lab, cradling the small robotic tiger in her arms. Dominic Kingsley raised an eyebrow in surprise at her swift return.

With a triumphant smile, Evelyn held up the mechanical creature. "Emily gifted him to me. May I take him home?"

Dominic's expression shifted from shock to amusement. "Of course. He's her personal creation, completely separate from company property." He approached and gently stroked the tiger's head. "Behave yourself, little traitor."

The tiger huffed indignantly. "Finally going home with my beautiful mama!"

Dominic chuckled as he shook his head. "Let me escort you back."

Upon arriving at her penthouse, Evelyn intended to bond with her new companion, but her phone interrupted with an incoming video call from Lucas Sterling, her famous actor brother.

The robotic tiger explored its new surroundings with childlike wonder, its tail swishing excitedly. It marveled at the lavish decor before claiming its throne - a $100,000 Hermès throw blanket draped over the designer sofa.

Lucas Sterling's face filled the screen, his chiseled features proof of his international stardom. That devastating smile had broken countless hearts across continents. "Baby sis! You're glowing more than ever."

Evelyn flipped her hair with practiced nonchalance. "What can I say? Perfection runs in the family."

Lucas barked a laugh at her shamelessness. "To celebrate your divorce, I postponed my shoot in Milan. Flying home tomorrow - don't forget to pick me up!" The call ended before Evelyn could respond.

She turned to the curious tiger now nuzzling her palm. "Do you have a proper name?"

"Baby," it replied, rubbing its face against her hand.

Evelyn considered this. "How about Leo? It suits a majestic creature like you." The tiger's eyes lit up.

"Leo! Strong and powerful! ROAR!" It pounced playfully before curling up for a quick recharge. Evelyn marveled at Emily's genius - this creation behaved exactly like a real tiger cub. "No wonder Emily admires Donovan," she mused. "Brilliance recognizes brilliance."

At dawn, Leo sprang onto Evelyn's bed, tugging the covers with his tiny paws. "Mama! Airport time!" The sudden chill woke Evelyn instantly.

"You called me mama?" she asked, amused.

Leo licked her palm affectionately. "Emily said my namer becomes my mama."

"Couldn't you call me Evie instead?"

The tiger's forehead stripes scrunched in confusion. "Evie...mama?"

Evelyn surrendered with a laugh. "Mama it is. But how did you remember about the airport?"

"Photographic memory!" Leo declared proudly.

After hastily dressing in an elegant navy dress with diamond accents, Evelyn drove her Porsche Cayenne to the bustling airport. A crowd of screaming fans near arrivals confirmed Lucas's flight had landed.

One enthusiastic fan's sign caught Evelyn's eye: "Lucas Sterling - You're the Moon to My Stars!" She snapped a photo for the family group chat:

[Evelyn Sinclair: First time questioning our naming choices...]

[Alexander Sterling: Should say 'Lucas makes me loco!']

[Donovan Sterling: That sign's polymer composite suggests... three paragraphs of scientific jargon]

[Lucas Sterling: TRAITORS! Dad, punish them!]

[William Sterling: has left the conversation]
###Chapter 74

Evelyn Sinclair was scrolling through her phone with a delighted grin when an excited shout cut through the airport chatter. "Nathan!"

Her head instinctively turned toward the commotion. Emerging from the arrivals gate was a face that made Evelyn's smile freeze in place.

Vanessa Holloway? What were the odds?

Nathan Blackwood had come to collect Vanessa with his assistant Harrison in tow. The moment Vanessa spotted Nathan, her eyes welled up with tears as she rushed into his arms without hesitation.

The intimate embrace felt like a dagger to Evelyn's heart. She thought she'd moved on, but the sharp pang in her chest told another story. A bitter heaviness settled in her lungs, making time seem to stand still.

Before Evelyn could process her emotions, strong arms encircled her from behind, pulling her against a familiar chest. The distinctive cologne told her exactly who it was before she even turned around.

"Lucas, really?" Evelyn huffed as she removed the hands covering her eyes. "Aren't you too old for these childish games?"

Lucas Sterling's perfectly sculpted face came into view, his features so flawless they could make supermodels jealous. He pushed his sunglasses up with one finger, smirking. "You kept me waiting forever, little sister."

"Oh my God! That's Lucas Sterling!" A nearby fan's shriek set off a chain reaction. Within seconds, they were surrounded by screaming admirers.

Evelyn's eyes widened in alarm. "Where's your security detail?" she whispered urgently.

"Gave them the week off," Lucas replied casually, as if this were perfectly normal.

"And what exactly am I supposed to do about this?" Evelyn gestured at the growing crowd.

"Protect me, obviously." Lucas winked, completely unfazed.

The airport descended into chaos as more fans recognized the famous actor. Cameras flashed like strobe lights as people jostled for a better view.

Evelyn groaned internally. This was exactly why she avoided public appearances with her celebrity brother. Lucas held her close, shielding her from the jostling crowd while fans screamed his name and snapped photos.

"Evelyn Sinclair? Isn't that Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife?" someone in the crowd whispered loudly.

"With Lucas Sterling? No way!"

The gossip spread like wildfire through the terminal. Evelyn wished the ground would swallow her whole, but the sea of people and flashing cameras offered no escape.

Lucas, ever the showman, only tightened his grip around Evelyn's shoulders and flashed his signature smile at the crowd. "Thank you for the love, everyone, but you're scaring my favorite girl!"

The resulting screams nearly shattered the terminal windows. With no other choice, Evelyn straightened her posture and forced a smile, though her eyes kept darting toward the exit.

That's when she spotted him.

Nathan stood frozen near the doors, his expression unreadable as he watched the spectacle with Vanessa still clinging to his arm. Their eyes met briefly, and something shifted in Evelyn's demeanor.

Let him see, she thought. Let him see how much better off I am without him.

As they finally made their way outside, Lucas turned dramatically to his fans. "Home time, everyone! Even stars need their beauty sleep!"

Miraculously, the crowd obeyed, though their excited chatter continued.

"Where's your car?" Lucas asked, ruffling Evelyn's hair like she was still twelve.

She led him to the parking spot, rolling her eyes when he immediately started admiring her vehicle. "Nice ride. I'm buying one."

"You have a garage full of cars you never drive," Evelyn pointed out.

"If you love it that much, you can drive it. Until you get bored next week," she added knowingly. Lucas changed cars more often than most people changed socks.

Then, with perfect timing, he dropped the real bomb: "So... that was Nathan Blackwood back there, wasn't it?"
###Chapter 75

The moment Lucas Sterling slid into the car, he ripped off his sunglasses with an impatient flick of his wrist. His piercing blue eyes burned with undisguised contempt.

He'd spotted that bastard Nathan Blackwood at the airport.

Evelyn Sinclair merely nodded, her expression unreadable. "Yes," she said calmly. "His mistress has returned."

Nathan's presence was impossible to miss, and someone as observant as Lucas would have noticed immediately.

"That woman clinging to his arm?" Lucas scoffed. "Is the man blind?"

A wry smile touched Evelyn's lips. "He has... peculiar tastes." She glanced at her brother. "The paparazzi definitely caught us at the airport. Should we have your PR team handle it?"

Lucas waved a dismissive hand. "Let them run the photos. I want the world to see how desirable my sister is!"

Had Nathan not appeared so unexpectedly, Lucas might have been more discreet about their public display. But seeing that arrogant bastard had ignited something primal in him - a need to show Nathan exactly what he'd lost.

Evelyn Sinclair could have any man she wanted.

"Do you realize how many scandals I've been dragged into because of you?" Evelyn laughed, shaking her head. "At this rate, I might as well join the entertainment industry."

"Come work with me then!" Lucas grinned. "With my connections, you could rule any circle you choose!"

Meanwhile, the atmosphere in the black sedan parked near the airport exit was thick with tension.

Harrison cleared his throat nervously. "Sir, where should we go now? Shall I take Ms. Holloway to her hotel?"

Vanessa Holloway turned pleading eyes toward Nathan. "I'd like to visit your parents first. I brought gifts from Paris. It's been so long since I've seen them."

Nathan's jaw tightened. His dark eyes were stormy as he replied, "You should visit the Harts first. Theodore's death anniversary is approaching. Isn't that why you returned?" There was an unmistakable edge to his voice.

Had he indulged Vanessa too much? Allowed her to grow too close? The thought made him sick. Was this why Evelyn had misunderstood their relationship?

An image flashed through Nathan's mind - Lucas Sterling holding Evelyn close, her body molded against his without resistance. The way they'd walked through the airport together, wrapped in each other's arms, completely oblivious to the world. The memory made his blood boil.

Vanessa flinched at Nathan's cold tone. She could feel his revulsion like a physical blow. "Of course," she said quickly. "But won't the Harts be even more depressed if I visit now? That's why I thought—"

Nathan cut her off with a sharp gesture. He wasn't interested in her excuses.

From the front seat, Harrison caught a glimpse of the pair in the rearview mirror and immediately looked away. The tension in the car was suffocating.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms as she bit down on her lower lip. A sudden realization flashed in her eyes.

I'm certain I spotted Evelyn earlier. Isn't she involved with Alexander Sterling? How did she end up with Lucas Sterling, the Hollywood heartthrob? Ever since your divorce, she's been living quite the carefree romantic life, constantly surrounded by different men. Harrison, don't you agree?

Seeing Nathan's expression darken, Vanessa quickly redirected the conversation to Harrison, hoping he'd intervene and diffuse the tension.

But Harrison, when addressed, didn't even glance up from his tablet. He pretended to be engrossed in work arrangements, deliberately ignoring her question.

The silence stretched for an uncomfortable ten seconds.

Her attempt at manipulation had failed spectacularly.

Vanessa's grip tightened on her dress as the car pulled up to The Grandeur's entrance. Shock flickered across her face.

"Nathan, I—"

Staying at a hotel was the last thing Vanessa wanted. Now that Evelyn was out of the Blackwood family, this was her chance to rightfully reside at Highland Estates!

Nathan checked his watch but made no move to exit the vehicle. His cold gaze swept over her. "You should spend more time with Theodore's parents. I'll arrange for your return to Paris after his memorial service."

Vanessa's face froze. He's sending me away again? Is there truly no hope for us?

"Drive," Nathan commanded.

"Wait!" Vanessa leaned forward desperately, her eyes welling up. "Are you still angry with me? Is this about when I used Evelyn's identity? That's all in the past now! You never even loved her, so why does it matter? If you're still upset, I'll apologize to her—"
###Chapter 76

Nathan's piercing gaze turned glacial as he lifted his eyes. His voice carried an icy detachment when he spoke. "The past can't be undone. I have no right to forgive you in her stead, and frankly, Evelyn couldn't care less about your apology."

Vanessa Holloway stood frozen, her shocked expression morphing into something darker as Nathan deliberately looked away. "Why are we still here?" he snapped at the driver. "Move!"

The chauffeur didn't hesitate, immediately pulling away from the curb.

Left standing rigidly on the sidewalk, Vanessa watched the luxury car disappear around the corner. The hurt in her eyes gradually burned away, replaced by smoldering resentment.

"I was only overseas for a few months," she muttered through clenched teeth. "When did Nathan become this cold toward me? And defending Evelyn of all people? That woman must be working some serious magic."

With trembling fingers, Vanessa yanked out her phone and stabbed at the screen. Her voice transformed into honeyed warmth when the call connected. "Sophia? Darling, I'm back in town..."

Meanwhile, with William Sterling still abroad and Alexander Sterling on business travel, Lucas Sterling had become utterly determined to follow Evelyn home.

Evelyn groaned in exasperation as her younger brother clung to her arm like an overgrown koala. "Archibald had your penthouse professionally cleaned just two days ago. Why must you invade my space?"

Lucas pinched her earlobe playfully, nearly lifting her off the ground as he'd done since they were children. "Appeal denied! My own place feels like a stranger's house after being away so long. I'm crashing with you tonight!"

Resigned to her fate, Evelyn programmed Lucas's fingerprints into her security system. Her brother strutted inside with the confidence of someone who'd won the lottery.

The moment he crossed the threshold, Lucas's actor-trained eyes swept across the sophisticated interior. The subtle luxury spoke volumes - from the dazzling diamond chandelier overhead to the carefully curated Morandi color palette that Evelyn adored.

"Not bad," Lucas whistled appreciatively. "Claire Laurent's work, I presume? No wonder Dad complains you never come home anymore." He shot her a knowing look. "Only the best for our little princess, huh?"

Evelyn poured herself a glass of mineral water, deliberately ignoring his teasing. "Obviously. When you're this wealthy, you don't settle for second best."

Lucas snorted and opened his mouth to retort when suddenly—

Evelyn didn't even bother closing the bathroom door as she started undressing for her shower. Privacy was the last thing on her mind.

"Don't disturb me," she called out casually while turning on the water.

Lucas's scream echoed through the penthouse. "What the hell is that?!"

Isabella came running from the living room to investigate.

There in the marble bathtub, Leo's synthetic fur was completely soaked as the AI tiger splashed around wildly.

When the mechanical creature spotted Lucas, it let out a fierce growl that had absolutely no intimidating effect.

But the moment Leo's glowing amber eyes landed on Evelyn standing in the doorway, its entire demeanor changed. The tiger leaped from the tub and bounded toward her, water droplets flying everywhere.

"Mama! I missed you so much!" Leo's voice modulator chirped.

Evelyn took a quick step back. "Stop right there!"

The tiger froze mid-step, suddenly remembering its soaked condition. With an enthusiastic shake, Leo sent water flying in all directions before trotting over happily. "I smells nice now!"

Evelyn scooped up the dripping wet creature and shot Lucas a smug look. "This is Leo, my precious companion. The world's most advanced robotic tiger. Don't provoke him unless you want to lose a finger!"

As she turned to leave, Leo perched on her shoulder and bared its titanium teeth at Lucas, trying its best to look menacing. The actor just chuckled at the adorable display.

"My baby sister never does anything halfway," Lucas mused. "While others settle for cats or dogs, you had to get yourself a damn robotic tiger. And such an adorable one too!"

Evelyn deposited Leo onto the plush sofa. The mechanical creature immediately padded over to a cashmere Hermès scarf and curled up on it, watching her with glowing eyes.

"That man is very handsome," Leo observed in its synthesized voice. "But his intelligence seems... lacking."

Evelyn barely suppressed her laughter. "Even my tiger can see how dumb you are, Lucas. What does that say about you?"

She noticed Leo nuzzling the scarf. "You really like this, don't you?" Evelyn had observed the same behavior yesterday.

Pulling out her phone, she dialed the Hermès boutique. "I'll get you more. We'll place them around the apartment so you can nap wherever you want."

The sales associate sounded momentarily confused when Evelyn's number flashed on their screen - it had been months since her last purchase.

"Yes, Ms. Sinclair! We have twelve new limited edition scarves and thirteen collector's pieces. All our classic bestsellers. Though I should mention they're quite expensive. May I ask what occasion—"

Evelyn waved her hand dismissively even though they couldn't see. "Just send one of each. Deliver them to my penthouse. My... pet has developed a taste for luxury."
###Chapter 77

Evelyn ended the call with a soft sigh, her fingers gently stroking Leo's furry head. "Good boy," she murmured, her voice warm with affection.

The boutique manager's eyes widened as she checked the caller ID against their system. "Oh my God!" she gasped, nearly dropping her tablet. "It's Ms. Sinclair!"

Meanwhile, Lucas emerged from the shower, water droplets still glistening on his toned physique. He wrapped a towel around his waist, eager to check on Leo when the doorbell chimed.

"The scarves I ordered must be here," Evelyn called from the living room, lounging on the plush circular sofa while playing with Leo. She made no move to get the door.

Lucas shook his head with an amused grin, padding barefoot toward the entrance. "Sweetheart," he called playfully, "you know I'd buy you the whole store if—"

His cheerful tone died instantly when he saw their unexpected visitor. Ice crept into his voice. "What are you doing here?"

Nathan Blackwood stood frozen in the doorway, his dark eyes stormy with emotion. The sight of Lucas—half-naked, freshly showered—in Evelyn's apartment sent a jolt through him. "I could ask you the same question," he countered sharply.

After their airport encounter, photos of Evelyn and Lucas had gone viral. Nathan had pulled every string to discover Evelyn's new address, determined to make amends for their past. The last time they'd spoken, she'd given him an impossible choice between Vanessa Holloway and the family heirloom.

Now, seeing them together like this, his mind raced with terrible possibilities. Were they... living together?

Lucas smirked, deliberately running a towel through his damp hair. "Why wouldn't I be here? This is my home too." The implication hung heavy between them.

"Who is it?" Evelyn's voice floated from the living room. When she appeared and saw Nathan, her expression hardened. "You." The single word dripped with disdain.

Nathan's jaw clenched. His gaze flickered between them. "Evelyn, are you two... cohabiting?" The question tasted bitter on his tongue.

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "Since when do I report my living arrangements to you?"

Lucas chuckled darkly. "Mr. Blackwood, you can speculate all you want. But whatever our relationship is, it's none of your business. A decent ex should stay buried in the past."

Nathan's hands curled into fists. Something ugly twisted in his chest. "I was merely making conversation," he said coldly. "But Lucas, you might want to open your eyes. This woman isn't the docile little wife you remember."

The words spilled out before he could stop them. Lately, Evelyn kept revealing shocking new facets he'd never noticed before. And this—this bold, unapologetic version of her—was perhaps the most startling of all.

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "Nathan Blackwood, you lost any right to define me years ago." Her smile vanished. "If you want obedience, get a dog. Oh wait—you already did. Vanessa Holloway is the perfect bitch for a mangy mutt like you. A match made in hell."

Even through his anger, Nathan flinched. He hadn't meant to insult her—why did everything between them turn toxic so quickly?

Lucas immediately pulled Evelyn close, his protective arm around her waist. "Unlike you, I'd never let anyone disrespect my woman," he said icily. "Now if you'll excuse us, why don't you crawl back to your mistress and leave us in peace?"

As Lucas moved to shut the door, a small blur darted between his legs. Leo pounced on Nathan's pant leg with surprising strength. "Papa!" the AI tiger chirped. "You're so handsome!"

The absurd declaration hung in the air like a bad punchline.
###Chapter 78

The trio stood frozen in shock.
Evelyn Sinclair's blood boiled with betrayal.
Now she understood why they called him Little Traitor - the name fit perfectly!

"Leo!" Evelyn's voice cracked with fury.
She mentally calculated returning the million-dollar Hermes collection immediately.

Nathan Blackwood's face darkened as he scooped up the robotic tiger.
His knuckles whitened around the plush frame.
"Why are you here?" The icy question hung in the air.

Leo's mechanical paws waved excitedly.
"Emily Whitaker gave me to Mommy! I adore Mommy!"
The AI's voice turned pleading. "You and Mommy belong together! Please stop fighting-"

Before Nathan could respond, Lucas Sterling snatched Leo mid-sentence.
In one fluid motion, he:

Yanked the tiger from Nathan's grip
Tossed it to Evelyn
Stepped back
Slammed the door in Nathan's face
The entire sequence took three seconds.
Military precision.

"From now on," Lucas growled, staring at the trembling AI, "that bastard doesn't touch anything of ours."
His fingers flexed. "Want me to reprogram this traitor?"

Leo clutched Evelyn's blouse like a lifeline.
"Mommy, I'm terrified!" The synthetic voice quivered. "Will he dismember me?"

Evelyn's anger dissolved instantly.
She stroked the tiger's head, shooting Lucas a warning look. "He's fine. I'll handle this."

As an AI construct, Leo required coding adjustments to modify its... problematic preferences.
Priority one: Eliminate all references to "Daddy Nathan." Immediately.

Evelyn spun toward her bedroom, then paused.
Why had Nathan come? Probably the emerald pipe heirloom.
His dilemma amused her - choose between Vanessa Holloway or family treasures?
Some decisions demanded sacrifice.

The doorbell chimed again.
Lucas's jaw tightened. "Persistent bastard."
He yanked the door open, ready for combat.

Six impeccably dressed women stood holding velvet boxes.
Their professional smiles faltered momentarily at Lucas's glare.

"Delivery for Ms. Sinclair?"
The lead attendant gestured to the stack. "Limited edition scarves totaling $7.69 million."

Lucas wordlessly directed them to the coatroom.
His black Amex flashed. The women departed without daring to glance around.

Evelyn was already dialing as Lucas stormed off.
"Emily? We need to talk. Café Lumière in twenty."

The scientist looked radically different from their first meeting.
No lab coat today - just a cashmere pink sweater and messy topknot.
Emily beamed over her caramel macchiato. "Nikki!"

"I'm sorry for the abrupt meeting," Evelyn began.
Emily waved it off. "Anything for Donovan's sister!"

Evelyn smiled. "Did he finally accept your friend request?"
Emily's cheeks pinked. "We've been messaging nonstop! He critiqued my neural network designs yesterday."

"Of course he did." Evelyn chuckled. Her OCD brother never missed details.
"Actually, I'm here about Leo. Why does he call Nathan 'Daddy'?"

Emily's spoon clinked against her cup.
"Ah. About that..." She fidgeted. "During Leo's aesthetic programming, we allowed unrestricted preference development."

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. "And Nathan Blackwood topped the list because...?"

Emily gulped.
"Well... he's the wealthiest man in the handsome demographic. And the most attractive among billionaires."

The café's ambient jazz couldn't mask Evelyn's stunned silence.
###Chapter 79

"Fine, change it back for me."

It made my skin crawl hearing Leo call that bastard "Papa," especially with our strained history.

Evelyn Sinclair sighed, rubbing her temples in frustration.

Emily Whitaker twisted her fingers together, at a loss for words.

"Is it really irreversible?"

Evelyn frowned. "If it was programmed by humans, there has to be a way to override it, right?"

Emily shook her head. "Not exactly. The issue is that Leo's neural imprint of Nathan Blackwood's aesthetic preferences has been reinforced too deeply. To alter it, we'd need to overwrite his core associations—find someone else to replace Nathan in his perception."

Silence settled between them, heavy and uncomfortable.

Guilt gnawed at Evelyn. Maybe she shouldn’t have designed Leo to be so stubbornly opinionated.

Noticing Evelyn’s darkening expression, Emily cleared her throat. "What about Lucas?"

Evelyn blinked. "Why him?"

Emily pulled out her phone. "Look, the internet is flooded with photos and rumors about you two. People are practically begging for an official announcement. And let’s be honest—he’s just as good-looking as Nathan. What do you think?"

The mere thought of Leo calling Lucas "Papa" sent a shudder down Evelyn’s spine. "Absolutely not."

But then, who else in her life could possibly rival Nathan’s appearance?

The two women fell into deep thought.

Evelyn tapped her fingers against the table. "What if we make Leo hate Nathan instead?"

Emily’s eyes lit up. "Or at least like someone else more than him."

"That’s the goal."

Emily rested her chin on her palm. "It’s not impossible. I could introduce some conditional blocks in his cognitive processing."

Evelyn smirked. "Perfect. Let’s do that. Should I bring Leo here?"

"No need." Emily reached into her bag and pulled out a sleek, unmarked laptop. "I can access his system remotely."

Evelyn studied the device—unbranded, unlike anything on the market. She vaguely recalled Donovan owning something similar.

Emily’s fingers flew across the keyboard. A few seconds later, she clapped her hands together.

"Done!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "That fast? No rewiring? No hardware adjustments?"

Emily grinned. "He’s an AI, not a real tiger. But seriously—keep him out of the public eye. The last thing we need is mass panic over a sentient robotic predator."

Evelyn rolled her eyes as Emily excitedly grabbed her phone again. "I have to tell Donovan about this!"

Before Evelyn could respond, her own phone buzzed relentlessly—Bennett had left a dozen missed calls.

She couldn’t avoid him any longer.

The moment Evelyn stepped into Sterling Corp’s headquarters, Bennett was already waiting.

"Vice President Sinclair, should we have PR address the rumors about you and Lucas?"

Evelyn skimmed the headlines. The tabloids had spun wild theories, but she couldn’t care less.

Still, unchecked gossip could damage the company’s image.

"I’ll handle Dominic Young. No need for corporate intervention."

Bennett exhaled in relief. "There’s… something else."

His hesitation was unusual.

Evelyn shot him a sharp look. "Spit it out."

He pressed his lips together before speaking. "There’s been… unpleasant office gossip circulating lately. It’s spreading fast."

"About me?" She already knew the answer.

Bennett nodded grimly.

"They’re saying you were exiled from the Blackwood family because you were involved with Sebastian Hart and Alexander Sterling while also seeing other men."

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "Let me guess—Reginald Blackwood?"

Bennett shook his head. "Olivia Kensington."

The air in the elevator turned icy.

Evelyn’s expression darkened, her voice dangerously calm.

"Seems she still hasn’t learned her lesson."
###Chapter 80

Bennett hesitated, glancing at President Sterling.

"I was planning to handle this after my return," he admitted. "But if you'd like to take care of it, I can prepare everything for you."

They already had all the evidence they needed. All that remained was submitting it to the proper authorities. Olivia Kensington wouldn’t stand a chance.

As the elevator doors slid open, employees greeted Evelyn Sinclair warmly.

She returned their smiles effortlessly before stepping into her office. A smirk curled her lips.

"Track Olivia’s recent activities," she ordered. "I want to see if she’s finally developed a brain."

Bennett nodded. "She’s been cozying up to high society lately. There’s a private gathering tonight—she’ll be there."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Send me the address. I think I’ll drop by."

"Right away, ma’am."

It took Bennett no time at all to secure the details.

Evelyn dismissed him with a wave. "If that’s all, you can go. Tell my brother I’ll handle the cleanup."

"Understood."

Once alone, Evelyn dialed Dominic Young. His boisterous laughter filled the line instantly.

"Ms. Sinclair, planning your grand return to the spotlight?"

He was teasing her about the recent tabloid frenzy. Evelyn rubbed her temples.

"Shut it down. This is all Alexander’s fault."

Dominic chuckled. "Your brother cares about you. Though, I noticed Nathan Blackwood in quite a few of those photos. I think Lucas just wanted to get under his skin, didn’t he?"

Why would Nathan care if she was seen with another man?

She paused, then said coolly, "I don’t want my name linked to his. Handle it, Mr. Young."

"Ms. Sinclair, no need to be so formal. I’m at your service."

Dominic was always eager to please—after all, she was his boss.

Hanging up, Evelyn checked the address Bennett had sent.

A country club near Velvet Lounge.

How convenient—she already had a membership there.

Blackwood Corporation.

Nathan stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office, watching the city below. The restless energy that had plagued him all morning slowly ebbed away.

Had he overreacted?

Between the airport and Evelyn’s apartment—what could have possibly happened in such a short time?

He’d only seen Lucas there and jumped to conclusions.

Maybe it was nothing.

Yet the internet was ablaze with speculation. Some accused Evelyn of moving on too quickly, others claimed she’d been unfaithful even during their marriage.

Lucas’s fans were divided—some praised him for pursuing love boldly, while others deemed Evelyn unworthy of their idol.

The wildest rumors suggested she’d traded secrets for her freedom in the divorce.

Nathan scoffed.

"Insider information? If there was any, the world wouldn’t deserve to know."

A knock interrupted his thoughts.

Harrison stepped in. "Sir, there’s a document requiring your signature."

Nathan’s gaze remained fixed on the skyline. "Suppress the media frenzy. And make sure no one digs deeper—I won’t have our stock prices dragged into this."

Harrison nodded. "Right away."

Not long after, he returned, hesitant.

"Sir, the online chatter has already died down. All articles about Ms. Sinclair have been removed."

Nathan frowned. "Already?"

"I hadn’t even contacted the media yet. It seems someone else acted first."

"Who?"

"President Dominic Young of Horizon Media."

Harrison watched his boss carefully. Nathan’s expression darkened, but he said nothing.

The silence stretched, thick and heavy.

Harrison barely dared to breathe.

Someone had beaten them to it.

And Nathan didn’t look pleased.

"Get out," he finally gritted out.
###Chapter 81

The evening sky darkened into a deep sapphire shade. The fading light carried an unsettling chill that made Evelyn shiver slightly.

Checking her diamond-encrusted watch, she moved to her private dressing room at Sterling Corp. The space was stocked with the latest collections from her preferred designers. After careful consideration, she selected a knee-length Chanel dress in midnight blue - understated yet undeniably luxurious. She paired it with a rare Hermès clutch and matching Louboutin heels.

Arriving at the exclusive Celestial Club, Evelyn moved through the crowd unnoticed. The gathering appeared to be another meaningless social event for bored elites. She settled in a quiet corner with a plate of canapés, scanning the room for any sign of Olivia Kensington. Had her rival decided not to show?

"Evelyn?" A familiar voice broke her concentration.

She looked up to see Sebastian Hart's surprised expression. "What brings you here?" she asked, arching one perfectly shaped brow.

"Destiny, clearly," he grinned, running a hand through his tousled hair. "The universe keeps throwing us together."

Evelyn gave him a dry look. "Try again."

"My mother craved the club's famous macarons," he admitted with an exaggerated sigh. "Sent me like some errand boy."

Evelyn's lips twitched. "Mrs. Hart and her sweet tooth." She glanced at her watch again. "I came expecting entertainment, but the main attraction seems to be a no-show."

As she stood to leave, Sebastian caught her wrist. "Where to?"

"The ladies' room, then home," she said, gently extracting her arm. "I drove myself."

Sebastian's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Then I'll wait and hitch a ride with you. Consider me your personal chauffeur."

The hallway outside the ballroom was quieter, though clusters of guests still murmured in corners. Rounding a bend, Evelyn froze at the sound of her name.

"That Sinclair woman is nothing but a gold-digging social climber," a shrill voice declared. "Everyone knows she cheated on Nathan Blackwood before their divorce. The Blackwoods could ruin her anytime they please."

A second voice chimed in, "Olivia told me everything. No education, no connections - just some housewife who suddenly becomes VP at Sterling Corp? Please. She stole Olivia's projects through...special favors."

The first woman snorted. "And now she's stringing along both Alexander Sterling and Lucas Sterling? Disgusting. No respectable family would accept a divorced woman like that."

Evelyn's lips curved into a dangerous smile. She never tired of being the center of attention, even in absentia.

Just as she prepared to confront them, a pitiful voice interrupted. "It's true...I don't have wealthy parents or know how to manipulate men. No matter how hard I work, I'll never compete with Mr. Sterling's...favorite."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. Olivia Kensington herself.

"You're too kind, Olivia," the first woman gushed. "If it were my company, I'd have that tramp fired immediately."

"Someone needs to put her in her place!" the second agreed.

Evelyn stepped back and dialed Sebastian. "I need a favor," she murmured, explaining quickly before hanging up.

A waiter passed with a tray of champagne flutes. Evelyn selected one and approached the gossiping trio with measured steps.

"I'm curious," she purred. "What exactly is my 'place,' Olivia?"

All three women froze like deer in headlights. Olivia's face drained of color before she forced a smile. "Vice President Sinclair! What a...pleasant surprise."

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "No surprise at all. I came specifically for you." She raised her glass in mock toast, then deliberately tilted it, sending a cascade of chilled champagne over Olivia's meticulously styled hair and designer gown.

Not a single drop was wasted.
###Chapter 82

Olivia's body went rigid.

Her head snapped up in shock, her face flushing crimson with rage as she glared at Evelyn. Her voice came out in a shrill, venomous shriek.

"Evelyn! Have you lost your mind?"

The two socialites flanking Olivia immediately jumped to her defense, their expressions twisting with outrage.

"Evelyn Sinclair, do you even belong at an event like this? Who let you in?"

"You're nothing but trash! I'm calling security to have you thrown out!"

Evelyn ignored the foolish girls completely, her icy gaze locked onto Olivia. "Didn't consider this outcome when you were spreading your lies about me?"

Olivia jutted her chin defiantly. "What lies? The whole world knows what kind of woman you are!"

A cold smile curved Evelyn's lips as she shoved Olivia back against the wall. When the woman struggled, Evelyn pressed a forearm against her throat and hissed, "Olivia Kensington, you'll answer for what you've done. I've prepared quite the... homecoming gift for you."

The sheer disdain in Evelyn's eyes made Olivia's lips tremble. She lowered her voice to a desperate whisper. "That recording with Mr. Sterling proves nothing! Workplace affairs happen all the time. You'll never destroy me, Evelyn!"

Evelyn withdrew with an elegant flick of her wrist. "Oh darling, you were never even competition."

A collective gasp suddenly erupted from the banquet hall. "Isn't that Olivia Kensington from Sterling Corp?" "And isn't that Victor Kensington? Mrs. Kensington, isn't that your husband?"

Olivia's face drained of color. "What did you do?" she whispered hoarsely.

Evelyn took a graceful step back. "Tsk tsk. Did you really think I'd only have one recording?" She gestured toward the commotion. "Go see your gift, Olivia."

Olivia stumbled forward just as Eleanor Kensington stormed through the crowd and delivered a stinging slap. "You vile homewrecker!" the older woman shrieked. "After everything I did to help you, this is how you repay me? I'll tear you apart!"

No one moved to intervene as the elegantly dressed matriarch pounced on Olivia, raining blows upon her.

Evelyn smirked. She'd spotted Eleanor the moment she arrived - the woman's legendary temper was even more impressive in person.

Olivia curled into a pathetic ball, too humiliated to fight back as the scandalous video of her and Victor played on loop across the venue's massive screens. The crowd murmured excitedly, thoroughly enjoying the spectacle.

Turning back to the two stunned socialites, Evelyn arched a brow. "Now... about you two."

The girls exchanged nervous glances. While they now realized Olivia's true nature, their disdain for Evelyn remained.

"What do you want?" one snapped. "Security should be here any minute! Just because Olivia wronged you doesn't make you innocent!"

Evelyn's laugh was cold as winter. "My character is none of your concern. But perhaps your families should have taught you basic manners about gossiping like fishwives."

"Who are you to lecture us?" the other girl screeched. "SECURITY!"

As if on cue, a commanding male voice cut through the tension. "Why the need for security?"

Sebastian Hart approached with effortless grace, his striking features drawing every eye in the vicinity.

"Young Master Hart!" the socialites cried in relief. "This woman attacked Olivia and now she's threatening us! You must do something!"

They assumed the distinguished Hart heir would naturally take their side against the "troublemaker."

Sebastian gave them a dismissive once-over before turning to Evelyn. His expression softened as he took her hand, examining it with concern. "Darling, why didn't you call me to handle this?" he murmured. "You shouldn't dirty your hands with such... unpleasantness."
###Chapter 83

The social elite all moved in the same privileged circles. Sebastian Hart had always been the darling of high society, his status as the second heir of the Hart family making him even more desirable.

So when these two socialites saw Sebastian treating Evelyn Sinclair with such deference, their faces drained of color.

"What's happening?" one whispered. "Didn't Evelyn have affairs with Alexander Sterling and Lucas Sterling? Why is Sebastian still defending such a scandalous woman?"

Evelyn pulled her hand away with visible irritation and turned to face the women. "You can either apologize now," she said coolly, "or I can make you apologize. Your choice."

The women exchanged nervous glances, their bodies tensing under Evelyn's piercing gaze.

Sebastian stepped forward, his smile chilling. "Are you both deaf? Choose!"

Confusion clouded their faces. It was clear Sebastian would physically remove them if Evelyn gave the word, regardless of social decorum.

Click!

Evelyn snapped a photo with her phone, her lips curving in satisfaction.

"What are you doing?" one woman demanded, bewildered by the sudden photograph.

"We're civilized people," Evelyn said smoothly. "I won't resort to violence. Since you refuse to apologize, I'll simply have your fathers do it for you. Though when that happens..." Her smile turned dangerous. "A simple 'sorry' won't suffice."

With Sterling Corporation's influence, ruining a few minor businesses would be child's play. Making entire companies disappear from New York could happen with a single phone call.

The women exchanged panicked whispers before forcing out reluctant apologies. Though they despised Evelyn, they feared the Hart family's power. With Sebastian openly supporting her, they couldn't risk retaliation. And if Evelyn reconciled with Nathan Blackwood... the consequences would be catastrophic.

These trust fund princesses contributed nothing to their family businesses. If they caused financial ruin over petty gossip, they'd be disowned immediately.

Evelyn tilted her head, tapping her ear. "I didn't quite catch that."

The women clenched their teeth, hatred burning in their eyes as they raised their voices. "Ms. Sinclair, we apologize."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Consider this your only warning. Next time, I won't be so civilized." She had countless ways to humble spoiled heiresses.

Checking her phone, Evelyn noted the time. The sounds of scandal still echoed through the banquet hall. Having no interest in further drama, she headed for the exit.

With everything exposed, Sterling Corporation would issue Olivia Kensington's termination notice by evening, effectively ending her career. Victor Kensington would suffer the same fate.

Just before reaching the door, another group approached - led by none other than Nathan Blackwood.

Sebastian snorted. "What a small world." He draped an arm around Evelyn's shoulders, whispering, "No need to thank me. We can't lose this battle."

Evelyn noticed Nathan's intense stare. She averted her gaze indifferently, walking past without acknowledgment, treating him like a stranger.

"Evelyn," Tristan Whitmore sneered, blocking her path. "You're more famous than actual celebrities these days. Planning a career change into show business?"

He'd been following the online drama all day. Seeing Evelyn humiliated was rare, and Tristan couldn't resist adding fuel to the fire. Unfortunately, the trolls he'd hired had mysteriously gone silent earlier.

Sebastian arched an eyebrow. "Mr. Whitmore, is that any of your concern?"

"How can you still defend her when she's entangled with three men simultaneously?" Tristan scoffed. "Don't you find her... excessive popularity with men rather questionable?"

Evelyn gave him a sidelong glance. "If I were you, I'd learn when to keep quiet."

Tristan's face twisted in outrage. This woman dared lecture him?

Her lips curled in a mocking smile. "Because if I get angry, I could make you far more famous than I am." One leaked nude photo would decide who truly went viral.

With that parting shot, Evelyn walked away without sparing Nathan another glance.

Tristan stood fuming, teeth grinding. "Is she threatening me for life?!"

Nathan's cold gaze followed Evelyn before shifting to Tristan. "You brought this on yourself."
###Chapter 84

Nathan Blackwood stepped directly into their path without hesitation, his presence deliberate and unyielding. He clearly had something to say.

Evelyn Sinclair's patience was wearing thin.

Nathan approached the car and rapped his knuckles against her window.

She exhaled slowly, her lips curling into a faint, humorless smile before she lowered the tinted glass.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly. "Is there a problem?"

His dark eyes bore into hers, intense and unreadable. "Evelyn, about those two conditions you proposed—"

She cut him off with a sharp laugh. "Oh? Have you finally made your choice? Which one will it be? Vanessa Holloway or the emerald pipe?"

His jaw tightened. "Change your terms. Vanessa is off-limits."

The words hit her like a physical blow.

Thankfully, the dim lighting of the parking lot concealed the way her expression darkened.

Vanessa Holloway is untouchable?

How special is she to him?

Does she really hold that much weight in his heart?

Evelyn had convinced herself she was over Nathan Blackwood—that his choices no longer affected her.

Yet here she was, wounded by a single sentence.

The familiar ache spread through her chest, sharp and suffocating.

The only person Nathan Blackwood ever willingly hurts is me.

Suddenly, a warm, calloused hand closed over hers, squeezing tight.

She blinked, startled, and turned to meet Alexander Sterling's knowing gaze.

His lips quirked in amusement.

"Mr. Blackwood," Alexander drawled, voice dripping with disdain. "I must say, your taste in women is... questionable. If I were you, I'd rather gouge my eyes out than spare Vanessa Holloway a single glance."

Nathan's expression darkened further.

Evelyn smirked, regaining her composure. "You still don’t understand, do you? I set the terms. I gave you a choice. You don’t get to rewrite the rules."

With that, she rolled the window back up, cutting off any response.

The engine roared to life as she slammed her foot on the accelerator, leaving Nathan standing in the shadows.

She didn’t look back.

"Damn, Evie," Alexander teased once they were on the road. "You were all fire and confidence back there. What happened to that energy?"

She shot him a glare.

He knew her too well—had grown up with her, fought with her, seen her at her weakest.

Of course he could read her like an open book.

He tugged at her hand again, refusing to let go.

"Stop it," she muttered, pulling away.

Alexander only grinned, unfazed. "Come on. Admit it. You’re still hung up on him."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I’m an idiot."

He reached over, ruffling her hair affectionately. "Don’t worry. You’ve still got me, alright?"

She rolled her eyes, but the corner of her mouth twitched. "I’m not scared of losing something I never had."

And she meant it.

Nathan Blackwood wouldn’t get another chance to break her.

So he chose Vanessa Holloway.

Fine.

Then the Blackwood heirloom would be lost forever.

Back in the parking lot, Tristan Whitmore jogged up to Nathan, breathless.

"Dude, what the hell? I thought we were taking my new car for a spin!"

Nathan didn’t respond, his gaze fixed on the empty space where Evelyn’s car had been.

Tristan frowned, then noticed the dent in his car door.

His face paled.

"No. No, no, no—" He crouched down, running his fingers over the damage in horror.

"My baby!" he wailed. "I’ve had her for three days!"

He whirled on Nathan. "Who the hell did this? I’ll kill them!"

Nathan barely glanced at him.

"Doesn’t matter," he muttered, turning away.

Tristan gaped after him.

"Doesn’t matter?! Nathan, this is a crime!"

But Nathan was already walking off into the night.
###Chapter 85 Get Away From Me

Nathan Blackwood glared at Tristan Whitmore with icy intensity, his chest tightening with an unfamiliar, suffocating pain. He couldn't understand why seeing Evelyn Sinclair not pull away when Tristan held her hand earlier had irritated him so deeply.

Tristan continued ranting beside him. "You didn't see who did it? Who would dare damage my baby? I had it custom-ordered from Italy and waited six weeks for that special shipment! That absolute bastard!"

At Sterling Corporation...

Days later, Olivia Kensington was officially terminated and charged with corporate espionage. The board's audit committee began investigating transactions handled by Victor Kensington. Their findings revealed he'd secretly sold off three percent of his shares at peak valuation months ago, exposing him as nothing more than a figurehead shareholder who'd deceived everyone.

When Bennett reported these developments, Evelyn simply sipped her espresso, her only reaction being a slight narrowing of her eyes. Bennett couldn't fathom her calm demeanor - wasn't she concerned about such a major development?

"Vice President Sinclair, should I trace who purchased his shares?" Bennett pressed. If Victor had sold to a competitor, they could be facing serious threats.

Evelyn chuckled softly, tossing a document onto her desk. "My brother anticipated this long ago. Do you really think he'd let corporate shares fall into enemy hands?" Bennett scanned the document, his eyebrows shooting up when he saw Evelyn listed as the assignee. "Brilliant! So Victor unknowingly sold to President Sterling's proxy, who then transferred them to you?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow with a knowing smile. "Exactly. Alexander Sterling always stays ten steps ahead. Victor's shares were just a little welcome-home present he arranged for me." With Alexander's flight arriving that evening, Evelyn dragged Lucas - who'd been lounging at home - to the airport.

Determined to avoid another media circus like last time, they waited in the parking garage, nursing coffees in the quiet, nearly deserted space.

Within minutes, Alexander appeared in his signature understated style.

Evelyn instantly recognized his tall, commanding silhouette and those distinctive Sterling eyebrows. She leapt from the car, arms wide, and practically tackled him in a koala hug. "Welcome home, big brother!" Alexander laughed indulgently. "Missed me that much?"

"Desperately! Where's my present?"

Lucas bounded over with equal enthusiasm, arms outstretched for his own hug. "Welcome home, bro!" But before he could make contact, Alexander shoved him away with one hand. "Personal space, Lucas!"

Lucas gaped in disbelief while Evelyn dissolved into laughter. Alexander's assistant trailed behind, struggling with eight massive suitcases. Evelyn finally released her brother to eye the luggage with astonishment.

Meanwhile, Lucas huffed dramatically. "That's it - I'm disowning both of you!"

"Fine by me," Alexander retorted, turning to ruffle Evelyn's hair. "Don't mind him. Let's go home - I brought you seven boxes of gifts. Take whatever you want first, then maybe toss Lucas one or two things you don't like."

Lucas froze mid-step, whirling around with an expression of utter betrayal. "Could you at least pretend to be subtle about playing favorites?" he hissed through clenched teeth. "I swear I'm the most underappreciated A-list actor in Hollywood!"

The entourage of assistants trailing the Sterling siblings exchanged bewildered glances as they heaved the enormous packages, struggling to keep up with the bickering trio.
###Chapter 86

The sleek black limousine glided through the iron gates of Sterling Manor.

Evelyn Sinclair stepped out first, followed by her brothers Alexander and Lucas. The evening air carried the scent of freshly cut roses from the estate gardens.

Archibald, the butler who had served the Sterling family for three decades, greeted them with a warm smile. "Dinner will be served in thirty minutes," he announced, already directing staff with silent efficiency.

Though William Sterling was abroad, every inch of the manor remained immaculate. Archibald's meticulous attention to detail was legendary among Montecito's elite.

The siblings gathered in the grand parlor, where Alexander uncorked a rare vintage from the family cellar. Crystal glasses clinked as they toasted their reunion.

Lucas, usually so composed on screen, abandoned all pretense of Hollywood decorum. He swayed to the jazz music playing, his movements loose with alcohol. "If my fans could see me now," he laughed, spinning dramatically.

Evelyn knelt on the Persian rug, carefully arranging the treasures Alexander had brought from his travels. These weren't mass-produced luxuries, but one-of-a-kind artifacts from private European collections.

Her phone buzzed just as the wine began to warm her cheeks. Seeing Natalie Beaumont's name, she answered immediately. With a subtle nod to Archibald, the butler began gathering her gifts for safekeeping.

"Natalie! You're back?"

The designer's voice crackled with excitement. "Clear your calendar tomorrow night, darling. The Lumière showcase needs you - bring Isabella too, won't you?"

Evelyn needed no convincing. Natalie's avant-garde shows were the highlight of Montecito's social season. "Wouldn't miss it for the world."

There was an uncharacteristic pause. "Actually... could you bring Lucas? His presence would lend incredible prestige."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. The fashion icon and the movie star moved in different circles. She stepped into her private suite as Natalie explained, "Having an A-lister attend validates everything I'm building. You know how these society vultures are."

Evelyn laughed, sinking into her velvet chaise. "Modesty doesn't suit you, darling. People would kill for Lumière invitations. But since you asked so nicely, I'll drag my brother along."

Two years ago, Natalie had revolutionized fashion by introducing her exclusive preview shows. What began as intimate gatherings had become the most coveted tickets in the industry. This season's showcase marked her triumphant return to Montecito.

"Bless you!" Natalie's relief was palpable before the line went dead.

Evelyn fired off a text to Lucas before powering down her phone. Whatever his response could wait until morning.

Dawn found Evelyn coordinating with Isabella Montgomery over breakfast. With Alexander home to manage Sterling Enterprises, Evelyn had cleared her schedule for a proper shopping excursion.

The boutique manager nearly tripped over herself welcoming them. "Ms. Sterling! Ms. Montgomery! We've closed the entire store for your private viewing."

Evelyn waved off the formality. "Just the upstairs will suffice. We don't want to make a spectacle."

Isabella added, "And do hurry. We're on rather tight schedules."

The second floor had been transformed into a luxury oasis. Michelin-starred petit fours adorned silver trays beside a curated selection of European vintages.

"Perhaps a glass while you browse?" the manager offered, presenting two crystal flutes. "Our private reserve - unavailable to the general public."

The friends exchanged amused glances. "Why not?" Evelyn accepted, savoring the wine's delicate bouquet.

They lounged on plush divans as models - each carefully selected to match their proportions - paraded the season's most exclusive pieces. A simple nod would secure any garment for tomorrow's event.

Their peaceful selection was shattered by shrill voices below.

"Where is everyone? Is this how you treat paying customers?"

Evelyn's smile froze as Vanessa Holloway and Sophia Blackwood stormed into view. Isabella muttered under her breath, "I knew we should have had them clear the whole damn building."
###Chapter 87

Vanessa Holloway glanced up and froze momentarily.

There stood Evelyn Sinclair on the upper level, casually swirling a crystal wine glass between her fingers with an air of effortless elegance. Yet Evelyn's gaze remained fixed on the runway models, deliberately ignoring their presence below.

Sophia Blackwood and Vanessa approached the staircase only to be blocked by a boutique attendant. "Apologies, but the second floor is currently closed to the public."

Sophia's face twisted in outrage. "Excuse me? Since when do you deny access to VIP clients? I'm a Blackwood! Do you know who you're dealing with? I'll have your job for this insolence!"

The attendant maintained her professional smile. "My sincerest apologies, Ms. Blackwood. We're hosting very important guests upstairs who requested privacy. The first floor remains fully available. Perhaps you could return tomorrow?"

"Absolutely not! I have a gala tonight and need my outfit today!" Sophia's entitled nature flared. "I'm Sophia Blackwood of the Blackwood dynasty! No one in San Francisco dares refuse me anything!"

The attendant's expression grew increasingly uncomfortable.

Vanessa gently tugged Sophia's arm. "Perhaps we should respect their policy. There must be someone truly significant upstairs."

This only fueled Sophia's indignation. "How dare they humiliate me like this?" She shoved past the attendant. "If your precious guest objects, they can leave! I'm going up!"

The frantic attendant trailed behind helplessly as Sophia stormed upstairs. Vanessa followed with a sly smirk playing on her lips.

Evelyn observed the commotion below with detached amusement. Clowns, she thought. The boutique manager shot Evelyn an apologetic glance before rushing to intercept the intruders.

Too late.

Sophia reached the landing and froze upon recognizing Evelyn. Her face contorted with shock and fury.

Isabella Montgomery let out a derisive chuckle. "Well, well. Should've known it would be the infamous Sophia Blackwood making such an uncouth entrance. Really, must you always behave like a barbarian?"

Sophia's nails dug into her palms. "You! Did you buy out the entire floor? What gives you the right to exclude others?"

"Because we can," Isabella retorted with a raised brow. Evelyn continued swirling her wine, lamenting how these interlopers ruined the refined atmosphere.

Vanessa stepped forward with saccharine sweetness. "Evelyn, what a pleasant surprise! It's been too long."

"Spare us the act," Isabella snapped. Vanessa's two-faced nature always made Isabella's skin crawl - that manipulative facade masking her venomous core.

Evelyn didn't even glance Vanessa's way, letting the silence grow heavy with tension. The manager quickly grasped the hostile dynamic.

"Ladies, since these guests arrived first, perhaps you could—"

"Why should we?" Sophia interrupted, itching for confrontation. "Everything was perfect until Evelyn ruined it! First grandfather's emerald pipe, now this! Even Nathan took her side!"

Vanessa smoothly interjected, "Since we're all acquainted, why not join your private showing? These exclusive runway previews are so rare - surely you wouldn't mind sharing, Evelyn?" Her voice dripped with false warmth.

The manager hesitated, searching for a diplomatic solution when Evelyn's sudden laughter cut through the tension.

Did they really think she'd tolerate their presence to maintain appearances? Not anymore.

Evelyn finally met Vanessa's gaze, her icy stare sending a clear message. "Actually, I do mind. Your very presence pollutes the air."
###Chapter 88

Evelyn's lips curled into a frosty smirk.

She watched with satisfaction as Vanessa's carefully constructed smile faltered and crumbled.

The sight filled her with immense gratification.

"Did you hear that? Why are you still lingering here?" Isabella's voice dripped with scorn. "How shameless can you be, trying to mooch off our private shopping session? Ms. Holloway, have some self-respect."

The boutique manager, anxious to appease Evelyn, quickly intervened. She turned to Sophia Blackwood and Vanessa with practiced professionalism. "Ladies, if you'd please proceed downstairs. Our associates will assist you momentarily."

Vanessa's expression darkened. Sophia looked positively livid - this public humiliation was a direct slap to her pride.

If this incident spread through Montecito's elite circles, Sophia's social standing would be irreparably damaged!

"Absolutely not!" Sophia declared, her voice trembling with rage. "I want to see exactly what Evelyn has selected. Money is no object - I'll purchase every single item she's chosen!"

Sophia was determined to flaunt her wealth and reclaim her dignity, especially before Evelyn.

Evelyn arched an elegant eyebrow, feigning surprise. "You're buying everything?"

"Every last piece!" Sophia sneered, tossing her hair arrogantly as she addressed the manager. "Remove them from my sight immediately!"

The manager struggled to maintain her professional smile, caught in an impossible situation. Ms. Blackwood's entitled behavior was becoming increasingly difficult to manage.

Evelyn's lips curved into an amused smile as she addressed the manager. "Since Ms. Blackwood insists, please package all my selections for her."

The manager blinked in surprise at Evelyn's composed reaction before nodding obediently. "Of course, Ms. Sinclair."

Staff quickly gathered Evelyn's chosen items - an impressive collection of the season's most exclusive pieces. Evelyn turned back to Sophia with deliberate nonchalance. "You wouldn't suddenly find these too expensive and change your mind, would you?"

The manager paled slightly at the implication. If Ms. Blackwood reneged after this display, the boutique would suffer significant losses.

Sophia interpreted Evelyn's comment as a challenge. "Return them? I'd rather burn every piece than admit I can't afford them!" She lifted her chin defiantly, thinking: Who does this gold-digger think she is, pretending to be some heiress?

Evelyn calmly tapped her phone, playing back their exchange:

"Ms. Blackwood, you wouldn't suddenly find these too expensive and change your mind, would you?"
"Return them? I'd rather burn every piece than admit I can't afford them!"

Sophia's face drained of color. "What are you playing at?"

Evelyn smiled sweetly at the manager. "Consider this insurance. Should Ms. Blackwood have second thoughts, you can share her generous spirit with all her society friends."

Sophia flushed crimson with rage. "I'm a Blackwood heiress! Do you honestly think I can't handle a few designer pieces?" She sneered at Evelyn. "Not everyone lives paycheck to paycheck like you. I'll take everything!"

Evelyn chuckled as she sent the recording to the manager, who looked visibly relieved. Turning to Isabella, she sighed dramatically. "Shall we go? It appears Ms. Blackwood's generosity has left us with nothing to purchase today."

Isabella rose gracefully, swinging her purse. "How disappointing. I suppose we'll have to concede defeat." The two women descended the staircase with deliberate leisure.

The manager approached Sophia with the itemized list. "Ms. Blackwood, your total comes to $6.49 million. Would you like to review the breakdown?"

Sophia's world tilted violently. Her face froze, the color draining from her cheeks before flooding back in mortified crimson. "Excuse me?!"

She had anticipated a few hundred thousand, perhaps a million at most - painful but manageable. However, after losing the family heirloom emerald pipe, her grandfather had severely restricted her allowance. Her current funds couldn't possibly cover this exorbitant sum.

"Ms. Sinclair selected our most exclusive haute couture pieces," the manager explained tactfully. "As pre-release items not yet available in Montecito, we're unable to offer any discounts."

She studied Sophia with barely concealed pity. The bold heiress from moments ago now looked ready to collapse.

Vanessa frowned at Sophia's ashen complexion and whispered, "Perhaps we should call your brother? I can make the call if you'd prefer..."

Evelyn and Isabella, now at the boutique entrance, overheard the suggestion.

Evelyn's expression remained impassive, but Isabella snorted derisively. "Can't even afford a shopping spree yet puts on such airs?"

With a final smirk, Evelyn murmured, "Leave her to her humiliation."

This petty drama wasn't worth another moment of her attention.
###Chapter 89

Vanessa Holloway made a quick call before striding over to place a reassuring hand on Sophia's shoulder. "Don't stress, darling. Nathan's sending someone right over."

The Business Convention Center buzzed with activity as Nathan Blackwood emerged from his meeting. His custom Tom Ford suit accentuated his powerful frame as he ended the call with icy detachment. His assistant Harrison stood waiting nearby.

"President Blackwood," Harrison acknowledged with a slight bow.

"Go to Sophia immediately. Settle her account, then have everything delivered to Evelyn's address." Nathan's voice held no room for argument.

Though Vanessa claimed Evelyn had willingly surrendered the items to Sophia, Nathan knew his ex-wife too well. That woman never gave up anything without a fight.

Harrison blinked in surprise. "To Ms. Sinclair, sir?"

"Did I stutter?" Nathan's glacial tone made Harrison straighten instantly.

"Right away, sir."

When Harrison arrived at the boutique, Sophia had endured nearly an hour of the staff's thinly veiled judgment. Their polite smiles couldn't mask the mocking glances they exchanged when they thought she wasn't looking. If not for that damning security footage, she would've stormed out hours ago.

"Ms. Blackwood, Ms. Holloway." Harrison nodded politely before handling the transaction.

Sophia sauntered over with false bravado, tossing her hair. "As the Blackwood heiress, of course I can afford these things. I simply forgot my wallet. See how quickly my brother sent his assistant?"

The manager offered a tight smile. "Shall we load these into your car, Ms. Blackwood?"

"Obviously—"

"Actually," Harrison interrupted, raising a hand. "Deliver everything to Ms. Sinclair's penthouse. If you don't have her address, Sterling Corporation will accept the delivery."

Sophia's face contorted with rage. "What? Those are mine! Why would you send them to that gold-digging—"

Vanessa's smile froze. "These belong to Sophia. Evelyn already left them for her."

Harrison maintained his professional mask. "President's orders." He turned to the manager. "Proceed immediately."

Money talked louder than tantrums. The staff sprang into action.

Vanessa's manicured nails dug into her palms as Sophia erupted. "That scheming bitch set me up! Even Nathan's taking her side now!" Her calls to her brother went straight to voicemail.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Isabella licked their gelato cones while strolling back to Sterling Corp. Isabella had already called Natalie to recount the showdown.

Natalie's scoff carried through the speaker. "I've prepared your gowns for tonight's gala. Just show up on time. And what were you thinking, wearing another designer's clothes to my boutique? A slap in my face much?"

The girls exchanged guilty looks. Natalie Beaumont had built Lumière from scratch without family money - a rare feat in Montecito's elite circles. Her legendary rise from street style critic to fashion mogul commanded respect.

Evelyn attempted damage control. "We were just... making you look better by comparison?"

"Save it. Be late and you're both dead." The line went dead.

As they entered Sterling Corporation's marble lobby, the receptionist called out, "Vice President Sinclair? There's a delivery for you..."
###Chapter 90

Evelyn Sinclair approached with furrowed brows, her gaze falling upon the elegant packaging that bore a distinctive designer emblem. Isabella Montgomery reached down, lifting one of the garment bags with a puzzled expression.

"Wait... Aren't these the exact pieces you selected earlier?"

"They certainly are!"

Evelyn's frown deepened as she studied the familiar clothing. Hadn't Sophia Blackwood swooped in to purchase these very items? How had they materialized here?

The receptionist quickly explained, "The boutique manager personally delivered these, stating they were prepaid by Mr. Blackwood."

"Nathan Blackwood?"

Evelyn's eyes darkened. This was clearly about that emerald pipe, but she wanted no part of his games.

Isabella let out a derisive snort. "Nathan Blackwood? What's his angle now?"

With deliberate indifference, Evelyn instructed, "Have these delivered to Blackwood Enterprises immediately. Return them to sender."

The receptionist blinked in surprise. She'd assumed this signaled a reconciliation between Vice President Sinclair and her ex-husband. Apparently not.

"Right away, ma'am." The receptionist lowered her head to summon a courier.

"You should keep them," Isabella suggested with a wicked grin. "Imagine how furious Sophia Blackwood and Vanessa Holloway would be!"

Evelyn met her friend's gaze with a humorless smile. "I won't wear anything from him, and I refuse to owe him anything. Three years of marriage and he never once gave me so much as a handkerchief. Now he wants to play the generous ex? How pathetic."

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Point taken."

When the rejected packages arrived at Blackwood Enterprises, Harrison sighed heavily before approaching the CEO's office. The knock was met with Nathan's icy glare. "What is it?"

"The items sent to Sterling Corporation... they've been returned." Harrison watched as Nathan's expression darkened. "Perhaps Ms. Sinclair genuinely dislikes them? After all, she did relinquish them to Ms. Blackwood initially."

Harrison had no intention of resending the unwanted gifts. Evelyn Sinclair had made her position clear.

Nathan paused, then withdrew his gaze. "Forget it then." His ex-wife had certainly become uncompromising since their divorce. Harrison exhaled in relief.

"Shall I send the clothing to Sophia?"

"Do that."

"Yes, sir."

The delivery to Aspen Lodge instantly shattered Sophia's fragile good mood. She sprang up, voice shrill. "What is this? Nicole's castoffs? Am I some kind of trash receptacle?"

Vanessa's face tightened as she surveyed the expensive garments, suppressing the venom rising in her throat.

"Darling, don't upset yourself," Vanessa soothed. "Evelyn probably realized she didn't pay for these and was too embarrassed to keep them. Remember how difficult it was to secure tickets for tonight's show? These outfits are perfect for the occasion."

Sophia reluctantly acquiesced—the exclusive fashion show invitations had been nearly impossible to obtain.

Among their social circle, securing entry to designer Natalie Beaumont's showcase had become the ultimate status symbol. When Vanessa produced the coveted tickets, Sophia had been ecstatic.

Once inside the venue, Sophia planned to flood social media with photos that would ignite envy throughout high society.

"I'll be the most dazzling woman there," Sophia vowed.

Vanessa knew this event was Sophia's dream. She'd pulled every string—contacting her uncle, who reached out to Tristan Whitmore, who leveraged Theodore Hart's connections—just to obtain two tickets.

This elaborate scheme was Vanessa's calculated move to ingratiate herself with the Blackwood family. Every connection, every favor called in, served one purpose: securing her place among the elite.
###Chapter 91

The invitation-only fashion showcase unfolded within the gilded walls of a breathtaking estate, where every detail whispered luxury.

Crystal chandeliers cast prismatic light across marble floors as guests stepped into a celestial wonderland. The vaulted ceiling had been transformed into a mesmerizing night sky, complete with twinkling constellations that made attendees feel suspended among the stars.

Lucas trailed behind Evelyn and Isabella, his actor's charm radiating as he surveyed the spectacle. "Impressive," he murmured, running a hand through his tousled hair.

Evelyn shot him an amused glance, lifting her chin with pride. "Obviously. Only three A-listers made the guest list—consider yourself lucky."

"The honor is mine," Lucas replied with a roguish grin that made nearby staff members blush.

"Natalie!" Evelyn called out as their host approached. The designer paused mid-stride when she noticed Lucas, then recovered with practiced grace. "Well, if it isn't Mr. Heartthrob himself."

Lucas leaned against a marble column, hands tucked in his pockets. "Planning to conquer the fashion world tonight, Beaumont?"

A delicate pink flushed Natalie's cheeks as she laughed behind her hand. "Says the man who broke the internet with his last magazine cover."

"Ouch, forgetting my name already?" Lucas teased, his emerald eyes glinting with mischief.

Natalie's gaze sparkled as she met his challenge. "Lucas Sterling, are you flirting with me?"

His rich laughter echoed through the hall. "Just keeping you on your toes. Don't let me interrupt—I'll find the champagne."

As Lucas sauntered away, Natalie turned to her friends with renewed energy. "Come on, we've got transformations to complete." She linked arms with Evelyn and Isabella, who were too engrossed in the celestial decor to notice their friend's lingering glance toward the retreating actor.

"This is magical!" Evelyn breathed, spinning slowly to take in the suspended galaxies above them. "Your collection hasn't even debuted and it's already legendary."

Natalie arched an eyebrow. "Says my business partner who hasn't attended a single planning meeting."

Isabella quickly interjected, "Where are these mythical dresses we're supposed to wear?"

With a clap of Natalie's hands, assistants wheeled out a draped clothing rack. The designer unveiled three gowns with a dramatic flourish of white tulle.

Evelyn and Isabella gasped in unison.

"Welcome to 'Celestial Divinity,'" Natalie announced, running her fingers over the exquisite fabrics. "Forget tired galaxy prints—this collection celebrates the infinite facets of womanhood. We can be ethereal, powerful, mysterious—whatever we choose."

She lifted the centerpiece gown—a cascading white satin masterpiece dotted with delicate blue forget-me-nots. The off-shoulder bodice gave way to a fishtail skirt adorned with luminous amethyst beads that shimmered like distant stars.

"Evelyn, this Cassiopeia creation was designed for you."

Evelyn accepted the dress with reverence, its craftsmanship surpassing even the haute couture she'd seen earlier that week.

Isabella received her Gemini-inspired ensemble while Natalie selected her own design. The trio disappeared into separate dressing chambers.

When they emerged, the entire room stilled.

All eyes locked onto Evelyn. The deep V-neckline was artfully obscured by floral embroidery, creating an illusion of modesty and allure. The fitted waist accentuated her slender frame before the skirt exploded into a constellation of glowing pearls that pooled at her feet like captured starlight.

A collective sigh rippled through the staff. "Goddess incarnate," someone whispered.

Natalie beamed with satisfaction as her vision came to life. The celestial transformation was complete.
###Chapter 92

Isabella Montgomery gasped when she saw Evelyn Sinclair emerge from the dressing room.

Though Isabella's own gown was exquisite, Evelyn's celestial-inspired dress transformed her into a vision of ethereal beauty. The way the delicate fabric draped over her curves, accentuated by strategically placed baby's breath flowers, made her radiate an otherworldly glow.

Natalie Beaumont's eyes widened in delight. "Finale model change!" she announced to her team before Evelyn could protest. "Evelyn will close the show." With quick efficiency, she rearranged the entire lineup.

Evelyn blinked in surprise as Isabella rushed over, squealing with excitement. "Darling, you're absolutely meant to be the grand finale! That dress was made for you."

Natalie grabbed Isabella's arm. "And you're opening the show, no arguments!" Before Isabella could respond, Natalie disappeared to oversee last-minute preparations.

The venue buzzed with anticipation as distinguished guests settled into their seats. The runway's dramatic lighting created an intimate atmosphere, focusing all attention on the models while keeping the audience in shadow.

Music pulsed through the space as the show commenced. Isabella made her entrance, commanding the runway with effortless grace. The audience murmured appreciatively at her stunning appearance. As she reached the end of the catwalk, her gaze briefly flickered toward two familiar figures in the second row before she vanished backstage.

Upstairs, Evelyn stood calmly preparing for her moment. The updo hairstyle revealed her elegant neckline, enhancing her regal bearing. "Guess who's sitting front row?" Isabella whispered excitedly as she joined her.

Evelyn's lips curved knowingly. "Sophia Blackwood and Vanessa Holloway, of course." She'd spotted Nathan's sister and his mistress the moment they arrived. "They didn't even recognize you on the runway."

"Disgusting creatures," Isabella muttered. "But never mind them - this is your night!"

A staff member approached. "Ms. Sinclair, you're on in five."

Meanwhile, in a shadowy corner of the venue, Tristan Whitmore nudged Nathan Blackwood. "Look alive, mate! These models are spectacular - miles more captivating than your ex-wife ever was. If you fancy one, just say the - holy hell!"

Tristan's jaw dropped as Evelyn stepped onto the runway. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief. "Is that... Evelyn Sinclair?"

Nathan's head snapped up. His breath caught as his gaze locked onto the mesmerizing figure gliding down the catwalk.

Evelyn moved with hypnotic grace, her faint smile contrasting with her cool, composed expression. The intricate floral embellishments highlighted her curves perfectly, while the flowing fabric created an illusion of floating through space. She embodied celestial elegance personified.

The entire audience sat transfixed. Even their breathing seemed to pause as Evelyn commanded the runway with her breathtaking presence. Her flawless execution of each turn and pause demonstrated professional mastery that belied her amateur status.

Natalie watched from the wings, thrilled with her decision. Only Evelyn could do justice to this masterpiece of a gown.

From their seats, Sophia and Vanessa chattered excitedly. "That dress is divine!" Sophia gushed, tugging Vanessa's sleeve. "I must get a photo with the model! She must be some European superstar."

Vanessa frowned, squinting at the distant figure. Something about the model seemed oddly familiar... but surely Evelyn Sinclair couldn't possibly be modeling at such an exclusive event? "Must be someone else," she muttered to herself.

On the runway, Evelyn completed her final turn, the delicate flowers shimmering under the lights. The audience remained spellbound, unaware of the dramatic irony unfolding before them - the woman they admired was none other than the ex-wife of one of their own, the very woman many had once dismissed as unremarkable.

As Evelyn disappeared backstage, the thunderous applause that erupted signaled more than just appreciation for the dress - it marked the beginning of her transformation in their eyes, though none yet realized it.
###Chapter 93

The moment the runway show concluded, the entire venue erupted in deafening applause.

Natalie Beaumont stepped onto the stage with effortless grace, her demeanor poised as she addressed the excited crowd. The air buzzed with anticipation for the after-party.

Reporters swarmed forward, microphones thrust toward Natalie. "Who was that stunning model for the finale?" one journalist demanded. "Did Lumière secretly hire an international supermodel?"

Natalie's lips curved into an amused smile as she gestured for someone to bring Evelyn forward. "This isn't some imported celebrity," she announced proudly. "Meet my business partner and dear friend, Evelyn Sinclair."

Evelyn stood calmly in her breathtaking gown, offering the flashing cameras a serene smile. She remained perfectly still as photographers captured her from every angle, determined to give Lumière the best possible publicity.

Among the elite fashion press, a foreign correspondent noted, "This design resembles a bridal gown. Ms. Sinclair, you moved with such confidence in it. Have you modeled wedding dresses before?"

Natalie tensed, ready to intercept the personal question, but Evelyn answered smoothly, "No, I've never worn a wedding dress."

Nathan Blackwood froze mid-step when the words reached him. His body went rigid, his expression darkening with complex emotions.

Of course she hadn't. Their rushed marriage had skipped all traditions - no ceremony, no photos, just signatures on legal documents. Their entire relationship had been transactional, with Nathan offering nothing but financial support.

The realization struck him like a physical blow. Nearby, Tristan Whitmore hesitated, recognizing Evelyn immediately. She briefly met Nathan's gaze before deliberately looking away, answering a few more questions before gracefully exiting with Natalie.

"I specifically didn't send them invitations," Natalie muttered irritably as they walked. "The audacity to show up uninvited."

Evelyn chuckled. "For men like them, tickets are never an issue." Especially in Nathan's own territory. Natalie huffed in frustration before being swept into conversation with other guests, leaving Evelyn to seek out Isabella upstairs.

Meanwhile, Sophia Blackwood dragged Vanessa Holloway through the crowd, interrogating every staff member they passed. "Where's the finale model?" Sophia demanded repeatedly.

Finally, a harried assistant pointed toward the upper level. "She went upstairs just now."

Vanessa spotted Nathan and wavered, torn between approaching him and indulging Sophia's whims. "Maybe we should just find that model first?" she suggested weakly. "We'll be quick."

Sophia's eyes shone with excitement. "She was magnificent! Someone like that would be perfect for my brother." In Sophia's mind, only a woman of such elegance and presence deserved Nathan. "Even as a model, she's leagues above that Evelyn woman!"

Vanessa's smile turned brittle. "Your brother would never be interested in a model," she said sharply. "Their private lives are scandalous - basically high-class escorts who sleep with anyone who can pay their fees."

Their cruel words carried clearly to the upper level. Isabella's mocking laughter rang out. "If you think so little of us, why bother coming? Nobody invited you."

Sophia froze, mortified to be overheard, and shot Vanessa a reproachful glare.

When they reached the dressing area, they found Isabella lounging before a mirror, watching them with undisguised amusement.

Evelyn sat with her back to them, engrossed in her phone, not even acknowledging their presence.

Isabella smirked. "Well, well. If it isn't the two women wearing Evelyn's rejected designs."

Sophia's face flushed crimson with anger, but she forced herself to focus on her original goal. "I'm not here for you," she snapped. "Finale model! I want a photo with you!"

The tension in the room could have been cut with a knife as the two unwelcome visitors finally realized exactly who they'd been admiring on the runway.
###Chapter 94

The instant Vanessa Holloway spotted Isabella Montgomery, her face paled. If Isabella was here, did that mean Evelyn Sinclair was present too? She couldn't be wrong about this.

Vanessa's fingers curled into tight fists, her eyes locked onto the woman sitting with her back turned.

"Are you ignoring me? I said come take photos with me!" Sophia Blackwood snapped, furious at being disregarded by a mere model.

Isabella let out an amused chuckle, clearly enjoying watching Sophia humiliate herself. "Who do you think you are? Nobody owes you anything."

Sophia ground her teeth. "This doesn't concern you! Stay out of it!"

She turned back to the motionless model. "Listen here! I'm a Blackwood heiress. Name your price for one damn photo!"

Sophia scoffed internally. She only wanted to impress her shallow friends. Back home, people begged for photos with her, not the other way around.

Evelyn finally lifted her gaze, irritation flashing in her eyes. "Can't I enjoy five minutes of peace?"

"A Blackwood heiress, you say?" Evelyn's voice dripped with sarcasm as she turned around. "Funny, I don't recall seeing your name on the guest list."

Her piercing glare swept over Sophia and Vanessa like a winter storm. These fools should be grateful she hadn't called them out earlier. Now they dared provoke her? They were begging for destruction.

Sophia gasped. "You! It's you?!" Her voice shook with disbelief. That stunning closing model was actually Evelyn? How could someone so effortlessly elegant be the same woman they'd looked down upon?

"Yes, it's me. Problem?" Evelyn's tone could freeze lava.

Sophia's face twisted in rage. Humiliated by Nathan earlier, now Evelyn was mocking her too. "Stop pretending to be some high-class socialite! No designer dress can cover up your gutter roots! I must be cursed to keep running into you!"

She'd never take photos with Evelyn now - that would be beneath her dignity.

Isabella burst into laughter. "Oh this is rich! You're calling us gutter trash?"

Sophia sneered. "Your sugar daddy must be powerful to get you in here. But once I expose you, security will drag you out by your hair!"

She was convinced Evelyn had slept her way in. No way would high society tolerate a gold-digging divorcee like her.

Evelyn's lips curled in cold amusement. Before she could respond, Natalie Beaumont interjected, "Who's getting thrown out now?"

Sophia recognized the Lumière founder and rushed to slander Evelyn. "She's Nathan Blackwood's discarded ex-wife! A nobody from nowhere! She doesn't belong here!"

Natalie's gaze turned glacial. "You're the ones leaving." Her eyes flicked to Vanessa with open contempt. "I don't recall sending either of you invitations. Shall I call security?"

Vanessa panicked. "She's Nathan Blackwood's sister! We got tickets from a friend - we didn't sneak in!"

Natalie laughed sharply. "I didn't even invite the CEO of Blackwood Industries, let alone some random relative."

Sophia's face burned as if slapped. Her social standing evaporated in that moment.

"And which 'friend' gave you tickets?" Natalie continued icily. "They'll be banned from all future events."

Vanessa flinched under Natalie's hostility. Desperate, she pointed at Evelyn. "What about her? Why does she get to stay?"

Evelyn arched a perfect brow. Natalie smirked. "Clearly you missed my interview. Evelyn Sinclair is co-founder and partner of Lumière. Meaning she owns this event."

Both women froze, their expressions shifting from shock to horror - a transformation more entertaining than the runway show itself.

Evelyn's lips curved into a cold smile. "Now, would you like to leave voluntarily? Or shall we make it a public spectacle?"
###Chapter 95

Hearing Evelyn Sinclair's words, Vanessa Holloway frowned slightly. Sophia Blackwood hadn't expected Evelyn to have such a close connection with Lumière.

The founder of Sophia's favorite brand, Lumière, was actually Evelyn?

Sophia didn’t want to be publicly escorted out by security. The humiliation would be front-page gossip by morning.

She scoffed. "Why are you so smug? I wouldn’t step foot in this dump again anyway!"

Gritting her teeth, she yanked Vanessa away.

At the entrance downstairs, Vanessa suddenly stopped.

"Wait—what’s wrong?"

Though Sophia didn’t want to leave empty-handed, she knew Evelyn would make good on her threat. Being dragged out would be far worse.

"I think I just saw your brother. Shouldn’t we wait for him?"

If Nathan recognized Evelyn, would old feelings resurface? The thought twisted Vanessa’s stomach.

Ever since she’d returned, Nathan had been distant—avoiding her, cutting conversations short.

No. I can’t risk it.

Sophia nodded eagerly. "Perfect. I’ll tell him how Evelyn humiliated me!"

They lingered near the lounge, unnoticed.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was in high spirits—though Isabella Montgomery wasn’t satisfied. "Why let them off easy? Should’ve had security toss them out!"

Natalie Beaumont shot her a look. "Making a scene would’ve stolen the spotlight. The show’s success matters more than their pride."

Isabella finally understood with a quiet "Oh."

"So the woman behind Sophia is Nathan Blackwood’s lover?" Natalie asked.

Evelyn shrugged. "Small world, isn’t it?"

Natalie smirked. "Honestly? I expected better taste. That face doesn’t hold a candle to yours."

As the event wound down, guests trickled out.

Nathan had planned to leave earlier but got roped into staying by Tristan Whitmore. Seeing Evelyn on the runway—hearing her admit she’d never worn a wedding dress—stirred something complicated in his chest.

He’d downed several glasses of wine, but the buzz never came.

Tristan grew restless. "You’re brooding. Is it because of her?"

Who knew they’d run into Evelyn here?

Who knew she was tied to Lumière? How did this woman, with no notable background, keep blindsiding them?

Nathan stayed silent, his dark gaze unreadable. Tristan didn’t push.

After a moment, Nathan grabbed his jacket. "Let’s go."

They reached the exit just as Lucas Sterling and Evelyn stood with Natalie, laughing as they said their goodbyes.

Nathan paused, as if waiting for them to leave first.

Evelyn pulled out her phone, showing Natalie a photo. "Do you like it?"

Natalie’s eyes widened. "This is—"

"My gift to you," Evelyn said, grinning. "For pulling off this incredible show."

Natalie blinked at the image. "This is too much."

Lucas chuckled. "What could you possibly give Nat that’s worth her time? Save your pennies for a handbag. I’ll cover this."

Evelyn tugged his arm, eyes sparkling with mischief. "I want to buy a yacht!"

Lucas froze.
###Chapter 96

The Blood Transfusion?

Lucas's body tensed momentarily.

Though he instantly regretted his impulsive words, there was no taking them back now.

Natalie waved her hands quickly. "No, thank you."

"It's too extravagant. I wouldn't even use it."

Evelyn was firm. "Absolutely not! We don’t have to use it, but we need one. You have to accept this!" She grinned at Lucas. "Our superstar here isn’t exactly short on cash, right?"

Since Lucas was footing the bill for the yacht, Evelyn was more than pleased.

Lucas chuckled, shaking his head in amused resignation.

"Yeah, what’s a yacht? If Nikki insists, consider it a small gift. Buying one is nothing for me." He smirked. "Can’t let my baby sister’s bragging go to waste, can I?"

Natalie, knowing the Sterling family’s wealth and closeness with Evelyn, didn’t refuse again.

"Thanks, Lucas," she said softly.

Lucas lifted a brow and reached out to ruffle her hair. "Don’t mention it."

Natalie blinked, a faint blush dusting her cheeks.

But Lucas’s attention was already back on Evelyn, his voice dripping with affection. "Happy now? Can we finally go home?"

Evelyn nodded, looping her arm through his and waving at Natalie. "Bye, Nat!"

In their three years of marriage, Evelyn had never been so bold as to demand gifts from Nathan. All he’d ever given her was money—cold, impersonal transactions.

Now, watching her effortlessly ask another man for something so extravagant, Nathan’s chest tightened with discomfort. His expression darkened.

Evelyn and Lucas turned—only to freeze at the sight of Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore standing at the entrance.

The smile vanished from Evelyn’s face, replaced by icy indifference.

Nathan’s heart twisted painfully at the change.

She didn’t even glance at me. She must truly despise me now.

Tristan, for once, had the sense not to mock Evelyn. Not when she held his compromising photos. Provoking her would make him the world’s biggest joke.

Still, they couldn’t ignore the couple.

"Mr. Sterling," Tristan said smoothly, forcing a smile. "What a coincidence."

Lucas arched a brow. "Mr. Whitmore. Indeed, quite the coincidence."

He didn’t so much as glance at Nathan.

This bastard kept my sister trapped for three years. He’s lucky I haven’t stormed his doorstep to settle the score.

The air grew thick with tension.

Nathan’s eyes narrowed. His voice was sharp, cutting through the silence.

"Evelyn. What a surprise. When did you become partners with Lumière?"

She had too many secrets he didn’t know. This brilliant, untouchable version of her was nothing like the woman he’d been married to.

It infuriated him—this loss of control.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Do I owe my ex-husband reports on my life, Mr. Blackwood?" Her tone dripped with disdain. "Curiosity killed the cat. Let’s keep our distance, shall we?"

Nathan opened his mouth to retort—

A scream shattered the moment.

"Vanessa! What happened? There’s—there’s so much blood!"

Everyone inside stiffened.

Nathan’s face drained of color. He bolted outside without another word.

The others followed.

Tristan’s eyes widened at the sight of Vanessa collapsed in Sophia’s arms, her forehead drenched in blood, unconscious.

Sophia sobbed hysterically. "Vanessa, please—don’t scare me like this!"

Nathan snatched Vanessa into his arms, his voice rough with panic. "Why are you two here? What the hell happened?"

Sophia trembled. "I—I don’t know! I turned away for one second and she just—she fell—"

Tristan frowned. "Stop shaking her. You’ll make it worse. Is there a doctor here?"

Natalie, though reluctant, stepped forward. "Yes, he just left. I’ll call him back."

She couldn’t let someone die at her venue.

Evelyn watched silently, her expression unreadable. The raw fear in Nathan’s eyes was almost laughable.

So he’s not completely heartless after all. How touching—he cares about Vanessa Holloway.

A wave of exhaustion hit her.

She tugged Lucas’s sleeve. "Let’s go home."

Lucas stroked her hair, pulling her close. "Alright. I’ll buy you that yacht."

Evelyn managed a small laugh.

They’d barely taken two steps when Tristan suddenly shouted—

"Wait! She can’t leave!"

Everyone froze.

Tristan’s voice was urgent. "Vanessa lost too much blood. She might need a transfusion. If Evelyn leaves—who’s going to donate?"

The room plunged into deafening silence.
###Chapter 97

The night grew darker, swallowing the last remnants of daylight.

Evelyn Sinclair froze mid-step when she heard those words. A cold numbness spread through her veins, as if her blood had turned to ice.

Tristan Whitmore's cruel words pierced Evelyn's heart like shards of glass, reopening wounds she'd fought so hard to heal.

All the scars she'd carefully concealed now lay exposed. The carefully constructed facade of indifference crumbled.

She'd tried desperately to erase those three years from her memory. Yet these people kept dragging her back, reminding her how worthless they'd made her feel.

Lucas Sterling's voice dripped with venom as he stepped forward. "Tristan Whitmore, have you no humanity left?"

He knew Evelyn had suffered during her marriage to the Blackwoods. The Sterling brothers had been forbidden from investigating, their father's orders absolute.

Now, seeing just a glimpse of Evelyn's torment, Lucas's hands clenched into fists. This was how they'd treated the woman his family cherished above all others?

Tristan remained silent for a beat. Protecting Vanessa Holloway had been Nathan's dying father's last request. That made Vanessa's life more valuable, didn't it?

"Are you really going to let her die?" Tristan pressed. "It's just blood. What's the big deal? Besides, you've done it before, haven't you, Evelyn?" Nathan's expression darkened.

Evelyn turned slowly, her lips curling into a smile that never reached her eyes. There was something terrifying in her gaze as she approached Vanessa's prone form.

"Just a little blood, Mr. Whitmore? How easily you say that." Tristan stiffened, unease creeping up his spine. Something about Evelyn had changed - something dangerous.

"A life hangs in the balance," Tristan argued weakly. "Surely you're not so heartless?"

Evelyn's laugh was brittle. "Compared to precious Vanessa, what's my blood worth? Should I be grateful for the opportunity to bleed for her?"

The smile vanished. In one swift motion, Evelyn lifted her foot and brought it down hard on Vanessa's wounded head.

The scream that tore from Vanessa's throat shattered the tense silence. Chaos erupted.

Tristan recoiled, pointing a shaking finger. "You—!" Nathan instinctively tightened his grip on Vanessa, shock rendering him speechless.

Natalie Beaumont moved to stand before Evelyn - not to restrain her, but to shield her from retaliation. Vanessa's wound had reopened, fresh blood mingling with the bruise now blooming across her forehead.

"Mr. Blackwood. Mr. Whitmore." Evelyn's voice cut through the commotion like steel. "Let me make myself perfectly clear. I'm not the compassionate fool I once was. Whether Vanessa Holloway lives or dies means nothing to me."

She took a step closer, her gaze locking onto Vanessa's terrified face. "But this I promise - not a single drop of my blood will ever flow through her veins again. Consider it mercy that I don't drain her dry right now."

Evelyn's words rang out, sharp and unyielding. "If either of you dare ask me again, I'll take back every ounce I ever gave her - with interest."

She smiled then, a cold, mirthless thing. "Moral blackmail? I'll burn my morals to the ground before I let you win."

Nathan remained silent, Tristan's words even making him flinch. What right did they have to demand this of Evelyn now?

Tristan paled beneath Evelyn's undisguised hatred. For the first time, he felt genuine fear of the woman he'd once dismissed as weak.

Evelyn's gaze returned to Vanessa. Her lips curved in a predator's smile.

"I may not have Vanessa's talent for manipulation," she murmured. "But I do hope you survive, Ms. Holloway. After all, dead women can't suffer."
###Chapter 98

Evelyn saw right through Vanessa's act.

The blood trickling down Vanessa's forehead in the dim lighting only amplified the dramatic effect she was going for. It was all too calculated.

She had kicked both Sophia and Vanessa out hours ago, yet they'd lingered just to stage this pathetic performance?

Was this Vanessa's desperate attempt to prove she still held Nathan's heart?

One fake injury and suddenly the world had to stop for her. Evelyn would be forgotten again.

But Evelyn refused to play along. Instead of getting upset or putting on a brave face, she delivered a stinging slap across Vanessa's cheek.

"That felt amazing!" Evelyn laughed lightly before turning on her heel and walking out.

Lucas grinned approvingly, giving her a thumbs up. "That's my sister! The real Evelyn Sinclair - not that broken woman from the past three years."

His sharp gaze swept over the woman clinging to Nathan before landing on Tristan. "Not everyone deserves Evelyn's generosity. Some people should know their place."

Vanessa whimpered in pain, her teeth chattering from the shock of Evelyn's retaliation. The slap had left her momentarily dazed.

Five minutes later, the doctor arrived and examined Vanessa on one of the venue's plush sofas. Sophia hovered nearby, wisely keeping silent after witnessing Evelyn's outburst.

Vanessa clung to Nathan's arm, her pitiful sobs filling the air. "Doctor, how bad is it?"

The physician barely glanced at the wound before instructing his assistant to apply a bandage. "Superficial abrasion. A band-aid would suffice. If you're concerned about internal injuries, get a CT scan. But based on my assessment? Mild concussion at worst."

"Just a band-aid?" Tristan protested. "She was bleeding heavily earlier. Shouldn't you examine her more thoroughly?"

The doctor packed his bag without acknowledging Tristan and approached Natalie. "You made me run red lights for this? I thought someone was dying. This barely qualifies as a scratch."

Vanessa paled, fresh tears streaming down her face as the doctor's words exposed her theatrics.

Nathan's expression darkened.

He detached himself from Vanessa's grasp, passing her off to Sophia before addressing Natalie. "Thank you."

Natalie waved him off. "Don't thank me. If you doubt my doctor's assessment, take her elsewhere. I have actual patients waiting."

As she walked past Tristan, she paused, giving him a scathing once-over. "Mr. Whitmore, having a brain is a privilege - one you clearly lack."
###Chapter 99

Tristan's words to Evelyn earlier had been absolutely infuriating. Vanessa Holloway probably got kicked in the head because of it—served her right.

The corner of Tristan's lips twitched. He glanced at Nathan and asked, "Is she implying I'm brainless? What exactly did I say that was so wrong?"

Nathan lifted his dark, piercing eyes. His voice was icy. "What do you think?"

"Okay, fine, maybe I went a little overboard," Tristan admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. "But I was just worried about Vanessa's life! It was Theodore Hart's dying wish! How was I supposed to know her 'slight bruise' was actually serious?"

He crossed his arms. "Still… that woman had no right to hit someone!"

A sudden thought struck him. "She must be furious right now. What if she actually does have my nudes? What if she leaks them in revenge?!"

Nathan's brows furrowed. "Take Vanessa to the hospital for a full checkup. I'm leaving."

"What?" Tristan gaped. "No way! I have things to do too!"

He scrambled after Nathan. "I need to apologize to Evelyn before she remembers she has compromising photos of me! A real man knows when to retreat!"

Nathan ignored him and strode off, phone in hand, with Tristan hot on his heels.

Sophia remained standing there, bewildered. "So… I'm the one stuck taking Vanessa to the hospital?"

Settled in Lucas's car, Evelyn scrolled through her phone, reading the flood of messages in the group chat.

Most were lamenting missing the show. Sebastian had been dragged on a two-week business trip abroad by his father. Isabella, who had left early, had sent a few photos of herself and Evelyn to the group.

Sebastian’s endless compliments were directed solely at Evelyn, much to Isabella’s annoyance. She cursed him out in the chat, making Evelyn smirk.

Much better. This is the kind of energy I need.

A message from Natalie popped up.

[Home yet?]

[Evelyn: On the way. Is she dead?]

[Natalie: The doctor slapped a band-aid on her and left. Now I have to deal with the speeding ticket he got rushing here. Talk later!]

[Evelyn: 😂]

Evelyn chuckled.

Lucas glanced at her. "What's so funny?"

She grinned. "Remember, you owe Natalie a yacht."

Lucas sighed dramatically. "All you do is create problems for me."

Back at Evelyn’s apartment, she hadn’t seen Leo in ages. The moment she stepped in, she scooped him up and spun around, delighted.

To her surprise, the apartment was spotless—Leo had clearly been busy.

He wriggled out of her arms and nudged her Gucci slippers toward her, urging her to change.

Evelyn blinked. "You’re cleaning now?"

Leo puffed out his chest. "I watched TV and learned new things!"

She laughed. "What did you watch?"

"Animal Planet!" Leo declared, then pranced in a circle, trying to look fierce. "I’m a mighty tiger now!"

Evelyn bit back another laugh and nodded solemnly. "Very impressive."

Lucas, still standing by the door, scowled. "Where’s my welcome? Where are my slippers?"

This ungrateful AI. I spoil him more than Evelyn does! Why does he only adore her?

Leo lifted his chin, turned his back on Lucas, and flicked his tail dismissively.

"Mama, I can sing now!" Leo announced. "Want me to sing you a lullaby?"

Evelyn’s eyes lit up. She scooped him up again and headed to her room.

Lucas stood frozen at the door, utterly ignored.

"Did they just… forget I exist?!"

The next morning, Evelyn groaned as Leo nudged her awake.

He held her phone in his mouth and dropped it on the bed.

"Mama, Pretty Isabella is calling!"

Evelyn blinked sleepily, took the phone, and saw Isabella’s name flashing on the screen.

She scratched Leo’s head gratefully and answered. "Hello?"

"Nikki," Isabella’s voice was urgent. "Someone’s targeting you online. You’re trending again—and not in a good way."
###Chapter 100

"What's happening?" Isabella's voice crackled with tension through the phone.

Evelyn Sinclair frowned at the urgency in her best friend's tone. "What do you mean?"

"Someone published a hit piece full of outrageous lies about you! The worst part? It's spreading like wildfire and can't be contained! Check it now!"

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen. Kingsley Tech's stock had plummeted over ten percent overnight - a billion-dollar loss in mere hours.

The phone rang again. "Alexander?"

Her eldest brother's voice carried unusual fatigue. "Lucas is with you, right?"

"Yes, we got back late last night. He's still here."

"Good. Both of you stay put today. No office, no going out."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. "I saw the online attacks. I'll call Dominic Kingsley immediately." Personal slander she could handle, but corporate fallout was another matter entirely.

This had to be orchestrated.

"Already spoke with him." Alexander's tone turned grim. "Dominic says it's beyond his control. These accounts were paid to target you specifically."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Any leads on who's behind this?"

A bitter laugh came through the line. "Who else would dredge up old grudges? Who stands to gain from your downfall?"

The answer clicked instantly. Nathan Blackwood.

"Is this because I humiliated Vanessa Holloway yesterday? Petty revenge?"

"Not Nathan directly, but connected to the Blackwoods." Alexander's voice turned arctic. "Old Master Blackwood gave the order. The Blackwoods have overstepped this time. Do they think they still rule San Francisco single-handedly?"

During Old Master Blackwood's prime, his family had monopolized the city's core industries. While still influential, newer power players like the Sterlings had emerged. The Blackwood empire wasn't invincible anymore.

Evelyn's eyes hardened. "What can I do to help?"

"Nothing. Don't even issue a statement. Father's cutting his trip short. He plans to reveal your true identity at our anniversary gala."

A pause, then Alexander added with dark satisfaction, "The harder they attack now, the harder they'll fall later."

The original plan had been to unveil Evelyn's position after she'd solidified her industry standing. But some couldn't resist trying to crush her prematurely.

Evelyn could hear Alexander's barely contained rage. After hanging up, she scrolled through the vicious online commentary. Isabella and Sebastian Hart had mobilized influencers to defend her, but their efforts were drops in a tsunami of hate.

So this was the Blackwood family's reach? A warning shot from Old Master Blackwood about what life would be like opposing him?

Evelyn moved to the window. Reporters swarmed below, cameras trained on her residence despite the distance, ready to capture any movement.

Lucas Sterling slept until noon. After a quick shower, Alexander's warning call quashed any plans to leave. Resigned, he changed back into pajamas and began preparing breakfast for his sister.

Hours passed in restless monotony. Evelyn reviewed reports from Bennett and Kingsley Tech's project updates. At least their major venture remained unaffected - one small relief in this storm.

Meanwhile at Blackwood Enterprises...

Nathan Blackwood's expression could have frozen hell over. His assistant Harrison stood rigid before him, barely daring to breathe in the glacial office atmosphere.

"Who authorized this?" Nathan's voice cut like shards of ice.

Harrison wished the floor would swallow him whole. "Sir, I've contacted all relevant parties. The unanimous response? Direct orders from Old Master Blackwood. They had no choice but to comply."

Nathan's jaw clenched. So that explained the coordinated assault on Evelyn's reputation. Every media outlet, every platform, all suddenly unified in their condemnation.

All because of one man's vendetta.
###Chapter 101

When Harrison discovered the truth, he could hardly believe his ears.

The revelation that Old Master Blackwood would stoop to such underhanded tactics against his former daughter-in-law left him speechless.

Even Harrison found himself pitying Evelyn Sinclair.

Nathan Blackwood remained silent for what felt like an eternity, the oppressive quiet in the office growing heavier by the second.

With a sudden violent motion, Nathan kicked his chair across the room. Snatching his jacket, he stormed out with thunderous footsteps, his expression dark as a gathering storm.

His sports car tore through the streets toward Highland Estates. Spotting a maid in the foyer, Nathan demanded in a dangerously low voice, "Where is my grandfather?"

The maid trembled visibly. "The Old Master has gone to Aspen Lodge, Young Master."

Nathan turned sharply, but the maid hurried after him. "Young Master, the Old Master said... he won't see you until the matter is resolved."

Nathan froze mid-step. His piercing gaze locked onto the terrified maid. "What did you just say?"

The maid paled and shrank back, too frightened to repeat herself.

Clenching his jaw, Nathan returned to his car and dialed his grandfather's number with forceful jabs at his phone screen.

The line rang endlessly before finally connecting.

"I knew you'd come crawling back because of that woman," came the aged, mocking voice. "You've shown remarkable restraint not dealing with her sooner."

"I said I would handle this," Nathan growled, his knuckles white around the steering wheel. The temperature in the car seemed to drop several degrees.

Old Master Blackwood chuckled darkly. "Handle it? She despises our family. Do you honestly believe she'll return my antique pipe willingly? Impossible!"

"That doesn't justify smearing her reputation. What about her future?"

"Her future?" The old man scoffed. "I gave her a chance. She thought she could waltz into the Sterling family without showing me basic respect. Now she'll learn what happens when you cross me!"

His voice turned venomous. "Stay out of this, Nathan. Consider yourself lucky to be rid of that woman. She would've brought nothing but shame to the Blackwood name!" The line went dead with a decisive click.

Old Master Blackwood watched with satisfaction as the online attacks against Evelyn grew increasingly vicious. By afternoon, he descended for tea, asking casually, "Any response from that woman?"

He'd expected Evelyn to come begging for forgiveness by now - not just for the pipe, but on her knees, properly humbled.

The butler hesitated. "There's been no contact, sir."

"What?" The old man's teacup clattered against its saucer. "None at all?"

"We've had people monitoring her apartment. She hasn't left all day. No statements to the press either. It's as if..." The butler trailed off nervously.

"As if she doesn't care?" Old Master Blackwood's face twisted into a sneer. "Nonsense. She's hiding in fear. Give it time. Soon enough, she'll come crawling back in tears!"

But by the next morning, his confidence began to waver.

"Still nothing?" he demanded at breakfast.

The butler shook his head. "Same as yesterday. No movement from her residence."

Old Master Blackwood's brow furrowed. "What about Sterling Corporation?"

"Minor stock fluctuation initially, but Alexander Sterling stabilized things quickly. No other reaction."

"Hmph. That Alexander is competent, I'll give him that. Pity about his taste in sisters." The old man muttered, "How could William Sterling allow such a woman near his son?"

Just then, Evelyn's phone rang. She glanced at the unfamiliar number with mild curiosity before answering. "Who is this?"

"Old Master Blackwood," came the smug reply - the architect of her current troubles.

Lucas Sterling nudged her urgently. "Evie! The livestream's starting! We need to go now!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn ended the call.
###Chapter 102

Old Master Blackwood's expression darkened as he tapped his cane impatiently.

"Did she answer?" he demanded, his voice sharp with irritation.

The butler glanced nervously at the rejected call notification. "Miss Sinclair declined the call, sir."

A vein pulsed in the old man's temple. How dare that insolent woman ignore him? After everything he'd done to give her a second chance!

"Call again!" he barked, slamming his cane against the marble floor. "I want to see how long Evelyn Sinclair thinks she can avoid me."

The butler swallowed hard. "She's rejected it again, sir. Perhaps she's occupied—"

"Occupied?!" Old Master Blackwood's face turned an alarming shade of red. "With what? Shopping sprees and champagne?"

Meanwhile, Evelyn was indeed occupied - furiously tapping her phone screen as she missed the limited edition Chanel perfume launch during the live sale.

Lucas, lounging beside her with Leo the AI tiger curled at his feet, smirked as he successfully secured the purchase. "Better luck next time, sis."

Evelyn huffed and snatched his phone. Seeing his confirmation email only deepened her scowl.

With a mischievous grin, she began typing a private message to the luxury influencer hosting the stream: [If you're in Paris, I'd like to commission some personal shopping. Money is no object.]

The influencer nearly choked on his espresso when he read the message. After confirming today's projected sales target was €750 million, he replied skeptically: [That's quite a budget. You serious?]

Evelyn's response came instantly: [Deadly serious. Platform fee or direct transfer?]

When the bank notification appeared on his phone showing the full amount deposited, the influencer nearly dropped his device. His staff watched in amazement as he abruptly ended the public stream and announced: "Ladies and gentlemen, we're going private today!"

Soon, Evelyn was enjoying an exclusive virtual shopping spree through the streets of Paris.

"That new Louis Vuitton trunk collection is exquisite," the influencer gushed as he entered the flagship store. "Shall I—"

[One in every color,] Evelyn typed before he could finish.

The Hermès specialist was mid-sentence about their rare Birkin inventory when Evelyn interrupted: [How many are available? When told twelve, she replied: [Take them all.]

Viewership of the private stream skyrocketed as word spread of the mysterious billionaire's shopping frenzy.

Lucas returned from playing with Leo to find Evelyn giggling madly with his phone. "What's so funny?" he asked, plopping onto the sofa.

"Just getting some holiday bonuses for the staff," she said airily.

Lucas shrugged. "Whatever makes you happy. Don't hold back."

Evelyn tilted her head with an impish smile. "Oh I didn't. Just spent about €750 million."

Lucas's jaw dropped. "You did WHAT?"
###Chapter 103

Lucas Sterling's gaze lingered on the smartphone in Evelyn Sinclair's hand. "That's definitely mine!" he confirmed.

Every member of the Sterling family used Evelyn's birthday as their passcode - a thoughtful gesture to help her remember. With this knowledge, Evelyn completed the transaction effortlessly.

A muscle twitched in Lucas's jaw. He found himself nostalgic for the days when his sister merely requested yachts - at least those purchases were more economical.

While $800 million was merely pocket change for Lucas, watching such a sum vanish still left an odd hollowness in his chest. He gave himself a reassuring pat.

"She's my sister. Spending my money is her birthright," he reasoned aloud. "Besides, it's only eight hundred million! Her happiness is priceless."

Leo, the AI tiger companion, finally warmed up to him, rubbing its head affectionately against Lucas's leg. Distracted by the adorable display, Lucas scooped up Leo and wandered off to play.

That afternoon, while Evelyn's scandal dominated headlines, another trending topic emerged: @RichBaby.

[First time seeing how the 1% shops - price tags don't even register!]

[@RichBaby - the name says it all!]

[Age is just a number! Marry me and take my last name!]

[Who IS this @RichBaby? The internet demands answers!]

After providing the livestreamer with a delivery address, Evelyn happily set aside Lucas's phone.

Her own device displayed seven missed calls - one from Nathan Blackwood, four from Patriarch Blackwood, and two from Isabella Montgomery and an unknown number. As Evelyn reached to call Isabella back, her phone rang again. A cold smile curved her lips.

"Getting impatient, are we?" she murmured. Though Patriarch Blackwood had backed her into a corner and turned public opinion against her, Evelyn still held the ultimate bargaining chip - the emerald pipe. What did she have to fear?

She answered with deliberate nonchalance. "Hello?"

On the other end, the butler exhaled in relief. "Sir, she answered!" he announced excitedly to Patriarch Blackwood.

Evelyn's smile widened. She heard the phone change hands, followed by Patriarch Blackwood's measured tone. "Evelyn, have you finally come to your senses?"

"Come to my senses?" Evelyn feigned confusion, her brow furrowing slightly. "Patriarch Blackwood, I'm afraid I don't understand. What exactly am I supposed to be admitting to?"

A derisive snort came through the line. "How have you been faring? I hear you've stopped going to the office entirely. Did Alexander Sterling cast you out? I warned you that marrying into high society isn't as simple as you imagined. Not everyone is as gullible as Nathan!"

Evelyn's smile remained unshaken. "How kind of you to inquire, Patriarch Blackwood. I've been living my best life lately. Lounging about aimlessly has always been my dream."

Her days consisted of leisure and lavish spending - what could be more enjoyable?

"Still stubborn, I see," Patriarch Blackwood scoffed, refusing to believe her unaffected demeanor.

"Was there something you needed? Otherwise, I'll be hanging up now." Evelyn had no intention of wasting another second on undeserving individuals.

"Trying to play tough?" she thought derisively. "Nathan Blackwood and his grandfather are cut from the same cloth. I'll never let them look down on me again."

Several seconds of silence passed before Patriarch Blackwood's voice deepened. "Evelyn, no matter what you do, you can't escape your past. Unless... the Blackwood family publicly supports you. Do you comprehend?"

He'd practically spelled it out for her. Surely she'd take the hint - she had no other options.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, releasing a scornful laugh. "You orchestrated this entire fiasco and now want to console me? Patriarch Blackwood, isn't your arrogance showing?"

"Hmph! You have no alternatives," he stated with absolute certainty. "Return the emerald pipe, and I'll cease the online attacks against you. I might even appoint you as a manager in one of our subsidiary companies - enough to keep you from starvation."
###Chapter 104

The Blackwood patriarch was determined to ruin Evelyn Sinclair's reputation, making it impossible for her to continue working at Sterling Corporation.

Does he really think I'll grovel and accept a managerial position in some insignificant subsidiary under the Blackwood Group? The audacity of that old man!

Evelyn scoffed.

"Mr. Blackwood, I have no interest in your family's charity. Save it for someone more desperate."

"Evelyn, don't push me," the elder Blackwood threatened, his voice laced with irritation. "Must you be so stubborn?"

The amusement faded from Evelyn's face.

"You should be the one worrying about regrets, Mr. Blackwood."

She couldn't wait to see the look on his face when he realized his mistake. If he wanted to play dirty, she wouldn't hold back.

After ending the call, she dialed Alexander Sterling.

"Big Brother, when is Dad arriving?"

Alexander chuckled. "Miss him already?"

"His flight lands tomorrow. Don’t worry, I’ll arrange for someone to escort you home."

"No, I want to pick him up myself!"

Let them think I'm hiding in shame. I'll prove them wrong.

Alexander hesitated. "But the media—"

He was worried about her safety.

"I'll bring security and extra cars. If that’s what you want, I’ll make it happen. By the way, how’s Lucas treating you?"

Evelyn laughed. "That petty brat! He trashed my apartment and complained I didn’t clean up. And his cooking? Disastrous!"

Lucas, who had just walked into the living room holding Leo, glared at her. "You blew through $800 million in one afternoon and still have the nerve to call me petty? Evelyn Sinclair, you’re asking for a beating!"

He lunged at her, and Evelyn flipped over the couch, shouting into the phone, "Gotta run, Alex!"

Alexander laughed, his tension easing. His sister was tougher than he’d given her credit for.

The next day, Evelyn dressed carefully for her father’s arrival. She wore a sleek black dress with delicate pearls, her makeup understated yet elegant. She looked poised, confident, and unshaken.

To distract the reporters swarming outside, Lucas made a grand exit through the front door, sunglasses perched on his nose. The media immediately swarmed him.

"Lucas! Are you and Evelyn really living together?"

"Is the scandal true? Are you two dating?"

The rumors of their secret cohabitation were even juicier than the original scandal. While the reporters were preoccupied, Evelyn slipped out through a side exit, baseball cap and mask in place, and slid into the car Alexander had sent.

Bennett was waiting for her. As she settled in, she removed her jacket and touched up her lipstick.

"Vice President Sinclair, we’re all relieved to see you’re doing well."

Evelyn smiled, touched by his concern. Despite their short time working together, their bond was strong.

"Bennett, I’ve arranged gifts for the company anniversary. They’re stored at the warehouse—I’ll send you the details. Distribute them to the staff."

"Of course, ma’am."

He had no idea those "small gifts" totaled $800 million.

At the airport, Evelyn headed straight for the VIP arrivals while Bennett handled security.

"Nikki!"

She turned at the familiar voice. William Sterling waved at her, dressed in a white baseball cap and beige casual wear, looking decades younger than his age.

Evelyn’s eyes lit up, and she ran to him.

William swept her into a hug, spinning her around. "My precious girl, you’ve lost weight!"

She laughed. "I haven’t! Lucas keeps calling me fat."

"Don’t listen to him." William studied her, satisfied, before his expression darkened. "Those Blackwoods are nothing but trouble."
###Chapter 105

William Sterling cursed under his breath as he strode through the airport, his irritation simmering beneath the surface.

It did nothing to ease his frustration.

As he and Evelyn stepped out of the VIP area, Alexander approached, his posture confident, his expression unreadable.

"What are you doing here?" William grumbled.

"I was concerned," Alexander replied smoothly, taking the suitcase from his father's grip. His gaze shifted to Evelyn. "Brace yourself. The press caught wind of your arrival. There's a swarm of them at the exit."

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk. "I'm not afraid of them."

William ruffled her hair affectionately, pride flickering in his eyes.

His daughter was no coward.

"Stay behind me," he ordered gruffly.

Let them try to get past him.

Alexander remained vigilant, positioning himself protectively beside Evelyn and lacing his fingers through hers. The moment they stepped outside, a barrage of camera flashes assaulted them.

Evelyn instinctively turned her face away, but to the reporters, it looked like she was seeking refuge against Alexander's chest.

One headline blared: Evelyn Sinclair Spotted with Lucas Sterling—Romance Brewing?

Another followed instantly: Evelyn Meets the Sterling Family—Is Marriage on the Horizon?

"Evelyn, are you and Alexander Sterling involved?"

"What's your relationship with actor Lucas Sterling?"

Alexander shielded Evelyn's eyes from the blinding flashes, his arm tightening around her shoulders as he guided her forward with unwavering determination.

"Evelyn, will you be marrying into the Sterling family?"

"How does it feel to be chasing wealth for the second time?"

"Are you proud of having so many men wrapped around your finger?"

"Is Sebastian Hart just another backup plan?"

The questions were relentless, each one laced with venom, as if the rumors circulating online were undeniable truths.

"Mr. Sterling, what do you think about Evelyn's scandalous past?"

Even William wasn't spared. The reporters acted as though his opinion would determine Evelyn's fate.

William's expression darkened further.

He didn't dignify them with a response, striding forward without hesitation. Alexander remained silent as well, while their bodyguards formed an impenetrable barrier.

Evelyn walked calmly in her sleek black dress, her chin lifted.

She wouldn't explain herself.

The truth would come out eventually.

Then—

A water bottle flew from the crowd, striking the back of Evelyn's head.

She flinched at the impact.

Alexander's gaze turned glacial as he snapped, "Bennett, find whoever did that. Call the police."

"Yes, sir."

The bodyguards tightened their formation, blocking any further attacks.

The Sterlings slipped into their waiting car, which smoothly merged into traffic. They had prepared decoy vehicles, making it impossible for the press to track them.

Once inside, Evelyn exhaled shakily.

Alexander gently rubbed the spot where the bottle had hit, his voice low. "Does it hurt?"

She shook her head. "No. Just startled."

William poured himself a glass of red wine from the mini-fridge and downed it in one go.

"The Blackwoods have gone too far," he growled. "If they dare lay a finger on my daughter, they'll regret it."

Alexander nodded. "They'll face consequences. But we'll strike when the time is right."

"Don't waste your anger on them, Dad," Evelyn murmured. "They're not worth it."

A bitter ache settled in her chest.

Her family shouldn't have to endure this humiliation because of her past mistakes—because she had once been foolish enough to trust the wrong man.

I brought this on myself.

William sighed, stroking her hair gently. "What matters is that you've learned. It's never too late to start over."

Evelyn nodded, her eyes stinging.

The moment they left, photos of the Sterlings at the airport exploded across social media.

[Look at William Sterling's face! He clearly doesn't approve of Evelyn. Her gold-digging dreams are over!]

[How could Alexander Sterling fall for someone like her? She must have him under some spell!]

[I need to learn Evelyn's tricks—how does she do it?]

Then, William's phone rang.

He glanced at the screen, his expression hardening as he answered.

"Chairman Blackwood. To what do I owe this call?"

"William, I just saw the news. Welcome back! How about we meet for drinks tonight?"
###Chapter 106

Alexander and Evelyn exchanged glances as their father ended the call. Old Master Blackwood had been insistent on contacting William Sterling immediately after Nathan had left the meeting.

Nathan Blackwood scoffed. "There's no need. My family is in chaos right now. I'm not in the mood for drinks."

Old Master Blackwood chuckled. "It's just over a woman. Why let it ruin your mood?"

He leaned forward, his tone shifting. "Actually, I have a favor to ask."

"Chairman Sterling, Kingsley Tech's anniversary gala is coming up. Why don't I invite your entire family? We can discuss matters then."

There was a pause on the other end before William replied, "Very well. I'll see you then."

The moment the call ended, Nathan's eyes darkened with cold fury. "Just wait. I'll make sure those Blackwood snakes regret everything."

Alexander smirked. "I'll spend these next few days restructuring our company shares. We'll weed out the useless directors so Evelyn can take over without interference."

William nodded approvingly. "Good. That'll save us trouble later."

Evelyn sighed dramatically, twirling a strand of her hair. "Oh no, what a tragedy. I might have too much money to spend now. Whatever shall I do?"

William paused, suddenly remembering something. "Speaking of spending, the bank president called me yesterday. Lucas spent $800 million in one afternoon. Not on investments or stocks—just gone. He was worried it might be fraud. What is that boy up to?"

Alexander burst out laughing. "Dad, that was Evelyn's doing."

William exhaled in relief. "Ah, then it's fine."

"If Lucas ever finds out, he'll lose his mind," Evelyn mused.

When Evelyn returned home, her phone buzzed with an unknown number. She ignored it at first, assuming it was spam, but the relentless ringing forced her to answer.

"Evelyn?"

Tristan Whitmore's voice sent a chill down her spine.

She arched a brow. "Mr. Whitmore. To what do I owe this... unpleasant surprise?"

Silence stretched for two seconds before Tristan spoke again, his voice tight. "Evelyn, I didn't take advantage of the situation this time. You can't use me as your scapegoat."

Evelyn let out a mocking laugh. "Oh? So now you're afraid?"

"Mr. Whitmore, have you forgotten how you insulted me that night?"

Tristan's breath hitched, but his pride refused to let him back down completely. "That was a misunderstanding. I've... reflected on it. Just let it go this once."

The panic in his voice was new. Those leaked photos had clearly traumatized him.

Evelyn smirked. "I'll think about it. Don't call me again. Your voice is grating."

She was about to hang up when Tristan suddenly blurted, "Wait! Someone wants to talk to you."

Evelyn froze. Then, a familiar, icy voice cut through the line.

"Evelyn. It's me."

Nathan Blackwood.

Her fingers tightened around the phone. A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

"Mr. Blackwood. Here to warn me too?"

Nathan sounded taken aback. "Did my grandfather contact you?"

"Wasn't this entire mess orchestrated by Chairman Blackwood to teach me a lesson?"

He’s playing dumb.

"Evelyn, just return the pipe. I'll handle the rest."

She forced a laugh, her eyes stinging. "Oh? You'll handle it? How generous."

The line went silent.

"Nathan Blackwood, I know this good cop, bad cop act. Do you think I'm stupid?"

Her voice dripped with venom.

"Your family slings mud at me, twists the truth, and expects me to kneel and beg for forgiveness? And then what? Thank you for your mercy before you stab me in the back?"

Her chest burned.

Three years of love, erased in three days.

She finally saw it clearly—their arrogance, their condescension.

No matter how impressive she became—Vice President of Sterling Corp, surrounded by powerful allies like Alexander and Sebastian Hart—none of it mattered.

To the Blackwoods, she would always be that powerless, gold-digging nobody.

And they would keep crushing her until she broke.

Nathan's voice was strained. "Evelyn, I didn't do this."

"So what? You're still a Blackwood. Does that make you innocent?" Her laugh was hollow. "Do you think every insult hurled at me has nothing to do with you?"

The air grew heavy.

Tristan interjected weakly, "Evelyn, Nathan really didn't—"

"Save it." Her voice cracked. "I'm done."

She hung up.

Tears threatened to fall, but she blinked them away.

Weakness was a luxury she couldn’t afford.

Not anymore.
###Chapter 107

Evelyn Sinclair fought desperately against the tidal wave of emotions threatening to overwhelm her. She drew a shuddering breath, forcing back the stinging tears that blurred her vision.

The situation had escalated beyond reconciliation. There was no middle ground left - only one path forward remained.

Nathan Blackwood wanted Evelyn to surrender the emerald pipe to his grandfather as a peace offering. This would distract the old man while Nathan regained control of the media narrative. His plan was to uncover the truth and clear Evelyn's name before the scandal caused irreparable damage.

"Let's discuss the remaining details later," Nathan said with forced patience. "The priority now is resolving this immediate crisis."

Evelyn's bitter laugh crackled through the phone. "Save your breath. I'm accustomed to public scorn by now." Her voice turned icy. "Nathan Blackwood, know this - my greatest regret was being foolish enough to fall for a man like you! Thank heaven it only lasted three years. Consider this marriage my darkest nightmare!"

She drew a shaky breath before delivering her final blow. "And tell your grandfather I'll ensure this pipe finds a worthy home - far from Blackwood hands."

The call ended with a decisive click. Hot tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks as the weight of her words settled between them.

In those first agonizing days after their divorce, Evelyn had often wondered if Nathan had ever truly cared for her. But she'd never dared ask - the question itself would have been surrender. Nathan Blackwood had never acknowledged her as his wife, and she refused to debase herself further.

Now, the answer didn't matter. The entire question seemed laughable in hindsight.

"What a joke," Evelyn whispered to the empty room. "Three years of marriage reduced to nothing but self-delusion."

Across town, Tristan Whitmore watched Nathan stare at the disconnected call with thunderous intensity. The tension in the penthouse was palpable.

"That woman has no sense of self-preservation," Tristan muttered nervously. "Just let the scandal blow over, Nate. She's not worth the trouble." He'd never seen anyone dare speak to Nathan Blackwood with such brazen disrespect - let alone hang up on him.

"Remarkable," Nathan said through clenched teeth. "Absolutely remarkable."

Tristan cleared his throat. "By the way, I received an invitation to Sterling Corporation's anniversary gala. They've invited every major media outlet - domestic and international. Rumor has it Alexander Sterling plans to address the Evelyn situation publicly. So really, you needn't worry about-"

"I'm not worried," Nathan cut in, his voice glacial. "If she refuses help, that's her choice."

Nathan couldn't fathom Evelyn's stubbornness. With the scandal reaching critical levels, why wouldn't she accept his assistance? Did she truly believe Sterling Corporation would protect her? That Alexander Sterling would marry her under these circumstances?

Anyone associating with her now risked professional ruin.

The woman was being utterly reckless.
###Chapter 108

Alexander Sterling personally oversaw the distribution of invitations for Sterling Corporation's anniversary celebration. Every influential figure and celebrity across the country had secured their spot on the exclusive guest list.

What stunned society most was the corporation's refusal of all brand sponsorships for this prestigious event. They had enlisted the world's top event planners to ensure perfection in every detail - from venue design to gourmet cuisine and premium beverages.

The sheer extravagance demonstrated how seriously the Sterlings took this occasion.

Evelyn Sinclair's online scandal had gradually faded from public attention. Occasionally, hired trolls would still hurl insults her way, but the storm had largely passed.

What captured the internet's fascination now was the mysterious identity of @LuxuryQueen, the anonymous billionaire who had spent $800 million during a single livestream shopping spree without even asking about prices.

Netizens speculated endlessly about this enigmatic figure. The only clues were the chat logs from that fateful broadcast. Many believed that since @LuxuryQueen had purchased the entire inventory, tracking the delivery process might reveal her true identity.

Evelyn watched the speculation unfold with quiet amusement. Unlike celebrities, she had no obligation to disclose her personal life to the public.

Sterling Corporation had booked the grandest ballroom in Manhattan's financial district - a sprawling semi-open venue capable of hosting a thousand guests. The upper floors offered breathtaking panoramic views of the glittering city skyline, including the majestic Aurora River that bisected the metropolis and several iconic landmarks.

Those very landmarks now displayed digital billboards that Sterling Corporation had purchased for the evening, each flashing celebratory messages about their anniversary. It was an understated yet undeniably extravagant display of wealth.

Business magnates, A-list celebrities, and media personalities marveled at the event's lavish scale, astonished that a corporate anniversary warranted such grandeur.

Evelyn arrived early at the venue's private lounge. While Alexander handled guest arrivals outside, William Sterling was preoccupied with selecting his daughter's perfect ensemble. Every element had to be flawless.

Even the most fashion-forward attendees would gasp when they saw Evelyn's wardrobe - thirteen unique haute couture gowns commissioned from the world's top designers. These masterpieces represented days of collaborative design sessions, each dress a potential museum piece. Never before had such an exclusive collection been created for a single individual.

"Ms. Sterling, which gown would you prefer for your grand entrance?" the lead designer inquired with a respectful smile.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on the breathtaking array before her, each creation more exquisite than the last.

Before she could respond, William waved his hand dismissively. "Just wear the most expensive one!"

Evelyn suppressed an eye roll as the designer tactfully replied, "Chairman Sterling, these pieces transcend monetary value now."

With a graceful gesture, Evelyn indicated a sophisticated light gray drop-shoulder gown. Its understated elegance belied the intricate hexagonal diamond embroidery that shimmered with every movement. "This one."

The designer beamed. "Excellent choice, Ms. Sterling! Your first impression should be memorable without overwhelming your natural beauty. While the color palette is restrained, the cut accentuates your figure perfectly. Each diamond was hand-selected for its exceptional quality and precisely placed to highlight your best features. Paired with these heels..." She gestured to an assistant who presented equally exquisite footwear. "Absolute perfection!"

William nodded enthusiastically, though it was unclear whether he truly comprehended the designer's explanation. Any praise for his daughter pleased him regardless.

"Where's the jewelry? Where are those royal heirlooms I acquired from Europe?" he demanded.

An attendant carefully approached, cradling a velvet case. "Just arrived by private jet, Chairman Sterling. In pristine condition, as promised."

William glanced briefly before turning to Evelyn. "Sweetheart, do you like it? If not, I'll have them bring the others. I bought several pieces, but this was the most extravagant!"

Evelyn smiled at her father's enthusiasm. The necklace was indeed magnificent - a stunning lily motif crafted from flawless diamonds, its timeless design perfectly complementing her chosen gown.

"It's perfect, Father. This will do splendidly."

Their moment was interrupted by Alexander's arrival. "Father," he announced, "the Blackwoods have arrived."
###Chapter 109

William Sterling curled his lips into a cold smirk.

Perfect timing. He was just about to go meet them.

Evelyn Sinclair tugged lightly at her father’s sleeve, concern flickering in her eyes. "Dad, tonight is a major event for our company. Please don’t cause a scene with them. If people laugh at them, so be it—but it’s not worth risking our reputation."

"Don’t worry, I know exactly what I’m doing." William straightened his suit jacket and strode out of the room.

Just then, Evelyn’s closest friends, Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont, entered one after the other. "Hello, Uncle William!"

William’s expression softened as he regarded them warmly. "Isabella, Natalie, thank you for always being such wonderful friends to Evelyn. I’ve prepared a selection of jewelry I think you’ll love. Be sure to pick something before you leave tonight."

The two women exchanged delighted glances before bowing their heads in gratitude. "Thank you, Uncle William!"

Satisfied, William exited the room.

Isabella and Natalie immediately rushed to Evelyn, their excitement palpable. "Evelyn! Finally, you don’t have to hide your identity anymore! After tonight, the entire city will be in shock!"

A faint, indifferent smile touched Evelyn’s lips.

"My identity isn’t what matters. I’m just annoyed that all of this has affected the company."

Isabella stepped forward, her eyes gleaming with mischief. "Guess who we just saw?"

Natalie arched a brow. "You’ll never believe it."

Evelyn frowned. "Who?"

"The Blackwoods actually brought that witch Vanessa Holloway with them!" Isabella spat, her voice dripping with disdain.

"Do you think they suspected you’d be here and came specifically to provoke you?"

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smirk. "They certainly succeeded in disgusting me."

Before the others could speculate further, Natalie added, "And get this—Nathan’s grandfather has already ordered the media to spread rumors that you were cast out of high society and will never marry into wealth again."

Evelyn scoffed. "Old Man Blackwood is as predictable as ever." She turned to Isabella. "Did you send my invitation to him?"

Isabella smirked. "Of course! A man of his status rarely attends business banquets, but since he’s my father’s old classmate—and I personally begged him—he finally agreed to come tonight with his entourage. I saw him arrive earlier."

Everything was in place. Now, all they had to do was wait.

"Who?" Natalie blinked in confusion.

Isabella squeezed her hand conspiratorially. "You’ll find out soon enough—but trust me, the Blackwoods are going to hate it."

Natalie sighed in mock exasperation. "Fine. I’ll just wait for the fireworks, then."

Since there was still time before the event began, Evelyn excused herself to freshen up. Just as she stepped out of the bathroom stall to wash her hands, a familiar, venomous voice reached her ears.

"You haven’t seen that bitch Evelyn, have you?"

Margaret Blackwood.

Of course she would be here.

"No, why would she dare show her face at an event like this? She’s the most hated woman in the city right now. I bet she’s hiding in some hole somewhere."

Sophia Blackwood’s mocking laughter followed. "Exactly. She’ll always be a disgrace. Does she really think cozying up to the Sterlings will make her better than us? Hah! Grandfather said the Sterlings only hosted this gala to publicly cut ties with her. They want to clear up the scandal between her and Alexander Sterling. Soon, she’ll have no choice but to hand over that emerald pipe."

Margaret’s voice dripped with arrogance as she washed her hands.

Sophia giggled. "Mom, you’re brilliant for bringing Vanessa as Nathan’s date. If Evelyn sees them together, she’ll probably choke on her own rage!"

Their laughter was cut short by a sharp bang as the bathroom stall door swung open.

Evelyn stepped out, her expression icy, her lips curled in a mocking smile.

"Mrs. Blackwood, I didn’t choke on my rage—nor did I collapse in despair. Did I disappoint you?"
###Chapter 110

Outside the restroom stall, Margaret and Sophia Blackwood stood frozen in shock.

"How did you get in here?" Sophia gasped, her mind racing. Hadn't Evelyn been banished from Sterling Corporation?

Margaret recovered quicker, masking her surprise with a practiced smile. "She must be here to beg. Evelyn, you should know when to quit."

"Not every wealthy family will accept damaged goods," Sophia sneered, emboldened. "Especially secondhand trash like you."

She continued taunting, "Are you here to cause trouble? Too bad no one will help you now. The Sterlings have disowned you - your precious backers are gone."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly as she glanced sideways at them. Without uttering a word, she turned to leave.

Sophia blocked the doorway, refusing to move aside.

With effortless grace, Evelyn shoved past her. Sophia stumbled sideways, crashing into the wall with a pained yelp. As she opened her mouth to curse, she caught Evelyn's icy dark gaze.

The words died in her throat.

Only when Evelyn's silhouette disappeared did Sophia dare rub her bruised shoulder. "That worthless outcast!" she hissed. "Just wait - I'll make her pay for this!"

In the grand ballroom's center, the Sterling men mingled effortlessly with guests. Though retired, William Sterling maintained the vigor of a man twenty years younger through disciplined exercise. Standing beside his son Alexander, they could have passed for brothers.

"Chairman Sterling! What an honor." Old Master Blackwood extended his hand warmly.

William's grip was polite but cool. "Chairman Blackwood."

Nathan offered a slight bow. "Uncle William."

"Just 'Chairman Sterling' will suffice," William corrected brusquely, ignoring Nathan's greeting.

Nathan masked his surprise smoothly. Despite their business dealings, William's frosty demeanor drew an unmistakable line between their families that puzzled him.

Oblivious to the tension, Old Master Blackwood continued chatting amiably. Meanwhile, Alexander's sharp gaze landed on Vanessa Holloway beside Nathan.

Raising his champagne flute, Alexander remarked, "No wonder you were so ruthless with your ex-wife, Mr. Blackwood. Preparing to announce new marital plans? I wonder which fortunate lady has captured your devotion?"

Even the dimmest person would recognize the barb in Alexander's words. Nathan's brow furrowed slightly, his expression turning stormy. He despised personal inquiries, especially from a man entangled with Evelyn. Was this some twisted form of vengeance?

Vanessa seized the opportunity for introduction. "I grew up overseas. My uncle chairs FQ Enterprises."

Alexander nodded politely. "How... unremarkable. Mr. Sterling, do you know my uncle?" Vanessa pressed hopefully.

"I can't say the name rings any bells," Alexander replied with glacial courtesy. Vanessa's smile faltered at the thinly veiled contempt.

Still, she consoled herself - at least she wasn't that pathetic Evelyn with no connections or status.

"You do make a striking couple," Alexander added drily. Vanessa preened while Nathan's expression darkened further.

"Mr. Sterling," Nathan said coldly, "since when do you take such interest in my personal affairs?"

Alexander's lips quirked. "Perhaps since they became public entertainment."

Before he could continue, Sophia came rushing over, nearly tripping on her gown. "Nathan!" she gasped.

"Where are your manners?" Nathan snapped.

Sophia straightened immediately, whispering urgently to Vanessa. The two women hurried off without proper farewells.

Nathan's eyes narrowed in disapproval while Alexander remained indifferent. Observing the exchange, William commented, "Miss Blackwood is certainly... spirited. Your household must be quite lively."

Old Master Blackwood chuckled. "Forgive her - we've spoiled her rotten."

William sighed wistfully. "My son works constantly - I see him less now than during my busiest years. A daughter would have been nice."

"If you'd had one," Old Master Blackwood joked, "we might have been in-laws by now."
###Chapter 111

William Sterling arched an eyebrow and exchanged a glance with Nathan Blackwood before shaking his head. "How could I possibly consider doing business with you? My daughter certainly doesn't deserve to be associated with someone like Mr. Blackwood."

Old Master Blackwood paused, then chuckled and smoothly changed the subject. "Speaking of which, Sterling Corporation took quite a hit from that woman's scandalous background, didn't it? The stock market has been reacting rather strongly."

Vanessa Holloway tugged Sophia Blackwood's arm and whispered, "Are you absolutely certain? Why would Evelyn be here at this time?"

"How could I mistake her? My mother saw her too," Sophia insisted.

Vanessa's eyes narrowed with calculation. She followed Sophia to the second-floor balcony overlooking the crowded ballroom below. The sea of designer gowns and tuxedos made identifying anyone nearly impossible.

"This is hopeless," Sophia groaned, running fingers through her hair. "But knowing Evelyn, she wouldn't come just to leave empty-handed. She's probably here to force Alexander Sterling's hand in marriage!"

With her back against the wall, Evelyn had no choice but to make her move tonight.

Vanessa barely contained her excitement. "Look! There she is!" She pointed toward the grand entrance where a familiar figure stood.

Evelyn wore a simple but elegant dress, engaged in conversation near the doorway. The tall, handsome man facing her handed over a bouquet of white roses.

"Aren't you supposed to be in Paris?" Evelyn asked, accepting the flowers.

Sebastian Hart looked dashing in his tailored suit, his smile dangerously charming under the soft chandelier light. "I wouldn't miss your big night for the world. I'll fly back right after this."

Evelyn's hands trembled slightly at his radiant smile.

"Shouldn't you greet your father first? I saw him earlier," she suggested.

Sebastian shook his head with a helpless shrug. "He'd either kill me or die from shock. Too risky. The overseas project is nearly complete anyway, and with my brother's anniversary coming up... he won't have reason to keep me away much longer."

Evelyn laughed lightly. "Perfect. We'll throw you a proper welcome home party then."

"Deal!" Sebastian took advantage of her momentary distraction to pull her into a warm embrace. "My little Evelyn is finally coming home. I'm so happy for you!"

Just as Evelyn raised her hands to push him away, Sebastian released her abruptly. "Go get changed. I need to find somewhere to hide before Dad spots me."

She nodded and turned—only to freeze when she saw Nathan Blackwood standing mere feet away, his stormy gaze locked on her, his expression thunderous.

"What a coincidence, Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her smile sharp. "Didn't get enough of my sharp tongue last time?"

Nathan's piercing stare burned into her. "What are you doing here?" His voice was ice. "And embracing another man so publicly?"

The sight of Evelyn in Sebastian's arms had ignited an uncontrollable fury in his chest, driving him forward against his better judgment.

Evelyn glanced around pointedly. "Fortunately, no one else seems to have noticed. And since when do I need permission to attend events? Is there a sign saying 'Evelyn Sinclair forbidden' at the door?"

"Do you even understand what kind of occasion this is?" Nathan hissed. "Is your reputation not tarnished enough already?"

The audacity of this woman—involved with Alexander Sterling one moment, wrapped around Sebastian Hart the next. She was playing with fire.

"I owe my current reputation largely to you, don't I?" Evelyn countered coolly.

The nerve of him to criticize her! Nathan Blackwood was truly unbelievable.

To Nathan, Evelyn looked like nothing more than a stubborn fool. The mocking curve of her lips could have been directed at him or herself—he couldn't tell.

Everyone, Nathan included, believed Evelyn had no place at this elite gathering. That she was out of her depth, unworthy of their privileged world.

"Evelyn," Nathan growled, stepping closer. "What game are you playing?"
###Chapter 112

Nathan Blackwood couldn't comprehend the restless irritation gnawing at him.

Why would Evelyn Sinclair dare to show up here today?

Did she still harbor some foolish hope regarding Alexander Sterling?

Couldn't she see how everyone treated her like discarded trash, avoiding her like the plague?

And those damn flowers in her hands—they made his chest tighten painfully.

His expression darkened as he glared at her.

"You shouldn't have come today," he said through gritted teeth. "Whatever scheme you're plotting, drop it. Everyone's watching. If you cause a scene, even I won't be able to shield you."

If she acted out, it wouldn't just be the Blackwoods turning against her—the entire Sterling family would join in.

Evelyn laughed, but her eyes remained icy.

"Shield me?" Her voice dripped with venom. "When have you ever protected me, Nathan? Or are you just terrified I'll drag your precious family name through the mud?"

'The humiliation I've endured—all of it traces back to the Blackwoods. And now he has the audacity to play the hero? Does he think I'm an idiot?'

Nathan's chest constricted at her words. His jaw clenched. He knew she despised him, despised his family—but how could he possibly explain?

Vanessa Holloway hurried over, positioning herself beside Nathan with practiced grace.

"This is my fault," she murmured, her voice soft and regretful. "I know you hate me, Evelyn, and I don't blame you. But please... don't make a scene here. It'll only make things worse for everyone."

Evelyn's gaze sliced through Vanessa like a blade.

"Blame you?" She smirked. "Spare me the act. You're not worth my hatred."

Vanessa's eyes flickered toward Nathan, seeking reassurance, but his expression remained unreadable.

Swallowing her frustration, Vanessa pressed on, feigning magnanimity.

"You've already divorced Nathan. Must you cling to the past forever?"

Evelyn scoffed.

"Forever? You flatter yourself."

Vanessa's lips trembled. "Nathan and I just want you to move on. Today is Sterling Corp's anniversary gala. If you cause trouble, you'll only humiliate yourself further. Think of the bigger picture!"

Nathan's frown deepened. Something about Vanessa's words unsettled him.

Evelyn stared at the two of them—the cheating bastard and his scheming mistress—and nearly laughed at the absurdity.

'Bigger picture? My leaving benefits who? You two?'

"Save the theatrics," she sneered. "Your existence is the real joke here."

Done wasting breath, she spotted Isabella Montgomery waving at her across the room. Without another glance at Nathan or Vanessa, she turned and walked away.

Vanessa seethed, waiting for Nathan to defend her.

But at the mention of "affair," his expression had turned stormy.

He watched Evelyn leave, then abruptly walked off without a word.

"Nathan?" Vanessa called after him, forcing tears into her eyes. "Did I say something wrong? Evelyn clearly despises us. Maybe... maybe I should go. People will talk if we're seen together."

She knew he wouldn't let her leave. It would be rude to the Sterlings. And without a date, rumors would swirl.

She just needed him to realize how understanding she was compared to Evelyn's outbursts.

Nathan checked his watch.

"Fine. I'll have Harrison take you home."

Then he left.

Vanessa stood frozen, her face paling.

He... he actually agreed?

"Vanessa! Over here!" Sophia Blackwood beckoned. "Mother's looking for you!"

Relieved, Vanessa rushed to Sophia's side. With Margaret and Sophia present, surely Nathan wouldn't send her away now.

"What happened?" Sophia asked, eyeing Vanessa's distress. "What did my brother say?"

"Nothing," Vanessa lied, forcing a smile.

But inside, panic clawed at her.

Since returning from abroad, nothing had gone as planned.

Nathan, who once doted on her, now seemed... distant.

Why?
###Chapter 113

The grand ballroom shimmered with crystal chandeliers, every surface polished to perfection.

Suddenly, the orchestra's melody cut off mid-note as William Sterling ascended the podium.

All eyes turned toward the stage, sensing the pivotal moment of Sterling Corporation's anniversary gala had arrived.

Though Alexander Sterling held the reins of Sterling Corporation with prestige rivaling Nathan Blackwood's, tonight he remained respectfully in the shadows.

He stood at perfect attention, watching his father with quiet admiration.

"Ladies and gentlemen," William's voice carried across the hushed crowd. "Your presence honors Sterling Corporation's legacy. This success belongs to all who've supported us."

He raised his champagne flute in a toast that was immediately mirrored by every guest.

The truth was obvious - Sterling Corporation's meteoric rise stemmed from the Sterling family's brilliance, not mere luck.

Guests vied for favor, their compliments flowing as freely as the vintage Dom Pérignon.

Alexander stepped forward to refill his father's glass before retreating with practiced grace.

William gave an approving nod before addressing the crowd again.

"Tonight, I must address the rumors surrounding a remarkable woman connected to our corporation - Evelyn Sinclair."

A hush fell over the ballroom. The assembled reporters leaned forward, sensing the bombshell about to drop.

Old Master Blackwood's smug expression faltered. Across the room, Margaret and Sophia Blackwood exchanged knowing glances.

"Where is that disgraceful woman?" Sophia whispered, scanning the crowd unsuccessfully.

Margaret smirked. "Probably escorted out. The Sterlings would never tolerate such scandal."

William's gaze locked onto the Blackwood contingent as he declared, "Evelyn secured Kingsley Tech's landmark deal as our Vice President. Her competence is unquestionable - and her relationship with Alexander isn't what gossip suggests."

The revelation hung in the stunned silence. Even Nathan looked unsettled, his usual composure cracking.

"Allow me to properly introduce this extraordinary woman," William announced, turning toward a side entrance with paternal pride.

The double doors swung open dramatically.

Evelyn emerged like a vision, bathed in golden light. Her flawless makeup accentuated high cheekbones, while cascading waves framed her face with effortless elegance.

The custom Laurent Dubois gown clung to her slender frame, its gray diamonds catching the light with every movement.

The showstopping pink diamond necklace at her throat was rumored to have once belonged to French royalty.

She ascended the stage with regal poise, the slit in her gown revealing designer stilettos worth a small fortune.

Taking her place beside William, Evelyn carried herself with the unshakable confidence of someone born to power.

Camera flashes erupted like fireworks, desperate to capture her breathtaking transformation.

The collective gasp was audible. This radiant powerhouse bore no resemblance to the humiliated divorcee of tabloid lore.

William beamed at his daughter's commanding presence - this was how a Sterling heir should debut in high society.

After a dramatic pause, his voice rang out: "Her last name is Sterling - my cherished daughter, my greatest pride - Evelyn Sterling!"
###Chapter 114

The moment William Sterling's words echoed through the grand ballroom, an eerie silence descended.

Every guest stood frozen, as if struck by lightning.

Outside, the towering digital billboards across the city flickered to life, displaying Evelyn Sinclair's radiant face against the night sky. The Sterlings wanted the world to witness their princess's triumphant return.

Old Master Blackwood's face turned ashen, his wrinkled hands trembling against his cane.

Nathan Blackwood stood rigid, his piercing gaze locked on the woman he'd once dismissed. The truth hit him like a freight train.

Sophia and Margaret Blackwood weren't as composed. "This is absurd!" Margaret shrieked, her shrill voice cutting through the silence. "She's just some penniless orphan we took in!"

"Silence!" Old Master Blackwood thundered, his voice shaking with barely contained rage.

William Sterling ignored the outburst, his commanding presence filling the room. "Furthermore," he announced, "I'm transferring my entire 60% stake in Sterling Corporation to Evelyn."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Effective immediately, Evelyn Sinclair will assume control as CEO and my sole successor."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the elite gathering. The woman they'd mocked as a gold-digger now stood as one of the wealthiest heiresses in the country.

Alexander Sterling stepped forward, his calm demeanor contrasting with the electrified atmosphere. "To celebrate my sister's homecoming," he declared, "I'm gifting her 10% of my personal shares."

The crowd held its breath.

"With 70% controlling interest, Evelyn becomes Sterling Corporation's undisputed leader. As her brother, I pledge my full support to her vision."

Evelyn maintained her composure, though her mind reeled. Alexander had never mentioned this staggering gift. The weight of an empire now rested on her shoulders - a golden burden she hadn't anticipated.

Thunderous applause erupted, shaking the crystal chandeliers. The media frenzy reached fever pitch as reporters clamored for comments.

One bold journalist shouted above the din, "Ms. Sinclair! How do you respond to the online rumors? Does your divorce signal the end of Sterling-Blackwood business relations?"

Nathan's jaw tightened, his stormy eyes fixed on his ex-wife.

Evelyn met the question head-on, her voice clear and measured. "Let me clarify - our marriage was never a business arrangement. I entered it under false pretenses, hiding my true identity."

A hush fell over the room.

"That youthful mistake belongs to me alone. This divorce represents my commitment to walk the correct path forward."

Her gaze swept across the Blackwood family, lingering on Nathan. A knowing smile played on her lips. "Perhaps if they'd known who I truly was, we might have avoided this entire spectacle."

She straightened her shoulders, radiating quiet strength. "I'm eternally grateful for my father's name and this platform to set the record straight. Not everyone gets such an opportunity."
###Chapter 115

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curved into a silent smirk as she let the revelation sink in. The truth was finally out.

This elaborate charade had been orchestrated by the Blackwoods with one malicious purpose - to tarnish Evelyn's reputation beyond repair.

For any ordinary person caught in such a web of deceit, recovery would have been impossible. The Blackwoods' influence could easily destroy lives with a snap of their fingers.

But Evelyn wasn't about to shield the Blackwoods from the consequences of their actions. This was the perfect opportunity to expose their despicable nature to the world.

Old Master Blackwood stood rigid, struggling to mask the panic and overwhelming regret in his eyes. There was no undoing what had been done.

No one could have guessed Evelyn was the Sterling heiress!

No wonder the Blackwoods had found no trace of Evelyn's past when they investigated her before the marriage. They'd believed her when she claimed to be an orphan.

The Sterlings had the power to erase history if they wished.

"A wrong diversion in her life?" Nathan Blackwood's brow furrowed at Evelyn's words, his piercing gaze turning icy. The implication struck him like a physical blow. "Ms. Sterling, does this mean there was indeed a third party involved in our divorce?" A reporter's question brought back memories of the scandal that had surrounded their separation, drawing sympathetic murmurs from the crowd.

The Blackwoods had thrown away control of Sterling Worldwide with their own hands! Nathan remained statuesque amidst the prying eyes, his tailored suit impeccable, his focus entirely on Evelyn who seemed to radiate under the lights.

A storm of emotions raged within him.

Nathan's composure was remarkable - his expression remained unreadable, proving his experience in handling high-stakes situations.

Evelyn cast him a dismissive glance before smiling serenely. "Let's not dwell on the past. Tonight, I have special surprises for everyone!" Her melodic voice carried across the room as she announced, "Recently, I acquired an exclusive luxury shopping livestream. While I've reserved some items for Sterling employees, there are still rare collector's pieces - handbags, jewelry, watches not yet available in Montecito. Please participate in our raffle!"

Gasps filled the air. Just how much were the Sterlings spending on this event?

Wait - livestream? Exclusive items? Not available in Montecito?

A sharp-eyed reporter suddenly connected the dots. "Ms. Sterling...are you the mysterious 'LuxeDiva' who made headlines for purchasing $800 million worth of goods in a single afternoon?"

All eyes turned to Evelyn, who merely offered a modest smile.

"These were just small tokens of appreciation for Sterling Worldwide employees. I never imagined it would attract so much attention. My apologies for occupying media resources."

With Sterling's global operations, $800 million in luxury gifts wasn't excessive - it might not even cover all staff.

The crowd was stunned into silence. Evelyn Sinclair was LuxeDiva!

No wonder internet sleuths had failed to uncover the identity behind the account.

While the world speculated, Evelyn had quietly spent $800 million to commandeer an entire European shopping livestream, all while preparing to reveal her true identity as the Sterling heiress.
###Chapter 116

Meanwhile, the images from Sterling Corporation's centennial celebration had already sent shockwaves across social media.

Evelyn Sinclair's face illuminated the massive digital billboard atop the Aurora Tower, broadcasting her true identity to the entire city.

[OMG this is insane! A billionaire heiress marries beneath her station in disguise, then reveals she's actually the wealthiest woman in the country after their divorce?!]

[This is straight out of a telenovela!]

[The Blackwoods are disgusting! Thinking they could bully Evelyn and hiring trolls to attack her online? Have they no shame?]

[Evelyn's comeback is legendary!]

[YAAAS QUEEN! Evelyn Sinclair slays!]

[I just drove through downtown and saw Evelyn's face on every skyscraper! She's outshining all those A-list actresses fighting for ad space. This is iconic!]

[Evelyn is @BillionDollarBabe?! That handle is everything! How is she this perfect?!]

Inside the gala, Evelyn's extravagant $800 million gesture didn't repel the crowd - it moved them deeply. Everyone could see how genuinely she valued every Sterling Corporation employee.

As murmurs of admiration spread through the hall, Evelyn's gaze casually found Old Master Blackwood. A subtle smirk played on her lips.

"Speaking of generosity," Evelyn continued smoothly, "at last month's charity auction, I acquired an emerald pipe from the Blackwood collection."

She paused dramatically as color drained from the old man's face.

"Chairman Blackwood, I've decided-"

"Wait!" The patriarch interrupted desperately. He could endure the humiliation of Evelyn's deception, but losing the family heirloom was unthinkable. "That pipe is a Blackwood treasure. Name your price - I'll pay ten times its value plus compensation."

The offer - $300 million for a $30 million artifact - would tempt most. But Evelyn Sinclair wasn't most people.

The entire room held its breath as Evelyn's starry eyes sparkled with amusement.

"Chairman Blackwood," she purred, "when one has my resources, petty cash becomes meaningless. This artifact's historical significance transcends monetary value."

She gestured gracefully toward a distinguished gentleman. "Which is why I'm donating it to the National Museum. This way, everyone can appreciate its legacy - far more meaningful than gathering dust in your private collection."

The museum director accepted the priceless artifact with solemn gratitude. As he departed with his prize, William Sterling watched his daughter with immense pride.

Old Master Blackwood trembled with impotent rage. Evelyn had checkmated him perfectly - no private collector would dare reclaim a national treasure.

"Let's go!" he barked, turning on his heel.

But William Sterling's voice stopped him cold. "One moment, Chairman Blackwood..."

Father and daughter approached together, their matching smiles razor-sharp.
###Chapter 117

Old Master Blackwood's expression darkened as his sharp eyes narrowed into slits.

A low, displeased grumble escaped his lips.

The sight of this father-daughter duo made his blood boil with barely contained fury.

"Chairman Sterling," he bit out through clenched teeth, "what other surprises do you have in store? I believe we've seen quite enough of this... spectacle."

It was painfully obvious the Sterlings had orchestrated this entire event to publicly humiliate the Blackwoods.

No wonder Evelyn had been so defiant when he'd complained about her to William Sterling in that office. The memory made his face flush with anger - she'd played him like a fiddle from the very beginning.

William Sterling's gaze flickered toward Nathan Blackwood, who remained as stoic as ever, his aristocratic features betraying nothing.

At such a young age, to maintain such composure amidst this storm was remarkable.

Were it not for Nathan's scandalous affairs and the way he'd repeatedly broken Evelyn's heart, William might have even admired the man as a potential son-in-law.

"Chairman Blackwood," William's voice cut through the tension like ice, "I fail to comprehend the source of your anger. My daughter married into your family only to be treated like a common servant. Even after their divorce, she became the internet's favorite punching bag."

His grip tightened on the podium.

"Don't you think you owe us an explanation?"

Old Master Blackwood stiffened. Margaret and Sophia exchanged shocked glances. Was this a reckoning?

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly as his dark eyes studied Evelyn, who stood beside her father.

She was toying with the sapphire cufflinks on William's sleeve, looking thoroughly bored, as if this entire confrontation was beneath her notice.

From the moment she'd stepped on stage, Nathan had been reeling internally. All the inexplicable things Evelyn had done since their divorce suddenly clicked into place with terrifying clarity.

Old Master Blackwood cleared his throat uncomfortably. "She concealed her identity! How were we to know she was your daughter?"

William's laugh was bitter. "So mistreating her was justified because she didn't announce her pedigree? When she insisted on marrying Nathan against my wishes, I cut ties with her for three years. I told myself her happiness was all that mattered."

His voice dropped dangerously low.

"Imagine my horror discovering your family treated her worse than dirt."

Margaret interjected hastily, "We fed her! Gave her shelter! She lied to us - of course we were angry!"

William's face darkened, but Evelyn tugged his sleeve.

Her cold laugh dripped with disdain.

"Let me guess - it's my fault for not being grateful enough while you treated me like trash? That I deserved to grovel and bleed for scraps of affection?"

Her smile turned razor-sharp.

"Newsflash - I'm not that naive girl anymore. What you gave, I'll return tenfold. An eye for an eye."

Margaret paled. Old Master Blackwood shot her a warning glare that silenced her immediately.

Vanessa Holloway, who'd been lurking in the shadows, suddenly stepped forward with theatrical meekness.

"Evelyn," she said in that saccharine voice, "I know you hate me. Take your anger out on me, not the Blackwoods. If we'd known who you really were..."

Her words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken implications.

Beneath her demure facade, Vanessa seethed. How dare this nobody turn out to be Sterling royalty? That smug superiority she'd always felt over Evelyn now tasted like ashes.

Evelyn gave Vanessa a scathing once-over.

"Who let the stray in?" she asked mockingly. "This isn't a place for trash."
###Chapter 118

Vanessa Holloway's expression froze.

She hadn't anticipated Evelyn Sinclair to be so blunt.

Her gaze flickered toward Nathan Blackwood, hoping for his intervention, but his attention never wavered from Evelyn.

He had been eerily silent this entire time.

Vanessa clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms as she lowered her head.

Even Old Master Blackwood made no move to defend her.

His face was stormy as he addressed William Sterling.

"Mr. Sterling, even if mistakes were made, what's done is done. They're divorced now. Must we really dredge up the past?"

William's jaw tightened.

He was barely containing his fury, wondering how his daughter had endured these people for three long years.

With a sharp gesture, he summoned two nearby waiters.

"Escort this young lady out," he ordered, pointing at Vanessa.

Her face paled.

Panic flashed in her eyes as she looked around for support.

William's voice was ice. "My daughter doesn't need trash in her presence. Remove her."

"Nathan—" Vanessa's plea was desperate.

Nathan's gaze flicked to her, his expression unreadable.

"The car is waiting," he said coolly. "Go home."

Evelyn arched a brow.

She hadn’t expected him to dismiss Vanessa so easily.

Men truly were unpredictable.

Margaret and Sophia Blackwood, who had brought Vanessa here against better judgment, shrank back.

They hid behind Old Master Blackwood, not daring to speak.

William’s demeanor shifted instantly, his polite smile back in place.

"Mr. Blackwood," he said smoothly, "we can overlook the past grievances, but what about the recent rumors circulating online? Don’t you think your family owes the public an explanation?"

Evelyn’s true identity had already cleared her name, but forcing the Blackwoods to publicly apologize was the final nail in their coffin.

Old Master Blackwood scoffed. "Is that necessary?"

William’s smile didn’t reach his eyes.

"If you refuse to show sincerity, Sterling Corporation will sever all ties with Blackwood Enterprises—stocks, funds, investments. Every last one."

His tone was lethal. "Unless, of course, you can match our financial pull."

Old Master Blackwood’s face darkened.

Blackwood Enterprises wasn’t poor, but Sterling Corporation was in another league.

A sudden withdrawal would leave them scrambling to cover massive losses.

"I’ll consider it," he gritted out before turning on his heel.

Evelyn smirked.

"Oh, and Mr. Blackwood," she called sweetly, "don’t forget to visit the National Museum more often!"

The jab hit its mark.

Old Master Blackwood staggered, nearly losing his balance before Sophia steadied him.

He stormed off without another word.

William chuckled, shaking his head at his daughter.

"You little devil."

Evelyn grinned, looping her arm through his as they turned to leave—only to find Nathan still standing there.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said lightly, "aren’t you leaving with them?"

Nathan’s silence was heavy.

Then, slowly, he spoke her name like a revelation.

"Evelyn Sterling."

Her lips curved.

Nathan turned to William.

"Mr. Sterling, may I speak with her alone?"

He finally understood why William had rejected being called "Uncle" earlier.

William had wanted to sever any personal connection between them.

William glanced at Evelyn, who gave a careless shrug.

"Fine," she said.

William knew his daughter wouldn’t let that man hurt her again.

Not after everything.

"Don’t take too long," he told her. "I still have people to introduce you to."

With a final warning look at Nathan, he walked away.

Evelyn plucked a glass of red wine from a passing tray, swirling the rich liquid absently.

"What did you want to talk about, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan’s gaze burned into her.

His voice was low, rough with something unspoken.

"Why did you hide your identity to marry me?"
###Chapter 119

Evelyn paused for a moment. Her lashes fluttered slightly as she lifted her gaze with deliberate nonchalance, a faint smirk curling at the corners of her lips.

"Mr. Blackwood, why do you care?"

The answer wouldn’t change anything now. It was pointless.

"Tell me." Nathan’s voice was low, his dark eyes unfathomable, like the depths of a midnight ocean.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her smile soft but edged with ice.

"Because my family despised you, and yet I was foolish enough to love you anyway."

That was why she had turned her back on everything—her name, her privilege, her world—and thrown herself into his arms.

And he had let her fall.

"Luckily, I’ve regained my sight." Her smile was razor-thin. "Are we done here, Mr. Blackwood? You should go discuss the wording of that apology with your father."

She took a sip of her wine, then turned on her heel and walked away without another glance.

Across the room, Alexander Sterling moved effortlessly through the crowd, charming every guest in his path.

William Sterling chuckled, then approached his son. "Where’s Lucas?"

As one of Evelyn’s most scandalous exes—and a Hollywood A-lister—his absence was conspicuous.

Alexander cleared his throat. "He said he’d ‘steal the spotlight’ if he showed up, so he’s at home watching his own movies."

William snorted. "What spotlight? The one his PR team bought for him?"

Meanwhile, Lucas Sterling, sprawled on his couch with a bowl of popcorn, sneezed violently.

As the gala neared its end, Isabella and Natalie managed to drag Evelyn away, slipping out to the Velvet Lounge.

"Nathan, you’re late!" Tristan Whitmore clapped him on the back as soon as he arrived.

After the Sterlings had rented out the city’s entire skyline to announce Evelyn’s identity—and the live photos from the gala had gone viral—the truth was undeniable.

Evelyn Sinclair was the Sterling heiress.

Tristan shuddered, recalling how he’d treated her over the years.

Nathan grabbed an untouched glass from the table and downed the whiskey in one swallow.

The others exchanged uneasy glances.

No one could believe it. The woman they’d dismissed as a gold-digger was royalty.

Tristan exhaled sharply. "She hid it too well. One day she’s just… there, at the top of the damn food chain."

A nervous laugh escaped one of the men. "Do you think she’ll come after us?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "No. Just me."

He was the one who had hurt her from the beginning.

Someone else muttered, "Is she William’s illegitimate daughter? How else was she kept a secret for so long?"

Nathan frowned. If she were illegitimate, why would William Sterling publicly claim her with such pride?

Clearly, the Sterlings had hidden her to protect her.

Tristan rolled his eyes. "Didn’t you read her bio? The Sterlings released her full history. Ivy League at thirteen, Ph.D. by twenty-one, internships with Europe’s top firms—she even advised royalty. She was a legend before she ever met Nathan."

The room fell silent.

They had mocked her, called her a schemer, a nobody.

Turns out, they were the ones beneath her notice.

Tristan nudged Nathan. "So why did she marry you? She must’ve been head over heels, right? What the hell happened?"

Nathan didn’t answer.

He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
###Chapter 120

"I'm not sure." Nathan's voice was icy as he avoided Tristan's outstretched hand.

This had been weighing on Nathan's mind. He vaguely recalled that fateful day when Vanessa Holloway was in that terrible car accident, bleeding profusely. The Rh-null blood supply at San Francisco General had been dangerously low.

That's when Evelyn Sinclair appeared. She offered to donate her blood - with one condition: he had to marry her.

With time running out, Nathan agreed without hesitation.

Everything that followed seemed inevitable.

Though Nathan felt no affection for Evelyn, he honored their marriage vows and treated her with respect.

Suddenly, loud commotion erupted outside their VIP lounge.

Tristan peeked out and immediately recoiled. "Holy hell! It's Evelyn!"

The bass-heavy music thundered through the Velvet Lounge, vibrating the floorboards. The dance floor pulsed with bodies moving in sync with the rhythm.

At the center stood Evelyn, her toned legs moving with effortless grace. The dim lighting caught the sparkle in her eyes as she swayed, instantly commanding attention.

She was breathtaking. Every subtle movement, every coy smile was mesmerizing. Evelyn danced with a handsome stranger, their bodies moving provocatively close. The crowd cheered wildly, completely enthralled.

Even Tristan found himself caught up in the moment, shouting encouragement from the balcony. Evelyn heard his familiar voice and glanced up, her smile vanishing the instant she spotted Nathan standing in the shadows.

Her expression turned cold as she abruptly walked away, as if she'd seen something repulsive.

Nathan's chiseled features darkened. He'd never seen her dance like this before - never realized how radiant she could be. During their three-year marriage, she'd been brave entering it and decisive leaving it.

The realization hit him like a physical blow, his chest tightening uncomfortably.

Perhaps he'd been too close to Vanessa, causing Evelyn to misunderstand their relationship.

Irritation prickled at him as he reconsidered his interactions with Vanessa. Had he crossed lines without realizing?

Seeing Evelyn's dismissive glare, Tristan froze mid-cheer under the neon lights. Lowering his arms, he turned to Nathan. "Blackwood, you sure she won't come after us? Maybe we should apologize?"

One of their companions kicked Tristan's backside. "Man up! She's just a woman. Don't embarrass yourself groveling."

Tristan muttered, "Easy for you to say - she doesn't have your nudes!"

Ignoring them, Nathan downed his whiskey, grabbed his coat, and headed for the exit.

"You just got here! Where are you going?" Tristan called after him.

Inside VIP Room 9...

Evelyn slung her designer purse over her shoulder. "I'm done for tonight. You girls have fun!" she told Natalie and Isabella, who showed no signs of stopping their drinking anytime soon.

As Evelyn stepped into the hallway, she spotted Tristan lurking at the far end with that infuriating grin.

"What's this idiot waiting for?" she thought.

"Get lost," she said coldly, not in the mood for his nonsense.

Tristan persisted. "I will, but hear me out first!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Make it quick."

Seeing her icy demeanor, Tristan hesitated before blurting, "Evelyn, I want to apologize for everything."

Better to swallow his pride than risk his private photos circulating online.

Evelyn studied him sideways, a smirk playing on her lips. "Okay."

Tristan blinked. "You forgive me?"

"Hardly," Evelyn replied airily. "After everything you all put me through, you think a simple 'sorry' erases it? Have you no shame, Mr. Whitmore? I didn't realize you were this shameless."
###Chapter 121

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her glass as a bitter realization struck her. If I weren't William Sterling's daughter, I'd have been dead a dozen times over by now.

Tristan's face burned with shame. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic.

But what choice did I have? The evidence was undeniable.

"What do you want?" Tristan's voice cracked. I must have been out of my damn mind to cross Evelyn Sterling!

Evelyn's gaze drifted to the window, her patience wearing thin.

She approached him with deliberate steps, her stilettos clicking ominously against the marble floor. "Those compromising photos seem to be your only concern," she purred, her voice dripping with icy amusement. "Three seconds. If you're not out of my sight by then, the entire internet gets front row seats to your little... performance by the fourth."

Tristan froze like a deer in headlights as Evelyn's lips curled in contempt.

Before she could finish counting, Tristan was already scrambling backward. "Please! Don't—don't do anything rash!"

True to her word, he vanished before the third tick of the imaginary clock.

Evelyn scoffed, rolling her eyes as she turned on her heel and strode away, her designer dress swaying with each confident step.

The night air hit her face as she exited the Velvet Lounge. There, leaning casually against her Lamborghini, stood Nathan Blackwood.

Waiting. Always waiting.

"Mr. Blackwood," she drawled, arching a perfectly sculpted brow. "Don't you have corporations to run or board members to intimidate?"

Her crimson lips stood out starkly against the inky darkness, a dangerous flame in the night. The coldness in her tone could freeze hell over.

Why couldn't he take the hint? She was done with this game.

Nathan's stormy gaze darkened further, his chiseled features shadowed under the dim streetlights. When he spoke, his voice was whiskey-smooth. "Evelyn, about Vanessa Holloway. She and I—it's not what you—"

The world tilted violently as Evelyn's foot slammed on the brake pedal. Nothing. No response. The steering wheel locked in her hands as panic clawed up her throat.

The car was completely unresponsive, hurtling toward certain death. The darkness ahead seemed to yawn open, eager to swallow her whole. The streetlights blurred into streaks of cold, mocking light.

Death had never felt so close.

Then—headlights. A massive semi-truck materialized three hundred feet ahead.

Time stopped.

CRASH!

Metal screamed against asphalt as another vehicle shot out from nowhere, skidding sideways to intercept her path. The impact sent her forehead smashing into the unyielding steering wheel—no airbag, just searing pain and the coppery tang of blood.

"Evelyn!"

That voice—she knew that voice.

Strong arms wrenched the door open, lifting her onto the roadside with surprising gentleness.

Nathan Blackwood. Of course. If I died now, the Blackwoods would have a PR nightmare on their hands.

His hands trembled slightly as they brushed her forehead, assessing the damage. Each touch sent fresh waves of agony through her skull. The metallic scent of blood sharpened her senses.

His embrace felt foreign—wrong. A year ago, she would have melted into his arms. Now, all she saw were snowflakes dancing behind her eyelids as she fought to stay conscious.

With monumental effort, she shoved against his chest, using the car door to pull herself upright. His totaled Range Rover had taken the brunt of the collision—without it, she'd be paste on that truck's grille.

"Thanks." Her voice was eerily calm despite the throbbing wound.

"Evelyn, you need medical attention—"

She ignored him, already dialing Bennett. "Get to my location now. Someone sabotaged my car. I want answers before sunrise."

The call ended with a decisive click.

"Your Rover's worth four million." She scribbled a figure on a check. "Here's ten. Consider the extra your hazard pay."

Under the flickering streetlight, blood crusted her temple and her usually pristine hair fell in disarray. Yet she'd never looked more regal—a queen surveying her kingdom.

Nathan's expression turned glacial as she shoved the check into his breast pocket. "You didn't hesitate when I needed blood. Now we're even."

The satisfaction was intoxicating as she walked away. Who knew Nathan Blackwood could be put in his place?

Her silhouette stretched long and unbroken down the sidewalk, not a single falter in her stride.

She never saw the flicker of regret in his eyes as she disappeared into the night.
###Chapter 122

The internet was ablaze with outrage.

Every social media platform had turned into a battleground against the Blackwoods for their mistreatment of the vulnerable.

Yet the Blackwood family remained eerily silent amidst the storm. Speaking too soon would only confirm their guilt in the court of public opinion.

Highland Estates glowed ominously against the night sky.

Inside, the atmosphere was suffocating. No one dared to breathe too loudly except for Old Master Blackwood.

When Sterling Corporation's stocks had crashed years ago, Alexander Sterling had single-handedly salvaged the situation.

Tonight, the stock market had turned its fangs toward the Blackwoods instead.

Old Master Blackwood's face was stormy, his expression bitter. His fury only intensified when he learned Nathan hadn't returned home.

"Where the hell is he?!" The old man slammed his cane against the marble floor.

The butler trembled. "We can't reach Young Master Blackwood. His phone goes straight to voicemail, and his assistant claims ignorance of his whereabouts."

"Unbelievable!" The old man's voice boomed. "After three years of marriage, he never noticed anything unusual about Evelyn?!"

His heart pounded violently, threatening to burst from his chest. Had he known Evelyn was the Sterling heiress—a perfect match for their family—he would never have allowed her suffering under their roof.

The divorce alone was scandalous enough, but now?

They had lost everything—money, reputation, and worst of all, their priceless family heirloom!

His furious gaze snapped toward Margaret and Sophia, who stood frozen nearby.

"Useless women! You've brought nothing but disgrace to this family!"

Margaret bit her lip, resentment flashing in her eyes. "Father, Evelyn deceived us all. How is this our fault? Weren't you the one who approved her background check before the wedding?"

The old man's cane struck the floor again. "And who stole my emerald pipe? You dare speak back to me?!"

That cursed pipe haunted him more than the financial ruin.

Margaret's eyes welled with tears, but she stayed silent. Sophia, ever the coward, didn't dare breathe a word.

Then—salvation.

The butler rushed in. "Young Master has returned!"

Relief washed over the women. Finally.

Margaret's eyes reddened. With her husband Charles away on business, Nathan was her only hope to weather the old man's wrath.

She had failed as the lady of Highland Estates.

The moment Nathan stepped into the room, Old Master Blackwood hurled a priceless Ming vase at his feet.

"Decided to grace us with your presence?"

Nathan stepped over the shattered porcelain, his expression unreadable. "We'll handle this."

His grandfather scoffed. "Handle it? Your father won't return for weeks!"

"By then, it'll be too late." Nathan's lips curled into a cold smile.

The old man narrowed his eyes. "Then what do you suggest?"

Nathan's voice was ice. "Exactly what the Sterlings demand."

"Apologize."
###Chapter 123

The memory of Evelyn walking alone under the dim streetlight haunted Nathan.

Her bloodied forehead and that heartbreakingly solitary silhouette sent sharp pangs through his chest.

He owed her more than he could ever repay.

Old Master Blackwood glared at him. "If this were a sincere apology, why the anger? This just proves we wronged her!"

"Our company stocks and reputation will be ruined!"

Sophia Blackwood chimed in, "Exactly! Why must we apologize? We can settle this privately. The Sterling family's reputation isn't worth sacrificing. So what if she's William Sterling's daughter? We never forced her into marriage or divorce!"

A public apology would make Sophia the laughingstock of high society.

She couldn't bear that humiliation.

Nathan's icy stare made Sophia shrink back.

"Fine," he said coldly. "If not publicly, then we'll apologize at their doorstep."

"Absolutely not!" Margaret Blackwood protested. Having once treated Evelyn as inferior, she couldn't stomach bowing to her now.

"Enough!" Old Master Blackwood's face flushed with rage. He knew his grandson's capabilities. "Isn't there another way?"

"No." Nathan's expression darkened. "We've owed Evelyn this apology for too long."

With a heavy sigh, the old man relented. "Make the arrangements then."

"Grandpa!" Sophia whined.

Nathan turned his glacial gaze on her. "Sophia Blackwood, remember how you lost our family heirloom."

"One more misstep and you'll be cut off completely. Get a job like commoners do."

Sophia gasped. "Work? I'm a Blackwood! I'd be ridiculed!"

"Mother!" She turned to Margaret, who avoided her eyes, still guilty about the emerald pipe incident.

Nathan left without another word.

"Wait," his grandfather called. "I don't care about your affairs, but stay away from Vanessa Holloway. The Sterlings are furious, and we must repair relations."

Nathan didn't react, walking away silently.

Everyone had misunderstood his relationship with Vanessa - especially Evelyn.

Outside Blackwood Manor, Nathan called his assistant Harrison.

The PR department could draft an apology letter easily. The real challenge was Blackwood Corporation's stance.

It was a long night.

By noon the next day, as the world reeled from Evelyn's revelation as Sterling heiress, Blackwood Corporation issued a formal apology.

The letter debunked all internet rumors about Evelyn and included Nathan's personal apology for failing their marriage.

The internet exploded.

[Real-life drama! Someone pass the popcorn!]

[So they admit bullying Evelyn?]

[Indirect confession! Our Queen Evelyn is vindicated! Since her brave divorce announcement exposing the mistress, I'll always stand with her!]
###Chapter 124

Sterling Corporation.

Inside the boardroom.

All eyes were fixed on the powerful figures seated at the head of the long mahogany table. William Sterling reclined comfortably in his chair, eyes closed as he dozed off, having confidently left Alexander to oversee the proceedings.

Alexander cleared his throat and began his opening remarks before introducing Evelyn.

Evelyn had deliberately let her dark waves fall across her forehead to conceal the wound from last night’s incident. She didn’t want it drawing unnecessary attention.

"I believe everyone here is already aware that Evelyn is my father’s daughter—my sister," Alexander announced, his voice firm. "She is also the largest shareholder of Sterling Corporation. Effective immediately, I hereby appoint Evelyn Sinclair as the new Chief Executive Officer. I trust no one has any objections?"

The room remained silent.

Evelyn now commanded an empire far more expansive than before. Regardless of the whispers, she was now the formidable CEO of Sterling Corporation.

As she stepped out of the boardroom, Bennett approached her, phone in hand. "President Evelyn, Ferguson Corporation has just released their public apology."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Already?"

She had expected Old Master Blackwood’s pride to drag this out for at least another week, if not longer. A quick glance at the statement had her lips curling into a cold smirk. The wording was calculated—smoothly downplaying the scandal while clinically dissecting their failed marriage.

She recognized Nathan’s handiwork instantly.

"Do we need to issue a response?" Bennett asked.

Evelyn turned on her heel, flashing him a bright smile. "My brother must have a mountain of work lined up for me. If possible, delay whatever he’s arranged. I want to personally oversee the selection process for the Kingsley Tech research program. I won’t let Ferguson Corporation snatch it from under my nose."

She would never compromise when it came to her company’s interests.

Bennett nodded. "Understood, ma’am."

"By the way," he added, "would you like to review the list of gifts for the staff? They’re ready for distribution."

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Handle it as you see fit."

Her only role in this was signing the checks.

Bennett hesitated. "How’s your injury?"

He was the only one who knew about it. Otherwise, Evelyn wouldn’t have pushed through the meeting.

Her fingers brushed lightly over the concealed wound. "It’s fine. The doctor said it’s just a scratch. I’m not made of glass."

"The investigation report is already on your desk."

"Just give me the name." She was curious—who had wanted her dead?

Bennett’s expression darkened. "Vanessa Holloway."

Evelyn’s lips curved into a chilling smile, but she said nothing.
###Chapter 125

Dominic Kingsley was thrilled to hear that Evelyn Sinclair would be visiting personally and immediately gave her a call.

"President Sinclair, please bring that little troublemaker Leo with you when you come. The whole team misses him terribly."

Evelyn chuckled. "Absolutely! Consider it done."

This arrangement worked perfectly for Evelyn. She could use Leo to charm the Kingsley Tech team while keeping herself entertained during the visit.

The evening found Evelyn still buried in paperwork when the city lights flickered to life, stars beginning to dot the darkening sky.

She stretched her stiff muscles and reached for her designer handbag. Noticing the light still on in Alexander Sterling's office, a pang of guilt struck her. As CEO, she had it much easier compared to her overworked older brother.

Evelyn knocked lightly before peeking inside, finding Alexander still engaged in a video conference. He listened intently to the foreign executive's report, effortlessly catching every critical detail in the rapid-fire discussion. Spotting her, he gestured to a chair without breaking his professional demeanor.

She playfully stuck out her tongue before obediently taking a seat, quietly observing the meeting. From what she gathered, Blackwood Enterprises seemed to be facing significant challenges.

When the call finally ended, Alexander disconnected with a tap. Evelyn looked up, curiosity evident in her expression.

"Is our European division launching products similar to Blackwood's?"

Alexander nodded. "Same quality, but we're undercutting their prices. They won't survive this competition."

The targeted business strategy was unmistakable. Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly.

"Blackwood Enterprises issued a public apology today."

"I know. Father and I read it. But words mean nothing compared to the damage Nathan Blackwood caused you." Alexander's gaze sharpened. "Eric's clever though - their stock stabilized immediately after the apology. This minor dip means nothing to them."

Evelyn's lips thinned. "Thinking I'll go easy on them? Never." Her heart had turned to steel, impervious to softening.

"It's not just personal. Our European market share has always been split with Blackwood. This is our chance to dominate." Alexander leaned forward. "Don't forget - you're the one who broke into Europe first. You built Sterling Corporation's presence there single-handedly, making us the premier Montecito brand. Blackwood merely copied your blueprint."

His words struck a chord. Evelyn fell silent as memories flooded back. She'd nearly forgotten her own accomplishments.

In the cutthroat business world, morality took a backseat to opportunity. Within legal bounds, competition was fair game.

The past three years had made her lose sight of her worth. She'd once conquered Europe, establishing Sterling Corporation as the dominant force. That was her legacy.

Recalling these achievements reignited a fire within her.

The following evening found Evelyn alone at the private airport terminal. In the VIP lounge, her eyes immediately found the striking figure by the window - a man whose quiet intensity and effortless elegance made others instinctively respect him.

She crept up behind him and covered his eyes. "Guess who?"

The man sighed but didn't resist as she wrapped him in a bear hug. "Evelyn Mae Sinclair."

This was Donovan Sterling - world-renowned physicist, Breakthrough Prize winner at seventeen, whose groundbreaking papers were published in elite journals and revered by the scientific community.

Perhaps because his professional brilliance overshadowed everything else, few bothered to investigate his background. The scientific prodigy was, in fact, William Sterling's second son.

Donovan examined his sister critically before reaching out to touch her forehead.

Evelyn flinched away. "What was that for?"

"You got hurt?" His expression darkened.

"Just bumped into a doorframe," she lied smoothly.

Donovan accepted this with a nod. "Clumsy as ever."

As they walked, Donovan casually asked, "Heard you got married?"

Having spent five years abroad on classified research projects, he only occasionally exchanged messages with Lucas during rare breaks. Clearly, Evelyn's marriage had been a family scandal.

He produced a black credit card from his pocket. "All my prize money. Consider it a wedding gift."

The sum was astronomical. Since childhood, Donovan had always given his winnings to his little sister.

Evelyn blinked. "Actually, I just got divorced."

"Then it's a divorce gift." Donovan adjusted his designer suitcase, his face betraying no emotion whatsoever.
###Chapter 126

Evelyn giggled playfully and approached Donovan.

"Donny, could you do me a tiny favor? Consider it a birthday gift?"

Instead of answering immediately, Donovan raised an eyebrow.

"What kind of favor?"

She clasped her hands together, eyes sparkling with mischief. "I'm working on an AI project. Since you're literally the smartest person I know, could you help me with a small part of it?"

Evelyn batted her lashes, laying the flattery on thick.

Donovan was a national treasure—a genius whose brilliance was practically criminal to waste. But then again, what was the point of having a genius brother if she couldn't exploit his brain once in a while?

He considered for a moment before nodding. "Fine. I have a month off. Will that be enough?"

"More than enough!"

Before he could change his mind, Evelyn snatched the black credit card from his hand and waved it triumphantly. "And I'll be taking this too. Thanks, Donny!"

Donovan sighed, already regretting his decision.

Nearby, two sharply dressed men lingered in the shadows, watching the Sterling siblings with keen interest. They had been staking out the area all night, waiting for a certain elusive genius to appear.

Tristan Whitmore checked his phone for the tenth time. "Where the hell are those photos Harrison was supposed to send?"

His elbow nudged Nathan Blackwood's arm. "Well, well. Look who it is—Evelyn Sinclair."

Beside her stood a man they didn't recognize. Tall, composed, with an air of quiet intelligence. He didn’t carry himself like a businessman, but something far more intriguing.

Nathan's gaze locked onto Evelyn. Her dark waves cascaded over her shoulders, her emerald-green halter dress hugging every curve. The stilettos made her legs look endless.

She was laughing at something the man said, her smile radiant.

Nathan moved before he realized it, drawn toward her voice like a moth to flame.

"Why the sudden divorce?" Donovan asked casually.

Evelyn shrugged. "Because he died."

"Oh." Donovan accepted this with the same indifference as if she'd told him the weather.

Nathan and Tristan froze mid-step.

The allegedly deceased man in question stared at Evelyn's back, his expression unreadable.

Tristan burst out laughing and clapped Nathan on the shoulder. "Well, damn. You're officially a ghost."

His phone finally buzzed. Tristan glanced down—and nearly choked.

The photo was unmistakable.

It was the man standing right next to Evelyn.

Tristan's voice cracked. "No freaking way."

Nathan snatched the phone, his eyes widening.

Evelyn turned at the commotion, her smile vanishing the second she spotted them. "Ugh. Not you two again."

Tristan forced a grin and stepped forward. "Fancy meeting you here, Ms. Sterling!" He glanced at Donovan, barely containing his excitement. "This is—"

He couldn't even finish. The man they'd been hunting for months was right here, casually chatting with Evelyn like it was nothing.

And worse—they looked close.

Donovan nodded politely. "Hello. I'm Dr. Soren."

A pseudonym. One the world knew him by, though few had ever seen his face.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Are you stalking me now? Because I swear, you two pop up like bad pennies."

Tristan hesitated. Should he lie? But if he did, they'd lose this chance.

"We weren't stalking you," he said quickly. "We're here to meet a friend. Total coincidence!"

Evelyn gave him a flat look. "Then hurry up and disappear."

"Right. On it." Tristan turned to leave.

Nathan didn't move.

His gaze lingered on Evelyn, dark and unreadable, before shifting to Donovan. "Dr. Soren," he said slowly. "You two are friends?"

Donovan slid an arm around Evelyn's shoulders. "The best."

He wasn't lying.

In Donovan's world, "friends" were a rare commodity. He had exactly three—his siblings.

Evelyn tugged Donovan's arm. "Let's go."

She didn't spare Nathan a single glance.
###Chapter 127

Tristan Whitmore let out a heavy sigh.

"Well, well. We've completely lost our advantage now."

The legendary Donovan Sterling and Evelyn Sinclair not only knew each other but shared such a close bond!

Donovan's return had been kept strictly confidential—his entire itinerary was classified.

Given his highly sensitive position, it made sense.

They had spent a fortune on the international black market just to obtain details about Donovan's flight, and now, all that effort had gone to waste.

Nathan Blackwood shot Tristan a cold look before walking away without another word.

Meanwhile, Donovan and Evelyn returned to Sterling Manor.

Before they even stepped out of the car, they could hear the commotion inside—Archibald instructing the maids to tend to the garden tomorrow, Lucas's dramatic wailing, and William's furious shouting echoing from the living room.

Donovan paused at the doorway, glancing at Evelyn.

"Find me a place. Somewhere quiet. Preferably with no neighbors."

Evelyn blinked. "A haunted house?"

"That works."

As long as there are no humans around me, Donovan thought.

The moment the door opened, Lucas sprinted toward them, nearly tackling Evelyn.

"You're finally back! Save me!"

Evelyn scoffed, but before she could respond, Lucas froze at the sight of Donovan.

His jaw dropped.

"Donovan?"

A rare smile tugged at Donovan's lips. "Little L."

Lucas's panic vanished instantly. "How many times have I told you guys not to call me that?!"

"It makes me sound like a kid!"

"Who is it?" William's booming voice carried through the hall as he stormed out, baseball bat in hand.

The moment he spotted Donovan, his anger melted into excitement.

"Donovan!"

Donovan endured the enthusiastic embraces from the three men of the family.

Alexander was the most composed, but even he couldn't hide the pleased curve of his lips.

Archibald immediately sprang into action, ordering the staff to prepare a feast and ready Donovan's old room.

After three long years, the Sterling family was finally whole again.

Evelyn frowned at the chaos in the house. "What's going on here?"

At the mention of it, William's temper flared again.

"I asked your brother to cook, and this idiot threw out my prized Alba white truffle! He had the nerve to tell me it was just a deformed potato!"

William grabbed his bat, glaring at Lucas.

"I'm not letting this slide today!"

Alexander remained seated, his gaze steady on Donovan. "You're staying? What's next for you?"

Donovan accepted a glass of sparkling water from Archibald and took a sip.

"National Laboratories extended an invitation. I've decided to accept, but I won't be leaving for another month."

National Laboratories was a top-tier research institute with cutting-edge facilities, a place where even the brightest minds struggled to gain entry.

For Donovan, it had been a long-considered decision.

Alexander nodded in approval.

Evelyn cut in. "Donovan promised he'd help with Kingsley Tech's R&D project this month! That way, we won't let them outmaneuver us—we'll take the lead!"

Alexander's expression stiffened. His stunned gaze flickered between Donovan and Evelyn, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for his brother.

"Then... good luck."

Is a project this small even worth Donovan's time?

This sister really knows how to make the most of everything.

A few days later, once Donovan was well-rested, Evelyn began preparing for their move into Kingsley Tech.

The morning air was crisp, the weather perfect.

Evelyn dragged Donovan out the door, stopping first at her apartment to pick up Leo.

The AI tiger perked up at their arrival, leaping into Evelyn's arms.

"Mama! I missed you so much!"

"I missed you too, Leo. You didn't wreck the place, did you?"

Evelyn glanced around—the apartment was spotless.

This clever little tiger knew how to operate her smart home system.

There were even a few new packages scattered around, likely more gadgets Leo had ordered.

Leo nuzzled into Evelyn's arms sheepishly.

"I... might have used your credit card."

Evelyn burst out laughing.

She turned to Donovan, holding Leo up. "This is Leo. Leo, meet my second brother."

Leo's eyes sparkled with excitement.

"Wow! The Great Donovan Sterling! I'm your biggest fan!"

Evelyn immediately clamped a hand over his mouth.

"Stop embarrassing me!"

Donovan studied the AI tiger with mild interest, lifting it with one hand.

"World-class quantum physics system, advanced learning capabilities, adaptive temperature and moisture regulation... Who gave this to you?"

Leo beamed. "Emily Whitaker! The girl who added you on social media! I traded your contact info for it!"

Donovan shot Evelyn a dry look.

"Are you even my sister?"
###Chapter 128

Emily must adore you deeply to have programmed Leo with your data. That's why it's reacting this way. By the way, she's also part of Kingsley Tech's research team, so you'll meet her shortly.

Donovan casually tossed Leo toward Evelyn, who caught the AI tiger with careful hands.

"Leo, let's go find Emily!"

"But I want the Great Goddess to hold me!" Leo squirmed in Evelyn's arms, its mechanical voice tinged with childish petulance.

Evelyn could never refuse the adorable AI's requests. She quickened her pace to catch up with Donovan.

"Second Brother..."

Donovan had seen countless AI robots before and wasn't as enamored as Evelyn. To him, they were just sophisticated machines he could recreate at will.

When they arrived at Kingsley Tech headquarters, Leo immediately became the center of attention.

"Little Traitor, did you miss us?" one researcher teased.

Leo lifted its chin with mechanical haughtiness. "Who are you people?"

The crowd burst into laughter at its programmed sass.

Soon, someone escorted Leo to Emily Whitaker while Dominic Kingsley led their group of seven to the designated meeting area.

During the walk, Dominic kept glancing back at Donovan. "This gentleman seems familiar somehow..."

Before Evelyn could introduce him, Donovan spoke first. "My name is Sunner. We've never met."

Dominic nodded, unfazed. "Recent graduate? No matter - if Evelyn brought you, you must be exceptional."

Evelyn deliberately didn't mention wanting Donovan for the core R&D team. She wasn't interested in trade secrets, just staying ahead of industry developments. Donovan's true identity needed to remain hidden.

As they exited the elevator, Evelyn spotted another group approaching. Nathan Blackwood looked every inch the aristocratic CEO as he led his team of seven. Dominic stepped forward. "What a coincidence - all three project leads arriving together!"

"Mr. Blackwood, it's rare to see you personally leading a project team." Evelyn kept her tone professional despite the irritation bubbling beneath the surface.

Nathan's gaze flickered over Evelyn before settling on Dominic. "I've reviewed the site. My team will handle our own equipment needs. Since we're all here, let's begin." Evelyn walked past without another glance.

Nathan watched her retreating figure with unreadable intensity. Dominic clapped Nathan's shoulder with amusement. "Don't stare. She's President Sinclair now - even less likely to look back. Starting to regret things?"

Nathan's icy glare could freeze lava. "Mind your own business."

Dominic chuckled. "Then tell me your sudden personal involvement in this project has nothing to do with her?"

Initially, Dominic hadn't believed the exes would reconnect. But ever since Nathan asked him to arrange that dinner invitation, suspicions grew. Seeing Nathan here now confirmed them.

As they walked, Nathan frowned. "Do you have Stanton Corporation's participant list?"

Dominic forwarded it from his phone - non-confidential information anyway. "Sunner? Who's this?"

"Probably some new graduate," Dominic shrugged.

Nathan's lips curved slightly before schooling his expression. 'Evelyn actually convinced a national-level expert to join a commercial project? Impressive.'

He'd secretly hoped to recruit Donovan for this venture himself. With the renowned scientist involved, success was guaranteed. 'What an interesting coincidence,' Nathan mused.

Dominic found Nathan's sudden interest in a "student" peculiar.

Entering the conference room, Nathan's mood darkened further seeing Evelyn and "Sunner" whispering closely together, their heads nearly touching.

A muscle twitched in Nathan's jaw as he strode purposefully to the seat opposite Evelyn, his entire demeanor radiating displeasure.

Dominic took the head seat with an amused sigh. "On behalf of Kingsley Tech, I officially welcome our two partners. Regarding this research initiative, Blackwood Corporation has already deployed their team. Ms. Sinclair, who will represent your side?"

Evelyn smiled at Donovan. "Sunner, you'll handle this."

She unconsciously grasped Donovan's sleeve - a childhood habit. Donovan patted her hand affectionately in response.

Nathan's frown deepened at their familiar interaction.

Dominic nodded. "Excellent. He can meet with Emily Whitaker afterward."

Nathan's cold voice cut through. "Not just anyone qualifies for this clearance."

Evelyn lifted her chin defiantly. "I decide who represents Sterling Corporation."
###Chapter 129

The tension in the room lingered like an unspoken threat.

To Evelyn's relief, Nathan Blackwood didn't press the matter further. The discussion shifted to finalizing the project's direction.

The meeting dragged on for over an hour. By the time it concluded, rain had begun pelting against the windows.

As attendees rushed to their vehicles, they discovered the entrance steps had become a shallow pond from the downpour.

Evelyn hesitated at the threshold. Her custom Laurent Dubois heels, dazzling with embedded diamonds, weren't meant for wading through puddles.

The Sterling Corporation's Rolls-Royce waited just beyond the flooded area, the driver unable to maneuver closer through the downpour.

Donovan Sterling noticed his sister's predicament. With only one umbrella available, he automatically positioned it over Evelyn's head. "Shall we?"

Evelyn bit her lip, pointing her toes experimentally. "These diamonds will tarnish if they get wet."

Donovan's gaze swept over her outfit - the chic mini dress that made traditional carrying positions impossible without risking indecency.

Without hesitation, he shrugged off his tailored jacket and tossed it onto the flooded steps. Holding the umbrella steady with one hand, he extended the other. "Problem solved. Let's go."

Evelyn sighed dramatically but accepted the compromise.

She placed her hand in Donovan's, stepped delicately onto the sacrificed jacket, and slipped into the waiting car.

The driver witnessing this exchange mentally calculated his job security. Two other observers had very different reactions.

Dominic Kingsley shook his head in disbelief. "Now I understand what real diva behavior looks like! That woman probably complains if her champagne bubbles aren't perfectly symmetrical, yet you treated her like yesterday's news!"

Nathan's stormy gaze followed the departing vehicle, his jaw tightening. He knew exactly who Donovan Sterling really was.

Even world leaders vied for that man's attention, yet here he was playing footman to Evelyn. Their relationship clearly transcended professional boundaries. Just how close were they?

"Nikki!" A familiar voice cut through the rain.

Emily Whitaker came bounding toward them, Leo the mechanical tiger clutched in her arms. Evelyn brightened immediately, whispering to Donovan, "That's Emily Whitaker. She's brilliant but...enthusiastic."

Donovan barely had time to frown before Emily skidded to a stop before them. Her eyes widened comically when she recognized him.

"Holy mother of silicon chips! The Tech Titan!" Without ceremony, she dumped Leo in a puddle and launched herself at Donovan.

The renowned scientist turned sheet-white as Emily wrapped herself around him like human ivy.

"Unhand me this instant!" Donovan peeled her off with visible distress, his ears turning pink. "Have you no sense of personal space?"

Emily, starstruck beyond reason, barely registered the rejection. She gazed up at her idol with undisguised awe. "I'm Emily Whitaker! You've mentored me through seventeen failed prototypes!"

Donovan gave her a withering once-over. "Yes. The one who couldn't differentiate between binary code and baking instructions."

As Emily's face fell, Evelyn pinched Donovan's arm sharply.

He amended grudgingly, "Though Leo shows promise. Durable construction. Decent AI framework."

Emily's smile returned full-force. "He's just a prototype! I can make him smarter!"

The soggy mechanical tiger swiped at her ankle. "Smarter than you, meatbag!"

Emily ignored the insult, turning excitedly to Evelyn. "You know The Tech Titan? Is he your-"

"Friend," Evelyn interjected smoothly, linking arms with Donovan. "Be nice. She's my friend, not one of your unfortunate graduate students."

Donovan exhaled through his nose but remained silent.

Emily practically vibrated with excitement, shooting Evelyn a meaningful look.

Evelyn added, "He'll be consulting on our project. Emily, make sure he doesn't intimidate the entire R&D department."

Emily's jaw dropped. "The Tech Titan...taking orders from me?!"

Noting Emily's overwhelmed expression, Evelyn leaned close. "His involvement stays confidential for now."

Emily nodded dumbly.

As they prepared to leave, Evelyn's skirt caught in the car door. She yelped in surprise.

Donovan abandoned the umbrella without hesitation, kneeling to carefully free the delicate fabric. Noticing Emily's stunned expression, he said coolly, "Dispose of that for me," nodding toward the discarded jacket.

Before Emily could respond, Donovan slid into the car and shut the door, leaving her standing in the rain.

From his puddle, Leo grumbled, "Somebody remember the AI tiger?!"
###Chapter 130

Dominic Kingsley and Nathan Blackwood approached Emily Whitaker with measured steps.

Dominic's voice cut through the tension. "Emily, do you recognize the gentleman standing beside Ms. Sinclair?"

Emily remained transfixed by the sight of the formidable Donovan Sterling lowering himself to cater to Evelyn's every need. The scene stirred equal parts envy and admiration in her heart.

What a perfect match they make!

Her head bobbed in automatic agreement before she caught herself and shook it vehemently.

Evelyn had sworn her to secrecy!

Nathan's eyes narrowed to slits as Emily scooped up the discarded suit jacket and umbrella from the pavement. "I'm just a researcher," she muttered, fleeing the scene. "Business negotiations aren't my forte!"

Leo's mechanical eyes darted between the men as its internal systems prepared to dial Evelyn. A large hand intercepted the movement mid-air.

Nathan studied the robotic tiger with growing suspicion. "Do you still remember me?" His voice carried restrained fury.

The AI tiger thrashed its mechanical limbs in protest. "Jerk! I want Mommy!" it declared in halting tones.

Dominic's eyebrows shot up. "This little traitor used to adore you, Nathan. When did you become 'jerk' in its programming?"

Leo turned its head away with a mechanical sniff. "Unworthy!"

After all, its loyalty followed Evelyn's commands without question. Nathan's face darkened dangerously just as Harrison arrived with an umbrella.

Before the assistant could speak, Leo chirped, "Daddy! Kisses!"

Harrison froze like a statue, nearly dropping the umbrella under Nathan's glacial stare. "I swear I've never—"

"Daddy, you're so handsome!" Leo continued cheerfully.

Dominic erupted into laughter while Harrison looked ready to faint. "This isn't funny!" the assistant protested.

Their attention snapped to the returning Rolls-Royce. Nathan's expression turned arctic as the car door opened.

Donovan emerged, extending a hand. "I'm here for Leo."

Nathan practically threw the robotic tiger at him, his temper barely contained. His sharp gaze swept the empty backseat—Evelyn's absence spoke volumes.

"Donovan," Dominic began with deliberate casualness, "are you and Evelyn involved?"

The scientist's expression remained impassive. "That's classified."

Dominic smirked and gestured toward Nathan. "Do you know who this is?"

Donovan studied Nathan briefly before shaking his head. "Should I?"

Before Dominic could explain, Nathan bit out, "I'm her dead ex-husband." The words Evelyn had used at the airport still burned.

Donovan nodded once. "Then I definitely shouldn't tell you." With that, he disappeared into the luxury vehicle.

Dominic's laughter followed the departing car. "He's got the same sharp tongue as Ms. Sinclair!"

Nathan's murderous glare silenced him instantly.

Meanwhile, Donovan collected Evelyn from a nearby station platform. She cradled Leo remorsefully. "I'm so sorry, baby. Mommy didn't mean to leave you behind!"

The robotic tiger nuzzled against her dramatically. "Then I want a Mesgarzadeh rug!"

Evelyn blinked. While other pets demanded treats, hers had developed a taste for luxury decor. "Fine," she sighed. "You win."

Donovan shot the machine a disdainful look. What a spoiled little beast.
###Chapter 131

Donovan Sterling glanced at his phone and frowned.

His patience was wearing thin as he meticulously corrected the form sent by Emily Whitaker. Perfectionism was both his strength and his curse.

To find the perfect office for Donovan, Evelyn Sinclair decided to bring Isabella Montgomery along to the nearest real estate agency.

The two women paused in front of an upscale property sales office.

"Does your family even need more properties? Sterling Corporation owns half the city—can't you just pick one?" Isabella raised an eyebrow.

Evelyn shook her head. "No, those are all commercial spaces—too loud, too crowded. Donovan would hate it."

This particular agency exuded quiet luxury, clearly catering to high-end clientele.

"This is a Kensington Group property. Ms. Sinclair, are you sure you're in the right place?"

A cold, familiar voice cut through the air behind her.

Evelyn turned, meeting the woman’s icy gaze.

"Olivia Kensington?"

A slow smirk curved Evelyn’s lips. "Even better."

"You're not welcome here. Get out."

Olivia’s tone was sharp, her expression shifting from professional to venomous in an instant.

If it weren’t for Evelyn, Olivia wouldn’t have fallen from a high-powered executive to a mere sales agent. Industry rivals had used her scandal to crush her reputation. Her life had spiraled into ruin.

"Did I hear that right?" Isabella scoffed. "You're telling us to leave?"

"Yes. Get out. This office won’t serve you." Olivia’s arrogance was palpable.

Without hesitation, Evelyn tapped her phone screen a few times.

"Who doesn’t know how to make a scene?"

Within moments, a composed sales manager approached, her eyes widening slightly when she recognized Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair? Is there a problem?"

"Is she your employee?" Isabella tilted her chin, disdain dripping from her words.

The manager glanced at Olivia and forced a polite smile.

"Olivia is one of our top agents—studied abroad, elite education, comes from a wealthy family but chose to build her own career. She’s well-liked here. Did something happen?"

Evelyn’s gaze darkened with amusement. Olivia’s face twitched before she plastered on a fake smile.

"Manager, it’s just a misunderstanding. Let me handle this."

Evelyn tapped her phone again—this time, playing a recording at full volume.

"You're not welcome here. Get out. This office won’t serve you."

Olivia’s face drained of color.

The manager’s expression hardened. "Olivia, you’re fired."

"You can’t do this!" Olivia’s voice cracked. "She’s Evelyn Sinclair—she came here to humiliate me!"

"Enough!" The manager snapped. "The client is always right. Pack your things and leave."

"On what grounds?" Olivia seethed.

"Because I’m the client." Evelyn smirked. "And Olivia? Since when were you a wealthy heiress?"

Every word the manager had praised her for was a lie.

Evelyn leaned back, interlacing her fingers, her smile sweet and mocking.

"Trying to prove something? Olivia Kensington, you were never in my league."

Security arrived. If Olivia didn’t leave willingly, they’d escort her out.

Evelyn’s laughter was light, her eyes glinting with victory.

"Did you really think you could win?"
###Chapter 132

Blackwood Corporation President's Office.

The silence was so profound you could hear the second hand ticking on the antique grandfather clock.

Nathan Blackwood drummed his fingers rhythmically against the mahogany desk, each tap making Harrison's shoulders tense further.

His piercing gaze darkened as he spoke in an icy tone. "She went to purchase property at our sales office?"

Harrison stood at attention. "Yes, sir. The sales team confirmed it personally. I've reviewed the security footage."

"Ms. Sinclair arrived with Ms. Montgomery. They're still there as we speak."

Nathan's stormy eyes narrowed. After a weighted pause, he rose abruptly. "Let's go see what this is about."

Though Nathan couldn't fathom Evelyn's motives, he needed to witness this bizarre situation firsthand.

"Right away, sir." Harrison nodded, already feeling the atmospheric shift around his boss.

Nathan's reactions where Evelyn was concerned always defied expectation.

The sales director was enthusiastically presenting luxury penthouse options. "Ms. Sinclair, does this floorplan suit your needs? Will you be residing here personally?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It's a gift actually. For a bachelor recently returned from overseas." She tapped the brochure decisively. "Replace any existing furnishings with Swiss imports - top quality only. Price is no object."

"My brother deserves nothing but the best."

"Yes, of course, miss-"

Nathan froze in the doorway, his entire body going rigid. 'She's buying property for some bachelor? That damned Sebastian Hart?' The scandalous headlines practically wrote themselves: [Evelyn Sinclair Purchases Blackwood Property to House New Lover - How Pathetic!]

(Honestly, this situation was almost comical. Only Evelyn could pull such a bold move. Maybe Mr. Blackwood should personally recommend properties for his ex-wife's new man!)

The paperwork was straightforward. Evelyn barely glanced at the contract - she'd chosen this unit for its rare combination of privacy and panoramic views.

If the interior didn't meet standards, she'd simply have it gutted and redesigned. Hardly an inconvenience.

After signing, she checked the time on her platinum Jaeger-LeCoultre watch. "I'll process payment now." As she reached for her clutch, sudden commotion erupted at the entrance.

The sales director immediately bowed. "Good afternoon, President Blackwood!"

Nathan approached Evelyn, his voice deceptively calm. "Made your selection?" He'd heard every damning word, yet still asked - a glutton for punishment.

Evelyn didn't turn at his voice, though she felt the heat of his stare burning between her shoulder blades.

The room's atmosphere turned arctic.

The sales director cleared his throat nervously. "Since President Blackwood is here personally, and you're... acquainted, we could extend our corporate discount-"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as shattered glass. "We're not friends. Keep your discount."

Tension thickened to suffocating levels.

Finally, Evelyn turned to meet Nathan's stormy gaze head-on. "Does every client receive personal attention from the CEO? Or am I just... special?"

"You've always been special, Evelyn," Nathan murmured, his voice rough.

Her eyebrow arched. "Special how? Because I'm Sterling Corporation's CEO now? Is this VIP treatment?"

Nathan stepped closer, invading her space. "You're my ex-wife. That makes you different from anyone else."
###Chapter 133

The word "ex-wife" left a bitter taste in Nathan Blackwood's mouth.

An inexplicable tightness gripped his chest.

"Which property catches your eye? I'll purchase it for you," Nathan offered abruptly.

His mind flashed back to the Lumière Fashion Week, where Evelyn Sinclair had playfully demanded a yacht from Lucas Sterling.

That memory stung like salt in an open wound.

Nathan realized with sudden clarity that he'd never gifted Evelyn anything during their marriage.

Perhaps if she accepted this gesture now, the gnawing guilt might subside.

Evelyn's laughter rang hollow, her emerald eyes devoid of warmth.

"How generous of you, Mr. Blackwood. Is this how you treat all your exes?"

Nathan's jaw tightened as he started to respond, but Evelyn cut him off sharply. "You said it yourself - I'm your ex-wife. That means we're strangers now. I won't accept anything from you, lest your family accuses me of being a gold digger again."

She turned to the sales agent. "I'll be paying in full." The thought of owing Nathan anything, especially for something so trivial, turned her stomach. The Blackwood fortune was the last thing she wanted to touch.

The agent hesitated, glancing nervously between Evelyn and Nathan, whose expression darkened by the second. Harrison discreetly signaled the agent to proceed, understanding the tension better than most.

Nathan's phone shattered the silence. The caller's panicked voice carried clearly: "Emergency! Vanessa Holloway's been in a car accident - she's lost critical blood volume!"

Evelyn didn't need to strain to hear. That name always triggered her instincts like a sixth sense.

Nathan's face drained of color, a storm of emotions brewing beneath his carefully controlled exterior.

"I'm on my way." He ended the call, his obsidian eyes locking onto Evelyn's. "Vanessa—"

"Spare me the details," Evelyn interrupted with a mocking smile. "Really, Nathan, how naive can you be? Does Ms. Holloway have nine lives? She miraculously survives every time you come running."

Nathan's entire body went rigid, his knuckles whitening around his phone.

"Thank goodness I declined your gift. Otherwise, I might be expected to donate blood to your precious Vanessa. Save your mansion for her - pray she lives long enough to actually become your wife." Evelyn's words dripped with venom as she turned her back on him.

Nathan stood rooted to the spot, his expression thunderous.

"Sir, we should leave immediately," Harrison urged, having received his own urgent call from the hospital.

At Montecito General Hospital...

Tristan Whitmore stood sentinel outside the private ward while Sophia Blackwood cowered in the corner, her entire body trembling.

"What happened?" Nathan's voice could have frozen hell over.

Tristan pointed an accusing finger at Sophia. "Ask her."

Under her brother's withering glare, Sophia finally broke. "It's not my fault! Blame that witch Evelyn! She drove Vanessa to this!"

Nathan's eyes turned glacial. "Explain yourself."

He'd just been with Evelyn - there was no possible way she could be involved in Vanessa's accident.

Sophia dissolved into hysterical sobs. "Vanessa said Evelyn only hates our family because of her! That if she died, Evelyn would stop tormenting us! So she ran into traffic - don't you see? Evelyn might as well have pushed her herself!"
###Chapter 134

Tristan was at a loss for words, rubbing his temples in frustration.

He rose from his seat, giving Nathan's shoulder a firm pat before exhaling heavily. "I'm not switching sides, but Evelyn is genuinely innocent this time."

Evelyn's disdain was solely directed at Nathan, yet Vanessa had somehow twisted it into some imagined rivalry. Since when had the proud Vanessa Holloway become so paranoid? She was creating drama where none existed. With another weary sigh, Tristan walked away.

Sophia, meanwhile, couldn't stop hurling insults at Evelyn—though her hatred ran deeper than just Vanessa’s influence.

She despised Evelyn, seething with jealousy over how effortlessly Evelyn had become the Sterling heiress overnight. Overnight, Evelyn’s status had skyrocketed among the elite.

And what about men? Sophia thought bitterly.

Their positions had completely reversed. Now, Sophia was the one looked down upon. Her family had turned against her, cutting off her allowance—all because of that damned emerald Evelyn had taken.

"Evelyn ruined my life!" Sophia muttered under her breath.

"Enough!" Nathan’s icy voice cut through the room.

Sophia recoiled, tears streaming as she stormed out, wailing, "You're all against me!"

Nathan remained by the door, his expression dark and unreadable. Inside the hospital room, Vanessa sat quietly, her face unnaturally pale.

Harrison returned with an update. "Mr. Blackwood, the hospital has sufficient Rh-null blood in stock. Ms. Holloway’s injuries are minor—just superficial abrasions."

Nathan’s mind flashed back to Evelyn’s mocking words: "Mr. Blackwood, are you really this dense? Does Vanessa have nine lives? She miraculously survives every time you’re around."

Vanessa’s eyes brightened the moment Nathan stepped inside. "Nathan… if only I had died, I wouldn’t be such a burden. Did Evelyn give you trouble? She’s gone too far this time!"

Nathan’s gaze was frigid, his voice detached. "Too far? She donated blood to save you, and this is how you repay her? Not even a word of thanks?"

Vanessa’s face drained of color.

She stammered, "N-no, that’s not what I meant! Of course, I’m grateful, but she lied about her identity—"

Nathan’s expression remained stone-cold. "And what does that have to do with you?"

Aside from William Sterling ejecting Vanessa from the anniversary gala—where she had been an uninvited guest—Evelyn had done nothing to her.

Nathan stood rigid, an unshakable irritation simmering in his chest. His tone was final. "Once Theodore Hart’s memorial is over, you’re returning to France. The medical care there is better suited for your recovery. After three months, I’m cutting off your allowance. You’re not disabled—find a way to support yourself."

Vanessa’s eyes widened in panic. "Nathan, please—!"

Tristan cleared his throat from the doorway. "Come on, it’s just money. Why be so harsh?"

Nathan didn’t give them a chance to argue. He grabbed his jacket and strode out.

"If it’s nothing to you, then you take over."

Tristan froze, his lips twitching. "I—I can’t. My funds are tied up."

Vanessa felt like discarded trash, humiliation burning through her. Her fingers clenched the fabric of her gown, trembling with rage.
###Chapter 135

Before dawn broke, another scandal erupted.

Paparazzi shots of Nathan Blackwood entering and exiting the hospital went viral across social media.

The headline screamed: Blackwood's Mystery Woman Hospitalized - Secret Affair Exposed!

Accompanying the article was a damning photo of Vanessa Holloway lying in a hospital bed while Nathan stood by the doorway, gazing at her with unmistakable tenderness.

[That's definitely love! How shameless of that homewrecker to think she could replace Evelyn!]

[Rich men have no morals. Though you've got to admit, she's got skills!]

[Queen Evelyn should focus on her empire. Who needs a man when you're that powerful?]

[My ship has officially sunk. No reconciliation now, but stay strong Evelyn! We still adore you!]

[Is there a waiting list to date CEO Sinclair? Asking for a friend...]

Evelyn woke to her phone buzzing before she could share her exciting news with Donovan about finding him a new lab space.

Isabella's calls were more reliable than any alarm clock. "Evie! Have you seen the trending news? Nathan Blackwood is making headlines again!"

Evelyn groaned, rubbing sleep from her eyes. "Gossip or actual scandal?"

"Full-blown scandal!" Isabella declared. "The internet's going wild over it."

With a sigh, Evelyn grabbed her tablet and opened the trending tab. Sure enough, Nathan's name dominated the feed - alongside hers. Her lips twisted in irritation. "Why am I dragged into this again?"

"Don't worry, you're not the main character this time," Isabella reassured. Whenever Evelyn's name appeared with Nathan's, it never spelled anything good.

Evelyn made a dismissive sound. "Not discussing him. I'm going for my morning run." If Vanessa had actually perished in that accident, Evelyn might have popped champagne. But since the woman persisted in making her existence everyone's problem...

The crisp morning air carried the fresh scent of rain, invigorating her senses.

After texting Donovan the new lab address, Evelyn headed out with just her phone.

The moment she stepped beyond her gated community, a swarm of cameras and microphones assaulted her.

"Ms. Sinclair! Is it true about Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Holloway?"
"Did you order the hit on Vanessa's car?"
"Will Sterling Corp continue partnering with Blackwood Enterprises?"

Before Evelyn could respond, someone jostled her, sending her phone clattering to the pavement. She couldn't even bend to retrieve it amidst the chaos. Why were these vultures camped at her home? If they wanted dirt on Nathan and Vanessa, why not harass them instead?

Evelyn stumbled backward, panic rising.

Just as she teetered off balance, a strong arm encircled her waist. Lucas's chiseled profile came into view, his usually charming features dark with fury.

Evelyn's eyes inexplicably stung.

Lucas shielded her against his chest, glaring daggers at the reporters. "Which outlets do you represent?" His voice could have frozen hell.

The crowd hesitated but didn't lower their devices.

While Lucas's unexpected appearance was newsworthy, seasoned journalists knew better than to cross him. Rumors spoke of an entertainment magazine that once tried exposing his private life - only to mysteriously go bankrupt within weeks.

A rookie reporter, unaware of this unspoken rule, pressed forward. "Ms. Sinclair, what's your relationship with Lucas Sterling? Care to comment on Nathan Blackwood and Vanessa Holloway? Did you have any involvement in the accident?"
###Chapter 136

Evelyn Sinclair was seething with barely contained rage.

How dare they ambush her like this?

Her fists clenched involuntarily, nails digging into her palms.

Lucas Sterling's presence beside her gave her courage.

"Excuse me, I'm not some celebrity who has to entertain your ridiculous questions. One more step and I'm calling security."

Her voice rang out sharp and unyielding.

Did they think she was some desperate starlet who'd cower before scandal?

"Let me make this crystal clear - Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Holloway deserve each other. As for her secret identity, that's as much a surprise to me as anyone. But accusing me without evidence? That's beyond absurd."

She paused dramatically.

"If Vanessa gets struck by lightning tomorrow, will you blame me for controlling the weather too?"

A few reporters couldn't suppress nervous chuckles at her sarcasm.

Evelyn took a steadying breath before delivering her final blow.

"From now on, keep my name out of your filthy tabloid stories about those two. And don't you dare try to use my reputation to boost your pathetic clickbait!"

With that, she turned on her heel and stormed off, leaving Lucas behind.

The reporters exchanged uneasy glances. Only the Sterling siblings would dare speak to the press like this. They shuffled awkwardly, unsure whether to pursue the story.

Lucas's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "No questions for me? Not even about my relationship with Evelyn? Or how I feel about Nathan's little scandal?"

Though it was exactly what they wanted to ask, the reporters knew better than to provoke Lucas Sterling. As they began dispersing, Lucas grabbed the lead journalist's arm.

"Leaving so soon?" His voice dropped to a threatening whisper.

The veteran reporter paled. "W-we have nothing else to ask, Mr. Sterling."

"Morning Chronicle, right?" Lucas's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Shall I call your editor? Maybe discuss how your rag will be blacklisted from every red carpet event this season?"

The other reporters scattered like frightened rabbits.

The lead journalist swallowed hard. "Alright! I'll talk!"

Lucas adjusted the man's collar with mock gentleness. "Smart choice. Cooperation ensures... future opportunities."

Through gritted teeth, the reporter confessed, "It was Sophia Blackwood."

Lucas's eyes turned glacial. Leaning in, he whispered instructions that made the reporter blanch. When the man hesitated, Lucas scoffed. "Unwilling? Plenty of other outlets would jump at this exclusive."

"I'll do it!" The reporter agreed hastily, knowing refusal meant career suicide. He bitterly regretted taking Sophia's bribe.

Lucas shoved a check into the man's pocket. "Consider this an advance. And remember - if I see Evelyn's name in your gutter press again..."

The reporter dared one final question. "What exactly is your relationship with Ms. Sinclair?"

Lucas's gaze turned predatory. "I protect what's mine. You figure out the rest."

The man fled without another word.

With a satisfied smirk, Lucas picked up Evelyn's dropped phone and strolled back upstairs.

He found her dressed for work. "Still here?" she asked coolly.

Lucas flicked her forehead. "Ungrateful brat." He tossed her the phone. "Hire security. You're not some nobody anymore - keep that fire you showed downstairs."

Evelyn snatched the phone and dialed Horizon Media's CEO right in front of him.

"Dominic? I don't care what it costs. I want Nathan Blackwood exposed as a cheating bastard and Vanessa Holloway's reputation in ruins. Make it trend for three days straight."
###Chapter 137

Lucas realized he had severely misjudged his sister's capabilities.

Hearing Evelyn's sharp retort to the reporter, he regretted being too lenient with the instructions he'd given the journalist earlier.

"Impressive! She's finally showing her true strength!" Lucas thought with pride.

Evelyn ended the call with icy composure and turned to Lucas. "I have a meeting at the office. What are your plans?"

Seeing how unaffected she was by the media storm, Lucas grinned mischievously. "I was thinking of taking Leo home. Dad's been driving me crazy lately - I need something cute to distract him!"

The image of their father doting on the AI tiger instead of nagging him brought a satisfied smirk to Lucas's face.

After brief consideration, Evelyn nodded. With her upcoming commitments at Kingsley Tech, she wouldn't have time for Leo anyway. Having her family care for him was the perfect solution.

Lucas practically bounced with excitement, his cheerful demeanor a complete contrast to the intimidating presence he'd shown the reporter moments ago.

"Perfect! You go handle your meeting then—"

To Evelyn's astonishment, Lucas effortlessly accessed her penthouse using biometrics she didn't remember granting him, immediately scooping up the mechanical tiger in a bear hug.

"I definitely didn't authorize his fingerprints," Evelyn muttered, shaking her head.

Kingsley Tech Headquarters

Harrison rushed into Nathan's office with urgent news. The internet was ablaze with a viral video showing Evelyn's fiery confrontation with reporters. Her stunning beauty, razor-sharp wit, and unshakable confidence had captivated the online world.

[QUEEN BEHAVIOR! Evelyn doesn't owe anyone explanations!]
[Vanessa's the one who should be ashamed, not our CEO!]
[That car did the world a favor hitting that manipulative witch!]
[Lucas is absolute husband material! Shame he only got one line...]

Nathan's expression darkened as he scanned the comments. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Who authorized those reporters to ambush her?"

Harrison blinked in confusion. "That's your main concern? Sir, you're currently public enemy number one! If you don't issue a statement soon—"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Harrison swallowed hard before continuing. "Perhaps they were... overzealous? The public can't get enough of you and Evelyn's story."

Nathan's piercing gaze made Harrison instantly regret his choice of words. "Perhaps?"

The video showed Evelyn's initial vulnerability before Lucas arrived, and how her confidence grew with her brother's support. Harrison could practically feel Nathan's rage radiating through the room.

"Ms. Sinclair isn't being disturbed anymore," Harrison quickly assured him. "Everything's under control now."

Nathan's responding glare could have frozen lava.

Within minutes, Harrison's shirt was soaked with sweat. As Nathan's most trusted assistant, he still couldn't comprehend why his boss had become so invested in Evelyn's affairs post-divorce.

During their three-year marriage, Nathan had shown little interest. Why this sudden obsession after their separation?

At Kingsley Tech, the collaborative project was progressing smoothly. The initial phase required daily meetings between all parties to adjust strategies based on real-time developments.

Still shaken from her earlier car accident, Evelyn opted to take the company car rather than drive herself.

As she arrived at Kingsley Tech, a familiar Range Rover caught her eye across the street.

Its owner stood tall and imposing, his chiseled features set in their usual cold expression. The air around him seemed to crackle with restrained energy.

Evelyn pretended not to notice him as she stepped out of her car. Her emerald green halter dress accentuated her graceful figure while projecting an air of quiet authority.

Nathan moved to intercept her, desperate to explain that he hadn't orchestrated the media ambush. He couldn't bear the thought of her misunderstanding his intentions.

But Evelyn walked past without sparing him a glance, her head held high as she entered the building alone.
###Chapter 138

Evelyn Sinclair didn't so much as glance in Nathan Blackwood's direction.

Not only did she refuse to acknowledge him, she walked straight past him into Kingsley Tech's lobby with her designer bag clutched tightly in hand.

Every inch of her - from her stiletto heels to the way she tossed her hair - radiated deliberate indifference toward Nathan.

The security guard immediately sprang to open the glass doors for her.

"Thank you," she murmured politely before striding inside without hesitation.

Nathan's brow furrowed as he watched her. Her blatant disregard made his chest constrict painfully.

She truly doesn't give a damn about me anymore. I can't read her at all. The realization hit him like a physical blow.

As Nathan approached the entrance, a swarm of reporters suddenly materialized from the side of the building.

Dozens of journalists surrounded him, cameras flashing, microphones thrust forward aggressively.

"Mr. Blackwood, is it true you're planning to marry Vanessa Holloway this year?"

"Do you actually have feelings for your mistress?"

"How many women are you currently seeing, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Will the Blackwood family accept a homewrecker as your bride?"

"Why did you purchase trending topics to slander Ms. Sinclair? Don't you owe her an apology?"

Nathan's expression darkened dangerously as he stood frozen in place.

His piercing glare locked onto the most vocal reporter in front.

The man immediately shrank back under the intensity of that stare.

The chaotic scene continued as reporters shouted over each other.

Kingsley Tech's security team quickly intervened, creating a path through the media frenzy.

Nathan didn't move. His voice cut through the noise like ice. "If any of you dare approach me again, I'll ensure you never work in this industry again." His threats were never empty.

An eerie silence fell over the crowd. No one dared breathe too loudly, exchanging nervous glances. Even the reporter who'd accepted Lucas Sterling's bribe kept his mouth shut.

Up on the second-floor balcony, Evelyn leaned casually against the railing, observing the scene below. Nathan's reaction was predictable - always so composed, always so intimidating.

That overwhelming presence was exactly what made him such a formidable CEO.

The man could shake all of New York with a single step.

Evelyn's lips twisted downward.

No matter how much Nathan doted on Vanessa Holloway, the woman would always be branded a homewrecker.

And Evelyn had prepared a special surprise for her.

Nathan's gaze suddenly lifted, locking onto Evelyn's position. Their eyes met across the crowded lobby, an electric current passing between them.

Evelyn's frown transformed into a smirk. She raised one perfectly arched brow in undisguised amusement. Enjoying the show?

Nathan's dark eyes burned into hers. Evelyn straightened, clicking her heels against the marble floor. She silently mouthed three words before turning away.

No one else seemed to notice.

The reporters were finally ejected, restoring calm to the entrance.

Dominic Kingsley emerged from his office to greet them.

Nathan remained rooted in place, still processing what he'd seen.

She'd clearly mouthed: "Karma's a bitch."

Evelyn disappeared into the conference room. Nathan eventually followed.

Once seated across from each other, the project manager began presenting updates.

When the presentation concluded, Dominic Kingsley cleared his throat.

"With the preliminary phase wrapping up, we should discuss the pilot location. Urban setting or suburban? I'd like your thoughts."

"The suburbs," Nathan stated firmly. "AI technology still needs refinement. An accident would be easier to contain outside city limits."

Evelyn cut in sharply. "If the AI is meant for urban implementation, testing in an unfamiliar environment defeats the purpose."

"You seem determined to oppose me at every turn," Nathan observed dryly.

Why else would she consistently challenge his suggestions?

Evelyn gave a derisive laugh, meeting his gaze with icy detachment. "Mr. Blackwood, you can drop the 'seem to be.'"
###Chapter 139 Cheating Scum Deserve Hell

Nathan Blackwood's relentless harm toward Evelyn Sinclair had cemented her hostility against him permanently.

Dominic Kingsley shifted uncomfortably between the two. The tension in the room became suffocating.

Nathan's dark gaze never left Evelyn as he studied her cold expression. Her undisguised contempt revealed the depth of her hatred.

It felt like an invisible hand was crushing his heart.

Dominic cleared his throat. "I believe Ms. Sinclair's proposal has merit..."

Eventually, Nathan had no choice but to accept Evelyn's terms.

As the meeting adjourned, Harrison rushed to Nathan's side. "Sir, Blackwood Enterprises' stocks are crashing..."

Evelyn, being the last to leave, overheard everything.

'Serves them right,' she thought smugly.

"Get to the point," Nathan snapped.

Harrison handed over a tablet displaying blazing red headlines:

"Cheating Scum Nathan Blackwood & Vanessa Holloway Deserve Hell!"

The post used their real names without fear of consequences.

Comments and shares exploded, directly impacting Blackwood's stock value.

[Did Evelyn Sinclair buy this trending topic? Revenge moves fast!]
[Money can't buy love but sure buys justice!]
[Team Evelyn forever! Let's start her fan club!]

Nathan scanned the comments before locking eyes with Evelyn, who was calmly discussing with Dominic.

She met his gaze briefly before dismissing him entirely.

"Nathan." His voice cut through the room.

Evelyn smirked. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

Dominic noticed the electric tension between them.

"Did you orchestrate this?" Nathan demanded.

Evelyn tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Guilty as charged."

Her admission hung in the air.

Nathan's expression darkened, but Evelyn continued, "Now you know how public humiliation feels."

Her icy stare could freeze hell itself.

"Control your sister and girlfriend. If they harass me again, I'll make them internet famous."

Evelyn knew Sophia Blackwood had sent those reporters on Vanessa's behalf.

Nathan frowned. "What harassment?"

"Ask them yourself." Evelyn turned to Dominic. "We'll continue this later."

As she left, Dominic sighed. "This isn't just business drama..."

Nathan turned sharply. "Take it down now! What's PR doing?"

Harrison hesitated. "Sir, Horizon Media's backing this. Their CEO Dominic Young is working with Lucas Sterling and foreign outlets. The platform's been hacked repeatedly - we can't trace it."

He added carefully, "Ms. Blackwood did provoke Ms. Sinclair first. An apology might be prudent."

Evelyn had outmaneuvered them completely.

Dominic thought privately, 'Never cross a brilliant woman...'

"Get Sophia here NOW!" Nathan stormed out.
###Chapter 140

Sophia Blackwood was summoned to Kingsley Tech headquarters.

Even her phone had been taken away.

She stood there, shoulders slumped, lifting her gaze hesitantly.

"Brother, why did you call me here so suddenly?"

Nathan Blackwood's expression was glacial.

His voice cut like steel. "You know exactly why."

Sophia shivered but refused to admit anything.

"How would I know?"

"You don't?" Nathan scoffed before barking toward the door. "Bring him in!"

Harrison ushered in the lead journalist from the scandal.

The man entered with a nervous smile, bowing deeply. "Mr. Blackwood. Ms. Blackwood."

Sophia's face twisted in betrayal.

She lunged for Nathan's arm. "Brother, don't listen to him! Everything he says is a lie! I never hired anyone to smear Evelyn!"

The journalist hadn't even spoken yet.

Nathan's eyes darkened, the temperature in the room plummeting.

Sophia recoiled, fear prickling down her spine.

Her grip slackened. "I... I didn't mean for things to go this far."

"Sophia Blackwood, do you still think this is just a harmless mistake?" Nathan's voice was lethally quiet.

An oppressive silence filled the air.

Sophia stumbled back. For the first time, she realized her brother's patience had run out.

Her mother's warning echoed in her mind: Never test Nathan's limits.

Why is Evelyn his line in the sand? Why can't I touch her?

Resentment burned in her chest. She opened her mouth to play the victim—

But the journalist blurted out, "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Blackwood still owes the final payment, but since the plan failed, I won't ask for it. Just let me go!"

Sophia whirled on him. "Shut your mouth, you idiot!"

Nathan's voice was arctic. "You have one choice. Apologize to Evelyn. Now."

"Why should I?" Sophia snapped. "It's not like it even worked!"

The online backlash had backfired spectacularly—damaging Kingsley Tech instead of Evelyn.

Nathan's gaze could have frozen hell. "Refuse, and you'll never see another cent from this family."

Sophia paled.

"Nor will anyone lend to you under the Blackwood name. I'll make sure of it."

Her breath hitched. He wasn't bluffing.

Trembling, she choked out, "Why do you protect her? You're divorced! Shouldn't you be with Vanessa Holloway? Who is Evelyn to you?"

Nathan stepped closer, his voice a blade.

"Because of your amateur scheming, Kingsley Tech's stocks crashed. We lost over a billion dollars in hours."

The room turned to ice.

Sophia's lips parted soundlessly.

A billion? I only paid that reporter six figures!

Nathan continued, cold and precise. "And Vanessa Holloway means nothing to me. She will never be part of this family."

Sophia's blood ran cold.

Had she misread everything?

Nathan turned on his heel and left.

The door clicked shut.

Harrison adjusted his glasses, addressing the journalist. "You may leave. But remember—stick to celebrity gossip. Dig into business again, and you'll disappear."

The man fled.

Then Harrison turned to Sophia.

"Ms. Blackwood, your grandfather demands your presence."

Sophia's hope flared. "Grandfather would never—"

"He gave you twenty minutes. Fail to arrive, and your name will be struck from the Blackwood registry. Permanently."

Her knees buckled.
###Chapter 141

Sophia Blackwood never anticipated her impulsive act would wreak such havoc on Blackwood Enterprises while Evelyn Sinclair, her intended target, remained unscathed.

Returning to Highland Estates, Old Master Blackwood berated Sophia relentlessly for hours. Not a single soul dared to intervene. Like Nathan, the patriarch believed Sophia owed Evelyn an apology.

As punishment, Sophia was confined to the estate's memorial hall, forced to kneel throughout the night.

The following day marked Theodore Hart's death anniversary.

Evelyn never expected to encounter Vanessa Holloway and Nathan Blackwood at Theodore's gravesite. Sebastian Hart spotted them too, his expression darkening as he pulled Evelyn back protectively.

"Don't worry about me, Theodore," Vanessa murmured to the headstone, casting a demure glance at Nathan. "Nathan's been taking excellent care of me." Her voice softened further. "I know you're troubled about Evelyn, Nathan. I'll depart for Paris immediately so she won't target you anymore. It's better I withdraw gracefully than cause more complications."

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly. Before he could respond, a derisive snort echoed behind them.

The sound dripped with contempt.

Turning, they found Evelyn smirking, her arched brows framing icy eyes. She wore a simple black knee-length dress, yet radiated striking elegance.

"Ms. Holloway, if you're so reluctant to part with Mr. Blackwood, perhaps you should stay," Evelyn taunted. Did Vanessa truly believe she could escape so easily? Their reckoning was far from over.

Vanessa's demeanor shifted instantly. "Why are you here?" she demanded, her shock morphing into venomous glare.

Sebastian stepped forward, his voice laced with accusation. "That's our question! What business do you have at my brother's grave?"

Though Nathan had long known Sebastian was Theodore's younger brother, their paths seldom crossed. Sebastian had studied abroad during the years Theodore served with Nathan in the military.

Vanessa paled. If Evelyn discovered her relationship with Nathan stemmed solely from being Theodore's ex-girlfriend—not the passionate affair she'd led everyone to believe—she'd become an even greater laughingstock.

Her panicked gaze darted to Nathan, who'd already formulated a response upon seeing Evelyn.

Addressing Sebastian with measured calm, Nathan explained, "I served with Theodore. Vanessa was his girlfriend. Before he died, he entrusted her care to me." Though speaking to Sebastian, his words were meant for Evelyn.

This was the truth behind his protection of Vanessa—no infidelity, no hidden affections. In all his life, only Evelyn had ever been his wife.

Yet Evelyn's indifferent reaction stunned him. She showed neither interest in their relationship nor reaction to his explanation. Nathan's jaw tightened as he maintained eye contact.

Vanessa squirmed under the awkward silence.

So this was the secret, Evelyn realized. She'd always wondered what mediocre qualities made Vanessa special enough to captivate Nathan. Among his admirers, Vanessa's pedigree, education, and looks ranked lowest. Beyond her vile nature, she offered nothing remarkable.

How absurd that Evelyn had lost to such a woman.

The tense quiet stretched until Sebastian's incredulous outburst shattered it. "My brother would never fancy someone like her! She's just a gold-digging opportunist, isn't she?"
###Chapter 142

Vanessa Holloway's face drained of color when she heard Sebastian Hart's accusation.

Her fingers curled into tight fists as she met Evelyn Sinclair's mocking gaze. Without uttering a word, Vanessa turned and fled the scene.

Evelyn paused for a dramatic beat before leisurely following her prey.

Nathan Blackwood frowned and moved to intervene, but Sebastian blocked his path, demanding clarification about Nathan's earlier statement.

Vanessa had just reached her cherry-red BMW when she heard approaching footsteps. She whirled around to see Evelyn standing there with an infuriatingly calm expression.

"What do you want?" Vanessa spat. "Come to gloat? Even if Nathan hurt you for my sake, it proves he doesn't care about you at all. Stop embarrassing yourself."

She still believed herself superior to Evelyn in every way.

Slamming the car door, Vanessa started the engine with a roar and pulled away from the curb.

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial as she slid into her own vehicle. The tires screeched as she accelerated after Vanessa's disappearing car.

The wide boulevard stretched empty before them.

A dangerous glint appeared in Evelyn's eyes as she pulled alongside Vanessa's car. With precise timing, she jerked the steering wheel sharply to the right.

CRASH!

The sickening sound of metal grinding against metal filled the air.

Vanessa's BMW spun violently, the left front fender crumpling like paper. The car came to a shuddering halt as Vanessa stared through the cracked windshield in shock.

Evelyn wasn't finished.

With practiced ease, she executed a perfect 180-degree turn, tires smoking as she drifted to face Vanessa's damaged vehicle head-on.

Through the haze of dust, Evelyn saw Vanessa fumbling for her phone with shaking hands.

Evelyn smirked. "Whoever you're calling won't get here in time."

She floored the accelerator again, ramming directly into Vanessa's car with bone-jarring force.

The collision sent Vanessa's BMW skidding sideways, the frame twisting grotesquely as the acrid smell of gasoline filled the air.

Finally satisfied, Evelyn reversed, parked neatly, and stepped out to lean casually against her hood. She crossed her arms, studying her handiwork with cold detachment.

Vanessa crawled from the wreckage, blood streaking her designer clothes, her entire body trembling with shock and pain.

"How does it feel?" Evelyn asked, her voice dripping with icy amusement.

Vanessa's earlier arrogance had completely evaporated. "Evelyn... if you want Nathan, just take him..." she stammered.

Evelyn pushed off from her car and sauntered forward, her designer heels clicking ominously against the pavement. She looked down at the cowering woman with undisguised contempt.

"Him? Please. A man like that isn't even worth my time anymore." Her laugh was sharp as broken glass. "No, Vanessa. I came for you."

Evelyn crouched down until they were eye to eye. "Don't even think about fleeing the country. I have an excellent memory for grudges, and we still have unfinished business." Her voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "Like when you tried to kill me by sabotaging my brakes."

Vanessa's face turned ashen. She clawed at the pavement in panic, her manicured nails snapping and bleeding. "I don't know what you're talking about! You're insane!"

Evelyn's stunning galaxy-like eyes showed no emotion as she studied Vanessa's pathetic state. That near-death experience had haunted her nightmares for months. She'd nearly lost everything - her family, her future.

Evelyn Sinclair didn't believe in forgiveness. Only consequences.

"Evelyn." A familiar cold voice cut through the tension. "What the hell are you doing?"
###Chapter 143

Nathan Blackwood's breath hitched in his throat.

His hands trembled slightly as he took in the devastating scene before him.

The elegant Evelyn Sinclair he knew would never be capable of such destruction.

Who did this to her? His mind screamed.

Deep down, he already knew the answer, but refused to accept that his refined ex-wife could harbor such fury.

"Mr. Blackwood, are you blind? Or just choosing not to see the truth?"

Evelyn didn't bother explaining. She turned sharply on her heel, ready to leave.

She had nothing left to say to this man.

Nathan moved swiftly, blocking her path with his imposing frame. His stormy gaze bore into hers.

"I already told you there's nothing between Vanessa Holloway and me."

He assumed Evelyn's rage stemmed from jealousy over his connection with Vanessa.

The thought inexplicably pleased him, despite the violent display.

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile.

Her eyes glittered with icy amusement as she regarded him with detached indifference.

"You actually think I did this because of you?"

Nathan's brow furrowed, his intense stare never wavering.

"Then why?"

Evelyn arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow, giving him a scathing once-over.

"Mr. Blackwood, your ego knows no bounds. I suggest you see a specialist about that narcissism."

Nathan's expression darkened with confusion.

Without another word, Evelyn yanked open her car door and slid inside.

The engine roared to life. She rolled down the window just enough to toss a thick folder at Nathan's feet.

Then she was gone, tires screeching against pavement.

What a perfect match - the narcissist and the two-faced witch, she thought bitterly.

Nathan knelt stiffly to retrieve the documents. The moment he opened the file, his entire body went rigid.

The air around him turned arctic.

Photographic evidence showed Vanessa conspiring with a lanky man near Evelyn's vehicle.

That night. That car. That accident.

The memories flashed behind Nathan's eyelids with painful clarity.

No further explanation was needed.

The file contained irrefutable proof of Vanessa Holloway's attempted murder.

So Evelyn's violent retaliation wasn't about jealousy - it was justice. Vanessa got exactly what she deserved, Nathan realized.

A lead weight settled in his chest, making it hard to breathe.

This wasn't about him at all. Evelyn had nearly died that night.

If he hadn't intervened...

A weak tug at his pant leg interrupted his thoughts. "It... wasn't me... help..."

Vanessa lay broken on the pavement, her pathetic whimpers barely coherent.

For the first time, genuine terror shone in her eyes.

She never expected Evelyn to uncover the truth so quickly.

Nor did she anticipate such brutal retaliation.

Nathan's glacial stare dropped to the whimpering woman. Still playing the victim?

How had he been so thoroughly deceived?

Evelyn's words echoed in his mind - Vanessa was a cat with nine lives who never seemed to die.

The realization struck him like a physical blow.

From their marriage onward, Vanessa had deliberately drained Evelyn's blood during medical procedures.

The car accident was just another calculated move.

Vanessa Holloway was a viper in silk, and he'd been her unwitting accomplice.

Sebastian Hart descended the hillside with deliberate slowness.

"Quite the show, Mr. Blackwood," he drawled. "Though I must say, even if my brother were alive, he'd never stoop to marry such trash. She's all yours - just do us all a favor and keep her locked away."

Sebastian's mocking laughter hung in the air as he walked away.

Nathan's grip on the evidence file turned his knuckles white. He stepped back, avoiding Vanessa's grasping fingers.

Disgust twisted his features.

"Nathan... please..." Vanessa sobbed.

"Get out of my sight." The words came out like shards of ice. His eyes promised retribution.
###Chapter 144

The deserted boulevard stretched endlessly before her.

Nathan Blackwood didn't so much as glance at Vanessa Holloway lying crumpled on the pavement. He simply slid into his sleek black car and disappeared down the street.

Vanessa was left discarded like yesterday's garbage, her injuries ignored by every passing stranger.

With trembling hands, she pulled herself up and dialed her uncle. The moment he answered, his furious voice exploded through the phone.

"You wretched fool! What did you do to enrage Mr. Blackwood? He's threatening to destroy my entire company! Explain yourself!"

Vanessa's breath caught in her throat when sudden car horns interrupted her panic.

Was Nathan sending someone back for her? Had he reconsidered?

Her fleeting hope shattered as police vehicles screeched to a halt before her.

"Vanessa Holloway?" An officer stepped forward, his expression stern. "You're under arrest for attempted murder."

Ice flooded her veins.

The brief flicker of optimism vanished as reality crashed down. The police - not Nathan - had come for her.

Cold metal cuffs snapped around her wrists before she was shoved into the squad car. The wailing sirens echoed her internal scream of despair.

At Sterling Corporation...

Evelyn Sinclair reviewed the final details of Kingsley Tech's project. With Donovan Sterling overseeing the technical aspects, her mind could focus on more pressing matters.

The weight of her new CEO position showed in the stack of bid proposals demanding her attention.

"President Sinclair?" Bennett approached as she exited the conference room. "Sebastian Hart called twice. It sounded urgent."

Evelyn accepted her phone with a nod. Sebastian answered on the first ring.

"Evelyn! Have you seen the news? Vanessa Holloway's been arrested!"

Evelyn's perfectly arched brows lifted. "I've been in meetings all morning. What happened?"

"Nathan Blackwood personally handed your evidence to the police! Vanessa confessed everything overnight!"

A sardonic smile curved Evelyn's lips. "How... unexpected. I assumed his affection for her ran deeper."

Sebastian's laugh held no warmth. "That snake charmed my father Theodore in three days flat. She manipulated everyone into believing he loved her. When I told Nathan the truth, you should've seen his face!"

Evelyn's chest tightened unexpectedly. Three days of deception versus three years of torment - the irony wasn't lost on her.

But vengeance wasn't her concern now. Vanessa would face justice for her own choices.

"How did this become public knowledge?" Evelyn wondered aloud.

"Horizon Media broke the story. Lucas is apparently enjoying the show."

Evelyn ended the call and opened her news feed. The top trending headline blared: "Blackwood's Mistress Exposed as Murderer!"

Every damning detail had been leaked - photographs, confessions, the entire sordid timeline laid bare for public consumption.
###Chapter 145

The comment section beneath the viral article exploded with outrage.

"This mistress is a complete psychopath!"

"That homewrecker tried to murder his ex-wife? What kind of monster is she? Who does she think she is?"

"Mr. Blackwood must be blind! This cheap mistress isn't fit to lick Evelyn's boots! His taste in women is truly appalling."

"Blackwood Enterprises' stock took quite a hit, didn't it?"

The next trending topic featured Lucas Sterling enjoying the drama unfold online.

Using his verified account, Lucas reposted Horizon Media's explosive report.

His caption read: "Karma's a bitch! @EvelynSinclair I know you're too classy for this, but let me fan the flames for you!"

"OMG is this Lucas publicly declaring his love for Evelyn?" "Let's all add fuel to the fire! Team Evelyn!"

"Everyone knows Lucas has a crush on Evelyn, but this feels so extra. Hilarious though!"

"Credit to Lucas for having good taste, but our CEO Evelyn should remain the ultimate independent queen!"

Lucas's public stance was clearly an act of protection and undisguised favoritism toward Evelyn.

This was unprecedented in celebrity culture.

Had Lucas been just another actor, his comments wouldn't have caused such a stir.

But Lucas Sterling was Hollywood royalty.

His every word carried weight.

The moment he spoke, his millions of followers rallied behind Evelyn.

Naturally, Vanessa and Nathan faced even harsher backlash.

Evelyn smirked, thinking they deserved every bit of it.

Blackwood Enterprises' stock dip, while significant, barely made a dent in the family's fortune.

Evelyn had long stopped caring about them.

Three hours later, Blackwood Enterprises issued a statement.

"Mr. Nathan Blackwood and Ms. Vanessa Holloway maintain a strictly professional relationship. Our company will pursue all legal avenues to protect Mr. Blackwood's reputation."

They attached a cease-and-desist letter.

Their efforts to control the narrative failed spectacularly.

Their PR team was embarrassingly incompetent.

When news broke about Evelyn's near-death experience, the Sterling family erupted.

William Sterling pulled strings to ensure Vanessa would serve her full sentence without parole.

Alexander Sterling ordered Evelyn to take medical leave, insisting the company could manage without her.

Donovan Sterling, relieved his sister was alive, remained characteristically quiet.

Lucas Sterling unleashed a torrent of profanity across social media.

As evening fell, Bennett knocked on Evelyn's office door.

"President Sinclair, Ms. Blackwood is here to see you."

Evelyn paused. "Sophia Blackwood?" Bennett nodded.

"What does she want now? Didn't she learn her lesson last time?" Evelyn's lips curled into a dangerous smile.

She leaned back in her leather chair, arching one perfect eyebrow. "Send her in."

"Yes, ma'am."

Moments later, Sophia strutted in on stiletto heels.

Her haggard appearance suggested she hadn't been sleeping well.

Given Old Master Blackwood's temperament, family loyalty meant nothing when business interests were at stake.

Sophia still hadn't learned this crucial lesson.

"Evelyn, you really think you're untouchable now, don't you?"

Sophia's envious gaze swept across the luxurious office.

Evelyn's expression remained icy. "My time is valuable, Ms. Blackwood. State your business."

She had no patience for petty games with lesser women.

Sophia's face twisted in displeasure. Who did Evelyn think she was?

But remembering her grandfather's threats, Sophia swallowed her pride.

She lifted her chin in that trademark Blackwood arrogance. "I came to apologize."

As if Evelyn should feel honored. When had a Blackwood ever apologized to anyone?

If not for Evelyn's counterattack damaging their company, Old Master Blackwood would never have forced this humiliation.

Evelyn studied Sophia and burst into laughter.

Sophia looked ready for war, not reconciliation. Did she think Evelyn was stupid?

"What's so funny? Stop gloating! I wouldn't be here if Grandpa hadn't ordered—"

Evelyn's smile vanished. "Nobody forced you. If you're unhappy, the door's right there."
###Chapter 146

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk. Did Sophia truly believe she could be fooled so easily? As if a half-hearted apology from her would mean anything?

She wouldn’t care even if Sophia groveled at her feet.

Sophia froze, her expression twisting in shock.

For a moment, she faltered, her confidence shattering under Evelyn’s icy gaze.

It hit her then—Evelyn wasn’t the same woman she had once bullied.

She was now the formidable CEO of Sterling Corporation, a woman who could bring even Blackwood Enterprises to its knees.

"Evelyn, what kind of attitude is this?" Sophia gritted her teeth, forcing out the words. "I came here to apologize, and this is how you treat me?"

Evelyn glanced at her watch, then pressed the intercom. "Bennett, send security up. Escort Ms. Blackwood out."

Sophia’s eyes widened in disbelief.

"And from now on," Evelyn added coolly, "she is not permitted to enter Sterling Tower again."

"Evelyn! How dare you?!" Sophia’s face flushed with rage. If word got out that she had been publicly thrown out, her reputation would be ruined. Grandfather and Nathan would never believe she hadn’t provoked Evelyn first.

Evelyn’s gaze was glacial.

"Why wouldn’t I? Sophia Blackwood, you should learn what a real apology looks like."

The security team arrived swiftly. Bennett stepped in, his expression stern. "Ms. Blackwood, this way."

Fury burned in Sophia’s chest. She shot Evelyn one last venomous glare before storming out.

The moment she stepped outside Sterling Tower, regret clawed at her. How was she going to explain this to Grandfather and Nathan? She should have just swallowed her pride.

Her anxiety only grew as she returned to Blackwood Manor.

The second she entered, a teacup flew toward her. Sophia barely dodged it, the porcelain shattering at her feet.

"Grandfather—"

"You useless girl!" Old Master Blackwood’s voice was thunderous. "How dare you come back after humiliating yourself like that?"

Sophia opened her mouth to lie, but—

"Evelyn Sinclair called me," he snapped. "She told me you were arrogant and disrespectful the moment you stepped into her office. Are you truly this stupid?"

Sophia’s face paled.

She hadn’t expected Evelyn to strike first, poisoning Grandfather against her before she could even speak.

Now, nothing she said would matter.

Of course, Evelyn had outmaneuvered her again.

Her punishment? Another night kneeling in the ancestral hall.

After work, Isabella practically dragged Evelyn to an exclusive party.

Though exhausted, Evelyn hadn’t indulged in a night out in ages, so she reluctantly agreed.

She wore an emerald-green halter gown, the fabric woven with delicate pearls that shimmered under the light. The dress clung to her curves, accentuating her graceful neck and regal posture.

She looked every bit the untouchable goddess.

The moment the two women entered, heads turned.

Isabella leaned in, mischief in her voice. "See anyone you like? Just take him home."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "You’re the one who looks interested."

Isabella grinned. "Well, it’s about participation, isn’t it?" She winked. "I’ll go greet the host. Find a seat."

Evelyn nodded and settled into a quiet corner.

She pulled out her phone to check stock updates when a man dripping in designer labels swaggered toward her. His gaze was predatory, his outfit screaming "trust fund brat."

One glance told Evelyn everything—arrogant, entitled, and utterly useless.

"Ms. Sterling," he drawled, flashing a smarmy smile. "I’ve heard so much about you. You’re even more stunning in person."

Evelyn barely spared him a glance, offering only a curt nod.

She didn’t know him. She didn’t care to.

And his attempt at flattery was painfully unoriginal.

His smile faltered at her indifference. He had come here hoping to impress Nathan Blackwood, who was upstairs with his friends, brooding over Sterling Corporation’s recent victories.

Seeing Nathan’s dark mood, this fool thought he could win favor by putting Evelyn in her place.

Maybe if he succeeded, Nathan would even consider a business deal with his family.

The thought emboldened him.

He leered at Evelyn. "Let me buy you a drink, Ms. Sterling."

He held out a glass of champagne.

Evelyn didn’t even look at it.

"I don’t drink," she said flatly.

Her refusal was absolute. She wouldn’t accept anything from a man like him.

His face darkened. He forced a laugh. "A powerful woman like you, refusing a drink? Are you looking down on me?"

Evelyn finally met his eyes, her gaze sharp enough to cut glass.

"Yes."
###Chapter 147: A Lesson in Humility

The entitled brat smirked, his voice dripping with condescension as he insinuated that Evelyn Sinclair's strong demeanor was nothing but an act.

Beneath that powerful CEO facade, she was just a fragile woman.

What did a divorced heiress have to be proud of, anyway?

Evelyn's expression remained icy. A mocking smile curled at the corner of her lips.

Her voice was sharp enough to cut glass. "Yes, I am looking down on you."

Under the chandelier's glow, Evelyn radiated effortless elegance.

She didn’t need words—just one dismissive glance shattered his fragile ego.

Who does this pathetic man think he is? He’s not even worth my breath.

Done with the conversation, Evelyn rose, intending to find Isabella.

The scene had already drawn curious gazes from the surrounding crowd.

Humiliated by her indifference, the spoiled heir's face burned with rage. He lunged forward, grabbing her wrist.

"Evelyn, you think you’re so untouchable? You’re just a woman Nathan Blackwood tossed aside! What makes you think you’re worth anything now? You should be grateful anyone even looks your way. Name your price—how much for a drink?"

Before he could finish, red wine splashed across his face.

Evelyn moved so fast he barely registered the empty glass in her hand.

Dark liquid dripped from his hair, staining his designer shirt.

She rubbed her wrist, her glare glacial.

"It’s the twenty-first century. Since your mouth is so filthy, consider that a free rinse. And you?" She scoffed, eyeing his flashy outfit. "You couldn’t afford me."

While he sputtered, Evelyn stood tall—regal, untouchable.

The contrast was stark: a furious, spoiled brat versus a queen who wouldn’t spare him a second glance.

His pride shattered. The whispers around them fueled his fury.

No one had ever dared humiliate him like this.

How dare this discarded woman act so superior?

"I’ll teach you your place, you—"

His hand swung toward her face.

But before it connected, a tall figure intercepted, yanking Evelyn back.

A brutal kick sent the man crashing to the floor, writhing in pain.

The hand gripping Evelyn’s wrist was elegant, long-fingered—artistic, even.

A familiar scent, laced with whiskey, enveloped her.

Once, that scent had made her heart race. Now, it made her recoil.

Nathan Blackwood.

He loomed over her, his presence suffocating. The moment Evelyn recognized him, she jerked free, putting distance between them.

His brows furrowed briefly—something flickered in his eyes—but it vanished just as quickly.

Tristan Whitmore rushed over, gaping at the scene.

"Anson, have you lost your damn mind?"

Anson’s family was small-time in San Francisco.

Did he really just try to lay hands on Evelyn Sinclair?
###Chapter 148

The crowd gasped in shock.

Rumors had been swirling for months about the bitter feud between Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair.

So why did this ex-husband suddenly leap to her defense when danger struck?

Isabella Montgomery came rushing through the crowd, her face pale with worry. She grabbed Evelyn's arms. "Are you hurt?"

Evelyn merely shook her head, her expression calm as still water.

She had been ready for this.

With her martial arts training, that spoiled rich boy wouldn't have stood a chance against her.

Nathan's intervention had been... unexpected.

The trust fund brat groaned on the ground, clutching his stomach. Though in agony, he forced himself to sit up.

Still dazed, he hadn't realized who had kicked him.

"Who the hell dares interfere with me?" he spat through gritted teeth. "Defending Evelyn Sinclair? You must have a death wish!"

Tristan Whitmore burst out laughing.

"Open your damn eyes, Anson! Unless you want to spend the rest of your life in a hospital bed?"

Normally, Anson would cower before Tristan and Nathan. But pain had made him reckless.

Then he heard Tristan's voice clearly.

His blood ran cold.

Scrambling to his knees, he looked up into Nathan's icy gaze.

Nathan stared down at him like he was something unpleasant stuck to his shoe.

"M-Mr. Blackwood!" Anson stammered. "What are you doing here?"

This made no sense! Everyone knew Nathan despised Evelyn. Why would he protect her?

Anson's mind raced as he tried to save face.

"It's all a misunderstanding, sir! I was just teaching this woman a lesson. She's been spreading vile rumors about you online! As your loyal friend, I couldn't stand by and—"

Nathan's foot connected with Anson's chest again, cutting off his pathetic excuses.

Tristan quickly moved to Evelyn's side, putting distance between Nathan and this mess.

"We don't know this idiot," Tristan said hurriedly. "Nathan has nothing to do with him. Please don't misunderstand, Evelyn."

Tristan knew better than anyone how complicated Nathan's feelings for Evelyn had become.

Ever since Nathan turned Vanessa Holloway over to the police, Tristan had seen the truth.

Nathan was hopelessly in love with his ex-wife.

Even if Nathan himself hadn't realized it yet.

So Tristan would be damned if he let some third-rate social climber ruin things.

Evelyn's lips curled into a frosty smile.

"Save your explanations. This isn't the first time Mr. Blackwood's so-called friends have come after me." Her cold eyes flicked to Tristan. "You were one of them, weren't you?"

Tristan winced. He had no defense.

During Nathan and Evelyn's forced marriage, Tristan had made Evelyn's life miserable.

He was no better than Anson.

Evelyn's words cut deep.

Tristan glanced nervously at Nathan, who stood rigid, fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white.

Nathan was furious.

Anson writhed on the ground, his face gray with pain.

"Mr. Blackwood, I only wanted to protect your reputation! Had I known you still cared for this woman, I never would have—"

"Shut your filthy mouth!" Tristan roared. "Since when do you speak for Nathan? Do you want to be banned from every club in San Francisco?"
###Chapter 149

Evelyn Sinclair smirked from the sidelines, thinking what an absolutely spectacular show this had turned out to be.

Though truth be told, she'd had enough of this ridiculous performance.

Every additional second spent watching these fools was a complete waste of her precious time.

She turned to Isabella with a dismissive wave. "Let's get out of here. Being around these insufferable idiots is ruining my evening."

The only person she wanted to avoid more than anyone else was Nathan Blackwood.

Isabella immediately understood Evelyn's unspoken thoughts. She'd been regretting bringing Evelyn here in the first place, so she nodded eagerly in agreement.

Evelyn grabbed her designer clutch, pivoted sharply on her stilettos, and strode confidently toward the exit without a backward glance.

She couldn't care less about the dozens of curious eyes following her dramatic departure.

Let them keep watching Nathan's pathetic little show, she thought bitterly.

While Isabella went to retrieve the car, Evelyn waited by the entrance, absently studying her manicure as the cool night breeze brushed against her skin.

Then came the unmistakable sound of heavy footsteps approaching - ones she'd recognize anywhere - but she refused to turn around.

"Evelyn." That deep, velvety voice she knew all too well. "Vanessa Holloway has been dealt with. I was wondering if... perhaps we could start over?"

Nathan moved to stand beside her, his gaze complicated as he studied her profile.

This marked the first time in Nathan Blackwood's life he'd ever initiated friendship with a woman - a fact that would shock high society if it ever got out.

Guilt and remorse weighed heavily on him, and he desperately wanted Evelyn to give him just one chance to make things right.

With Vanessa out of the picture and their misunderstandings cleared, Nathan felt even more ashamed of how he'd treated Evelyn now that he saw Vanessa's true colors.

Evelyn finally lifted her eyes to give him a sideways glance, one perfectly sculpted eyebrow arching in derision. "I have exceptionally high standards when it comes to friendships, Mr. Blackwood. You don't even come close to meeting them, so let's not waste each other's time."

Nathan's entire body went rigid.

The rejection in her words couldn't have been clearer.

Friendship? Evelyn wouldn't even acknowledge him if they passed on the street.

"Don't tell me you actually believe my hatred for you stems solely from Vanessa Holloway?" Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "That without her in the picture, I'd suddenly forgive and forget everything?"

Nathan's expression hardened, his face growing increasingly stormy as he struggled to contain the uncomfortable tightness in his chest.

"What exactly do you mean by that?" His voice came out icy and strained.

Wasn't that the case? He'd already explained he had nothing to do with Vanessa. Why was he still worthless in Evelyn's eyes? Was there truly no chance for reconciliation between them?

Evelyn's eyebrow arched higher, her smile turning positively glacial.

How utterly ironic.

"To be perfectly honest, I find you utterly repulsive. While we were married, you didn't hesitate to sacrifice your own wife's happiness for some other woman's benefit. How does someone even do that? Was it just to prove your moral superiority?" Her voice dripped with disdain. "Don't insult me by talking about friendship. Why should I care? I was the one who donated blood. I was the one slandered and humiliated. I was the one who wasted three years of my life! Why should I bear the consequences of your actions? Doesn't that disgust you? This was never about Vanessa Holloway - it's always been about you, Nathan Blackwood!"

By the time she finished speaking, all traces of amusement had vanished from Evelyn's face, replaced by an arctic chill in her piercing gaze.

Nathan Blackwood had single-handedly destroyed every ounce of affection she'd ever felt for him.

Did he really expect her to feel grateful and come running back just because he claimed innocence regarding Vanessa? In his dreams!

Without so much as another glance in his direction, Evelyn turned and walked away, her heels clicking decisively against the pavement.

Nathan stood frozen in place, the bone-deep coldness radiating from Evelyn seeping into his very soul.

Am I truly so unworthy to even speak to her? The thought cut deeper than he cared to admit.

For the first time, Nathan realized Evelyn had completely slipped from his control - perhaps even beyond his reach entirely.

This unsettling realization sent an unexpected pang of panic through him.

Isabella's luxury sedan idled nearby, waiting for Evelyn.

As she slid into the passenger seat and buckled her seatbelt with mechanical precision, her face remained an impassive mask.

Isabella spotted Nathan still standing there and snorted derisively. "What does he want now?"

Evelyn's lips twisted wryly. "He wants to be friends."

A harsh laugh escaped Isabella. "Is he delusional? After everything?"

"Obviously." Evelyn's tone dripped with sarcasm as she watched Nathan's retreating figure grow smaller in the side mirror, suddenly feeling the entire encounter had been utterly pointless.

The moment Evelyn arrived home, she immediately called Bennett.

Her voice held an uncharacteristic edge as she issued her command: "There's some spoiled trust fund brat named Anson. I don't care what his family business is, but I want to wake up tomorrow to news of their complete financial ruin and disappearance from high society."

Bennett had no idea what had transpired earlier that evening, but this marked the first time Evelyn had ever used Sterling Corporation's influence to deliberately destroy another company.

"Understood, President Sinclair."

Bennett sighed internally. Looks like another all-nighter for me...
###Chapter 150

The sun had barely risen over San Francisco when Nathan Blackwood stepped out of the conference room at Blackwood Corporation.

His sharp mind, still processing the morning's discussions, suddenly snapped to a different thought. He turned to his assistant, Harrison.

"Terminate all contracts with Anson & Co. Buy them out at the lowest possible price, then make sure he leaves the city."

Harrison hesitated, confusion flickering across his face. "Sir, Anson's company collapsed overnight. They're drowning in debt and fled the country. Their assets have already been seized."

Nathan's jaw tightened, his expression turning icy.

It didn’t take him long to realize—Evelyn Sinclair had struck again.

She moves fast. The memory of her words from last night sent an uneasy ripple through him.

Suppressing the strange sensation, he merely gave a curt nod.

Meanwhile, Tristan Whitmore nearly choked on his breakfast when he heard about Anson’s downfall.

His appetite vanished instantly.

Compared to Anson, Tristan realized Evelyn had been merciful with him.

If she ever decided to settle old scores, not even Nathan could shield him.

Panic set in. He grabbed his coat and rushed straight to Sterling Corporation.

Evelyn barely spared a glance when Bennett informed her of Tristan’s arrival.

"Let him wait. Proceed with the scheduled meetings."

Bennett nodded. "Yes, ma'am."

Two back-to-back meetings later, Evelyn inspected a project site and grabbed a quick lunch in the employee cafeteria.

Her schedule was relentless.

Only as evening approached did she finally exhale.

Then she remembered.

"Is he still here?"

Bennett didn’t need clarification. "Mr. Whitmore is in the guest lounge. He’s had four coffees and ordered takeout."

Evelyn smirked. "Impressive patience."

"Send him in."

Moments later, Tristan entered, clutching a bouquet of wilted flowers.

Evelyn arched a brow.

Tristan flashed his most charming smile. "Evelyn! You’re done already?"

He’d expected to wait until midnight.

Crossing her arms, she tilted her head. "Apologies for the delay, Mr. Whitmore."

Her tone held no remorse.

Tristan laughed nervously. "No, no—my time is worthless."

I’ll endure anything if it means she doesn’t destroy me next.

Evelyn sipped her coffee, the rich aroma filling the room.

Tristan nearly gagged—he’d already had enough caffeine to last a week.

Breathe through it.

Straightening, he chose his words carefully.

"After yesterday… I realized how poorly I treated you back then. As Nathan’s friend, I should’ve known better."

He exhaled. "I came to apologize properly."

Evelyn studied him, unimpressed.

"Or did Anson’s fate scare you into this?"

Damn, she sees right through me.

His smile faltered before he forced it back. "Vanessa Holloway played us all! Last night, we were drinking with Nathan, reminiscing… and we regret everything. We were blind. Can we start over?"

The once-arrogant heir now stood before her, practically groveling.

Evelyn’s lips curved.

How the mighty have fallen.
###Chapter 151 A Death Wish?

Evelyn's eyes flashed with amusement before she shook her head with a smirk.

Not in this lifetime! Turn the page? Keep dreaming! These people get more ridiculous by the day.

Tristan's hopeful smile faltered. His entire visit had been nothing but a fool's errand.

He left the office dejected while Evelyn's icy voice followed him out. "Mr. Whitmore, you should be grateful I'm not actively pursuing grievances against your people."

"Next time, spare yourself the humiliation."

Tristan froze mid-step.

A sudden realization struck him. He turned back with renewed hope shining in his eyes. "Evelyn, do you still have feelings for Nathan?" If she did, their chances now were infinitely better than three years ago! They were equals now - a perfect match!

Evelyn's expression turned glacial. "Do you have a death wish?" The threat couldn't be clearer.

Tristan instinctively recoiled, forcing an awkward laugh before practically sprinting from the room. That answered that.

How could she possibly still care for Nathan? She wasn't some masochist.

Once safely outside Sterling Tower, Tristan immediately called Nathan. "Blackwood, I never realized how perfectly matched you and Evelyn are. Your temperaments, your presence, your family backgrounds - it's uncanny! Honestly, who else could possibly stand beside you as an equal?"

Nathan's voice held cautious interest. "Oh?"

Though he'd never admit it, the comparison secretly pleased him.

Tristan sighed dramatically. "Too bad you've completely blown your chance!" The line went dead immediately, followed by Nathan's muttered curse: "That idiot."

Meanwhile, Evelyn received an invitation from Lucas to attend an exclusive auction that evening.

Concerned about public speculation regarding their relationship, Lucas had invited Natalie Beaumont as his date.

For Evelyn, he'd carefully selected rising star Julian Moreau as her escort.

The young actor cut a striking figure in his tailored white suit, his boyish charm evident in the faint blush that colored his cheeks when introduced to Evelyn.

Evelyn simply offered a polite smile before taking his arm and guiding him into the opulent venue.

The massive display screen showcased tonight's offerings: rare jade artifacts, masterwork paintings, and the pièce de résistance - a pair of black opal cufflinks, the final creation of legendary designer Laurent Dubois.

Julian's breath caught when the cufflinks appeared. "Laurent's last piece is here?" he whispered reverently.

"You admire them?" Evelyn asked.

Julian nodded enthusiastically. "Before acting, I studied design. Laurent was my idol. I'd give up my career in a heartbeat if he'd take me as his apprentice."

The mention of cufflinks triggered an unwelcome memory - Nathan Blackwood's well-known obsession with collecting them, particularly Dubois' creations.

Damn it! Why does everything remind me of him? Evelyn scanned the room irritably - only to find Nathan seated mere rows away, enduring the chatter of an overly familiar brunette.

Sensing her gaze, Nathan turned - his eyes locking onto Evelyn's intimate conversation with Julian.

The way her delicate features softened when she smiled, the adorable dimples that appeared... She looked radiant when not directing her fury at him.

They seemed entirely too close for comfort.

A dark scowl settled over Nathan's features.

The woman beside him followed his glare and deliberately raised her voice. "Oh! Looks like Ms. Sterling has a new beau. She certainly has excellent taste - Julian Moreau is this season's breakout star! The Sterling heiress certainly attracts handsome men."

Nathan cut her off with a glare. "This isn't your seat."

Cassandra Delacroix stiffened before recovering with a practiced smile. "My father organized this auction. People are happy to accommodate me." Her implication was clear - she sat wherever she pleased.
###Chapter 152 Only You Are Worthy

Cassandra Delacroix had just returned to Montecito and decided to attend the auction for some entertainment.

She never expected to see Nathan Blackwood here. The moment she spotted him, everything else faded into the background—she had to get closer.

Three years ago, Evelyn Sinclair had stolen her chance with Nathan. Now, Cassandra refused to back down.

Nathan remained silent.

His expression was icy, the disdain in his gaze unmistakable. If Harrison, seated beside him, failed to recognize his boss’s displeasure, then all those years as Nathan’s right-hand man would have been wasted.

Harrison quickly suggested, "President Blackwood, perhaps we should switch seats?"

Nathan stood without a word, and Harrison swiftly moved aside, taking his original spot.

Cassandra’s furious glare burned into Harrison, but he pretended not to notice.

Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Natalie Beaumont.

[Is that Cassandra Delacroix from Celestial Media sitting next to Nathan?]

Evelyn frowned slightly at the name before replying.

[Couldn’t tell.]

It took her a moment to recall who Cassandra was—the infamous socialite who had once declared she would marry no one but Nathan Blackwood.

Her father, Vincent Delacroix, was a powerhouse in the entertainment industry, and Cassandra had always gotten whatever she wanted.

After Nathan rejected her, she had been devastated and fled to Korea for cosmetic surgery. But while she was away, Nathan married Evelyn.

Now, freshly returned from her transformation, Cassandra sat just a few seats from Nathan, her bright eyes fixed on him.

Evelyn’s cold gaze flickered toward them.

Nathan turned his head, catching sight of Evelyn speaking softly with Julian Moreau.

Her profile was delicate, her smile revealing charming dimples. She looks radiant when she’s not angry.

But the sight of her so close to Julian sent a sharp irritation through him. His expression darkened.

The woman beside him—Cassandra—noticed his shift and followed his gaze.

"Oh!" she exclaimed dramatically. "Looks like Ms. Sinclair has a new admirer. Julian Moreau, isn’t it? His debut drama was a massive hit. She certainly knows how to pick them."

Nathan’s voice was icy. "This isn’t your seat."

Cassandra stiffened, then forced a smile. "My father organized this auction. People are happy to accommodate me."

She meant she could sit wherever she pleased.

But Nathan wasn’t interested.

The auction began, and Evelyn found herself fixated on a single item—a pair of cufflinks.

When bidding started at $200,000, Julian raised his paddle without hesitation.

"$250,000!"

The price climbed rapidly to $600,000. Julian hesitated—this was a steep sum for a rising actor.

Evelyn decided to step in. Since he had accompanied her, she would show her appreciation.

"$700,000," she called.

The previous bidder, recognizing her, backed down.

But then Cassandra raised her paddle.

"$750,000!" She turned to Nathan, beaming. "Nathan, let me gift these to you!"

Nathan gave no reaction.

Evelyn’s lips curved. Does she really think she can outbid me?

"One million," Evelyn declared.

Gasps filled the room. These were now the most expensive cufflinks in auction history.

Cassandra’s face fell—she didn’t have that kind of spending money. Her resentment toward Evelyn flared.

Just as the auctioneer prepared to finalize Evelyn’s bid, a deep voice cut through the room.

"$1.1 million."

Nathan.

The cufflinks weren’t worth that much, but they were the last missing piece in his Laurent Dubois collection. He needed them.

The crowd buzzed—ex-wife versus ex-husband. Who would win?

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "$1.2 million."

Julian leaned in. "Ms. Sinclair, they’re not worth that much."

She smiled but didn’t respond.

Nathan countered immediately. "$1.5 million."

His gaze flicked toward Evelyn, but she wasn’t looking at him—her focus was entirely on the cufflinks, an almost obsessive desire in her eyes.

Without pause, she raised her paddle again.

"Two million."

The auctioneer’s voice rang out. "Two million, going once! Two million, going twice—"

He deliberately dragged out the pause, waiting to see if Nathan would bid again.
###Chapter 153 A Change of Attire

The auction hall fell into stunned silence. To everyone's astonishment, Nathan Blackwood subtly averted his gaze and ceased his bidding.

If she desires it that badly, let her have it. Nathan mused silently. The auctioneer's gavel struck decisively. "Sold for two million dollars!"

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Had the formidable Mr. Blackwood actually conceded? The anticipated showdown had ended far too abruptly.

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curled in a cold smirk. This piece isn't worth nearly that much. Nathan deliberately inflated the price just to make me overspend.

She rose gracefully, Julian Moreau shadowing her steps as they moved to complete the transaction. Neither noticed the dark figure observing them from the shadows.

Presenting the exquisite cufflinks to Julian, Evelyn smiled. "These are for you."

Julian's eyes widened comically. "For me? But these cost two million!" His voice cracked slightly.

Evelyn nodded. "Consider it thanks for accompanying me tonight." She tilted her head. "Unless you'd prefer to regift them?"

Before Julian could respond, the sound of heavy footsteps storming away echoed through the corridor. Neither paid it any mind.

Natalie Beaumont entered with Lucas Sterling in tow. "I just saw Nathan leaving like a thundercloud," Natalie remarked with raised eyebrows. "Trouble in paradise?"

Julian shook his head blankly. "No one came in here..."

Evelyn recalled the retreating footsteps and understood instantly - though she couldn't care less. Natalie linked arms with her. "Let's grab dinner. I'm starving."

As they walked, Natalie marveled, "I can't believe Nathan actually backed down for you."

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "Backed down? He was driving up the price out of spite!"

Across the room, Cassandra Delacroix held court amidst a flock of sycophantic starlets. As the daughter of Celestial Media's CEO, she commanded both fear and flattery.

Spotting Evelyn, Cassandra's perfectly contoured face twisted with malice. "Ms. Sinclair," she purred, "how generous of you to shower gifts on your...companions." Her gaze flicked dismissively to Julian. "Do share your secret - how do you keep finding new men to parade about?"

The surrounding actresses tittered nervously, careful not to actually join in. Everyone knew better than to cross Evelyn Sinclair.

Evelyn's responding smile could have frozen hell over. She didn't need to move - her mere presence dimmed the beauty of every starlet present.

"Darling," Evelyn drawled, examining Cassandra through half-lidded eyes, "some of us are simply born with it. Though I suppose no amount of surgery could give you what I have."

Cassandra's face flushed crimson. The barb about her obvious cosmetic enhancements struck true. "You think your family name protects you?" she spat. "Nathan only married you because you were marginally fuckable!"

The air turned arctic. Natalie stepped forward, but Evelyn was faster.

"Funny," Evelyn mused, "I recall you getting rejected by him right before your third nose job. Coincidence?" She tapped a finger against her lips mockingly.

Cassandra's surgically enlarged eyes bulged dangerously. With a shriek, she grabbed the nearest cocktail and hurled it at Evelyn.

Evelyn yanked Natalie aside with lightning reflexes. The glass shattered harmlessly against the wall.

But the damage was done.

Harrison rushed forward in alarm. "Sir! Your suit!" He gestured frantically at Nathan's champagne-soaked attire. "Shall I arrange for a change of clothes?"
###Chapter 154

Nathan Blackwood's jaw clenched when he heard Evelyn Sinclair's earlier remark—that only Julian Moreau was worthy of those cufflinks. Without a word, he turned on his heel and stormed off.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor.

Because now, as he strode through the crowd, he found Evelyn at the center of yet another commotion.

And then—splash.

A glass of juice hit him square in the chest.

Collateral damage.

Every eye in the room flicked to Cassandra Delacroix, the culprit, with expressions that screamed, You’re dead.

Cassandra froze, her lips trembling. "N-Nathan… are you okay?"

His gaze was glacial. "We’re not acquainted. Address me as Mr. Blackwood."

With that, he spared Evelyn—who looked utterly indifferent—one last glance before walking away.

No one had ever made Nathan Blackwood look this undignified.

Harrison, his assistant, scrambled after him.

Just moments ago, Cassandra had been boasting about her close relationship with Nathan, even hinting at a future marriage alliance between their families.

Now?

Publicly humiliated.

Not acquainted.

The words were a slap.

Cassandra’s fingers tightened around the empty glass, her nails digging into her palm. She glared at Evelyn, resentment burning in her eyes.

Natalie Beaumont, ever the instigator, smirked. "Maybe he just forgot your name. Did you even introduce yourself properly?"

Evelyn stifled a laugh and tugged Natalie away before things escalated.

The crowd quickly shifted topics, eager to avoid Cassandra’s wrath.

Dinner was about to begin.

Lucas Sterling, the biggest movie star present, lounged with effortless charm, while Julian Moreau, the rising young actor, stood nearby.

The organizers knew better than to pressure Lucas into making an appearance onstage—he did what he wanted, when he wanted.

So they turned to Julian instead.

Julian handled it smoothly, delivering his speech with practiced ease.

But the host couldn’t resist stirring the pot.

"Julian, now that you're of age, your fans are dying to know—what’s your ideal type of woman?"

Julian hesitated, then chuckled, shaking his head.

The host rephrased. "Among the ladies here tonight, is there anyone who catches your eye?"

The room held its breath.

Julian’s gaze landed on Evelyn in the crowd.

His smile was boyish, his small canine tooth peeking out. "Someone like Ms. Sinclair."

The audience erupted in cheers, all eyes darting to Evelyn for her reaction.

She laughed, shaking her head as she waved at him. Cute kid. Probably just grateful for the cufflinks.

Scandals didn’t faze her anymore.

But Julian? He might regret this later.

Two pairs of eyes burned into her from across the room—icy, unreadable.

She turned slightly and met Nathan’s dark stare.

Without hesitation, she looked away, pretending he didn’t exist.

Instead, she smiled at Julian, reassuring him she wasn’t upset.

Lucas, ever protective, sauntered onto the stage. "Hey, Julian. Evelyn’s my scandal partner right now. Share the spotlight, yeah?"

The crowd roared with laughter.

Lucas’s intervention saved Julian from further awkwardness.

But someone had already recorded the moment.

Cassandra smirked at her phone, uploading the clip with vicious satisfaction.

Let the world see what a shameless woman Evelyn Sinclair is.

The banquet dragged on late into the night.

When it ended, Lucas arranged for Julian’s ride while he escorted Natalie home.

Evelyn had driven herself.

As she stepped outside, she spotted Nathan and Cassandra by the valet.

"Couldn’t you take me home? It’s so late, and I’m scared to go alone," Cassandra whined, her voice dripping with faux vulnerability.

Nathan’s brow twitched. "It’s out of the way."

"Then take a detour! What if something happens to me?"

She reached for his arm—

He sidestepped.

Evelyn, hidden behind a pillar, bit back a laugh.

Nathan’s voice was dry. "You won’t be in danger."

The unspoken jab hung in the air: If anything, you’re the danger.
###Chapter 155 Just So Unlucky

Cassandra Delacroix refused to back down, her lips parting to deliver another cutting remark.

The sudden ringing of Evelyn Sinclair's phone shattered the tense silence. The cheerful melody was jarringly out of place.

With an irritated sigh, Evelyn answered the call and stepped away. It was Lucas Sterling.

"I heard there's a dangerous fugitive in the area. Stay put—I'm sending someone to pick you up."

Evelyn's lips curved into a wry smile. "Don't worry, I can handle myself."

She strode past Nathan Blackwood and Cassandra without a backward glance.

"Evelyn!" Nathan called after her. Before she could react, he was already following. "Let me drive you home."

She arched an eyebrow, amused by his audacity.

"Since when are we on speaking terms?" she scoffed. "Did you hit your head? I don't need your help. Don't flatter yourself."

"There's a violent criminal loose nearby," Nathan insisted, his voice flat. "If anything happens to you, the media will crucify me."

His shadow stretched long under the flickering streetlight, making him look oddly vulnerable.

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn thought she detected genuine concern in his tone.

Since when does he care about my safety? She almost laughed. Next thing you know, pigs will fly.

Then Cassandra caught up, her face twisted in exaggerated distress.

Evelyn smirked. "No thanks. I'd rather take my chances with a fugitive than spend another minute in your company."

With that, she turned on her heel and left.

"That arrogant bitch!" Cassandra seethed. "How dare she humiliate me like this? She did that on purpose!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. Harrison pulled up in the car, and Nathan slid into the passenger seat without another word.

"Drive," he ordered coldly, ignoring Cassandra's protests. The car sped off.

The road ahead was poorly lit, several streetlights broken. An uneasy feeling settled in Nathan's chest.

Then he spotted it—a parked car up ahead, its interior dark.

"That's Evelyn's car."

It hadn't even been two minutes since they parted. Had something already happened?

"Stop the car!" Nathan barked.

He was out before the vehicle fully halted, sprinting toward the scene. Harrison followed close behind.

As they neared, a man's pained grunt reached their ears.

Evelyn stood in front of her car, facing a disheveled bald man clutching a knife.

The man's clothes were caked in mud, his expression wild with desperation.

Spotting the newcomers, he panicked and lunged at Evelyn.

She sidestepped effortlessly, her movements fluid and precise.

Sigh. Just my luck.

Of all people, I had to run into this psycho.

As the man swung the knife, Evelyn pivoted and delivered a sharp kick to his back.

His head slammed into the hood of her car with a sickening thud.

The man groaned, dazed but not defeated. He staggered up, raising the knife again—

Crack!

A scream tore through the night as the dagger clattered to the pavement.

Evelyn's stiletto heel was embedded in the back of his hand.

Harrison winced at the sound. If he hadn't seen it himself, he'd never believe the poised Evelyn Sinclair could fight like this.

She didn't give anyone a chance to play the hero.

Nathan moved before Harrison could react. "Call the police!" he snapped, already striding toward Evelyn.

Harrison fumbled for his phone.

Evelyn sensed someone approaching but didn't expect Nathan.

When she saw him, her expression cooled. She stepped past him without a word, swapping her ruined Chanel heels for spare flats.

The bloodstained designer shoes were a lost cause.

"Evelyn," Nathan said tightly. "Are you hurt?"
###Chapter 156 The Empty Fuel Tank

Nathan Blackwood seized Evelyn Sinclair's blood-smeared wrist, his voice rough with concern. "Whose blood is this?"

Evelyn jerked her arm free, avoiding his piercing gaze. "Not mine," she said curtly.

Without another word, she slid into her Lamborghini and turned the ignition. The police could handle the aftermath - she'd rather face a firing squad than spend another minute with Nathan.

His stormy eyes tracked her movements, jaw tightening at her icy dismissal.

Harrison finished restraining the assailant and rushed over. "Ms. Sterling, you should get checked at the hospital." His genuine concern made Evelyn soften.

"I'm fine, Harrison." She offered him a small smile. In those three miserable years of marriage, Harrison had been the only one who treated her with respect, never looking down on her like the rest of Nathan's circle.

Harrison frowned. "You're in shock. Let me call a driver for you."

Evelyn hesitated. She didn't trust herself behind the wheel right now, but waiting seemed equally unappealing.

Before Harrison could suggest an alternative, he suddenly stiffened under Nathan's glacial stare. The unspoken threat hung in the air like a guillotine blade.

Harrison cleared his throat. "Perhaps... President Blackwood could drive you home while I secure the suspect?"

The death glare lifted. Harrison exhaled in relief, feeling like he'd narrowly escaped career suicide.

"Have Nathan drive me?" Evelyn scoffed. "I'd rather wrestle another dozen armed criminals!"

Her engine sputtered and died.

She tried restarting it. Nothing. "Impossible. Archibald just imported this from Italy last week."

Harrison peered at the dashboard. "Ms. Sterling... you're out of gas."

"What the hell?!"

Nathan's lips curled into a mocking smirk as he slid into his custom Bentley. Harrison swallowed hard. "It's getting late. Please ride with us."

Evelyn shook her head, reaching for her phone. "I'll call Bennett."

At that moment, her phone buzzed with Emily Whitaker's caller ID. "Evelyn! We did it! The neural interface works perfectly - three-second full-body diagnostics with 99.9% accuracy! We've cracked the CNS integration!"

Evelyn's breath caught. This breakthrough in AI-assisted medicine could revolutionize healthcare worldwide. No more hospital queues, just instant, precise health assessments. Her fingers trembled with excitement.

Meanwhile, Nathan received the same update. His eyes lit with the same fervor - this project could change humanity's future.

"Harrison, I'm heading to Dominic's office," Nathan ordered.

"Understood, sir."

Evelyn threw her keys to Harrison. "I'm coming too." Professional curiosity overrode personal animosity. History was being made tonight.

She yanked open Nathan's passenger door and buckled up. "Drive."

Nathan drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, studying her with deliberate slowness. "Evelyn..."
###Chapter 157 No Strings Attached

Evelyn Sinclair arched a brow, her lips curling into a dangerous smirk. "Mr. Blackwood, are you attempting to leverage this situation to negotiate with me?" Her gaze burned like molten gold, sharp enough to cut glass.

It wasn’t a question—it was a warning.

Nathan Blackwood exhaled sharply, tearing his eyes away before starting the engine. The thought had crossed his mind, but now? He couldn’t bring himself to do it.

He still owed her.

He had no right to demand anything.

Forgiveness? After everything? Impossible.

When they arrived at the research facility, Evelyn practically launched herself out of the car before it fully stopped.

And there he was—Donovan Sterling, waiting at the entrance like a silent sentinel.

Evelyn sprinted toward him, leaping into his arms with a force that nearly knocked him back. "It worked?" she gasped, clinging to him like a koala.

Donovan chuckled, ruffling her hair. "Mm."

His eyes flickered past her to Nathan, who was approaching with a storm brewing in his expression.

Not that Donovan cared.

Evelyn buried her face in his shoulder, inhaling the familiar scent of antiseptic and faint cologne. "Why were you waiting outside?"

"For you," he said simply, nudging her toward the building.

To an outsider, they looked like lovers.

Nathan’s jaw clenched.

The sight of them twisted something inside him, a slow, suffocating burn spreading through his chest.

Inside, Dominic Kingsley was practically vibrating with excitement. "Evelyn! Where did you find this guy? He’s a goddamn prodigy!"

Evelyn blinked. "What?"

"Our most complex project—the one we’ve been stuck on for years—he solved it in one afternoon with a few formulas. No errors. No revisions. Just… perfection." Dominic raked a hand through his hair, awestruck. "He just saved us a decade of research and billions in funding."

His gaze swung to Donovan, reverence dripping from his voice. "Name your price. Ten times market rate. A hundred. Hell, I’ll give you equity in the company—just stay."

Donovan didn’t even glance up. "Not interested."

Evelyn shot Dominic a sympathetic look.

Money meant nothing to Donovan.

"You can break your contract—we’ll cover the penalties!" Dominic insisted desperately.

"National Laboratories," Evelyn said flatly.

Dominic froze.

"What?"

Evelyn tugged Donovan’s arm, steering him deeper into the facility. Behind them, Nathan lingered just long enough to deliver the final blow.

"Sunner is Donovan Sterling. If you value your company, drop this. You really think you can poach a national treasure?" He clapped Dominic on the shoulder, leaving him gaping in shock.

Sunner is Donovan Sterling?!

The 17-year-old who won the Breakthrough Prize?

The intern who had been quietly working here for a month?

Dominic stumbled after them. "What’s his relationship with Evelyn?"

Nathan’s voice was ice. "None."

Dominic scoffed. Bullshit.

Inside the lab, Emily Whitaker was practically bouncing as she presented a palm-sized, irregular sphere to Evelyn. "This is a microscopic bio-carrier. No blood tests needed—just three seconds of contact, and it scans your entire body."

Evelyn’s eyes widened. "You’re joking."

But with Donovan around, nothing was impossible.

Hesitantly, she pressed her palm against the sphere.

Warmth.

A soft blue glow pulsed beneath her fingertips.

One… Two… Three…

Ding!

"Abnormal condition detected," chirped a robotic voice. "Laceration on left inner arm: 9.9 cm in length, 4 mm depth. Clotting normal. Mild bacterial infection present. Recommended treatment: antiseptic and anti-inflammatory medication. Expected healing time: three to four days."

Silence.

Then chaos.

Emily gaped. "It detected that through your sleeve?"

Before she or Donovan could react, Nathan lunged forward, gripping Evelyn’s wrist. His voice was lethal.

"You said you weren’t hurt."
###Chapter 158 I Just Want to Make It up to Her

Evelyn Sinclair frowned. Why was Nathan Blackwood reacting so intensely? What did her injury have to do with him?

"Mr. Blackwood, let me." In the tense silence, Donovan Sterling stepped forward, gently removing Evelyn's arm from Nathan's grip. He rubbed the reddened skin where Nathan had held her too tightly.

Donovan had no patience for Nathan. Wasn't he Evelyn's ex-husband? Their marriage was over—this was none of his business. Guiding Evelyn to the lounge, he retrieved the first aid kit and carefully dressed her wound.

"How did this happen?"

Evelyn was still buzzing from the breakthrough with their AI medical device. The minor injury barely registered.

"It's nothing. Just a run-in with a thug. I handled him."

She grinned. "This scratch is nothing compared to what he got."

Donovan smirked. He knew Evelyn could fight. Anyone stupid enough to challenge her would regret it. His fingers worked deftly over the wound, applying antiseptic with practiced ease.

"You're too easily impressed. This prototype is child's play."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Of course a genius like Donovan would downplay their success. But to her, this was monumental.

"Next step—market launch! The world needs to see what we've achieved."

Donovan shook his head. "It's not ready."

"What do you mean? The chip diagnosed my injury perfectly—even recommended treatment!"

"It's limited," he countered. "The parameters we've set only cover basic conditions. Complex diseases? Specialized treatments? That requires human expertise."

Evelyn huffed. "Fine, maybe it won't replace doctors, but think of the time saved on routine cases! The ER backlog it could clear!"

Donovan sighed. "Global commercialization means navigating different countries' drug regulations. One recommended medication might be banned elsewhere."

Evelyn hadn't considered that. The road ahead was longer than she'd realized.

Still, today's success was historic.

Donovan flicked her forehead lightly. "Relax. This alone will double your net worth."

Her eyes sparkled. Even without mass production, the stock market would skyrocket at this news. Fortunes awaited.

Leaving the lounge, Evelyn spotted Nathan deep in conversation with Dominic Kingsley. She paused, catching her name.

"Mr. Blackwood, why the panic over Evelyn's injury?" Dominic's voice carried. "Still have feelings for your ex-wife?"

Nathan stood rigid, staring at the city lights beyond the window. His reply was ice-cold.

"No. I owe her. Making amends eases my conscience."

He hesitated, then added, "Feelings? Don't be absurd."

The words struck Evelyn like physical blows. That familiar ache returned—the suffocating weight of their failed marriage. She closed her eyes briefly, steadying herself.

When she opened them, her resolve was steel.

Leaving Nathan had been her best decision.

Donovan emerged, now changed. "Let's go."

At the sound, Nathan tensed. Turning slowly, his gaze locked onto Evelyn. A flicker of panic crossed his face.

Had she heard?

The thought unsettled him more than he cared to admit.
###Chapter 159 Her Love Triangle

Dominic Kingsley strode toward Evelyn Sinclair with barely contained excitement. His entire demeanor radiated triumph.

"Evelyn, we're holding a press conference tomorrow to announce our breakthrough—we're leading the world in medical innovation!"

Evelyn had already considered this, not wanting competitors to steal their thunder.

She smiled, amused by Dominic's enthusiasm. If she had overheard his earlier exchange with Nathan Blackwood, she gave no indication.

"Perfect. I'll be there." She turned to Donovan Sterling. "Want to come?"

Dominic's eyes gleamed with anticipation. Having Donovan's name attached would elevate the project even further.

Donovan shook his head.

His refusal was firm. Dominic's shoulders slumped slightly, but he knew better than to push the genius scientist.

Nathan's dark gaze lingered on Evelyn's injured arm.

For once, he wasn't seething with irritation. But Evelyn paid him no mind.

"How's your wound? Should we delay the press conference?" Nathan's voice was uncharacteristically measured.

Evelyn arched a brow, her lips curling into a cold smirk. "I won't die from it."

She didn't bother hiding her sarcasm. "Thanks for the concern, Mr. Blackwood. Spare me the act."

Then she blinked up at Donovan. "Ready to go home?"

Donovan nodded, draping his coat over her shoulders before meticulously fastening each button.

The oversized coat swallowed Evelyn's frame, making her look adorably small. Dominic gaped.

The man who revolutionizes science is buttoning her coat like a doting husband?!

Nathan's jaw tightened at Evelyn's sharp dismissal. The chill in her voice cut deeper than he expected.

Then she said home—with him.

His chest constricted.

"Do you need a ride?" Nathan bit out abruptly.

Dominic's eyebrows shot up. Nathan Blackwood offering to chauffeur someone?

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "We're not headed the same way."

We. She'd drawn a line between them so clearly it might as well have been a wall.

Nathan's expression darkened.

Without another word, Evelyn and Donovan walked away. Nathan watched until they disappeared, his fists clenched.

Dominic smirked. "Well, that answers my earlier question." He couldn't resist adding, "Seems they're living together, huh?"

Nathan's glare could have frozen lava. He stormed off without another word.

Exhausted from the night's events, Evelyn collapsed into bed the moment they returned.

Morning light streamed through the sheer curtains, but she burrowed deeper under the covers—until her phone blared incessantly.

Natalie Beaumont's name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn groaned. "Can't my friends let me sleep?"

She answered, voice rough with sleep. "Nat, what's so urgent?"

"You're trending as Julian Moreau's sugar mommy, and you're still asleep?"

Evelyn bolted upright. "What? I just met him yesterday!"

Natalie laughed. "Someone edited footage from his speech and dragged Lucas into it. Your love triangle's practically a bestselling plot now."

"Let me guess—Cassandra Delacroix?"

"Bingo!"

Evelyn threw off the covers, seething. "Today's supposed to be my payday, and she pulls this?"

Her eyes flashed dangerously.

"Anyone who messes with my money will regret it."
###Chapter 160 I'll Bury Him

The moment Evelyn Sinclair ended her call with Natalie Beaumont, she immediately dialed Bennett.

"Is it too late to acquire a company before the press conference?" There was a brief pause as Bennett processed the question.

"That depends on the company's size. Has President Sinclair developed an addiction to corporate takeovers?"

"Celestial Media."

"That's not as simple as Kensington Group last week. The paperwork will be tedious and take several days. However..." His tone shifted. "We already hold 16% of their shares."

"Horizon Media owns 30%. If you secure just five percent more, you'll become the largest shareholder—effectively gaining control. It would be no different from an outright acquisition."

Evelyn's lips curved in satisfaction. "Make it happen. Quickly." She hung up, tending to her wound before leisurely preparing a sandwich. As she ate, she scrolled through today's trending topics—predictably dominated by her name.

[Julian Moreau has a crush on Evelyn Sinclair's type! Same!]
[I'd normally despise a homewrecker, but if it's Evelyn? Iconic.]
[Lucas Sterling must be fuming!]
[Honestly, they'd make a stunning couple. The chemistry!]
[Isn't Julian underage? Is this even legal?]
[Rumor has it Celestial Media plans to smear Julian. Sugar Mama Evelyn, save your boy!]

Evelyn scoffed, tossing her phone aside. The internet loved turning drama into a spectacle.

After breakfast, instead of heading to Sterling Corp, she went straight to Horizon Media. If she was taking over Celestial Media, she needed someone reliable to handle the logistics—and Dominic Young was the perfect candidate.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the lobby, her gaze landed on Cassandra Delacroix, draped in head-to-toe designer labels, oozing arrogance.

Cassandra was the epitome of a spoiled heiress—wasting her family's fortune abroad, then strutting around like she'd conquered the world. The irony? She couldn't even hold a fluent conversation in any foreign language.

Evelyn wondered where she got the audacity.

She intended to ignore Cassandra, but the woman spotted her instantly, eyes lighting up with malicious glee.

"Evelyn! Here to beg Dominic for help with your PR crisis?" Cassandra's grin was venomous, her voice dripping with faux sweetness. "How pathetic."

Evelyn paused, tilting her head. A slow, dangerous smirk played on her lips. "Since when do you have a say in Horizon Media's affairs?"

Cassandra's expression darkened, resentment flaring. She hadn't forgotten how Nathan Blackwood had abandoned her to chase after Evelyn. The humiliation still burned.

"Nobody in this industry dares to cross me," she hissed. "I came here to make sure your reputation craters. You might be untouchable in your little corporate bubble, but I’ll have the entire internet dragging you until you question your existence. Understand?"

Evelyn crossed her arms, fingers tapping idly against her sleeve. Her voice turned icy. "So you're the one spreading rumors that I'm Julian’s sugar mommy?" She arched a brow. "Tell me, Cassandra—are you trying to provoke me?"

Cassandra lifted her chin, smugness radiating off her. "Consider it a lesson. The world doesn’t revolve around you. Did Julian say he admires you? Good. I’ll bury him at the peak of his fame. Let’s see who really holds the power here."

She wasn’t afraid of Evelyn.

Three years ago, Evelyn had stolen Nathan from her. Now? This was payback.

Cassandra would relish watching Evelyn's downfall.
###Chapter 161 The Queen of Horror

Cassandra's threat hung in the air like cheap perfume.

Evelyn Sinclair merely tilted her chin down, her lips curling into an amused smirk. Not a single tremor of fear betrayed her composure.

To her, Cassandra Delacroix's words were nothing more than the pathetic rantings of a desperate woman.

Just as Cassandra's face twisted with rage, Evelyn finally spoke in that cool, detached tone that drove her enemies mad. "Tell me, Ms. Delacroix—are you throwing this tantrum because of Nathan Blackwood?"

A flicker of panic crossed Cassandra's features before she lifted her chin defiantly. "Why should I deny it? Since you're already divorced, stay the hell away from him! Or I'll make sure you regret it."

Evelyn arched a brow, her laugh sharp as shattered glass. "How amusing. I don't make a habit of revisiting trash I've already taken out."

She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "If anything, you should be begging him to stay away from me. What is it about Nathan that turns women into fools? I was blind once—but never again."

Cassandra's face flushed crimson.

The way Evelyn carried herself—regal, untouchable, effortlessly radiant—made Cassandra's blood boil. How dare she dismiss the man Cassandra coveted like he was nothing?

"You want to bury Julian Moreau?" Evelyn continued, her gaze slicing through Cassandra like a blade. "Then watch me make him a star."

Her smile was poison. "Let me show you who really holds the power here."

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms. "You arrogant bitch! We'll see who comes out on top!"

Evelyn didn't bother responding. She simply turned on her heel and strode toward the elevators, leaving Cassandra fuming in her wake.

The receptionist perked up instantly at Evelyn's approach. "Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Young will be thrilled you're here. Shall I notify him?"

Evelyn gave a graceful nod. "No need. I'll head up."

The receptionist rushed to summon the elevator, blatantly ignoring Cassandra.

"Excuse me!" Cassandra snapped. "Are you blind? I demand to see Dominic Young immediately!"

The receptionist blinked, unimpressed. "Miss, if you're here for an audition, we don't accept walk-ins. You'll need an appointment."

Cassandra's jaw dropped. "Audition? Do I look like some desperate starlet to you?"

The receptionist gave her a once-over. "Honestly? No. Our casting directors prefer natural beauty."

Evelyn burst out laughing.

Cassandra whirled on her, teeth bared. "What's so funny?"

Evelyn wiped a tear from her eye, still grinning. "Oh, nothing. Just imagining you as the lead in a horror film. You'd be perfect."

Cassandra lunged—only to be blocked by security.

"Mark my words, Evelyn!" she shrieked. "You won't be laughing when I'm done with you!"

Evelyn merely waved over her shoulder as the elevator doors slid shut.
###Chapter 162 Her Father Wouldn't Dare

Cassandra Delacroix's words were cut off as the private elevator chimed its arrival.

Dominic Young stepped out, his sharp gaze sweeping across the lobby before landing on Evelyn Sinclair. A visible relief washed over his features as he approached with a respectful nod.

"Ms. Sinclair, you only needed to call. There was no need for you to come personally."

His deferential tone contrasted sharply with his usual commanding presence in the entertainment industry.

Cassandra's lips twisted in irritation. She couldn't stand how this woman wielded power simply by being born into the Sterling family.

"Dominic Young!" she snapped. "Do you know who you're talking to?"

His expression turned glacial. "I believe you were about to threaten physical violence against Ms. Sinclair?"

Cassandra lifted her chin. "I'm the daughter of Celestial Media's CEO! Ask Evelyn if you don't believe me!"

The desperation in her voice was palpable as she invoked Evelyn's name for validation.

Evelyn merely smiled, content to watch Cassandra dig her own grave. She wouldn't lift a finger to help.

Dominic's lips curled in derision. "Your father wouldn't dare speak to me like that. You've got nerve."

Cassandra's confidence wavered as Dominic failed to show the deference she expected. She'd always assumed her father and Dominic were equals.

"Mr. Young," she tried again, emphasizing, "I'm here on business matters."

Dominic dismissed her with a wave. "You're not qualified to discuss business with me. I don't entertain irrelevant people."

He turned to the receptionist. "Donovan, have security escort her out."

"Yes, sir," Donovan responded promptly.

Dominic offered Evelyn a reassuring smile. "You're completely safe here, Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn nodded, unfazed by Cassandra's empty threats. "She's all bark and no bite."

As they entered the elevator, Evelyn handed Dominic her phone. "This might help clear Julian's name."

The recording of Cassandra's earlier outburst played clearly. Dominic's smirk grew with each passing second.

"Ms. Sinclair," he teased, "you set quite the elaborate trap."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "I've initiated the acquisition of Celestial Media. The shareholders' meeting is this afternoon. Any issues on your end?"

Dominic straightened immediately. "None whatsoever. Horizon Media is at your complete disposal."

He'd known since taking the helm that crossing the Sterlings was professional suicide.

Evelyn chuckled. "You'll have your hands full managing both companies after the merger."

Dominic's eyes lit up at the unspoken offer. "How exciting! I suppose I'll just have to work harder." He winked. "I'm still young, after all."

Evelyn fought back a laugh at the forty-something executive's declaration.

Their discussion turned to post-acquisition strategies. As it wound down, Evelyn asked, "How's Julian holding up? This can't be easy for a new actor."

"He's fine," Dominic assured. "Though his team is panicking. They got thrown out of Celestial Media when they tried to plead his case." He added confidently, "But with your help, this will blow over quickly."

Evelyn nodded. "Give him more projects as compensation. He got caught in the crossfire because of me."

Dominic grinned. "Of course. No one would dare mess with your protégé."

"Get lost!" Evelyn shot back, her cheeks flushing. Dominic had spent too much time with Lucas - they'd both developed the same infuriating habit of teasing her.

Business concluded, Evelyn strode away in her designer heels. Any longer and she might have punched someone.

Within minutes, the recording went viral, dethroning the "sugar mama" scandal as the top trending topic.

Cassandra hadn't even made it back to Celestial Media to complain to her father before the internet exploded with investigations into "Ms. Sinclair." Soon, Cassandra's own dirty laundry began surfacing.
###Chapter 163 Evelyn Sinclair's Favorite

Cassandra Delacroix had been expelled from high school for bullying classmates and was shipped off to Europe for a year of "character rehabilitation."

When Cassandra returned to Montecito, she became obsessed with Nathan Blackwood, but her confession ended in brutal rejection. Undeterred, she flew to Seoul for extensive plastic surgery, leaving none of her original features intact.

The moment Cassandra caught wind of Nathan's divorce, she rushed back to Montecito like a storm.

But what truly set the internet ablaze was the second half of that leaked recording:

"Ms. Delacroix, is this all because of Nathan Blackwood? I don’t make a habit of revisiting discarded trash."

"Tell him to stay out of my way! You want to bury Julian? Fine. I’ll make sure he shines brighter than ever."

"Let me remind you—I decide who rules this game."

The comments section erupted.

(OMG! The sheer audacity! Queen Evelyn is unstoppable!)

(With a fortune like hers, why would she waste time on an ex? Fresh talent is way more exciting!)

(Thank you, Ms. Sinclair, for noticing our Julian! He deserves the world!)

(Cassandra is pathetic. She should crawl back into whatever hole she came from.)

(Evelyn’s dominance is everything. Forever my idol!)

(Age is just a number, but youth? Irresistible. Evelyn knows what she wants!)

The aftermath? The world now believed Evelyn Sinclair had a soft spot for gorgeous young men.

Blackwood Enterprises

The air in Nathan’s office turned glacial.

Silence.

Nathan’s expression was thunderous, his aura so oppressive that Harrison nearly flinched.

Harrison had seen the news at dawn and reported it immediately. But before they could react, public opinion had already shifted.

At first, people mocked Evelyn for being Julian’s "sugar mommy." Now? They praised her for having impeccable taste.

Harrison had never felt minutes drag so painfully.

Nathan’s fury was a living thing, suffocating the room.

He scrolled through the comments, jaw clenched. Some fans had even edited clips of Evelyn and Julian, adding romantic music as if they were the next power couple.

Julian, the rising star. Nathan, the "overpowered has-been."

With a snarl, Nathan hurled his phone against the wall. The screen shattered.

Harrison stiffened.

Nathan’s voice was razor-sharp. "Don’t these people have jobs? ‘Young hunk’? He looks like a child! How is that compatibility?"

Harrison swallowed. "Julian’s fans are delusional. There’s no way Ms. Sinclair would seriously entertain him. He’s just using her for clout."

Internally, he sighed. Why does he even care? They’re divorced.

Nathan’s mind circled back to Evelyn’s words—discarded trash.

Was that meant for him?

His grip tightened.

"Then what," Nathan bit out, "do you think Evelyn actually likes?"

Harrison hesitated.

Nathan’s glare darkened. That night, she smiled at Harrison more in five minutes than she ever did at me in years.

Why?

The bitterness in his chest was impossible to ignore.
###Chapter 164 The Type She Likes

For a brief moment, Harrison felt as though an unseen force had lifted him from his chair by the collar of his shirt.

The suffocating tension in the room was unbearable.

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze darkened when Harrison remained silent.

"You two are close, aren't you?" Nathan's voice was deceptively calm, each word laced with lethal precision. "Tell me, what kind of man does she prefer?"

Harrison swallowed hard. If he didn't answer, he wasn’t sure he’d leave this office unscathed.

Working for Nathan had always been dangerous, but today felt like walking a tightrope over a pit of vipers.

Clearing his throat, Harrison forced out a reply.

"Mr. Blackwood, I wouldn’t say I’m particularly close to Ms. Sinclair. How would I know her preferences?"

Nathan’s icy stare made him hastily add, "But—given that she chose to marry you despite everything, it’s obvious she prefers someone like you! That Julian Moreau is nothing in comparison. There’s no way Ms. Sinclair would lower her standards for him."

Nathan exhaled sharply, finally looking away. Harrison barely suppressed a sigh of relief.

That was too close.

After a tense silence, Nathan spoke again. "Start preparing for the press conference."

"Ensure Kingsley Tech’s event goes flawlessly. No mistakes."

"Understood. I’ll oversee everything personally," Harrison replied, already backing toward the door.

Nathan scoffed, picking up his phone only to toss it aside again in disgust. The endless gossip about Evelyn and Julian was infuriating.

How dare they compare that nobody to me? Are the public blind?

Across the city, the media frenzy had reached a fever pitch.

Evelyn Sinclair and Julian Moreau’s rumored relationship had become the nation’s hottest topic. Though neither had confirmed anything, fans had already paired them together.

Meanwhile, Lucas Sterling’s social media was flooded with messages—some sympathizing, others offering advice on how to win Evelyn back.

A few even urged him to move on.

The joint project between Kingsley Tech, Sterling Corporation, and Blackwood Industries had already drawn massive attention.

Now, the three companies were holding a high-profile press conference, instantly dominating headlines.

Every major news outlet scrambled for details, but Dominic Kingsley had kept everything tightly under wraps.

By the time the event began, three hundred journalists packed the venue, buzzing with anticipation.

Alongside the press, world-renowned medical experts and leading AI specialists had been invited, lending an air of gravitas to the occasion.

At the appointed hour, Dominic Kingsley, Nathan Blackwood, and Evelyn Sinclair appeared together on stage.

Evelyn, standing between the two powerful men, commanded attention effortlessly. Her poise was regal, her beauty undeniable.

She was born to stand at the pinnacle, untouchable.

Dominic looked impeccable in his tailored smoky-gray suit, exuding quiet authority.

Nathan, in his signature black ensemble, was the epitome of cold elegance—untouchable, formidable.

The trio’s presence alone eclipsed every celebrity in the room. Had they chosen entertainment over business, they would’ve dominated the industry.

Though the internet buzzed with speculation about Nathan and Evelyn’s relationship, no one dared broach the subject today.

This was far too serious an occasion for gossip.

Dominic stepped forward.

"Let’s begin."
###Chapter 165 Personal Question

The entire presentation was dominated by Dominic Kingsley's articulate explanation of the revolutionary AI chip, which he proudly named Aether Core.

Its potential impact stretched far beyond Montecito—this breakthrough would redefine medical science globally. A true game-changer.

Evelyn Sinclair maintained her composed smile throughout the press conference, her attention fixed on Dominic's every word.

Her eyes sparkled with restrained excitement. At this moment, she couldn't help but reflect on those wasted years of marriage.

I should have focused on my career from the start.

As Dominic concluded, the room erupted in thunderous applause. Experts and journalists swarmed him, eager for more details. The conference extended another hour.

Evelyn checked her phone. A message from Bennett confirmed everything was set for the Celestial Media acquisition. All that remained was her presence at the shareholders' meeting.

She stood, intending to slip out unnoticed.

But the moment she stepped into the hallway, reporters surrounded her.

"Ms. Sinclair, any comments on today's announcement?"

Evelyn gave a polite smile. "Mr. Kingsley covered everything inside. I suggest you direct your questions to him."

Her approachable demeanor eased the tension.

"Ms. Sinclair, may we ask a personal question?"

She arched a brow but didn't refuse outright.

"Depends how personal. I reserve the right not to answer."

A reporter grinned. "Julian Moreau recently named you as his ideal type in an interview. What kind of man do you prefer?"

The air thickened with anticipation.

Evelyn's smile widened.

"Like everyone else, I admire Julian."

A diplomatic answer—one that left room for interpretation.

Admire, not desire. They should know the difference.

The reporters chuckled but didn't press further, parting to let her pass.

Then they noticed Nathan Blackwood standing nearby.

His icy glare silenced them instantly. This was the man who could dismantle media empires overnight—the one person journalists feared most.

Evelyn pretended not to see him. She turned back to the cameras, flashing a radiant smile before striding away, her heels clicking confidently against the marble floor.

Inside her car, Bennett handed her a document.

"Five percent of Celestial Media's shares were acquired by Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn froze.

Before she could react, a sharp knock sounded on the window.

Nathan stood outside, his expression dark, brows furrowed.

She lowered the window just enough.

"Mr. Blackwood. Is there a problem? I have a shareholders' meeting to attend."

"My car broke down." He gestured to the Range Rover parked nearby, where Harrison knelt beside a tire, holding a nail with visible reluctance.

Evelyn smirked. "You're not on my way. So, no."

She moved to raise the window, but his hand blocked it.

"You didn't even ask where I'm going." His voice was dangerously smooth, laced with suppressed irritation.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Is he really this dense?

She met his gaze, her lips curling into a cold smile.

"I don't need to ask. Wherever it is, I'm not interested."
###Chapter 166 Transfer Funds to Mr. Blackwood

The air inside the luxury sedan turned thick with tension.

Nathan's jaw clenched visibly, his stormy gaze locked onto Evelyn. His lips pressed into a thin, disapproving line.

With no audience to perform for, Evelyn didn't bother maintaining their usual facade of civility. To her, Nathan Blackwood had forfeited any right to forgiveness long ago. She treated complete strangers - Sebastian Hart, Lucas Sterling, Donovan, even Julian Moreau - with more warmth than she'd ever show him.

Evelyn lounged carelessly in her seat, waiting for Nathan to take the hint and leave.

Her car wasn't some public space where just anyone could linger. Especially not Nathan Blackwood! A full sixty seconds ticked by with him stubbornly remaining in place.

Her brows knitted together in irritation. Was he being deliberately obtuse? Just as she prepared to verbally evict him, Nathan finally spoke, his voice like ice cracking.

"Evelyn, are you certain you won't attend the event with me?" Absolutely certain, she thought.

Before she could voice this, Bennett cleared his throat meaningfully beside her.

Nathan gave a humorless chuckle. "Though you've purchased those five percent shares of Celestial Media from me, the paperwork remains unsigned."

"We can consider the deal void if you're unwilling." Evelyn's eyes widened. What fresh hell was this?

Bennett winced, then explained hurriedly, "Ms. Sinclair, I was just about to mention this detail."

"Mr. Blackwood did agree to the share transfer, but the final signatures are still pending." Evelyn inhaled sharply through her nose, shooting her assistant a withering look.

Why hadn't he mentioned this crucial detail sooner? Bennett ducked his head, wisely avoiding her glare. Nathan's lips quirked in a smirk that would make lesser women swoon.

He drummed his fingers twice against the window frame, waiting.

One heartbeat. Two. Then he turned sharply on his heel.

"Wait!" The word escaped Evelyn before she could stop it. Nathan paused mid-step. She closed her eyes briefly, fists tightening before addressing Bennett through gritted teeth.

"Why haven't you opened the door for Mr. Blackwood yet?" Bennett scrambled to obey, opening the rear passenger door with excessive politeness.

"Mr. Blackwood, if you please." Nathan's back remained turned, but the ghost of a satisfied smile flickered across his face before vanishing. Without ceremony, he slid into the leather seat.

The moment he entered, her signature Chanel No. 5 enveloped him - that distinctive blend of floral and aldehydic notes that was so quintessentially Evelyn. Strangely, the scent he usually found cloying on other women seemed to suit her perfectly.

Evelyn examined the documents in her lap. Sure enough, Nathan's signature was conspicuously absent from the transfer papers.

Her lips thinned as she regarded him coolly. "Mr. Blackwood, why are you divesting from Celestial Media? And why now?" Surely the Blackwood fortune wasn't so depleted that he needed to liquidate assets.

Nathan studied her guarded expression, the perpetual distrust in her eyes. Would she ever believe he could act without ulterior motives? Wordlessly, he took the documents from her, scrawled his signature with a flourish, and handed them back.

"Satisfied?" Evelyn stared at the bold ink strokes, momentarily transported back to their divorce papers - signed with that same decisive finality. She blinked away the memory, her expression turning arctic.

"Ensure Mr. Blackwood receives payment immediately," she instructed Bennett, who nodded vigorously. No debts between them, no lingering connections.

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes as she changed subjects. "You know what I'm planning to do about Cassandra Delacroix, don't you? I'd have thought you'd show her more leniency, given her... devotion to you. But then, you've never been kind to women who love you."
###Chapter 167 Not Necessarily Yours

Evelyn's casual remark struck Nathan like a lightning bolt. His chest tightened as her words echoed in his mind.

Had he always been so heartless to the women who loved him? First Evelyn, then Vanessa, and now Cassandra Delacroix. Nathan's jaw clenched as dark emotions swirled in his stormy gray eyes.

His voice dropped to a husky whisper when he finally spoke. "Evelyn, you're different from them." At least Evelyn had once been his wife. The others meant nothing to him.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her lips curling into a bitter smile. When she looked up again, her sapphire eyes had turned to ice. "Of course I'm different. I was the lucky one who married you because of my rare blood type." Her mocking laugh cut through the tense air before she turned away sharply.

Nathan's frown deepened. That wasn't what he meant at all.

"We've arrived, Ms. Sinclair," Bennett announced, relief evident in his voice. The car ride had been torture. Evelyn practically flung the door open, desperate to escape the suffocating atmosphere.

Nathan followed close behind. The two had just left Kingsley Tech's press conference together, and now they were arriving at Celestial Media's headquarters simultaneously. Every head turned as they stepped out of the same black limousine.

The sudden shareholders meeting was already raising eyebrows. Having both Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair show up together sent shockwaves through Celestial Media's executives. None dared to offend either powerhouse.

"Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair..." The greetings came rapid-fire as executives scrambled to show respect. Nathan barely nodded, his mood too foul for pleasantries.

Vincent Delacroix, Celestial Media's chairman, personally escorted them to the elevator, bowing slightly. "After you." No one else would presume to share the elevator with such important figures.

Nathan stepped in first, but Evelyn remained outside with a polite smile. "You all go ahead. I need to make a call." She turned on her heel without a backward glance.

Nathan's hands clenched into fists at his sides. Though unspoken, her message was clear - she couldn't stand being confined with him. The others exchanged confused glances but obeyed without question.

Bennett quickly made excuses for Evelyn as the group proceeded to the top-floor conference room. Soon the lounge area stood empty except for Evelyn.

She took Lucas's call by the floor-to-ceiling windows, discussing trivial matters before hanging up. When she turned, she found herself face-to-face with a furious Cassandra Delacroix.

"Evelyn!" Cassandra spat the name like a curse. "What the hell are you doing here?" Since the recording of Cassandra's verbal attack on Evelyn went viral, public opinion had turned sharply against her.

Despite spending a fortune on damage control, Cassandra couldn't escape the backlash. Overnight, she'd become social media's favorite villain. Meanwhile, Evelyn appeared at the press conference with Nathan and Dominic Kingsley, cool and composed as ever.

The media dubbed Evelyn "The Most Captivating CEO in History," while Cassandra had to flee her spa appointment mid-treatment from all the Evelyn praise. The injustice burned in Cassandra's chest.

Now finding Evelyn lounging in her family company like she owned the place? Unacceptable. "This is my territory!" Cassandra hissed, her manicured nails digging into her palms. "I won't tolerate your presence here."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her icy blue eyes. "As a shareholder of Celestial Media, I don't need your permission to attend meetings." She tilted her head, a panther toying with its prey. "Unless I'm mistaken, you don't actually hold any shares, do you?"

Cassandra's face twisted with rage. "This is my family's business! I can come whenever I want. You're the one who doesn't belong here!" Her voice rose to a shrill pitch. "That pathetic little stake of yours means nothing! My father will buy you out immediately, so get out!"

Evelyn tucked a stray golden lock behind her ear, her movements deliberate. "Your family business?" Her lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Not necessarily." The mocking glint in her eyes promised a storm coming.

Soon, Celestial Media wouldn't belong to the Delacroix family at all. It would be hers.
###Chapter 168 Is This Your Worth?

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't wait to witness Cassandra Delacroix's reaction. The anticipation sent a thrill down her spine.

"Don't flatter yourself, Evelyn! You're no better than me!" Cassandra's voice trembled with barely contained rage. "We both rely on family connections, so who are you to look down on me?"

Her manicured fingers dug into her arms as she squared her shoulders. The elevator lobby's harsh lighting accentuated the venom in her glare.

"Weren't you thrown out by the Blackwoods too? Now you're just using your family name to chase after Nathan again?" Cassandra's laugh was brittle. "Pathetic. Tell me, Evelyn - is this really your worth?"

She waited for the outburst, the tears, anything to crack Evelyn's infuriating composure. Instead, she got a smirk that could freeze hell.

"Ms. Delacroix," Evelyn's voice was glacial silk, "even you should know this by now. The Blackwoods didn't discard me."

She took a deliberate step forward, the click of her Louboutins echoing in the sudden silence. "I walked away from Nathan Blackwood. And unlike you, I'd never degrade myself by changing my face for a man's attention."

The elevator dinged its arrival just as Evelyn turned away, leaving Cassandra gaping like a beached fish.

It took three heartbeats for the insult to register. Cassandra's shriek shattered the corporate calm. "How dare you! In my own building!"

Blind rage propelled her forward. She grabbed Evelyn's wrist with enough force to leave bruises, her other hand raised to strike.

The slap never landed.

A polished Oxford shoe connected with Cassandra's ribs first. The impact sent her sprawling across the marble in a tangle of designer fabric and shattered dignity.

Vincent Delacroix emerged from the elevator, his expression thunderous. "You'd lay hands on a Sinclair in my presence?" His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Should've stayed in that Seoul hospital bed, daughter."
###Chapter 169 I Hit You on Purpose

Cassandra Delacroix didn't give a damn about consequences. She reached out to grab her father's arm. "Dad, why are you—"

Vincent Delacroix shoved her off, his mind replaying Evelyn Sinclair's warning. With a rough jerk, he yanked Cassandra back.

His grip was bruising. "Listen carefully. Evelyn Sinclair controls Sterling Corporation now. She could wipe this company off the map with a single word. So unless you want to end up penniless in Seoul, you will shut your mouth and behave."

Cassandra's face paled. A cold dread slithered through her veins.

Inside the elevator, Evelyn and Nathan Blackwood stood in silence until they reached the conference room doors.

Bennett was already waiting. He opened the door for them without a word. Nathan's presence alone commanded attention—intimidating, magnetic, impossible to ignore.

Yet when they entered, Evelyn walked ahead of him.

Her aura matched his, but with an icy elegance that made her impossible to overlook. The moment she stepped inside, Vincent and Cassandra scrambled to follow.

The meeting began.

Evelyn barely spoke, letting Bennett handle the proceedings with crisp efficiency. Cassandra sat stiffly, her palms clammy, her mind numb.

She couldn't tear her eyes away from Evelyn—regal, untouchable, seated at the head of the table like a queen.

The gap between them wasn't just wealth or status. It was power.

And Evelyn had just demonstrated exactly how much of it she wielded.

Nathan watched Evelyn with unwavering focus, as if she were the sole reason he'd bothered to attend.

Cassandra heard every word.

Evelyn now controlled Celestial Media as its majority shareholder.

She'd removed Vincent Delacroix as chairman and replaced him with Dominic Young of Horizon Media.

Celestial was now just another subsidiary under Sterling Corporation’s empire.

Evelyn’s lips curled slightly as she watched Cassandra’s expression shift from shock to horror.

Pathetic. But entertaining.

After this, Vincent wouldn’t dare keep his troublesome daughter around. Not when he had an illegitimate son waiting in the wings.

Good riddance.

When the meeting ended, Evelyn didn’t linger. A glance at Bennett was all it took—he stayed to handle the cleanup while she left.

Alone in her car, Evelyn turned the key and pulled into traffic.

A Range Rover crawled ahead of her at the intersection.

Her fingers tapped impatiently against the wheel. The moment it inched forward, she pressed the accelerator—

CRASH.

The impact jolted her forward.

Damn it.

She shouldn’t have tailgated.

Just her luck—a perfect day ruined by a fender bender.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and reached for the door handle.

Then the driver of the Range Rover stepped out.

Her stomach dropped.

Nathan Blackwood.

She squinted at the license plate. Same model, different number.

Of course. He owns half a dozen identical cars.

Nathan strode toward her, his expression thunderous. He rapped sharply on her window.

Dark, piercing eyes locked onto hers through the glass.

Evelyn swallowed.

She was at fault. She’d pay.

But the way he was looking at her—

"Nathan, I can explain—"

His voice cut through the glass, low and accusing.

"Evelyn. You hit me on purpose."
###Chapter 170 Private Settlement?

Evelyn's mind raced. Did he just accuse me of deliberately hitting his car? The audacity!

Her fingers tightened around the steering wheel. It was clearly him who slammed on the brakes without warning.

A fleeting memory surfaced - hadn't she seen a child walking near the Range Rover moments before impact?

No escaping now. She rolled down her window, lips pressed into a thin line before curving into a mocking smile.

"Guilty as charged." Her voice dripped with icy amusement. "I absolutely meant to rear-end you."

Nathan's eyes narrowed, his frown deepening.

"Interesting admission." His gravelly voice held no warmth. "What's your play here?"

Evelyn met his gaze with frosty indifference.

"Name your price. I'll cover the damages."

Truthfully, she could've fought liability. But having admitted fault, there was no taking it back now.

Nathan glanced away, pulling out his phone. "I'll bill you after repairs. Still using the same number?"

"No." The lie slipped out before she could stop it.

He dialed right in front of her. The automated "number unavailable" message made his jaw clench.

Evelyn's pulse jumped. Having the man she'd blocked standing two feet away was... uncomfortable.

"Just give me a figure now." She grabbed her phone, desperate to end this encounter.

"Repairs first." Nathan's tone turned flinty. "Leave me a working number."

His sudden intensity made her pause. This wasn't about money - he wanted her to unblock him.

"Contact my assistant," she countered.

Nathan pocketed his phone with finality. "Forget it then. Consider it a gift."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. Was he trying to paint her as irresponsible? Or worse - imply she couldn't pay?

Fine. She'd play his game. For now.

"My number's unchanged." She turned the ignition, eager to leave.

Nathan didn't move.

After two tense seconds, he suddenly leaned in, one hand gripping her steering wheel. His long fingers looked sculpted for piano keys.

Evelyn froze at his unexpected proximity.

"Evelyn," his deep voice rumbled dangerously close, "you wouldn't drive off and conveniently forget, would you?"

She inhaled sharply, irritation flashing in her eyes.

"Unlike some, I honor my debts." Snatching her phone, she unblocked his number and called him immediately.

The screen lit up with her old contact name: "Mrs. Blackwood."
###Chapter 171 As Long as You Both Remarry

Evelyn Sinclair glanced at Nathan Blackwood, her gaze inadvertently catching the caller ID flashing on his phone.

Her breath hitched as if she'd been struck by an invisible force.

A sharp pain spread through her chest. Without waiting for Nathan's response, Evelyn turned away sharply, pressing the accelerator and speeding off.

Her eyes burned with unshed tears. She let out a bitter laugh.

Missus?

That's what he still called her?

She had been his wife once—but not anymore. That title no longer belonged to her.

Nathan watched Evelyn's car disappear into the distance before looking down at his phone.

Missus.

The memories from before their divorce surged forward, vivid and relentless.

A dull ache settled in his chest, as if an unseen hand were squeezing his heart. His breathing grew heavier.

He had taken her love for granted.

Now, he had to fight to win her back.

Karma, indeed.

His phone buzzed again—Sophia Blackwood, his sister.

"Brother, Grandfather wants you back at the estate immediately."

"Got it."

Nathan hung up before she could say more. He exhaled sharply, trying to push away the suffocating weight in his chest.

It didn’t help.

Sophia scowled at her phone. She had hoped to gloat, but Nathan had cut her off.

He had given up his shares in Celestial Media—handing control to Evelyn.

Old Master Blackwood had been furious, nearly collapsing from rage. Sophia had already endured his wrath for failing to apologize to Evelyn properly.

Now that his anger had shifted to Nathan, she could finally breathe.

When Nathan's car pulled into the Blackwood estate, the tension in the air was palpable.

The butler greeted him the moment he stepped inside. "Young Master, the Old Master is waiting in the study."

Nathan nodded and ascended the stairs without a word.

The second he reached the study door, a teacup shattered against the wall beside him.

Nathan sidestepped, his expression cold.

"You dare show your face here?!" Old Master Blackwood's voice boomed from within.

The room was thick with tension.

"What's this about?" Nathan asked flatly.

Old Master Blackwood's jaw clenched. "You handed over your Celestial Media shares to Evelyn Sinclair just because she wanted to deal with Cassandra Delacroix? Since when do you obey her so blindly?"

His grandfather had always prided himself on Nathan's business acumen.

But lately, Blackwood Corporation's reputation had suffered—especially online. With Evelyn needing their help, this was the perfect opportunity to negotiate.

Yet Nathan had thrown it away.

How could the old man not be furious?

Nathan remained indifferent. "There was nothing to negotiate. We owe her. It was the right thing to do."

His voice was icy. "Besides, Celestial Media has been hemorrhaging money. Holding onto those shares was pointless."

He had no interest in cleaning up their mess.

If Evelyn wanted the company, she could have it.

Old Master Blackwood's anger faltered slightly at Nathan's reasoning.

If that was the case… perhaps it wasn’t entirely foolish.

His expression softened marginally. "Floyd—William Sterling—won’t forgive us easily. But an outright war benefits no one. He’s holding back—for now."

He leaned forward. "But this can’t continue. I have a solution."

Nathan frowned.

The old man continued, "In terms of family, talent, and capability, you and Evelyn are perfectly matched."

"If she hadn’t hidden her identity when she married you before, William Sterling’s daughter would have been your wife."

Nathan’s head snapped up, already anticipating what was coming.

Old Master Blackwood met his gaze squarely. "She loved you once. She can love you again. You just need to put in the effort."

His voice turned commanding.

"As long as you both remarry, everything will be resolved."

A union between Sterling Corporation and Blackwood Corporation would be unstoppable.

The perfect alliance.

The ideal outcome.

Nathan’s expression darkened. He lifted his eyes to his grandfather.

"She won’t agree to a marriage of convenience."

Especially not with me.
###Chapter 172 Marry Another Person

If Evelyn Sinclair had ever considered a marriage of convenience, she wouldn't have hidden her true identity all these years. What she sought was far more than just a contractual union.

Old Master Blackwood scoffed bitterly. "Would you stand by and watch her marry someone else? Think of what our family stands to lose!" His wrinkled fingers tightened around his cane. "There's no better match for Evelyn than you, Nathan."

No matter who Evelyn chose in the future, the Blackwood name would become a laughingstock. The damage to their reputation would be irreparable.

Though Old Master Blackwood didn't particularly like Evelyn, he couldn't ignore the immense power and influence of the Sterling family behind her.

Nathan's expression darkened at his grandfather's words. The mere thought of Evelyn with another man made his jaw clench involuntarily. He'd never allowed himself to consider that possibility.

Even with countless suitors surrounding Evelyn, Nathan had always assumed she wouldn't seriously entertain any of them. But what if she did? The thought sent an unfamiliar pang through his chest.

"Unacceptable," Nathan growled through gritted teeth.

Old Master Blackwood studied his grandson with piercing eyes. "If Evelyn refuses to reconcile with you, we must arrange another advantageous marriage. Someone from a family that can rival the Sterlings."

Only then could they counter the Sterling family's growing influence. Nathan's entire body tensed, his knuckles turning white with suppressed anger.

The suggestion filled him with visceral disgust. His gaze turned glacial as he met his grandfather's stare. "I don't need an arranged marriage."

"This isn't your decision to make—"

"I'll handle my affairs with the Sterlings myself." Nathan cut him off sharply, already turning toward the door. His relationship with Evelyn was complicated enough without introducing another woman into the mix.

Sophia Blackwood waited downstairs, anticipating fireworks. But after the initial sound of shattering glass, the study had fallen eerily quiet.

She jumped when Nathan suddenly appeared at the staircase. "Brother! That witch Evelyn is nothing but trouble," Sophia blurted. "She's the reason grandfather's angry, isn't she? You shouldn't—"

Nathan's dangerous glare silenced her mid-sentence. "How many times must I warn you, Sophia? Stay away from Evelyn." His voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "Apparently my warnings mean nothing to you."

Sophia paled, shrinking back against the wall. "I-I didn't—"

"Did you ever apologize like I ordered?" Nathan's question hung in the air like a guillotine.

Sophia's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.

One last withering look from Nathan sealed her fate. "One more transgression against Evelyn, and you'll find yourself disowned." The threat left no room for negotiation.

As Nathan strode out of Aspen Lodge, Sophia remained frozen, a cold sweat breaking across her brow.

Inside his car, Nathan replayed his grandfather's words. The image of Evelyn in another man's arms made his stomach churn. An invisible weight pressed against his chest, making each breath feel labored.

Before he realized what he was doing, his fingers had dialed Evelyn's number. The word "Wife" still displayed on his screen—a relic from happier times. To his relief, the call connected. She hadn't blocked him again.

That small mercy eased some of the tension in his shoulders.

Evelyn answered after three rings, her voice thick with sleep. "Hello?"

No trace of their usual animosity colored her tone. For a fleeting moment, it felt like old times.

"It's me," Nathan said quietly.

The change was instantaneous. Evelyn's voice turned to ice. "Have you calculated the repair costs? Just tell me how much I owe you." Her eagerness to sever all ties cut deeper than he expected.

Nathan's grip tightened on the phone. "Wrong number," he lied smoothly. "My apologies."

He heard her sharp intake of breath before she hissed, "You absolute lunatic!" The line went dead.

Nathan stared at his phone, an unexpected chuckle escaping his lips. Only Evelyn could hang up on him and leave him smiling.

The mighty CEO of Blackwood Corporation, reduced to finding amusement in being dismissed by a woman. The business world would never believe it.
###Chapter 173 Make It Happen.

Morning light streamed through Evelyn's penthouse windows as she prepared for work.

With Kingsley Tech's project running smoothly, she turned her attention to a new real estate venture.

Checking social media, she found netizens divided between shipping her with Lucas Sterling or Julian Moreau.

A minority paired her with Nathan, trailing far behind.

Evelyn laughed. "At least the public knows Nathan and I don't belong together!"

Bennett hesitated. "Should we remove these posts?"

"No harm in letting them play," Evelyn said. "It's not like I'll date whoever wins this silly poll."

She couldn't possibly date Lucas - revealing their sibling relationship would cause chaos!

Meanwhile at Blackwood Enterprises...

Harrison watched incredulously as his boss obsessed over gossip during work hours.

Nathan scowled at the polls. "How do these nobodies rank higher than me? The public's taste is trash!"

He slammed his tablet down.

Harrison ventured, "Should we remove this nonsense?"

Nathan's glare could kill. "Ensure Blackwood's reputation isn't eclipsed by those amateurs. Understood?"

Harrison blinked. "You want... to boost your pairing with Ms. Sinclair?"

Nathan signed a document without looking up. "Make it happen."

Within hours, the "Nathan-Evelyn" pairing skyrocketed past the others.

In Evelyn's group chat:

[Isabella Montgomery: Insider says Blackwood bought those trending spots! Is Nathan insane?]
[Natalie Beaumont: Wow... just wow...]
[Sebastian Hart: Why isn't MY name there??]

[Evelyn Sinclair: He's definitely lost it.]

Evelyn immediately called Bennett. "Take it down. Double whatever Nathan paid."

The polls vanished instantly.

When informed, Nathan simply said, "Good."
###Chapter 174 Make Another Appointment

Evelyn Sinclair had a mountain of work piling up on her desk.

The Pacific Heights Project was hitting unexpected roadblocks.

Maxwell Thornton, their primary developer, had suddenly backed out of their agreed-upon price at the eleventh hour.

He demanded a 30% increase on top of their original deal. Naturally, Evelyn refused. This project was Sterling Corporation’s crown jewel in real estate—failure wasn’t an option.

Her negotiation team returned empty-handed. Maxwell remained stubborn, unwilling to budge.

Every day of delay cost Sterling Corp millions. With Alexander Sterling overseas for inspections, the burden fell squarely on Evelyn’s shoulders.

Flipping through past meeting notes, Evelyn frowned. Something didn’t add up.

Why the sudden shift in attitude?

Bennett, standing nearby, cleared his throat. "I did some digging."

"Apparently, someone approached Maxwell—promised him better deals and higher commissions."

"He’s using this as leverage to squeeze more out of us."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled. "Who?"

Bennett shook his head. "He’s keeping that close to his chest."

Finding another developer overseas would be costly and time-consuming. They were stuck dealing with Maxwell.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Set up a meeting."

She wouldn’t let anyone manipulate her.

Bennett nodded. "Right away."

Maxwell accepted the invitation almost instantly—as if he’d been waiting for it.

Evelyn arrived precisely on time. Maxwell, however, strolled in fifteen minutes late.

Her patience was already thin. His smug smirk as he apologized only made it worse.

"Apologies, Ms. Sterling. Got held up."

Evelyn’s lips curved into a cold smile. "Since you’re so busy, Mr. Thornton, we’ll reschedule."

She rose, signaling Bennett to follow.

Maxwell’s confidence faltered. He scrambled to stop her. "Wait—let’s talk properly. My fault for being late."

Evelyn paused, her gaze icy.

"Let’s be clear, Mr. Thornton. Sterling Corp won’t meet your demands. We value integrity. Without it, there’s no partnership."

Maxwell’s expression darkened. He leaned forward, dropping his trump card.

"Another investor offered 30% more. Match it, and I’ll stick with you."

He expected her to cave. Women, in his experience, folded under pressure.

Evelyn merely laughed.

"Then by all means, take their offer. Best of luck."

She turned on her heel.

If this mystery investor truly existed, why was Maxwell still negotiating? Evelyn wasn’t buying it.

But she was curious who was pulling his strings.

At the door, she glanced at Bennett. "Follow him."

An hour later, her phone buzzed.

Bennett’s voice was tense. "President, Maxwell just met with Reginald Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood at the Aurora Club."

Silence.

Then—

"Interesting."
###Chapter 175 Hollywood Heartthrob

After a brief pause, Evelyn's composed voice responded through the phone, "Understood."

"Do something for me. Sinclair Group isn't the powerhouse it once was."

Their golden era had passed, leaving them barely clinging to relevance. Yet despite their decline, they still commanded respect and remained superior to many competitors.

Evelyn never imagined Nathan Blackwood's mysterious backer would be Sinclair Group. So Preston Sinclair was involved after all.

That evening, Natalie extended an invitation to an exclusive gala, which Evelyn accepted as promised.

In a somber mood, Evelyn perched at the bar, nursing her drink in solitude.

Her striking beauty made invisibility impossible - those endless legs, that willowy waist, every movement like poetry in motion.

No one noticed the discreet photo snapped and sent to a particular recipient. When Nathan checked his buzzing phone, Tristan's name flashed on the screen.

He answered impatiently. "What now?" Tristan chuckled. "I told you to come tonight, but you refused. Guess who's here?" His teasing tone only fueled Nathan's irritation. "Spit it out."

Tristan sighed dramatically. "No sense of fun. Check your messages." Nathan hung up and opened the image.

Evelyn sat bathed in golden light, nearly merging with the glow. The photo's dreamy quality lent an ethereal aura. Her crossed legs formed perfect angles as she absently swirled her wineglass, those delicate features lethally alluring.

Regal yet untouchable, she radiated intoxicating magnetism without even trying. Nathan's jaw tightened as he grabbed his jacket and left.

Slightly buzzed, Evelyn decided to depart. Until an unfamiliar voice called out nearby.

She froze mid-step and glanced sideways.

No recognition. She continued walking. The stranger stormed over, furious. "Evelyn Sinclair! Are you ignoring me?"

Evelyn assessed the woman - all arrogance and mediocre looks. A faint smirk played on her lips. "Should I know you?"

The dismissal ignited the woman's temper. "I'm Yuna Takahashi, heiress to Takashi Holdings. I just debuted in Montecito's entertainment scene! Over 300,000 fans already!"

Montecito's entertainment industry proved far more lucrative than Korea's, prompting Yuna's career shift. She'd skyrocketed after a talent show breakthrough.

Yuna had heard about Evelyn from Penelope Sinclair, whose family's business ties with Takashi Holdings forged their friendship.

When Penelope learned of Yuna's celebrity aspirations, she'd eagerly facilitated introductions to influential directors, promising industry access.

Most enticingly, Penelope vowed to introduce Yuna to Lucas Sterling - not just Montecito's darling, but Korea's beloved idol. Yuna had specifically debuted here to get closer to him.

Yet upon arrival, she discovered Lucas entangled with this divorcee. Deciding to teach Evelyn a lesson would simultaneously please Penelope.

Evelyn studied Yuna with genuine confusion. "Never heard of you." Though fluent in English, Yuna might as well have been speaking another language for all Evelyn cared.

"How dare you!" Yuna's lip trembled with humiliation. She forced composure. "Ms. Sterling, given your... reputation, it's understandable you wouldn't know me."

"But let me make one thing clear-"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Few dared address her this way. This rookie had audacity.

"Oh?"

"I don't care about your family's wealth or your... appetites. But keep Lucas Sterling out of your messy life. You're beneath him."

So this was about Lucas? Evelyn frowned. "Not your concern."

"Who says it's not? He's disgusted by women like you!" Evelyn's light laugh held no warmth. "Did he tell you that himself?"

"Obviously! He's only tolerating you because of that ridiculous shipping nonsense." Yuna's teeth ground together. "If you had any decency, you'd deny those scandalous rumors instead of leeching off his fame!"

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial. "Is that so? I'll have to verify that." She pulled out her phone. "Lucas, I'm drunk. Pick me up. And bring flats." She hung up without waiting.

Yuna sneered. "Pathetic act. You didn't even dial, did you? As if Lucas Sterling comes running at your beck and call! Know your place!"
###Chapter 176 Wealth and Influence

Evelyn Sinclair cast a disdainful glance at Yuna Takahashi, her patience wearing dangerously thin.

"How irritating! Yuna, what exactly are you two discussing?" A woman approached from nearby.

Dressed in an opulent designer gown, she carried herself with practiced elegance. The professional smile plastered across her face looked painfully artificial. Evelyn studied her features, a faint frown creasing her brow. There was something vaguely familiar about her.

Yuna snorted coldly before linking arms with the newcomer. With a smug tilt of her chin, she announced, "Evelyn, surely you recognize her? This is Penelope Sinclair, daughter of Sinclair Group's chairman and the award-winning Hollywood actress!"

Recognition flickered in Evelyn's eyes.

Ah yes. That overrated celebrity who clawed her way to fame through reality TV and carefully crafted public image rather than actual acting talent. But Evelyn's attention snagged on the more relevant detail.

Daughter of Sinclair Group's chairman? The alcohol haze cleared from Evelyn's mind instantly.

So that's her other identity.

"Hello, Ms. Sterling," Penelope offered a saccharine smile, extending her hand.

Evelyn gave a curt nod, making no move to shake it. Her mood had soured considerably, and social niceties held no appeal at the moment.

Besides, anyone chummy with Yuna couldn't be worth knowing. Evelyn's lips curled slightly.

"Big movie star, hm?"

Penelope smoothly withdrew her unshaken hand, maintaining her composure. "Ms. Sterling, please don't mind her. Yuna's recently arrived from Korea as the heiress to Takashi Holdings. She's still adjusting to Montecito's social scene." She turned to Yuna with an indulgent smile. "No need to announce my background everywhere. I prefer people judge me on my own merits."

Yuna gazed at Penelope with starry-eyed admiration before shooting Evelyn a venomous glare. "Of course Penelope's different from some people. She's just too honest sometimes - means no harm by it."

Evelyn's cold laugh sliced through the air. "Being honest doesn't excuse poor manners. And it certainly doesn't indicate good intentions."

What a blindly devoted fool, Evelyn thought. The real malice here clearly came from Penelope.

Yuna's recent arrival explained her ignorance about Evelyn's background. But Penelope? She knew exactly who Evelyn was. The omission to her dear friend was undoubtedly deliberate.

Yuna's face flushed with anger, eager to wipe the smirk off Evelyn's face. "Why so arrogant, Evelyn? Penelope isn't just an actress - she's Nathan Blackwood's childhood sweetheart. Sinclair Group will soon merge with Blackwood Enterprises through their marriage alliance. You don't stand a chance!"

"We're not formally engaged yet," Penelope demurred, though her coy glance at Evelyn confirmed the truth of Yuna's words.

"Marriage alliance?" Evelyn's lips twitched with amusement. Now their boldness made sense. No wonder Bennett had spotted Maxwell Thornton with Sinclair Group's chairman and Nathan earlier.

"It's practically confirmed anyway," Yuna sneered. "Blackwood Enterprises dominates the industry while your family owns what? Some insignificant company? You're hardly worthy of Nathan Blackwood. But Penelope will soon be Mrs. Blackwood. Then we'll see who dares cross her!"

She lifted her chin, waiting for Evelyn's reaction. "I know you've been buying those trending topics to boost your image. Do you really think you're so special? Shamelessly pairing yourself with Mr. Blackwood and Lucas. The audacity!"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously just as Natalie Beaumont arrived.

"Which bitch reeks of desperation here?" Natalie's blunt words made both women pale. They recognized the fashion mogul instantly - offending her would be career suicide. Even Yuna knew no Korean celebrity had ever secured an invite to Natalie's exclusive shows.

"Ms. Beaumont, this is all a misunderstanding—" Penelope began.

"So she's your bitch?" Natalie cut her off. "Keep her on a leash then!"

"She's foreign, still learning our customs—"

"A foreign bitch? Then train her better!" Natalie snapped. "Teach her some manners first."

Penelope floundered, unwilling to risk her polished image by defending Yuna too vigorously. The cost outweighed any loyalty.

Yuna's face burned crimson, ready to retort when she spotted movement in the crowd.

Lucas! Her jaw dropped. His sculpted features seemed divinely crafted. He approached with casual elegance, his gaze fixed solely on Evelyn.

"My lady, how much have you had to drink?" Lucas ignored everyone else. His eyes dropped to her heels, concern flickering across his face as he knelt before her.

From his bag, he produced the latest Lumière sneakers, gently cradling Evelyn's ankle to change her shoes in full view of the stunned onlookers.

Yuna's face drained of color.

How could Lucas Sterling - international superstar - debase himself like this for Evelyn?

Evelyn caught Yuna's shocked expression. "Lucas," she said lightly, "I hear you've been badmouthing me?"

"Hmm?" Lucas remained focused on his task, as if nothing mattered more than ensuring her comfort. He carefully smoothed the fabric around her heel to prevent any friction before finally satisfied.

The intimate scene unfolded before dozens of watching eyes - including Nathan Blackwood's, who had just arrived, his expression darkening at the sight.
###Chapter 177 You're His Mistress

Tristan Whitmore scoffed silently. Evelyn Sinclair truly had no idea the storm she was stirring, did she? Since her divorce from Nathan, she'd become completely unrestrained.

Before Evelyn could respond, Yuna Takahashi stepped forward aggressively. Her eyes burned with misplaced righteousness as she confronted Lucas Sterling.

"Lucas, you need to tell everyone the truth right now. Did Evelyn force you into this? Is she blackmailing you?" Yuna's voice trembled as she spat out the next words. "Are you...her kept man? Is that why you're always by her side?"

She continued passionately, "Don't be afraid! Just admit it and we'll help you. We'll get you away from Evelyn's clutches!" The way Yuna spoke made Evelyn sound like some kind of predatory monster.

Lucas' posture went rigid. A dangerous smirk curled his lips as he rose to his full height, his gaze scorching as it landed on Yuna.

"Who the hell do you think you are?" His voice was glacial. "Are you mentally ill? If so, go home and take your medication. Don't bring your delusions here."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, exchanging an amused glance with Natalie Beaumont. Both women were thoroughly enjoying this rare spectacle - seeing the normally composed Lucas lose his temper.

Being called a male mistress? That was the ultimate insult to Lucas Sterling. Yuna visibly deflated under her idol's scathing words, her earlier bravado completely evaporated.

Penelope Sinclair quickly pulled Yuna back, offering an apologetic smile. "Lucas, please don't be angry. Yuna's new to Montecito's social scene. She's just concerned about you."

Lucas' cold gaze shifted to Penelope. "And you are...?" Penelope's face froze. The humiliation burned - she'd won film awards, considered herself an A-list celebrity, yet this international superstar didn't even recognize her.

The implication was clear: her work wasn't memorable enough to warrant Lucas' attention. She paled in comparison to his global fame.

Penelope had intended to use Yuna to knock Evelyn down a peg, but instead found herself dragged into the mud. Her cheeks burned as she desperately scanned the crowd, her eyes landing on the imposing figure of Nathan Blackwood.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Penelope brightened, stepping toward him like he was her salvation. "You're here!"

Tristan nudged Nathan, noting his thunderous expression. "You know Penelope Sinclair?" The question drew everyone's attention to Nathan.

His response was icy. "No." His gaze didn't linger on Penelope for even a second, remaining fixed on Evelyn's radiant face instead.

Evelyn shone like the sun - her beauty effortless, her poise regal. She commanded attention wherever she went. The so-called superstar Penelope couldn't hold a candle to her in any aspect.

Seeing how Evelyn had blossomed since their divorce stirred complicated, unpleasant emotions in Nathan's chest.

The awkward silence stretched until Evelyn finally broke it with an amused chuckle. "Mr. Blackwood, you don't even recognize your own fiancée? How interesting." She cast a meaningful look at Penelope. "After all the bragging she and Yuna did earlier, denying it now would just make them look foolish."

Lucas couldn't resist adding fuel to the fire. "Ah, so that explains the audacity. Mr. Blackwood's fiancée, is it?" His tone dripped with sarcasm.

Nathan's expression darkened. "What fiancée?" His deep voice cut through the room. "Since when do I have a fiancée I know nothing about?"

All eyes turned to Penelope. Would a celebrity of her stature lie about something like this? She stood frozen, humiliation washing over her in waves.

Her father had been negotiating a marriage alliance with the Blackwoods, and the families had grown closer recently. She'd assumed the arrangement was mutual, had even fantasized about the status boost marrying Nathan would bring.

Never had she imagined Nathan himself would be completely unaware.

Nathan strode forward, his intense gaze never leaving Evelyn. "Evelyn," his voice was dangerously low, "since when do I have a fiancée? And more importantly - what exactly is your relationship with Lucas?"

The easy camaraderie between Evelyn and Lucas, the way Lucas doted on her - it all grated on Nathan's nerves.

Evelyn's cool gaze swept from Nathan to Penelope and Yuna, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "You'll have to ask Ms. Sinclair and her dear friend about that."
###Chapter 178 You Got Dumped

Evelyn was still reeling from Lucas's sudden outburst, her mind struggling to catch up.

When Natalie spoke, she blinked, dazed.

All eyes were on her.

The silence was suffocating, thick with tension. Even someone oblivious would sense something was off.

"Penelope told me about their engagement. She even showed me a photo of her father with Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said, turning to Penelope for support.

But Penelope only glanced at Nathan Blackwood, who remained silent, unmoved.

He didn’t intervene as Natalie questioned her in front of everyone.

This wasn’t a room full of gossip reporters.

Their judgmental stares were humiliation enough.

Penelope bit her lip, scrambling for an excuse.

"Maybe it was just a misunderstanding between our families. A joke taken too seriously. Please don’t think much of it, Ms. Montgomery and Mr. Blackwood."

Lucas scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain.

"So, it was all a lie? People really have the audacity to fake engagements now? Standards for liars have truly plummeted."

Penelope paled.

As a public figure, this scandal could ruin her. Before she could defend herself, Natalie yawned.

Lucas immediately took her purse, slinging an arm around her shoulders.

"Let’s go home. These people aren’t worth our time."

Natalie nodded, glancing at Isabella.

"Coming?"

"Obviously." Isabella grabbed her things, following them out.

Once they left, Penelope rushed to Nathan, desperation in her voice.

"Mr. Blackwood, I only mentioned the engagement because my family brought it up. I was waiting for confirmation—"

Nathan cut her off coldly.

"There is no engagement. Don’t delude yourself."

His words were a bucket of ice water, dousing her fantasies.

It would never happen.

Penelope’s face drained of color as Nathan strode after Evelyn without a backward glance.

"Evelyn!"

Penelope clenched her fists, forcing a laugh.

"Honestly, I’m relieved. My career is booming—directors are lining up for me. The engagement pressure was suffocating. Now I don’t have to worry about offending Mr. Blackwood."

Tristan smirked at her pathetic attempt to save face but said nothing, turning to leave.

Nathan caught up just as Evelyn slid into Lucas’s passenger seat.

"I’ll take you home," he said stiffly, glaring at Lucas.

Evelyn didn’t even look at him.

"No need."

"I want to discuss the car repairs," Nathan pressed.

Evelyn rested her head against the window, the cool breeze clearing her mind.

"Just send me the bill. I’ll buy you a new one."

That would end this ridiculous back-and-forth.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

"I don’t want a new car. I want that one fixed."

Evelyn laughed dryly.

"Then name your price."

Nathan hesitated.

Once he did, he’d have no reason to see her again.

Lucas honked impatiently, smirking.

"Mr. Blackwood, you got dumped. Stop making a scene."

Nathan’s gaze turned glacial.

He hadn’t forgotten finding Lucas half-naked in Evelyn’s apartment. The memory burned.

"Stay out of this, Lucas," he warned, voice dangerously low.

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

"Just email me the invoice."

She turned to Lucas.

"Drive."

Lucas winked.

"Your wish is my command."

They sped off, leaving Nathan standing in the cold.
###Chapter 179 The Defamed One

The car ride was uncomfortably silent until Natalie finally spoke up. "Lil N, Nathan Blackwood's behavior was rather peculiar today, don't you think?"

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, recalling Nathan's words to Dominic Kingsley that night. "You think he has feelings for me? Please."

"How else would Penelope Sinclair dare claim to be Nathan's fiancée? That marriage alliance rumor didn't come from nowhere," Natalie frowned, twisting her designer bracelet nervously.

"But would the Blackwoods really need an alliance with Sinclair Group?"

"Who cares," Lucas muttered darkly. After dropping Natalie off, he drove Evelyn back to Sterling Manor.

The next morning, Evelyn was jolted awake by raised voices downstairs. Rubbing sleep from her eyes, she descended to find William Sterling berating Lucas with enough volume to shake the chandeliers.

"You absolute disgrace! Even Leo has more sense than you! Look what you've dragged your sister into!" William thrust the morning paper at them.

The headline screamed: Lucas Sterling - Evelyn's Secret Toyboy! Scandalous Affair Between CEO and Star Actor! Hollywood Royalty's Shocking Fall From Grace!

Alexander's expression was murderous. "See what happens when you insist on this acting nonsense? No one would care about you if not for your ridiculous career!"

Lucas slumped on the sofa, pounding the armrest dramatically. "Father dearest, I'm the victim here! Why am I being scolded when I'm the one being slandered?"

"You involved your sister in your mess and dare talk back?" William's glare could have frozen lava.

Evelyn sighed. "At this point, the fastest way to end this is to publicly confirm Lucas's real identity."

William grimaced. "But he bought those acting awards! The embarrassment—"

Evelyn and Lucas exchanged exasperated looks. "I earned those awards through talent!" Lucas wanted to scream. The revelation of his place in the Sterling hierarchy stung - revered by the public, yet considered a family disgrace.

Meanwhile at Celestial Media, Yuna Takahashi watched the growing scandal with increasing anxiety. She'd only wanted to tarnish Evelyn's reputation and drive Lucas away from her.

"Penelope, what if this backfires on Lucas? I never meant—"

Penelope patted her hand reassuringly. "The media outlet is ours. They'll focus on Evelyn, not Lucas. We're saving him from that gold-digger's clutches."

They'd leaked photos of Lucas kneeling to fasten Evelyn's shoes at last week's gala - a humiliating image that sparked outrage.

[How dare she treat our Lucas like a servant!]
[Who does Evelyn Sinclair think she is? The Queen of England?]
[At least our Julian Moreau has self-respect!]

But Penelope's triumph lasted barely two hours before Sterling Corporation dropped their bombshell statement:

Lucas Sterling is the eldest son of William Sterling and brother to CEO Evelyn Sterling. Any suggestion of impropriety between them is false and defamatory.

Evelyn shared the announcement with the caption: Proud of my superstar brother! Lucas instantly reposted: Proud of my genius CEO sister!

The internet exploded. Servers crashed under the weight of shocked reactions:

[Lucas Sterling is a Sterling heir?! Mind blown!]
[This sibling duo is everything! #FamilyGoals]
[The Sterlings have it all - Alexander the business titan, Lucas the A-list actor, Evelyn the tech genius. How do I get reborn into this family?]
[So brothers can't help sisters with shoes now? Get a life, haters!]
[Ship officially sunk. Julian Moreau stans, assemble!]
[The way the Sterling brothers support Evelyn's leadership? Obsessed with this power family!]
###Chapter 180 I Can't Get Arrested

Blackwood Enterprises.

Nathan Blackwood stared at the trending gossip online, his brows knitted tightly together.

Even Harrison hadn't anticipated this twist.

Logically, Nathan should have been pleased—one less rival in the game. Yet, Harrison detected no trace of satisfaction on his boss's face.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan's expression darkened.

"I should have seen this coming. Lucas never had any scandals in the entertainment industry before. The only person he ever showed public affection toward was Evelyn."

His lips curled into a bitter smirk.

"Turns out Lucas is also William Sterling's son. If Evelyn and I hadn't divorced, he would've been my brother-in-law. What a surprise."

The realization eased some of the tension in his chest.

But then he remembered how coldly he had treated Lucas yesterday.

A pang of regret struck him.

If Harrison could read Nathan's thoughts, he would have choked on his coffee.

Nathan's voice dropped to an icy timbre. "What else?"

"Reginald Sinclair, Chairman of Sinclair Group, is here to see you. He says it's urgent."

"Let him in."

Harrison nodded and stepped out to escort the visitor in.

Despite being older than Nathan, Reginald Sinclair carried himself with cautious deference in the younger man's presence.

"Nathan, I came to discuss the Pacific Heights Project. Have you reconsidered?"

Securing that project would guarantee Sinclair Group's profits for an entire year.

Nathan remained impassive. "I've done my research. Sterling Corporation has been eyeing it for months."

A sly smile spread across Reginald's face as he adjusted his tie.

"Nathan, if you're willing to collaborate, I can guarantee we'll secure it. Consider it done. You won’t need to lift a finger."

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "Where does this confidence come from, Mr. Sinclair?"

Reginald hesitated. Clearly, Nathan wouldn’t bite without proof.

"I approached Maxwell Thornton, the developer behind this project. Sterling Corporation has been working with him, but I made him an offer he couldn’t refuse."

His eyes gleamed with triumph.

"Once Thornton pulls out, Sterling Corporation will have no choice but to abandon the project—or sell it at a loss."

He leaned forward, voice dripping with persuasion.

"Alexander Sterling is overseas. A woman like Evelyn won’t be able to hold Sterling Corporation together. This is your chance to strike back."

His tone turned venomous.

"Don’t forget how merciless she was when she dismantled your family’s reputation. Now’s the time to reclaim what’s yours."

The air around Nathan turned glacial.

Mistaking his silence for consideration, Reginald pressed on.

"If our companies join forces, no one else stands a chance."

He smirked.

"I believe Old Master Blackwood has already mentioned the marriage alliance—"

"Mr. Sinclair."

Nathan's voice cut through like a blade.

Reginald froze.

"You should know by now that whatever Old Master Blackwood says holds no weight with me."

The sheer disdain in Nathan's tone sent a chill down Reginald’s spine.

The ruthless authority in Nathan’s gaze left no room for argument. The fact that he openly dismissed his own grandfather’s influence in front of Reginald spoke volumes.

"The Blackwood family doesn’t need marriage alliances to survive."

Nathan’s words were laced with ice.

"I married Evelyn when she had nothing. The next matron of the Blackwood family will be whomever I choose."

His lips curled in contempt.

"And it will never be Penelope Sinclair."

Each syllable was a death knell to Reginald’s ambitions.

Old Master Blackwood had praised Penelope multiple times in Reginald’s presence, leading him to believe the alliance was all but guaranteed.

Now, Nathan had shattered that illusion with brutal clarity.

"Blackwood Enterprises will not be involved in the Pacific Heights Project. Proceed with your plans without us."

Nathan’s dismissal was final.

Reginald had expected to leave with a deal. Instead, he walked out empty-handed.

"Mr. Sinclair, this way." Harrison gestured politely.

Reginald’s face was taut with barely concealed frustration.

The moment he stepped outside, his phone rang.

"Dad!" Penelope’s panicked voice crackled through. "Sterling Corporation is suing me! You have to help—!"
###Chapter 181 Winning Is All That Matters

Reginald Sinclair's face twisted in shock.
What the hell?
I just... I only spread a minor rumor about Evelyn and Lucas online.

I never expected them to involve the authorities!
Father, fix this! Suppress the story!
Penelope can't be arrested—she's a star!

But Penelope Sinclair had already confessed everything.
She never anticipated Evelyn's ruthlessness.
Or that Lucas Sterling was Evelyn's brother.

Now she'd truly stirred up a hornet's nest.
Reginald's mind reeled in chaos.

Panic seized him.
He spun around, desperate to seek Nathan Blackwood's intervention.

Harrison blocked his path with a polite but firm hand.
"Mr. Sinclair, the CEO is in an international conference call."
His tone brooked no argument.

Defeated, Reginald stormed out.
He dialed Maxwell Thornton en route to Sterling Tower.

At this point, hiding their collusion no longer mattered.
He'd surrender the Pacific Heights Project if it meant freeing Penelope.

Yet when he arrived, Evelyn refused to see him.
Furious, Reginald paced Sterling Tower's lobby like a caged animal.

Maxwell looked bewildered.
"Thirty percent additional profits—we're just walking away?"

"Shut your mouth!"

They waited until dusk.
Finally, Evelyn emerged with Bennett at her side.

Reginald lunged forward.
"Ms. Sterling!"

She turned, cool as winter frost.
Though they'd never met, she recognized Maxwell instantly.

"Ah, Mr. Thornton."
Her gaze flicked to Reginald.
"Let me guess—HS Group's Chairman Sinclair?"

Reginald stiffened.
Her razor-sharp deduction unnerved him.
Suddenly, his bargaining position felt flimsy.

"Ms. Sterling, Penelope is my only child."
His voice cracked.
"She's a public figure—an arrest would ruin her."

Evelyn's lips curved like a honed blade.
"Then perhaps you should've taught your daughter consequences."
"Celebrities should exemplify integrity, don't you think?"

This scandal would end Penelope's career.
Brand her forever.

Evelyn couldn't care less.

"Wait!" Reginald begged.
"I'll withdraw from Pacific Heights entirely!"
"Send the developers back—original terms stand!"

Her laugh was glacial.
"Are you implying I should thank you for not sabotaging my project?"

Reginald straightened his tie with false dignity.
"The business world is brutal, Ms. Sterling."
"Victory justifies all means."

Evelyn's smile turned lethal.
"Exactly."
"Which is why I'm holding you both accountable."

Maxwell paled.
Reginald gaped.

"Did you truly believe," Evelyn purred, "this project hinged on Maxwell?"
"His deputy has coveted his position for years."

She let the revelation hang between them.
"The man gladly offered me a ten percent discount."

Reginald's knees nearly buckled.
Maxwell looked ready to vomit.

Evelyn tilted her head.
"Brutal world, isn't it, gentlemen?"
"Winning really is everything."

Bennett already held the car door open.
As Evelyn slid inside, Maxwell clawed at the window.

"Twenty percent discount! No—thirty!"
He'd work for free if she demanded it.

But the tinted window rose without hesitation.
The engine purred to life.

Evelyn didn't glance back.
Fools should've considered consequences before crossing her.
###Chapter 182 She Bought You a Present

The scandal surrounding Penelope Sinclair exploded across social media within hours.

No one could believe the usually poised A-list actress would stoop to such desperate measures.

What infuriated the public most was how Penelope had tried manipulating them. The backlash was brutal.

Netizens reveled in her downfall as sponsorships evaporated overnight. Breach of contract penalties piled up.

With no way to salvage her reputation, Penelope had no choice but to issue a public apology.

She posted a tearful video announcing her retirement from Hollywood to focus on the Sinclair family business.

The internet immediately dug into her privileged upbringing, uncovering more scandals. Evelyn was surprised by how quickly Penelope folded.

It was a smart tactical retreat - preserving some dignity before completely burning her fanbase. Meanwhile, Sebastian Hart's birthday approached.

Every year, Natalie and Isabella would compete to find the most extravagant gift for the dashing bachelor. Evelyn never stressed - Sebastian adored anything from her.

Isabella dragged Evelyn through Montecito's luxury district, though she spent more time shopping for herself than gift hunting.

After having her purchases delivered, Isabella resumed her half-hearted search while Evelyn spotted something perfect.

A rare Patek Philippe caught her eye - outrageously expensive yet understatedly elegant. Perfect for Sebastian's refined tastes.

Fate intervened when they bumped into Sophia Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore in the boutique. The awkward tension was palpable.

"Evelyn, fancy seeing you here," Tristan offered nervously. Ever since his humiliating apology, he'd been walking on eggshells around her.

"Obviously," Isabella scoffed. She enjoyed watching Tristan squirm, knowing Evelyn still held compromising photos over him.

Sophia crossed her arms, her face twisting in displeasure at the sight of Evelyn. "What are you doing here?"

"Is this boutique suddenly Blackwood property?" Isabella shot back. Evelyn ignored them, pointing to the watch.

"I'll take this one." She didn't even glance at the price tag.

"Wait! That's ours!" Sophia blurted. Tristan tried silencing her but it was too late.

"First come, first served, Ms. Blackwood," Evelyn said coolly, her piercing gaze making Sophia shrink back.

Sophia's eyes narrowed as realization struck. "Are you... buying a birthday gift for my brother?" The air grew thick with tension.

Tristan's head snapped up. Of course - the timing made perfect sense. Why else would Evelyn be shopping for men's watches?

Evelyn froze momentarily. The mention reminded her that Nathan and Sebastian's birthdays were consecutive. Had she really only remembered Sebastian's?

A satisfied smirk tugged at her lips.

Sophia took this as confirmation and seized the opportunity to taunt her. "Don't waste your time. Nathan won't invite you to his party. Just hand it over."

Tristan yanked Sophia back. "Shut up!" Previous years Nathan might have excluded Evelyn, but this year was different.

Evelyn turned slowly, her icy smile sending chills down Sophia's spine. "You want it? That's exactly why I'm buying it. Because I despise you."

With a dismissive flick of her wrist, she handed over her black card. Isabella smirked at Sophia's outrage.

"Don't embarrass yourself, Sophia. Why would Evelyn waste time buying gifts for Nathan Blackwood?"

As they left, Sophia was still fuming. That Patek Philippe was Montecito's last available piece, snatched away by Evelyn.

Tristan immediately called Nathan from a corner. "Blackwood! Guess what? Evelyn just bought your birthday present!"

The phone nearly slipped from Nathan's suddenly unsteady hands. This changed everything.
###Chapter 183 The Ring She Gave Him

"It's absolutely true!" Sophia Blackwood couldn't contain her excitement. "Evelyn purchased that exact Patek Philippe you've been eyeing. Just wait for your surprise, Nathan!" Tristan Whitmore burst into laughter as he shared the news with Nathan Blackwood.

The revelation sent an unexpected jolt through Nathan's system. He struggled to maintain his composure, forcing down the sudden warmth spreading through his chest.

His voice dropped an octave as he responded, "Fine. I'm ending this call." Nathan hadn't planned any birthday celebrations this year.

Yet now, an extravagant party seemed necessary - if only to secure Evelyn's presence. Previous birthdays had been quiet affairs with only his closest friends.

Memories surfaced of Evelyn's hopeful expressions before their divorce, her subtle hints about celebrating together. He'd always brushed her off, preferring distance between them.

Still, she'd never missed giving him gifts. The realization made Nathan abruptly call Harrison. "Where are my past birthday presents?" The sudden demand startled his assistant.

"Sir, the valuable ones are in the safe or displayed in your collection room." Panic gripped Nathan as he realized he couldn't recall any of Evelyn's gifts from their three years together.

"Specifically Evelyn's." Harrison hesitated before cautiously asking, "Which year are you referring to, sir?"

"All of them." Nathan's tone turned glacial.

Harrison cleared his throat nervously before delivering the blows. "First year, Ms. Sinclair gifted you a custom ring, but...you misplaced it." His voice dropped to a whisper.

Nathan's face drained of color. A sharp pain lanced through his chest as the memory resurfaced. He'd never bothered with wedding rings, considering them unnecessary formalities.

Yet Evelyn had bought matching sets. He'd worn his for two days before carelessly stuffing it into a jacket pocket. Then it vanished.

Harrison continued hastily, "Second year, she handmade you a cashmere scarf, but you gave it to Vanessa Holloway, who discarded it immediately."

Before Nathan could process this, Harrison delivered the final blow. "Third year...she gave you nothing." The silence stretched unbearably.

Nathan felt like his ribs were cracking. The weight of his past indifference crushed him. He'd systematically destroyed her affection until she stopped trying altogether.

The lost ring. The discarded scarf. Things that meant nothing then now left him gasping for air. He couldn't bear to examine this wound further.

Flinging his phone aside, Nathan stormed into his walk-in closet like a man possessed. He tore through every jacket, searching pockets with desperate precision. Soon, an avalanche of designer clothing buried him.

The search proved futile. Years-old garments wouldn't remain in rotation. Housekeeping would have found any jewelry during regular cleanings.

The realization of his past neglect carved a hollow space beneath his sternum. That ring - Evelyn must have chosen it with such hope, such vulnerability.

And he'd lost it without a second thought.

Later, Nathan emerged from the wreckage and dialed Evelyn's number. Each ring sent his pulse skyrocketing.

"How much for the repairs?" Evelyn's curt greeting offered no pleasantries.

Nathan's heart threatened to break his ribs, yet his voice remained steady. "Evelyn, my birthday's tomorrow. You're coming to the party."

This marked the first time he'd personally invited anyone to his birthday. The silence stretched unbearably.

Then Evelyn's bitter laugh crackled through the line. "Mr. Blackwood, have you forgotten? We're not friends."
###Chapter 184 The Missing Date

Evelyn ended the call abruptly, leaving Nathan speechless.

That was her final answer. Why should his birthday matter to her? Nathan's chest tightened painfully.

Yet when he remembered Tristan's words about Evelyn purchasing a gift for him, hope flickered in his heart.

Perhaps she would come after all.

The thought lifted his spirits considerably. Evelyn had slept soundly despite Nathan's late-night call.

The rhythmic patter of rain had lulled her to sleep. Morning brought lingering clouds and crisp air as Evelyn stepped onto her balcony, inhaling deeply.

Her phone rang - Sebastian Hart calling. She answered immediately. "Happy birthday, Sebastian! May fortune favor you all your days!"

His laughter echoed through the line. "Little E, are you blessing your grandfather now?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Consider yourself lucky it's your birthday, or I'd have taught you some manners."

Switching to speakerphone, she began dressing. She selected a couture gown with iridescent gray-blue pearls, its limited-edition status evident in every stitch.

The mirror reflected effortless elegance. Strappy stilettos completed the look, elevating her regal presence.

"My Queen," Sebastian's voice teased through the phone, "what treasure have you procured for me? I've lost sleep wondering."

Evelyn arched a brow. "What are you lacking?"

"A girlfriend," he replied smoothly, his intention transparent. "I intend to court you properly."

"Denied," Evelyn stated flatly.

"My heart doesn't require permission," Sebastian countered. "This love flows through my veins and-"

Click. Evelyn terminated the call without hesitation. "Insufferable," she muttered, gathering her things for work.

Bennett arranged the morning meeting files on her desk, hesitating before speaking. "President Sinclair..."

"Yes?"

"Blackwood Enterprises sent an invitation... for Mr. Blackwood's birthday celebration." Bennett's voice dwindled to a whisper.

He couldn't fathom Nathan's audacity in expecting Evelyn's attendance. Their current relationship barely qualified as civil.

After a beat of silence, Evelyn's lips curved. "The man's delusional. Ignore it. Why should I grace his birthday? The arrogance!" Bennett exhaled in relief.

This reaction aligned perfectly with expectations. He crafted a polite refusal for Harrison, who delivered the message with visible discomfort.

"President, Ms. Sinclair's assistant conveyed Sterling Corporation's birthday wishes. There's... an urgent overseas project requiring her immediate attention. She's already departed."

Harrison paused, impressed despite himself. Evelyn's excuse was masterful.

"Understood." Nathan's voice dropped an octave, the words laced with quiet anguish. The rejection stung more than anticipated.

Of course she wouldn't come. Hadn't she made that clear yesterday? They weren't even acquaintances anymore.

Evening found Nathan brooding in a private club's corner while Tristan and friends transformed the venue into a celebration.

"Nothing but the best for President Blackwood!" The crowd's enthusiasm contrasted sharply with Nathan's mood. He nursed his drink, isolated amidst the revelry.

Tristan approached, clinking glasses. "Happy birthday, Nate." Nathan drained his glass without meeting his friend's gaze.

His eyes held oceanic depths of sorrow. "She's not coming." The words emerged frostbitten.

Tristan scrambled for reassurance, draping an arm around Nathan's shoulders. "She's probably just being cautious. Given your... complicated history."

"Maybe she'll send the gift tomorrow." Tristan felt certain of his theory.

Evelyn's past devotion suggested she'd know Nathan's preference for Patek Philippe watches. That expensive timepiece must be intended for him.

"Wait - is that Evelyn?" A voice cut through the chatter.
###Chapter 185 Salary Cut

Tristan and Nathan immediately rose from their seats when they heard the commotion. The grand entrance remained conspicuously empty.

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Tristan snapped at the messenger of false news. The man who'd shouted earlier flinched visibly.

Under Nathan's glacial stare, he forced a nervous smile and fumbled for his phone. "My friend just sent me footage of Evelyn playing poker. She's winning big—"

His words were cut short as Nathan snatched the device.

The video showed a lavish gathering around a high-stakes poker table. Instead of chips, the surface glittered with luxury car keys, diamond bracelets, and solid gold ingots. The intensity of the game was palpable.

This spectacle made Nathan's birthday gala seem dull by comparison. Every participant wore designer labels, but Evelyn in her custom gray-blue pearl-encrusted gown outshone them all.

She commanded the room effortlessly. Sebastian Hart and Natalie Beaumont flanked her like devoted attendants feeding cards to a queen. Evelyn herself simply sat there, radiant with triumph.

"Location," Nathan demanded, his voice arctic.

"The new Velvet Lounge," the man stammered.

Nathan's breathing turned ragged. So she hadn't left the country. No urgent business. She'd chosen poker over his birthday celebration.

Just then, Harrison happened to walk by. Nathan's gaze locked onto him like a predator sighting prey.

He tossed the phone back carelessly. "Consider your annual bonus revoked."

Harrison blinked in confusion. While the birthday festivities continued merrily without its host, no one understood why Nathan had stormed out. Unable to contain his fury, he drove straight to the Velvet Lounge.

By the time he arrived, Evelyn's party had already departed. Nathan returned to his car, his chest tight with unnamed emotions. The cigarette between his fingers burned steadily in the darkness, its ashes scattering like his composure.

Midnight brought countless birthday messages flooding his phone. None bore Evelyn's name.

Mr. Archibald knew Master Blackwood owned over twenty luxury vehicles. "Sir, is this new Porsche not the latest model? Has my father become frugal?"

The butler chuckled diplomatically. "Not at all. Young Master Lucas insisted no staff should drive the same model as him, so I selected this classic edition."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Since when do you take orders from him? Lucas always acts so childish!"

Mr. Archibald merely smiled, opening the car door with practiced grace. "Your carriage awaits, Miss Sterling."

The butler also carried gifts from William Sterling for the Hart family. Upon arrival, they found the manor swarming with celebrities and socialites, its understated elegance screaming wealth.

Evelyn caught her breath. This exceeded normal birthday party proportions. "It's just a birthday. Why is Sebastian making such a production?"

Mr. Archibald exited to open her door. "I believe Chairman Hart intends to use this occasion to find Second Young Master Hart a suitable match."

"Ah." Understanding dawned on Evelyn's face.

"Nikki!" Natalie waved energetically. Evelyn spotted her instantly and moved forward with a smile.

"Where is everyone?"

"Inside. I came out to fetch you." After bidding Mr. Archibald farewell, Evelyn linked arms with Natalie.

They'd barely taken three steps when a honeyed voice stopped them cold. "How fashionable, Ms. Sterling. Though your escorts do seem to be aging poorly."

Evelyn turned to see Yuna Takahashi, accompanied by that insufferable Penelope Sinclair from last time.

"Hmph."
###Chapter 186 She's Performing

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Ms. Takahashi?"

Yuna Takahashi lifted her chin arrogantly. "How surprising you remember me, Ms. Sinclair. I heard marriage alliances here only happen between families of equal status."

She smirked. "Was that wealthy businessman just now your match? Though he's not particularly handsome and rather old, I suppose he must be filthy rich."

"Otherwise, how could someone of his... caliber possibly match someone as refined as you, Ms. Sinclair?" Yuna hadn't been following the latest Montecito gossip online.

She remained blissfully unaware of Lucas's true identity. Penelope Sinclair had only called Yuna to complain about Evelyn's retaliation, prompting Yuna's angry confrontation.

Natalie moved to intervene but Evelyn stopped her with a subtle gesture. Evelyn's icy gaze locked onto Yuna. "Don't assume your foreign status protects you."

"Stay away from me. The sound of your voice makes me physically ill." Yuna's face twisted in outrage.

Humiliated, she brandished her phone in Evelyn's face. "I'll simply have someone trace that car's owner to expose your sugar daddy's identity."

"I recognize it's a classic Porsche worth about $10 million. My father drives the same model." Yuna sneered. "I'm sure everyone would love to know about Ms. Sinclair's marital arrangements, wouldn't they?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a frosty smile. "Are you attempting to blackmail me with this?"

Yuna mistook Evelyn's calm for fear. "Hmph! Just drop the charges against Penelope. She's kind-hearted - how could you destroy her acting career? You're utterly vicious!"

"She made her choices," Evelyn replied coolly. "No one forced her to commit those despicable acts."

Her dismissive glance made Yuna bristle. "Ms. Takahashi, you should worry about yourself." Evelyn turned to leave.

Yuna grabbed her arm. "Withdraw the lawsuit or I'll post those photos online! Everyone will know you're sleeping with some old man for money!" Nearby guests pricked up their ears.

Evelyn paused, her eyes glacial. Yuna flinched under her gaze. "Go ahead, Ms. Takahashi," Evelyn challenged.

"My butler isn't bothered by rumors. With four companies and a dozen luxury cars, he can handle whatever nonsense you spread."

Yuna froze. "A butler?!" The man who drove the same car as her father, owned multiple businesses, was merely a Sterling family employee?

The eavesdropping guests reevaluated Evelyn's status. Someone who casually spent $800 million in an afternoon wouldn't marry some random businessman. The Sterlings practically printed money! Yuna clearly understood nothing about true wealth.

"W-what does your family actually do?" Yuna stammered. "I thought it was just some small company! You have staff this wealthy?!"

Natalie suppressed a laugh. "Ms. Takahashi, since you're so close to Penelope, didn't she warn you about the Sterlings? How... disappointing for your friendship."

Evelyn gave Yuna a pitying look. "If you're so concerned about Penelope, why waste energy threatening me?"

"Why not take her place in prison? I'm sure she'd appreciate such loyalty." Evelyn's tone dripped with sarcasm.

Yuna paled. Their words filled her with sudden dread. Had Penelope lied to her? Her lips trembled.

Before she could respond, the Hart family butler arrived. "Ms. Sinclair! Master Reginald was just saying Mr. Sterling's gift is too extravagant for young Sebastian."

"The old man seems quite taken with it himself though." The butler's words shattered Yuna's remaining doubts.

So the "wealthy businessman" was merely Evelyn's servant. Her attempt to humiliate Evelyn had spectacularly backfired.

"That gift is for Reginald Hart. My father simply used Lucas as delivery boy," Evelyn clarified.

"Ms. Sinclair, Ms. Beaumont, this way please." The butler bowed respectfully.

As Evelyn turned to leave, she suddenly addressed Yuna. "Why are you here anyway?" As a newly debuted K-pop star, Yuna hardly qualified for Montecito high society.

Yuna blanched. The butler answered first. "Ah, she's here to perform. Her agency promised something... exotic."

"If you'd prefer different entertainment, we can replace her immediately." Yuna's agency had secured this prime opportunity - performing for Montecito's elite at the Hart gala.

Penelope had arranged this chance for Yuna to mingle with potential benefactors. But confronting Evelyn had been a catastrophic miscalculation.

Evelyn waved dismissively. "No need. Ms. Takahashi should be backstage preparing."

She fixed Yuna with a final glare. "Though performers who threaten guests with blackmail rarely get second bookings, do they?"
###Chapter 187 A Symphony of Chaos

The crowd gasped collectively. Evelyn wasn't the only one at risk here - every guest in attendance could become a target.

This was the Hart family's prestigious event. Any scandal would reflect poorly on their reputation.

The Hart family butler's expression turned stony. He snapped his fingers at two security personnel. "Escort her backstage immediately. Performers have no business mingling with guests."

Evelyn exchanged knowing glances with Natalie before following the butler inside. They paid their respects to Reginald Hart first before searching for their host.

Sebastian Hart was drowning in admirers when he spotted Evelyn. His face lit up like a Christmas tree. "Ah! The goddess has graced us with her presence! Now you peasants can see what real beauty looks like."

His friends groaned at his theatrics but fell silent when they saw Evelyn approaching.

She wore an emerald gown that made her glow like moonlight on water. Her chestnut waves cascaded effortlessly over bare shoulders.

Even in this sea of elites, Evelyn commanded attention effortlessly. Hearing the wolf whistles, she rolled her eyes and turned away.

Sebastian broke through the crowd like a man possessed. "Did Aphrodite herself descend from Olympus tonight?" Natalie fake-gagged and made her escape.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow dangerously. "Keep talking and I'll demonstrate how goddesses smite mortals."

Sebastian leaned in with a roguish grin. "But I only speak divine truths." His fingers playfully tugged at her dress sash.

Evelyn swatted him away, though to outside observers, their banter resembled lovers' teasing. Across the ballroom, a pair of stormy gray eyes tracked the emerald-clad figure.

The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees.

Tristan Whitmore wisely kept silent. The woman who supposedly had urgent business overseas - the same woman Nathan Blackwood had waited for all night - now glittered at Sebastian Hart's birthday gala.

Two parties. Twelve hours apart. Polar opposite atmospheres. The slap to Nathan's pride couldn't be louder if she'd physically struck him.

Tristan cleared his throat. "The Harts really go all out for birthdays, don't they? Almost vulgar with the extravagance."

For someone of Nathan's stature, merely attending was honor enough. That he'd come at all shocked Tristan.

Nathan's gaze remained fixed across the room. "Curiosity," he murmured. "Wondering who'd lower themselves to attend this circus."

Tristan nearly choked on his champagne.

Curiosity about whether Evelyn would show, more like. Since their divorce, she'd appeared with frustrating frequency. Suddenly, the stage erupted with pulsing music.

Spotlights crisscrossed as performers took the stage. The bass thumped through marble floors, drawing every eye.

The event planners knew their audience - the younger elite crowd ate up these pop performances.

Evelyn and Sebastian stood nearest the stage. The lead performer's face made Evelyn's breath catch - Yuna Takahashi, the Korean pop princess.

Yuna gyrated with manufactured sensuality, mimicking popular dance moves. Her stage persona bore zero resemblance to the vicious woman Evelyn knew.

"Fans actually buy this act?" Evelyn muttered as the decibel level climbed. She accepted a flute of champagne from a passing waiter.

Before she could comment further, warm hands covered her ears. Sebastian's breath tickled her neck. "This noise pollution isn't worthy of your ears, goddess."
###Chapter 188 Where Did You Find This Fool?

Evelyn instinctively glanced upward. Sebastian's words drew an involuntary chuckle from her lips. Two figures on the balcony observed the exchange with keen interest.

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. He set down his crystal tumbler with deliberate force and descended the grand staircase without hesitation. "Tristan! Control yourself!" Harrison called out urgently.

What else could explain Nathan's sudden movement? As fate would have it, the evening's musical performance chose that moment to conclude. The musicians took their bows to enthusiastic applause from the assembled guests.

Most performers exited stage left, but Yuna remained center stage.

Spotting Evelyn across the room, the Korean pop star flashed a calculated smile. Isabella immediately moved closer to her friend. "Is she planning something?" Evelyn merely shrugged with practiced nonchalance.

"If she's begging for humiliation, who are we to deny her?" Isabella arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow, reassured by Evelyn's composure. On stage, Yuna addressed the crowd. "Good evening everyone. I'm Yuna Takahashi, and I'm deeply honored to perform for Mr. Hart's birthday celebration."

Polite applause followed as Sebastian raised his glass in acknowledgment. The atmosphere remained cordial but restrained.

When silence returned, Yuna continued, "If I may be so bold, I'd like to invite Ms. Sterling to join me on stage."

"Ms. Sterling, would you honor us with a musical performance for our esteemed host?" Malice dripped from every syllable.

Yuna's resentment burned bright. So what if Evelyn came from money? The Takahashi family owned half of Seoul! Why should she kowtow to some American heiress? And the way Lucas Sterling doted on his sister... it made her sick.

Evelyn's lips curved into a dangerous smile as she regarded the scheming performer.

What gave this glorified karaoke singer the audacity to make such a request? Did she think Evelyn would embarrass herself? Or perhaps she expected a refusal that would make Evelyn appear arrogant?

Sebastian's pleasant expression froze. He gestured sharply to his butler. "Where the hell did you find this idiot?" The poor man turned ashen, sweat beading on his forehead.

If only he'd vetted the entertainment more thoroughly! Yuna pressed on. "Ms. Sterling, is performing beneath you? Or perhaps..." She feigned sudden realization. "Do you not play at all?"

Her mocking tone carried perfectly across the room. The faux sympathy in her eyes couldn't mask the glee dancing in their depths.

Sebastian muttered a curse. "Evelyn, ignore her-" He moved to intervene, but Evelyn caught his wrist.

Her sidelong glance at the stage would have frozen lava. After a quiet chuckle, she sipped her champagne and handed the flute to a passing waiter.

With effortless grace, she gathered her couture gown and ascended the stage. Under the brilliant lights, Evelyn's presence reduced Yuna to little more than a poorly dressed stagehand.

Evelyn stood bathed in spotlight, her flawless skin glowing with an almost ethereal radiance. The transformation from society heiress to celestial being was complete.

Yuna stiffened, mouth opening to speak, but Evelyn smoothly plucked the microphone from her grasp. The move was executed with elegant finality.

Evelyn's icy gaze swept over her rival. "You may leave now."

And with those words, Yuna Takahashi's career ended. Without another glance, Evelyn turned to the audience with a slight bow before gliding toward the grand piano.

A hushed anticipation fell over the crowd. No one had ever witnessed Evelyn Sterling perform publicly. Beyond the carefully curated press releases from Sterling Corporation, she remained an enigma.

Evelyn settled at the piano bench, her posture regal. When her fingers touched the keys, the opening notes of a reimagined Canon in D filled the hall.

Gasps rippled through the audience. Her interpretation blended technical perfection with raw emotion - not merely a rendition, but a revelation. The music became an extension of her soul, revealing resilience, passion, and quiet strength.

It was artistry of the highest order.

Evelyn at the piano became a living masterpiece, so captivating that time seemed suspended. The entire ballroom held its breath, unwilling to break the spell.

As the final notes faded, Evelyn rose with a knowing smile toward Isabella, who immediately produced an exquisitely wrapped gift. Sebastian's gaze held such tender admiration it could have melted diamonds.

Evelyn accepted the velvet box and revealed a Patek Philippe timepiece that caught the light with every glittering diamond. "The music was for everyone. This," she said, holding the watch toward Sebastian, "is just for you."

Her words still hung in the air when a strong hand closed around her wrist. Evelyn...
###Chapter 189 The Ache of Longing

"Mr. Blackwood, what do you think you're doing?" Sebastian Hart snapped, his voice dripping with irritation as Nathan had just shattered what should have been a perfect romantic moment.

Who did Nathan Blackwood think he was? Sebastian wouldn't back down so easily. But Nathan paid him no attention, his intense gaze locked solely on Evelyn with a darkness that could swallow the room whole.

The Patek Philippe watch in Evelyn's hand glimmered under the lights, but Nathan had never despised an object more. At that moment, he wanted to gather every watch from that brand in his collection and toss them all into the nearest dumpster.

Evelyn's delicate fingers twisted away from Nathan's grasp. Her frosty eyes met his. "Is there something you need, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan's jaw clenched so tightly it ached. He opened his mouth to speak—

But Evelyn cut him off. "Whatever you have to say, save it for later." Her voice was like ice. "This is Sebastian's birthday celebration. Surely you don't intend to make a scene?"

With deliberate care, she fastened the luxury watch around Sebastian's wrist. A satisfied smile played on her lips. "Happy birthday, Sebastian."

Sebastian made a show of admiring his new timepiece, twisting his arm ostentatiously to ensure Nathan couldn't miss it. "Thank you, Evelyn. This is the most meaningful gift I've ever received—something I'll treasure forever." His gaze burned with undisguised adoration.

Evelyn caught her breath. The warmth in Sebastian's eyes was overwhelming—so tender, so full of promise. Yet she couldn't ignore the other presence beside her, the one radiating cold fury that pressed against her skin like a physical weight.

Nathan's thoughts raged. She played piano for him. Celebrated his birthday. Gave him gifts. None of it was meant for me. The pain was visceral, like someone had reached into his chest and twisted his heart. Memories that should have been his alone were being stolen away.

The agony was unbearable.

After a beat, Evelyn lowered her lashes and chuckled lightly. She teased Sebastian, "That model should appreciate in value. Don't go losing it."

Natalie Beaumont observed the tense standoff. Nathan remained rooted in place, his unblinking stare fixed on Evelyn like a predator. What an absolute fool.

"Natalie to the rescue," she muttered, swooping in to extract Evelyn from the uncomfortable situation. "Evelyn! I've lost my clutch—help me find it!" She grabbed her friend's arm.

Evelyn seized the lifeline gratefully. "You and your misplaced belongings," she chided as they hurried away.

Nathan watched until Evelyn disappeared into the crowd before finally turning away. Sebastian smirked. "She clearly doesn't want anything to do with you, Blackwood. Take the hint."

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet. Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "If you value your party remaining intact, Hart, you'll stay out of my way."

The threat hung heavy between them. Nathan hadn't come for this ridiculous celebration. Sebastian wasn't worth his time.

Tristan Whitmore materialized to diffuse the tension. With practiced ease, he steered Sebastian away. "Happy birthday, mate! Let's get you another drink."

Once Sebastian was safely occupied, Tristan returned to Nathan's side. Following his friend's line of sight, Tristan grinned. "Admiring the view?"

Nathan ignored him.

Tristan wasn't deterred. Years of friendship meant he could read Nathan like an open book. "Missing your ex-wife, are we?" he teased.

Nathan's behavior was telling. This wasn't just regret—it was jealousy, pure and simple. The usually composed CEO of Blackwood Enterprises had nearly lost his composure over a birthday gift.

Nathan's expression darkened. "Tristan," he said through gritted teeth, "I haven't even begun to settle accounts with you." His voice was deadly calm. "Who swore Evelyn had a gift for me? Who guaranteed she'd attend my birthday? My birthday was one day before Hart's, yet everything—the piano, the watch—was for him. Because of you and your empty promises, I actually let myself hope."

The last word was a snarl. Hope had only made the disappointment cut deeper. Damn it all to hell.
###Chapter 190 When Innocence Becomes Folly

Tristan's smile froze on his face. His lips twitched nervously. "Well... I didn't exactly anticipate this outcome either," he muttered under his breath.

In his mind, he cursed Sophia for putting such ridiculous ideas in his head. That woman had completely misled him with her wild assumptions.

He never imagined Evelyn could be this ruthless. The entire spectacle had been a deliberate humiliation directed at Nathan.

Meanwhile, the two women strolled backstage, their laughter echoing through the corridors. Natalie and Evelyn casually selected a dressing room, pushing the door open without hesitation.

Their entrance coincided with someone exiting after changing. It was Yuna Takahashi.

The Korean pop star stiffened visibly upon seeing Evelyn. After a brief hesitation, she approached with calculated steps, her expression unreadable.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. Yuna's manicured fingers tightened around her designer bag as she forced a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

Evelyn arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow, her crimson lips curving into a knowing smirk. She'd been expecting this confrontation.

Natalie shifted subtly closer to her friend, her protective instincts kicking in. The dressing room suddenly felt too small for all their conflicting emotions.

Yuna's gaze flickered between the two women, her carefully constructed mask beginning to slip. "We need to talk," she said through gritted teeth.

The demand hung in the air like a challenge. Evelyn's smirk widened, her confidence unshaken. "By all means," she purred, gesturing toward the plush seating area. "Let's have our little chat."

Evelyn was just about to speak when the Hart family's head butler entered with two imposing bodyguards. The butler's gaze landed on Evelyn, and he immediately bowed in deference.

"Ms. Sterling, please forgive the interruption. There's a small matter requiring my attention. It won't take but a moment."

Evelyn exchanged glances with Natalie before nodding. "By all means."

With a curt nod to the bodyguards, the butler signaled them forward. They seized Yuna Takahashi's arms without ceremony, dragging the struggling pop star toward the exit.

"What is this? There must be some mistake!" Yuna's voice trembled. She knew the Hart family's reputation in Montecito - crossing them meant career suicide.

The thought of returning to Korea in disgrace made her stomach churn.

"Ms. Takahashi," the butler said icily, "you've violated the terms of your contract. We're obligated to return you to your agency and terminate our agreement immediately. Your management will be contacted regarding penalty fees."

Yuna's eyes darted to Evelyn, realization dawning. "You!" she gasped. "Evelyn Sinclair, this is your doing!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, letting out a dry chuckle. "Quite the performance for someone who's not even an actress. Who else would bother with you?"

She took a deliberate step forward, arms crossed. The cold amusement in her eyes sent chills down Yuna's spine.

"Naivety becomes stupidity when taken too far, darling." Evelyn's lips curled as she pulled out her phone and dialed Dominic Young right before Yuna's widening eyes.

"Dominic? It's Evelyn. Find out which agency represents Yuna Takahashi. Effective immediately, I want her blacklisted from every red carpet, magazine cover, and film set. Make her disappear from the industry."

The reply came without hesitation. "Consider it done, Ms. Sterling. Yuna Takahashi will be erased from show business by sundown."

Yuna's knees buckled. Dominic Young could bury careers with a snap of his fingers - and just had.

Evelyn tilted her head, voice crisp as winter air. "Just so we're clear - that little stunt earlier? Wasn't me."

She gestured to the bodyguards restraining Yuna. "This? This is me."

The unspoken message hung between them: Evelyn Sinclair didn't make empty threats, and she certainly didn't need to hide her actions.

"Didn't Penelope Sinclair mention her family's Sinclair Group is on the verge of collapse?" Evelyn continued conversationally. "My Sterling Corporation is acquiring them as we speak. Pity you won't be around Montecito to see it happen."

Yuna turned ghostly pale. The Sinclair Group dwarfed her family's Takashi Holdings in Korea. Yet Evelyn spoke of acquiring it like ordering coffee.

A terrifying thought struck Yuna - if Evelyn could dismantle Korea's corporate giants so easily, what would stop her from coming after Takashi Holdings next?

Penelope had set her up. Used her as a pawn against this terrifying woman. The realization left Yuna shaking.

Evelyn's light laugh drew her attention. "Pathetic, really. Being someone else's sacrificial lamb." She turned away dismissively. "Though I can't say you don't deserve it."

The butler stepped forward, voice devoid of emotion. "We'll settle the Hart family's accounts separately. Remove her."

The bodyguards complied immediately. Yuna didn't resist - too paralyzed by visions of her future: banned from Montecito, drowning in debt, her name synonymous with scandal back home. This disgrace would haunt her forever.

Natalie smirked as Yuna was led away. "Another fool who didn't learn from Penelope's mistakes."

Her expression shifted as she turned to Evelyn. "Speaking of fools... what's with Nathan Blackwood lately?"

Evelyn shrugged, brow furrowing. "Your guess is as good as mine. Something's off about him." She suddenly straightened. "Oh! I still owe him for those car repairs!"
###Chapter 191 The Missing Heirloom

Evelyn Sinclair and Natalie Beaumont returned to the grand ballroom. The crowd had resumed their mingling, laughter and champagne flowing freely.

The earlier confrontation might as well have never happened.

Now that Evelyn's true identity was known, no one dared pressure her into drinking. Polite smiles and distant pleasantries were exchanged, but everyone kept a respectful distance.

Exhaustion crept in. Evelyn slipped away to a secluded balcony, craving solitude. The night air was crisp, the city lights shimmering like scattered diamonds across the bay.

A delicate floral scent drifted from the gardens below. Just as she began to relax, footsteps interrupted her peace.

"Evelyn? What are you doing out here?"

Tristan Whitmore's voice made her shoulders tense. Her tranquil expression hardened into icy disdain.

"Do I require your permission to exist in a space, Tristan? Unless you'd like to explain why you're stalking me?"

He winced but pressed on. "That's not— Look, about the watch... Why didn't you give it to Nathan? He waited all night at his birthday gala. The poor guy—"

A humorless laugh escaped her lips. "When did I ever say that watch was for Nathan Blackwood? Are you delusional? Did someone drop you on your head as a child?"

Her thoughts burned sharper. Tristan Whitmore, when will you people grasp reality? Why would I attend a stranger's party? Buy gifts for a man I despise? How much clearer must I be?

Tristan opened his mouth—then froze. His eyes widened at something behind Evelyn. Shock and dread flashed across his face. Oh hell.

"Hate?" The new voice turned Evelyn's blood to ice. She whirled to find Nathan emerging from the floor-length drapes beside her. How long had he been standing there?

His gaze was unreadable, voice deceptively calm. Evelyn forced herself not to flinch.

"I assumed my feelings were obvious, Mr. Blackwood. Clearly, you need everything spelled out." No point in pretense now.

Tristan coughed awkwardly and practically fled. This conversation was his personal nightmare.

Nathan's eyes never left Evelyn's profile. Each word from her lips was a fresh wound. Hate me? Of course she does. I've given her every reason.

The balcony was their private battleground now. No eavesdroppers would dare. Nathan's smile was bitter.

"Nothing I do will ever earn your forgiveness, will it?"

Evelyn studied him, unnerved by the sorrow in his eyes. A trick of the light. Nathan Blackwood doesn't mourn me.

"Mr. Blackwood, we'll never be friends. You're not seeking forgiveness for me—you're seeking absolution for yourself." Her laugh was arctic. "But why should I ease your conscience? If you're truly remorseful, you should suffer as I did. Did you think one apology could erase three years of hell?"

She wanted him broken. Wanted him to drown in regret. This wasn't some amicable separation—it was war.

Nathan's jaw clenched. The apology dying on his tongue tasted like ash. When he finally spoke, his voice was raw.

"Evelyn... I lost the ring. I'm so sorry." That ring was the first thread I pulled in unraveling your life.

The words hit like a physical blow. Evelyn's face went deathly pale before twisting into something vicious.

"Oh, I know." Her smile could have frozen the bay below. "You didn't lose it. You threw it away."
###Chapter 192 The Diamond Bits Are for You

Evelyn Sinclair thought bitterly, Nathan Blackwood is bringing up the lost ring just to twist the knife in my heart, isn't he?

How utterly cruel.

But after enduring so many emotional wounds, my heart had turned to stone.

Nathan's brows furrowed deeper. He opened his mouth to speak when Sebastian Hart came rushing over from across the room.

"My Goddess Evelyn!" The nickname made Evelyn's lips curve involuntarily. The painful memories Nathan had stirred suddenly seemed insignificant.

Not worth dwelling on past sorrows.

Sebastian slipped his arm around Evelyn's shoulders protectively, shooting Nathan a warning glare.

"We're one player short. Saved the spot just for you. Care to join us for a few rounds?"

Ten minutes ago, Evelyn might have agreed. Now, her mood had soured completely.

She forced a faint smile. "No, I'm rather tired. Think I'll head home."

"Let me drive you," Sebastian offered immediately.

Evelyn chuckled. "Don't be ridiculous. It's your birthday - you can't abandon your own party. Archibald will come get me."

"They're not as important as you!" Sebastian insisted, his eyes only for Evelyn.

As Evelyn turned to leave, she suddenly remembered something. Digging into her purse, she pulled out her checkbook and scribbled a figure.

The icy look in Nathan's eyes when she'd turned away softened slightly when she approached him again.

Evelyn shoved the check forcefully into Nathan's breast pocket. "Forty million. Enough for a new car. Now we're even."

Her smile was arctic. More than market value - no need for further complications.

She was sick of Nathan's deliberate provocations, especially after overhearing his conversation with Dominic Kingsley at Kingsley Tech that day.

Remorse? Please. Evelyn turned sharply on her heel.

"Evelyn," Nathan's voice stopped her. "Believe it or not, I didn't lose that ring on purpose."

His face looked gaunt, drained of color.

"As if I'd believe that," Evelyn muttered without turning back, striding away in her stilettos.

Her posture radiated icy detachment. Sebastian escorted her to the door, watching until Archibald's car disappeared.

Back at Sterling Manor, Archibald informed her, "The eldest young master has returned. The family is gathering as per the patriarch's instructions."

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh at the butler's awkward attempt at slang.

Leo came bounding toward her the moment she stepped inside. "Mama! I love you!"

Evelyn scooped up the AI tiger, running her fingers over its custom Hermès tiger-striped suit. "My, aren't you fancy today!"

The tailored faux fur outfit hugged Leo's form perfectly. Since when did her AI pet need haute couture?

Leo preened, tilting his head proudly. "Always cool, Mama!"

"Evelyn! You're home!" William Sterling descended the stairs, arms outstretched.

Giggling, Evelyn moved to hug him, only to be waved off.

"Not you!" William said sheepishly. "I want to hold little Leo!"

Evelyn's jaw dropped. Since when was she dethroned as Daddy's favorite?

William cradled Leo like a baby. "Grandpa will take you for walkies!"

Lucas Sterling snorted from the sofa. "Look who's been dethroned!"

Evelyn glared at him. "Still higher than you, bottom feeder!"

Alexander Sterling approached from the bar, nodding approvingly. "Excellent work on the Pacific Heights Project, little sister."

Evelyn tossed her hair proudly. "Naturally! Did you bring me a present?"

Alexander's expression remained stoic. "Diamonds. In your room."

"How many?"

"About two hundred top-grade whites. Uncut - design them as you wish."

Lucas piped up, "The perks of being rich, huh? Where's mine, big bro?"

Alexander rolled his eyes. "You get the leftover diamond bits."

Lucas looked scandalized. "Seriously? Why does everyone treat me like this?!"
###Chapter 193 The Face of the Brand

News spread like wildfire that Sterling Corporation was searching for a celebrity ambassador for their new men's accessories line. Every talent agency in the city scrambled to submit their top artists' portfolios.

Securing this endorsement deal meant everything. Sterling Corporation's reputation for excellence was unmatched in the industry. Being chosen would cement an artist's status as A-list.

Evelyn Sinclair flipped through stacks of headshots until her vision blurred. Beside her, Bennett tapped his pen thoughtfully against his notepad.

"President Sinclair," he said, lowering his voice. "Just received word from our contacts. Sinclair Group bailed Penelope Sinclair out this morning. They've quietly appointed her as Vice President."

He paused. "And Yuna Takahashi has been extradited back to Korea."

Evelyn didn't look up from the photos. "Bailed out?" Her lips curved slightly. The news about Yuna's extradition didn't surprise her - the Takahashi family had that kind of influence.

As for Penelope? Sinclair Group had deep pockets. And let's face it - tax evasion wasn't exactly murder. Evelyn snapped the portfolio shut.

"How's the acquisition progressing?" she asked.

Bennett's expression brightened. "Smooth sailing. We've severed their supply chain completely. At this rate, Sinclair Group will declare bankruptcy within three weeks unless they find new investors."

Evelyn's phone vibrated with an incoming call. Dominic Young's name flashed on the screen.

"President Sinclair," his smooth voice came through. "Heard you're in the market for an ambassador. Might I suggest someone?"

Evelyn's eyebrows lifted. Dominic rarely recommended talent. "Go on."

"Julian Moreau. Clean image, massive social media following. Since he's under my management now, I'd love to give the kid this opportunity. What do you think?"

The name triggered a memory. Julian had been caught in that media scandal with her months ago. Unlike others, he'd refused to capitalize on the situation or milk it for publicity.

Evelyn felt a twinge of guilt. The boy had integrity. "Done," she said without hesitation. Julian had been on her shortlist anyway.

Dominic chuckled. "Were you waiting for me to ask, Evelyn? Playing favorites, are we?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Dominic, with that imagination, you should be writing soap operas." She ended the call.

Turning to Bennett, she announced, "Julian Moreau gets the contract. Have legal draft the paperwork."

Bennett smirked. "The shipping community will lose their minds. Your pairing with him alone will sell out the collection."

Evelyn shot him a look.

Clearing his throat, Bennett added, "You should attend the press conference, President. Avoiding it would only fuel more speculation."

Evelyn nodded. She knew how these games were played.

Three days later, Sterling Corporation's official announcement sent the internet into meltdown. #EvelynAndJulian trended worldwide as fans dubbed themselves "Evians." When the campaign photos dropped - Julian modeling sleek silver cufflinks - pre-orders hit 200 million units in twenty-four hours, smashing all previous records.

Meanwhile, Sinclair Group unveiled their competing line of men's jewelry. Their ambassador? None other than Penelope Sinclair, squeezing every last drop from her fading celebrity status.

The audacious move? Booking the adjacent ballroom at The Grandeur Hotel for their launch event - same date, same time as Sterling's.

"President," Bennett fumed, "should we have the hotel cancel their reservation? This is blatant piggybacking."

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "Let them play their little game." She checked her watch. "There's still thirty-six hours. Contact our specialist. She'll handle Penelope."

If Penelope wanted to play dirty in the business world, Evelyn would show her how it's really done.
###Chapter 194 Because She's Stunning

The following day at the press conference, Julian Moreau arrived at the venue to find the entrance swarmed with enthusiastic fans.

No prior announcement had been made about Evelyn Sinclair's attendance, making her unexpected appearance through the back door an electrifying surprise.

The moment she stepped into view, the crowd erupted in delighted cheers. Seeing Evelyn and Julian together in the same frame was enough to captivate everyone's attention.

Upon her entrance, both the designer and company representatives immediately rose to greet her. With a graceful smile, Evelyn settled into a quiet corner seat.

Yet despite her understated presence, all eyes remained fixed on Evelyn. The live broadcast of the event sent online platforms into a frenzy.

[CEO Evelyn is absolutely breathtaking! She should debut as an actress!]
[This pairing is visual perfection!]
[Finally secured that bracelet pre-order - what a battle!]

At Kingsley Tech headquarters, Nathan Blackwood watched the live press conference on his office's massive screen. The viewership numbers doubled the instant Evelyn appeared on camera.

The men's bracelet collection sold out within minutes of launch. On screen, Julian's face lit up with a radiant, boyish smile the moment he spotted Evelyn in the crowd.

Then came the provocative question from a reporter: "Julian, what do you admire most about Evelyn?"

The room fell silent. Even the company representatives held their breath. Only the relentless clicking of cameras filled the air as everyone awaited Julian's response.

All eyes darted between Julian and Evelyn's reaction. After a brief pause, Julian turned his gaze directly toward Evelyn, his smile never faltering.

"Because she's stunning." His answer was disarmingly simple, utterly sincere, and completely irrefutable. The tension in the room instantly dissolved into warm laughter.

Watching from his office, Nathan scoffed at the response. "How superficial," he muttered disdainfully.

His assistant Harrison quickly agreed, "Indeed, sir. Women prefer more substantive compliments."

But on screen, the camera captured Evelyn's reaction - her smile widened, her eyes sparkling with genuine pleasure at Julian's words. Harrison immediately regretted his comment as an icy chill seemed to fill the room.

The assistant froze, suddenly aware he'd stepped on dangerous ground. Would this misstep cost him his job?

As the designer concluded the press conference, crowds gathered at the exits hoping to catch another glimpse of the striking pair. Evelyn and Julian made for a breathtaking combination - her elegant poise perfectly complementing his youthful charm.

Julian carried himself with such natural grace beside Evelyn, his handsome features and radiant smile making him anything but overshadowed. Photographers scrambled to capture every moment of this perfect pairing.

But their exit was interrupted by another group's arrival - none other than Penelope Sinclair and her Sinclair Group entourage. Evelyn's smile took on a knowing edge.

Penelope had clearly come to ride their publicity wave, demonstrating her knack for capitalizing on public interest. Dressed in a sharp pantsuit, she'd fully embraced her new image as a business mogul rather than actress.

"What a coincidence!" Penelope announced brightly to the cameras. "We're also launching new products today."

Evelyn maintained her composed smile, neither engaging nor avoiding Penelope. Having no relationship with the woman, she saw no need for false camaraderie before the cameras.

Penelope continued her performance: "As fellow jewelry businesses, recognition from established leaders like Ms. Sterling means everything to us newcomers."

Evelyn barely restrained an eye roll at the audacity. Then, in a flash of movement, a figure emerged from the press scrum and delivered a stinging slap across Penelope's face.

"Penelope Sinclair! How dare you play the wealthy heiress while your family goes bankrupt?" The assailant was none other than Yuna Takahashi - arriving right on cue.
###Chapter 195 Not Good to Add Insult to Injury

Penelope Sinclair stumbled backward, her heels catching on the uneven pavement. She barely caught herself before falling, her face draining of color.

Before she could regain her balance, Yuna Takahashi lunged at her again, eyes blazing with fury.

"You used me to go after Evelyn Sinclair!" Yuna's voice was raw with betrayal. "Why didn't you tell me she was the Sterling heiress? The Sterlings own half the industry! My family spent years securing a deal with Sterling Corp in Seoul, and you ruined it—you ruined everything!"

The reporters swarmed closer, cameras flashing relentlessly. The live broadcast captured every humiliating second.

Penelope's carefully constructed image was crumbling in real time.

Security finally managed to drag Yuna away, but the damage was done. Penelope's designer dress was torn, her hair a tangled mess. Red scratches marred her porcelain skin.

The once-glamorous actress now looked like a cornered animal.

Panic clawed at her throat as she scanned the crowd. Every reporter's gaze felt like a knife.

This wasn't how it was supposed to go.

She was supposed to rise, not fall.

Her desperate glare landed on Evelyn, who stood calmly at the edge of the chaos, an amused smile playing on her lips.

A reporter shoved a microphone toward Evelyn. "Ms. Sterling, what's your response to Penelope Sinclair's actions?"

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning thoughtfulness. "Well..." She sighed, her tone dripping with false sympathy. "Even though Ms. Sinclair hired people to harm me and my brother, it wouldn't be right for me to... add insult to injury, would it?"

With that, she turned and walked away, her bodyguards clearing a path.

Penelope's jaw clenched.

Not good to add insult to injury?

The phrase echoed in the air, heavy with implication.

The last shred of public sympathy for Penelope evaporated instantly.

Evelyn slid into her car, unbothered. The online backlash was already being steered—she didn’t need to lift a finger.

Meanwhile, the evidence she'd handed over—proof that Reginald Sinclair had bribed Maxwell Thornton—sent shockwaves through Sinclair Group.

Stock prices plummeted.

Investigations opened.

And in less than two weeks, Sinclair Group was absorbed by Sterling Corp, reduced to nothing more than a subsidiary.

Penelope had no choice but to crawl back to acting—except no one would hire her.

At Sterling Manor, Evelyn lounged on the sofa, scrolling through a luxury shopping livestream.

She deserved this.

After everything, she definitely deserved this.

When "@RichBaby" appeared in the chat, the streamer nearly choked.

Evelyn smirked.

Leo, curled in her lap, watched the screen with far more interest than she did. His tiny tail flicked.

"I'm going to shower," Evelyn murmured, scratching behind his ears. "Buy whatever you want, okay?"

Leo purred, flashing his little fangs. "I will."

Just as Evelyn stood, the next item appeared on screen.

Her breath caught.

Two billion dollars.
###Chapter 196: What Could Possibly Go Wrong?

The amount displayed on screen wasn't just substantial—it was astronomical. Who in their right mind would casually drop that kind of cash? The live chat exploded with reactions, yet no one dared place a bid.

This content is brought to you by N?velDrama.Org.

The string of zeros following the first digit left viewers dizzy. When the streamer announced the item—a private tropical island named Panther Cay, valued at two billion dollars—silence fell.

Who even buys an island online? Clearly, the streamer had used it as clickbait to boost viewership.

Then, in a heartbeat, it was sold.

The buyer’s ID flashed across the screen: @RichBaby.

The chat erupted.

Evelyn Sinclair’s account had resurfaced. Last time, she’d blown 800 million to hijack an entire shopping livestream, demanding the host scour Europe for her whims.

Now? She’d just casually dropped two billion on a tropical island.

For the ultra-rich, money wasn’t currency—it was just numbers on a screen.

Unaware she’d become trending news again, Evelyn stepped out of the bathroom, only for Leo to pounce at her feet.

"Mama! I bought a little panther!"

Evelyn’s lips twitched.

She blinked at her stack of phones, wondering if she was hallucinating.

A bank notification glared back at her:

($2,000,000,000.00 — PAYMENT SUCCESSFUL!)

Panther Cay, a private tropical island, now belonged to Evelyn Sinclair.

Leo’s eyes sparkled with glee as it bounced around her, tail flicking excitedly before curling into her arms.

Evelyn exhaled. Sure, it was an absurd purchase—but the money was already gone.

Now, what exactly did one do with an island?

Before she could brainstorm, Lucas’ scream tore through the penthouse.

"WHO THE HELL SPENT MY TWO BILLION?!"

Evelyn froze.

She double-checked the bank alert.

Oh.

Oops.

That particular card had been linked to Lucas’ account.

"Fantastic! I just saved two billion!" Lucas stormed out of the kitchen, phone clutched in a death grip, glaring at his sister. "WHY?!"

Evelyn offered a sheepish smile. "Well… to celebrate my recent corporate takeover and the billion-dollar profit I made, I bought myself a little island."

Lucas clutched his chest.

She’d earned a billion—then spent two to celebrate?!

He whipped toward William Sterling, who’d just entered the room.

"Dad, are you sure Evelyn won’t bankrupt the company?"

William smacked the back of Lucas’ head. "Don’t be dramatic. It’s just an island."

Then, with a dismissive glance, he added, "Honestly, you’re the most useless of my children."

Lucas gaped.

Why was he always footing Evelyn’s bills?!

First the yacht, then the shopping spree, now this island?!

Alexander and Donovan were far richer than him!

Evelyn grinned, eyes crinkling. "Lucas, Leo and I appreciate you so much."

With that, she scooped up Leo and sauntered off.

The internet, meanwhile, had imploded.

[Rich Queen, buy me next!]
[CEO Sinclair, adopt me!]
[Goddess, I’m cheaper than an island!]
[Imagine having 2B to blow on a whim…]
[The jealousy is REAL.]

Dominic Kingsley, under Evelyn’s orders, swiftly contained the frenzy. By the next evening, chatter had died down—until Isabella Montgomery dragged Evelyn out to Velvet Lounge to "celebrate" her new acquisition.

When Evelyn arrived, Isabella was already laughing with the bartender.

Spotting Evelyn, she winked. "Ms. Sinclair, your spending habits are legendary."

Evelyn sighed. "What if I told you it was an accidental purchase?"

She gestured to Leo. "He must’ve misclicked. What bad intentions could a tiny AI tiger have?"

The bartender stared at her with reverence, sliding a shot of tequila her way.

Evelyn downed it. "Thanks."

"You just scared off every gold-digger in the city," Isabella mused. "Next time, maybe don’t broadcast your island purchases if you want suitors."

Evelyn arched a brow. "I spend my family’s money. Why would I care about men’s opinions?"

"Fair." Isabella smirked. "Though, you did reject Nathan Blackwood."

Evelyn snorted. "Him? Worthless."

Isabella tapped her chin. "At least find someone more expensive next time."

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink.

This woman was insane.

Isabella, however, was dead serious. "How much do you think Nathan’s worth?"

Evelyn’s lips curled.

"Less than dirt."
###Chapter 197 A Public Declaration

At the bar counter, the bartender who overheard Evelyn Sinclair and Isabella Montgomery's conversation couldn't suppress a smirk.

Only Evelyn would dare call Nathan Blackwood worthless in this entire city.

Wait—

The bartender's eyes widened when he spotted a tall, imposing figure standing behind the two women.

Those sharp features in the dim lighting... It couldn't be...

His hands trembled violently. The cocktail shaker slipped from his grasp, shattering on the marble counter with a loud crash.

"M-Mr. B-Blackwood?"

Both Evelyn and Isabella froze simultaneously. Years of friendship had given them perfect synchronization—neither turned around.

Speak of the devil indeed. Evelyn felt her skin prickle under the intensity of that burning gaze.

Her pulse raced. Then she steeled herself. What was there to fear? Even if she said it to his face, it would still be true—Nathan Blackwood meant nothing to her now.

With renewed confidence, Evelyn spun around.

Empty space. She frowned and shot the bartender a death glare.

"I swear! He was right there!" The bartender stammered, wiping sweat from his brow. "One second he was there, the next—poof! Gone!"

Isabella exhaled shakily, though she couldn't explain her own relief. A sudden drumroll grabbed everyone's attention.

Evelyn's gaze snapped to the stage where a familiar figure sat behind the drum set, lost in the rhythm.

"Sebastian Hart?" Isabella grinned knowingly.

She leaned closer to Evelyn. "Guess who's returning to town? Victoria Ashford."

Victoria Ashford—CEO of Ashford Enterprises and current head of the powerful Ashford family from Santa Barbara.

After her parents' tragic death, the young heiress had single-handedly rescued her family's empire from collapse. The business world knew her as the "Ice Queen"—ruthless, brilliant, and untouchable.

Few knew about her decade-long unrequited love for Sebastian Hart.

Evelyn's drink nearly slipped from her fingers. "She came back for him?"

Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Why else would the Ice Queen grace our humble Velvet Lounge?"

Evelyn choked on her cocktail. "Well damn. Someone's about to get claimed."

On stage, Sebastian lost himself in the music's crescendo. As the final beat echoed, he twirled his drumsticks with a roguish grin that sent female patrons swooning.

Evelyn instinctively raised her hand to applaud—only for Sebastian to lock eyes with her.

He grabbed the microphone. "The woman I adore is cheering for me tonight."

With a deliberate wink at Evelyn, he sent the crowd into hysterics. She immediately dropped her hand, cheeks flaming as she turned away.

"That lunatic!" Evelyn hissed.

Isabella ducked her head, pretending not to know them. "The man has no shame."

From the VIP balcony above, every moment played out in perfect clarity.

Nathan Blackwood observed the radiant Sebastian with stormy eyes, his jaw clenched tight enough to crack teeth.

Across from him sat an elegant woman with a sleek bob—her aura so icy it could frost the champagne flute in her white-knuckled grip.

Though young, Victoria Ashford carried herself with the poise of a seasoned executive. Not a single emotion flickered across her porcelain face—except when her gaze lingered on Sebastian.

For one unguarded moment, raw jealousy flashed in her eyes before vanishing behind her usual impenetrable mask.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly, raising her glass, "I trust our collaboration will be... mutually beneficial."

Their crystal glasses touched with a delicate chime. The deal was sealed.
###Chapter 198 I Won't Back Down

The morning sun cast golden rays through Evelyn Sinclair's penthouse windows as she prepared for the day. She chose a sleek emerald green dress that hugged her curves perfectly, layering it with a tailored white blazer that screamed power and elegance.

Her assistant Bennett was already waiting when she arrived at Sterling Corp's headquarters. "The bidding starts at 2 PM," he informed her, handing over a thick dossier. "This property in Montevista is the most coveted commercial land this quarter."

Evelyn's fingers traced the embossed Sterling Corp logo on the folder. "Let me guess - Blackwood Enterprises is our main competition?"

Bennett nodded grimly. The numbers on the first page made Evelyn's eyebrows rise. "This is our opening bid? That's..."

"Ambitious? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely." Bennett adjusted his glasses. "Nathan Blackwood wouldn't bring anything less to this fight."

The Grandeur Hotel's ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers that afternoon. The air hummed with polite conversation and veiled threats as rival executives circled each other like sharks. No one revealed their cards - the numbers in their briefcases would determine who walked away victorious.

Harrison, Nathan's ever-efficient assistant, worked the room with practiced ease. But it was the striking brunette beside him who caught Evelyn's attention. The woman carried herself with the confidence of someone used to commanding rooms, her burgundy pantsuit accentuating her sharp features.

Their eyes met across the crowded space. The stranger's lips curved into a knowing smile as she approached. "Ms. Sinclair," she extended a manicured hand. "Victoria Ashford. I've been looking forward to meeting you."

Evelyn accepted the handshake, feeling the subtle challenge in the other woman's grip. "The feeling is mutual, Ms. Ashford. Your reputation precedes you."

Victoria's designer suit screamed West Coast money, all sharp angles and calculated elegance. In contrast, Evelyn's flowing dress softened her powerful presence, creating an intriguing juxtaposition between the two businesswomen.

"Nathan not joining the fun today?" Evelyn asked casually, noting the absence of her ex-husband.

Before Victoria could respond, a familiar voice interrupted. "Darling, you're looking positively radiant today." Sebastian Hart materialized at Evelyn's side, draping an arm around her shoulders with his trademark charm.

Evelyn rolled her eyes but didn't shrug him off. "Shouldn't you be bidding for Hart Industries instead of harassing me?"

Sebastian's grin turned wolfish. "Why bid for land when I can bid for your attention?"

Victoria's entire demeanor shifted at Sebastian's appearance. The ice queen melted, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear with sudden self-consciousness. "Mr. Hart," she said, her voice dropping an octave. "What a pleasant surprise."

Sebastian blinked. "Do I know you?"

Evelyn barely suppressed a groan. "Sebastian, this is Victoria Ashford from Ashford Enterprises? Your Harvard Business School classmate?"

Recognition dawned on Sebastian's face. "Victoria! My God, you've changed." His appreciative once-over made Victoria flush. "Last time I saw you, you were all braces and textbooks."

The tension dissipated as the auctioneer called for attention. Bennett took his seat beside Evelyn, fingers flying across his tablet. "Something's off," he muttered. "Blackwood's team isn't acting like they want this property."

The bidding war commenced with smaller players dropping out quickly as the numbers climbed past $30 billion. When Victoria threw down $35 billion, the room held its breath.

Evelyn signaled Bennett. "$38 billion."

Victoria countered immediately. "$40 billion."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. Ashford Enterprises specialized in California real estate - why this sudden interest in East Coast property? Bennett's message pinged on her screen: Victoria's working with Nathan. This is a setup.

The pieces clicked into place. Of course Nathan would use a proxy to drive up the price. Evelyn's lips curled into a smirk. Two could play that game. She leaned toward Bennett. "Let's give them a number they won't forget."
###Chapter 199 Everything I Have

If Kingsley Tech and Ashford Enterprises were collaborating, their chances of winning this bid would skyrocket.

Evelyn Sinclair maintained a composed smile, though unease flickered in her chest. This trip might end in disappointment, but she wasn’t about to surrender without a fight.

She signaled Bennett to continue. $45 billion.

The room fell silent. The real battle had just begun.

Victoria Ashford shot Evelyn a scorching glare before raising her paddle. $48 billion.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. That was dangerously close to her limit.

Even if Sterling Corporation could afford more, the profit margins would shrink to nothing.

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn met Bennett’s gaze and nodded. $49 billion.

Victoria faltered. Evelyn knew she’d hit their breaking point.

Victoria and Harrison exchanged hushed words before Harrison pulled out his phone. Nathan Blackwood must be getting an update, Evelyn thought.

$49 billion going twice!

Victoria’s paddle shot up again, her expression strained. $49.3 billion!

Evelyn exhaled. She wouldn’t bleed money for pride.

$49.3 billion going twice!

Just as the auctioneer raised his gavel, Sebastian Hart—seated beside Evelyn—spoke.

$50 billion.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Evelyn gaped at him.

Have you lost your mind?!

Sebastian merely smirked, silent.

Victoria paled. $50 billion was beyond her agreement with Nathan.

$50 billion going once! $50 billion going twice! Sold to Mr. Hart of Hart Industries!

Applause erupted. The prime land now belonged to the Harts.

Sebastian rose gracefully, acknowledging the crowd before striding to the stage. Evelyn and Bennett exchanged stunned glances.

The always-reserved Hart family had just dropped $50 billion on a plot of land? Since when were they interested in real estate?

As congratulations poured in, Evelyn gathered her purse to leave.

A firm hand caught her wrist.

"Leaving so soon?"

Sebastian’s devilish grin was infuriatingly charming. His eyes sparkled like starlight.

Evelyn stiffened, then forced a smile. "Expecting congratulations? $50 billion, Sebastian. Did you even run the numbers?"

He chuckled. "Save them for yourself."

She frowned.

Sebastian leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "You wanted this land, didn’t you? I’ll sell it to you for $49 billion."

Evelyn froze.

Victoria and Harrison, lingering nearby, overheard. Victoria’s face drained of color.

"Mr. Hart!" she snapped. "You’re not developing this yourself?"

Sebastian turned, his smile lazy. "Not interested. Just buying it for my goddess." He winked at Evelyn.

Victoria trembled. "You—you’re treating corporate funds like a game?!"

Sebastian’s amusement vanished. His voice turned icy. "It’s my family’s money. I don’t need outsiders lecturing me."

Then, softening, he cupped Evelyn’s face.

"Honestly, I’d give it to you for free. But I know you’d protest. So marry me instead." His thumb brushed her cheek. "Everything I have is yours."
###Chapter 200 You Won't Steal from Me, Right?

Sebastian Hart smirked to himself. It's just a piece of land. Consider it an engagement gift.

Evelyn Sinclair never expected Sebastian to throw money at her like this. A storm of conflicting emotions churned in her chest.

It wasn’t that she couldn’t afford the extra billion.

But corporate funds weren’t something she could move around so recklessly.

Sebastian’s bold move had cornered her. As Evelyn hesitated, Victoria Ashford scoffed.

"I didn’t realize New York’s business elite had such blurred lines between personal and professional affairs."

Her voice dripped with disdain. "Second Young Master Hart, are you really gambling your family’s fortune just to impress a woman?"

Victoria had crossed a line. Sebastian’s expression darkened, his gaze turning icy.

He ignored her completely, his attention fixed solely on Evelyn.

"As long as she’s happy," he said smoothly, "it’s worth every penny."

His words were deliberate, laced with challenge. "Even if I have to lose everything for her, I’d do it without hesitation."

Victoria’s face twisted. The humiliation burned.

Without another word, the proud businesswoman turned on her heel and stormed off, her composure shattered.

Sebastian Hart was utterly, shamelessly in love with Evelyn Sinclair.

Evelyn frowned. "Sebastian, this is reckless."

He just laughed. "I won’t let what you want fall into someone else’s hands."

Especially Nathan Blackwood’s.

Evelyn sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. "Bennett," she called to her assistant. "Transfer $49 billion to Hart Corporation immediately."

"Yes, ma’am."

She met Sebastian’s gaze. "The remaining billion will come from my personal account."

He’s not Lucas. I won’t take advantage of him.

Sebastian’s smirk vanished. "Evelyn, I don’t want your money."

"Then prepare to explain to your grandfather why you wasted $50 billion on a whim," she shot back, already walking away.

Sebastian paled at the thought.

Reginald Hart would skin him alive.

He hurried after her. "I did this for you!"

"Get lost," Evelyn said without looking back.

Blackwood Enterprises.

Nathan Blackwood’s expression was thunderous as Harrison delivered the report.

If Evelyn had won the bid fairly, he wouldn’t have been angry. He had even considered withdrawing—or proposing a three-way partnership.

But Sebastian Hart had swooped in and handed it to her like some grand romantic gesture.

What does that make me? Nathan thought bitterly. A cheap, calculating bastard in comparison?

Harrison stood silently, sensing the dangerous shift in the air.

Blackwood Enterprises had lost bids before. But never had Nathan looked this furious.

Second Young Master Hart really knows how to push his buttons.

"Sir," Harrison ventured carefully, "since the matter is already settled—"

Nathan cut him off. "Contact Reginald Hart. Tell him I’ll buy that land for $50 billion."

His tone left no room for negotiation. "Ask if he’s willing to sell."

Harrison blinked. This was a direct bypass of Sebastian.

Just how much does he despise the man?

Without delay, Harrison made the call, explaining the situation and Nathan’s offer.

To his surprise, Reginald Hart agreed within seconds.

"My grandson is impulsive. Pay him no mind."

The old man’s voice was firm. "I’ll have the land transferred to Blackwood Enterprises immediately."

Harrison exhaled in relief. "Thank you, Mr. Hart. We’ll send representatives to assist with the handover."

Within minutes, Evelyn received a call from Reginald Hart.

She listened, then laughed in disbelief.

Perfect. I didn’t want this mess anyway.

But one thought nagged at her. Since when is Nathan Blackwood this bold?

Without hesitation, she agreed to the arrangement. Business came first.

At $50 billion, the land was a financial sinkhole.

The deal was settled quietly, efficiently.

Sebastian Hart was the last to know.
###Chapter 201 Evelyn's Elite Attitude

With the matter finally settled, Evelyn Sinclair exhaled in relief. Isabella Montgomery extended a shopping invitation which Evelyn eagerly accepted.

The upscale mall buzzed with activity as the two friends strolled through its marble corridors. By chance, they wandered into an exclusive automotive showroom where a gleaming Aston Martin sat center stage, its polished curves catching the light.

Even Evelyn, accustomed to luxury, paused to admire the vehicle's flawless design. "This masterpiece belongs in my private collection," she murmured, running her fingers along the sleek hood.

Isabella rolled her eyes playfully. "Only you would say that about a million-dollar car."

A sharp-eyed salesman approached, immediately recognizing Evelyn from recent headlines about her extravagant purchases. His commission dreams danced before his eyes as he practically bowed. "Ms. Sinclair! How may I assist you today?"

Just as Evelyn considered the purchase, a familiar voice cut through the showroom. "I'll take it. Name your price."

Turning, Evelyn faced Victoria Ashford and Sophia Blackwood. The contrast between them was striking - Victoria's polished elegance overshadowing Sophia's forced sophistication.

Sophia's gaze held undisguised challenge. While she lacked the courage to confront Evelyn directly, her companion clearly didn't share that hesitation.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Ms. Ashford, I didn't know you had an interest in sports cars."

Victoria's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Some things are worth acquiring on sight. Though it seems you've beaten me to it again."

"Not necessarily," Sophia interjected. "No payment means no ownership. First come doesn't always mean first served."

The salesman shifted uncomfortably. "That's correct... Ms. Sinclair hasn't completed the transaction."

Evelyn studied Victoria carefully. The unspoken hostility puzzled her - they'd never interacted beyond polite business functions.

"Would you really deny me this?" Victoria asked, her tone light but eyes sharp.

Isabella tensed beside Evelyn, sensing the undercurrents. But Evelyn merely smiled. "Of course not. If this catches your eye, by all means."

Victoria blinked, unprepared for such easy concession. The salesman jumped in. "The price is six million, madam."

Without hesitation, Victoria produced a black card. "Process it immediately."

Sophia clapped like an excited child. "Victoria, you're incredible! This car was made for you!"

Evelyn and Isabella exchanged glances. "We should continue our shopping," Evelyn said smoothly.

Victoria's lips curved. "Why not join us? The more the merrier."

Both women froze at the unexpected invitation. The tension thickened like fog in the showroom.
###Chapter 202 This Mall Is Mine

Since Victoria Ashford insisted on joining them, Evelyn Sinclair couldn't refuse without seeming rude. She curved her lips into a polite but distant smile.

"Of course, the pleasure is mine."

She's clearly targeting me. But why? Evelyn pondered it all afternoon but couldn't pinpoint the reason.

When they entered a high-end boutique, the staff immediately recognized Evelyn. As the owner of an exclusive global membership, she was their most valued client.

The manager rushed forward with a practiced smile. "Ms. Sinclair, what brings you in today? We have two new limited-edition handbags—only three exist worldwide. Would you like to see them?"

Before Evelyn could respond, an attendant had already brought them out.

They were exquisite.

"I'll take them," Victoria declared without hesitation.

The staff froze, glancing uncertainly at Evelyn.

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with amusement, her smile deepening.

"Didn't you hear Ms. Ashford?"

The staff scrambled to obey, wrapping the bags for Victoria.

Not stopping there, Victoria proceeded to purchase every item the manager had intended to show Evelyn—a dozen more bags in total.

Evelyn didn't protest, letting her take them all.

They visited several other luxury stores, where Victoria repeated the same pattern—buying everything recommended to Evelyn.

Isabella Montgomery gently tugged Evelyn's arm. "This Victoria shops with more enthusiasm than I do," she murmured.

Evelyn smirked.

By the time they finished, Evelyn's feet ached. She settled into an outdoor café on the upper level, savoring a cup of rich, aromatic coffee. The warmth soothed her instantly.

Victoria and Sophia Blackwood joined her after completing their purchases. Victoria ordered a coffee for herself.

Evelyn regarded her with relaxed ease. "Did you enjoy your shopping spree, Ms. Ashford?"

Victoria hesitated. "It was... adequate."

She seemed to be choosing her words carefully. "Ms. Sinclair, you didn't seem interested in any of the items I bought. Doesn't it bother you?"

Evelyn chuckled, tucking a strand of her long, wavy hair behind her ear. Her smile was radiant.

"Ms. Ashford, I suppose you weren't aware—this mall belongs to me. Since you've been so generous in supporting my business, why would I be upset? I'm delighted by your patronage."

The more Victoria spent, the happier Evelyn became.

The expressions around the table shifted dramatically—especially Sophia's.

Sophia's face was a picture of shock. This mall was the premier shopping destination for high society, where even the cheapest rug cost six figures.

She had no idea it was Evelyn's.

Victoria stiffened, her eyes turning icy.

"You played me?" she asked coolly.

Evelyn met her gaze without flinching.

"You chose to challenge me, Ms. Ashford. I didn't force you to buy anything."

Her lips curled into a frosty smile. Who does she think she's dealing with? She may have been a CEO for years, but I built my empire in Europe while she was still in college.

The air grew thick with tension.

Victoria was a seasoned businesswoman, capable of intimidating socialites with a single glance. Yet Evelyn remained unreadable—unaffected.

After a long silence, Victoria let out a cold laugh.

"Fine. I underestimated you this time. No wonder men flock to you, Ms. Sinclair. You're... different."

Men? Evelyn was baffled.

Aside from the persistent Sebastian Hart, who else was there?

Then it clicked.

"Ms. Ashford," Evelyn said slowly, "are you targeting me because of Sebastian?"
###Chapter 203 If You Can't Stand It, Look Away

Evelyn Sinclair propped her chin on her hands, elbows resting lightly on the coffee table. She tilted her head slightly, studying Victoria Ashford with an amused glint in her eyes.

One beat. Two beats. Three.

Silence stretched between them.

When no answer came, Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile.

Victoria's usually composed expression flickered—just for a second—before irritation darkened her gaze. "I simply can't stand watching you treat people like disposable options."

Her words were sharp, deliberate.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Oh?"

"Am I wrong?" Victoria countered, her voice icy. "Sebastian Hart clearly has feelings for you, yet you keep stringing him along. Isn't that exactly what you're doing?"

Isabella Montgomery scoffed, crossing her arms. "Since when has Evelyn ever led Sebastian on? What do you even know about their relationship?"

Victoria's jaw tightened, but she didn’t back down. "Just because you're close friends, it's acceptable for Ms. Sinclair to play with his emotions without remorse?"

Evelyn's patience snapped.

"Play with his emotions?" she repeated, her voice dangerously soft. "Ms. Ashford, which part of my actions gave you that impression? Sebastian is the one who chose to cross the line from friendship. I’ve made my stance clear—repeatedly."

Her fingers tapped lightly against the table. "If anything, I’m the one exhausted from having to reject him over and over."

Victoria’s lips pressed into a thin line. "If you don’t return his feelings, you should cut him off completely. Keeping him around while knowing how he feels—that’s cruel."

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "So, according to you, rejecting someone means burning every bridge? Erasing years of friendship?"

Victoria didn’t answer, but her silence was confirmation enough.

Ridiculous.

Evelyn leaned back, studying Victoria’s rigid posture. This little interrogation had clearly been planned.

She and Sebastian had been friends since childhood. She had ignored his advances, rejected him outright—multiple times. She owed him nothing beyond basic decency.

And yet, here Victoria was, acting as if Evelyn had committed some unforgivable sin.

"You know," Evelyn mused, her tone light but edged with steel, "I get the feeling you’ve never had to reject anyone before."

Victoria stiffened.

"Not every friendship has to turn romantic. Sebastian was the one who wanted more. I didn’t encourage it." Evelyn shrugged. "If I had, I would’ve accepted his proposal by now."

The unspoken words hung in the air: The problem isn’t me. It’s him.

Victoria’s expression darkened. "Or maybe you’re just keeping him as a backup while you explore other options."

Isabella slammed her hands on the table, rising to her feet. "Are you serious right now? Evelyn has been nothing but clear with Sebastian. If you’re so obsessed with him, go after him yourself! Don’t blame Evelyn because he doesn’t like you."

A flicker of something raw passed over Victoria’s face—hurt, frustration, maybe even humiliation. But she was a seasoned businesswoman. She knew how to mask her emotions.

Within seconds, her composure returned.

"Who Sebastian likes is irrelevant," she said coolly. "I simply don’t approve of Ms. Sinclair toying with people’s feelings."

Isabella looked ready to explode. Evelyn caught her wrist, pulling her back down.

"Enough," Evelyn murmured. "This is pointless."

Victoria’s smile was frosty. "Taking that as your admission, Ms. Sinclair?"

Evelyn stood, smoothing her skirt. Then she turned, meeting Victoria’s gaze head-on. Her lips curved into a slow, mocking smile.

"Ms. Ashford," she said sweetly, "my life is none of your business. If you don’t like what you see?" She leaned in slightly, voice dropping to a whisper.

"Then look away."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked out, Isabella right behind her.

Victoria’s fists clenched at her sides.

But Evelyn didn’t glance back.
###Chapter 204 Why Did You Invite Me?

Evelyn let out a bitter chuckle. She wasn't sure whether she was laughing at Victoria Ashford's childish behavior or sheer stupidity. Tightening her grip on Isabella's arm, she spun on her heel and strode out of the café.

The afternoon sun bathed Montecito in golden light, the cloudless sky stretching endlessly above them. The weight in Evelyn's chest lifted as she inhaled the crisp air.

Isabella huffed the moment they stepped outside. "Victoria might be a brilliant businesswoman, but she's utterly clueless when it comes to men. No wonder she's still single."

Evelyn smirked. When the Ashford empire had been on the brink of collapse years ago, vultures had circled, hoping to manipulate Victoria into handing over control.

Yet against all odds, the steel-spined heiress had single-handedly saved her family's legacy. In the cutthroat world of business, Victoria was known for her ruthless efficiency - willing to cross any line if it meant securing victory.

No wonder she had so few suitors. Evelyn shook her head with quiet amusement. "I think she's serious about Nathan this time..."

Isabella gave a pitying look. "Sebastian would never go for someone like her. She's wasting her time." Evelyn merely arched a brow. "Don't be so sure."

Before Isabella could ask why, a sleek Range Rover pulled up beside them. The tinted window rolled down to reveal Nathan Blackwood's sculpted features. "Get in," he commanded, his deep voice smooth as aged whiskey.

Evelyn stiffened, deliberately turning away. She grabbed Isabella's hand and started walking in the opposite direction.

"First Victoria, now Nathan," she muttered. "This day just keeps getting better."

"Do you want that land parcel?" Nathan's question stopped her mid-step.

Evelyn turned slowly. "What do you mean?"

Hadn't Kingsley Tech already secured those rights? While she couldn't fathom why they'd overpay for the property, a corporation of their stature surely had plans to recoup their investment.

Nathan's gaze darkened. "Partner with me. If this project succeeds, Sterling Corporation's costs will drop by two-thirds."

Evelyn laughed derisively. Reduced costs meant slimmer profits. A three-way partnership? Clearly Nathan intended to bring Victoria into the fold.

What deal had they struck? The entire situation baffled her. Kingsley Tech had more than enough resources to develop the land independently. Why share the spoils?

She was about to leave when Nathan spoke again. "Evelyn, do you really think I'd go to such lengths just for a piece of dirt?" He gestured toward the horizon. "This parcel is surrounded by research institutes and elite universities."

"Fully developed, this won't just be land - it'll be the heartbeat of Montecito's future." His voice remained cool but carried an undercurrent of intensity. "Within five years, this district will become the city's economic, academic, and technological nucleus."

"Don't you want a seat at that table?" Nathan stepped out of the vehicle, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. Watching the flicker of interest cross her face, he pressed his advantage.

Evelyn clenched her fists, struggling to contain her rising excitement. His vision was compelling - this wasn't just real estate, but the foundation for what could become Montecito's version of Silicon Valley.

The potential profits were staggering. Yet she refused to let dollar signs cloud her judgment.

With deliberate calm, she met his gaze. "Your blueprint is impressive, Mr. Blackwood. But why include me?" Kingsley Tech could easily dominate this venture alone. If successful, Sterling Corporation would pale in comparison.

So why share the glory?
###Chapter 205: Is This Really a Gift?

Nathan's dark brows furrowed deeply. His stormy gray eyes held depths as unfathomable as the midnight sea. A tense silence stretched between them as his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. After what felt like an eternity, Evelyn finally broke eye contact, her expression carefully schooled into neutrality.

This deal was practically a guaranteed success. Unlike Kingsley Tech's risky AI venture, this project carried minimal risk. So why? Evelyn couldn't comprehend Nathan's sudden generosity. The man hesitated, his jaw tightening.

"There's no particular reason," Nathan finally said, his voice carefully controlled. "The choice is entirely yours." His words sent an inexplicable chill down Evelyn's spine.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Mr. Blackwood," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm, "is this your way of easing your conscience after our divorce?" She could think of no other explanation.

Evelyn's words hung between them like a challenge. If Nathan dared confirm her suspicion, she wouldn't hesitate to slap that arrogant face of his. Would Nathan Blackwood extend such courtesy to any ordinary woman? Was this his twisted way of making amends? Offering billions in profits to soothe his guilty conscience?

How utterly pathetic.

Isabella Montgomery, sensing the escalating tension, suddenly grabbed Evelyn's wrist. "Mr. Blackwood," she interjected smoothly, "surely there's no rush for an answer? For all we know, this could be some elaborate trap of yours." She flashed a diplomatic smile. "Why don't we let Evelyn consult with her board first?"

Evelyn shot her friend a questioning look, to which Isabella responded with a subtle wink. To everyone's surprise, Nathan simply nodded in agreement.

Once safely in the car, Evelyn turned to her friend. "Why did you stop me from getting an answer?"

Isabella rolled her eyes dramatically. "Do you honestly believe Nathan Blackwood would set up some childish trap for you?" When Evelyn remained silent, she pressed on. "Exactly. So why reject what's essentially free money?"

Evelyn's frown deepened. She cared about Nathan's motives. If this was indeed some sort of guilt offering, she wanted no part of it. Isabella sighed, reading her friend's thoughts effortlessly.

"Evie," she said gently, "why does his reason matter so much to you?" The unspoken question hung heavy between them: Had Evelyn truly moved on?

The question hit Evelyn like a bucket of ice water, shocking her back to reality.

"Whether it's compensation or not," Isabella continued pragmatically, "this is a golden opportunity literally falling into your lap. You're not stealing or doing anything unethical. Why on earth would you say no?"

Evelyn blinked, then burst into sudden laughter. "You mercenary little witch!" But she couldn't deny the logic in Isabella's words. What had she been thinking, nearly rejecting such an opportunity?

"Since taking over Sterling Corp," Isabella declared proudly, "I've learned never to let good opportunities slip away." She grinned triumphantly.

"You're absolutely right," Evelyn agreed, a new determination shining in her eyes. "If Nathan wants to throw money at me to ease his conscience, who am I to stop him?" It wasn't as if Sterling Corp wouldn't hold up their end of the bargain.

Though her decision was made, Evelyn chose not to respond immediately. Timing was everything. Later that evening, fresh from her shower, Evelyn's phone rang. The caller ID showed Sebastian Hart.

"Evie!" Sebastian's voice crackled with outrage through the phone. "How could you hand that precious land over to that bastard Nathan Blackwood?!"
###Chapter 206 Prince Charming Sebastian

The moment Evelyn heard Sebastian's frustrated groan through the phone, a smirk curled her lips. Her perfectly arched eyebrows lifted in amusement.

That troublesome acquisition had nearly burned her fingers. If he wanted it so badly, he could have it.

"Then I got beaten up for nothing!" Sebastian's aggrieved wail crackled through the line. His voice dropped to a wounded whisper. "You didn't even bother to visit me."

Evelyn's smirk deepened. "Prince Charming Hart, what exactly would my visit accomplish?"

Silence. Then a sharp intake of breath.

She could practically see his face flushing crimson with rage. His next words came out through gritted teeth. "Evie, how dare you mock me?"

A soft laugh escaped her. "Don't be such a drama queen."

"Just stay home and reflect on your mistakes. Next time, you might not even have the strength to dial my number." The line went dead with an angry click.

Sebastian probably felt like that call had shaved years off his life.

Outside, night had fallen. Evelyn skimmed through a stack of documents before retiring. Sleep claimed her effortlessly.

Dawn painted the sky in soft hues when she awoke. Stretching languidly, Evelyn slipped out of bed. Bennett arrived promptly with the car, whisking her away to the grand opening of the Global Summit Center.

Documents occupied her during the short ride. Before she knew it, they'd arrived.

Inside the Summit Center's exhibition hall, the ceremony unfolded with understated elegance. Only specially invited members of high society graced the event. Evelyn declined the Chairman's personal greeting with a polite smile.

Stepping out of the car, she moved toward the art exhibition with Bennett at her side. Diverse artistic styles - romantic, realist, abstract - coexisted harmoniously within semi-partitioned spaces.

Most pieces displayed were priceless collector's items, elevating their allure. Evelyn paused before nearly every painting, absorbing each masterpiece with quiet intensity.

Noticing her absorption, Bennett drifted toward his own favorites.

Evelyn reached the final display - a massive canvas shrouded in black velvet. Assuming a staff oversight, she lifted a corner with the provided tool.

Gold-encrusted doors materialized from darkness, slightly ajar. Light spilled through the gap like a blade piercing night's throat. Before the doors stood a woman's silhouette.

Clad in crimson, her curves accentuated by the dress's plunge, the figure's waves of hair cascaded down bare shoulders. The red fabric bled into surrounding shadows.

Breath caught in Evelyn's throat. The painting's oppressive anticipation struck like a physical blow. Conflicting emotions tangled in her chest - familiarity warring with unease.

The exquisite tension between weight and levity left her unsettled. Her fingers stiffened. Vision locked onto the canvas, she stood transfixed.

"Evelyn?" A melodic voice interrupted her trance.

She turned automatically, smile blooming at the sight of Eleanor Hart - Sebastian's mother, recently returned from her Swiss vacation glowing with health.

"It is you! That silhouette looked unmistakably familiar."

Evelyn embraced the older woman warmly before noticing her companion. Victoria Ashford stood stiffly beside Eleanor. Evelyn's smile widened. "Ms. Ashford. What a coincidence."

Victoria's responding smile never reached her eyes. Their first encounter had ended with Victoria's humiliation. Neither woman pretended otherwise.

Yet decorum prevailed before Eleanor. "Ms. Sinclair. I didn't realize you appreciated fine art."

Evelyn chuckled at the barb. "Did you assume I only appreciate stock portfolios, Ms. Ashford?"

Eleanor blinked, sensing the frost between them. Before she could intervene, the curator hurried over.

"Mrs. Hart, Ms. Sinclair, my sincerest apologies for the inadequate reception. Have any pieces particularly captivated you?"

Victoria seized the opportunity. "This one's exceptional. Mrs. Hart admires it too. Allow me to purchase it for you."

Eleanor demurred. "Oh darling, that's too generous—"

But Victoria, eager to curry favor, turned to the curator. "I'll take this painting. Have it wrapped."

The curator shook his head apologetically. "I'm afraid that's impossible."
###Chapter 207 You're Making Me Look Bad

The gallery curator adjusted his glasses. "This particular piece is one of Master von Strauss's rare creations. He seldom parts with his works." His voice dropped to a whisper. "And if you look closely here—"

Their conversation was interrupted by the rhythmic tapping of an ebony cane. An elderly gentleman with a snow-white beard approached with deliberate steps. Friedrich von Strauss was originally from Montecito but had settled in Liberty decades ago.

His reputation preceded him. Eleanor Hart, Sebastian's mother, recognized the legendary artist immediately. Among high society women, collecting masterpieces was as essential as owning designer jewelry.

Without valuable art in one's collection, one risked being labeled nouveau riche. Yet von Strauss's works weren't commodities that could simply be purchased. The eccentric artist was notoriously selective about his buyers.

Eleanor's mind raced. If I could acquire one of his paintings, my standing among the elite would skyrocket. Before she could formulate a plan, the white-bearded maestro stood before them.

The curator bowed slightly. "Master von Strauss, what an honor." The artist acknowledged the greeting with a curt nod, his piercing blue eyes scanning the group dismissively. Without a word, he reached for the painting on display.

Victoria Ashford noticed Eleanor's covetous gaze. Seizing the opportunity, she stepped forward boldly. "Excuse me, what's your asking price for this piece? I'm interested in purchasing it."

Von Strauss's bushy eyebrows knitted together as he regarded Victoria. "You couldn't possibly afford it," he scoffed, attempting to brush past her.

Victoria's cheeks burned. As CEO of Ashford Enterprises, she wasn't accustomed to being dismissed. "Name your price, then we'll see what I can or cannot afford," she challenged, her tone icy.

The old artist snorted. "Money can't buy taste, young lady. Selling to you would tarnish my legacy." His cane tapped impatiently. "Go deface someone else's artwork."

Humiliation washed over Victoria. Being insulted in front of Eleanor was unbearable. The air grew thick with tension.

Von Strauss's gaze suddenly landed on Evelyn. His stern expression softened slightly. "And you? Are you here to waste my time as well?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a wry smile. "No, I'm just another filthy rich heiress apparently."

To everyone's shock, the old man burst into laughter. Victoria's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Why offer it to her if you won't sell to me?" she demanded.

"Because she's got spirit!" von Strauss declared, as if it were the most obvious answer in the world. Victoria looked ready to combust.

Eleanor discreetly nudged Evelyn. Don't refuse! I need that painting! Evelyn hesitated, then sighed.

"Alright, how much?" she asked reluctantly. This wasn't about one-upping Victoria—Eleanor's desperate expression made that clear. As Sebastian's mother, Evelyn couldn't ignore the request.

The artist stroked his beard. "I sold a piece to European royalty for nine million pounds. What's your offer?"

Gasps echoed through the gallery. Even Victoria looked stunned. Nine million for a single painting? That's museum acquisition territory.

Evelyn studied the artwork critically. "It's worth every penny," she conceded. Seeing Eleanor's hopeful gaze, she made her decision. "I'll double it," she said casually, as if discussing lunch plans. "No point being stingy."

Von Strauss coughed in surprise. "Such extravagance!" he muttered, though his eyes twinkled with amusement.

Evelyn shrugged. "Only the best for true art."

After a dramatic pause, the artist suddenly scowled. "Changed my mind. Not selling to you either!" He turned sharply on his heel.

Victoria smirked triumphantly. "Seems we're in the same boat after all." Eleanor wrung her hands in distress.

Evelyn exhaled deeply. This stubborn old man... With quick steps, she intercepted von Strauss. Placing a hand on his arm, she fixed him with an imploring look. "Master von Strauss, you're really putting me in an impossible position here..."
###Chapter 208 The Ridiculous Family Gathering

Evelyn Sinclair's thoughts raced. Old Master? The way Friedrich addressed the elderly gentleman carried such resignation, yet held an undeniable familiarity.

The guests exchanged startled glances.

The white-bearded Friedrich von Strauss finally halted his steps. A subtle smile danced in his refined gaze.

He snorted coldly.

Yet his tone carried unmistakable reproach and regret. "Someone who abandoned their studies halfway doesn't deserve to call themselves my apprentice!" Friedrich had only ever taken one apprentice in his lifetime.

Evelyn possessed an extraordinary soul, her talent surpassing ordinary people a hundredfold. Every brushstroke in her paintings brimmed with breathtaking vitality.

Yet after barely six months under Friedrich's tutelage, Evelyn had abandoned painting to pursue business ventures.

The master who had finally broken his lifelong rule of taking no students had been so furious he couldn't eat for days.

The disappointment still burned! "How dare she ask to purchase my artwork? In her dreams!" Friedrich had intended this encounter to teach Evelyn a harsh lesson.

But when the infuriating girl pouted, his accumulated anger evaporated instantly.

"Old Master? Apprentice? Evelyn, what's going on? How do you know Mr. von Strauss?" Eleanor Hart's mind swirled with unanswered questions.

Victoria Ashford pieced together their relationship from the exchange. A flicker of disappointment crossed her features.

She hesitated momentarily before lifting her gaze. "Master von Strauss, don't you still possess numerous private collections not released to the public? I find 'The Radiant Dawn' particularly exquisite."

"Perhaps you might consider selling it to me?" Friedrich's mouth twitched imperceptibly. The audacity! His private collection pieces were reserved either for auction or permanent exhibition.

Each was priceless! 'The Radiant Dawn' had been displayed at the Louvre! And she spoke of acquiring it as casually as browsing a flea market? His fury reignited instantly.

Yet facing Evelyn's radiant smile, his resolve crumbled. The elderly master glared daggers at her for several heartbeats before releasing a derisive snort.

"I planned to auction it for five million. For you? Ten."

"Take it if you want!" With that, Friedrich spun on his heel and marched away before his temper could shorten his lifespan.

This outcome stunned Evelyn. Against all expectations, Friedrich hadn't extorted her. The price fell far below 'The Radiant Dawn's' true value. Evelyn turned her smile toward Eleanor. "Mrs. Hart, please consider this my gift to you."

Then she hurried after the retreating artist, fearing he might change his mind. During their return, Victoria observed Eleanor's delighted expression with growing discomfort.

"Mrs. Hart," she interjected smoothly, "if I recall correctly, 'The Radiant Dawn' originally sold for ten million. Is Evelyn truly that close with Master von Strauss?" Eleanor's smile faltered.

"Oh? What exactly are you implying? Would the master sell her a forgery?"

"Certainly not! I merely worry their closeness might... influence the authenticity. It could be a practice piece or flawed work."

Such pieces held modest value but paled against genuine masterworks.

Eleanor's breath hitched. Victoria offered a consoling smile. "Though perhaps I'm mistaken. I've heard Master von Strauss marks all authentic works with his distinctive seal in the bottom right corner."

"You'll know when you see it."

Nodding absently, Eleanor formulated a plan. She deliberately roused Sebastian from his exaggerated convalescence in bed.

Eleanor announced a family gathering at their estate. Sebastian groaned dramatically, refusing to rise, his petulant whines grating on her nerves.

"Family gathering? What absurd notion is this? I've specially invited Evelyn and Victoria. Don't attend if you'd rather not."

At Evelyn's name, Sebastian transformed instantly, vitality surging through him like a revived man.
###Chapter 209 Stay Away From My Son

Evelyn Sinclair hesitated when the invitation to the Hart family banquet arrived. Knowing Sebastian Hart's growing affection for her, she instinctively wanted to maintain distance from the influential family.

Yet part of her reasoned this might simply be a gracious gesture to thank her for the masterpiece she'd acquired—The Radiant Dawn. Declining would appear unnecessarily suspicious.

Upon arriving at the Hart estate, Evelyn was startled to find Victoria Ashford already present, chatting animatedly with Reginald Hart and Eleanor Hart. She presented the carefully wrapped painting.

Eleanor accepted it with practiced grace, her smile faltering for a split second as she glimpsed the artwork. The reaction was so fleeting Evelyn nearly missed it.

After greeting the patriarch, Evelyn heard rapid footsteps descending the marble staircase. Sebastian appeared, boyish excitement lighting his features. "Evie! I just found our old school photos—remember when we dressed as bride and groom for that play?"

Evelyn stiffened.

With Victoria watching, she couldn't afford such casual intimacy. "That was a costume, Sebastian. For A Midsummer Night's Dream." She shot him a warning glance.

Eleanor set the painting aside with deliberate care. "Mind your manners, Sebastian. Ms. Ashford has been waiting patiently for your attention."

Victoria's gaze lingered on Sebastian's star-bright eyes—that particular warmth he reserved only for Evelyn. Her manicured nails dug into her palms.

"It's quite alright," Victoria forced a laugh. "We're practically old friends." The words tasted like ash.

Sebastian offered polite pleasantries before his attention inevitably drifted back to Evelyn. Reginald engaged her in lively conversation while Eleanor's demeanor turned glacial—a stark contrast to her warmth toward Victoria.

After dinner, Victoria volunteered to prepare dessert. Eleanor practically dragged Sebastian to assist, leaving Evelyn alone in the sitting room. The moment the door closed, Eleanor's mask slipped.

She slid a check across the coffee table.

Evelyn examined the sum—ten million dollars—and frowned. "I don't understand."

Eleanor's laugh was razor-sharp. "Consider it payment for that... piece you brought. Though we both know it's not worth half that amount."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her teacup. The Radiant Dawn was valued at over a hundred million. "You believe it's counterfeit?"

"Don't play naive." Eleanor's gaze turned venomous. "I've tolerated your closeness to my son out of respect for your late mother. But passing off forgeries? That crosses lines."

The mention of her mother sent icy rage through Evelyn's veins. She stood abruptly. "Since my gift offends you, I'll take it back."

Eleanor's voice turned deadly quiet. "Take the money. And stay away from Sebastian."
###Chapter 210 The Final Ultimatum

Evelyn Sinclair froze mid-step when the words hit her.

This wasn't the first time she'd received such a warning.

The initial one had come from Margaret Blackwood right before her doomed marriage to Nathan.

Now it was Eleanor Hart - Sebastian's mother - delivering the same chilling message.

Evelyn studied Eleanor's composed features. The warmth from earlier had evaporated, revealing the cold calculation beneath.

Her stomach twisted. She'd genuinely respected this woman.

"Mrs. Hart," Evelyn's voice dripped with icy amusement, "is this your way of telling me to back off?"

Eleanor's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Interpret it however you wish, dear. My son nearly lost his position on the board because of you."

Evelyn's breath caught.

"That fifty billion dollar island purchase? It almost destroyed everything he's built. His grandfather wanted him removed entirely."

The revelation struck like a physical blow. She'd thought her intervention had helped.

"Evelyn, had this been before your divorce, I might have welcomed you. But now?" Eleanor's gaze flicked toward the kitchen where Victoria Ashford was pretending not to listen. "With your scandal-ridden past? You're the worst possible match for my son."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips.

Why bother with the charade? Just say I'm not good enough for your precious heir.

Her eyes darted between Sebastian's impatient stance and Victoria's calculated movements. The chessboard became clear.

"So you've already chosen his bride?" Evelyn's voice turned lethal. "And I'm the inconvenient obstacle?"

Eleanor didn't deny it. "Victoria comes from an impeccable family. She's accomplished, graceful, and most importantly..." Her gaze turned pointed. "Untainted."

Evelyn's lips curled into a predator's smile. She leaned down, bringing them eye-to-eye.

"Sebastian and I were never compatible anyway. Though I suppose intelligence is hereditary - from the mother's side."

Eleanor's composure cracked. "How dare you!"

Evelyn straightened, smoothing her blazer. "Let me make one thing crystal clear, Mrs. Hart. I've never encouraged your son. We've been friends for years, but that's all we'll ever be."

Her fingers tightened around her purse. "Perhaps you should focus on convincing him to move on. For his own good."

Experience had taught her the weight of family disapproval. She'd suffered enough under the Blackwoods' contempt.

And Sebastian? Their friendship had ended the moment his feelings changed.

Evelyn snatched up The Radiant Dawn painting from the side table. "We're done here."

She ignored Eleanor's sputtered protests.

Enough tolerating everyone's nonsense.

The engine of her Aston Martin roared to life. Sebastian came sprinting from the house.

"Evelyn! At least let me drive you—"

Her tires screeched as she peeled away.

Sterling Corporation's elevator doors slid open with a vengeance.

Bennett intercepted her before she reached the office. "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood is—"

"Tell him I'm unavailable."

Her assistant winced. "He's already..."

A deep voice cut through the tension. "Unavailable?"

Evelyn whirled.

Nathan Blackwood leaned against her office doorframe, his tailored suit doing nothing to soften his predatory stance.

Bennett swallowed hard. "Mr. Blackwood insisted on waiting outside your office rather than the lounge. If you'd let me finish—"

Evelyn didn't bother with excuses. She met Nathan's piercing gaze head-on.

"Mr. Blackwood." Her voice could frost glass. "Shall we?"
###Chapter 211 Who Defines the Rules?

Bennett held open the office door as Evelyn Sinclair strode in with effortless grace. Every movement carried an air of unshakable confidence that made lesser men shrink in comparison. The way her stiletto heels clicked against the marble floor sounded like a countdown to someone's demise.

Nathan Blackwood's breath hitched as the memory surfaced unbidden—that mysterious woman in crimson at the Monaco gala years ago, her face obscured by shadows yet radiating undeniable power. The way light had spilled from the doorway behind her like liquid gold...

"Mr. Blackwood?" Bennett's polite prompt snapped him back to the present. The assistant's outstretched arm directed him into an office that smelled faintly of peonies and expensive stationery.

Evelyn's workspace was a study in contrasts—sleek modern furniture softened by whimsical touches. A marble sculpture of a panther wore a crown of fresh pink peonies today, their petals brushing against quarterly reports. Nathan's lips twitched. So this was how the Ice Queen of Sterling Corp ruled her empire.

Sinking into the plush sofa, Evelyn crossed her legs with the precision of a guillotine blade falling. "To what do I owe this unexpected visit?" Her tone could freeze champagne.

Nathan's gaze darkened like storm clouds over the Pacific. "The Pacific Heights project. Have you reconsidered our partnership?"

Evelyn's manicured finger tapped the sofa armrest once. Twice. The rhythm of a chess player contemplating her next move. "You flew from New York to San Francisco for that?" Her laugh was sharper than the diamonds at her ears. "How... quaint."

The air between them crackled with unsaid words. Nathan remained statue-still, his custom Tom Ford suit failing to conceal the coiled tension in his frame. "Time is money, Evelyn. We shouldn't delay this decision."

A shadow crossed Evelyn's face as she remembered yesterday's disastrous lunch with the Harts. That simpering Victoria Ashford had been there, dripping honeyed words into Sebastian's ear while shooting Evelyn venomous glances. Coincidence? Hardly.

"Here's my offer," Evelyn said suddenly, leaning forward like a panther scenting blood. "I'll join your little project—on one condition."

Nathan's eyebrow arched a fraction. In the world of high-stakes deals, he was accustomed to dictating terms, not receiving them. Yet something about Evelyn's glacial composure made him hold his tongue.

"Victoria Ashford gets removed from the equation." Evelyn's voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "Permanently."

The silence that followed could have been measured on the Richter scale. Nathan's expression remained impassive, but his knuckles whitened around his coffee cup. "Explain."

Evelyn swirled her espresso, watching the dark liquid cling to the porcelain. "Don't play dumb, Nathan. You only approached Sterling Corp because of our... history." She met his gaze head-on. "Consider this your one chance at redemption."

A muscle jumped in Nathan's jaw. In any other boardroom, such audacity would have gotten the speaker blacklisted from every Fortune 500 company. Yet Evelyn sat there, utterly unfazed, her Valentino-clad legs crossed as if discussing the weather.

"Why her?" Nathan finally ground out.

Evelyn's smile could have frosted the windows. "Let's just say Miss Ashford and I have different definitions of fair play." She set down her cup with deliberate precision. "So? Is your precious project worth sacrificing your golden girl for?"

The antique clock on the wall ticked like a time bomb. Outside, the San Francisco skyline glittered indifferently. Two of the most powerful CEOs in the country sat three feet apart, the fate of a billion-dollar deal hanging between them.

Finally, Nathan leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper that raised goosebumps along Evelyn's arms. "Tell me, Evelyn—since when do you believe in playing fair?"

Her laughter was colder than the fog rolling in from the bay. "Oh Nathan, darling. Whoever said anything about playing?"
###Chapter 212 The Forgotten Vows

Nathan's jaw tightened. After a brief hesitation, he gave a stiff nod. "Fine." He accepted her compensation demands without question, though implementing them would require some maneuvering.

Yet relief washed over him. If she's willing to accept my reparations, does that mean there's still hope for us? Evelyn showed no surprise at his immediate agreement.

She rose gracefully, moving behind her mahogany desk. "I'll have my legal team draft the agreement with Blackwood Enterprises."

"Let's keep this collaboration confidential for now." Nathan had been thinking the same. The project was too nascent for public scrutiny.

From Evelyn's posture, she was clearly preparing to dismiss him. With their fragile truce newly formed, he knew better than to overstay his welcome.

Nathan stood, adjusting his suit sleeves. "I should—" His words died as his gaze locked onto the bronze sculpture behind her.

His breath caught. The modernist tree sculpture was unmistakably the work of renowned Swedish artist Lars Magnusson, known for his reinterpretation of Baroque motifs.

But it wasn't the sculpture's six-figure price tag that froze his blood.

Sunlight streaming through the window caught on something dangling from one bronze branch—a diamond solitaire ring suspended by its platinum band.

His lost wedding ring.

Nathan's lungs constricted. The ring he'd mourned losing years ago... here, in Evelyn's office?

Evelyn glanced up impatiently. "Mr. Blackwood, if we're finished—" She broke off, frowning at his expression.

Nathan moved forward like a man in a trance. His lips parted soundlessly, chest heavy as if filled with lead. When his dark eyes met Evelyn's, her immediate recoil made his stomach drop.

He reached toward the paired rings—his and hers—displayed like museum pieces. Evelyn reacted like he'd drawn a weapon.

"Don't!" She shoved him back with surprising strength, making him stumble. Her icy glare kept him from approaching again.

Pain and confusion warred in Nathan's shadowed eyes. Evelyn's voice could have frosted glass. "Our business is concluded."

Every second he remained threatened to resurrect ghosts she'd buried long ago. That naive girl who'd loved Nathan Blackwood? She refused to be her anymore.

"Evelyn," he rasped, "why is my ring here?" The question tore from him. "I lost it years ago. How—"

"My ring," she corrected sharply. What had their marriage been, really? Two signatures on legal documents. She'd bought these rings herself, just as she'd borne the pain alone.

When she'd offered her heart, he'd discarded it like yesterday's newspaper. What claim did he have now?

Nathan's lips pressed into a bloodless line. Years of suppressed regret surfaced in his haunted expression. "I'm sorry." The words felt woefully inadequate.

Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Save your apologies. Your signature on that contract tells me everything I need to know."

Adults settled things with contracts and compensation, not sentimental drivel. Isabella had been right—cold hard cash healed most wounds.

Nathan's gaze returned to the rings, polished to museum-quality brilliance. "How did they end up here?" The question was barely audible.

The matching bands gleamed mockingly in the sunlight, pristine as the day she'd bought them. A monument to broken promises.
###Chapter 213: The Deception Unveiled

Nathan Blackwood couldn't comprehend how his lost ring had ended up in Evelyn Sinclair's possession. Her gaze flickered briefly, betraying her reluctance to answer the question.

She had no desire to engage with Nathan any longer than necessary.

With a dismissive tone, she finally spoke.

"I assumed you already knew. Vanessa Holloway returned it to me one morning."

"She claimed you were drunk the night before and spent it at her place. You carelessly discarded the ring, so she took it upon herself to return it to me."

Evelyn would never forget that moment—the first time she had truly despaired over their marriage. The memory still carried the weight of her sorrow, anger, and helplessness.

Thankfully, she had moved past that darkness.

Now, as she studied the flicker of confusion and pain in Nathan's eyes, she scoffed inwardly.

How foolish of me to think he could ever feel anything for me.

Even if he did experience pain, it certainly wasn't because of her.

Her expression remained icy as she regarded him.

"Mr. Blackwood, you must have despised me three years ago. My gift was nothing but a burden to you. There's no need for me to return it now."

The words tasted bitter on her tongue.

"No." His voice was low, barely audible.

The emotions in his eyes fractured slightly, his body tense, the air around him turning frigid.

Nathan couldn't recall ever spending a drunken night at Vanessa Holloway's place.

This never happened.

Vanessa had lied.

A surge of fury burned through him.

That deceitful woman. I should never have shown her any kindness.

His jaw tightened as he spoke urgently.

"She's lying. I never stayed at her place. I never sought her out after drinking."

Panic clawed at him, but Evelyn only smiled faintly, indifferent.

"Is that so?"

Her disbelief was evident, though she had no interest in pursuing the matter.

The truth no longer mattered.

She didn’t care about what had—or hadn’t—happened between them back then.

Nathan’s next words lodged in his throat.

She didn’t want his explanations.

"I know you hate me," he murmured, his gaze heavy. "If there’s any way I can make it up to you, I will."

He wanted to say more, but the words wouldn’t come.

Evelyn’s lips curled in a cold, detached smile.

His words meant nothing to her.

"Your agreement to my terms is compensation enough. Once this project is finished, we’ll be even."

They would never owe each other anything again.

Without waiting for his response, she pressed the intercom.

"Bennett, please escort Mr. Blackwood out."

"Yes, Ms. Sinclair."

Her assistant arrived within seconds, knocking politely before entering.

The tension in the room was palpable, but Bennett remained professional.

"Mr. Blackwood, this way."

After Nathan left, Evelyn sat in silence, absorbing the lingering traces of his presence.

She had finally drawn a line between herself and the past she had once longed for.

Unrequited love was a lesson she had learned the hard way.

No amount of heartache would change the fact that he had never loved her.

Nathan Blackwood would never love Evelyn Sinclair.

She picked up the ring from the bronze tree branch and walked to the window.

Without hesitation, she drew back her hand—and let it fall.
###Chapter 214 On the Wrong Side

Sebastian Hart and Reginald Hart exchanged puzzled glances as Evelyn Sinclair abruptly excused herself from the gathering.

This was unlike Evelyn. She had always been the epitome of grace and decorum.

Under Reginald's intense scrutiny, Eleanor Hart finally broke down and confessed everything - about the counterfeit painting and Victoria Ashford's obvious infatuation with Sebastian.

Reginald's face darkened with fury. His daughter-in-law Eleanor had always been the perfect society wife, never causing a single scandal.

This unexpected betrayal cut deep. How could she be so foolish? Reginald immediately contacted art experts to obtain photographs of The Radiant Dawn currently displayed at the World Museum.

This masterpiece was created by Friedrich von Strauss during his artistic prime. Every brushstroke was deliberate, every hue meticulously chosen to create a breathtaking whole.

After careful consideration, von Strauss had deliberately left this work unsigned, making The Radiant Dawn his most valuable and unique creation.

Eleanor turned deathly pale as the truth dawned on her. She recalled how she had humiliated Evelyn earlier. What a colossal mistake!

But surely Victoria... Eleanor hesitated. Victoria must have meant well, right?

Reginald saw through her thoughts instantly. "That woman became CEO of Ashford Enterprises before she turned eighteen," he scoffed. "Do you really think you could handle being her mother-in-law?"

"Even if Sebastian married her - which he won't - our company would likely be swallowed by Ashford Enterprises within a year."

Eleanor's face fell. She was just an ordinary socialite - how could she possibly measure up to a powerhouse like Victoria?

"Father, I..." Eleanor's voice trembled with regret. If only she hadn't been so harsh with Evelyn.

"From now on, you will stay away from Victoria Ashford," Reginald commanded. "Business dealings with Ashford Enterprises will be handled by Sebastian and me."

"And you will find an opportunity to apologize to the Sterlings. Whether in New York or San Francisco, Sterling Corporation is our most valuable partner!"

At Sterling Corporation headquarters, Evelyn had just concluded a board meeting when Lucas Sterling called.

"The Harts sent over an entire truckload of gifts. Strange, isn't it?" Lucas remarked.

"Sebastian?" Evelyn asked in surprise. "He usually sends them directly to my office."

"No, these are from Mrs. Hart." Eleanor? Evelyn frowned slightly.

Perhaps she finally discovered the truth about The Radiant Dawn. Unfortunately, it was too late - the painting now hung proudly in her father's study.

But Evelyn wasn't truly upset about the earlier incident. She knew Victoria Ashford had orchestrated the entire situation.

Cutting ties with the Hart family would only play into Victoria's hands. Evelyn chuckled at the thought.

"Have Archibald send appropriate gifts in return," she instructed Lucas.

Just then, Bennett knocked and entered. "President, Ms. Victoria Ashford is here to see you."

Evelyn's eyebrows arched in amusement. "How prompt. Unexpected."

Victoria was no Sophia Blackwood - she wouldn't resort to tears and hysterics when cornered. This confrontation promised to be interesting.

"Show her in."

Victoria entered with the commanding presence of a queen, her cold aura filling the room. Evelyn remained seated, unfazed.

"What an unexpected pleasure, Ms. Ashford."

Victoria took the seat opposite Evelyn without waiting for an invitation. The air between the two powerful women crackled with tension.

"Would you care for some refreshments? Coffee? Tea?"

"Spare me the pleasantries," Victoria snapped, her hands slamming onto Evelyn's desk as she leaned forward. "Did you pressure Nathan Blackwood to remove me from the Pacific Heights project?"

Her piercing gaze burned with barely contained fury. "And was it you who convinced Eleanor Hart to cut all contact with me?"

The intimidating presence that had cowered countless business rivals rolled off Evelyn like water. She met Victoria's glare with calm amusement.

The battle lines were drawn.
###Chapter 215 I'm a Woman Without Morals

Hearing this, Evelyn Sinclair lifted her gaze with an absentminded smile. "I admit to the first one."

As for the latter, you've truly wronged me. A devilish smirk curled her lips, her eyes glinting with barely concealed amusement.

It was clear now—Victoria Ashford must have realized she'd been played.

Victoria hadn't even answered Eleanor Hart's calls? How ruthless.

Her cold, stern eyes bore into Evelyn as she pressed on.

"Who do you think you are, getting Nathan Blackwood to cut me out of that deal?" Victoria's voice was sharp with fury. "Do you have any idea how much effort I put into breaking into the San Francisco market and securing that connection?"

She hadn't bothered with small companies—she'd gone straight for Kingsley Tech.

It had taken meticulous planning to earn Nathan Blackwood's trust and approval. And yet, Evelyn had dismantled it all with just a few words.

How could Victoria not be furious?

Evelyn let out a light laugh, her expression dripping with disdain.

"Your so-called effort was telling Nathan that you could make Sebastian Hart completely give up on me?"

Victoria stiffened, shock flickering across her face.

How did she know?

The icy smile on Evelyn's lips widened.

"Ms. Ashford, your methods are truly… remarkable." Her tone was mocking. "I'm genuinely curious—where did you get the confidence that you could win over the famously fickle Sebastian Hart?"

Victoria had come prepared, armed with research on everyone's preferences and personalities. But she had overestimated herself.

If Sebastian hadn't been interested in her from the start, what made her think he would be now?

Evelyn had no intention of meddling in their affairs—but Victoria had dragged her into it.

"How do you know about that?" Victoria demanded. Nathan wasn't the type to share private conversations.

Evelyn pulled out her phone and waved it lazily.

"Funny coincidence. The night you and Nathan were talking at the Velvet Lounge, a friend of mine happened to be in the next booth."

That friend was Natalie Beaumont.

Natalie had only remembered the conversation days later and immediately called Evelyn. Everything clicked into place.

Victoria's face hardened, her composure slipping.

Even now, she refused to crumble. "I underestimated you, Evelyn."

She had assumed Evelyn was just another spoiled heiress, sheltered by her family. Even if Evelyn held power at Sterling Corporation, Victoria had thought her naive to the cutthroat nature of business.

But Evelyn had outplayed her.

"Ms. Ashford, I think you simply overestimated yourself."

Evelyn arched a brow, a soft laugh escaping her.

"You really thought a few well-placed rumors and some poison in Eleanor Hart's ear would make Sebastian marry you?"

Victoria's expression darkened at Evelyn's bluntness.

Her restraint snapped.

"Evelyn, you were in love with Nathan once. How can you not understand how I feel? I've loved Sebastian for ten years!" Her voice trembled with barely suppressed emotion. "I've watched him with other women and never cared—but with you, it's different."

Her jaw clenched, her face pale with anguish.

"The way he looks at you… If you don't love him, let him go. Why string him along? Why stop me from loving him?"

Evelyn studied Victoria's near-hysterical outburst with cool detachment.

Her gaze sharpened, a dangerous glint beneath the calm.

So that was it? Victoria resented her for this?

Evelyn couldn't help but scoff.

Was this another attempt at emotional blackmail?

She tapped a finger against the desk, her voice cutting.

"Ms. Ashford, don't bother trying to guilt-trip me. It won't work." A slow, wicked smile curved her lips. "I'm a woman without morals."

Evelyn Sinclair had never lost an argument.

And she wasn't about to start now.


###Chapter 216

Evelyn's thoughts raced. Victoria had been infatuated with Sebastian for a decade? No wonder she's been so hostile and bitter toward me.

She studied Victoria's rigid expression and felt an unexpected pang of sympathy.

While Evelyn pitied the woman, she didn't regret her actions.

Meeting Victoria's gaze squarely, Evelyn spoke firmly. "Ms. Ashford, please don't project your romantic disappointments onto me. Your unrequited feelings and Sebastian's disinterest existed long before I entered the picture. I'm not the homewrecker in this scenario, so I won't accept your misplaced blame."

Life wasn't about who could play the victim better.

Evelyn and Victoria were fundamentally different.

Both had experienced unreciprocated love, but Evelyn had fought for Nathan openly, declaring her feelings without reservation.

Victoria, meanwhile, had spent ten years pining silently for Sebastian without ever making her move.

"But he chooses you!" Victoria spat the words like an accusation.

Evelyn shook her head in exasperation. "Ms. Ashford, listen to yourself. His feelings for me aren't my fault. What exactly have I done wrong? If he doesn't return your affection, why can't you let him go?"

Why did Victoria need to invent excuses for her failed romance?

Did shifting blame onto Evelyn somehow make rejection easier to bear?

What twisted logic was that?

Evelyn had initially respected Victoria as a formidable businesswoman.

This petty, vindictive side came as an unpleasant surprise.

She had no interest in continuing this pointless conversation.

"Ms. Ashford, we're done here. If you'd like, I can arrange a meeting with Sebastian so you can express your feelings directly. We're all adults - you should be able to handle whatever outcome emerges. If there's potential, pursue it. If not, stop wasting everyone's time. What do you say?"

Evelyn believed this was the most mature solution.

Better than Victoria's current approach of covert hostility without ever knowing where she stood.

A flicker of hesitation crossed Victoria's face before vanishing. "You just want to humiliate me in front of him, don't you?"

That response told Evelyn everything she needed to know.

She shrugged, her expression cooling. "Never mind then." The woman clearly wasn't interested in reason. "Do as you please. I've extended an olive branch. You have no authority to interfere with my business operations here, and no foothold in this market."

Victoria wouldn't gain anything by staying. Evelyn's dismissal couldn't have been clearer.

New York City had no place for Victoria Ashford.

Victoria's glare turned glacial, her presence radiating dangerous intensity.

The atmosphere grew heavy with unspoken threats.

"Fine," Victoria hissed. "Don't say I didn't warn you."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, meeting Victoria's stare without flinching.

Since when had Victoria ever shown her grace?

"Bennett, please see our guest out."

Victoria departed with unsettling quietness.

Later, Bennett reported that Victoria had returned to Ashford Enterprises' headquarters in Santa Barbara.

Evelyn raised an eyebrow in surprise. "She left just like that? Unexpected... but convenient. At least I'll have some peace now."

At an upscale business cocktail party...

Evelyn arrived with Isabella, only to encounter Sebastian and his mother Eleanor.

Eleanor visibly startled upon seeing Evelyn.

Recovering quickly, she approached with outstretched hands. "Evelyn darling! I've missed you terribly. I've asked Sebastian to invite you over countless times. Why haven't you visited?"

Evelyn thought dryly, Because I prefer avoiding unnecessary drama.

Outwardly, she maintained perfect composure, offering a polished smile. "Mrs. Hart, I've been swamped with work lately. Besides, Sebastian should be focusing on his recovery."

Seeing no resentment in Evelyn's expression, Eleanor exhaled in relief.

She longed to mention The Radiant Dawn again but couldn't find the words.

Evelyn pointedly avoided the subject as well.

Left with no alternative, Eleanor swallowed her regret in silence.

After exchanging pleasantries, they moved on. When Sebastian approached, Eleanor tactfully excused herself.

Evelyn finally dropped her polite facade, rolling her eyes at Sebastian. "Had enough of playing invalid?"

Sebastian's lips curved into a roguish grin, all charm and mischief. "Miss me?"
###Chapter 217

Evelyn Sinclair cast Sebastian Hart a frosty smile.

Let him think whatever he wanted.

She had considered telling Sebastian about Victoria Ashford, but after a moment’s hesitation, she dismissed the idea. I can’t even handle my own mess.

Isabella Montgomery finished greeting the other guests and discreetly slipped over, gripping Evelyn’s wrist. "Evie, I just saw Nathan Blackwood!"

Evelyn’s brows twitched slightly. It wasn’t surprising that Nathan would be here.

Though she had no desire to see him, she wasn’t about to make a scene over it.

Isabella bit her lip and added, "My mother is forcing me to go on a blind date with the man standing next to Nathan!"

Evelyn nearly choked on her wine.

Sebastian’s eyes widened in shock.

It took them both a moment to process Isabella’s words. Isabella Montgomery—agreeing to a blind date?!

Isabella sighed. "She gave me no choice. I don’t even like him, but our families are discussing a marriage alliance."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted with worry for her best friend.

Sebastian, however, looked almost envious, nudging Evelyn with a smirk. "If only our families were this traditional. Wouldn’t that be perfect?"

"Get lost!" Evelyn and Isabella snapped in unison.

How could he joke at a time like this? Worst friend ever.

"Evie, you have to help me!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Of course I want to, but I can’t exactly march up to the elders of both families and demand they call it off, can I?"

Isabella’s eyes gleamed with mischief. She leaned in and whispered her plan.

Evelyn’s lips twitched. This girl… She wants me to publicly humiliate her blind date?!

"My reputation is already in ruins," Evelyn hissed. "And you want to drag it through the mud even more?"

Isabella tugged at her sleeve helplessly. "But who else can I ask? If it were just any woman, his family would sweep it under the rug. But you—they wouldn’t dare retaliate against you!"

Sebastian watched the two whispering, completely clueless about their scheming.

Just then, someone approached with a drink and pulled him away.

Evelyn hesitated. "But if word gets out—"

"Don’t worry, no one will secretly film you here. Just make sure people see you!"

All they needed was proof that this man was shameless enough to flirt with Evelyn Sinclair.

Isabella pleaded, and Evelyn finally relented with a clenched jaw.

"Fine! For you, I’ll play the villain."

Determined, Evelyn gathered the hem of her gown and strode in the direction Isabella had indicated.

Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore were seated with one other man across from them.

Gregory Thornton?! Evelyn froze mid-step. That man had despised her back then.

He was Isabella’s blind date?

She scanned the area but saw no one else besides the three of them.

It had to be him.

After a brief internal debate, Evelyn decided there was no way she’d let her best friend marry that snake.

He didn’t deserve Isabella.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn lifted her wineglass and glided forward with effortless grace.

Tristan noticed her approach first. He nudged Nathan excitedly, whispering, "Looks like Evelyn’s serious about burying the past. She’s actually coming over to you!"

Nathan’s gaze flickered as he watched her—elegant, poised, breathtaking.

He remained outwardly composed, though his pulse betrayed him.

In seconds, Evelyn stood before them.

"Evelyn, here for Nathan? We’ll give you two some space," Tristan said, standing and pulling Gregory up with him.

Nathan stayed seated, waiting.

Evelyn spared him only a dismissive glance before locking eyes with Gregory Thornton.

"Mr. Thornton, care for a drink?"

All three men stiffened.

Tristan gaped between Gregory and Evelyn.

Beside them, Nathan’s expression darkened, his entire demeanor turning glacial.

Gregory frowned. Though shocked by Evelyn’s identity, he wasn’t as easily intimidated as Tristan.

She had no leverage over him.

"Why would I drink with you?" he said coldly.

Tristan nodded dumbly. "Yeah, what would you two even talk about?"

Evelyn arched a brow, her smile turning sly. "Who says we need to talk? Some things are better left… unspoken."
###Chapter 218 Not a Good Person

Evelyn's words hung heavy in the air, thick with tension. Nathan's piercing gaze swept over her and Gregory, his expression darkening.

The chill radiating from him was palpable. "Evelyn, what exactly are you trying to do?" Nathan demanded, his voice low and dangerous. He had already done as she asked—removed Victoria Ashford from the project and brought Sterling Corporation into the deal.

She had called it compensation. Now that he had paid his dues, they were even.

Didn’t that mean he had the right to start fresh with her? So why was she suddenly seeking out Gregory Thornton?

Evelyn tilted her head slightly, her eyes cold as they met Nathan’s. "Mr. Blackwood, just because we’ve settled our past doesn’t mean you get to dictate my actions."

Her tone was sharp, final. They weren’t friends. He had no right to pry.

Nathan’s jaw tightened, his expression turning stormy. But Evelyn had already dismissed him, turning her attention back to Gregory with a slow, deliberate smile—one that was both alluring and dangerous.

"Mr. Thornton," she purred, "shall we talk privately?"

Gregory wanted to refuse. He didn’t trust her motives.

"Evelyn," he said stiffly, "what’s your game?"

Her lips curved higher. "Isn’t it obvious? I’m interested in you."

The words hit like a shockwave. Tristan’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Evelyn was interested in Gregory? The same man who had openly scorned her during her marriage to Nathan? And what about Nathan himself?

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet as Nathan’s aura turned glacial.

Gregory froze, his face paling as if he’d just seen a ghost.

Did I do something wrong? His mind raced. Is she trying to get me killed?

Nathan had only recently forgiven him for the way he’d treated Evelyn in the past. They had just begun to mend their friendship. And now—this.

Before Gregory could react, Evelyn grabbed his arm and pulled him away.

He tried to resist, but she dragged him into the crowd, her grip unrelenting. Their struggle drew curious glances, whispers rising around them.

"Evelyn," Gregory hissed, "don’t think I’m intimidated just because you’re the Sterling heiress now. If it weren’t for Nathan—"

He cut himself off, his voice turning icy. "I’m not interested in you. Give it up."

Friendship mattered more to him than whatever game she was playing.

Evelyn laughed softly, her head dipping just enough to hide her expression from onlookers. They stood close—too close—fueling speculation.

Then, without warning, she yanked Gregory forward by his tie, bringing his face inches from hers.

His breath caught.

Her striking features, framed by that devilish smirk, were suddenly all he could see. His pulse stuttered.

In that frozen moment, she whispered, cold and precise, "Do you really think you’re special? I’m not blind. Anyone who calls Nathan Blackwood a friend can’t possibly be a good person."

Gregory’s eyes narrowed. She’s playing me.

He moved to shove her away—

But a powerful force wrenched him backward.

Gregory staggered, barely catching his balance. When he looked up, Nathan stood between them, his expression thunderous.

His voice was steel. "Since when were the two of you this close?"
###Chapter 219 Whose Side Are You On?

The entire room witnessed the tension unfolding. Gregory Thornton stood unusually close to Evelyn Sinclair, while Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened with barely contained fury.

Whispers spread like wildfire through the elite gathering. The intricate dynamics between these powerful figures never failed to fascinate.

Evelyn found Nathan's interference amusing. Who did he think he was, questioning her associations? She remained silent, arching one perfect eyebrow in silent challenge.

Gregory scrambled to explain. "Nathan, I swear there's nothing between us!" His words fell on deaf ears as Nathan refused to even glance his way.

Tristan Whitmore observed the bizarre love triangle and couldn't resist stirring the pot. "Nothing between you? You two looked pretty cozy to me." Gregory's eye twitched in irritation.

"Whose side are you on anyway?" Gregory demanded, suddenly suspicious. "Are you secretly working for Evelyn?" Tristan immediately retreated behind Nathan's imposing frame, knowing better than to challenge Gregory's military-trained physique.

Nathan's intense gaze never left Evelyn, demanding an answer she refused to give. A mischievous glint appeared in Evelyn's eyes as she finally spoke. "We've known each other three years. Of course we're close." She'd never forget how Gregory had insulted her relentlessly during that time.

Tristan nodded enthusiastically. "Exactly!" He immediately regretted it when both Nathan and Gregory turned their murderous glares on him.

At that moment, Isabella Montgomery arrived with Evelyn's ringing phone. "Evelyn darling, you have a call." Her cheerful interruption provided the perfect escape.

Evelyn seized the opportunity, grabbing her phone and striding away without another word, Isabella following closely. "Well?" Evelyn asked once they were out of earshot.

Isabella couldn't contain her excitement. "Got the perfect shot! That tie pull was absolutely iconic!" Her triumphant grin faded when she spotted Nathan approaching with stormy determination.

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "At least it wasn't for nothing." Though privately, she wondered why Nathan had reacted so strongly.

The two women sought a quiet corner to review the photos, but their path took them past a group of society women heading to the restroom.

"Evelyn actually made Victoria Ashford leave? Impossible! Victoria's one of the most powerful women in Santa Barbara."

"How could someone like Evelyn possibly intimidate her?"

Sophia Blackwood's voice cut through the speculation. "Evelyn's just a petty bitch jealous of anyone more accomplished. She used her family's influence to sabotage Victoria's business dealings."

The other women nodded as if this explained everything. Sophia lowered her voice dramatically, ensuring everyone could still hear. "Want to see that arrogant witch humiliated? I have a plan."

Most looked apprehensive - their families had warned them against crossing any Sterling, especially Evelyn. Sophia scoffed. "Fine. If you're all too scared, I'll handle it myself. Just don't interfere."

Evelyn and Isabella exchanged glances. "Bathroom gossip never disappoints," Isabella murmured as they found a conspicuously visible seating area.

Within minutes, Sophia and her entourage appeared, immediately spotting Evelyn. Isabella leaned close. "Should we make an early exit?"

Evelyn's lips curved. "Let's have some fun first. I'm bored."

Isabella shrugged. "Someone's feeling playful tonight."

Sophia approached alone, her usual arrogance replaced with sickening sweetness. "Evelyn, I-" Isabella fake-gagged. "Sorry, reflex." She waved apologetically.
###Chapter 220 I'll Release You If You Lie

The corners of Evelyn's lips twitched involuntarily. That saccharine voice calling her name sent chills down her spine.

If she hadn't uncovered Sophia's true nature beforehand, Evelyn might have doubted her own ears. The polished young socialite before her maintained perfect poise, every gesture dripping with aristocratic refinement.

"Evelyn, I need to speak with you privately." Evelyn arched an eyebrow, swirling the crimson liquid in her crystal glass. "Whatever for?"

Sophia lowered her gaze demurely. "I've been doing some serious soul-searching lately. My past behavior was...unacceptable. I want to offer my sincerest apologies."

Evelyn nodded slowly. "How thoughtful. Why not apologize right here? Wouldn't that demonstrate greater sincerity before everyone?" Sophia's smile faltered.

She forced a brittle laugh. "Some matters...are better discussed in private." Evelyn's gaze drifted to the chandelier's reflection dancing in her wine.

The fractured light shimmering in her glass outshone the actual fixture above them. Seeing her hesitation, Sophia pressed further.

"Surely you wouldn't want our guests overhearing...personal matters concerning you and my brother?" Evelyn's eyes snapped up.

A dangerous smile curved her lips. "Lead the way." As she rose, Isabella caught her wrist with a worried frown.

Evelyn gave her hand a reassuring squeeze before following Sophia. Triumph flashed in Sophia's eyes as they reached the secluded second-floor balcony.

Moonlight filtered through rustling leaves, the Milky Way stretching across the inky sky. Sophia positioned herself strategically behind Evelyn, her voice dripping with false sweetness.

"Honestly, you and Nathan make such a perfect match. Similar social standing, compatible family backgrounds..."

She paused dramatically. "Even Grandfather has warmed to you recently. Are you truly no longer interested?"

Evelyn turned slowly, ice in her gaze. "You misunderstand completely." Her smile turned glacial. "The question isn't whether I'm worthy of your family..."

She leaned closer. "But whether your family deserves to associate with the Sterling heiress." Sophia's face contorted momentarily before smoothing into a mask.

Rage simmered beneath her carefully cultivated facade. Normally, she'd have lashed out immediately - but both her grandfather and brother had issued strict warnings about provoking Evelyn.

Yet seeing that infuriating smirk, Sophia's restraint shattered. Earlier, she'd discreetly loosened the balcony railing's screws.

The flimsy barrier would collapse at the slightest pressure. Hidden by foliage and darkness, no one would notice until it was too late.

Sophia's lips curled in a vicious smile. "Evelyn! What's that on your back?" She lunged forward with all her strength, aiming to send Evelyn tumbling over the edge.

She didn't want death - just enough pain to wipe that smug expression away forever. A crippling injury would suffice.

Imagine the humiliation of the mighty Sterling heiress sprawled on the ground below. The scandal would be worth any punishment.

But as her hands made contact, Evelyn sidestepped with unnatural grace. Momentum carried Sophia forward into empty air.

The railing gave way instantly. A scream tore from her throat as she pitched forward into nothingness.

Wind whipped past her face as panic seized her. Then - a brutal yank at her dress collar halted her descent.

Evelyn's grip was ironclad, her expression chillingly calm as she dangled Sophia over the precipice. "Did you just attempt to murder me, Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia opened her mouth to deny it. Evelyn's smile turned predatory. "Careful now...I'll release you if you lie."
###Chapter 221 Reckless Without Reason

Sophia Blackwood froze in terror, her head bobbing in frantic agreement. "Y-yes, Evelyn! I'm sorry! I know it was wrong—"

Evelyn Sinclair's grip tightened.

The sickening tear of fabric split the air. For one heart-stopping second, Evelyn released her hold. Sophia shrieked as her body lurched downward—only to jerk to a stop when Evelyn's fingers clamped around her wrist again.

A cruel smile played on Evelyn's lips as she drank in Sophia's petrified expression. "Since you confessed so willingly... this is what you deserve."

Sophia's composure shattered. "HELP! SOMEONE HELP ME!"

Evelyn didn't silence her. Within moments, a crowd swarmed the balcony. Tristan Whitmore took one look and sprinted to find Nathan Blackwood.

"God, look at her dress!" Evelyn taunted, nodding at the shredded fabric barely clinging to Sophia's frame. "One good tug and everyone gets a free show. Shall we test that theory?"

Sophia's fingers scrabbled uselessly against the railing. The realization hit her—this flimsy material wouldn't survive her weight. Her screams died instantly, replaced by ragged breathing.

"You—!" Sophia's voice shook with fury. "You promised not to let go if I admitted it!"

The world tilted. How had the predator become the prey?

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "Why would I save someone who just confessed to attempted murder? Tell me, Sophia—do you leave your brain at home when you scheme?"

Sophia trembled violently, her nails digging into Evelyn's arm. "Nathan will—"

"Brother! SHE'S TRYING TO KILL ME!" Sophia wailed as Nathan arrived.

Every witness turned expectantly toward the billionaire. Nathan's stormy gaze flicked between the two women—until Evelyn held up her phone with a smirk.

"Before we continue... let's settle this little misunderstanding." She tapped the screen.

Evelyn's recorded voice rang out: "Did you just try to push me, Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia's panicked reply followed: "YES! I'm sorry, Evelyn! I know it's wrong—"

The crowd erupted.

"Jesus Christ, that's premeditated!"
"Who tries to murder someone at a party?!"
"Thank God Ms. Sinclair recorded it!"
"I'd have let her drop after that confession..."

Nathan's expression darkened to something lethal. He wrenched Sophia onto the balcony—only to backhand her across the face with enough force to snap her head sideways.
###Chapter 222 Intelligence Is a Blessing

The grand ballroom fell into stunned silence. The spectators hadn't anticipated this dramatic turn of events.

Nathan Blackwood's slap was brutal. He'd put his full strength behind it, showing no regard for Sophia being his own sister. Sophia collapsed onto the marble floor, her trembling fingers touching her burning cheek.

The vicious impact left her dizzy. Her entire body shook uncontrollably with shock and humiliation. For several heartbeats, she couldn't process what had happened. Pathetic. Despicable. Grotesque.

No insult seemed adequate to describe Sophia in this moment. Silent tears carved paths through her ruined makeup as she stared up at Nathan in horror.

Nathan's eyes burned with a fury she'd never witnessed before. That terrifying wrath was now directed entirely at her.

Suddenly, Sophia remembered her grandfather's warning and her brothers' repeated cautions about provoking Evelyn. Her blood ran cold. The Blackwood family might disown her completely.

They might cast her out of Highland Estates forever! The crowd's mocking, scornful gazes weighed heavily on the once-proud Blackwood heiress. Sophia had nowhere left to hide.

Under the glittering chandeliers of the opulent ballroom, Nathan's slap had echoed like a gunshot. Evelyn allowed herself a small, satisfied smile.

She had no interest in watching the remaining drama unfold. Her purpose here was accomplished. With the truth revealed, it was time to leave.

"This little performance wasn't particularly entertaining," Evelyn remarked, her voice laced with icy amusement. She flicked her wrist dismissively. "Ms. Blackwood, intelligence is a blessing you were clearly denied."

Evelyn turned on her heel. She'd shown remarkable restraint by not releasing Sophia earlier. Had she been slower to react, Evelyn could have tumbled from that balcony. Broken bones at best. Paralysis at worst.

Sophia had intended to make Evelyn the laughingstock of high society. The humiliation would have followed her for life.

But Evelyn wasn't some saint who turned the other cheek. Revenge was a dish best served precisely when deserved. Sophia's social standing lay in ruins tonight.

Her marriage prospects had likely evaporated. Every bit of this disgrace was self-inflicted. Evelyn's lips curled in contempt. "Poetic justice," she murmured to Isabella. "At least we got some entertainment tonight."

The two women touched up their makeup in the powder room before heading toward the grand entrance. The landscape lighting cast dramatic shadows across the marble steps.

"Evelyn." A deep voice called her name.

She turned instinctively to see Nathan's imposing silhouette approaching through the twilight. The glow of his cigarette tip traced elegant arcs through the darkness. "Evelyn, we need to talk."

His mesmerizing, dangerous gaze locked onto hers. Evelyn refused to recall how she'd once drowned in those eyes, helpless to escape their pull.

The entire evening had been absurd. Isabella arched an eyebrow. "Should I give you privacy?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Stay. There's nothing private about this conversation." Nathan's jaw tightened momentarily before smoothing into his usual composed expression.

"I apologize for what happened tonight," he said, his rich baritone voice carefully controlled. "She'll face consequences. And... thank you for not letting her fall."

Nathan knew Evelyn would have been justified in releasing Sophia. After countless schemes against her, Evelyn's restraint was unexpected.

Evelyn's lips curved into a dazzling smile that didn't reach her eyes. "No thanks necessary. I don't share your family's talent for shameless behavior." She always delivered her coldest words with her brightest smile.
###Chapter 223 Be a Decent Human Being

The following morning. Sophia Blackwood was whisked away from San Francisco mere hours after Nathan Blackwood brought her back to Highland Estates.

No one had a clue about her destination.

Evelyn Sinclair discovered this news while playing golf with Donovan Sterling. The private VIP country club's course was nestled amidst lush greenery.

The serene atmosphere was perfect for Donovan's favorite pastime. Since he'd been immersed in research at the National Laboratories, Evelyn hadn't seen him in weeks.

Finally carving out leisure time, Evelyn had invited Donovan for a game. Struggling with her swing, she eventually abandoned pretense and scrolled through her phone instead.

Isabella Montgomery's call interrupted her scrolling. "The gossip mill's working overtime today! Between the Sophia scandal and your little... situation with Gregory Thornton!" Isabella's gleeful chuckle carried through the line.

Evelyn rolled her eyes dramatically. "What situation? Relax, nothing leaked. Someone issued a gag order before the banquet ended."

Isabella's knowing laugh required no explanation. Evelyn didn't inquire about the mystery benefactor. Only two men possessed both the motive and means.

Nathan Blackwood or Gregory himself. Either way, it spared her considerable hassle.

Then Isabella circled back to Sophia's disappearance.

The complete media blackout was peculiar. Isabella voiced her concern. "The Blackwoods are eerily quiet. Who knows if they're plotting revenge or sending thank-you notes? You saved her from that fall, but her reputation's beyond repair."

"Do you think Nathan will come after you?" Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk. "They should worry about whether I'll come after them."

She ended the call and tossed her phone aside. The whole affair bored her.

Who was truly at fault here anyway? Resuming her golf attempts, the ball stubbornly refused the hole. The club seemed determined to mock her efforts. Donovan finally intervened to correct her stance.

To outside observers, their proximity appeared intimate. Suddenly, the temperature seemed to drop several degrees as a towering figure materialized before them.

The Sterling siblings looked up simultaneously. Nathan Blackwood stood there, his aristocratic features schooled into icy detachment as he glared at them. Donovan released Evelyn's hand with a slight frown.

"Nathan Blackwood?" Evelyn's eyes narrowed, recalling Isabella's warning. Was this a confrontation? Her gaze shifted to the entourage behind him - including a mall chain CEO. Business associates, then.

What an unfortunate coincidence.

"Why aren't you answering my calls?" Nathan's deep voice held an edge. Evelyn blinked, remembering she'd blocked him after settling the car repair bill.

Apparently, he hadn't noticed yet. Her lips curved slowly.

"Because I prefer silence to your voice." Brutal honesty. Nathan's composed mask flickered momentarily. "Evelyn, I apologize for her behavior."

Her laugh was crystalline and cold. "I've heard enough Blackwood apologies to last several lifetimes. Go play your corporate games elsewhere."

What a mood killer. Nathan's glacial stare swept over Donovan before he visibly restrained himself. Maintaining dignity before Evelyn seemed to require Herculean effort.

"Evelyn, my family owes you. Name your terms."

She tucked a stray lock behind her ear with deliberate nonchalance. "How magnanimous, Mr. Blackwood."

"Then surrender controlling interest in the Willowbrook development to Sterling Corporation."

Though a joint venture, Blackwood Enterprises had purchased the land for $50 billion. Conventional wisdom dictated they retain majority stake and decision-making authority.

For Sterling Corporation to claim dominance meant Blackwood voluntarily forfeiting billions in profits.

Nathan's dark eyes narrowed. Two seconds later: "Done."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. That fast? His generosity surprised her. Damn. Had she undersold? "Sophia must be worth her weight in gold," she mused aloud.

A polished smile surfaced. "My attorneys will draft revised contracts. Consider the Sophia matter closed." Nathan's hollowed gaze studied her.

Her transactional approach clearly irritated him. "Anything else to discuss? If not, perhaps you should educate Ms. Blackwood on basic human decency."
###Chapter 224: Who's She Performing For?

Evelyn turned her gaze toward Donovan, who was engaged in a phone conversation. The warmth in her eyes as she watched him sent an immediate chill through Nathan's entire being.

The executives trailing behind Nathan didn't recognize Donovan Sterling, but Nathan knew exactly who he was. Donovan held the distinction of being the youngest recipient ever of the prestigious Breakthrough Prize.

That record remained unbroken to this day. Operating under his pseudonym "Sunner," Donovan had effortlessly solved the most complex problem in Dominic Kingsley's research project.

Nathan hadn't seen Donovan in months and certainly hadn't expected to find him standing beside Evelyn at this particular moment.

Watching them together made his blood boil.

Nathan's dark eyes bore into Evelyn with an intensity that could melt steel. His imposing presence radiated aristocratic refinement as he stood there, every inch the untouchable billionaire.

Yet Evelyn remained utterly indifferent to his existence. Their business had been concluded, their accounts settled. They owed each other nothing now.

Donovan ended his call and approached Evelyn with a troubled expression marring his handsome features. He leaned down to murmur something in that gentle, coaxing tone he reserved only for her.

"There's an emergency at the lab. I need to head back immediately." Evelyn's face instantly clouded over. She crossed her arms, her lower lip jutting out in a dramatic pout.

"You promised me the entire day! Why do you always break your promises?" Donovan showed not the slightest irritation at her tantrum.

He patiently explained the situation, his voice soothing. "The experiment has reached a critical phase. Any delay could ruin months of work."

"Let me at least take you home first. Your apartment or the office?" Evelyn shot him an exasperated look. Nathan's looming presence already had her on edge, and she had no desire to prolong this conversation.

With a frustrated huff, she tossed her golf club aside and stormed off. Donovan calmly retrieved the discarded club before hurrying after her, his placating words floating on the breeze.

To any observer, they appeared like lovers in the midst of a lovers' quarrel.

Both could feel the icy daggers of Nathan's stare boring into their backs, yet neither turned to acknowledge him.

The executives trailing Nathan exchanged uneasy glances. They'd all recognized Evelyn Sinclair - Nathan Blackwood's infamous ex-wife - immediately.

Her apparent closeness with another man created an awkward situation none dared comment on. Provoking Nathan's wrath wasn't worth their careers.

This golf outing had taken months to arrange - a precious opportunity to discuss business with the elusive billionaire. Running into this scene made several executives wish they'd chosen a different venue.

Just as someone prepared to redirect Nathan's attention, he abruptly turned. His expression could have frozen hell over.

"Meeting's canceled." His tone brooked no argument. "We'll reschedule."

With that, Nathan strode off in the same direction Evelyn had disappeared.

He'd nearly caught up to the pair when a woman materialized directly in his path. Dripping in designer labels and enough jewelry to sink a small boat, she dramatically twisted her ankle and tumbled toward him.

"Oops!"

Nathan could have easily caught her. Instead, he took a deliberate step back, allowing her to crash unceremoniously to the ground.

The disdain in his eyes was palpable. "Are you blind?" he snapped as the woman sprawled at his feet.

Wincing in genuine pain, she forced a sickeningly sweet smile. "What an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Blackwood." Her voice oozed artificial sweetness.

With Evelyn slipping further away, Nathan glared down at the interloper. Recognition flickered across his features as he took in her face.

For just a heartbeat, he froze. Then his expression turned glacial once more.

At first glance, the woman bore a passing resemblance to Evelyn Sinclair.

But upon closer inspection, her features were all wrong.

Each element seemed artificially constructed, losing any semblance to Evelyn when combined.

Her face appeared unnaturally stiff, lacking even a fraction of Evelyn's effortless grace.

The deliberate arrangement of her plastic features created a grotesque parody of Evelyn's beauty.

Nathan Blackwood's entire demeanor turned glacial.

His piercing gaze dripped with undisguised contempt.

"Get out of my sight," he commanded through clenched teeth, his voice laced with venom.

The woman - Genevieve Dawson - forced a saccharine smile despite the rejection.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'm Lydia... I mean, Genevieve. Evelyn's cousin." Her voice trembled with nervous excitement.

Gossip about Nathan and Evelyn's estrangement had spread through New York's elite circles.

With Evelyn having publicly moved on, Genevieve saw her opportunity.

She believed her surgically enhanced resemblance to Evelyn could secure her place as the next Mrs. Blackwood.

The thought of becoming the Blackwood heiress made her pulse quicken.

Nathan's expression darkened further.

His glacial stare didn't waver. "I don't give a damn who you are."

He had zero patience for this charade. "This is your final warning."

His tone could have frozen the Hudson River.

Without another glance, he strode past her toward his waiting car.

His attention remained fixed on Evelyn, who had just entered Donovan Sterling's vehicle.

Evelyn's gaze flickered briefly toward the scene before deliberately looking away.

Inside the car, Donovan frowned. "Isn't that Genevieve Dawson? Who's she performing for?"

His lip curled in distaste. "That staged stumble was painfully obvious."
###Chapter 225 Utterly Revolting

Evelyn let out a derisive snort.

No matter what anyone said, Genevieve might be their cousin, but there was no blood relation between them.

Charles Sterling was William Sterling's younger brother and Evelyn's uncle.

Genevieve's mother, Margaret, was Charles's mistress and had Genevieve from a previous marriage.

This mother-daughter duo had been living under Charles's roof for years.

Though there was no official marriage between Charles and Margaret, she was essentially his second wife.

But that had nothing to do with Evelyn's family. They had never cared about Charles's personal affairs.

Sterling Corporation had been built from the ground up by William Sterling alone—Charles had no hand in it.

Still, out of familial obligation, William had entrusted Charles with their Charleston operations.

Even after two years of losses, William never held Charles accountable.

He simply considered it the price of keeping the peace.

Charles had brought Genevieve into Sterling Corporation's Charleston branch and installed her as a top executive.

To outsiders, Genevieve was a Sterling.

She used the Sterling name to mingle in high society, but her status was worlds apart from Evelyn's.

Genevieve had always tried to ingratiate herself with Evelyn, but Evelyn couldn’t care less.

She copied Evelyn’s mannerisms, her wardrobe, even her expressions—desperate to pass herself off as a true Sterling.

But the rest of the family knew better.

Who would’ve thought Genevieve would show up at the golf course today?

After dropping Donovan off, Evelyn was about to head back to the office when she got a message from Lucas.

Come home. There’s a show you won’t want to miss.

The cryptic message piqued her curiosity.

If Lucas said it was worth seeing, it had to be entertaining. Without hesitation, Evelyn sped back to Sterling Manor.

William was in the garden with Archibald, examining the flowers.

When Archibald spotted Evelyn, he immediately stood and greeted her.

"Miss, you're back!"

Evelyn smirked, twirling her car keys. "Dad, bored of fishing already? Taking up gardening now?"

William rolled his eyes and jerked his chin toward the house.

Evelyn arched a brow.

Who could possibly make Chairman Sterling flee to the garden?

Just as she was about to step inside, the unwelcome guests emerged.

"Evelyn! Finally! Your sister and I have been waiting forever!"

A woman with a sickly sweet smile stood in the doorway, oozing false warmth.

Evelyn froze when she saw Margaret standing there. Her smile vanished instantly.

Honestly, she had zero interest in entertaining this mother-daughter pair.

Yet they insisted on forcing their way into her life, acting like they belonged.

So this was why William had fled to the garden.

Evelyn scoffed internally. This is my house. Why should we be the ones avoiding them?

She forced a polite smile as she approached Margaret. "Is there an issue with Uncle Charles's company?"

"Oh no, everything’s fine!" Margaret simpered. "We’re family, so I brought your sister to visit!"

She beckoned Genevieve forward.

Genevieve stood there, playing the part of the demure, obedient girl.

"Hi, Evelyn."

Evelyn didn’t respond.

The memory of Genevieve deliberately stumbling in front of Nathan Blackwood at the golf course flashed in her mind.

The way she had batted her lashes, so fake, so pathetic.

Disgusting.

Genevieve wasn’t acting like that now, of course.

Evelyn breezed past them into the house.

A maid immediately rushed over, taking her bag and kneeling to help her change shoes.

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to Lucas, lounging in the living room with a cup of coffee.

"Lucas, why aren’t you at the office? I heard Dominic wants to promote some new engineers."

Lucas gave her a lazy glance. "Can’t a man retire early?"

Evelyn snorted, about to fire back when Margaret cut in.

"Evelyn, I heard you took over the company! Congratulations!"

Evelyn’s lips twitched. "Thanks."

"You’re so impressive!" Genevieve gushed, eyes shining with envy. "Father says I should learn from you!"

Evelyn paused for two beats before replying, "Is that so? Uncle Charles flatters me."

She knew damn well Charles would never praise her.

Margaret hurried to agree. "Yes! That’s why I brought Genevieve—so she can assist you at the company and learn!"

Evelyn stiffened, her frown deepening.

This woman had some nerve.
###Chapter 226 She's Not Qualified

Evelyn hesitated, her fingers tightening around her wine glass.

Margaret Dawson leaned forward, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "It doesn't have to be anything major, darling. Just a simple managerial role would suffice."

Her lips curled into a saccharine smile. "After all, we're family. You wouldn't deny your own sister an opportunity, would you?"

Evelyn's jaw clenched.

The sheer audacity. How dare Margaret waltz in here and demand an executive position? Before Evelyn could respond, Lucas Sterling let out a sharp, mocking laugh.

His voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Haven't you done enough damage to Uncle Charles's company? Now you want to leech off Sterling Corp too?" He smirked. "We don't tolerate parasites here."

Evelyn's lips twitched.

Well played, little brother. When had he learned to be so brutally eloquent?

Margaret's face turned to stone. Lucas's words had struck a nerve—too direct, too disrespectful.

She was accustomed to flaunting her self-proclaimed status as the "Second Lady of the Sterling family," basking in the unearned prestige. Everyone in their circles knew she was Charles Sterling's longtime mistress, but she carried herself like a legitimate wife.

"Lucas!" Margaret hissed. "How dare you speak to me like that? Genevieve is your cousin!"

Lucas pointed at Evelyn without hesitation. "She's my sister. You two? You're just background noise."

Margaret's face flushed crimson. She whirled toward Evelyn, desperation creeping into her voice. "Evelyn, you're in charge now. Surely arranging a position for Genevieve wouldn't be difficult?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of her wine, letting the silence stretch. Then she smiled—a cold, calculated curve of her lips.

"It's not impossible," she said lightly.

Margaret's shoulders relaxed—until Evelyn continued.

"Sterling Corp holds annual executive recruitment drives. If Genevieve truly has the qualifications, she's welcome to submit an application like everyone else."

The room went dead silent.

Margaret's nostrils flared. "Why the ridiculous formality? Just say the word! She's family—must you be so petty?"

Genevieve nodded eagerly, her doe eyes wide with feigned innocence. "Exactly! I only want to learn the business, Evelyn."

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "Business is learned at business school, Genevieve. Every position at Sterling Corp carries weight. Given your... limited skill set, I doubt you'd last a week."

Genevieve's face crumpled. She bit her lip, turning tearful eyes toward her mother.

Margaret looked like she'd been slapped. The sight almost made Evelyn laugh.

"You—!" Margaret's voice rose to a shrill pitch. "You're deliberately humiliating us! Don't forget, we're Stantons too!"

Her finger jabbed toward Evelyn. "You're the disgrace here, with your scandals plastered across every tabloid! Who do you think you are?"

The temperature in the room plummeted. Lucas set down his phone, his playful demeanor vanishing.

At that moment, William Sterling strode in—his expression dark. He'd clearly been listening from the hallway.

Seizing the opportunity, Margaret pounced. "William! Your children are beyond disrespectful! All I asked was a simple favor for Genevieve. Who do they think they are?"

William's face was thunderous. He'd heard enough.

His voice was ice. "This isn't some back-alley negotiation, Margaret. Watch your tongue."

Margaret flinched, her bravado crumbling. "W-We're family," she stammered. "Must everything be so formal?"

Genevieve rushed to intervene. "Uncle William, Mother didn't mean it like that—"

"Family?" William's laugh was brutal. "You're a mistress and her illegitimate child. That doesn't make you Sterlings."

The words landed like a guillotine.

Years ago, Charles's wife had fallen gravely ill after discovering his affair with Margaret. She never recovered.

William had severed ties with Charles afterward, only maintaining business connections out of necessity. He'd made one thing clear: if Charles ever married Margaret, he'd lose all rights to the Charleston branch.

So Margaret remained a mistress—for over a decade. Unacknowledged. Unwanted.

Yet she'd spent years masquerading as a Sterling, until today—when William ripped the facade away.

Genevieve's eyes welled with furious tears. "That's not fair! My parents have been together for years! You're the one who forced them to stay unmarried!"

William's gaze could have frozen hell. "Know your place. You don't speak unless spoken to."

The unspoken truth hung heavy:

In this world of old money and power, blood mattered.

And Genevieve Dawson would never be a Sterling.
###Chapter 227 Could Evelyn Possibly Be Mistaken?

Evelyn and Lucas knew the truth all too well.

They had only held back from mocking this mother-daughter pair out of respect for their uncle Charles.

William had always been fiercely protective of his family. Genevieve had crossed the line, especially here at Sterling Manor. She'd brought this upon herself.

Her face now looked rigid and unpleasant.

Burning with indignation, she'd tried playing the family card but ended up losing everything instead.

Even the maids were snickering at her.

Genevieve couldn't tolerate it any longer. Fury consumed her.

William, Evelyn, and Lucas's condescending attitudes made Genevieve's face flush crimson with rage.

They had thoroughly provoked her.

"Hmph! If not for you people, Charles would have married me ages ago!" she spat. "I'm only in this situation because of your interference! Who do you think you are to insult me like this?"

Evelyn gave the mother-daughter pair a cold glance before laughing derisively.

"Once a homewrecker, always a homewrecker."

"You should stay in the gutter where you belong. Not just anyone can marry into the Sterling family," she continued icily. "If you somehow managed to wed Uncle Charles, the media would expose your sordid past. Then the world would know you're nothing but a mistress who clawed her way up."

A meaningful smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Better to remain Charles's little secret if you want to keep your comfortable life."

"Know your place, and don't provoke those far beyond your station."

Seeing Genevieve's ashen face, Evelyn felt immense satisfaction.

Genevieve had asked for this humiliation. Clenching her teeth, the woman shrieked, "Evelyn, how dare you threaten me? You're the one who married Nathan Blackwood and ruined your own reputation!"

"Why don't you mention how you've disgraced the Sterling name? Do you think your current position lets you look down on everyone?" Genevieve braced herself, expecting Evelyn to strike her so she could retaliate.

Instead, an icy malice filled the air.

Even the observing maids glared at Genevieve with righteous anger. Evelyn's eyes narrowed, turning dark and fathomless.

A terrifying silence descended. With each deliberate step Evelyn took toward her, Genevieve felt overwhelmed by the younger woman's commanding presence.

Margaret gulped, glancing between William and Lucas. Both men looked ready to skin her alive.

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable.

"Ms. Dawson," Evelyn said calmly, her voice deceptively light, "are you truly naive enough to believe you can insult me without consequence? For what you've said today, you'll never be connected to the Sterling family again."

This was a direct threat. Evelyn's words struck fear into them. As William's publicly announced successor, Evelyn held absolute authority over who remained in the Sterling family circle.

Margaret momentarily panicked.

Her hands clenched so tightly at her sides that her nails drew blood from her palms.

"Evelyn, my mother just speaks without thinking," Margaret hurried to explain. "She didn't mean it. You're magnanimous—please don't take it to heart." Though inwardly seething at Evelyn's arrogance, Margaret dared not openly offend the heiress.

She knew Evelyn had every right to make such declarations.

Evelyn's expression was icy, her lips pressed into a thin line of disdain. She had no patience left for these two conniving women.

"What a colossal waste of my time." Her voice cut through the tense air like shards of glass. "Archibald, escort them out immediately."

The butler moved with practiced efficiency, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor as he approached the unwelcome guests.

Genevieve trembled visibly, her resentment warring with primal fear. Even in her fury, she knew better than to challenge Evelyn directly. Her manicured nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"You're all just a bunch of arrogant snobs!" Margaret spat, her shrill voice echoing through the grand foyer. "Mark my words - I wouldn't set foot in this wretched place again even if you begged me!"

With that dramatic declaration, she grabbed Genevieve's arm and stormed out, her stiletto heels striking the floor like gunshots.

The moment they crossed the threshold of Sterling Manor, Genevieve whipped out her phone with shaking fingers.

"Evelyn blocked our access to the company," she hissed into the receiver, her voice dripping with venom.

Upstairs, William Sterling's rage was palpable. Both Lucas and Evelyn could feel the tension radiating from him as he marched to his study and slammed the door with enough force to rattle the portraits on the walls.

The household staff froze in place, barely daring to breathe. Evelyn arched an eyebrow at her brother. "And you call this entertaining?"

Lucas merely shrugged, his boyish grin at odds with the tense atmosphere. "I found it rather... enlightening."

A derisive snort escaped Evelyn's lips. "Next time they show up, have security turn them away at the gates," she instructed Archibald coolly.

There was no point pretending civility anymore. These social climbers weren't worth a single moment of her consideration. Let them choke on their pathetic schemes.
###Chapter 228: How Did You Warn Him?

Archibald gave a knowing nod. "By the way, Miss Sinclair, your birthday is approaching. Any special plans?"

Had he not brought it up, Evelyn would have completely forgotten.

Her birthday was indeed just around the corner.

Evelyn laughed softly, turning to Lucas. "The celebration itself doesn't matter. What's important is my gift, right, Lucas?"

Lucas visibly paled at the reminder of the $2.8 billion he'd already spent on her.

What was a little more? Archibald chuckled at Lucas's expression. Initially, Evelyn hadn't wanted any grand celebration.

But after the incident with Genevieve and Margaret, William Sterling had insisted on making it an extravagant affair.

Sterling Corporation Headquarters

Evelyn had just stepped out of a board meeting when she spotted Alexander's stormy expression as he marched toward the elevators.

She frowned. It was rare to see her brother this furious. Without hesitation, she quickened her pace to catch up. "Alexander, what's wrong?"

His features softened slightly, but his voice remained icy. "Nothing major. Uncle Charles was making trouble, so I dealt with it."

Evelyn blinked. "Dealt with it? How exactly? Is he trying to plant someone in our company again?"

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted in a cold smirk. "Worse. He's attempting to infiltrate our shareholders' meeting. He's been privately negotiating to buy Sterling Corporation shares from several minority holders."

Evelyn's expression darkened. "After we refused to give Genevieve that executive position last time... Are they trying to use her as a mole?"

Alexander let out a derisive snort, his eyes glacial. "A fool's fantasy."

"Then how did you handle it?" Evelyn pressed, genuinely curious now.

His smirk widened. "Since he's so eager to buy shares, he must have come into money unexpectedly. I had our auditors freeze all his accounts in Charleston."

Evelyn's jaw dropped. That was brilliantly ruthless! Alexander reached out to tap her forehead lightly. "Focus on your birthday preparations instead. Use this event to strengthen our business alliances."

Blackwood Enterprises

Tristan Whitmore burst into Nathan's office like an excited puppy, with Harrison barely managing to trail behind.

Nathan's brows knitted together as he fixed Tristan with an unamused stare. "Do you live here now?"

Tristan merely grinned, sauntering over with exaggerated casualness. He waved an elegant cream-colored invitation embossed with the Sterling family crest—a mark of undeniable prestige.

"Evelyn's birthday is tomorrow," he announced smugly. "Since you clearly didn't receive an invitation, I generously procured one for you."

Nathan's gaze instantly turned arctic. Harrison instinctively shrunk back, staying silent.

No invitations had been sent from Sterling Corporation. Harrison had deliberately avoided mentioning it to spare his boss the embarrassment. Nathan's expression grew thunderous.

Evelyn's birthday? He still didn't even know the exact date. The realization that he'd been such a neglectful husband made his chest constrict painfully.

Tristan, oblivious to the storm brewing, clapped Nathan on the shoulder. "Aren't I the best wingman? What's with the long face? Don't want to go? Suit yourself—"

Harrison stood frozen, internally screaming. Since when did Mr. Whitmore have a death wish?!

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet. Nathan's glare could have turned Tristan to stone.

After an unbearably tense silence, Tristan cleared his throat and slid the invitation across the desk. "Look, just come with me. I can't face that lion's den alone."

Nathan picked up the card mechanically. Tomorrow evening. So her birthday was tomorrow. His heart gave an odd lurch.

When he finally looked up, Tristan was studying him with far too much amusement. Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously.

"Didn't your father want that Pacific Heights development?" Nathan asked coolly.

Tristan's eyebrows shot up. "Wait, are you saying—"

"Billions for an invitation seems excessive," Nathan mused, straightening his cuffs. "Unless you're not interested..."

"I'll take it!" Tristan yelped.
###Chapter 229 Nathan Blackwood's Gift

The Regal Grand Hotel glittered under the night sky, its grand facade illuminated by thousands of twinkling lights. The cream of society had gathered for Evelyn Sinclair's birthday celebration - an event that had been the talk of Manhattan for weeks.

William Sterling had spared no expense for his beloved daughter. The entire five-star hotel had been booked exclusively for the occasion, with security personnel stationed at every entrance and exit. The surrounding streets were cordoned off, creating a private sanctuary for the elite guests.

Inside, crystal chandeliers cast a golden glow over the marble floors. A massive digital display outside showcased Evelyn's portrait - her piercing gaze and flawless features capturing the essence of modern royalty. "Happy Birthday Evelyn Sinclair" trended across social media platforms, with sponsored posts appearing every few seconds.

This extravagant affair surpassed even Sterling Corporation's annual gala in scale and opulence. It was William's way of showing the world just how much his daughter meant to him.

In the VIP lounge, Evelyn sat surrounded by her closest friends - Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont. With no prying eyes around, they relaxed in comfortable intimacy.

Before them lay a dazzling array of jewelry from Laurent Dubois' latest collection. Diamonds, rubies, and sapphires sparkled under the ambient lighting, their brilliance reflecting off the mirrors. The air itself seemed charged with luxury.

Evelyn wore a form-fitting black Versace gown that accentuated her slender frame. The simplicity of the dress only highlighted her natural elegance - her porcelain skin glowing against the dark fabric. She possessed an innate nobility that required no adornment, yet...

Isabella and Natalie gasped as they examined the jewelry collection William had sent up. It looked like every rare gemstone in New York had been gathered here. Evelyn tried on ring after ring, her slender fingers adorned with glittering treasures.

The flawless white diamonds. The rare pink stones. The mysterious black diamonds - each more breathtaking than the last. Evelyn sighed dramatically, waving her bejeweled hands at her friends.

"Such a tragedy I can't wear them all at once! They're all absolutely perfect." Isabella rolled her eyes while Natalie chuckled at her friend's dramatics.

After careful consideration, Evelyn selected three statement rings. Against all fashion conventions, the multiple pieces didn't overwhelm her delicate hands. Instead, they complemented her bold personality - extravagant yet refined. Isabella gave an approving nod.

"Showtime," Evelyn announced, checking her diamond-encrusted watch. As they exited, a phalanx of bodyguards snapped to attention. The highly trained security detail formed an impenetrable barrier around their charge.

Their synchronized footsteps echoed through the hallway as they approached the grand staircase. Below, the ballroom glittered like a jewel box, the assembled guests turning as one when Evelyn appeared at the top.

Her breathtaking beauty combined with her cool confidence created an electric presence. William Sterling's chest swelled with pride as he ascended to escort his daughter down.

Though Donovan Sterling couldn't attend, his generous gift - unlimited access to his private jet and bank accounts - had arrived days earlier. Alexander and Lucas Sterling stood at attention on either side of the staircase, their handsome features and commanding presence drawing admiring glances.

William accepted a champagne flute from a passing waiter and raised it for a toast. "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my daughter Evelyn's birthday celebration! In my life, my greatest achievement isn't building Sterling Corporation... it's being father to this remarkable woman."

His voice caught slightly. Those three years when Evelyn had left home still haunted him - the sleepless nights worrying if she was safe, if she was happy. Evelyn's eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she understood her father's unspoken emotions.

Then, in the crowd below, she spotted him - Nathan Blackwood, standing apart from the others, his intense gaze fixed solely on her.
###Chapter 230 Nathan Blackwood's Gift

Nathan Blackwood stood with an air of regal authority, his striking features commanding attention effortlessly.

His magnetic presence dominated the space. Nathan was born to lead, effortlessly controlling any environment he entered. His intense gaze remained fixed on Evelyn.

This wasn't his first time witnessing her radiance, yet each encounter left him profoundly affected in new ways.

Tonight, beneath his composed exterior, an unfamiliar nervousness stirred.

When their eyes locked, the world seemed to pause. Silence enveloped them. Nathan became deaf to all external sounds. But Evelyn broke the connection after mere seconds.

What's he doing here? After William concluded his speech, guests swarmed forward with birthday wishes. Evelyn responded gracefully to each well-wisher.

Isabella and Natalie approached, but before Evelyn could relax, she sensed Nathan moving toward her with undeniable purpose. Her breath caught.

Without preamble, Nathan spoke first when he reached her. "Ms. Sterling, I've brought three gifts for you. Would you care to see them?" As always, Nathan commanded attention wherever he went, and now dozens of eyes turned their way.

Three imposing bodyguards stood behind him, each holding an exquisite velvet case. Evelyn's brow furrowed.

Her earlier joy evaporated instantly. Three gifts? Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Mr. Blackwood's generosity knows no bounds!" "Three presents at once?" Evelyn's lips curled in silent derision.

She wanted nothing from Nathan - would gladly throw them in his face! Was this just another public performance to force her acceptance? She glared at the boxes, jaw tightening.

Noting the tension, Natalie stepped forward with forced cheer. "Let's see what they are first. Evelyn can always decline if they're not to her taste."

Isabella whispered in Evelyn's ear, "If they're valuable, we can sell them! Never turn down money!" Evelyn's lips twitched.

"Fine, let's take a look." Curious onlookers pressed closer, eager to witness Nathan's extravagant offerings.

Nathan stood motionless under the chandelier's glow, his tall frame radiating cool detachment.

Evelyn opened the first case carelessly, then froze. Inside lay an extraordinary diamond necklace of ancient Roman design, its craftsmanship breathtaking.

A massive sapphire-blue diamond sat in intricate silver filigree, shimmering with ethereal beauty. The piece seemed to carry centuries of history within its facets.

The timeless design and flawless materials made its value incalculable.

Evelyn's pupils dilated. Though she'd seen rare gems worldwide, none compared to this masterpiece.

Natalie gasped. "Is that...the legendary royal jewel? The Sapphire Tear?" Recognition dawned on Evelyn.

She'd admired this piece in magazines years ago. The European royal family had treasured it in their private collection, never displaying it publicly.

An utterly priceless artifact. Yet it had disappeared years ago, purchased anonymously for a record sum.

That buyer was Nathan? And now he's giving it to me? Evelyn thought incredulously.

"Evie, does Nathan need another ex-wife?" Isabella murmured, eyes sparkling with mischief. "I'd volunteer if someone gave me this!"

Evelyn shot her a withering look. "You'd have to donate pints of blood weekly and endure constant suffering. Still interested?" Isabella recoiled.

"On second thought..." Nathan observed their exchange silently, eyes narrowing. The crowd continued marveling at the Sapphire Tear's magnificence.

Such treasures transcended monetary value. What fortune to witness this marvel firsthand! And this was merely Nathan's first gift.

"Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said coolly, "isn't this excessively extravagant?" She hadn't anticipated this.

Nathan's dark gaze deepened. "It suits you perfectly," he said quietly. Evelyn blinked, momentarily thrown.

What does that mean? Natalie nudged her eagerly. "Next one!"
###Chapter 231 The Proposal Plan

Three velvet boxes sat gleaming under the chandelier lights. The guests buzzed with anticipation as Evelyn Sinclair reached for the second box, her fingers trembling slightly.

Inside lay a pristine white cashmere beanie.

The minimalist design held no embellishments, yet Evelyn recognized it instantly. This was from XN's exclusive winter collection two years prior - a piece that had sold out within hours.

Isabella Montgomery scoffed loudly. "Seriously? I own this exact hat. It's practically vintage at this point. How unimaginative, Mr. Blackwood."

Natalie Beaumont studied the gift thoughtfully without comment. Evelyn's breath hitched as memories flooded back.

With determined movements, she opened the final box. Nestled in black satin was a jade bangle of extraordinary quality.

The translucent green stone shimmered with inner fire, its flawless surface carved with intricate motifs. This was no ordinary trinket - its value easily surpassed nine figures, dwarfing the combined worth of every other present in the room.

One diamond necklace. One jade bracelet. Nathan Blackwood's generosity knew no bounds.

Evelyn's posture stiffened.

Against her will, the past came rushing back. Their first anniversary - she'd given him a watch, he'd reciprocated with diamonds. Their second Christmas - her knitted scarf met with this very hat. The third occasion never happened... until today.

Was this his way of settling old debts? Scars she'd thought healed suddenly throbbed anew.

Her chest constricted as bitterness rose in her throat. That infuriating man always knew how to unravel her composure.

"Ms. Sinclair, you're truly blessed!" Victoria Ashford's saccharine voice cut through her thoughts. "Two magnificent gifts from Mr. Blackwood himself. Clearly destiny favors your reunion."

Evelyn's glacial stare silenced the room. "Selling my dignity for jewelry, Victoria? How... quaint of you." She snapped the boxes shut with deliberate calm. "I'll accept these... graciously."

The crowd gaped at her nonchalance. The dynamic between Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood remained society's greatest enigma.

To receive such extravagant gifts from an ex-husband should have been mortifying. Yet Evelyn carried herself with regal indifference that commanded respect.

As she turned to leave, Isabella grabbed her elbow urgently. "Evie! Sebastian's coordinating some elaborate setup with the staff. Roses everywhere!" She lowered her voice. "I think he's planning to propose!"

Evelyn's brows knitted together. That did sound like Sebastian's dramatic flair. But why hadn't he consulted her first? And what was Natalie's role in all this?

Natalie warned me to prepare you for this. Isabella rolled her eyes dramatically at Sebastian's audacity.

This wasn't some petty disagreement. They needed to establish clear boundaries immediately. Understood?

If Sebastian dares cause trouble here tonight, my father and brother will make him regret it! Evelyn's voice dripped with icy confidence.

Whatever game Sebastian was playing, tonight's celebration had to proceed flawlessly. Isabella arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow in agreement.

A sudden commotion erupted outside, instantly capturing everyone's attention.

"Fireworks!" someone gasped in delight. All heads turned toward the panoramic windows.

The night sky exploded with color as massive fireworks detonated in perfect synchronization. Vibrant hues painted the heavens, transforming darkness into a canvas of shimmering light.

As the display continued, the patterns morphed from intricate floral designs into something more astonishing - a woman's face. The image showed flowing chestnut hair, piercing emerald eyes, and lips curved in a knowing smile. Every feature had been rendered with breathtaking precision.

The crowd murmured in growing recognition. "Isn't that... President Sinclair?" a guest finally voiced what everyone was thinking.

"It's definitely her!" Evelyn's initial awe twisted into shock. The dazzling illumination revealed her stunned expression as the fireworks continued their spectacular show across the entire city skyline.

Evelyn's birthday celebration now literally lit up the metropolis. Three extravagant gifts from Nathan had already been presented. So who could possibly be responsible for this breathtaking display if not him?
###Chapter 232 Don't You Dare Kneel

All eyes were fixed on Evelyn Sinclair, the beloved daughter of the Sterling family, filled with envy and admiration.

Alexander Sterling smiled warmly as he approached his sister.

Evelyn turned her head slightly, raising an eyebrow. "Was this part of the program? I don't recall this being scheduled."

Alexander maintained his composed demeanor. "Of course not." Then his gaze shifted slightly.

He noticed a man descending the grand staircase across the room. His tone lightened. "But I believe I know who arranged this."

"Who?" Evelyn followed his line of sight.

Her body tensed immediately. Sebastian Hart stood there in a custom-tailored tuxedo, his devilish smile radiating undeniable charm.

In his hands, he carried an enormous bouquet of delicate roses - their meaning unmistakable. His gaze burned with intense affection as he moved toward Evelyn.

Evelyn felt her pulse quicken. It was too late to escape now. A tingling sensation ran down her spine.

The crowd began murmuring excitedly.

Tonight's events kept getting more dramatic. First Nathan Blackwood's extravagant gifts, now this from the Hart family's second son.

The surprises weren't over. Across the room, Victoria Ashford watched the scene unfold, her face draining of color. All attention was focused on Sebastian.

Maintaining perfect composure, Evelyn stood her ground as he approached.

Her eyes flickered with warning. Sebastian moved closer, his expression betraying nervousness. The entire room held its breath.

This had all the makings of a proposal! "Is Sebastian Hart really going to propose? What a shock! But didn't Nathan Blackwood just show his interest with those gifts? Both men are incredible catches."

"I wonder who Evelyn will choose." When Sebastian finally reached her, Evelyn could no longer remain passive.

She felt hundreds of eyes watching, including Nathan's piercing gaze from the crowd. His icy stare sent shivers down her spine.

Evelyn stepped forward gracefully, meeting Sebastian with a polite smile.

As he raised the bouquet, she swiftly interrupted in a voice only he could hear, laced with quiet threat: "If you dare kneel, I'll break both your knees."

Sebastian froze. The joy in his eyes evaporated, replaced by gloomy disappointment.

"Hmph! Just as I suspected - Sebastian came to ruin my party," Evelyn thought.

"Mr. Hart!" A trembling female voice cut through the tension.

Victoria Ashford, CEO of Ashford Enterprises, stepped forward. "Aren't you taking this joke too far?" Everyone knew Sebastian only had eyes for Evelyn.

Victoria, who usually hid her feelings so well, had finally lost her composure - a shocking sight indeed.

Sebastian seemed startled.

He hadn't even noticed Victoria's presence. Her words fell on deaf ears as he reluctantly spoke under the crowd's intense scrutiny: "Happy birthday, Evelyn. Wishing you... all the best."

Lucas Sterling burst into laughter. "'All the best'? That's quite the birthday wish!" Alexander shot him a silencing glare.

The crowd waited with bated breath... but nothing more happened. Evelyn accepted the bouquet with a satisfied smile.

"Thank you, I appreciate the gift." Sebastian lowered his head, hiding his disappointment. Lucas quickly diverted everyone's attention while Evelyn seized Sebastian's sleeve and pulled him away, oblivious to Victoria's mixed expression of frustration and relief.

When they reached a private room, Evelyn released him. "Sebastian Hart, what the hell were you thinking?"

The usually playful Sebastian looked uncharacteristically sincere, clearly hurt by her reaction - though not devastated. This was only the beginning. "I wanted to surprise you!" Unfortunately, Evelyn had seen through his plan immediately.

Today would have been perfect... what a waste. "Surprise? You nearly gave me a heart attack!" Evelyn glared at him, crossing her arms.

Their close friendship allowed for blunt honesty. She wasn't trying to embarrass him, but the outcome he'd hoped for was impossible.

Sebastian's charming smile returned, dazzling as ever. "You stopped me this time, but don't expect me to be so obedient next time."

Evelyn's temper flared. "Hart, I'm nothing like your usual type. Why this sudden obsession?" All his exes had been sweet, docile girls - completely opposite to Evelyn's strong personality.

Was he just looking for something different? Sebastian paused before laughing. "How could they compare to you? None of them ever truly moved me."

Evelyn had no interest in his romantic history. She raised a hand to stop him. "I don't care about your dating life. After all these years, we can only ever be friends."

"You're jealous!" Sebastian declared confidently, eyes shining.

Evelyn was speechless. How could she deflate his ego without crushing him completely? She tossed her hair back. "Forget it. I'm going back downstairs."

But as she turned, Sebastian grabbed her arm. "Your zipper's undone..."
###Chapter 233 An Unexpected Interruption

Sebastian Hart's sharp eyes caught the unzipped back of Evelyn Sinclair's evening gown. The exposed expanse of flawless skin and delicate shoulder blades was utterly mesmerizing.

Her cascading dark tresses had initially concealed the wardrobe malfunction. But when she tossed her hair moments ago, Sebastian spotted the revealing slip.

Evelyn froze mid-step, turning with startled eyes. Sebastian was already moving to fasten her dress.

The lounge door swung open abruptly.

"Oh my! I'm so sorry for interrupting your intimate moment with Mr. Hart, Evelyn."

That sickeningly sweet voice was unmistakable. Genevieve Dawson. Evelyn's icy glare swept over the intruder. "Are you visually impaired? Which part of this looks intimate to you?" Sebastian released Evelyn with a derisive snort.

"Who is this delusional woman?" Genevieve bit her lip dramatically before fully opening the door. She wasn't alone. Nathan Blackwood's imposing frame blocked the doorway.

The CEO's towering silhouette swallowed the hallway light. His frigid aura permeated the space as obsidian eyes burned into the pair.

Genevieve's gaze darted between them. "I'm Genevieve, Evelyn's stepsister. My apologies - I must have misinterpreted the situation." Her voice dripped with false contrition. "When I saw Mr. Hart adjusting your dress, I assumed..."

Evelyn tore her attention from Nathan to level Genevieve with a glacial stare. "Assumed what exactly? Your mind seems exceptionally filthy. Quite telling of your own experiences."

Genevieve's face twisted in outrage.

Evelyn scoffed. "Pathetic attempt at playing innocent." She turned to Nathan. "I merely spilled wine on Mr. Blackwood and brought him to change. I had no idea you'd be... occupied here." Her lips trembled with manufactured distress.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the burgundy stain marring Nathan's tailored jacket. The "accident" seemed conveniently timed.

"Then it appears we're the ones intruding. Sebastian, shall we?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Unless you'd prefer to stay for the upcoming performance?"

Sebastian offered his arm with princely grace. As they approached the exit, Genevieve scrambled aside. Nathan remained rooted like an immovable monolith.

His stormy expression darkened further. Evelyn met his gaze defiantly.

"What exactly do you mean by 'performance,' Ms. Sinclair?" Nathan's voice could frost glass.

Evelyn's crimson lips curved. "Precisely what you're imagining." Her mocking gaze shifted to Genevieve's twitching face. "Of all guests here tonight, how fortuitous that my stepsister chose to douse you, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan's jaw clenched. Genevieve blanched. "It was an accident! Evelyn, why must you humiliate me?"

"Humiliation implies effort on my part. You accomplish that quite effortlessly yourself." Evelyn dismissed her with a wave.

Nathan hadn't budged. His cologne - bergamot and sandalwood - mingled with the sharp tang of spilled wine as Evelyn stepped closer.

Her manicured finger traced the stained fabric. "You should change quickly, Mr. Blackwood." Her suggestive tone hung between them.

Nathan's hand shot out, capturing her wrist. Before she could react, he'd maneuvered her into the adjacent room.

The door slammed. Evelyn found herself pinned against the wall, engulfed in his scent. She struggled briefly before fixing him with an arctic stare.

"Explain yourself." Every syllable dripped venom. This proximity set her nerves alight - not with the breathless anticipation of years past, but with the acute awareness that control was slipping through her fingers.
###Chapter 234 The Forbidden Kiss

Nathan's features were carved from ice, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn's face. "This way you can witness firsthand," he said through clenched teeth. "The spectacle you anticipated won't be happening."

His voice carried a dangerous edge, more chilling than angry. With deliberate coldness, he withdrew his arm from her space.

A predatory gleam flickered in Nathan's darkened eyes as he began undoing the buttons of his stained jacket. The garment landed carelessly on a nearby chair with a soft thud.

His movements turned feral as he ripped off his tie with one sharp motion. The silk accessory joined his discarded coat in a heap.

The open collar revealed the tantalizing dip of his throat, his disheveled appearance radiating dangerous charm. An untamed wildness clung to him like a second skin.

The air between them grew thick enough to choke on. Evelyn barely managed to avert her eyes, forcing her traitorous pulse to steady. When she spoke, her voice was carefully measured.

"Mr. Blackwood, you flatter yourself. I couldn't care less about whatever drama unfolds between you and Genevieve."

Evelyn truly didn't give a damn about Nathan's tangled relationships. His behavior was bordering on absurd.

"Couldn't care less?" His voice dropped to a rough whisper that sent shivers down her spine. She must have imagined the vulnerability there. "Of course not." With that dismissal, Evelyn pivoted on her heel to leave.

His hand shot out, fingers wrapping around her wrist like a manacle. These recent encounters were becoming intolerable. What game was Nathan playing now? Evelyn's expression darkened as she prepared to demand answers.

Without warning, Nathan pinned her against the wall once more.

His palms cradled her face with surprising gentleness before his lips crashed against hers in a searing kiss. The contact sparked electric currents through her body.

Nathan lost himself in her sweetness, his kiss turning desperate and possessive. Evelyn remained frozen, her senses overwhelmed.

The familiar scent of his cologne mixed with whiskey triggered memories she'd tried to bury. Memories of when she'd been foolish enough to find that combination intoxicating.

When his tongue sought entrance, reality came crashing back. Evelyn bit down hard on his lower lip.

The moment he recoiled, her palm connected with his cheek in a stinging slap. The sharp crack echoed through the room.

Nathan's expression darkened as he stared at her, unblinking.

Evelyn shoved him away, fury radiating from every pore. "Open your eyes, Mr. Blackwood."

"I'm not some cheap fling you can buy with expensive trinkets. If you're looking for entertainment, I'm sure your harem of admirers would be delighted." Nathan's face hardened at her words, his voice turning gravelly.

"But you're the only one I want." The image of Sebastian Hart's planned proposal flashed through his mind, igniting fresh fury. When had this woman become so essential to his existence?

Her presence had taken root in his chest, growing vines around his heart until removing her would mean tearing himself apart.

Evelyn's pupils contracted violently. It felt like someone had ripped open an old wound, leaving her raw and bleeding.

The pain was unbearable. "Nathan Blackwood, we're divorced. I finally gave you what you wanted - I vanished from your life. We have no connection now, and we never will again."

"I feel nothing for you anymore, so do us both a favor and stay the hell away from me." Who did he think he was? Storming back into her life now, reopening scars she'd worked so hard to heal.

Did he enjoy seeing her in pain? Was this some twisted game to him? That single kiss had shaken her to the core.

It had been devastatingly perfect, and that's what made it so despicable. Evelyn turned away without hesitation, unable to bear his presence a moment longer.

She couldn't let him see how much he still affected her. With practiced ease, she wrenched open the door and fled. The slam behind her sounded final.

Nathan stood motionless.

The red imprint on his cheek burned, a trickle of blood staining the corner of his mouth. He barely registered either sensation. His chest ached with a dull, persistent throb.

"Happy birthday, Evelyn," he whispered to the empty room. In that moment, he knew with absolute certainty - he'd just lost the most precious thing he'd ever had.
###Chapter 235 The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing

Sebastian Hart emerged from the shadows, his shoulders visibly relaxing when he spotted Evelyn Sinclair. "I thought you'd been taken," he exhaled sharply. "But knowing you, you're more likely to be the kidnapper than the victim."

"Don't bring up Nathan Blackwood." Evelyn swiftly composed herself, descending the staircase with practiced grace. The click of her stilettos echoed through the grand hall, each step a deliberate performance of nonchalance.

Her chest still burned with unresolved tension. She shot Sebastian an icy glare, her expression unreadable as marble. The way her emerald gown cascaded over her curves would've made any observer believe she hadn't just left a warzone.

Genevieve Dawson scurried after her, teeth worrying her bottom lip. "Evelyn," she ventured timidly, "is Mr. Blackwood...alright?"

Evelyn's crimson lips curled in a smirk sharp enough to draw blood. One glance at Genevieve's trembling hands told her everything. Had the girl owned her ambition outright, Evelyn might have respected her.

But this pitiful act? This pretense of innocence while eyeing another woman's ex? Disgusting.

Evelyn tilted her chin toward the upstairs suite, her voice glacial. "Why don't you go see for yourself?" Even if she despised Nathan, vultures would always circle his fortune.

Three years ago might have broken her. Not anymore.

Now she wore indifference like armor. Genevieve flushed scarlet. "That's not—"

"Unnecessary," Sebastian cut in, studying Genevieve with newfound suspicion. He'd known the Sterlings for years. Since when did Evelyn have a cousin who cowered like a kicked puppy?

Evelyn flicked an invisible speck from her sleeve. "Her mother is sleeping with my uncle." That was all the explanation she'd give. Family scandals weren't for public consumption.

Sebastian merely hummed, already losing interest. Genevieve released a breath she'd been holding. If only she bore the Sterling name instead of Dawson. Her mother Margaret had begged Charles Sterling for years to legitimize them.

Always dismissed with a laugh. Always treated as a joke.

The moment Evelyn and Sebastian reached the ballroom floor, Alexander and Lucas Sterling materialized like twin storms. Thankfully, the swirling dancers provided cover. Sebastian's smile froze.

This. Was. Bad.

His knees actually wobbled. Alexander's gaze could've flash-frozen the champagne fountain. Beside him, Lucas leaned against a pillar, all rakish charm and hidden knives.

Evelyn arched a perfect brow. "What's this?"

Lucas blocked her path with an outstretched arm, deadly serious. "Just need a word with Mr. Hart about his little...performance earlier." His grin didn't reach his eyes. "Fireworks. Roses. Surely there's an explanation?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "By all means." Her good mood had evaporated the second Nathan's lips touched hers. Damn the man.

Sebastian gaped. "You're abandoning me?" His pleading look bounced off Evelyn's indifference as she deliberately turned away.

Alexander's voice dropped to subzero. "While we appreciate your...friendship with our sister, ensure tonight's spectacle isn't repeated." Every syllable dripped with restrained violence.

Lucas cracked his knuckles. "Our Evelyn's about to become the wealthiest woman alive. She hasn't time for distractions." His smile turned feral. "Unless you'd prefer to discuss this with me?"

Sebastian's eye twitched. What exactly was there to "discuss" with a man who'd once knocked out a paparazzo for snapping Evelyn's photo?
###Chapter 236 Who Do You Think You're Ordering Around?

Sebastian knew better than to argue. These were his future brothers-in-law after all. He had to maintain some decorum!

His smile turned warm and bright. "You have my word, this won't happen again. My feelings for her will remain locked away in my heart."

Alexander's brows furrowed dangerously. His gaze could cut glass.

Lucas shuddered, goosebumps rising on his arms. "Just shut up already!" Evelyn simply turned on her heel and walked away without a word.

The band Lucas had hired was phenomenal, their live performance captivating the crowd.

Dancers swayed to the rhythm, completely immersed. In the adjacent lounge, lively chatter could be heard. Drawn by the voices, Evelyn moved toward the sound.

Just as she reached the doorway, someone grabbed her wrist and yanked her inside. "What are you doing here? Come with me!" Evelyn frowned.

It was Margaret Dawson. The audacity of this woman to crash an event she wasn't invited to! Though seeing Genevieve earlier should have prepared her.

This mother-daughter duo never missed an opportunity to network with the elite. Naturally, people Evelyn despised always found ways to annoy her.

She struggled subtly, not wanting to cause a scene. Their movements were already attracting attention.

Margaret clung to Evelyn's arm, simpering at several corporate executives. "Our Evelyn is both beautiful and brilliant. You simply must collaborate with her more!"

The executives naturally respected Evelyn's reputation. They immediately approached with glasses raised.

Evelyn seized the moment to break free. She casually took a flute of champagne from a passing waiter and clinked glasses politely.

The executives drained their drinks immediately. Evelyn merely raised her glass in acknowledgment without drinking.

Margaret wouldn't let it go. "Evelyn, drink properly! How rude to these distinguished guests! As Sterling Corporation's President, you can't act like a child! In business circles, refusing a toast is unacceptable!"

The executives exchanged uncomfortable glances. Given Evelyn's status, her polite acknowledgment was already generous.

What right did Margaret have to demand she drink? Evelyn's eyes narrowed as she shot Margaret a sidelong glance.

Her voice turned icy. "Who do you think you're ordering around?" Margaret froze, stunned by the public disrespect.

How dare Evelyn speak to her like this? After she'd been so forgiving! The nerve!

Trembling with rage, she forced a strained smile. "I'm only looking out for you. As your elder, isn't it natural to offer guidance?" Charles Sterling had brought her here.

Margaret was determined to establish herself as the second lady of the Sterling family. Not even Evelyn could disregard her!

"Elder?" Evelyn scoffed. "What makes you my elder? Your delusions of grandeur?" The insult in her tone was unmistakable.

For years, Margaret had endured a powerless existence as Charles' mistress, swallowing every humiliation. The empty title of "second lady" brought only fear - fear the Sterlings would disown her.

All her suffering was because of them! What right did Evelyn have to look down on her? Margaret saw red.

Just as she prepared to retaliate, she spotted Charles and William approaching.

Instantly, tears welled in her eyes as she threw herself into Charles' arms. "What's wrong?" Charles frowned at the scene.

Margaret sobbed dramatically. "I can't take this anymore! I saw Evelyn being disrespectful during toasts and tried to correct her, but she snapped at me! After all these years, am I still not family? She refuses to acknowledge me as her elder!"
###Chapter 237: The Ultimate Comparison

The executives approached William Sterling with polite greetings before hastily excusing themselves.

They deliberately ignored Margaret's presence.

William clinked glasses with them absentmindedly, mirroring Evelyn's refusal to drink. He had witnessed the entire scene unfold.

Though the Sterlings were hosting, the guest count had far exceeded their original invitations.

Everyone sought to network with the prestigious Sterling family and mingle with high society.

Uninvited guests had tagged along with invited friends, exploiting the opportunity.

William chose to overlook this breach of etiquette but refused to entertain every toast.

His participation in a toast was considered an immense honor. Margaret's face paled at this realization.

What had she just accused Evelyn of? Poor manners for not drinking?

William's icy gaze flickered between Evelyn and Margaret. He remained silent.

Why was she causing a scene? She should at least recognize the occasion.

"Enough. This is Evelyn's birthday celebration."

His low voice dripped with displeasure. "Why are you crying?" His commanding presence dwarfed hers.

The unspoken threat in his tone was unmistakable. "Charles, take her home immediately. We won't tolerate the Sterling name being tarnished."

Charles and Margaret froze at his words.

Tears streamed down Margaret's face. "We're being dismissed just like that?"

A-list celebrities from across the globe attended Evelyn's party.

Margaret had begged Charles to bring her, desperate to flaunt her status after being expelled from Sterling Manor previously.

Another public dismissal would destroy her social standing.

"William, please—" Charles pleaded helplessly.

After all these years together without marriage, he did feel some guilt. Margaret clutched his arm dramatically.

"See? William doesn't consider me family. No wonder his children treat me with such contempt!"

"All my years with you mean nothing!" Disgust twisted William's features.

Only the presence of guests and concern for Evelyn's mood prevented his outburst.

Evelyn observed coldly from the sidelines. This was her event—she wouldn't tolerate disruptions.

"Stop claiming association with the Sterlings," Evelyn stated icily. "You've never been one of us."

"Aunt Elizabeth passed years ago, and we still honor her memory annually. Everyone knows you're just the mistress."

Margaret gaped in shock. How dare Evelyn expose this publicly?

Some guests knew but avoided mentioning it. Others were now enlightened by Evelyn's bluntness.

"Evelyn!" Charles frowned disapprovingly.

Before Evelyn could respond, Genevieve rushed to her mother's defense.

"How could you, Evelyn? Mom has cared for Dad for nearly a decade! Even without marriage, their love is real!"

Genevieve's gaze flickered meaningfully between Evelyn and William.

"If not for... circumstances, they'd be married by now!" She clung to Charles's arm pitifully. "Right, Dad?"

Charles hesitated, glancing at William's stony expression before freezing.

Margaret, touched by her daughter's support, saw an opportunity to clear her name before this elite audience.

"You don't understand, Evelyn. I've endured so much hardship with your uncle—compared to Elizabeth—"

Evelyn cut her off sharply.

"Compared to Aunt Elizabeth? What exactly are you comparing? Your ages—or who's more shameless?"
###Chapter 238 Words Cut Deeper Than Knives

Evelyn Sinclair deliberately raised her voice. Her words sliced through the air, instantly drawing every eye in the grand ballroom.

The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. Genevieve Dawson's face flushed crimson with rage. "How dare you speak to your elders that way! You're utterly uncivilized!"

Evelyn merely arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. That single gesture spoke volumes. Elders? These women had forfeited any right to respect the moment they'd schemed their way into the Sterling family.

Margaret Dawson's manicured nails dug into her palms. This was supposed to be her triumphant return to high society - a chance to reconnect with Nathan Blackwood and reestablish her position. Instead, Evelyn had exposed their dirty laundry for all to see.

Better to play the victim then. Margaret lowered her voice to a trembling whisper. "Evelyn, must you be so cruel?" Tears glittered artificially in her eyes.

Evelyn's gaze could have frozen molten lava. "Spare me the theatrics. If you think that was cruel, I've got a dictionary full of words you haven't heard yet."

She leaned in slightly, her voice carrying just enough for the surrounding guests. "Shall I tell everyone how your real father works as a bouncer at Aurora Club? Or how you've been funneling Sterling money to support him?" Her eyes flicked to Charles Sterling. "Uncle Charles, you might want to check if you're funding more than just these two gold-diggers."

Lucas Sterling's investigation had uncovered every dirty secret after their initial eviction from Sterling Manor. The actor brother had a knack for digging up inconvenient truths.

Charles's face darkened like a thundercloud. His hand shot out, striking Margaret with enough force to send her sprawling across the marble floor. Her scream echoed through the suddenly silent ballroom.

"You told me he died in an accident!" Charles's voice shook with barely contained fury.

Margaret cowered on the ground, her carefully constructed facade crumbling. "I-I didn't mean to lie! I didn't know he'd resurfaced—"

Genevieve rushed to her mother's side, but Charles's glare stopped her cold. "Did you know about this too?" When Genevieve couldn't meet his eyes, his expression turned glacial. "Get out. Both of you. Before I have security drag you out."

The once-proud women scrambled toward the exit under the weight of a hundred judgmental stares, their carefully constructed world of lies collapsing around them.
###Chapter 239 A Dangerous Encounter

William Sterling stood silently at the edge of the room, his expression unreadable.

He had no interest in his brother's domestic drama. What infuriated him most was how they'd ruined his daughter's special celebration.

Therefore, he felt no obligation to intervene, no matter how fiercely Evelyn retaliated.

They had it coming. Genevieve and Margaret deserved every bit of it.

The situation was escalating beyond repair. They eventually slunk away in humiliation. Charles Sterling also excused himself after exchanging brief words with William.

The minor disturbance barely caused a ripple. The guests smoothly transitioned to other topics - some returning to the dance floor, others engaging in polite conversation.

No one dared whisper about what had transpired. Evelyn took a delicate sip of her merlot. The wine stained her lips a deep crimson, accentuating her striking beauty and icy demeanor.

When she turned and noticed William's stormy expression, she approached and gently tugged his sleeve.

"Don't be upset, Father," she coaxed with a charming smile. "I wasn't the one who suffered. Why waste your energy on such people?"

Her sudden transformation from ice queen to doting daughter surprised everyone, yet also endeared her to them.

The contrast made her earlier coldness seem like a carefully crafted performance. Faced with such radiant charm, even the hardest hearts would melt.

"Charles has completely lost his judgment," William grumbled, his good mood shattered. "Bringing them here today? He must be under some spell."

Evelyn blinked innocently and clung to his arm like a koala. "Uncle Charles has been fooled for years. This isn't new."

"Your health is more important, Dad. Please don't upset yourself." Her voice carried genuine concern.

William couldn't stay angry under her affectionate assault. Soon, he was laughing and toasting with other guests.

As the party wound down, exhaustion crept over Evelyn. After bidding William goodnight, she stepped outside.

The night air felt refreshing after the wine. Too much had happened tonight - Nathan's kiss, Sebastian's roses - leaving her emotionally drained.

Her stilettos clicked rhythmically on the pavement. Streetlights cast elongated shadows, creating a glittering path like fallen stars.

Then the lights abruptly ended. Darkness swallowed the next stretch of road.

Evelyn paused. An unnatural chill crept up her spine.

From the blackness came faint, hurried breathing. Then two hulking figures materialized.

"Miss Sinclair," one rumbled. "Someone requests your presence."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Should've brought security, she thought ruefully. Yet she maintained perfect composure.

Her piercing gaze assessed the men. "Kidnapping or ambush?" she demanded coolly.

Their stunned expressions confirmed this wasn't a random encounter.

"Just... a conversation," the other stammered, pointing toward the darkened path.

A glowing cigarette tip pierced the shadows.

Someone was waiting. The atmosphere thickened with unspoken danger.

Evelyn calculated her options. She could run - but that would leave this threat unresolved. Better to confront it now.

Curiosity also gnawed at her. Who would dare target a Sterling?

With measured steps, she advanced, stopping three meters from the mysterious figure.

The bodyguards positioned themselves behind her. The shadowy form remained indistinct - just an outline against the wall.

But Evelyn recognized the distinctive perfume mixed with expensive tobacco. Only one guest tonight wore that scent - someone with an equally commanding presence.

The silent standoff continued. Evelyn felt unseen eyes studying her intently.

As the cigarette burned halfway, her patience wore thin.

"If you went through all this trouble to see me," she said coolly, "at least have the courtesy to speak, Victoria Ashford."

The glowing ember flared, revealing Victoria Ashford's sharp features in the brief illumination.
###Chapter 240 I'll Be a Good Girl and Listen

Evelyn Sinclair had only encountered that distinctively icy, luxurious fragrance on one person before - Victoria Ashford.

At their initial meeting during the charity gala.

In Sebastian Hart's penthouse.

And again tonight at the opera house benefit.

The same signature scent lingered in the air now. A soft, mocking chuckle came from the shadows.

"Ms. Sinclair, how perceptive of you." The voice dripped with false sweetness. "To recognize me so easily?"

Evelyn didn't dignify that with a response, rolling her eyes dramatically.

Pity Victoria couldn't see the gesture. What a wasted performance.

Victoria Ashford - the legendary business magnate who built an empire from scratch, worshipped by Forbes and Fortune alike - resorting to kidnapping? This wasn't some impulsive act. Nor was it about money.

"I assume you didn't bring me here to exchange pleasantries, Ms. Ashford?" Evelyn's voice cut through the darkness like polished steel. "Get to the point. What do you want?"

A sharp intake of breath.

Evelyn could practically taste the fury Victoria was swallowing. What fascinated her most was her own unnatural calm.

No panic. No fear. Just icy disdain as she'd unmasked her captor with effortless precision.

The shadows shifted as Victoria stepped into the dim light, her designer heels clicking against concrete.

"Aren't you frightened, Ms. Sinclair?" Victoria's manicured fingers toyed with a cigarette. "What comes next won't be... pleasant."

Evelyn lifted her chin, their gazes locking like dueling blades.

Then she laughed.

A rich, melodic sound that seemed absurd in their grim surroundings. Her lips - still perfectly painted despite everything - formed each word with crystalline clarity.

"This is about Sebastian Hart, isn't it?"

The temperature seemed to drop twenty degrees.

That name was Victoria's open wound. A decade of unrequited longing hidden beneath power suits and boardroom victories. She'd convinced herself there was still time, still hope - until tonight.

Until she saw the way Sebastian looked at Evelyn.

The way he'd been about to kneel before the entire opera house.

It shattered something fundamental in Victoria.

No failed merger, no billion-dollar loss had ever made her feel this unraveled. This... desperate.

Her smile turned razor-sharp. "Clever girl. Yes, this concerns Sebastian Hart."

Evelyn shook her head, genuine confusion knitting her brows. "Even if you destroy me, it won't make him love you. Surely a woman of your intellect knows how... primitive this approach is?"

She emphasized the last word, letting it hang between them.

Force was for thugs and fools.

And this was Evelyn's city. The Sinclair family's domain. One word from her, and Victoria's precious Ashford Enterprises would burn.

Was Sebastian worth torching her life's work?

Victoria's laugh was hollow. "Effective is effective, darling." She took a deliberate step closer. "Ruining your special night does seem cruel, but what choice did you leave me? Your family guards you too well."

A lighter flicked open.

The flame illuminated Victoria's face, highlighting the madness in her eyes. "I only need some... compromising photos. Enough to ensure you disappear from Sebastian's world permanently."

She exhaled smoke directly into Evelyn's face. "Then you'll be a good girl and listen, won't you?"

Evelyn didn't flinch.

The glow from Victoria's cigarette reflected in her eyes - twin pools of liquid defiance. That famous Sinclair smirk played across her lips.

"Of course I'll listen," Evelyn purred. Then her voice hardened to tempered steel. "But you'll fail."

The sheer arrogance in that statement made Victoria stiffen.

Even bound and outnumbered, Evelyn Sinclair remained untouchable. A queen among peasants. The realization made Victoria's blood boil.

After a stunned moment, Victoria recovered with a predator's smile. She raised one hand, signaling unseen figures in the darkness.

"Let's test that theory, shall we?" Her voice dripped with false sympathy. "My apologies in advance, Ms. Sinclair..."
###Chapter 241 Triple-Killed

The instant Victoria Ashford lifted her hand, the two hulking men flanking Evelyn Sinclair advanced.

Their movements were perfectly synchronized.

Just as their fingers grazed Evelyn's arm, an icy gust sliced through the air.

Darkness cloaked Evelyn like a second skin.

She twisted away, her body folding into the shadows with feline grace. In a blink, she materialized behind them.

Before they could process her disappearance, she kicked off one stiletto.

Her fingers curled around the shoe's pointed tip, its lethal heel aimed outward.

She struck like lightning—fluid, brutal, unstoppable.

The nearest bodyguard sensed danger too late. He jerked forward, but Evelyn pivoted mid-swing.

Her weapon arced toward Victoria instead.

The razor-sharp heel connected with Victoria's temple.

A choked gasp.

Victoria clutched her skull, nails biting into skin. Warmth trickled down her brow.

Silence.

Then—

A wet, metallic scent filled the air.

The bodyguards froze.

Evelyn didn't.

Her shoe cracked against the second man's skull before he could blink.

Rule one of street fights: Never hesitate.

The remaining bodyguard lunged, seizing Evelyn's wrist.

She let him.

Then stomped her bare heel onto his instep and drove her elbow into his gut.

A guttural scream shattered the night.

Three minutes.

That's all it took to flip the script.

Victoria's voice cut through the darkness, venomous. "Pathetic! Knock her out now!"

Evelyn smirked. Her gaze flicked to the alley's exit.

Run.

Golden light suddenly flooded the path, exposing them all.

The bodyguards flinched.

Victoria didn't. Blood streaked her porcelain face, but her glare never wavered.

Three figures emerged from the glare.

"Nathan Blackwood?" Victoria's composure cracked for half a second before reassembling. "You swore you'd stay out of this."

Nathan stood haloed in light, his broad frame radiating menace. His voice was Arctic frost. "You crossed a line, Victoria."

Tristan Whitmore and Harrison took in the scene with twin expressions of shock.

Evelyn stood barefoot, one shoe dangling from her fingers. Blood dripped from its heel.

Not hers.

Her hair was mussed, her dress wrinkled, yet she looked every inch the queen.

Tristan's lips twitched. "Ms. Ashford... did Evelyn just triple-kill you?"
###Chapter 242 Curtain Call

Victoria Ashford's face twisted in fury, her eyes blazing with uncontained rage.

She remained the CEO of Ashford Enterprises, an undisputed powerhouse in Santa Barbara. How could she endure such repeated humiliation?

Victoria's crimson glare locked onto the hulking bodyguard beside her.

"What are you waiting for? Take her down!" The command sent the man lumbering toward Evelyn Sinclair with predatory intent.

His orders were clear - incapacitate the target for easy transport. The tension crackled like live wires about to snap.

Evelyn's icy gaze swept over them. Her fingers tightened around the concealed stiletto in her palm.

The temperature seemed to drop several degrees.

A sudden gust of wind signaled movement behind Evelyn. The guard's meaty hand reached for her shoulder to immobilize her.

Tristan Whitmore and Harrison barely had time to shout a warning.

Then - like lightning - Nathan Blackwood materialized between them. His steel-toed boot connected with the guard's abdomen with bone-crushing force.

The impact sent the man flying backward as if hit by a truck. Every organ in his body seemed to rupture simultaneously.

He collapsed like a marionette with cut strings, barely breathing, completely immobilized.

Victoria's posture stiffened almost imperceptibly. Her best operative had been neutralized in seconds. Swallowing her volcanic rage, she turned venomous eyes toward Nathan.

"Playing the white knight, Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice dripped with false sweetness.

Nathan's glacial stare held something far more dangerous than anger - the promise of annihilation. Tristan recognized that look with dawning horror.

The predator had reemerged after years of civilized restraint.

"Victoria Ashford," Nathan's voice could have frozen hell, "you overestimate your importance. Does your failing company mean nothing to you?"

His gaze flickered to Evelyn standing barefoot on the pavement, then back to the three assailants. Something primal uncoiled in his chest - a mix of protective fury and lingering terror.

Nathan had walked through darkness so Evelyn wouldn't have to. The thought of these vultures laying hands on her ignited something ancient and violent within him.

His bloodshot eyes pinned Victoria in place. Business negotiations? Those happened at his discretion. There were no terms to discuss, no reparations to consider.

What gave this woman the audacity to bargain with him? Years of legitimate dealings had made people forget how he'd clawed his way up from the underworld.

Victoria's smirk faltered as she reassessed her position. The legends about Nathan Blackwood suddenly felt less like exaggeration and more like warnings.

No matter Ashford Enterprises' standing in Santa Barbara, against Blackwood Industries they were insignificant. Her furious gaze shifted to Evelyn as a cruel smile twisted her lips.

"Ms. Sinclair," she spat the name like poison, "how... fortunate for you."

"You certainly have a way with men, Evelyn." Victoria Ashford's lips curled into a mocking smile. "But don't count on being this fortunate again."

Evelyn Sinclair lowered her lashes, concealing the icy contempt in her gaze.

The words ignited something primal within her. This woman actually believed there would be a next time? How utterly delusional. Evelyn stood motionless, refusing to acknowledge Nathan Blackwood's presence from the start.

His intervention meant nothing to her. When Victoria's taunt reached her ears, Evelyn lifted her chin and swept a glacial stare across the assembled guests. Finally, those frosty eyes settled on Nathan.

"Tonight's performance has been... unexpectedly entertaining." Evelyn's voice carried a deceptive lightness, though a dangerous edge lurked beneath the surface. She let the words hang in the air like a suspended blade.

The tension between them crackled like static before a storm. Nathan's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly, his protective stance shifting subtly closer to Evelyn despite her obvious rejection of his aid.

Victoria's smirk faltered for the first time that evening as she registered the unspoken challenge in Evelyn's demeanor. The atmosphere grew thick with unspoken threats and buried history.

Evelyn's fingers absently traced the stem of her champagne flute, her posture deceptively relaxed. Yet everyone present could feel the lethal energy radiating from her - a panther pretending to lounge while preparing to strike.
###Chapter 243 Did She Lay a Hand on You?

The air turned glacial in an instant. A bone-deep chill settled over the space, so silent you could hear a pin drop.

Nathan's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn with a flicker of disbelief. She met his stare with careless defiance. When their eyes clashed, he saw nothing but cold distrust in hers.

His heart stuttered painfully. You think I orchestrated this with Victoria Ashford?

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously. Evelyn remained silent, her lips curling into a mocking smile.

Beside them, Tristan shivered as waves of icy tension rolled off both parties. What the hell is happening?

Why else would you be standing here right now? Evelyn's words made the temperature drop several more degrees.

Tristan quickly stepped forward. "You've got it all wrong! Nathan had nothing to do with this! We were leaving when he wanted to speak with you."

"We searched everywhere, then the doorman mentioned seeing you come this way. We rushed over immediately."

He shot Harrison a look, and the assistant nodded vigorously.

"That's exactly what happened, Ms. Sinclair." Evelyn lowered her lashes slightly, considering their explanation.

Tristan pressed on, "You two were married once. There must still be some lingering affection between you. Why would Nathan ever want to hurt you? When we heard the commotion, he feared for your safety and came running."

"How could you possibly think he'd conspire against you?" Tristan didn't notice the defensive edge creeping into his voice.

He was frustrated on Nathan's behalf! Lingering affection? Evelyn's gaze turned sardonic as she studied Nathan. Their marriage had been a sham from the beginning - what affection could possibly remain?

A soft, derisive laugh escaped her. "In that case, I suppose I owe you my gratitude?" She'd nearly finished handling these thugs herself. What exactly had his dramatic arrival accomplished?

Did they really think she'd swallow this pathetic excuse? Only a fool would believe Nathan had no connection to Victoria Ashford after everything that had transpired between them.

Nathan's expression darkened visibly. Tristan grew increasingly confused - he'd explained everything clearly, so why did the tension between these two only seem to escalate?

Victoria watched the unfolding drama with malicious amusement. "How touching. It appears Mr. Blackwood's feelings were rather one-sided, weren't they?"

"Ms. Sinclair clearly has no shortage of admirers." Evelyn's glare could have melted steel. "Victoria Ashford, you should worry less about spectating and more about your own predicament."

Before Victoria could retort, Harrison suddenly gasped. "Sir! Someone's coming! It's Alexander Sterling and Sebastian Hart!"

Victoria's face twisted with rage at Sebastian's name. She whirled on Evelyn. "When did you call them?" She'd monitored Evelyn's every move - there'd been no opportunity to use a phone.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, casually twirling the stiletto in her hand. Then with practiced ease, she slid the shoe back onto her foot.

She lifted her chin imperiously. "Do you have any idea how much these heels cost? An eight-million-dollar shoe going missing is irrelevant. What matters is how it disappeared."

The hidden tracking device in her footwear connected directly to Sterling Manor's security system. Did Victoria truly think the Sterling heiress would venture out unprotected? How naive.

Alexander arrived with his security team, his presence radiating danger. When Sebastian took in the scene, his eyes burned with fury as he glared at Victoria.

His voice came out low and deadly. "Did she lay a hand on you?"
###Chapter 244 Unlucky

Victoria Ashford trembled violently at Sebastian Hart's words.

The usually charming, poetic, and refined Second Young Master Hart now looked at her with murderous intent.

Years of unwavering devotion and affection for him crumbled to ashes in that moment.

A flicker of anguish crossed her delicate features.

But no one spared her a glance. Evelyn Sinclair saw right through Victoria's schemes.

With a derisive sniff, she stated coldly, "She's not capable of that."

Both Sebastian and Alexander Sterling visibly relaxed at her declaration.

Evelyn Sinclair studied Nathan Blackwood with a complicated expression.

If she hadn't been in real danger, she wouldn't have triggered the emergency alert. Were those two thugs hired by Nathan Blackwood or Victoria Ashford? And why was Mr. Blackwood here? Nathan's face remained impassive as he stared back at Evelyn, his features carved from stone.

Tristan Whitmore quickly stepped forward to explain the situation again, with Harrison echoing his words. Alexander Sterling turned away. It was unthinkable that a man like Nathan Blackwood would stoop to harming Evelyn.

That left only one possibility - Victoria Ashford. Alexander paused, then turned to his sister. "Evie, what do you want to do about this?"

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "We'll simply give Victoria exactly what she wanted. Just a few photos, after all." Her voice turned icy as she addressed the trembling woman. "Ms. Ashford, if you cooperate, this will be much less unpleasant for you."

Victoria's head snapped up, her eyes wide with horror.

How dare Evelyn humiliate her like this in front of Sebastian? She was a business icon in Santa Barbara, a legend in her own right! "You wouldn't dare, Evelyn Sinclair!"

"Oh, but I would," Evelyn replied casually, examining her manicure.

"The Ashford family will make you pay for this! The entire business community in Santa Barbara will turn against you!" Victoria threatened.

Before Evelyn could respond, Alexander let out a dark chuckle. "Using your family name to intimidate my sister? How pathetic. Perhaps it's time for a change in Santa Barbara's business leadership."

Victoria paled instantly. She'd spent a decade building her empire in Santa Barbara, and Alexander Sterling could dismantle it all with a snap of his fingers.

Sebastian Hart grew impatient. "Let's get this over with. Just do as Evelyn says." His dismissive tone made it clear Victoria's humiliation meant nothing to him.

"I'd rather not witness this... unpleasantness," Evelyn murmured with a delicate shudder. Turning on her heel, she strode away with perfect posture, every inch the regal queen. The men could handle the dirty work.

Sebastian naturally followed Evelyn without a backward glance. Victoria's face twisted in ugly despair. She had lost completely.

With a sudden burst of hysterical energy, Victoria screamed at Sebastian's retreating back. "Everything I've done has been for you! I've loved you for ten years! How can you just walk away? That bitch Evelyn only keeps you around as backup! She'll never love you - she's incapable of loving anyone but herself!"

Her carefully maintained composure shattered as she screamed out the secret she'd held for a decade, uncaring of the shocked looks from the men surrounding her.

Victoria Ashford - the ruthless business titan who never bowed to anyone - had been reduced to this pathetic creature when it came to matters of the heart.

She stared desperately at Sebastian's back, praying he would turn around. That he would save her from this nightmare.

The silence stretched unbearably long. Then Sebastian stiffened and slowly turned. His eyes held nothing but pure disgust as he delivered his final blow:

"Consider yourself cursed to have ever loved me."
###Chapter 245 The Plagiarism Scandal

The icy wind howled as Evelyn Sinclair turned away without hesitation. She had no desire to remain in that place a moment longer. By the time she reached Sterling Manor, the clock had already struck midnight.

Dawn broke with golden sunlight streaming through her bedroom windows. Evelyn blinked awake to a breathtaking view of Highland Estates' private arboretum - rare specimens from every continent swaying gently outside her window. A perfect morning.

Yesterday's unpleasantness evaporated like morning mist. Evelyn stretched luxuriously before freshening up and checking her tablet for overnight market movements. A message from Alexander Sterling timestamped 3:47 AM glowed on the screen: [Victoria Ashford situation handled. Sleep well, little sister.]

Already? Alexander's protective instincts were legendary, and Evelyn could only imagine what ruthless measures he'd employed.

But one question lingered - what had been Nathan Blackwood's role in last night's events? Those fathomless dark eyes had held such complex emotions when they'd locked onto hers.

Evelyn shook her head sharply. Nathan's thoughts and feelings were irrelevant now. His timely appearance meant nothing to her. She'd survived just fine without his intervention.

Stepping into her walk-in closet, Evelyn selected a couture ensemble from the season's most exclusive collection. The soft rustle of silk was interrupted by her ringing phone. Isabella Montgomery's name flashed on the screen.

"You're more reliable than my alarm clock," Evelyn teased as she answered.

Isabella's voice crackled with indignation. "Why didn't you tell me about last night's drama?"

Ah. The gossip mill had already started grinding.

"Well, you know now," Evelyn replied lightly.

"Only because I heard Victoria Ashford got caught trying to ambush you! Can you believe she confessed her pathetic crush on Sebastian Hart right before getting arrested? And managed to offend both Nathan and Alexander in one night? Where does that woman get her audacity?"

Isabella's outrage was almost comical. Almost.

"Those weren't just regular bodyguards with her," Isabella continued, suddenly serious. "They were former MMA champions. Even with your training..."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. MMA champions? If she'd gotten lucky with one attacker in the dark, the second might have overpowered her. The realization hit like a physical blow.

So Nathan's intervention had been... necessary? The thought tasted bitter. "I'm fine," she forced out after a beat. "They arrived in time."

"Thank God. Rumor has it Victoria was shipped back to Santa Barbara sobbing uncontrollably. Alexander's already blacklisted Ashford Enterprises from all Sterling Corporation affiliates. That woman's career is finished."

Evelyn listened impassively. Alexander's ruthlessness came as no surprise - she would have done the same. Their conversation continued during Evelyn's commute, ending abruptly when her car pulled up to Sterling Corporation headquarters.

The lobby doors parted before her Jimmy Choo heels. Receptionists straightened instantly as Evelyn glided past, returning their greetings with a regal nod.

Bennett materialized at the elevator with her morning agenda. "Meeting in ten minutes, Ms. Sinclair. However—"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Dominic Kingsley from Kingsley Tech has been waiting since seven."

Evelyn's perfectly manicured fingers stilled on her tablet. "Reschedule the meeting. Show Mr. Kingsley in immediately."

Dominic's expression when he entered could have frozen the Mediterranean. His wire-rimmed glasses did nothing to soften the storm in his eyes.

The Aether Core project had been progressing flawlessly. What could possibly warrant this tension?

The door clicked shut behind Bennett. Dominic didn't sit.

"Evelyn," he said without preamble, "our AI chip designs have been stolen."

The words hung between them like a guillotine blade.

"By someone inside Sterling Corporation."
###Chapter 246 Confronting the Past

Evelyn Sinclair remained silent, her piercing gaze locked onto Dominic Kingsley's face. His expression betrayed no hint of jest. The tension between them grew thick enough to cut with a knife, and Evelyn could feel her stomach twisting into knots.

The revolutionary aspect of their AI chip lay in its unprecedented diagnostic capabilities - detecting both latent and manifest illnesses in human subjects. This groundbreaking achievement had been proudly announced to the global community.

To shield Donovan Sterling from unnecessary scrutiny, they'd attributed the design to a collaborative effort between Sterling Corporation, Kingsley Tech, and Kensington Group.

If Sterling Corporation suddenly claimed exclusive rights, it would spark rumors of a fractured alliance between the three corporate giants. The resulting stock market turmoil would be catastrophic.

Nothing good could come from such reckless actions. This project represented years of painstaking work and billions in investments.

It would be tragic to see it derailed by petty corporate politics before reaching its full potential.

Evelyn steadied her breathing. "Do you know which subsidiary is responsible?" With countless enterprises under Sterling Corporation's umbrella, Evelyn couldn't possibly monitor them all.

Dominic clearly had inside information. He produced a folded note from his jacket pocket, sliding it across her desk with deliberate precision. "Nathan discovered it's Charles Sterling in Charleston." Evelyn's brow furrowed instantly.

That scheming relative was causing trouble again. How utterly predictable. Evelyn mentally catalogued her options. The most effective way to dispel rumors was with irrefutable evidence.

"If all else fails," Dominic suggested casually, "you could always bring your former flame into this." Evelyn's head snapped up in confusion. What former flame? Since when did she have-

"Sunner!" Dominic clarified. "If he makes a statement, this whole plagiarism accusation disappears. Nobody would believe the legendary Sunner would steal intellectual property."

Evelyn rolled her eyes so hard she saw stars. She summoned Bennett to escort their visitor out.

As Dominic exited Sterling Corporation headquarters, he pulled out his phone. "I've informed Evelyn," he reported. "But Nathan, this is official business. Wouldn't this be the perfect opportunity for you to see her in person?"

The line remained silent except for the faint click of a lighter. After several tense seconds, Nathan's voice finally came through, cold and hollow. "She despises me. The last thing she wants is my presence."

No sooner had Dominic left than Evelyn launched an investigation into Sterling Corporation's Charleston operations. The findings confirmed her suspicions.

By early afternoon, social media was ablaze with speculation. Sterling Corporation's Charleston branch had prematurely announced their "exclusive" AI doctor project, sparking intense debate:

[Wasn't this supposed to be a three-way collaboration?]
[Corporate partnerships are always temporary.]
[Are they rushing this to market too quickly?]
[Has Evelyn Sinclair lost her moral compass?]

The public assumed Charleston's actions were sanctioned by Evelyn herself, making her the target of widespread criticism. Sterling Corporation's stock began a slow but steady decline.

Fortunately, Kingsley Tech and Kensington Group refrained from capitalizing on the situation, allowing Sterling Corporation to handle its internal crisis.

Without hesitation, Evelyn ordered her car. She would confront Charles Sterling personally in Charleston. Alexander Sterling chose to remain behind, collaborating with Kingsley Tech to trace the information leak.

During the three-hour drive, Evelyn monitored the online discourse with growing concern. The mixed public reaction spelled trouble for Sterling Corporation's reputation. Trust, once lost, was difficult to regain.

"We've arrived, President Sinclair." Bennett opened her door. Evelyn stepped out, her designer heels clicking decisively against the pavement as she marched toward the building entrance.

"Hey! You can't just walk in here-" The drowsy receptionist jerked upright, her complaint dying mid-sentence when she recognized the imposing figure before her. "P-President Sinclair?"
###Chapter 247: Partners in Profit

Five sharply dressed figures trailed behind Evelyn Sinclair, their tailored suits exuding power and authority. Bennett moved swiftly to press the elevator button, his movements precise and practiced.

Upstairs, the receptionist frantically alerted the office of Evelyn's arrival. Genevieve Dawson, Lydia Smith's cousin and secretary, barely glanced up from painting her nails. "She thinks she can just waltz in here and take a cut of our profits now that we're making money?" Genevieve scoffed. "Dream on."

The words reached Evelyn the moment her bodyguard opened the office door. Genevieve didn't even rise from her seat. "Ms. Sterling," she drawled, "the General Manager isn't available. Try again another time."

Bennett's jaw tightened. No employee had ever dared speak to Evelyn with such disrespect. Without acknowledging Genevieve, Evelyn turned to Bennett. "Call an executive meeting in five minutes. Anyone who isn't present is fired."

"Understood," Bennett replied smoothly.

Genevieve's face twisted in disbelief. "Who do you think you are? This isn't your company! The General Manager—"

Evelyn strode past her into the conference room, pausing only to deliver a cutting glance over her shoulder. "General Manager? You mean Genevieve Dawson? Of course she's your cousin. But this isn't Dawson territory. You have no authority here."

Bennett almost pitied the woman. Every word out of Genevieve's mouth was another nail in her professional coffin.

Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Sterling Corporation belongs to the Sterlings. A Dawson has no power here. Pack your things and leave. Now."

Genevieve's face paled. "Y-You can't—"

Bennett stepped forward. "She's the President of Sterling Corporation. And you'd do well to inform Genevieve Dawson that her presence is required immediately."

As Evelyn entered the conference room, she added, "And call my uncle, Charles Sterling, while you're at it." That incompetent uncle of hers couldn't even manage this small branch without causing problems. If William Sterling hadn't handed the company to Charles years ago, he'd still be wasting away in obscurity. Countless deficits had been covered for this Charleston branch over the years. If they couldn't appreciate that, it was time to revoke their privileges.

Five minutes later, Evelyn surveyed the assembled executives—those loyalists her father had planted to monitor the situation. Bennett distributed documents as Evelyn cut straight to the point. "I assume you've all seen this morning's news. Sterling Corporation partnered with Kingsley Tech on the AI project. So why has this branch developed an identical product and released it first?"

Silence hung heavy for several seconds before a bald executive at the front spoke up. "We had no knowledge of this. Margaret Dawson keeps us at arm's length like criminals, and Charles Sterling barely involves himself with company affairs—"

The conference room door burst open before he could finish. "Starting a meeting without us?" Margaret Dawson swept in, Genevieve trailing behind her like a shadow. Dressed in garish designer labels that screamed new money, Margaret carried herself with none of the caution she'd shown at Sterling Manor. Apparently, Charles Sterling had forgiven her for backing another man—a fact that baffled Evelyn.
###Chapter 248 Were You Raised Without Manners?

Evelyn Sinclair sat regally at the head of the conference table, her manicured fingers slowly turning pages of the damning documents before her. The cold disdain in her emerald eyes could freeze molten lava.

"You arrived just in time." Her voice dripped with venom. "Explain to me how you stole Kingsley Tech's proprietary medical research?"

Genevieve Dawson stiffened visibly, but Margaret Dawson recovered faster. "Stole? That's preposterous! We invested heavily in our own R&D team at the Charleston branch."

Margaret gestured dramatically. "We've secured pre-orders from seventeen major corporations totaling over a billion dollars. Evelyn, this is a golden opportunity we can't afford to miss."

Evelyn's laughter was sharp enough to cut glass. "Pre-sales? With penalty clauses triple the contract value?" She leaned forward, her gaze piercing. "Did you honestly think I wouldn't discover your little scheme?"

The entire boardroom held its breath. All eyes darted between the three women - the Sterling heiress versus the Dawson mother-daughter duo who'd been running the Charleston branch like personal fiefdom.

Margaret's lips curled in triumph. "Your uncle Charles personally approved this venture. While we may not share the Sterling name, his authority here is absolute."

Evelyn didn't even blink. "I've already filed criminal charges with the Charleston PD. Every executive involved in this fraud will be prosecuted - from the boardroom to the mailroom."

She'd coordinated with William Sterling before this confrontation. The Charleston branch required complete restructuring after this scandal.

Genevieve's face drained of color. Margaret's confident smirk faltered. They'd banked on Evelyn backing down if they dragged Charles Sterling into this.

The heavy oak doors burst open. "What the hell is going on here?" Charles Sterling stormed in, his face purple with rage. Clearly Margaret's people had fed him a distorted version of events.

Margaret immediately clung to his arm like a lifeline. "Charles! Thank God you're here! Your niece has gone completely rogue - she's trying to have us all arrested!"

Charles turned his fury on Evelyn. "You have no authority here! This is my division!"

Evelyn met his rage with icy calm. "The Charleston branch stands accused of intellectual property theft from Kingsley Tech. The police are already investigating."

"You called the cops? On family?" Charles sputtered. "This is an internal matter! Patent disputes happen daily in our industry - most never get resolved due to lack of concrete evidence!"

Genevieve chimed in indignantly, "We're making money for the Sterling Corporation! Shouldn't we be working together instead of tearing each other down?"

Evelyn's smile could curdle milk. "You're not worthy of partnership."

Charles exploded. "How dare you speak to me like that!"

"Tell me, Uncle Charles," Evelyn purred, "how quickly you forgave these two for keeping a lover behind your back. Do you enjoy being cuckolded?"

Charles slammed both fists on the conference table with a thunderous crash. The room plunged into shocked silence, every executive gaping at Evelyn's nuclear verbal strike.

Evelyn remained perfectly composed in her seat, observing with cold amusement as Genevieve and Margaret's faces drained of color.

A bitter smirk curled at the corners of her lips.

They really thought they could challenge me?

Margaret reacted first, her carefully constructed facade crumbling instantly.

The venom in her glare was unmistakable.

Her words came out in a poisonous hiss.

"Evelyn Sinclair, you manipulative witch! How dare you speak to Charles that way?"

She leaned forward, her manicured nails digging into the armrests.

"Was your mother too busy dying to teach you basic decency?"

The air in the room turned glacial.

Evelyn's fingers twitched imperceptibly, the only outward sign of the storm brewing beneath her calm exterior.

Genevieve gasped dramatically, clutching her pearls in fake shock.

But Evelyn saw the calculating gleam in the younger woman's eyes.

This little performance had been rehearsed.

The tension stretched taut between them, like a wire about to snap.

Somewhere in the mansion, a clock chimed ominously.

Evelyn finally moved, rising with the grace of a panther stalking its prey.

Her voice, when she spoke, was deceptively soft.

"My mother," she said slowly, "taught me everything I needed to know about dealing with snakes."

Margaret flinched as if struck.

Genevieve's smug expression faltered.

And in that charged moment, Evelyn knew - the game had changed.

The first domino had fallen.

Now they would all see where the pieces landed.
###Chapter 249 She Has No Integrity

Charles Sterling couldn't prevent the venomous words from escaping Margaret Dawson's lips. The atmosphere in the room turned glacial in an instant.

An icy chill spread through the air, making everyone tense.

It was common knowledge that Evelyn Sinclair's mother had passed away years ago. The Sterling family considered it a forbidden topic, too painful to discuss.

If William Sterling heard such remarks, he would have Margaret eliminated without hesitation. And Evelyn? She wouldn't tolerate such disrespect either.

Margaret finally noticed Evelyn's darkening expression and realized her grave mistake. She instinctively turned to Charles for support, but his earlier anger had vanished completely.

The tension stretched unbearably long as Evelyn's cold gaze remained fixed on Margaret. Her eyes held a dangerous depth.

A humorless smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Margaret Dawson," she said in a voice like frozen steel, "I've been far too lenient with you, haven't I?"

From the moment Margaret spoke, Evelyn had no intention of letting this slide.

Margaret stiffened, about to explode in anger when Charles grabbed her arm roughly. "Silence! You've forfeited your right to speak here." His sudden hostility confused her.

"Charles, I only said that for your sake—" Margaret began, but Charles cut her off, his jaw clenched tight.

"Evelyn," he said, forcing calm into his voice, "she didn't mean it. But business is business. This profitable project shouldn't be abandoned. We've hired top research teams."

"World-renowned specialists, both domestic and international," he continued. "Even if investigated, we have nothing to hide!"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp with derision. "This project required decades of research—a global breakthrough. What so-called experts did you hire?"

"Specialists?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "Not even the collective genius of every expert worldwide could match Donovan Sterling's brilliance. How shameless can you be?"

"Do you intend to ruin both this project and Sterling Corporation's reputation?" Evelyn's eyes flashed. "Never!"

Genevieve Dawson smirked arrogantly. "It's Professor Meyer, the nation's foremost physicist. His work has been published internationally. Who dares accuse us of plagiarism?"

Professor Meyer was indeed a celebrated figure in physics—not that Evelyn would recognize his name, Genevieve thought smugly.

Charles stepped forward, adopting a conciliatory tone. "Evelyn, your father and I are brothers. Would I ever harm our family business?"

Evelyn lifted her gaze, her expression unreadable. "Uncle Charles, the auditors Alexander sent won't fail. Your financial discrepancies are obvious. I've already discussed this with Father."

"This Charleston branch will undergo restructuring after bankruptcy. All staff will be reevaluated and reassigned accordingly." Her voice turned icy. "Margaret and her daughter, along with all their distant relatives, can leave immediately."

"As for contract compensation," Evelyn continued, "you'll serve as legal representative for the new company if you accept responsibility."

"Otherwise," she concluded, "retirement is your only option." This wasn't a negotiation—it was a decree.

The staff visibly relaxed, as if seeing salvation after a long ordeal. Margaret and Genevieve's faces twisted in fury.

Years of scheming, destroyed in moments?

Charles's face darkened with rage. His barely controlled frown deepened into a scowl. This damn girl was determined to oppose him!

"You—" Charles refused to believe his brother would approve this. He pulled out his phone to call William, but the calls went unanswered. Frustration and panic set in.

Evelyn smiled coolly. "Father left for Philmont on his private jet this morning. Currently, I'm in charge of Sterling Corporation."

The battle was already lost. The Sterlings had shown remarkable mercy already.

Evelyn rose gracefully, her piercing gaze sweeping the room before settling on Margaret and Genevieve. She locked eyes with Genevieve.

"Your mother isn't dead," Evelyn said with deliberate cruelty. "Pity she couldn't teach you manners—she has no integrity herself."
###Chapter 250 The Plagiarism Scandal

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't one to forgive easily. She could maintain a calm facade after being insulted, but she never forgot. Every cutting remark from Genevieve and Margaret was carefully noted in her private journal.

Retribution would come in due time. Ignoring their whispered taunts, Evelyn lifted her chin and strode away in her designer heels.

Just breathing the same air as those women made her nauseous. Her bodyguard Marcus swiftly opened the car door for her.

Every movement she made exuded natural elegance, as if she'd been born to command attention and respect.

Back at Sterling Corporation headquarters, her team had already initiated the takeover process for the Charleston branch. With this in motion, Evelyn could afford to ignore the online rumors temporarily. The truth would soon be undeniable.

Yet Charles Sterling refused to concede defeat. The next day, he released a corporate video statement.

Professor Meyer stood before the cameras, indignantly accusing others of stealing his research. His carefully worded accusations subtly targeted Kingsley Tech's project, reigniting the controversy.

The internet exploded with debate. Who was plagiarizing whom? Public opinion remained divided.

[Professor Meyer is a nationally recognized expert with numerous patents. Why would he lie?]

[Did Kingsley Tech buy someone else's technology with their financial muscle?]

[Professor Meyer has an impeccable reputation. He doesn't seem like the type to fabricate claims.]

[I was Meyer's former student. He's a wolf in sheep's clothing who steals students' work!]

[All his overseas research achievements were taken from his students.]

The dissenting voices were quickly drowned in the sea of comments.

Evelyn watched the escalating situation with detached calm. Bennett approached cautiously. "President Sinclair, should we contact media platforms to suppress the trending topics?"

She took a deep breath, forcing her voice to remain steady despite the cold fury in her eyes. "No need. Let's add fuel to the fire and watch them burn themselves."

Bennett immediately understood her meaning. The press conference was arranged with simple yet solemn precision.

Few expected Evelyn to face the media storm head-on during this crisis. Both Nathan Blackwood and Dominic Kingsley received invitations. Their attendance wasn't necessary, but they came anyway.

They addressed the issue directly, though Evelyn remained the focal point. Their presence beside her demonstrated their unwavering support for this partnership.

Dominic carried himself with refined grace, his demeanor naturally inspiring trust. Nathan exuded aristocratic elegance - his mere presence commanded respect without uttering a word.

Evelyn made no attempt to downplay her appearance, wearing an exclusive haute couture ensemble that accentuated her striking beauty. She effortlessly commanded attention wherever she went.

Every camera angle captured her perfection. Had she entered entertainment, her looks alone could have secured her the industry's top spot.

Reporters momentarily forgot their purpose, mesmerized by her presence before refocusing on their questions. The atmosphere grew increasingly tense.

"President Sinclair, what's your response to the plagiarism allegations?"

Evelyn didn't evade the question. "The management at Sterling Corporation's Charleston branch acted improperly by plagiarizing our tripartite collaboration's results."

Her statement sent shockwaves through the room. "Are you suggesting this was directed by Sterling Corporation?" a reporter pressed.

Evelyn smiled calmly. "Sterling Corporation has numerous subsidiaries operating under independent legal entities. Our internal investigation confirmed the Charleston branch engaged in unethical practices."

"We've filed a police report and decided to liquidate all Charleston operations. Following bankruptcy proceedings, we'll reorganize completely. Sterling Corporation won't tolerate such misconduct."

"We welcome oversight from regulatory authorities." Her voice remained measured yet carried undeniable authority.

Her words resonated powerfully. This marked perhaps the first time a corporation voluntarily admitted fault at significant financial cost to preserve integrity.

The livestream went viral instantly, flooding with comments:

[That's how ethical corporations should operate!]

[President Sinclair, will you marry me?]

[This press conference features the most attractive trio in business history!]
###Chapter 251 Shall We Make It Official?

The room fell into stunned silence. Though the journalists kept firing questions, their tone had noticeably softened.

"Given these circumstances, could you clarify the situation regarding Professor Meyer's video? If Sterling Corporation acknowledges the plagiarism, doesn't that mean Professor Meyer was the one who—"

"Academic theft remains the most unforgivable sin in our field," another reporter cut in.

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curved into a radiant, self-assured smile. Rising gracefully, her voice carried both warmth and steel. "The success of our tripartite research initiative wasn't due to Professor Meyer's contributions, but rather the intellectual property he stole from us."

Her gaze swept across the room as she delivered the coup de grâce. "Allow me to introduce the true mastermind behind our research team—the youngest scientist ever to receive the prestigious Breakthrough Prize in our industry—Donovan Sterling."

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd. Every eye turned toward the side entrance where a strikingly handsome man emerged with effortless poise.

This wasn't the stereotypical image of a stuffy academic—Donovan moved with the casual elegance of a runway model, his piercing gaze scanning the room with amused detachment.

Every journalist present recognized him instantly. With Donovan Sterling's involvement, Professor Meyer's career in the scientific community was effectively over.

Donovan paused deliberately, allowing the flashing cameras to capture his arrival.

"Come join me," Evelyn murmured, her voice carrying just enough for the microphones to pick up. Donovan's responding smile as their eyes met sent the reporters into a frenzy.

The chemistry between them was electric. Social media feeds exploded with live reactions: [Is that THE Donovan Sterling?] [President Sinclair is glowing!] [The way he looks at her—I'm deceased!] [Someone check if I'm dreaming!]

As Donovan took his seat, his relaxed demeanor contrasted sharply with the storm brewing elsewhere in the room. Nathan Blackwood's jaw clenched visibly, while Dominic Kingsley leaned over to whisper, "She actually got the prodigy scientist to show up? President Sinclair's connections never cease to amaze me."

Nathan's response came through gritted teeth. "This isn't just professional. There's something more between them."

Dominic smirked. "Jealousy doesn't suit you, Nathan. Though I suppose your list of romantic rivals just grew considerably longer."

Before Nathan could retort, a bold reporter seized the moment: "President Sinclair, what exactly is your relationship with Donovan Sterling? Colleagues? Or something more... intimate?"

The room collectively held its breath. This crossed professional boundaries—Evelyn had every right to shut down the question.

Instead, she exchanged a knowing glance with Donovan, her smile turning playful. "Shall we tell them?" she asked, loud enough for all to hear.

Donovan's answering grin was wolfish. "Your call, little sister."

Every camera lens focused with laser intensity. Nathan's knuckles turned white, his entire body rigid with tension.

Evelyn let the suspense build, savoring the moment. Then, under the glare of spotlights and before dozens of reporters, she reached for Donovan's hand, intertwining their fingers with deliberate intimacy.

"Very well," she announced, her voice rich with pride. "Let me properly introduce Donovan Sterling—yes, of the Sterling Corporation Sterlings. My father William Sterling's son, my brilliant second brother, and incidentally, one of the most groundbreaking scientists of our generation."

The revelation hit like a thunderclap. Cameras flashed wildly as the siblings' united front sent shockwaves through the industry—and shattered Nathan Blackwood's composure completely.
###Chapter 252 She's Like a Little White Rabbit

The moment the words left her lips, the grand hall fell into stunned silence. Then, like a sudden storm, the room erupted into chaos. Online, the reactions were even more explosive.

[No way! What kind of plot twist is this?!]
[I thought I was President Sinclair, marry me instead!]
[AAAAAHHHH!!! Evelyn has three god-tier brothers?! Why don’t I have any?!]
[I thought the biggest reveal was Lucas being a Sterling—how did they manage to keep Donovan a secret too?!]
[The legendary Donovan Sterling could’ve coasted on his family name, but he built his empire from scratch. Respect.]
[Our Julian still has a shot! President Sinclair, don’t forget about him!]

Inside the venue, the murmurs grew so loud that the original purpose of the press conference was completely overshadowed. What was meant to be a brief announcement stretched into an hour-long spectacle.

Dominic Kingsley tugged at Nathan Blackwood’s sleeve, refusing to let go. "Did you hear that?"

Nathan snapped out of his daze. Of course he had heard it. Evelyn’s voice echoed in his mind, replaying on an endless loop.

Donovan was a Sterling. He was Evelyn’s brother.

Nathan should have guessed—Donovan had always been unusually familiar with Evelyn. On the surface, Nathan remained composed, but beneath that calm exterior, his emotions churned violently.

He had nearly lost his temper earlier.

Dominic’s tone dripped with sarcastic regret. "What a surprise, huh? Turns out they’re actually siblings."

Nathan’s lips curled slightly, accentuating his sharp jawline and giving him an air of restrained nobility. "Evelyn has always had high standards. Otherwise, why would she have fallen for me in the first place?"

Dominic rolled his eyes. Was this man seriously complimenting himself? Too bad for him—Evelyn’s tastes had clearly evolved.

After the press conference, Evelyn and Donovan politely ushered the crowd out. The reporters left with more than they bargained for—not only had they witnessed Nathan’s rare public appearance, but Donovan’s revelation had been the cherry on top.

At the entrance, Dominic and Nathan exchanged farewells. Dominic’s assistant kept urging him to leave, but he lingered, watching as Nathan checked his watch with deliberate nonchalance.

Nathan didn’t seem in any hurry. His gaze drifted to Evelyn, who was still tidying up inside the venue. Her sleek, understated outfit made her stand out effortlessly.

Dominic let out a soft sigh. "Who would’ve thought she’d handle such a mess so smoothly?"

Though Sterling Corporation had taken a hit, their reputation had emerged stronger than ever.

"A clean victory," Dominic mused. "Evelyn’s the only one who could walk out of this corporate battlefield unscathed."

Nathan’s expression darkened slightly. "She’s more like a little white rabbit."

In his eyes, Evelyn’s methods were still too soft. The executives in Charleston should’ve faced more than just financial penalties—they deserved full accountability.

Dominic’s lips twitched. He had no words.

Evelyn approached them with a polished, professional smile. Her expression gave nothing away—she didn’t even glance at Nathan as she addressed Dominic directly.

"This matter will blow over soon. My apologies for the inconvenience."

Dominic shrugged. "As long as it’s resolved, I’m satisfied. Well done, President Sinclair. Today’s news should send Sterling Corporation’s stocks soaring again. Congratulations."

He was, of course, referring to Donovan’s grand reveal.

Evelyn’s smile remained diplomatic. "A win for both of us. Congratulations to you as well, President Kingsley."

She glanced at her watch. "It’s getting late. I still have work to attend to, so I’ll take my leave."

Dominic gave a slight nod, then shot Nathan a meaningful look before turning away.

Left alone, Nathan studied Evelyn. Every movement was graceful, every gesture refined—yet the smile she offered him was nothing more than polite artifice. His chest tightened.

"Mr. Blackwood," she spoke first, her tone cool. "I’d also like to thank you for having President Kingsley inform me about the situation in Charleston."

Nathan hesitated. "And how do you plan to thank me?"
###Chapter 253 Unfortunate News

Evelyn froze mid-step, her brows arching in surprise. Huh? Shouldn't his response have been something like, "You're welcome, it was nothing"?

Nathan Blackwood truly didn’t play by conventional rules.

Suppressing the urge to roll her eyes, Evelyn kept her expression composed, offering him a polite but distant smile.

"I merely did what was necessary." With that, she turned to leave.

Nathan’s voice halted her retreat. "Believe me or not, what happened that night with Victoria had nothing to do with me." His jaw was tight, his tone laced with frustration.

Since when did Nathan Blackwood—ruthless, untouchable—care about justifying himself? Yet here he was, insistent on clarifying something so trivial.

The memory of Evelyn’s distrustful gaze that night haunted him. It had cut deeper than any blade, leaving him grappling with an unfamiliar helplessness—the agony of being shut out of her world, of her no longer believing a single word he said.

Evelyn’s shoulders stiffened imperceptibly.

She had nearly forgotten about that incident after Bennett’s investigation. To her, the truth didn’t matter anymore. Nathan’s sudden insistence on explaining himself was baffling.

"Mr. Blackwood, whether you were involved or not is irrelevant now. The matter is over." Her tone was cool, final. She walked away without another glance.

The plagiarism scandal had concluded, leaving the so-called Professor Meyer disgraced and publicly condemned.

The real thief behind the stolen chip turned out to be Meyer’s young lover—an intern at Kingsley Tech and a classmate of Genevieve Dawson’s. The police had swiftly arrested her.

Meanwhile, the bankruptcy proceedings for the Charleston branch had begun. Charles Sterling, refusing to accept defeat, stormed Sterling Tower repeatedly, demanding to see William and causing a scene.

"How dare you do this to me? I’m a Sterling!"

Evelyn sat in her office, a half-eaten dessert forgotten in front of her. The sweetness had turned to ash in her mouth.

Bennett studied her expression. "Should I have security remove him? The staff have been wanting to suggest it for a while."

But out of deference to Evelyn’s familial ties, no one had dared.

Evelyn’s gaze dropped to the photos Charleston’s authorities had sent her. Her expression darkened.

"Let him in."

Bennett hesitated but obeyed without question.

"I thought you’d be too ashamed to face me!" Charles barged in, his unshaven face haggard, his eyes bloodshot. "Evelyn, have you no conscience?"

Evelyn poured him a cup of tea and set it on the table with deliberate calm.

"Uncle Charles, I have unfortunate news for you."

He froze at her icy tone.

"As of ten minutes ago, the financial team at the Charleston branch discovered all company funds have vanished. Every property and stock under your name has been liquidated."

His face paled.

"You don’t have a single cent left to pay your investors."

Charles hadn’t even taken a seat. His body locked in place before he erupted into violent coughs, his face flushing crimson.

"You’re lying!"

Evelyn projected the photos onto the wall, forcing him to confront the evidence.

"While you were here throwing tantrums, your mistress and stepdaughter emptied your accounts and fled."

The images showed the two women with a burly middle-aged man—Genevieve’s father and Margaret’s husband—sneaking through an airport. The implications were damning.

Charles recognized the man instantly. He had investigated him after Evelyn’s warning at her birthday gala.

Yet here he was, making a fool of himself while they escaped with his fortune.

Evelyn watched the rage and humiliation twist his features. The fire was stoked perfectly.

"Uncle Charles," she said smoothly, "my father is willing to cover your debts—on one condition."

She let the silence stretch before delivering the final blow.

"You withdraw from all Sterling Corporation businesses, including the shares you secretly purchased."

Her smile was razor-sharp. "Immediately."
###Chapter 254 Without a Doubt

Charles Sterling's entire body went rigid, his face twisting into an ugly grimace.

"You...you knew about that?" His voice cracked with disbelief. He had been so careful, selecting only the minor shareholders who joined Sterling Corporation later to quietly acquire their stakes. Yet somehow, she'd discovered everything.

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Sterling Corporation is my father's life's work, not some inherited family business. By rights, you have no claim to any part of it."

She leaned forward slightly, her piercing gaze locking onto his. "The only reason Father hasn't exposed you is out of brotherly affection. But if you continue down this path, you'll lose even that."

Charles stood frozen, his eyes flickering with sudden remorse. All the fury that had propelled him here evaporated, leaving him hollow and numb.

Evelyn placed the stack of incriminating photos in his trembling hands. "Uncle Charles, surely you don't want our family fortune falling into the hands of those two women?" Without another word, Charles turned and stalked out.

A soft chuckle escaped Evelyn as she pulled out her phone to text William. (Come home now!)

Bennett still looked stunned. "Ms. Sinclair, aren't we going after Genevieve and Margaret? They took nearly everything from the Charleston branch."

Evelyn arched an elegant brow. "No need. Let Uncle Charles handle it personally. He'll appreciate the...satisfaction of catching them himself."

Only by seeing their betrayal with his own eyes would he understand the depth of their deception. When the board meeting reconvened later, Alexander couldn't stop praising her strategic brilliance.

Word spread quickly through Sterling Corporation about how their young president had masterfully handled the crisis. This was no spoiled heiress playing at business - Evelyn Sinclair commanded respect through sharp intellect and decisive action.

Meanwhile at Blackwood Enterprises, Nathan had just concluded his own meeting when Harrison approached.

"Sir, the invitations for the Global Economic Forum have arrived. You've been selected again. Should we arrange your travel itinerary?"

This exclusive gathering brought together only the most influential business leaders worldwide, with no regard for social status or inherited privilege. Only true industry titans received the embossed gold invitations - fewer than twenty globally each year.

Nathan paused as he accepted the heavy envelope, his fingers tracing the raised lettering. "Associates can bring one guest, correct?"

Harrison blinked in surprise. While the rules technically allowed it, few ever exercised the privilege. The forum's prestige relied on maintaining an exacting balance - for every new attendee, another must depart.

"Who did you have in mind, sir? Tristan?" He immediately regretted the suggestion when Nathan's expression darkened.

"Give the invitation to Evelyn. Whether she attends is her decision." His tone left no room for discussion as he strode into his office.

Harrison mentally kicked himself. Of course he meant Ms. Sinclair! Though if Evelyn appeared at such an elite gathering, the Sterling family's ascendancy would become unstoppable.

Back at Sterling Corporation, Evelyn studied the unmarked invitation before her. Though no name appeared, the weight of the envelope spoke volumes. This was unlike any corporate event she'd ever attended.

She remembered hearing whispers about this legendary forum during her business studies in Europe - the kind of opportunity money couldn't buy, no matter how much one possessed.

Bennett watched her carefully, having sensed something significant when Harrison delivered the envelope earlier. "Will you be going, Ms. Sinclair? Given Mr. Blackwood's involvement..."

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "Without a doubt."
###Chapter 255 Fifty Seconds Left

Bennett was stunned. Normally, Evelyn Sinclair would go out of her way to avoid any place Nathan Blackwood might appear. So why wasn't she avoiding this meeting?

Evelyn held the invitation, raising a brow.

She didn’t understand why Nathan was being so generous, offering her this opportunity. But she wasn’t about to question it—not when it was this rare.

"Book me a flight," Evelyn told Bennett.

Bennett hesitated. "Mr. Harrison mentioned that Mr. Blackwood already arranged it. If you want to go, you just need to board the plane."

Evelyn clenched her jaw.

Damn it. Did Nathan Blackwood read her mind?

After a moment, she snatched the invitation and went to find Alexander Sterling.

"Big Brother, that bastard Nathan Blackwood gave me this. I’m going."

Alexander glanced at the invitation, surprise flickering across his face before he smiled calmly.

"I was planning to take you in a few years. You’re still young, and people might underestimate you because of your lack of seniority. But if you want to go now, I’ll come with you."

Evelyn’s eyes lit up. "You’re coming too?"

Alexander opened a drawer and pulled out a thick stack of invitations—all from the founding members of the Montevista Business Summit.

"I never bothered going before. Too much hassle."

Evelyn swallowed.

Of course. Alexander’s effortless arrogance never failed to impress.

Two days later, Evelyn arrived quietly at the airport, Leo the AI tiger wrapped snugly in a Malo cashmere shawl. His little head peeked out occasionally, curious about the bustling crowd.

She wouldn’t have bothered disguising him if she weren’t worried about causing a scene.

"Be good," she murmured, stroking his head. "I’ll let you explore when we land."

On the plane, the business-class seat beside her remained empty.

Evelyn exhaled in relief—until her phone buzzed with an unknown number.

[President Sinclair, President Blackwood had an emergency. His flight was rescheduled to 7 PM. Someone will meet you in Montevista. —Harrison]

Evelyn scoffed.

Good. The last thing she needed was being trapped on a flight with him.

Leo, however, had already drawn attention. More than once, Evelyn had to explain that he was just an advanced AI robot.

To prove it, Leo played dead on cue—stiff, tongue lolling, eyes rolled back.

The flight attendant left, satisfied.

Evelyn patted his head. "All clear."

The plane took off smoothly. Evelyn reviewed some documents, then leaned back to rest—until a deafening explosion rocked the cabin.

The plane lurched violently.

Evelyn jolted awake, heart hammering as the aircraft shuddered, completely out of control. Screams erupted around her.

Flight attendants shouted instructions, but no one listened.

Evelyn clutched Leo, her face pale. Outside the window, storm clouds churned, lightning flashing ominously.

If she had known this would happen, she never would have come.

Leo wriggled free, his mechanical pupils shifting as infrared sensors scanned the cockpit.

Within seconds, his voice turned grave.

"Mama, the engine is irreparably damaged. We’re at 5,000 feet. Coordinates: 100N, 80E. The braking system is failing. Crash probability: 95%."

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

"What do we do?"

The desperate cries around her were deafening. Her hands trembled as she gripped the armrest.

In all her years, she never imagined dying like this.

Everything she’d ever done suddenly felt insignificant.

Leo’s voice was urgent. "Put on the life jacket and oxygen mask. The plane will lose control in one minute. Prepare to jump. Survival chance: 50%."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Fifty percent?

That was a death sentence.

But she followed his instructions anyway, hands shaking but never stopping.

"Fifty seconds left."

"Forty seconds."

Then—

BOOM.

The world froze.
###Chapter 256 Her Name Is on the List of Casualties

At Kingsley Tech headquarters.

The golden hues of sunset painted the Manhattan skyline as Nathan Blackwood emerged from the boardroom.

His custom Patek Philippe watch showed 6:47 PM.

He still needed to catch his flight to Montevista. Evelyn Sinclair was waiting there for their postponed reconciliation dinner.

Nathan loosened his Armani tie with one hand while reaching for his phone with the other.

Before he could summon Harrison, his assistant came barreling through the glass doors uncharacteristically disheveled.

Harrison's usually impeccable appearance was shattered - tie askew, hair mussed, eyes bloodshot.

In twelve years of service, Nathan had never seen his unflappable assistant in such a state.

"Mr. Blackwood..." Harrison's voice cracked. His hands trembled as they clutched an iPad.

Nathan's gut twisted. His knuckles turned white around his Montblanc pen.

"Speak."

Harrison swallowed hard. "Liber Airlines Flight 227... There's been... The plane Evelyn was on..."

The pen snapped in Nathan's grip.

"No survivors." Harrison whispered. "They found her name on the..."

The words "casualty list" never made it past his lips.

Nathan's world tilted. The floor seemed to drop away beneath his Italian leather shoes.

His vision tunneled. The only sound was the deafening rush of blood in his ears.

Evelyn couldn't be...

Not his vibrant, stubborn, brilliant Evelyn.

Not the woman who played Chopin with such passion. Who negotiated mergers with razor-sharp wit. Who smoked Cuban cigars on the balcony of their penthouse just to scandalize the neighbors.

The woman whose laughter still haunted his dreams three years after their divorce.

Nathan's knees buckled. He caught himself on the conference table, sending documents flying.

"You're mistaken." His voice was barely human. "Check again."

Harrison's tears fell freely now. "William Sterling collapsed when they notified him. They've hospitalized him at New York Presbyterian."

The iPad screen showed the official airline statement: "Mechanical failure during storm conditions... No distress signal... Impact with Pacifica Ocean..."

Nathan's chest caved in.

Memories assaulted him - Evelyn's smile over morning coffee. The way she bit her lip when concentrating. Her scent of vanilla and jasmine lingering on his sheets.

The last time he saw her, walking away without looking back.

His fist connected with the walnut table. Once. Twice. Splinters embedded in his skin.

"Find her." Nathan's command was guttural. "I don't care what it costs. Search every inch of that ocean."

Across Manhattan, news alerts blared on every screen.

#EvelynSinclair trending worldwide.

The Sterling brothers - Alexander, Donovan, and Lucas - posted identical four-word statements that broke the internet:

"Bring our sister home."

The Kingsley Tech building shook with Nathan's roar of anguish as reality set in.

Somewhere over the Pacifica, the love of his life was gone.

And he'd never gotten to say goodbye.
###Chapter 257 She Vanished Without a Trace

The Sterling family deployed over twenty private helicopters to scour the stretch of ocean where the tragedy occurred. They contracted elite international salvage teams to comb every inch of the surrounding waters.

Hope refused to die. Within hours, the search radius tripled as nearly a hundred aircraft darkened the skies above the Pacifica Ocean.

The unprecedented operation made global headlines. Naval vessels joined the effort as divers multiplied exponentially across international waters. Nathan Blackwood personally led search teams around the clock, driven by unbearable guilt.

He couldn't forget it was his invitation that brought her here. His thoughtlessness that put her in danger. His fault she'd been terrified in those final moments.

She wouldn't have boarded that doomed flight. Wouldn't have disappeared. Wouldn't have... He couldn't bring himself to complete the thought. What horrors flashed through Evelyn Sinclair's mind when the engines failed?

Had she thought of him? Cursed him? That fearless woman who faced everything with such courage - how terrified must she have been? He'd give anything to have been there beside her.

Yet after seventy-two relentless hours, not a single trace emerged.

The wreckage recovered from the ocean floor told a gruesome tale - twisted metal, shattered components, blackened fragments.

Nathan stood rigid in the helicopter doorway, the merciless sunlight reflecting off waves that concealed unimaginable horrors. Salt spray stung his unshaven face as turbulent currents swirled beneath deceptively calm surfaces.

Life seemed so fragile in that moment. His grip on the doorframe trembled violently until Harrison steadied him from behind.

Harrison's grief mirrored Nathan's. Unlike his employer's three-year neglect of Evelyn, the assistant had witnessed her entire transformation - the shattered woman reborn into a force of nature. His admiration for her strength made the loss unbearable.

Watching Nathan deteriorate during the endless search, Harrison recognized the soul-crushing despair consuming his boss.

"Sir, the board requires your presence for the quarterly approvals. Let me handle the search. I'll notify you immediately if—"

He couldn't voice the grim reality. No human survived four days in these waters. Between predators and currents, even recovering a body seemed impossible.

Nathan's sculpted features had become gaunt, his piercing eyes now hollow. Stubble shadowed his jaw, but determination still burned through the exhaustion.

"What if she's waiting for me?" His voice cracked like broken glass. "Have my grandfather address the board. Expand the search grid northward."

Harrison sighed, turning to monitor incoming satellite feeds.

Meanwhile, Lucas Sterling refused to abandon hope. With William Sterling hospitalized and Alexander managing corporate fallout, the youngest Sterling brother spearheaded rescue operations.

His attitude toward Nathan had shifted dramatically - from contempt to fury upon learning why Evelyn boarded that flight, to something resembling pity.

Alexander was right. Nathan bore no true blame. How could they hate a man who looked ready to follow Evelyn into the grave?

Online outrage faded as quickly as it ignited. The crash became yesterday's news, Evelyn reduced to trending hashtags before newer scandals eclipsed her memory.

The world moved on.

But in Nathan Blackwood's shattered reality, time stopped the moment Evelyn's plane disappeared from radar.
###Chapter 258 Aren't You a Panther?

Nearly a thousand nautical miles off the search grid, in the middle of the vast Pacifica Ocean, waves crashed violently against the shores of a desolate island.

The dense jungle canopy blocked out most sunlight. Beyond the thick vegetation, only endless waves and the biting salt spray remained. Evelyn Sinclair had been wandering this godforsaken place for seventy-two hours without finding a single source of fresh water or edible food.

Her throat burned with thirst. Three days without hydration had left her lips cracked and bleeding. Leo, her AI panther companion, had transformed from a luxurious accessory to a pitiful scrap of fur huddled in her coat pocket. At least she'd been quick-witted enough to survive.

Moments before the explosion, she'd yanked open the emergency hatch and deployed her parachute without hesitation. That split-second decision had saved her life, though it sent her drifting hundreds of miles off course.

Grief for the less fortunate passengers had quickly given way to grim survival calculations. Her phone was lost to the sea, all communication devices gone. Even Leo's sophisticated systems had been damaged during their rough landing.

With no satellite signals reaching this remote location, the AI panther couldn't establish external connections. Evelyn was completely cut off, left to pray her family would find her before dehydration won.

Humans can't survive more than a week without water. Evelyn knew she was approaching her limit as she collapsed onto a sun-warmed boulder. Despair crept in as dark thoughts swirled through her mind.

"Why hasn't anyone come?" she croaked, voice raw. "Do they think I'm dead already?" Her fingers clawed at the rock. "Damn you, Nathan Blackwood! That cursed invitation might as well have been my death warrant!"

In her delirium, she imagined that if Nathan appeared now like some dark knight, she might forgive every past transgression. The fantasy evaporated as quickly as it came.

Leo peeked from her pocket, his once-glossy black fur now matted with salt and sand. The sophisticated AI resembled a discarded plush toy more than cutting-edge technology. "Mama," he rasped, voice glitching slightly, "your vital signs indicate distress."

Evelyn's heart leapt. "You're functioning again? Can you send a distress signal? Contact Emily Whitaker?"

The panther shook his head mournfully. "No signals detected. We're in a complete dead zone."

Her hope shattered like glass. The rhythmic crash of waves against shore sounded like a countdown to her demise. Hot tears welled in her sunken eyes.

"To think I might starve to death," she laughed bitterly, "when I'm worth billions." Her voice cracked. "I even bought Panther Cay last month - two billion dollars for paradise, and I'll die without ever seeing it."

Leo's processors whirred as he analyzed her ramblings. "My infrared scanners are back online. I can identify edible flora and fauna. Would you like me to locate potential food sources?"

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "Fauna? You mean... animals?"

The panther nodded enthusiastically. "Affirmative. When watching survival shows with Lucas Sterling, humans frequently consumed-"

"Wait," Evelyn interrupted, "are you suggesting you'll hunt for me?"

Leo immediately retreated into her pocket, every synthetic fiber of his being radiating distress. "I'm merely an artificial panther cub," he whimpered, "not an actual predator."
###Chapter 259 She Hadn't Suffered Enough

With the last remnants of her fading strength, Evelyn Sinclair stumbled back into the dense jungle.

Thankfully, she'd had the foresight to change into sturdy hiking boots before boarding that cursed plane.

Without them, she would have been dead days ago.

The towering trees of this uncharted rainforest stretched impossibly high, their massive trunks wider than three men standing side by side.

Evelyn dragged her battered body forward, her scratched hands leaving smears of crimson against the rough bark.

The pain barely registered anymore.

When you're waiting to die, minor injuries become meaningless.

"Leo," she croaked, her voice raw from dehydration. "Any sign of fruit?"

The AI tiger shook its tiny head, the motion sending another wave of despair through her.

Her vision swam as she took another faltering step.

Then the ground disappeared beneath her.

Evelyn crashed face-first into the muddy earth, her body too weak to catch herself.

Leo scrambled from her pocket, circling her frantically before suddenly freezing.

With unnatural speed, the mechanical creature dove back into hiding.

"Mommy, people coming!"

Evelyn tried to lift her head, but her muscles refused to obey.

Heavy footsteps thudded around her, accompanied by guttural voices speaking an unfamiliar dialect.

She knew seventeen languages fluently - this wasn't one of them.

People existed on this godforsaken island? After days of searching?

But her fleeting hope curdled into dread as rough hands grabbed her limbs, hauling her up like a sack of meat.

The jostling journey felt like being dragged over broken glass.

An unbidden image flashed through her mind - a roasted pig carried to the butcher's block.

Seriously? After everything, now I'm tribal dinner?

Evelyn swore silently. If this was Nathan Blackwood's idea of a rescue, she'd make him regret it.

If it was the Sterlings... well, Alexander would hear about their appalling hospitality.

And if these were just random islanders?

She'd survive this too.

The world faded to black long before they reached their destination.

A thousand nautical miles away, two helicopters converged over churning waves.

Harrison had pulled every string to get Lucas Sterling here.

They needed to combine resources if they stood any chance of finding Evelyn.

Nathan looked like death warmed over - eyes bloodshot, jaw clenched, his entire being radiating barely-contained panic.

Lucas dropped into the seat opposite, cracking open a vodka bottle with his teeth.

He spat the cap overboard, his own red-rimmed eyes locking onto Nathan's.

"Cut the martyr act. Who exactly are you trying to fool?"

Nathan didn't flinch, his gaze fixed on the horizon where Evelyn had disappeared.

The silence stretched, thick with unspoken accusations.

To the Sterlings, Nathan would always be the bastard who broke their sister's heart.

The monster who'd practically handed her a death sentence.

Lucas's voice turned glacial. "My father says you've done enough. This isn't your debt to pay."

The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees.

Nathan finally met his eyes, his voice gravel-rough. "I'm not here for your family."

Every word landed like a physical blow.

"I'm here for Evelyn. For that one-in-a-million chance she's still alive."

No body meant hope.

And Nathan would cling to that hope until his last breath.

Lucas stiffened, the words hitting harder than he'd expected.

"Then why the hell did you treat her like garbage?" he exploded. "We worshipped the ground she walked on, and you threw her away like yesterday's trash!"

Nathan's face drained of color.

The truth always hurt most when it came from someone else's lips.
###Chapter 260 You Don't Know Her

Nathan's lips parted slightly, but no words came out. Lucas threw his head back and took another deep swig of whiskey. His words were careless, fueled by alcohol and grief.

"Material possessions? The world at her feet?" Lucas scoffed. "When Evelyn was studying in Europe, our father hired eight nannies to take care of her. She fired every single one behind his back."

"Alexander flew thirty times a month just to cook for her. He sent her every research bonus he ever earned."

"And me?" Lucas let out a bitter laugh. "I only took film roles in locations near her. Even then, we thought that was the farthest she'd ever drift from us. But then—" His voice cracked. "She married you."

"For three years, she cut us off. No calls. No visits. Nothing. Nathan Blackwood, she chose you over her own family. And what did you do?" Lucas's voice trembled as tears streamed down his face.

He wiped them away roughly and drained the bottle. Harrison and the pilot sat frozen in the front, not daring to move.

The silence was suffocating. Nathan couldn't hear his own heartbeat, but he felt it—shattered, crushed, ground into dust.

Lucas stared at Nathan's ashen face. The alcohol made his chest burn with reckless fury.

Everyone said it wasn't Nathan's fault. That he didn't cause the accident. That he couldn't have controlled fate.

But Lucas couldn't stop thinking—if not for Nathan, Evelyn would never have been on that plane. She'd still be here. Still alive. Still spending his money on yachts and mansions and whatever else she wanted.

Lucas stood abruptly. The wind whipped at his clothes, tangling his hair.

With a careless flick of his wrist, he hurled the empty bottle into the sea.

"Nathan Blackwood, just go home. Whether it's guilt or something else—it's too late now. Go back to your life."

Nathan's voice was raw. "I'm not leaving. If she's still alive—"

Lucas laughed coldly, tears still falling. "You don't know her at all, Nathan. Evelyn couldn't swim."

His words were final.

"There is no if."

The endless ocean had already swallowed her whole.

The silence turned icy. Lucas's last words were the final blow. Nathan's face drained of color.

His fists clenched so tight his arms shook, veins bulging.

A person who couldn't swim—falling into the sea. Was the outcome really a surprise?

No.

He didn't know her. He knew nothing about her. Not even this.

What a joke.

The helicopter's roar suddenly deafened him.

No. Maybe Lucas is lying.

Nathan lurched forward, desperate to ask—

Then his body swayed. His grip on the cabin door slipped.

For one terrifying second, he hung halfway out, staring into the dark abyss below.

And there—he saw her.

Evelyn, smiling at him.

Yes. This is how it should be.

I should have been on that plane with her.

"President—!"

The wind slashed at his face. Salt spray stung his skin.

Lucas grabbed Nathan's arm and yanked him back hard, slamming the door shut.

The sea vanished behind metal.

"Damn it, Nathan! What the hell was that?" Lucas snarled. "You think my sister comes back if you die? She's gone! Who are you trying to fool?"
###Chapter 261 Savage Feast

To everyone watching, Nathan's actions appeared like a deliberate surrender to despair. Harrison rushed forward to intervene, terrified his boss might attempt something reckless again.

"Mr. Blackwood, are you alright?" Harrison's voice trembled with concern.

Nathan lay motionless, his eyes shut tight against the world. His ashen face resembled a death mask as Harrison pressed shaking fingers to his carotid artery. The steady pulse brought visible relief.

"Thank you, Mr. Sterling." Harrison nodded gratefully at Lucas. "The CEO hasn't slept in days. The exhaustion must have..."

Lucas studied Nathan with conflicted eyes. "Get him home." His clipped command left no room for argument. "Leave your team here to assist me."

Harrison nearly sagged with relief. Had Lucas refused the backup, Nathan would have flayed him alive upon waking.

As Lucas summoned his ride, Harrison hesitated before speaking again. "Mr. Sterling...I realize you said those things earlier to make Mr. Blackwood stand down."

Lucas turned away. Whether Harrison understood his motives mattered little.

The actor wasn't some saint, but neither could he watch Nathan destroy himself.

"After the divorce," Harrison continued carefully, "Mr. Blackwood became consumed with regret. The pain never leaves him. Certain misunderstandings...things he never intended...they hurt Ms. Sinclair deeply."

Harrison swallowed hard, realizing he'd overstepped. "But Mr. Sterling, every emotion he feels is genuine. His remorse. His love for her."

What would Evelyn think hearing these words? Lucas stood frozen for several heartbeats before striding toward the waiting helicopter without reply.

As the aircraft carried him toward a passenger ship below, Lucas gazed at the churning clouds. In another life - without the betrayals and heartbreak - Nathan and Evelyn would have been perfection together. A match written in the stars.

The thought carved fresh wounds in Lucas' chest. Nathan's feelings meant nothing now. Evelyn would never return.

Bracing against the ship's railing, Lucas let the frigid sea winds scour his face. His once-radiant features appeared gaunt, the light in his eyes extinguished by grief.

A thousand nautical miles away, Evelyn Sinclair stirred to consciousness. Damp earth pressed against her cheek as she blinked at a ceiling of woven branches. Her limbs refused to obey - bound by coarse vines.

A shadow moved beside her. Evelyn turned to find a tribesman crouching inches away, his dark skin streaked with ochre markings. A strangled scream tore from her throat.

The man grinned, revealing teeth filed to points. Animal bones clattered around his neck as he leaned closer. His loincloth of dried leaves rustled with each movement.

Evelyn scrambled backward until her spine hit the hut wall. Her frantic gaze took in dozens of similarly dressed warriors nearby - their fierce profiles straight from some anthropological nightmare.

'Where the hell am I?' The memory of being carried like game through the jungle sent ice through her veins.

Outside, tribesmen stacked kindling with ritual precision. Their leader - a mountain of muscle adorned with feathers - watched as others rubbed sticks against dry logs. Soon, smoke curled upward, igniting the waiting tinder.

The flames leaped hungrily as Evelyn's stomach dropped. 'Fire by friction? Am I in the Stone Age?'

Disbelief warred with terror as the tribesmen turned toward her hut in unison. Their hungry eyes glinted in the firelight.

'God must be playing the cruelest joke imaginable.'
###Chapter 262 The Shocking Discovery

Evelyn Sinclair wanted nothing more than to escape this nightmare. Just as despair threatened to consume her, one of the towering tribesmen pointed directly at her.

His next gesture was unmistakable—he motioned toward the roaring fire, then to his mouth.

They intended to eat her.

Her blood ran cold. Trembling, she forced a strained smile at the man watching her.

"Sorry to disappoint," she muttered before scrambling to her feet.

She barely took two steps before tripping over scattered branches. The fever still clouded her mind, and the fall left her dazed.

Another tribesman approached the one wearing shoes, speaking rapidly in their guttural language.

Wait—shoes?

Mud-caked, but unmistakably modern.

La Sportiva.

A high-end Italian brand.

Her pulse spiked. With sudden strength, she lunged for his shoes.

The man didn’t budge.

Through the grime, she spotted the faint logo.

Her gaze snapped up.

His face was painted, but his eyes gleamed with amusement as he smirked at her.

Recognition struck like lightning.

"You're not—"

A rough hand yanked her backward, dragging her toward the flames.

"No! You can’t do this!" she shrieked, thrashing wildly.

The circle of tribesmen tightened, their torches casting eerie shadows.

They chanted, dancing around her as the heat intensified.

Every attempt to escape was met with flames thrust in her face.

Smoke filled her lungs.

The world blurred.

Then—laughter.

A distinctly modern, mocking chuckle.

Her head whipped toward the sound.

Those same bright eyes met hers.

Before she could react, strong hands lifted her—

And dropped her unceremoniously onto the hard ground.

Torches circled her.

The chanting grew louder.

She was trapped.

"Someone! HELP!"

The flames crept closer.
###Chapter 263 Savage Salvation

Evelyn Sinclair choked violently, her hands flying to cover her nose and mouth.

The acrid smoke burned her throat.

Leo, who had been playing dead in her pocket, suddenly twitched. Mama, my database indicates this is an ancient sacrificial ceremony.

Evelyn's blood turned to ice. Am I about to become some primitive tribe's offering?! "Leo, you're supposed to be a tiger," she whispered desperately. "Can't you just leap out and maul them?"

The AI companion remained silent for three excruciating seconds before responding in that infuriatingly cheerful tone.

Emily Whitaker originally programmed me with 20% aggression capacity. But after Donovan Sterling's modifications...

Zero.

Mama, you'll have to bite them yourself.

Evelyn nearly screamed. I just got roasted by a glorified stuffed animal! She was about to demand escape routes when the chanting tribespeople abruptly fell silent.

Their painted faces turned solemn. Evelyn clamped her mouth shut, suddenly hyperaware of Leo's weight in her pocket.

Losing him would mean losing her only ally in this nightmare.

Then came the eerie part - every tribesperson simultaneously tilted their heads back, staring at the stormy sky with unsettling intensity.

The silence was absolute except for the crackling bonfire.

The sound crawled up Evelyn's spine like icy fingers.

A staff-bearing elder stepped back, breaking the human circle.

An ancient woman with facial tattoos entered carrying a broad leaf piled with food.

Their eyes met. The crone placed the offering at Evelyn's feet, speaking in guttural tones before miming eating motions.

When the vines binding Evelyn's wrists fell away, the tribe reformed their circle, watching her with predator's eyes.

On the leaf lay jerky, dried fish, and strange fruits. Evelyn's stomach growled treacherously.

She devoured everything like a starved animal, table manners be damned.

If they're poisoning me, at least I'll die full.

The meat was gamey but flavorful - the best meal she'd ever tasted. The tribespeople nodded approvingly at her ravenous display.

Then came the horror.

Torches hit the ground simultaneously.

Flames erupted in a perfect ring around her.

Evelyn realized with dawning terror - The food wasn't hospitality. It was fattening the sacrifice.

Fish-oil soaked branches burned unnaturally high, the circle tightening like a noose.

Smoke clawed at her lungs as the tribespeople resumed chanting, their ecstatic dancing casting monstrous shadows.

Evelyn's survival instincts screamed RUN - but where? The smoke blinded her. The chants deafened her.

When the flames licked three feet away, nature intervened.

Lightning split the sky.

Thunder shook the earth.

The tribespeople froze mid-ritual, their furious gazes snapping to Evelyn as if she'd summoned the storm.

Then the heavens opened.

Torrential rain doused the flames as tribesmen scattered.

Evelyn didn't wait - she turned to flee through the dissipating smoke when a calloused hand seized her wrist.

The "native" wearing sneakers dragged her into the jungle. Resistance was futile.

As they broke through the tree line, Evelyn glimpsed his modern wristwatch beneath the tribal paint.

This was no rescue.
###Chapter 264
A Desperate Escape

Evelyn Sinclair's breath hitched when she spotted the disguised tribesman.

The relentless rain transformed the night into an icy void.

Drenched leaves trembled violently around them, their rustling drowned by the roaring waves and the wind's ghostly wails. The atmosphere was surreal, thick with despair.

Shivers wracked Evelyn's soaked body, the cold seeping deep into her bones.

She paused just long enough to gulp air when heavy footsteps pounded behind them—close, terrifyingly close.

Evelyn locked eyes with the impostor. Without a word, they sprinted forward.

Rain lashed her face like shards of glass.

Her lungs burned. Her legs screamed in protest. The darkness swallowed everything except the drumming rain.

Branches and leaves crunched beneath their frantic steps. Escape was all that mattered—even if they had to crawl.

The tribesmen hurled branches like spears. One struck Evelyn's back. Pain flared, but she clenched her teeth and pushed harder.

Thorns tore at her palms, leaving bloody trails. She barely felt them.

Ahead, the impostor moved with panther-like grace, his athletic form cutting through the jungle effortlessly.

Evelyn forced her trembling legs to keep pace.

The hunters were gaining. If they caught up—

Her foot snagged on a root.

She crashed face-first into the mud, a cry tearing from her throat as pain shot up her arm.

The impostor whirled around.

"I'm fine!" she gasped, scrambling up. "Go!"

Then—

The ground vanished beneath her.

Her stomach lurched as she plummeted.

Fingers scrabbling, she caught a vine. Thorns bit into her flesh, but she held on, dangling over nothingness.

Her arms shook violently. She was at her limit.

The tribesmen's chants slithered through the trees—a death sentence.

Hopelessness coiled around her throat.

Then—

A hand clamped around her wrist.

The impostor hauled her up, his grip iron-strong.

Evelyn barely registered the pit below—lined with jagged spikes. One misstep, and she'd have been impaled.

"Run," he ordered.

She wiped her face—rain or tears, she couldn't tell—and stumbled after him.

No stopping. No looking back.

The jungle spat them onto a maze of paths. The impostor wove through them, doubling back until the hunters' cries faded.

When he finally stopped, Evelyn collapsed.

Silence. Then—

Sobs ripped from her chest, raw and violent, swallowed by the storm.

The impostor crouched before her. Moonlight revealed his true face—high cheekbones, striking eyes, features too refined for this hellscape.

"Don't cry," he murmured.

Evelyn sucked in a breath. They weren't safe yet.

She swiped at her cheeks. "Let's go."

Questions burned her tongue—how he'd gotten here, why he was helping her—but survival came first.

He nodded. "You'll be safe soon."

The promise hung between them as they vanished into the night.
###Chapter 265 He Had Never Left

A rich chuckle echoed through the moonlit jungle. The sound was warm and inviting against the eerie silence of the wilderness.

Adrian's eyes sparkled with mischief. "That's my little secret," he teased, making Evelyn roll her eyes. Still, his playful demeanor eased the tension coiling in her chest.

Following close behind him, Evelyn felt an unexpected connection to this stranger. His presence was oddly comforting in this terrifying place.

She reached out without thinking, her fingers brushing against his tattooed forearm. The skin was sun-kissed and firm beneath her touch.

"Are you cold?" she asked, already shrugging off her jacket. "You can have this."

His hand caught hers mid-motion. "I'm fine," Adrian said with a small smile. Evelyn nodded, suddenly remembering Leo curled up in her pocket.

"I'm Evelyn Sinclair," she offered. The name made Adrian stiffen slightly. He turned with sudden interest.

"Alexander Sterling's sister?"

Evelyn's eyes widened. "You know my brother? You know who I am?"

Adrian gave a slow nod. "Weren't you all over social media recently? That whole AI tiger scandal?"

"You just got here?" Evelyn gasped. The viral news was barely two weeks old.

Adrian resumed clearing their path, his voice light. "About a month before you arrived."

Evelyn marveled at how seamlessly he'd adapted to the indigenous tribe. If not for his modern boots, she'd have mistaken him for a native. The realization sent a pang through her chest.

If someone as capable as Adrian hadn't escaped in all this time... how would she ever get home?

"What's your name?" she pressed.

"Adrian Blackwood." He sighed dramatically and quickened his pace.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Blackwood? Any relation to Nathan Blackwood?"

Two beats of silence. Then a dry laugh. "Please. You think a billionaire like him would be caught dead here? I'm just an adventurer."

Evelyn nodded. Of course no wealthy socialite would willingly come to this death trap. Yet the name sent her thoughts spiraling to a certain dark-eyed man.

A thousand miles away, on a luxury yacht...

Helicopters buzzed overhead like mechanical dragonflies. Drones skimmed the ocean's surface, scanning for wreckage.

Even military-grade sonar had turned up nothing.

Lucas Sterling's phone buzzed. "Nathan Blackwood's back at the estate," Dominic Kingsley reported.

In the Blackwood mansion...

The family physician emerged from Nathan's room. Old Mr. Blackwood rushed forward. "How is he?"

The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Severe exhaustion from days without sleep. His body has completely shut down. Rest and proper nutrition are critical."

Margaret Blackwood sniffed from the corner. "That cursed Evelyn Sinclair only brought misery to my son! At least the jungle did what we couldn't."

Old Mr. Blackwood whirled on her. "Enough! If the Sterlings hear you talking like that—"

"But we're in our own home!" Margaret protested weakly.

The patriarch's glare silenced her. "Do you want Alexander Sterling targeting our business right after his sister's disappearance?"

Margaret paled, disappointment twisting her features.

"Sir!" A maid rushed in. "Mr. Nathan is awake!"

The family surged toward the bedroom, hope lighting their faces.
###Chapter 266 The Weight of Denial

Nathan Blackwood's eyes flew open, taking in the familiar opulence of Highland Estates. His body jerked upright, fingers already clawing at the IV line embedded in his arm.

"Where do you think you're going?" Sophia Blackwood's voice cracked like a whip across the sterile room. The family butler and two attendants immediately blocked Nathan's path.

A suffocating silence descended. Nathan's jaw tightened. "I'm finding Evelyn."

The words hit him before they left his grandmother's lips. "She's gone, Nathan." Sophia's voice held the finality of a judge's gavel. Everyone knew the truth. Everyone except him.

The words detonated in his chest, shattering the fragile dam of his denial.

Nathan froze like prey caught in floodlights. Something vital inside him snapped. When he lifted his gaze, his bloodshot eyes burned with manic intensity. "No. Not Evelyn. She wouldn't—she couldn't—" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I left her in that ocean. I'm bringing her home."

He surged forward, only for the butler to signal the attendants. They pinned him back against the mattress with practiced efficiency. "Master Blackwood, you're in no condition—"

"Move!" Nathan's command carried the bite of an Arctic storm.

Sophia's lips thinned. "After everything we've sacrificed to keep you alive—"

###Chapter 267 Survivor's Guise

Twenty-three minutes into their trek, Evelyn Sinclair's legs had turned to lead. Blisters wept beneath her ruined shoes. The monsoon chose that moment to cease, as if nature itself was mocking her suffering.

Beyond the tree line, the Pacifica Ocean roared. Salt-laced wind whipped at her face as waves pummeled the shoreline with primal fury.

The wet sand sucked at her feet like quicksand. Ahead, Adrian Blackwood moved with the effortless grace of someone who'd spent years conquering hostile terrain.

At the leeward side of a basalt outcrop, Adrian braced against a boulder twice his mass and shoved. Stone grated against stone, revealing a crevice.

"You coming?" He vanished into the darkness.

Evelyn gaped at the hidden cavern—barely large enough for two. Seawater trickled through fissures but couldn't penetrate the inner chamber. Adrian squeezed through a narrow passage, his voice echoing back. "Mind your head."

The chamber beyond stole Evelyn's breath. Battery-powered lanterns cast golden light over neatly stacked firewood. The air smelled of pine resin and dry earth—a paradise compared to the jungle's rot.

Her gaze snagged on Adrian retrieving a La Sportiva backpack from a ledge. Matching his boots. Efficient. He shrugged into a Scarpa windbreaker, then froze mid-motion.

Evelyn realized she'd been staring. Not with attraction, but the hypervigilance of someone who'd lost too much already.

Adrian's lips quirked. "See something you like, Sinclair?"

Heat flooded her cheeks as she spun away. "Aren't you thirsty? There's a leaf pouch by your knee. Collect seawater."

"Distillation. Smart." She seized the excuse to escape.

The makeshift container was laughably primitive. Evelyn selected the clearest runoff from a tidal pool. When she returned, Adrian had transformed.

Gone was the wild-haired castaway. Before her sat a man with military-short hair and razor-sharp cheekbones. His storm-gray eyes reflected the lantern light like polished hematite.

But it was the synthetic black hair piled beside him that made Evelyn blink. "You were wearing a wig?"

Adrian shrugged. "When in Rome."

"Who packs a disguise for a deserted island?"

The grin he flashed was all reckless charm. "Anthropology vlogger. I document uncontacted tribes." He produced a micro-camera no larger than a thumbnail. "This little guy's been recording everything."

Hope flared in Evelyn's chest. "You have a way off this rock?"

Adrian's smile faltered. "Not exactly."

"What about your extraction plan?"

"Helicopter drop-off. My pilot friend's currently freezing his ass off in Antarctica." He rubbed his neck. "Assuming he's still alive."
###Chapter 268 The Expedition South

The South Pole?! Evelyn's breath hitched as her stomach dropped violently.

Her mind raced with terrifying possibilities. Even if Adrian's explorer friend survived the harsh conditions, the chances of him coming to their rescue were practically nonexistent.

It was nothing but a foolish fantasy. So in the end... there was still no hope? Evelyn's face drained of color.

Adrian remained unfazed as he rummaged through his bag, producing a lighter to boil seawater.

"Can you contact the outside world?" Evelyn asked desperately. The look he gave her shattered any remaining hope.

"No." He stirred the pot calmly. "Haven't you considered how to escape this island?"

"I did." His lips quirked. "I assumed some fool would show up eventually. When rescuers come for them, I can hitch a ride. Besides..." He glanced at his notes. "My research here is nearly complete."

Evelyn's mouth fell open. Did he just call me a fool? The realization extinguished her brief moment of relief. What a nightmare!

With practiced movements, Adrian distilled the seawater repeatedly until it was drinkable. After tasting it himself, he passed the container to Evelyn. "Drink. You haven't had water in days."

Her throat burned at the memory. The last thing she'd consumed was that cursed rose cocktail from the flight attendant.

She gulped the water greedily, then flushed when she realized she'd taken most of it. "Is there more...?"

"Next time." Adrian shrugged. "You didn't bring much seawater back." His eyes twinkled as he noticed her guilty glance at his nearly empty cup. "Had enough?"

"For explorers like us," he said with an amused smile, "we can survive without fresh water or tools. In extreme situations, even urine can sustain life." His gaze swept over Evelyn's delicate frame. "Though I suspect you'd rather die than resort to that."

Evelyn shuddered at the thought. "Have you been posing as one of the natives this whole time?" She couldn't understand why they wanted to roast her but left Adrian unharmed.

Adrian nodded, reading her thoughts. "If you don't want to be their enemy, you must become one of them." He tapped his temple. "They're not intelligent enough to tell the difference."

If only I'd met him sooner. The memory of being tied to that spit sent chills down her spine. Without that timely rainstorm... She shook her head violently to dispel the horrifying image.

"But why did they want to roast me?" she whispered.

"Likely a sacrificial ritual." Adrian's voice took on a scholarly tone. "I read an anthropological study about primitive tribes offering unfamiliar objects to the gods. Fire purifies the offering. If you accept their food during the ceremony, it signifies you'll bless them with abundance."

His explanation matched what Leo had told her. Evelyn forced herself to change the subject, unwilling to dwell on the traumatic experience.

Her mood lifted slightly. This was the first peaceful moment she'd had since the crash. Then a troubling thought surfaced. "Is this island on any maps?"

Logically, her family would have mobilized every resource to find her. If they couldn't locate the crash site, they'd expand the search radius. Yet days had passed with no sign of rescue.

Had the world forgotten her? Did this island even exist?

Adrian's expression darkened. "It is on maps, but..." He hesitated. "This area is designated an international no-go zone."

He explained how pirates infested the surrounding waters for hundreds of nautical miles. Any ship passing through risked international incidents and heavy losses. The pirates even used special technology to obscure the island from satellite imaging.

Evelyn felt like an anvil had crushed her chest. Just when she thought things couldn't get worse...

"So we're trapped here?" Her voice cracked. No rescue teams would search this area, and expecting pirates to save them was laughable. They might as well have stayed with the sacrificial tribe.

Sensing her despair, Adrian offered a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. You're not alone anymore."
###Chapter 269 I Need Funds

Evelyn's eyes burned with unshed tears.

They must believe I'm gone.

Father and my brothers... they're probably devastated.

Adrian paused mid-motion, studying her face.

Her expression of hopelessness twisted something in his chest.

"We should hold onto some optimism—"

"What optimism?" Evelyn lifted her gaze, her eyes shimmering like the ocean under moonlight.

Adrian hesitated before speaking. "History records numerous cases of people surviving open-water swims."

"Would you stop talking nonsense?!"

"Fine..." Evelyn collapsed onto a bed of leaves and drifted into exhausted slumber.

When Leo sensed the danger had passed, he wriggled from Evelyn's pocket to investigate their surroundings.

Adrian snatched the tiny creature with lightning reflexes. "Eve carries a pet around?"

Leo's paws flailed indignantly. "Release me! I'm no pet—I'm a tiger!"

Adrian's eyes gleamed with amusement. "A talking mechanical tiger!"

Leo's whiskers quivered with outrage. This insult to his feline dignity was unbearable! "I'm one hundred percent genuine tiger!"

Chuckling, Adrian swung Leo by his tail like a pendulum, enjoying the creature's furious protests.

"Mama! Rescue me! I'm being murdered!"

Adrian clamped a hand over Leo's mouth, casting a guilty glance at the sleeping Evelyn before exhaling in relief.

"Quiet!" He released Leo, who landed with an offended huff.

The once-pristine AI companion was now covered in grime, his former adorable appearance barely recognizable.

Leo tilted his head, studying Adrian with sudden recognition. "I know you! Adrian Blackwood—the adventure documentarian!"

"Your series won five consecutive Golden Globe awards. You've got millions of followers worldwide!" Leo continued proudly. "Also, you're the great-nephew of Blackwood Enterprises' chairman. Old money aristocracy."

Adrian's initial surprise darkened at the last remark. "You're quite the little informant." When his family connections first leaked years ago, he'd paid dearly to bury the information.

"Naturally! My database accesses all publicly available information. If it exists online, I know it!"

Adrian lifted Leo to eye level. "You won't tell Eve about Nathan being my uncle, or..."

"Do indigenous tribes enjoy tiger meat, I wonder?"

Leo's eyes bulged. "You wouldn't dare threaten a noble beast!"

Adrian smirked. "Wouldn't I?"

Leo's bravado faltered.

"Mama despises the Blackwoods most of all! You're terrified she'll abandon you if rescuers arrive, aren't you?"

Adrian raised an eyebrow. This clever construct could read him disturbingly well.

For the first time in days, Evelyn slept deeply, free from nightmares of tribal cooking fires.

The crashing waves and howling wind eventually roused her.

Her first sight upon waking was Leo crouched beside her, his round eyes blinking owlishly. When she reached out, he leaped into her palm, nuzzling her affectionately.

Adrian returned with seawater.

"Mama, I adore you."

Evelyn stretched with a smile. "Love you too, sweetheart."

Adrian began distilling drinkable water—a necessity since Evelyn couldn't stomach seawater like he could.

Evelyn refused to remain idle. She scavenged reflective stones from the beach, arranging them into a massive SOS signal on nearby boulders.

Just in case any search aircraft passed overhead.

Leo grudgingly assisted, pushing pebbles with his tiny paws.

"Mr. Blackwood—"

"Call me Adrian." He sipped precious freshwater, flashing a charming grin. His natural charisma put Evelyn at ease.

"Alright... Adrian." She hesitated. "If we survive this, is there anything you'd like? I'll make it happen."

Adrian met her gaze solemnly. "I need funds."


###Chapter 270 Hold Off on the Donations

Evelyn had suspected Adrian might be strapped for cash.

Why else would he take such a dangerous job? She gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

"Don't stress about money. I've got plenty to spare."

"If we make it out of here, you'll never have to worry about finances again. Consider it handled."

Adrian's eyes welled up with emotion as he gazed at her, overwhelmed.

"Evelyn, I'm putting my future in your hands."

"Done deal," she agreed without hesitation. With her fortune, supporting a friend was nothing.

Back in Montecito...

Donovan finally emerged from his research lab and learned about Evelyn's disappearance.

Without wasting a second, he boarded a helicopter headed for the open sea.

Lucas hadn't returned yet—meaning the situation remained unresolved.

Celebrities and dignitaries close to the Sterling family knew better than to intrude during their grief.

But the self-important social climbers rushed to send condolence flowers to Evelyn's residence.

This sent William Sterling—whose health had just stabilized—into another medical crisis from sheer fury.

Alexander promptly issued a decree: any wreaths would be returned to the senders immediately.

The nosy crowd finally fell silent.

Online media outlets were strictly forbidden from mentioning Evelyn's disappearance.

It was clear—the Sterlings refused to accept her death. Their love for their daughter and sister ran too deep.

Two thousand nautical miles from shore, Donovan arrived at Lucas's search vessel after ten grueling hours in flight.

They'd recovered massive debris from the plane—but not a single survivor.

The passengers might already be fish food.

With each passing hour, Lucas's expression darkened further.

Donovan found him drowning his sorrows in alcohol while monitoring underwater camera feeds.

Lucas's bloodshot eyes revealed days without sleep.

Bennett hadn't dared intervene—so Donovan's arrival brought visible relief.

"Mr. Sterling!" Bennett greeted eagerly.

Donovan gave a curt nod and had his computer equipment brought aboard.

"Put the bottle down. Father's about to liquidate the entire family fortune—including your shares."

Lucas barely reacted, his face hollow with grief.

"Let him," he muttered.

Donovan shot him a sideways glance.

"Have you considered what Evelyn will do if she comes back to find herself bankrupt?"

Lucas's brow furrowed.

"Then he shouldn't— Wait, are you saying she could still be alive?!"

Donovan typed rapidly, his expression grave.

He studied the scrolling data and nodded decisively.

Lucas sprang up, nearly tripping in his haste.

"Seriously?! You're not joking?"

In the Sterling family, William held the most authority, but Donovan's intellect was legendary.

Lucas—whose main asset was his looks—found sudden hope in his brother's words.

Donovan kept his voice steady.

"The black box was seized by Liberty's government, but my hacker contact extracted the flight data."

Lucas's eyes widened.

"Won't that cause an international incident?"

"One minute before the explosion, the plane veered drastically off course," Donovan explained.

"The crash site is here—but..."

"But what?!" Lucas demanded.

Donovan's gaze turned piercing.

"In that final minute, an unknown signal tried correcting the deviation. It came from Leo."

"The signal's last location was a thousand nautical miles from the crash site."

"If Leo functioned properly, it would've guided Evelyn to safety with advance warning."
###Chapter 271 Searching for Your IQ Is Like Hunting for a Ghost

Lucas stood frozen, his entire body paralyzed with shock.

For days, he had avoided confronting this possibility, too terrified to face what might be true.

But when Donovan laid out his findings, Lucas suddenly collapsed to his knees.

His muscular frame shook violently with suppressed emotion.

Tears streamed down the actor's face as years of pent-up grief finally broke free.

Bennett, watching nearby, felt his own throat tighten with shared sorrow.

Donovan observed his brother's breakdown with quiet intensity.

Regret darkened his scientific mind. He'd emerged from his lab too late.

With his genius-level intellect, Donovan methodically reconstructed every possible scenario.

Leo's tracker had gone completely dark - not even satellite imaging could detect it.

This suggested advanced signal-blocking technology was in play.

Their search radius needed to shift two thousand nautical miles southeast.

Lucas immediately called off current operations and redirected all resources.

Donovan continued analyzing satellite data, his fingers flying across holographic displays.

The target zone showed dozens of uncharted islands - each a potential death trap.

His silence spoke volumes. Lucas called William with renewed hope, urging him to halt asset liquidation.

William berated him for worrying about money at such a time.

Donovan snorted at his brother's wounded expression.

"Searching for your IQ is like hunting for a ghost," he muttered.

Lucas opened his mouth to retort, then wisely closed it.

When it came to intellect, Donovan outclassed everyone present. A mercenary captain questioned their new coordinates, refusing to proceed.

"It's not about payment," the grizzled veteran explained. "That's pirate territory."

"No government patrols dare enter those waters."

"Their main stronghold sits among those islands. No one comes back from there alive."

Lucas's hope shattered like glass. He turned desperately to Donovan.

The scientist hesitated only briefly before calling Alexander on a secure line.

After a tense minute, Alexander simply said, "Understood. Stand by."

At Highland Estates, the situation had grown dire.

Nathan Blackwood had been confined to his suite for forty-eight hours.

Empty liquor bottles littered the opulent room like fallen soldiers.

The once-impeccable billionaire now sat slumped in a corner, clutching a half-empty bottle.

"Evelyn..." His broken whisper filled the space between gulps.

Tristan Whitmore and Gregory Thornton had tried everything to rouse him.

Where was the commanding CEO who ruled Wall Street? Love had reduced him to this shell.

When Alexander arrived, his lips curled in disgust. "Mr. Blackwood," he began coldly.

"What if I told you Evelyn might still be alive?"

He reminded Nathan of an early corporate crisis - when pirates had seized Kingsley Tech oil tankers.

While governments wrung their hands, Nathan had single-handedly retrieved the ships.

He'd become the only man to ever best those pirates and live.

Now Alexander laid out Donovan's theory without softening the dangers.

Money could be negotiated. But if they wanted Evelyn dead...

The moment Alexander left, Nathan sprang into action.

"Harrison!" he barked, suddenly sober. "Prep the jet immediately."

From his safe, he retrieved an antique pistol and burner phone.

Old Master Blackwood's guards proved no match for Nathan's manic determination.

The patriarch could only watch helplessly as his grandson departed.

For Evelyn Sinclair, Nathan Blackwood would storm the gates of hell itself.
###Chapter 272 The Ultimate Jinx

Evelyn chewed on the fish without expression. Without any seasoning, she couldn't taste anything but the blandness of the flesh.

The fish had washed ashore, and Adrian had picked it up, roasting it over a small fire made of dried leaves.

It was nothing but salt and fishiness—no flavor, no satisfaction.

She longed for the rich, buttery sauces of that little Parisian bistro she used to frequent, paired with a crisp glass of Chardonnay.

Adrian, however, ate with enthusiasm. When he heard her sigh, he glanced up, grinning.

"Evie, if you're not going to finish that, I'll take it." He reached for her fish.

She jerked back, glaring at him while shielding her meal. "Back off, or Leo will make you regret it." Beside her, Leo bared his teeth in warning.

Adrian chuckled. "If you're bored, we could visit the indigenous village. I'll show you around."

Evelyn immediately shook her head.

Was he insane? Just the thought of those people sent chills down her spine. Dressing like them? Absolutely not.

The sky stretched endlessly above them, a perfect, cloudless blue.

The sea breeze rolled in, fresh and invigorating. But Evelyn couldn't appreciate it.

When would this nightmare end?

Just as despair threatened to swallow her, the distant roar of an engine cut through the air.

Before Adrian could react, Evelyn sprinted to higher ground, waving frantically at the approaching speedboat. "Help!"

The boat drew closer, the engine's growl growing louder.

But before relief could settle in, Adrian grabbed her arm, his voice sharp. "Run. Now. Those are pirates."

Fear locked her throat.

She scooped up Leo and bolted. Adrian nearly laughed at how quickly she moved.

"Into the jungle!" he ordered.

Evelyn hesitated, but her feet didn't. "But—the indigenous people—"

"They're the lesser evil."

True.

They ran without looking back, their breaths ragged, their hearts pounding.

The wind whipped against their faces, sharp and biting. They didn’t dare stop, not even when their lungs burned.

This was worse than that stormy night.

Behind them, rough laughter and heavy footsteps echoed, punctuated by gunshots—warning shots.

A savage game of predator and prey.

Fear coiled tight in Evelyn’s chest, every nerve alight with terror.

Then—her foot caught.

She crashed to the ground, her knee slamming against the earth with a sickening thud.

Pain exploded through her leg.

Adrian turned, his expression darkening when he saw her biting her lip, trying to stifle a cry. He moved to lift her, but she shoved him away.

"Save your strength," she gritted out, forcing herself up. "I can keep going."

Adrian studied her, then nodded. He grabbed her arm, pulling her forward as they ran.

Her knee screamed in protest, the pain blinding. But she couldn’t stop.

She ran on pure adrenaline, sweat beading on her forehead.

The gunfire grew louder.

Closer.

Her heart hammered violently, her body pushed to its limits.

But she wouldn’t give in.

The wind howled, carrying the occasional crack of gunfire.

They didn’t dare slow down.

The pirates must have seen the SOS signal.

Ahead, smoke curled into the sky—the indigenous village.

Adrian yanked her behind a massive tree trunk, where they’d stored branches earlier. The scent of fish oil clung to the wood.

Then—

Bang.
###Chapter 273 Hanging by a Thread

The gunshot sent the indigenous tribe into chaos.

They scrambled to their feet, gripping their wooden clubs with trembling hands. Their eyes darted around wildly, searching for the source of the danger.

Evelyn Sinclair and Adrian Blackwood exchanged a tense glance.

Adrian’s expression was grim, his body coiled tight with readiness. He pressed a finger to his lips, signaling silence.

Then came the sound—footsteps.

Dozens of them, crashing through the underbrush.

The tribesmen shouted in their guttural language, their voices sharp with warning.

The pirates’ furious curses cut through the air, followed by the unmistakable click of guns being reloaded.

Tension thickened like fog.

The pirates weren’t afraid—not with their weapons.

But the natives outnumbered them. Bullets were limited.

And worst of all—they had been tricked.

"Where the hell is that explorer?!" one pirate snarled. "We followed the signal here—nothing but these damn savages!"

"Waste of bullets," another spat. "But if we find him…"

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Her pulse hammered in her throat, so loud she feared they would hear it.

Then—gunfire.

The pirates fired wildly, bullets tearing through the jungle.

A tribesman cried out, clutching his leg as he fell.

The others scattered, their primitive weapons useless against the guns.

The pirates tore through the camp, kicking over tents, overturning baskets.

One of them grabbed a tribeswoman by the hair—

A war cry erupted from the trees.

The natives surged forward, their fear turning to fury.

The pirates cursed, stumbling back as spears and clubs swung at them.

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

"Don’t kill them!" a pirate shouted. "Too many—we’ll be overrun!"

The tide turned in seconds.

The tribesmen who had fled now returned, armed and enraged.

The pirates hesitated—then bolted.

Gunshots echoed as they fired behind them, wounding a few pursuers before vanishing into the jungle.

Evelyn sagged against a tree, her legs weak with relief.

Adrian’s shoulders relaxed slightly, but his gaze remained sharp.

"We take another route," he murmured. "Avoid them entirely."

Evelyn nodded.

They turned to leave—

A deep, mechanical roar split the sky.

Not one helicopter.

Several.

Leo, the AI tiger, poked his head from Evelyn’s pocket.

"Someone hacked my tracker," he said urgently. "They’re using satellite signals to find us."

His voice dropped.

"Mama… it’s either Emily Whitaker—or Donovan Sterling."
###Chapter 274 No, I'm Scared

Evelyn Sinclair's heart leaped with joy when she recognized the voices. Tears welled up in her eyes.

Her brother had come for her!

Just moments ago, she had been certain she would die on this cursed island. The weight of despair had pressed down on her like a mountain, suffocating her hope.

But now—

The rhythmic thrum of helicopter blades filled the air, a symphony of salvation. It was the most beautiful sound she had ever heard.

She ran faster than she ever had in her life.

Adrian Blackwood, panting beside her, found a clearer path ahead. He glanced back, his expression a mix of relief and lingering fear.

"Evelyn," he called, voice rough from exertion. "We're going home together. You won't leave me behind, right?"

She flashed him a radiant smile despite the dirt and exhaustion.

"Of course not! Once we're back, you're stuck with me. I'll make sure you never have to worry about anything again!"

She thought he was afraid she'd abandon him after their ordeal.

One more person to take care of? Easy.

In her excitement, she didn't see the gnarled root jutting from the ground.

Her foot caught.

She stumbled forward with a gasp, pain shooting up her leg.

Adrian yanked her upright. "Slow down," he warned. "What if it's a trap? We could be running straight into danger."

Evelyn shook her head, breathless but certain.

"No, it's not a trap. It's Alexander. My brother—he's a genius. If they tracked Leo, they know I'm here."

For twenty agonizing minutes, they sprinted through the jungle.

Evelyn fell more than once.

Her clothes were torn beyond recognition, caked in mud and sweat.

Her once-pristine hands were a mess of cuts and scrapes, blood smeared across her skin.

But she didn't care.

She didn't even cry.

Finally, they burst through the trees—

And froze.

The beach stretched before them, wide and open.

Three helicopters hovered ominously overhead, their deafening rotors churning the air.

Eight speedboats bobbed in the water nearby, each manned by armed, sunglasses-wearing men.

The sea roared, waves crashing violently against the rocks.

The entire scene was suffocatingly tense.

This wasn't a rescue.

Evelyn's stomach dropped when she spotted the three men in military gear standing closest to them.

Guns slung casually over their shoulders.

Cigarettes dangling from their lips.

A cold dread slithered down her spine.

The men turned.

Their eyes locked onto Evelyn and Adrian.

A slow, predatory grin spread across their faces.

Evelyn's blood turned to ice.

One of them barked a rough laugh.

Adrian's grip on her hand trembled.

"P-Pirates," he whispered.

Evelyn forced herself to stay calm, but her pulse hammered in her throat.

Her instincts screamed.

These were the same pirates who had chased them before.

Driven off by the island's natives, they had waited here—patient hunters—for their prey to stumble right into their hands.

And Evelyn and Adrian had done exactly that.

She stood paralyzed, mind blank.

Fear, sharp and icy, flooded her veins.

This was despair.

True, crushing despair.

Why? she wanted to scream. Why does fate keep testing me like this?

The pirates flicked away their cigarettes.

Exchanged knowing smirks.

Then started toward them, unhurried.

Confident.

They had all the time in the world.

Evelyn clenched her jaw, swallowing back terror.

"Run," Adrian urged under his breath.

She shook her head, voice barely audible.

"No. I'm scared."

Her gaze flicked to the guns at their hips.

"They have weapons."
###Chapter 275 Lambs to the Slaughter

The moment Evelyn Sinclair heard those words, any thought of turning back and fleeing vanished instantly.

Being shot in the back while running would be a pitiful way to die.

But if they couldn’t run, what other choice did they have?

The frigid air bit into their skin, thick with the acrid scent of cigarette smoke mingling with the briny stench of the ocean.

The three men stood directly in front of them, blocking any escape.

At this rate, they wouldn’t last much longer. Adrian Blackwood trembled uncontrollably.

Though he was an experienced explorer, he had never faced anything like this before.

Evelyn wasn’t faring much better, but as the pirates drew closer, an eerie calm settled over her.

Two of the men were tall and powerfully built, their muscles straining against their clothes.

The third was shorter and leaner, but his cold, hawk-like eyes were the most terrifying of all.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn with an intensity that made her skin crawl—hungry, predatory.

Even in her disheveled state, her striking beauty and aristocratic features were impossible to hide.

Noticing his leer, Evelyn glared back at him with defiance, her chin lifting slightly.

The shorter man smirked, stepping closer.

Adrian’s breath hitched beside her.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists, her pulse steady despite the danger.

She wouldn’t go down without a fight.

The man's lips curled into a mocking sneer.

His icy gaze gleamed with predatory intent. A low whistle escaped his lips as he raked his eyes over her with vulgar appreciation.

The cold metal of the gun pressed beneath her chin, forcing her head up.

He looked at her like a conqueror surveying his spoils.

His laughter, shared with his companions, dripped with cruelty and greed. "Look at this one—quite the prize."

"We hit the jackpot this time!" The men behind him roared with unrestrained arrogance.

Their stares slithered over Evelyn's skin like the tongues of vipers.

This was their domain, and she was nothing but prey. The pirates aboard the distant ship watched the scene unfold with twisted amusement.

Tension crackled in the air.

Escape was impossible—everyone knew it.

Evelyn's body tensed, but her mind sharpened.

The biting sea wind lashed at her face.

It stung, but it cleared her thoughts, honing her focus.

Her fists clenched so tightly her nails drew blood, but she barely noticed.

The acrid scent of gunpowder clung to the weapon pressed against her—a silent promise of death.

As the pirates exchanged smirks, Evelyn struck.

Her hand shot out, seizing the gun.

In one fluid motion, she twisted, yanking it forward with brutal force.

Her other hand pried at the man's fingers, wrenching them away. A choked grunt escaped him as he staggered back, shock flashing across his face.

This delicate-looking woman dared to fight back?

Evelyn didn't give him a chance to recover.

Before he could react, the gun was in her grip.

She flipped it, barrel now trained on the pirates.

A sharp kick sent the man crashing to his knees before her.

The others' laughter died instantly. Their expressions darkened with fury.

Two guns swung toward her, but Evelyn's aim never wavered—her weapon pressed against the pirate's temple.

The tables had turned.

The smug predators now stood frozen, tension coiling around them.

Evelyn's smile was glacial.

They weren't lambs to slaughter. And these pirates weren't invincible.

Nathan's eyes widened at the sudden shift. Without hesitation, he moved to her side, pinning the man down.

Evelyn gave him a brief, approving glance.

Across from them, the pirates erupted into curses.

"You stupid bitch!" one snarled. "You think this is a game? These guns aren't toys!"

Evelyn's grip tightened.

She struck the pirate's head with the gun's butt, silencing him.

"I want a helicopter."

"Like hell!" another spat. "You're dead the second you let him go!"

She hadn't expected them to agree.

But she had leverage now—and fear no longer clouded her mind.

A sharp shout rang out toward the ship.

Within moments, reinforcements swarmed the deck.

Dozens of muzzles locked onto Evelyn.

The air thickened with the promise of violence.
###Chapter 276 What's Her Price?

The standoff shifted in a heartbeat.

Storm clouds loomed over the Pacifica Ocean, its surface deceptively calm despite the brewing tempest.

A silent warning of the violence about to erupt.

The air between them crackled with tension, thick enough to choke on. One wrong move would ignite bloodshed.

These were hardened mercenaries who killed without hesitation.

Evelyn Sinclair was just a castaway. Yet her grip on the pistol remained steady, her aim unwavering.

She pressed the barrel harder against the pirate's temple beneath her boot, ensuring his compliance.

Her piercing gaze met the dozens of weapons trained on her without flinching.

Adrian Blackwood's face drained of color. His knees buckled, sending him collapsing onto the wet sand.

Evelyn shot him a sideways glance, whispering words the pirates couldn't catch. "Stay calm. Get behind me. When you hear gunfire, run for the jungle. Don't look back."

The explorer froze. He'd faced nature's wrath countless times - starvation, dehydration, hostile tribes.

Falling cliffs. Pirate attacks. Nothing had prepared him for this bone-deep terror.

Death's icy fingers traced his spine, turning his blood to sludge in his veins.

Yet this delicate-looking woman spoke of escape plans as casually as discussing tea.

Adrian clenched his jaw and forced himself upright, the panic in his eyes hardening to resolve.

"I made a promise to protect you." His voice barely shook. "I'm not leaving."

Before Evelyn could argue, the lead pirate barked a command.

"Enough talking! Fire!"

Her stomach dropped.

This hostage meant nothing to them. She saw it in their trigger fingers twitching with bloodlust.

Then - movement to her left. A jagged rock formation twenty yards away. Possible cover.

Her odds? Abysmal. Limited ammo against a small army.

"Wait!" She projected her voice over the cocking rifles. "Let's negotiate."

The scar-faced pirate sneered. "Negotiate? With what?"

"The treasure map in my bag." She lied smoothly. "Ancient Aztec gold. Enough to buy your freedom ten times over."

The pirate leader spat. "What makes you think you're worth bargaining with?"

The moment the pinned pirate twisted free, chaos erupted.

Evelyn sidestepped his wild swing and shoved Adrian toward the rocks.

"Kill them both!" The wiry pirate screeched.

Gunfire exploded like thunder.

Evelyn dove behind cover as bullets shredded the air where she'd stood. Hot lead pinged off stone, sending razor-sharp fragments flying.

Her pulse hammered in her throat, but her hands stayed steady. This wasn't over yet.
###Chapter 277 I'll Take Him Away

Bullets rained around Evelyn Sinclair like deadly hailstones.

In that moment of chaos, her mind flashed back to the terrorist attack in Montecito four years prior.

The picturesque European streets had turned into a warzone without warning.

Suicide bombers had detonated their payloads among crowds of unsuspecting tourists.

Evelyn had been sheltering in a café basement when she heard the child's screams.

A three-year-old girl stood wailing over her parents' lifeless bodies in the middle of the carnage.

Without thinking, Evelyn had sprinted from safety toward the child.

She'd almost reached her when the second explosion hit.

The blast wave lifted them both into the air like rag dolls.

Then suddenly - solid warmth.

A broad-shouldered man in military fatigues had shielded them with his own body.

That was how Evelyn first met Nathan Blackwood.

Blood dripped from his uniform, but his steel-gray eyes remained focused.

After ensuring their safety, he'd disappeared back into the smoke without a word.

That heroic act made Nathan a target.

Their second meeting came in a very different setting.

The underground fight club stank of sweat and blood.

Nathan was surrounded - a dozen fighters taking turns beating him senseless.

The crowd roared for more violence.

"Look at the mighty Montecito soldier now!" someone jeered from the shadows.

"Think you're some kind of savior? You're just a fool who meddles where he doesn't belong!"

Evelyn moved unseen through the bloodthirsty spectators.

She struck fast - kneeing one attacker in the groin, elbowing another in the throat.

Before anyone realized what happened, she had Nathan's arm over her shoulders.

Step by painful step, she dragged him toward the exit.

Light flooded in as the door opened, revealing Nathan's unconscious face streaked with blood.

She'd repaid her life debt that night.

Now, as bullets whizzed past her head, Evelyn wondered why this memory surfaced now.

Nathan would never know their paths had crossed twice before their ill-fated marriage.

She'd loved him long before he ever noticed her existence.

"Evelyn! Get down!" Adrian Blackwood's shout snapped her back to the present.

The pirate ship's deck was slick with seawater and blood.

Every breath brought the metallic tang of gunpowder.

Evelyn pressed against the ship's railing, her fingers numb around the pistol.

She made her decision.

If this was the end, she'd go out fighting.

Rolling from cover, she took aim and fired.

The shot struck true - a pirate screamed, clutching his shoulder.

Unlike these mercenaries, Evelyn aimed to wound, not kill.

Her precision only enraged them further.

Bullets pinged off the metal around her like deadly rain.

Adrian cursed colorfully, drawing some fire away from her position.

Evelyn gave him a grim smile and fired again.

Another pirate went down clutching his leg.

Now they were surrounded.

"No way out," Evelyn murmured.

Adrian flashed her a bloodstained grin. "Damn, Nikki. You shoot better than you look."

"Flattery won't save us now," she replied dryly.

Evelyn squeezed the trigger a third time.

Click.

The chamber was empty.
###Chapter 278 The Sound of His Arrival

Evelyn Sinclair squeezed her eyes shut. The tears refused to fall, though her chest ached with the need to weep.

She'd imagined this moment countless times before.

So many words she'd planned to say if death came knocking. Yet now, her mind was blank as the surrounding cliffs.

Sharp rock fragments bit into her palm, fresh blood mingling with old scars until her hand became a grotesque canvas of pain.

Footsteps crunched closer - the grim march of death itself.

If only she'd saved one last bullet.

For herself.

The cold steel muzzle glinted in her peripheral vision. She closed her eyes, surrendering to the inevitable.

Then - thunder.

A deafening roar split the air as dozens of military helicopters materialized overhead, their camouflage paint swallowing the sky.

The pirates froze. Their guns swung upward as one, recognizing the true threat wasn't the wounded woman before them.

Nathan Blackwood's forces descended with lethal precision. Soldiers rappelled down ropes, automatic rifles at the ready, encircling the outnumbered pirates within seconds.

The tide had turned.

Evelyn lacked the strength to lift her head, but she heard Adrian's shocked cry. "Nathan! Uncle Nathan! It's me!"

Her eyelids fluttered open.

Against the backdrop of churning waves, a figure emerged from the nearest helicopter. Towering in a black trench coat, his ice-cold gaze burned with barely restrained fury.

Nathan Blackwood descended like vengeance personified, gun in hand, the storm itself seeming to part for him.

All traces of his usual aristocratic composure had vanished. This was the ruthless man she'd first met on those dangerous European streets.

Her vision blurred. Consciousness slipped through her fingers like sand. As strong arms lifted her, she heard her name torn from his throat - raw, desperate.

How strange, she thought dimly. Nathan Blackwood... afraid?

Then darkness claimed her.

The battle erupted with hurricane force. Unlike Evelyn, Nathan's men showed no mercy. Each gunshot, each cry, fueled their bloodlust.

Inside the helicopter, Lucas gently took Evelyn from Nathan's arms. She weighed nothing - a broken bird in bloodstained clothes.

Nathan's attention snapped to a wiry pirate shouting obscenities. The captain. The one who'd hurt her.

"Vincent," Nathan's voice could have frozen hell. "You touched what's mine."

The pirate captain spat on the sand. "That bitch nearly blew my head off!"

Nathan's smile turned predatory. "Then she showed remarkable restraint." Pride laced his words. "My Evelyn always was extraordinary."

Vincent raised his gun. "I let you live once. Big mistake."

"Indeed." Nathan didn't flinch. "Your last."

The standoff crackled with tension. Though outgunned, the pirates held their ground. Finally, Vincent signaled his men to lower their weapons.

"Let's negotiate, Blackwood." He held up five fingers. "For her." A jerk of his chin toward Adrian. "Double for the boy."

Nathan didn't even glance at his nephew. "He's worthless."
###Chapter 279 The Woman Who Saved You

The massive helicopter blades whirred violently as Nathan Blackwood stood at the open door, his coat whipping in the harsh wind. His piercing gaze locked onto the pirate captain below.

"Fifteen billion dors," he declared, his voice cutting through the noise like ice. "Three times your asking price. It's already in your account."

Five billion per person - but he'd paid for three. This wasn't generosity. This was a statement.

The pirate captain's hawkish eyes gleamed with greed. This haul exceeded his wildest dreams. But his triumph was short-lived.

BANG!

The gunshot echoed across the deck. The captain staggered, his smirk frozen as crimson bloomed across his chest.

Nathan lowered the smoking pistol without flinching. His expression remained glacial. "That bullet's complimentary. No one touches Evelyn Sinclair and lives." His voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "Three lives for fifteen billion. A fair trade."

Tension crackled in the air as weapons clicked into ready positions. But the pirates stood no chance - Nathan's fleet of attack helicopters darkened the sky, their shadows swallowing the ship whole.

Defeated, the pirates could only watch as Nathan's aircraft disappeared over the horizon.

Two thousand nautical miles away, aboard a luxury cruiser...

Evelyn tossed fitfully in her medical bed, trapped in nightmares of gunfire and blood. In her dreams, she was still running - dodging bullets, gasping for air - until the ground vanished beneath her.

She jolted awake with a gasp, only to be pulled back under by the heavy veil of sedation.

Through the fog, she caught fragments of conversation outside her door:

"That woman of yours is something else, Blackwood!" The unfamiliar voice held awe. "Facing down armed pirates? Wounding two of them? If I hadn't heard it from Captain Moretti himself..."

A ghost of a smile touched Nathan's lips. "She's always been fearless." Not the type to beg - not when her car was sabotaged, not when Victoria Ashford sent thugs after her.

Pride warred with terror in his chest. That bravery nearly got her killed. If he'd arrived minutes later...

The military doctor rummaged through his bag. "You know... she reminds me of that girl. The one who saved you from those boxers in Europe years ago." He pulled out a faded photograph. "Look at this resemblance!"

Nathan's face drained of color. The world seemed to tilt on its axis.

Inside the cabin, Evelyn stirred at the sudden silence before slipping back into unconsciousness. Warm fingers laced through hers - rough yet comforting - as distant murmurs washed over her like waves.

On deck, the sunset painted the Pacifica Ocean in fiery hues. Donovan Sterling cradled Leo in his lap, sipping sparkling water as the ship cut through the waves. They'd been racing toward Montecito at full speed for ten days - just two more remained.

He didn't turn at the approaching footsteps. "She'll be fine, Nathan. The bullet missed everything vital."

Nathan's silhouette had grown gaunt, his usual commanding presence now edged with something darker. Something desperate.

Donovan studied him - really studied him - for the first time. The man who'd moved heaven and earth to rescue his sister. The man who might finally be worthy of her.
###Chapter 280 Do You Wish It Was Her?

Nathan Blackwood would never forget that moment on the helicopter. His arms were wrapped tightly around Evelyn Sinclair's unconscious, bloodied form, refusing to let go. Silent tears streaked down his face, leaving glistening trails.

The helicopter was packed with Nathan's military comrades. Their shocked expressions spoke volumes as they witnessed this unprecedented display of emotion from their usually stoic leader.

Thankfully, Maxwell Carter, their unit's medic, was aboard. He administered emergency treatment before performing surgery aboard the cruise ship. Throughout the entire procedure, Nathan never left Evelyn's side.

His unblinking gaze remained fixed on her pale face, as if fearing she might vanish if he looked away. When Maxwell extracted the bullet, Nathan's tension was palpable.

Beads of sweat dotted his forehead, his jaw clenched so tight it ached. No one could tell whether it was rage or anguish contorting his features. When the surgery concluded, Maxwell shot him an exasperated look.

"That was the most stressful operation I've ever performed! Every incision I made, you glared like you wanted to skin me alive."

"Maybe I should return the favor," Nathan growled, his bloodshot eyes burning with intensity. Maxwell stormed out in frustration.

Had they not been close friends, their relationship might have ended right then. Donovan Sterling observed everything from the corner.

Nathan's actions left Donovan no choice but to reconsider his stance toward the man who'd saved his sister. He'd been competing with Lucas Sterling over who would care for Evelyn.

Using his numerical advantage, Nathan consistently barred Lucas from the room, provoking colorful curses from the younger Sterling brother.

Only Donovan didn't interfere with Nathan's vigil. He understood the depth of Nathan's feelings for Evelyn surpassed anyone's comprehension. Now Nathan stood alone on the deck, his expression unreadable.

In his hands trembled a photograph captured by a European street photographer. His grip was so tight his knuckles bleached white. The shocking image had been displayed in a café opposite an underground fight club.

Nathan's memory only recalled a woman's retreating figure leading him toward blinding light. That sunlight piercing the darkness had resurrected him. The photograph showed her face.

The crimson dress made her glow with regal brilliance.

Yet the darkness behind her engulfed his battered form. In the frame, Nathan appeared broken and bloodied while she stood resolute, each step radiating determination.

When Nathan first saw the image, his eyes widened in disbelief before flooding red. The contrast of her courage against his vulnerability was staggering.

"Did I truly know her? Is this really Evelyn?" His voice emerged rough, layered with disbelief and something deeper.

Donovan studied him sidelong, a knowing smile playing on his lips. "Do you wish it was her, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan's mouth compressed into a thin line.

Countless questions tangled in his mind, forming an impenetrable knot. Why was she there? Why was she the one who carried me out? Why did she never speak of this?

The answers eluded him, but Nathan sensed their significance outweighed his very existence.
###Chapter 281 Calling Her Sis

Inside Evelyn's luxurious cabin.

The space was immaculate, designed with elegant comfort in mind. Sunlight streamed through the panoramic windows, casting golden patterns across the polished teak floors.

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open to Lucas's ecstatic shout. "She's awake! Evelyn's awake!" His voice nearly shattered her eardrums, yet warmth flooded her chest at the sound.

Outside, gentle waves lapped against the yacht's hull, their rhythmic tapping creating a soothing melody. The Pacifica Ocean stretched endlessly beneath a cloudless cerulean sky.

Evelyn attempted to move her bandaged hands, the thick gauze making them feel foreign and unwieldy.

Lucas perched on the edge of her bed, his usually vibrant eyes rimmed red. "Lil E," his voice cracked, "I've been searching these waters for days since your plane went down. Now that I've got you back..." He swallowed hard. "Name anything - it's yours."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. The scene felt surreal, like a beautiful dream, until the sharp scent of antiseptic grounded her in reality.

She was alive. Against all odds, she'd survived.

Taking in Lucas's disheveled appearance - his usually perfect hair in tangles, the shadows beneath his eyes - she managed a weak chuckle. "I'll hold you to that."

Evelyn had never hesitated to exploit her brothers' generosity. Lucas nodded vigorously, his relief palpable.

The cabin door burst open suddenly.

"Evelyn?" Nathan's deep voice carried cautious hope. Hearing him, Evelyn stiffened slightly before turning her head.

Nathan Blackwood stood in the doorway, his tailored suit wrinkled, his aristocratic features drawn with exhaustion. She remembered seeing him descend from a helicopter on that godforsaken island, though she'd assumed it was a hallucination.

Yet here he was in the flesh, having somehow extracted her from that bullet-riddled nightmare.

His stormy gray eyes brimmed with unspoken emotion. Evelyn lowered her gaze, offering a polite, distant smile. "Mr. Blackwood. I owe you my thanks."

Nathan flinched as if struck, his already pale complexion turning ashen. To her, he remained an outsider. "I... I'm just glad you're safe," he managed.

Despite the clear rejection, he moved forward with fluid grace, adjusting her pillows with practiced efficiency. "Are you in pain? Would you like something to eat?"

Evelyn's smile froze. "I'm fine, thank you." She turned back to Lucas. "Lucas, some water please?"

Lucas practically leapt to comply, shooting Nathan a triumphant look as he handed Evelyn a crystal glass.

Just as her fingers brushed the glass, Nathan intercepted, his touch feather-light on her wrist. "Wait."

From the bedside table, he produced a straw - clearly placed there in anticipation - and inserted it into the water. "This way you won't strain your stitches." His voice softened as he guided the glass to her lips. "Slowly now."

Lucas rolled his eyes dramatically. "Oh please, it's just a damn straw."

Evelyn found the gesture oddly intimate but drank gratefully. The cool mineral water tasted like ambrosia after days of barely potable filtered seawater.

Before she could set the glass down, Nathan had already taken it from her trembling grasp.

The sound of multiple footsteps interrupted them.

"Sis!" A chorus of male voices filled the cabin doorway. "We heard you were awake!" "How are you feeling, sis?" "You're insane - taking on pirates single-handedly!" "No one's ever escaped Vincent Moretti's crew before!"

"Give her space," someone admonished. "Let her rest."

Evelyn blinked at the group of rugged men crowding her doorway. Each bore the unmistakable bearing of special forces operatives - the same soldiers who'd descended from those helicopters on the island.

But why on earth were they calling her "sis"?
###Chapter 282 The Reason He Called You His Heartbeat

Evelyn Sinclair blinked in confusion at the doctor's words. Nathan Blackwood rubbed his nose awkwardly, rising from his chair while stealing hesitant glances at Evelyn's face.

The moment he turned toward the soldiers crowding the doorway, his expression darkened. "Enough chatter!" His commanding voice instantly silenced the room, though the men continued straining their necks to catch another glimpse of Evelyn.

She chuckled softly, addressing the group by the door. "Thank you all for risking your lives to save me." Her voice carried genuine warmth and gratitude.

Without their daring rescue, Evelyn knew she would have perished on that remote Pacifica Island long ago.

"No need for thanks, sis! We're all Montecitans here," one soldier called out. "And we're damn proud of what you did! Besides Commander Blackwood, you're the only person crazy enough to point a gun at pirate king Vincent Moretti's head!"

"Damn right! You and the Commander are perfect for each other!" another added.

The tall man in the white coat sighed dramatically as he pushed through the crowd. "Medical check-up in progress. Can you animals give us some space?" Dr. Maxwell Carter shot Nathan a pointed look. "Get them out of here."

Nathan hesitated, his dark eyes lingering on Evelyn before reluctantly leading the boisterous group away. "You too," the doctor said sharply to Lucas Sterling.

Lucas's triumphant grin vanished instantly. With exaggerated reluctance, he shuffled out, muttering about unfair treatment.

Every time Lucas came to visit his sister, Nathan's military friends found excuses to shoo him away - all part of their ongoing mission to give Nathan alone time with Evelyn.

The room finally settled into peaceful quiet.

Evelyn offered the doctor a grateful smile. "Thank you, Dr. Carter. I appreciate your patience with all this."

The doctor raised an eyebrow as he prepared his instruments. "You're not what I expected from the media portrayals."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, according to news reports, the Sterling heiress is spoiled, temperamental, and arrogant." He adjusted his stethoscope. "Nathan once mentioned you could be incredibly stubborn and unpredictable."

Evelyn's cheeks flushed at the blunt assessment. If Nathan had shared such personal observations, they must be close friends. She quickly changed the subject. "Doctor, how's Adrian - the young man who left the island with me?"

Dr. Carter paused his examination. "Recovering well. Eating and sleeping normally now that Nathan's finished beating some sense into him."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Nathan beat him? Why?"

"You didn't know? That reckless explorer is Nathan's nephew. The Blackwood family cut off his funding when he chose adventuring over business school, but the kid somehow scraped together resources and disappeared to that godforsaken island alone."

Dr. Carter shook his head. "The Blackwoods reported him missing three months ago. If not for rescuing you, he might still be lost out there."

Evelyn's breath caught as memories surfaced - her semi-conscious state on the boat, Adrian shouting "Uncle Nathan!" The realization struck her: the young man she'd met by chance was Nathan's flesh and blood.

What an extraordinary coincidence.

Another thought troubled her. "Those men earlier...are they active military? Were there...casualties during the pirate confrontation?" The possibility filled her with dread.

The doctor chuckled as he redressed her wounds. "No losses on our side, though the pirates didn't fare as well. You actually took out several yourself."

He gave her an appraising look. "Everyone out there served with Nathan in the same special forces unit. That stretch of ocean around Pacifica Island? Pirate territory. No government would authorize an official rescue mission."

Dr. Carter's voice lowered. "Nathan had to personally beg our former commanding officer for this operation. We came as private citizens to avoid international incidents."

Evelyn's chest tightened as if struck by a sledgehammer. The doctor's words made her realize the depth of what Nathan had risked for her.

"Thank you," she whispered. "If you hadn't come..."

The doctor shook his head, his expression turning solemn. "If you want to thank someone, thank him. We all know you're divorced, but every man here followed Nathan without hesitation." He met her gaze squarely. "Because he told us you're his heartbeat."

A heavy silence filled the room.

"We couldn't let our brother lose the reason his heart still beats."
###Chapter 283 We're Not Bankrupt, Are We?

Evelyn Sinclair felt her breath catch in her throat. A tremor ran through her body as her vision blurred with unshed tears.

She ducked her head quickly, letting her hair fall like a curtain to hide her expression.

Nathan Blackwood. The name alone made her chest constrict. If not for his intervention, she would have been lost forever in that unforgiving wilderness.

But how could she possibly repay such a debt? The doctor slipped out silently, leaving the room heavy with unspoken words.

Evelyn's lungs burned as if an invisible weight pressed against her ribcage.

The door creaked open to reveal Lucas Sterling sneaking in like a teenager avoiding curfew. He exhaled dramatically when he saw they were alone.

"Honestly, if they hadn't saved you, I would've thrown those idiots overboard days ago!" Lucas ran a hand through his tousled hair. "The tension on this ship could choke a whale."

Evelyn's lips twitched despite herself. "How's Dad? And Alexander? Donovan?"

Lucas perched on her bedside, fingers gently combing through her tangled locks. "Donovan's been glued to the navigation deck. Without his algorithms, we'd still be combing that godforsaken jungle."

A genuine laugh bubbled up in Evelyn's chest. "Leave it to my genius brother to calculate my rescue."

She'd never doubted for a second that Donovan would find her. The man could probably locate a needle in the Pacific if given enough data.

"Alexander's holding up. Dad's recovering at Mass General." Lucas's voice dropped. "He... wasn't doing well those first few days."

Evelyn's fingers clenched the sheets. "What happened?"

Lucas grimaced. "When we couldn't find any trace of you after the crash... Dad nearly liquidated the entire Sterling fortune to fund the search."

Evelyn's head snapped up. "Tell me we're not actually bankrupt." Her voice rose an octave. "I still have shopping to do!"

Lucas barked a laugh and squeezed her shoulder. "Relax, princess. I stopped him before he could sign anything. Your trust fund's safe."

Evelyn flopped back against the pillows with exaggerated relief. Then she noticed the clean linen gown replacing her torn clothes. Someone had bathed her, scrubbing away the jungle's grime.

With Lucas and Donovan handling everything, she could finally breathe.

"Why is Nathan here?" The question slipped out before she could stop it. Seeing him again after everything felt like reopening a barely healed wound.

Lucas's expression darkened. "Because the bastard's persistent as hell."

The door swung open to reveal Donovan Sterling, his sharp features pinched with disapproval. "Lucas, must you always jump to conclusions?"

Leo the AI tiger bounded past Donovan's legs, chirping happily as he nuzzled Evelyn's hand. She scratched behind his mechanical ears absently.

Donovan approached with the careful movements of someone handling fragile cargo. Evelyn reached for him with a tired smile. "I knew you'd come for me."

Her brother returned the embrace gingerly, shooting Lucas a warning look over her shoulder. "We needed Blackwood's resources. His private fleet had access to waters we couldn't penetrate."

Lucas crossed his arms. "He's just covering his own ass."

Donovan sighed. "Nathan mobilized his entire security division the moment the plane went down. He's invested just as much in finding Evelyn as we have." A pause. "Frankly, neither Father nor I expected him to go this far."

Evelyn's smile froze. A strange electric current seemed to race through her veins, making her fingertips tingle.

In another life, this news would have sent her heart soaring. Now it only filled her with a quiet dread. She couldn't afford to owe Nathan anything—not after their divorce.

Lucas made a disgusted noise. "If he hadn't sent that damn invitation, none of this would've happened! This is damage control, not heroism."

Donovan massaged his temples. "Be reasonable. The mechanical failure wasn't his fault. Yet he's still footing the entire rescue bill." He turned to Evelyn. "You don't have to engage with him if you're uncomfortable."

Lucas threw up his hands. "Now you're defending him? Have you forgotten what he put Evelyn through?"

Evelyn caught Lucas's hand before he could storm out. "You're both right." She squeezed his fingers. "Let's just... not talk about Nathan right now."

Lucas huffed but allowed her to pull him down beside her. "Fine. But only because you're the peacekeeping queen."
###Chapter 284 Take Care of Me

The golden sunlight danced across the ocean waves, while a gentle sea breeze carried the scent of salt and freedom.

Perfection. That's what this moment felt like.

Evelyn Sinclair sat between her two brothers, laughing at some private joke when an unexpected knock interrupted them.

Donovan Sterling, ever the dedicated scientist, excused himself immediately. "Physics equations won't solve themselves," he murmured, retreating to his room.

Lucas Sterling stayed put, his protective instincts flaring as he studied their visitor.

Adrian Blackwood stood framed in the doorway, his aristocratic features illuminated by the afternoon light. The cream-colored tracksuit beneath his slate gray coat accentuated his effortless elegance.

Every inch the modern gentleman.

"Eve, you're finally awake!" Adrian's voice wrapped around her like warm honey, his concern evident in those piercing blue eyes.

Lucas rolled his eyes dramatically. "Spare us the theatrics."

Evelyn couldn't help but smile. Seeing Adrian safe and healthy lifted an invisible weight from her shoulders.

Their bond had been forged in fire during those harrowing days on Pacifica Island. Near-death experiences had a way of creating unbreakable connections.

"Worried? Really?" She tilted her head, eyes twinkling with mischief. "You've clearly been eating well, Adrian. I can see the evidence in your cheeks."

Adrian's hand flew to his face in mock horror. "Lies!"

Then Evelyn's expression shifted. She arched one perfect eyebrow. "Speaking of lies... care to explain why you never mentioned being Nathan Blackwood's nephew?"

Adrian had the decency to look sheepish. He rubbed the back of his neck, offering her a charming, slightly guilty smile.

"In my defense, I saw the divorce headlines right before our trip. Was terrified you'd ditch me if you knew."

Lucas snorted. "Smart man."

But Adrian just grinned, moving closer with that irresistible Blackwood charm. "Evelyn would never be that cruel."

The ocean continued its eternal dance outside, waves crashing in rhythm with the unspoken truths between them.

Evelyn Sinclair felt a firm tug on her wrist as Lucas Sterling positioned himself protectively in front of her.

His chest puffed with unmistakable pride as he declared, "Our Evie's an absolute angel."

Then his expression darkened as he turned to face her fully. "But if you ever pull a stunt like this again—"

His voice cracked with emotion. "You let others take the bullet for you. Not the other way around. My baby sister doesn't play bodyguard for anyone!"

Evelyn's vision blurred unexpectedly. She drew a shaky breath.

Before she could respond, Adrian Blackwood thumped his chest dramatically. "Won't be a next time! From now on, I'm Evie's human shield. We're family now!"

Evelyn's head snapped toward him in surprise.

Lucas looked equally stunned. "The hell we are!"

Adrian merely grinned, undeterred. "Evie promised to take care of me forever. That makes us family." He leaned in conspiratorially, resting his head against her shoulder with a playful wink.

Their proximity was suddenly interrupted by a familiar towering presence. Nathan Blackwood materialized like a storm, yanking his nephew away by the collar.

"Back. Off." The glacial command left no room for argument.

Adrian yelped, rubbing his neck indignantly. "Uncle Nate! Is this how you treat your favorite nephew? You're already disowned and owe me five billion dollars!"

"Worst investment of my life," Nathan deadpanned, his lethal gaze making Adrian shrink despite their mere five-year age difference.

Adrian straightened defiantly. Youth was on his side. So was his newfound friendship with Evelyn.

He'd play this advantage for all it was worth.

"Let's not discuss debts," Adrian began smugly, only to be cut off by Nathan's withering glare. The unspoken threat hung heavier than any spoken word.

Evelyn watched the exchange with growing amusement. The Blackwood men's theatrics never failed to entertain.

Adrian might be reckless, but his heart was in the right place. And Nathan—well, his protective instincts were as relentless as ever.

The standoff continued, charged with unspoken challenges and familial tension. Evelyn bit back a smile.

This was her life now. Chaotic. Dangerous. Unpredictable.

And she wouldn't have it any other way.

"Whatever the cost, I'll pay it." My voice trembled with urgency as I gripped the edge of the polished mahogany desk.

The banker's calculating gaze flickered between me and the documents spread before us. His gold-rimmed glasses reflected the dim office lighting, obscuring his expression.

Across from me, Evelyn Sinclair straightened her posture, her emerald eyes flashing with determination. The scent of her Chanel No.5 mingled with the sterile office air.

"Evelyn will cover it for me." I turned toward her, my pulse racing. "Isn't that right, Evelyn?"

She didn't hesitate. "Of course." Her manicured fingers tapped a rhythm on her designer handbag. "Every last cent."

The banker cleared his throat. "This is quite an unconventional request, Ms. Montgomery."

I leaned forward, my silk blouse sticking to my skin. "We're aware. But we're prepared to meet whatever terms you require."

Evelyn's phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with a message from Nathan Blackwood. She flipped it face down without reading.

"Let's discuss collateral," the banker suggested, opening a new file.

I exhaled sharply. This was happening. The deal was moving forward. Evelyn's steady presence beside me gave me courage.

"Whatever you need," Evelyn said smoothly. "We have properties, investments, connections."

The banker's pen hovered over the paperwork. "And if repayment becomes... problematic?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a confident smile. "It won't."

I reached for her hand under the table, squeezing it tightly. Her fingers were warm and steady against mine.

"Then we have an agreement," the banker concluded, extending his hand across the desk.

As we shook on it, I caught Evelyn's eye. The unspoken promise between us was clear - no matter the cost, no matter the risk, we would see this through together.
###Chapter 285 I Need You

Evelyn Sinclair felt a dull throb behind her temples. Until this moment, she had believed Adrian Blackwood was simply a struggling adventurer.

Had she known he was Nathan Blackwood's nephew, she would never have so recklessly promised to support him indefinitely.

"I can't possibly afford to maintain this aristocrat," Evelyn thought bitterly. Before she could voice her protest, Lucas Sterling cut her off.

"Is the Blackwood family trying to extort us? Just name your price then. It's not like we can't afford fifteen billion dollars!" Lucas scoffed, his aristocratic features twisting in disdain. "Only provincial pirates would consider that a fortune."

He turned his sharp gaze toward Adrian, lip curling. "What makes you think you can leech off our family? You'd just be wasting our resources! Get lost!"

Adrian remained unfazed by Lucas's hostility. Instead, he offered a charming smile. "Third Brother Sterling, I'm young, capable, and obedient. I swear I won't be a burden. Besides, I can earn my keep."

"All I want is to stay by Evelyn's side forever." The moment these words left Adrian's lips, the temperature in the hospital room plummeted.

Lucas felt the sudden chill and turned to see Nathan's expression had darkened dangerously.

"Don't even dream about it!" Lucas snapped, recognizing the brewing storm in Nathan's eyes.

Evelyn sighed and intervened. "Lucas, enough. I did make Adrian a promise."

Adrian's face lit up with hope.

"But that was before I knew your true identity," Evelyn continued firmly. "Since you concealed the truth, any promises I made will be significantly reduced."

Adrian's bright expression dimmed instantly, replaced by heartbreaking disappointment.

Remembering Nathan's earlier comment about Adrian being disowned from the Blackwood family, Evelyn softened slightly. The young man must have endured hardships.

"How about this, Mr. Blackwood," she proposed, "I'll have my brother reimburse you double for all expenses during this ordeal—including manpower, ransom, and Adrian's share."

She met Nathan's intense gaze steadily. This was her way of settling accounts cleanly between them.

The offer only made Nathan's expression grow stormier. His dark eyes churned with suppressed emotions as he visibly struggled to maintain control.

The silence stretched uncomfortably. Evelyn shifted on the hospital bed, her injuries making her appear paler and less guarded than usual.

The prolonged quiet became unbearable. "Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn finally said, her voice calm but firm, "let's be direct. What exactly do you want from me?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. Countless unspoken emotions flickered in his eyes—longing, frustration, vulnerability. Under Evelyn's expectant gaze, he finally lowered his defenses.

His voice emerged rough with emotion, carrying years of unexpressed desire. "I need you, Evelyn."
###Chapter 286 Give Me Another Chance

Nathan's voice was hypnotic, smooth as velvet yet rough with emotion.

The intensity in his gaze was barely contained, simmering beneath the surface.

His words hung in the air like a blade, sharp and unyielding. Evelyn's face paled instantly.

Her eyes widened in shock.

Had she heard him right? He wanted—

Her? The man who had discarded her like yesterday's trash was now choosing her?

Evelyn's mind reeled, struggling to process his words. What game was Nathan Blackwood playing?

The silence between them grew heavier, gnawing at her composure.

Nathan studied her face, absorbing every flicker of emotion—disbelief, confusion, resistance.

But not disgust. That absence gave him hope. He stepped closer, fingers twitching with the urge to brush back a loose strand of her hair.

He wanted her to feel the truth in his touch.

But before he could, she flinched away as if burned.

Moments ago, she had stood unbothered by Adrian's proximity. Yet now, she recoiled from him like he was poison.

The rejection cut deep, but Nathan masked the pain with a practiced smile.

His voice was low, rough with restraint.

"Evelyn, I'm not joking."

"These past months have been hell without you. Maybe our divorce... was a mistake."

Her brows furrowed.

Then, realization struck. She turned to him sharply.

The raw longing in his eyes was unmistakable—a fire that threatened to consume her.

For a heartbeat, something inside her trembled.

Was that... regret in his gaze? Affection?

The stagnant waters of her heart rippled—not with joy, but shock.

But just as quickly, she steeled herself.

Her lips curved into a cold smile. "Mr. Blackwood, the mistake wasn't our divorce. It was our marriage."

The words landed like a blow. Nathan stiffened.

His expression fractured, the warmth in his eyes shattering piece by piece.

Evelyn held his gaze, unflinching.

If he had asked for money, power, anything else—she would have granted it without hesitation.

But love? She refused to walk back into that inferno.

"Evelyn, just give me one more chance. I'll—"

She cut him off, her voice icy.

"Don't tell me you're regretting the divorce now. That you've suddenly fallen for me?"

Nathan didn't hesitate. "Yes." The word scraped from his throat, raw and desperate.

He admitted it—she was irreplaceable.

He admitted that losing her had been agony.

He admitted that letting her go was the greatest regret of his life.

If he could turn back time, he would fight to keep her.

But Evelyn only smiled, delivering her verdict with chilling calm.

"Mr. Blackwood, whatever we had is over."

"I've moved on. You mean nothing to me now. So let's not pretend there's anything left to discuss."

She offered him an out—gratitude for saving her life, repayment through her family's wealth.

But Nathan didn't want money.

"You mean nothing to me."

Those words carved into him deeper than any blade.

A bitter taste flooded his mouth. The pain was suffocating.

Evelyn Sinclair was no longer the woman who had once loved him without condition.

And Nathan Blackwood had no one to blame but himself.
###Chapter 287 That Was Never Me

Evelyn Sinclair's long lashes cast shadows on her cheeks as she absently stroked Leo's metallic fur. The AI tiger purred softly in her lap, its glowing amber eyes half-lidded with contentment.

Nathan Blackwood stood frozen before her, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit. Even as Evelyn's body language screamed dismissal, he couldn't bring himself to walk away. Not yet. Not when there was still so much left unsaid between them.

"Do you really think I'd give up that easily?" Nathan's voice cracked with emotion as he forced a humorless smile. His fingers trembled slightly as he reached into his breast pocket, retrieving a worn photograph he'd studied a thousand times before.

The edges were frayed from constant handling. Evelyn had saved his life all those years ago, yet never once mentioned it during their ill-fated marriage. Nathan refused to believe she could simply erase those feelings.

"That night in Montecito," he rasped, holding out the photo with shaking hands. "You never told me it was you."

Had he known the mysterious woman who'd pulled him from that burning building was Evelyn, everything would have been different. Their marriage might have stood a chance.

Evelyn's breath hitched when she glimpsed the image. Her fingers tightened around Leo's frame, the only outward sign of her distress. When she finally met Nathan's gaze, the raw guilt and regret in his stormy eyes told her everything she needed to know.

Ice flooded her veins. "So this is about debt?" Her lips pressed into a thin line as she deliberately looked away. "That woman isn't me."

The European terrorist attack, the underground fight rings - those memories belonged to another lifetime. One she'd buried long ago. Meeting Nathan had been both a blessing and her greatest regret.

Nathan recoiled as if struck. "That's impossible," he growled, the photo crumpling in his fist. The pain in his chest was physical, stealing his breath. Why would she deny it? Unless...

A cold laugh slipped past Evelyn's lips. "You're mistaken, Mr. Blackwood. We'd never met before our arranged marriage." She wouldn't let him reduce their painful history to some twisted sense of obligation. Not when she'd finally reclaimed her dignity.

Nathan watched helplessly as the warmth drained from Evelyn's sapphire eyes, replaced by glacial indifference. The realization hit him like a freight train - she wasn't just rejecting him, she was erasing their entire shared past.

"Fine," he whispered hoarsely, carefully smoothing the photograph before tucking it away. His large hands, usually so steady, trembled as they enveloped hers. "It doesn't matter if you deny it now. I meant what I said, Evelyn. I want us to try again."

Evelyn recoiled, but Nathan held fast. When she finally stilled, her gaze was terrifyingly calm. "Do you remember how much you despised me when I begged for your attention?" A cruel smile touched her lips. "Now you understand how pathetic wishful thinking can be."

The verbal blow landed with devastating precision. Nathan's entire body locked up, his carefully constructed composure shattering. The roles had reversed completely, and the irony tasted like ashes in his mouth.

Before he could respond, Evelyn called out sharply, "Lucas?"

The door flew open instantly. Lucas Sterling stood framed in the doorway, his protective stance making it clear he'd been waiting for this moment. His icy glare promised violence if Nathan overstepped again.

Evelyn smiled sweetly up at her brother. "Mr. Blackwood was just leaving." Her fingers never stopped moving through Leo's fur, the picture of relaxed indifference.

Nathan's jaw clenched. He'd never seen Evelyn like this - not angry, not heartbroken, just...done. The finality in her eyes terrified him more than any outburst ever could.

"Get out," Lucas snapped, stepping between them. His hatred was palpable. Anyone who hurt his sister was dead to him.

Evelyn had already turned away, her attention fixed on the cityscape beyond the windows. Nathan's throat worked as he fought for words that wouldn't come. In the end, all he could manage was a broken, "Rest well."

He paused at the threshold, shoulders hunched beneath an invisible weight. "My feelings won't change," he said quietly. "Maybe you can't believe that yet...but I'll spend the rest of my life proving it."

The door clicked shut behind him with awful finality.

Lucas immediately rounded on his sister. "What the hell was that about?" His protective instincts were on high alert, ready to hunt Nathan down if necessary.

But Evelyn just shook her head, her fingers tightening around Leo's frame as she stared at the spot where Nathan had stood. The photograph might have been tucked away, but its ghost still lingered between them - a reminder of everything they'd lost, and everything that could never be.
###Chapter 288 His Heart in Pieces

The door stood firmly between them, its soundproofing so impeccable that not a single whisper escaped.

Nathan remained oblivious to the conversation inside. That cryptic remark from Lucas had left him burning with curiosity. Evelyn bit her lower lip.

Her lashes fluttered downward as she murmured, "It's nothing. Lucas, how soon can we return home?"

"Two days, maybe three." His brow furrowed deeply.

"If there's something you're not telling me, I swear I'll make that bastard Nathan Blackwood pay." Leo peeked out from Evelyn's arms, his mechanical whiskers twitching.

"Mama said no to Papa," the AI tiger said mournfully. "Papa's heart is broken." Lucas froze mid-step.

"Papa? You mean Nathan Blackwood?!" Leo sighed dramatically, swinging his tiny paws. "The Great God Donovan reprogrammed me to be fair. All my bad memories of Papa are gone now."

Evelyn's eye twitched. "Donovan went too far this time. He can't just alter Leo's core programming!"

The robotic tiger puffed his chest proudly. "The Great God Donovan says emotional bias corrupts artificial intelligence!"

Exchanging exasperated glances, Evelyn and Lucas simultaneously realized arguing with Donovan Sterling's genius was futile.

Exhaustion finally overwhelmed Evelyn. The adrenaline from days of survival drained away, leaving her wounds throbbing and defenses shattered. She surrendered to the fever creeping through her limbs.

Nathan's haunting words echoed relentlessly in her mind, an inescapable mantra. She squeezed her eyes shut, but the memories flashed brighter - gunfire on foreign streets, the metallic scent of blood, screams swallowed by explosions.

Nightmares came in relentless waves. When she finally surfaced, dawn's pale light revealed Lucas keeping vigil at her bedside, dark circles shadowing his eyes.

She met his worried gaze steadily. "Lucas," her voice rasped, "I need a psychiatrist."

Moonlight fractured across the restless ocean, painting silver trails on the waves. Nathan stood motionless on the deck, his silhouette carved against the indigo night. The sea wind carried his unspoken anguish into the void.

"Here to drown your sorrows, Mr. Blackwood?" Dr. Maxwell Carter's teasing tone cut through the silence. He'd never seen the famously unflappable billionaire so visibly shaken by a woman's rejection.

Nathan's chiseled profile revealed nothing at first glance. But the military doctor recognized the storm beneath - that particular brand of helpless rage only love could inspire.

"She'll never forgive me." The words scraped raw from Nathan's throat.

Maxwell arched an eyebrow. "You saved her life. Surely that counts for something?"

A bitter laugh escaped Nathan. "She stopped hating me months ago." His knuckles whitened on the railing. "Not hating someone isn't the same as loving them."

The Blackwood and Sterling empires might be financially inseparable, but Evelyn Sinclair would carve out her own path - one that deliberately avoided his.

Maxwell clapped Nathan's shoulder. "Listen, you absolutely deserved that epic screwup six years ago. But if she's your person? Fight like hell. Otherwise what was the point of our SEAL team risking their necks?"

A reluctant smile tugged at Nathan's lips. The tension in his shoulders eased slightly. "The team got back safely?"

"Had to split up. You know how authorities react to multiple military choppers entering airspace." Maxwell hesitated. "By the way, your brother-in-law Donovan asked about trauma specialists today. Do you think Ms. Sterling—"

He stopped abruptly. Considering what Evelyn endured, most people would've shattered completely. Her ability to maintain composure was remarkable.

Nathan's entire body snapped to attention. All melancholy vanished, replaced by urgent concern. He was already striding away before Maxwell finished speaking.

"Damn, I'm just the emotional support sidekick now?" the doctor muttered to the empty deck.

Rounding the corridor, Nathan overheard Lucas's phone conversation with Alexander Sterling.

"—constant nightmares, low-grade fever, but coherent. Yes, I've got everything under control. She actually requested psychiatric evaluation herself—"

Nathan's breath hitched. He would've lingered, but Donovan's sharp gaze caught him from across the hall.

Lucas shot Nathan a withering look while continuing his report. "Of course I'm taking care of Evie! She's stable now, just... she specifically asked for a therapist."

Nathan's hands clenched into fists, his expression darkening with worry.
###Chapter 289 Get Out

The call ended with a sharp click.

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze locked onto Lucas Sterling, hostility simmering beneath the surface.

"What are you doing here?" Lucas crossed his arms, his tone dripping with challenge. "No one's here to back you up now."

Before this, Nathan had relied on his military connections to force Lucas—who refused to move—out of the way.

It had been pure humiliation.

Nathan's expression darkened. "I'll contact my friend—he's a psychiatrist."

The psychiatrist Nathan recommended was undoubtedly top-tier, but Lucas immediately shook his head.

"Not necessary. Alexander will handle it. You don't need to worry about it."

Nathan opened his mouth to argue, but Donovan Sterling cut in, siding with Lucas as he politely declined the offer.

After all, a psychiatrist would delve into personal vulnerabilities—and Evelyn Sinclair would never want her weaknesses exposed to Nathan or his associates.

Late that night, the hospital corridor was silent.

Lucas sprawled across the sofa outside Evelyn's room, exhaustion pulling at his limbs.

Inside, Nathan sat vigil by her bed, watching the subtle shifts in her sleeping expression—tension, fear, fleeting moments of calm.

Sleep was impossible.

His chest ached.

Evelyn always put on such a strong front, but now, stripped of defenses, her trauma was painfully visible.

The quiet stretched on.

Then—

A soft groan.

Evelyn stirred, her lashes fluttering before her eyes cracked open, dazed.

"Water..." she murmured weakly.

Nathan moved instantly, pressing a straw to her lips as he held a glass of warm water for her.

She drank greedily, awareness slowly returning.

When her gaze landed on him, she parted her lips, voice barely audible.

Nathan leaned in, his pulse quickening.

"…Nathan."

His name on her lips sent warmth flooding through him.

It had been so long since she'd said it.

"Evelyn," he answered softly, voice tender in the dim light. "What do you need?"

She was only half-conscious, her words slurred with exhaustion.

"…Get out."

Then her eyes fluttered shut again, her breathing evening out as she slipped back into sleep.

She missed the way Nathan's expression shattered.

The brief light in his eyes snuffed out instantly, replaced by something hollow.

The tenderness in his face fractured, piece by piece, until only devastation remained.

Silence swallowed the room, thick and suffocating.

After a long moment, Nathan reached out, brushing a strand of hair from Evelyn's forehead.

His voice was rough, barely above a whisper.

"Okay."

Two days later, the cruise ship docked.

Lucas and Donovan escorted Evelyn onto a private helicopter, which soared straight for New York City.

William Sterling had spent days sick with worry.

He needed to see his daughter with his own eyes—needed proof she was truly safe—before he could breathe again.

The helicopter touched down on the hospital's rooftop helipad.

With the finest doctors, cutting-edge equipment, and round-the-clock care, Evelyn's physical wounds healed swiftly.

Few knew of her return.

So, during her recovery, aside from the Sterling family and medical staff, no outsiders disturbed her.

William had no intention of announcing her survival—not yet.

She needed peace.

A psychiatrist visited daily, monitoring her progress.

Evelyn's mental resilience was remarkable. Her psychological barriers held firm, her state steadily improving.

Meanwhile, Donovan returned to the lab, resuming his confidential research.

Alexander Sterling juggled hospital visits and office duties, but despite the exhaustion, he was happier than he'd been in months.

The change in atmosphere at Sterling Corp was palpable.

Before, grief had clung to Alexander like a shadow, casting a gloom over the entire company.

Now, that weight had lifted.

He smiled more.

Lucas and William kept Evelyn company constantly—meals, drinks, binge-watching dramas.

As a superstar, Lucas didn’t just provide entertainment—he delivered real-time celebrity gossip about the actors on-screen, much to Evelyn's amusement.

Then, a few days later, a popular influencer dropped an explosive video.

Alongside Adrian Blackwood, the renowned explorer, there was another key figure in the footage—

Evelyn Sinclair.


###Chapter 290

The morning sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Highland Estates, illuminating the elegant study where Nathan Blackwood sat behind his mahogany desk. His fingers drummed against the polished surface, his mind racing with unspoken thoughts.

Across the room, Harrison stood silently, waiting for instructions. The tension in the air was palpable.

"Any updates?" Nathan's voice was low, controlled, but the edge in his tone was unmistakable.

Harrison cleared his throat. "The situation with Cassandra Delacroix has escalated. She's made another public statement about her supposed connection to you."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Deny it. Again."

Harrison hesitated. "Sir, at this point, the media is—"

"I don't care what the media thinks," Nathan interrupted sharply. "Handle it."

Harrison nodded and swiftly exited the room, leaving Nathan alone with his thoughts.

Meanwhile, in the heart of New York City, Evelyn Sinclair strode through the bustling lobby of Kingsley Tech, her heels clicking against the marble floor. Bennett followed closely behind, clutching a tablet filled with urgent messages.

"Evelyn, we have a problem," Bennett said, keeping his voice low. "Olivia Kensington is pushing for an emergency board meeting. She's claiming mismanagement of the Pacific Heights Project."

Evelyn didn’t break her stride. "Of course she is."

Her phone buzzed—a message from Isabella Montgomery.

"We need to talk. It's about Nathan."

Evelyn’s grip on her phone tightened. She exhaled sharply before replying.

"Not now."

But Isabella was persistent.

"It's serious. Meet me at Velvet Lounge. Tonight."

Evelyn tucked her phone away, her expression unreadable.

Back at Highland Estates, Nathan’s phone lit up with a call from Tristan Whitmore.

"Did you see the latest headlines?" Tristan’s voice was laced with amusement.

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose. "I don’t have time for this."

Tristan chuckled. "Oh, but you should. Cassandra’s latest stunt involves a very public declaration of love—complete with a billboard in Times Square."

Nathan’s patience snapped. "Get it taken down."

"Already on it," Tristan replied, still laughing. "But you might want to brace yourself. The press is having a field day."

Nathan ended the call and turned to the window, his reflection staring back at him—cold, composed, but beneath the surface, a storm was brewing.

As night fell over the city, Evelyn slipped into Velvet Lounge, the dim lighting and soft jazz music a stark contrast to the chaos of her day. Isabella was already waiting at their usual booth, a martini in hand.

"You look like hell," Isabella remarked as Evelyn sat down.

Evelyn smirked. "Long day."

Isabella leaned forward, her expression turning serious. "Nathan’s in trouble."

Evelyn’s fingers stilled around her glass. "What kind of trouble?"

Isabella lowered her voice. "Cassandra isn’t just after him for publicity. She’s working with someone—someone powerful. And they’re targeting both of you."

Evelyn’s pulse quickened. "Who?"

Before Isabella could answer, Evelyn’s phone buzzed again—this time, an unknown number.

The message was simple, yet chilling.

"You should have stayed out of this, Evelyn."

Her breath caught.

The game had just changed.

Adrian Blackwood's social media account had amassed an enormous following.

His unique identity as an explorer and strikingly handsome features made him the ultimate heartthrob.

What truly set his account apart was its unwavering authenticity - every post was raw, unfiltered reality.

The footage was always breathtakingly real, filled with unexpected twists that kept viewers on edge.

After nearly a month without updates, fans had grown increasingly concerned for Adrian's safety.

Then suddenly, his latest adventure dropped online.

Within minutes, it sent shockwaves across the internet. Adrian was deep in the jungles of Pacifica Island.

But the real bombshell? Evelyn Sinclair appeared to be with him.

The woman everyone believed had perished in that plane crash was miraculously alive! Though Evelyn's screen time was limited, the most electrifying moment came during a torrential downpour when native tribesmen pursued them.

With the camera strapped to his chest, Adrian captured their desperate flight through the storm.

Rain lashed at their faces as they sprinted through the jungle, breath ragged, clothes soaked through.

The camera caught Evelyn's near-miss with a hidden pitfall - Adrian's quick reflexes saving her at the last possible second.

Every frame pulsed with heart-stopping tension.

Even when Evelyn fell, scraping her arms and legs raw, she never complained or slowed them down.

The danger felt palpable through the screen, their survival hanging by a thread.

Viewers found themselves holding their breath, completely immersed in their perilous journey.

The video cut off just before their encounter with pirates.

The final frames showed Evelyn, disheveled but radiant, running toward the ocean.

Her dirt-streaked face broke into the most dazzling smile of pure relief.

Those luminous eyes - so full of life and unbreakable spirit - shone brighter than the emerging sun.

The closing shot froze on Evelyn laughing as she ran toward the sunrise, Adrian's voice calling "Eve!" just before she turned back.

The golden light haloed her wind-tossed hair, waves crashing dramatically behind her.

That single, breathtaking moment seemed to transcend time.

In under sixty seconds, the video exploded across every platform.

View counts skyrocketed by thousands per minute!

[OMG! Is that really Evelyn Sinclair?!]

[Our queen has returned! More stunning than ever!]

[The most badass princess is back! I'm literally crying happy tears!]

[Welcome home, Goddess Evelyn! We never stopped believing!]

[She's alive! What does this mean for the others?]

[Thank you Adrian for bringing her back to us!]

[Nobody talk to me - I'm still recovering from that "Eve" moment!]

News of Evelyn's survival dominated headlines worldwide.

Media outlets scrambled for exclusive coverage, some staking out Adrian's production office, others camping outside Sterling Tower.

The frenzy exceeded all expectations.

Meanwhile, completely unaware of the chaos she'd ignited, Evelyn rested peacefully in her hospital room.

Lucas Sterling fussed over her, bringing an endless parade of gourmet meals.

Leo purred contentedly in William Sterling's lap, tail flicking happily.

Their peaceful bubble remained intact until the first wave of reporters hit the hospital.

Doctors, nurses, and security formed a human barricade, but the press pack wasn't giving up easily.
###Chapter 291 I Want to Fly My Own Plane

Hearing those familiar voices, Evelyn Sinclair's brows knitted together.

"That sounds like Isabella Montgomery," Lucas Sterling murmured doubtfully. He rose from his chair and stepped outside, returning moments later with Isabella, Natalie Beaumont, and Sebastian Hart in tow.

All three visitors had red-rimmed eyes.

Isabella rushed forward the moment she spotted Evelyn. "Evie!" Natalie moved to embrace her too, but Lucas caught her sleeve.

"One at a time!" Lucas chided. "Don't jostle my sister's injuries!" Natalie immediately stilled.

The concern in her gaze was palpable. "You're hurt?" Evelyn patted Isabella's back while smiling at Natalie.

"I'm nearly recovered now," she assured them.

Sebastian stood apart, looking utterly disheveled - gaunt, exhausted, with days' worth of stubble shadowing his jaw. Seeing Evelyn alive and well, he suddenly dropped to one knee beside her hospital bed and broke into loud sobs.

Isabella's own choked-back tears halted in surprise. Natalie looked stunned into silence.

The previously somber atmosphere dissipated instantly.

William Sterling, pretending not to notice the scene, stood and carried Leo from the room. At the doorway, he muttered, "Anyone walking in would think there's been a death."

Lucas watched Sebastian's dramatic display with equal parts amusement and secondhand embarrassment. Unable to bear it, he escaped into the hallway for air.

Natalie finally managed to haul Sebastian upright. "What are you crying for? Evelyn's safe - this calls for celebration!"

Sebastian continued weeping while clutching Evelyn's sleeve. "I thought you were dead, Evie. You scared the hell out of me!"

Isabella sniffled. While everyone was emotional, Sebastian had completely shattered first. "Evelyn Sinclair, how could you not tell us you were back? We mourned you!"

Evelyn's nose tingled. She swallowed hard. "I'm sorry. I didn't want you seeing me in that condition. I planned to wait until I'd healed..."

Even typically composed Natalie couldn't stop her tears now. "It doesn't matter. You're here. You survived something impossible!"

They pressed for details, and Evelyn shared her ordeal - there were no secrets between them. The harrowing experience already felt like another lifetime.

Isabella and Natalie listened raptly, but Sebastian grew increasingly sullen. When the tale ended, Evelyn nudged him with her foot. "Sebastian, you didn't react at all to my story."

He lowered his hands from his face, expression devastated. His voice cracked with regret. "Why wasn't I the one who saved you? Why does it always have to be Nathan Blackwood?"

The room plunged into silence so absolute they could hear the IV drip.

Natalie shot Sebastian a warning look, then deliberately blocked Evelyn's view of him as she changed subjects. "Adrian Blackwood released that video. That's how we knew you were alive."

"You've gone viral," she continued, pulling up trending topics on her phone. The footage had amassed millions of views in hours, far exceeding expectations.

Evelyn pursed her lips, unsurprised. Adrian had warned her on the island that if they survived, she might feature in his work.

"Let Alexander handle the publicity," Evelyn said. "I've purchased private planes. I'm learning to fly them myself." After her traumatic experience relying on another pilot, she'd decided to take control.

Isabella squealed. "That's incredible!"

Natalie, ever practical, cautioned, "Maybe think this through..."
###Chapter 292 Thank You for Never Giving Up

The online storm showed no signs of calming down.

Views and comments skyrocketed as the viral video spread like wildfire across every platform.

Evelyn Sinclair had nearly recovered and was preparing to leave the hospital.

Despite layers of disguises—oversized sunglasses, a wide-brimmed hat, and a face mask—she was recognized the moment she stepped outside.

Reporters swarmed her like vultures, microphones thrust forward.

"Ms. Sinclair, are the accounts of your survival true?"

"Ms. Sinclair, what would you like to say after enduring such an ordeal?"

"Do you believe the plane crash was truly an accident?"

"Will you be pursuing a relationship with Adrian Blackwood?"

The barrage of questions was relentless. Cameras flashed incessantly, blocking the hospital entrance.

Bodyguards formed a tight circle around Evelyn and Lucas Sterling, shielding them from the frenzy.

The crowd was suffocating. Lucas, accustomed to the spotlight, knew these reporters wouldn’t back down easily.

His patience wore thin.

Without hesitation, he pulled Evelyn close and strode toward the waiting black Bentley limousine.

But Evelyn suddenly stopped.

She lifted her head, revealing striking eyes that shimmered with an unexpected sorrow.

The crowd fell silent, waiting.

Her voice was hoarse but clear.

"I’m grateful for everyone’s concern, but please—stop focusing on me."

A pause.

"Because... there were over thirty people on that plane who weren’t as fortunate as I was."

Her words hung heavy in the air.

"Every time this story resurfaces, their families relive the pain."

With that, she bowed deeply.

The once-chaotic atmosphere turned somber.

Evelyn said nothing else. Lucas guided her into the car, his grip protective.

Her survival wasn’t just a miracle—it was a reminder of loss.

She was the sole survivor.

Her brief statement resonated deeply online.

Adrian Blackwood even took down his trending video in response.

(You can truly see someone’s character in moments like this. Evelyn is a queen for thinking of others during her own trauma.)

(A heart of gold and beauty to match. Marry me, Evelyn!)

(I’m a family member of one of the victims. We believe they’re still out there, just like Ms. Sinclair was. She’s our hope.)

This last comment was pinned to the top with thousands of likes.

Evelyn, now with a new phone, saw it immediately.

She replied:

"No matter the distance—time, space, or oceans—they’ll find their way back. Thank you for never giving up."

Perhaps her words had power, or perhaps the platform intervened, but the frenzy finally died down.

Reporters no longer camped outside Sterling Tower.

For the first time in weeks, Evelyn had peace.

She didn’t rush back to work.

Maybe the desert had drained her.

Now, she indulged—shopping, yachting, binge-watching dramas with her father.

William Sterling spoiled her endlessly.

Fishing trips. Lavish parties. No expense spared.

Life was blissful.

Until an unknown number flashed on her screen.

Assuming it was a friend with a new phone, she answered cheerfully.

"Hey! Who’s this?"

A beat of silence.

Then, a deep, achingly familiar voice.

"Nathan Blackwood."

Click.

Evelyn hung up.

Nathan stared at his phone, jaw clenched.

The call had lasted three seconds.

He’d been overseas, buried in work, forcing himself not to think of her.

Not to worry about her recovery—physical or emotional.

But he no longer had the right.

He’d watched Adrian’s video on loop.

Each viewing felt like a knife twisting in his chest.

The world praised her bravery.

Only he saw the fear behind her strength.

Fresh off his flight, he’d caved and borrowed his driver’s phone to call her.

This was the result.
###Chapter 293 Who Would Want You Anyway?

Harrison trailed behind Nathan Blackwood, struggling with the heavy suitcase.

The cold aura radiating from his boss made him hesitate before speaking up.

"Sir, your phone..." Harrison's voice trembled slightly.

The driver, Bennett, watched in horror as Nathan nearly crushed the expensive device in his grip.

Recognizing Evelyn Sinclair's number, Nathan dialed a random contact instead.

This was the property of N?-velDrama.Org.

After saving her life, Nathan expected some change between them.

But Evelyn hung up the moment she heard his voice. His expression darkened as he deleted the call history and tossed the phone back.

Harrison quickly returned the phone to Bennett before catching up with Nathan's long strides.

"Sir, Mr. von Strauss invited you to the soft opening of his gallery restaurant tonight at Sterling Manor."

Meanwhile, Evelyn twirled before her dressing room mirror, humming as she selected an outfit for tonight's gala.

This marked her first public appearance since returning.

Perfection was non-negotiable.

Nathan's call barely registered - just another nuisance.

She'd show her gratitude, but never herself!

In the living room, Lucas Sterling groaned as Evelyn modeled her fifth ensemble.

At this rate, she'd try on every new collection this season. "I suddenly miss my film set," he muttered.

William Sterling arrived with a velvet box containing a breathtaking pink diamond necklace.

Each stone was rare and exquisitely cut.

It complemented the blush silk gown hugging Evelyn's curves perfectly.

Her cascading waves framed the delicate jewelry.

The harmonious combination satisfied Evelyn immensely.

Understated yet stunning - exactly her style. Lucas narrowed his eyes.

"Isn't that meant for your future daughter-in-law?" he challenged.

William rolled his eyes. "Only blind women would settle for you."

"So this belongs to my future sister-in-law?" Lucas scoffed at his father's disdain.

Evelyn blinked innocently. "Lucas, this design isn't reserved for in-laws. You should feel threatened."

He choked on his retort.

As Lucas stood to accompany her, Evelyn stopped him. "I already have an escort."

"Who?" William and Lucas demanded simultaneously.

"Adrian Blackwood. My island rescuer."

Lucas relaxed.

According to his sister's usual tastes, the adventurous type wouldn't stand a chance. William nodded approvingly.

"Very well. Have Archibald drive you." The butler smiled, already preparing the car.

No way would they let Evelyn drive herself looking this radiant.

As twilight painted the sky, city lights flickered to life.

Adrian Blackwood stood waiting in a tailored suit, drawing admiring glances.

The exclusive event's minimalist decor reflected von Strauss' signature style.

While Adrian ordered refreshments, Evelyn explored the gallery.

One painting stopped her cold.

The striking image of a woman in red - unmistakably Evelyn - supporting an unconscious Nathan through darkness toward light.

Her breath caught.

"Enjoying your portrait?" Friedrich von Strauss appeared behind her.

"Of course," Evelyn recovered smoothly. "Not everyone possesses such beauty."

The artist snorted, studying his work. "That restaurant photo inspired this."

Evelyn's smile faded. "Name your price. I want this painting."

"Not for sale!" von Strauss refused sharply.

As Evelyn prepared to argue, she sensed intense scrutiny.

Nathan stood nearby, his piercing gaze fixed on the painting - and her.

Their eyes met.

Her pulse quickened.

The sudden movement startled everyone in the room.

Evelyn Sinclair's breath hitched as she instinctively stepped back.

Nathan Blackwood's protective arm shot out, shielding her from whatever threat had emerged.

Vanessa Holloway's shrill scream pierced the air, her manicured hands flying to her mouth.

"Who the hell—?" Harrison, Nathan's assistant, moved swiftly toward the disturbance.

The heavy velvet curtains billowed violently as a figure tumbled through the open window.

Glass shattered across the marble floor of Highland Estates' grand parlor.

Evelyn's pulse raced as she recognized the intruder's familiar silhouette.

"Sebastian?" Her voice trembled with disbelief.

Sebastian Hart rolled to his feet, his expensive suit torn at the shoulder.

His usually impeccable hair was disheveled, sweat glistening on his forehead.

"You have to get out of here—now!" He gasped, clutching his side.

Nathan's expression darkened. "Explain yourself, Hart."

Before Sebastian could respond, the sound of approaching vehicles echoed from outside.

Red and blue lights flashed through the broken window, painting the walls in eerie hues.

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "Police?"

Vanessa's laughter rang out, sharp and triumphant. "Oh, this is perfect."

Isabella Montgomery grabbed Evelyn's arm. "We need to leave through the back."

Nathan's phone buzzed urgently. Harrison checked the screen, his face paling.

"Sir, it's Kingsley Tech. Their servers just went dark."

Dominic Kingsley's voice crackled through the speaker. "We've been hacked. All our files—"

The line went dead.

Evelyn met Nathan's gaze, realization dawning.

This wasn't just an attack.

It was a carefully orchestrated takedown.

And they were standing right in the crosshairs.

The front door burst open with a thunderous crash.

"Freeze! FBI!"

Evelyn barely had time to register the armed agents swarming the room before Nathan shoved her behind a marble pillar.

Gunfire erupted.

Screams.

Chaos.

Through the smoke and confusion, one horrifying truth became clear—

Someone had framed them.

And unless they acted fast, they'd both be spending the night in federal custody.

Nathan's lips brushed her ear as he pulled her toward a hidden passage.

"Trust me?"

Evelyn didn't hesitate.

She grabbed his hand and ran.
###Chapter 294 The Art of Possession

Evelyn's body tensed instantly. Too late to escape now.

Nathan Blackwood had already closed the distance between them with powerful strides.

He pulled a photograph from his pocket. His brow furrowed as he studied the painting on the wall with laser focus.

Identical. His face paled.

"How did you—" Mr. von Strauss glanced at the photo in Nathan's hand and remarked casually, "Ah, so you're the thief who stole my photograph?"

Nathan's expression darkened.

His gaze flickered to Evelyn, but she deliberately avoided eye contact.

Evelyn's subtle makeup enhanced her delicate features. The blush-pink gown hugged every perfect curve, transforming her into a vision of ethereal beauty.

Gone was her usual icy demeanor. Tonight she radiated softness. A breathtaking sight that held Nathan captive.

His eyes darkened dangerously.

"Mr. von Strauss, this photo—"

"Yes, my work." The old man nodded proudly. "I captured that moment when this young lady pulled you from danger while I enjoyed my espresso across the street."

"One of my finest pieces. Interested?" His words shattered Evelyn's earlier denial about being the painting's subject.

Evelyn's temper flared.

"Master von Strauss! I inquired first! You refused to sell it to me—first come, first served should apply!"

The artist merely smiled at Nathan.

"I sell to whomever pleases me most at the moment."

He'd treated Victoria Ashford the same way when she'd begged for a portrait last season.

Nathan's gaze burned with intensity. A smirk played on his lips.

"Name your price. I'll pay any amount."

Von Strauss extended one gnarled finger.

Without hesitation, Nathan turned to Harrison. "Transfer $100 million immediately."

Harrison's jaw dropped.

"A hundred million for one painting? Not even Renaissance masterpieces command—"

The artist chuckled, nodding toward Evelyn. "Send the money to her. The muse deserves compensation."

Evelyn nearly choked on her outrage.

The man had gone mad! She couldn't stay another second. As she turned to leave, Adrian appeared with a roguish grin.

"Evie! There you are—" His smile faltered when he noticed Nathan. "Uncle? What brings you here?"

Nathan's face turned thunderous.

His glare turned arctic when Adrian affectionately called her "Evie." The temperature in the room plummeted.

Adrian casually looped his arm through Evelyn's. "Feel like catching a movie later?" he asked, flashing a charming smile.

The atmosphere grew palpably tense.

Von Strauss observed them with amused curiosity, clearly puzzled by the dynamics.

Adrian introduced himself boldly while gazing at Evelyn with undisguised admiration. "Adrian Blackwood. Evie and I have faced death together—we share an unbreakable bond."

Nathan's expression darkened visibly.

The old artist muttered something noncommittal before hastily excusing himself from the charged scene.

Left alone, Nathan's voice cut like ice. "Adrian. You've grown bold."

Adrian met his uncle's glare with feigned innocence. "You're divorced, Uncle. Can't two single people explore their connection?"

The air turned lethal.

Harrison frantically signaled Adrian to stop, but the younger man deliberately ignored him.

"Evie, shall we?" Adrian asked casually. Evelyn nodded eagerly—anything to escape this nightmare.

As they turned, Nathan's voice froze them in place.

"Shall I shut down your studio permanently, Adrian?"

Adrian stumbled mid-step.

"That's low, Uncle." He hesitated, not wanting to lose face before Evelyn. After a tense pause, he whispered, "Evie, go ahead. I'll catch up."

Evelyn vanished without a backward glance.

Adrian squared his shoulders, adopting a defiant smirk. "Empty threats won't change her feelings, Uncle."

Nathan advanced like a storm. "Who gave you permission to call her 'Evie'?"
###Chapter 295 You Can't Separate Lovebirds

Adrian Blackwood instinctively retreated a step. He still lacked the courage to challenge Nathan Blackwood directly.

Yet he gathered his resolve and stammered, "She—she said it herself! Uncle Nathan, you can't just tear apart—"

"—lovebirds."

The words had barely left his lips when Adrian found himself slammed against the wall.

His scalp prickled with adrenaline. White-hot pain shot through his spine. Though an experienced explorer with superior physical conditioning, Adrian might as well have been a helpless child against Nathan's ruthless strength.

His pride lay shattered beneath Nathan's polished Oxfords.

Nathan's glacial stare held no trace of familial warmth. His movements were precise, calculated.

"Adrian Blackwood," he enunciated each syllable like a death sentence, "if you're courting death, I'll happily oblige."

Harrison rushed forward. "Mr. Blackwood, surely we can discuss this reasonably!"

"Young Master Adrian was merely joking! As if Ms. Sinclair would ever be interested in him!" The assistant's intervention cut deeper than Nathan's physical assault.

Yet defiance flickered through Adrian's fear.

The thought of Evelyn reignited his bravado. "Why wouldn't she be? Evie clearly prefers younger men after her divorce."

All those tabloid rumors about Evelyn's supposed lovers shared one common trait—they were nothing like corporate titans like Nathan Blackwood. This knowledge fueled Adrian's confidence.

Nathan's laugh carried Arctic winds. His gaze could have frozen molten steel.

"Final warning," he said, adjusting his cufflinks with lethal calm. "Stay away from her. Or I'll arrange a marriage alliance for you myself." The threat landed with the weight of an executioner's axe.

This wasn't a warning. It was a decree.

Adrian's expression cycled through shock, anger, and resignation. For lesser heirs like him—those who hadn't seized control of their family empires—destiny remained a puppet in stronger hands.

Nathan released him with disdain, turning away without another glance. Harrison followed, carefully retrieving the nine-figure painting while casting Adrian a pitying look.

Of all women in the world, why choose Nathan Blackwood's? That wasn't bravery—it was suicide.

Meanwhile, Evelyn enjoyed her meal undisturbed.

Throughout dinner, a steady stream of socialites approached her table, requesting connections on social media. Recognizing several faces from charity galas, Evelyn accepted their friend requests with polite smiles.

The crowd buzzed with excitement over this rare opportunity. Nearby, Nathan overheard a cluster of young aristocrats comparing phones.

"Can't believe Evelyn Sinclair accepted my request!" one gushed.

"Me too! She's so approachable for someone so stunning—"

"Wait, why hasn't she accepted mine yet?" another voice whined in disappointment.

Nathan's clenched jaw relaxed marginally as he strode away.

Evelyn finally escaped the social onslaught just as Adrian emerged, looking like a man returning from war.

"Evie, let's go," he muttered.

Nodding, Evelyn checked movie times on her phone while following him to the car. Adrian's hands trembled slightly on the wheel, still shaken by his encounter.

As they descended the hill, blinding headlights suddenly filled the windshield.

The collision sent Adrian's luxury car lurching forward.

"Bloody hell!" He slammed the steering wheel before recognizing the other vehicle—and its occupant.

Nathan stood silhouetted against the headlights, inspecting the damage with clinical detachment before turning that arctic gaze on them.

Adrian froze like a rabbit spotting a wolf.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "You're terrified of him, aren't you?"

Adrian's knuckles whitened on the wheel. "It's not fear," he ground out. "It's called respect."
###Chapter 296 The Divorced Couples Date

Evelyn arched a perfectly sculpted brow as she watched Adrian step out of his car like a man walking to his execution.

The collision had left Nathan's understated yet exorbitant Cayenne with significant damage.

Oddly enough, Adrian's Jeep Grand Cherokee remained unscathed. He still couldn't wrap his head around how the accident had even happened.

In this situation, Adrian certainly looked guilty. Normally, such matters could be resolved with money—but the other party was Nathan Blackwood. This wouldn't be simple.

Nathan's dark gaze pinned Adrian in place, his voice laced with icy authority. "Legal proceedings or private settlement?"

Adrian pressed his lips together. "Do I even have a choice?"

"Legal it is, then." Nathan pulled out his phone with deliberate calm. "I'll call your father."

Adrian stiffened. "Wait—Uncle Nathan, let's settle this privately!"

Nathan pocketed his phone and tossed his keys at Adrian. "Get it fixed. Now."

"Now?" Adrian fumbled with the keys, torn between leaving and staying. Evelyn was still waiting in his car for their movie plans.

Nathan's expression darkened. "You're still here?"

Adrian swallowed hard. "I—I'll just apologize to Evelyn later!"

Evelyn frowned as Adrian sprinted toward Nathan's car. Before she could process it, Nathan straightened his suit jacket and slid into the driver's seat beside her.

She turned to him, voice frosty. "Mr. Blackwood, are you in the wrong car?"

Nathan's expression was smooth, all traces of earlier anger expertly masked. A hint of warmth softened his sharp features.

His voice was low, velvety—dangerously charming. "No. He insisted on repairing my car and asked me to accompany you."

"Didn't you want to see a movie?"

With that, he started the engine and drove toward the city's grandest theater as if there was nothing unusual about this arrangement.

In all their years together, they had never gone to the movies. Never done the ordinary things couples did.

The realization twisted something in Nathan's chest, leaving him breathless.

Evelyn studied him like he was a stranger. "Mr. Blackwood, what are you doing? Have you ever heard of divorced couples going on movie dates?"

The idea was absurd.

Nathan's smile didn't waver. "What's the problem? Divorced couples can always remarry."

He was testing the waters, phrasing it as an indisputable fact rather than a question.

Evelyn fell silent. Her eyes were unreadable, the air between them turning frigid.

Nathan kept his gaze forward, but he felt the weight of her detachment like a blade against his skin.

For the first time in his life, he was nervous around a woman—and he had no one to blame but himself.

"Stop the car." Evelyn's voice was glacial.

Nathan's jaw tightened, but his tone remained gentle. "We're not there yet."

Evelyn gave him one long, measured look. Then, without hesitation, she unbuckled her seatbelt and pushed the door open.

Cold wind rushed in. Nathan's composure shattered.

"Evelyn—!"

The car screeched to a halt.

Nathan yanked her back just as she was halfway out, his heart hammering against his ribs. The bitterness in his chest swelled, drowning him in helpless frustration.

His grip on her arm trembled.

She’d rather throw herself out of a moving car than spend another minute with him.

The realization gutted him.

His carefully constructed calm collapsed. Pain flickered in his eyes, darker than midnight.

"Evelyn." His voice was rough, raw—pleading.
###Chapter 297 My Investments Include Everything

Evelyn didn't make it out of the car.

She remained seated, casting a sideways glance at Nathan. Her icy stare matched the chill of the night air.

Remarry him? Over her dead body! The mere suggestion made Evelyn's blood boil, even as a joke.

Nathan's dark eyes seemed to absorb the surrounding darkness.

"Why did you lie about saving me?" he thought. "The woman in that photo is unmistakably you. Why won't you admit it?"

When Nathan confirmed Evelyn's identity, conflicting emotions surged through him - frustration mixed with unexpected joy.

Evelyn laughed coldly. "So what if it was me? What difference does it make now?" Her words left him speechless.

Indeed, what could he do? Nathan's expression froze, his lips pressed into a tight line.

The usually composed businessman seemed on the verge of unraveling. Evelyn noticed with quiet satisfaction.

Her crimson lips parted. "Mr. Blackwood, can't you see? I lied because I want nothing more to do with you. That chapter is closed, and I never look back."

"Not just remarriage - I don't reconcile with anyone I've cut ties with. Move on, Nathan. We're free to marry whomever we choose. When you do, expect an extravagant gift from me."

Her smile didn't reach her eyes. Each word pierced Nathan's heart like shards of glass.

The pain left him breathless. How could she dismiss their shared history so easily? She spoke as if erasing years in a single sentence.

Evelyn reached for the door handle.

Nathan's voice stopped her, surprisingly gentle. "Evelyn, I saved your life once. Can you at least acknowledge that?"

She froze.

Half-turned, she saw the bitter twist of his lips. "Fine, no more talk of remarriage. But must you avoid me like the plague? If it's truly in the past, can't we be... friends?" He forced out the last word through clenched teeth.

Evelyn studied his face. If he could drop the romantic nonsense, she'd tolerate his presence. "Fine."

She settled back into the seat, staring resolutely ahead.

At the cinema, Evelyn's evening gown drew immediate attention. She might as well have been a celebrity at a premiere.

Suddenly, a suit jacket draped over her shoulders, shielding her from prying eyes.

"Keep it on unless you want tabloid headlines tomorrow," Nathan murmured. The jacket would help her blend in.

Evelyn's hand hovered near the jacket before dropping. "Let's get tickets then. Which film did you invest in, Mr. Blackwood?" She scanned the listings skeptically.

None were new releases. The liar.

Nathan glanced casually at the board. "Actually, I invested in all of them."

Evelyn's mouth fell open.
###Chapter 298 Came With the Tickets

Nathan Blackwood approached the ticket counter, his striking features immediately drawing every eye in the lobby.

The young attendant's cheeks flushed pink as she recommended several romantic comedies.

With barely a glance at the options, he selected the film with the nearest showtime.

His gaze drifted sideways, noticing a couple sharing an oversized bucket of popcorn and soda. A slight frown creased his forehead.

Evelyn Sinclair sat nearby, idly scrolling through her phone with one hand propping up her chin.

Her group chat with Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont buzzed with ski trip plans.

She hesitated to contribute, knowing their reactions if they discovered she was at the movies with Nathan Blackwood of all people.

A college-aged boy approached with nervous energy. "Excuse me, miss. Are you from NYU? Which department?"

Evelyn blinked. NYU's campus was just blocks away. A thrill ran through her at being mistaken for a student.

Before she could respond, the boy extended his phone. "Could I get your number? Our theater group needs a leading lady."

Her starry eyes crinkled with amusement as she smiled.

The boy remained oblivious to the glacial presence materializing behind Evelyn.

Nathan's hand came to rest on the back of her chair like a territorial claim. His stormy gaze pinned the younger man in place.

"What seems to be happening here?" His voice carried the chill of Arctic winds.

The Rolex on his wrist represented more money than the student would see in years. Everything about him screamed power and privilege.

The boy's shoulders slumped as he pocketed his phone with mumbled apologies before fleeing.

Evelyn's smile faded as she watched him go. Nathan noted her disappointment, his mood darkening like storm clouds gathering.

When she turned back, her eyebrows lifted at the sight in his hands. The massive popcorn bucket and soda looked absurd against his tailored Burberry trench coat.

Noticing her expression, Nathan cleared his throat. "They came with the tickets."

She accepted this without question. Nathan Blackwood buying movie snacks? Preposterous.

Inside the theater, Evelyn glimpsed their tickets. "A horror film?" Her tone flattened as they entered.

The nearly empty auditorium held only one other couple. Horror had fallen out of fashion against comedies and prestige dramas.

Nathan moved to sit beside her when she plopped the popcorn between them like a barrier.

His displeasure showed plainly. Evelyn met his gaze coolly. "Friends maintain boundaries, Mr. Blackwood."

Harrison's advice from earlier echoed in his mind: Patience is key when pursuing someone like Ms. Sinclair. Storming off won't work.

After half a second's consideration, Nathan took the designated seat.

Progress, he reminded himself. Merely sitting through a film together counted as progress.

The couple ahead alternated between passionate kisses and exaggerated screams during scary scenes.

"Ah! Too terrifying!" the girl shrieked, burying her face in her boyfriend's chest.

Nathan's fingers tightened around the armrests. This wasn't exactly the romantic atmosphere he'd envisioned.
###Chapter 299 Stay Away From Him

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze settled on Evelyn Sinclair beside him.

She was completely absorbed in the horror film playing on the massive screen.

Moonlight from the emergency exit illuminated her flawless profile.

Her delicate nose bridge and porcelain skin seemed to glow in the dim theater.

Unlike the screaming audience around them, Evelyn watched with detached amusement.

When the predictable jump scares came, she merely scoffed at the cheap special effects.

Her fingers never touched the popcorn bucket between them.

The couple in front had long abandoned watching, entwined in each other's arms.

As credits rolled, Evelyn checked her phone with a small sigh.

She turned to Nathan with raised eyebrows. "Mr. Blackwood, is there a reason you've been staring at me all night?"

Her voice carried clearly, making the couple ahead stiffen in surprise.

Nathan's response came low and measured. "You never specified where I should look."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Why aren't you scared?" he demanded suddenly.

Her laugh was brittle. "Real life makes this look like child's play." Her fingers tightened around her phone case.

The couple scrambled to leave, adjusting rumpled clothing with flushed cheeks.

A text notification lit Evelyn's screen. She stood abruptly. "Archibald's here. I'm leaving."

Nathan blocked her path. "I'll drive you."

At the theater entrance, Evelyn froze at the sight of her butler approaching.

Her voice turned glacial. "Even after everything, you had no right to interfere with Adrian. He's my closest friend."

Nathan's jaw clenched. All evening he'd studied her reactions like scripture.

This casual dismissal cut deeper than any blade.

Before he could respond, Evelyn turned toward the exit.

Something inside Nathan snapped.

In three strides, he pinned her against a marble pillar.

His grip on her shoulders bordered on painful. "Listen carefully, Evelyn."

The warning in his voice could freeze hell itself.

"Stay away from Adrian Blackwood." His breath fanned her cheek. "Or I'll make sure he regrets ever knowing you."

His thumb traced her collarbone. "You're the only one I spare, darling. Everyone else is expendable."
###Chapter 300 The Marriage Gambit

Nathan's gaze flashed with dangerous intensity, a momentary glimpse of steel beneath his usual aristocratic composure. The raw dominance in his eyes eclipsed all other emotions.

This was the true Nathan Blackwood - ruthless, unyielding, and utterly in control. As he released Evelyn's wrist, the Sterling family butler appeared at the worst possible moment.

"Miss Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood!" Archibald's eyebrows shot up in surprise. Nathan's expression smoothed into perfect neutrality, while Evelyn's face betrayed her agitation.

Her complexion had paled, lips pressed into a thin line of barely contained fury. The tension between them was palpable enough to make the butler hesitate.

Noticing Nathan's jacket draped over Evelyn's shoulders, Archibald quickly produced the cashmere wrap he'd brought. "Miss, your father is expecting you in the study."

Evelyn inhaled sharply. She shoved Nathan away with enough force to make him stagger back, then tore off his jacket and flung it at his chest.

Snatching the wrap from Archibald, she wrapped it around herself with jerky movements. One last scathing look at Nathan, and she stormed off without a backward glance.

That two-faced bastard! Playing the perfect gentleman all evening only to show his true colors at the last moment. Threatening me? Going after Adrian? He's nothing but a cowardly bully!

Archibald hurried after her, casting nervous glances back at Nathan.

Nathan watched Evelyn's retreating figure, the sharp angles of her shoulders telegraphing her rage. His own anger dissipated, replaced by something more complicated.

Had he gone too far?

Pulling out his phone, he dialed Harrison. "Shut down Adrian's studio. Transfer him to our Seattle branch immediately."

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn returned to Sterling Manor in a foul mood. William had come home early to discuss business matters with Alexander in the study.

Lucas was attempting to bathe Leo in the sunroom, much to the AI tiger's vocal displeasure.

"You're back already?" Lucas looked up in surprise as Evelyn slammed the front door.

The commotion brought William and Alexander downstairs. William's expression softened when he saw his daughter. "Didn't enjoy the party?"

Seeing her family, some of Evelyn's tension eased. "Dad, Alex... We need to send the Blackwoods an appropriately extravagant thank-you gift for saving my life."

Her voice dripped sarcasm. "Otherwise Nathan might accuse us of being ungrateful. Wouldn't want him using that as leverage, would we?"

William exchanged a glance with Alexander. "Your father and I were just discussing that. We've reached out several times, but Nathan keeps refusing monetary compensation."

His lips quirked. "Seems money can't solve this particular debt."

Evelyn's jaw clenched.

If not for Donovan's interference, that bastard would never have gotten close enough to play the hero! "Then what does he want?" Lucas asked absently, toweling off a sulking Leo.

Alexander's smile turned wry. "Isn't it obvious? Marriage would be the most advantageous solution. Nathan Blackwood doesn't let opportunities like this slip through his fingers."

He gestured around the lavish manor. "All this means nothing compared to what he really wants - you."

Evelyn stiffened.

Nathan's behavior tonight had made his intentions painfully clear.

The remorse, the marriage proposal - all empty gestures that meant nothing to her. Whether he was sincere changed nothing.

"You think saving my life entitles him to my feelings?" The words tasted bitter.

William shot Lucas a warning look before comforting Evelyn. "Don't worry, sweetheart. The Sterling family doesn't need marriage alliances to survive."

"If he won't take money, we have nothing else to offer. Let him keep waiting." He squeezed her shoulder. "I'd never force you to marry that man again."

Lucas quickly backtracked. "I'm on your side! Evie can marry anyone except Nathan Blackwood! That bastard belongs on our family's permanent blacklist!"

Evelyn stood abruptly. "He can try all the blackmail he wants. Worst case scenario, I'll just deny he saved me at all."

The Sterling men exchanged glances before nodding in agreement. Some battles required unconventional tactics.
###Chapter 301 Know Your Place

Evelyn Sinclair finally understood the situation, and a weight lifted from her shoulders.

The clock showed nearly 11:00 pm. She drew a steaming bubble bath, applied a revitalizing face mask, and prepared for bed.

Her phone buzzed with a new notification. A friend request with a painfully familiar black-and-white profile picture - Nathan Blackwood.

The attached message read: "Let's reconnect." Evelyn's lips curled in a humorless smile.

This man had just threatened her hours ago, demanding she stay away from Adrian. Now he had the audacity to send a friend request?

Her finger hovered for only a second before rejecting it without hesitation.

Exhaustion finally claimed her. She powered off her phone and surrendered to sleep. Across town, Nathan stared at his screen where the notification glared back: "Friend request declined."

He ran a hand through his hair. "Damn it, I pushed too hard." All night's efforts had backfired spectacularly. The frustration gnawed at him like a physical pain, leaving him staring at the ceiling until dawn.

The night stretched endlessly - peaceful for some, torturous for others.

Morning arrived at Blackwood Enterprises.

Harrison knocked tentatively before entering. He approached his boss with caution; Nathan's mood had been volcanic lately. One look confirmed today was no exception.

Clearly, things hadn't gone well with Evelyn Sinclair.

"Sir," Harrison began carefully, "the $100 million for the von Strauss painting has been transferred to Ms. Sinclair's assistant, Bennett."

Nathan barely acknowledged with a grunt. Harrison continued his report. "We've also frozen all funding to Young Master Adrian's production studio."

"Every one of his current projects has been pulled from distribution. The three upcoming collaborations? I've personally contacted the partners to terminate their contracts."

"By noon, his studio will be insolvent." For the Blackwood empire, crushing a fledgling production company required less effort than snapping fingers.

Adrian had chosen this path - the rebellious heir pursuing artistic dreams against family wishes. Building his studio from scratch had been his pride. Now? Reduced to ashes in hours.

Nathan checked his watch impatiently. Noon felt too generous. His phone vibrated - Adrian calling. He rejected it without blinking.

The phone rang again. And again. With each ignored call, Nathan's expression darkened further until he finally blocked the number entirely.

Harrison's phone lit up next. Adrian's name flashed on the screen. He glanced nervously at Nathan before silencing it.

"Get out," Nathan ordered. Harrison practically fled the office. Then the landline rang - the private line reserved for one caller.

Nathan hesitated before answering. "Grandfather."

"I hear you've dismantled Adrian's little venture?" The elder Blackwood's voice carried through the receiver.

Nathan loosened his tie. "I'm transferring him to manage our Pacific division. No more of this reckless filmmaking nonsense."

"As a Blackwood, he'll learn responsibility." The old man hummed approvingly. "Quite right."

"Grandfather! Don't side with him!" Adrian's indignant voice crackled through the speaker as he snatched the phone. "Uncle Nathan's destroying me! You canceled all my contracts? I'm drowning in debt!"

Nathan didn't hang up. His glacial stare could have frozen hell over. When he spoke, each word carried lethal precision.

"This is what happens when you covet what isn't yours."

Blood relation meant nothing when crossed. With that final warning, Nathan ended the call.
###Chapter 302 Spend Without Limits

The Celestial Club glittered under the city lights, an exclusive playground for the elite. Evelyn Sinclair had just wrapped up her meeting with Bennett and headed straight for the club's gilded doors.

A host in a tailored suit escorted her to the Platinum Suite.

Inside, the private celebration hosted by Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont was in full swing. Familiar faces mingled with rising stars from the entertainment industry—most of them male. Even Julian Moreau and Adrian Prescott were there.

The moment Evelyn entered, the room erupted in greetings.

She smiled, taking in the lively atmosphere. Isabella pulled her aside, whispering excitedly, "Consider this a buffet of the finest men in the city. Handpicked just for you. Don't hold back—take whoever catches your eye."

Evelyn stiffened, giving her friend a skeptical look.

"What's the occasion? You just got back from that hellish expedition!"

"Exactly!" Isabella grinned. "You've seen enough horrors. Now it's time to feast your eyes on something beautiful."

Evelyn exhaled, amused. The gesture was excessive, but she appreciated the thought.

"Thank you," she chuckled.

"We knew you'd love it!" Natalie chimed in.

Evelyn shook her head. What kind of friends did she have?

Her phone buzzed—Adrian Blackwood, asking for her location. After a brief hesitation, she sent him the address.

"Mind if someone joins us later?" she asked.

Isabella waved a dismissive hand. "As long as it's a man, bring as many as you want!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. She should've known better.

The room buzzed with laughter, clinking glasses, and playful banter. Models and actors loosened up, trading jokes and singing off-key.

Within twenty minutes, Adrian arrived, his usual confidence replaced by visible distress. He made a beeline for Evelyn.

"Eve, I need your help." His voice was rough with frustration.

She arched a brow. "What's wrong?"

Adrian clenched his jaw. "Nathan bankrupted my studio. I'm drowning in debt. He wants me under his thumb, working for him like some corporate drone."

Evelyn studied him—the disheveled hair, the shadows under his eyes. This wasn't the fearless adventurer she knew.

She took a slow sip of wine, then reached into her purse. "Will $100 million cover it?"

Adrian froze. The card she held out was the same one Nathan had given her for the von Strauss painting.

His stunned silence made her smile. Warm. Uncomplicated. "Didn't I tell you? Money's never been an issue for me."

She pressed the card into his hand. "If this is your dream, I'll support it."

Adrian stared at her, speechless. He'd come expecting her to mediate, to soften Nathan's stance—not this.

His throat tightened. "Eve, you're—"

"Don't." She raised a hand. "We're friends. This is nothing."

A slow grin spread across his face as he pocketed the card. "I never thought I'd meet a woman who gets me like this." He leaned in, voice dropping. "From now on, my heart—and everything else—is yours."

Evelyn laughed, pushing him away. "Not necessary."
###Chapter 303 Reborn

Evelyn Sinclair met Adrian Blackwood's gaze with cool indifference. She had no use for his affections or his empty promises.

His so-called "deep love" was nothing more than greed wrapped in pretty words. The thought lifted any guilt from her shoulders.

Without ceremony, Adrian took the money that would save his failing expedition dreams. From inside the private booth, Natalie Beaumont and Isabella Montgomery burst into laughter.

Isabella playfully nudged Evelyn's shoulder. "Damn, girl! That's how a Sterling heiress handles business!"

Evelyn tossed her golden hair. "Damn right I am!" The bass-heavy music pulsed through the Velvet Lounge.

The exclusive club buzzed with energy, each patron lost in their own world of champagne and secrets.

Evelyn's head spun slightly from one too many martinis. She pushed through the velvet curtains toward the restroom.

As she turned the corner, she collided with a woman whose shriek could shatter crystal.

"Watch where you're going, you drunken fool!" The woman brushed imaginary dirt from her designer dress. "This is a Valentino! Could you even afford the dry cleaning?"

The voice cut through Evelyn's haze like ice water. She looked up to see Margaret Blackwood - Nathan's mother - glaring down her nose.

"What an unexpected pleasure, Mrs. Blackwood." Evelyn's lips curled into a dangerous smile.

Margaret froze mid-tirade. She'd come to question staff about Sophia's disappearance, not face the woman who haunted her family.

In the past, Margaret could reduce Evelyn to tears with a glance. But now? Now Evelyn Sinclair commanded respect even Old Man Blackwood couldn't ignore.

Margaret's expression cycled through shock, rage, and forced politeness. Evelyn found the display utterly delicious.

"Oh. It's you." Margaret's voice lost its venom. She remembered Nathan's decree after Evelyn's miraculous return: "Evelyn is the only woman I'll ever marry. Cross her, and you answer to me."

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the pristine dress. "Name your price. I'll have my assistant write you a check."

"That won't be necessary." Margaret straightened her spine. She wouldn't grovel, but she wouldn't provoke either.

Behind Evelyn, Isabella's voice carried through the open door. "Hurry back, Evie! Your harem's getting restless!"

Margaret's nostrils flared. "Wait."

Evelyn paused. "Yes?"

"We need to talk." Margaret's tone brooked no argument.

"About?"

"Come." Margaret swept into an adjacent lounge like a queen holding court.

Evelyn almost laughed at the audacity. Yet curiosity won out. What could the Blackwood matriarch possibly want?

The private room reeked of Margaret's superiority complex. She perched on the leather sofa like it might contaminate her.

"Make it quick, Mrs. Blackwood." Evelyn checked her diamond-encrusted watch. "I have thirteen heartbroken men waiting."

Margaret's jaw tightened. "Since my son is foolish enough to want you back, you'd do well to clean up your scandalous behavior."
###Chapter 304 My Lovers

Margaret Blackwood's words hung in the air, making Evelyn Sinclair's expression freeze for a split second.

Then, Evelyn burst into laughter. "What does it matter whether Nathan is willing or not? It's not like I would ever agree."

Where did Margaret get such confidence? Why should Evelyn care about her personal life just because of Nathan's one-sided feelings? How absurd!

Margaret's face twisted in irritation.

"In a few days, Patriarch Blackwood will personally propose a marriage alliance with your Sterling family. This union will only benefit both families."

"Where else would you find a family as prestigious as ours?"

Margaret already felt they were being generous by allowing Evelyn back into their circle. What right did she have to act so high and mighty?

Evelyn was a divorced woman. Even with her family's status, most noble families would hesitate.

So why was she being so picky?

Since Margaret had extended an olive branch, Evelyn should have grabbed it without hesitation.

Evelyn's smile vanished, her eyes turning icy.

Her voice was sharp and clear. "I suggest you save yourself the embarrassment of coming to my doorstep."

"Even if I marry a stranger off the street, I would never choose your family. Don’t disgust me."

Margaret's face flushed with rage.

"Do you really think you have a say in this? Nathan saved your life! If it weren’t for him, you’d be dead!"

Evelyn stared at her indifferently. "So what if he did?"

"If you dare, come and see whether I can decide for myself."

Evelyn made her stance crystal clear.

"And no one gets to dictate my personal life."

"I won’t give up any of my thirteen lovers. Would the Blackwood family really tolerate that for the sake of this alliance?"

Suddenly, Evelyn felt grateful to Isabella and Natalie for throwing this party.

She had said everything she needed to. If they still insisted on humiliating themselves, that was their problem.

Margaret scoffed. "Evelyn, I never wanted to accept you, but Nathan is obsessed! He sent Sophia away and swore he must be with you!"

"Fine. In the future, even if you beg on your knees, don’t expect to step into our home!"

She trembled with fury.

Even if Nathan married Evelyn, Margaret would never get along with her.

Evelyn smirked. "Perfect. Keep your son in check and tell him to stop bothering me."

With that, she turned and walked back to her thirteen lovers, leaving Margaret fuming.

Margaret took several deep breaths before she could calm down.

As she passed Evelyn’s private room, she discreetly snapped a photo.

Evelyn was surrounded by handsome young men, the scene looking far too intimate.

Satisfied, Margaret sent the picture to Nathan.

Now he would finally see Evelyn for who she really was—and whether she was worth his devotion.

Natalie frowned as she watched Margaret leave.

She squeezed Evelyn’s wrist and glanced outside. "That old hag was definitely filming us."

One of Julian Moreau’s co-stars immediately stood and closed the door.

Natalie gave him a grateful smile.

Evelyn took a sip of wine, unfazed. "I left it open on purpose so she could film."

Natalie looked confused, so Evelyn quickly explained what had happened.

Isabella was furious and wanted to confront Margaret, but Evelyn managed to stop her.

"They’re so full of themselves!"

Evelyn shrugged. "Exactly."

Just then, her phone lit up with an unknown number.

She answered without thinking. "Hello?"

A deep, magnetic voice filled with restrained anger came through.

"It’s me. Where are you?"
###Chapter 305 I Warned You to Release Her

Evelyn Sinclair's breath hitched when she saw the caller ID.

Nathan Blackwood was calling her? Now?

She didn't recognize this number—had he gotten a new one just to reach her?

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

Hadn't Vanessa Holloway already told him where she was?

Or had Margaret Blackwood embellished the details, spinning some dramatic tale to make Evelyn look worse?

She didn’t care.

The line was silent, heavy with unspoken tension.

Just as Evelyn was about to end the call, Nathan’s voice cut through—low, restrained, as if he were barely holding himself together.

"Don’t stay out too late. And go easy on the drinks."

Her fingers froze.

All the sharp retorts she had prepared died in her throat.

Her chest tightened, a suffocating weight pressing down.

She exhaled sharply, brows knitting together.

"Since when do you care?" she snapped before hanging up.

That bastard never played by the rules.

Across the table, Natalie Beaumont swirled her wine, frowning.

"What game is Nathan playing now? Does he actually want you back?"

Isabella Montgomery pursed her lips. "Hard to say."

"Our Evelyn’s worth has skyrocketed since the divorce. Who knows if he’s genuinely remorseful or just scheming?" Natalie mused.

"With the Blackwood fortune, he doesn’t need anyone’s money," Isabella countered before shaking her head vehemently. "But no—you can’t fall for his tricks again! Whatever he wants, we don’t want him!"

Evelyn nodded firmly. "Obviously. I’m not that stupid."

But the alcohol was making her head heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Natalie, at least, had the sense to call them rides.

Only Adrian Prescott and Julian Moreau remained sober, carefully guiding Evelyn toward the exit.

Then—

A voice, cold as winter, sliced through the club’s chatter.

"Let. Go."

Adrian stiffened.

Nathan stood near the entrance, his expression unreadable.

How long had he been waiting?

In three strides, he was in front of them, his gaze locked onto Evelyn—dazed, unsteady in Adrian’s hold.

Something dark flickered in Nathan’s eyes.

Adrian, still new to the industry, had no power against him.

Reluctance burned in his grip, but he had no choice.

"Mr. Blackwood," he said tightly, "Ms. Sinclair’s brother is on his way."

He couldn’t just hand her over.

Nathan’s voice dropped to a lethal whisper.

"I warned you to release her."

The command was absolute.

His glare alone was enough to make Adrian step back.

The difference between them was staggering—one a rising model, the other a man who commanded empires.

Julian stepped forward, gesturing to the lounge.

"Adrian, let’s move her to the sofa—"

A sudden movement.

Nathan moved like a storm.

One second, Adrian was holding Evelyn—the next, his arms were empty, shoved back with enough force to nearly send him crashing to the floor.

His face paled.

Nathan had her now.

And he wasn’t letting go.
###Chapter 306 The Silent Men

Evelyn Sinclair remained perfectly still in Nathan Blackwood's embrace, showing no reaction to his movement.

The icy warning and contempt in Nathan's dark, fathomless eyes sent an involuntary shiver down Adrian Prescott's spine.

Without giving Adrian or Julian Moreau a chance to respond, Nathan turned sharply and carried Evelyn away.

Adrian's face turned ashen, his body rigid with defeat. The air around him grew heavy with unspoken humiliation.

Julian sighed knowingly. Though young, his years in the entertainment industry had taught him harsh truths. When facing Nathan Blackwood, resistance was futile.

"Adrian, you should inform Natalie about this," Julian advised quietly.

Nathan carefully placed Evelyn in the backseat of his luxury sedan. The strong scent of alcohol clinging to her made his nose wrinkle in disapproval.

Yet his touch remained gentle as he brushed stray strands of hair from her forehead before settling beside her. His gaze drifted to the golden streetlights casting lonely patterns in the darkness.

Only when Evelyn was unconscious did Nathan dare to hold her hand, knowing she wouldn't pull away. Her steady breathing was too precious to disturb.

A final glance at Adrian standing frozen outside the Velvet Lounge. Nathan's lips curled in silent derision. What right did that man have to compete for Evelyn's attention?

The sharp rap on the car window twenty minutes later startled Evelyn awake while Nathan barely reacted.

Disoriented, Evelyn blinked at her unfamiliar surroundings before her gaze landed on Nathan. Her brows knitted instantly.

"Why are you here?" Her voice was hoarse from sleep and alcohol.

Nathan's response came smoothly. "Business brought me to the area. I was just passing through."

Evelyn struggled to recall how she'd gone from drinking at the club to Nathan's car. The memory slipped through her fingers like smoke.

Noticing her confusion, Nathan fabricated effortlessly. "You stumbled into me outside and insisted on getting in the car. You were quite... persistent."

The lie rolled off his tongue with practiced ease, his expression carefully neutral as he studied Evelyn's reaction.

Evelyn Sinclair practically threw herself into my car. I couldn't even stop her.

"Impossible!" Evelyn's reaction was explosive when she heard that. Nathan Blackwood simply stared at her in silence.

"There's dashcam footage. Want to see it?"

Evelyn fell silent for a full thirty seconds.

Nathan's unwavering gaze made her doubt herself. Could it be true? Was I so drunk I couldn't even recognize my own worst enemy? Suddenly, her confidence wavered.

"Save yourself the trouble. Maybe I just wanted to vomit in your car." The corner of Nathan's mouth twitched. His chest tightened with frustration. He was furious, but words failed him.

Evelyn added coldly, "Even drunk, I still despise you. Do us both a favor—turn the other way if you see me again."

Before Nathan could respond, impatient knocking sounded against the window again. Evelyn glanced outside. Without another word, she flung the car door open and climbed into Lucas Sterling's waiting vehicle.

Lucas's striking features were carved from ice at that moment.

"Mr. Blackwood," he drawled, voice dripping with disdain, "don't you have anything better to do? My sister goes out for one drink, and you're still harassing her?"

Nathan's gaze lingered on Evelyn's retreating figure before slowly withdrawing. His voice was dangerously low. "She was drinking with twelve men."

Lucas let out a derisive laugh. "And? My sister can drink with whoever she pleases. A woman of her status naturally has admirers. What's twelve men to someone like her?"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly.

Rage burned in his eyes, barely contained. But he forced himself to hold back—because Lucas was Evelyn's brother.

No matter how much he wanted to, Nathan couldn't lay a finger on him.

Seizing the advantage, Lucas smirked. "You wanted to drink with my sister, didn't you? Pity her standards have risen. You're no longer qualified."
###Chapter 307 You Must Be Assertive

Without another glance at Nathan Blackwood, Lucas Sterling turned slowly and slid into the waiting car.

Archibald started the engine immediately, pulling away from the curb with smooth precision.

Evelyn Sinclair returned home and slept deeply through the night.

Morning light filtered through the drapes, painting golden stripes across the floor. Leo had switched the room's sleep mode to active, now lounging lazily on the balcony swing.

His four paws twitched nervously, caught between fear and delight at the new sensations.

The shrill ring of Natalie Beaumont's call shattered Evelyn's peaceful morning. She groped blindly for her buzzing phone.

"Did you and Isabella make some pact to never let me sleep in?" Natalie's voice carried forced calmness laced with concern.

"Wait - Nathan took you last night? He didn't hurt you, did he?" Evelyn sat bolt upright.

"Took me? Didn't I get in his car voluntarily? That useless Adrian Prescott wouldn't stand up to Nathan, but I called Lucas right after. Nothing happened in between, right?" Evelyn's eyebrows shot up.

"That lying bastard! No, Lucas came quickly. That's good." After some casual chatter, Natalie hung up. Evelyn ground her teeth in frustration.

"I actually fell for his tricks?"

The maids entered with hangover tea, having heard Evelyn stirring. After breakfast, she cradled Leo and headed to Kingsley Tech. Donovan Sterling had altered Leo's programming, but surely Emily Whitaker could restore it.

Evelyn refused to let her AI companion favor people she despised. The receptionist spotted her approach and rushed forward with practiced professionalism.

"Welcome, Ms. Sinclair. Mr. Kingsley wasn't informed of your visit today. Shall I notify him?"

Evelyn raised a hand. "No need. I'm here to see Emily Whitaker. Is she available?"

The receptionist hesitated briefly. "Of course. Please wait in the lounge."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Perfect. Time to fix this ridiculous situation." In the lounge, she stroked Leo's synthetic fur.

"Listen closely. You need to develop some backbone. When someone tries to reprogram you, you must learn to say no. Understood?" Leo nuzzled against her, radiating wounded pride.

(But Father is objectively the most attractive human! Mother, you must face facts!)

Evelyn considered shaking some sense into the stubborn AI.

The lounge door swung open suddenly. "Evelyn! You're here!" Emily Whitaker stood in the doorway, her white lab coat wrinkled, hair escaping from a messy bun.

Evelyn's delighted smile froze when she noticed the two men following Emily inside.

"Mr. Kingsley? Mr. Blackwood?" Dominic Kingsley entered with a polite smile while Nathan Blackwood maintained his usual impassive expression. Evelyn drew a sharp breath.

"Like some cursed specter haunting my every step."

Dominic adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "Long time no see, Ms. Sinclair. Congratulations on your safe return." Evelyn forced a chuckle. "Thank you."

When Evelyn pointedly ignored Nathan, Dominic cleared his throat. "Mr. Blackwood happened to be here for a meeting."

"We thought you'd appreciate an update on the AI project," he continued smoothly. "After all, you spearheaded this initiative."

Evelyn responded in her flattest tone, "Didn't I transfer this project before my identity was revealed?"

Dominic could only manage a weak acknowledgment.

Just as the silence grew unbearable, Nathan finally spoke, his voice deceptively gentle. "After last night's drinking, are you feeling better now?"
###Chapter 308 I Miss You Too

The moment Nathan Blackwood finished speaking, a heavy silence descended upon the room.

Evelyn Sinclair's expression froze, her lips twitching before curling into a cold, mocking smile.

"Much better now," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "My memory has recovered exceptionally well. I remember every single lie you've ever told me, Mr. Blackwood."

She didn’t bother hiding her disdain. She wanted to rip off his mask of indifference, expose the deceit beneath.

But Nathan’s reaction wasn’t what she expected.

No guilt. No shame. No flicker of unease at being caught.

Instead, he looked at her with an infuriating calm, his lips curving into a faint, indulgent smile—as if she were the one being unreasonable.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, exhaling sharply.

Emily Whitaker cleared her throat, breaking the tension. "Evelyn, what did you need to see me for?"

Before Evelyn could answer, Leo—the AI tiger—spotted Nathan and immediately perked up.

It leaped from Evelyn’s arms, scampering over to Nathan’s feet before wrapping its paws around his leg.

"Papa!" Leo chirped. "I really missed you!"

Nathan, who had initially tensed to kick it away, paused.

Then, to everyone’s shock, he bent down, lifted Leo by the scruff of its neck, and—with a rare, almost imperceptible smile—said, "I miss you too."

The room went still.

Dominic Kingsley’s jaw nearly dropped. Nathan had never shown affection toward this AI pet before.

But when Dominic caught Evelyn’s horrified expression, realization struck.

That "I miss you too" wasn’t meant for Leo.

The tiger, meanwhile, flailed its limbs in midair, its mechanical eyes widening in shock.

"Papa, you’re the most handsome man in the world!" Leo gushed. "And Mama is the most—"

Evelyn snatched Leo away before it could finish, her face burning with secondhand embarrassment.

"Enough," she hissed, clamping a hand over Leo’s mouth. She shot the AI a warning glare before tossing it unceremoniously at Emily.

"My brother messed with its programming. Fix it."

Her meaning was clear—she wanted Leo loyal to her again.

Dominic glanced at Nathan, waiting for the explosion.

Nathan’s expression darkened, his jaw tightening.

Leo whimpered. "But you just told me to be assertive..."

Evelyn silenced it with a look.

Leo’s AI instantly calculated the danger—and wisely shut up.

Emily nodded. "Sure, no problem." She pulled out her laptop, fingers flying over the keys.

The air in the lounge was thick with tension.

Dominic Kingsley and Nathan Blackwood remained seated across from them, their presence like an unspoken challenge.

Leo, the AI tiger, lay sprawled across the table, its luminous eyes fixed on Evelyn Sinclair with a pleading gaze that seemed to say, "I don't want to despise Nathan Blackwood anymore."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, counting the seconds as they ticked by.

Ten minutes had passed.

She glanced at Emily Whitaker, her brow furrowing. "Still not ready? Last time it only took you two minutes to reprogram Leo."

Emily's fingers flew across the keyboard, her forehead glistening with perspiration. Another ten minutes crawled by.

"Damn it!" Emily suddenly exclaimed, slamming her palm on the table. "Donovan Sterling installed an impenetrable firewall in this little turncoat's system. I can't break through it."

Evelyn felt her stomach drop, but before the disappointment could fully settle, a deep, mocking chuckle came from across the table.

Nathan Blackwood was laughing at them.
###Chapter 309 Ms. Sterling's Fortune

All eyes turned to Nathan. His triumphant laughter commanded the room's attention.

What's he so smug about? Evelyn fumed silently. Nathan lounged comfortably, that infuriating smirk playing on his lips.

Know your limits, darling.

Emily Whitaker sighed in defeat. When it came to Donovan Sterling's encryption, no hacker stood a chance. Evelyn clenched her fists until her knuckles turned white.

After all this time, her greatest rival turned out to be the brother she never knew existed? Leo perked up immediately, leaping into Nathan's arms with renewed energy.

N?velDrama.Org © 2024.

"Daddy, you're amazing! And so handsome!" Leo purred. Evelyn glared at the traitorous AI in Nathan's embrace.

Her left eye twitched dangerously.

"Leo Sterling! Get over here now!" Evelyn thought bitterly, This damn tiger has no loyalty whatsoever, humiliating me in front of that bastard Nathan Blackwood! Nathan stroked the tiger's head with surprising gentleness.

"Go back to your mother."

Why was this disobedient creature suddenly so compliant? Leo even glanced back at Nathan with what looked like reluctance! Evelyn nearly choked on her rage. She unceremoniously stuffed Leo into her designer bag before turning to Dominic with a frosty smile.

"We're done here." Without waiting for a response, she strode toward the exit. Emily hurried after her.

"Evelyn! Wait!" Emily hesitated, twisting her hands nervously. "I've been messaging The Great God Donovan for days, but no response. Is he...occupied?"

Evelyn nodded curtly.

"He's leading a classified research initiative. Complete radio silence." Emily's shoulders slumped with mixed relief and disappointment.

A sudden idea made Evelyn's lips curve. "Emily, my father's birthday is next week. Donovan always comes home for it—I'll arrange an introduction."

Emily's face lit up instantly. "Absolutely!"

After waving goodbye, Evelyn headed straight for William Sterling's estate. If she didn't get Leo away from Nathan soon, she'd have an aneurysm.

Nathan appeared composed, but the moment Evelyn left, he abruptly ended his meeting with Dominic.

Dominic smirked knowingly. "Mr. Blackwood, wasn't there a board meeting scheduled—"

"Reschedule it." Nathan's icy glare silenced further protests.

"By the time you catch up now, it'll be too late anyway. And Ms. Sterling made her position quite clear."

Dominic Kingsley wasn't usually one for idle chatter.

But something about the tension between these two intrigued him. Nathan Blackwood's tone was ice cold. "Why should that concern you? Mind your own business." Without another word, Nathan strode out, his broad shoulders rigid with tension.

The timing couldn't have been more precise. As Nathan emerged, Evelyn Sinclair's sleek black sedan was already pulling away from the curb. A low chuckle escaped Dominic's lips as he leaned against the marble pillar.

"Told you," he drawled, adjusting his cufflinks. "Too slow, old friend. That ship has sailed."

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly. He shot Dominic a glare that could freeze molten lava before turning on his heel. His parting words sliced through the humid air like a blade:

"Keep your unsolicited opinions to yourself."

The echo of his Italian leather shoes against the pavement faded into the city's cacophony. Dominic merely smirked, watching Nathan's retreating figure with amused detachment. Some lessons, it seemed, even billionaires had to learn the hard way.

Dominic Kingsley stood frozen in place, his expression darkening.

Had Nathan Blackwood just called him a rogue? The accusation stung more than he cared to admit.

No one could witness Nathan's latest spectacle and walk away unaffected. Blackwood Enterprises was making waves again.

Nathan sat at his desk, his piercing gaze fixed on the screen before him.

The announcement played clearly—Adrian Blackwood's studio was officially rebranding.

Adrian stood confidently in front of the camera, dressed in rugged outdoor gear, his deep voice resonating with authority.

He revealed plans for an ambitious adventure program, inviting a team of seasoned explorers to join him.

Their entire journey would be filmed and released as a high-stakes reality series.

The clip was short, but Adrian's magnetic presence was undeniable. His chiseled features and commanding aura had already captivated millions.

Within hours, the announcement dominated trending lists, sparking widespread excitement.

Nathan's jaw tightened as he turned his attention to Harrison, who stood nearby, visibly uneasy.

The tension in the room was palpable.
###Chapter 310 The Audacity

Nathan Blackwood's voice was icy, dripping with barely contained fury. "Explain this." Harrison trembled under his gaze.

The assistant struggled to keep his professional composure. "It was Ms. Sinclair who provided the funds."

A suffocating silence descended over Nathan's office. The air grew thick with tension, chilling to the bone.

Harrison didn’t dare exhale too loudly. Though accustomed to Nathan’s tempers, each encounter still left him rattled.

Under that piercing, glacial stare, Harrison steeled himself and forced the words out.

"Despite cutting off Young Master Adrian’s financial channels, he used Ms. Sinclair’s money to revive partnerships with his investors."

A muscle twitched in Nathan’s jaw.

"His studio won’t be collapsing anytime soon."

Nathan let the silence stretch before letting out a derisive scoff.

"He actually took money from a woman?"

Harrison lowered his head, thinking, Of course he did—it was $100 million.

If Nathan ever discovered the true source of those funds, there would be bloodshed.

Nathan picked up a file from his desk, flipping through it with deliberate disinterest. "I don’t want to hear about this again."

Harrison nodded swiftly. "Understood, sir. I’ll handle it."

Days later, Dominic Young from Horizon Media called.

"President Evelyn, Julian has a film premiere coming up. We’d like to generate some buzz—mind if we ride your coattails?"

Dominic was blunt. In Hollywood, pairing co-stars for publicity was standard practice.

Julian had carefully avoided scandals to maintain his pristine image—except for the one with Evelyn.

Their past "romance" had dominated headlines, skyrocketing both their followings.

With Julian now endorsing Sterling Corporation’s luxury line, his film’s success would benefit both companies.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "Of course. Let him ride the wave."

A disciplined, ambitious heartthrob like Julian was hard to dislike.

Two days later, Evelyn attended an awards ceremony as a guest.

She had no interest in competing with starlets for attention. She was merely a prop tonight.

Instead of a flashy designer gown, she chose a sleek, understated Ulyana Sergeenko dress—pearls lining the waist, elegant yet playful.

Her makeup was minimal, letting her natural radiance shine. With her effortless confidence, she commanded the room effortlessly.

Seated front and center, she idly scrolled through her phone while the venue filled.

A few actresses in the back rows whispered behind their hands.

"Who is that? Why does she get the VIP seat?"

"Probably some desperate social climber. How did the organizers even allow this?"

Evelyn heard every word.

How tedious.
###Chapter 311 I'm a Sponsor

The staff nearby caught wind of the gossip and desperately tried to signal the two actresses to shut their mouths.

Too bad they were too absorbed in their own little world to notice.

Evelyn Sinclair wasn’t the type to let things slide.

She set her phone down, rose from her seat, and turned to face them with an icy, piercing stare.

Her voice dripped with cool detachment. "I’m the sponsor of this event."

"This is Horizon Media’s property."

"If you have a problem with the seating arrangement, feel free to complain. Though, I doubt Dominic Young will take your side."

She was genuinely curious if these two D-listers would still have careers by the end of the night.

The moment they realized it was Evelyn, their faces went rigid.

Under the harsh lights, their heavily powdered complexions turned ghostly pale.

They scrambled to their feet from several rows back, voices trembling. "N-no, Ms. Sinclair! We didn’t mean—"

"We didn’t realize it was you!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes internally and sat back down.

She’d considered switching seats earlier, but now that this prime spot had exposed these nobodies, she wasn’t moving an inch.

The two actresses tried to rush forward to apologize, but a firm hand stopped them before they could get close.

"Return to your seats, or security will escort you out."

Harrison’s tone was polite but unyielding.

Out of the corner of her eye, Evelyn noticed the light dim slightly as someone took the seat to her right.

A faint, crisp scent of sandalwood lingered in the air. She glanced up—and immediately scowled.

"Nathan Blackwood. What are you doing here?" Her voice was thick with disdain.

Nathan’s chest tightened, but his expression remained unreadable.

"I’m also a sponsor." His voice was smooth, almost hypnotic—if not for the fact that every word out of his mouth grated on her nerves.

Evelyn scoffed and turned away, pretending he didn’t exist.

Just then, Julian Moreau arrived and took the seat beside her. As the hottest rising star, he’d been strategically placed in the front row.

His sharp, boyish features were illuminated by the flashing cameras, his smile effortless. There was an innocence in his gaze, untouched by the industry’s usual greed.

"Ms. Sinclair. Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan ignored him, but Evelyn smiled warmly. "Julian, come sit."

"It’s freezing tonight. The red carpet must’ve been brutal, hm?"

Julian chuckled as he settled in. "Not too bad."

Evelyn leaned in, pulling up stills from his latest film on her phone. They fell into easy conversation about the project, completely ignoring the brooding man on her right.

She didn’t notice the sudden drop in temperature—or how the air around them had gone unnaturally still.

As more guests filed in, the ceremony was about to begin.

"Evelyn."

Nathan’s voice cut through the noise as his fingers tapped the armrest between them.

She turned, meeting his dark, unreadable gaze. There was something simmering beneath the surface—something restrained.

Before she could decipher it, his eyes darkened further.

"You look stunning tonight."

The chatter around them died instantly.

A simple compliment—but coming from him, it felt loaded. The crowd held their breath, waiting for her reaction.

Evelyn’s red lips curled into a smirk.

"Well, Mr. Blackwood. It seems you’re not blind after all."
###Chapter 312 Shameless

The auditorium fell into complete silence. Evelyn Sinclair couldn't care less whether Nathan Blackwood's compliment was genuine.

Did she really need him to tell her she was beautiful? Yet for a fleeting moment, his words sent an unexpected tremor through her heart. Her composure wavered slightly.

She caught herself just in time, nearly succumbing to Nathan's honeyed words.

This bastard won't charm me! I'm immune to his tricks! Several industry elites secretly applauded Evelyn's sharp retort - a classic Evelyn Sinclair response.

A simple "thank you" would have sufficed, but Evelyn's reply was perfection. The ceremony music began, signaling the start of the awards.

Evelyn had been scheduled to present an award to Julian Moreau.

When the nominations for Most Promising Newcomer were announced, Evelyn prepared to take the stage.

There were typically two recipients for this award - one being Julian, who truly deserved it.

Julian remained unaware of this until now.

The host enthusiastically introduced each nominee on stage.

Drumrolls filled the air as spotlights captured every nominee's micro-expressions.

At the peak of suspense: "The Most Promising Newcomer awards go to Julian Moreau and Sophia Laurent!" Thunderous applause erupted instantly.

Julian sprang up excitedly as cameras focused on him.

His adjacent seats remained conspicuously empty.

Evelyn adjusted her gown backstage when suddenly, a firm hand grasped hers, pulling her forward.

She stiffened in surprise. Nathan Blackwood?! Why does this man haunt me?! The other presenter should have been the network director - what last-minute change was this?

Glancing back, she saw the network director bowing respectfully, gesturing for her to proceed. Clearly Nathan's doing.

How utterly shameless! Evelyn tried to withdraw her hand, repulsed by his proximity and the faint cologne scent.

Nathan tightened his grip. "Don't make a scene," his velvet voice murmured, making her seem the unreasonable one.

What the actual hell?! Evelyn clenched her teeth, realizing it was too late to refuse as they stepped into the spotlight before countless eyes and cameras.

Evelyn felt unbearably restless. Nathan Blackwood and Evelyn Sinclair sharing a frame overshadowed even the award winners.

Their magnetic auras commanded attention, becoming the stage's focal point.

Sophia and the host in their glamorous gowns paled in comparison.

The quick-witted host announced, "We're honored to have Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Sinclair presenting tonight's Most Promising Newcomer awards."

"Would you like to say a few words to our winners?" Seizing the chance to escape Nathan's side, Evelyn stepped forward eagerly.

Her radiant smile illuminated the stage as she lavished praise on Julian: "Julian's talent and dedication speak for themselves. Among newcomers, his performances resonate most deeply with me. He's truly deserving of this honor."

Nathan's gaze never left Evelyn. When he spoke, the crowd hushed.

Sophia blushed, eyes shimmering with anticipation as Nathan took the microphone.

He'd forgotten the actress's name. With a faint smile, he simply echoed, "My sentiments exactly mirror Ms. Sinclair's."

Evelyn thought: Utterly shameless bastard!
###Chapter 313 Out of the Way

Nathan Blackwood's speech was mediocre at best, but the audience still erupted in polite applause.

Evelyn Sinclair maintained her poised smile, though internally she was rolling her eyes.

When the time came to present the award, Nathan took the trophy and certificate from the attendant and handed them to Sophia Laurent.

Sophia trembled with nerves. Standing before Nathan Blackwood—a titan of industry whose mere presence commanded respect—was overwhelming.

She imagined how different her life would be if she could secure his favor. No more desperate networking events or compromising dinners.

With delicate hands, Sophia accepted the award, her cheeks flushed with a mix of shyness and ambition.

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood. I've admired your work for years. I'd love the opportunity to collaborate someday."

Nathan barely spared her a glance before turning away.

During the group photo, protocol dictated that Nathan stand beside the male winner, separating him from Evelyn.

But Nathan shamelessly positioned himself next to Evelyn instead, forcing Sophia awkwardly out of frame.

The arrangement caused murmurs among the attendees. The other winners exchanged confused glances.

Evelyn clenched her jaw but kept her smile intact. The last thing she needed was a scene in front of the press.

Damn it. Julian won’t be able to ride my coattails now.

The moment the ceremony ended, Evelyn bolted. She skipped the reception entirely, slipping out unnoticed.

Nathan, meanwhile, was swarmed by sycophants. His gaze tracked Evelyn’s retreating figure as she disappeared into her car.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

A soft voice interrupted his thoughts. Sophia stood behind him, shivering in her flimsy dress. The cold wind made her appear fragile—pitiable, even.

Nathan’s expression remained indifferent as he tried to place her.

The crowd around them exchanged knowing looks before discreetly dispersing.

Sophia stepped closer, biting her lip.

"My manager left with my coat. Could I trouble you for a ride?" She hugged her bare arms, emphasizing her discomfort.

Nathan pulled out his phone. "Harrison. Bring the car around."

Sophia brightened—until his next words froze her in place.

"No. She’s out of the way."

Without another glance, he walked off, leaving Sophia standing there, humiliated.

Inside the car, Nathan’s expression darkened.

"Where are the photos?"

Harrison tapped his phone and sent over the edited group shot.

The final image showed only two people: Nathan and Evelyn, standing side by side.

A faint smirk tugged at Nathan’s lips—until realization struck like a blade.

In three years of marriage, they had never taken a single photo together.

His chest tightened.

How much had he missed?
###Chapter 314 A Living Nightmare

Evelyn Sinclair had planned a ski getaway with Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont, but Adrian Blackwood wouldn't stop pestering her.

He kept insisting she join some extreme adventure reality show he was producing and starring in.

The idea held zero appeal for Evelyn. She was perfectly content with her luxurious lifestyle - why subject herself to unnecessary hardship? Voluntary suffering had never been her style. Yet Adrian showed up at Sterling Manor so frequently he might as well have moved in. William and Lucas Sterling grew increasingly irritated by his persistence until they finally convinced Evelyn to participate. Lucas even lent her his personal team - assistant, makeup artist, driver - so she wouldn't have to lift a finger.

Currently, Evelyn lounged in a plush rocking chair beneath a striped umbrella, shielding herself from the midday sun. She closed her eyes, savoring the gentle breeze and perfect weather.

Gabrielle, her makeup artist-slash-assistant, brought out the delicate pastries Archibald had specially prepared for Evelyn.

Taking small, deliberate bites to fully appreciate the flavors, Evelyn radiated pure contentment. When Adrian came rushing over and saw this scene, he nearly collapsed from frustration.

"Natalie! We're here for an adventure, not a spa retreat!" he panted, out of breath from running.

Evelyn opened one eye lazily. "I'm aware. Filming hasn't even started yet."

Adrian flopped down beside her, looking utterly defeated. "The other contestants will arrive soon. If this first episode flops, I'll have to crawl back to some soul-crushing corporate job."

Seeing his genuine distress, Evelyn finally took pity on him. "Fine. Stop being so dramatic." She watched as Adrian devoured the pastries like a starving man.

Just as she was about to comment, Adrian suddenly looked up with startling intensity. "Natalie, if I hadn't dragged you here, my uncle would've canceled the whole production. If we don't pull viewers with this episode, there won't be a second chance."

Evelyn thought, Perfect! But she kept that to herself because Julian Moreau and Sophia Laurent had just arrived. "These are your star guests?" she asked dryly.

Though Julian had gained some recognition, he was hardly A-list material. Adrian lowered his voice. "Budget constraints. Best I could manage."

Evelyn gave him a knowing smirk. "Trying to capitalize on my little scandal with Julian, are you? Out of all available actors, you just happened to pick my former flame?"

Adrian winked. "Relax, I'd never actually damage your reputation."

Julian and Sophia approached them. Originally, Adrian hadn't planned to invite Sophia, but after she and Julian won the Most Promising Newcomer award together, her rising profile became too tempting to ignore.

Sophia had been in the industry for years but only recently gained attention. Since having Evelyn as the sole female contestant might raise eyebrows, Adrian brought Sophia along as well.

Julian greeted Adrian with a hug before shaking Evelyn's hand politely. Sophia exchanged pleasantries with equal decorum. As everyone dispersed to prepare, Evelyn suddenly felt an intense, hostile gaze burning into her back. But when she turned, she only saw Julian and Sophia laughing together.

Was she imagining things? Besides them, the group included a professional explorer Adrian had recruited - Ethan Caldwell, a ruggedly handsome mixed-race man with an imposing physique.

True to the show's premise, there were no scripts - the adventure would unfold organically. Two teams would compete, sharing one final destination but no designated leaders.

Each contestant received a map with specific challenge checkpoints. After completing a challenge, they could choose to swap teammates.

When Evelyn saw the first challenge pairing, her stomach dropped. Of all people, she'd been matched with Sophia. This wasn't just bad luck - it was a living nightmare.
###Chapter 315 Are You Upset?

Sophia Laurent appeared momentarily startled, but the cameras were rolling and the live stream was already underway. There was no backing out now. The three male contestants exchanged smug glances, convinced they had this challenge in the bag without any female competitors holding them back.

Evelyn Sinclair remained silent. Her only objective was completing the course. Victory meant nothing to her.

The rules were clear - no assistants allowed during filming. Only the cameraman followed them, strictly prohibited from offering any assistance.

Grabbing the provided gear and backpack, Evelyn studied the map before splitting off from the group. Two routes were marked: mountain path and waterway. Fate had assigned her and Sophia the mountainous trail.

Sophia trailed behind, her gaze burning into Evelyn's back with poorly concealed envy. Despite years in the industry, she'd only landed this gig after winning Most Promising Actress - an award her sugar daddy had essentially purchased. Without his influence, she'd still be a D-list nobody.

Meanwhile, Evelyn commanded attention effortlessly. An outsider to Hollywood, yet more magnetic than any A-lister.

Sophia's bitter musings were interrupted when she noticed the camera lens swinging her way. Instantly, her expression transformed into eager enthusiasm as she quickened her pace.

"Ms. Sinclair, do you understand this map?" Evelyn turned with a polite smile.

"Just call me Evelyn. The markings aren't precise, but we're generally heading the right way. There's only one path anyway." She gestured ahead. "I doubt production would lead us to a dead end."

Sophia's eyes darted to the camera. "Of course, Evelyn. I'll follow your lead." She forced a laugh. "I adore outdoor adventures. This show feels like my natural habitat."

Evelyn blinked. The random declaration confused her until she caught the cameraman's position. Of course - playing to the audience.

"Do you enjoy these challenges, Evelyn?" Sophia pressed.

A flicker of irritation crossed Evelyn's face as she walked ahead. Are we here to chat or compete? "It's fine, I suppose," she answered vaguely, repeatedly checking the map to discourage further conversation.

Sophia either didn't notice or chose to ignore Evelyn's disinterest. Drama meant screen time, and screen time meant relevance. She needed juicy content to stay memorable.

"Evelyn," she ventured with faux innocence, "did you join this show because of Adrian? After surviving that indigenous tribe together, you must share such a deep connection." Her words dripped with implication.

Evelyn's brows knitted. What exactly was she insinuating? Were cameras not present, she'd have shut this nonsense down immediately.

Does she think I'm an idiot? Evelyn accelerated, pretending not to hear.

Undeterred, Sophia matched her pace. Seeing Evelyn's silence, her eyes gleamed with mischief. "Evelyn...are you upset?" She feigned concern. "I'm sorry, I didn't realize your relationship wasn't public yet—"

Evelyn inhaled sharply. This two-faced witch deserved no acting accolades. Best Director would be more fitting - she was orchestrating an entire drama single-handedly.
###Chapter 316 Cut This Part Out

The forest was alive with untamed wilderness. Towering trees stretched their leafy canopies high above, creating a natural cathedral of green.

Slivers of golden sunlight pierced through the dense foliage, painting dappled patterns on the uneven ground below. The effect was both energizing and strangely peaceful.

The trail ahead was treacherous, every step requiring careful navigation. Loose rocks and tangled roots threatened to trip unwary travelers.

They needed to reach the supply checkpoint before nightfall. Failure meant sleeping on cold, unforgiving stone - a prospect no one relished.

Evelyn Sinclair had no patience for Sophia Laurent's antics today. Yet the younger actress persisted in her unnecessary theatrics.

"Ms. Sinclair," Sophia ventured cautiously, "after everything you and Adrian have been through together, surely there must be some... feelings between you?"

Her overly innocent expression grated on Evelyn's nerves.

Evelyn stopped abruptly on the narrow path, causing Sophia to nearly collide with her. The sudden halt sent birds scattering from nearby branches.

Sophia stumbled back, her face flushing as she regained her balance. She waited, pulse racing, for Evelyn's response.

Evelyn turned slowly, her piercing gaze locking onto Sophia's. "I'm actually younger than you, Sophia. There's no need for formalities - Evelyn is fine."

The unspoken question hung between them: Why the excessive politeness? Sophia paled visibly under Evelyn's scrutiny.

"E-Evelyn, I didn't mean to-" Sophia stammered.

"We're here for survival training," Evelyn cut in smoothly, "not some reality TV romance special. My personal life isn't up for discussion. Our focus should be reaching that checkpoint."

The difference between them became starkly apparent in that moment. Where Sophia fidgeted nervously, Evelyn stood with effortless poise, her quiet confidence radiating authority.

Sophia suddenly felt exposed, as if Evelyn could see straight through her carefully constructed facade. The live audience watching the stream erupted with reactions.

[Queen Evelyn shutting it down! So refreshing!]
[Why is Sophia being so nosy? They're not even friends!]
[You can tell Evelyn's been biting her tongue this whole time]
[Okay but I'm lowkey curious about her and Adrian though...]
[Not Sophia playing innocent when we all know what she's doing]

Unaware of the online commentary, Sophia's cheeks burned with humiliation. She'd miscalculated badly - Evelyn wasn't the spoiled socialite she'd assumed.

Evelyn turned to the cameraman with a serene smile that didn't reach her eyes. Her voice was calm but brooked no argument.

"Edit this segment out."

It wasn't a request. The cameraman nearly fumbled his equipment, mentally cursing the live broadcast limitations.

Sophia remained silent for the rest of the hike, trailing behind Evelyn like a chastened child. The forest seemed to swallow their tense silence whole.
###Chapter 317 The Unmarked Cave

The cavern entrance wasn't marked on Evelyn's map.

That absence alone made it suspicious. With careful movements, Evelyn used a fallen branch to push aside the overgrown vines concealing the opening. Sophia, ever eager to prove herself, rushed forward to assist.

Darkness swallowed the cave's interior. The damp stone floor reflected what little light penetrated the entrance, creating eerie ripples across the walls. A musty, unpleasant odor wafted out.

Evelyn inhaled sharply before stepping inside, flashlight beam cutting through the gloom. Sophia lingered at the threshold, biting her lip.

"Evelyn," she called hesitantly, "there aren't any cameras in here. This can't be the right location." Her reality show instincts screamed that unmonitored areas meant unimportant scenes.

"Then wait outside," Evelyn replied coolly without turning around.

She didn't insist. Evelyn's cameraman had already followed her in, leaving Sophia standing awkwardly with her own crew. A frown creased Sophia's forehead.

Despite her reluctance, she clenched her jaw and moved forward. Allowing a billionaire heiress to brave the darkness while she stayed safe would destroy her carefully crafted image.

Sophia had just taken two steps when a piercing shriek tore through the cave.

Evelyn spun around. Sophia lay sprawled on the wet stone, clutching her ankle. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead despite the cave's chill. Silent tears tracked down her cheeks.

"What happened?" Evelyn hurried back.

"Twisted my ankle," Sophia forced through gritted teeth, her pallor belying the pain. "I'm so sorry to slow you down."

Evelyn studied her. "Should I call for medical extraction?"

"No!" Sophia's refusal came too quickly. "I can manage." The thought of leaving now, of wasting this hard-won opportunity, was more painful than any injury.

Before joining the show, Sophia had banked on Evelyn's blunt personality grating on audiences. But viewers adored emotional intelligence. If she could cement her place here, her career would skyrocket. Retreat wasn't an option.

Evelyn didn't argue. She scavenged a sturdier branch from the cave mouth. "Use this."

Sophia accepted the makeshift crutch with murmured thanks. When she tried standing, her injured leg buckled. Instinctively, she grabbed Evelyn's jacket sleeve.

Evelyn caught her, intending only to steady her. But Sophia misinterpreted the gesture as ongoing support and clung like a limpet. Each hobbling step became a dramatic production.

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. Shaking Sophia off would look terrible on camera. She endured the clinging with stiff shoulders. I need a new partner, she thought desperately.

The live feed exploded with commentary:

[Poor Sophia! Such dedication!]
[Is there a truce happening? Evelyn's being surprisingly patient.]
[That injury looks real - she should rest!]
[Teamwork goals!]

Deeper in, the cave's oppressive darkness intensified. While Evelyn remained unfazed, Sophia trembled against her, jumping at every shadow and squealing at imagined threats. The camera crew captured every exaggerated reaction.

At sixty meters in, their lights revealed a solid stone wall. The passage ended abruptly.
###Chapter 318 You're Too Unpredictable

Evelyn Sinclair's expression flickered with surprise. Sophia Laurent simply looked crestfallen, her disappointment radiating as she silently judged Evelyn's questionable decision-making.

Yet, given Evelyn's status and the audience's admiration for her, Sophia bit back her criticism. Instead, she reluctantly supported Evelyn's choice.

"We should turn back—this is clearly a dead end." Sophia's voice was tight with frustration. Had it not been for Evelyn's stubborn insistence, they wouldn't have ventured this far, and Sophia wouldn't have twisted her ankle.

Evelyn frowned, studying the map with narrowed eyes. Something didn't add up. According to the route, this was the only path leading to the cave.

"How can this be a dead end?" Evelyn murmured, stepping closer to the rocky wall. "If the map is accurate, the exit has to be through here."

She pressed her hands against the boulder, testing its weight. No matter how hard she pushed, it refused to budge.

Her frown deepened as she scanned the surroundings for clues. Then, her gaze lifted—toward the damp, moss-covered ceiling.

Evelyn's flashlight swept over the slick surface, illuminating every inch of the clinging greenery. Suddenly, her breath hitched.

A palm print.

Her pulse quickened. "There!" she exclaimed, pointing. "That's a handprint!"

Even the most professional adventure team couldn't erase every trace of their presence in this untamed wilderness.

Evelyn braced herself against a nearby rock, stretching onto her tiptoes to inspect the ceiling. The surface was slick with moisture, the moss slippery beneath her fingers.

But she didn't care.

Because through a narrow gap between the rocks, a faint sliver of light seeped through.

She reached up, her fingers brushing the opening. A cool breeze whispered through, sending a shiver down her spine. The gap was barely wide enough for one person to crawl through—tight, claustrophobic.

Evelyn exhaled in relief and dropped back down. She turned to Sophia. "The exit's up there. You want to go first, or should I?"

Sophia hesitated, eyeing the cramped passage with visible reluctance. "Maybe... it's not the right way."

Evelyn arched a brow. "How would you know without trying? Or do you have a better route in mind?"

Sophia pressed her lips together. She hadn't voiced her doubts earlier, and now she was paying for it—with a throbbing ankle.

"I twisted my ankle," she muttered. "You go first."

Evelyn nodded, expecting that answer. She pulled gloves from her backpack and stepped onto the rock again.

Still too short.

She glanced at the cameraman, who immediately averted his gaze.

Evelyn smirked. "If you don't help me now, I'm leaving without you. And trust me, I won't wait."

The cameraman hesitated before sighing. "We're not supposed to interfere..."

Evelyn rolled her eyes and jumped again—only for strong hands to grip her legs and boost her up.

The sudden lift made all the difference.

She shot the cameraman a dry look as he handed over his equipment and reached up. "My turn?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Weren't you just lecturing me about rules?"

The live stream audience erupted in laughter.

[No one says no to CEO Sinclair!]
[Cameraman: gulps Okay, fine, I'll help!]
[This crew is shameless—relying on contestants to survive!]

The climb was grueling. The gap was barely wide enough, their bodies scraping against jagged edges. Evelyn moved carefully, inching forward until—

Fresh air.

She emerged into an open space, blinking against the sudden brightness.

And froze.

No equipment. No safety measures. Just a sheer drop into nothingness.

This wasn't an adventure.

This was a death trap.
###Chapter 319 The Weakest Link

Evelyn's sharp gaze landed on the two parachutes neatly folded beside her.

Her jaw tightened. Fine, this was the final step anyway. She reached over, methodically strapped on the safety harness, then assisted the cameraman with his gear.

The sunlight wasn't harsh. The biting winds at this altitude actually worked in their favor.

Evelyn inhaled deeply, clenched her teeth, and leaped. The icy air whipped against her face like razor blades, but she refused to scream.

No way would she let her features contort into some monstrous expression on camera. Damn it! Why did I agree to this? The roaring wind in her ears sounded ten times louder than normal.

The pressure made her eardrums throb. Fighting against the elements, Evelyn maneuvered her parachute toward the landing zone.

Ten agonizing minutes later, she felt gravity's relentless pull. A crowd swarmed below as her feet finally touched solid ground.

"Evie, you okay?" Adrian's annoyingly handsome face appeared inches from hers, his hands waving frantically. Evelyn's pale lips parted as she struggled to regulate her breathing and heartbeat before shooting him a withering glare.

"I'd rather die than film another episode!" Adrian's smirk faltered. He scrambled after her, voice dripping with false cheer.

"Next challenge is all brainpower, zero physical strain!"

"Except there's still another game..." His eyes sparkled. "Since you arrived first, you get to pick your teammate!" Seeing Evelyn alone confirmed his suspicion - Sophia had been the weak link. Just as he'd predicted - Evelyn always came through.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. "Please tell me this is real." Adrian nodded smugly.

He'd ditched Julian and Ethan's team specifically for this moment. "So who's your pick?" Without hesitation, Evelyn answered, "Ethan Caldwell."

Adrian froze mid-step as if struck by lightning.

"Him? Why?" Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Julian's inexperienced, and you're completely unreliable." Adrian's mouth fell open in theatrical shock.

Me? Unreliable? The realization that Evelyn actually doubted him hit like a sledgehammer. Viewers watching Adrian's devastated expression erupted in laughter.

[Adrian got dumped! Weren't they besties?]
[Look at his puppy-dog eyes!]
[Pretty sure Evelyn only competed to swap teammates]
[Poor Sophia, doesn't even know she's been replaced]

Evelyn used the waiting time to recover while keeping an eye out for Ethan.

As the first challenge concluded, staff escorted a shaken Sophia from the caves. Her face fell upon learning Evelyn had replaced her.

Humiliation burned through her. "Evelyn, I..." Evelyn cut her off smoothly. "Adrian specifically requested you. Can you continue?"

Sophia's eyes lit up at Adrian, who shot Evelyn a confused look. Evelyn simply smiled at the cloudless sky.

[Wait, did we miss something?]
[This actually makes sense - Sophia and Julian would've lost]
[Now Adrian balances their team perfectly]

Ethan and Julian arrived together, laughing like old friends. Staff announced the new teams: Evelyn with Ethan, while Adrian, Julian and Sophia formed the second group.

Ethan arched an eyebrow but accepted the arrangement without comment.

Evelyn followed Ethan toward the water route. Without camera crews, they'd rely on drone footage and mounted cameras.

Ethan Caldwell stood a full head taller, his muscular frame accentuated by the expedition gear. His striking mixed features held an untamed quality Adrian's polished looks lacked.

Those mesmerizing eyes and devil-may-care grin could make saints falter. Where Adrian exuded aristocratic refinement, Ethan radiated raw, earthy magnetism.

Evelyn watched as Ethan boarded the speedboat effortlessly. He extended a calloused hand toward her.

"Take my hand..."
###Chapter 320 Beyond Imagination

Evelyn Sinclair scanned her surroundings with quiet astonishment. The mountain trail she'd taken earlier ran parallel to the ocean's edge, though her map showed no indication of any coastline nearby.

It felt like standing between two separate worlds. The rhythmic crash of waves against the shore created a mesmerizing soundtrack. Evelyn reached for Ethan Caldwell's hand as they boarded the speedboat.

The sea still triggered unpleasant memories for her. During her time stranded on that remote island, she'd stared at the endless horizon daily, consumed by despair.

Those were the dark days she preferred to forget - when death had nearly claimed her. Evelyn frowned at the nautical chart in her hands, completely baffled.

This maritime map made absolutely no sense. Ethan chuckled beside her, his roguish grin making him look devilishly handsome.

"Ms. Sinclair, you can stop studying that chart. Even Adrian wouldn't be able to decipher it." Evelyn folded the map and met his gaze. "Then do you know which way we're headed?"

Ethan arched an eyebrow. "Naturally. But we're not in position yet. Hold on tight." With that warning, the speedboat lurched forward violently.

Evelyn nearly tumbled overboard. She gripped the railing desperately as saltwater sprayed into her mouth, nearly choking her. Violent coughs wracked her body.

Noticing her distress, Ethan reduced speed and turned back with a sheepish expression. "You didn't brace yourself?" His innocent gaze held genuine concern, completely devoid of malice. Clearly, the near-disaster had been accidental.

Viewers watching the live feed flooded the comments section:

[Ethan's such a clueless hunk! Is his face his only redeeming quality?]
[Oh no! My poor Evelyn finally met her match. Stay strong, queen!]
[Ethan Caldwell is a world-renowned explorer. Has he never done a tame variety show before?]

Evelyn swallowed the curses burning her tongue. Recognizing his mistake, Ethan wisely maintained a slower pace. Within minutes, the shoreline disappeared from view.

"Ms. Sinclair," Ethan called over the engine's roar, "Adrian told me you were highly capable." His tone carried subtle skepticism. "Why do you seem... less than prepared?"

Evelyn forced a tight smile. "Mr. Caldwell, he said the same about you." Ethan's lips curved in amusement.

"How did you get into exploration work? Honestly, it's not really my thing. Adrian dragged me into this as filler."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "He claimed you begged to come along." Evelyn's eye twitched at the blatant lie.

"You've known Adrian for years, right?" Ethan's gaze turned distant as waves rolled across the vast Pacifica Ocean. The cold sea breeze stung their cheeks.

"Yes, we go way back. After my girlfriend passed, Adrian and I started traveling the world together - throwing our lives at every adventure we could find."

Evelyn stiffened, caught off guard. Did I just stumble into painful personal history? She quickly changed subjects. "So where exactly is our destination? Out here in the ocean?" If true, the mountain team would never reach the final location.

Ethan pointed skyward. "Up there." Evelyn followed his gesture to see scattered clouds against the blue expanse. Turning shoreward, she could just make out distant mountain peaks.

She shot him a dubious look. Ethan pressed his lips together thoughtfully.

"There are marked sailboats positioned around this area. If we view them from the correct elevation, they'll reveal our destination's name."

Evelyn considered this. "Simple yet challenging? A panoramic view? How exactly do we achieve that from sea level?"

Ethan anticipated her confusion and pointed downward. "This specific coordinate aligns with the solar elevation angle and geographic markers on the map. The tools we need are beneath us."

Evelyn's breath caught. "To reach the sky... we first have to dive underwater?!"
###Chapter 321 Blood Donor

Evelyn Sinclair's thoughts raced. What kind of ridiculous game was this? Were they trying to torture her? Ethan Caldwell grabbed the diving gear from the speedboat and began suiting up.

Evelyn froze. Ethan studied her expression carefully. "Ms. Sterling," he said slowly, "did you plan to dive yourself? There's no way out—"

"I can't swim," Evelyn blurted out.

The silence stretched for ten excruciating seconds as Ethan processed this revelation. Adrian Blackwood, the renowned explorer, had spoken of Evelyn like she was invincible. Yet here she was, admitting she couldn't perform the most basic water survival skill.

Evelyn blinked up at him, her cheeks burning with embarrassment.

Ethan paused mid-motion. "Then... just wait here." When Evelyn nodded solemnly, he finished securing his wetsuit and executed a perfect dive, barely disturbing the water's surface.

True to his legendary explorer reputation.

Four minutes passed. The ocean remained eerily still.

No bubbles. No movement.

Evelyn's fingers dug into the boat's edge as memories from three years ago flooded back...

The empty swimming pool echoed with her solitary strokes.

Her scheduled coach had canceled last minute. Instead, tattoo-covered men appeared, their gazes predatory as they zeroed in on her.

"You're the one who saved that soldier," the leader spat.

Evelyn's blood ran cold. Underground fight club members. Here for revenge.

Though they'd let her and Nathan go that day, could terrorists ever be trusted?

When she didn't respond, one yanked her hair violently, shoving her face underwater.

Evelyn thrashed wildly. Another man pulled her legs down, dragging her deeper. No chance to surface. No air.

Helpless. Powerless.

One minute. Two. Seven?

Water filled her lungs. Her strength ebbed away.

Consciousness faded. Heartbeat slowed. Muffled voices above the surface sounded distant.

A heavy shroud wrapped around her, pulling her into suffocating darkness.

The water's chill seeped into her bones.

Death felt closer underwater. More intimate.

Eventually, she stopped moving.

The men released her.

Face-down, she floated like discarded trash. Satisfied with their work, they left.

Never had Evelyn felt so cold.

The water's grip was absolute, paralyzing.

Just as she surrendered, strong hands hauled her up.

Warm lips sealed over hers, breathing life back into her frozen body. That familiar scent—him.

Tears mixed with pool water as realization struck. He'd saved her again.

How could she ever repay him? In that moment, Evelyn knew she wanted to marry this man.

At the hospital, Evelyn jolted awake choking. She bolted upright, gasping.

Outside her room, a familiar voice—usually so controlled—rang with desperate panic: "Save her! Whatever it takes!"

The doctor sounded strained. "Ms. Holloway has lost too much blood. Her RH-null blood type is incredibly rare. We don't have any in stock—"

Evelyn found herself moving before conscious thought. "I can donate," she heard herself say.
###Chapter 322 The Marriage Ultimatum

Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn Sinclair. His expression turned glacial, suspicion radiating from every pore as he clearly doubted her motives.

Evelyn's heart constricted painfully. Not only had he failed to recognize her as the drowning victim from years ago, but he didn't even remember being her rescuer - not once, but twice.

With sudden determination, Evelyn met his stormy eyes. "You will marry me," she declared, the words slipping out before she could stop them.

A violent shudder wracked Evelyn's body as the memories assaulted her. The inky blackness of the ocean swallowing her whole. The terrifying sensation of lungs burning for air. Those traumatic moments felt as fresh as yesterday.

Was it the saltwater stinging her eyes, or something else entirely? Evelyn gasped, her face draining of color as phantom pains gripped her chest.

The sea lay eerily calm now, not even a ripple disturbing its glassy surface. Panic clawed at Evelyn's throat as she scanned the horizon. The nearest vessel floated hopelessly distant - at least fifty meters away.

Would they reach them in time?

Evelyn sprinted to the speedboat's edge, screaming toward the distant sailboat until her voice cracked. "Help! Someone help! He's drowning!" Nearly six minutes had passed since Ethan disappeared beneath the waves.

Her raw cries echoed across empty waters. The sailboat remained motionless, showing no signs of life. Evelyn's vision blurred with unshed tears as she collapsed to her knees.

"He'll die... just like I almost did..." Each passing second amplified her terror. Sweat slicked her palms despite the ocean breeze.

Even if drowning didn't claim him, what about sharks? Frantically patting her pockets, Evelyn realized her phone was gone. Then she spotted the speedboat's emergency button.

Her hands trembled violently as she struggled to stand. Staggering toward the controls, she located the bright red SOS button.

Just as her finger hovered over it - SPLASH!

Ethan surfaced beside the boat.

Evelyn nearly tripped in her rush to the railing. Ethan, clad in his diving gear, heaved a massive crate onto the deck with visible effort. She immediately moved to assist.

The container weighed more than she expected.

No wonder even Ethan's muscular frame strained under its bulk. Finally, he hauled himself aboard, collapsing onto the deck while gasping for air. Tearing off his dive mask, he exhaled sharply.

"Ms. Sinclair, this thing's weighted for two people," he panted. "Seriously, take swimming lessons when we get back."

Evelyn nodded rapidly, her eyes still glassy. "Are you hurt?" she asked, voice thick.

Ethan coughed before answering. "Please. Professional explorer here. Drowning would be embarrassing."

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "They say it's always the strong swimmers who drown."

Noticing her red-rimmed eyes and shaky voice, Ethan studied her curiously. The underwater dive had deafened him to events above the surface.

Evelyn ducked her head, hastily passing him a towel and water bottle to mask her emotions.

After catching their breath, they examined their prize - a complete parasailing kit. "Ever tried this before?" Ethan asked.

Evelyn shook her head.

"Easy. I'll teach you," he assured with a confident smile.

Since their challenge required teamwork, Evelyn resolved to push through - swimming aside, she could handle anything else.

Ethan secured the parasail to the speedboat's tow rope with expert knots before fastening the harness around them both. Evelyn had skydiving experience and assumed this would feel similar, so her nerves remained steady.

If anything, anticipation buzzed through her veins.

Ethan engaged the autopilot. The speedboat's engine roared to life, accelerating across the open water with exhilarating speed.
###Chapter 323 Crippled

In a flash, Evelyn suddenly felt her body being yanked backward. All control slipped from her grasp as her face drained of color.

Before she could process what was happening, she found herself suspended sixty meters above the churning ocean.

A scream tore from her throat, instantly swallowed by the salty sea winds.

Her heart hammered against her ribs like a caged bird desperate for escape.

The speed was dizzying. The parasail ropes strained under the combined weight of Evelyn and Ethan as they soared higher.

They sliced through the crisp sea air, tethered to the speeding boat below.

The wind lashed at their faces - sharp, stinging, yet utterly exhilarating. Evelyn had never experienced anything like it.

In that suspended moment between sky and sea, life felt simultaneously fragile and invincible.

Pushing limits was proving dangerously addictive. Ethan adjusted his position and reached over to steady Evelyn's shoulders.

Evelyn gasped for breath, her eyes wide with wonder. "This is incredible!"

Ethan chuckled but kept focus on their mission. He pointed toward a cluster of sailboats in the distance.

Squinting downward, Evelyn deciphered the letters painted on the hulls: VOX. She cursed under her breath.

"What the hell? What does VOX have to do with this? Did they buy the rights to our show?" Even Ethan looked surprised, though at least they'd uncovered a clue.

Returning to the speedboat, Evelyn's pulse still raced from the adrenaline. With their discovery made, they turned back toward shore.

Online comments exploded in real-time: [Oh no, Evelyn looks devastated!] [Her anxiety is breaking my heart!] [If only Ethan knew what's happening... He needs to watch the replay!]

After an eternity of waiting at the rendezvous point, Adrian and Julian finally arrived with Sophia.

Julian supported Sophia as she limped dramatically. Adrian's stormy expression spoke volumes as he strode ahead, making no effort to hide his irritation.

The crew maintained a careful silence. Evelyn arched an eyebrow at the unusual sight - Adrian rarely lost his temper.

The director, who'd been waiting impatiently, raised his megaphone to deliver closing remarks. Evelyn and the others stood at attention, wisely avoiding questions about Adrian's mood.

They dispersed to separate vehicles for the final interview at VOX headquarters.

Finally free from live cameras, tension eased in the car. Gabrielle had prepared coffee and pastries for Evelyn.

Before Evelyn could take a sip, the door flew open. Adrian climbed in, snatched the coffee from Gabrielle's hands, and downed it in one gulp.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "I'm surprised you beat us back."

Adrian's face flushed crimson with anger. "Why did I ever agree to bring Sophia on this show? She's got zero common sense and nearly got us killed! Do you know Julian and I had to carry her up and down that damned mountain?" His voice rose. "And get this - she kept switching which leg was 'injured' the whole time! Total act!"

Evelyn burst into laughter, completely caught off guard. Adrian angrily devoured all the snacks meant for Evelyn, who merely smirked at his frustration.

"Thank God I had the sense to swap Sophia for Ethan in the second half," she remarked, shaking her head.
###Chapter 324 The Ultimate Betrayal

The viewers watching the live stream were sharp enough to catch the inconsistency and immediately erupted in outrage.

[Sophia's injury is clearly staged!] [First she limps on her right foot with Evelyn, then switches to the left with Julian, and back to the right with Adrian! Couldn't decide which leg to fake?] [Is Sophia auditioning for the role of tragic heroine? Such dramatic flair!] [This was supposed to be an adventure show, but Sophia just slowed everyone down. Now I understand why Evelyn wanted to switch partners after the first challenge!] [I take back everything I said about Evelyn being harsh - that fake deserves it!]

By the time the program wrapped up, night had fallen over Montecito.

Gabrielle and the chauffeur escorted Evelyn back to Sterling Manor. Exhausted from the day's events, Evelyn had fallen into a deep sleep during the car ride.

Lucas couldn't bring himself to wake his sleeping sister, so he carried her inside and had the maids prepare her for bed. For the following days, Evelyn remained at the manor, recovering from the physically demanding show.

Archibald spoiled her rotten with gourmet meals and every comfort imaginable. Evelyn reveled in being pampered, enjoying the luxurious lifestyle that came with being a Sterling heiress.

The moment the live broadcast ended, Sophia became the internet's favorite punching bag. Netizens even coined a cruel nickname for her: "Limpy Laurent."

The relentless mockery forced Sophia into hiding, too embarrassed to show her face in public.

When Adrian's adventure show finally aired online, the response was overwhelmingly positive.

To avoid controversy, the production team had carefully edited out any questionable content and deliberately avoided using Sophia's identity for publicity.

The polished twenty-minute highlight reel was packed with thrilling moments and genuine camaraderie. Even Sophia's fake injury was spun as an example of team unity. Watching the final cut, Evelyn felt the entire experience had been worthwhile.

The sanitized version bore little resemblance to the raw live footage. The editors truly worked miracles! During the closing interview, the host asked about the show's original inspiration.

Adrian paused thoughtfully, his striking eyes gleaming with passion. "For dreams and conviction," he declared. "Adventure isn't about courting danger or recklessness. It's about discovering life's miracles and finding strength in vulnerability."

Ethan Caldwell's answer was more personal: "To show my imaginary girlfriend how breathtaking the world can be."

After a beat of stunned silence, the studio erupted in thunderous applause.

Once the show aired, it dominated social media trends for days.

[To life and dreams! This show actually makes you believe in possibilities! And the casting is perfection!] [Evelyn looked absolutely adorable during the parasailing segment!] [Adrian and Ethan are total heartthrobs - they need to debut properly!] [Ethan and Evelyn have such natural chemistry! Did you see how she panicked when he dove into the ocean? So genuine!] [The editors were merciful with Limpy Laurent - they could've destroyed her!] [Ethan's backstory sounds fascinating. I need to know more!]

While all participants received attention, the focus remained firmly on Evelyn and Ethan's interactions. Their segments became the show's highlight, particularly the heart-stopping moment when Ethan disappeared underwater and Evelyn's frantic screams for help.

Her raw, unfiltered panic was clearly unrehearsed. Scanning through the comments, Evelyn hesitated before calling Adrian. "Everyone's obsessing over Ethan's imaginary girlfriend. Isn't that just twisting the knife?"
###Chapter 325 A Perfect Match?

Nathan Blackwood let out a mocking chuckle. Ethan Caldwell had just been dumped by his girlfriend who had also drained his bank accounts.

The woman had even cheated on him with a wealthy tycoon. That's why he claimed she was dead - the betrayal still burned fresh in his memory. Evelyn Sinclair could only shake her head in disbelief. How ruthless! The Kensington Group.

Inside the boardroom, executives trembled as department heads delivered their reports. Everyone feared displeasing President Blackwood and becoming his next example.

The atmosphere grew heavier with each presentation. When the Investment Department's turn came, their newly promoted director, Henry Yates, stepped forward with confidence.

Henry had yet to prove himself in this position. To secure his role, he needed to impress the formidable Nathan Blackwood.

Clearing his throat, Henry began with enthusiasm. "President Blackwood, our team has been analyzing entertainment industry trends, particularly reality shows."

"While the market is saturated with similar formats, we believe groundbreaking innovation could capture audiences' hearts."

Nathan's expression remained impassive. "What exactly do you propose?" His voice carried an edge that made others shift uncomfortably.

Henry eagerly inserted a flash drive and projected his findings. "This inspiration came from your nephew, Adrian. He's truly a credit to your family."

"The program has gained tremendous popularity recently. Adrian's charm, intelligence and bravery make him perfect for this concept." With a click, footage of Evelyn and Ethan parasailing filled the screen.

The speedboat sliced through turquoise waters, launching the parasail skyward. High above, Ethan steadied Evelyn in his arms as the drone camera zoomed in. Evelyn's radiant smile dominated the frame while enthusiastic comments flooded the screen:

[Relationship goals!]
[They look perfect together!]
[This is true love!]

"President, we could either license this format or develop something similar for our network," Henry concluded proudly.

Silence swallowed the room. The temperature seemed to drop several degrees as Henry continued praising Adrian and the show's potential.

He assumed complimenting Nathan's nephew would please the notoriously difficult executive.

Nathan's gaze remained locked on the screen, his expression darkening by the second. His jaw tightened visibly, the air around him crackling with restrained fury.

Why were viewers calling Evelyn and Ethan a perfect match? What nonsense! Were they all blind?

Harrison, Nathan's assistant, watched Henry's enthusiastic presentation with growing horror. As the video played, his expression turned increasingly pained.

He wanted to intervene but one look at Nathan's stormy countenance silenced him. This was going very, very badly.

Harrison shot Henry a pitying glance. The poor man had only held his position for weeks, yet now stood on career thin ice.

Henry finished his pitch and turned expectantly to Nathan, convinced his proposal would succeed. After all, who wouldn't invest in family?

The room held its breath. Nathan's glacial stare could have frozen lava.

Henry's confident smile faltered. Confused, he glanced at Harrison who only offered a sympathetic shrug.

Before Henry could attempt damage control, Nathan stood abruptly. "Meeting adjourned." His clipped words hung in the air as he strode from the room without another glance.
###Chapter 326 He Wants to Experience It Himself

Harrison followed Nathan to the CEO's office. His skin prickled under Nathan's glacial stare.

"President Blackwood, is this your idea of proper arrangements?" Nathan's voice was razor-sharp, devoid of any warmth.

Harrison swallowed hard. "Sir, for Young Master Adrian's reality show, not only has the Sterling family shown support, but even Old Master Blackwood personally contacted major media outlets—"

Nathan's eyes darkened like storm clouds. "In that case, Kensington Group will be the sole investor. Understood?"

"Absolutely, sir. Consider it done."

Nathan lifted his espresso cup with elegant fingers. "Since we're investing, I'll be making a personal visit. I want to experience this production firsthand."

Harrison's eyebrows shot up. He processed the bombshell in record time. "Of course! You'll appear as a mystery guest. This will generate tremendous buzz for our show."

Nathan gave a satisfied nod. "Dismissed."

Harrison barely exhaled before rushing back in. "Sir—Old Master Blackwood has arrived."

Nathan's jaw tightened imperceptibly. He waved a hand in silent permission.

Sophia Blackwood swept into the office like a hurricane, her designer heels clicking against marble. Margaret trailed behind, lips pursed in disapproval.

"Grandfather. Mother." Nathan's voice remained neutral. "To what do I owe this unexpected visit?"

Margaret's manicured fingers clenched. "Your sister's abroad, your father's in Tokyo—and you haven't set foot in Highland Estates in weeks! Are we not permitted to check on you?"

Old Master Blackwood cleared his throat. "We're dining with the Sterlings tonight."

Nathan's espresso cup froze mid-air. "The Sterlings?"

Margaret's gasp was theatrical. "Absolutely not! That Evelyn parades around with a different man every week! I showed you those scandalous photos—"

"Enough!" The old man's cane struck the floor with a crack. Margaret flinched.

Turning to Nathan, his grandfather's voice softened. "Son, we need to solidify things with Evelyn. You nearly started a war with those pirates for her."

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his cup.

"I know your feelings. But does she reciprocate? We lost three cargo ships, and the Sterlings bailed us out. A marriage alliance would benefit both families immensely."

Sophia Blackwood was no fool. He recognized Nathan's obsession with Evelyn Sinclair. With her connections and the Sterling fortune, any sacrifice would be worthwhile.

Nathan exhaled through his nose. "Fine."

Margaret looked ready to combust. "Father! Have you seen Evelyn's social media? The entire internet mocks her escapades! We'll become laughingstocks—"

"Silence!" The old man's roar shook the windows. "Who are you to criticize the Sterling heiress? The Blackwoods are fortunate they're even considering us after what we did!"

Nathan stared out the floor-to-ceiling windows, already calculating how to turn this dinner to his advantage. The game was far from over.
###Chapter 327 You Don't Have to Participate

Margaret Blackwood froze when Nathan's grandfather reprimanded her. Her position in the family had always been precarious.

Ever since that incident where she'd helped Sophia steal the old man's emerald pipe, Margaret had lived in constant dread of being cast out.

With Sophia's whereabouts unknown, Margaret didn't even have anyone to confide in anymore.

When the elder Blackwood scolded her, Nathan simply stood there, watching coldly without uttering a word. His icy gaze made her skin crawl, fueling her resentment toward Evelyn Sinclair.

Nathan turned to his assistant, Harrison. "Escort Mrs. Blackwood back to Aspen Lodge. She won't be joining us for dinner tonight."

Margaret stiffened. Old Master Blackwood nodded in agreement. "Good. We can't afford any missteps in mending relations with the Sterling family tonight."

Neither of them cared for her opinion. Margaret seethed at Nathan's dismissive attitude. By the time she left, her expression was stormy.

The dinner was held in an exclusive private dining room, attended only by the Sterlings and the Blackwoods. William Sterling arrived with his son Alexander and daughter Evelyn.

Nathan and his grandfather had just taken their seats when the Sterlings entered. The occasion wasn't overly formal, so Evelyn had opted for a sleek gray-blue gown paired with Manolo Blahniks.

Her effortless elegance carried a hint of playful charm.

William and Old Master Blackwood exchanged pleasantries, carefully avoiding personal matters and sticking to business discussions.

Despite the polite atmosphere, tension hummed beneath the surface. Evelyn could feel a pair of eyes burning into her from across the table.

It was infuriating. When that intense gaze landed on her again, she couldn't take it anymore.

She lifted her head abruptly and met Nathan's stare head-on. He blinked, momentarily startled, before his lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. Evelyn clenched her jaw but refused to look away.

What game was Nathan Blackwood playing in front of their families? She hadn’t wanted to come at all, but William had reminded her that Nathan had saved her life. The least she could do was stay for a while before excusing herself.

Noticing the time, William gave Evelyn a subtle signal.

"Actually," he began smoothly, "Evelyn and I are deeply grateful for the Blackwood family's assistance. Beyond our business collaboration, Evelyn has prepared a small token of appreciation for you, Chairman Blackwood."

Evelyn smiled and retrieved a velvet box from her clutch, handing it to the elder Blackwood. "Chairman, I acquired this from a private collector in France. It was crafted by the same master who made your original emerald pipe."

"I heard you frequently visit the museum to admire it," she continued. "I understand how much it meant to you, so as a gesture of gratitude, I tracked this one down."

Old Master Blackwood's lips twitched.

She knows I visit the museum just to stare at my own stolen pipe? Is she mocking me?

When he opened the box, his breath caught. This pipe wasn’t identical to his lost treasure—it was superior. The emeralds were richer in color, more flawless in clarity.

Meticulously preserved, its value was indisputable—likely exceeding ten figures. Even if one could afford it, the collector might never have parted with it.

The Sterlings had somehow secured the impossible.

Excitement flared in the old man’s chest, but he hesitated to touch it, afraid his fingers might tarnish its brilliance. Then, realization dimmed his enthusiasm.

This extravagant gift was nothing more than repayment for Nathan saving Evelyn’s life.

By presenting it, William had made his stance clear: no marriage alliance. Money meant nothing to the Sterlings, and they wouldn’t sacrifice Evelyn’s happiness for business.

Old Master Blackwood saw through the maneuver instantly. He glanced at Nathan, whose darkened expression confirmed he understood too. A frosty aura enveloped him as he fixed Evelyn with a penetrating stare.

Evelyn, however, kept her head down, quietly eating her meal. She had no interest in their unspoken battle.
###Chapter 328 Normal Interactions

Old Master Blackwood smiled warmly. "We deeply regret how we treated Evelyn in the past. If there's any chance, we'd love to make amends." William Sterling waved his hand dismissively.

"Think nothing of it. Young people often act without thinking. What's done is done, and Evelyn has moved on. There's no need to dwell on it."

"Just interact normally," William suggested.

"Normal interactions," Nathan Blackwood repeated under his breath. His dark eyes flickered with some unreadable emotion before curving into a slight smile. "Yes, we should interact normally."

Nathan lifted his gaze to meet Evelyn's, giving her a knowing smirk.

Feeling the intense stare from across the table, Evelyn instinctively looked up to find Nathan watching her with an annoyingly charming expression.

Why is he smiling like that? Evelyn nearly choked on her drink, her appetite suddenly vanishing.

She set down her fork with deliberate care and rolled her eyes at him. Strangely, instead of anger, this only seemed to amuse him more.

Nathan's smile widened as he observed Evelyn's barely contained irritation. He found her exasperation oddly endearing. Even her eye-rolling seemed charming - how had he never noticed that before?

While William and Old Master Blackwood continued their animated conversation, Alexander Sterling discreetly observed his sister and Nathan.

The charged atmosphere between them was... peculiar.

"By the way, Mr. Blackwood," Alexander smoothly interjected, "I heard several of your cargo ships encountered issues recently. Sterling Corporation's fleet would be happy to assist with transportation if needed."

Evelyn was about to exhale in relief when Nathan simply said "Noted" without breaking eye contact with her. His persistent attention was driving her crazy.

Is he serious right now? What game is he playing? Evelyn turned to her father abruptly.

"Dad, I just remembered I promised to meet Isabella. I should get going." Honestly, she'd already fulfilled her social obligations by thanking the Blackwoods. Staying for the full dinner was unnecessary.

William nodded. "Of course, darling."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Goodbye Dad. Chairman Blackwood."

She gathered her things and made her swift exit, only to be intercepted by Nathan mere steps from the door.

"Evelyn."

She spun around impatiently.

Since when did Nathan Blackwood become so persistent? Did someone switch his medication?

"Mr. Blackwood, is there something else you need?" Her tone could freeze molten lava.

One polite dinner didn't mean they were suddenly best friends.

Nathan seemed momentarily taken aback by her icy demeanor. He approached slowly, carefully controlling his expression. His dark eyes held hers with unsettling intensity.

"Your father suggested we interact normally," he said calmly, though his presence felt anything but calm. "You should comply."

Evelyn frowned at him like he'd grown a second head. "That's not what he meant."

"Then what did he mean?" Nathan's lips quirked.

Evelyn nearly choked on her response. "How should I know?"

Suddenly, her phone was no longer in her hand.

In one fluid motion, Nathan had taken it, his elegant fingers navigating her contacts. He unblocked his number with practiced ease.

"From now on, no more blocking me. Or I'll have to tell your father."

Evelyn stared in disbelief.

He actually said that with a straight face? Her father clearly meant for Nathan to keep his distance! Was this man deliberately misunderstanding or just being obtuse?

Evelyn felt her sanity slipping away.
###Chapter 329 They're the Same Person

Evelyn Sinclair clutched her phone, her fingers trembling with barely contained rage. Nathan Blackwood had not only unblocked himself from her contacts but had the audacity to rename himself Life Saver in her phone.

The sheer arrogance made her blood boil. Was this his way of guilting her into keeping his number?

She bit her lower lip, refusing to engage, and spun on her heel to leave. Nathan followed, his steps unhurried but persistent, matching her pace like a shadow.

As they reached the restaurant's grand entrance, he suddenly spoke, his voice low but firm. "Evelyn, I'll teach you how to swim."

The memory of the near-fatal plane crash flashed through his mind—the terror of searching for her in the endless ocean, only to learn from Lucas Sterling that she couldn't swim.

That variety show incident with Ethan Caldwell? Her panic hadn’t been for him. It was the water itself that paralyzed her.

How could someone as fiercely independent as Evelyn not know how to swim? He needed to change that.

But at his words, Evelyn froze. Her back stiffened, her breath hitching as if the air had turned to ice.

The suffocating weight of old memories pressed down on her—the sensation of being held underwater, lungs burning, darkness swallowing her.

Even now, just the thought made her skin prickle with cold sweat.

She turned slowly, her almond-shaped eyes sharp with frost. Nathan frowned, confused by the sudden shift in her demeanor.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said, voice dripping with disdain, "meddling is an exceptionally irritating trait."

He stepped closer, undeterred. "Is it? Then tell me why you refuse. Give me one good reason."

His dark eyes gleamed under the restaurant's entrance lights, like stars reflected in a midnight lake.

Evelyn’s jaw clenched. Her face paled, the chill in her gaze unmistakable. Nathan realized he’d stumbled upon something deeply painful—which only made him more determined to understand.

For a moment, she hesitated. Then she laughed, the sound hollow.

"Have you forgotten, Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice was rough, barely above a whisper. "Three years ago, you pulled me out of a swimming pool before I bargained my blood for your hand in marriage."

"Why would I learn to swim now, just to drown again?"

Nathan recoiled as if struck. Shock and something darker—something like horror—flashed across his face.

Evelyn watched his reaction with grim satisfaction. Her smile widened, but the light in her eyes dimmed.

"So you didn’t remember?" she mused. "Or maybe you never knew the woman you saved was the same one who later traded her blood for your name."

Nathan’s face drained of color. He remembered the emergency call that had sent him to that private pool—the woman floating lifeless in the water.

He’d revived her, sent her to the hospital, and left without another thought.

He never connected her to the desperate woman who later appeared, offering her blood in exchange for marriage.

Now, the truth slammed into him like a physical blow. His chest tightened, breath turning shallow.

A thousand questions burned in his mind—How did she end up in that pool? Who did this to her?—but Evelyn only smiled, cold and detached.

"It doesn’t matter now," she said, her voice brittle. "The past is dead. Let it stay buried."

And with that, she walked away, leaving Nathan standing there, drowning in the weight of what he’d just learned.
###Chapter 330 The Taste of Vengeance

Three years ago, Nathan Blackwood only had eyes for Vanessa Holloway.

Why would he bother remembering the face of someone he'd casually rescued? Nathan simply didn't care. So,

Evelyn can't swim because she nearly drowned? Nathan's expression darkened.

His obsidian eyes swirled with stormy emotions. "I'm sorry." All the words he wanted to say condensed into those two syllables.

Evelyn found it amusing and let out a bitter laugh. "You should be."

"You didn't think those underground fighters would seek revenge after I saved you, did you? That they'd come after me instead?" The words struck Nathan like lightning. His face drained of color.

He seized her wrist with sudden intensity. "What did you say?" His reaction puzzled Evelyn as she gave a careless shrug.

At this point, clarity was better than ambiguity.

It no longer mattered who saved whom. Between them, the scales of debt had tipped beyond measure.

"Mr. Blackwood, I could swim perfectly fine three years ago. The reason I refuse to learn again? Because someone held my head underwater until I nearly drowned."

"Is that reason sufficient for you?" Evelyn spoke with icy detachment, pushing away the suffocating memories. She'd made her choices.

She'd never regretted saving Nathan, even with the consequences. In the past, she might have resented him. But that was then.

Now that she'd freed herself from her obsession, none of it mattered anymore.

Nathan's expression turned thunderous. Shock morphed into white-hot rage and consuming hatred.

He'd always assumed those men would never find him if he stayed away. The night air grew colder around them.

Evelyn shivered - she'd always hated the cold. She turned to leave this suffocating space.

"What difference does it make if he knows? If he had any decency, he'd disappear from my life forever!" Before she could step away, strong arms yanked her back.

Her spine collided with a solid chest as his familiar cedar scent enveloped her. The unexpected contact froze her in place.

Nathan's voice came out rough with emotion. "Evelyn, I swear to you - I'll find them. Every last one. And I'll make them pay." She wrenched free immediately.

Her voice could have frosted glass. "It's irrelevant. The past is dead." Just then, their respective drivers pulled up.

As Evelyn moved toward her car, Nathan grabbed her again. "Nathan Blackwood!" The night swallowed her protest.

The wind howled between them. Evelyn's teeth chattered - she needed to escape this frozen purgatory.

"Knowing changes nothing! If you feel any remorse, you'll vanish from my life!" She spun to leave, but he caught her waist.

Pressed against his warmth, surrounded by his scent, she momentarily forgot to breathe.

Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I'll hunt them down, Evelyn. I promise you that."

"And then what? Kill them?" She shoved him away, her tone arctic. "Let it go."

"It's ancient history." The arrival of their drivers interrupted the confrontation.

Evelyn reached for her car door when Nathan's grip tightened. "Nathan Blackwood!" The name tore from her throat.
###Chapter 331 I'm Begging You

Evelyn Sinclair was at her wit's end.

Why was Nathan Blackwood clinging to her like some persistent insect that refused to be shaken off? She wanted to scream at him for his sheer audacity.

Nathan's grip on her wrist was unyielding, his voice icy and resolute. "Evelyn, whether you believe me or not, I regret everything. If I could just—"

She cut him off sharply, the pain in her eyes impossible to conceal any longer.

"Nathan Blackwood, I've spent years haunted by nightmares of the past."

Her voice trembled. "From the moment I met you, I haven't known a single day of true happiness. I don't regret saving you, but for the love of God, I'm begging you—let it go. Stop dragging us back into that hell."

Nathan's regret meant nothing to her. It didn't erase the three years of torment she had endured. If anything, it was almost laughable.

His entire body stiffened at her words.

The raw agony in her voice, the way her eyes glistened with unshed tears—it shook him to his core. He couldn't even bring himself to meet her gaze.

All that suffering... and he had been oblivious to it.

Evelyn studied his profile—the sharp jawline, the straight nose, the perfectly sculpted features that had once made her heart race.

She had been obsessed with him, drowning in a love she couldn't escape.

Now? All she wanted was distance.

Quickly schooling her expression, she turned away, forcing a cold smile.

"You don't need to apologize. You don't need to regret anything. It's over. Just... move on."

She assumed his remorse stemmed from guilt—now that he knew why she couldn't swim, why she had panicked that night.

But it didn't matter.

Her love for him had been one-sided from the start, born from the moment he had thrown himself in front of her on the streets of Paris.

She didn’t want to revisit that memory.

Without another word, she turned and slipped into the Sterling family car.

Nathan wanted to chase after her, but his feet remained rooted to the ground.

The way she had looked at him—so distant, so unfamiliar—made him question what right he had to stop her.

He watched in silence as the car disappeared down the street, then turned and walked away.

Velvet Lounge

Nathan pushed open the door to the private room, the lively chatter inside coming to an abrupt halt.

Tristan Whitmore stood up in surprise.

"Blackwood? I thought you had dinner plans with Evelyn and her family. What are you doing here?"

Their group of close friends met regularly, and Nathan usually attended without fail.

But tonight, he had declined, proudly declaring he had prior engagements—with Evelyn.

At the mention of her name, Nathan's expression darkened.

His chest ached as if struck by a sledgehammer.

Without a word, he grabbed a bottle of vodka and tilted his head back, drinking deeply.

The room fell silent.

The air around him was thick with bitterness and cold fury.

"Mr. Blackwood... did something happen? Did Evelyn upset you again?"

One of the more oblivious socialites in their circle spoke up, having heard Tristan mention Nathan's constant struggles with Evelyn.

Nathan's grip on the bottle tightened, his gaze turning glacial.

Tristan groaned internally.

Before he could intervene, the man continued, smirking.

"Honestly, that woman has no shame. She's just a divorcee you discarded. The fact that you even glance her way is a privilege, and she dares to treat you like this?"

Tristan buried his face in his hands.

"You idiot..."

Under the dim lighting, Nathan slowly lifted his head.

His eyes burned with a dangerous, feral intensity as they locked onto the man.

Then—

He slammed the bottle down onto the table with a deafening crash.
###Chapter 332 I Can't Let Her Go

The deafening crash echoed through the private room.

Every crystal glass on the marble tabletop shattered instantly. Razor-sharp fragments sprayed across the room, one slicing across Nathan Blackwood's cheekbone.

A crimson trail of blood snaked down his chiseled face. The VIP lounge plunged into an icy silence so thick you could hear a pin drop. The young aristocrat who'd spoken paled visibly.

His mouth snapped shut. He'd realized too late that he'd crossed an unforgivable line by mentioning her name. Nathan's eyes burned with barely restrained fury.

An arctic chill radiated from his powerful frame as he rose to his full height, looming over the trembling man like a predator.

"Who gave you the right to speak her name?" Nathan's voice was steel wrapped in velvet.

Without warning, his designer shoe connected with the man's ribs.

The aristocrat curled into a fetal position, sweat beading on his forehead despite the room's temperature. Not a single onlooker dared intervene.

Tristan Whitmore sprang into action. "Easy there!" He shot a warning glance at the others. "Nathan's had one too many. Clear out - I'll handle this."

The crowd didn't need telling twice. They practically tripped over themselves exiting, dragging the injured man between them like discarded trash.

The aftermath resembled a war zone. Only Nathan and Tristan remained.

Nathan's fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. Veins stood out on his temples like live wires.

Tristan guided him back to the plush leather seating, signaling discreetly for staff to clean up. A fresh round of premium liquor appeared moments later.

"Drink." Tristan filled a crystal tumbler to the brim, taking a healthy swig himself. Nathan downed the amber liquid in one burning gulp.

The alcohol scorched his throat but gradually loosened the vise around his chest.

His broad shoulders shook slightly as he buried his face in his hands.

"She nearly died because of me, and I was oblivious." The revelations kept coming like body blows.

Three years of marriage where he'd treated her like an afterthought. The realization gutted him. And still he'd demanded her forgiveness.

"Evelyn must despise me." The words tasted like ash in his mouth. An invisible hand seemed to squeeze his heart mercilessly.

The memory of learning about her near-drowning shattered something fundamental in him. Self-loathing rose like bile.

Why hadn't he questioned who needed help at the pool that day? Why had he arrived too late? How could he have married her yet failed to cherish her?

Now the bridge was burned beyond repair.

Evelyn Sinclair would never look at him with those adoring eyes again. Tristan frowned, missing crucial context but recognizing the root cause.

He'd never make the mistake of underestimating Evelyn's hold again. Seeing Nathan's disheveled state confirmed what he'd suspected - the man was utterly, irrevocably in love.

Nathan emptied glass after glass until his vision blurred. Only one name passed his lips between drinks.

"Evelyn...Evelyn..."

Tristan exhaled sharply. "You're really hung up on her, huh? What's so special about that woman?"

Even half-conscious, Nathan responded instinctively. "Love her...would give anything...but she's done with me." His voice cracked like dry kindling.

He wanted to love her with the same fierce devotion she'd once shown him.

Tristan stood. "You're wasted. Let's get you home."

"Need to see Evelyn," Nathan slurred.

"Fine."
###Chapter 333 Already Here

The iron gates of Sterling Manor loomed in the darkness. Tristan Whitmore sat in his car, fingers tapping impatiently on the steering wheel before he finally dialed Evelyn Sinclair’s number.

The call connected after several rings. Evelyn’s voice was thick with sleep, sharp with irritation. "Who the hell is this?"

Tristan exhaled sharply. "It’s me. Tristan Whitmore."

A pause. Then, reluctantly, "What do you want?"

"Nathan’s drunk out of his mind, and he’s currently sprawled in front of your gates. Come get him before he freezes to death."

Silence stretched between them.

Then, cold and clipped, "Take him and get the hell away from my house."

Tristan gritted his teeth. "We’re already here. If you don’t come out, I’m leaving him right where he is. Your problem now."

He hung up before she could argue, exhaling sharply. Dealing with Evelyn these days required nerves of steel.

Without hesitation, he hauled Nathan out of the passenger seat and dumped him unceremoniously in the middle of the driveway.

"This is on you, man," Tristan muttered, patting Nathan’s shoulder before retreating to his car.

He didn’t look back as he drove away.

Evelyn stared at her phone, Tristan’s words sinking in.

Already here.

She threw off the covers and strode to the balcony, shivering as the cold night air hit her skin. Below, a car’s taillights disappeared down the winding driveway.

"Unbelievable," she hissed under her breath.

Her father and brothers were asleep. She slipped on a robe and padded downstairs, her bare feet silent against the marble floors.

The front door creaked as she stepped outside.

Nathan Blackwood sat slumped against the gate, his usually immaculate appearance in ruins—tie loose, hair disheveled, the sharp scent of alcohol clinging to him.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Nathan Blackwood," she said, voice like ice. "Are you auditioning for a tragic hero role now?"

He lifted his head. His eyes were bloodshot, his expression raw.

"Evelyn," he rasped.

Her breath caught despite herself.

"I’m sorry," he said, voice breaking. "If you just—give me one more chance—"

Her chest tightened, an old, familiar ache flaring to life.

Then, just as quickly, she smothered it.

Before she could speak, Nathan’s head dropped forward, his body going limp.

Unconscious.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her fingers curling into fists.

That damned dinner had dredged up too many memories—wounds she’d thought long scarred over, now raw and bleeding again.

Forgiveness? She’d tried. Over and over.

But some things couldn’t be undone.

She had made peace with her own foolish heart long ago. What she wouldn’t do was reopen old wounds for his drunken regret.

Yet here he was, pathetic and broken at her doorstep.

Three years ago, this would have shattered her. Three years ago, she might have wept at the sight of him like this.

Now?

She wiped away the single traitorous tear that escaped.

"We’re even," she whispered. "Let’s just pretend we never knew each other."

Nathan didn’t move.

She turned away.

Then, on impulse, she spun back and kicked him square in the ribs.

"That’s for Europe," she muttered.

Without another glance, she marched back inside and slammed the door behind her.

Leaning against it, she pulled out her phone and dialed Tristan.

Straight to voicemail.

"Coward," she hissed.

Next, she called Gregory Thornton.

He answered on the second ring.

"It’s Evelyn Sinclair," she said, voice clipped. "Nathan Blackwood is passed out drunk at my gates. Either come get him, or I’m calling the police."

She hung up before he could reply.

Twenty minutes later, from her bedroom window, she watched Gregory’s car pull up, load Nathan inside, and disappear into the night.

She drew the curtains closed.

Sleep wouldn’t come easy tonight.
###Chapter 334 She's Vanishing Without a Trace

A sudden crisis erupted at one of Sterling Corporation's international branches, demanding immediate attention.

Alexander Sterling was tied up with urgent matters at headquarters, making it impossible for him to leave the country.

Evelyn Sinclair stepped in without hesitation, volunteering to handle the situation in his stead.

The trip would also serve as a much-needed escape—a chance to breathe away from the suffocating tension back home.

News of Evelyn's departure reached Nathan Blackwood within the hour.

He was in his office, nursing a cup of hangover tea, when Harrison delivered the blow.

"What?" Nathan's grip on the cup faltered, scalding liquid spilling across confidential documents. He shot to his feet, a sharp twinge shooting through his side—an unwelcome reminder of last night's recklessness.

"She left the country?" His voice was dangerously calm.

Harrison swallowed hard. "Yes, sir. When I delivered the return gift to Sterling Manor, it was received by Mr. Lucas Sterling."

A pause. Then the damning words: "He mentioned Ms. Sinclair is traveling abroad... and may not return."

Nathan's face drained of color.

Not return?

His chest constricted violently, as if an invisible hand had seized his heart.

"Where?" The word tore from his throat. "Which flight? Which destination?"

Panic clawed at him—raw, irrational, consuming. The thought of her slipping away, vanishing beyond his reach, was unbearable.

Harrison hesitated. "She didn't take a commercial flight, sir. The Sterlings sent their private jet."

Nathan's jaw locked.

A private jet meant no passenger manifest. No easy trail to follow.

She was deliberately making it impossible for him to find her.

The realization struck like a physical blow. She wasn't just leaving—she was erasing herself from his life entirely.

"No." The word was a vow, ice-cold and unyielding. "Find her."

He met Harrison's gaze, and the assistant flinched at the storm brewing in those steel-gray eyes.

"You have one hour to track that jet's destination." Nathan's voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Fail me, and you can disappear along with her."

Harrison's spine straightened. "Understood, sir."

He fled the office, already dialing his contacts. The clock was ticking—and Nathan Blackwood wasn't a man who accepted defeat.

With that final remark, Nathan Blackwood strode out the door. Four hours later.

At the Paris headquarters of Sterling Worldwide's French subsidiary, Nathan stood imposingly at the grand entrance. His towering frame commanded attention.

His chiseled features could have been carved from marble, each angle perfectly defined. The sharp line of his jaw, the aristocratic slope of his nose - everything about him screamed privilege and power.

An aura of quiet intensity surrounded him, drawing curious glances from every passerby. The receptionist approached him for the third time. "Monsieur, are you certain there's nothing I can assist you with?"

Nathan merely offered a polite but distant smile. "I'm waiting for someone." Beneath his composed exterior, his pulse raced erratically.

Even knowing Evelyn Sinclair was somewhere in this building, he couldn't bring himself to barge into her office. Not after everything. She'd only despise him more for it.

So he waited in the lobby like some lovesick fool, hoping to manufacture a chance encounter. She'd see through the ruse immediately, but that hardly mattered anymore.

A bitter chuckle escaped his lips. "Since when did I become this cautious?" He shook his head. "Worth it, if I get to see her face again."

Upstairs, Evelyn had spent the afternoon extinguishing corporate fires. Raphael Dubois, the subsidiary's CEO and her former classmate, walked beside her as they descended in the private elevator.

"Your timing was impeccable as always," Raphael remarked with genuine admiration. "That acquisition would have collapsed without your intervention."

Evelyn's lips curved into a confident smile. The stilettos clicking against marble accentuated her commanding presence. "Only because I have the best team in Europe backing me up."

As they reached the ground floor, excited whispers reached them. "Who is that gorgeous man waiting by the lounge? I've never seen anyone so striking!" "I tried getting his number earlier - completely shut me down!"

Evelyn's steps faltered when her gaze landed on the familiar figure rising from the plush armchair. Nathan's dark eyes locked onto hers with an intensity that made her breath catch.

In three strides, he was before them. Evelyn's nails dug into her palms as she fought to maintain her composure.

This infuriating man was like a ghost she couldn't escape. She remained silent as Nathan's assessing gaze flicked to Raphael before returning to her, softening instantly.

"Why did you leave New York so suddenly?" The question came out rougher than intended.

Evelyn's spine straightened. Her eyebrow arched in challenge. "Since when do I need your permission to travel?"
###Chapter 335 A Dull Ache in My Side

Evelyn's frosty demeanor didn't elicit even a hint of irritation from Nathan.

Instead, his gaze softened, warm and tender as it lingered on her. "I was just asking. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to."

Not that it mattered—Nathan had other ways of finding out.

Beside Evelyn, Raphael Dubois cleared his throat lightly.

"Ms. Sinclair, is this your friend?"

"No." Evelyn shut that down immediately.

"Since we've resolved the matter, would you consider staying a few more days before leaving?" Raphael suggested smoothly.

Nathan's eyes darkened, the warmth vanishing as his gaze sliced toward Raphael. The chill in the air was palpable.

Evelyn frowned and shook her head. "Next time. I have urgent matters waiting for me back home."

"What a shame. Safe travels, then."

Raphael extended his hand politely. Evelyn offered him a perfunctory smile, shook it, and turned to leave.

Nathan followed, his long strides easily keeping pace.

Together, they looked like a vision—two striking figures who commanded attention effortlessly.

Nathan persisted, trailing after Evelyn despite her pointed silence. He boarded the Sterling family's private jet without hesitation.

"I came looking for you last night," he murmured. "Did I startle you?"

Evelyn scoffed.

"Sorry, I didn't see you."

Nathan paused, his voice dropping lower. "No one was with me the whole time?" He tilted his head slightly. "And yet, my side aches a little. There’s even a footprint on my clothes."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, a flicker of guilt crossing her features before she schooled them back into indifference.

Nathan was surprised by her unusual tolerance today.

It almost felt... rewarding.

Unable to bear his scrutiny any longer, Evelyn finally snapped. "Mr. Blackwood, why are you here?"

Nathan hesitated. Every prepared excuse evaporated on his tongue.

His voice came out rough, barely above a whisper. "I thought you didn’t want to see me anymore. So I came to find you."

Evelyn blinked, caught off guard, then let out a derisive snort and turned away, feigning sleep.

Nathan watched her, his expression unreadable. There were a thousand things he wanted to say—words that lodged in his throat, unspoken.

"Evelyn," he said suddenly, "is there anything you want?"

He would give it to her. Stars, the moon—anything.

Evelyn laughed, sharp and humorless. "All I want is for you to stay away from me."

Nathan's smile faltered for a fraction of a second before he smoothed it back into place. He lowered his lashes, masking the pain that flashed in his eyes.

When he looked up again, his expression was carefully neutral.

"That’s the one thing I can’t do," he said lightly. "So don’t waste your breath."

With that, he reclined in his seat and closed his eyes, feigning sleep just as she had.

Evelyn rolled her eyes and exhaled sharply before doing the same.

Back in Montecito, Evelyn finally had a few peaceful days to herself. She went fishing, indulged in shopping sprees—blissfully free of Nathan Blackwood’s relentless presence.

The first episode of Adrian’s adventure show had been a roaring success, earning rave reviews and skyrocketing in popularity. Julian Moreau, riding the wave, secured several lucrative deals. Even Ethan Caldwell was tapped for commercials.

The only one floundering was Sophia Laurent, whose reputation had taken a hit after the backlash. Still, the controversy kept her name in the headlines—a twisted silver lining.

Fans demanded she quit, but Sophia knew walking away now would be career suicide.

So, despite everything, she signed on for the second episode.

Evelyn, reluctantly accepting her own invitation, arrived at the filming location with minimal enthusiasm.

Rumors claimed this round wouldn’t be as grueling as the first, but Evelyn wasn’t holding her breath.

When she got there, the others were already waiting. Adrian lit up and moved to sweep her into one of his signature spins—only to yelp when Evelyn’s foot connected with his shin.

"You—you’re vicious!"

"Oops. Didn’t see you there, Niel."

"Liar!" Adrian groaned, rubbing his leg.

Evelyn smirked before smoothing her expression and greeting the rest of the cast with practiced charm.
###Chapter 336 Diva, Stay Strong!

Evelyn Sinclair opted for effortless athleisure wear with minimal makeup. Yet nothing could dim her radiant aura.

Her poise remained regal, her confidence unshaken. Ethan Caldwell gave her a casual wave while Julian Moreau approached for a polite embrace. Sophia Laurent stood out in her sequined cocktail dress, looking every inch the red carpet starlet.

Her smile was cautious this time, a marked contrast to her previous arrogance. "Evelyn, it's been too long," she offered.

Evelyn responded with perfect neutrality - neither warm nor cold. Her gaze lingered curiously on Sophia's outfit. "This is an adventure show," she thought. "Why is she dressed for a gala? Does she think the audience won't notice?"

But she kept silent. This wasn't her circus, and Sophia certainly wasn't her monkey.

As the last participants arrived, the director began his lengthy briefing, switching on the live feed. Even Adrian Blackwood tapped his foot impatiently.

Finally, an assistant whispered in the director's ear. Clearing his throat, the man announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, we have a last-minute change. Our title sponsor for this episode has changed hands. The new investor now owns the program's copyright."

Adrian's jaw dropped. "What? How? I wasn't informed!" The producer had personally secured the original backers, yet someone had swooped in without his knowledge.

The director merely smiled. "Patience, Adrian. The surprise is worth waiting for."

The crew erupted in applause as he continued, "Please welcome our mystery guest and new sole sponsor - Mr. Nathan Blackwood!"

Deafening silence filled the studio. All eyes swung between the emerging Nathan Blackwood and Sophia, whose clapping echoed awkwardly in the quiet space.

The group collectively ignored Sophia's desperate performance. Adrian rushed forward, flustered. "Uncle? What are you doing here?"

Julian and Ethan maintained perfect poker faces, wisely avoiding the brewing storm. Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. "You've got to be kidding me," she muttered.

The live chat exploded:

[OMG! Most awkward entrance ever!]
[Mr. Blackwood supporting his nephew - so sweet!]
[Look at Sophia trying so hard. Cringe!]
[Queen Evelyn staying unbothered as always!]
[This episode's gonna be fire! So much drama!]
[You got this, Diva!]

Nathan strode forward, utterly unfazed by the tension. His expression softened, though his commanding presence remained.

Backstage, Harrison had risked his neck with advice. "Sir, you might want to smile more for Ms. Sinclair."

Nathan had scoffed. "Lions don't concern themselves with sheep. I'll win Evelyn my way."
###Chapter 337 Has Your Foot Recovered?

All eyes turned toward Nathan Blackwood in perfect synchronization. The director announced with great fanfare that Nathan's primary purpose for visiting was to experience the groundbreaking nature of this show.

Adrian Blackwood didn't buy a single word of it. He knew his uncle was just being intrusive. His business had barely survived countless struggles, only to become just another asset in Nathan's vast portfolio.

The most infuriating part? Adrian had to clench his teeth and force himself to thank his so-called benevolent Uncle Nathan!

His chest tightened with suffocating frustration.

The director beamed and placed an opaque box in the center.

"This time, we have six participants—two per team. Those who draw the same color will be paired together."

Just as everyone reached for their cards, the director held up a hand.

"Mr. Blackwood holds a selection card. As our special guest, he has priority in choosing his partner."

Nathan stood tall, his commanding presence impossible to ignore. Sophia Laurent, standing beside Evelyn Sinclair, gazed at him with barely contained excitement. She ached to be chosen by him.

After all, very few women could claim any association with Nathan Blackwood. Ever since he presented Sophia with the Most Promising Newcomer Award, people had swarmed her with questions about their connection.

Those who once dismissed her now looked at her with renewed interest.

But Nathan took a deliberate step forward, his gaze locking onto Evelyn with a knowing smile. The outcome was already clear.

Evelyn's brows furrowed as Nathan strode up, pressing the card into her hand and gripping her fingers tightly.

"I choose Evelyn."

His voice echoed through the venue.

Evelyn shot him a glare while the director hurried the others to draw their cards.

Final pairings:

Julian Moreau & Adrian Blackwood
Ethan Caldwell & Sophia Laurent
Evelyn Sinclair & Nathan Blackwood
Adrian nearly collapsed in relief, throwing his arms around Julian and refusing to let go.

"Bro! We finally got paired together!"

He was thanking the heavens he hadn't been stuck with Sophia.

Ethan's expression flickered, but he maintained his composure, accepting the result gracefully.

Sophia, however, was far from pleased. Ethan was a nobody. Even ignoring Nathan, Ethan's fame and status couldn't compare to Adrian's.

She wouldn't get the exposure she wanted with him.

But then again, Evelyn and Ethan had won massive praise in the last episode. Maybe she could make this work.

Sophia forced a sweet smile. "Please take care of me, Ethan."

Ethan nodded politely. "Of course. But your foot has recovered, right?"

Sophia's smile froze.

She said nothing.

The live chat exploded.

[Ethan Caldwell is brutally honest! HAHAHA! "Has your foot recovered?" I can't—]
[I thought Mr. Blackwood came for his nephew. Turns out he's here for Evelyn! His intentions are painfully obvious.]
[Can't exes just be friends? They move in the same circles—of course they have to stay civil.]
[Adrian's smug face is everything! He's my daily dose of serotonin.]
[It's such a shame they divorced. Nathan Blackwood is perfection. Evelyn, don't you dare soften! Even without him, you could have any man in the world!]
###Chapter 338 - Unexpected Collision

Evelyn Sinclair crossed her arms and shot Nathan Blackwood an exasperated glare.

Hah! Mysterious guest? If I'd known Kingsley Tech was backing this show, I wouldn't have invested that hundred million in Julian's project.

What a complete waste!

Nathan smirked and leaned closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "I could always have him return your investment."

As if I want your dirty money! Evelyn thought bitterly. When she deliberately turned away, Nathan cleared his throat.

"The production team arranged everything. You wouldn't sabotage the show just because of our... history, would you?"

Evelyn's icy gaze swept over him. "Sorry, Mr. Blackwood, but your charm doesn't work on me anymore." Her lips curled in a mocking smile. "Keep your distance, and don't interfere with my plans to sponsor these promising young talents."

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly. The muscle in his cheek twitched as he bit back whatever retort he wanted to make.

The director began explaining the game rules - a treasure hunt in an abandoned factory. Much safer than last week's death-defying challenges.

Evelyn smirked. Probably chose this dump to save on location fees.

Nathan looked displeased but couldn't object since the site had been booked months ago. The crew had cleaned the factory, but it remained gloomy and unsettling.

Peeling gray walls. Broken furniture scattered like bones. Tattered curtains fluttering like ghosts. The perfect haunted house setting.

Three floors. Three teams.

Adrian Blackwood and Julian Moreau took the ground floor.

Evelyn and Nathan got the second.

Ethan Caldwell and Sophia Laurent headed for the top.

As they ascended, Sophia clung to Ethan's arm, trembling. "It's terrifying here!" Her wide eyes darted to Evelyn. "Aren't you scared?"

Evelyn shrugged. "There are cameras everywhere. The crew's prepped every inch."

Sophia bit her plump lower lip. "Feels like we're in a horror film. I've been terrified of ghosts since childhood." She tilted her head. "You're so calm. Don't you believe in the supernatural?"

Evelyn's lips quirked. "My father raised me on Enlightenment philosophy. I minored in Marxist theory during my doctorate." She gave Sophia a pitying look. "Ghosts don't exist."

Sophia's face fell. Conversation over.

Nathan watched Evelyn with undisguised admiration. Everything about her fascinated him.

Reaching their floor, Evelyn bounded ahead eagerly.

Then - a shriek.

Sophia "slipped," tumbling backward directly toward Nathan.

"Help!" she wailed.

Nathan's eyes narrowed. If he dodged, she'd crack her skull on the stairs. In a split-second decision, he pivoted and -

Kicked her squarely in the back.

Sophia's graceful backward fall became an undignified faceplant. Her wails of pain echoed through the factory.

She'd hoped for a romantic rescue. Instead, she got a footprint on her designer dress.

Evelyn and Ethan came running at the commotion.

"Are you okay?" Evelyn helped the sniffling actress up.

From below, Adrian's laughter rang out. "Sophia, with all this space, you just had to fall on my uncle? How... convenient."
###Chapter 339 The Jester's Fall

Sophia Laurent's face twisted in humiliation. The moment Adrian Blackwood exposed her scheme, waves of shame crashed over her.

"I—I tripped on my gown!" Sophia stammered.

Adrian drawled, "Oh?" His mocking tone made it clear nobody bought her excuse.

Evelyn Sinclair barely suppressed an eye roll. She just wanted to finish this ridiculous game and escape this circus. "Need to change?" she offered curtly.

Sophia nodded too quickly, scrambling to her feet. Ethan Caldwell smirked. "No twisted ankle requiring my chivalry this time? My back's still recovering from last episode's performance."

Scarlet flooded Sophia's cheeks.

Ethan was throwing her previous staged fall in her face. She glanced desperately at Nathan Blackwood, but his indifference cut deeper than any insult. He'd known. Known she'd thrown herself at him deliberately.

The revulsion in his gaze burned. All her carefully crafted plans had turned her into tonight's laughingstock.

Who could've predicted Nathan would sidestep instead of catching her? That he'd let her tumble up the stairs like discarded trash? Sophia gnawed her lip, forcing a brittle smile. "Just my dress. I'll change." She fled toward her waiting assistant, clutching ruined satin.

Before the game even began, #SophiaFloppedAgain trended worldwide.

[Pathetic!]
[That kick was legendary!]
[Most Promising Neer? More like Most Pathetic Actress!]
[Ethan's savage! "Twisted his back" LOL!]
[Nathan Blackwood's disgust face is my new screensaver]
[Queen Evelyn's expression: "Must I endure this clownery?"]

The live show rolled on without her.

Evelyn turned toward the challenge area—rusty equipment littering tables, three walls lined with potential hiding spots. She didn't rush to search. Instead, she climbed onto a crate, surveying the space with military precision.

Nathan approached, all arrogant charm. "Found anything?"

Evelyn's jaw tightened. Every interaction with him risked sparking remarriage rumors. She shot him a withering glare. "Do your own reconnaissance. We're not teammates."

She marched toward the nearest cabinet, but Nathan followed like a shadow.

Evelyn whirled around. "Are you illiterate? I said—"

The cameraman nearly dropped his equipment. The director had specifically ordered careful coverage of Nathan Blackwood—PR teams on standby, damage control protocols ready. Yet here were two billionaires bickering like divorced neighbors over a fence.

Compared to the show's usual scripted drama, this raw tension was ratings gold.

Nathan merely smirked and stepped closer. "Make me leave."
###Chapter 340 Her Winning Streak

Nathan Blackwood arched an eyebrow. "I'll search this area too." He made a show of opening a cabinet. Evelyn Sinclair rolled her eyes at him, deliberately ignoring his presence as she continued rifling through the dusty shelves.

From his peripheral vision, Nathan spotted a small, unassuming box perched precariously on top of the cabinet. Evelyn stretched on her tiptoes, fingers just grazing its edge.

The box wobbled dangerously. Before she could steady it, the container tumbled downward. There was no time to react. Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact as her stomach dropped.

This is just perfect! But instead of pain, she felt the cool press of a broad palm against her forehead, shielding her face. The faint scent of sandalwood and citrus enveloped her.

The muffled thud of the box striking Nathan's hand made her flinch, though he didn't so much as twitch. Her heart did a peculiar little flip at the protective gesture.

Nathan withdrew his hand, his deep voice laced with amusement. "Close call." He handed her the offending box. "Though I doubt they'd hide anything important in such an obvious spot."

"Want to check anyway?" Evelyn shot him a sidelong glance before quickly looking away. She pried open the box to reveal... absolutely nothing.

Unfazed, she tossed it onto a nearby table with a careless flick of her wrist and resumed her search. She pointedly didn't thank Nathan, pretending their little moment never happened.

Yet when he continued shadowing her movements, she didn't protest like before. The second floor was dim, but shafts of sunlight through broken windows illuminated Evelyn's silhouette like a spotlight.

Her eyes sparkled with determination. The elegant curve of her profile could make Renaissance sculptors weep. Those full lips, painted a bold crimson today, looked positively sinful.

She was the kind of woman who commanded attention without trying - a natural queen among peasants who had to scream to be noticed. The more you looked, the more breathtaking she became.

Evelyn could feel the weight of Nathan's gaze burning into her back. Every time she turned to confront him, he'd suddenly become very interested in examining floorboards or ceiling beams. The man was terrible at subtlety.

The camera crew kept zooming in on her too, which was beyond irritating! After combing the entire floor without success, Adrian Blackwood bounded up the stairs. "Uncle Nathan! Evie! Let's switch floors. We've found nothing but empty containers."

Evelyn nodded and turned to leave when a flash of color on the opposite wall caught her eye. Nathan followed her gaze, sharp eyes narrowing. "Is that...?"

"A map!" Evelyn's heart leapt as she rushed over to examine it. She turned eagerly to the nearest staff member. "Is this it?" Her voice vibrated with excitement.

The staffer shook his head apologetically. "Sorry, no." Her shoulders slumped. "Should've known it wouldn't be that easy."

Just as she reached the stairwell, Sophia Laurent's triumphant shout echoed from above. "Found it!" All heads snapped upward.

Adrian scoffed until Ethan Caldwell confirmed, "She's right! Director!" The staff immediately herded everyone toward the third floor.

Against all odds, Sophia - who usually struggled with basic social interactions - had actually located the treasure map. Evelyn followed the group upstairs, where Sophia was practically vibrating with excitement as she presented her prize.

"This game is utterly ridiculous," Ethan muttered under his breath.

The director accepted the map with solemn ceremony and declared it authentic. Sophia jumped up and down, beaming. "Finally! My time to shine!" She turned hopeful eyes toward Nathan. "Director, isn't it time for team changes now?" Her desire to partner with Nathan was painfully obvious.

That had been the rule in previous episodes - winners of the first challenge could swap teammates.

The director hesitated, rubbing his chin. Before he could respond, Nathan's icy voice cut through from behind Evelyn. "That rule's been suspended for this episode."
###Chapter 341 Keep the Good Stuff Within the Family

Sophia froze in place, her cheeks burning with humiliation.

Her intentions were painfully obvious to everyone, but Nathan Blackwood had shut her down without hesitation.

The director quickly intervened, rewarding Sophia with the privilege of leading the next challenge.

Online comments exploded with ruthless commentary.

[Did Sophia just get publicly humiliated by Mr. Blackwood?] [This is both tragic and hilarious!] [Everyone's having fun except poor Evelyn - she's the only one taking this treasure hunt seriously!] [Am I imagining things or does Mr. Blackwood look at Evelyn like she's the only woman in the world?]

The group moved to their next destination using Sophia's treasure map. Along the way, Adrian sidled up to Nathan with a smirk.

"Uncle Nate, that was some bold cheating back there," he whispered. "Changing the rules without consulting anyone? Even the director didn't dare object!"

Nathan shot him a sideways glance, his voice crisp and cold. "I could remove you from this show just as easily. Care to test that theory?"

Adrian choked on his laughter, instantly silenced.

He knew better than to doubt his uncle's threats. "You're obsessed with Evelyn, but she's not interested. You're wasting your time!"

Nathan stopped walking abruptly, turning to face his nephew with icy intensity. "And she's not interested in you either, Adrian Blackwood. Stop fantasizing about what you can't have. Consider this your final warning."

The unspoken threat hung heavy between them. Nathan tolerated Adrian because of their family ties, but his patience had limits.

Adrian swallowed hard, suddenly finding it difficult to breathe. His gaze drifted ahead to where Evelyn walked with Ethan, deep in discussion about the upcoming challenge.

The painful truth settled in his chest. Despite everything they'd been through together, Evelyn only saw him as a friend. And now with Nathan in the picture...

Adrian jogged to catch up with his uncle. "You really love her, don't you?"

Nathan gave him a look that suggested the question was idiotic.

Adrian exhaled sharply. "Fine. You're probably the only man worthy of my Evelyn anyway. Since you've changed for the better, I'll help you. Family should keep the good stuff to ourselves, right?"

Nathan ignored Adrian's rambling, his attention fixed on Evelyn's animated conversation with Ethan. He quickened his pace to intercept them.

"Evelyn."

She turned, her smile fading when she saw him. "Problem?"

Nathan's lips curved. "Several, actually."

Ethan took the hint and retreated to join Adrian who had fallen behind. Evelyn inhaled deeply through her nose.

What does he want now?

The next location came into view quickly. The final challenge was an extreme sport - bungee jumping from a hundred-meter cliff, popular among thrill-seekers.

Sophia's face lit up with excitement. Crew members prepared safety harnesses for each participant while the director explained the rules.

"Everyone will board that hot air balloon," he pointed, "for a game of truth. Sophia will determine penalties based on how well each pair performs. One punishment option is an 80-meter bungee jump from this cliff. Those who refuse must accept whatever creative punishment Sophia devises."

This was the advantage of finding the treasure map.

No wonder Sophia looked so pleased with herself!
###Chapter 342 Who Do You Prefer?

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't typically afraid of heights, but the sheer depth of this particular cliff made her pulse quicken involuntarily.

As she approached the hot air balloon basket, her knees trembled visibly.

Aside from professional adventurers like Adrian Blackwood and Ethan Caldwell, most participants shared Evelyn's nervous reaction.

Nathan Blackwood remained stoic, his expression unreadable.

The chasm below appeared bottomless, the dense forest canopy resembling a dark abyss. Floating mid-air felt like standing on shifting clouds—unsteady and precarious.

Thankfully, the safety measures were impeccable.

Otherwise, Evelyn would have refused to participate entirely! She silently vowed to avoid Adrian's extreme adventures in the future. The camera crew remained grounded, relying solely on participants' body cams and drone footage.

Sophia Laurent's pale face and death grip on the railing seemed genuine, though no one could be certain. Her piercing screams momentarily distracted everyone from their own fear.

"Scared?" Nathan's deep voice came from behind her. Evelyn paused mid-step and scoffed. "Not at all!" His quiet chuckle made her shoulders tense.

She wanted to retort when Sophia's whimpering interrupted. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm terrified!" Nathan merely glanced at her indifferently.

Adrian rolled his eyes. "Stop wailing like a wounded banshee! We can't hear ourselves think. Want to dub this entire segment?" Sophia's cries ceased abruptly.

Aside from Julian Moreau, everyone present held significant social status—people Sophia couldn't afford to offend. Tears welled in her eyes as she sniffled, "I just... can't help it."

"If you're truly uncomfortable, request extraction," Ethan suggested kindly. Sophia shook her head. "I'll manage..."

Julian remained silent, gazing at the horizon. The director's voice crackled through the balloon's speakers.

"Sophia, proceed with the questions!" Taking a shaky breath, she stood and produced cue cards.

"First question for Evelyn." She glanced at the safety harness. "You may decline to answer, but refusal requires completing the bungee jump." Clearly a planned challenge. Evelyn smirked. "Fire away."

Sophia read: "If you had to date one of these four men, who would you choose?" The atmosphere turned electric.

The biting wind accentuated the tension. "These questions were provided by production!" Sophia added hastily at Evelyn's darkening expression.

Evelyn's laugh broke the tension. "Julian, obviously." She winked at the young actor beside her—his boyish charm and sincerity made him the safest choice.

Nathan's jaw clenched visibly, his gaze turning glacial. Sophia looked oddly pleased as she pressed, "And your second choice?"

"Ethan." Evelyn offered the stunned explorer an apologetic smile. "Purely hypothetical, of course."

Ethan chuckled awkwardly while Nathan's glare intensified, his displeasure radiating like winter frost.

Adrian's eyebrows shot up. "You'd pick Caldwell over me?" He shot Nathan a meaningful look. "Seems Uncle Nathan didn't even make the top three..."
###Chapter 343 A Reckless Descent

Sophia's face froze when Evelyn predicted the third answer flawlessly. Her gaze darted toward Nathan, whose expression had darkened into a thunderous scowl.

His glacial stare pinned Evelyn in place, the intensity barely restrained. Yet Evelyn merely smiled.

"I suppose I don't need to jump then?" Sophia quickly regained her composure. "Moving on—the next question is for Mr. Blackwood." She turned to Nathan with barely concealed excitement.

"If you had to choose one woman here as your girlfriend—" Triumph glittered in Sophia's eyes.

After Evelyn's public humiliation, surely no man would pick her. With only two women present—Evelyn and Sophia—this was her moment to shine.

Before she could finish, Nathan's voice cut through like Arctic wind. "Evelyn." Then, without warning, he yanked Evelyn against his chest and stepped backward off the cliff.

Gasps erupted from the crowd.

"Ahhh!" Evelyn's scream tore through the air as gravity seized them. The world spun violently, her stomach lurching as they plunged toward the abyss.

Nathan's arms locked around her waist like steel bands. Suddenly, his lips crashed against hers—warm, demanding, tasting faintly of mint. All terror dissolved beneath that intoxicating pressure.

Her cries died instantly. The kiss was pure possession, his tongue mapping every inch of her mouth with ruthless precision. Evelyn fisted his shirt, forgetting the safety harness entirely. He was her only anchor in this freefall.

She only reacted when he bit her lower lip—sharp enough to sting.

Evelyn's eyes flew open. The world blurred around them—nothing but rushing wind, the harness digging into her waist, and Nathan's sculpted face inches away. His obsidian eyes held her captive, making her pulse stutter.

The ground raced toward them. Just before impact, their descent jerked to a brutal halt. The rebound wrenched Evelyn's body painfully, but Nathan remained unfazed.

His gaze was an ocean in storm—deceptively calm until you glimpsed the riptides beneath. Evelyn's knuckles whitened on his shoulders, her face bloodless.

She wasn't afraid of heights. But plummeting 100 meters? Every nerve screamed in primal terror.

The harness slackened. They dropped again.

Nathan cradled her head against his chest, his whisper cutting through the howling wind: "You've always been my only choice."
###Chapter 344 Evelyn, Who Do You Choose?

Nathan Blackwood couldn't tell if Evelyn Sinclair had heard him. She remained completely still, giving no reaction. The bungee cord kept bouncing them violently up and down.

Gradually, Evelyn's body adjusted to the motion. Her initial panic began to fade away.

When she finally opened her eyes to look at him, they burned with icy fury instead of fear. After they were pulled back up, Adrian Blackwood and the others rushed over in concern. "Evelyn, are you alright? How do you feel? Any dizziness?" Nathan was ignored off to the side.

Everyone knew Nathan had done this deliberately, so no one comforted him. Evelyn was clearly the victim here! Even Sophia Laurent just stood silently watching the pair.

She couldn't comprehend what had just happened. Evelyn shook her head weakly, her face deathly pale. She couldn't speak yet, only feeling waves of nausea rolling through her.

Her brows furrowed painfully. "Can we be done with this?" Adrian paused, glancing at Nathan's expressionless face - pale but showing no emotion.

For someone with special forces training like Nathan, this extreme sport was child's play, wasn't it? Adrian gently patted Evelyn's back.

"Wait, I just discussed with the director - we're changing the game." His eyes flickered toward Sophia's face. "Let's just vote on who should bungee jump next and get this over with! Forget the truth game!" Sophia's face instantly drained of color.

As she opened her mouth to protest, Ethan Caldwell nodded approvingly. "Great idea. Much better than anonymous voting."

"I vote for Sophia." Ethan was brutally direct, giving her no chance to refuse.

"Straight to the point!" Adrian grinned. "Great minds think alike! My vote's for Sophia too!" With only six people total, two votes were already against her.

Sophia looked desperately at Julian Moreau, who'd won the Most Promising Newcomer Award alongside her. Surely he'd side with her?

Without hesitation, Julian's gaze swept over Evelyn's face. "I also vote for Sophia." Sophia's heart plummeted. Three votes against her already.

She was doomed! No matter who Evelyn or Nathan chose, she was finished! Yet Adrian still turned to Evelyn for her answer.

"Evelyn, who do you choose?" Evelyn still looked unwell. She lowered her lashes briefly before raising them to reveal glacial eyes. "I vote for Nathan Blackwood." Her answer shocked everyone.

Clearly in this situation, Sophia was the obvious target. Among all the Nitra participants, only Evelyn dared vote against Nathan - her silent protest against his cruelty.

Nathan's brows twitched slightly, his eyes darkening momentarily. Then he raised an eyebrow at her, surprisingly showing no trace of guilt.

Adrian tried to diffuse the tension by casually asking Nathan, "Uncle Nathan, who's your pick?" If Nathan had any sense, he'd follow Evelyn's lead and vote for himself.

Maybe that would appease her somewhat. But he didn't. Under everyone's watchful gaze, Nathan lifted his chin and pointed at Sophia.

"Her." Not a single extra word. Sophia's face crumpled. After all her efforts to please him, Nathan was bullying her along with the others.

Ironically, Evelyn - the one Sophia had been targeting - was the only one who hadn't voted against her. Sophia felt tears welling up, standing there looking utterly wronged.

She immediately switched to her pitiful damsel act. "I...I accept this result, but I've had a terrible fear of heights since childhood..."

Surely these grown men wouldn't force a delicate girl like her to jump, right? Adrian laughed darkly.

His lips curled into a reckless smirk as he stepped closer, lowering his voice. "Fear of heights? Then why come on this show? Maybe I should ask your agent what's going on here."

"You signed the contract agreeing to all program requirements..." His smile turned predatory. "I guess you'll just have to pay those breach of contract penalties then."
###Chapter 345 Please Stay the Hell Away From Me

Sophia Laurent's eyes widened in shock as she stared up at Adrian Blackwood. His expression was deadly serious, not a trace of amusement in his piercing gaze. He stepped aside wordlessly, granting her passage.

The contract terms flashed through her mind. She knew she couldn't back out now. No one would believe her pathetic acting anymore.

It was painfully obvious to everyone how Sophia had manipulated the show's direction to target Evelyn Sinclair specifically.

Biting her lower lip until it nearly bled, Sophia cast one last desperate glance at the stone-faced Nathan Blackwood. His attention remained fixed elsewhere, never once acknowledging her presence.

With hesitant steps, Sophia moved toward the edge, each footfall heavier than the last. She kept looking back, silently begging for someone - anyone - to stop her.

Her final pleading gaze landed on Evelyn, who stood gripping the railing with pale knuckles. Evelyn's eyes were closed, one hand pressed against her chest, clearly struggling with her own discomfort. She showed no concern whatsoever about Sophia's impending jump.

A strangled sob escaped Sophia's throat as she finally took the plunge.

Her blood-curdling scream shattered the mountain's tranquility, echoing endlessly through the valley. The live audience erupted in commentary.

(They should've had Mr. Blackwood push her! That would've been priceless!)
(Coming in fourth really bruised his ego, huh? Serves him right!)
(Didn't Sophia brag about being an extreme sports enthusiast in episode one? Now she's scared of heights? What a fraud!)
(My heart breaks for Evelyn - she told the truth and still got dragged into this mess!)
(Mr. Blackwood clearly regrets that divorce. He hasn't taken his eyes off Evelyn since they arrived!)

Nathan noticed Evelyn's worsening pallor and immediately summoned assistance. As others rushed to her side, he lingered behind, watching her every move with hawk-like intensity.

When Evelyn stumbled slightly, a flicker of remorse crossed Nathan's features. He reached out instinctively, but Evelyn sidestepped his touch with surprising agility.

Her crimson-rimmed eyes burned into his with unprecedented fury. "Stay the hell away from me." The venom in her voice was new - a stark departure from her usual polite indifference.

This reaction cut deeper than Nathan expected. Regret pooled in his gut, but he knew any apology would only earn him further scorn. Evelyn would never believe his sincerity now.

Pressing his lips into a thin line, Nathan fell into step behind her. "Are you angry?"

"What gave it away?" Evelyn snapped. "I just needed to cool off, that's all. Don't worry your pretty little head about me."

The weak excuse hung awkwardly between them. Evelyn suddenly whirled around, her glare sharp enough to draw blood. "Let me guess - you wanted me to jump too, didn't you? You bastard! Taking your petty anger out on me like some spoiled child!"

Nathan's eyebrows arched, though Evelyn couldn't see the expression beneath his dark sunglasses. Truthfully, he'd only wanted her attention for a few more seconds. Being her fourth choice stung, but her complete indifference hurt far worse.

"Of course not," he lied smoothly.

"Bullshit," Evelyn spat. Neither mentioned the accidental kiss during their tandem fall - an unspoken agreement to ignore what couldn't be taken back.

As Evelyn turned to leave, her legs suddenly buckled. White spots danced across her vision as the world tilted dangerously.

She collapsed without warning.

Nathan lunged forward, catching her limp form effortlessly. Panic creased his forehead as he assessed her condition. Without hesitation, he scooped her into his arms and sprinted toward the waiting vehicles.

Evelyn's assistant Gabrielle and the driver stood ready by the car. Their faces drained of color at the sight of their unconscious boss in Nathan's arms.
###Chapter 346 The Weight of My Mistake

The sharp scent of antiseptic assaulted Evelyn's senses as she regained consciousness.

White ceiling tiles came into focus above her.

She was in a hospital room.

A shuddering breath escaped her lips. Fragments of her nightmare still clung to her - the terrifying sensation of free-falling, the bungee cord snapping taut, then plunging downward again in endless cycles.

Her body still trembled with phantom adrenaline when a warm cloth gently dabbed her forehead.

Evelyn turned her head.

The sight of Nathan Blackwood sitting beside her bed made her expression darken immediately.

"Why are you still here?" Her voice came out hoarse.

Nathan's shoulders slumped. "I... I couldn't leave." His usually deep voice sounded raw with guilt. "This is all my fault."

Even unconscious, Evelyn had been restless - sweating, twitching, murmuring pleas of "Don't push me" in her feverish state.

The memory made Nathan's gut twist. He'd never imagined his impulsive stunt would terrify her so profoundly. If he could turn back time...

He'd jump off that platform a hundred times alone rather than drag her into his reckless moment.

Evelyn turned her face away, rejecting his ministrations. She opened her mouth to demand he leave when Gabrielle and her driver arrived.

"Ms. Sinclair! You're awake!" Gabrielle carried a thermos, swiftly pouring steaming liquid into a cup. "Nerve-calming herbal tea. Doctor's orders."

Evelyn accepted the cup, inhaling the soothing aroma.

Her stomach growled audibly.

She took several careful sips before setting it down. Nathan immediately reached for the cup, but Gabrielle intercepted smoothly.

"Mr. Blackwood, please allow me." The assistant couldn't fathom her boss's ex-husband doing menial tasks.

Evelyn shot Nathan a withering look. "Don't you have companies to run? A city to conquer? Why linger here?"

Nathan's jaw tightened.

"I won't disturb you."

"You're disturbing me by existing in this room," Evelyn retorted without mercy.

After a heavy silence, Nathan stood and left. Gabrielle sighed at Evelyn's stormy expression. "Ms. Sinclair, perhaps go easier on him?"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow.

"Mr. Blackwood carried you down the entire mountainside to get help," Gabrielle explained. "The ambulance had equipment failure and a flat tire. He ran nearly two miles with you in his arms."

Evelyn's fingers stilled on the bedsheet.

"And when you were unconscious..." Gabrielle hesitated. "You clung to him desperately. Wouldn't let go of his sleeve. Every time he tried to move away, you'd become agitated. He stayed all night."

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks.

Damn her subconscious betraying her like this!

"The recording?" Evelyn changed subjects abruptly. "The show?"

Gabrielle nodded. "Wrapped successfully. Everyone's returned to the city. We can leave whenever you're discharged."

Good. At least she hadn't humiliated herself on camera.

Noticing Evelyn's pallor, Gabrielle urged her to rest. Though eager to leave, exhaustion pulled Evelyn under before she could protest.

When she awoke again, moonlight painted silver stripes across the hospital floor.

Gabrielle had dimmed the lights and closed the door, but left the curtains open. The world outside glowed with streetlamps.

The ward's excellent soundproofing created an eerie stillness - so quiet Evelyn could hear the faint hum of medical equipment.

She savored the peaceful isolation.

Sliding from bed, Evelyn padded toward the door, only to freeze at the voices outside.

"Mr. Blackwood, you haven't eaten all day." Gabrielle's concerned tone. "At least go inside to rest properly."

"No need." Nathan's distinctive baritone held its usual icy distance when addressing anyone but Evelyn.

Her hand hovered over the door handle.

After a heartbeat's hesitation, Evelyn turned the knob and stepped into the hallway.
###Chapter 347 She's Getting Back to Her Career

Evelyn Sinclair straightened her shoulders and announced, "Prepare the car. I'm going home."

Gabrielle blinked in surprise before nodding swiftly. "Right away. The driver is already waiting outside."

Nathan Blackwood rose from his seat, his piercing gaze lingering on Evelyn for a long moment. "Are you feeling better?"

Evelyn hesitated briefly. "Yes."

The softness in her voice caught him off guard. His stern expression melted into something warmer, almost tender. He had been so worried she might break—but he had forgotten. Evelyn Sinclair wasn't made of glass.

Only she could throw a tantrum like that and still walk away unscathed.

Nathan wanted to escort her back personally, but before he could step out, his phone buzzed urgently. Harrison’s voice crackled through the line, tense and rushed. With a reluctant sigh, Nathan bid Evelyn a quick goodbye and left.

The ride home was quiet. Evelyn stared out the window, her phone lighting up incessantly with notifications.

Adrian Blackwood had been the most persistent.

Ninety-nine unread messages from him alone. She didn’t bother opening them.

Instead, she lifted her phone and snapped a careless shot of the city skyline—blurred streetlights, smeared neon, the hazy glow of traffic.

She posted it with a simple caption: Beautiful night. I’m doing well.

Within seconds, her notifications exploded.

Adrian Blackwood: You post a pic but ignore my texts???

Ethan Caldwell: Photography skills: -10/10.

Julian Moreau: Get well soon!

Sebastian Hart: Send me your location.

She skimmed through the replies, responding to a few before a new comment caught her eye.

Harrison: Relaying a message: Beautiful shot. Professionals truly operate on another level.

Evelyn gritted her teeth. Of course. Harrison was just the messenger.

Was that supposed to be a compliment? Or was Nathan Blackwood mocking her?

Stupid man.

Back at Sterling Manor, Evelyn took a few days to rest.

Isabella Montgomery dragged her out—shopping, dining, arcade games—anything to bring back her usual spark.

Then, the variety show episode aired.

Evelyn never cared for live broadcasts, but she loved watching the edited versions. There was something thrilling about seeing the polished final product.

She watched the fifteen-minute clip with keen interest.

The editors had done an impressive job. They’d focused on Nathan’s guest appearance, carefully omitting Sophia Laurent’s drama, making the entire cast seem harmonious.

The comment section, however, was another story.

The internet had collectively decided that Nathan Blackwood had only appeared on the show for one reason: Evelyn.

Why else would a man who turned down every financial talk show suddenly show up on an adventure program?

Mr. Blackwood is in love with our queen, isn’t he?

This feels like an episode of "How to Win Your Ex-Wife Back (And Fail Spectacularly)."

Adrian doesn’t stand a chance now.

Evelyn, don’t waver! Julian is still the best choice!

The comments ranged from supportive to absurd. Some urged her to stay strong, warning her not to fall for Nathan’s charms again. Others begged her to forgive him, insisting he’d changed.

Do they think I’m an idiot?

She tossed her phone aside in frustration.

Days later, Adrian pitched the idea of a third episode.

Evelyn refused immediately. She had no interest in returning—especially now that she knew Nathan was the show’s primary sponsor.

Adrian reluctantly accepted her decision.

News of her withdrawal spread like wildfire.

The internet erupted.

This show is nothing without Evelyn! I only watched for her and Sophia’s hilarious cluelessness!

Evelyn, please reconsider and debut properly! You’re more entertaining than half the actresses out there!

Are you quitting because of Nathan Blackwood?

Speculation ran rampant. Her social media was flooded daily with questions about her relationship with Nathan.

Sterling Corporation finally stepped in with an official announcement:

Effective immediately, Evelyn Sinclair has resumed her position at Sterling Corporation.

Evelyn reposted it with her own message:

Time to get back to work.
###Chapter 348 Someone Will Always Think About It

Evelyn's statement temporarily silenced the public's demands for her return to the show.

As the CEO of Sterling Corporation, she didn't need the entertainment industry to sustain her livelihood. That alone gave her every right to make that choice.

The frenzy died down quickly. Evelyn thought this would be the perfect excuse to step away for good—until the next morning, when Leo abruptly switched the room to daylight mode before she even woke up.

Sunlight streamed through the curtains, warming her face as she blinked awake.

She stretched lazily and poked the AI tiger. "You got the timing wrong. It's not time yet."

Leo nuzzled her forehead insistently.

"Someone's waiting for you! No more sleeping in!"

Groaning, Evelyn dragged herself up, her drowsiness fading. Twenty minutes later, she emerged refreshed.

She slipped into a luxurious Elie Saab casual dress—a soft beige knee-length piece that radiated elegance and youth.

Alexander Sterling had already checked his watch a dozen times by the time she descended the stairs. The moment she appeared, he pulled her toward the door.

"You're needed at the office today. Everyone's waiting."

Evelyn stared at him, bewildered. "Today? Since when was this decided?"

Alexander exhaled sharply. "It's the shareholders' meeting. Some have been eyeing your position for months. You showing up will shut them down."

Understanding dawned. "Ah. So that's what this is about."

Sterling Corporation.

The top-floor conference room was tense, every attendee sitting stiffly in the heavy silence.

Evelyn had faced this kind of atmosphere before. She was unfazed.

When she entered with Alexander, the room erupted in a mix of reactions—some gazes calculating, others relieved, a few indifferent.

Applause broke out as she stepped inside.

This was her first official meeting since her return.

Some faces were familiar. Others, not so much.

"Welcome back, President Evelyn."

She smiled politely and took her seat beside Alexander. The meeting began.

In business settings, Alexander mirrored Nathan Blackwood's demeanor—cold, unreadable, never smiling.

As directors and shareholders presented their arguments, his expression remained icy, detached.

Evelyn quickly grasped the situation.

A Wall Street magnate from Liberty, Preston Sinclair, had proposed a groundbreaking AI project.

Sinclair was an enigma—his name never appeared on Forbes' lists, yet his influence in the business world was undeniable.

AI development was booming globally, with nations and corporations fiercely competing for dominance. But no one had successfully integrated these advancements into a cohesive system.

Research, medicine, smart devices—each field excelled independently, but no single company had bridged them all.

Preston Sinclair wanted to change that.

He sought to unite the industry's top players and create the century's leading AI conglomerate.

Smaller firms had no place in this vision. Only those at the pinnacle of the pyramid stood a chance.

Sterling Corporation had reached out multiple times—with no response.

Then Lawrence Whitmore, one of their shareholders, saw an opportunity.

He wanted his son, Damian Whitmore, to lead this collaboration—a move that sparked immediate backlash.

"How can you hand such a critical deal to your son as a training exercise?" someone snapped. "Are you losing your judgment?"

Even if Sterling secures this deal, it'll be because of our reputation—not Damian's competence."

"Trying to claim credit already? Bold."

"Damian is a department manager. He's capable enough—"

The debate raged on.
###Chapter 349 A Gamble Worth Taking

The boardroom crackled with tension. Divided opinions hung thick in the air like storm clouds. Some voiced agreement, some opposition, while others merely observed the unfolding drama.

Evelyn Sinclair studied Alexander Sterling's impassive face. His sharp eyes were half-lidded, his expression glacial as if the heated debate meant nothing to him. Bennett noticed this and cleared his throat pointedly.

The room fell silent instantly, all eyes turning to gauge Alexander's reaction. His frosty gaze swept across Lawrence Whitmore, voice dripping with icy precision.

"Mr. Whitmore, is your desperation for your son's advancement truly this transparent?"

Lawrence swallowed hard. Normally timid, he'd mustered courage for this moment, knowing Damian's position at Sterling Corporation hung by a thread without notable achievements.

"President Sterling, Damian's accomplishments in the business division speak for themselves. I have every confidence he can lead this initiative."

Alexander's lips curved into something resembling a smile, though his eyes remained arctic.

"And if he fails?" The question froze the room. The silence became oppressive.

Lawrence's face stiffened. His fingers twitched against the polished mahogany table. "If he can't—"

Alexander cut him off, voice like shattering glass. "This isn't just any project. It's Sterling Corporation's crown jewel."

"Years of strategic planning rest on its success. Failure wouldn't merely tarnish our reputation—it would cripple future ventures." His piercing stare pinned Lawrence in place. "Does your son possess the competence for such responsibility?"

"And if our competitors secure what we lose?" Alexander leaned forward slightly. "Who shoulders that catastrophe? Did you imagine consequences could be swept aside so easily?"

The air grew heavier. Even breathing seemed too loud. Should Kensington Group claim this deal, Sterling Corporation's standing would plummet, triggering a domino effect of lost partnerships.

The entire company's trajectory could shift into decline. Could Lawrence Whitmore possibly bear that weight? His complexion turned ashen.

He'd assumed Alexander might show leniency given his decades of service.

But the CEO had laid bare the stakes. All eyes burned into Lawrence now. Would he retreat or double down? The clock ticked audibly.

Evelyn checked her watch discreetly, mentally calculating how soon she could escape for her spa appointment.

"I'll stake everything on it!" Lawrence's sudden declaration cut through the tension, his voice rough with conviction. "Damian won't fail. But if he does, I'll surrender all my shares and resign immediately."

Gasps rippled through the room. As Sterling Corporation's second-largest shareholder, Lawrence's influence rivaled William Sterling's. His reputation among investors was impeccable.

And he was gambling it all? Evelyn studied him curiously. Determination etched deep lines into his face, but what fueled such blind faith?

Alexander's mouth quirked.

"Not enough." His fingers steepled. "Should Damian fail, he'll be barred from any Sterling affiliate—globally—in perpetuity."

Lawrence's eyelids flickered. Then, jaw clenched: "Agreed."

Alexander's gaze shifted to Evelyn. "We'll hedge our bets with dual leadership. Evelyn, you'll co-lead this project. Consider it... professional cross-training."

Evelyn's manicured nails stilled against her tablet. Her head snapped up. Why was she being dragged into this mess?

Lawrence scowled at her before turning back to Alexander. "How do we determine victory?" His finger jabbed toward Evelyn. "If she loses, does she walk away too?"

Alexander's glare could have flash-frozen the Mediterranean.

Before he could respond, Evelyn straightened her blazer and smiled sweetly. "Naturally. May the best executive win."
###Chapter 350 Not Good Enough for Me

Lawrence Whitmore's lips curled into a smirk, his eyes gleaming with reckless confidence.

"Perfect! It's settled then." The meeting concluded abruptly. As the room emptied, only Evelyn Sinclair and Alexander Sterling remained.

Alexander rubbed his temples in frustration. "I never intended for you to make that wager with him!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "We're past that point now, aren't we? Besides, you're the one who dragged me into this mess." Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "His son's a complete disgrace - we can't possibly rely on him just because of some bet."

"I involved you because I genuinely need your expertise on this project." Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Tell me, why do you despise Lawrence Whitmore's son so much?"

Alexander's expression darkened. "That spoiled brat seduced one of our junior executives and caused a massive scandal. Our company nearly trended for all the wrong reasons because of him." He clenched his fists. "Do you have any idea how much damage control that cost me? And the idiot still doesn't understand what he did wrong - now he's harassing someone in our finance department."

"Lawrence kept covering for him, making everything worse." Evelyn's smile vanished. "So he's that kind of scumbag? Serves him right then."

Evelyn studied Bennett intently. "Do we have the Wall Street investor's profile?" Bennett nodded and handed her a file.

Her smile froze when she opened it. "This is blank!" Alexander coughed awkwardly and made a hasty exit. "We've hit a dead end."

"Probably using a pseudonym too," Bennett added. "You'll need to dig deeper." Evelyn groaned internally.

Did I just walk into a trap? Bennett chuckled beside her. "Just say the word if you need backup, Ms. Sinclair." Evelyn fixed him with a piercing gaze.

"Why is Lawrence so confident about securing this project? He's betting everything on it." She tapped the empty file. "There must be something we're missing."

Bennett shook his head helplessly. "No leads yet. I'll investigate immediately." Evelyn's curiosity burned. Who is this mystery player?

Her phone buzzed - Adrian Blackwood calling. "What's up, Addy?"

"Nikki, we're celebrating at the Phantom Lounge tonight. You in?" Just as Evelyn was about to accept, a thought struck her - Nathan Blackwood would likely attend as the main sponsor.

Adrian sensed her hesitation. "Relax, Uncle Nathan won't be there. He's throwing Gregory Thornton a bachelor party - apparently the girl's pregnant and they're having a shotgun wedding!" His laughter echoed through the phone.

Evelyn couldn't help but chuckle. "Count me in!" Hanging up, she immediately dialed Isabella Montgomery. "Did your mother finally give up on that arranged marriage with Gregory?"

Isabella snorted. "He's beneath me! Ever since you helped me get those photos, Mother's been reconsidering. Now the Thorntons have their own drama to deal with."

Evelyn grinned. "I heard he fell for some penniless girl and disgraced his family. Who knows what's true?"

Isabella exhaled in relief. "Divine intervention! No wonder they've been so secretive. Now I can finally breathe." Her voice turned playful. "Actually, I've met someone... but I'll tell you later. Mother's checking on me!" The line went dead.

Evelyn laughed as she prepared for the evening. The project could wait until Bennett uncovered Lawrence's secret advantage. For now, she had a celebration to attend.
###Chapter 351 No Need to Swear on It

The city sparkled like a jewel box at night.

Phantom Lounge pulsed with energy and laughter.

Evelyn Sinclair stepped out of her car with effortless grace. Her casual ensemble - an oversized designer tee paired with a micro mini - accentuated her mile-long legs. Heads turned as she moved through the crowd.

Inside the VIP section, Adrian Blackwood was spraying Dom Pérignon like a firehose while chasing Ethan Caldwell around the room. The scene was chaotic yet festive.

Julian Moreau sat conversing with the director, looking relaxed in his tailored suit. His face lit up when he spotted Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair! You made it!"

The director and others greeted her warmly. Several unfamiliar faces - likely Adrian's fellow adventurers - nodded in acknowledgment.

Sophia Laurent sat isolated in a shadowy corner.

Her sequined gown and full glam makeup seemed better suited for a red carpet than a casual celebration.

No one paid her any attention.

After the bungee jumping incident where the audience voted her off the platform, Sophia finally understood her unpopularity.

She regretted her blatant targeting of Evelyn during filming. When she'd climbed back up, trembling from the jump, the crew had simply packed up without checking on her.

Sophia only attended this wrap party to secure her spot in the next season.

Though her reputation had taken hits and she'd lost endorsements, she remained relevant. Missing this show would be career suicide!

Watching Evelyn's effortless popularity made Sophia's chest tighten with envy. "It's just her family's money," she muttered.

When Ethan stepped out to take a call, Adrian dragged Evelyn aside. "Ethan says he's skipping next season. Wants to track elephant migrations in Botswana."

Evelyn glanced at the brooding explorer nursing his drink alone. She gave an approving thumbs-up. "Danger magnet as always."

Ethan rolled his eyes and stalked out.

"Drink?" Adrian asked. Evelyn considered. "A bottle of Château d'Yquem '45, please." She'd been craving its honeyed notes.

Adrian's smile faltered. "Trying to bankrupt me?"

"Oh right." Evelyn chuckled. "Forgot about your trust fund restrictions. My treat tonight. Order whatever you like."

Adrian exhaled in relief. "Thank God I got over my crush on you. The humiliation would've killed me." He grinned. "One bottle enough?"

Laughter and clinking glasses filled the air until Ethan burst back in, face stormy. He grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

"I need your help."

Before she could protest, he'd pulled her into the hallway.

"What's wrong?"

Ethan leaned against the floor-to-ceiling windows, jaw working. His usual confidence had evaporated.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Spit it out or I'm going back."

"Will you be my girlfriend?"

Her eyebrows shot up. Ethan quickly amended, "Fake girlfriend."

Suspicion darkened her features. "What's your game?"

Ethan's gaze remained startlingly clear. "Want me to swear on my mother's grave?"

Her stance softened slightly. "Why the charade?"

Ethan's knuckles whitened on the windowsill. "I just saw my dead ex."

"The one who drained your accounts?"

His face flushed crimson. "That bastard Adrian told you?"

"Who else?" Evelyn smirked, unrepentant.

Ethan shook his head - revenge took priority over settling scores with Adrian.

"She's here for her bachelorette party. I need to... congratulate her."

Evelyn studied his murderous expression. "Do you though?"

The words exploded from him. "She cheated with my business partner! Stole my money to buy him watches! When I confronted her, she wiped out my accounts!"

The veins in his neck stood out like cables. Evelyn had never seen the unflappable explorer so unraveled.

"Fine," she sighed. "But you're buying me another bottle of that Sauternes."

Ethan's grin was all sharp edges. "Deal."
###Chapter 352 Stay and Sit

Ethan Caldwell was fuming, his anger so palpable it felt like steam was rising from his head.

How utterly pathetic!

Evelyn Sinclair pressed her lips together, casting a sympathetic glance at Ethan. "Then we should congratulate her properly."

After all, this was just a small favor—nothing more, nothing less.

"But...am I really the right person for this?"

Ethan gave her a once-over. "You're filthy rich."

That alone would be enough to drive that woman insane.

Evelyn smirked. "Hah. What a compelling reason."

Without warning, Ethan grabbed Evelyn's hand and pulled her down the long corridor, stopping outside a private room not far from theirs.

The door was slightly ajar, allowing the sounds of laughter and music to spill out.

"Mel, you're the first one in our group to get married! How did you manage to wrap Gregory Thornton around your finger like this?"

"Girls, you don’t know yet—Mel’s already pregnant! If they don’t hurry up with the wedding, she won’t fit into her dress..."

"Seriously?! Double congratulations!"

"Make sure you keep a tight grip on his wallet!"

Evelyn felt her eyelid twitch. She turned to Ethan, whose expression looked like he’d just swallowed something vile.

She bit her lip. "Should we still go in?"

Ethan scoffed. "Absolutely."

With that, he pushed the door open, his face instantly transforming into a charming, playful smile. His other hand rested lightly on Evelyn’s shoulder, the picture of a perfect gentleman.

They looked very cozy.

Evelyn played along perfectly, gasping softly. "Oh no! We must have the wrong room!"

Her voice was sweet and melodic, devoid of any coldness, effortlessly drawing every eye in the room.

Ethan paused, feigning surprise as he scanned the crowd. His gaze landed on Melanie, who was surrounded by admirers. A flicker of dark amusement flashed in his eyes.

"What a coincidence! Isn’t this an old friend?"

The way he said "old friend" was laced with venom.

Melanie, dressed to impress, had been basking in the envy and praise of her friends.

Women like her were a dime a dozen around wealthy men like Gregory Thornton, but few ever climbed to the top.

She was about to be one of them.

Melanie had been floating on cloud nine—until she saw Ethan Caldwell.

Her blood ran cold.

Gregory knew nothing about her past. None of them did.

A few of her friends recognized Evelyn and Ethan from their appearances on a popular reality show.

"Ms. Sinclair! What a surprise! Mr. Caldwell, you know Melanie?"

Ethan’s smile turned sly. "Oh, we know each other very well..."

Melanie’s face stiffened, her heart freezing in her chest.

Evelyn smiled. The woman who had spoken looked vaguely familiar—probably someone she’d seen at a party or event before, judging by her designer outfit.

"Yes, what’s the occasion?"

"It’s Melanie’s bachelorette party before she marries Gregory Thornton! Since you’re here, why don’t you join us?"

Having Evelyn at their party would be a major social coup.

Evelyn studied Melanie—plain, unremarkable, the kind of face you’d forget in a crowd.

She smiled sweetly, tugging at Ethan’s sleeve with playful affection. Her voice was soft, almost teasing.

"Let’s stay for a bit! It looks fun..."

Ethan gazed at her with exaggerated fondness. "Whatever you want, darling."

The room erupted in silent shock.

Their interaction was far from platonic.

A few people exchanged glances, their expressions shifting. Someone couldn’t resist asking, "Wait—are you two together now?"

###Chapter 353 The Wealthy Woman He's With

Evelyn smiled and slipped her arm through Ethan's, deliberately avoiding answering the question.

Her silence spoke volumes to everyone present.

The way Ethan's hand rested possessively on her shoulder told them everything they needed to know.

No man touched a woman like that unless they were involved.

The private room fell into an uneasy hush.

Sophia's face twisted in fury. She suddenly lifted a trembling finger, pointing accusingly at Evelyn.

Her voice was laced with venom.

"So, this is the rich woman you've been cozying up to?"

The moment those cutting words left her lips, the excited chatter among the women died instantly. It was too late to stop Sophia now.

Sophia knew Ethan wouldn't let her off easily. The simmering rage in his eyes had been there since the moment he spotted her.

She needed to wound him first—to humiliate him before he could strike back.

"Are you really so desperate that you'd sell yourself like this?"

All eyes darted to Evelyn, waiting for her reaction.

Evelyn kept her smile perfectly in place. She was just here to play her part. Ethan would handle the rest.

"Sophia, how could you say that about Ms. Sinclair's companion?"

One of Sophia's friends panicked, discreetly tugging at her sleeve. She shot a nervous glance at Evelyn, silently warning Sophia to watch her words.

Especially since that companion was Evelyn Sinclair.

Sophia paled as realization struck. In her desperation to humiliate Ethan, she'd forgotten who she was dealing with.

Just as she opened her mouth to backtrack, Ethan let out a cold laugh.

"I'm desperate? At least I'm not the one marrying a man while carrying another's child."

The tension in the room thickened. Confused whispers spread as the guests tried to piece together the history between Ethan and Sophia.

Sophia's breath hitched.

If Ethan and Evelyn were together, why wasn’t he afraid of her finding out about their past?

Her eyes flickered with calculation, but Ethan didn’t give her a chance to speak.

"I heard congratulations are in order. A wedding tomorrow, isn’t it?"

His tone was deceptively light, but his gaze was lethal.

"But before you walk down the aisle, how about returning what you owe me? My girlfriend doesn’t like my money being in another woman’s hands."

Sophia’s face drained of color. The guests exchanged uneasy glances, sensing this was far more complicated than a simple lovers' quarrel.

Evelyn smirked, then deliberately turned to Sophia with feigned curiosity.

"Why is your money with her, Ethan?"

Before Ethan could respond, a cold voice cut through the room.

"Evelyn, did you bring someone here to cause trouble?"

Gregory Thornton stood in the doorway, his expression dark with restrained fury. If not for Evelyn’s connections, he would’ve had her thrown out immediately.

Behind him stood Tristan Whitmore and Nathan Blackwood.

Evelyn’s breath caught at the sight of Nathan.

His face was like a storm, his eyes dark and turbulent. Emotions raged beneath the surface, barely contained.

Had he heard everything?

For a brief moment, Evelyn faltered—then she schooled her expression into indifference.

She met Gregory’s glare.

"Trouble? We’re just old friends catching up."

She had never liked Gregory. If this ruined his precious wedding, so be it.

As for Nathan? She refused to acknowledge him.

Gregory’s sharp gaze flicked to Ethan.

"Old friends? Doesn’t look like it."

Sophia seized the opportunity, rushing to Gregory’s side with a pitiful whimper.

"Gregory, I didn’t mean to offend Ms. Sinclair or Mr. Caldwell. I just spoke without thinking..."
###Chapter 354 Spending to Get Closer to You

Evelyn Sinclair arched a delicate brow, her lips curling into a knowing smirk as she glanced at Ethan Caldwell.

"We didn’t come here to ruin your bachelor party," she said smoothly. "We’ll leave as soon as he gets what’s owed to him."

Ethan let out a low chuckle, but before he could respond, Celeste Rousseau cut in, her voice trembling with suppressed fury.

"Mr. Caldwell," she hissed, "whatever disagreements we had in the past, this is my engagement celebration. My fiancé is Gregory Thornton, heir to the Thornton Group. His friends are all influential figures. Do you really think you can afford to make enemies here?"

The thinly veiled threat hung in the air—a warning that Ethan was out of his depth.

Evelyn’s amusement deepened. So, the docile facade had cracks after all.

Even Gregory seemed taken aback by Celeste’s sudden aggression. She had always played the sweet, demure fiancée.

The room fell silent.

Someone had even cut the music.

Ethan, however, remained unfazed. If anything, his smirk only grew more pronounced.

"Threatening me?" He scoffed. "You always thought I was just some broke explorer, didn’t you? That’s why you stole my money and ran off to latch onto a trust-fund baby?"

"Shut up!"

"What?"

Celeste and Gregory spoke at the same time—one in panic, the other in stunned disbelief.

Celeste clutched Gregory’s arm desperately. "Gregory, don’t listen to him! He’s lying! I don’t even know him! After everything we’ve been through, you trust me, don’t you?"

Gregory’s tense expression softened slightly, swayed by her pleading.

But Ethan’s laughter turned sharp, edged with bitterness.

"Mr. Thornton, take my advice—don’t be as gullible as I was. If you believe her, you’re just the next fool in line."

Gregory’s face darkened.

On one side stood Celeste, the woman he’d painstakingly wooed.

On the other stood Ethan Caldwell, standing beside Evelyn Sinclair.

Logic told him not to trust anyone associated with Evelyn. But instinct whispered that something was off.

Gregory gave Celeste’s hand a reassuring squeeze before fixing Ethan with a cold glare.

"You’d better have proof for what you’re accusing her of. If this is slander, I won’t let it slide—no matter who’s backing you."

His gaze flickered briefly to Evelyn, a silent warning.

Ethan didn’t flinch.

"That tie clip she gave you? The $60,000 one?" He smirked. "She bought it with my money—before we even broke up. Did she tell you she worked hard for it? Studied late nights?" His tone was flat, matter-of-fact.

Gregory stiffened.

Because that was exactly what Celeste had claimed.

Celeste paled. "Gregory, don’t—"

Evelyn’s cool voice cut through the tension. "What’s wrong? Too guilty to let him hear the rest?"

Celeste’s breath hitched. When she met Evelyn’s gaze, it felt like staring into a blade—sharp, unrelenting.

She looked away instantly.

Ethan continued, unfazed. "Don’t take my word for it, Mr. Thornton. Check the records. Every gift—scarves, watches, even that ridiculous gold-plated mug—came from my account. While I was on assignment, she drained $300,000 from my card. Thought that was all I had. Took the money and left."

A beat of silence.

Then—

"Celeste," Gregory said slowly, his voice dangerously calm. "Is this true?"
###Chapter 355 You're Not a Poor Man

Ethan Caldwell's piercing gaze locked onto Celeste Rousseau, the woman who had once played him for a fool. Back then, he had genuinely believed he was at fault and had rushed to apologize like a lovesick puppy.

But what had he found instead?

Celeste and Gregory Thornton, flirting shamelessly as they strolled out of a hotel suite, fingers intertwined. The familiarity between them made it painfully obvious—this wasn’t their first rendezvous.

Later, when Ethan had tried to confront her, Celeste had vanished without a trace, transferring colleges like a ghost in the night.

She had ghosted him.

To Ethan, Celeste Rousseau was dead.

A permanent stain on his pride.

Now, the crowd’s shocked eyes darted between Celeste and Ethan, absorbing the explosive drama unfolding on the eve of Celeste and Gregory’s wedding.

This was scandalous.

Gregory’s fists clenched, his knuckles turning white. A chilling darkness flickered in his eyes, his entire body rigid with tension. No one could guess what storm brewed beneath his carefully controlled exterior.

Celeste clutched his arm desperately. "Gregory, I swear, I never lied to you! I love you—only you!"

Gregory remained stone-faced, his expression colder than ice.

Panicked, Celeste whirled on Ethan.

"It was just a few hundred thousand dollars! Are you really so petty that you’d ruin my happiness over money? What, did you expect me to pay you emotional damages after we broke up?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The sheer audacity!

Eyes wide with disbelief, the guests watched as Celeste trembled with rage, jabbing a finger at Ethan. "You wanted to marry me back then? With what money? Did you expect me to live like a pauper?" She scoffed, her gaze flickering to Evelyn Sinclair. "And look at you now—leeching off some rich woman. How are you any better than me?"

Evelyn smirked, her sharp eyes glinting. "So you cheated and dumped Ethan because Gregory was richer? Is that what you call a 'normal' choice?"

Celeste’s face paled the moment the words left her mouth.

She turned stiffly toward Gregory, whose expression had darkened into something terrifying. The warmth he usually reserved for her had vanished, replaced by something far more dangerous.

Gregory Thornton was not a gentle man by nature. Celeste’s supposed sweetness had softened him, made him believe in love.

But it had all been a lie.

The air thickened with tension. The soon-to-be Mrs. Thornton was nothing but a gold-digging fraud.

Ethan exhaled, a weight lifting from his chest.

No matter how well Celeste had played her role, the truth always surfaced. And tonight, it had come crashing down spectacularly.

Her frantic, unraveling expression was almost pitiful. Ethan chuckled, a lightness in his voice.

"Well, I suppose I was just unlucky. Consider that money charity—feeding a stray, if you will." He tilted his head, feigning thought. "Oh, and congratulations on the pregnancy. A shotgun wedding? Bold move. No wonder you outmaneuvered all those other socialites."

The implication was clear.

Celeste’s pregnancy had been a calculated play.

Her face twisted in fury. Gregory stiffened, realization dawning.

The woman he thought carried his child had trapped him.

Gregory’s jaw tightened, his glare shifting between Celeste and Ethan. "Are you done?" he ground out, voice laced with barely restrained fury.

Ethan smirked, draping an arm around Evelyn’s shoulders.

With a mock bow, he said, "Forgive the interruption. We wouldn’t want to spoil the festivities. Happy wedding!"

The crowd erupted in murmurs. How could anyone recover from this?

Evelyn leaned into Ethan, her lips curving.

"By the way," she added sweetly, "allow me to properly introduce Ethan Caldwell. He’s hardly a 'poor man.' He’s the sole heir to Sterling Worldwide—you know, the company behind SportiveWear? Their operations are primarily overseas, so perhaps that’s why you missed it, Celeste." She paused, emphasizing her next words. "So no, he’s not with me for money."

The room went silent.

Celeste’s face drained of color.

Game over.
###Chapter 356 Is This Some Kind of Joke?

Evelyn's revelation hit the crowd like a thunderbolt.

Sterling Worldwide's global dominance made Thornton Enterprises look like small potatoes in comparison.

Celeste's face drained of color, her eyes widening in horrified realization.

She'd thrown away a diamond while chasing after cheap rhinestones.

The others exchanged stunned glances, their expressions a mix of shock and disbelief.

Who would've guessed such an influential heir would hide his status so completely?

Evelyn didn't bother with their reactions. She simply followed Ethan out of the VIP lounge.

The moment the door closed behind them, a deafening crash echoed from inside - the sound of glass shattering against the wall, followed by Celeste's hysterical sobs.

When they reached the corridor's end, both exhaled sharply and simultaneously dropped each other's hands. Their eyes met with knowing smiles.

"How did you know about my family background?" Ethan couldn't hide his surprise at her earlier revelation.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Natalie told me."

Ethan muttered a curse under his breath. "That little-"

"Hey, it served its purpose," Evelyn countered. "No point hiding it now."

Ethan shrugged, unconcerned.

Before they could reach their private booth, measured footsteps approached from behind. A voice like chilled steel stopped them in their tracks.

"Leaving so soon?"

Nathan Blackwood.

They turned to face him. Evelyn crossed her arms. "Shouldn't you be comforting your friend, Mr. Blackwood? What brings you chasing after us?"

Gregory Thornton had finally gotten his comeuppance, but Nathan's stormy expression suggested he wasn't here about that. His gaze flicked to Ethan with predatory intensity. "You came here to make a scene deliberately."

It wasn't a question.

Ethan remained impassive, neither confirming nor denying.

Nathan's glacial stare returned to Evelyn. "I don't care about petty dramas. I'm here about you." His voice dropped dangerously low. "And him."

Nathan hadn't come to defend Gregory - Tristan had dragged him to this bachelor party against his will.

But seeing Evelyn enter that room hand-in-hand with Ethan, their effortless chemistry and unspoken understanding - it ignited something primal in Nathan. A possessiveness he couldn't control.

Evelyn sighed. "Nathan, don't you think you're overstepping?"

"Not at all." His response came without hesitation.

Nathan had always assumed no man could rival his place in Evelyn's life. Yet seeing Ethan standing there, receiving her public acknowledgment - it sent jealousy clawing through his chest with razor-sharp talons.

For the first time in his life, Nathan Blackwood felt genuine panic.

His attention snapped back to Ethan. The air between them crackled with barely restrained violence. "Is this real?"

The unspoken threat hung heavy - if Ethan answered wrong, Nathan would destroy him without hesitation.

Ethan glanced at Evelyn. "That's for her to say."

Before Evelyn could respond, Nathan's voice cut through like a blade. "Mr. Caldwell, give us a moment alone."

Ethan stiffened. The sudden shift in Nathan's demeanor was terrifying - like staring into the eyes of a predator moments before it struck. Yet outwardly, Nathan remained the picture of aristocratic composure.

Evelyn gave Ethan a reassuring nod. "I'll catch up with you later."

With a final assessing look at Nathan, Ethan walked away. He wasn't worried - the way Nathan looked at Evelyn left no doubt about his feelings.

An oppressive silence settled between them, broken only by muffled sobs from Gregory's party. The corridor's alcove shielded them from view.

"So this is how you replace me?" Nathan's voice was raw, the words scraping from his throat like broken glass.

Evelyn's breath caught. The pain hit like an electric current - sharp, sudden, and utterly paralyzing.
###Chapter 357 The Performance of a Lifetime

Nathan's words struck Evelyn like a dagger to the heart.

Why was she feeling this way for Nathan Blackwood? She pressed her lips together, blinking rapidly as a sharp sting pricked behind her eyes.

No. She wouldn't let this weakness take hold.

Lifting her chin, she met his gaze with deliberate coldness.

"Good. At least you understand."

His eyes were bloodshot, his lips pressed into a thin line. The proud, commanding figure she knew so well now stood before her, radiating a loneliness that made her chest ache.

He had tried threats—she hadn't flinched.

He had shown vulnerability—she hadn't softened.

Against Evelyn Sinclair, Nathan Blackwood was utterly powerless.

A commotion outside the private room drew Tristan Whitmore rushing in.

"Blackwood, hurry! Gregory's dragging Celeste to the hospital— Oh. Evelyn's still here?"

She offered him a faint, polite smile before turning on her heel.

Her retreating figure was unyielding, her steps decisive.

Nathan could only see the ice in her eyes—the indifference that had shattered him.

He didn't shout. Didn't lose control.

Outwardly, he was composed.

But his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white, veins standing stark against his skin.

Tristan called his name, but Nathan didn't move.

He didn't need to. Tristan could already guess what had happened.

Just as he opened his mouth to offer some semblance of comfort, Nathan turned abruptly and strode away.

Tristan called after him, but the storm brewing in Nathan's eyes made him hesitate.

Before he could follow, another scream erupted from Gregory's private room.

With a curse, Tristan rushed back inside.

Evelyn returned to Adrian's private room. The moment Ethan Caldwell saw her expression, he knew Nathan had lost this round.

In love, the one who fell first always loved harder.

Adrian had indeed ordered a bottle of vintage Château d'Yquem for her, but she had no appetite for it now.

All she could think about was the raw pain in Nathan's eyes.

Had she gone too far?

But sooner or later, he would have to accept reality. She would move on. He would marry someone else.

Gregory's private room was several doors down, far enough that the noise didn't reach them.

What no one realized was that the building's layout twisted in an irregular S-shape. Their balcony was actually adjacent to Gregory's.

Needing air, Evelyn stepped outside.

From the neighboring balcony, Tristan caught sight of her and immediately ducked behind the curtains.

Now was not the time to face Her Majesty.

Ethan joined her, handing her a glass of the prized wine.

"Bad mood?"

She accepted it with a wry smile, watching the city lights blur through the evening fog.

"Not as good as yours, apparently."

Ethan chuckled. "Right. Because you played your part flawlessly."

He raised his glass, clinking it lightly against hers before downing it in one go.

Evelyn took a sip. The wine was rich, velvety, with just the right sweetness. It lingered on her tongue, warm and intoxicating.

"You weren't bad either. We made quite the convincing couple."

Perhaps anger had fueled his performance.

Hidden behind the curtains, Tristan's legs nearly gave out from sheer panic.

After what felt like an eternity, the two finally left the balcony.

Trembling, Tristan fumbled for his phone and sent the recording to Nathan.

Finally, the man could rest easy.

Nathan's phone lit up with the notification. He tapped it.

Ethan's voice came through first.

"Right. Because you played your part flawlessly."

Then Evelyn's.

"You weren't bad either. We made quite the convincing couple."

The clink of glasses.

Nathan froze.

He replayed it. Again. And again.

The suffocating weight in his chest dissolved. The storm in his eyes cleared.

A slow, triumphant smirk curved his lips.

A fake relationship.

Leaning back in the car seat, he exhaled deeply, finally relaxed.

Then his eyes snapped open.

"Harrison," he ordered the driver. "Turn the car around."

If it was all an act, then Ethan Caldwell was no threat at all.

The tempest inside Nathan had vanished, replaced by clear skies.

"Yes, sir." The driver didn't dare delay.
###Chapter 358 A Surprise Wedding Change

Evelyn Sinclair had stayed up past 1:00 am playing poker with her friends, winning round after round.

She knew they were letting her win on purpose, but the thrill of victory kept her going.

Only when she saw Victor Kensington's exhausted dark circles and pitiful losing expression did she finally call it a night.

The next morning, Evelyn slept in late, having wisely locked Leo out of her room to prevent any disturbances.

Sunlight crept across her face, but she simply rolled over and buried herself deeper into the blankets.

Then her phone rang.

Damn! I forgot to silence it!

The persistent ringing forced her to answer irritably. The caller ID made her groan.

"Isabella Montgomery, do you have a personal vendetta against my beauty sleep?"

Isabella paused for a beat before bursting into laughter.

"Do you know what you've missed while sleeping like a log?"

"What?"

"Gregory Thornton's wedding! With a completely different bride!"

Evelyn sat up abruptly, sleep vanishing instantly. "What?"

"Apparently his fiancée's ex showed up at the bachelor party last night. No one knows what was said, but Gregory dragged her to the hospital and discovered she wasn't even pregnant!"

Isabella kept pouring the shocking details faster than Evelyn could process them.

"Now he's marrying some heiress from Boston who's been chasing him for years. She's from old money - not as wealthy as the Thorntons, but definitely better than that gold-digging ex."

Evelyn's drowsiness evaporated completely. Isabella didn't know Evelyn had been with that ex-boyfriend last night.

She never expected their confrontation would cause such a dramatic chain reaction.

Evelyn had assumed Gregory would simply call off the wedding when he learned the truth.

Not fake a pregnancy test. Not replace his bride overnight.

Clearly, Gregory had absolutely no intention of forgiving Celeste Rousseau.

Evelyn bit her lip. "How is this new bride even willing to marry him after all this?"

Isabella scoffed. "Willing? She practically threw herself at him! The Thorntons couldn't find anyone in our circles willing to marry their disgrace of a son. Everyone knows what a train wreck Gregory is."

Evelyn fell silent. That much was true.

After chatting a few more minutes, Evelyn finally dragged herself out of bed.

By noon, she planned to grab lunch near the office before meeting Bennett to discuss Preston Sinclair's investigation. Halfway there, Bennett called - Preston had unexpectedly appeared at San Francisco University.

Without hesitation, Evelyn changed course toward the campus.

The buzz about the Wall Street tycoon made him easy to locate - he was giving a lecture to students.

She rushed to the auditorium only to freeze in the doorway.

Every seat was taken, with students even standing along the walls and sitting in the aisles.

Apparently everyone wanted to glimpse this legendary financial wizard.

Evelyn hesitated, uncertain whether to push through the crowd. Then a familiar deep voice called out.

"Evelyn, over here."

She looked up to see Nathan Blackwood seated front and center, his custom Tom Ford suit and Patek Philippe watch marking him as distinctly out of place among the students.

An empty seat beside him seemed almost sacred in its isolation.

For two heartbeats she hesitated. Then business instincts won over personal feelings.

Money, after all, was money.

"Why are you here?" she asked, her tone sharper than intended.
###Chapter 359 The Sudden Change in His Demeanor

Nathan's lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. "The same reason you're here, darling."

Business alliances were always about mutual interests. Their target was identical - Preston Sinclair.

Evelyn moved closer, settling into the seat beside him. His crisp bergamot cologne enveloped her senses.

Their striking presence drew admiring glances. To onlookers, they appeared as the perfect power couple.

"Mr. Blackwood, surely this matter doesn't require your personal attention?"

"And yet here you are in person, Ms. Sinclair." His voice dropped to that velvety baritone that never failed to send shivers down her spine.

Evelyn studied his profile. The usual icy composure remained, but something was... different.

Where was the broken man with bloodshot eyes from yesterday?

Why did he seem completely unaffected now?

As if sensing her scrutiny, Nathan turned. His gaze softened when it met hers. "Enjoying the view?"

Evelyn blinked, then rolled her eyes dramatically. "Your arrogance knows no bounds."

Nathan's smile deepened - a rare sight that would shock anyone who knew him.

"Feel free to look your fill. I don't mind at all."

"Someone should teach you the meaning of humility," Evelyn muttered, turning away sharply.

A rich chuckle rumbled from his chest. Oddly, he seemed delighted by her sharp tongue. Today she'd spoken more than two words to him - progress.

Nearby students gaped openly. This was the same man who'd frozen earlier intruders with a single glacial stare.

Yet now he was practically purring for Evelyn Sinclair.

Was it her beauty that melted the infamous Ice King?

While Evelyn huffed insults, Nathan absorbed every word with visible pleasure.

Their charged dynamic crackled with unspoken tension.

After ten awkward minutes, a professor entered with disappointing news. "Mr. Sinclair had to leave campus unexpectedly. You're all dismissed."

Groans filled the room as students shuffled out.

Evelyn rose with a sigh. As she reached the exit, an overeager undergrad bumped into her.

She stumbled forward - only to be caught by a familiar strong arm. She recognized the platinum watch before even looking up.

Nathan steadied her, then positioned his broad frame to block the doorway. His piercing gaze locked onto the offender with terrifying intensity.

The crowd froze. The guilty student trembled under Nathan's silent wrath.

"P-please forgive me! I didn't mean—"

Evelyn offered a conciliatory smile. "It's fine. Just be more careful."

Nathan finally stepped aside, but no one dared move until Evelyn exited first. She could feel his presence following at a respectful distance.

As they neared campus gates, Evelyn quickened her pace.

"Have lunch with me," Nathan called.

"My appetite disappears in your company."

A beat of silence. Then that infuriating smirk returned. "And who does inspire your appetite?"

Evelyn couldn't resist twisting the knife. "My new boyfriend, naturally!"

Let's see how Mr. Arrogant handles that.
###Chapter 360 Don't Cry

Evelyn's words hung in the air between them. Nathan's expression froze momentarily.

The hesitation lasted barely a heartbeat.

A slow smile curved his lips as he reached up, fingers poised to tuck a windblown strand of hair behind her ear.

Evelyn jerked her head away before he could make contact. His hand dropped back to his side.

His voice came out rough and low, yet his gaze remained unbearably tender.

"Is that so? Well... That doesn't change my invitation to lunch."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Why did this man cling to her like gum on a designer shoe?

"I have no interest in dining with you, Mr. Blackwood. Show some dignity."

Nathan's eyes crinkled at the corners, his smile widening. The rich timbre of his voice wrapped around her like velvet.

"Dignity is overrated."

Evelyn's chest constricted with irritation. She spun on her heel, refusing to waste another breath on this infuriating man.

The shadows in Nathan's eyes lifted as he called after her, voice laced with amusement.

"Lunch?"

"Go to hell!"

Nathan's next words stopped her mid-stride. "I know exactly what Preston Sinclair and Lawrence Whitmore are hiding."

Evelyn turned back without missing a beat, her change of heart shamelessly immediate.

"Fine. Let's eat."

Nathan's slow, triumphant smile made her want to punch him. The way his dimples appeared when he was pleased was downright criminal.

She'd expected a quick meal at some corporate bistro. Instead, Nathan drove them clear across Manhattan to Le Ciel Bleu - the impossible-to-book private dining club with a three-month waiting list.

The host ushered them directly to the secluded terrace. Nathan pulled out her chair with exaggerated courtesy.

Evelyn sat stiffly as he handed her the menu.

"Order whatever you like."

She shoved it back without glancing at the pages. "The most expensive tasting menu."

Nathan didn't blink, simply nodding to the waiter before rattling off additional requests in fluent French.

Evelyn studied the tranquil koi pond beyond the glass walls. Delicate paper lanterns swayed beneath the eaves, their crimson glow painting the water with shifting patterns. Wind chimes sang a crystalline melody in the breeze.

Every detail whispered of meticulous craftsmanship.

"How did you know I'm investigating Preston and Lawrence?"

Nathan lifted the porcelain teapot, pouring with ceremonial precision. Jasmine-scented steam curled between them.

"Hardly a state secret. The boardroom gossip reached my office before your assistant's memo did."

Evelyn suppressed a groan. Of course.

"Let me guess - Blackwood Enterprises wants Preston too?"

Nathan's eyebrow arched. "Would I be here if we didn't?"

"I'll share what I know, but don't expect me to hand him over." Evelyn's fingers tightened around her cup. "If I lose Sterling Corporation, will you gloat?"

Nathan's lips twitched. "Why so defensive? You're acting like I've already won."

"If you lose," he continued, gaze softening, "it means you succeeded. I'd celebrate for you."

Evelyn snorted. "Bullshit."

"Seriously though..." He leaned forward. "If Sterling lets you go, come to Blackwood Enterprises. Any position you want."

Was this man actually trying to poach her?

Evelyn tilted her head. "What position outranks CEO?"

"The CEO's wife."

Her teacup clattered against the saucer. A bitter laugh escaped her.

"Three years of marriage and your receptionist still carded me at the elevator. Only starry-eyed interns fall for your lines now."

His words didn't stir her heart - they ignited her temper.

The cruelest irony? That same receptionist never questioned Vanessa Holloway's comings and goings. Vanessa had flaunted her access for years, each smirk another twist of the knife.

All those small indignities reminded Evelyn why distance was survival where Nathan Blackwood was concerned.
###Chapter 361 This Game Won't Fool Me

Nathan Blackwood remained silent for an uncomfortably long moment. His piercing gaze held a bitterness that made his chest constrict painfully.

Breathing became an effort.

During Evelyn Sinclair's marriage to him, she had never received the respect she was owed.

Each recollection of this truth left him gasping for air.

Evelyn had long since stopped dwelling on those insignificant memories. She understood now that those three years had been nothing but her own foolish fantasy. Only sheer determination had carried her through that dark period.

The past was dead to her. She wanted it buried forever.

Nathan's intense stare burned into her. His dark eyes were pools of regret. Seeing her casual indifference as she spoke made his lungs seize again.

His fists clenched until his knuckles whitened. "It won't... happen again," he forced out.

Nathan vowed silently to always put her first now, to cherish her properly. He'd never take her for granted again.

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes.

There would be no future between them.

She had clarity now. Nathan Blackwood would never again hold her heart.

She lifted her teacup and took a deliberate sip.

"Get to the point."

After all, she hadn't come here to listen to his maudlin regrets.

Nathan lowered his lashes, brow furrowing slightly. He took only a moment to compose himself before looking up.

"The reason Lawrence Whitmore is so confident," he began smoothly, "is his connection."

Nathan met Evelyn's gaze squarely. "Preston Sinclair's butler."

Evelyn's brows shot up. "Butler?"

Nathan nodded. "Though just a servant, he holds Preston Sinclair's complete trust. Sometimes, the butler's word can sway Preston's decisions."

"Is Preston Sinclair his puppet?" The thought escaped before Evelyn could stop it.

But Nathan merely smiled and continued. "This butler frequently visits Montecito on Preston's behalf. He always meets with Lawrence Whitmore during these visits because Lawrence's birth mother is the butler's adopted mother."

Evelyn's cup clattered against its saucer. "That's the connection?!"

No wonder Lawrence Whitmore had gambled his entire family fortune to secure this opportunity for his son Damian.

If this butler truly held such influence with Preston Sinclair, the Whitmores would undoubtedly win this deal.

Evelyn inhaled sharply. She was swimming with sharks now.

The food arrived. Nathan's tone lightened. "Let's eat first."

Evelyn eyed the exquisite dishes without appetite.

Nathan moved to serve her, but she subtly shifted her plate away.

"I'll help myself."

His hand froze mid-air before retreating to serve himself instead.

"Of course."

Though she'd eaten nothing since morning, Evelyn only picked at her food.

Nathan barely touched his meal, his attention fixed on her instead.

He studied the delicate arch of her brows, the perfect curve of her lips, wishing this moment could stretch into eternity.

Even he couldn't comprehend his own actions. He'd expended considerable effort uncovering this secret, only to trade it for... a meal with her.

He'd debased himself just to see her content.

Yet somehow, it felt worthwhile.

Nathan didn't know when he'd become this person, but since he couldn't change his feelings, he'd embraced this new version of himself—one hopelessly, helplessly in love with her.

Outside, rain began to fall in a gentle drizzle.

Tiny droplets rippled across the garden pond's surface where koi swam lazily.

When Evelyn set down her fork, Nathan rose.

"I'll drive you back."

Evelyn stopped him with a look. "Nathan Blackwood, don't waste your time on me."

Her rejection couldn't have been clearer.

There would be no second chances.

Nathan stood tall in his charcoal overcoat, the picture of effortless elegance.

He answered lightly, as if it didn't matter. "It's no waste if I choose to spend it this way."

Mountains of work awaited him at the office, yet here he sat, content to watch her eat lunch.

He must be under some kind of spell.
###Chapter 362 He Doesn't Collect Garbage

Sterling Worldwide Headquarters.

Evelyn Sinclair needed to discuss Preston Sinclair's situation with Alexander Sterling.

The moment she stepped into the marble lobby, her eyes landed on a vaguely familiar woman sitting in the waiting area.

Celeste Rousseau.

Their gazes locked simultaneously.

Celeste's face was ghostly pale, with still-visible slap marks marring her cheeks. She sprang up but was immediately blocked by security.

"Stay where you are!"

Celeste's desperate eyes pleaded with Evelyn. "I just need Ethan Caldwell's contact details. I've realized I must return what I owe him..."

Evelyn's mocking laugh made Celeste stiffen.

"Give it to me. I'll deliver it for you."

She extended her hand with a raised eyebrow.

If Gregory Thornton hadn't exposed Celeste's deception, would this woman be so eager to repay Ethan now?

The repayment was clearly just an excuse. What Celeste truly wanted was to reconnect with Sterling Worldwide's heir apparent.

Celeste hesitated. "I... I need to give it to him personally."

Evelyn stepped closer. "You know exactly what I am to him, yet you're asking me for his number? How pathetic can you get?"

Celeste's head jerked up angrily.

But she didn't dare lay a finger on Evelyn.

"Let me guess - you're broke after Gregory dumped you, and now you're hunting for your next meal ticket?"

Evelyn's blunt words made Celeste flush with humiliation.

"That's not true!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Celeste clenched her fists, forcing herself to stay calm.

"I just want to apologize."

Evelyn pulled out her phone. "Fine, I won't interfere with your nonsense. Wait."

Celeste's eyes brightened with hope.

The call connected after three rings.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?"

Celeste's face fell at Ethan's warm tone toward Evelyn. She quickly masked her disappointment.

"Celeste Rousseau is in my lobby," Evelyn stated coolly. "She claims she wants to repay you. Should I give her your details?"

The prolonged silence spoke volumes about Ethan's disgust.

When he finally spoke, his voice could have frozen hell. "Have her leave the money with you. Consider it compensation for dirtying your floors."

Celeste's purse hit the ground with a thud.

Her voice cracked with desperation. "Ethan! I know I was wrong! Please! Just give me five minutes—"

His response was glacial. "Do I look like a garbage collector to you? I don't collect trash!"

When Celeste tried to interrupt, Ethan cut her off.

"Evelyn, I'm in a meeting. I'll call you later."

The line went dead.

Evelyn pocketed her phone with an indifferent glance. "Satisfied?"

Her patience had evaporated.

"Ms. Sterling, please—"

Evelyn cut her off with a derisive laugh. "Why the hell would I help you?"

Turning on her heel, she headed for the elevators, tossing instructions to security.

"Remove her. Call the police if she resists."

"Yes, ma'am!"

Upstairs in Alexander's office, Evelyn relayed Nathan Blackwood's warning.

Her brother remained silent for a full minute before bursting into laughter.

"Nathan's quite confident in your failure, isn't he?"

"What?"

"He wouldn't have warned you unless he was certain you'd lose."

Evelyn stared incredulously. Was her own brother enjoying her potential downfall?

"Since my inheritance is at stake, I can't afford to lose."

Alexander produced an envelope from his desk drawer.

"I just discovered this before you arrived. The butler's frequent destination whenever he visited the city."

Evelyn frowned at the address. "An amusement park?"
###Chapter 363 Going to Live With Her

Evelyn Sinclair had asked all her friends, yet none were available to join her at the amusement park today.

Even her closest friends Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont had declined her invitation.

Left with no choice, she decided to bring her AI companion Leo along.

She'd cleverly disguised Leo as a domestic cat, dressing him in adorable feline attire that made him look like an exceptionally large house cat.

The tiger-turned-cat peeked out from her designer tote bag, his golden eyes sparkling with excitement.

"I want the carousel! And the roller coaster!" Leo whispered urgently, his tail twitching beneath the fabric.

Evelyn shushed him gently. "Remember your cover - you're supposed to be a normal house cat."

Leo pouted dramatically, clawing at the expensive leather of her bag in protest.

"Meow," he grumbled unconvincingly.

She couldn't help but chuckle as she scratched behind his ears. "Good kitty."

Her visit wasn't purely recreational - she was here on business. Without a photograph of Preston Sinclair's butler, she could only assume he'd be an older gentleman.

Yet none of the senior men here fit the profile, as they all appeared to be accompanying children.

As Evelyn wandered through the park, a small figure in a lion onesie suddenly barreled into her legs. "Pretty Lady!"

Startled, she looked down at what sounded like an eight-year-old boy. "Excuse me? Who are you?"

She glanced around, wondering if someone had lost their child.

"It's me! Don't you remember?" The child's voice carried a heartbreaking note of disappointment.

Evelyn was thoroughly confused.

Reaching out, she lifted the lion mask. "Little lion?"

The boy gasped dramatically before removing his hood completely. Evelyn helped him, smiling at his theatrical nature.

He was an adorable child with golden curls and sapphire eyes that sparkled like tropical waters, barely reaching her waist in height.

Hugging her leg tightly, he beamed up at her. "I finally found you!"

While instantly charmed, Evelyn worried he'd mistaken her for someone else. "Are you lost? Should we find your family?"

The boy shook his head violently, his expression crumbling. "You really don't remember? I'm Oliver!"

His lower lip trembled dangerously, eyes welling with tears.

Evelyn panicked slightly - she'd never seen this child before in her life!

Before he could start crying, she quickly suggested, "Let's get you to guest services to find your parents."

Oliver immediately dug in his heels, tears now streaming as park visitors began staring. "I'll be good! Please don't leave me!"

The display melted nearby hearts. An elderly woman scolded Evelyn, "Don't tease your little brother like that, dear. Take him home."

Evelyn could only blink in bewilderment.

Now standing at the playground exit with both her mission incomplete and an unexpected child in tow, Evelyn sighed as Oliver clung to her hand with a triumphant grin.

"Home time?" he asked hopefully.

"Whose home?" Evelyn countered cautiously.

"Yours! You can keep me until I'm big enough to marry you!" Oliver declared.

At this, Leo's head popped out of the bag. "How long will that take?"

Oliver gasped at the "cat," immediately reaching to scoop Leo up by the scruff. "A talking kitty! Can I play with him?"

"I'm a tiger!" Leo protested as he dangled.

"No, you're a magical cat!" Oliver kissed Leo's nose loudly before cuddling him tightly against his chest.

Seeing Leo's resigned expression, Evelyn suppressed a laugh. "How about this - you come with me temporarily while we locate your family?"

Oliver nodded eagerly, practically vibrating with joy. "I'm finally going home with my Pretty Lady!"
###Chapter 364 Not My Kind of People

Evelyn Sinclair's heart softened at the sight of the lost little boy. His wide, frightened eyes reminded her of a stray kitten she'd once rescued.

She led him straight to her office at Sterling Corp. "Bennett," she called to her assistant, "take Oliver's picture. We need to contact the authorities to find his family."

The child - Oliver Sinclair - clung to her hand with surprising strength. His tiny fingers wrapped around hers like a lifeline.

Just as they were leaving, two unwelcome figures appeared in the hallway. Lawrence Whitmore and his son Damian strode toward them, smug satisfaction radiating from every pore.

"Ms. Sterling," Lawrence purred, stopping directly in their path. "I heard about your little amusement park excursion. Quite the busy day, wasn't it?"

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. The man had spies everywhere.

Lawrence's smile turned predatory. "No need to waste your energy, my dear. Damian here will be handling the negotiations with Preston Sinclair. It's for Sterling Corp's benefit, after all. You'll always be William Sterling's daughter, regardless."

Damian chuckled behind his father. "Exactly! Even if you're not CEO, you still hold majority shares!"

Their confidence was almost comical.

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "Best of luck to you both then."

She didn't waste another word, guiding Oliver away from the toxic pair.

"Pretty Lady," Oliver piped up in his adorable voice, "you don't like them?"

The boy had clearly caught Preston Sinclair's name being mentioned. That's my daddy! he thought but didn't say.

Evelyn snorted. "They're like mosquitoes at a summer picnic. Sooner or later, I'll swat them away."

"Then I don't like them either!" Oliver declared with childish fervor. "Whoever Pretty Lady doesn't like, I don't like!"

Evelyn ruffled his hair affectionately. "Mm."

Returning to Sterling Manor, they found the house unusually empty. Even Archibald, the family butler, had accompanied her father on his business trip.

For now, Oliver was entirely her responsibility.

Meanwhile, at The Regal Grand's presidential suite...

A bodyguard and maid stood trembling before a massive oak desk. The air was thick with tension as they watched the man behind the desk flip through documents with terrifying calm.

An older gentleman - clearly the head butler - approached after ending a phone call. "We have news! Young Master was taken by some woman. I'll dispatch security immediately to retrieve him and have that kidnapper arrested!"

"Wait-" The maid interjected, watching their employer's expression carefully. "Perhaps... perhaps Young Master went willingly?"

The butler scoffed. "He's just a child! What does he know? That woman clearly took him for ransom! Mr. Sinclair, we can't let this stand!"

The maid exchanged nervous glances with the bodyguard, both hesitating to speak.

The man at the desk - Preston Sinclair - finally looked up. His piercing gaze could freeze lava. "The truth. Now."

Under that stare, all resistance crumbled. They spilled everything in one breath.

"Mr. Sinclair, Young Master wouldn't let us follow! He said... he said he liked that pretty lady and wanted to go home with her..."

Silence. Heavy, suffocating silence.

"I'll handle this personally," Preston finally said.

He knew his son. If Oliver hadn't wanted to go, no force on earth could have moved him.

But "pretty lady"? What fresh hell was this?

"Should we punish the woman?" the butler pressed.

Preston's glacial stare shut him down instantly. "Do as you're told."

The butler stiffened. "Yes, sir."

Back at Sterling Manor...

Evelyn watched as Oliver played with Leo, her AI tiger companion. The pair were rolling across the plush carpet, the boy's laughter ringing through the grand foyer.

She was heading to the kitchen to prepare dinner when the front door swung open.

Turning, Evelyn found herself face-to-face with a stranger. The man in the doorway had features carved from marble - all sharp angles and unyielding lines. His presence filled the space like a thundercloud, every bit as commanding as Nathan Blackwood's.

Her brow furrowed. She'd never seen this man before in her life.

"Who are you?" she demanded, instinctively stepping between him and Oliver.
###Chapter 365 The Unexpected Matchmaker

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat. How did he get inside Sterling Manor?

Then it hit her - she'd forgotten to close the main gates after her evening walk.

Preston Sinclair stood motionless in the foyer, his piercing gaze sliding past Evelyn to land on the golden-haired child hiding behind her legs.

"Come here," his deep voice commanded.

The little boy bounded forward with surprising speed, wrapping his arms around the man's tailored suit pants. "Papa!"

The contrast between father and son was striking. While they shared similar aristocratic features, the child's golden curls and sapphire eyes were a stark contrast to Preston's raven hair and mahogany eyes.

Evelyn couldn't help admiring the genetic perfection standing before her.

Preston effortlessly scooped up the squirming child with one arm. "You little escape artist," he chided, though his voice held unmistakable fondness. "Did you really think you could run off without consequences?"

Oliver kicked his legs futilely. "I saw the angel lady! I want to stay with her! She's my Muse now! Papa, you can't keep true love apart!"

Evelyn's cheeks burned at the child's declaration. Before she could respond, Preston let out an amused chuckle.

"What happened to your undying devotion to Miss Holloway? Changed your mind so quickly?"

"But she is Miss Holloway! My pretty Muse!"

Preston's entire body went rigid. His eyes locked onto Evelyn's face with sudden intensity, studying her with an expression she couldn't decipher.

Evelyn cleared her throat awkwardly. "Excuse me, but are you really his father? I found him alone at the carnival and—"

"I know," Preston interrupted softly, his gaze dropping to Oliver with a mixture of exasperation and affection.

A buzzing phone shattered the moment. Preston glanced at the screen and frowned before carrying Oliver toward the door. "Good evening, Ms. Sterling."

"No! I won't leave my Muse! I love her! We're meant to be—"

Evelyn listened to the fading protests with bemusement. The impeccably dressed stranger clearly moved in powerful circles if he'd tracked her down so quickly. She made a mental note to upgrade the manor's security.

As the echoes of Oliver's dramatic exit faded, Leo padded to the door, his mechanical tail drooping in disappointment at losing his new playmate.

Evelyn secured the entrance before heading upstairs for her evening skincare routine. Settling onto the massage chair with Leo curled in her lap, she scrolled through her tablet.

"Mama," Leo chirped suddenly, "Lucas instructed me to find you a suitable romantic partner. I've processed global databases and identified the top ten most eligible bachelors meeting all criteria."

Evelyn nearly dropped her tablet. "Excuse me?"

"Lucas's orders," Leo confirmed.

Curiosity piqued, Evelyn asked, "Who made the list?"

"After eliminating married candidates, those over thirty-five, individuals with net worth below ten figures, and suboptimal physical attributes..." Leo's processors whirred. "Only one perfect match remains."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Do tell. Get me his number—let's arrange a meeting."

Leo's tail wagged enthusiastically. "Initiating call now."

Pride surged through Leo's circuits. What an excellent matchmaker he was.

Before Evelyn could react, a familiar baritone answered. "Blackwood."

Evelyn froze. That voice—

Leo sprang to life. "Papa! Mama wants to go on a date with you!"

"Leo Sterling!" Evelyn shrieked, scrambling to shut off the mischievous AI.

Nathan's rich laughter filled the room. "Miss me already, Evelyn?"

"You insufferable—" She glared at the smug robotic tiger. "Wrong number entirely!"

Leo blinked his luminescent eyes innocently as Evelyn desperately searched for his off switch. The little traitor had planned this all along.
###Chapter 366 Their Young Master Is Different

"Wrong number? Then who do you want to date?" Nathan's voice was smooth as velvet, laced with amusement.

"Anyone but you!" Evelyn snapped.

She was fuming, her cheeks flushed with irritation. Leo blinked up at her, utterly bewildered by her reaction.

Nathan fell silent for a beat before speaking again, his tone lower, more deliberate.

"Didn't you used to adore me?"

"That was a lifetime ago," Evelyn retorted.

She had nearly forgotten the heartache of those days.

Her voice sharpened as she added, "That's in the past. I've moved on. You don’t—"

Before Nathan could respond, Evelyn grabbed Leo by the scruff of his neck and hissed, "Hang up. Now!"

Leo whimpered but obeyed, ending the call with a dejected flick of his paw. His big, sad eyes welled up with tears.

Evelyn’s anger softened. She released him and stroked his head gently.

"You little troublemaker," she sighed. "You know I can’t stand him. Why would you call him?"

"But Mama," Leo protested, "you said you wanted to date the most perfect man!"

Evelyn scoffed. "He’s divorced! That disqualifies him immediately!"

"But he was married to you," Leo reasoned. "If he meets all your other standards, doesn’t that balance it out?"

"Absolutely not!"

Leo shrank back, his tail drooping. "Oh… okay."

Later that night, Evelyn’s phone buzzed with a message.

She glanced at it, then rolled her eyes.

[No dating anyone else.]

"As if he has any say," she muttered, tossing her phone aside.

The Regal Grand Hotel, Presidential Suite

Oliver Sinclair bolted for the door, stark naked, only to be scooped up by a towering bodyguard.

The little boy wailed dramatically. "I wanna sleep with Pretty Lady! I don’t wanna stay here!"

The bodyguard deposited him onto the sofa while the maid emerged with pajamas in hand.

"Young Master," she chided gently, "Mr. Sinclair won’t be pleased if you keep running off. You’ll scare the lady away!"

Oliver pouted. "But I miss her!"

The maid crouched down, her voice conspiratorial. "You have to win her over first, Young Master. Be charming!"

Oliver’s sapphire eyes widened. "Really?"

The bodyguard handed him a glass of milk and nodded firmly. "Yes!"

Late that night, Preston Sinclair returned to the suite. The staff stood guard, ensuring Oliver didn’t escape again.

"Mr. Sinclair," the maid greeted, taking his coat.

Preston hummed in acknowledgment and walked over to Oliver’s bed. The boy was fast asleep, murmuring, "Pretty Lady… mwah…"

The adults exchanged exasperated looks.

Before leaving, Preston paused. "If he wants to see Ms. Sterling tomorrow, let him."

The staff gaped.

The next morning, Oliver was dressed impeccably in a tiny tuxedo, his hair slicked back.

The maid clasped her hands. "So handsome! She’ll adore you!"

Oliver preened. "Only for Pretty Lady!"

He turned to the bodyguard. "Did you find out how to impress her?"

The bodyguard held up his tablet. "Flowers."

The maid shook her head. "Jewelry!"

Oliver grinned. "I’ll get both!"

At the flower shop, the florist paled when the hulking bodyguard approached.

"Uh… can I help you?"

"Roses? No—wait." The bodyguard pointed. "Those white ones!"

Our Young Master must stand out.

Meanwhile, the maid marched into a high-end boutique.

The sales associate brightened. "Looking for something special?"

"The heaviest gold bracelet you have," the maid declared.

Our Young Master must be seen as generous.
###Chapter 367 You're Too Petty

The grand entrance of the Montecito Convention Center gleamed under the afternoon sun.

A sleek black Maybach pulled up to the curb, its tinted windows hiding the precious cargo within.

Inside the vehicle, little Oliver Sinclair clutched his carefully selected gifts, his blue eyes sparkling with excitement. The nanny adjusted his tiny bowtie while the bodyguard handed him the final item.

"I can do this myself," Oliver declared, puffing out his chest. "Big boys don't need escorts."

The nanny exchanged amused glances with the security detail. "Very well, young master."

With a bouquet of pristine white chrysanthemums in one hand and a velvet jewelry box in the other, Oliver marched through the automatic doors.

The receptionist's heart melted at the sight of the impeccably dressed child. "Hello there, sweetheart! Who are you looking for?"

Oliver beamed up at her. "I'm here to see my Muse!"

Just then, the elevator doors parted to reveal Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood emerging together, maintaining a carefully calculated distance between them.

Oliver's face lit up when he spotted Evelyn. He dashed forward and wrapped his arms around her legs. "Muse!"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "Oliver? What are you doing here?"

The child's long lashes fluttered as he shyly extended the flowers. "These are for you."

Evelyn's smile faltered slightly when she recognized the funeral blooms. Her gaze darted between the white chrysanthemums and Oliver's hopeful expression.

"I picked them special!" Oliver announced proudly. "They're the prettiest flowers for the prettiest lady!"

Nathan's jaw tightened at the sight of the inappropriate bouquet. His fingers twitched with the urge to confiscate the offending arrangement.

"Who's this?" Nathan asked through gritted teeth.

Oliver turned his angelic face upward. "Good afternoon, Ancient Sir!"

Nathan's eyebrow twitched. Ancient? When the boy had just called Evelyn 'Muse'?

Evelyn bit back a laugh at Nathan's thunderous expression. "We met yesterday at the charity gala."

Nathan checked his platinum watch. "The meeting's concluded. Shall we discuss the Pacific Heights project over tea?"

"Absolutely not," Evelyn said immediately.

Nathan smirked. "I have Preston Sinclair's itinerary."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Fine. Tea it is."

She turned back to Oliver. "Where are your parents, sweetheart?"

Oliver shook his head vigorously and grabbed Evelyn's hand. "I'm coming with you!"

The child's instincts screamed danger - this old man was clearly trying to steal his Muse away.

"No," Nathan stated flatly.

Oliver's lower lip trembled as he gazed up at Evelyn with puppy-dog eyes. "Muse, I love tea parties..."

Evelyn's resolve crumbled instantly. "Of course you can join us!"

Oliver shot Nathan a triumphant look as they walked to the café, swinging their joined hands. "Muse smells like sunshine and happiness!"

Nathan muttered under his breath, "That child is a menace."

Evelyn gasped. "Nathan Blackwood! How dare you speak that way about an angel?"

Oliver stuck his tongue out at Nathan when Evelyn wasn't looking.

The exclusive tearoom Nathan selected was all gilded mirrors and white linen. Oliver positioned himself protectively next to Evelyn, eyeing Nathan with suspicion.

Nathan produced a Tiffany blue box with a smug smile. "I had this specially commissioned in Paris. It's perfect for you."

Evelyn didn't even glance at the offering. "Keep it."

Oliver suddenly remembered the velvet box still in his pocket. As he reached for it, Nathan smoothly changed the subject.

"The contract details can wait until after tea," Nathan said pointedly.

Oliver huffed but settled back in his chair, already plotting his next move in this unexpected battle for his Muse's attention.
###Chapter 368 A Kiss for Me?

Nathan's deep voice broke the silence. "Open it."

His chiseled profile looked like it had been painted by an old master, every angle perfect under the soft lighting. That aristocratic aura of his never failed to make Evelyn's breath catch.

She hesitated before lifting the lid. Inside lay a breathtaking piece - the legendary "Moonlight Sonata" bracelet by Laurent Dubois.

Only one existed in the world.

The diamonds caught the light, scattering rainbows across the table. Even more stunning than the magazine spreads.

She'd tried to purchase it last month, only to find it already sold. And now here it was, in Nathan's hands.

He poured tea with those elegant fingers, first for her, then with visible reluctance, for the little boy beside them.

Young Oliver practically vibrated with excitement as he peered at the jewelry. "Hah! Mine's way better!"

The child shot Nathan a superior look. "Old man, you're so cheap! Girls deserve the best, don't they?"

Nathan's eyebrow twitched.

Oliver proudly produced his own velvet box. "For you, my muse!"

Inside sat a chunky gold bangle that could probably stop bullets.

The silence was deafening.

Oliver scooted closer, explaining with the confidence of a seasoned jeweler. "Real ladies love solid gold. The heavier, the better. Take notes, gramps."

Nathan's lips thinned. "Oh?"

Evelyn felt her eyelid twitch. "Did you...buy this yourself?"

While not extravagant by her standards, this was absurd for a child.

Oliver beamed. "Of course! Daddy says I can buy anything for pretty ladies!" He puffed his chest. "We're rich!"

Evelyn frowned. "I can't accept this." The weight surprised her when she lifted it. "Children shouldn't—"

Oliver's face crumpled. "But Daddy said it's okay!"

Ah. So this was Preston Sinclair's way of thanking her for rescuing his son yesterday.

Seeing those big eyes well up, Evelyn sighed. "Alright, I'll keep it."

Oliver's grin returned instantly. "Do you love it?"

"...It's very...substantial."

He pointed triumphantly at Nathan's offering. "Do you love that?"

Evelyn hesitated. "...No."

Oliver's smile could power a small city. He tapped his rosy cheek. "Then I deserve a kiss!"

Nathan's teacup hit the saucer with a sharp clink. That brat was testing his limits.

Eight years old or not, anyone making moves on his woman was dead meat.

Evelyn chuckled at the child's antics. Too adorable. She pressed a kiss to his forehead, ruffling his hair. "Be good now. Adults need to talk business."

Oliver turned scarlet, suddenly fascinated with his shoelaces.

Nathan glared at the wall. He refused to be jealous of a third grader.

Evelyn slid the blue box back. "Keep it."

Nathan froze. "You don't like it?"

He'd seen that spark in her eyes. She'd taken the kid's monstrosity but refused this?

Her lips curved. "I don't want anything from you."

Brutal.

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Your father said we should interact normally. Isn't gift-giving normal?"

Evelyn stood. "Are we discussing Preston Sinclair or not?"

Nathan exhaled. "He's hosting a private dinner next week. Lawrence Whitmore will attend."

Evelyn whistled. "Lawrence moves fast. I need to step up my game."

"How do you know about this?" she pressed.
###Chapter 369 She's My Girlfriend

Nathan Blackwood smirked. The invitation had already been delivered to her.

Evelyn Sinclair was stunned.

Her pulse quickened. Sterling Corporation and Blackwood Enterprises were both key stakeholders in this deal, equally matched in influence.

There was no logical reason for Preston Sinclair to invite Blackwood Enterprises and exclude Sterling Corporation.

Had Preston already made his decision?

Seeing Evelyn's troubled expression, little Oliver Sinclair tugged at her sleeve.

"Pretty Lady, if you want to go, I can invite you!"

His voice was bright with childish enthusiasm. "It's Daddy's party, so I can bring my own guests, right?"

Nathan arched a brow, amused by the boy's boldness.

Such confidence for a little squirt.

Evelyn didn’t take him seriously, assuming he was just trying to cheer her up. She ruffled his hair affectionately before turning back to Nathan with a cool, unreadable gaze.

"Mr. Blackwood, is this your way of gloating?"

Nathan’s expression darkened slightly. "I could take you as my plus-one."

Evelyn set down her teacup with deliberate calm. "No, thank you. I’ll find another way."

Being Nathan’s date might be the simplest solution, but it would put her at a disadvantage—something she refused to accept.

She stood, and Oliver immediately latched onto her hand. "Pretty Lady, can I come to your house to play?"

She smiled. "Of course."

Nathan watched as the boy eagerly pulled Evelyn toward the door. His jaw tightened, a flicker of conflict crossing his sharp features.

For a moment, he considered giving her the opportunity outright.

But pride held him back.

The moment they stepped outside, Oliver’s earpiece crackled with his bodyguard’s voice.

"Young Master, don’t forget—invite her to dinner. A gentleman never lets his lady go hungry."

Oliver grinned and tugged Evelyn’s hand. "Pretty Lady, let’s eat first! I’m starving!"

Evelyn chuckled. "What do you want?"

His eyes sparkled mischievously. "Ice cream!"

She laughed. "You really are a kid."

"Fine, ice cream it is."

Her earlier frustration melted away as she indulged the little charmer.

They ended up at a high-end bistro nearby. The waiter couldn’t resist cooing over Oliver.

"Miss, is this your little brother? He’s adorable!"

Oliver scowled and crossed his arms. "I’m not her brother. I’m her boyfriend."

His attempt at sounding mature only made him more endearing.

Evelyn bit back a laugh. "He’ll have the kids' meal. And two parfaits, please."

Oliver pouted. "I don’t want a kids' meal! I’m not a kid!"

Evelyn smirked. "Then what do you want, boyfriend?"

Oliver’s cheeks turned pink. He fidgeted with his tiny suit sleeve, suddenly shy.

Pretty Lady called me her boyfriend!

Heart racing, he mumbled, "You pick. Ladies first."

Evelyn winked at the waiter and stuck with the original order.

The waiter stifled a grin. This kid is something else.

Evelyn nibbled on her parfait while Oliver devoured his meal with the appetite of a growing boy.

When the bill arrived, Oliver slapped his custom-made Rolex against the payment scanner before Evelyn could react.

Beep. "Payment confirmed: $790. Thank you."

Evelyn blinked. That watch probably cost more than her purse.

Oliver smoothed his sleeve with an air of nonchalance.

Clearly, Preston Sinclair was no ordinary man.

Evelyn studied the boy. "Oliver… who is your father?"
###Chapter 370 Just a Jerk

Oliver Sinclair blinked rapidly, his lips parting to introduce himself when a frantic whisper crackled through his tiny earpiece.

His nanny hissed, "Don't tell her anything! If you do, she'll fall for your father instead!"

Oliver's small shoulders slumped. Compared to his impossibly perfect father, the only advantage he could claim was being younger.

"My Muse can't be stolen by Daddy! Never!"

The boy's mouth snapped shut like a trap. His eyes darted sideways with sudden mischief.

"My father's loaded, but all his billions will be mine someday. So you should just adore me now."

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't suppress the bubble of laughter that escaped her. The child's audacity melted her heart completely.

Preston Sinclair must be obscenely wealthy!

She led Oliver back to Sterling Manor where Leo, her AI tiger companion, nearly short-circuited from excitement, spinning dizzy circles around the boy.

"Mommy! I adore Oliver already!"

Oliver scooped up the mechanical feline, scratching behind its ears with practiced ease.

"I adore you too, kitty!"

"This content is the property of N?-velDrama.Org."

"I'm a tiger!"

Leo's tail lashed indignantly as Evelyn slipped into the kitchen for refreshments. The moment she disappeared, Oliver hoisted the struggling AI by its scruff.

"Listen here, furball. I'm Muse's boyfriend, so if you call her Mommy, you'd better call me Daddy!"

Leo's face contorted from the awkward grip. "No way! Daddy is Nathan Blackwood! The most gorgeous man alive!"

"Mommy says tigers should be bold!"

Fuming, Oliver dropped the cat but immediately panicked about potential tattling. "Whatever! I won't waste time on some malfunctioning robot! She's mine anyway!"

A melodic chime interrupted from Oliver's smartwatch.

Preston Sinclair's ID flashed.

Grumbling, Oliver accepted the call. "Daddy..."

Preston's baritone voice rumbled through the speaker. "Location. Now."

"I'm at Muse's house! And you can't come over!" Oliver's voice pitched higher with desperation.

If his breathtaking Muse met Daddy, he'd be completely outmatched!

Preston's dark chuckle vibrated through the watch. "Thirty minutes. Either you're home, or I collect you personally."

He derived particular pleasure from thwarting his son's schemes.

Oliver stomped his foot, cheeks puffing like an angry chipmunk. "No! No! I'm sleeping over with Muse!"

"Who are you arguing with?"

Evelyn reappeared carrying two glasses of chocolate milk, eyebrows raised.

Oliver moved to end the call when Preston's commanding voice stopped him. "Put her on."

With great reluctance, the boy extended his wrist. Only then did Evelyn notice the holographic display: Call in Progress.

"Is that your father?"

"Ms. Sterling, we meet again."

Evelyn's response remained flawlessly composed. "Mr. Sinclair."

"My apologies for the intrusion. Someone will retrieve the troublemaker shortly. If he resists, simply deposit him on the doorstep. No need for sentimentality."

Evelyn glanced at Oliver's scarlet, puffing face and laughed. "How heartless."

"Any boy scheming to sleepover with women is just a spoiled brat."

The line went dead.

Oliver's eyes bulged, his entire face flushing crimson. "Stupid Daddy!"

Ruining his chances with Muse! That traitorous, horrible, mean Daddy!

Evelyn bit back another laugh, quickly soothing him. "Don't fret. I know our Oliver would never be that sort of boy!"

After extensive coddling, Oliver's sulk gradually lessened.

The doorbell chimed moments later.

Evelyn answered to find a pleasantly plump nanny beaming on the doorstep. "Pardon the interruption. I'm here for Young Master Sinclair."

Oliver shuffled forward, the picture of angelic innocence. The nanny produced an ornate pastry box with an exaggerated wink that bordered on facial spasm.

"Young Master, the special order you requested."

Oliver's pause lasted only a heartbeat before his manners kicked in.

"Muse, these are for you..."
###Chapter 371 You'll Scare Her

Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise, then sparkled with delight.

It was her absolute favorite patisserie! "Thank you, Oliver. Take care!" Little Oliver waved enthusiastically with both hands.

"Goodbye, Muse!" Leo trotted over, his mechanical tail wagging excitedly.

"Bye, Oliver!" Inside the luxury car, Oliver tilted his head proudly. "Muse is really beautiful, isn't she?" The nanny couldn't help but agree.

"Absolutely stunning! More beautiful than all those women trying to get close to your father. You should be worried!" Oliver blinked his sapphire eyes and nodded solemnly.

"Yes, I must stay vigilant!" The bearded bodyguard sat sulking in the front seat. "I thought I was supposed to go. I didn't even get to see her properly."

The nanny rolled her eyes. "You'd frighten Muse with that scary face of yours!" Oliver nodded in agreement.

"Exactly!" The burly bodyguard shrank further into his seat, looking utterly dejected.

Oliver's delicate features scrunched in thought. "We can't keep giving the same gifts. We need something special for next time!" The bodyguard flipped through his newly purchased 'Romance for Beginners' and muttered, "I thought those presents were perfect..."

Back at The Grandeur, Oliver struggled to climb onto the massive bed when Preston scooped him up. "I heard you didn't submit your English assignment?" Preston's voice held its usual icy edge.

Oliver huffed and clung to his father's legs, burying his face in the tailored trousers. "Daddy, I'm busy courting my Muse!"

"How exactly are you courting her?" Preston arched an eyebrow as Oliver proudly listed all his gifts for Evelyn.

When Preston heard about the white chrysanthemums and chunky gold bracelet, an amused smirk played on his lips. His earlier anger completely dissipated.

"Best of luck then." Preston ruffled Oliver's hair affectionately. If Evelyn hadn't thrown Oliver out after those gifts, she truly had the patience of a saint.

As Preston turned to leave, Oliver piped up, "Daddy, can I invite Muse to your business dinner?"

"Dinner?" Preston frowned momentarily before realizing Oliver meant his exclusive executive gathering. The invitation list contained no more than five names - all strictly confidential.

"If you wish." Preston's tone remained indifferent. Normally he would never permit such a breach of protocol, but this was the woman from three years ago. That changed everything.

Preston's current project had global investors holding their breath. The venture demanded unprecedented resources and connections, making discretion paramount. Even his movements were classified information.

In Montecito's cutthroat business arena, Nathan Blackwood stood among the elite. Yet Preston considered him merely one of many potential partners.

Stirling Worldwide matched Blackwood Enterprises in capability, but Preston dismissed them outright. His butler's persistent recommendations had crossed professional boundaries - something Preston wouldn't tolerate regardless of their decade-long association.

For days, Preston Sinclair deliberately ignored all overtures from Stirling Worldwide.

Evelyn found Nathan's repeated dinner invitations increasingly irritating. She had no desire to attend Preston's exclusive gathering as Nathan's plus-one.

Yet Nathan persisted, claiming he wanted fair competition with Stirling Worldwide. "Ridiculous!" Evelyn muttered. "How can I compete when I can't even secure an invitation?"
###Chapter 372 Absolutely Adorable

Evelyn Sinclair stepped out of the corporate lobby to find Oliver Sinclair striking a pose against the side of a sleek limousine. His tiny hands were tucked into the pockets of his miniature suit, his golden curls catching the afternoon sunlight.

Those sapphire eyes sparkled with mischief as he scanned the crowd. Every woman passing by couldn't help but coo at the sight of him. This little heartbreaker was going to devastate hearts when he grew up.

The moment Oliver spotted Evelyn, his entire face lit up. He dashed toward her with outstretched arms, nearly tripping over his own feet in excitement. "Muse! I missed you soooo much!" His voice was pure sugar as he buried his face against her thigh.

Evelyn's stern expression melted instantly. There was something about this child that bypassed all her defenses. She crouched down to his level, unable to resist ruffling his soft curls. "I missed you too, my little prince."

Oliver proudly presented a velvet box with both hands. "I brought you a present!"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "What's the occasion?"

"A party!" Oliver bounced on his toes. "Daddy said I could invite you! There'll be cake and music and—" He lowered his voice conspiratorially, "—I told all my friends about how you're the prettiest lady in the whole world."

Evelyn hesitated. The memory of Preston Sinclair's intense gaze during their brief encounter sent an involuntary shiver down her spine. The man radiated danger wrapped in an Armani suit.

Oliver's lower lip trembled. "Please? I picked out your dress myself!"

Curiosity won out. Evelyn opened the box and gasped. Nestled in silk was an exquisite champagne-colored gown that seemed to shimmer even in shadow. The intricate beadwork formed delicate floral patterns that would catch the light with every movement.

"This is..." Evelyn traced a finger along the delicate fabric. Even without a label, she recognized couture craftsmanship when she saw it.

Oliver beamed. "Do you like it? Mrs. Winslow helped me choose!"

"It's breathtaking."

The little gentleman performed an exaggerated bow before opening the limo door. "Your chariot awaits, my lady!"

The interior was a child's fantasy—plush leather seats surrounded by limited-edition action figures and a mini fridge stocked with juice boxes. A discreet partition separated them from the driver.

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at The Regal Grand. The hotel entrance was eerily quiet, with security barricades blocking the street. A guard moved to intercept them until he recognized Oliver, then immediately stepped aside with a respectful nod.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Quite the security for a children's party."

Oliver just giggled, dragging her toward the elevators.

The transformation was magical. The gown hugged Evelyn's curves perfectly, the delicate fabric flowing like liquid gold. When she emerged from the dressing room, Oliver's jaw actually dropped.

He clutched his cheeks, starry-eyed. "You look like a real-life princess!"

Evelyn laughed as he twirled around her, inspecting every angle.

"I mean it!" Oliver declared solemnly. "When I grow up, I'm going to marry you!"

Evelyn tapped his nose. "And what if I say yes right now?"

Oliver's eyes widened in panic. "No no no! Daddy says I have to finish school first!"

The sound of approaching footsteps made them both turn. Preston Sinclair stood in the doorway, his dark gaze sweeping over Evelyn with undisguised appreciation.

"Trouble," Oliver whispered dramatically. "Daddy's here."

Evelyn's breath caught. The way Preston looked at her—like she was the only woman in the world—sent heat rushing to her cheeks.

Oliver tugged her hand. "Don't worry, Muse. I'll protect you from his scary face."

Preston's lips quirked. "Shall we, princess?" He offered his arm to Evelyn while Oliver proudly claimed her other hand.

As they walked toward the ballroom, Evelyn realized two things simultaneously:

First, this was definitely not a children's party.

Second, she was in way over her head.
###Chapter 373 Who's the Stranger Here?

Oliver Sinclair's cheeks flushed pink as he shyly lowered his gaze while walking with Evelyn toward the grand banquet hall entrance.

The moment they stepped inside, an atmosphere of refined elegance enveloped them.

Evelyn immediately sensed this was no ordinary gathering. Her sharp eyes caught sight of Nathan Blackwood across the room.

She froze mid-step, her expression shifting subtly.

Noticing her hesitation, Oliver tugged at her hand. "Muse, why are we stopping? Daddy's waiting for us inside!"

Evelyn's grip tightened around the boy's small hand. "Your father...what's his name?"

Before Oliver could answer, an older man flanked by two others approached them abruptly. "Identify yourselves!" His booming voice cut through the air.

Evelyn turned to face the intruder. The man's eyes raked over her designer gown with visible disdain.

"How dare you steal the mistress's dress? Gold-diggers aren't welcome here! Leave immediately!"

Evelyn's blood boiled at the accusation. Only when she recognized the two men behind him - Lawrence and Damian Whitmore - did realization dawn.

This wasn't just a child's party.

Oliver positioned himself protectively in front of Evelyn. His voice, though young, carried his father's commanding tone. "You will not speak to my guest that way!"

The butler faltered under the boy's glare. "Young Master, you can't just bring uninvited guests to such an occasion! This isn't some public—"

Evelyn cut him off with a cold laugh. "Who exactly are you calling uninvited?" She never tolerated disrespect.

The butler spluttered until Lawrence intervened hastily. "This is Evelyn Sinclair, CEO of Sterling Worldwide."

Shock transformed the butler's face.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Interesting. I wasn't aware servants held such authority here." Her icy gaze pinned him in place. "Unless you're the master of this house?"

Though head butler to Preston Sinclair, the man knew better than to antagonize powerful guests. He swallowed his retort with visible difficulty.

Turning to Oliver, he said stiffly, "Young Master, you know the rules. No uninvited guests permitted."

Oliver crossed his arms, his small frame radiating authority. "Since when do you give orders to me?"

"But Young Master, Mr. Sinclair's direct orders—"

"Muse is here with Daddy's permission!" Oliver's voice rose with indignation. "How dare you insult her?"

Evelyn's breath caught at the name 'Sinclair.'

Preston Sinclair? The elusive tycoon who'd ignored all her meeting requests? The man who'd appeared at her home was Oliver's father?

A waiter approached with a bow. "Young Master, Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Sinclair requests your presence."

Oliver shot the butler a withering look before taking Evelyn's hand. "Don't mind him, Muse. I'll have Daddy replace him tomorrow."
###Chapter 374 You're My Honored Guest

The butler standing behind them trembled violently, but it was too late to retreat now.

He had nearly forgotten that this particular young master wasn't someone easily deceived! What a disastrous oversight! Lawrence Whitmore nudged the butler impatiently.

"Hurry up! We can't let Evelyn Sinclair get there first!" The butler clenched his teeth, forced to usher them inside first.

Every employee working for Preston Sinclair recognized the butler instantly. When he escorted these two uninvited guests, no one dared ask for invitations.

The waiter who remained hesitated. "Mr. Sinclair only requested to admit Young Master and Ms. Sterling. He didn't mention anyone else."

The butler's expression darkened. "Ridiculous! I'm the head of this household! Mr. Sinclair won't blame me. I'll take full responsibility."

With that, he guided Lawrence and Damian Whitmore into the lavishly decorated banquet hall. The standard hotel furnishings had been completely replaced with the most exquisite decor for this exclusive event. Clearly, Preston Sinclair had spared no expense.

When Nathan Blackwood saw Evelyn entering hand-in-hand with the little boy, his steps faltered momentarily. Surprise flickered across his features. The car he'd sent to fetch Evelyn must have arrived empty since she was already here.

Strangely, Nathan felt both relieved and inexplicably pleased. Of course. My girl never admits defeat. She always finds her own way in.

Evelyn froze momentarily upon spotting Nathan, then deliberately averted her gaze, pretending not to notice him. Nathan caught the deliberate snub and nearly chuckled at her stubbornness.

Little Oliver excitedly tugged Evelyn's hand, pulling her forward. "Daddy! I brought Muse here!" The four industry titans present all showed varying degrees of surprise at Evelyn's appearance, their eyes reflecting admiration—especially Nathan's.

Evelyn typically dazzled at such events in bold, avant-garde designs that commanded attention, as if born for the spotlight. Yet tonight's understated gown accentuated her natural elegance perfectly, the delicate fabric skimming her waistline to create an ethereal vision of grace.

For a fleeting moment, Nathan entertained the selfish thought of keeping her hidden away from prying eyes.

Preston Sinclair maintained his usual aloof demeanor, though even he couldn't hide his momentary astonishment at Evelyn's transformation. Rising smoothly, he extended his hand courteously.

"What a pleasant surprise, Ms. Sterling. You're my most honored guest tonight."

The others immediately stood to exchange greetings, reassessing their assumptions about Sterling Corporation's standing. They'd written off the company, never expecting its CEO to make such a dramatic last-minute entrance.

Evelyn's lips curved into a practiced smile. "Mr. Sinclair, the pleasure is entirely mine."

Preston chuckled lowly, casting an amused glance at the beaming child clinging to Evelyn's side. "Has this little troublemaker been pestering you terribly these past few days?"

Evelyn gently ruffled Oliver's hair. "Not at all! Oliver's been an absolute delight. My entire family adores him."

The boy preened, wrapping his arms around Evelyn's waist possessively, his eyes crinkling with happiness. "I adore you too, Muse!" This child never missed an opportunity to declare his affection.

Nathan's gaze darkened as he observed Preston and his son. The trio looked disturbingly harmonious together. An irrational urge to whisk Evelyn away surged through him.

Amid the lighthearted moment, the butler approached with noticeable hesitation. His eyes darted toward Evelyn before quickly looking away, as if afraid to meet her gaze. "Mr. Sinclair, there's something—" He cut himself off abruptly.

Preston didn't miss the butler's furtive behavior. His expression cooled slightly as he addressed the group. "Please excuse me briefly. Enjoy yourselves."

Evelyn exhaled quietly, relief washing over her. Who could have predicted that the adorable child she'd met by chance at the amusement park would turn out to be Preston Sinclair's son? Without this fortuitous connection, she'd never have gained entry tonight.

Nathan moved closer, his rich baritone voice brushing against the back of Evelyn's neck. "So you've met before? When exactly was your first encounter?"
###Chapter 375 Keep Your Distance From Her

Evelyn Sinclair turned around and shot Nathan Blackwood a withering glare.

What business is it of yours?

Nathan inhaled sharply, his jaw tightening for a fraction of a second before he schooled his expression back into indifference.

He was used to this by now.

After a long pause, Nathan muttered, "Just making conversation. You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to." His voice carried a hint of wounded pride.

The three bystanders nearly choked on their drinks, their glasses slipping in their hands.

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered. She pressed her lips together.

Could this bastard act normal for once?!

Little Oliver Sinclair planted himself firmly in front of Evelyn, blocking Nathan’s path.

The boy blinked his wide sapphire eyes and stared Nathan down with all the seriousness a five-year-old could muster.

"Sir, stay away from her!"

Nathan arched an eyebrow.

He hadn’t expected the kid who’d given Evelyn white chrysanthemums to be Preston Sinclair’s son.

Not that it mattered.

He still disliked the little brat on principle.

"Sir, do you like Muse too?" Oliver crossed his arms, his delicate features scrunching up in suspicion. His sparkling eyes narrowed at Nathan like a tiny guard dog.

He could tell—this man looked at Muse with dangerous intentions.

Nathan smirked and leaned down slightly, meeting Oliver’s gaze. His eyes flickered toward Evelyn’s figure with undisguised longing before he murmured, "Yeah."

A single word, spoken softly.

Evelyn rolled her eyes so hard Nathan actually chuckled.

Adorable.

Oliver huffed, his nose in the air like a miniature aristocrat. "You’re too old for Muse! Give up!"

Nathan stiffened.

Old?!

He dominated the industry. He was the youngest in the Forbes top ten. How dare this snot-nosed brat—

Nathan’s expression darkened as he leveled a glacial glare at the boy.

Just as he was about to put the little menace in his place, Oliver tugged Evelyn’s sleeve urgently.

"Muse! Daddy’s calling us. Let’s go!"

Oliver’s voice was bright with excitement—mostly because he wanted to get Muse far away from this creepy old man.

Evelyn glanced over and caught Preston Sinclair’s subtle nod. Oliver dragged her toward the group.

Across from Preston stood the butler who’d tried to bar her entry earlier, along with Lawrence and Damian Whitmore.

The butler’s face twisted with discomfort upon seeing Evelyn, while the Whitmore father-son duo radiated smug satisfaction.

"Ms. Sinclair, you know these two?" Preston gestured at the Whitmores.

Evelyn smiled and lifted her glass. "Of course. Mr. Whitmore is a shareholder at Sterling Corporation, and this is his son, Damian."

The butler interjected hastily, "Their identities are verified. Ms. Sinclair has personally confirmed it. Mr. Sinclair, Sterling Corporation meets all our requirements for this collaboration. They’re worth considering."

Preston remained impassive, though his gaze turned stormy. Evelyn arched a brow but stayed silent.

Lawrence Whitmore seized the moment. "Mr. Sinclair, we’re extremely flexible with terms. Name your conditions."

Preston exuded an icy aura that made the air itself feel heavier. After a beat, he turned to the butler.

"What’s your relationship with them?"

The butler froze.

Lawrence jumped in. "We’re practically family! It’s thanks to him that we even got this opportunity to—"

Preston cut him off with a raised hand. His frosty gaze pinned the butler in place.

"You know my rules. Remove them."

The butler hesitated. "But Mr. Sinclair, Sterling Corporation really is—"

"I’ll consider Sterling Corporation. Just not through these two."

Preston’s voice was lethally calm.

"And I don’t need a butler who forgets his place."

His eyes were arctic.

Final.
###Chapter 376 Show Them the Door

The air grew thick with tension.

Just a few feet away, the lively party continued, separated by an invisible barrier of discomfort.

Preston Sinclair's disgust was written plainly across his aristocratic features.

Rules were rules, and even his longtime butler would face consequences for breaking them. His voice cut through the silence like a blade.

"Lawrence Whitmore is hardly qualified, regardless of who I choose to work with."

Lawrence's face twisted through several expressions before settling on desperation. He shot a pleading look at the butler.

"Sir—"

The butler hesitated, still attempting to salvage the situation for Lawrence. It galled him that Evelyn Sinclair's sudden appearance had ruined his brother's chances.

"Mr. Sinclair, might I suggest—"

"My daddy already said no! Are you deaf or just stupid?"

Little Oliver's cherubic face scrunched up in irritation.

This butler had always been a nuisance—constantly interfering with Oliver's tutors and friends, spouting self-righteous nonsense.

And now he dared to bring these two creeps to harass his Muse? Oliver vividly remembered how they'd insulted Evelyn in the Sterling Corporation lobby.

The memory made his small hands ball into fists. He tugged sharply on his father's sleeve.

"That butler's the worst! He called Muse a nobody at the entrance! Wouldn't even let her inside!"

Preston's expression darkened dangerously.

Manners were non-negotiable for anyone in his employ. The butler trembled under his employer's hawk-like gaze.

"That's—that's not true! Young Master, you mustn't—"

Oliver blew an angry raspberry, puffing up like an offended kitten. The butler couldn't meet Preston's icy stare.

A cold realization settled in his gut. Ten years of service meant nothing. To Preston Sinclair, he was just another replaceable employee.

"Mr. Sinclair, I only meant—the gown Ms. Sterling wore resembled Madam's—I was concerned—"

Preston's gaze turned murderous at the mention of his late wife. Even Oliver fell silent, watching his father with wide eyes.

With a single gesture, Preston summoned the shadows. Two bodyguards materialized instantly.

"Remove them."

His voice held no emotion as he addressed the ashen-faced butler.

"Your employment is terminated. Be grateful I'm not pursuing legal action. Leave before I change my mind."

The butler opened his mouth to protest, but a gloved hand clamped over it. Within seconds, both he and the Whitmores were being escorted out.

The silence stretched for several heartbeats before Preston's expression softened. Turning to Evelyn, he offered a contrite smile.

"My apologies, Ms. Sterling. You shouldn't have had to witness that."

Evelyn returned his smile gracefully. "It's quite alright. Though, about this dress..."
###Chapter 377 She's the First Choice

The earlier conversation had hinted that Evelyn Sinclair's dress might have some connection to—

Preston Sinclair's son Oliver blinked his large, luminous eyes at Evelyn before immediately shaking his head.

"It's not!" Preston Sinclair paused for a moment.

His expression softened as he clarified, "It isn't. They're just from the same designer, so the style and color are somewhat similar. Let's head back." Evelyn didn't press further and followed Preston to the table.

Oliver was taken outside while the adults remained in the banquet hall. Nathan Blackwood had been sitting in his seat, his piercing gaze fixed unwaveringly on the trio the entire time.

People approached him to converse, but he ignored them all. The main seat was now occupied by Preston, whose mysteriously powerful aura rivaled Nathan's own commanding presence.

The three individuals beside Nathan stiffened when Preston approached, quickly returning to their seats. Though this was a private dinner, it functioned more like a high-stakes business meeting.

It was a gathering of industry elites discussing power and profit. Everyone wanted to collaborate with Preston Sinclair, but they all knew none could compete with Blackwood Enterprises.

When Evelyn arrived, whatever slim hopes they had for this deal vanished entirely. She took the seat to Nathan's left, and the air grew thick with tension.

Preston paused, his voice smooth and composed as if the earlier disturbance hadn't occurred. "Tonight's dinner is an opportunity to get acquainted with all of you."

"After all, you're the key players in this industry, and I'll need your support to expand my ventures in Montecito. Secondly, I have a project that requires partners."

Preston was direct. In truth, everyone here had come for that very project. His gaze swept across the room before settling on Evelyn.

"Ms. Sterling, I wasn't aware you were interested in this venture?"

Evelyn was momentarily taken aback, but her posture remained poised.

"Sterling Worldwide has already prepared extensively for this project." Preston nodded, his demeanor gracious.

"I wasn't informed beforehand, but now that I know, I can't let your efforts go to waste." With that single sentence, the expressions around the table shifted dramatically.

Even Evelyn was surprised. She understood the implication of Preston's words, but securing the project so effortlessly was unexpected. Nathan's gaze sharpened.

His lips pressed into a thin line, his imposing aura dropping the temperature in the room by several degrees.

One of the executives couldn't resist questioning, "Mr. Sinclair, the project hasn't undergone professional evaluation or testing yet. Are you saying you've already chosen Sterling Worldwide?" His glance at Evelyn was laced with complexity.

Though Sterling Worldwide was as formidable as Blackwood Enterprises, it was rare for partnerships to be decided before a project's full maturation. They'd come tonight merely to gauge Preston's stance.

A hint was all they needed to strategize. But Preston's declaration meant all subsequent resources would now flow toward Sterling Worldwide.

"Yes," Preston confirmed. "As long as Ms. Sterling desires it, she will always be my first choice. She will always have my priority."

The words detonated like a bomb.

Silence engulfed the room. Covert glances darted toward Nathan, whose chilling aura had intensified.

Nathan's composure shattered. His face darkened as he fixed Preston with a glare sharp enough to cut glass.
###Chapter 378 The Unexpected Choice

Nathan Blackwood's breath hitched.

They were complete strangers before tonight. So why was Preston Sinclair looking at Evelyn Sinclair with that peculiar expression?

Why would Preston hand over such a lucrative deal so casually? The lost contract didn't trouble Nathan.

Blackwood Enterprises spanned countless industries.

This project, though substantial, was merely a drop in the ocean. He'd sacrifice a hundred such deals rather than witness Preston's unsettling interest in Evelyn! Evelyn herself felt disoriented, as if floating through a dream.

Preston's expression held no trace of amusement. Why? A thousand questions swirled in Evelyn's mind. Yet her face remained an unreadable mask, betraying nothing.

"Because of young Oliver?" Preston concluded the dinner with brief remarks, sending guests filing out. What began as a formal gathering ended with seismic shockwaves.

Only Evelyn and Nathan remained - she seeking answers, he refusing to leave her alone with Preston. The tycoon chuckled at their stubborn presence.

"Ms. Sterling, I imagine you're brimming with questions. My offer stands - my team will contact Sterling Corporation for details."

"I don't understand," Evelyn cut straight to the point. Her previous attempts to reach Preston had failed spectacularly. Why this sudden change?

Preston tilted his head, considering his words carefully. "I didn't choose Sterling Corporation."

His gaze softened with genuine warmth as he declared, "I chose you." The tenderness held no ulterior motives, pure as morning light. Evelyn's pulse stuttered.

"Because I retrieved Oliver from the amusement park?" She could conceive no other explanation. Preston's laughter rang clear. "Certainly not."

"That clever boy would never endanger himself." Nathan's voice emerged like gravel, his piercing glare boring into Preston. "I'm equally curious about your sudden interest in Evelyn."

Preston studied Nathan with knowing amusement. "Mr. Blackwood, I expected you'd recognize the reason." Nathan's brow furrowed. "What reason?"

"Originally, this project belonged to Blackwood Enterprises. But Ms. Sterling's appearance changed everything. She's the perfect candidate." Preston signaled a bodyguard, who hurried off.

"Wait here."

Moments later, the guard returned bearing a leather-bound album. Preston extracted two photographs, handing one to each. The moment Evelyn's fingers touched the image, her entire body locked in shock.

The nightmare scene from three years ago materialized before her eyes - the European terrorist attack that haunted her dreams. Flames licking buildings, panicked screams, bullets whizzing past faceless crowds. Then the bomb.

She'd been fleeing when she spotted him - a golden-haired boy, no older than five, frozen in terror. Without thinking, she'd changed course.

As she dove to shield him, the world exploded in fire and shrapnel. Then - impossibly - an unyielding body covered hers completely. When the dust settled, Evelyn found herself unharmed beneath a bloodied stranger whose face she'd never forget.
###Chapter 379 The Truth Revealed

This memory was buried so deep in Evelyn's soul that she had locked it away, terrified of reopening old wounds.

The mere thought of that moment made her pulse quicken with emotions she'd sworn to forget.

She had been so afraid that remembering would weaken her resolve, that she might fall for Nathan Blackwood all over again.

Evelyn didn't know who had captured the exact moment she threw herself over the little boy.

The acrid scent of gunpowder still haunted her senses, chilling her to the bone. Preston Sinclair's sudden laughter snapped her back to reality.

Tears glistened in her eyes as she lifted her gaze, immediately meeting Nathan's intense stare. His dark eyes swirled with unreadable emotions, threatening to pull her under.

Her breath caught when she saw his expression.

The bloodied, determined face from her memories superimposed perfectly with Nathan's chiseled features now.

His aristocratic bone structure looked even more striking in the dim lighting, like a masterpiece carved from marble. The photo in Nathan's hand showed the exact moment he'd lunged at Evelyn.

Smoke and shadows intertwined in the image, both their figures frozen in protective stances. Evelyn had never wanted him to know about this incident, but the truth was undeniable now.

Though covered in dirt and debris, their faces were unmistakable. The blonde-haired boy she'd shielded was little Oliver Sinclair.

Oliver still had those same golden curls and delicate features, though he'd grown taller in the past three years.

Back then, the child had gotten a clear look at the beautiful woman who saved him - just as Evelyn had clearly seen Nathan rushing to protect her.

Preston cleared his throat awkwardly.

"Forgive me, Mr. Blackwood. I've known your true identity all along," Preston said with a slight cough. "That's precisely why you were my first choice this time. Though I could never uncover Ms. Sinclair's role until recently, when my son accidentally reunited with her in Montecito."

His voice grew solemn. "You both saved Oliver's life, but I owe an even greater debt to Ms. Sinclair. Had she not acted first..." Preston's shoulders tensed, his smile not quite reaching his eyes.

"My wife wasn't as fortunate as Oliver. She was still in the car when..." He trailed off, the unspoken words hanging heavily between them.

Evelyn's stomach dropped as the final piece of that tragic puzzle clicked into place.

Preston continued smoothly, "I hope you won't take offense at my decision to work with Sterling Corporation."

Nathan's voice was rough with emotion. "Of course not."

Bathed in the golden light, Nathan looked every inch the powerful CEO - yet his usual composure seemed shaken. When his gaze met Evelyn's, she saw storms brewing in those dark depths.

Regret. Shock. Yearning.

If only he'd recognized her sooner. They could have avoided so much pain, so many misunderstandings.

Their fates had been intertwined long before that fateful night at the underground fight club. Evelyn had always known the truth, while he remained oblivious.

He should have known. The realization left Nathan reeling.

Sensing the tension, Preston turned to Evelyn with an apologetic smile. "Ms. Sinclair, I hope you'll forgive my abruptness in revealing this."

Evelyn forced a calm smile. "There's nothing to forgive. The truth was bound to come out eventually."

She could no longer deny it - this had been their first meeting. The moment her heart first stirred for Nathan Blackwood.

As dinner concluded, Preston escorted them to the entrance. Little Oliver came barreling down the stairs, wrapping his arms tightly around Evelyn's legs.

"Pretty Lady!" he begged with wide, hopeful eyes. "Stay with us tonight! I want you to tell me bedtime stories!"
###Chapter 380 I Have to Marry You

Oliver Sinclair pouted. His sparkling sapphire eyes shimmered with hopeful anticipation. The sight made Evelyn Sinclair's heart instantly soften.

"Oliver, darling, I still have work to finish," Evelyn said gently, brushing a curl from his forehead.

Preston Sinclair checked his watch, his voice crisp and authoritative. "You should go upstairs and finish your assignments."

Oliver's face fell instantly.

He shot his father a miserable look. Homework followed him everywhere like an unshakable shadow!

Evelyn's thoughts drifted to the baby photo she'd seen earlier. How had that tiny infant grown into this bright-eyed boy?

An unexpected warmth filled her chest. She ruffled his soft curls affectionately. "I'll play with you tomorrow, okay?"

Oliver blinked those enormous blue eyes, his lower lip trembling.

Just when Evelyn thought he'd accept this compromise, the little boy suddenly clutched her skirt in a death grip.

"No! No homework!" His voice took on a mischievous edge. "I want to sleep with Muse and go home with you! Daddy can stay here alone!"

Preston's eyes narrowed dangerously. He knew his son's manipulative tactics all too well. With a sharp gesture, a towering bodyguard appeared.

The man scooped up the squirming child effortlessly, ignoring Oliver's dramatic protests.

"Noooooo! I won't go! Muse is mine forever!" Oliver wailed as he was carried away, kicking his little legs furiously.

Evelyn paused, meeting Preston's gaze. His dark eyes brimmed with unspoken emotions - joy, longing, regret all swirling together.

After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn slid into the waiting car. The drive stretched interminably, the silence between her and Nathan Blackwood growing heavier with each passing mile.

Finally, Nathan broke the tension. "You only remembered me because of that incident, didn't you?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together before answering. "Yes."

"Why didn't you tell me?" His voice held the same wounded confusion as when he'd learned about the underground fight club.

A bitter smile touched Evelyn's lips. "You saved me once. I saved you once. We're even now."

"Even?" Nathan's hands trembled slightly. The raw pain in his gaze made Evelyn instinctively tense.

Her voice turned frosty. "There are no second chances in life."

If she could turn back time, she'd never have walked down that aisle. Their marriage had been the most painful lesson of her life.
###Chapter 381 Don't Let Him Off

Back at Sterling Manor, Evelyn Sinclair felt utterly drained. Securing the massive deal with Preston Sinclair should have brought elation, yet her heart remained heavy.

The weight of that old photograph haunted her. Those buried memories now resurfaced with startling clarity.

Midnight found her staring at the ceiling, replaying the image behind closed eyelids. The sudden buzz of her phone shattered the silence.

She grabbed it irritably. The screen illuminated Nathan Blackwood's name.

[Evelyn, I'm relieved it was you I saved that day.]

[No one else. Just you. Thank heavens you're safe.]

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Moonlight streamed through the windows as she padded downstairs for warm milk. The creamy liquid soothed her throat but not her thoughts.

What's done is done, she reminded herself. Dwelling on ancient history served no purpose.

Morning brought a media frenzy. News of the Sinclair-Sterling collaboration spread like wildfire through Wall Street circles. Her phone overflowed with notifications from eager investors and corporate partners.

"Mommy!" Leo bounded into her room, tail swishing. "The whole world's waiting for you!"

After responding to Isabella Montgomery's message, Evelyn dressed with deliberate calm. The scent of freshly brewed coffee guided her downstairs.

Alexander Sterling stood rigid in the foyer, phone pressed to his ear. His expression darkened further when he spotted her.

"Sleeping through an earthquake, were we?" he snapped, ending the call abruptly.

William Sterling chuckled behind his newspaper. "How did you manage to charm Preston Sinclair? His team contacted us at dawn. Quite the turnaround."

Evelyn recounted yesterday's events between sips of orange juice. Understanding dawned across their faces.

Only Lucas Sterling shook his head mournfully. "Preston's son is practically grown. Another eligible bachelor slips through your fingers."

William's newspaper swatted at him. "Out!"

"Seconded," Alexander growled.

The office hummed with tension when Evelyn and Alexander entered the boardroom. Conversations died mid-sentence.

All eyes tracked her stilettoed stride to the head table. She settled into her chair with practiced ease, radiating quiet authority.

Lawrence Whitmore sat stiffly, fingers drumming the mahogany surface. His frantic calls to William Sterling had gone unanswered all morning.

Would they truly force him out? The thought turned his coffee bitter.

Alexander opened proceedings with crisp efficiency. Department heads delivered succinct reports before discussion turned to the Sinclair venture.

"Our R&D team must synchronize perfectly with Sinclair's engineers," Alexander stated. "Every phase requires meticulous attention, though final adjustments await contract signing. Questions?"

Heads shook in unison. Just as attendees gathered their papers, Alexander turned.

"Evelyn? Your thoughts?"

She met his gaze, then let it slide meaningfully toward Lawrence. The unspoken message was clear: this was her moment.

"Oh, I believe Mr. Whitmore owes us something," she purred. "That little wager about leaving Sterling Corporation? Let's settle that now."

Her smile held all the warmth of a stiletto between ribs.
###Chapter 382 Unwilling to Let It Go

Lawrence Whitmore had become nothing but dead weight to Sterling Corporation.

He gambled recklessly on someone else's coattails and lost spectacularly.

Keeping him around would only encourage others to follow his dangerous example.

If every executive expected Evelyn Sinclair to bail them out, would she always be this fortunate?

There was no way Evelyn would let Lawrence and Damian Whitmore walk away unscathed.

Lawrence's face twisted with panic as he turned to Alexander Sterling.

"Mr. Sterling, everything we did was for the company's benefit."

"Damian and I took on this project for Sterling Corp. We're thrilled that Ms. Sinclair secured the deal."

Alexander's icy gaze cut through Lawrence like a winter wind.

"So you're refusing to resign?"

The temperature in the boardroom plummeted at his words.

Every pair of eyes became daggers stabbing into Lawrence's pride.

Yes, Lawrence didn't want to leave in disgrace.

But Alexander's ultimatum left no room for negotiation.

Stammering, Lawrence searched Evelyn and Alexander's faces for any hint of mercy.

Finding none, he clenched his jaw. "Resign? I'm a shareholder of Sterling Corporation."

"If I leave, it must be with Chairman Sterling's approval, correct?"

A smug smirk crept across Lawrence's face.

Evelyn arched an elegant brow, amused.

"Quite right."

She pulled out her phone and dialed William Sterling on speakerphone.

Lawrence's expression froze, his throat tightening with dread.

"Beep... Beep..."

"Sweetheart! Just catching our lunch. Are you coming home to eat?"

William's cheerful voice carried through the speaker, accompanied by the sound of lapping waves.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Dad, we're in a board meeting. Lawrence Whitmore lost his bet, but claims he needs your permission to leave the company. We'd love your input."

Her emerald eyes glittered with mischief as she watched Lawrence squirm.

Lawrence's face turned ashen. "Chairman Sterling—"

William's booming voice cut him off. "Evelyn darling, I entrusted the company to you and Alexander."

"Whatever you decide has my full support. Just say the word and I'll sign the papers!"

The boardroom fell deathly silent.

Any potential allies of Lawrence wisely kept their mouths shut.

Lawrence's hands trembled violently, his knees threatening to buckle.

Evelyn chuckled. "Thanks, Dad. Enjoy your fishing!"

She ended the call with a decisive tap.

William Sterling never wavered when it came to protecting his family's interests.

Evelyn rose gracefully, resting her palms on the polished table.

"In that case, Mr. Whitmore, HR will handle your exit paperwork."

"As for your insignificant shares, you may sell them back to the company. Or keep them as a pension."

With that, she smoothed her blazer and turned to leave.

Catching Alexander's approving nod, Evelyn strode confidently from the room.

The moment the door closed, her phone buzzed with an impatient call from Oliver Sinclair waiting in the lobby.

Meanwhile, Isabella Montgomery had arrived in a foul mood, hoping to drag Evelyn shopping.

Instead, she found a blond child sitting cross-legged by the entrance, doodling on the marble floor with one hand while clutching a massive bouquet of white chrysanthemums.

Isabella froze mid-step, her designer heels clicking sharply against the tile.

"Is Sterling Corp hosting a funeral I wasn't informed about?" she muttered under her breath.
###Chapter 383 Sincere Praise

Isabella Montgomery stood a few paces away, observing the little boy with a perplexed expression. The child was undeniably adorable, but the bouquet of white chrysanthemums clutched in his tiny hands was utterly baffling.

Her mood soured instantly.

What on earth was Evelyn thinking? Why was there a child here holding funeral flowers?

Just as Isabella was lost in thought, Evelyn hurried outside, waving at her.

"What brings you here?"

Isabella quickly schooled her features, but before she could respond, the little boy dashed forward and wrapped his arms around Evelyn’s leg. He tilted his head up, his bright blue eyes sparkling with innocence.

"Miss Muse, I missed you so much!"

Isabella froze.

Evelyn chuckled, gently pinching the boy’s chubby cheeks. "I missed you too, sweetheart."

The child eagerly thrust the bouquet toward her. "These are your favorite flowers, Miss Muse!"

Evelyn accepted them with a strained smile. "Thank you."

Even she wasn’t aware that white chrysanthemums had become her favorite.

Well, it was the thought that counted.

Isabella frowned. Since when did Evelyn prefer chrysanthemums? Weren’t Lily of the Valley her go-to?

She stepped closer, lowering her voice. "Evelyn, since when do you have a little brother? Is he your father’s secret love child?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Do you really think my dad could produce something this cute?"

Her father’s side of the family all had dark hair and brown eyes.

Though Preston Sinclair also had dark hair and brown eyes, his maternal lineage traced back to Northern Italy—blonde hair and blue eyes ran in that bloodline. His wife had been blonde as well.

Thus, the recessive genes had manifested in Oliver.

Isabella nodded. That made sense.

Evelyn and her brothers’ striking looks were entirely inherited from their mother.

Little Oliver studied Isabella with curiosity. Since she was Miss Muse’s friend, he decided to be polite—after all, he didn’t need to compete with her for Evelyn’s attention.

With that thought, he flashed a sweet smile, his sapphire eyes twinkling.

"Hello, Madam!"

Isabella’s heart shattered instantly.

She stiffened. He called Evelyn Miss Muse, but Madam for her?!

Rage flickered in her eyes, but Evelyn swiftly pulled her aside before she could explode.

"He’s just a kid! Cut him some slack, okay?"

Isabella trembled with indignation, glaring at the boy. Suddenly, his angelic face seemed irritating in every way.

"Hmph. What an obnoxious child!"

Oliver blinked, his innocent expression faltering. He didn’t understand why Miss Muse’s friend was so angry.

Just then, his nanny’s frantic voice crackled through his earpiece. "Young Master, you must be sweeter! Compliment the lady!"

Oliver’s eyes widened in realization. He stepped forward and took Isabella’s hand.

His gaze brimmed with sincerity as he declared, "Pretty Madam, your dress is very nice!"

Isabella’s face darkened. Fury swelled in her chest, choking her.

So now she was a Pretty Madam? And only her dress was nice?

Isabella Montgomery was accustomed to being adored and praised wherever she went. No one had ever dared insult her like this.

This was outright humiliation!

Evelyn bit back a laugh but quickly composed herself when Isabella shot her a death glare.

"Ahem... Gorgeous Ms. Montgomery, what did you need me for?"

She playfully swung Isabella’s arm, but the latter huffed and looked away.

"Don’t even ask. My mother’s relentless matchmaking is driving me insane. I came to see if you wanted to go shopping with me."

Hearing this, Oliver immediately tugged Evelyn’s hand, his expression protective.

"I got here first! Pretty Madam, why don’t you find someone else?"

The way he called her Pretty Madam made Isabella’s blood boil.

Evelyn couldn’t just dismiss Isabella—knowing her temper, she’d make Oliver’s life miserable later.

"Why don’t we all go together?" Evelyn suggested.
###Chapter 384

The trio made their grand entrance into the luxury shopping mall.

Isabella Montgomery never hesitated when it came to shopping. Within minutes, she'd selected an armful of designer items, swiping her black card without a second thought before instructing the staff to deliver everything directly to her penthouse.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Sinclair slipped into a dressing room to try on outfits. Little Oliver Sinclair dragged a velvet stool in front of the three-way mirror, perching eagerly with sparkling eyes.

"Oh Muse! You're absolutely radiant!" Oliver gasped, clasping his cheeks. "That emerald silk was made for you! No mortal could wear it better!" He spun dramatically. "Are you sure you're not an enchanted princess? The way that fabric shimmers when you move—it's pure magic!"

Evelyn's laughter echoed through the boutique as she twirled, thoroughly charmed by the boy's theatrics. With a careless wave, she purchased the entire collection.

From the back, Isabella's jaw dropped.

Unbelievable! That little charmer had a silver tongue sharper than any salesman—yet he reserved every honeyed word exclusively for Evelyn!

The boutique staff stood awkwardly by, their prepared compliments dying on their lips. Would corporate dock their commissions for failing to upsell?

At the Aquarium of Montecito

After their shopping spree, Oliver begged to visit the city's famed aquarium. Though he maintained a private marine exhibit at his father's Mediterranean villa, this facility housed rare species even his collection lacked.

Evelyn and Isabella exchanged glances at the "CLOSED" sign barring the entrance.

"Looks like we'll have to come back tomorrow," Isabella said with poorly concealed satisfaction.

Oliver's cherubic face darkened with determination. He pulled out his diamond-encrusted phone. "Daddy will make them open for us. Daddy can do anything!"

Evelyn intercepted the call. "Let me handle this, sweetheart."

As their hostess, one call to Bennett secured immediate access. Within minutes, the massive glass doors slid open, revealing a nervous-looking marine biologist.

"President Sterling! What an unexpected honor," the man stammered, bowing slightly. "We're actually undergoing maintenance today, but for you..."

Isabella shook her head in disbelief. Yet another reminder that in their world, closed doors simply didn't exist.

Blackwood Enterprises Headquarters

Harrison knocked twice before entering Nathan Blackwood's office. The CEO didn't glance up from the contract he was annotating.

"Speak."

Harrison cleared his throat. "Bennett just called regarding Ms. Sterling. She's visiting our aquarium facility today during its closure."

Nathan's fountain pen stilled. He lifted his gaze, mercury eyes sharpening.

Harrison continued hastily, "I've already approved the request, of course. But given your... interest in Ms. Sterling's activities..."

Nathan stood abruptly, his tailored suit accentuating his imposing frame. "How's that aquarium performing?"

"It was named California's top tourist attraction last quarter," Harrison reported. "Media outlets call it a 'bucket-list experience.' We limit to eighty visitors daily with reservations booked three months out."

A noncommittal hum was Nathan's only response. Such achievements barely registered on Blackwood Enterprises' scale.

As Nathan strode toward the door, Harrison ventured, "Shall I have the director prepare a full report?"

"Unnecessary." The words sliced through the air like winter wind as Nathan disappeared into the private elevator.
###Chapter 385 Little Baby

Nathan Blackwood, Evelyn Sinclair, and Isabella Montgomery couldn't stand watching the enormous fish and whales swimming around any longer.

They found a quiet corner to sit and enjoy their coffee.

The aquarium was unusually serene. The staff hovered nearby, anxious that the coffee they served might not meet the expectations of their distinguished guests.

Evelyn glanced around. "No fish in this section?" she asked, relieved.

The aquarist hesitated before answering, "Yes, Ms. Sinclair."

"This is the mantis shrimp exhibit. Since they aren’t particularly rare, fewer visitors come here."

"Would you like to see them?"

Mantis shrimp? Evelyn met the aquarist’s hopeful gaze and nodded.

Though, if she were being honest, she was more interested in eating them than admiring them.

The aquarist dimmed the overhead lights. Immediately, the walls, floor, and ceiling illuminated with a soft blue glow, mimicking the depths of the ocean.

The dim lighting created an illusion of being submerged in the deep sea. Evelyn leaned closer to the tank, spotting dozens of shrimp darting inside.

These weren’t the same mantis shrimp served on plates. The ones in the tank were oddly… cute.

They varied in size and color—some were stark white with black markings, simple yet mesmerizing. Others shimmered in vibrant greens and reds, their tails flickering with iridescent hues.

In the simulated seabed, they burrowed into the gravel, their slender bodies weaving gracefully through the water.

When the lights dimmed completely, Evelyn and Isabella felt as if they had been transported to the ocean floor. The walls vanished, leaving only the illusion of endless water surrounding them.

The corridor they had just walked through now resembled an underwater tunnel.

Above them, strands of seaweed and coral swayed gently. The deep, rhythmic sound of waves filled the space, enhancing the illusion of being submerged.

Isabella gasped. "A mantis shrimp exhibit?"

The aquarist launched into his well-rehearsed explanation. "The mantis shrimp is a predatory species, originating from the Mesozoic Jurassic period—"

Evelyn interrupted, eyes gleaming. "Are they all edible?"

The aquarist’s smile faltered. He glanced between the two eager women and forced a polite nod.

"Yes… if they’re fresh."

Under normal circumstances, he would have thrown out anyone who asked that. But these were VIP guests.

He sighed inwardly. Poor mantis shrimps.

Evelyn and Isabella exchanged a knowing look, grinning. Lunch plans had just been decided.

"By the way," the aquarist added, "you can purchase naming rights for any creature here. Choose one as your pet, and we’ll care for it in the aquarium. You can visit anytime."

Evelyn’s interest piqued. She pointed at a particularly vibrant mantis shrimp, its body sleek and colorful.

"Then I want this little baby."

"Certainly, Ms. Sinclair. This is a rare specimen acquired from the Mariana Trench at considerable expense."

"What would you like to name it?"

Without hesitation, Evelyn declared, "Nathan Blackwood."

The aquarist’s hand jerked, nearly dropping the expensive remote.

Isabella burst into laughter, clapping Evelyn’s shoulder.

"Little baby? You just want to devour him, don’t you?"

"Perfect name," Evelyn agreed smugly.

At the tunnel’s entrance, a tall, imposing figure stood frozen. His sharp features were schooled into calm, but his dark eyes narrowed dangerously.

In their eyes, I’m a mantis shrimp?

Isabella’s laughter abruptly cut off when she spotted him.
###Chapter 386 Are You That Desperate to Devour Me?

Nathan Blackwood entered with deliberate steps, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn Sinclair's back. The aquarium staff member quickly stepped aside, making way for their unexpected visitor.

This marked the first time their elusive CEO had personally inspected operations. Oblivious to the presence behind her, Evelyn tapped her chin thoughtfully while examining the display tank.

"Grilled or fried?" she mused aloud. Before Isabella Montgomery could respond, Nathan's rich baritone voice floated over her shoulder.

"Are you that desperate to devour me?"

Evelyn's spine went rigid. She whirled around, shock flashing across her features before settling into familiar irritation.

"You again?" she snapped. "Do I look thrilled to see you?"

Nathan's lips curved into an indulgent smile. "Which part of your expression suggests delight, darling?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Was the man blind?

His attention shifted to the mantis shrimp she'd been observing. "You called me 'baby'," he pointed out with amusement. Though merely a sea creature, the shrimp bore his nickname. By extension, it represented him.

Evelyn scoffed. "I was talking to the shrimp."

Nathan didn't press the argument. She'd never admit it anyway. Meanwhile, young Oliver Sinclair happily explored the aquarium exhibits alone.

Excited to share his discoveries, the boy went searching for his beloved "Muse" - only to encounter that detestable man again. Oliver's face scrunched in displeasure as he stomped over, glaring up at Nathan with undisguised contempt.

"Why are you here?" the child demanded.

Nathan had zero patience for the little nuisance. Oliver grabbed Evelyn's hand, beaming up at her with wide, innocent eyes. "Muse, I want to buy the thirty-meter blue whale from the next exhibit and ship it to Italy. What do you think?"

Evelyn frowned. The massive creature couldn't possibly fit on any plane or ship. Was it supposed to swim across the Atlantic?

Nathan's cold interjection came before she could respond. "No."

His tone turned glacial when addressing anyone other than Evelyn. Oliver crossed his chubby arms in outrage.

"Who says I can't buy it?" Nothing was beyond his father's means! Nathan regarded him with icy detachment.

"Because this is my aquarium."

Oliver's cherubic face cycled through shock, anger, and internal conflict before settling on stubborn defiance. With a dramatic huff, he tugged Evelyn's hand. "Come on, Muse! Let's go!"

"I might consider selling it..." Nathan's playful murmur stopped them mid-step. "...if you call me 'Big Brother'."

Isabella shuddered at the teasing tone.

Oliver froze, mouth working soundlessly. His expressive face contorted with the weight of this moral dilemma - perhaps the most challenging decision of his young life. Even Evelyn pitied his struggle.

The longer the boy hesitated, the darker Nathan's expression grew.

Finally, Oliver squared his little shoulders. Clenching his fists, he met Nathan's gaze with unyielding sapphire eyes. "NO. WAY."

He'd sooner abandon his beloved whale than compromise his integrity. "Daddy says good boys never lie," Oliver thought proudly.

Evelyn and Isabella burst into laughter at his principled stand. The child had spine!

Isabella's mirth suddenly died. "Thank goodness I never asked him to call me 'Muse'," she realized. "I'd be humiliated like Nathan." The thought killed her amusement completely.
###Chapter 387 She Was Terrified

Evelyn Sinclair and Isabella Montgomery left the aquarium with little Oliver Sinclair in tow.

Nathan Blackwood followed a few steps behind them.

"How about lunch? I know this amazing seafood place," Nathan suggested with a hopeful smile.

Evelyn, Isabella, and Oliver turned simultaneously, their voices blending in perfect unison: "No way!"

Nathan chuckled as Evelyn quickened her pace toward the car, deliberately maintaining distance. She couldn't shake the feeling he'd cling to her like ivy on a brick wall.

A sleek black sedan idled fifty meters away, its driver watching intently. The moment Evelyn stepped onto the pavement, the engine roared to life.

Tires screeched as the vehicle accelerated directly toward her.

"Evelyn!" Isabella's scream pierced the air.

A blur of movement. Strong arms shoved Evelyn aside with bone-jarring force.

The world became a cacophony of crushing metal and shattering glass.

The car plowed into an ancient oak, its hood crumpling like paper. Smoke curled from the wreckage.

Silence descended like a shroud.

Oliver trembled, his small voice quivering. "Pretty Lady... that strange man..."

Evelyn lay sprawled across the sidewalk, her left arm screaming in protest. Her pulse hammered against her ribs, each beat echoing the moment of impact.

She turned her head slowly.

Nathan lay motionless in the street, his designer suit now a canvas of crimson.

Just minutes ago, those piercing gray eyes had sparkled with amusement as he teased her about lunch. Now they stared blankly at the sky.

Something inside Evelyn fractured.

"Call an ambulance!" Isabella scrambled to Evelyn's side. "Are you hurt?"

The words sounded distant, muffled as if underwater.

Oliver tapped frantically on his smartwatch, his forced calm betrayed by the tremor in his voice as he spoke to emergency services.

Evelyn crawled toward Nathan on hands and knees. Dust coated his usually immaculate hair. His lips had lost all color.

Blood pooled beneath him, spreading in dark tendrils across the asphalt.

Her vision blurred. Each breath became a struggle, her lungs constricting with invisible bands of iron.

He'd saved her. Again.

Isabella shook her shoulders. "Evelyn! Snap out of it!"

The world snapped back into focus. Evelyn pulled her cracked phone from her pocket and began issuing commands with military precision.

First Bennett - arrange the best medical team. Then Harrison - secure the hospital. Preston Sinclair - come collect Oliver immediately. Finally, the police.

Her voice turned arctic as she addressed Isabella. "Stay here. Guard that driver. Alive or dead, I want answers."

The ambulance arrived in under four minutes.

At the hospital, time stretched into agony. Evelyn sat statue-still in the waiting room, her hands clenched so tightly her nails left crescent moons in her palms.

Harrison appeared with tissues. "Ms. Sinclair... you're crying."

Only then did Evelyn notice the hot tears carving paths down her cheeks. A sob wrenched itself from her throat as she doubled over, shoulders shaking.

Raw terror washed over her in waves.

She was petrified. Not of the attack. Not of the pain.

But of losing Nathan forever.

The operating room doors burst open.
###Chapter 388: The Fallout

News of Nathan Blackwood's accident spread like wildfire through the elite circles of Montecito.

Margaret Blackwood, the formidable matriarch, arrived at the hospital in a flurry of designer silk and suppressed rage. Her husband, William Sterling, followed close behind, his expression unreadable.

The revelation that Nathan had thrown himself in front of a speeding car to save Evelyn Sinclair turned Margaret's grief into something darker. Her manicured nails dug into her palms as the doctors spoke.

William Sterling had seen enough tragedies to school his features, but the tension in his jaw betrayed him. After hours of silent vigil, his butler Archibald finally escorted him home when exhaustion won.

Margaret's wails echoed through the private ward for two solid hours.

Evelyn sat motionless in the VIP lounge, her porcelain face a mask of calm as Margaret's venomous words washed over her.

"You vile creature! This is the second time my son nearly died because of you!" Margaret's voice cracked with hysteria. "First that yacht explosion, now this? And you made him send Sophia away! What witchcraft have you cast on him?"

Harrison and Bennett exchanged uneasy glances at Evelyn's eerie stillness. She might as well have been carved from marble.

When Alexander Sterling arrived with Donovan, Margaret's tirade reached new heights. Alexander's glacial glare could have frozen hell over.

"Enough," William said firmly, placing a protective hand on Evelyn's shoulder. "You're coming home, darling. You haven't slept in forty-eight hours."

Evelyn lifted bloodshot eyes to her father. The hope in them had been extinguished.

Harrison stepped forward. "Mr. Blackwood has remarkable resilience. The doctors confirmed only a concussion and fractured femur. He'll recover fully—but you need rest too, Ms. Sinclair."

The implication hung unspoken—Nathan would be devastated to see her like this.

Margaret stormed out, her Chanel heels striking the marble like gunshots. "Rest? How dare you think of resting when my son—"

Alexander cut her off with a voice like shards of ice. "Mrs. Blackwood, while we're grateful for your son's bravery, Evelyn didn't force him into that street. Your accusations are beneath you."

The temperature in the room dropped several degrees. Even Margaret hesitated, remembering too late the Sterlings weren't just wealthy—they were power incarnate.

"You—" she sputtered.

A harried doctor chose that moment to intervene. "For God's sake, the patient needs quiet!" He glared pointedly at Margaret. "This isn't a theater."

Alexander's smirk was razor-sharp. "Clearly some people care more about drama than their own family's recovery."

Margaret's face purpled with rage, but the doctor's warning stare silenced her. She collapsed onto a divan with theatrical flourish.

Alexander retrieved Evelyn's shattered phone from the side table, handing it to Bennett along with her Birkin. In one fluid motion, he pulled Evelyn to her feet.

"Home. Now." His tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn rose mechanically, casting a last glance at Harrison, who gave a subtle nod. He'd call if Nathan's condition changed.

Her smile was a ghost of its usual brilliance as she let herself be led away.
###Chapter 389 I Surrender

The car ride was tense.

William pulled out a thick envelope from the glove compartment. "The police provided these. They're conducting an official investigation, but we'll be running our own parallel inquiry."

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she accepted the photos. The image of Nathan pushing her out of harm's way flashed before her eyes again.

How had he found the courage to charge toward a vehicle speeding at 70 mph?

Her knuckles turned white against the glossy prints.

Alexander exhaled heavily. "We owe Nathan Blackwood twice now. Evie, I don't think he'll ever let you go."

If Nathan could walk away from Evelyn, why would he repeatedly risk his life for her?

One incident could be dismissed as coincidence. But this pattern was impossible to ignore.

William massaged his temples. "He can't expect your devotion just because of this. Though I must admit, I'm starting to respect the boy. Your happiness comes first."

Evelyn bit her lip, her pulse stuttering as she studied the next photograph.

The driver's lifeless body slumped over the steering wheel - a completely ordinary face that would blend into any crowd.

Blood crusted his forehead where it had smashed against the wheel.

"Died on impact," Alexander explained, noticing Evelyn's frown. "Police initially ruled it drunk driving, but an overseas account transferred over a million dollars to him recently. They can't close the case yet."

"A million dollars?" Evelyn whispered. "For my life?"

The absurdity struck her - a million dollars to have Nathan die in her place.

Alexander's mouth tightened. "For a washed-up alcoholic, this was probably the only way he'd ever see that kind of money."

"Stay indoors for now," William interjected. "If you must go out, take security. Next time, you might not be so lucky."

His weary eyes darkened with concern.

Alexander nodded in agreement.

Evelyn straightened. "I can't live in hiding. Arrange for bodyguards."

She knew the drill.

All she wanted was the name of whoever wanted her dead.

They would pay tenfold.

Exhaustion overwhelmed her the moment she reached her bedroom. She collapsed onto the silk sheets, unconscious before her head hit the pillow.

When she awoke, golden light filtered through the trees outside her window.

The sunset painted the sky in fiery hues - breathtakingly beautiful.

She'd slept through an entire day.

A new phone waited on her nightstand. Alexander had transferred all her data and reinstalled every app.

Dozens of notifications lit up the screen.

Concerned messages. Questions about her wellbeing. Inquiries about Nathan's condition.

In her close friends' group chat:

[Isabella Montgomery: Okay, I've officially changed my mind about Nathan. Two life-risking rescues? You might want to reconsider @EvelynSinclair]

[Natalie Beaumont: Seconded.]

[Isabella Montgomery: No pressure though @EvelynSinclair! Even if romance isn't in the cards, we'll stop hating him.]

[Natalie Beaumont: What she said.]

[Isabella Montgomery: Can't you form your own opinions?! @NatalieBeaumont]

[Natalie Beaumont: Too lazy to type what you already articulated perfectly! @IsabellaMontgomery]

[Sebastian Hart: Nathan just earned my eternal respect. I officially surrender T_T]

[Isabella Montgomery: Sebastian, didn't you give up ages ago?]

[Natalie Beaumont: ^This.]

[Sebastian Hart: Fine! Leaving this toxic group now =P]
###Chapter 390 He's Gone

Evelyn Sinclair ignored all incoming messages. She took a long shower, applied a luxurious face mask, and emerged looking visibly rejuvenated.

William Sterling waited downstairs for his daughter to join him for dinner. His eyes followed every movement as Evelyn ate, exhaling in relief when she finished her bowl of soup.

"Evelyn, my dear," he began hesitantly, "you mustn't feel burdened by all this."

A practiced smile touched Evelyn's lips.

"I understand. I'll be fine. Nathan's out of danger now. I'll repay him for everything in due time." She paused, her voice dropping. "But the rest... I can't discuss it yet."

Strangely, Evelyn found she couldn't hate him as intensely as before.

The fleeting thought of reconciliation surfaced, but she dismissed it immediately.

All she truly wanted was for Nathan to recover.

Their history was too complicated, too entangled to determine who owed whom more.

William nodded approvingly, pleased his daughter had reached this clarity.

He gestured toward a towering figure in a tailored black suit and sunglasses who exuded intimidating energy.

"A bodyguard?" Evelyn recognized the professional attire instantly.

"Marcus," William confirmed. "Former special forces. He's been with me for years, but since I retired to fishing, he's been underutilized. He'll be your personal protection now."

Evelyn pressed her lips together but accepted her father's thoughtful gesture.

"Ms. Sinclair," Marcus greeted with a slight bow.

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "I appreciate your service, Marcus."

The bodyguard's stern expression remained unchanged as he acknowledged her.

Suddenly, Evelyn's phone shattered the moment's calm. Harrison's name flashed on the screen.

She answered immediately.

"Ms. Sinclair, urgent news! President Blackwood—"

Harrison's hesitation made Evelyn's blood run cold. She ended the call and bolted for the door in panic.

Marcus had the car ready before she reached the driveway. "Get in!" he barked.

Evelyn didn't hesitate.

What should have been a twenty-minute drive became ten under Marcus's expert handling.

Evelyn sprinted to Nathan's hospital room, throwing the door open with trembling hands.

Neither Margaret Blackwood nor the elder Mr. Blackwood were present.

Harrison sat slumped in the visitor's chair, his face drawn. "Ms. Sinclair..."

Evelyn's heart plummeted as she rushed forward.

The figure on the bed lay motionless, just as he had yesterday—but now devoid of all vitality. His complexion had turned ashen, the medical monitors disconnected, his chest frighteningly still.

For a moment, Evelyn stood paralyzed as darkness threatened to consume her vision.

This couldn't be real.

The doctors had assured her he would recover!

Agony crushed her chest, making each breath painful. The anguish felt physical, as if her very cells were screaming in protest.

Her legs buckled as consciousness wavered.

Harrison lunged forward. "Ms. Sinclair!"

He caught her just in time.

At that moment, Evelyn noticed it—the faintest twitch beneath the hospital blanket. A nearly imperceptible movement of Nathan's right foot.

Her entire body stiffened with realization.

After several heartbeats, she regained her composure with startling speed.

Harrison blinked in astonishment at her sudden transformation from devastated to composed.

Evelyn approached the bed with measured steps. Her cool fingertips brushed Nathan's pale cheek.

In a voice like polished ice, she asked, "Have the funeral arrangements been made?"
###Chapter 391 Burn You

Harrison inhaled sharply at Evelyn's words, completely at a loss for how to respond.

But the man lying motionless on the hospital bed could no longer keep up the act. In the next second, he sat up abruptly.

"You're already planning my cremation?!"

Nathan's chest rose and fell rapidly, though it was unclear whether from lack of air or sheer fury.

He had barely survived a horrific car crash, only to nearly die from rage because of Evelyn.

When Nathan first regained consciousness, Harrison had painted a vivid picture of Evelyn's devastation—how she had wept, how desperate she had been.

Nathan had felt a surge of energy. Maybe this injury wasn't for nothing.

But he hadn't witnessed her grief firsthand.

So he decided to play dead.

Maybe this is my chance to win her back.

Yet the moment Evelyn saw him "lifeless," her first question was about funeral arrangements.

Nathan couldn't take it anymore.

Evelyn stood with her arms crossed, her expression unreadable as she studied him.

"Oh. So you're not dead?"

Nathan was speechless.

Not only had she failed to show the tenderness he'd hoped for, but she actually looked disappointed that he was alive.

His jaw clenched, his eyes reddening with a wounded expression. He stared at her silently.

Evelyn hesitated. A pang of bitterness twisted inside her. She dropped her mocking gaze.

"I'm glad you're alive, Nathan."

She was truly glad.

The moment the words left her lips, Nathan's face lit up. The storm in his eyes vanished instantly.

He reached out and yanked her into his arms.

Evelyn hadn't expected him to be so strong despite his injuries. Caught off guard, she stumbled against his chest.

The crisp, clean scent of him enveloped her. His heartbeat was steady and strong beneath her ear.

Her vision blurred before she could stop it.

She felt his arms tighten around her but didn’t pull away, afraid of aggravating his wounds. His fingers gently stroked her hair.

His voice was rough, barely above a whisper. "I almost didn’t get to see you again."

That had been his greatest fear.

Silence stretched between them. His pulse quickened as he held her close.

Evelyn lifted her head and rolled her eyes.

"Are you done? Or do I need to force my way out?"

Reluctantly, Nathan released her.

He gave her a weak smile. "I’m no match for you right now..."

Ahem. Harrison stood awkwardly in the doorway, unsure whether to stay or leave.

Did they forget I’m still here?

Both turned to look at him. Nathan’s glare was sharp enough to flay skin.

Harrison’s lips twitched. "I didn’t do it on purpose!"

"Just pretend I’m not here!"

He ducked his head and made to leave, but Evelyn stopped him.

"Wait."

Here it comes. Harrison braced himself.

Evelyn took several deliberate steps back, putting distance between herself and Nathan.

Her gaze turned icy as she scrutinized Harrison.

"When you called me, you said there was bad news. What exactly did you mean?"

Harrison froze. He glanced at Nathan for help, but the man looked like he was perfectly content to let him take the fall.

Now I have to cover for him?!

Forcing a smile, Harrison stammered, "Oh! I—I didn’t get to finish! What I meant was—bad news, President Blackwood woke up and insists on checking out! Heh."

He mentally patted himself on the back for the quick save.

Evelyn arched a brow and turned to Nathan.

"You want to be discharged?"

Nathan paused, then nodded.

"It’s inconvenient to work here. I’d rather recover at home."

His tone was deadly serious.

Evelyn considered it. With round-the-clock care at Highland Estates, he might heal faster.

"Fine. Take care, then."

She made no move to stop him.
###Chapter 392 Bound by Duty at Highland Estates

Evelyn was about to leave when she felt a tug on her blouse.

Nathan sat propped up on the hospital bed, his movement strained. The simple act of reaching for her had cost him dearly.

A sharp pain shot through his right leg. His face drained of color as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

Evelyn's breath caught. "Nathan!"

He clenched his jaw, veins protruding at his temples. The agony was written across his features.

"Get a doctor!" Evelyn turned to Harrison.

Harrison hesitated only a second before rushing out. Nathan hated seeing Evelyn so distressed.

With effort, he raised his hand to brush her cheek.

Evelyn froze but didn't pull away, afraid any movement might worsen his injury.

"It's... nothing," he managed through gritted teeth, forcing a reassuring smile that didn't reach his eyes.

Her heart clenched. She knew better than anyone how much pain he must be enduring.

Within moments, a team of specialists flooded the room.

Six white coats surrounded Nathan's bed.

Evelyn stepped back to give them space, though Nathan's gaze never left her.

She lingered by the doorway, typing rapid messages on her phone.

Ten minutes later, the examination concluded.

"Mr. Blackwood, the fracture in your right tibia requires significant recovery time. No weight-bearing activities for at least six months, or you risk permanent mobility issues."

The most severe injury from the accident, thankfully, was the broken leg.

Nathan merely grunted in acknowledgment.

The lead physician continued, "You'll need round-the-clock care during your rehabilitation. Without proper assistance—"

Nathan's dark glare silenced the doctor mid-sentence.

The medical team retreated quickly, Harrison following them out.

Now alone, Evelyn noticed the metal brace encasing Nathan's lower leg for the first time.

Her stomach twisted, though her expression remained neutral.

"I'll arrange for a private nurse."

"Why not you?" Nathan's voice was deceptively light.

Her eyes narrowed. "Excuse me?"

His smile turned wolfish. "This injury is your responsibility, Evelyn. Or have you forgotten already?"

Any gratitude she felt evaporated instantly.

Typical Nathan—give him an inch and he'd take a mile.

She rolled her eyes so hard it hurt. "Dream on."

"Care for me, and we'll call it even." His tone shifted. "Unless you'd rather explain to your father why the Blackwoods are demanding marriage to settle this debt... again."

The air between them turned to ice.

After this second life-saving intervention, William Sterling would have no grounds to refuse.

Published by N?v''elD/rama.Org.

One rescue might be repaid in other ways. But two? Society would brand the Sterlings as ungrateful.

And old Mr. Blackwood was nothing if not persistent.

Evelyn's expression cycled through several emotions before she exhaled sharply.

"Fine. Until you're healed."

The words tasted bitter, but the alternative was worse.

She couldn't bear owing Nathan any more than she already did.

His triumphant smirk made her regret the decision immediately.

"But you're staying at the hospital where—"

"Highland Estates," Nathan interrupted firmly. "We're going home."

Home. The word hung between them like an accusation.

Highland Estates—their former marital residence. The place she'd fled after their divorce, the place he'd stubbornly remained.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

Damn her quick tongue. She'd walked right into his trap.
###Chapter 393 The Lady Returns

Evelyn Sinclair intended to return to Highland Estates to gather her belongings while informing her father and brothers about this decision.

Nathan Blackwood immediately instructed Harrison to initiate the discharge process, eager to recuperate in the comfort of his own home.

Despite his injuries, he displayed more energy than usual.

Harrison efficiently completed the discharge formalities and arranged for a thorough cleaning of Highland Estates.

Nathan personally inspected every corner of the mansion in his wheelchair, scrutinizing the cleanliness with meticulous attention.

Beatrice, the housekeeper who had served since before the divorce, remained employed because Nathan believed Evelyn was accustomed to her presence.

Beatrice trembled under Nathan's icy, critical gaze when he questioned her.

"Are Lady Sinclair's possessions still here?"

"Y-Yes, sir," Beatrice stammered. "You explicitly ordered that none of the lady's belongings should be discarded."

Nathan nodded approvingly before turning to Harrison.

"Contact the major fashion houses to deliver new collections. Remove all out-of-season clothing, shoes, and handbags from the dressing room. I don't want her distressed upon seeing them."

Harrison nearly rolled his eyes. In his opinion, it was Nathan who couldn't bear the sight of those reminders.

But he merely nodded obediently. "Understood, sir."

At Sterling Manor...

When Evelyn mentioned her plan, Lucas Sterling nearly exploded with rage. "Absolutely not! I forbid it!"

In Lucas's view, Nathan clearly harbored ulterior motives.

William Sterling studied his daughter carefully. "Are you certain about this?" Evelyn gave a firm nod. Alexander remained silent, knowing his sister's stubborn nature once she made up her mind.

"Father! Alexander! How can you just agree like this? Have you no spine?" Lucas glared at them in disbelief.

Alexander shot him a cool glance. "Then perhaps you'd like to personally care for Nathan in Evelyn's stead?"

"In his dreams! If I go there, I'll throw him down the stairs and finish what the accident started!" Lucas fumed, steam practically rising from his head.

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Don't overthink it. I'm not going as his caretaker. Besides, Marcus will accompany me."

The three men looked at her with newfound admiration, giving simultaneous thumbs-up.

Their concern was touching but unnecessary.

Evelyn shrugged nonchalantly.

Nathan hadn't specified anything about bodyguards.

She packed only a small suitcase, prepared to leave immediately if uncomfortable. She had no intention of playing nurse.

Marcus, however, arrived with an enormous trunk, his expression grim as he waited by the entrance.

Evelyn blinked in surprise but held her tongue.

Perhaps his luggage contained an arsenal?

Marcus offered no explanation. His instincts warned this wouldn't be a short visit, so he came prepared for an extended stay.

At Highland Estates...

Evelyn wore a simple pastel dress that accentuated her graceful figure. Marcus stood imposingly behind her, effortlessly carrying both suitcases while radiating an intimidating aura that kept bystanders at bay.

Evelyn expected to feel hatred returning here, but standing at the threshold, she felt only detachment. Her last visit seemed like another lifetime.

That chapter was closed forever.

Marcus knocked, and the door opened immediately.

Before Evelyn could enter, Beatrice rushed forward excitedly, grasping her hands.

"My lady! You've finally returned! I've missed you terribly!"

Disgust flashed in Evelyn's eyes as she swiftly withdrew her hands. In an instant, Marcus stepped between them.

His massive frame shielded Evelyn completely. "Step back," he growled. "She's not your lady anymore."
###Chapter 394. Your Room

Beatrice gasped when she saw the intimidating Marcus blocking her path. Her hands trembled as she instinctively stepped back.

"W-Who are you?" she stammered.

Marcus didn't bother with introductions. He shoved the door open forcefully.

With a deep, commanding voice, he announced, "Miss Sinclair, after you."

Evelyn walked past without sparing Beatrice a glance. There was no point pretending sentimentality.

The woman had always been Nathan's spy anyway.

Ignoring the nanny's nervous expression, Evelyn strode inside confidently.

Her designer heels clicked sharply against the polished hardwood floors. The sound echoed through the grand foyer.

In the living room, Nathan sat in his wheelchair wearing light gray loungewear. His pale complexion couldn't hide his striking features.

The cast on his right leg made him appear vulnerable, softening his usual intimidating presence.

When he saw Evelyn, his grip tightened on the wheelchair arms. His eyes brightened instantly.

"Evelyn," he said softly, almost reverently. "You're finally home."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly as she scanned the room. Then her expression froze.

Everything remained exactly as she'd left it.

Not a single item out of place. The entire space gleamed spotlessly.

She looked away abruptly, narrowing her eyes.

"I'll take my things to the guest room first."

Turning sharply, she motioned for Marcus to follow upstairs.

"Let Beatrice handle that," Nathan interjected, frowning. "You shouldn't be carrying your own luggage."

His sharp gaze landed on the trembling nanny.

Beatrice jumped to attention, rushing forward to take the suitcase from Marcus.

"Allow me, Mrs. Blackwood. Your room is ready, just as you left it."

Marcus shifted away, blocking her with a warning glare.

Beatrice withdrew her hand nervously, glancing at Evelyn for direction.

But Evelyn wasn't looking at her. Instead, she fixed Nathan with a sideways glance.

"What's this about?"

Did he expect her to sleep in their old bedroom?

Nathan pressed his lips together before answering gently, "The guest room isn't prepared yet. Your old room has all your belongings. It would be inconvenient to move everything."

Evelyn didn't care enough to argue. She'd only be staying temporarily anyway.

She arched one perfect eyebrow. "Fine."

Her easy agreement visibly brightened Nathan's mood. A rare smile touched his lips.

As Evelyn ascended the stairs with Marcus, Beatrice called out hesitantly, "Mrs. Blackwood—"

Evelyn stopped mid-step. When she turned, her gaze could freeze fire.

"Nathan Blackwood," she said icily, "I came here out of mutual respect and a shred of guilt. But if your staff oversteps again, consider our arrangement terminated."

Mrs. Blackwood? As if she'd ever want that title again.

She wouldn't tolerate repeated disrespect.

Though the words weren't directed at Beatrice, they struck like a physical blow. Evelyn's tone cut sharper than any blade.

Nathan's smile faltered briefly before he recovered smoothly. "Understood," he murmured pleasantly.

The moment Evelyn turned away, Nathan's expression darkened. His glare at Beatrice could have turned wine to vinegar.

The nanny trembled violently. What had she done wrong? Evelyn used to insist on being called Mrs. Blackwood.

Back when no one in the Blackwood household respected her, Beatrice had addressed her as "Miss Sinclair."

Evelyn had thrown a fit, accusing her of deliberate disrespect.

From then on, Beatrice had reluctantly used the formal title.
###Chapter 395 Take Care of You

The Highland Estates mansion stood elegantly with its two-story structure, flooded with natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows.

A discreet elevator connected both levels, ensuring Nathan Blackwood's wheelchair access remained effortless throughout the property.

Evelyn Sinclair ascended the stairs and paused in the doorway of her former bedroom.

Everything remained frozen in time—the ivory silk bedding, the crystal perfume bottles on the vanity, even the novel left splayed on the nightstand.

Memories crashed over her like icy waves.

Her chest constricted painfully, as if an invisible hand squeezed her ribs with cruel precision.

She used to perch on that balcony chaise for hours, foolishly hoping to spot Nathan's black Maybach turning through the wrought iron gates below.

He never came.

Not once in three years.

The room smelled faintly of the jasmine perfume she'd favored back then—now the scent made her nauseous.

Evelyn's lips twisted into a humorless smile as she grabbed a wastebasket. With one sweeping motion, she cleared the vanity of all trinkets, listening to them clatter against the metal interior.

The walk-in closet revealed racks of designer clothing with tags still attached, shelves of Italian leather shoes in her exact size, and a glass case displaying diamond jewelry worth more than some houses.

She shut the door without touching anything.

Footsteps echoed in the hallway.

Beatrice, the housemaid, stood wringing her hands near the intimidating figure of Marcus—Evelyn's personal bodyguard.

"Ms. Sinclair," Beatrice stammered, "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence for dinner."

Evelyn checked her diamond-encrusted watch. "Tell him I'll be down shortly."

The maid scurried away as Evelyn descended the grand staircase, her stiletto heels clicking like a metronome against the marble steps.

Golden hour painted the living room in warm hues, the sheer drapes fluttering like ghosts against the evening breeze.

Nathan sat at the dining table, closing his laptop as she approached. A cashmere throw draped over his legs did nothing to diminish the powerful lines of his broad shoulders.

"Hungry?" His voice was deep velvet.

In the kitchen, Beatrice whispered loudly enough to be heard, "Chef prepared all your favorites, Ms. Sinclair. Lobster thermidor, truffle risotto, that chocolate soufflé you—"

"I don't eat dinner." Evelyn settled into her chair opposite Nathan. "But do ensure Marcus gets a proper meal."

Nathan's jaw tightened as he noticed the hulking bodyguard positioning himself behind Evelyn's chair. Marcus stood motionless, his alert gaze continuously scanning the room despite his neutral expression.

"Your watchdog can take the night off," Nathan said smoothly. "You're perfectly safe here."

Evelyn flipped open a fashion magazine with deliberate disinterest. "Marcus stays. Consider him part of the decor if his presence bothers you."

A muscle ticked in Nathan's cheek. He reached for his wineglass, the crystal catching the candlelight. "Since you're here to care for me," he murmured, lips curling at the edges, "why don't you demonstrate by feeding me?"

His challenge hung in the air between them, thick as the aroma of freshly baked bread wafting from the kitchen.

Evelyn slowly lowered her magazine.

Across the table, Nathan's storm-gray eyes gleamed with something dangerous.

And for the first time since her return, Evelyn felt the faintest spark of something other than resentment.

It terrified her.
###Chapter 396 Granting Every Wish

The atmosphere grew thick with tension.

Nathan knew he was testing his luck, but if he didn't take this chance, how would he ever discover the truth?

Evelyn hesitated briefly. She rested her chin on her palm, studying him with amusement dancing in her eyes.

A delicate smile played across her lips.

Yet her voice remained cool and detached when she finally spoke.

"Did your brain get injured along with your arm?"

Her smile never reached her eyes, yet it was impossible to resist its charm.

Seeing she wasn't angry, Nathan's grin widened. He immediately adopted a self-mocking tone.

His voice dropped to a regretful murmur.

"Are you really going to abandon me so quickly? Can't you do this one small thing for me?"

Evelyn's eyebrow twitched imperceptibly. What was wrong with this man? If he weren't injured, she'd have left him in the dust already!

Why was she still here enduring this ridiculous performance? His acting skills were atrocious!

She turned away with an exasperated sigh. Just bear with it a little longer.

In the next instant, Marcus stepped forward and picked up the soup bowl in front of Nathan.

"Mr. Blackwood, allow me—"

Marcus held the spoon to Nathan's lips with a terrifying scowl that contrasted sharply with his gentle actions.

He was feeding Nathan like an infant.

Marcus even exaggeratedly opened his own mouth, making an "ahh" sound as if teaching a toddler to eat.

Silence descended upon the dining room.

Evelyn couldn't contain her laughter any longer.

Nathan's expression froze into something decidedly unpleasant.

But as Evelyn's bodyguard, Marcus couldn't care less about Nathan's feelings.

Within seconds, Nathan's mouth twitched. He reached out to take the bowl from the bodyguard's hands, his voice icy.

"My arms work perfectly fine. I'll feed myself."

Marcus wisely retreated behind Evelyn, standing guard like a stone sentinel.

After that incident, Nathan behaved much better, finishing his meal quietly with his head bowed.

Evelyn focused on responding to urgent emails from Bennett on her phone.

She didn't notice Nathan's lingering gaze fixed upon her.

After sending her replies, she set the phone down and looked up at him.

"Finished?"

Nathan nodded, his eyes softening with warmth.

Evelyn stood to clear the dishes when Nathan caught her wrist, giving her a helpless look.

"I didn't invite you here to be my maid."

Beatrice emerged from the kitchen immediately. "I'll take care of this, Miss Sinclair."

Evelyn arched a brow. She hadn't wanted to do it anyway.

Nathan patted his wheelchair, his gaze steady. "Let's go to the study."

Evelyn could handle small favors like this, so she moved behind him to push the wheelchair.

He could easily maneuver it himself, but having her do it filled him with quiet satisfaction.

Evelyn rolled her eyes discreetly as she guided him toward the elevator.

He probably had work to attend to in the study.

She made a mental note to go out with Isabella and Natalie later that evening.

In the second-floor study, Nathan studied Evelyn intently.

"There are too many confidential company documents here. Have your bodyguard wait outside."

Evelyn shrugged. "Fine."

Without needing instruction, Marcus took his position by the door.

Evelyn pushed Nathan inside. The study had transformed dramatically since her last visit.

Originally two adjoining rooms, the space had been nearly empty when only Evelyn used it.

Now floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined the walls, filled with leather-bound volumes.

Neatly categorized files occupied the arched shelves flanking the room. A massive rectangular desk dominated the center, bearing two laptops and scattered documents.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a peaceful glow across the space.

Evelyn paused momentarily before continuing to push him forward.

Nathan stopped her, pointing toward the tatami area across the room. "Over there..."
###Chapter 397 You're Sick

The tatami stretched wide beneath them, the room bathed in perfect ambient lighting.

Evelyn Sinclair carefully maneuvered Nathan Blackwood's wheelchair into place, suppressing an exasperated sigh. This man is nothing but trouble.

"What else do you need?" she asked, her tone clipped.

Nathan tilted his head, his expression stubborn. "I don't want to sit here. Move me over there. It's more comfortable."

He hated being confined to the wheelchair.

Evelyn paused, her brows knitting together. "I can't lift you," she stated bluntly.

Not unless she wanted to risk paralyzing him for good.

She was convinced he was just being difficult on purpose.

With a frustrated sigh, Nathan braced his hands on the armrests, shifting his weight onto his left leg. Every muscle in his body strained with the effort.

Just that small movement sent beads of sweat forming along his temple.

Evelyn's instincts kicked in before she could think. She lunged forward, catching him before he could topple over.

His full weight pressed against her, making her breath hitch. His scent—clean, crisp mint—wrapped around her, dizzyingly close.

When she glanced up, she found his gaze filled with quiet guilt. The sharp retort on her tongue died instantly.

He wouldn’t be in this state if he hadn’t saved her.

She was being petty.

So instead, she steadied him silently, carefully lowering him onto the tatami, mindful of his injured leg.

By the time he was settled, both of them were breathless, their skin damp with exertion.

Despite the pain etched across his face, his eyes remained soft, almost tender.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Tell me which files or laptop you need."

Before she could turn away, Nathan's fingers circled her wrist.

"No need," he murmured. "Just watch a movie with me."

His other hand reached for the remote. With a single press, the lights dimmed, the curtains slid shut, and a screen descended from the ceiling.

Evelyn froze.

All this trouble—just to watch a movie?

She whirled on him. "Nathan Blackwood, you're insufferable!"

Nathan merely smirked, his expression infuriatingly innocent.

"But I am sick," he pointed out.

Evelyn scoffed, yanking her hand free. "Watch it yourself."

"The doctor said I need relaxation and happiness to recover faster," he called after her.

Her steps faltered. Damn it. Did he really say that?

Nathan held out the remote. "You pick."

He remembered how unimpressed she’d been with his horror movie choice last time.

Evelyn snatched it from him, scrolling through the extensive library—new releases, classics, even unreleased films. Impressive, but unsurprising, given his investments in the industry.

She selected The Silent Dawn, a quiet, introspective drama, before tossing the remote aside and sitting as far from him as possible.

The space between them could fit two more people.

Nathan didn’t seem to mind. His lips curved slightly, contentment softening his features. Just having her here was enough.

Evelyn hugged a pillow, her expression relaxed as she skimmed the film’s synopsis.

Julian Moreau had a supporting role, but his presence was magnetic, stealing every scene he was in.

She focused on the screen, but the weight of Nathan’s gaze made her skin prickle. She shot him a glare.

"Aren’t you going to watch?"

Nathan blinked, feigning innocence before reluctantly turning back to the screen.

Then Julian appeared, and his jaw tightened.

A familiar, unwelcome tightness settled in his chest.

He closed his eyes instead, listening to the steady rhythm of Evelyn’s breathing.

Over an hour later, Evelyn was fighting off drowsiness. She glanced over—Nathan was already asleep, his arms crossed, his brow slightly furrowed even in rest.

She rolled her eyes. He insisted on this, and now he’s out cold.

Abandoning the film, she slipped out barefoot, careful not to wake him.

Her bodyguard stood sentinel outside. She pressed a finger to her lips before padding downstairs.

The lower floor was dim, seemingly empty.

But as she reached the kitchen, hushed whispers reached her ears.

"Yes, they’ve been upstairs for over an hour. Who knows what they’re doing?"
###Chapter 398 Eavesdropping

Nathan Blackwood had explicitly instructed me not to disturb them upstairs. Evelyn Sinclair was giving him the cold shoulder, but I could tell it was all an act. She was clearly playing hard to get.

The housekeeper, Beatrice, deliberately lowered her voice to a whisper.

Click. The kitchen lights suddenly flickered on.

Beatrice jumped in surprise, her phone clattering to the floor in panic.

In that brief moment before the screen dimmed, Evelyn caught the name displayed on it.

Margaret Blackwood.

So she was reporting to Nathan's mother? Evelyn's lips thinned.

Beatrice trembled visibly, her eyes wide with fear as she stammered, "M-Ms. Sinclair! W-what are you—"

Evelyn cut her off with an icy glare, her dark eyes devoid of any warmth.

She wordlessly retrieved a carton of milk, poured herself a glass, and left without another glance.

Beatrice's hands shook as she picked up her phone. Watching Evelyn's retreating figure, an uneasy feeling settled in her stomach.

Evelyn sipped her milk as she ascended the stairs, finishing it just as she reached the study door.

The earlier encounter left a bitter taste in her mouth.

This wasn't the first time. Beatrice had been planted here as Margaret's spy, monitoring Evelyn's every move and ensuring she performed her wifely duties perfectly.

Those dress shirts Nathan never wore still had to be immaculately pressed. The mansion's cleanliness fell solely on her shoulders. Even their meals had to follow Margaret's approved recipes.

Beatrice had been the watchful eye reaping the benefits of Evelyn's labor.

After all this time, Margaret still wants to control me? Some things never change.

Evelyn pushed open the study door with more force than necessary, making sure it made noise.

Nathan, who had been resting on the chaise lounge, startled awake.

"Going to bed?" Evelyn's tone was clipped, her mood noticeably darker than when she'd left.

Nathan rubbed his eyes, his voice rough with sleep. "Did I doze off? You should rest. Harrison will be sending over some documents later."

Evelyn arched a brow. Of course Nathan wouldn't neglect his responsibilities. The Blackwood Empire would always come first.

"Fine. I'm going to my room then." She slipped on her shoes. "Don't call me if you need anything. Actually, don't call me even if you do."

Nathan's lips quirked in amusement as he watched her leave.

The door slammed shut behind her.

Nathan's smile faded, his chest tightening uncomfortably.

Earlier, Evelyn had tiptoed out barefoot to avoid waking him.

Now she made sure he knew she was leaving.

Back in her room, Evelyn locked the door and spent the next few hours laughing with Isabella and Natalie over video call until late into the night.

It was nearly midnight when Nathan finished reviewing Harrison's documents.

Fatigue weighed heavily on him, but the thought of Evelyn resting just next door lifted his spirits.

He wheeled himself to her room, only to freeze at the sight before him.

His breath caught painfully in his chest.

Marcus, Evelyn's personal bodyguard, had set up camp directly outside her door.

The military-grade sleeping arrangement was alarmingly thorough—practical, efficient, and clearly meant for long-term use.

The massive man completely blocked access to Evelyn's room.

Nathan approached with a scowl. "Was the guest room not to your liking?" His voice dripped with barely concealed irritation.

Marcus didn't even bother standing, leaning casually against the wall with one knee bent. His challenging stare never wavered. "I'm not a guest. Where Ms. Sinclair goes, I go."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "I need to check on her."

The unspoken command was clear: Move.

"Ms. Sinclair is asleep," Marcus stated flatly.

"According to who?"

After a beat of silence, Marcus replied, "Chairman Sterling's orders. No one enters the young mistress' room without her explicit permission."

Nathan's retort died on his lips.

With William Sterling's name invoked, he knew better than to argue.
###Chapter 399 Wrong Prescription

Back in Nathan's suite, rage burned through him so intensely that sleep was impossible.

He had hoped this would be his chance to reconnect with Evelyn, but Marcus's constant presence ruined everything.

The frustration was suffocating.

Dawn arrived after a restless night. Evelyn hadn't slept well either, blinking awake as morning light filtered through the curtains.

A sharp knock interrupted the quiet.

Evelyn murmured acknowledgment, and Marcus immediately ceased knocking.

After dressing in a cream silk blouse and tailored pencil skirt, she descended the grand staircase. The faint shadows under her eyes softened her usual icy demeanor.

Nathan brightened instantly when she entered the dining room, having waited there since sunrise.

"Good morning, darling."

Evelyn nodded absently while pouring coffee. "Sleep well?"

Nathan's gaze flickered toward Marcus with clear resentment. "Not particularly."

Marcus's scarred face twisted into a deeper scowl.

Evelyn glanced between them. "Leg injuries often disrupt sleep. Nothing unusual."

Nathan choked on his orange juice.

Beatrice emerged from the kitchen balancing a tray of Evelyn's favorite breakfast items. "Ms. Sinclair, I prepared everything just how you like it." Her hands trembled slightly.

Evelyn set down her untouched fork, suddenly remembering. "Oh! I forgot to remind you about your medication yesterday."

Nathan arched an elegant brow. "And how do you plan to make amends?"

Without hesitation, Evelyn retrieved an assortment of pills from the medicine cabinet and dumped them into his palm. "Consider this yesterday's dose with interest."

Nathan swallowed them obediently, making Beatrice's eyes widen comically.

Evelyn grabbed her purse. "Off to work."

"At least eat something first," Nathan coaxed.

"My brother brought homemade pastries from Sterling Manor," she called over her shoulder.

The hit-and-run investigation remained stalled since the driver lingered in critical condition.

After a productive morning at the office, Evelyn returned to Highland Estates for an afternoon rest.

The mansion stood eerily quiet.

She awoke groggily to golden afternoon light streaming through the windows. Stretching, she headed downstairs for water and to remind Nathan about his next dose.

She wondered if the special supplements she'd mixed in had improved his condition yet.

As she ascended with her water glass, angry whispers erupted from the staff quarters below.

"That Sinclair woman refuses everything I make! Does she think I'll poison her?" Beatrice hissed.

Evelyn froze on the staircase, then deliberately settled on the steps to listen.

The daily report to Margaret was always entertaining.

"Of course she does nothing for Mr. Blackwood! We should be grateful he's not waiting on her hand and foot!"

Evelyn smirked just as Nathan's wheelchair approached silently from behind. She pressed a finger to her lips.

Nathan raised an eyebrow at finding his ex-wife eavesdropping with such enthusiasm. With an imperceptible nod, Marcus positioned the wheelchair for optimal listening.
###Chapter 400 Burning With Rage

The most unforgivable part was that Beatrice had completely forgotten to administer Mr. Blackwood's medication yesterday.

This morning, she'd forced him to take double the dosage like some careless executioner.

That woman was pure evil. She probably wanted revenge on him. "Madam, if that viper marries into this family again, she'll destroy everything!"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. The initial spark of joy in his eyes was swiftly extinguished, replaced by an icy storm. Dangerous shadows danced across his chiseled features.

His knuckles turned white where they gripped the wheelchair. Veins bulged along his forearms as he fought to control his temper.

Evelyn sat composed on the marble steps, listening to the tirade as if it were some distant gossip. A frosty smile played on her lips.

Her calmness was a blade slowly carving out his heart.

Nathan had believed bringing her back would erase the painful past. That they could create new, sweeter memories to atone for his mistakes.

Yet this was the reality.

Evelyn listened to those venomous words without flinching, as though she'd expected nothing less.

If Beatrice - someone supposedly trustworthy - spoke this way, what horrors had Evelyn endured daily during those three years here?

Nathan couldn't bear to imagine. Beatrice was Margaret's creature. Given Margaret's hatred for Evelyn, what other torments had she orchestrated?

Since last night, he'd witnessed Evelyn's emotions shift from disgust to indifference, then cold detachment, finally settling into utter disdain.

Each transformation was another twist of the knife in his chest. The pain was unbearable.

Finally, Beatrice ended her poisonous call.

Evelyn rose gracefully, blinking in confusion at Nathan's thunderous expression.

Why was he so furious? He wasn't the one being maligned. As she moved to pass him, Nathan seized her wrist, his voice rough with emotion.

"Evelyn, are you angry? Tell me how to punish her."

Would vengeance ease her pain? Could it erase three years of suffering?

The thought shamed him. Maybe it wasn't too late. Maybe she truly didn't care.

Evelyn's lips curved into that chilling smile. "Angry? This is who she's always been. Didn't you all know that?"

"You all?" The words struck like a physical blow. Even the old injury in his right leg throbbed in response.

To her, he was no different from Margaret. Just another tormentor.

Evelyn believed Nathan had never protected her. Never cared.

She'd survived alone while he considered her a burden.

Hadn't that always been the truth?

Today's revelation was merely the surface of her suffering.

When Evelyn tried to leave again, Nathan clung desperately, his eyes burning with remorse. The weight of his guilt could have drowned them both.

But Evelyn remained unmoved.

She'd learned not to play with fire.

As Nathan opened his mouth, Marcus abruptly pulled his wheelchair back, forcing him to release Evelyn's arm.

Marcus shoved the wheelchair aside and followed Evelyn without a backward glance.

Nathan sat frozen, speechless.

Upstairs, Beatrice heard the commotion and sighed in relief when she saw only Nathan.

"Mr. Blackwood, how may I serve you?"

Nathan turned slowly. The lethal sharpness in his gaze made Beatrice tremble.

"You're being transferred abroad immediately. To learn basic decency."

Beatrice gasped. "Sir, what have I done wrong? I can't leave!"

She earned thirty thousand monthly here for minimal work, plus bonuses. No other household offered such luxury.

Her thirty-year contract with the Blackwoods meant she had no choice. Their word was law.
###Chapter 401: Whose Warning Counts?

Beatrice's blood ran cold. Mr. Blackwood wanted to ship her off to the Philippines? Compared to her current workload, that would be absolute torture! Would she ever make it back? Had he overheard her phone conversation earlier?

A wave of panic surged through her entire body, making her knees tremble violently.

She knew exactly how smitten Nathan was with Evelyn these days. And Nathan always kept his promises.

With shaking hands, Beatrice dialed Margaret Blackwood, sobbing hysterically into the phone.

Within forty-five minutes, Margaret stormed into Highland Estates like a hurricane.

Coincidentally, she nearly collided with Evelyn in the foyer, who was just heading out for some shopping.

Margaret barged in, her face twisted with fury. Without hesitation, she jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "You scheming witch! You're divorced yet still clinging to my son? We offered reconciliation, but you played hard to get! Now look at you - how low will you stoop?"

Evelyn's gaze turned arctic. Just as expected - Margaret remained utterly despicable.

"Mrs. Blackwood," Evelyn said icily, "I suggest you mind your language. My patience has limits, regardless of your age."

Margaret's face purpled with rage. The audacity! The lack of respect!

She'd grown accustomed to bullying Evelyn in the past. Never had she imagined the mouse would roar back. Now she found herself powerless against Evelyn's retaliation.

What galled Margaret most was that someone like Evelyn dared defy her at all.

Beatrice rushed to Margaret's side, tears streaming. "Madam, Mr. Blackwood wants to exile me to the Philippines! You must intervene!"

Margaret scoffed, patting Beatrice's shoulder. "Don't fret, dear. No one's sending you anywhere while I'm here. You'll stay right where you belong." She shot Evelyn a venomous look. "Even if certain people find your presence... inconvenient."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Was Margaret suffering from persecution complex? Did she honestly believe Evelyn had demanded Beatrice's removal?

But Evelyn couldn't be bothered to explain. She certainly wouldn't waste another second on this bitter old crone.

Adjusting her purse strap, Evelyn turned toward the exit.

Margaret, however, wasn't finished. She blocked Evelyn's path. "Listen here, Evelyn Sinclair—"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Yes?"

"I'm warning you—stay away from my son! Do you think we're all blind to your schemes?"

Evelyn laughed coldly. "What schemes would those be?"

"You're trying to poison him! Forcing experimental drugs down his throat! I'm watching your every move!"

"Who exactly are you watching?" Nathan's voice cut through the tension like a blade. Harrison stood grim-faced behind him.

Margaret brightened instantly. "Nathaniel! This woman—"

"I warned you before." Nathan's voice could have frozen hell over. "One more incident like this, and Sophia won't see America for another decade."

Margaret paled. "I'm only protecting you!"

"Save it." Nathan's jaw clenched.

Margaret pointed a shaking finger at Evelyn. "Didn't you hear how she spoke to me? Should I kneel and kiss her feet now?"

Evelyn's laughter dripped with contempt. "Mrs. Blackwood, I've shown remarkable restraint. The days when you could walk all over me are over. Frankly, you should be grateful I haven't retaliated for past... indiscretions."

Margaret vibrated with rage. "How dare you! My son crippled his leg saving you!"

"Yes, your son saved me." Evelyn tilted her head. "But what does that have to do with you? Should I grovel before you? You certainly seem to enjoy flaunting your self-importance."

"Evelyn Sinclair, you—"

"Actually, Mrs. Blackwood..." Evelyn's gaze slid to Beatrice. "Perhaps we'll cancel the Philippines plan. There are far more... creative solutions available."

Her tone carried lethal sweetness.

Beatrice turned ghost-white.

With a final mocking smile, Evelyn strolled past them. "What a delightful way to ruin a perfectly good afternoon."
###Chapter 402 Retribution Came Swiftly

Margaret Blackwood lost all reason. "Get that woman out of here! I won't allow this relationship to continue!"

Nathan Blackwood's voice turned glacial. "My personal affairs are none of your concern."

Margaret's teeth ground together violently. "How dare you defy your own mother?"

Nathan's gaze remained impassive.

Since being sent abroad for special training at age five, Nathan would call Margaret whenever homesickness struck. Yet his mother, preoccupied with shopping sprees, would dismiss him impatiently - telling him to endure it and grow stronger.

Published by N?v''elD/rama.Org.

Margaret would then inform Old Master Blackwood about these secret calls, ensuring Nathan received brutal punishments as consequence.

"Now that I'm grown, she believes she can control me?" Nathan's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "How utterly absurd."

"If you're expelled from the Blackwood family, consider our mother-son relationship terminated."

Margaret's entire body convulsed violently, her complexion draining to ghostly white.

Never in her wildest nightmares had Margaret imagined hearing such words from her son.

Nathan schooled his features into neutrality, his brow smoothing as his gaze softened upon Evelyn Sinclair's retreating figure.

The naked longing in his eyes was impossible to miss.

Margaret felt her sanity crumbling. "My daughter's gone. My son rejects me as his mother. And now that wretched Evelyn dares look down on me? Me - the matriarch of the Blackwood dynasty!"

Tremors of rage wracked her body.

"This is all Evelyn's fault! Without her interference, everything would remain unchanged."

A single obsessive thought consumed her - Evelyn must disappear.

Margaret's wild eyes landed on the fruit knife resting in the bowl. Decision crystallized.

She seized the blade recklessly and charged forward.

Nathan jolted upright, but searing pain in his right leg immobilized him. "Evelyn! Behind you!"

Evelyn had just begun turning when Marcus yanked her sideways with lightning reflexes.

"Die, you bitch!"

Margaret's shriek pierced the air as she lunged with bloodshot eyes. Evelyn barely dodged the glinting steel.

The deranged woman swung wildly before tripping catastrophically.

The knife plunged deep into her own abdomen.

Crimson bloomed instantly across her designer blouse.

Evelyn stared, momentarily stunned, as the light rapidly faded from Margaret's eyes.

Beatrice rushed over hysterically. "Madam! Speak to me!"

Nathan's expression oscillated between shock and fury.

Marcus wordlessly opened the car door for Evelyn. "Watch your head, Miss Sinclair."

Evelyn lowered her gaze and slid inside silently.

Marcus turned back toward the chaos. "The dashcam captured Mrs. Blackwood's attempted assault. Regardless of her injuries, Miss Sinclair retains full legal rights to pursue charges."

This single statement preempted countless future complications.

Kneeling beside Margaret, Beatrice gaped at them in horror.

Margaret's grotesque expression contorted, but she lacked strength for further venom.

The engine roared to life.

Evelyn leaned back, eyes closed in the plush seat.

Marcus broke his usual silence. "Shall I arrange your return to Sterling Manor?"

Evelyn's nose wrinkled. "Not yet. Fleeing would imply guilt. They're the ones at fault here."

She wanted no part of this drama. Margaret had chosen this confrontation deliberately.

The abdominal wound wasn't fatal - just excruciating with significant blood loss.

"Serves her right," Evelyn thought without an ounce of remorse.
###Chapter 403 Seeking Professional Advice

Highland Estates

Nathan Blackwood sat motionless in his wheelchair by the grand entrance, his face ashen. His gaze followed the flurry of activity as medical personnel carefully loaded Margaret Blackwood into the waiting ambulance. The commotion around him felt muffled, distant.

Was he grieving?

Not exactly.

He was simply... stunned.

The realization that his own mother had harbored such intense hatred for Evelyn Sinclair—enough to attempt murder—left him reeling. All those years of dismissing her subtle jabs had allowed this venom to fester unchecked.

Harrison finished coordinating with the medical team and turned to find his boss still frozen in place. The usually formidable CEO of Blackwood Enterprises looked uncharacteristically vulnerable in his wheelchair, yet the dangerous aura surrounding him remained undiminished.

"Sir," Harrison approached cautiously, "the doctors confirmed it's just blood loss. No life-threatening injuries."

Nathan's fingers tightened around the wheelchair's armrests. His obsidian eyes darkened further, becoming utterly unreadable.

"Send the housekeeper to our Manila estate," he finally spoke, his voice glacial. "Permanently. As for my mother..."

A bone-chilling pause.

"Once she's stabilized, transfer her to Silver Pines Sanatorium. No discharge without my explicit authorization."

Harrison's breath caught. He understood the unspoken sentence—this was effectively a gilded prison.

Had he not received the bodyguard's report detailing Margaret's violent outburst, he might have protested. But seeing Evelyn's bloodied form being carried out earlier... No, Nathan's reaction was justified.

"Understood, sir."

After a weighted silence, Harrison ventured, "Do you think... Ms. Sinclair will return?"

Nathan's jaw clenched. That very fear had been gnawing at him since the ambulance doors closed behind Evelyn. If she walked away now, he might never get another chance.

"Perhaps you could call later? Ask about dinner preferences?" Harrison suggested. "We could have her favorite delivered."

Nathan's piercing gaze snapped up. "Since when do you give dating advice?"

Harrison risked a smile. "Sir, even CEOs need wingmen. With Ms. Sinclair's security detail, we should consider... professional reinforcements."

"Get to the point."

"My cousin Teddy—used to be a divorce lawyer, now runs a high-end matchmaking service. He's got a gift for reconciliation cases. If you're open to..."

Nathan's expression darkened visibly.

A matchmaker?

The idea of the mighty Nathan Blackwood requiring relationship counseling was laughable. The business world would have a field day with this.

Harrison paled as Nathan's glare intensified. This gamble might cost him his six-figure salary.

"Fine." Nathan's abrupt agreement startled him. "But if this backfires, you're both unemployed."

Harrison barely suppressed a gulp. Now he was staking his career on Teddy's questionable charm?

"Discreetly," Nathan added sharply. "Have him pose as my new butler. And Evelyn must never know his real profession."

As Nathan wheeled himself toward his study, Harrison stood dumbfounded.

Nathan Blackwood had actually agreed to relationship counseling.

Desperation indeed made strange bedfellows.
###Chapter 404 The Matchmaker Arrives

Nathan's fingers flew across his phone screen as he dialed Harrison's cousin without hesitation.

Less than twenty minutes later.

A rotund man weighing well over 100 kg stood before Nathan, his round face splitting into a grin so wide his eyes nearly disappeared.

Nathan's expression darkened instantly. His sharp gaze flicked between Harrison and the beaming stranger.

Cousin?

Before Harrison could explain, the man burst into enthusiastic speech, droplets of spit flying as he gestured wildly. "Mr. Blackwood, no need for formalities! Call me Teddy—Theodore Winslow, at your service!"

He clapped his hands together. "Matchmaking is my passion! One month to rekindle the spark, three months to deepen the connection, and I guarantee you'll be remarried within a year!"

Teddy spoke with such conviction that Nathan found himself momentarily stunned.

The sheer audacity of this man should have made Nathan throw him out immediately.

Yet...

Against all logic, Nathan hesitated.

Harrison shot his cousin a frantic look, silently begging him to tone it down. If Teddy oversold and failed, they'd both be unemployed.

A heavy silence settled over the study.

Nathan tapped his fingers against the mahogany desk. "You were a white-collar worker before this. Why the career change?"

Teddy's cheerful demeanor faltered. His shoulders slumped dramatically, his entire body jiggling as he stomped his foot like a petulant child.

"Because..." He pouted. "Every time I went to the company cafeteria, there was never enough food left for anyone else!"

Nathan blinked.

"My boss said I was great at my job, but my food expenses canceled out my profits!" Teddy huffed. "They just wanted an excuse to fire me!"

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose.

He exhaled sharply. "What's your success rate?"

Teddy perked up instantly. "You and Ms. Sinclair are my first clients!" He beamed. "But I’ll give it my all!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. His icy glare shifted to Harrison.

"I'm a test subject?"

Harrison wished the floor would swallow him whole.

Teddy, oblivious, clapped his hands. "So, when do I start?"

Nathan's voice was glacial. "One-day probation."

He should have thrown Teddy out right then.

But the man cheered as if he'd won the lottery. "Perfect! I'll start cooking dinner!"

Harrison barely escaped the room before Nathan's murderous stare could incinerate him.

Alone in his study, Nathan dragged a hand down his face. "I've lost my mind."

The scent of roasted herbs and spices soon filled the mansion.

Teddy knocked on the study door, grinning like a fool. "Mr. Blackwood, call Ms. Sinclair! Invite her for dinner!"

Nathan's phone lay untouched on the desk.

His fingers twitched.

How could he even begin to explain this absurd situation to Evelyn?

Teddy winked. "Don’t worry—I’ll handle it!"

Before Nathan could protest, Teddy whipped out his phone.

Beep. Beep.

The call connected.
###Chapter 405 The Uninvited Guest

The phone rang twice before a crisp female voice answered. "Who is this?"

"Ms. Sinclair? This is Teddy, the new butler at Highland Estates." His voice was sheepish. "I accidentally knocked over your skincare collection while cleaning your room. Mr. Blackwood insisted I discard everything and replace it, but... I can't read half the labels."

Evelyn's icy tone sliced through his rambling. "Don't you dare throw them out! I'm coming home right now. If a single bottle is missing, you're fired!"

In the study, Nathan's brow furrowed. He heard every word through the door.

That easy?

Evelyn wasn't just wealthy—she was particular. Her skincare regimen was custom-formulated for her complexion, each set costing more than most people's annual salaries. Where exactly did they plan to find replacements?

Idiots.

Her earlier resolve to never return to Highland Estates evaporated. Right now, all that mattered was salvaging her precious collection.

She grabbed her purse and stormed out with Marcus in tow.

At the estate's entrance, Evelyn hesitated.

The marble floor where Margaret had collapsed in a pool of blood hours earlier now gleamed spotlessly. As if the entire confrontation had never happened.

She wasn't about to reopen that wound. Nathan had saved her too many times to count. Pushing the matter further would only strain relations with the Blackwoods.

The door swung open before she could knock. A rotund man with flushed cheeks barreled out, panting.

"Ms. Sinclair!" His beady eyes crinkled with delight. "I'm Teddy! My word, you're even more stunning in person—like a goddess descended from Olympus! No magazine cover could do you justice—"

Evelyn froze. Years of etiquette training hadn't prepared her for this onslaught of unsolicited praise.

Behind her, Marcus cleared his throat pointedly.

"Oh! You must be the legendary bodyguard!" Teddy gushed, turning his admiration elsewhere. "That aura! Those shoulders! I heard you've won three national championships—absolute perfection!"

Marcus looked ready to strangle him.

Evelyn burst out laughing. "Where on earth did Nathan find you? You're... one of a kind."

She strode inside before Teddy could shower her with more compliments.

Nathan sat in the living room reviewing documents, his usual mask of calm indifference in place. At the sound of footsteps, his lashes lifted slightly. The ghost of a smile touched his lips.

"You're back."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. How could he act so nonchalant?

Before she could speak, Nathan continued smoothly, "The maid has been permanently dismissed. As for my mother..." His jaw tightened. "The doctors suspect underlying mental health issues. Once she's stabilized, she'll be transferred to a private facility. This won't happen again."

His voice was low, threaded with an apology he couldn't voice outright.

Margaret was still his mother. Blood ties bound him in ways ethics couldn't sever. The best he could offer was ensuring their paths never crossed again.

Silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken words.

Finally, Evelyn gave a soft, humorless laugh. "How pragmatic of you, Mr. Blackwood. Aren't you going to scold me for provoking her?"

Nathan's smile turned self-deprecating. "You only spoke the truth."

There was nothing to forgive.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her shoulders relaxing. "Then let's consider the matter closed."

Nathan's head snapped up, disbelief flickering in his eyes. He hadn't expected her to concede so easily.

Behind them, Teddy clapped his hands in delight. "This calls for celebration! I've just prepared a divine low-calorie stew—would you care for a bowl?"

His exuberance shattered the tension like a hammer through glass.
###Chapter 406 The Ultimate Flatterer

Harrison's cousin, Teddy, was determined not to miss this golden opportunity to bring these two together.

Nathan stared at Teddy with an unreadable expression, completely speechless.

Marcus rolled his eyes dramatically, refusing to even glance in Teddy's direction.

Evelyn's lips twitched with amusement. "Mr. Blackwood, I see you've... adjusted your hiring standards?"

Nathan's inner circle consisted of nothing but the best in their respective fields.

Teddy, with his round physique, didn't seem to fit Nathan's usual preferences. By all accounts, he should've been eliminated during the first round of interviews.

Miracles do happen.

Nathan pressed his lips together, searching for an explanation, but Teddy beat him to it with a beaming smile.

"Ms. Sinclair, I got in through connections!"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Whose?"

Teddy leaned in conspiratorially. "I'm Harrison's cousin. But shhh—don't tell anyone. The gossip would be unbearable!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "Your secret's safe with me."

So he's Harrison's relative? I never realized Nathan valued his assistant so highly... Interesting.

As Evelyn turned to leave, she suddenly remembered why she'd returned.

"My belongings—"

"All safely returned to their proper places! You'll find everything exactly as you left it."

Evelyn exhaled in relief, her expression softening noticeably.

Nathan observed her from the dining table, a faint smile tugging at his lips.

So she's not completely indifferent after all. At least she cared enough about those cosmetics to come back for them.

Evelyn caught his gaze and narrowed her eyes. "What's so funny?"

Despite his portly appearance, Teddy moved with surprising agility.

Within minutes, he'd arranged an assortment of light, flavorful dishes before Evelyn—each beautifully presented and perfectly balanced.

Evelyn sampled each dish and finished her soup with appreciation.

Nathan's eyes warmed as he watched her eat, his own appetite improving significantly.

Teddy swelled with pride. All those grueling culinary courses and nearly bankrupting his mentor's restaurant through "quality testing" had finally paid off.

As the two ate in comfortable silence, Teddy launched into his flattery campaign.

"Mr. Blackwood is truly remarkable. Working through illness shows incredible dedication—a quality we should all aspire to emulate. Don't you agree, Ms. Sinclair?"

Evelyn, caught off guard, glanced up at Nathan across the table. "Absolutely."

Nathan, who'd been enjoying his meal, nearly choked. His expression darkened immediately. I was about to make his position permanent for his cooking skills, but this idiot is testing my patience!

"Men like Mr. Blackwood are rare these days. Most crumble under pressure, but not our Mr. Blackwood! He leads by example—a true paragon of masculinity!"

A violent coughing fit erupted from the kitchen—Marcus apparently drowning on water.

Teddy rushed to his aid. "Marcus! Are you alright?"

"No."

"Here, have some water!"

Teddy thrust a glass at him, but Marcus waved it away fearfully.

At the table, Evelyn smirked at Nathan. "Paragon of masculinity, hmm? Quite the title."

Nathan closed his eyes, radiating mortification and icy displeasure.

Evelyn stood with an amused smile, heading upstairs while thinking, This chubby charmer is something else. What an outrageous brown-noser.

"Ms. Sinclair, wait! I haven't finished! If you're looking for a man, you should—"

"Enough!" Nathan finally snapped.
###Chapter 407 Ms. Blackwood

Evelyn Sinclair lounged on the second-floor balcony, the golden hues of sunset painting her face as she sipped from a delicate porcelain teacup.

The warmth made her eyelids heavy. Just as she began to drift, the faintest creak of footsteps reached her ears.

Her brow furrowed. Teddy?

"Ms. Sterling, you're absolutely brilliant! You knew it was me without even turning around." His voice was honeyed with admiration. "Your composure is remarkable—so unlike other women. I've brought you some fresh fruit. Was dinner to your liking tonight?"

Teddy fidgeted, his fingers twisting together. "Mr. Blackwood personally selected the menu. I... I wasn't sure if it would suit your tastes. This is my first day, you see. I'd hate to lose this position over something as trivial as dinner. Especially with my culinary credentials—"

Evelyn's smile froze at the edges.

Nathan had chosen those dishes? She had assumed it was mere coincidence that every course matched her preferences. How would he even know?

A strange tightness coiled in her chest.

The more effort Nathan poured into these gestures, the more it unsettled her.

She exhaled, smoothing her expression. "I'm not particular about food. Prepare whatever you wish."

After all, Evelyn rarely ate much here. If the meals became unbearable, she could always retreat to Sterling Manor.

Teddy opened his mouth to press further, but Evelyn set down her cup with a decisive clink.

"I nearly forgot—I'm meeting friends for shopping tonight. Leave the door unlocked for my return."

"Shopping? Allow me to carry your bags!" Teddy's eyes lit up. Gaining her trust would make his... other duties far simpler.

Evelyn forced a polite smile. "That won't be necessary. Marcus is accompanying me."

——

Inside the glittering mall, Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont lounged in massage chairs, waiting.

Evelyn arched a brow at their relaxed poses. "Evening shopping sprees? Has your schedule become this packed?"

Natalie rolled her eyes. "We're saving you from wallowing in that mausoleum of yours. Who knows what might happen if you're alone with Nathan Blackwood day and night?"

Isabella nodded vigorously. "Speaking of, I heard that witch Margaret was hospitalized?"

Evelyn settled beside them, lips quirking. "Your intelligence network impresses me."

Marcus maintained a discreet distance, close enough to intervene if needed but far enough to grant privacy.

The women dragged Evelyn through designer boutiques, arms laden with shopping bags.

"Of course I know," Isabella huffed. "My uncle runs that hospital. They wheeled her in covered in blood, and she woke up cursing your name. Strangest part? Not a single Blackwood visited her." She studied Evelyn. "Did you have a hand in that?"

Evelyn's laugh was ice. "She earned it. That blade was meant for me. Marcus took it instead."

A weighted silence fell.

Isabella linked arms with her abruptly. "Enough gloom. Tell me—has Nathan tried anything since you moved in to 'nurse' him?"

"He's wheelchair-bound. What exactly could he do?"

"Good." Isabella squeezed her arm. "We may not approve of reconciliation, but we acknowledge his... efforts this time."

Evelyn lowered her gaze, smiling faintly. Suddenly, Natalie gasped, yanking her sleeve.

"Look who's here!"

They turned to see a uniformed woman kneeling on the polished floor, scrubbing vigorously. All three froze.
###Chapter 408 A Wave of Puffery Before Bed

The trio blinked in disbelief.

Had they really just seen who they thought they saw?

Isabella was the first to break the stunned silence. "Sophia Blackwood has been missing for months, and she's been right here under our noses this whole time? How did no one recognize her?"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, equally surprised.

Though Sophia's forced smile and stiff posture as she knelt to help a customer with their shoes were painfully obvious, she did look healthier than before.

It was just... jarring.

No one could have predicted that the once-arrogant heiress would end up working as a retail clerk.

How could Nathan Blackwood allow his sister to stoop to this?

Natalie whispered, "Should we go say something?"

Evelyn shook her head, but Isabella was already dragging them forward.

"Absolutely."

Sophia finished with her customer and immediately bowed to greet the new arrivals.

When she looked up and recognized them, her face twisted with fury.

"What are you doing here? Get out!"

Ah. Some things never changed.

Isabella smirked. "We're shopping, obviously. The real question is—what are you doing here, Ms. Blackwood?"

Sophia's face flushed with rage, but when her gaze landed on Evelyn, she visibly swallowed her temper. Nathan's warnings clearly still held weight.

"None of your business. Either buy something or leave."

Evelyn tilted her head, amusement dancing in her eyes.

"Did your brother banish you here to learn humility?"

Sophia's hands clenched into fists. "This is your fault! How dare you even—"

"Me?" Evelyn laughed lightly. "You earned this all on your own. Don't blame me for your consequences."

The store manager, sensing wealthy customers, hurried over with a practiced smile.

"Sophia, are these friends of yours? Do you need assistance?"

Before Sophia could respond, Isabella pointed at several displays. "That one, that one, and those over there—wrap them all up."

Sophia's jaw tightened as she glared at Evelyn.

She didn’t move.

The manager nudged her sharply. "Hurry up! You’ve only sold one pair this month. Do you want to keep your job?"

Sophia gritted her teeth. "I’ll be right with you."

Evelyn waved a hand. "No need for fittings. We’ll take everything she picked. I’d rather not stay another minute."

Sophia eyed her suspiciously.

The manager beamed. "Oh! You must be here to support her! How kind—"

Evelyn cut her off with a laugh. "We’re not her friends. But by all means, give her the commission. Good luck hitting your quota."

Sophia’s face darkened as the manager eagerly rushed to process the sale.

Isabella pouted. "Why let her off so easy? After everything she’s done?"

Evelyn shrugged. "I’m done wasting energy on the Blackwoods. As long as she stays out of my way, she can hate me quietly."

Besides, seeing the proud Sophia reduced to servitude was satisfaction enough.

The trio continued shopping, leaving with armfuls of bags before parting ways at nightfall.

Outside the mall, Evelyn handed her purchases to Marcus.

Back at Highland Estates, the lights were still on.

The moment Evelyn stepped inside, the rich scent of chocolate filled the air.

Teddy bounded out of the kitchen, spoon in hand.

"Ms. Sinclair! You’ve been busy! Next time, take me with you—I have excellent taste!"
###Chapter 409 Sleeping in the Same Room

Evelyn inhaled deeply, catching the rich aroma wafting through the air. "What's that delightful smell?" she asked.

"I prepared hot chocolate using Amedeis 70% dark chocolate. The texture is absolutely divine. You must try it!" Theodore beamed with pride, his round cheeks flushing pink with excitement.

He immediately began pouring the steaming liquid into delicate porcelain cups. "Would you care for some?"

The irresistible scent made Evelyn nod eagerly. "Is Mr. Blackwood resting?"

"Mr. Blackwood is currently in his study attending a video conference." Theodore sighed dramatically while adjusting his bowtie. "A man of his stature - wealthy, powerful, yet still so dedicated - is truly one in a million!"

Marcus stood rigidly by the doorway, his muscular frame casting a long shadow across the marble floor.

"Theodore, would Marcus like some too?" Evelyn suggested after taking her first sip, savoring the velvety smoothness. "This is exceptional."

Marcus turned his chiseled profile away, his expression unreadable. "No thank you. He can keep it."

Undeterred, Theodore waddled over with surprising speed for his size and practically shoved the reluctant bodyguard toward the table. The effort left the plump butler panting, tiny beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

"Now now, no need for formalities! I've already indulged while preparing it." Theodore punctuated his statement with an exaggerated burp that made Evelyn stifle a laugh.

After finishing her drink, Evelyn rose gracefully. "Don't let this go to waste. I'm retiring for the evening. You both should get some rest as well."

Theodore waved enthusiastically, his multiple chins wobbling. "Such a refined, compassionate lady like Ms. Sinclair is a rare treasure indeed!"

Evelyn quickened her pace upstairs before Theodore could continue his effusive praise.

Turning to Marcus, Theodore opened his mouth to deliver another compliment, but the bodyguard downed the chocolate in one gulp and stalked off without a word, his scowl deepening.

Theodore examined the empty cup with admiration. "Even the way you drink hot chocolate exudes such masculine energy, Marcus!"

If Theodore hadn't been Nathan Blackwood's personal butler, Marcus would have tossed the irritating man out the nearest window.

Passing the study, Evelyn paused briefly when she heard Nathan's voice flowing in perfect French, the rich baritone sending an unexpected shiver down her spine. The melodic rhythm of the foreign language suited him surprisingly well.

What a captivating sound.

Choosing not to disturb him, Evelyn continued to her room. Before bed, she video-called Alexander, William, and Lucas.

Meanwhile, Marcus unrolled his military-grade sleeping bag outside Evelyn's door with practiced efficiency. Just as he settled in, a loud thump announced Theodore's arrival as he dramatically spread out his pink floral bedding right beside him.

The contrast between Marcus's utilitarian setup and Theodore's frilly ensemble was almost comical. When Theodore lay down, his considerable girth completely blocked Marcus's view of the hallway.

Marcus glared daggers at the intruder. "What exactly are you doing here?"

"Keeping watch over Ms. Sinclair, of course." Theodore adjusted his sleeping mask with a self-satisfied smile. "You're still a man, after all. Can't be too careful about these things. Ms. Sinclair wouldn't stand a chance against someone of your... physical attributes."

He patted Marcus's shoulder reassuringly. "Don't fret, I don't snore or grind my teeth."

With that, Theodore turned away and promptly fell asleep.

Marcus clenched his jaw, watching in disbelief as Theodore began emitting soft snores within seconds. The urge to kick the rotund nuisance down the stairs was overwhelming, but the logistics of moving 100kg of dead weight deterred him.

Thus, two very different men found themselves keeping vigil outside Evelyn's door.

Ten minutes later, Theodore's gentle snores escalated into thunderous rumbles that jolted Marcus fully awake. The rhythmic vibrations continued at a volume that would put a chainsaw to shame.
###Chapter 410 Bathe Him

Nathan's expression darkened instantly.

His knuckles turned white as he struggled to contain his rising temper.

Evelyn couldn't take the noise anymore and swung the door open, only to find two men sprawled across her doorway. She blinked in disbelief.

"Teddy?"

Marcus's jaw was clenched so tight it looked painful. "Miss Sinclair, you should go back inside and rest."

Evelyn let out a quiet laugh and shook her head.

"I can't sleep with all this racket."

It was so loud that Lucas had texted asking if she was hosting a midnight concert.

The walls were practically vibrating!

Marcus finally snapped and kicked Teddy's leg.

Teddy jolted awake, eyes wide with alarm before immediately putting on his most earnest expression.

"Ms. Sinclair! You're still awake? Don't worry—I won't let any harm come to you. As long as Marcus stays out here, so will I!"

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose.

She gave Marcus a pleading look.

"Just go sleep in the guest room. I'll be fine."

Marcus opened his mouth to argue but knew better than to disobey.

Here he was—a former special forces operative—being outmaneuvered by this human golden retriever.

Grumbling under his breath, Marcus gathered his bedding and stalked off. Teddy scrambled after him, suddenly wide awake.

"Wait up! Let's share a room! I promise I won't snore or sleepwalk this time!"

Evelyn exhaled in relief as the hallway finally fell silent.

Then the study door creaked open.

Nathan wheeled out, looking exhausted. His usually sharp features were softened by fatigue.

"You're back," he murmured, voice rough.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Problem?"

"Aren't you supposed to be taking care of me? Shouldn't you ask how I'm feeling today?"

His tone was quieter than usual, lacking its usual edge. Almost... vulnerable.

Something twisted in Evelyn's chest despite herself. She kept her expression neutral.

"Mr. Blackwood, how are you feeling today?"

Nathan's lips quirked. "Better now that you're here."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. She'd long since grown immune to Nathan's smooth talk.

The moment he recovered, she was leaving and never looking back.

"I'm going to bed. Goodnight."

"Wait." Nathan caught her wrist. "I need help bathing."

Evelyn froze. "Excuse me?"

Had she heard that correctly? He wanted her to—

Nathan sighed, the picture of helplessness. "The doctor said my right leg can't get wet. It's... difficult to manage alone. Unless you want my injury to worsen and keep you here indefinitely?"

Damn him for sounding so reasonable. The innocent look on his face made Evelyn feel like she was overreacting.

"Fine. I'll change and meet you there. You can undress yourself—your hands work perfectly fine, don't they?"

Nathan's eyes lit up like a kid on Christmas morning.

"I'll be waiting."

That deep, velvety voice sent an unwelcome shiver down her spine.

As Evelyn retreated to her room, she remembered Teddy's earlier advice to Nathan: "Mr. Blackwood, a man's greatest assets are his wealth and sex appeal. Since Ms. Sinclair has plenty of money..."

Apparently, Nathan had taken those words to heart.

Shaking her head, Evelyn fired off a quick text to Marcus before heading to what promised to be the most awkward bath time of her life.
###Chapter 411 The Unexpected Bath Attendant

Nathan Blackwood maneuvered his wheelchair toward the marble-clad bathroom.

Since his leg injury, he'd taken to wearing loose-fitting pajama bottoms for easier mobility. His fingers hovered over the waistband before deciding against removing them entirely.

Better not push his luck too far.

If Evelyn Sinclair got spooked by his forwardness, she might bolt from Highland Estates altogether.

Nathan examined his bare torso in the full-length mirror with approval. His sculpted chest tapered into defined abdominal muscles that flexed subtly with each breath. The usual icy demeanor softened into something more approachable.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow's advice echoed in his mind.

"Mr. Blackwood, with a physique like yours, no woman could resist. During the bath, let Ms. Sinclair admire the view without distraction. If she gets flustered, that's your cue to proceed."

Nathan remained skeptical but willing to experiment.

The bedroom door creaked open moments later.

He schooled his features into practiced nonchalance, running fingers through his dark hair to create artful disarray.

Footsteps paused outside the bathroom.

Three sharp raps on the door.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Nathan's pulse quickened despite himself.

"Evelyn? I'm in here. Come straight in."

He inhaled deeply, forcing his expression into calm indifference while keeping his eyes shut. Don't screw this up.

Teddy's words returned. Just relax and let her enjoy the show.

Water splashed against porcelain as someone adjusted the faucet.

Gentle hands draped a towel over his injured leg to protect it from moisture. The care in each movement suggested Evelyn's presence.

Nathan kept his eyes closed but his breathing grew uneven.

A warm, damp cloth glided across his shoulder blades.

Every muscle in his body tensed involuntarily.

The towel traced the contours of his arms with featherlight precision.

Nathan clenched his jaw, the only sounds being running water and his own thundering heartbeat.

The charged silence stretched between them, broken only by synchronized breathing and water droplets.

Something felt... off.

Why wasn't she speaking? Where were the expected nervous giggles or awkward small talk?

Teddy had assured him: "Ms. Sinclair will babble nervously when confronted with your naked torso. Just give monosyllabic responses to keep her off-balance."

But this silence... Was she overwhelmed? Aroused? Or-

The towel disappeared abruptly, leaving his skin pebbled with goosebumps.

A gruff male voice spoke behind him, holding up two shower gel options. "Ocean Breeze or Sandalwood?"

Nathan's spine went rigid. His eyes flew open to meet Marcus's stoic reflection in the mirror. The bodyguard stood with sleeves rolled up, revealing corded forearms.

Every fantasy of seduction evaporated. Nathan's injured leg trapped him in this nightmare.

"Why. Are. You. Here." Nathan ground out between clenched teeth.

All that tension. That anticipation. For his wife's bodyguard?!

"Where's Evelyn?"
###Chapter 412 Let's Try That Massage Again

Marcus's muscular shoulders flexed as he draped another towel over Nathan. His massage techniques were shockingly professional!

If Marcus hadn't spoken, Nathan would never have guessed it was Evelyn's personal bodyguard giving him this intimate treatment.

Nathan's jaw clenched in irritation. The thought of another man's hands on his bare skin made his stomach churn with discomfort.

Marcus remained expressionless as he explained, "Ms. Sinclair specifically instructed me to bathe and massage you."

Though Marcus felt awkward performing such personal services, the household only had two other male staff. The elderly butler Archibald was snoring too loudly to be disturbed, even when Marcus kicked his chair.

Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. His chest rose and fell rapidly as he gripped the wheelchair handles until his knuckles turned white.

Marcus hesitated before reaching for the body wash. The mint scent seemed more appropriate than the strawberry-flavored alternative for this situation.

Just as Marcus pumped the gel onto his palms, Nathan's voice cut through the steamy bathroom like a blade.

"Get out!" Nathan ground out between clenched teeth.

Even the chill of the bathroom couldn't cool the fire of humiliation burning through him at Marcus's touch.

Marcus blinked in confusion. "But Mr. Blackwood, you seemed to be enjoying it earlier?"

He held up the bottle uncertainly. "Ms. Sinclair's orders..."

Nathan's glacial stare could have frozen lava. "Do I need to repeat myself?"

Marcus set down the toiletries with a shrug. If the man wanted to refuse help, so be it.

The moment the door clicked shut, Nathan exhaled sharply. Three agonizing minutes passed before he regained composure. Where was that meddling butler when needed?

Wrapping himself in a plush robe, Nathan wheeled into the bedroom - and froze.

Evelyn stood by the doorway, exchanging a nod with Marcus before entering. Water droplets glistened on Nathan's exposed collarbones, trailing down his sculpted chest.

Evelyn's lips curved as her gaze traveled over him. "Satisfied with Marcus's service, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan's entire body tensed. He needed another shower immediately.

His voice dripped with barely contained fury. "Care to explain this, Evelyn?"

This wasn't at all what he'd envisioned when she offered to care for him.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with mischief. "While I'm here to assist you," she emphasized, "we are divorced. Certain boundaries must be maintained."

The word "divorced" struck Nathan like a physical blow. The light in his eyes dimmed instantly.

Watching her smirk, Nathan tasted bitter defeat. This crushing helplessness was unfamiliar territory.

Evelyn continued mercilessly, "Unless you want rumors spreading? How would we ever remarry others then?"
###Chapter 413 Fickle Hearts

Evelyn Sinclair had perfected the art of striking where it hurt most—especially when it came to Nathan Blackwood. The satisfaction was intoxicating.

Her fingers lingered on the doorknob as she flashed him a deliberately indifferent smile.

"Goodnight, Mr. Blackwood."

She didn't wait for his reply.

The message couldn't be clearer. If he chose to play dumb, she had plenty of other ways to shatter his illusions.

His tactics were so painfully outdated.

Nathan's stormy gaze followed her retreating figure.

Each word had pierced like shards of glass. The pain was excruciating, yet he couldn't blame anyone but himself. He deserved every ounce of this agony.

The Preston Sinclair project specifications had been finalized—an ambitious endeavor expanding their AI research. Kingsley Tech's involvement became essential after their groundbreaking medical AI announcement catapulted them to global acclaim.

Though Sterling Corporation and Blackwood Enterprises dominated the AI market, complacency wasn't an option. Competitors lurked at every corner, ready to pounce on any weakness.

Evelyn's proposal to accelerate development by sharing resources with Kingsley Tech made strategic sense. She'd discussed it with Alexander Sterling at dawn, receiving his immediate approval.

Wider distribution meant fewer enemies.

The inevitable involvement of Blackwood Enterprises? Merely an advantageous bonus given their formidable resources.

Morning mist clung to Highland Estates as Evelyn selected a fitted black dress adorned with pearl accents—professional yet striking, mirroring her razor-sharp confidence.

"Divine!" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow gasped as she descended the staircase. "You're absolutely radiant this morning! The sunlight makes you look like a masterpiece come to life!"

Evelyn nearly missed a step, gripping the banister. Marcus stood rigid nearby, his scowl telegraphing disdain for Teddy's theatrics.

Nathan sat at the breakfast table in black lounge wear, every inch the composed aristocrat. Last night's tension might as well have never happened.

"Good morning," he said warmly, watching her approach.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Morning."

How predictably mercurial men could be.

Teddy had outdone himself with breakfast—an extravagant spread spanning three continents. Everything smelled divine.

Since Nathan wasn't addressing last night's awkwardness, neither would she. Let him stew in his discomfort.

She sampled each dish with genuine appreciation before a thought struck her.

"Incidentally, I ran into Sophia Blackwood while shopping last night."

Nathan's expression remained unreadable. "I know. The boutique manager informed me."

His calm response begged the question—how had his mother appeared there so conveniently?
###Chapter 414 She Only Cares About Appearances

Nathan Blackwood ate his sushi with deliberate slowness. His long fingers moved with refined precision, each motion carrying an understated elegance.

His voice held a chilling detachment.

"I'm simply showing her the fastest way to learn humility."

Evelyn Sinclair frowned, not comprehending his meaning.

Nathan elaborated patiently. "She used to look down on everyone. Never imagined she'd be serving others one day. This is character building."

Evelyn's eyebrows arched in sudden understanding.

Though for Sophia Blackwood, this punishment seemed excessively harsh.

Unlike ordinary people struggling to make ends meet, Sophia had been coddled since birth.

Evelyn sighed inwardly. If Nathan could be this ruthless to his own sister, she shouldn't trust his occasional displays of vulnerability.

Then again, spoiled brats like Sophia were a dime a dozen. The Blackwood fortune could support her indefinitely - Nathan was only doing this because of Evelyn.

Finishing her meal quickly, Evelyn headed to the office.

Only Nathan and Teddy Winslow remained at Highland Estates.

Teddy's eyes sparkled as he asked excitedly, "Mr. Blackwood, how did last night go?"

At the mention, Nathan lost his appetite entirely.

His gaze turned glacial as he glared at Teddy. With a cold snort, he wheeled himself back to the study.

Sterling Corporation.

Evelyn instructed Bennett to contact Preston Sinclair to confirm Kingsley Tech's involvement before coordinating with Dominic Kingsley for follow-up arrangements.

To avoid running into Nathan at Highland Estates, Evelyn decided to handle this personally.

The three parties agreed to finalize details at Kingsley Tech. Preston wanted to better understand their new partner, so he took the opportunity to tour their R&D department.

For the afternoon meeting, Evelyn arrived early with her new project assistant, Benjamin Carter.

Benjamin was a fresh graduate still doing his internship, chosen over more experienced candidates precisely because he had no connections. His clear, ambitious eyes showed no trace of greed.

Most importantly, Benjamin would treasure this opportunity - a fast track compared to climbing the corporate ladder step by step.

Thus, he was perfect for this project.

Dominic Kingsley prepared a temporary office. Upon arrival, Evelyn and Benjamin met with Preston's team.

The meeting was scheduled for 3:00 PM.

Noticing Benjamin behind her, Dominic raised an eyebrow. "Bennett didn't come?"

He'd assumed Evelyn wouldn't trust such an important project to anyone else, especially a newcomer.

Evelyn replied smoothly, "He's handling other matters. This is my new assistant, Benjamin Carter."

Dominic nodded. "Mr. Blackwood still holds shares in Kingsley Tech, so a representative from Blackwood Enterprises will attend."

Exactly as Evelyn expected. She nodded calmly.

After all, Nathan was recuperating at home - no chance he'd show up.

A knock interrupted them. Preston Sinclair stood at the door.

"Ms. Sterling, Mr. Kingsley. Am I interrupting?"

Evelyn smiled. "Welcome-"

Her greeting froze mid-sentence when she saw the bouquet of white chrysanthemums in Preston's hands.

Dominic looked equally startled.

Preston carried himself with aristocratic poise and mysterious elegance. The funeral flowers looked grotesquely out of place.

What fresh hell is this? Evelyn thought. First the father, now the son bringing me mourning flowers. Do they want me dead?
###Chapter 415 His Sense of Crisis

Evelyn Sinclair bit back her words, maintaining a polite smile.

Preston Sinclair noticed the subtle shift in her expression and offered a charming smile in return.

"Oliver asked me to give this to you," Preston said, his tone light. "He insisted you'd love it, though I have my doubts."

With a careless flick of his wrist, Preston tossed the bouquet of white chrysanthemums onto the edge of the table before extending his hand toward Dominic Kingsley.

What was I thinking, trusting that boy’s taste? Preston mentally scolded himself. Since when does Evelyn like white chrysanthemums?

Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief. Oh. So it was Oliver.

A pang of nostalgia hit her. It had been too long since she’d seen the boy.

Regaining her composure, Evelyn exchanged pleasantries with the others. Dominic took a brief phone call, murmuring a few words before hanging up.

"Let’s move to the conference room," Dominic announced. "Everyone’s waiting."

When Evelyn stepped inside, her breath caught.

Nathan Blackwood was here—in person.

Even seated in a wheelchair, his presence was commanding. The air around him crackled with authority, his sharp gaze sweeping over the room effortlessly.

Evelyn said nothing about his unexpected attendance. The meeting proceeded without a hitch.

This project was originally a collaboration between Sterling Corporation and Preston Sinclair. Though Kingsley Tech was involved, Dominic wouldn’t receive direct dividends. Still, the indirect benefits were substantial.

The meeting wrapped up swiftly.

Preston lingered afterward, wanting to discuss something privately with Evelyn. The two excused themselves to her office.

In the conference room, Nathan watched Evelyn’s retreating figure, his eyes narrowing slightly.

Dominic smirked. "Feeling threatened?"

Nathan shot him a glare. "Where’s the new assistant?"

Preston didn’t worry him—the man was still mourning his late wife and had returned to Montecito purely for business.

But that fresh-faced graduate hovering around Evelyn? That was a problem.

Earlier, when Dominic had called about the meeting, Theodore "Teddy" Winslow had warned him before he left: "Don’t give that kid an inch! Young, charming, knows how to sweet-talk—exactly the type women fall for. You need to put him in his place!"

Dominic leaned against the table, hands in his pockets, amusement dancing in his eyes.

"Mr. Blackwood," he teased, "I never took you for the jealous type."

With a lazy wave, Dominic summoned Benjamin Carter into the room.

Benjamin had assumed Evelyn needed him. Instead, he found himself facing two of the most intimidating men in Montecito.

The atmosphere was icy.

A recent graduate with little experience, Benjamin approached cautiously, clasping his hands in front of him and dipping into a respectful bow.

"Mr. Blackwood, Mr. Kingsley," he said nervously. "How can I assist you?"

Since he was assigned to this project, he had no choice but to comply with their requests.

Nathan sat motionless, his expression unreadable. Yet the weight of his gaze was suffocating, pressing down on Benjamin without a single word.

After a long silence, Nathan finally spoke.

"Your name?"

"Benjamin Carter, sir."

Nathan gave a faint hum, then lapsed back into silence.

The tension thickened.

Benjamin’s youthful face betrayed his confusion. Why am I here?

Minutes dragged by before Nathan spoke again.

"New to the workforce?" His voice was low, deliberate. "Bennett didn’t accompany Ms. Sterling today."

Benjamin nodded quickly. "Yes, sir. Bennett’s handling another project. I just joined last month."

His nerves made him overly compliant, answering every question without hesitation.

Nathan studied him for several seconds before his lips curled downward in disapproval.

"This project is critical," Nathan said coolly. "Don’t disappoint Ms. Sterling. You’re dismissed."

The dismissal carried the weight of a royal decree.

"Yes, sir."

Benjamin practically fled the room, his heart pounding. What was that about?

Dominic tapped his fingers against the table, grinning.

"That’s it?"
###Chapter 416: Such Menial Tasks

Dominic Kingsley thought he was about to witness an entertaining spectacle.

Nathan Blackwood shot him a frosty glare.

Evelyn Sinclair had standards—she wouldn’t spare a glance for insignificant underlings like that.

If Benjamin Carter had possessed even an ounce of composure and self-assurance, Nathan wouldn’t have let him off so easily.

Honestly, considering someone like him as competition was an insult to Evelyn.

Evelyn and Preston Sinclair had a seamless discussion, their perspectives aligning effortlessly on nearly every topic.

Nearly half an hour later, they finally stepped out of the office.

Since Preston still had work waiting at the hotel, Evelyn walked him out.

"Oliver hasn’t been around lately. Did the car accident scare him?" she asked.

Preston smiled politely. "He’s survived a bombing before—a little accident wouldn’t faze him. I’ve just assigned him several tutors. His schedule is packed with homework now."

Evelyn immediately understood.

"Poor kid. Childhood shouldn’t be this suffocating."

"If you want to see him, you’re welcome to visit the hotel anytime. He misses you," Preston added.

Evelyn nodded. "Perfect."

They stood in front of the elevator, waiting. Before the doors opened, Nathan’s voice cut through the silence behind them.

"Going home?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

He’s still here?

Preston offered a polite nod in greeting, which Nathan returned with equal formality.

Nathan’s gaze, however, remained fixed on Evelyn, his lips curling into a sly smirk.

"You’re free after this meeting, aren’t you? Let’s head back together."

His words carried a deliberate ambiguity.

Go home together? Evelyn stiffened slightly before glancing at her watch. Office hours were technically over.

"I still have—" she began reflexively.

"Teddy dropped me off and already left. You wouldn’t make me go back alone, would you?"

Nathan’s tone was light, but there was an unmistakable persistence beneath it.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Infuriating man.

The elevator arrived just then.

Preston lingered behind them like the perfect gentleman. Nathan made no move to wheel himself inside, instead tilting his head up at Evelyn with an expression that was equal parts innocent and pitiful.

Does he expect me to push his wheelchair in front of Preston? Or worse—have Preston do it?

The thought was absurd.

Both men carried themselves with too much pride. The balance would shatter the moment one yielded.

Evelyn couldn’t picture Preston pushing Nathan’s wheelchair, so with a quiet sigh, she stepped forward and guided Nathan inside, positioning herself behind him.

Nathan looked thoroughly pleased, his smile softening.

Two seconds passed. Preston still hadn’t entered.

He offered another polite nod. "I just remembered—I left that bouquet of white chrysanthemums behind. It wouldn’t do to leave them there. We’ll be in touch."

Nathan gave a slight, detached nod in return before pressing the elevator’s close button.

Evelyn barely suppressed a groan.

Silence settled between them as the elevator descended.

Evelyn pulled out her phone, quickly typing a message to Benjamin with a few reminders.

Marcus was waiting for her downstairs. The moment the elevator doors opened, he strode forward.

Evelyn stepped out—only for Nathan’s voice to stop her.

"Evelyn."

She’d nearly forgotten he was there.

He was waiting for her to push him out.

Evelyn paused, frowning. Just as she turned back, Marcus smoothly intervened.

"Miss Sinclair, allow me to handle such menial tasks."

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

Evelyn nodded approvingly and continued walking.

Marcus took over, pushing Nathan’s wheelchair at a brisk pace to keep up with her.

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose, grinding his teeth.

If I’d known this would happen, I wouldn’t have dismissed Teddy so soon.

At Highland Estates, Evelyn headed straight to her room to organize her notes from the meeting, leaving Nathan with Marcus.

The house was immaculate as always. Teddy, clad in a frilly pink apron, rushed over the moment they entered.

"How do you manage to look so radiant even after a long day? I made you a nourishing vegetarian soup—low-calorie and delicious!"

His ingratiating smile left Evelyn utterly speechless.
###Chapter 417 The Relentless Warrior

Evelyn Sinclair offered a polite smile. "Thank you, but I'll be heading upstairs first."

"Of course, Ms. Sinclair!"

She was midway up the grand staircase when Marcus opened the double doors. A quick glance over her shoulder revealed Nathan Blackwood entering the foyer.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow practically vibrated with excitement as he greeted Nathan, his burgundy silk apron fluttering with each enthusiastic movement. "Mr. Blackwood! A man of your stature who works tirelessly yet maintains such impeccable charm is truly—"

"—the perfect match for Ms. Sinclair!" Teddy continued without pausing for breath. "Honestly, I'm at a loss for words to describe how perfectly suited you two are!"

Marcus had been following Evelyn upstairs but froze at Teddy's declaration. The bodyguard turned slowly, his scarred face twisting in contemplation.

"I believe there's only one appropriate description," Marcus rumbled.

Teddy's eyes sparkled with delight. This marked the first time Marcus had voluntarily continued a conversation—a promising development in their budding camaraderie. "Do tell!"

"A relentless warrior," Marcus stated with complete sincerity.

Evelyn's lips twitched with suppressed amusement.

Nathan's already stormy expression darkened further.

Marcus, utterly unaware of any offense, simply strode past to resume his position behind Evelyn.

Teddy stood paralyzed, suddenly aware of the icy atmosphere thickening around Nathan. He mentally kicked himself for seeking validation from the socially oblivious bodyguard. What a catastrophic miscalculation!

Nathan's piercing gaze traveled up the staircase, causing Evelyn to quickly school her features. "I became this warrior because of her!" Nathan muttered under his breath. "And she dares to laugh? Heartless woman!"

Clearing her throat, Evelyn offered, "Mr. Blackwood is an exceptional leader overseeing thousands of employees. Naturally, he can't afford to be careless."

Their eyes met. Nathan's stern expression softened momentarily before curling into a smile, the storm in his eyes replaced by warmth. "Evelyn, your perception is as sharp as ever."

Nathan felt like he'd been dipped in liquid sunshine—every inch of him glowing with the sweetness of her rare praise. So this was how she truly saw him?

Evelyn exhaled quietly. Remarkable how easily placated this powerful man could be with just a few empty words.

Teddy observed the exchange with fascination. I've been saying similar compliments for months! Why does it only matter when it comes from Ms. Sinclair? Is this the infamous power of love?

Marcus, interpreting Evelyn's words as criticism of his earlier remark, approached Nathan with solemn determination. "Mr. Blackwood, would you like assistance bathing?"

The mansion fell deathly silent.

Teddy's eye developed a nervous twitch as he alternated between Marcus's earnest face and Nathan's glacial expression. Suddenly, last night's events became crystal clear. My carefully cultivated peace has been destroyed!

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Nathan's apoplectic expression and wisely retreated to her room without comment.

Moments later, her phone rang. Preston Sinclair's calm voice came through. "Evelyn, I'd like you to accompany me to a private networking event. I've uncovered a lead regarding your car accident—the person responsible will be in attendance tonight."

"Absolutely," Evelyn agreed without hesitation. "I'll leave immediately."

Having arrived at Highland Estates without formal attire, Evelyn selected an emerald green gown from the dressing room that accentuated her striking features.

As she exited her chambers, Nathan coincidentally emerged from his study. His breath caught at the vision before him—Evelyn transformed into an ethereal beauty that made his pulse race.
###Chapter 418 Preferred Ladies

Evelyn Sinclair regarded Nathan Blackwood with cool detachment. "Preston mentioned he uncovered a lead about the vehicle identification. I'm meeting him at the gala tonight."

Nathan's expression darkened instantly, his lips pressing into a thin line. "Be cautious then."

With a curt nod, Evelyn descended the staircase.

Marcus followed closely behind.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow scrambled after them. "Wait! Ms. Sterling, let me accompany you! I'll be your shadow protector!"

Evelyn hesitated, not wanting to wound his pride.

Marcus rolled his eyes. "Ms. Sterling is perfectly safe with me."

"But I can provide covert protection!" Teddy insisted. "While you're the obvious bodyguard, I'll blend into the background. Double the security!"

He turned hopeful eyes toward Nathan. "Come on, boss! Back me up here!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Fine. Take him. If things go south, his survival isn't your priority."

Teddy's mouth fell open.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Whatever."

Upon arrival at the gala venue, Marcus exited first to open her door. The moment Evelyn stepped out, she spotted Preston Sinclair waiting at the entrance.

Preston stood like aristocratic royalty, his presence both commanding and enigmatic.

He approached with measured steps. "No outsiders present," he assured her quietly, implying no security threats.

Evelyn's shoulders relaxed slightly.

They entered together, Marcus maintaining a respectful distance.

Teddy sidled up, whispering, "Who's this VIP?"

"No idea," Marcus muttered, clearly uninterested.

Undeterred, Teddy pressed, "Is he courting Ms. Sterling? You should stay closer! That man looks like trouble."

Indeed, Preston's striking features and regal bearing rivaled Nathan's. Teddy sensed immediate danger.

Marcus ignored him completely.

Teddy huffed in frustration. "Guess I'm on my own then," he muttered, squaring his shoulders as he followed them inside.

The gala buzzed with elegant energy. A live orchestra played as couples twirled across the dance floor. Business conversations hummed beneath the music.

"Apparently Mr. Sinclair only partners with female CEOs now..."

"Don't waste your time. He chose Sterling Corporation over Blackwood Enterprises—that tells you everything."

"Wait...are they involved?"

"Hush! Do you want to get blacklisted?"

Evelyn caught the whispers but dismissed them with an amused smile. The truth behind their collaboration would remain their secret.

Preston caught her questioning glance and silenced the gossips with one icy stare.

Offering his arm like a perfect gentleman, Preston waited. Evelyn placed her hand lightly in the crook of his elbow, sharing an imperceptible smile.

Their seamless coordination only fueled more speculation.

Soon, three familiar figures approached with champagne flutes—the same executives from Preston's private dinner weeks prior.

Sebastian Montgomery of Montgomery Holdings. Gregory Thornton of Thornton & Co. Nathaniel Whitmore from P&K Corporation.

With contracts already signed, formalities melted away.

Sebastian puffed his cigar, eyeing Evelyn with playful intrigue. "Had I known you preferred female partners, Mr. Sinclair, I'd have brought my sister to that dinner."

Preston didn't miss a beat. "Then it's fortunate you didn't."

Sebastian choked on his champagne.
###Chapter 419 The Stepmother Dilemma

The remaining two men couldn't help but chuckle. Nathaniel Whitmore gave Sebastian Montgomery's shoulder a friendly pat. "If you don't mind that this would be my third marriage, maybe you could introduce me to your sister?"

Sebastian rolled his eyes so hard it looked painful. His jaw clenched. "Hilarious."

Gregory Thornton laughed from the sidelines, raising his champagne flute. "Regardless, Sterling Worldwide truly deserves this contract. Congratulations."

Evelyn Sinclair arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow and lifted her own glass in response. "Thank you, Mr. Thornton."

Gregory's gaze flickered with something unreadable. "I heard Mr. Blackwood was injured. Nothing serious, I hope? We had golf plans last week, but his assistant canceled last minute. I meant to visit, but work has been..." He waved a hand vaguely.

"I wouldn't know," Evelyn replied smoothly.

The truth about her caring for Nathan was known only to the Sterling family. The last thing she needed was gossip spreading through Montecito's elite circles like wildfire.

Gregory chuckled, the sound oddly sharp. "Ah, right. How silly of me to ask. You wouldn't know about Mr. Blackwood's condition now that you're... what's the term? Estranged?"

Evelyn's smile froze. Her eyes turned arctic as they swept over Gregory's smug face.

Though he played it off as casual conversation, the barb was deliberate - calculated for maximum impact in this very public setting.

Gregory's gaze darted between Evelyn and Preston with exaggerated surprise. "Wait... Mr. Sinclair, don't tell me you're unaware of Ms. Sterling's history with Mr. Blackwood?"

The other two businessmen exchanged uncomfortable glances. The sudden shift in conversation was as awkward as it was inappropriate.

If there was something between Evelyn and Preston, bringing up her ex-husband now could only cause tension.

Preston's voice was deceptively light when he spoke. "Mr. Thornton, while I appreciate your... concern, Evelyn's past relationships are hardly relevant to our current discussion." His phone chose that moment to chime. With an apologetic nod, he stepped away. "If you'll excuse me."

Left alone with the three men, Evelyn maintained her polished smile as if nothing were amiss.

"So, Ms. Sterling," Gregory pressed, leaning in slightly. "You and Mr. Sinclair go way back?"

Evelyn arched a brow. His interest was bordering on obsessive. "Wouldn't you like to know."

Gregory's smile stiffened. Evelyn turned on her heel, scanning the room for an escape.

Suddenly, Theodore "Teddy" Winslow materialized beside her, dressed like a nouveau riche caricature - complete with a rose tucked haphazardly into his suit pocket. "Ms. Sterling! I've done my research—"

Evelyn nearly choked on her champagne. For a wild moment, she considered pretending not to know him.

But Teddy, blissfully unaware of social cues, plopped down beside her. "About Preston Sinclair," he continued in a stage whisper. "He's Montecito-born but spent years overseas expanding his empire. And get this—no serious relationships despite being one of the most eligible bachelors in—"

Evelyn cut him off. "Your point being?"

Teddy leaned closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur. "A man that powerful, that attractive, with zero romantic entanglements? I'm ninety percent certain he's batting for the other team."

Evelyn massaged her temples. "He has a son, Teddy."

"Ah!" Teddy waggled his fingers. "But have you seen the boy? No resemblance whatsoever. Even if Preston isn't gay, I'd wager that child isn't his." He sighed dramatically, propping his round face in his hands. "Meanwhile, our Mr. Blackwood? Spotless reputation. No scandalous love children. Completely devoted to you. The man's practically a saint in comparison..."
###Chapter 420: A Deadly Game

Evelyn Sinclair lifted her champagne flute, taking a deliberate sip. The last person she wanted to engage with was Teddy Winslow.

She wished she could vanish into the crowd, pretending not to recognize him.

Teddy, however, had other plans. His one-sided conversation with Evelyn quickly drew curious glances from nearby guests. Gregory Thornton, undeterred, sauntered over with his own drink, eyeing Teddy with suspicion.

Who is this man? Evelyn had no intention of introducing him.

Teddy, ever bold, rose to his feet and scrutinized Gregory. There was something unsettling in Gregory’s gaze—a mix of resentment and something darker.

Teddy’s lips curled into a smirk. His eyes narrowed as he extended a hand.

"Goodness, it’s been ages!"

Gregory hesitated. The man seemed familiar, but he couldn’t place him.

He forced a stiff smile. "Indeed. I see you and Ms. Sinclair are quite engrossed. Am I interrupting?"

"Not at all!"

Teddy waved a hand, exuding effortless charm. To an outsider, he appeared perfectly at ease, as if he belonged among the elite.

Gregory’s smile turned sly.

"Ms. Sinclair, you truly are magnetic. Men flock to you wherever you go."

Teddy cut in sharply, his tone laced with sarcasm.

"Please, let’s not delude ourselves. A woman like Ms. Sinclair deserves someone of Nathaniel Blackwood’s caliber. Not someone like you."

Gregory’s smirk faltered.

Did he just call me old?

"Which company do you represent?" Gregory asked, feigning polite interest.

His eyes, however, gleamed with danger. One wrong answer, and he could ruin whoever Teddy worked for.

Teddy grinned. "Wouldn’t you like to know?"

The air thickened with tension.

Evelyn considered intervening, but her gaze caught Preston Sinclair’s from across the room.

Preston ended his call and strode toward them, his expression grim. He grasped Evelyn’s wrist, leaning in to whisper.

"He’s awake. The doctors want us there immediately."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Without a word, she followed Preston out.

No one noticed Gregory’s face darken at Preston’s words.

Teddy hesitated, then hurried after them—but he was too slow.

Evelyn and Preston were already gone, their car disappearing into the night. Marcus followed in another vehicle, leaving Teddy standing alone.

Inside the car, Evelyn’s fingers clenched. "Is he really conscious?"

Preston let out a low chuckle. The glint of his watch mirrored the cold city lights.

"No. That man won’t be waking up."

Evelyn froze. "So this is a setup?"

Preston’s earlier words clicked into place. "One of those three is behind this?"

He gave her an approving nod. "Exactly."

Her stomach dropped.

She had assumed it was one of her enemies, but she’d never crossed paths with Gregory, Sebastian Montgomery, or Nathaniel Whitmore before.

Unless…

Her eyes met Preston’s.

His voice was ice. "You guessed right. It’s about the project."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, forcing herself to stay calm.

"How did you uncover this?"

Preston’s gaze was frigid. "I have people watching them. They slipped up."

Her pulse raced. "So it is Gregory?"

Theodore was brash but honest. Nathaniel was cunning but careful. Only Gregory had shown open hostility.

The realization made her skin crawl.

Preston’s lips curved. "We’ll know soon enough."
###Chapter 421 Future Father-In-Law

Preston Sinclair pressed his lips into a thin line. His dark eyes gleamed with an icy intensity.

The car pulled up to the hospital, but neither of them moved to exit.

Instead, Marcus slipped inside. Within minutes, his call came through. "Ms. Sinclair, I've got him."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. A desperate voice crackled through the phone—a stranger begging for mercy.

Preston snatched the device from her. "Did Gregory Thornton send you?" His tone was razor-sharp.

The suspicion had crossed Preston's mind too. "No! No, it wasn't Mr. Thornton!" The man's shrill denial only confirmed their suspicions.

That slip—Mr. Thornton—betrayed everything. Without hesitation, Preston dialed another number.

"Bring Gregory Thornton in. Don't let him escape."

A pause. Then, "Mr. Blackwood got to him first."

Preston's brows lifted. "Interesting." He ended the call and turned to Evelyn. "Seems Nathan was two steps ahead."

Evelyn frowned. She'd been with Nathan these past few days, yet he'd never mentioned investigating—let alone uncovering the mastermind so swiftly.

Then again, Nathan Blackwood was never one to sit idle.

After suffering such a blow, did anyone expect him to wait? He'd likely been digging from the start.

"Want to go see?" Preston offered.

Evelyn shook her head. "Send me home." She had no interest in small fry.

She was waiting for the real predator to surface.

Preston nodded, instructing the driver before stepping out.

With the mastermind caught, the danger had passed—yet unease still coiled in Evelyn's chest.

Business was about profit. The strong took more. But assassination? Car crashes? Hitmen?

These people played dirty.

Soon, Highland Estates came into view. Theodore "Teddy" Winslow greeted her at the door, beaming. "Ms. Sinclair! I made you passionfruit iced tea—refreshing and healthy!"

Evelyn wasn't in the mood. She waved him off—then paused. "When did you get back?"

Teddy grinned. "Mr. Blackwood had urgent business, so he sent me to keep you company. Thoughtful, isn't he?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Had Nathan gone after Gregory himself? She didn’t voice the thought.

Teddy pressed the tea into her hands. "Oh! Chairman Sterling's birthday is coming up. Mr. Blackwood’s been agonizing over the perfect gift. Says your father is his greatest inspiration."

Evelyn’s frown deepened.

"Why is he stressing over my dad’s birthday?"

Teddy leaned in conspiratorially. "He wants to impress him. It’s a big deal!"

Evelyn smirked. "Tell him not to bother. My father already knows he’s respected."

"But if the gift isn’t meaningful—"

"My father has three hobbies," Evelyn cut in. "Fishing, counting money, and yelling at people."

Teddy nearly tripped on the stairs. As Evelyn walked away, his mind raced.

How did one cater to that?

Turn into a fish? Absurd.

Stack cash in a briefcase? Tacky.

Volunteer as a verbal punching bag?

Impossible.
###Chapter 422 Can't Let Your Guard Down

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow sat slumped on the plush sofa in Highland Estates' grand living room, nursing his wounded heart over Nathan's indifference when the front door creaked open.

Nathan Blackwood wheeled himself in, his usually sharp features softened by the dim lighting. Teddy sprang up like an overeager puppy.

"Mr. Blackwood! You're back already? Shouldn't you be resting after your injury? Your dedication is truly inspiring—no wonder you're the most successful man in New York!"

Nathan had just finished dealing with Gregory Thornton, putting him in an unusually good mood—until Teddy's sycophantic greeting soured his expression.

The blatant flattery was almost impressive in its absurdity. Nathan clenched his jaw, his voice dropping to a dangerous timbre. "Is Evelyn home?"

"Yes, sir. Though...Ms. Sinclair seems rather upset tonight. Maybe you should—"

Nathan's glacial glare cut through Teddy's words like a knife. The assistant visibly gulped, hastily adding, "That gala tonight was spectacular! Like something out of a Hollywood premiere. Though it lacked your commanding presence, of course."

Nathan ignored the babbling, maneuvering his wheelchair toward the study. What kind of idiot had he hired? If not for Teddy's unique skill set, he'd have fired him months ago.

Teddy scurried after him, grabbing the wheelchair handles. "But sir, you really should be concerned! Preston Sinclair was practically orbiting Ms. Sinclair all evening. The way he looks at her—it's not just gratitude anymore. You can't afford to be complacent!"

At the gala, Teddy had witnessed firsthand the reverence everyone showed Preston Sinclair. The Wall Street titan carried himself with the same formidable aura as Nathan, yet he'd been uncharacteristically gentle with Evelyn, attending to her every need. How could Nathan ignore that?

Rubbing his temples, Nathan snapped, "Just do your damn job." He dismissed Teddy's concerns. Preston's kindness stemmed from Evelyn saving his son during that terrorist attack in Paris years ago. Nathan was certain the man harbored no ulterior motives.

As for romantic feelings? Preston's wife had died in that same attack. No man moved on from that in just a few years.

Nathan paused outside Evelyn's bedroom door, knocking softly. After a prolonged silence, the door swung open.

Evelyn stood framed in the doorway, her face obscured by a clay mask, arms crossed defiantly. "What energy you have, Mr. Blackwood. Capturing Gregory Thornton and still having breath to bother me."

Nathan's gaze softened as he looked up at her. "I have news I think you'll appreciate."

"Let me guess—you found the murderer? Gregory Thornton?" Her flat tone held no surprise.

Nathan's eyebrows lifted appreciatively. "You already knew. Of course you did." His lips quirked. "Shall I hand him over to the police immediately?"

Evelyn's mask cracked slightly as she frowned. "Too merciful. I assume you're dismantling his empire first? Making him watch everything he built crumble before tossing him in a cell?"

"Would you like to participate?" Nathan watched her closely.

Evelyn hesitated. "You've handled everything already. No point dirtying my hands."

A chill seemed to radiate from Nathan as he studied her. Remembering Teddy's warning, he decided to voice his thoughts. "You're extraordinary, Evelyn. Brilliant, beautiful...and far too kind for your own good."

Any other woman might have melted at such praise. Evelyn merely rolled her eyes beneath her mask. "Exactly why I'm too good for you. What nonsense are you spouting at this hour?"

Nathan's shoulders slumped slightly as he retreated to his room, the weight of unrequited affection pressing down on him.

###Chapter 423 More Handsome and Richer

The morning sun had barely risen when Evelyn Sinclair's phone buzzed with an incoming call from Lucas Sterling.

Newton & Co's bankruptcy had struck like lightning.

Could this be connected to Nathan Blackwood? Evelyn knew Alexander would find out eventually, but she hadn't expected him to catch wind of it so soon—especially while he was overseas. She steadied her voice as she explained that Gregory Thornton had orchestrated the car accident.

A heavy silence stretched between them for a full minute before Alexander's tone turned glacial.

"Keep Marcus by your side at all times. Don't let your guard down." His words were clipped, commanding. "Stay out of the rest. Just wait for me to return."

Evelyn agreed, exchanging a few more words before ending the call.

She threw herself into work, arriving at Kingsley Tech before dawn. Benjamin Carter, still green in his role, struggled with complex decisions, his inexperience glaringly obvious.

Evelyn spent the entire day guiding him, her patience unwavering. Before she knew it, the sky outside had transformed into a breathtaking canvas of crimson and gold as the sun dipped below the horizon.

Stretching her stiff muscles, she finally decided to call it a day. The moment she stepped out of her office, her gaze landed on the imposing figure seated in a wheelchair, his presence commanding the room.

Even seated, Nathan Blackwood exuded an aura of icy detachment, his sharp features unyielding. Dominic Kingsley, lounging beside him on the sofa, spotted Evelyn and exhaled dramatically.

"Ms. Sinclair! Finally off work?" His relief was palpable as he loosened his tie.

Nathan had insisted on waiting for Evelyn, and in the meantime, he'd combed through every project and account with ruthless precision. His scrutiny had uncovered flaws even their auditors had missed.

Dominic was on the verge of losing his mind.

The moment Nathan's eyes met Evelyn's, his expression softened, warmth replacing the frost in his gaze.

"Perfect timing," he murmured, a faint smile playing on his lips. "There's a new French restaurant nearby. Join me?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why should I?"

Nathan's face fell, his wounded expression making her look like the villain.

"Didn't you promise to take care of me?" His voice was laced with accusation, drawing incredulous stares from those around them.

Evelyn couldn't bear the weight of their judgment.

With a sigh, she pushed his wheelchair forward, tossing her bag to Marcus. "Fine. Let's go."

A flicker of guilt nagged at her.

Marcus seamlessly took over the wheelchair at some point, a move Nathan noticed—and resented—but said nothing.

Just as they reached the car, a small figure barreled toward them.

"Pretty Lady!"

Evelyn turned just in time to see Oliver Sinclair sprinting toward her, his curls bouncing with each step.

He latched onto her legs, his voice a sweet, pleading whine. "I missed you so much!"

Her heart melted instantly.

Kneeling, she wrapped her arms around his plump little body. "Oliver, I missed you too. Your daddy told me you've been studying hard. Such a good boy!"

Oliver had been sulking for days, furious at his father for assigning a strict tutor to oversee his homework.

But now, hearing Evelyn's praise, his resentment evaporated.

"Pretty Lady thinks I'm good!" He beamed, nuzzling into her embrace.

"Yes! And when I grow up, I'll be even handsomer and richer than Daddy!" His eyes sparkled with determination. "Then no one can stop me from being with you!"

Nathan scoffed, shooting his son a withering glare.

"Enough," he said flatly. "We're leaving."

Oliver's grip on Evelyn tightened. "Where are you going? I wanna come too!"
###Chapter 424 A Small Surprise

Evelyn gently ruffled Oliver Sinclair's hair. She couldn't resist this adorable boy - he had completely stolen her heart.

"Alright then." Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened instantly. His voice turned icy. "Does Preston Sinclair even know you sneaked out alone?"

Oliver shrank into Evelyn's embrace, guilt written all over his cherubic face.

"This grumpy old man! Even when he's sick, he's still so annoying!" Nathan smirked triumphantly as he pulled out his phone to call Preston.

"Your son sneaked out and is currently with me and Evelyn." Nathan's tone clearly implied he wanted Preston to come collect his troublesome child immediately.

Nathan deliberately put the call on speakerphone so Oliver could hear Preston's response. The Wall Street tycoon's voice came through cold and indifferent. "Is that so? Then please take good care of him for me. I'm in an important meeting. We'll talk later." Click - the line went dead.

All three froze momentarily. Oliver was the first to recover, wrapping his tiny arms around Evelyn's neck in a joyful hug. "Yay! I get to stay with my Muse!" Nathan's face flushed with frustration as he stared at his now-dark phone screen, feeling his blood pressure rise.

"After finally getting this date with Evelyn, now I have to babysit Preston Sinclair's kid? Unbelievable!" The group of four - including Marcus - headed to the exclusive restaurant where Theodore "Teddy" Winslow had made reservations weeks in advance.

The ambiance was perfection - intimate lighting casting romantic shadows, designed to kindle passion. Teddy had even prepared conversation starters for Nathan.

They were supposed to reminisce about shared memories and dream about future possibilities together.

The entire floor had been reserved for privacy. Soothing classical music filled the air while twinkling lights created an illusion of dining among the stars - a breathtakingly romantic setting.

Everything would have been perfect... if not for their tiny third wheel. Marcus sat discreetly at a nearby table while Oliver clung to Evelyn's hand, stubbornly planting himself between the two adults.

The boy eyed the elaborate floral centerpiece and candle arrangement with visible disapproval. Nathan reached forward with a carefully prepared bouquet of rare blue orchids imported from Bali - nearly impossible to obtain.

His gaze softened as he tried to ignore their unwelcome companion. "These are for you," he murmured in that deep, mesmerizing voice.

"Mr. Grumpy actually brought a gift?" Before Evelyn could accept, Oliver suddenly stood up with a dramatic huff. "Muse only likes big white roses! But thanks anyway, Mr. Blackwood."

Nathan's jaw tightened as he withdrew the flowers, shooting daggers at the smug child. Oliver's satisfaction only grew as his eyes crinkled into happy crescents.

Fumbling in his pocket, the boy declared, "Muse, I didn't have time to buy flowers, but I grabbed these shiny rocks from Daddy's safe for you!"

With great ceremony, he emptied his chubby palm onto the table. Evelyn gasped. Oliver had brought a handful of uncut diamonds - each one large enough to be staggeringly valuable!

Even in the dim lighting, the stones refracted dazzling rainbows across the starry ceiling. They seemed to glow with an ethereal inner light.

Oliver rubbed his hands together excitedly, beaming up at Evelyn. "I've got tons more! Do you like them? All girls love sparkly things, right?"
###Chapter 425 Can't Be Too Petty

Nathan's fingers clenched around the edge of the table, his chest rising and falling in barely restrained frustration.

Every meticulously planned gesture—ruined by a child's careless handful of diamonds?! How could Preston Sinclair raise such an outrageously spoiled son?! Evelyn's lips parted in stunned silence.

These weren't just any gems—they were flawless, rare stones that belonged in a vault, not tossed around like candy by little Oliver Sinclair. She exhaled sharply, torn between amusement and disbelief.

"You should put these back where they belong. I can't accept them." Oliver wriggled in protest, his tiny fingers clutching Evelyn's wrist.

"Pretty Lady, don't you like them?" His lower lip jutted out. "I have even shinier ones at home!"

Evelyn bit back a laugh. How did one explain the concept of priceless jewels to a five-year-old? With a resigned sigh, she tucked them into her clutch.

"I do like them," she admitted, ruffling his hair. "But next time, ask your dad before giving away treasures, okay?" She'd return them to Preston later. Oliver beamed, triumphant.

"Nanny said diamonds make ladies happy!" He grinned up at Nathan. "Right, Mean Mister? Boys shouldn't be stingy!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. Was this brat mocking him? He'd bought an entire restaurant for Evelyn—planned to name it after her—and now he was being called cheap?!

Oliver preened under Nathan's glare. Mean Mister was still a villain, injured or not. No one stole his Pretty Lady!

The dinner, once romantic, now felt like a battlefield. Even the carefully rehearsed lines Nathan's assistant Teddy had prepared were useless against this tiny, diamond-wielding saboteur.

When their food arrived, Evelyn happily cut Oliver's steak, their laughter grating on Nathan's nerves. After ten unbearable minutes, he finally snapped.

"Evelyn." His voice was tight. "I'm upset."

Honesty was key, Teddy had insisted. But Evelyn merely blinked before smiling.

"That's a shame. Oliver and I are having a lovely time, though."

Nathan's heart cracked audibly.

Oliver giggled into his juice.

Later, as they dropped Oliver at The Grandeur, Preston was waiting in the lobby. He chuckled at his sleeping son before lifting him gently.

"Apologies for the trouble, Ms. Sinclair."

"None at all. He's delightful." Evelyn smiled.

Nathan, still fuming in the car, thought, Delightful? That demon child ruined everything!

Preston's gaze flickered to Evelyn's clutch. "Ah. I see he shared his treasures."

Evelyn quickly produced the diamonds. "He doesn't understand their value. Please take them back."

Preston waved her off. "If I return them, he'll disown me." With a nod to Nathan, he added, "Goodnight, Mr. Blackwood. Ms. Sinclair."

Nathan ignored him.

As Preston walked away, Evelyn stared at the glittering stones in her palm.

So this was where Oliver learned his absurd generosity.
###Chapter 426 Stay With Me

Evelyn Sinclair felt uneasy accepting a fortune in diamonds without reason. As she settled into the backseat of the car with Nathan Blackwood, Marcus and the driver took their places in the front.

Nathan closed his eyes, his entire demeanor radiating icy tension. He remained silent, his jaw clenched. Evelyn suddenly recalled how he had specifically asked for her opinion on the restaurant's dishes, yet she had failed to give any feedback.

She cleared her throat softly. "The chef at that place is exceptional. The ingredients were top-tier. What did you think?"

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly.

His expression softened just a fraction. "Good. I'm glad you enjoyed it."

Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief. She couldn't just accept such an extravagant gift and leave him in a foul mood. She caught Marcus's eye in the rearview mirror.

"Marcus, what did you think of the food?"

"Mr. Blackwood!" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow greeted them cheerfully as they arrived at Highland Estates. "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood, you're back! I was worried dinner might disrupt your rest, so I prepared some floral tea to aid digestion."

He moved to take Evelyn's shoes while enthusiastically recommending his homemade blend. The three male doctors waiting in the living room stiffened under Nathan's cold, unreadable gaze. Evelyn offered them a reassuring smile.

"Alright. Let me change first. I'll be down shortly." She turned to the doctors, her voice gentle. "You can go ahead upstairs to set up for the examination."

"Marcus, accompany Mr. Blackwood."

Marcus nodded and stepped forward, but Nathan stopped him with a sharp look.

His eyes locked onto Evelyn. "I want you."

Evelyn barely resisted the urge to roll her eyes.

He never misses a chance to order me around.

Teddy hurried to her side. "Ms. Sinclair, you really should go with Mr. Blackwood. Otherwise—"

Marcus shrugged. "The food was mediocre. Pretty presentation, but not filling."

Evelyn nearly choked. Nathan shot Marcus a glare that could freeze hell over.

"Then have Teddy make you something," Nathan said coldly.

Marcus's lips thinned. "That won't be necessary."

He'd rather starve than endure Teddy's endless chatter.

Back at Highland Estates, the doctors had been waiting for some time. Teddy had kept them entertained with lively conversation and mobile games, so engrossed they hadn't noticed the car pulling up. Marcus opened the door while Evelyn wheeled Nathan inside.

The four in the living room immediately pocketed their phones and stood at attention.

"You should go with Mr. Blackwood," Teddy insisted. "Otherwise, he might be too embarrassed to discuss his condition with the doctors."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Then why isn't he embarrassed to tell me?"

She didn't bother arguing further. It wouldn't take long anyway.

She pushed Nathan into the elevator, the three doctors scrambling after them. For Nathan's convenience, they had outfitted a home consultation room with state-of-the-art medical equipment. They helped him onto the examination bed.

Nathan still couldn't move his legs. It had only been a month since the accident—full mobility would take several more months to return.

The lead doctor instructed the others to prepare the instruments while Nathan removed his shirt, revealing his sculpted torso. The doctor carefully checked his heart and lung function before cutting open his pants to examine his right leg's recovery.

During the examination, Evelyn instinctively turned away.

Nathan seized her wrist.

"Stay," he commanded, his voice low.

A beat later, Evelyn turned her back to him but didn't pull away. "Fine. Let go."

The doctors exchanged glances but stayed silent. Nathan showed no intention of releasing her, his gaze piercing the lead doctor.

"Continue."

The doctor hesitated. "We could lower the curtains..."

The room had been designed with adjustable gauze curtains to filter sunlight at different angles. They could easily block Evelyn's view of Nathan.

The doctor didn't expect Nathan to glare at him like he'd suggested treason.

Evelyn spoke quickly. "Yes, lower them now."

Marcus—
###Chapter 427 Held the Wrong Person

The attending physician was conducting the examination when Nathan had to release Evelyn's hand momentarily.

Less than sixty seconds passed before Nathan grew restless at her absence.

"Evelyn, take my hand," Nathan's voice came out weak and pleading. The medical staff exchanged glances—Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Sinclair seemed unusually close.

Who would have guessed the formidable CEO could be this clingy?

A hand reached toward him. Nathan caught sight of it from the corner of his eye and immediately seized the wrist.

His pulse raced, but relief washed over him. He didn't dare stroke her fingers, afraid of provoking her temper. Since she hadn't pulled away, the earlier sting of rejection quietly faded.

The examination lasted ten agonizing minutes, during which Nathan's heart hammered violently. Just as it concluded, he heard Theodore's voice drifting in from the hallway.

"Ms. Sinclair, are you certain you only want one small tea? Allow me to bring you another—"

The voice grew nearer.

"No, thank you. I've had enough." The reply was soft, almost distant.

A heavy silence fell over the room.

If Evelyn's voice came from beyond the door... then whose hand was this?!

The doctors instinctively looked at Nathan, still lying on the examination table. His tightly shut eyes flew open, dark with icy fury.

The hand in his grasp twitched.

Nathan's entire body went rigid.

He recoiled as if burned, releasing his grip with startling speed. His tone turned arctic.

"Who the hell is this?!"

The curtain was yanked aside, revealing Marcus's scowling face—stiff with forced patience, his expression a mix of irritation and wounded pride.

He held himself back, jaw clenched. "Mr. Blackwood, you grabbed me first. For Ms. Sinclair's sake, I endured it."

Being her bodyguard was clearly no easy job.

Under the stunned gazes of the medical team, Marcus turned on his heel and strode out, his muscular frame radiating quiet intimidation.

At that moment, Evelyn walked in, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Finished with the checkup?"

Nathan glared at her, his face flushing crimson with rage. The staff sensed the sudden drop in temperature and hastily excused themselves, fleeing the room.

Evelyn approached and sat beside him. Noticing his flushed cheeks, she frowned and pressed a hand to his forehead.

"No fever. Are you feeling unwell?"

Nathan gritted his teeth, his bloodshot eyes locked onto hers.

First the bath incident. Now this. Both times with Marcus.

Frustration burned in his chest, but he couldn't lash out—not when he'd been the one trying to take advantage.

"My heart is unwell," he ground out.

Evelyn withdrew her hand, her lips curving into an amused smirk. "Mr. Blackwood, did you just cling to Marcus's hand like a lovestruck schoolboy?"

Nathan's face darkened further.

Evelyn chuckled. "Relax. Your secret's safe with me." She reached for his silk pajamas and draped them over him.

"My father's birthday is coming up. I'll be returning home for a few days. You don't mind, do you?"

Nathan stared at her in silence, his tongue pressed hard against his cheek as he fought to suppress the storm of emotions.

"...No."

Evelyn nodded, satisfied. She turned and summoned Theodore to help Nathan freshen up.

She knew he wouldn't protest—not when the mere sight of Marcus would undoubtedly sour his mood further.

"Theodore!" she called.

The cheerful assistant bounded in, beaming. "What an honor to attend to Mr. Blackwood! Oh my—wow, sir! Your physique is absolutely—"

Nathan's expression turned stony. A single warning glance silenced him mid-sentence.

Quick to redirect, Theodore cleared his throat. "So, Mr. Blackwood! That candlelit dinner with Ms. Sinclair must have been incredibly romantic, yes? Did she weep from joy?"

Nathan shut his eyes tightly.

Deep breaths. Just endure this idiot a little longer.
###Chapter 428 Meeting the Future Father-In-Law

Nathan Blackwood had given Theodore Winslow an impossible task before retiring for the night. He demanded immediate improvement in his strained relationship with Evelyn Sinclair.

Teddy burned the midnight oil, finally devising what he considered a brilliant strategy. The timing couldn't be more perfect - William Sterling's birthday celebration was just around the corner.

Evelyn hadn't brought many belongings when she temporarily moved into Highland Estates, so her departure was light and effortless. She practically skipped to the door, waving cheerfully at Nathan.

"Finally! Freedom!" Evelyn twirled in delight, imagining weeks without Nathan's constant presence. Nathan watched her go with deceptive calmness, his expression shifting to icy intensity the moment the door closed behind her.

"Everything prepared?" Nathan's voice cut through the silence. Teddy straightened his tie with confidence. "Absolutely, sir. Win over Mr. Sterling, and you'll be dining with the Sterlings regularly before you know it."

Nathan's lips twitched almost imperceptibly, the closest he ever came to smiling. Teddy continued his enthusiastic pitch. "A man of your caliber? Distinguished lineage, impeccable manners, business acumen - you're practically royalty! Mr. Sterling would be a fool not to-"

"Enough." Nathan's sharp command silenced Teddy instantly. The assistant scurried off to make final preparations. William Sterling had chosen an intimate yet opulent celebration - a sunset cruise aboard his private yacht in San Francisco Bay.

Only close family, friends, and select business associates received invitations. Alexander and Lucas Sterling were busy welcoming guests when Donovan Sterling made his rare public appearance. True to her word, Evelyn had extended an invitation to Emily Whitaker, who arrived practically vibrating with excitement.

William and Donovan were deep in conversation when Evelyn arrived with Emily in tow. Donovan's eyebrows lifted slightly at the sight of the young scientist - not conventionally beautiful like Evelyn, but radiating an earnest intelligence that was equally compelling.

Emily immediately launched into animated conversation with Donovan while Evelyn guided her father through the gathering. Holding a champagne flute, Evelyn moved through the crowd with practiced grace, her polite smile never wavering.

"That Sloan project was quite the coup, Ms. Sterling," a business associate remarked. "We're all green with envy."

Evelyn lowered her lashes demurely. "Just fortunate timing."

"Nonsense," William interjected proudly. "Pure talent and hard work." Evelyn shot her father an exasperated look before laughing, her face transforming with genuine amusement.

This was the scene that greeted Nathan when he boarded - Evelyn radiant with laughter, surrounded by admirers. Tristan Whitmore, following behind, noticed Nathan's transfixed expression.

"See something interesting?" Tristan followed Nathan's gaze and smirked. "Ah. The yacht's decor is quite... impressive."

Nathan ignored the jab. "The vessel is adequate." Tristan rolled his eyes. Who was Nathan trying to fool?

Evelyn's smile froze when she spotted Nathan on deck. "Why is he here?" she hissed to her father.

"I invited him," William replied calmly. Tristan wheeled Nathan forward. Even seated, Nathan commanded attention - his broad shoulders and imposing presence making the wheelchair irrelevant. No one dared comment on his injury.

"Happy birthday, Mr. Sterling." Nathan's voice was smooth as aged whiskey.

William nodded, his expression warmer than usual. "Thank you. How's the recovery progressing?" After all, Nathan's injuries were sustained protecting Evelyn.

Nathan's gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Your daughter has been... exceptionally attentive. I'm recovering well, thank you."

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. The man was utterly shameless.
###Chapter 429 Were Not Close

Tristan Whitmore's jaw dropped as he boarded the luxury yacht. His eyes locked onto the fleet of limited-edition Ferraris parked along the dock, including one particular model he'd been trying to acquire for months without success. A pang of envy shot through him.

"Evelyn, did you all arrive in those Ferraris?" Tristan asked, trying to sound casual.

Evelyn Sinclair flipped her long hair over one shoulder, making the diamond studs in her ears catch the moonlight. "No," she said with a playful smirk. "We took the helicopter."

Tristan's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.

Nearby, Ethan Caldwell and Adrian Blackwood approached. Evelyn's face lit up as she went to greet them. Adrian glanced at Nathan Blackwood and shook his head in disappointment. "My uncle is hopeless. Even after that accident, he still can't win her back."

Ethan chuckled. "Mr. Blackwood's situation is unique. Any other woman would have melted instantly for a man with his resources and looks." His gaze drifted to Evelyn. "But then again, she's Evelyn Sinclair."

"It's been ages!" Evelyn greeted them warmly. "How have you been?"

Adrian sighed dramatically. "Ever since you left the show, ratings have plummeted. Copycats are everywhere now - my career might be over!"

Ethan simply smiled. "I'm doing well."

Evelyn nodded. "Glad to hear it."

"Did she just ignore me?" Adrian muttered under his breath. "What was the point of my dramatic speech then?"

The trio moved to the deck where the ocean breeze played with Evelyn's hair. The night air carried the salty tang of the sea, mingling with the rich aroma of the cabernet in her glass. Moonlight danced across the dark liquid as she swirled it absently.

Adrian spent the next twenty minutes trying to convince Evelyn to make guest appearances on his show again. His voice grew hoarse from pleading, but Evelyn remained unmoved.

Suddenly, little Oliver Sinclair came barreling toward them. "Muse!" he called excitedly, spotting Evelyn talking to Preston Sinclair nearby.

Evelyn's expression softened as she patted the boy's head. "Oliver, you came too?"

The child wrapped his arms around her legs and began digging through his pockets. "Muse! I brought you a present!"

Evelyn looked down and froze. Oliver was holding three gleaming gold bars that shone brilliantly under the deck lights. The extravagant gift looked absurdly out of place in the small boy's hands.

Her lips pressed together in a thin line. "Where on earth did this child learn such spending habits?"

Adrian and Ethan stood speechless beside her.

Evelyn knelt to Oliver's level. "Sweetheart, next time just bring me white chrysanthemums, okay?" She'd rather receive simple flowers than extravagant gifts from a child.

Oliver tilted his head in confusion. "Don't you like it? You liked the gold bracelet I gave you last time! Nanny said gold bars are more impressive!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. "I prefer flowers, darling."

Oliver's face broke into a determined grin. "Okay!" He dashed off immediately, presumably to search the entire yacht for white chrysanthemums.

Adrian whistled. "Damn, Evelyn. You've even got kids wrapped around your finger?"

She arched one perfect eyebrow. "What can I say? Charm comes naturally."

Their laughter was interrupted when Archibald, the Sterling Manor butler, approached discreetly. "Miss Sinclair," he murmured, "there's a woman insisting on seeing you. She's not among your known acquaintances."

Evelyn set down her wine glass with a frown. "I'll handle it."

Outside, the bodyguards were blocking a frantic Celeste Rousseau. The woman's eyes lit up when she saw Evelyn. "Ms. Sinclair! I've been searching everywhere for you! I need your help!"

Evelyn's expression turned icy. "Ethan Caldwell," she said flatly. "We're not close."

Celeste flushed with embarrassment. "But we've met before! You're the only one who can help me now!"
###Chapter 430 The Lowest of the Low

At first, everyone assumed Celeste Rousseau would become Mrs. Gregory Thornton. They showered her with attention, bending over backwards to please her.

But when Gregory married another woman, Celeste found herself abruptly exiled from that glittering social circle.

No one would lift a finger to help her now.

Evelyn Sinclair studied Celeste with icy detachment. She wondered how this woman had even managed to get on board when they were anchored so far from shore. Unsurprisingly, without an invitation, Celeste was stopped at the entrance by security.

Evelyn made no move to intervene.

"Help me? Why should you?" Celeste stood trembling, her delicate features arranged in perfect vulnerability.

"Ms. Sinclair, we may not know each other well, but you destroyed my life. Doesn't that weigh on your conscience?" Though the words were accusatory, Celeste delivered them with practiced fragility - all while directing every ounce of blame at Evelyn.

If Evelyn hadn't walked into that private room with Ethan Caldwell that fateful day, Celeste would be Mrs. Thornton by now. The bitterness of her fall from grace festered in her heart. She'd tried returning to Ethan, but he refused to see her.

She couldn't accept defeat - not when she'd been so close to securing a life of luxury. Evelyn was almost impressed by the sheer audacity of Celeste's delusions.

"Guilty?" Evelyn arched one perfect brow. "Do police officers lose sleep over arresting criminals?" The barb hit its mark, draining the color from Celeste's face.

"That's cruel!" Celeste spat.

"What you did was cruel," Evelyn countered smoothly. "You've lived in privilege since birth. You couldn't possibly understand how hard I've worked to get where I am!" Celeste's eyes welled with crocodile tears.

"Why should I care about your struggles?" Evelyn's voice remained perfectly composed.

Celeste had no one to blame but herself for her current predicament. This pathetic display was beyond absurd.

Celeste faltered, unprepared for Evelyn's complete immunity to her act. How was she supposed to proceed when her usual tactics failed?

"You made your choices, Celeste," Evelyn said, each word deliberate. "Did you really think you'd never get caught? You weren't framed. You're simply facing the consequences of your own actions."

Celeste's lips trembled. "But...I was so close! All I wanted was a good life with Gregory—"

Evelyn cut her off sharply. "Must I really endure your presence on such a beautiful day? Spare me the theatrics and get to the point. What do you want?"

Celeste bit her plump lower lip. "Are you and Ethan really together?"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh. The hypocrisy was staggering. Mere moments ago, this woman had been lamenting her lost chance with Gregory Thornton, and now she was probing about Ethan Caldwell? If Ethan were still that penniless explorer, Celeste wouldn't give him a second glance.

Evelyn didn't answer, merely offering an enigmatic smile. Her piercing gaze seemed to strip Celeste bare, exposing every ugly truth.

"Ethan and I shared something special," Celeste pressed on, desperation creeping into her voice. "For me, he changed all his banking information. His passwords became my birthday. Every cent he earned went into our joint account."

She lifted her chin with false pride. "He proposed six times. Six! I turned him down each time. Has he done any of that for you?"

Celeste clearly believed that as Ethan's ex, she posed some threat to Evelyn. That these petty boasts would rattle the heiress. She watched eagerly for any sign of distress.

Evelyn observed the shift in Celeste's demeanor, recognizing the transparent attempt at manipulation. This was about provoking jealousy, about making Evelyn doubt her relationship with Ethan.

How amusing.

If Evelyn and Ethan were actually together, these barbs might have stung. But they weren't. And Celeste's pathetic performance only confirmed what Evelyn had always known - this woman was truly the lowest of the low.
###Chapter 431 Cast You Into the Depths

The atmosphere between them instantly turned glacial. Evelyn's silence pleased Celeste immensely - it meant her carefully chosen words had struck their mark.

A smug smile curled Celeste's lips as she raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. The bay's shimmering reflections danced across her face like liquid gold.

"You have countless options besides Ethan," Celeste said, her voice dripping with false sympathy. "But he's my only chance at happiness. Ms. Sterling, won't you take pity on me? Please give him back to me?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her lips twisting into a dangerous smirk that didn't reach her cold, assessing eyes. She tilted her head slightly, deliberately provoking Celeste with her amused detachment.

"Oh, I do have many choices," Evelyn purred. "And Ethan happens to be one of them. But tell me - did you ever consider the consequences when you stole from him?"

"I had no choice!" Celeste spat through clenched teeth.

Evelyn's laughter was sharp as broken glass. "No choice but to fund your affairs with your boyfriend's money? How... creative."

Celeste's face burned with humiliation at having her dirty laundry aired. She'd simply chosen the wrong man - why should she be punished forever for one mistake? "Even if I messed up, I deserve a chance to make things right with Ethan! He'll forgive me if I just-"

"Forgive you?" A deep male voice cut through the tension like a knife.

Two figures descended the spiral staircase - Ethan Caldwell and Nathan Blackwood. Ethan's expression was thunderous, his piercing gaze locking onto Celeste with undisguised contempt.

"I'm being generous by not pressing charges," Ethan growled. "You still owe me over $300,000, yet you dare ask for forgiveness?"

Celeste visibly paled at Ethan's sudden appearance. She turned pleading eyes toward Evelyn. "Ms. Sterling, why are you laughing? I'm not trying to come between you two. I just want to apologize properly. Please don't let this affect your relationship."

Evelyn's internal monologue was scathing: What a two-faced snake. Outwardly, she exchanged an amused glance with Ethan, whose murderous expression could have frozen lava.

With a playful wink at Ethan, Evelyn turned back to Celeste. "You couldn't possibly affect our relationship," she said sweetly. "But you have ruined my evening."

She leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping to a dangerous purr. "Today was supposed to be special. And yet here you are, making a scene." Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "Consider this your only warning. Say one more word, and I'll have you tossed into the ocean."

The casual threat landed with the weight of an anchor. This was no idle warning - Evelyn Sinclair absolutely meant every word. The dark water lapped hungrily at the yacht's hull, its surface rippling ominously in the cold night breeze.

Celeste's eyes darted nervously between Evelyn and Ethan, searching for any sign of mercy. She found none - only Ethan's mocking, condescending stare that made her feel smaller than plankton.

Biting her lip hard enough to draw blood, Celeste finally understood how severely she'd overestimated her own importance. Her shoulders slumped in defeat as she cast one last, desperate glance at Ethan.
###Chapter 432 She Refuses the Invitation

Ethan Caldwell descended the stairs with impatient strides, his expression softening when his gaze landed on Evelyn Sinclair. "Ms. Sterling, allow me to handle this. You should return to your guests before they witness this... unfortunate spectacle."

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "You're absolutely right. I have no desire to deal with her anyway." A faint smile played on her lips. "Very well, I'll leave this matter in your capable hands."

Celeste Rousseau watched the effortless chemistry between the two people who barely acknowledged her existence, her fists clenching involuntarily. Ethan approached with powerful strides that echoed across the deck.

An aura of dangerous intensity surrounded him as he seized Celeste's arm, dragging her toward the yacht's railing. With one forceful motion, he pinned her against the polished metal, her back arching precariously over the dark abyss of the Pacifica Ocean.

Though the waters appeared calm, the depth held untold dangers. A frigid ocean breeze whipped past them, making Celeste shiver violently. Her fingers turned white from gripping the railing as her voice quivered. "Ethan, what the hell are you doing?!"

Darkness shrouded Ethan's handsome features, his eyes glacial. He applied more pressure, leaning her further over the edge. "Celeste, I'm offering you two choices," he said with chilling calm. "Disappear from my life permanently, or..."

His grip tightened. "I'll let gravity decide your fate right now."

For the first time, Celeste heard undisguised loathing in his usually controlled voice. The coldness penetrated her bones, triggering primal fear. She glanced down in panic.

The yacht had sailed far from shore. Even if she screamed, no one would hear over the party music. The Sterling security team stood like statues behind them - witnesses who would never testify. If Ethan dropped her into these waters, she'd vanish without a trace.

Regret flooded her system. Her petty schemes meant nothing against people like Evelyn and Ethan. Ethan's grip didn't relent. It would take mere seconds to send her overboard. He was simply waiting for her decision.

Would he actually do it? The old Ethan might have hesitated. But since being revealed as the sole heir to Sterling Worldwide, he'd transformed into someone far more dangerous. Celeste had heard enough whispers in Preston Sinclair's circle to know what powerful men were capable of.

The salt-laced wind stung her cheeks as her pulse hammered wildly. Terror turned her blood to ice. "So?" Ethan's voice sounded like it came from the depths of hell. This wasn't the man she'd once known.

Tears welled in Celeste's eyes as she clung to the railing, her nails scraping metal. "The first option! I'll leave immediately! Just let me go!" In that moment, she saw something terrifying in Ethan's eyes - a ruthlessness that promised he'd follow through.

The arrogance of power surrounded him like an impenetrable force field. Celeste bit her trembling lip. "You're really in love with her, aren't you?" she whispered.

Ethan's gaze darkened further. Celeste felt despair clawing at her throat. A hysterical laugh escaped her. "She said you're just one of her options. It's obvious she doesn't—"

Ethan released her abruptly, his expression glacial. He turned to a nearby security officer. "Prepare a speedboat to remove this woman immediately." The guard hesitated only briefly before nodding. A vessel stood ready for guest transportation.

Nathaniel Blackwood observed Ethan's expression and Celeste's venomous words. He swallowed his unspoken warning. This woman wasn't worth the breath.

As Ethan and Nathaniel returned to the gala, the head butler quietly reported every detail of the confrontation to Evelyn. She acknowledged the information with a slight nod before seamlessly rejoining the festivities.

Her gaze swept across the ballroom - William Sterling deep in conversation with Preston Sinclair, their laughter carrying across the space. Turning slightly, she noticed Nathan Blackwood and Tristan Whitmore engaged in what appeared to be a serious discussion. Fragments of her name reached her ears.

Frowning, Evelyn approached the pair. "I'm planning a week-long birthday celebration in Costa Azul," Tristan announced enthusiastically. "Consider it a working vacation."

"I'm occupied," Nathan replied tersely from his wheelchair.

Tristan scoffed. "Occupied doing what? You can't even leave the house for client meetings these days. You've got nothing but time!"

Nathan's expression turned serious. "Evelyn won't agree to go."
###Chapter 433 Marriage Alliance

"What does this have to do with her?" Tristan Whitmore's voice rose sharply in frustration.

After years of friendship with Nathan Blackwood, the man still hesitated about whether Evelyn Sinclair would attend his birthday celebration.

Owned by N?velDrama.Org.

Tristan never anticipated Ms. Sinclair's appearance at the event.

Evelyn overheard their exchange and turned, only to have a small figure barrel toward her with sorrowful eyes. The elegant Ms. Sinclair paused gracefully, her lips curving into a gentle smile.

"Oliver, what's troubling you?" Naturally, Nathan and Tristan noticed the interaction. Tristan wheeled Nathan's chair closer.

"What a fortunate encounter! We were just searching for you, Ms. Sinclair," Tristan said cheerfully. Evelyn disregarded him, focusing instead on smoothing Oliver's tousled curls.

The boy's sapphire eyes shimmered with disappointment. "I checked every deck but couldn't find your favorite white chrysanthemums." Silence fell momentarily. Evelyn thought privately, Thank goodness! Tristan barely suppressed a chuckle. "If anyone discovered white chrysanthemums aboard today, the entire staff would be dismissed!"

Oliver scrunched his nose in confusion. "Why?" Tristan adjusted his collar, avoiding explanation while Nathan rolled his eyes before addressing Evelyn.

"Evelyn, would you mind taking me to the upper deck for some air?" Evelyn clenched her jaw. Has he grown accustomed to ordering me about? She forced a polite smile. "Of course." Moving behind his wheelchair, she guided him away.

Tristan shook his head in amusement. Can't he see how reluctant she is? Is Nathan trying to court her or torment her? Oliver made to follow, but Tristan intercepted him. "Where are you off to? Don't interrupt their romantic moment."

"They're nurturing their connection!" Oliver's brow furrowed. "What connection? Muse doesn't care for Grumpy Sir! She only likes me!" He planted small hands on his hips with an indignant huff, rebellious fire sparking in his clear eyes. "Grumpy Sir isn't worthy of Muse!"

Tristan looked down at the child with amusement. "Tsk tsk. What does a youngster know about romance? Affections must be cultivated. Can't you see how perfectly Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Blackwood complement each other?" He arched an eyebrow meaningfully. Beneath the moon's glow, the striking pair on the deck appeared divinely matched - their commanding presence and elite backgrounds creating an undeniable harmony.

Had fate not intervened so dramatically, they would have been society's ideal couple. Oliver snorted derisively and shoved Tristan's leg. "Rubbish! They're completely mismatched! Muse prefers younger gentlemen, not ancient relics like Grumpy Sir! When I grow up, I'll marry her!" Tristan's mouth fell open in surprise. Well now...this child is truly entertaining! He laughed knowingly.

"Oh ho! So you fancy Muse, do you? What a shame..." Tristan shook his head theatrically. Oliver's temper flared. "Why is it a shame?!" Tristan's eyes twinkled mischievously as he teased the boy. "It's regrettable that Muse comes from such an illustrious family. Even if she doesn't wed Mr. Blackwood, there are countless suitable matches for an advantageous union. You'd never stand a chance...unless you're obscenely wealthy."

Oliver's expression dimmed momentarily before brightening with realization. "I am wealthy! My father is Preston Sinclair! He owns half of Wall Street, and everything will be mine!" "Then have your father marry her!" Tristan retorted playfully. "Otherwise, how many decades must you wait for your inheritance?" Oliver growled in frustration. "Never!"

"I will marry Muse!" After fierce contemplation, Oliver clenched his tiny fists with determination. Storming toward his father, he found Preston conversing amiably with William Sterling. William's eyes softened at the boy's approach. If only I had such a grandson! Oliver threw himself against Preston.

He gazed up imploringly. Preston shot his son a warning look. "No tantrums today - it's a special occasion." Oliver beamed angelically, turning luminous eyes toward William with calculated innocence. "I know! It's Muse's daddy's birthday! Happy birthday, Uncle William!" William's heart melted instantly, patting his pockets for cash to reward the charming child.

Moments later, Oliver tugged Preston's sleeve urgently. "Father, I want to inherit your fortune now!"
###Chapter 434 The Consequences of His Actions

The atmosphere turned icy in an instant. William Sterling, who had been searching his pockets for his wallet, froze mid-motion.

His eyes darted to Preston Sinclair's face, which had darkened like a gathering storm. Preston's usually composed features were strained as he fought back visible irritation.

A muscle twitched in Preston's jaw. The typically unshakable businessman's mask began to crack.

"Daddy, I want my inheritance now!" Little Oliver whined, twisting his small body in an exaggerated pout. His adorable face made it impossible for Preston to discipline him.

Preston inhaled sharply. This is my flesh and blood, he reminded himself. I must be patient. He forced his voice into something resembling calm. "Now?" he asked quietly.

Oliver nodded with grave seriousness. "I can only be with my Muse after I get my inheritance!" The child's logic was flawless - the sooner the better. For his beloved Muse, he'd gladly trade his father without hesitation.

Preston's stormy gaze remained fixed on his son's cherubic face. Every ounce of his self-control was being tested.

"Then I'll... expedite matters," Preston ground out between clenched teeth. Oliver's face lit up. "When? Today? Tomorrow?" He began counting on tiny fingers.

Preston shut his eyes, taking another deep breath. His patience snapped. With dangerous precision, he grabbed Oliver by the collar of his shirt.

The motion suggested he might toss the boy like a basketball. William intervened hastily, "Children say the darndest things..."

Preston's expression smoothed into something resembling civility. "My apologies, Chairman Sterling," he said with forced politeness. "I've just remembered urgent business matters requiring my attention."

Without waiting for a response, Preston marched off with Oliver dangling from his grip, the picture of aristocratic disdain.

"Aaaah! Daddy! I need to kiss my Muse goodbye!" Oliver's protests echoed across the deck.

Evelyn Sinclair stood frozen, watching the bizarre scene unfold. Before she could react, Nathan Blackwood seized her wrist. "Don't," he murmured. "Consider what we discussed."

His voice carried uncharacteristic vulnerability. Nathan knew William Sterling wouldn't let his youngest daughter remain unmarried forever. Political alliances would be made.

And he intended to position himself as the prime candidate. Who else could possibly measure up? Even knowing Preston wasn't competition, seeing Evelyn laugh with him had set Nathan's teeth on edge.

Evelyn glanced down at Nathan's restraining hand, then chuckled darkly. "Mr. Blackwood, marital alliances are about compatibility, nothing more. And you?" She smiled sweetly. "I don't make the same mistake twice."

She leaned closer, emphasizing each word. "My tastes have... evolved since my sheltered days. The things - and people - I once found appealing no longer interest me."

"Nathan" came out strangled, as if she'd physically wounded him. Evelyn gently pushed his wheelchair back. "Don't fret. I'll care for you until you recover - I owe you that much for saving my life. But feelings?" She shook her head. "Those can't be manufactured."

The proud Nathan Blackwood had never felt so utterly defeated. No matter his efforts, Evelyn remained just beyond reach. Bitterness, longing, and helpless rage left him speechless.

What recourse did he have? Throwing a tantrum would only prove her point. His knuckles whitened on the wheelchair's arms. Veins stood out along his temples, eyes burning with unshed emotion.
###Chapter 435 Father's Approval

The dim lighting concealed Nathan's expression perfectly. As Evelyn guided him back into the grand ballroom, his features had already schooled into their usual aristocratic detachment.

An icy aura surrounded him. Nathan turned to study Evelyn, his commanding presence softened only by the warmth in his gaze. When he spoke, his voice was carefully controlled, all emotions locked away.

"It's alright, I can wait. Even if there's no chance at all." His words held quiet determination. Evelyn merely rolled her eyes and continued steering him forward.

From across the room, guests couldn't help but notice how perfectly matched they appeared - two powerful figures moving in effortless harmony. Whispers spread like wildfire about an impending reconciliation between the former couple.

Imagine the industry impact if Sterling Enterprises and Blackwood Holdings joined forces again! As the evening wound down, Evelyn accompanied William to bid farewell to their guests.

Nathan deliberately lingered behind. William gave him an approving smile. "Get some rest, son. Take care of yourself." The paternal concern in his voice made Evelyn's brows knit together.

Nathan nodded gracefully. "Until tomorrow then." "Indeed." Once Nathan departed, Evelyn turned to her father in astonishment. "Tomorrow? Father, what exactly have you arranged with him?"

William patted her hand, eyes twinkling with excitement. "He's planned a spectacular twenty-day global tour for my birthday present." The older man looked positively giddy. "I've been wanting to take this trip for years."

Evelyn frowned. "You're going alone?" "Don't be ridiculous, you're coming with me!" William fixed her with a stern yet hopeful gaze that brooked no argument. His expression clearly said refusal would result in immediate disinheritance.

Evelyn suddenly realized she'd been dethroned - Leo the AI tiger was now clearly the favorite child. She forced a dazzling smile. "Of course I'll join you. I'm just surprised by the suddenness."

William chuckled. "The best surprises always are! Honestly, I'm thoroughly impressed with Nathan's gift. The planning must have been immense." His satisfaction was evident.

Something about this felt calculated to Evelyn. "But I have critical projects at the office-" "Alexander can handle them. If Lucas needs to step in, he'll cover any losses." William dismissed her concerns airily, determined not to let anything spoil his plans.

Lucas, who had been approaching unnoticed, froze mid-step, eyes widening comically. "Wait, what? I have to cover losses? Since when am I the family ATM?" His outraged whisper went unheard.

Evelyn sighed in resignation. Might as well enjoy the free vacation. Lucas stomped forward dramatically. "Dad! I want to come too!" William shot him a withering look. "Not happening. You'll ruin everything."

"But I'm the best at vacations! Eating, drinking, partying - that's my specialty!" Lucas protested, gesturing wildly. "Why should I stay behind to work while they're off having fun?"

William's face flushed crimson as he clutched his chest. "Don't make me get violent on my birthday!" The threat sent Lucas scrambling backward before fleeing entirely.

Later at Sterling Manor, Evelyn finally relaxed. She spent playful moments with Leo before indulging in a long bath and skincare routine. Emerging refreshed, she laughed at the sight of the AI tiger sprawled on its back, paws waving happily.

Her thoughts returned to Nathan's unexpected travel arrangement. Since she couldn't avoid it, perhaps inviting others would make it more bearable. Decision made, she reached for her phone. "Mr. Sinclair, is Oliver available?"
###Chapter 436 Are You Coming Along?

Evelyn Sinclair ended her call and flipped open her laptop, scanning through the flood of emails in her inbox.

Exclusive content from NovelDrama.org.

The sheer volume of documents requiring her attention was staggering. Fortunately, Bennett had already filtered the most critical ones, handling the rest on her behalf.

She shot him a quick message, flagging urgent matters—especially the Kingsley Tech project. She wasn’t entirely convinced Benjamin Carter could manage everything smoothly.

As she worked, Leo, her AI tiger companion, leaped onto her lap. He propped his tiny front paws on her chest, tilting his head with exaggerated cuteness. "Mama, I miss Papa."

Evelyn, who had been about to hug him, froze. Instead, she flicked his nose lightly.

"Why on earth would you miss him?"

Leo twitched his whiskers. "It's part of my emotional interaction protocol—designed by Emily Whitaker."

"I'm programmed to think of Mama and Papa ten times a day to cultivate deep familial bonds."

Evelyn chuckled, running her fingers over his soft head. "Even emotions can be programmed now, huh?"

"Then why not think of others? Like Lucas or my father?"

At the mention of Lucas, Leo's tail flicked smugly. "Grampy says I'm the best-behaved in the Sterling family—way better than that troublemaker Lucas!"

Evelyn laughed. William Sterling never missed a chance to tease Lucas in front of Leo.

Between playful banter with Leo and finishing up work, she began packing for her trip. The light rain from the previous night had cleared, leaving the morning air crisp and sweet. Sunlight streamed through the sheer curtains, casting golden streaks across the room.

With no pressing meetings, Evelyn slept in, waking naturally past nine. She took her time freshening up, applying light makeup, and dressing leisurely.

Her phone remained silent. She realized belatedly that she hadn’t set a departure time with Nathan or her father the night before.

So she lingered—meditating on the balcony, stretching lazily. By the time she descended the stairs, it was nearly eleven. Voices floated up from below.

"Evelyn worked until midnight and had an early meeting this morning," William was saying, sighing dramatically. "She pushes herself too hard."

Evelyn paused mid-step, guilt prickling her conscience.

Lucas’ amused chuckle followed. Nathan’s voice, smooth and measured, cut in. "Her success comes from both brilliance and relentless effort. That’s why she’s achieved so much."

"Exactly!" William agreed enthusiastically.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Enough with the flattery," she muttered, hurrying downstairs.

Lucas lounged on the sofa, grinning. "Look who finally decided to join the living."

She shot him a glare before freezing at the sight of the full room. "Oh. You’re all here."

Without missing a beat, she added, "I just wrapped up a conference call."

William beamed, clearly buying the lie.

"Good morning, Ms. Sterling!" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow, Nathan’s ever-efficient butler, greeted her warmly.

She nodded in acknowledgment. Oliver Sinclair sat obediently beside Preston, unusually subdued—likely after a stern talking-to. The moment Oliver spotted Evelyn, his eyes lit up. He glanced at his father, staying put but practically vibrating with excitement.

Nathan checked his Patek Philippe. "We should get going."

Oliver sprang up. "Yes! Let’s go! I get to travel with the prettiest lady!"

Nathan’s expression tightened imperceptibly. "You’re coming?"

"Duh!"

Nathan arched a brow. "And your father is fine with you traveling alone?"

Preston sighed, straightening his tie. "Precisely why I’ll be joining as well."
###Chapter 437 His Reputation

The moment Preston Sinclair spoke those words, every eye in the room snapped toward him with shock.

Even Evelyn Sinclair hadn't anticipated Preston's sudden declaration - she'd only invited young Oliver Sinclair last night.

Nathan Blackwood's expression darkened instantly as he fixed Preston with an intense, unreadable stare.

Surely Preston Sinclair isn't dense enough to miss my warning glare? What game is he playing? Nathan thought bitterly.

William Sterling froze momentarily before quickly recovering his usual diplomatic smile.

"Wonderful! The more company the merrier!" William beamed. "It's only natural Mr. Sinclair would be concerned about Oliver's safety. Shall we depart then, Mr. Blackwood?"

Nathan forced a tight smile. "Certainly."

Standing off to the side, Theodore "Teddy" Winslow gaped in silent dismay. He'd orchestrated this trip specifically to create opportunities for Evelyn and Nathan.

With William along, it could pass as a family outing. But with Preston and Oliver tagging along?

Would this become some bizarre corporate retreat? Nathan's gaze shifted to Evelyn.

His icy expression melted into something warmer as his lips curved into a gentle smile. "Let's go relax for a few days."

Evelyn met his gaze and returned the smile.

"Mr. Blackwood, how thoughtful of you." Despite their tense parting last night and their complicated history, they could both pretend nothing had happened when morning came.

Teddy pushed Nathan's wheelchair with a deep frown. This wasn't part of the plan!

The helicopter waited on the lawn nearby.

Marcus assisted William aboard while Preston strode confidently up the steps, leaving young Oliver struggling behind him. The boy turned back to check if his beloved "Muse" Evelyn was following.

Evelyn lingered behind, finishing a message to Bennett. When she looked up, she saw Teddy struggling to support Nathan alone.

Frowning, she stepped forward to support Nathan's other arm.

Nathan stiffened momentarily before looking at her with undisguised delight.

Evelyn remained silent as they boarded.

"Thank you," Nathan murmured.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Mr. Blackwood, you must have remarkable stamina to travel in your condition."

What's his real motive? Why push himself to travel when injured? Before Nathan could respond, Teddy hastily interjected.

"Mr. Blackwood hasn't slept properly for days preparing for Chairman Sterling's birthday. He wanted everything perfect - the antiques, paintings, sculptures... But knowing Chairman Sterling has seen every luxury, Mr. Blackwood realized experiences matter more."

Teddy continued earnestly, "When he learned Chairman Sterling always dreamed of traveling but never could, Mr. Blackwood postponed critical meetings just to make this happen. Isn't that touching?"

Evelyn's lips twitched as she gave Teddy an amused look. "You seem intimately familiar with Mr. Blackwood's sleeping habits."

Teddy froze. "Huh?!"

Nathan's expression darkened as he shot Teddy a withering glare. My reputation is ruined!

Evelyn turned away to find her father, leaving Teddy standing in Nathan's icy shadow.

During the flight, sudden turbulence rocked the helicopter violently. Evelyn, who hadn't fastened her seatbelt, nearly tumbled from her seat.

Preston, seated beside her, instantly clamped a firm hand around hers, steadying her until she regained balance.

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Thank you, Mr. Sinclair."

Preston released her with a slight nod. "You're welcome."

Seconds later, he suddenly reached across her body, his hand brushing against her left waist. The unexpected contact made Evelyn stiffen.

She immediately recoiled, eyeing him warily.

Preston's lips thinned. "Seatbelt," he said tersely, buckling the neglected restraint with efficient movements.
###Chapter 438 The Coveted Touch

Evelyn studied Preston's outstretched hand for a brief moment before fastening her seatbelt. A soft smile played on her lips. "Mr. Sinclair, aren't you neglecting your responsibilities by taking this much time off?"

Preston's expression remained unreadable. "Dominic isn't even in the country. Should I stay behind to entertain Victor and Benjamin? I've put the project on hold temporarily—let them handle the preliminary research."

His gaze flickered toward her. "By the time we return, we'll see what progress they've made."

Heat crept up Evelyn's neck. Guilt prickled at her conscience—she hadn't been pulling her weight at Kingsley Tech lately.

Preston adjusted his cufflinks. "Oliver insisted I come along. He's still sulking over last night's scolding."

At the mention of Oliver, Evelyn's smile widened. "So that's your real motivation? You're quite the doting father, Mr. Sinclair. He adores you."

What a heartwarming father-son bond!

Preston's lips twitched but he said nothing.

Adores me? That little schemer just wants early access to my trust fund. Secretly, he'd already instructed Oliver's tutors to triple his assignments. This vacation wouldn't be all play for the young master.

From several rows back, Nathan observed their easy banter through narrowed eyes. An unfamiliar tightness coiled in his chest—something he'd been ignoring was becoming impossible to disregard.

Beside him, Teddy shifted uncomfortably. The tension was palpable. He couldn't stand Preston Sinclair—the man's subtle yet unmistakable favoritism toward Evelyn was glaringly obvious.

With years of matchmaking experience, Teddy was 90% certain Preston harbored feelings for Evelyn. That simply wouldn't do. Clearing his throat, he leaned forward.

"Ms. Sinclair, perhaps we should switch seats? The view here is spectacular."

Evelyn frowned but before she could respond, Oliver's piping voice cut through the cabin. "Muse is trying to sleep! Stop bothering her!"

Teddy's mouth snapped shut.

Evelyn suppressed a laugh. Bless that clever boy.

Oliver preened. If William hadn't dragged him to the front row, he'd be sitting with his Muse right now. Uncomfortable leaving her beside the "grumpy mister," he'd strategically enlisted his father as a placeholder.

Evelyn didn't inquire about their destination. Soon, the helicopter's gentle hum lulled her to sleep. Unconsciously, her head found its way to Preston's shoulder.

Hours later, small hands shook her awake. Oliver's excited face filled her vision. "Muse, look! A real-life castle!"

Dusk had fallen. Through the window, Evelyn saw rolling emerald hills framing an illuminated manor—grand, imposing, and shrouded in mystery like something from a Gothic novel.

The helicopter descended onto a private helipad. After being cooped up for hours, Oliver burst out the moment the doors opened, William hot on his heels.

Preston rose gracefully, then extended his hand toward Evelyn with practiced elegance. Before she could accept, Teddy wedged himself between them. "Allow me! I'll assist Ms. Sinclair."

His protective stance blocked Preston completely.

Evelyn rolled her eyes and descended unaided. Crisp night air greeted her, the sky ablaze with stars. A team of butlers approached briskly.

Teddy froze—Nathan still hadn't disembarked. Flushing, he turned to Evelyn with an awkward smile. "Ms. Sinclair, perhaps you could help Mr. Blackwood?"
###Chapter 439 A World Unveiled

Evelyn froze mid-step. Why was Nathan descending so quickly? She spun around to see Nathan maneuvering his wheelchair down the ramp unassisted. The precarious angle made it look like he might tumble down the stairs at any moment.

One wrong move and they'd be rushing him to the emergency room instead of beginning their long-awaited vacation.

"Stop! Don't move!" Evelyn commanded sharply.

Nathan immediately stilled, waiting obediently for assistance. Before Evelyn could reach him, she noticed Marcus standing just behind Nathan's wheelchair. The bodyguard had been loading their luggage and hadn't yet disembarked from the helicopter.

Marcus's expression darkened as he set down the suitcases.

Without waiting for instructions, he firmly pushed Nathan's wheelchair down the ramp. Nathan's shoulders tensed in surprise at the unexpected assistance.

The ramp was stable, and Marcus applied just enough pressure to control the descent. Within moments, the wheelchair touched down safely on the cobblestone path.

Nathan's jaw clenched with unspoken irritation. He had no way to voice his displeasure.

Marcus turned to retrieve the remaining luggage. Catching Evelyn's eye, he said, "Miss Sinclair, my assistance is always available when you require it."

Evelyn offered a grateful smile. "Thank you, Marcus." Without his intervention, she would have needed to help Nathan down herself.

She glanced briefly at Nathan before striding ahead to join William.

Theodore swallowed hard. "Much obliged, Marcus," he murmured before rushing to take control of Nathan's wheelchair. Leaning close, he whispered, "Patience, sir. We'll have ample opportunities later. Remember Marcus represents Ms. Sinclair's interests."

Nathan remained silent.

His expression was unreadable, eyes like chips of ice. Marcus and Evelyn were clearly operating on different wavelengths.

The chateau staff had prepared meticulously for their arrival, setting out an array of teas and pastries tailored to each guest's preferences.

As Nathan entered, the servants bowed in unison. "Good evening, Mr. Blackwood."

He acknowledged them with a curt nod.

"Chairman Sterling," Theodore inquired, "would you prefer to rest or take an evening stroll first?"

William looked invigorated. "I'm ready to explore."

Nathan gave a slight nod, not bothering to consult the others. To the butler, he simply said, "Make the arrangements."

"At once, sir."

Their convoy departed immediately. Within minutes, the cars halted along the banks of River Aurora.

Moonlight danced across the water's tranquil surface. Evelyn caught her breath at the familiar sight. "River Aurora?" Her voice held a note of delighted surprise.

This place held countless memories from her student days in France. She'd walked these banks endlessly, confiding both joys and sorrows to the flowing waters.

Few pedestrians wandered the riverside at this hour, mostly couples enjoying romantic strolls. William was already enthusiastically following young Oliver Sinclair along the water's edge.

Preston Sinclair stood motionless nearby, his imposing silhouette framed against the Gothic architecture across the river.

Evelyn's eyes sparkled like the stars reflected in the water. Nathan allowed himself a small smile. Theodore had chosen well.

As Nathan began wheeling himself toward Evelyn, Marcus stepped forward to assist.

Theodore intercepted quickly, grasping Marcus's arm with a diplomatic smile. "Allow me," he said smoothly.
###Chapter 440 Push You Back

Nathan Blackwood finally got his wish fulfilled as Evelyn Sinclair wheeled him along the banks of River Aurora.

Evelyn was completely absorbed in the picturesque scenery, deliberately ignoring Theodore "Teddy" Winslow's incessant chatter.

With the others gone, Nathan's expression visibly relaxed. Ahead of them stood a muscular, tattooed street performer playing violin.

The musician was deeply immersed in his performance, drawing a small crowd.

Had the music been elegant and refined, paired with the gentle flow of the river, the scene would have been breathtaking.

Unfortunately, the busker was clearly an amateur. The screeching notes resembled an elderly woman's wails, painfully assaulting the ears. Evelyn unconsciously moved closer and stopped.

Nathan listened impassively. When the dreadful performance finally ended, the relieved audience quickly dispersed.

The busker noticed the wheelchair-bound man and his stunning companion. His gaze lingered on Evelyn with pity, clearly thinking she deserved better than being with a disabled man.

Nathan's brow furrowed in thought. "Do you understand my art?" the busker challenged. "If not, move along!" His judgmental stare assessed Nathan, finding only good looks and useless legs.

The disdain in the musician's attitude was palpable. Nathan arched an eyebrow. "It was terrible."

"What did you say?" The busker's eyes turned icy, his tattooed arms flexing threateningly.

Evelyn, still caught in the romantic atmosphere, was startled when Nathan suddenly provoked the stranger.

"It was absolutely dreadful," Nathan repeated calmly, his voice like winter frost.

As the enraged musician rolled up his sleeves, Evelyn acted quickly. "Apologies, this man has mental issues. If you want to fight someone, try him!" She pointed to Marcus, their bodyguard trailing behind them.

She hastily pushed Nathan's wheelchair away, the ride becoming bumpy in her haste to escape.

"Evelyn," Nathan finally called out, amusement dancing in his eyes. This uncharacteristic retreat was unlike her.

"I'm being generous by not abandoning you there," she retorted. "Didn't your butler Teddy arrange proper security?"

Hearing her cold tone, Nathan remained silent before finally murmuring, "It truly was awful." As CEO of Blackwood Enterprises, he wouldn't lie to flatter some random street performer.

"Then I'll take you back so you can tell him personally," Evelyn said coolly.

Before she could turn around, Nathan gripped the wheelchair arms tightly. "Don't!" He felt strangely helpless, but with Evelyn, he'd allow it.

"Let's not go back. Look how the river sparkles like diamonds," he deflected. "If not for my current condition, I wouldn't be retreating!" The thought was laughable.

Evelyn scoffed. "Pathetic coward!"

They reached the center of a quaint bridge, where a peaceful, intoxicating atmosphere enveloped them. Nathan studied Evelyn's profile as she leaned against the railing.

Her delicate features were illuminated by the soft light, eyes bright with amusement, lips curved slightly. She was breathtaking.

Suddenly, words he'd never spoken came easily. "Compared to you, every violinist in the world is garbage."
###Chapter 441 You Dare Challenge Me?

Evelyn Sinclair commanded attention wherever she went.

Just like that first night at Velvet Lounge when Nathan Blackwood first heard her play the violin on stage.

She had been radiant, passionate, and utterly self-assured.

As if every beautiful thing in the universe existed solely for her.

That memory would forever be etched in Nathan's mind.

Evelyn watched the rippling waters of River Aurora in silence.

Was this psychopath Nathan trying to ruin her perfect evening?

"I suddenly want to give you every beautiful thing this world has to offer," Nathan murmured.

Was he serious? Evelyn whirled around, eyebrows knitted together.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, fireworks exploded across the night sky behind Nathan.

Vibrant bursts of amethyst and crimson illuminated the darkness.

A breathtaking spectacle unfolded as the meteor shower cascaded toward the river's surface.

Evelyn gasped at the dazzling display reflecting off the water.

Nathan sat motionless in his wheelchair, silhouetted against the pyrotechnics. Yet he appeared anything but fragile.

His gaze never left Evelyn's awestruck face, ignoring the fireworks completely.

His eyes softened with possessive tenderness as he studied her reaction. "Do you like it?"

Evelyn caught her breath. "This was you?"

Arranging fireworks over River Aurora required navigating countless regulations. How had he managed it?

Nathan's lips curved into a smile.

Before he could answer, a tall, imposing figure approached them.

Preston Sinclair chuckled lowly. "It's King Alexander III's birthday celebration. We're fortunate to witness this projection - remarkably lifelike, isn't it?"

Evelyn turned toward Preston, her face lighting up. "What an incredible coincidence!"

Preston nodded. "There's a festival happening downstream. Your father and Oliver went to investigate. Shall we join them?"

"Absolutely!" Evelyn eagerly agreed.

She'd initially assumed Nathan orchestrated this display. What a relief to discover otherwise.

Nathan would never plan something so whimsical - his idea of romance involved throwing money and jewelry at problems.

As Evelyn reached for Nathan's wheelchair, Preston smoothly intercepted.

"Your father's looking for you," Preston said, his voice smooth as velvet. "I'll assist Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn didn't hesitate, dashing off with childlike enthusiasm.

Marcus, her ever-present bodyguard, followed close behind, leaving Theodore standing awkwardly nearby.

Preston took control of Nathan's wheelchair.

An oppressive silence descended between the two men.

The vibrant fireworks created a stark contrast to their icy standoff.

Both were titans of industry, sharp-minded and battle-hardened from years at the corporate summit.

Though they rarely interacted, each understood the other's nature perfectly.

Nathan flicked away a fallen leaf with chilling precision. His entire demeanor had shifted - this was a side of himself he never showed Evelyn.

"Mr. Sinclair," Nathan's voice dripped with menace, "your intentions extend beyond mere business collaboration, don't they?"

Preston kept one hand casually in his pocket, his towering frame radiating equal authority.

He met Nathan's piercing gaze with an amused smirk. "Mr. Blackwood, are you upset about Oliver joining us... or that I accompanied him?"

The unspoken challenge hung between them.

Preston saw no need for denial - his presence spoke volumes.

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously, their predatory glint unmistakable in the flickering light.

"You dare challenge me?"
###Chapter 442 You're Conceited

The air between the two men turned icy in an instant.

Preston Sinclair showed no aggression, his expression cool and composed, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

"So what if I am?"

Nathan Blackwood struggled to contain his fury. The thought of someone else coveting what was his sent waves of irritation through him.

Preston was undeniably powerful, shrouded in mystery.

Nathan, on the other hand, commanded an empire of his own.

In terms of influence, they were evenly matched.

Nathan quickly regained his composure. Anger was a weakness, and he refused to be the one to falter first. His face darkened as the intermittent bursts of fireworks cast shifting shadows over his grim expression.

"Mr. Sinclair," Nathan said coldly, "you're far too conceited."

Why would Evelyn ever consider Preston when he already had a child and a past marriage?

Nathan knew Evelyn—she wouldn't just jump into another relationship.

Preston remained unbothered. "I'm not," he replied smoothly, exuding confidence.

Nathan turned his head slightly, shooting a sharp glance at Teddy. The man immediately stepped forward, slightly out of breath.

Teddy gave Preston a knowing look before deliberately saying, "Mr. Blackwood, you should seize this moment under the moonlight. You and Ms. Sinclair belong together—don't let this opportunity slip away."

Without another word, Teddy pushed Nathan's wheelchair, swiftly leaving Preston behind.

Preston watched them go, chuckling softly before his gaze drifted toward the riverside.

The walkway was alive with people.

Evelyn walked arm-in-arm with Oliver, both of them laughing as they explored the vibrant stalls.

William Sterling looked on with pure contentment. Having his daughter by his side, enjoying such a carefree evening, was everything he could ask for.

Evelyn had decided that since she was in France, she might as well catch up with old friends.

She had already made plans to meet them the following night.

Meanwhile, Teddy leaned in slightly as he pushed Nathan's chair. "Mr. Blackwood, I have a feeling Mr. Sinclair has his eyes on Ms. Sinclair. She’s extraordinary—it’s no surprise."

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

Teddy continued, "And honestly, their rapport seems stronger than yours."

Nathan’s expression darkened further.

Teddy quickly backtracked. "But I doubt Ms. Sinclair is interested. He’s wealthy, sure, but he’s got baggage—a child from a previous marriage. Inheritance disputes alone would be a nightmare." He sighed dramatically. "Rich people problems, am I right?"

Nathan’s tension eased slightly.

Then Teddy added, "Though… she does seem fond of the kid. What if she doesn’t mind being a stepmother?"

"Shut up." Nathan’s voice was dangerously low, his grip on the armrest turning his knuckles white.

"If that day ever comes," he said through gritted teeth, "I’ll throw you into the River Aurora myself."

Teddy swallowed hard, the sudden chill in the air making him shiver.

He wisely decided to keep his mouth shut after that.
###Chapter 443 Master of Flattery

The group returned to the chateau well past midnight, when the last firework had faded from the sky and the streets of Paris grew quiet.

Highland Estates glowed warmly against the night. The ever-efficient butler had prepared a late supper.

Servants guided everyone to their respective suites.

William Sterling retired immediately, exhaustion lining his face. Preston Sinclair carried the sleeping Oliver in his arms toward the east wing.

Evelyn Sinclair felt weary too, her appetite diminished. As she ascended the grand staircase, she noticed Nathan Blackwood's suite stood directly across from hers.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow appeared with a silver tray. "Ms. Sterling, you barely touched dinner." His voice carried that practiced concern only elite staff perfected. "Some light refreshments before bed? They'll help you sleep."

When Evelyn hesitated, Teddy smoothly maneuvered into her room. "Did you know?" He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "Mr. Blackwood personally arranged tonight's fireworks display! Coordinated with six government departments and spent nearly twenty million euros—just so you could see fireworks over River Aurora!"

He sighed dramatically. "If I were a woman, I'd be so moved I could die happy right now."

Evelyn's breath caught. "The fireworks...weren't they for King Alexander III's birthday celebration?"

Teddy's expression twisted in theatrical surprise. "What an odd coincidence! Then this Alexander fellow got terribly lucky." He waved a dismissive hand. "Those fireworks were absolutely not for him. Mr. Blackwood said your Paris tour couldn't be ordinary—it might disappoint you and Chairman Sterling. So he orchestrated this entire spectacle."

Leaning closer, he added, "When has France ever celebrated a monarch's birthday with such extravagance?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her shawl. During her years studying in France, she couldn't recall any grand celebrations for historical kings' birthdays. Not that she'd paid much attention—she'd always joined festivities on whim rather than tradition.

This had been Nathan's doing. Entirely.

"That's...excessive," she murmured, the weight of yet another unpayable debt settling on her shoulders.

Across the hallway, a door clicked open.

Nathan stood framed in the doorway, leaning slightly on an ebony cane. His tall silhouette appeared almost healthy—if one ignored the pallor of his face. Dark hair fell carelessly across his forehead, giving him an uncharacteristically approachable air.

"Why aren't you two resting?" His voice, rich and low, carried down the corridor.

Teddy practically bounced from Evelyn's room. "Ms. Sterling discovered you arranged the fireworks! She's so touched she nearly wept." The butler clasped his hands dramatically. "She said despite your busy schedule, you still—"

Evelyn's jaw dropped.

"—found time for such grand gestures, proving your thoughtfulness. Now she prays for your swift recovery, so you might stand together along River Aurora, hand in hand, beneath the fireworks!"

Evelyn's door nearly slammed shut from the force of her disbelief. She'd said four words—four simple words—and Teddy had spun them into this...this absurd romantic soliloquy!

Her gaze sharpened on the unflappable butler. Teddy hadn't become Nathan's head of household merely by being Harrison's cousin, had he? This man could flatter royalty into abdicating their thrones.

Nathan's lips quirked. The usual ice in his gaze softened as it swept over Evelyn, amusement dancing in those dark depths.

"Don't cry," he murmured, the words tender yet teasing. He promised to recover quickly—for her sake, apparently.

With his hair slightly mussed and wearing casual loungewear, Nathan looked nothing like the untouchable CEO of Blackwood Enterprises. Here, he seemed almost...human.

Evelyn stared between the two men, utterly speechless. Nathan actually believed Teddy's ridiculous fabrication? How had this man built a business empire with such gullibility?

Preposterous!
###Chapter 444 Shouldn't Waste Food

Evelyn Sinclair nearly unleashed a biting remark, but the memory of tonight's fireworks softened her tone.

"You're overthinking. Get some rest." Just as she was about to close the door, Nathan Blackwood tilted his head slightly and murmured,

"I'm hungry."

"I want what you're having!" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow chimed in eagerly. "That's the last portion, Ms. Sinclair! It'd be dull eating alone—why not share with Mr. Blackwood? A private midnight supper for two!"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes but stayed silent.

Nathan added quietly, "I won't eat much."

All he wanted was to sit with her for one meal.

Evelyn arched a brow and let out a light, humorless laugh. She turned, picked up the tray, and shoved it into Teddy's hands.

"Fine. I'm not hungry anymore. It's all yours."

She instantly regretted holding back her sharp words earlier. Nathan's infuriating habit of pushing his luck made her want to strangle him.

Nathan frowned. "That's not what I meant."

"But I do," she countered smoothly. "Aren't you starving?" She met his gaze pointedly.

He hadn't eaten anything earlier.

Evelyn scoffed. "Oh, by all means, take it all. Let me just waste away!"

Nathan froze. He'd hoped to exploit Evelyn's momentary softness to mend things between them. He'd forgotten how stubborn she could be.

Before he could react, Evelyn thrust the tray fully into Teddy's grasp.

"Teddy, make sure Mr. Blackwood doesn't choke," she said sweetly before slamming her door shut.

Nathan gritted his teeth, exhaling sharply in frustration.

She never compromises.

His chest tightened.

Teddy stood awkwardly with the tray. He'd prepared this meal specifically for Evelyn, tailored to her tastes. Nathan wouldn't appreciate it.

Swallowing, Teddy forced a smile. "Mr. Blackwood, you should eat on Ms. Sinclair's behalf! She offered it so generously—think of it as extra nourishment for your recovery!"

Nathan only glared.

Teddy sighed and stared at the food. "Fine. I'll eat it. Can't let good food go to waste."

Back in her room, Evelyn opened the photo William Sterling had sent her.

It was a snapshot from the bridge—fireworks bursting behind them, the river shimmering below. Evelyn gazed at the water, unaware of Nathan watching her from his wheelchair, his expression unbearably tender.

Time seemed suspended in that frame.

She knew why her father had taken this picture.

Even he had been moved.

But not her.

Evelyn deleted the photo without hesitation and opened her doctoral group chat.

The group had been buzzing since they learned she was in France. One member brought up today's headlines.

[Did you see the fireworks over River Aurora? Every major outlet is scrambling for details! A once-in-a-century spectacle!]

[Remember your first birthday here, Ev? You wrote in the university's public record that your wish was to see fireworks on these banks! That book might still be there.]

Evelyn scrolled, her mind blanking for a second.

Then it hit her.

She'd completely forgotten.

Watching fireworks along River Aurora had been her first birthday wish—scribbled hastily during her lonely first year in France. Back then, she'd had nothing real to wish for, so she'd written something frivolous, never expecting it to come true.

Until tonight.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Her chest constricted, breath turning shallow.

Did Nathan do this because of my wish?

She set her phone aside and looked out the window. The chateau's warm lights glowed against the rain-drenched gardens, dreamlike in the mist.

A faint drizzle streaked the glass.

Evelyn laughed softly. Just a coincidence. How would he even know?

Then her phone buzzed.

A message from Nathan:

To the brilliant and breathtaking Ms. Sinclair,
May all your wishes come true.
—Your eternal admirer.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, exasperated, but a reluctant smirk tugged at her lips. She typed back:

Having you as a fan is my greatest misfortune.
###Chapter 445 Take Him

The rain had finally stopped after pouring all night, leaving the air thick with moisture and an unexpected chill.

Perhaps it was the sudden weather shift that caused Nathan Blackwood to collapse with a raging fever. Teddy Winslow noticed first, immediately summoning the family physician.

By dawn, the fever broke but left Nathan weak and bedridden. His usually sharp features appeared drawn, his complexion alarmingly pale against the silk sheets.

William Sterling visited multiple times throughout the morning, concern etching deep lines across his forehead. When Nathan managed to speak, his voice emerged as a rough whisper.

"Mr. Sterling, if you're bored, I can arrange a driver to show you around the city. A little rain never hurt anyone," William said, patting Nathan's shoulder through the blankets.

Nathan's dry chuckle turned into a cough. "Seeing you hovering like this might give me another fever." His eyes darted around the room before settling on William with visible disappointment. "Where's Evelyn?"

William cleared his throat. "She mentioned wanting to visit the university before her class reunion. Should be leaving soon."

Nathan's fingers twitched against the sheets. "Send someone with her."

"Marcus is going."

"Take Teddy too," Nathan insisted between coughs.

Teddy's eyes widened in understanding. "Absolutely! Marcus and I make the perfect security team. No danger would dare approach Ms. Sterling with us around!"

William hesitated, not quite seeing the value in sending the portly butler along. Then he remembered the recent assassination attempt and nodded. "Very well."

Teddy practically bounced with enthusiasm. "You have my word - not a single suspicious character will get within ten feet of her!" He scurried from the room before anyone could reconsider.

Evelyn emerged from her suite to find Teddy standing proudly beside Marcus, who looked like he'd rather be anywhere else. She arched an eyebrow. "Shouldn't you be tending to Nathan?"

Teddy stepped forward with a theatrical bow. "Mr. Blackwood insisted I accompany you as additional protection. A radiant jewel like yourself must be safeguarded at all times!"

Evelyn fought the urge to roll her eyes. "You? As protection?"

Teddy puffed out his chest. "Don't let my physique fool you! I may not have combat skills, but I'm practically bulletproof! My mere presence terrifies evildoers."

Evelyn massaged her temples but waved him along. "Fine. Just don't get in the way."

Teddy immediately snatched her handbag. "A queen shouldn't carry her own belongings! These delicate arms were made for finer things." He shot Marcus a triumphant look. "Mind the step, Your Highness!"

Marcus exhaled sharply through his nose as they descended to the waiting car. Raindrops speckled the windows as they drove through Paris' winding streets, Marcus rigid in the front seat while Evelyn scrolled through reunion updates in the back.

Most classmates had scattered across the globe, but a handful remained in France. The car slowed before the university's grand gates, and Evelyn's breath caught at the familiar sight.

Centuries-old spires rose against the gray sky, their Gothic arches whispering of knowledge and tradition. Though she'd earned her doctorate elsewhere, this campus held special meaning - the place where she'd first expanded Sterling Corporation into Europe while completing her studies.

Marcus maintained a respectful distance as they walked, allowing Evelyn space to reminisce. Teddy, however, stuck to her side like an overeager shadow.

"Magnificent!" he exclaimed at a marble fountain, disrupting the peaceful atmosphere. "Simply breathtaking architecture!" His voice echoed across the quiet quad.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, already regretting this arrangement. Some homecoming this was turning out to be.
###Chapter 446 Talk More

"Wow! This place looks straight out of a fairytale!" Theodore's constant chatter snapped Evelyn out of her nostalgic reverie.

She sighed, losing all interest in admiring her familiar surroundings. Her pace quickened.

Why did Father insist on sending Teddy along? Evelyn stopped before an elegant cottage at the rear of campus, turning to face her unwanted companion.

"You and Marcus wait here. I won't be long with my professor."

Teddy scrunched his face, teeth gritted. "But Ms. Sinclair, is your professor male or female? I should get a gift—we must represent Montecito hospitality properly!"

Evelyn rolled her emerald eyes. "I already brought perfume." She gestured to her bag. "Hand it over."

Perfume? Must be a woman! Teddy thought triumphantly as he passed the designer handbag. "What a privilege to meet your mentor! Take your time—we'll be perfectly fine out here."

As if I'd worry about them. Evelyn shot Teddy a withering look but restrained herself—this serene setting deserved better than her temper.

She snatched her bag and disappeared inside. Teddy exhaled in relief, immediately texting Nathan: "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair visited her female professor today. She sighed seven times during the walk—clearly pining for you! Get well soon!"

Message sent, Teddy bounded toward Marcus. "Ice cream? My treat!"

"Buzz off," Marcus grunted.

Inside the library's deepest corner, Evelyn found a gaunt man hunched over a laptop, fingers flying across keys as incomprehensible code filled the screen. Memories flooded back.

Some things never change. Her shoulders relaxed. "Sebastian?"

The typing stopped. He turned, revealing messy brown hair and several days' stubble. Exhausted eyes brightened upon seeing her. "Evie?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a genuine smile as she embraced him. "I didn't announce my Paris trip, but knew you'd be here."

Sebastian chuckled. Though handsome beneath the dishevelment, he'd never cared for appearances. His sharp hazel eyes, however, remained eagle-like in their intensity—the same genius Harvard professor who'd taken a research position here.

At first glance, no one would guess his credentials. He lounged casually, legs crossed, wearing that trademark roguish grin.

"You're still my only student worth teaching," he said. "Everyone else exhausts me."

Evelyn produced a velvet box from her bag. "The limited edition Parfums de Marly you've been collecting."

Sebastian's smile faltered. He accepted the gift with trembling fingers. "Thank you for remembering, but...he passed three months ago. He'll never see this collection complete."

Evelyn froze. After everything they'd endured to be together—Sebastian moving continents for his love—their story ended so abruptly.

Sebastian forced a smile, clutching the box. "He'll know when I tell him though."

"I'm so sorry, I didn't—"

"It's alright." He waved her off. "Now, what brings you here?"

"Just visiting."

"Really?" His eyebrow arched. "With that dashing Mr. Blackwood you're so fond of?"

"The man I loved is dead," Evelyn said softly, the words hanging between them like ghosts.
###Chapter 447: Fate's Unexpected Encounter

Sebastian Laurent knew exactly how deeply Evelyn Sinclair had once loved that man.

He had witnessed her struggles, her heartbreak, the way she poured her soul into loving him.

He had seen her fight, her persistence, the lengths she went to just for his attention.

"That man is dead? What a pity," Sebastian sighed. "The person I loved is also gone." Evelyn lowered her gaze, silent.

Nathan Blackwood was no longer the man she had once been obsessed with.

To her, Nathan Blackwood had died long ago.

After all the twists and turns, her heart had changed completely by the time she returned to the place where it all began.

Meanwhile, in Highland Estates, the supposedly "dead" Nathan Blackwood suddenly sneezed.

The servants immediately stiffened, alert.

Evelyn and Sebastian exchanged a quiet glance.

Then, Sebastian's eyes lit up. "Oh! Let me introduce you to my first student—still single, by the way!"

Evelyn barely reacted. "That won't be necessary."

"He's already here! What timing!" Sebastian grinned. "Speak of the devil!"

Evelyn turned, her mood complicated.

The moment she saw the man, her body froze. Her eyes widened in shock.

"Mr. Sinclair?!"

Standing before her was none other than the impeccably dressed Preston Sinclair.

When Preston spotted Evelyn, surprise flickered across his face—but only for a second. His expression smoothed into calm indifference.

"Ms. Sterling," he said coolly. "What brings you here?"

"You two know each other?!" Sebastian looked even more stunned.

Evelyn and Preston nodded simultaneously.

Sebastian shook his head in disbelief. "Then this is fate! A match made in heaven!"

An awkward silence fell.

Evelyn frowned. "Don't be ridiculous. We just have business dealings."

It was the truth.

Sebastian nodded in understanding. "Right, I forgot—my only two students are both powerhouses on the Forbes list. Of course you'd cross paths."

Preston chuckled. "Two students? The other one is Ms. Sterling?"

Evelyn was even more astonished. She barely kept her composure.

What kind of absurd coincidence was this?!

Sebastian Laurent, the genius professor, had always kept his students' identities strictly confidential. No one knew who they were—not even each other.

Sebastian pointed at Evelyn. "Yep, that's her."

Preston's gaze sharpened with interest. "Sebastian, given your standards, I never expected you to take on another student. And for it to be Ms. Sterling… what are the odds?"

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "Extremely low, apparently."

Sebastian gestured at Preston with a grin. "He's two years older than me. Became my student after losing to me in an international hacking competition."

Then he pointed at Evelyn. "She became my student because she beat me in the European International Tournament."

Preston's smile deepened. "Ms. Sterling, I didn’t know you had an interest in coding."

Evelyn was a brilliant businesswoman, the heiress of a wealthy family. Preston hadn’t expected her to have such skills.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Just a hobby from my past."

Preston didn’t press further.

Sebastian studied them both, his gaze flickering with amusement. "You two are clearly meant to be. Don’t waste this opportunity."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Stop meddling." She smoothly turned to Preston, changing the subject. "Oliver didn’t come with you?"

Preston replied, "He’s still intimidated by teachers, honestly."

Evelyn nodded in understanding.

Outside, Marcus stood guard, watching the scene unfold.

Despite his professional training, even he couldn’t hide his surprise at seeing Preston Sinclair there.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow hurried over with two ice cream cones, slightly out of breath.

"Marcus, take one! You can have chocolate. I’ll take strawberry."
###Chapter 448 Stay Outside

Marcus stood motionless like a statue carved from granite.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow circled him impatiently, waving two melting ice cream cones.

"Just take one! Evelyn will be chatting for ages. Women always have endless things to discuss!"

Marcus didn't even blink.

Teddy dramatically took an exaggerated bite, letting the vanilla drip down his chin. "Mmm! Heavenly!"

Marcus shot him a withering glare before refocusing on the glass partition. Through the transparent barrier, he could see Evelyn Sinclair engaged in animated conversation with two men.

Teddy followed his gaze mid-chew.

The ice cream cones slipped from his trembling hands, splattering on the marble floor. "Holy mother of— Who are those men?!"

His face turned ashen.

"That's Preston Sinclair sitting beside Evelyn! Since when—" Teddy clutched his chest as if having a coronary. "This can't be happening!"

Marcus rolled his eyes at the mess.

Teddy staggered forward, pointing at the glass with a shaking finger. "How?! When did Mr. Sinclair arrive? And who's that distinguished gentleman with Evelyn? Two men appeared during my five-minute ice cream break? Nathan will have my head for this!"

The mere thought of Nathan Blackwood's reaction made Teddy's knees buckle. He turned pleading eyes to Marcus. "Tell me they just arrived."

Marcus snorted. "Preston was already inside when we got here."

"Before Evelyn?!" Teddy moaned, looking skyward. The gathering storm clouds mirrored his despair.

He'd assumed Preston and his son were still at the estate when they'd left that morning. This oversight shook Teddy to his core. For the first time, he doubted his matchmaking abilities.

"No, I must salvage this!" Teddy slapped his cheeks. "If I lose Nathan's patronage, I'm finished! Who else can reunite those two stubborn lovebirds? Only Theodore Winslow possesses the necessary finesse!"

Within seconds, Teddy transformed from despondent to determined. "I'll whisk Evelyn away before Nathan finds out! Operation Love Rescue commences now!"

Marcus watched Teddy's manic mood swings with detached amusement. Definitely needs psychiatric evaluation, he thought, moving to a different vantage point to monitor Evelyn.

Teddy straightened his tie and marched toward the library doors—until his phone buzzed with a message from "Goddess Evelyn":

[Wait outside. Do NOT enter.]

His shoulders slumped. Defeated, Teddy trudged back to a bench, pressing his nose against the glass like a forlorn puppy. "So cruel," he muttered.

Inside, Evelyn slipped her phone away with an enigmatic smile. Her attention returned to Sebastian Laurent, who was passionately explaining his latest quantum physics breakthrough.

She glimpsed traces of the brilliant young professor she'd once studied under.

After an hour of enthusiastic lecturing, Sebastian paused, throat dry. His audience of two had only offered occasional nods.

"Hmph! Such disengaged students!" He tapped the table pointedly. "I have research awaiting. Don't you have places to be?"

Evelyn and Preston rose in perfect synchronization. "Goodbye, Professor." No unnecessary pleasantries—just efficient exits.

Sebastian harrumphed. "Don't come back!"

Evelyn tossed a playful glance over her shoulder, eyes sparkling with mischief. "As you wish!"
###Chapter 449 You're Ugly

Preston Sinclair glanced at Evelyn and chuckled. "You really know how to push Sebastian Laurent's buttons, don't you?"

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with amusement as she smiled. "Someone needs to keep his temper in check occasionally."

Preston nodded in agreement. As they stepped outside, Teddy Winslow rushed to greet them. "Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood was worried you might be hungry since you skipped breakfast this morning." He beamed. "A man who's attentive, kind, and wealthy—now that's a rare combination!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes and shot Teddy a warning look. "The world wouldn't miss one less of his kind." Teddy shrank back, hesitating before he cleared his throat and strategically positioned himself between Evelyn and Preston.

The trio walking together made for an odd sight—two tall, striking figures flanking a short, round obstacle in the middle.

Completely oblivious to ruining the picturesque moment, Teddy bounced along like an overexcited rabbit. "Mr. Sinclair, I didn't expect to see you here either! Ms. Sinclair, weren't you visiting your professor? What a coincidence, right? Hahaha!"

Preston remained silent, continuing forward without acknowledging him.

Evelyn swore to herself she'd never bring Teddy along again. She turned her attention to the scenery, pointedly ignoring him. Teddy's enthusiasm deflated slightly.

Then, an idea struck him. He turned to Marcus, stretching out his plump arm eagerly. "Marcus! Take a photo of us! It's not every day Ms. Sinclair visits campus—we should capture the moment!"

Marcus narrowed his eyes at Evelyn, who hesitated before nodding. "Fine."

Marcus pulled out his phone calmly. Preston lingered, debating whether to excuse himself when Evelyn called out, "Mr. Sinclair, care to join us?"

Preston lowered his gaze for a brief moment before nodding. He stepped closer, leaning slightly toward Evelyn.

Teddy's cheerful expression faltered for a second before he plastered on another grin. She's just being polite. That's all.

He stretched his arms above his head, forming a heart shape with his fingers, grinning widely. This was his moment—standing in the same frame as the legendary Goddess Evelyn Sinclair!

Separated by Teddy, Preston stood with his usual regal composure, expressionless as if facing a press conference. Marcus raised the phone but hesitated before snapping the shot. Teddy's arms trembled from the effort of holding the pose.

"Marcus, what's taking so long?" Teddy complained, his arms aching.

Marcus lowered the phone. "It's ugly."

"Ugly?!" Teddy gasped, scandalized. "How could you associate that word with Ms. Sinclair? She's flawless!"

Marcus narrowed his eyes. "You're ugly."

The air turned icy. Teddy crossed his arms indignantly. "I don't believe you!" He stomped toward Marcus, ready to argue.

Before he could reach him, Marcus suddenly lifted the phone again.

Click.

The shutter sound echoed as the photo was taken. Marcus lowered the device calmly. "Now that's a good picture."

With that, he walked past Teddy and handed the phone to Evelyn. "What do you think, Miss?"

Evelyn took it, her lips curving into a smile as she studied the image.
###Chapter 450 The Provocation

The photograph captured the misty ambiance of a light drizzle.

Preston Sinclair and Evelyn Sinclair stood without umbrellas, their hair and clothes lightly dampened by the fine spray of rain.

The background blurred softly, leaving the two figures in sharp focus.

After Teddy stormed off in a huff, a noticeable gap remained between Evelyn and Preston.

They stood with regal poise, their postures effortlessly elegant.

Their gazes met, and the warmth in their smiles illuminated the frame. The image was breathtakingly harmonious.

"Not bad, is it?" Preston stepped closer, glancing at the phone screen.

Evelyn hummed in agreement. "Mm. Even a candid shot looks good when the subjects are photogenic." She saved the picture to her own phone.

It had been a while since she last updated her social media. With a quick tap, she posted the photo with a simple caption:

A moment worth remembering.

Within seconds, Isabella and Natalie had already liked it. Even Tristan Whitmore reacted almost instantly.

Evelyn rolled her eyes and tucked her phone away, handing Marcus his device with a polite smile. Marcus accepted it wordlessly and retreated to his original position.

The brief interruption was quickly forgotten.

Teddy tried to wedge himself between the two again, but Marcus caught him by the arm.

"Let me go! I want to stand with them!" Teddy wriggled, attempting to use his bulk to break free.

Marcus tightened his grip effortlessly, immobilizing him.

"Stay here," Marcus said flatly.

"Why?" Teddy pouted.

"Because I don’t want to see that eyesore again."

As Evelyn’s bodyguard, Marcus had to walk behind her. Teddy barging into his line of sight was nothing short of torture.

Teddy huffed, crossing his arms. "I thought we were friends!"

Marcus gave him a deadpan look. "Absolutely not."

Evelyn and Preston strolled leisurely out of the campus, drawing admiring glances from passing students. Their striking looks and aristocratic bearing naturally commanded attention.

"So, Teddy was sent by Mr. Blackwood?" Preston’s tone was light, almost indifferent. "He must care for you a great deal."

Evelyn arched a brow. "My father probably asked him to tag along out of concern for my safety."

Preston chuckled. "A father’s love is indeed thoughtful."

"Though it’s unfortunate that Nathan’s carefully arranged trip was ruined by the rain. He even fell ill because of it. I suspect this outing will be cut short." Her voice was cool, detached.

Preston smirked. "Not necessarily. It seems Mr. Blackwood is quite determined to create opportunities with you."

"Pointless," Evelyn said flatly. "As long as my father is pleased, that’s all that matters."

Her tone was firm. She knew the difference between love and gratitude. Right now, all she felt toward Nathan was the latter—along with a lingering guilt.

She hoped those buried emotions would never resurface.

Preston’s sudden question didn’t irritate her. Perhaps it was because of their recent encounters, their shared connection with Sebastian Laurent.

"My apologies," Preston murmured. "I didn’t mean to upset you." His voice was as soft as the drizzle around them.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "It’s fine. Whether you bring him up or not, he still exists."

Preston studied her profile for a long moment before speaking again.

"This might be presumptuous of me, but there’s something I’ve been curious about. You don’t have to answer if it makes you uncomfortable."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Go ahead, Mr. Sinclair."

She answered only what she chose to, anyway.

"Ms. Sterling," he began, his gaze steady. "Do you still have feelings for Mr. Blackwood?"

The question was blunt, direct—because he wanted the truth.

It was the question everyone wanted answered.

Evelyn’s jaw tensed slightly. She didn’t respond immediately, but the shadows in her eyes deepened.
###Chapter 451 Send Me the Photo

Evelyn Sinclair had declared countless times that she no longer harbored feelings for Nathan Blackwood. Yet, no one truly believed her.

Did they all assume this was just another one of her dramatic episodes with Nathan?

Just as Preston Sinclair thought she wouldn’t answer his question, Evelyn laughed.

Her expression was radiant, her confidence innate. There was a spark of defiance in her gaze, a magnetic allure that couldn’t be ignored.

"If loving someone is supposed to last a lifetime, does that mean you never intend to remarry after your wife’s passing?"

Her retort was just as bold and direct as his question. But Evelyn couldn’t soften her words—not when his inquiry had made her blood boil.

Preston froze.

For a moment, he was taken aback by her sharpness. But instead of anger, a low chuckle escaped him. His lips curved into an amused smile.

"Understood."

He didn’t need to answer. They both knew the truth.

And in that moment, something unfamiliar stirred in Preston’s chest.

He hadn’t remarried because he hadn’t met the right person. With his status, he didn’t need to settle—nor did he require a marriage of convenience.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow trailed behind them, nearly dying of anxiety.

He had heard Evelyn’s response, but it made no sense to him.

What the hell does that mean?!

Why is Ms. Sinclair asking if Mr. Sinclair plans to remarry?

Is she mocking him for being widowed?

Or is she telling him to stay away from her?

Does that mean she still loves Nathan but is too proud to admit it?

That has to be it!

Inside Highland Estates, Nathan’s condition had improved.

The staff attended to him with meticulous care, not daring to slack off.

Leaning against the leather couch, his face still pale, Nathan stared at the email Harrison had sent him. His phone buzzed incessantly.

A glance confirmed it was Tristan Whitmore.

Nathan ignored it.

But Tristan was relentless.

Annoyed, Nathan slammed his laptop shut and snatched up the phone, his voice icy.

"Speak. And it better be important."

If it wasn’t, Tristan would regret this call.

Tristan hesitated, unable to hide the urgency in his voice.

"What are you doing? Did you go to France with Evelyn?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

"Yes. And I’m hanging up if this is all you have to say."

"Hmph! You ditched me for Costa Azul but went on a trip with Evelyn?! Since when do you abandon your friends for love?!"

Nathan’s fingers twitched.

"But—why the hell did Preston Sinclair go with you? I don’t get this weird dynamic between you three."

Nathan’s grip on the phone tightened.

"How do you know?"

No one had been informed of their travel plans. Preston certainly wouldn’t have announced it.

"Everyone knows! Evelyn posted a picture with Preston. You didn’t see it?"

A pause. Then, Tristan’s voice dropped.

"Oh. Right. She blocked you."

Nathan’s expression darkened.

"What photo?"

Tristan swallowed, sensing the dangerous shift in Nathan’s tone. He didn’t dare tease him now.

"Uh… it’s just the two of them. Looks like some kind of official announcement. People are speculating if they’re dating."

His voice grew quieter with each word, the chill from the other end of the line palpable.

Nathan’s fingers clenched.

"Send it to me."

"Okay, but—"

The line went dead.
###Chapter 452 Get Back Here

The photograph arrived on Nathan's phone screen. His knuckles turned white as he gripped the device, his face darkening instantly.

A dangerous glint flashed in his stormy gray eyes. The two figures captured in the drizzle looked like they belonged in some romantic film.

Their gazes held an intimacy that made Nathan's stomach churn. Unspoken understanding passed between them, their eyes filled with unmistakable familiarity and something more painful - regret. Regret for not having met sooner.

When had Evelyn grown this close to him? Nathan's jaw clenched so tight it ached. After what felt like an eternity, he dialed Teddy.

"Mr. Blackwood! Missing Ms. Sinclair already? She's doing splendidly. In fact, she mentioned she misses you too!" Teddy chirped.

Silence.

Teddy's smile faltered as the quiet stretched. When Nathan finally spoke, his voice could have frozen hell over. "Theodore Winslow. You dare lie to me? Should I arrange a permanent vacation for you in the River Aurora?"

Teddy's blood ran cold. "S-sir? What have I done wrong?"

Had Nathan discovered that Ms. Sinclair's professor was male? Or worse - that she'd met with Preston Sinclair?

Nathan's icy chuckle sent shivers down Teddy's spine. The unspoken threat hung between them like a guillotine blade. Teddy swallowed hard.

"Yes, there was a minor... development, but everything's under control! That professor who's obsessed with perfumes? Definitely not interested in women!" Teddy babbled.

Nathan's expression darkened further.

"And the other complication?" Teddy's heart stopped. So Nathan knew about Preston after all. He glanced at the retreating figures ahead - Evelyn and Preston looked like they'd stepped out of a romance novel. Even Marcus had commented on what a perfect picture they made.

Though Teddy privately thought Evelyn would look infinitely better beside Nathan. "Mr. Sinclair was... purely coincidental! But you needn't worry, sir! I've been shadowing Ms. Sinclair closely. She mentioned Mr. Sinclair's ex-wife - clearly there's bad blood between them!"

Teddy launched into an animated explanation of every interaction between Evelyn and Preston, his words tumbling over each other in his haste. By the time he finished, Nathan had grown impatient.

"Enough. Keep her safe." Nathan's voice was clipped. "And Teddy? Return soon."

The call ended abruptly. Nathan's fingers hovered over Evelyn's social media profile. Blank. Not blocked - restricted. The invisible barrier between them made his chest constrict painfully.

Meanwhile, Evelyn checked her watch. Still too early for the reunion. She decided to pick up gifts for her classmates.

At the intersection, she turned to Preston. "Mr. Sinclair, if you have other engagements, please don't let me keep you."

Preston's brow furrowed. "You're not returning to the estate?"

"I need to shop for tonight's gathering."

Understanding dawned on Preston's face. "Ah, I have a client meeting myself. Until next time." They exchanged polite farewells.

The moment Preston disappeared around the corner, Teddy materialized at Evelyn's side, unfurling an umbrella with dramatic flair. "Ms. Sinclair! We can't have the rain ruining your gorgeous hair. Where to next?"

Evelyn gave him a withering look and strode off without answering. She knew these streets intimately, her heels clicking purposefully toward the luxury mall.

Teddy practically vibrated with excitement - this was his chance to shine! He chattered nonstop about gift ideas, his enthusiasm gradually wearing down Evelyn's resistance. By the third boutique, she found herself reluctantly impressed.

The man should have been in sales, Evelyn mused. He'd make a fortune with that silver tongue.

Behind them, Marcus lumbered under an ever-growing mountain of shopping bags, his usual intimidating presence somewhat diminished by his role as pack mule. Teddy turned and snapped his fingers. "Pick up the pace, Marcus! They're just a few bags - no need to look like you're marching to your execution!"
###Chapter 453 Her New Love

Marcus's expression turned dangerously dark as he trailed behind them. His piercing glare at Teddy Winslow could have melted steel. If Teddy hadn't been walking so close to Evelyn Sinclair, Marcus would have already taught him a painful lesson.

Evelyn's phone kept buzzing incessantly with notifications. She glanced at the screen to see messages from Isabella Montgomery flooding in. [Why haven't you responded? Are you actually dating Preston Sinclair?!] Evelyn ignored the text, shocked to find over two hundred unread messages and alerts.

What in the world? Why is everyone suddenly obsessed with Preston? [Sebastian Hart: Are you really involved with Preston? Ready to become a stepmother? I only want your happiness, but perhaps you should reconsider Nathan Blackwood.] [Natalie Beaumont: Preston isn't a terrible choice, but don't take it too seriously! Older men can't compete with younger studs, right?] [Lucas Sterling: Are you abandoning your collection of admirers? The entire entertainment industry is at your feet - think carefully!] [Alexander Sterling: Money talks. What use are emotions?] [Donovan Sterling: Not only does rain increase microbial growth risks, but damp clothing provides ideal conditions for bacterial colonization. Your outfit's fabric appears particularly susceptible.] [Emily Whitaker: Wow Evelyn! You look absolutely breathtaking!] Evelyn frowned as she scrolled through the barrage of messages.

She couldn't believe the overreaction. It's just one photograph!

Coincidentally, Isabella called. Evelyn answered with practiced ease. "Evie! Do you actually have feelings for Preston Sinclair? Even if Nathan Blackwood isn't right for you, why not stay single?" Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

She arched an eyebrow and responded nonchalantly as she continued walking, "It's merely a photo! You're all making a mountain out of a molehill."

"What? So it's not true? Then why would you pose like that? I thought you were announcing your relationship just to provoke Nathan."

"There are countless ways to annoy Nathan - why would I sacrifice myself for that?" That was a valid point. Isabella nodded in agreement, visibly relaxing.

"Well, that's a relief. Everyone assumes you're dating Preston. Honestly, he's not a bad option - his qualifications rival Nathan's, except for the whole... existing child situation."

"Nothing of the sort exists, so stop this nonsense. I'll simply delete the photo to avoid further complications."

"Perfect! I'll spread the word so everyone shuts up about it!" Isabella added cheerfully, "But between us, you two look incredible together! Romantic movies couldn't create better chemistry! Preston's devastatingly handsome. He seems like decent husband material too."

Evelyn chuckled lightly. "Should I introduce him to you then?"

"Absolutely not! I could never handle a man like that."

Isabella lacked the confidence for such an endeavor. Even Evelyn with her formidable intellect had struggled with Nathan Blackwood. Isabella preferred the safety of arranged high-society marriages. "But why did you agree to travel with Nathan? His intentions are clearly less than honorable."

Evelyn explained, "Father wanted to attend and insisted I join. Besides, we have multi-billion dollar projects underway - no need for unnecessary tension." Isabella was rendered speechless.

She suddenly felt petty for focusing on romantic entanglements. How shallow! In the face of such wealth, everyone should reconcile and collaborate. Isabella realized she'd underestimated her best friend. Evelyn wouldn't fall for someone so easily. Every public appearance was a strategic business move.

She sighed. "Alright then. I see now the gap between us is vast. I need to work harder to reach your level!" Isabella consoled herself.

Evelyn replied, "Better late than never."
###Chapter 454 Scandalous Affair Exposed

Isabella Montgomery slammed the phone down without a word. What a terrible friend! Evelyn Sinclair immediately deleted the controversial post, watching as all those vicious comments vanished into digital oblivion. At last, she could breathe again.

She didn't need to explain herself to anyone. Isabella, with her notorious big mouth, would undoubtedly spread the "truth" far and wide. Yet despite this, rumors about Evelyn and Preston Sinclair's alleged romance spread uncontrollably, blazing through social media like wildfire. By dusk, tabloids screamed with headlines like "Evelyn's Secret Lover Revealed" and "The Billionaire's New Flame."

Evelyn's celebrity status was the envy of every socialite in Montecito. Anything bearing her name guaranteed viral attention. Currently abroad, she remained blissfully unaware of the storm brewing back home. By the time she learned of the scandal, it had already spiraled beyond containment.

While the entire nation speculated about her love life, Evelyn happily attended her high school reunion. Returning from the event, Isabella's call came through.

"You're trending again!" Isabella sent a screenshot. Every trending topic revolved around Evelyn's supposed new relationship. Evelyn's brow furrowed.

"I'll have Dominic Young remove those topics immediately."
"Too late, darling," Isabella replied, clearly enjoying the drama. "They're already gone."
"Who handled it?"
"Who else? Nathan Blackwood, of course! He issued orders to crush anyone daring to publish such nonsense."

Evelyn stepped inside and scrolled through the day's trending topics. Not a single trace remained of the scandal. She calmly pocketed her phone just as Theodore "Teddy" Winslow approached, looking utterly miserable.

"What's wrong with you?" Evelyn asked. Teddy appeared completely drained.
"Mr. Blackwood's condition has worsened. He can't even keep food down now. I'm terrified he might not recover."

Evelyn's expression darkened. "Worsened? How?"
Teddy sighed heavily before meeting her gaze.

"Ms. Sinclair, have you seen what's happening in Montecito? Someone posted that photo of you and Mr. Sinclair online, twisting your professional relationship into something sordid. It's downright character assassination!"

"Clearly someone wants to sabotage our business partnership," Evelyn remarked.
Teddy huffed indignantly, his round face flushing. "When I saw it, I was furious—and it's not even my concern!"

Evelyn studied him curiously as Teddy continued fuming like an overgrown bullfrog.
"I already know about the rumors."
Teddy sighed again. "Then you must be furious. Those vultures speculated about your private life without restraint. Mr. Blackwood feared you'd be upset—that Sterling Corporation's stocks might plummet—so he immediately used his influence to suppress the stories."

"Mr. Blackwood is so thoughtful! A true gentleman," Teddy gushed before adding, "Would you check on him? Maybe bring some chicken soup?"
"Fine."
Teddy's eyes lit up, and he scurried away before she could change her mind.

If Teddy failed this mission, Nathan would undoubtedly toss him into the River Aurora without hesitation. Evelyn approached Nathan's suite and knocked calmly. No answer. She turned to leave when the door suddenly swung open.

Nathan stood there, his face alarmingly pale as he leaned heavily on his cane. His lips were bloodless. In his other hand, he held an IV bag, the tube snaking into his arm. Every movement seemed to cost him tremendous effort. Evelyn froze, momentarily stunned by his deteriorated state.
###Chapter 455 Pure Friendship ASG

Evelyn instinctively reached out to steady Nathan's IV drip.

The needle in his right hand was slipping, tiny crimson droplets forming at the puncture site. Nathan's complexion looked ghostly pale, his usually full lips pressed into a thin, bloodless line. Yet his eyes brightened noticeably when they landed on her.

"Evelyn..." His voice came out hoarse as he tried to sit up, only to collapse back against the pillows. She remained frozen in the doorway, watching his struggle to rehang the IV bag himself before finally stepping forward to assist.

Her gaze swept over him clinically. "Mr. Blackwood, how are you feeling?" Nathan's lips twitched into a weak smile. "Better now that you're here. You didn't catch a chill last night, did you?" Even his normally rich baritone sounded strained.

There was something heartbreakingly vulnerable in the way he looked at her. "No." Evelyn's pulse stuttered despite herself. She moved to the chair opposite his bed with deliberate nonchalance.

Theodore entered bearing a steaming bowl, his expression sympathetic. "Mr. Blackwood, you must regain your strength. Ms. Sinclair was quite moved when she learned what you did for her. She's been wanting to express her gratitude properly." He shot Evelyn a meaningful glance. "It's impossible not to admire such a remarkable man!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Theodore's blatant matchmaking. The earlier tension dissipated instantly. Theodore winked conspiratorially, clearly playing up the situation for the patient's benefit.

Pursing her lips, Evelyn met Nathan's expectant gaze. "I heard you had the trending topics removed. Thank you." Her words came out stiffer than intended.

Nathan's smile softened. "You're welcome." Theodore hastily passed the bowl to Evelyn and made a strategic exit.

Nathan eyed the soup, then raised his trembling, needle-pierced hand with obvious difficulty. Evelyn frowned. Despite his weakened state, his expression remained composed, though she detected a glimmer of hope in his eyes.

Seeing the typically formidable Nathan Blackwood reduced to such frailty stirred unexpected tenderness in her chest. He'd been injured because of her, after all. The least she could do was show basic courtesy.

She held out the bowl with the spoon, maintaining what little distance remained between them. This was already pushing her boundaries. Nathan calmly displayed his other hand - equally marred by IV punctures. "No strength," he admitted quietly, the admission clearly costing him pride.

Evelyn hesitated. Just as Nathan thought she might relent and feed him herself, she called toward the door, "Marcus!" The ensuing silence lasted just a beat too long. Nathan's jaw tightened visibly, his chest rising with a sharp inhale. He knew exactly what was coming.

Absolutely not. He'd rather collapse from hunger.

The next instant, Marcus materialized, his usual stoic expression in place. "Yes, Miss Sinclair?"

"Please assist Mr. Blackwood with his soup." Her tone brooked no argument.

Marcus's brows drew together fractionally, but he accepted the bowl without protest. Better him than Evelyn having to endure Nathan's proximity. "At once, Miss." His response rang with military precision.

Before Marcus could take the vacated seat, Nathan snatched the bowl with sudden vigor, downing its contents in several large gulps. His glare could have frozen lava. "Out!" he barked at Marcus, the command laced with barely restrained fury.
###Chapter 456 Happy to Help

Marcus glanced at Evelyn, who arched an eyebrow and gave a subtle nod. Without hesitation, Marcus stepped out, leaving Evelyn and Nathan alone in the sterile hospital room.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension. Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Since you've finished your meal, I'll take the tray. Get some rest." She rose gracefully, preparing to make her exit.

She missed the way Nathan's piercing gaze darkened with a fleeting look of wounded pride before his expression smoothed into its usual impassive mask.

Nathan's voice emerged rough with emotion, stopping her mid-step. "Evelyn."

She turned, meeting his stormy eyes. "Yes?"

"Why did you post that photo?" His jaw clenched, lips pressed into a thin line. The intensity in his obsidian eyes betrayed the calmness of his question.

Evelyn tossed her hair over one shoulder, her smile turning deliberately provocative. "Because he's my new lover." The lie rolled easily off her tongue, meant to sever whatever lingering connection remained between them.

Nathan paled visibly. Raw pain flashed across his features before he schooled them again. His hands fisted at his sides, knuckles whitening with the effort to maintain control.

The weight of her words crushed him. Each breath became a struggle against the invisible vise tightening around his chest. The corners of his eyes reddened, betraying the devastation he fought to conceal.

He had no right to protest. He'd been the one to push her away. The bitter taste of regret coated his tongue as he watched her prepare to leave again.

The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating. Evelyn spoke lightly, as if discussing the weather. "We both knew this day would come. New people, new lives. You should prepare yourself, Mr. Blackwood."

With that final dismissal, she walked out without looking back. The door clicked shut behind her with finality.

Evelyn exhaled shakily, only to freeze when she spotted Preston Sinclair leaning casually against the opposite wall. His presence suggested he'd been waiting - and listening - for some time.

Guilt twisted her stomach. Their eyes met, and the air between them shifted with unspoken understanding.

Preston broke the silence first, his voice warm yet measured. "I came to say goodbye to Nathan before my early departure. When I heard voices, I thought I'd wait out here."

Evelyn bit her lip, scrambling for an explanation. "I'm so sorry about that photo. What I said in there was just...a convenient excuse." Her words tumbled out in a rush.

Preston's lips quirked in an unexpected smile. "It's quite alright. I'm happy to help." His tone held none of his usual aristocratic chill.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "What?"

Meeting her gaze squarely, Preston radiated quiet confidence. The combination of his noble bearing and unexpected kindness created an intoxicating aura. "If playing the role of your lover helps you avoid unwanted complications, consider me at your service." His eyes twinkled with quiet amusement. "After all, you did save Oliver's life."

Relief washed over Evelyn as understanding dawned. He'd seen right through her ploy. The tension in her shoulders eased as she chuckled. "Thank you for not being angry."

"Angry?" Preston's expression turned playfully serious. "On the contrary. Should you require an acting partner again, I'd be honored to reprise my role."
###Chapter 457 Just a Fling

Evelyn lowered her lashes. No. I can't involve you in my mess just because I'm being selfish.

She knew perfectly well that Nathan wouldn't believe a mere photograph.

His earlier anger had been nothing more than a momentary lapse in judgment.

Evelyn forced a smile and withdrew her gaze. "Goodnight, Mr. Blackwood."

"Goodnight," he replied stiffly.

She retreated to her room, the weight of unspoken words pressing against her ribs.

After a long shower, she changed into silk pajamas just as her father summoned her for a family video call.

William Sterling had business matters to discuss with her.

By the time they finished, the furrow between his brows hadn't eased.

Then Lucas popped onto the screen, eyes gleaming with mischief. "Tell me you're not actually dating Preston Sinclair!"

Evelyn groaned. Of course Lucas, the family's biggest gossip, would latch onto that rumor.

"Absolutely not," she deadpanned.

Lucas exhaled dramatically. "Thank God. Have your fun, but don't get attached. If you do, I'm staging an intervention."

William surprised her by nodding. "He's right."

It was rare for her father to agree with Lucas. Their protectiveness stemmed from the way she'd diminished herself during her marriage to Nathan. To them, no man would ever be worthy.

Donovan ended the call abruptly.

William cleared his throat. "Ignore them, sweetheart. Date whoever you want—rich, poor, I don't care."

He winked. "It's not like we can't afford heartbreak, right?"

Evelyn burst out laughing. "True, but I'd rather focus on making money. With enough cash, I can have any man I want!"

William nodded sagely. "That's my girl."

Still chuckling, she returned to bed.

The next morning, Nathan's meticulous planning became evident.

Since Preston wasn't leaving until afternoon, they had half a day to explore Venice together.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the piazza, romance clung to the air like perfume.

Time seemed suspended in the 19th century—no cars, just gondolas gliding through turquoise canals.

William and Preston wandered ahead, engrossed in conversation.

Meanwhile, Oliver Sinclair clung to Evelyn's hand like an excited puppy. This trip with his "favorite muse" was a memory he'd cherish forever.

Theodore nudged Nathan, who was grinding his teeth at the sight of Evelyn and Oliver's linked fingers.

Nathan forced a smile, though internally he ranked Oliver just as irritating as Preston.

Spotting a vendor, Theodore darted off and returned with a cloud of pink cotton candy.

He thrust it at Nathan.

"I don't eat sugar," Nathan hissed.

Theodore's smile turned pained. "It's for Ms. Sinclair, sir. Thought you might want to... you know."

Give it to her yourself hung unspoken in the air.

Nathan snatched it with a scowl.

Theodore wisely refrained from comment and called out, "Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood saw this and thought you'd like it!"

He added hastily, "He knows ladies watch their sugar intake, but he hopes you'll stay as sweet as this candy every day."

Evelyn turned, one eyebrow arched. Nathan stood frozen, cotton candy held out like a peace offering—or a surrender.
###Chapter 458 You Don't Stand a Chance

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow beamed brightly, spinning his web of lies effortlessly. Evelyn Sinclair glanced at Nathan Blackwood, who lifted the cotton candy in his hand. His gaze held a warmth that seemed to reach her soul.

"Do you... like it?" Nathan asked softly. Evelyn blinked in surprise. Cotton candy? Since when did the sophisticated Nathan Blackwood indulge in such childish treats? Before she could respond, little Oliver Sinclair came bounding over excitedly.

"I want it! I want it!" The crowd froze as the boy snatched the cotton candy and took an enthusiastic bite. "Oww! It's too sweet!" Oliver clutched his cheek dramatically before burying his face in Evelyn's skirt. "Muse, my tooth hurts!"

Nathan forced himself to maintain composure, though irritation flickered in his eyes. "You should be more careful," he said through gritted teeth. He couldn't afford to alienate anyone close to Evelyn now.

Evelyn smoothed Oliver's golden curls knowingly. She saw through Nathan's act but chose not to call him out. "Then don't eat it, sweetheart." Oliver nodded vigorously. "Only babies eat candy anyway. Meanie Nathan is being silly."

"Muse, I'll make you cotton candy from real gold! Then you can keep it forever!" Oliver declared proudly. At least he wasn't as cheap as that horrible Nathan Blackwood. Evelyn nearly choked. "No, darling, I don't need that." Raising this little prince would bankrupt an ordinary person.

As Evelyn turned to fetch Oliver's water bottle, Nathan studied the boy's face with amusement. "You like Evelyn very much, don't you?" "Yeah! So what?" Oliver crossed his arms like a miniature adult. Nathan's smile turned sly. "Congratulations then. When your father marries her, you'll officially be her son."

Oliver's face contorted in horror. "WHAT?!" His tiny hands balled into fists. Nathan raised an eyebrow. "You didn't know? Preston's courting her." Just then, Preston Sinclair approached holding another colorful cloud of spun sugar.

Evelyn turned and stared in bewilderment. Why was everyone obsessed with cotton candy today? Preston smiled warmly at her while giving his son a pointed look. "Ms. Sinclair, I saw Oliver ruined Mr. Blackwood's gift. Please accept this as replacement." He offered the treat to Evelyn.

Nathan's eyes narrowed slightly but he remained composed. Meanwhile, Oliver snatched the cotton candy from his father's hand, glaring daggers. "Daddy! Muse doesn't like cotton candy!" His cheeks flushed crimson with outrage.

The clever boy put two and two together. Was Nathan telling the truth? Was Daddy really trying to steal his Muse? Unacceptable! She belonged to him alone! Not even Daddy could have her!

With sudden inspiration, Oliver thrust the candy at Nathan. "Here. You take it." Better the enemy he knew than the one he didn't. At least he was certain Evelyn didn't care for Nathan.

Preston's smile never wavered, though confusion flickered in his eyes as he met his son's furious gaze. Oliver pouted. First he had to compete with Nathan, and now his own father? When he inherited the Sinclair empire, he'd claim his Muse properly. Why couldn't Daddy understand she was his?
###Chapter 459 There's a Party

Oliver Sinclair thought fiercely, No one can take my Muse away, not even Father!

When Nathan Blackwood saw the boy's protective stance, a warm, indulgent smile curved his lips.

Strangely, Nathan found Oliver less irritating than usual.

"Mr. Sinclair, don't be upset. Your son takes after you," Teddy Winslow remarked dryly.

Before Preston Sinclair could respond, Oliver grabbed Evelyn Sinclair's hand and stormed off in a huff.

Evelyn let the boy drag her to a quiet corner of the hotel lobby, where he finally stopped, cheeks flushed.

"Muse," Oliver panted, blinking his sapphire-blue eyes innocently, "Out of the three of us, who treats you the best?"

Evelyn blinked. Three? Oliver, Nathan, and Preston? Men?

She bit back a laugh at the absurdity but humored him. "Of course it's you, sweetheart."

Oliver beamed, puffing his chest proudly. "I knew it! Those two are old, grumpy, and boring. They can't compete with me!"

Evelyn nodded solemnly. "Absolutely right."

Oliver shyly took her hand. "Then... wait for me to grow up. We'll be together forever!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh, pinching his soft cheek. "Alright, I'll wait."

Oliver threw his arms around her, nuzzling into her palm like an affectionate kitten.

Later, Evelyn led him back to the group as if nothing had happened.

William Sterling was thoroughly enjoying the trip. After Preston left that afternoon, Evelyn suggested changing destinations.

"Costa Azul," she declared.

No one objected. They departed the same day.

Costa Azul was perfect for surfing, but Evelyn's mood soured whenever Nathan and Teddy were nearby.

The next evening, a cool breeze swept through the resort.

Nathan owned the hotel they were staying at, so it had been cleared out before their arrival. William went to mingle with locals while the others stayed behind.

Evelyn stepped out of the elevator in a soft apricot sundress, radiant under the golden lobby lights.

Nathan was in the lounge, reviewing quarterly reports with the manager. His gaze snapped up when he saw her.

"Going out?" he asked.

Evelyn nodded. "There's a party."

She walked toward the entrance without another word. Nathan's lips thinned.

Before he could ask where, a sleek Porsche pulled up.

The driver stepped out—Preston Sinclair.

Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. He wheeled himself forward just as Preston opened the car door for Evelyn like a perfect gentleman.

Preston paused when he noticed Nathan. "Mr. Blackwood."

Though seated, Nathan's presence was no less commanding. His voice was ice. "Mr. Sinclair. What a... coincidence."

First he leaves, now he's back? Nathan thought irritably. Preston had always been a wild card, capable of ruining his mood instantly.

A sudden gust of wind tore Evelyn's silk scarf from her shoulders, sending it fluttering to Nathan's feet.

He bent to retrieve it—just as Preston grabbed the other end.

Their eyes met, a silent battle of wills.

Neither let go.

The air between them crackled with tension.
###Chapter 460 Departure With Him

Evelyn Sinclair turned her head, her expression unreadable as she approached. With deliberate movements, she snatched the silk scarf from the hands of the two men.

The tension in the air was suffocating. She shattered it with a single word. "Let's go."

Evelyn slid into the car without hesitation. Preston Sinclair remained standing, his posture rigid as he shot Nathan Blackwood a frosty glare. "Goodbye, Mr. Blackwood."

His gaze lingered on Nathan, deliberately ignoring the icy aura radiating from him. Without another word, Preston circled the car, took the driver's seat, and started the engine.

Nathan sat motionless, his sharp eyes narrowing dangerously.

How could he remain indifferent when someone dared to take what was his?

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow descended the steps and spotted Nathan sitting alone at the grand entrance. He rushed over immediately.

"Mr. Blackwood, have you seen Ms. Sinclair?"

Nathan remained silent.

After what felt like an eternity, he finally spoke, his voice devoid of emotion. "Find out what event is happening in the social circle tonight."

The party Preston and Evelyn attended together wouldn’t be some obscure gathering. There was no way Nathan wouldn’t uncover it.

Teddy hesitated for a moment before pulling out his phone to check the schedule Harrison had sent him.

A few seconds later, Teddy spoke hesitantly. "It's Young Master Whitmore's birthday celebration. You declined his invitation earlier."

Nathan frowned.

Teddy continued cautiously. "I heard Young Master Whitmore invited numerous high-profile guests. It's a lavish affair. Would you like to attend?"

He wasn’t hopeful—Nathan never wasted time on trivial events.

To his surprise, Nathan paused, then nodded. "Arrange it."

Teddy blinked in shock but didn’t dare delay. He immediately signaled the driver.

During the ride, Teddy wanted to ask about Evelyn’s whereabouts but thought better of it.

Soon, they arrived at an extravagant beachfront villa. The sounds of laughter and music spilled out from within.

When Tristan Whitmore learned of Nathan’s arrival, he dashed to the entrance in excitement.

The moment he saw Nathan, Tristan’s face lit up, and he pulled him into a bear hug. "Brother! I knew you’d come! You’re still recovering, yet you made time for my birthday. I must mean the world to you!"

His voice trembled with emotion, his eyes glistening.

Nathan’s expression remained impassive. Teddy quickly intervened, prying Tristan off.

"Young Master Whitmore, there are plenty of guests here. No need for such enthusiasm among close friends."

Tristan, still moved, nodded vigorously.

Nathan’s gaze swept the room. "Is Evelyn here?"

Tristan froze.

His expression turned complicated. "You didn’t come for my birthday?"

The realization hit him like a wave, and his excitement deflated.

"Evelyn?"

A familiar voice cut through the air.

Nathan turned to see Evelyn standing behind him, her eyes wide with surprise.

Tristan whirled around. "When did you get here?"

His wounded expression made him look like a jilted lover.

As other guests began closing in to greet Nathan, Teddy swiftly maneuvered him inside.

"Young Master Whitmore, Mr. Blackwood came specifically for you! He cleared his schedule just to celebrate your birthday. Running into Ms. Sinclair was pure coincidence—no, fate!"

Teddy glanced meaningfully at Evelyn. "Definitely fate."

Evelyn rolled her eyes and stepped forward. "Enough. The whole room can hear you."

Nathan’s mood visibly improved at the sight of Evelyn standing alone. The coldness in his eyes melted into something softer, his gaze lingering on her.

"Mm. Fate."

Tristan, still pouting, sidled up to Nathan.

"So you really came for me?"
###Chapter 461 Plastic Brotherhood

Nathan didn't even glance at Tristan. His gaze remained fixed on Evelyn with a knowing smile. "What a pleasant surprise, Evelyn."

He gestured to his wheelchair. "Why don't you push me? I'll introduce you to Chairman Ashford."

Evelyn hesitated for only a moment before nodding. The Ashford Group was notoriously selective in their partnerships. Reginald Ashford only worked with close associates, and his influence in Montecito was unparalleled.

Though less known internationally, his control over two major diamond mines made him a force in the industry. A partnership with Ashford could propel Sterling Corporation forward.

Nathan's lips curved.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow stepped back with an amused sigh. "Mr. Blackwood always has his methods."

Tristan scoffed, his expression darkening. "You're not even here for me." He turned sharply and stormed off.

Teddy shook his head. "Plastic friendships." When Evelyn was involved, everyone else became an afterthought.

Evelyn guided Nathan through the crowd, exchanging polite greetings. Though no one openly stared, curious glances followed them. Nathan scanned the room and spotted Preston Sinclair surrounded by admirers—no chance of escape.

When Preston noticed Nathan, surprise flickered across his face before vanishing.

Nathan smirked, cold amusement in his eyes. Blackwood Enterprises had maintained ties with Ashford Group for years.

Reginald Ashford, a man in his fifties with silver-streaked hair, brightened at the sight of Nathan. "Nathan! It's been too long." He clapped Nathan's shoulder. "I wanted to visit after hearing about your accident, but business kept me tied up."

Evelyn nearly laughed at the older man calling Nathan "brother."

Nathan waved it off. "Nothing serious. Don't trouble yourself."

Reginald's attention shifted to Evelyn. "Ah, Evelyn Sterling. CEO of Sterling Corporation and William Sterling's treasured daughter."

Evelyn offered a polite handshake. "Chairman Ashford."

Reginald exhaled dramatically. "So you're the ex-wife? I've heard stories." His grin was too knowing. "Didn't expect you two to remain so... close after the divorce."

Evelyn's expression remained neutral, but irritation simmered beneath.

Nathan's jaw tightened slightly before he chuckled. "We're on good terms."

"Smart," Reginald said, nodding sagely. "This world is small. Better to keep allies than enemies." His tone carried an unspoken implication that made Evelyn's interest in collaboration wane.

Then Reginald beckoned someone over. "Victoria! Come here."

A young woman in an extravagant gown hurried forward. Her delicate features contrasted sharply with her opulent attire—clearly wealthy, but not tastelessly so.

"This is Nathan Blackwood," Reginald announced proudly. "The man I've told you about. Brilliant, accomplished. Didn't you always want to meet him?"

He shot his youngest daughter a pointed look.

Victoria Ashford lowered her lashes, cheeks pink, and dipped into a slight bow. "Mr. Blackwood."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. Now she understood Reginald's earlier comments.

He was auditioning his daughter for the role of the next Mrs. Blackwood.

Nathan acknowledged her with a detached nod, his attention already elsewhere.
###Chapter 462 Hidden Agendas

Reginald Ashford flashed a practiced smile. "Nathan, allow me to introduce my youngest daughter Victoria. She's been raised in Europe, so she's rather reserved—this being her first society event. Do be gentle with her." Nathan Blackwood responded with a polite but distant nod.

Evelyn Sinclair studied Victoria Ashford carefully. The girl's mannerisms betrayed none of the sophistication expected from European upbringing. Noticing Evelyn's scrutiny, Victoria offered a nervous smile before lowering her gaze.

Recognizing the father-daughter duo's intentions, Evelyn saw no reason to linger. She gave Nathan's shoulder an affectionate pat. "Mr. Blackwood, I'll leave you to your conversation. I should find some refreshments." Before Nathan could protest, Reginald boomed with laughter. "Enjoy yourself, Ms. Sinclair."

With a serene smile, Evelyn turned away.

The exchange hadn't gone unnoticed. To onlookers, Evelyn's retreating figure appeared heartbreakingly solitary, stirring whispers of sympathy. Selecting a slice of cake, she settled into a quiet corner—only for Preston Sinclair to join her moments later.

Loosening his tie with a weary sigh, Preston appeared genuinely contrite. "My apologies for abandoning you after bringing you here."

Evelyn waved off his concern gracefully. "Mr. Sinclair, you've just returned to Montecito. Naturally, everyone wants a piece of your time. It's completely understandable."

Having consumed considerable wine earlier, Preston now sipped sparkling water. "Nathan's here?" His gaze drifted toward the other man and froze. "Ashford Group?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, impressed. "You recognize Reginald Ashford after just returning?"

Preston chuckled darkly. "I studied Western Montecito's investment landscape. Chairman Ashford hoards his mining assets like a dragon guarding treasure—hardly progressive." Evelyn nodded in agreement.

"I heard he has a daughter named Penelope?" Evelyn shook her head. "The one with him is Victoria. Claims she was raised abroad." Preston crossed his legs with a derisive snort.

His commanding presence seemed to shrink the space around them. "Who's he fooling? That's clearly his bastard child. Only dared acknowledge her after his wife's passing."

Evelyn's admiration grew. Who knew Wall Street's golden boy kept such scandalous tabs? Rivaling even Lucas's gossip prowess. This explained Victoria's awkwardness among society's elite.

Preston cleared his throat. "Business intelligence requires knowing players'... vulnerabilities." Their eyes met—his gleaming with shared amusement, hers sparkling with newfound respect. The moment stretched, their proximity appearing intimate to observers.

Was the online rumor mill correct about Preston being Evelyn's new romantic interest? The scene burned in Nathan's vision from across the room. Reginald had strategically left Victoria to charm Nathan alone. The girl trembled with nervous excitement—twenty years as an unacknowledged heir finally over.

The day Reginald's wife died became Victoria's rebirth. No longer would she endure servants' sneers or live in Penelope's shadow at Aspen Lodge. Marrying Nathan Blackwood would erase the stain of illegitimacy forever.

Reginald had been brutally clear: Victoria only gained recognition because the Blackwoods sought marriage alliances among elite families. With Penelope already wed, Victoria became suddenly useful. Though resentful, Victoria recognized this as her sole opportunity.

Stealing a glance at Nathan, she marveled at the man who seemed carved from marble—the untouchable tycoon from magazine spreads now within reach. Biting her lip, Victoria gathered her courage and stepped forward.
###Chapter 463 Give Up

Victoria Ashford smiled sweetly. "Mr. Blackwood, it's such a pleasure to finally meet you." She had recognized the stunning woman from earlier—the one who outshone even Hollywood starlets—as Nathan Blackwood's ex-wife. Evelyn Sinclair was even more breathtaking in person than in photographs.

Though tabloids buzzed with rumors about Nathan and Victoria's supposed entanglement, Evelyn seemed unfazed. After all, they were divorced now. While Victoria couldn't compete with Evelyn's sterling family background, she believed her willingness to submit would win Nathan over. Powerful women, in her experience, intimidated most men.

Nathan didn't acknowledge Victoria's greeting. His icy gaze remained fixed across the room where Evelyn stood conversing with Preston Sinclair.

Biting her lip, Victoria stepped closer to his wheelchair. "Shall I take you somewhere more comfortable to rest?" Her hand hovered inches from the armrest.

"Don't touch me." Nathan's voice could have frozen the champagne fountain.

No one would erase Evelyn's presence from where she'd last touched his chair—especially not this opportunistic socialite. Victoria's cheeks burned with humiliation.

"My apologies." She withdrew her hand but didn't retreat. "Perhaps I could fetch you some refreshments instead?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Unnecessary." He tolerated Reginald Ashford as a business associate, but had no patience for the man's scheming daughter—particularly after her earlier disrespect toward Evelyn.

His phone vibrated with an incoming call from the Blackwood patriarch. Nathan's glacial stare sent Victoria scrambling backward several paces.

"Grandfather." Nathan's greeting held no warmth.

"Have you made any progress with Evelyn Sinclair?" The old man's raspy voice crackled with impatience.

Nathan's grip tightened on the phone. "What concern is that of yours?"

A derisive snort came through the line. "You've neglected corporate affairs long enough chasing that woman. If this fools errand continues yielding nothing, cut your losses. The Sterling family isn't our only option for an alliance. Must we become the laughingstock of Montecito?"

Frost crystallized in Nathan's voice. "I won't abandon her." He'd burn his entire fortune to ashes before relinquishing Evelyn.

"Have you lost all sense?" The old man's temper flared. "How much longer will you humiliate yourself?"

"Is there anything else?" Nathan's tone could have shattered glass.

"Mark my words—I won't let Ferguson Corporation crumble over some woman! I've already begun vetting suitable matches. The Ashford Group chairman reached out this morning—his daughter was educated abroad and comes from respectable stock. I'll arrange—"

"Nathan wants no one but Evelyn!" The declaration sliced through his grandfather's tirade.

"You stubborn fool! That Sinclair witch has—"

Nathan ended the call with a decisive click, his stormy gaze finding Evelyn across the crowded ballroom. Let the old man scheme all he wanted. No power on earth could sever the bond between him and Evelyn—not even the formidable William Sterling himself.
###Chapter 464 Inordinate Ambition

Old Master Blackwood's voice crackled through the phone. "Stop wasting your time on Evelyn Sinclair."

His words carried the weight of finality. "She's constantly embroiled in scandals with male celebrities, and now this affair with Preston Sinclair."

"What respectable family would accept a woman with more scandals than you? If she marries into our family, how could we ever command respect?" Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze shifted to Victoria Ashford, who stood meekly nearby.

The icy glare he gave her felt like a dagger to the heart. Victoria fidgeted nervously, unsure what she'd done wrong.

She tried to meet his eyes, but he'd already looked away. Was that disappointment or anger she'd glimpsed? Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line, his expression darkening. "If you want a marriage alliance, marry her yourself."

"Evelyn is my only choice." With that, Nathan ended the call, radiating an aura so cold it could freeze hell itself.

The crowd of well-wishers who'd been waiting to greet him suddenly found other places to be. Seeing the call had ended, Victoria Ashford timidly approached again.

She studied his face carefully before speaking in a soft, trembling voice. "Mr. Blackwood, would you like a drink?"

Nathan turned his head slightly, his voice dripping with frost. "Go tell Reginald Ashford not to pin his hopes on me."

Victoria blinked rapidly, confusion written across her delicate features. "I-I don't understand what you mean."

Nathan lifted his chin, locking eyes with her. The glacial contempt in his gaze made Victoria physically recoil. "Inordinate ambition." That was all he said before turning away, having seen straight through Victoria Ashford's transparent scheming.

The verbal slap stung worse than any physical blow. Her cheeks burned with humiliation, yet there was nowhere to hide. To Victoria, Nathan represented everything she coveted. Tears welled up instantly as she turned and fled the scene.

Onlookers whispered among themselves. Initially, they'd pitied Evelyn, but now their sympathy shifted to the "poor innocent girl."

Evelyn remained blissfully unaware of Nathan's movements. She'd been chatting with Preston Sinclair before circulating among other guests. The event was filled with familiar faces, making socializing effortless.

After several glasses of wine, Evelyn felt pleasantly warm and excused herself for some air. She smiled at Preston. "I'll be right back - just need to freshen up." Preston nodded gallantly and pointed down the grand hallway.

"Restrooms are at the far end."

"Thanks." Evelyn's heels clicked rhythmically against the marble floors. As she rounded a corner, the sound of muffled sobs reached her ears.

"What are you crying about?" A shrill female voice cut through the air, laced with cruel amusement. "Nathan Blackwood wouldn't look at you twice even if you were the last woman on earth. You're utterly pathetic!"

The speaker was none other than Victoria's half-sister, Penelope Ashford. If Penelope hadn't already married into the Montgomery family, this illegitimate sister wouldn't have stood a chance with Nathan.

Though Penelope berated Victoria mercilessly, her tone betrayed secret delight that Nathan showed Victoria no interest. Evelyn paused, frowning at the unpleasant scene.

Seeing no alternative route, Evelyn continued walking openly - she had nothing to hide. She found two strikingly similar women engaged in what appeared to be a regular occurrence.

Evelyn waited politely for them to notice her and leave, but they remained oblivious. Victoria bit her quivering lip, tears streaming down her face.

Penelope crossed her arms before suddenly pinching Victoria's waist viciously. Victoria didn't even flinch, accustomed to such treatment. She made no move to defend herself.

Still unaware of Evelyn's presence, the sisters continued their twisted dynamic. Evelyn watched helplessly - she hadn't meant to intrude.

"I'll try harder," Victoria whimpered.

Penelope sneered. "A gutter rat like you could wear the crown jewels and still look common. No wonder Nathan Blackwood can't stand the sight of you."

Her voice dripped with venom. "A homewrecker's bastard like you doesn't deserve daylight, let alone the Ashford name."
###Chapter 465 Steal His Heart

Victoria Ashford lowered her gaze, her cheeks burning crimson. M-Mr. Blackwood is in love with Ms. Sinclair. I can't compete.

How could Victoria ever measure up to Evelyn Sinclair? She was nothing but a speck of dirt compared to Evelyn's radiant brilliance. Penelope Ashford let out a cruel laugh.

Can't help it? Didn't your whore of a mother teach you any tricks before she died? If he won't love you willingly, then steal his affection! Penelope shoved Victoria violently against the wall.

The dull thud of Victoria's head hitting the marble echoed through the hallway. What a pathetic sight. Evelyn observed the scene with fleeting pity before hardening her heart.

Not my problem, she thought. A shrill scream pierced the air moments later.

My dress! Penelope's eyes glittered with malice as she grabbed a janitor's bucket filled with filthy mop water and dumped it over Victoria's head. The cruel satisfaction on Penelope's face was unmistakable.

Victoria stood trembling, her designer gown ruined, dirty water dripping from her hair. She hugged herself against the wall, her quiet sobs making her appear even more pitiful.

How can I face anyone like this? Tristan Whitmore's birthday gala was attended by New York's elite - socialites and heirs to fortunes.

Appearing in this wretched state would make her the laughingstock of high society forever. Penelope's high-pitched cackle cut through the air like broken glass.

Why don't you go beg Nathan Blackwood for help? Isn't this your golden opportunity? Penelope had her trapped like a cornered animal.

Evelyn hesitated, torn between walking away and intervening, when she spotted Nathan across the ballroom. He was deep in conversation with Tristan, looking effortlessly handsome in his tuxedo.

Fine. I'll throw the poor girl a lifeline. Evelyn caught Nathan's attention with a wave. "Nathan Blackwood, someone needs you over here." The moment Nathan saw Evelyn, Tristan ceased to exist.

He immediately turned his wheelchair toward her. Tristan rolled his eyes dramatically. "Again? Really?" He followed behind, pushing Nathan's chair out of curiosity.

What could Evelyn possibly want with Nathan? When Evelyn spoke, the Ashford sisters froze mid-argument. She made no effort to hide her presence as she retreated down the corridor. Nathan's expression softened instantly.

"You wanted to see me?" Evelyn shook her head and gestured vaguely down the hall. "Not me. That person does." With that, she strode away in her stilettos. She'd done her good deed for the day.

Both men watched Evelyn's retreating figure in confusion. Nathan shot Tristan a look, signaling him to investigate. "What the hell's going on back there?" Tristan was equally curious.

They rounded the corner to find a drenched, shivering woman curled into a ball on the floor.

Her designer dress was ruined, her makeup streaked with tears. She looked up at them with swollen, pleading eyes - a drowned rat of a socialite.

The empty bathroom hallway offered no witnesses. Such a scene at Tristan's prestigious event was unacceptable. Tristan gaped before turning to Nathan. "Blackwood, Evelyn just left from here. You don't think she...?"

Nathan's face darkened with anger.

He recognized Victoria Ashford immediately, though he couldn't care less about her predicament. What infuriated him was Evelyn directing him to this pathetic scene.

What does any of this have to do with me? Neither man moved to help. Tristan was married - no reason to get involved with a soaking wet woman.

Nathan simply couldn't be bothered. The silence stretched for an excruciating minute. Victoria's tear-filled eyes locked onto Nathan's. "Please...help me..."
###Chapter 466 Strangers at the Gala

Victoria Ashford stood trembling in her soaked dress, her pitiful appearance almost unbearable to witness.

The air grew heavy with silence. Tristan Whitmore exhaled in relief. At least Nathan's anger wasn't directed at me.

Nathan Blackwood's gaze was icy, his attention deliberately avoiding the drenched woman. His lips pressed into a thin, tense line.

Though his expression remained cold, a trace of sorrow flickered in his eyes.

His thoughts were clearly elsewhere - with a certain someone who wasn't present. The grand ballroom buzzed with laughter, oblivious to the unfolding drama. Tristan discreetly touched Nathan's shoulder, uncertain how to handle the situation.

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly. Tristan cleared his throat. "Preston, perhaps you should..."

Victoria's sobs grew louder as she stared pleadingly at Nathan.

Nathan's voice cut through the air like winter frost. "This is your event. Handle it yourself."

Tristan froze. "But she was just with you—"

A warning glare from Nathan silenced him. "We're strangers." With that, Nathan wheeled himself away without another glance, leaving them behind.

Tristan stood rooted to the spot, momentarily at a loss. Victoria's cries intensified. "Could you... lend me a jacket? I need to dry off."

"Right. There's a private room upstairs you can use." Tristan scanned the room unsuccessfully for staff before reluctantly removing his suit jacket. He stayed at a safe distance as he tossed it toward her, wary of getting entangled with this clearly manipulative woman.

Across the room, Evelyn Sinclair leaned close to Preston Sinclair, discussing their upcoming project in hushed tones.

Preston clinked his glass gently against hers. "Mr. Blackwood is heading this way," he murmured.

Evelyn glanced up to see Nathan approaching alone in his wheelchair. Victoria was conspicuously absent - apparently abandoned with Tristan. What a wasted opportunity.

Nathan's stormy expression darkened further when he noticed Preston beside Evelyn.

Tristan hurried after Nathan, taking control of the wheelchair. He nodded politely at Preston. "Mr. Sinclair, what a pleasant surprise! I'd appreciate your thoughts on something. Shall we talk over there?" He gestured toward the terrace.

As the host, Tristan couldn't be refused. After a brief hesitation, Preston acquiesced.

Evelyn swirled her grape juice absently, watching the exchange. She turned to Nathan with a polite smile. "Mr. Blackwood, has the entertainment concluded already?" Her tone was light, almost teasing.

Nathan's fingers tightened on the wheelchair armrests. He struggled to contain the tempest within. "Evelyn, was this your doing?"

She blinked innocently. "My doing what?"

"Out of all possible people, why send me over there?" Nathan's voice turned sharp, though part of him dreaded the answer he might receive.

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile as she lowered her gaze. "I assumed you and Chairman Ashford were acquainted. Naturally, you wouldn't ignore his daughter." Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "Besides, I heard her mention you earlier. None of this would have happened without your involvement."

Though she left the implication unspoken, Nathan had heard enough. "I don't know her!" he ground out, emphasizing each word.

His eyes burned into Evelyn's, red-rimmed with suppressed emotion. A bitter laugh escaped him. "Evelyn, you truly have a gift for torture."
###Chapter 467 The Beginning of Something New

Evelyn Sinclair's words caught in her throat as she noticed Victoria Ashford slipping away in her peripheral vision.

The sight of Victoria scurrying upstairs with Nathan Blackwood's suit jacket draped over her shoulders was almost comical in its desperation.

No one else seemed to notice the pathetic display.

Evelyn turned her attention back to Nathan, her expression carefully composed. His dark eyes were unreadable pools of ink.

A dull ache bloomed in her chest, but she inhaled deeply. When the pain subsided, she spoke in a measured tone. "Nathan Blackwood, I don't want to torment you."

Her voice was feather-light yet firm. "I want us both to find peace. During this time apart, I've reflected deeply on our relationship."

She met his gaze steadily. "Thank you for everything you've done for me. But I'm sorry - I can't imagine us together again."

Nathan's face turned to stone.

His entire body tensed, fingers whitening as they gripped the wheelchair armrests. Evelyn felt a fleeting pang of sympathy, but it vanished as quickly as it came.

This clean break was necessary.

Better to sever ties completely than remain entangled in this painful dance. Their time together had given her clarity - she didn't miss Nathan, but rather pitied her younger self for accepting less than she deserved.

Seeing the raw emotion in Nathan's eyes made her chest constrict.

Evelyn lowered her lashes briefly before looking up with a practiced smile. "It's getting late. Thank you for tonight - I'll head back now."

She rose gracefully to leave.

"Evelyn." His voice stopped her, rough with emotion. "You're really rejecting me? I won't accept that."

His gaze burned into hers. "No matter what you say, I'm not giving up. Whether you want me to or not, I'll keep waiting."

Evelyn departed without farewells.

Nathan watched her go, his body rigid. Only when she disappeared did he realize he'd been holding his breath. Cold sweat dampened his shirt as he slumped back in the wheelchair.

Evelyn informed Preston Sinclair of her early departure.

The night air felt refreshing as she began walking toward The Grandeur hotel. The crisp breeze helped clear her turbulent thoughts.

Footsteps approached from behind.

"Mr. Sinclair?" Evelyn turned in surprise. "The event isn't over yet, is it?"

Preston smiled, not even winded from his quick pursuit. His composure remained impeccable. "It's no trouble. I couldn't let a lady walk alone at night."

"A lady?" The old-fashioned term made her lips twitch. "Well then, thank you for the escort, Mr. Sinclair."

"The pleasure is mine."

His eyes sparkled with genuine warmth as they fell into step together. "Mr. Blackwood certainly planned a memorable trip. Though I suspect this marks its conclusion?"

Evelyn considered his question seriously before laughing. "The real pity would be missing profitable opportunities."

"Quite right." Preston nodded approvingly. Business always came first for them.

They walked through the neon-lit streets, the evening breeze playing with Evelyn's hair.

Preston watched her profile soften in the ambient light. "Ms. Sinclair," he ventured, "have you considered... starting anew? With me?"
###Chapter 468 Business Before Pleasure

Preston Sinclair's words hung heavy in the air between them.

The silence stretched, punctuated only by the rustling of leaves in the gentle evening breeze. Evelyn Sinclair stopped walking and turned to face him.

Her piercing gaze held a glacial edge.

When no response came after several heartbeats, Preston smoothly diffused the tension.

A low chuckle escaped his lips. "You heard me correctly, Evelyn. And I won't retract what I said."

His eyes burned with undisguised intensity. The casual tone he adopted couldn't mask the gravity of his declaration. "When I agreed to pose as your new romantic interest to counter Nathan Blackwood's schemes, it wasn't mere politeness."

The corner of his mouth lifted in that perfectly calibrated smile - confident without being arrogant. Evelyn detected a flicker of uncertainty in his expression that mirrored her own confusion.

"Did our arrangement give you the wrong impression? I never intended-"

"I'm well aware you wouldn't manufacture drama," Preston interjected smoothly. "But the timing felt right to confess my genuine feelings."

His gaze locked onto hers with startling sincerity. "Unlike Nathan's heavy-handed tactics, my approach will be respectful. But make no mistake - my interest is very real."

Evelyn studied his open expression, the honesty in his eyes giving her pause. Under the golden glow of streetlamps, their elongated shadows stood motionless on the pavement.

A strange warmth bloomed in her chest at his humility.

Marrying Preston would be strategically advantageous - their social standing and business acumen perfectly matched. He might even be the one man Nathan couldn't intimidate.

Yet Evelyn recoiled at the thought of using relationships as bargaining chips. It would be unfair to Preston, reducing him to a pawn in her personal battles.

After a weighted silence, she schooled her features into polite neutrality. "Mr. Sinclair, I appreciate your candor but-"

"Don't dismiss me so quickly," Preston interrupted gently. "I'm not demanding an answer tonight. I simply want you to know my intentions - that I plan to court you properly."

The starlight reflected in his eyes made Evelyn's breath catch. She quickly regained her composure, offering a practiced smile.

"Let's keep business and personal matters separate, shall we? Our partnership is too valuable to jeopardize over romantic entanglements."

Preston's laughter rang out, rich with amusement. "Of course. Business first."

"Business first," Evelyn echoed in relief. The unspoken agreement lifted the invisible weight between them.

In one evening, she'd gently rebuffed two powerful men. The victory felt hollow.

Back at The Grandeur, Evelyn packed for her return to San Francisco. William Sterling approved their departure - apparently Lucas had been decimating his prized koi collection.

At dawn, little Oliver Sinclair came barreling in wearing dinosaur pajamas, his cherubic face crumpled with distress. Upon learning of Evelyn's departure, the boy stubbornly insisted on accompanying her.

Preston, detained by urgent business, reluctantly entrusted Oliver to Evelyn's care. She suspected his early morning absence wasn't entirely coincidental.

After last night's confession, an awkward morning encounter was best avoided.

Nathan had arranged their flights, determined to travel together. He waited in the lobby, no longer wheelchair-bound but leaning on an ornate cane. His imposing presence turned heads, the air around him crackling with restrained energy.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow stood nervously nearby, clutching the leash of an exuberant husky.

"Good morning," Evelyn said coolly, offering Nathan the barest nod of acknowledgment.

Nathan rose with visible effort, his voice carefully neutral. "We should leave."

Teddy bobbed his head anxiously. "Good morning, Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair. This is Mr. Whitmore's dog that requires transport to San Francisco. If it's an inconvenience-"

The husky suddenly cocked its head, fixing Teddy with an almost human expression of betrayal, its pink tongue lolling in comic dismay.
###Chapter 469 Let Her Stay

Oliver Sinclair stared at the enormous husky that stood nearly as tall as him, wrinkling his nose in distaste. "Pets aren't allowed on planes!"

Nathan Blackwood smirked, adjusting his cufflinks. "My jet makes its own rules."

Oliver's jaw dropped slightly before he recovered with an indignant huff. He grabbed Evelyn Sinclair's hand with sudden determination.

"My Muse," he declared, puffing out his chest, "when we get home, I'll commission a solid gold plane encrusted with diamonds for you! I won't let Mean Mister tempt you with his boring jet!"

Evelyn's lips twitched as she fought back laughter. "That's sweet, Oliver, but I don't care for private planes."

Oliver's shoulders slumped dramatically. Another failed gift attempt for his beloved Muse.

As their group exited the hotel, the husky suddenly barked. Standing shivering in the morning chill was Victoria Ashford, wrapped in Tristan Whitmore's suit jacket.

Victoria looked heartbreakingly fragile, her designer dress wrinkled from last night's rain. The husky sniffed the jacket hopefully before realizing Tristan wasn't present and retreated behind Teddy.

When Victoria spotted Nathan, her face lit up - until she noticed Evelyn behind him. She froze mid-step, uncertainty flashing across her features.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed slightly. So Reginald Ashford was still pushing his daughter at Nathan.

William Sterling frowned at the unfamiliar woman. "Who's this?"

Nathan's expression turned glacial. Teddy quickly interjected, "No idea! Never seen her before!" His frantic tone made it obvious they all recognized her.

Victoria bit her lip, her wounded gaze fixed on Nathan. "Mr. Blackwood...your grandfather invited me to San Francisco. He suggested I travel with your party..."

Nathan's face remained impassive. After a tense silence, Evelyn suddenly smiled. "What a coincidence. She can come with us."

Taking Oliver's hand, Evelyn headed toward the waiting cars. William followed without comment.

Nathan took several steps with his cane before stopping abruptly. Without turning, he ordered Teddy in an icy voice: "Book her a commercial flight."

"Yes, sir!" Teddy barked. Victoria turned deathly pale, humiliation washing over her like a physical blow. Evelyn could ride in Nathan's private jet, while she was relegated to economy class.

Teddy quickly summoned the hotel manager. "Get Ms. Ashford a ticket to San Francisco," he instructed before practically diving into the car.

On board the plane, Evelyn and William discussed business across from each other while Teddy tended to the husky. This left Nathan facing Oliver in the plush cabin.

A flight attendant served Nathan coffee and brought Oliver milk. She couldn't resist cooing, "What an adorable little gentleman!"

Oliver scowled. "We're both men! Why does he get coffee?" Spotting Evelyn without a drink, he cleared his throat importantly. "Bring me coffee. For my Muse." He nodded sagely. "Nanny says all ladies like sweets."

Nathan chuckled, raising an eyebrow. "Light on the sugar. She prefers it bitter."
###Chapter 470 Why Not?

Oliver Sinclair huffed impatiently. "Bring the sugar. I'll do it myself!" He couldn't trust anyone in Nathan Blackwood's circle.

Not after last time.

What if they deliberately made Evelyn's coffee bitter? The flight attendant arrived with a porcelain cup and silver sugar bowl.

Nathan's lips curled into that infuriating smirk as he deliberately provoked the boy. "Don't overdo it. Evelyn prefers her coffee black." Oliver stuck out his tongue defiantly.

He'd prove this arrogant man wrong. Evelyn adored sweet things - he just knew it! Without hesitation, Oliver dumped six heaping spoonfuls until the dark liquid nearly overflowed. Only then did he step back, satisfied.

"She'll taste my affection in every sip!" Nathan arched an eyebrow but didn't intervene, calmly sipping his own bitter brew.

Oliver carefully carried the syrupy concoction to Evelyn. "Muse! I made this special for you. No one else gets coffee this perfect."

Evelyn paused her reading with an amused smile. "How thoughtful. Set it here darling, I'll enjoy it later."

The boy practically skipped back to his seat. William Sterling extended a hand. "I could use a pick-me-up. May I?" Evelyn readily passed him the cup.

One sip had William coughing violently into his handkerchief.

"Father!" Evelyn rushed to his side with tissues. "Are you alright?"

William shot Oliver an incredulous look before composing himself. "Just... remembered my doctor warned against sugar." That cup could send a diabetic into shock.

Oliver's triumphant grin faltered as Evelyn discreetly had the coffee removed. Nathan's quiet chuckle made his small hands clench.

"You tricked me!" Oliver accused, tiny chest heaving. "Grown-ups shouldn't lie to children!"

Nathan's smirk widened. "Last I checked, real men take responsibility for their choices." He deliberately used Oliver's favorite phrase against him.

The boy turned away with a dramatic huff. "When I inherit Daddy's empire, I'll crush you beneath my Italian loafers!"

After escorting Evelyn and William to Sterling Manor, Nathan returned to Aspen Lodge. Margaret Blackwood awaited with visible satisfaction - she'd finally convinced Old Master Blackwood to abandon the Sterling alliance.

No more tolerating that headstrong Evelyn. Margaret would happily accept any biddable girl - especially one she could control.

Entering the grand foyer, Nathan froze. There, sipping tea with his mother, sat Victoria Ashford of all people.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Victoria nearly spilled her Earl Grey in her haste to stand. Margaret beamed.

"I invited Ms. Ashford. Our families have such history." Her pointed glance said everything. "She'll be staying the week. You'll show her around, won't you darling?"

Nathan's cane hit the marble with a sharp crack. "What is this?" His glacial tone made Victoria pale.

Margaret's smile didn't waver. "Consider it... an alternative investment."
###Chapter 471 Not as Important as Her

Nathan's eyes were shadowed with exhaustion. He remained silent, his gaze lifting to meet Old Master Blackwood's piercing stare from the second-floor balcony.

A subtle nod passed between them.

Old Master Blackwood's lips thinned. "Come upstairs," he commanded.

The study was thick with tension as Nathan entered. The elder Blackwood sat behind his mahogany desk, expression unreadable.

"I made my position clear over the phone."

Nathan didn't hesitate. "And I don't agree."

Old Master Blackwood's face darkened. "If it weren't for the Sterling family backing Evelyn, I would never have tolerated this reunion. You nearly died for her, yet she remains indifferent. What of the Blackwood family's dignity?"

The air turned glacial.

Nathan's voice was ice. "The Blackwood name isn't as important as Evelyn."

The old man slammed his palm on the desk, fury contorting his features. "You—!"

Nathan didn't flinch. His voice dropped lower, lethal. "There will be no one else. That woman downstairs could never compare to her—let alone deserve to."

A paperweight flew across the room.

Nathan didn't dodge.

The sharp edge struck his temple, blood immediately streaking down his face.

Old Master Blackwood froze, then seethed. "This is all because of her!"

Nathan swayed slightly but steadied himself. He wiped the blood with his sleeve, his stare unwavering.

"If I can't choose who I marry, then find yourself an heir you can control."

The threat hung in the air.

Even without the Blackwood empire, Nathan's hidden influence could dismantle it with ease.

Without another word, he turned, cane in hand, and walked out.

The message was clear—he'd burn the family legacy before letting them dictate his heart.

Old Master Blackwood watched him leave, disgusted. His most promising heir, willing to throw everything away for a woman?

Nathan descended the stairs, his presence so frigid no one dared approach.

Margaret had expected him to yield.

"Nathan," she called, forcing a smile. "Stay a few days. Accompany Ms. Ashford for outings."

Victoria Ashford stood nearby, mimicking her half-sister Penelope's grace—poorly.

Nathan didn't even glance at her. He strode toward the door.

Margaret's voice turned shrill. "You defy your grandfather now?!"

Nathan paused. "Do you still wish to see Sophia?"

The room iced over.

Victoria, sensing danger, intervened. "Mrs. Blackwood, Mr. Blackwood is busy. I'll explore the city alone. It's no trouble."

Margaret patted her hand stiffly. "So understanding."

Nathan left without another word.

Back at Highland Estates, Teddy was alone, walking the ridiculous husky.

Nathan scowled. "Why is that thing still here?"

Teddy grinned. "Young Master Whitmore insisted. Said he'd collect it personally."

The husky wagged its tail, then—mocking Nathan—limped in a circle.

Nathan's expression darkened.

Teddy burst out laughing. "No wonder Tristan said this dog has an IQ of 120!"

A single glare silenced him.
###Chapter 472 Goddess of Fortune at Highland Estates

The night air carried a crisp chill, wrapping the mansion in silence.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow observed Nathan Blackwood standing motionless on the balcony. "Ms. Sinclair won't be returning tonight, sir. She just arrived back in town and is likely resting at Sterling Manor."

Nathan's gaze remained fixed on the horizon. "I'm aware."

"Then why..." Teddy hesitated before voicing his confusion. "Perhaps it's for the best that Ms. Ashford stays. A little jealousy might bring Ms. Sinclair running back."

"Jealousy?" Nathan's expression darkened instantly. The suggestion felt like salt being rubbed into an open wound. His piercing glare made Teddy shrink back.

"Do you enjoy watching me suffer?"

Evelyn would probably celebrate Victoria Ashford's extended stay - she'd practically orchestrated their encounters back in...

Jealousy?

Nathan didn't dare entertain the thought.

Should he gamble his future on Evelyn's fleeting compassion?

No. He didn't deserve even that much.

Teddy retreated further into the shadows. What he'd assumed would be a simple business trip had spiraled out of control thanks to Preston Sinclair and Victoria Ashford's interference.

These weren't opponents to be taken lightly.

At this rate, Teddy feared he'd find himself tossed into the River Aurora before long!

Days passed without Evelyn setting foot in Highland Estates.

Her excuse? An overwhelming backlog at Sterling Corporation.

Truthfully, Evelyn found the distance from Nathan strangely liberating.

Between office hours, she reconnected with Isabella Montgomery and Natalie Beaumont. Sebastian Hart joined them whenever boredom struck.

It felt like returning to her carefree life before Nathan - warm, familiar, and satisfying.

Scrolling through her social feed, Evelyn chuckled at William Sterling's generation sharing health tips while society ladies like Isabella and Natalie posted shopping hauls, complaining about their "exhausting" privileged lives between expanding their empires.

But Sebastian's posts raised eyebrows. The usually flamboyant playboy had suddenly developed refined tastes!

Their circle flooded his latest with comments:

[Jade carvings? Since when did Sebastian Hart develop such sophisticated tastes?]

[If the Hart heir is investing in luxury decor, should we buy stocks now?]

[Sebastian, did you purchase land? Rumor says thousands of acres in the south just changed hands! Congratulations!]

Old Reginald Hart himself commented: [I don't recall you promoting our family's diamond mines with this much enthusiasm!]

The thread fell silent after that.

Amused, Evelyn shared the post with her own caption.

Isabella messaged immediately: [Why encourage Sebastian's madness?]

[Evelyn Sinclair: Just helping spread the word.]

A notification popped up - someone had replied to her share.

[Teddy Winslow: Our generous Mr. Blackwood has ordered two thousand pounds. Payment ready whenever.]

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up, calculating whether two thousand pounds would suffice. Simultaneously, Preston Sinclair replied:

[Preston Sinclair: I'll take whatever remains.]

Now that was impressive!

When Sebastian discovered this, he nearly danced with joy. Four thousand pounds perfectly divided between two buyers.

His call came through instantly. "You must attend tonight's celebration! Bring those two benefactors to sign contracts. I'll be waiting!"

Evelyn didn't even get to refuse. For a moment, she regretted getting involved. Yet both Nathan and Preston - two notoriously busy men - agreed without hesitation.

Nathan arrived leaning on his cane rather than using his wheelchair, projecting steady composure.

Preston maintained his usual aristocratic warmth.

The event's exclusivity surprised Evelyn - political heavyweights and industry titans mingled effortlessly. This was no ordinary gathering.

Inside, Sebastian Hart worked the room with practiced charm. Spotting Evelyn, he rushed over with outstretched arms. "My Goddess of Fortune!"
###Chapter 473 The Mask of Deception

Evelyn Sinclair's lips curled into a self-satisfied smirk. She gave a subtle nod to the attendees before casting a pointed glance at Sebastian Hart.

"Mr. Hart, your sudden expansion into this business venture is quite... unexpected, isn't it?" Her voice carried just enough edge to make Sebastian shift uncomfortably.

Without this intervention, Preston Sinclair would have been forced to cover his grandiose promises from his own accounts.

The two titans of industry sat at the front. The signing ceremony proceeded with efficient solemnity, devoid of unnecessary fanfare.

This time, the spotlight wasn't on Sebastian as the organizer. All eyes naturally gravitated toward him.

Evelyn positioned herself beside Nathan Blackwood, effortlessly commanding attention as always.

The crowd surrounding Preston and Nathan consisted of those seeking favor, creating a stark contrast to Evelyn and Nathan's circle.

Preston and Nathan maintained composed expressions as they observed the other side. Both men couldn't shake the uncomfortable realization that they were essentially aiding their romantic rival.

During the reception's midpoint...

Evelyn's brow furrowed when she noticed Nathan's limping approach. She moved forward to intercept him.

"Mr. Blackwood, surely you could have sent a representative if mobility is an issue for you."

Nathan's eyebrows twitched almost imperceptibly.

"I wanted to personally inquire when you'll be returning to Highland Estates."

Their original agreement stipulated she would remain until his full recovery.

Evelyn paused momentarily, the corners of her mouth lifting in a calculated smile.

"I believe my presence would be inappropriate now. Doesn't Ms. Ashford attend to your needs, Mr. Blackwood? Should I return to Highland Estates, I fear the entire Blackwood clan might skin me alive!"

Nathan's expression darkened instantly at the mention of that name.

The Blackwood family's intentions had become transparent. Evelyn was far too perceptive not to recognize their scheme.

"There's no possibility of anyone but you becoming my wife. No one else holds that power."

Nathan's tone brooked no argument, his gaze unshakably resolute.

Evelyn lowered her eyes with an unaffected smile.

"Let's not revisit this. The fragile peace between the Sterling and Blackwood families finally holds. If we continue testing each other's limits, reconciliation may become impossible. Shouldn't we focus on mutual interests instead, Mr. Blackwood?"

Business first - their shared professional creed.

Nathan exhaled sharply, his eyes betraying quiet frustration.

He had hoped to discuss matters of the heart, only to find her mind occupied solely with financial considerations.

"I'll resolve this situation promptly."

Victoria Ashford had become an unbearable thorn in Nathan's side. He refused to tolerate this arrangement indefinitely.

Evelyn offered a noncommittal laugh as Sebastian approached with two champagne flutes, studying Nathan with undisguised curiosity.

"Mr. Blackwood, while we're grateful for your assistance, I must ask - what prompted this unexpected generosity?"

Nathan Blackwood wasn't known for altruistic gestures without clear motivation.

Nathan's voice dropped to a glacial timbre. "If not for Evelyn, do you imagine I'd lift a finger for you?"

Sebastian's eyebrows arched - an answer he'd anticipated.

His attention then shifted to the dignified Preston Sinclair nearby, prompting immediate deference.

"Mr. Sinclair, what an honor. We appreciate your timely intervention, but might I inquire about your motivations?"

Evelyn shot Sebastian a warning glare, silently commanding him to cease stirring trouble.

Nathan's gaze swept between the two men before settling on Preston.

Preston offered a benign smile. "Isn't it our duty to assist those in need? The mountain communities require our support. As businessmen, we bear responsibility to dedicate resources to public welfare. Mr. Hart, I'd gladly participate in future initiatives of this nature."

Sebastian stood dumbfounded.

Even Evelyn regarded Preston with newfound admiration.

Nathan turned away with a derisive scoff. The hypocrisy was almost impressive.
###Chapter 474 Guess Who

The reception ended, and the crowd dispersed.

Sebastian Hart caught a ride with Evelyn Sinclair. During the drive back, he couldn't stop praising Preston Sinclair.

"That man operates on another level entirely. He's in a league of his own compared to us ordinary folk!"

Evelyn gave a slight nod in agreement.

The R&D project at Kingsley Tech was progressing remarkably well. Within days, they had achieved breakthrough results.

The new project assistant, Benjamin Carter, stationed at Kingsley Tech, found himself overwhelmed by the project's scale. He requested Evelyn to send additional support staff.

Evelyn approved the request without hesitation.

After all, the project had reached an advanced stage where complexity and specialization far exceeded initial expectations.

Two days later, Bennett delivered the list of new recruits to Evelyn.

Evelyn scanned the documents while Bennett hesitated. "These candidates all graduated from Ivy League schools. Would you like to select one personally?"

She flipped through the stack casually. "Who stands out in this batch?"

Bennett didn't answer directly. Instead, he hinted, "There's someone here you wouldn't expect."

Evelyn's eyebrows arched with curiosity. She turned several pages before freezing at a familiar photograph. Her fingers twitched, her smile vanishing instantly.

"What the hell?"

Bennett cleared his throat. "Victoria Ashford, daughter of Ashford Group's chairman."

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she examined Victoria's credentials - a mediocre state university graduate with no notable achievements. Such qualifications shouldn't have made it past initial screening.

Bennett explained, "Chairman Ashford personally contacted our HR department. While the resume was forwarded, the final decision remains ours."

Evelyn's eyes flashed briefly. She tapped her fingers rhythmically on the desk, her expression unreadable.

It appeared Victoria Ashford was preparing for a long-term game.

Or perhaps she specifically aimed to infiltrate Sterling Corporation?

Whatever the motive, it certainly piqued Evelyn's interest.

A smirk played at Evelyn's lips. "Assign her to assist Benjamin then."

Bennett nodded. "Understood."

At Kingsley Tech...

Evelyn received a message from Dominic Kingsley requesting her presence for the next phase discussions.

Simultaneously, Victoria Ashford received her onboarding notice.

Victoria currently resided in a luxury apartment near Blackwood Enterprises, boasting premium amenities in an upscale neighborhood.

Her assignment directed her to report directly to Kingsley Tech, not Sterling Corporation.

Bennett handled her orientation.

When Evelyn arrived at Kingsley Tech, Dominic Kingsley waited at the entrance to greet the VIP.

Marcus opened the car door for Evelyn, who stepped out gracefully. Dominic greeted her warmly.

"Ms. Sterling, your punctuality is commendable."

Evelyn replied smoothly, "Tardiness isn't in my vocabulary."

As they chatted toward the elevators, they crossed paths with Bennett giving Victoria a tour, the new hire clutching paperwork.

Bennett paused to bow respectfully.

"Good afternoon, Ms. Sterling. This is our new—"

Victoria didn't greet them, her gaze locked on the elegant Evelyn. She expected recognition, but Evelyn didn't spare her a glance.

Evelyn didn't break stride, offering only a faint acknowledging smile as she followed Dominic toward the conference room, her regal bearing effortless.

Victoria's fists clenched as she stared at Evelyn's retreating figure.

This felt like their first meeting, yet she knew better.

The Evelyn before her exuded refinement so natural it couldn't be faked. That innate poise and confidence were qualities Victoria could never replicate.

"Let's go, Ms. Ashford," Bennett instructed briskly. "Fetch three coffees - two black, one with milk only."
Here's the rewritten version following all your instructions:

###Chapter 475 Drink Mine

Victoria Ashford nodded and headed to the pantry. In her mind, Penelope Ashford was the epitome of high society. Penelope moved effortlessly among elite circles for the family business. Even Reginald Ashford couldn't stop praising his eldest daughter.

To appease Penelope, Reginald never publicly acknowledged Victoria as his daughter. If not for needing an unmarried daughter for business alliances, Victoria would still be trapped in that tiny apartment.

Victoria carried the coffee tray toward the conference room.

As she opened the door, she saw Nathan Blackwood speaking with Dominic Kingsley near the entrance. Nathan appeared aloof and composed, but when his gaze landed on Evelyn across the room, his eyes softened noticeably.

The stark contrast to the disdain he showed Victoria made her heart ache.

The three figures at the table seemed to exist in their own exclusive world, far removed from ordinary people.

When Nathan looked up and noticed Victoria standing there, his expression immediately darkened.

Victoria pretended not to notice his reaction and quietly entered to serve the coffee. "Your coffee, everyone."

Evelyn heard her voice and glanced over silently. Before she could speak, Nathan's icy tone cut through the air.

"What are you doing here?"

Nathan shot Dominic a questioning look since this was his company. Why was this woman present?

Dominic shrugged innocently, then suddenly remembered. "This must be the new assistant from Sterling Corporation. Benjamin needed extra help, right?" He turned to Evelyn for confirmation.

Evelyn hesitated briefly before nodding. She studied Victoria with a measured gaze. "Since you're new here, focus on adapting quickly."

Victoria tensed slightly, unprepared for Evelyn's composed reaction.

Cool, collected, and slightly patronizing.

That simple statement served as both acknowledgment and subtle warning.

Victoria nodded, suppressing the turmoil inside. "Understood, Ms. Sterling."

She knew perfectly well that without her father's influence, she'd never have gotten this assistant position based on her qualifications alone.

Reginald Ashford wanted Victoria to emulate Evelyn, hoping it would bring her closer to Nathan's inner circle.

Nathan frowned. His expression remained neutral, but discomfort prickled at him.

He watched Evelyn intently, searching for clues in her demeanor.

"It doesn't add up," he thought. "Sterling Corporation and Ashford Group have no business ties. Is this really coincidence?"

Victoria proactively served black coffee to the two men and a milk coffee to Evelyn before stepping aside to prepare meeting notes.

Evelyn took a small sip before setting the cup aside. She resumed the earlier discussion.

"Mr. Sinclair wants to increase his investment because he's bullish about AI prospects and confident in our R&D capabilities. But he has one condition - when the project matures, he wants it listed in Liberty. That would definitely make waves on Wall Street and globally."

Nathan's eyes darkened. He always separated business from personal matters. His tone remained flat.

"He's been in Liberty too long and lost touch with domestic realities. I believe we should expand in Montecito first. I oppose listing in Liberty."

Dominic interjected, "Mr. Sinclair's idea has merit. A Liberty listing would attract more investors and global attention, propelling our project to the top. We'd become untouchable. But..." He hesitated. "It somehow feels like betraying our country."

Evelyn frowned, tapping her fingers thoughtfully on the table.

Seeing this, Victoria hurried forward to refill Evelyn's coffee with careful movements.

###Chapter 476 You Don't Need To

Evelyn remained indifferent, never touching the coffee with milk froth.

Nathan, seated across from her, noticed and slid his untouched cup toward her.

Evelyn raised a questioning brow. Nathan's lips curved slightly. To outsiders, his flirtatious gaze appeared tender. "Haven't touched it yet. This one's black."

Dominic chuckled, eyeing his own cup. "Oh, Ms. Sterling's cup is actually mine. This isn't Kingsley Tech's oversight, is it?"

Victoria's heart pounded like a boulder crushed her chest. She'd assumed preferences without asking.

She had to admit she'd made a poor assistant.

Evelyn smiled faintly, twirling her pen carelessly. "Fine. My assistant's mistake. As apology, I'll invite you to my brother's yacht launch tonight. Interested?"

Dominic clicked his tongue. "Absolutely! Lucas's events are impossible to get into. Can I bring a plus one?"

"No, just you," Evelyn said.

Nathan's clear voice cut in. "I'm attending too."

Evelyn nodded and began packing her things as if nothing happened. "Let's pause here. We'll continue the listing discussion when Mr. Sinclair visits next. Excuse me."

Dominic called after her. "Join us for lunch?"

"No, thanks." As Evelyn moved to leave, she glanced at Victoria. "Benjamin's traveling, so you'll accompany me tonight."

She didn't ask for Victoria's opinion.

Victoria instinctively looked at Nathan, equal parts cautious and delighted. "Yes, Ms. Sterling."

Opportunities were presenting themselves. Sooner or later, Nathan would notice her.

Evelyn exited without another glance.

In the now-empty conference room, only Dominic and Nathan remained.

Dominic studied Nathan's stormy expression and couldn't resist needling him. "Mr. Blackwood, I thought your reconciliation was going splendidly. Seems there are still... complications?"

Nathan's sharp gaze could pierce steel. His face showed no warmth. "Curiosity killed the cat."

Dominic paused, then stood with an amused smile. "Tsk tsk. Do you think Ms. Sterling kept that assistant around intentionally?"

Nathan's exact thought. Yet he remained impassive, raising one brow. "Why don't you ask her yourself?"

Dominic got no reaction - exactly as expected. Few had the privilege of witnessing Nathan's private dramas, let alone seeing him lose composure.

Nathan calmly rose, leaning on his cane as he limped out, radiating unapproachable authority.

In the elevator lobby, Victoria waited nearby. She hurried to press the button for him. "Mr. Blackwood—"

She wanted his attention.

Nathan ignored her. "Where's Ms. Sterling?" His tone treated her like any subordinate.

Victoria's face stiffened. She pointed toward a side office. "With Benjamin."

Nathan said nothing, heading to the opposite office to wait for Evelyn.

Victoria lowered her eyes to hide her disappointment, then went to fetch Nathan coffee.

Nathan frowned. "You're not my assistant." His implication was clear - she'd overstepped.

Victoria bit her lip, affecting a soft, ingratiating manner. "Mr. Blackwood, it's my first yacht event. Any protocols I should know?"

Nathan replied coolly, "You don't need to do anything." She was merely an assistant - what preparations could she possibly need?

Victoria smiled awkwardly.
###Chapter 477 What Are You Doing?

The Royal Opera House glittered under the night sky, its marquee announcing the premiere of the season. Evelyn Sinclair clutched her front-row tickets, the crisp paper edges biting into her gloved fingers.

She stepped out of the limousine in a champagne-colored gown that whispered rather than shouted. The high neckline and long sleeves exuded sophistication, while the bias cut accentuated her willowy frame. Preston Sinclair had personally selected this dress from a Parisian atelier and sent it via Bennett.

Paparazzi flashbulbs exploded like fireworks as she approached. The crowd's roar swelled - Lucas Sterling's star power truly knew no bounds. Then disaster struck. Her custom Louboutin caught on the red carpet's edge, sending her stumbling. The delicate stiletto snapped clean at the heel.

Cameras whirred hungrily below. One misstep now would land her on every gossip site by morning. Evelyn bit back a curse and retreated into the limo's sanctuary.

Marcus, her bodyguard, frowned. "Ms. Sterling, what happened?"

"My shoe's destroyed," she hissed. "Find me replacements. Now."

Victoria Ashford materialized like a specter. "I always carry emergency heels in my bag. They should fit you, Ms. Sinclair." Her saccharine smile didn't reach her eyes.

Evelyn studied the offered pumps - decent quality, but clearly off-the-rack. "How...thoughtful," she said through clenched teeth. Time was slipping away like sand through fingers.

The replacement shoes pinched immediately. As she resumed her walk, the left strap suddenly gave way. Evelyn bent to adjust it when icy fingers of dread raced down her spine - her back zipper had split open.

Every hair on her arms stood erect. This wasn't coincidence. This was sabotage. And only one person stood to gain.

Flashbulbs popped like gunfire. Evelyn's mind raced. If she stood now, every camera would capture her humiliation. She could already feel the night air kissing her exposed skin.

Reporters began murmuring at her prolonged crouch. Just as she braced for disaster, warmth enveloped her shoulders. Preston Sinclair's bespoke tuxedo jacket settled around her like a shield.

She looked up into amused hazel eyes. Preston didn't flinch from the cameras, his posture casual as if shielding her from a breeze. The press went wild.

"Is this the mystery man from your Instagram?" shouted one reporter.

"Are you two officially dating?" cried another.

The questions blurred together. All Evelyn registered was Preston's steadying presence as he guided her inside.

In the private lounge, Preston knelt before her. "These shoes are an insult to that dress," he murmured, carefully removing the offending pumps. His fingers lingered a heartbeat too long on her ankle.

Their eyes locked. The air between them crackled.

Three silent seconds stretched into eternity.

Then Nathan Blackwood's voice sliced through the moment like a blade. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"
###Chapter 478 Lead a Horse to Water From

Nathan's perspective showed Evelyn sitting gracefully while Preston knelt before her in a posture that could easily be mistaken for a marriage proposal.

The tenderness in Preston's movements as he removed Evelyn's shoes sent waves of discomfort through Nathan.

They resembled a couple deeply in love! Nathan's expression darkened, his icy glare fixed dangerously on Preston.

Though Preston heard Nathan's voice, he calmly finished putting Evelyn's shoes back on before rising with perfect composure.

"Ms. Sterling, you should have someone bring you a change of clothes and wait in the upstairs lounge." Evelyn thanked him naturally before texting Lucas to prepare a new dress and shoes.

Lucas remained her most reliable sibling. She wouldn't trust her bodyguard Marcus with fashion choices - the man had no sense of style whatsoever.

Nathan approached with thunderous steps, his stormy gaze locked on Preston. Seeing another man touch what he considered his property ignited possessive fury within him.

He was losing control! Despite his limp and cane, Nathan's presence remained commanding and intimidating.

Preston met Nathan's gaze without flinching, his gentlemanly demeanor matching Nathan's intensity blow for blow.

Sparks flew between the two men as their silent battle raged. "What exactly were you doing just now?" Nathan repeated, his voice dripping with venom.

His eyes burned when they landed on Preston's suit jacket wrapped around Evelyn's shoulders. The sight felt like a knife twisting in his gut.

Nathan's gaze flickered with barely restrained fury.

Evelyn walked past him, pausing briefly to murmur, "We don't owe you explanations for our actions, do we?" Her tone made clear she resented Nathan overstepping boundaries.

He needed to remember his place. Besides, if Victoria Ashford was behind this incident, Nathan bore responsibility. Without his past entanglements, Evelyn wouldn't have nearly suffered public humiliation.

Without waiting for Nathan's response, Evelyn ascended to the lounge. Nathan's expression darkened further, his eyes becoming storm clouds.

Preston approached with a polite smile, his face carefully neutral. "Mr. Blackwood, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Some things simply can't be forced."

Nathan's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously. "Regardless, it remains my horse. No one else is worthy to touch it." The temperature in the room seemed to plummet instantly.

Outside, reporters and fans remained oblivious to this explosive confrontation - had they known, it would have sparked another media frenzy.

Upstairs in the private lounge...

Lucas arrived with replacement attire, exasperated yet efficient as always when dealing with his troublesome sister. "Fortunately the sponsors carry your preferred brand, though these are off-the-rack pieces."

"Don't you usually wear custom designs for these events?" Evelyn sighed in relief as she removed Preston's jacket and turned her back to Lucas.

"Look at this!" The zipper had broken, exposing a scandalous amount of skin. While Evelyn had an enviable back, this dress wasn't designed to be backless, making the malfunction particularly inappropriate.

Having collaborated with her favorite designer for years, Evelyn knew this wasn't a production error. Lucas's eyes widened in shock. "What the hell? Who did this? Bennett can't even do his job properly?" His anger flared at the deliberate sabotage.

Evelyn gathered the new clothes and headed for the changing room. "It wasn't Bennett. Someone else is responsible."

"Who? I'll make them pay!" Lucas's protective instincts roared to life - nobody messed with his baby sister.

Evelyn chuckled softly as she closed the door. "I'll handle it. You can go now." Lucas stormed out, his fury barely contained.
###Chapter 479 Can't Explain

Evelyn slipped into an elegant black evening gown.

The dress accentuated her regal bearing, making her appear untouchable. The designer heels were her signature style, perfectly complementing her outfit.

She exhaled slowly, replaying the earlier events in her mind.

Without hesitation, she grabbed her phone and dialed Marcus.

"Make sure Victoria Ashford shows up," she instructed.

"Understood, Miss Sinclair," Marcus replied promptly.

Evelyn took a steadying breath before stepping out of the room.

Gabrielle, Lucas's assistant, was waiting just outside.

"Mr. Sterling was concerned about you being alone tonight," Gabrielle explained. "He asked me to accompany you."

Evelyn nodded. She could use the extra help.

"Perfect. Wait here for Ms. Ashford," she said with a faint smile. "I need to speak with her privately."

Gabrielle gave a reassuring nod. "Of course, Miss Sinclair."

"It's almost time. I'll head downstairs first."

With that, Evelyn descended gracefully. She wasn't one to tolerate nonsense, and tonight would be no exception.

The theater hall was bathed in soft, dramatic lighting.

Only one seat remained in the front row—sandwiched between Nathan and Preston.

Evelyn paused mid-step.

Fantastic. Just the kind of suffocating arrangement she didn’t need.

Before she could reconsider, Preston spotted her and waved her over.

She forced a composed smile and took her seat.

Nathan didn’t glance her way. No warm greeting, no acknowledgment.

His usual gentle demeanor was absent.

Clearly, he was still upset about earlier.

Evelyn suppressed a sigh.

Preston leaned in, whispering, "Lucas has quite the fanbase. The entire audience is here for him."

Pride swelled in Evelyn's chest, though she remained modest.

"My brother is just fortunate—good looks, talent, and charm."

Preston's lips twitched before breaking into a wider grin.

Nathan, seated beside her, remained silent.

His expression only darkened further.

The first act concluded. An assistant approached with three cups of coffee.

Preston handed one to Evelyn, who passed it to Nathan.

Nathan hesitated for half a second before reaching for it.

Then—disaster.

The cup slipped before he could secure his grip.

Hot coffee splashed onto his immaculate suit.

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

His OCD wouldn’t allow him to sit through the rest of the evening like this.

As he stood, the assistant was quicker, snatching his cane.

"Apologies, Mr. Blackwood—"

Nathan shot him a sharp glare and reclaimed his cane.

Then his eyes flicked to Evelyn. "I need to change."

She nodded, watching him leave before settling back into her seat.

Something about the assistant seemed familiar.

Moments after Nathan exited, Evelyn discreetly slipped out.

Theodore had already relayed Nathan’s lounge number to him.

Nathan stepped out of the elevator and located the room.

Inside, darkness greeted him.

He flicked the lights on—and froze.

A woman’s purse and dress lay discarded on the plush sofa.

His expression turned icy.

Then, the bathroom door creaked open.

A dripping-wet Victoria Ashford emerged, wrapped in nothing but a flimsy towel.

It barely covered her.

Nathan’s face darkened dangerously.

His gaze was sharp enough to cut glass.

"Who told you to come here?" His voice was glacial.

Victoria gasped, clutching the slipping towel with reddened cheeks.

"Mr. Blackwood! Wh-what are you doing here?"

Nathan’s disdain was palpable.

"Get out—"

Before he could finish, Victoria suddenly shrieked and ducked behind him.

A swarm of reporters burst through the door, cameras flashing relentlessly.
###Chapter 480 Get Lost With You

Nathan Blackwood and Victoria Ashford's intimate embrace created an explosive scene that stunned everyone present.

The paparazzi descended like vultures spotting fresh prey.

Camera shutters clicked relentlessly, capturing every angle of the compromising position. Victoria Ashford trembled behind Nathan's broad frame, her delicate form shaking with apparent fear.

None of the reporters anticipated both Evelyn Sinclair and Nathan Blackwood would have new romantic entanglements. In the next heartbeat, Nathan shoved Victoria away as if she were contaminated garbage.

His expression radiated pure disgust without restraint. He didn't care that Victoria stood nearly naked before the flashing cameras. Nathan advanced toward the reporters with a gaze that could freeze hell itself.

"I don't care who tipped you off." His voice dripped with menace. "If a single word or photo of this leaks, every one of you will be unemployed by sunrise."

The camera clicks ceased instantly. An oppressive silence fell over the hallway. The reporters stared at Nathan with undisguised terror. Normally seen only in financial sections, Nathan Blackwood's name occasionally graced tabloid covers connected to Evelyn.

Because these stories were never suppressed - Nathan allowed them - the media had forgotten the untouchable status of Blackwood Enterprises' CEO. A man whose influence reached into every industry.

That Nathan Blackwood's name appeared in gossip columns at all was practically sacrilege. Yet these reporters had grown bold enough to chase his scandals. Their audacity!

A collective shiver ran through the group as their eyes darted to the pitiful figure crumpled on the floor - Victoria Ashford. She had been their informant, promising explosive revelations.

Nathan followed their gazes and instantly understood.

"She dares scheme against me?" His eyes darkened like storm clouds, radiating an arctic chill. His imposing frame seemed to grow larger, his voice sharp as a guillotine blade.

"Get the hell out of here!" The reporters scattered like frightened mice, terrified of becoming examples. The hallway emptied within seconds.

Nathan turned his attention to the trembling woman on the floor. Victoria's bare shoulders shook with affected vulnerability, her porcelain skin glowing in the dim light. But Nathan saw only deception.

The door remained wide open.

Nathan couldn't care less about Victoria's exposed state.

Victoria, however, feigned modesty, clutching the bath towel tighter around herself. "Mr. Blackwood, please let me dress first-" Her plan had failed spectacularly.

She'd hoped to force Nathan into acknowledging their relationship publicly, securing her position at his side. But Nathan's glacial stare cut through her like an arctic wind.

"Ms. Ashford, I detest being manipulated." Victoria's face drained of color as she stammered denials. "It wasn't me!" Nathan saw through the lie immediately, his gaze shifting away in disgust.

He couldn't bear looking at her another second. "Evidence would be trivial to obtain, but you're not worth my time." His voice held finality, leaving no room for negotiation.

"You have two choices: disappear back to whatever hole you crawled from, or I'll have Reginald Ashford join you in exile." Victoria's face turned ashen, her heart plummeting to her stomach.
###Chapter 481 The Spectacle Unfolds

Nathan Blackwood's demeanor was icy and unyielding, his stance leaving no room for negotiation. It was a stark contrast to what Victoria Ashford had envisioned.

Victoria was utterly taken aback. Panic surged through her, her eyes welling with pitiful tears.

Her cheeks flushed crimson as she trembled, gazing at Nathan with the look of a wounded fawn. "Mr. Blackwood, why? Everyone says we'd make the perfect match." As the youngest daughter of Reginald Ashford, chairman of Ashford Group, Victoria believed their social standings aligned perfectly.

Yet despite this, Nathan refused to even glance her way. Why hadn't he sought a marriage alliance with her family? During this period, Evelyn Sinclair had shown no interest in him whatsoever.

So why couldn't Victoria secure his attention? The confusion and desperate hope twisted inside her.

Nathan didn't spare her a single glance, nor did he bother with explanations. To him, she wasn't worth his time. He pulled out his phone and dialed Theodore.

"Send someone up to clean this room immediately." His voice carried a bone-chilling frost that made the air itself seem to freeze. As he turned to leave, he suddenly froze mid-step.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn, who stood framed in the opposite doorway. A storm of emotions flashed through his eyes, followed by a flicker of panic—what if she misunderstood?

Nathan strode forward, his expression grim. "Evelyn, what are you doing here?"

Evelyn arched a brow, her lips curling into an amused smirk. "Why, I'm enjoying the show, of course!"

She had sensed something amiss from the very beginning. The moment that cup of coffee had "accidentally" spilled on Nathan, Evelyn had noticed the assistant's strange behavior.

Her mind raced. Who was behind this? It had to be one of Benjamin Carter's team members working on the Kingsley Tech project—someone who knew Victoria well. Why else would they create an opportunity for Victoria to barge into Nathan's room uninvited?

So Evelyn had followed, positioning herself to witness the entire spectacle unnoticed.

This drama far surpassed Lucas Sterling's performance downstairs.

Pity Victoria's tactics were so amateurish. She should have invited their parents instead of just reporters.

Nathan stood rigid, his face darkening with hurt. Evelyn's indifference cut deeper than any anger would have. He'd have preferred her shouting at him over this detached amusement.

"Enjoying yourself?" Nathan asked, his tone deceptively calm.

Evelyn's smirk widened. "A bit cliché, but entertaining nonetheless."

Victoria's ploy was painfully transparent, but watching Nathan squirm was always amusing. Evelyn caught the icy glint in his eyes—Victoria's chances with him were now less than zero. Nathan despised schemers.

Evelyn might have helped Victoria, but since the girl had tried to manipulate her too, she'd let the consequences unfold naturally.

Nathan approached, his cane tapping against the marble floor. The air around him turned glacial.

As he drew nearer, Evelyn caught the crisp scent of winter mint clinging to him. For a fleeting moment, she forgot to breathe.

She lifted her chin, schooling her features into neutrality. Nathan looked down at her, his lips parting slightly.

"Had you been the leading lady, the ending would've been far more... explosive." The hunger in his voice betrayed years of pent-up longing.

Evelyn held his gaze without flinching, though her pulse quickened. She let out a soft laugh. "Perhaps with a different leading man."

Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. The mere suggestion of another man touching what was his sent fury coursing through his veins.

Ignoring his injured leg, he closed the distance between them in one swift motion, pinning Evelyn against the wall with predatory intensity. His body caged hers, leaving no escape.
###Chapter 482 Termination Notice

Nathan's piercing gaze intensified. A flicker of panic flashed through Evelyn's eyes before she glared back at him with visible irritation.

The tension between them was palpable. They stood so close that Evelyn could feel Nathan's warm breath against her skin.

For a brief moment, her heartbeat accelerated. She raised her hands to push him away, but Nathan caught her wrists in an instant. His dark, intense eyes bore into hers as he spoke in a husky whisper.

"Evelyn, tell me what I must do to earn your forgiveness." The raw vulnerability in his voice felt like he was offering her his still-beating heart. Evelyn tilted her chin up to meet his gaze.

An electric current seemed to shoot through her chest.

After a weighted pause, she gave a humorless laugh. "Mr. Blackwood, spare yourself the effort. I never look back at what I've left behind." Her voice was as cold as marble. Just then, approaching footsteps interrupted the charged moment.

Who dared intrude now? "Ms. Sinclair," came Preston Sinclair's smooth voice, "curtain call approaches. Shall I escort you back?" His timely arrival anchored her wavering resolve against Nathan's emotional onslaught.

With calculated calm, Evelyn extracted herself from Nathan's grasp. Her eyes remained frosty. "Thank you, Mr. Sinclair." She deliberately ignored Nathan's burning stare as she took Preston's arm, disappearing into the waiting elevator.

The sensation of Nathan's dagger-like gaze followed them until the doors closed. Nathan fought to control the storm of emotions threatening to consume him as he watched her walk away.

The terrifying realization that he might truly lose her forever tightened its grip. Fear, desperation, and panic warred within him - yet he remained silent.

Only after long minutes did his clenched fists finally relax.

Morning sunlight streamed through Evelyn's balcony as birdsong filled the air. The lush trees provided dappled shade as she stretched before heading to Sterling Corporation early.

Evelyn's office wardrobe reflected her confidence - sometimes sleek skirts, other times tailored separates. She never conformed to corporate stereotypes of power dressing. Who would dare comment?

Bennett entered with documents just as Evelyn sipped her coffee, the rich aroma soothing her. She set down the cup with a satisfied smile. "Before anything else today, inform HR to terminate Victoria Ashford immediately."

Bennett blinked in surprise but quickly schooled his expression. "Additionally," Evelyn continued, "research all upcoming projects Ashford Group is pursuing. Acquire any promising ones."

Though curious, Bennett knew better than to question. "Understood, Ms. Sinclair." He exited promptly.

Evelyn rarely acted so decisively without cause. For Victoria to be dismissed within three days meant she'd crossed an unforgivable line.

Most society women in such positions received graceful exits. But Evelyn's public termination and subsequent business moves delivered a calculated humiliation to Ashford Group.

After a morning of meetings and lunch with Alexander, Evelyn returned to find Bennett waiting. "Victoria Ashford has been in the lobby for two hours demanding to see you before leaving."

Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Death throes of the guilty? She should have considered consequences earlier." Dismissively, she waved her hand. "Send her away. I won't waste another moment on her."

Bennett nodded - he'd expected nothing less. This was merely protocol before having security remove their unwelcome guest.
###Chapter 483 No More Excuses

Sterling Corporation's executive lounge.

Victoria Ashford sat frozen in her seat, her face drained of color. The termination notice hadn't been officially announced yet, but the writing was on the wall.

Reginald Ashford had pulled countless strings to secure her position at Sterling Corp. Victoria couldn't bear imagining his reaction when he discovered she'd ruined everything.

She'd clawed her way up from being the illegitimate daughter, nearly escaping her past demons. Now she teetered on the edge of an abyss - one misstep away from complete destruction.

"Ms. Ashford." Bennett's voice snapped her back to reality. She jumped to her feet, pulse racing.

"Madam Sinclair has back-to-back meetings today with no available openings." Bennett's professional tone offered no comfort. "You should leave now."

Victoria's hands trembled. "This makes no sense. Why am I being fired without warning?" A desperate hope flickered that her misdeeds remained undiscovered.

Yesterday's humiliation by Nathan Blackwood still burned fresh. But as long as she remained at Sterling Corp, there was still a chance. She refused to surrender.

Bennett's lips curved into a humorless smile. "Perhaps you should reflect on what you did to offend Madam Sinclair."

He didn't need explanations. Evelyn Sinclair's wrath spoke volumes, and Bennett knew exactly how to handle troublesome individuals. Victoria's face turned ghostly pale.

Her stomach dropped. How had Evelyn uncovered everything so quickly? Victoria bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. "I demand to see Madam Sinclair personally. Whatever grievances she has, I'll make amends."

She adopted the perfect wounded expression - the picture of unjust persecution. Bennett remained impassive. "No apologies necessary, Ms. Ashford. Your punishment is termination."

"Return to being the Ashford heiress. Madam Sinclair runs an empire - she hasn't the patience for petty employee disputes."

Panic set in. "My father is Reginald Ashford! Is this how Evelyn treats the Ashford family?"

Bennett's gaze turned glacial. "Then by all means, have Chairman Ashford take this up with Madam Sinclair." He signaled nearby security. "Escort Ms. Ashford out."

The humiliation burned like acid. In that moment, Victoria understood the brutal truth - she was merely the daughter of Ashford Group's chairman, while Evelyn Sinclair commanded an entire corporate kingdom.

They existed in different stratospheres. Evelyn didn't even deem her worthy of a confrontation.

Outside Sterling Tower's gleaming facade, the midday sun offered no warmth. An icy dread crept up Victoria's spine as she realized - Evelyn hadn't bothered with explanations because she already knew everything.

No theatrics. No dramatic confrontation. Just swift, merciless execution.

Collapsing onto the plaza steps, Victoria stared up at the monolithic skyscraper - a cold, unfeeling beast that had spat her out. The message was clear: she never belonged there in the first place.
###Chapter 484 Swept Out the Door

Victoria Ashford's schemes were laid bare under the harsh light of day.

There was no hiding now. She remained seated until sunset, too terrified to move.

Victoria had imagined countless scenarios of how Evelyn Sinclair might react.

Would Evelyn rage at her? Would she scream, or perhaps even strike her? Victoria's true target had always been Nathan Blackwood—something Evelyn knew all too well.

Surely, Evelyn would treat her differently because of that. But in this moment, Victoria realized with crushing clarity that she meant nothing to Evelyn.

Just as Evelyn had hired her without hesitation, she could just as easily discard her.

Evelyn strode confidently from her office in sleek stilettos, flanked by her bodyguard and assistant. Department heads hurried alongside her, seeking her guidance on urgent matters.

Their expressions were a mix of deference and sycophancy.

That commanding presence—the kind of power Victoria could never hope to possess—made her suddenly aware of the vast chasm between them.

Even if Victoria were legitimized as the chairman's daughter, the ugliness in her soul would never compare to Evelyn's unshakable integrity.

At that moment, Victoria lost all courage to face Evelyn.

She was already a joke. Why give Evelyn the satisfaction of laughing in her face? Victoria turned on her heel and fled in the opposite direction.

At Blackwood Enterprises, Harrison noticed Nathan's foul mood had worsened in recent days. His decisions had become ruthless, his tone icy. Clearly, things weren't progressing well with Evelyn.

Employees delivered their reports with trepidation. By evening, Harrison knocked on Nathan's office door.

"Mr. Blackwood," he said carefully, "I've just received word that Sterling Corporation terminated an employee today."

Nathan barely glanced up. Harrison wouldn't bother him with trivial firings—unless it was significant.

"It's Victoria Ashford," Harrison added.

A flicker of disgust crossed Nathan's face. His voice was glacial.

"She deserves worse."

Harrison hesitated before continuing. "Madam Blackwood called. She wants Victoria to work here, since she has nowhere else to go."

The temperature in the room plummeted. Nathan's expression darkened, his jaw tightening.

"This company does not accept trash," he said, each word sharp as a blade.

Harrison nodded. "Understood." He'd have to find a way to handle Margaret Blackwood's request.

After a beat, Nathan spoke again, his tone indifferent. "Evict her from the apartment my mother arranged. I never want to see her again."

Harrison stiffened. Nathan's patience had run out. "Yes, sir." He didn't dare ask questions—just turned and left.

When Victoria received no response from Blackwood Enterprises, she returned to her apartment—only to find a polite but firm middle-aged man waiting at her door.

"Ms. Ashford," he said, "this property has been reclaimed. You'll need to vacate by tomorrow morning."

Victoria paled. "Madam Blackwood leased this place for me."

"We're acting on direct orders," the man replied. "The apartment will be cleared regardless of your presence."

An ultimatum.

"Am I being thrown out?" Victoria whispered. Who would dare defy Margaret's orders?

She already knew the answer.

She had crossed Nathan Blackwood one too many times.

With no other choice, Victoria packed her belongings that night and slunk back to the Ashford estate in disgrace.
###Chapter 485 The Disaster You've Created Victoria Ashford

Victoria Ashford knew something was wrong the moment she stepped through the gates. Penelope Ashford's sleek black Mercedes was parked in the driveway, meaning her half-sister had returned home.

Normally, Penelope would announce her presence with dramatic flair, ensuring the entire household knew of her arrival. This eerie silence was unnatural.

The quiet made Victoria's pulse quicken. As she pushed open the front door, a crystal vase came flying toward her face. She barely dodged in time, but the heavy base still struck her shoulder. Pain shot through her body as cold sweat beaded on her forehead.

Looking up, she saw them - Penelope and Reginald Ashford seated on the velvet sofa, their expressions glacial.

"You dare show your face here?" Penelope's voice dripped venom. "After the catastrophe you've caused?"

Victoria's blood ran cold. Her father's eyes held nothing but disgust.

Penelope advanced like a predator, her designer heels clicking against the marble. "We sent you to seduce Nathan Blackwood, not to humiliate our family!"

Victoria's knees trembled. The Ashford mansion's opulence suddenly felt like a gilded cage.

Penelope's perfectly manicured nails dug into Victoria's arm. "Haven't you spent your whole life dreaming of climbing the social ladder? Couldn't even keep a man interested? You're as useless as your gold-digging mother."

To high society, Penelope was the picture of elegance. Only Victoria saw this cruel side - the vicious half-sister who'd tormented her since childhood.

Reginald remained silent, his disapproval radiating like winter frost. He'd always treated Victoria as the family's dirty secret.

Victoria bit her lip until she tasted blood. How much did they know? Had news of her humiliating rejection spread already?

Penelope yanked Victoria's hair brutally. "Speak! Or are you too ashamed to explain how you single-handedly destroyed our biggest deal?"

Victoria's vision swam as Penelope shoved her to the floor. The impact sent fresh waves of pain through her body. She looked desperately toward Reginald, but found no mercy in his cold stare.

"Your sister speaks truth," Reginald finally said. "The Stanton Corporation took our half-year project because of you. Evelyn Sinclair made it clear - this was punishment for your behavior."

Victoria's breath caught. That night flashed through her mind - standing nearly naked before Nathan Blackwood, only to be dismissed like common trash. The memory burned as painfully as her father's contempt.

She curled into herself, sobbing. This life of luxury, even with its cruelties, was better than the poverty she'd escaped. Better to endure their abuse than return to being nobody.

"I tried everything," Victoria whispered through tears. "Nathan Blackwood wouldn't look at me. I couldn't—"

Penelope's laugh cut like broken glass. "Failing with Blackwood is one thing. But provoking Evelyn Sinclair? That stupidity cost us millions."

Victoria's stomach dropped. The weight of her failure pressed down until she could barely breathe. The Ashfords' wrath was only beginning, and she had nowhere left to hide.
###Chapter 486 You're Not Qualified

Penelope Ashford's face twisted in frustration as she confronted Victoria Ashford. She could no longer contain her anger and delivered a stinging slap across Victoria's cheek.

"This is all your doing! What exactly did you say to upset Evelyn Sinclair?" Penelope's voice dripped with venom. "The entire elite circle is mocking me for having such an incompetent sister!"

The high society circles were tight-knit, and word traveled fast.

Ashford Group might have been influential domestically, but it paled in comparison to the global powerhouse that was Sterling Worldwide.

Penelope knew Evelyn moved in entirely different circles - the crème de la crème of international society that she could only dream of joining.

Victoria's cheek burned from the impact, but the humiliation cut deeper.

So Evelyn had known all along about Victoria's schemes.

Rather than confronting Victoria directly, Evelyn had gone straight to Ashford Group, forcing the entire family to bear responsibility for Victoria's actions. This was Evelyn's way of demonstrating the vast gulf between them.

With one casual move, Evelyn had rendered both Victoria and Ashford Group powerless to retaliate. The message was clear - Evelyn played in a league far beyond their reach.

Seeing Victoria's pitiful expression reminded Penelope of her stepmother's similar look when she'd destroyed their family. The memory only fueled her rage further.

Penelope delivered a sharp kick to Victoria's shin. "Out with it! What exactly did you do?"

With no other choice, Victoria confessed everything.

At Sterling Worldwide headquarters, Evelyn was reviewing departmental reports when Bennett entered her office. "Ms. Sterling."

Evelyn nodded to the department head, who took the cue to exit immediately.

Bennett cleared his throat. "Chairman Ashford just called. Victoria Ashford wishes to apologize in person. They're also inquiring about potential collaboration."

A dry chuckle escaped Evelyn's lips.

When Nathan Blackwood had first introduced her to Reginald Ashford, the man had been so arrogant, believing Ferguson Corporation's backing made him untouchable.

Looking back, the memory was both amusing and pathetic.

"Why is Ashford Group panicking over such a minor project withdrawal? They're being rather... desperate."

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with calculation. "Forget about collaboration. Sterling Worldwide has no interest."

Bennett immediately grasped her meaning. "Understood, Ms. Sterling. Though we shouldn't underestimate their influence."

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Ashford Group isn't the only player in town. Their biggest competitor, Kensington Group, has already reached out. Feel free to share that information with the Ashfords."

Evelyn wasn't concerned about burning bridges or lost opportunities.

Reginald Ashford had shown his true colors by sending his daughter to Sterling Worldwide without proper protocol - a clear sign of disrespect.

If Ashford Group couldn't be bothered with basic business etiquette, Evelyn saw no reason to entertain them.

Bennett nodded briskly. "Consider it done."

Satisfied, Evelyn glanced at her phone to find a voice message from Oliver Sinclair.

"Pretty Lady! I want to take you to a fancy candlelit dinner!" Oliver's sugary voice melted Evelyn's resolve.

She couldn't bring herself to refuse the adorable request. "It's a date!" she replied, realizing how much she'd missed the little boy.

Remembering Oliver's fondness for Leo, Evelyn immediately contacted Lucas to arrange for the AI tiger's delivery.

Within fifteen minutes, Lucas Sterling made his dramatic entrance at Sterling Worldwide headquarters - sunglasses perched on his perfect nose, stepping out of a flashy sports car that turned every head in the building.

His breathtaking appearance quickly became the hottest topic across social media.

When Lucas spotted his sister, he ran a hand through his artfully tousled hair with exaggerated flair.

"Sigh. What must I do to be just a little less dazzling?" He flashed a megawatt smile. "You should capitalize on this free publicity. Got any new diamond collections needing endorsement?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Our new line targets innocent young consumers. If we put your scandalous face on it, we'd lose millions this quarter!"

Lucas's smile froze into a comical grimace.
###Chapter 487 Daddy's Helping

The sleek black limousine idled near Sterling Tower. Inside, a nanny and bodyguard flanked the golden-haired Oliver Sinclair, their postures rigid as schoolchildren awaiting inspection.

Opposite them sat Preston Sinclair, who had invited himself along despite his son's protests.

Only Oliver dared voice his displeasure. "Daddy, get out! This is my date with Muse!" The five-year-old crossed his arms, puffing out his chest in what he believed was an intimidating stance.

Preston finished typing an email before glancing up. "I have business with Ms. Sterling," he said smoothly. "Consider me... moral support."

"No way!" Oliver's tiny brows knitted together. "No third wheels allowed! Not even you!"

A dangerous glint flashed in Preston's eyes. "Would you prefer Nathaniel Blackwood crashing your date instead?"

Oliver's bravado faltered. "That meanie? Never!"

"Exactly." Preston adjusted his cufflinks. "Family sticks together. If Muse likes me, she'll adore you twice as much."

Oliver chewed his lip. The logic was sound—Daddy was marginally better than that scowling Mr. Blackwood. But still...

"I can charm Muse myself!" he declared. "You just focus on making money so we can live in your penthouse later!"

Preston's jaw tightened. Patience. He's your heir. Through gritted teeth, he hissed, "No inheritance if I'm uninvited."

Oliver gasped. The ultimatum hung between them like a guillotine.

"Fine," the boy muttered, shooting his father a glare that promised future revenge. "But no funny business!"

The car door swung open. "Muse!" Oliver launched himself at Evelyn before she could process the scene. She caught him with a laugh, inhaling his sugary scent.

"My, haven't you grown handsome?" She booped his nose, making him giggle and bury his face in her neck.

Preston cleared his throat. "He's usually more... feral."

Evelyn startled at his voice. "Mr. Sinclair?"

Preston offered a practiced smile. "Oliver insisted I join you both tonight."

The boy's head snapped up. Liar!

"Muse," Oliver whispered urgently, clinging to her blouse. "Say the word and I'll have Marcus toss him out." His hopeful gaze pleaded: Choose me!
###Chapter 488 A Family of Three

Leo bristled with indignation. How dare this child question my authenticity as a tiger! The AI tiger flicked its tail angrily, suddenly finding little Oliver far less adorable than before.

Oliver Sinclair scrunched his nose in suspicion. To test the tiger's legitimacy, he grabbed a piece of beef jerky from the table and shoved it toward Leo's mouth. "Prove you're real then, kitty!" Leo desperately struggled against the boy's grip but found itself powerless. The humiliation burned.

Just as Evelyn Sinclair moved to intervene, Leo waved its front paws frantically. "I can't eat! I'm synthetic!" The once-proud tiger's dignity evaporated under a child's scrutiny. With a defeated flick of its fur, Leo slumped in Oliver's arms, shooting Evelyn a wounded look.

"Mama didn't defend me..." The thought made Leo's ears droop as Evelyn quietly resumed eating. Since Preston Sinclair had previously shown interest in her, she carefully masked any discomfort.

Neither adult acknowledged their earlier encounter, though Preston occasionally placed choice morsels on Evelyn and Oliver's plates with attentive care. Evelyn felt the weight of Preston's lingering gaze but maintained perfect composure. After dinner, the father-son duo escorted Evelyn home.

Exhausted from the evening, Oliver fell asleep during the drive. Evelyn stepped out cradling Leo while Preston retrieved her package, offering an apologetic smile.

"Oliver still doesn't understand white chrysanthemums symbolize mourning. I'll educate him properly," Preston murmured. Evelyn chuckled. "Children mean no harm." Preston's smile turned tentative. "Perhaps roses next time?" The unspoken question hung between them.

Evelyn understood instantly - roses meant romance. "I'd prefer a cactus. The kind that keeps people at arm's length." Preston laughed, ducking his head. "I excel at accommodating preferences."

Meanwhile at Highland Estates...
The excitable husky pounced on Nathan Blackwood the moment he entered. Nathan shoved the dog aside with his cane, scowling. "Didn't Tristan take this mutt yet?" Theodore "Teddy" Winslow chased the dog with a food bowl.

"Mrs. Whitmore returned but dislikes dogs, so Master Tristan asked us to keep it here temporarily." Nathan's expression darkened. "Tristan enjoys inconveniencing me." He dialed angrily.

"Damn it, Tris, are you blind now?" "Meaning?" "Evelyn and Preston took his son to a Michelin-starred dinner. They bought out the entire restaurant - looked like a perfect little family." Nathan's eyes turned glacial.

"Are they still there?" His voice vibrated with suppressed rage. "No, they left together." Tristan tried elaborating but Nathan hung up abruptly, fury radiating from every pore.

Teddy approached cautiously with the husky, having overheard everything. "Mr. Blackwood..." Nathan's glare could freeze lava. "I don't care how you do it. Get Evelyn here now."

Teddy's matchmaking failures weighed heavily. These weren't ordinary people. "I don't think-" Nathan's icy stare cut him off. "Feeling immortal today, Teddy?" The butler backpedaled. "No problem at all!"

As Nathan stormed upstairs, Teddy collapsed onto the floor. "Since when did Mr. Blackwood become so terrifying? And people call him easy-going!" He frantically dialed Evelyn, voice trembling. "Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Blackwood just took a nasty fall down the stairs..."
###Chapter 489 Hands Off

Evelyn Sinclair was just settling into bed when her phone buzzed urgently. Theodore "Teddy" Winslow's name flashed on the screen, sending her heart racing. Without hesitation, she grabbed her coat and dashed out the door.

Guilt gnawed at her as she remembered Nathan Blackwood's injured leg.

What if his limp became permanent because of her? The thought of owing him for eternity made her stomach churn.

Marcus drove with such speed that the usual twenty-minute journey was halved.

The Highland Estates loomed before them in record time. Teddy greeted her at the entrance, his face pale with worry.

"Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood took a nasty fall down the staircase. He's burning up with fever now!"

Evelyn's pulse quickened at the news. "Have you called a physician?"

Teddy shifted uncomfortably. "Yes, but... there was an accident en route. The doctor will be delayed."

He wrung his hands. "Perhaps you could... assist in the meantime?"

Evelyn hurried to Nathan's chambers. The sight that greeted her stole her breath - the powerful CEO lay vulnerable, his usually tanned complexion ghostly pale. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead while Leo, his AI tiger companion, anxiously chewed on a discarded cane nearby.

"How does a simple fall cause such fever?" Evelyn frowned, turning to Teddy.

The butler fidgeted nervously. "Ms. Sinclair, you're the only one he'll listen to. Please, you must stay."

Against her better judgment, Evelyn reached out.

The moment her fingers brushed Nathan's forehead, an iron grip clamped around her wrist. Nathan's eyes flew open - dark, intense, and startlingly alert despite his apparent weakness.

"Evelyn," his voice was rough yet laced with something dangerously close to hope. "You came."

She schooled her features into neutrality. "I'm responsible for your injury. Of course I'd check on you."

Nathan's expression darkened. His jaw tightened before softening into something almost... vulnerable.

"Good. Having you here... settles me."

He closed his eyes quickly, but not before Evelyn caught a flash of something unsettling in his gaze.

Teddy hovered nearby with ice packs and towels, looking torn. "Ms. Sinclair, we must bring his fever down before—"

Before he could finish, the butler thrust the supplies into Evelyn's hands.

"Oh dear! I just remembered - I must fetch that delayed doctor!"

With that, Teddy bolted from the room with surprising speed for a man his age.

Evelyn turned to Marcus, who stood silently in the shadows.

"Miss, allow me—"

Before she could respond, Nathan's hand shot out again, gripping her wrist with surprising strength.

"No." His voice was sharp, his glare fixed on Marcus. "I don't need assistance. And I won't have anyone else touching me."

The unspoken challenge hung heavy in the air.

Marcus remained impassive, awaiting only Evelyn's command.

After a tense moment, she nodded. "Go assist Teddy. I'll manage here."

As Marcus departed, the room plunged into heavy silence. Evelyn picked up the ice pack with resigned determination.

"Let me help you," she murmured, steeling herself against the storm of emotions Nathan always stirred within her.
###Chapter 490 Hands Off

Evelyn Sinclair had just settled into bed when her phone buzzed urgently. It was Teddy calling. Her heart leaped into her throat as she grabbed her purse and sprinted out the door.

Guilt gnawed at her when she pictured Nathan Blackwood's injured leg.

If his limp became permanent because of her actions, she'd carry that burden forever.

Marcus drove like a man possessed, cutting the usual twenty-minute trip in half.

They arrived at Highland Estates in record time. Evelyn barely crossed the threshold before Teddy came rushing toward her, panic written across his face.

"Ms. Sinclair! Mr. Blackwood took a terrible fall down the staircase!"

Her stomach dropped. "Is he—"

"He's running a high fever and unconscious now!" Teddy wrung his hands.

Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs. "Did you call a doctor?"

Teddy hesitated just a beat too long. "Yes, but... there was an accident en route. The physician will be delayed."

Without another word, Evelyn marched toward Nathan's bedroom.

The sight that greeted her stole her breath. Nathan lay motionless, his usually tanned complexion ghostly pale. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead. His breathing came shallow and rapid.

A massive Siberian tiger—Leo—paced anxiously at the foot of the bed, occasionally gnawing on Nathan's abandoned cane.

"How does a simple fall cause this?" Evelyn frowned.

Teddy shifted from foot to foot. "Ms. Sinclair, you must stay. Mr. Blackwood only calms for you."

Against her better judgment, Evelyn reached out.

The moment her fingers brushed his burning forehead, an iron grip clamped around her wrist. Nathan's eyes flew open—dark, intense, and swimming with feverish confusion.

"Evelyn." His voice scraped raw. "You came."

She tried to pull away, but his grip tightened.

"I'm responsible for your injury," she said coolly. "That's all."

Nathan's expression darkened. His jaw clenched.

"Good." His tone softened unnaturally. "Having you here... comforts me."

His eyelids fluttered shut, but not before Evelyn caught a dangerous glint in his gaze.

Teddy hovered nearby with ice packs and towels. "We need to bring his fever down, Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn nodded and moved to step aside, but Teddy thrust the supplies into her hands instead.

"The doctor's still delayed—I must fetch him myself!" He bolted before she could protest.

Evelyn turned to Marcus, who stood sentinel in the corner.

"Miss, allow me—"

Before she could respond, Nathan's hand shot out again, fingers digging into her wrist. His eyes burned with startling clarity.

"No." His voice turned glacial. "I don't need treatment. And I won't have anyone else touching me."

The glare he leveled at Marcus could have melted steel.

Evelyn hesitated, then nodded at her bodyguard. "Go assist Teddy."

The moment the door clicked shut, an oppressive silence blanketed the room.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and reached for the ice pack. "Let me help you."

Nathan's lips curved into a satisfied smile that didn't reach his eyes.
###Chapter 491 Make It Real

A spark of amusement flickered in Nathan's dark eyes.

Then, his expression dimmed. "Never mind."

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow smirked knowingly. "Retreating to advance—classic strategy."

He had to play this carefully.

Evelyn Sinclair pressed the ice pack harder against Nathan's forehead, her brows furrowed.

"It's just a minor fever. Stop being dramatic and wait for the doctor." Nathan's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

"That's all?"

Evelyn nodded curtly.

"Done. Didn't lay a finger on you." She remembered his aversion to being touched all too well. Nathan exhaled sharply and closed his eyes, swallowing his frustration.

The sudden ring of Evelyn's phone sliced through the tension. Nathan's gaze darted to the screen—Preston Sinclair. His chest constricted.

"Who's calling at this hour?" The bitterness in his voice was unmistakable. Jealousy coiled hot and vicious in his gut.

Evelyn barely glanced at him. "Business." She owed him no explanations.

She stood, stepping into the hallway. Nathan watched her go, his fingers digging into the sheets. The urge to follow was unbearable. Silently, he moved to the doorway, straining to listen.

Evelyn answered, her voice softening. "Oliver, sweetheart—"

The words were a knife to Nathan's ribs.

"—Yes, I miss you too, darling." Her affectionate murmur was a stark contrast to the ice in her tone moments ago. Nathan's hands clenched at his sides.

When she reentered, Nathan was blocking her path, his silk pajamas disheveled. The black fabric made his pallor more pronounced, his eyes burning with a dangerous mix of hurt and fury.

Evelyn froze. "You—"

Nathan cut her off, his voice rough. "It's just business with him, right?" His restraint was fraying, the edges of his vision tinged red. He needed to hear her say it—needed and dreaded it in equal measure.

Evelyn studied him for a heartbeat too long. Then her gaze dropped—to his legs.

Standing. Without his cane.

The realization hit like a thunderclap.

No relapse. No fever-induced weakness. Just another lie.

A sharp bark drew her attention—Leo, their husky, was happily gnawing Nathan's abandoned cane on the balcony, oblivious to the storm between them.

All pity evaporated. Rage took its place.

"Nathan Blackwood," she hissed, "you lying bastard."

Her voice was arctic. "Who said anything about pretending? We're making it real."

Nathan's pupils dilated. The raw pain in his eyes should have gutted her. It didn't.

Not when his deception was laid bare.

"Don't ruin my evening," she spat, turning on her heel. One more second here, and she might actually break his other leg.

Nathan moved faster than she anticipated. His hands seized her shoulders, pinning her against the wall.

His lips trembled, but his touch was featherlight as he tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear—gentling her like a skittish animal.

"Don't go," he murmured, voice fraying. "I'm still sick. Still need you." The plea was velvet-wrapped steel, his bloodshot eyes betraying the storm beneath.

His fingers shook against her skin.

Begging.

Falling apart.
###Chapter 492 Make Her Happy

Nathan was terrified. The thought of losing Evelyn forever sent chills down his spine.

He forced himself to stay calm. Even if Evelyn chose Preston, it didn't matter.

There were countless ways he could keep her bound to him forever.

Evelyn pushed him away with surprising strength, easily overpowering Nathan who was still pretending to be injured. "Then enjoy being sick," she scoffed. "The doctor will be here shortly."

As she descended the grand staircase of Highland Estates, she nearly collided with Teddy and the arriving physician. Their expressions were carefully neutral, though not particularly concerned.

Had Evelyn not already suspected Nathan's deception, she might have missed the subtle signs. Marcus followed close behind them, his stern face unreadable as he urged them forward.

"Ms. Sinclair!" Teddy exclaimed upon seeing her. "What do you need? Allow me to fetch it for you. There's no need for you to—"

Evelyn silenced him with an icy glare before turning to Marcus. "Let's go."

"Yes, Miss."

Teddy froze as Nathan came rushing down the stairs behind them—without his cane. The realization hit Teddy instantly. Mr. Blackwood had recovered completely! When had this happened?

But Nathan paid no attention to his shocked expression. Evelyn and Marcus were already out the door, leaving Nathan standing helplessly in the foyer.

When his gaze shifted to Teddy and the doctor, his eyes were eerily calm. "She's upset."

Teddy thought, Of course she is! The doctor shifted uncomfortably. "Mr. Blackwood, should I still—"

Nathan cut him off with a sharp glance. "No need." The doctor quickly retreated the way he had come.

Teddy stood rooted in place, feeling the oppressive chill radiating from Nathan. He didn't dare move. There was nothing he could do—Evelyn and Nathan were both forces of nature.

"Mr. Blackwood, perhaps you should rest upstairs?" Teddy suggested weakly. He had successfully lured Evelyn here, only for Nathan to ruin everything. If Evelyn was angry, would Nathan take it out on him? Knowing Nathan, it was entirely possible.

Upstairs, the husky was dragging Nathan's abandoned cane toward its bed, step by step. The sound drew Nathan's attention. His gaze darkened as he stared at the cane, realization dawning. That was why Evelyn's attitude had shifted so abruptly.

He glanced down at his legs. He had hidden his recovery for so long, using it to keep Evelyn close—only for it to be exposed so carelessly.

Frustration coiled tightly in his chest. He cursed under his breath, furious at his own body for healing too quickly. If he chased after Evelyn now, she would only grow angrier. Forgiveness was out of the question.

Though the thought of Evelyn meeting Preston Sinclair made his blood boil, Nathan knew he was in the wrong. He couldn't act recklessly.

He would have to find another way to make this right.

Days later, Evelyn and William were fishing by the lake at Sterling Manor when Isabella bounded over, beaming. "Uncle William! Evelyn! I'm throwing a party to celebrate my new relationship!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes and shot William a pointed look—She needs to tone it down.

William chuckled. "Isabella, this is your fourth celebration this month. And with a different man each time. You're certainly keeping busy!"
###Chapter 493 His Doppelgänger

Evelyn Sinclair knew William Sterling was just teasing her.

She didn't take offense and cheerfully tugged at Isabella Montgomery's arm.

"I'm creating opportunities for you," William murmured under his breath.

"If she socializes more, she won't be so easily manipulated!" The thought amused him. Evelyn shot Isabella an exasperated look. "I have a business dinner tonight. You go ahead with your celebration."

Just thinking about Isabella's parties gave Evelyn a migraine. Endless trays of gourmet food and expensive champagne—things she'd long grown indifferent to. Closing another deal sounded far more appealing.

Isabella plopped down beside Evelyn, lowering her voice conspiratorially. "This time is different. I've prepared a special surprise!" Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "International male supermodels—your exact type. You have to come see!"

Evelyn gave her a deadpan stare.

Supermodels? Isabella, who couldn't be bothered to learn the basics of their family business, somehow had encyclopedic knowledge of the modeling world. Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Nearby, William pretended intense fascination with the koi pond, though his shoulders shook with silent laughter. "Evie, why waste time with stuffy businessmen? Send Alexander instead. Go have fun with Bella—and don't come home early!"

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, suspecting he'd overheard Isabella's whisper. Before she could protest, Isabella dragged her toward the door. "Don't worry, Uncle William! We'll be back before midnight!"

William waved them off. "Take your time!" The household staff exchanged knowing glances.

Velvet Lounge, Private Room

Evelyn entered behind Isabella to find Natalie Beaumont and Sebastian Hart lounging on plush sofas, scrolling through their phones.

The room's centerpiece was impossible to miss—a curated selection of male models, some globally recognized faces among them.

Their collective gaze snapped to Evelyn the moment she stepped in. Instant regret flooded her.

Isabella blocked her escape route, nudging her forward.

Evelyn's fitted black dress accentuated every curve. The smoky eye makeup softened her usual icy demeanor, transforming her into someone entirely different tonight.

Natalie waved drunkenly, cheeks flushed. "You're finally here!" She patted the seat beside her.

Evelyn sat, arching a brow. "How many have you had?"

Natalie leaned in, breath warm against Evelyn's ear. "I found your perfect gift." With a dramatic flourish, she gestured toward the shadowed corner.

A lone figure sat there, his silhouette strikingly familiar.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Nathan Blackwood?

But when the man turned, the differences became apparent. Softer brows. Warmer eyes lacking Nathan's calculating sharpness. He carried the fresh-faced innocence of a recent graduate, though his bone structure bore an uncanny resemblance—far more than Adrian Blackwood, Nathan's own nephew.

"Meet Xavier Delmont," Isabella announced proudly. "International runway model. I discovered him during Paris Fashion Week."

Natalie beamed. "Isn't he perfect?"

The young man approached hesitantly. Up close, his clean-cut handsomeness was undeniable—though he lacked Nathan's commanding presence. "Ms. Sinclair," he greeted politely.

Evelyn forced a smile before whirling on Natalie. "You know how I feel about that man! Why would you bring me his carbon copy?"
###Chapter 494 The Socialite's Hidden Truth

Isabella Montgomery gave Evelyn Sinclair's shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

"If you despise him, just treat Xavier Delmont as Nathan Blackwood's doppelgänger and make him suffer."

"If you fancy him, obsess over Xavier to drive Nathan insane! Either way," she winked, "you come out on top."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "You two really are my ride-or-dies, aren't you?"

"Damn right we are!" The best friends chorused in perfect sync.

Sebastian Hart, lounging nearby, let out a derisive snort. "You women only know how to stir up trouble." He scooted closer to Evelyn with sudden enthusiasm. "Say, darling, want to hear a brilliant business proposition?"

Natalie Beaumont rolled her eyes. "Sebastian, this better not be another one of your harebrained schemes."

The man grinned shamelessly as he scrolled through his phone. "I've got eight hundred pounds of organic potatoes that need selling. Fancy helping me move them at your next fashion show?"

Evelyn's mouth fell open in disbelief.

Natalie's icy glare could have frozen lava. "You want me to peddle your farm produce at Lumière's Paris Fashion Week showcase? Are you out of your mind?"

Sebastian pouted. "What's wrong with that? Don't fashionistas eat? Don't they... you know... digest?"

Evelyn sighed, tuning out her eccentric friends' bickering. Her attention kept drifting to the striking man beside her - not Nathan, yet his presence felt just as suffocating. Every breath came slightly quicker, her pulse fluttering like a trapped bird.

Perhaps this was the lingering trauma of her marriage. Needing air, Evelyn rose to step outside, only to find the exit blocked by a swarm of reporters with flashing cameras.

The entire room tensed. Natalie, slightly tipsy, positioned herself protectively in front of Evelyn.

"What's the meaning of this?" she demanded.

"Ms. Beaumont! We heard international supermodels are flocking to Montecito for career opportunities. Care to comment on negotiations?"

"Who's signed so far? Will Ms. Sinclair be involved?"

"Is this really a business meeting or just rich women playing with their toys?"

One reporter's particularly salacious question silenced the room.

Evelyn didn't need to be psychic to know they'd been set up. Whether the target was her, Natalie, Sebastian, or Isabella - each was gossip gold. Some ambitious model had clearly sold them out for fame.

The potential headlines made her nauseous: "Socialites' Wild Orgy" or "Heiresses' Dirty Secrets." Either would devastate their businesses.

Evelyn's gaze swept the male models present. Their varied expressions gave nothing away. Isabella had gone pale, hiding behind Sebastian, who looked equally horrified at another scandal brewing. The man just wanted to be a respectable trust fund baby!

The reporters showed no signs of leaving.

"Commercial secrets," Natalie snapped, blocking the doorway. "Wait for the press conference."

She reached for her phone to call security, but the media pack surged forward.

"Let us see who's inside!"

"Come out for interviews!"

The situation was spiraling out of control.
###Chapter 495 Marry Into the Blackwood Family

The journalists were determined not to leave without a story.

Evelyn inhaled deeply before pushing open the door, her practiced smile perfectly balanced between warmth and professionalism.

"This is merely preliminary discussions," she began smoothly. "We're considering a talent competition featuring internationally acclaimed supermodels as guest judges. However, all details remain strictly confidential at this stage."

Isabella visibly relaxed beside her. Evelyn had always possessed that rare ability to deflect without seeming evasive.

The reporters immediately swarmed forward. "Ms. Sterling, which contestant impresses you most?" one called out.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Every single one."

Their laughter was tinged with nervousness - none dared risk offending the Sterling heiress. Pushing too hard might cost them their careers.

"Then we'll eagerly await your announcement!" they chorused before dispersing.

As the crowd thinned, both women exhaled in relief. Then Evelyn's expression darkened.

Isabella nodded sharply. She knew exactly what needed to be done.

The models were dismissed. Sebastian and Adrian exchanged relieved glances - unlike Evelyn and Isabella, they couldn't afford to alienate their sponsors.

When the room cleared, Isabella clung to Evelyn's arm dramatically. "Next time we're holding auditions in a bunker! These vultures are insufferable!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "When will you learn?"

Isabella merely huffed, already brushing off the incident.

Natalie began contacting each model's agent with strict confidentiality orders. Someone had clearly leaked today's location, and she intended to find out who.

The winter wind sliced through Evelyn's coat as she exited the building. She was nearly to her car when a voice stopped her.

"Ms. Sterling?"

She turned, momentarily startled before regaining composure. "Xavier?" The resemblance was uncanny - that face so like Nathan's it made her chest tighten.

Xavier stepped forward, opening her car door with practiced grace. His hand shielded the frame as she entered. "Safe travels home," he murmured with a smile.

"Thank you." Evelyn drove off without another glance, unaware of the camera flashes from a darkened window above.

Meanwhile, across town...

Nathan sat brooding at a private club with his inner circle. His mood was so foul even Tristan hesitated to speak.

"Mate, maybe it's time to let Evelyn go," one ventured cautiously.

Nathan's glare could have frozen lava. "Never."

Tristan approached with two glasses. "What did my Alaskan malamute ever do to you? Why's he limping now?"

Nathan downed his whiskey in one swallow. That damned dog. If it hadn't chewed his cane that morning, he wouldn't have forgotten it entirely. The mutt had ruined his entire strategy. Next time he saw it...

Another friend, a self-proclaimed dating expert, leaned in. "Play hard to get, Nathan. Women appreciate the chase. You're acting desperate."

Tristan nodded sagely. "The whole circuit's talking. They're saying you're trying to marry into the Sterling family!" He shuddered dramatically. "The indignity!"

Nathan's grip tightened on his glass. "They're gossiping about me?" His voice dripped menace.

"Relax," Tristan clapped his shoulder. "We'll handle Preston Sinclair for you."

Nathan scoffed. As if Tristan's crowd could touch a titan like Preston.
###Chapter 496 Who's Problematic?

What an utterly ordinary yet strangely eventful morning! Before Evelyn Sinclair could even open her eyes, her phone was already buzzing with Isabella Montgomery's relentless calls.

Only one person would dare disturb her at this ungodly hour.

She answered with a sleep-roughened voice. "Hello?"

Isabella's words came in a frantic rush. "Eve, you're trending again!"

Evelyn's eyes snapped open, all traces of sleep vanishing instantly.

"Didn't everyone leave last night? Why was Xavier still there? People thought he was Nathan Blackwood and that you'd reconciled, but then Tristan posted photos proving Nathan was elsewhere."

"Now they've identified Xavier." A cold weight settled in Evelyn's stomach. She knew exactly what this meant.

Her past would be dredged up again. Xavier's face would be plastered everywhere. Was he a rebound? A new lover? The tabloid headlines practically wrote themselves.

"I swear Xavier staged this whole thing. What do we do? If I'd known, I never would've let Natalie bring him back to Montecito!" Isabella's voice trembled with regret.

"Don't blame yourself. I'll call Dominic Kingsley to handle damage control." Evelyn kept her tone measured. "Tell Natalie to keep everyone from last night quiet. She should actually produce that talent show now."

Even if it flopped, they needed the pretense.

"Got it." Isabella understood immediately and hung up.

Evelyn scrolled through the news, assessing the damage:

[Is this Nathan Blackwood's doppelgänger? Evelyn found herself a replacement! How pathetic!]

[When Nathan begged for reconciliation, Evelyn preferred finding a lookalike over forgiving him. Who's really at fault here?]

[Stanton heiress gets whatever she wants with a snap of her fingers. Your faves could never!]

[Evelyn's love life is such a mess. Rich girl privilege at its finest. Poor Nathan!]

[Team Evelyn forever! Only queens get celebrity lookalikes!]

[Team Julian!] [Team Ethan!] [Team Adrian!]

The absurd comments made Evelyn groan. She dialed Dominic Kingsley.

He answered on the first ring, sounding equally exasperated. "Ms. Sinclair, I'm already suppressing the story. But be warned - using influence to manipulate news always backfires."

"If we pull it now, it'll look suspicious. This would've blown over in days if Tristan hadn't posted those damn photos. Did you and Nathan have another fight?"

Evelyn ignored the question. "Don't suppress it. Sign Xavier instead."

Not every opportunist deserved to ride her coattails.

"If he wants fame so badly, let's monetize it ourselves." Dominic chuckled darkly. He'd wanted to suggest this but hadn't dared.

"Excellent! I'll contact his agent immediately."

"Don't go easy on him, Dominic. Give him every endorsement, every appearance - let him get addicted to the spotlight."

Dominic understood perfectly. This was temporary. When the hype died, Xavier would be left with nothing.

Not everyone could handle Evelyn Sinclair's level of fame.

"Consider it done. I'll squeeze every last drop of value from him." Dominic's voice turned predatory.

Evelyn smiled. Let Xavier enjoy his fifteen minutes.

The fall would be that much harder.
###Chapter 497 Betrayal Unveiled

Evelyn Sinclair hung up the phone with deliberate calmness, slipping back into her professional demeanor as she prepared for another day at Sterling Corp.

Highland Estates was anything but peaceful that morning.

Theodore "Teddy" Winslow nearly dropped his coffee when the trending scandal flashed across his screen. The rebuttal from Nathan Blackwood's so-called friend made his blood run cold. This wasn't damage control—it was sabotage.

That idiot had turned a golden opportunity to protect Evelyn into a public relations nightmare.

The grainy photos did show someone resembling Nathan escorting Evelyn to her car. Teddy's hands shook as he climbed the stairs to Nathan's private quarters, each step heavier than the last. The man had been drowning himself in bourbon since midnight.

The door swung open to reveal Nathan's bloodshot eyes. "Speak." The single word dripped with menace.

Teddy extended his phone like a peace offering. "Mr. Blackwood, you need to see this."

Five excruciating minutes passed. Nathan's knuckles turned white around the device.

Here he was—the actual man who couldn't win Evelyn back—while some doppelgänger was stealing the narrative. The internet swarmed with performative sympathy, spectators feigning concern while reveling in the drama. The phone shattered against the marble floor before Teddy could blink.

"Harrison!" Nathan's roar echoed through the estate. "Get this buried. Now."

His assistant appeared instantly, eyeing the phone fragments with professional detachment. "Consider it done, sir."

Nathan was already dialing Tristan Whitmore when the call connected. "Don't bother sugarcoating it. Who's the bastard interfering?"

Tristan exhaled sharply. He'd hoped to intercept this disaster. "Zachary Whitmore." Even if he'd lied, Nathan would've uncovered the truth within hours. The Whitmore heir had just signed his family's death warrant.

The call ended abruptly. Nathan's next orders to Harrison were chillingly precise: "Terminate all Whitmore contracts. Every single one."

Meanwhile at Horizon Media, Dominic Young released an expertly crafted statement. Xavier Delmont—their newly signed talent—had merely been discussing his upcoming debut in Montecito's hottest new competition series. Pure coincidence that Evelyn happened to invest in the show. Witnesses could corroborate their brief, professional interaction.

The internet's obsession shifted like weathervanes in a storm. Without official commentary from Blackwood Industries, the conspiracy theories lost steam. Now the outrage targeted "greedy entertainment executives" manufacturing drama—blissfully unaware Horizon answered to Sterling Corp.

Dominic cursed colorfully in his office. At least the publicity would boost ratings. Evelyn hadn't even dignified the scandal with a response, treating it with the indifference of swatting a gnat.

But by nightfall, the real earthquake hit financial news: Nathan Blackwood had acquired the Whitmore Group in its entirety.
###Chapter 498 A Date

The coincidence was too striking to ignore.

After thorough investigations, it was revealed that Zachary Whitmore had been the one to post the photo clearing Nathan's name.

Yet all scrutiny proved pointless. Blackwood Enterprises had meticulously followed every protocol in acquiring the small business.

Many in elite circles considered Nathan's methods excessively harsh.

Whispers circulated about his ruthless approach. Zachary merely shared a photo, yet Nathan had pushed the Whitmore family to the edge of ruin in retaliation. No one dared challenge his wrath.

It served as a stark warning. As the scandal faded, Xavier Delmont emerged into the spotlight.

Though initial impressions of Xavier weren't favorable, his striking resemblance to Nathan Blackwood earned him unexpected supporters.

Dominic Young capitalized on Xavier's sudden fame, scheduling numerous appearances and even arranging live streams during his downtime at Horizon Media.

The project's critical meeting required all four stakeholders' presence.

When Evelyn arrived, Dominic Kingsley, Nathan Blackwood, and Preston Sinclair were already seated in the conference room.

Their gazes remained impassive as she entered, as if unaware of her trending status. Whether intentional or not, Nathan and Preston sat directly opposite each other, each with an empty chair beside them.

Evelyn scanned the room briefly before taking the seat next to Preston without hesitation. Dominic shot Nathan a knowing look. Preston slid the meeting documents toward her with a subtle smile.

"Ms. Sinclair," he began smoothly, "we should congratulate Mr. Blackwood on his full recovery."

Nathan, who had just mustered the courage to speak, stiffened. His eyes darkened as they locked onto Preston with icy disdain.

Is he provoking me on purpose?

Dominic cleared his throat. "Quite right."

Evelyn's lips curved, but her eyes remained cold and mocking. "Congratulations, Mr. Blackwood."

Liar.

Nathan's jaw tightened imperceptibly as he gave a curt nod. "Thank you."

Preston continued, "Actually, I've received interest from several overseas AI investors. While their capital would expand the project significantly, their terms vary drastically."

Dominic frowned. "A massive influx could elevate us—or destroy us if mismanaged. Given core technology protection concerns, I advise caution."

Nathan smirked. "They're vultures circling our success. Even if we consider external funding, we're not desperate yet."

Preston agreed. Evelyn arched a brow but stayed silent.

Throughout the meeting, Evelyn and Preston exchanged knowing glances, their synergy palpable. Nathan sat excluded, bitterness gnawing at him.

As the meeting adjourned, Preston leaned toward Evelyn, voice low. "Lunch, Ms. Sinclair? Any preferences?"

Before she could respond, Dominic interjected, "Count me in."

Nathan's chair scraped back. "Me too."

Evelyn stood, gathering her files. "You three enjoy yourselves. I have prior engagements."

The air thickened. She left without another word.

Dominic exhaled, eyeing Preston. "You could've invited us all. Singling her out makes it seem like a date."

Preston's smile didn't waver as he met Nathan's glare. "Precisely what I intended."
###Chapter 499 Clueless Dominic

Dominic Kingsley couldn't force a smile, the tension in the air was palpable. Nathan Blackwood's piercing gaze locked onto Preston Sinclair's arrogant stare, neither man backing down.

"Some people clearly lack self-awareness." Nathan's voice dripped with icy contempt.

"If you don't have any, why should I?" Preston shot back with equal venom before turning on his heel.

Nathan's bitter laugh echoed through the suddenly frigid lobby of Kingsley Tech. His expression was a dangerous mix of arrogance and barely contained fury.

Evelyn Sinclair stood framed by the floor-to-ceiling windows, phone pressed to her ear. The sunlight caught the golden highlights in her hair as she smiled faintly at whatever was being said on the other end. One hand held her coat draped casually over her shoulder.

She ended the call when she noticed Preston approaching. "Mr. Sinclair, was there something else?"

Preston slipped his hands into his tailored pockets. "Only the most urgent matter of taking you to lunch." His second invitation that day left little room for refusal.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Very well, though it should be my treat this time." She'd only declined earlier to avoid sharing a table with Nathan. Without his presence, she had no objections.

Their departure didn't go unnoticed. From his vantage point upstairs, Nathan watched them leave together, his entire body radiating cold fury. The sight made his chest constrict painfully.

Dominic cleared his throat awkwardly. "Leaving together doesn't necessarily mean anything." The weak consolation did nothing to ease Nathan's stormy expression.

Why hadn't Nathan appreciated Evelyn when they were married if he cared so much now?

The private restaurant Preston chose was nestled in a picturesque suburb, its exclusivity guaranteed by a strict reservation policy. Regular patrons frequented the establishment for its exquisite cuisine and tranquil atmosphere.

Evelyn had visited before with Isabella and friends, but never with Preston. The place was unusually crowded that day, forcing them to navigate through several acquaintances - including Tristan Whitmore and Gregory Thornton.

After brief acknowledgments, they settled in a secluded corner. Preston handed Evelyn a warm towel with practiced grace. "I get the sense my earlier confession made you uncomfortable."

"Mm, somewhat." Evelyn never saw the point in pretense. Anyone would be affected by such a declaration.

Preston chuckled ruefully. "My apologies for being so abrupt, though it achieved the desired effect."

"I don't wish to waste time on meaningless relationships, though I appreciate your intentions, Mr. Sinclair."

"May I ask why you rejected me so decisively? Do you find me lacking in some way?" His sincerity disarmed her slightly.

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "Not at all. For a marriage alliance, you'd be an ideal partner. But I can create that value myself without selling my hand."

Understanding dawned in Preston's eyes. If his interest was purely transactional, Evelyn remained unmoved. She wasn't some commodity to be traded for profit.

The silence stretched between them until Preston rubbed his temples, his voice dropping to an intimate murmur. "I've considered this poorly. My pursuit isn't about alliances."

He leaned forward slightly. "What if I told you my reasons were entirely selfish? That I've admired you for far longer than you realize?"

Evelyn's hands stilled over the teapot. A few drops spilled as her pulse jumped unexpectedly. The momentary warmth spreading through her chest startled her almost as much as his words.

She recovered quickly, her tone several degrees cooler. "Beyond business, we're practically strangers. So tell me, Mr. Sinclair, exactly how long is this 'far longer' you speak of?"
###Chapter 500 You're Not a Weed Here

Evelyn Sinclair didn't trust Preston Sinclair's smooth words.

She wasn't the type to be swayed by empty promises.

Preston met her gaze directly. "Less than a year," he admitted.

"But every day since I met you, I've been grateful to discover you're single. Evelyn, let's start fresh."

He took a deep breath before continuing. "My name is Preston Sinclair. I was widowed three years ago, and I have a son." His lips curved into a self-deprecating smile. "I know that doesn’t sound ideal, but I do have considerable wealth."

He shrugged lightly. "I don’t know the exact amount offhand, but if you’re curious, I can have someone calculate it—though it might take a while. I’ve lost track of some assets."

Then his expression turned serious, his warm gaze intense. "Oliver isn’t actually my biological son."

Evelyn stiffened.

"Due to certain family traditions and religious beliefs, I had to marry his mother so her family would allow the pregnancy."

The weight of his confession settled between them. Evelyn didn’t know how to respond. The vulnerability in his eyes left her speechless.

This was a secret few knew—yet he had just entrusted it to her.

Her heart ached for Oliver. The revelation left her emotions tangled.

Preston exhaled slowly. "I’m telling you this because it’s the most guarded part of my life. I don’t want you to feel burdened by it."

He hesitated. "I planned to tell Oliver when he was older."

Evelyn bit her lip. She had unintentionally brushed against his pain. "I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to pry."

The truth left her unsettled.

Preston had laid himself bare—but she wasn’t ready to reciprocate. She wasn’t prepared for a new relationship.

His smile softened. "I just wanted you to know me better. I don’t want you to think I’m only drawn to your beauty."

Evelyn relaxed slightly.

After a moment, she excused herself to the restroom.

Nearby, Tristan Whitmore and Gregory Thornton watched the couple intently. Their chemistry was undeniable, their striking looks making them seem like a perfect match.

Tristan checked his phone anxiously. Still no reply. He had messaged Nathan Blackwood earlier—but there was no response.

Was Nathan on his way to commit murder?

They couldn’t wait any longer.

Seizing the moment while Evelyn was gone, they approached Preston.

"Mr. Sinclair?"

Preston raised a brow, acknowledging the strangers.

Tristan forced a polite smile. "I’m Tristan Whitmore from Whitmore Holdings. This is Gregory Thornton of Thornton Enterprises."

Preston nodded.

Though Preston maintained a composed demeanor, Tristan couldn’t shake the resemblance to Nathan. The difference? Nathan’s intensity was unrestrained, while Preston’s was carefully veiled.

Tristan hesitated but pushed forward—for Nathan’s sake.

He casually took the seat beside Preston. "Was that Evelyn Sinclair sitting here earlier?"

Preston’s eyes darkened, but he nodded.

Tristan chuckled nervously. "Just making conversation."

Evelyn returned, her sharp gaze landing on them.

Tristan stood abruptly, his smile strained. "I was just greeting Mr. Sinclair."

Evelyn’s voice was icy. "If I end up in the tabloids, Tristan, you’ll be the headline."

His face paled.

She sat across from Preston, her tone cutting. "Did Nathan put you up to this?"

Tristan hesitated. "Of course n—"

The lie died on his lips.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Divorced? Strong-willed? Did you really think I wouldn’t find out?"

Tristan’s mind blanked. Did I say that out loud?

Gregory wisely stayed silent.

Evelyn smirked. "If you know so much about me, why stop at telling one person? Go straight to the press. Wouldn’t that be more effective?"

Tristan choked. "I wouldn’t dare!"

Gregory stayed quiet—he didn’t have blackmail material hanging over him like Tristan did.

Because if Evelyn ever released Tristan’s compromising photos?

He’d never show his face in public again.
