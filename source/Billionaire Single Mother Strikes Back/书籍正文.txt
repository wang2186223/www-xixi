###Chapter 1
The Ritz-Carlton

Isabella Montgomery moved heavily down the grand hallway, her swollen belly leading the way. Her eyes scanned the opulent ballroom, searching desperately for one face among the glittering crowd.

Today should have been her engagement celebration. The day she would promise forever to Alexander Whitmore. Yet the ceremony was minutes from starting, and her fiancé remained conspicuously absent.

A familiar feminine laugh echoed from the secluded staircase alcove. Isabella froze mid-step.

"Alexander, my love, are you certain about marrying that adopted girl? Especially when she's carrying another man's child?"

Isabella's blood ran cold. She knew that voice. Victoria Kensington—her beloved older sister.

Alexander's low chuckle followed. "Of course I know. I was in the hotel suite next door when it happened. If she ever discovered you arranged that entire assault, she'd never have signed over those fifteen percent shares."

Isabella's hand flew to her mouth. No. This couldn't be real.

Victoria's petulant whine carried clearly. "It's not fair! Why did Grandfather Theodore give her company shares? She's not even a real Montgomery!"

"Darling, don't fret," Alexander soothed. "The moment your mother switched you at birth, you became the true heiress. Isabella is common and plain. I'd never choose her over you. Once I control her shares, I'll discard her and give you the grand engagement you deserve."

The truth struck Isabella like a physical blow. The child she carried wasn't Alexander's. Her entire identity had been stolen. The sister she adored had orchestrated her ruin.

Memories flooded her—Victoria encouraging her to skip studies, to embrace frivolity. All while Isabella gifted her sister every opportunity Grandfather provided, including the coveted study abroad program.

Eighteen years of lies. Alexander had known everything. Participated in it.

A choked sob escaped her. Her stumbling retreat knocked over a crystal vase.

The shattering glass startled the embracing couple. They whirled toward the sound.

"Isabella!" Alexander's face contorted in annoyance. "What are you doing here?"

Victoria hastily adjusted her dress. "Sweetheart, this isn't what it looks like! We were just—"

"Spare me your lies!" Isabella spat. "You love my shares! My inheritance! Not me!" She turned toward the grand staircase. "I'll tell everyone the truth! Let all of Westchester know what vipers you are!"

Alexander grabbed her wrist painfully. "Don't you dare cause a scene! Remember your condition! Without your shares, you're nothing! No one wants a pregnant teenager!"

He was right. She was only eighteen. Her university dreams died the night Victoria destroyed her. This engagement became her only option. Now even that was a grotesque lie.

"I'd rather die alone than spend another moment with you!" She wrenched free and fled toward the ballroom.

Panic flashed across Victoria's face. If Isabella reached the guests below, everything would unravel.

"Isabella, wait!" Victoria lunged, pretending to grasp her sister's arm. Instead, she shoved hard.

Isabella cried out as she tumbled down the marble stairs. Her body slammed against the balustrade. Warm blood instantly soaked her white gown.

"Alexander! What have I done?" Victoria whimpered, though her eyes remained dry. "I only meant to stop her!"

"Quiet! She brought this on herself!" Alexander descended with brutal efficiency. He glared at Isabella's crumpled form. Then he kicked her swollen abdomen. Once. Twice. Three times.

Agony ripped through her. This was the boy she'd grown up with. The man who'd sworn to protect her. How could he be so monstrous?

Crimson pooled around her, staining the pristine marble.

Darkness swallowed her screams.
###Chapter 2

Five years had passed.

The gates of the Montgomery family estate swung open.

A sleek black motorcycle roared into the compound.

It executed a perfect 360-degree drift before halting at the entrance.

The machine was a masterpiece of engineering, finished in matte black.

A cloud of dust settled around it.

An elegant leg extended from the bike.

A woman dismounted smoothly.

She removed her helmet.

Long dark hair cascaded down her shoulders, lifted by the breeze.

Isabella Montgomery’s gaze fixed on the words “Montgomery Manor.”

A faint, cold smile touched her crimson lips.

She was back.

After five endless years.

The last time she stood here, her world had collapsed.

Brutal kicks to her stomach.

A life lost before it began.

Public humiliation, branded an adulteress.

Framed by Alexander and Victoria.

Her dignity shredded.

Her inheritance stolen.

Banished to Africa with nothing.

Forced to survive on scraps.

Five years of agony.

Five years of survival.

Now, she would reclaim what was hers.

Every last bit.

She took a step forward.

Then another.

Her boots clicked against the pavement.

Inside the garden, a lavish party was in full swing.

Waiters glided through the crowd with trays of expensive canapés and champagne.

It was Theodore Montgomery’s 70th birthday.

The elite of Westchester had gathered to celebrate.

A crowd surrounded the old man, offering gifts and flattery.

“Father, I brought your favorite tea. A century-old Pu-erh. Worth half a million.”

“Grandfather, this painting is by Qi Baishi. ‘High In The Sky.’ Nearly fifty million. May you live as long as the heavens.”

A soft, melodic voice cut through the noise.

“Grandfather, I had this jade Buddha specially carved for you. It’s worth five hundred million. I hope it brings you peace.”

All eyes turned to Victoria Kensington.

She looked radiant, delicate features glowing.

Four assistants followed her, carrying a board draped in red silk.

On it sat an exquisitely carved jade Buddha.

Sunlight glinted off its surface, revealing deep, forest-green hues.

The stone seemed to pulse with ancient energy.

The crowd gasped.

“My God! What kind of jade is that? The color is incredible!”

“That’s not jade. It’s the Czech No.1 Black Green Meteorite! Valued at five billion!”

“The one and only in the world?”

“Yes! It’s harder than diamond. A type of iron meteorite. Indestructible.”

“Unbelievable! Victoria actually bought it and had it carved!”

“She must have spent her entire savings!”

Admiration filled the air.

Victoria basked in the praise inwardly.

Outwardly, she remained humble.

She bowed her head slightly. “Please, it’s nothing. I just wanted to make Grandfather happy. My savings were well spent.”

Theodore beamed. “I love it! Absolutely magnificent!”

Suddenly, a voice rang out. “Who is that? She looks familiar!”

The crowd fell silent.

All heads turned toward the entrance.

Isabella walked down the red carpet.

She wore a black leather jacket and fitted pants.

Her hair flowed behind her like a dark river.

She moved with calm authority.

An aura of quiet power surrounded her.

Victoria’s smile vanished.

Isabella?

She was supposed to be in Africa.

Burnt. Broken. Ugly.

How was she so beautiful?

Eleanor Kensington stepped forward, face tight with anger. “What are you wearing? This is a formal event! Go to the backyard! You’re embarrassing us!”

Victoria forced a sweet tone. “Mother, perhaps Isabella came to celebrate Grandfather’s birthday. Let her stay.”

All eyes judged Isabella.

“Empty-handed? Some celebration.”

“A ward of the family. Probably here to beg for money.”

“Theodore saved fifteen percent of shares for her, and she brings nothing?”

Sophia Kensington sneered and shoved Isabella. “Get lost, orphan! You can’t even afford to look at this meteorite. Five billion! You’ve never seen that much money in your life!”

Isabella didn’t flinch.

A cool smile played on her lips. “Who said I came empty-handed?”

She clapped her hands sharply.

Four assistants approached, carrying another board draped in red silk.

They unveiled an identical jade Buddha statue.

Exactly the same as Victoria’s.

A perfect duplicate.

Silence descended.

Then chaos erupted.
###Chapter 3

Gasps echoed through the crowd.

“I thought there was only one Czech No.1?”

“How did Isabella gift the same thing? How can there be two?”

Victoria was the first to recover. A mocking laugh escaped her lips. “Hah! It’s obvious. She was too proud to show up empty-handed and bought a counterfeit. She never expected I’d gift the real thing. Now her pathetic lie is exposed! How hilarious!”

“Isabella, have you no shame? If you’re that broke, just stay home. Why embarrass yourself with a fake? I must have been out of my mind all those years ago, taking pity on you,” Eleanor Kensington scowled.

Eleanor had despised Isabella from the beginning. She never knew the woman she scorned was her actual daughter. The beloved Victoria was the adopted child, a carefully orchestrated plan by Victoria’s biological mother, Evangeline Kensington.

Before Isabella could respond, Victoria stepped forward. “Isabella, how could you?” she chided, playing the concerned sister perfectly. “Don’t you know gemstones carry energy? Fake ones can harm the body. How could you do this to Grandpa? Apologize now. I’m sure he and everyone will forgive you.”

“Apologize? You’re the one who should be apologizing!” Isabella shot back. “The Czech No.1 black-green meteorite was discovered in southern Czech. Experts confirm its Mohs hardness reaches 11. It can crush diamonds. Items made from it are impervious to knives or hammers.”

Confident, she continued, “Want to know which is real? Let me show you!” Without waiting, Isabella grabbed a hammer and smashed it down on Victoria’s Buddha statue.

Crash!

The moment the hammer connected, the supposed ‘Czech No.1’ shattered into countless pieces on the grass. Immediately, Isabella turned to her own statue and swung again.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Each strike was heavier than the last. Her statue remained completely intact, its color only deepening to a darker, more profound hue.

The crowd stared, utterly stunned. This was unbelievable!

“What?! How is this possible? Does that mean Victoria’s gift was a fake all along?”

“Those shards are clearly high-grade synthetic glass! We were almost fooled!”

“Exactly. How could a supermodel like Victoria earn five billion in five years? It makes sense now. She’s a fraud!”

The atmosphere shifted instantly. The previous admiration for Victoria’s generosity twisted into sharp condemnation.

“If you knew fake stones harm the body, how could you give one to Grandpa?” Isabella’s voice was laced with scorn, a permanent frown etched on her face.

“I didn’t know… I swear I didn’t!” Victoria shook her head frantically. She turned to Senior Montgomery, her words tumbling out. “Grandpa, I traveled to Czech specifically for this…!”

Theodore Montgomery wanted to believe his granddaughter. But the evidence before his eyes was undeniable. He simply waved a dismissive hand. “Enough. I understand. You were likely deceived abroad.” His tone was final. “Step aside. Someone clear this rubbish away.”

Staff immediately moved forward to sweep up the glittering fragments. Victoria’s face paled as she watched the shattered glass being removed. That ‘rubbish’ wasn’t just her five billion dollars… it was her reputation, her dignity, being carted away.

Humiliation burned hotter than ever before. How did Isabella get that kind of money? Victoria couldn’t earn five billion in five years as a supermodel. How did Isabella manage it in Africa? Impossible! Where did her money really come from?

Theodore paid the drama no mind. His focus was solely on the young woman before him. Five years ago, sending Isabella away was a painful necessity for her recovery. His longing for his true granddaughter never faded. Seeing her return, so composed and strong, he rose from his seat and approached her.

Standing before her, he took Isabella’s hands in his, his touch fond. “My dear child,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “You’ve suffered these past five years. From this day forward, your status as my granddaughter is absolute. No one will ever send you away from me again.” He squeezed her hands gently. “Grandpa will transfer the promised fifteen percent share to you, as was always intended.”

Chaos erupted anew.

Senior Montgomery’s favor was unmistakable. He was giving her a fifteen percent stake in the family empire! The adopted daughter, vanished for five years, was suddenly receiving the greatest blessing imaginable. She was beautiful, seemingly generous. Her future blazed brilliantly.

Guests swarmed Isabella, offering congratulations and lavish praise. Victoria stood alone, a dim star in a suddenly bright sky. She was utterly discarded, just like the broken glass. No one glanced her way.

Finally, someone did notice her. Their only comment was a sharp, “Tsk. What a disgraceful fraud.” As they walked away, Victoria’s hands clenched into tight fists. How did Isabella steal her spotlight so effortlessly? No. This was deliberate. Isabella had returned for revenge for what happened five years ago. Victoria wouldn’t allow it. Malice darkened her eyes as she pulled out her phone.

[I want her eliminated.]

High in the mansion’s attic, a tall, powerfully built man stood watching, one hand in his pocket. He exuded an aura of undeniable class and authority. He had witnessed the entire scene unfold in the garden below, his gaze intensely fixed on Isabella. She was extraordinary.

His phone rang, snapping him from his thoughts. He answered immediately. “Did you find any leads on the girl from five years ago?”

“Sorry, Boss. I hit a dead end. Her identity is a complete blank. But we have a bigger problem. Christopher is missing!”

“What?!” The man turned sharply and strode from the room without a backward glance.
###Chapter 4

The last of the guests departed.

Only the Montgomery family remained in the gardens.

Theodore Montgomery, weary from the day's festivities, retired to his chambers.

The moment he was gone, Eleanor Kensington's venomous gaze locked onto Isabella.

"You vile, ungrateful wretch," she seethed. "Victoria protected you, loved you like a real sister. How could you betray her like this?"

Isabella remained unflinching. "I did nothing. Did I force her to purchase a counterfeit gem?"

Her calm defiance enraged Eleanor further. "She was deceived! You could have warned her! Instead, you humiliated her publicly! Is this how you repay familial kindness?"

"Remove her from the premises," Richard Montgomery commanded his security team. "The Montgomery name tolerates no such disgrace."

Guards moved to seize her.

Isabella brushed them off with a cold glare, straightening her jacket. "Don't bother. I'll see myself out."

Staying here held no appeal for her anyway.

"Isabella, where will you go?" Victoria feigned concern, a perfect mask of sisterly worry plastered on her face. "Mother and Father's anger will pass. Just apologize. The thought of you on the streets breaks my heart..."

Her performance was flawless, but Isabella saw the triumph hidden beneath.

"Unnecessary," Isabella stated flatly. "I recently acquired a portfolio of properties. Twenty villa blocks, to be precise. Collecting rent keeps me rather occupied."

A faint, mocking smile touched her lips. She produced a heavy ring laden with hundreds of keys. They jangled loudly with every step as she turned to leave.

The family stared, utterly dumbfounded. Such wealth? Where did a mere adopted daughter get that kind of money?

Isabella paused beside Victoria, their shoulders almost touching. She lowered her voice to a deadly whisper.

"Hello, fraud. Get ready."

Her tone was ice. "I'm back now. Everything you stole from me? I'm taking it all back. And everyone who wronged me? They should start praying to whatever god they believe in."

Her smile was serene, but her eyes held the promise of a predator lurking in the shadows. Lethal.

Victoria paled, her legs trembling. This wasn't the timid, shy girl she used to torment. This woman radiated terrifying power.

Isabella walked away, head held high.

[She's finally gone!]

Outside, Isabella secured her helmet and mounted her motorcycle. Her grand return wasn't meant for tonight. Staying would only invite more abuse for being 'the adopted one.' Only Grandpa Theodore ever showed her genuine kindness.

She returned for vengeance, not their scorn. Her official homecoming would be a spectacle. A celebration where they'd have no choice but to welcome her.

The powerful bike roared to life, carrying her from Westchester's heart toward the secluded villa district. The road grew quieter.

Her phone buzzed. Pulling over, she answered.

Heavy breathing came first. "Miss Montgomery! You've returned! Why didn't you inform us? We could have arranged proper transport. The boss has prepared a five-star suite—"

"Unnecessary," Isabella cut him off. "This is a private matter. I won't be staying long."

"But—"

"Contact you when it's settled. If you're idle, assist me with a task. Investigate every guest at The Ritz-Carlton on Valentine's Day, five years ago. Focus on all men present on the top floor that night."

That hotel. That night in 2015. It ruined her. She lost everything. She would find the man responsible. And make him pay.

"Understood, Miss Montgomery. I'll begin immediately," Maxwell Carter replied.

Call ended, Isabella revved the engine and sped off. Her mind was consumed with strategy, completely unaware of the dark van tailing her from a distance.

The villa sat just 800 meters outside Westchester's boundary, isolated and private. Usually, no outsiders came here.

It happened in a flash.

A deafening engine roar erupted behind her.

BAM!

The van slammed violently into her bike.

The impact launched her into the air. She crashed hard near the edge of a steep, treacherous slope.

Dazed and wounded, Isabella squeezed her eyes shut, scrambling for purchase on the loose gravel. It was useless. She tumbled down the sharp incline, rocks tearing at her clothes and skin. No trees broke her fall.

Below, her motorcycle lay shattered and smoking.

The van's driver jumped out, peering down the dangerous drop. His phone was already at his ear as he scanned the area where she vanished.

"Miss Kensington. Isabella went over the cliff. She fell."

"Find her! Now! I want her body! Dead or alive!"

Pain radiated from every part of Isabella's body at the bottom of the ravine. She needed a moment. Just a moment to breathe.

But noise from above shattered that hope. They were coming for her.

Anger flared, hot and sharp, cutting through the agony. She forced her mind to focus, scanning her surroundings with desperate urgency.

There. A cave, almost completely hidden by thick brush.

She dragged herself toward it, every movement pure torture. Inside the cool, dark silence, she collapsed against the rough wall, exhaling shakily.

The quiet was suddenly broken.

A soft, boyish voice called out, "Mommy? Mommy!"

Before Isabella could process it, a small, warm, mud-caked body crashed into her arms.

She looked down.

A small, round face stared up at her. Wide, watery doe eyes blinked.

###Chapter 5

Their gazes locked.

A strange warmth flooded Isabella's veins.

It felt like reuniting with someone precious after lifetimes apart.

Oliver clung to her desperately. His small hands gripped her shirt.

"I was chasing a kitten," he mumbled into her shoulder. "Then I found you, Mommy. The kitten ran away, but I found you instead!"

Isabella stiffened. Gently, she pried his fingers loose.

"I'm not your mother," she said softly. "Where are your parents? Let me take you to them."

His cheerful expression shattered. Pain twisted his features.

A heart-wrenching sob escaped him.

"Waa... My chest hurts..."

Guilt stabbed her. She released his collar instantly.

Before she could speak, he launched himself back into her arms.

"Hurts... Need hug... Mommy, hug me..." He burrowed deeper into her embrace.

Isabella froze. What kind of parents abandon such a vulnerable child?

A sinister rustle cut through her thoughts.

A snake, thick as her wrist, slithered from the shadows. Its target was Oliver's ankle.

Jet-black scales. Gleaming, venomous fangs.

A king cobra. One bite meant certain death.

"Look out!"

She snatched Oliver with one hand. Her other shot out, seizing the reptile mid-strike.

The sudden movement provoked it. The cobra twisted, sinking its fangs deep into her forearm.

White-hot pain lanced up her arm. She gritted her teeth against it.

Covering Oliver's eyes, she swung the snake violently. She smashed it against the cave wall.

Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!

The sound echoed harshly. The snake went limp, lifeless.

She hurled the carcass into the darkness.

The toxin worked fast. Her limbs grew heavy. Her vision blurred.

She slumped against the cold cave wall, strength draining away.

Her hand fell from Oliver's eyes.

"Mommy! Mommy! Don't scare Ollie!" His tiny voice was frantic with terror. "Please! Stay here! Ollie will get Daddy!"

He scrambled to his feet and bolted from the cave.

Outside, he fumbled with a phone. Tiny fingers tapped a chatroom. He sent his location.

He hit record. A desperate whimper filled the air.

"Daddy! I'm here! Found Mommy! A bad snake bit her! She needs help! Now!"

Nathaniel Blackwood was tearing through the Montgomery manor with a hundred bodyguards.

His phone screen lit up. He read the message. A deep frown etched his face.

Ten miles away? The boy will be disciplined for this. And who is this 'Mommy'?

He slid into a luxury car. Tires screeched. He dialed a number.

"Sebastian. Cobra antivenin. My location. Now."

Nathaniel reached the cave entrance. The scene inside made his blood run cold.

Oliver wept uncontrollably next to an unconscious woman.

"Mommy... Wake up! Don't leave Ollie...!" Tears streamed down his cheeks.

Nathaniel's gaze fell on the woman. Pale. Unconscious. Stunningly beautiful, even in distress.

Isabella Montgomery. The adopted heiress.

Oliver spotted him. He sprinted over, clutching his father's leg.

"Daddy, save Mommy! She's dying! I don't want her to die!" he wailed.

"Calm down. Uncle Sebastian is bringing the serum," Nathaniel said, his voice tight.

"Too late! It's been too long!" Oliver shook his head violently. "The poison... her blood... it needs to come out now!"

Nathaniel's eyes scanned her body. The bite was on her thigh. To extract the venom... her pants would have to come off.

"Ollie. Listen. Men and women are different. Uncle Sebastian is almost here."

Oliver wasn't listening. Pure, unadulterated fear consumed him.

"Help her! Daddy, please! I just found her! I don't want to be mommy-less again! The other kids laugh! Please!"

He tugged Nathaniel toward Isabella, his words a desperate torrent.

"Oliver. Enough," Nathaniel warned, his tone turning stern.

A sudden, sharp gasp.

Oliver's eyes rolled back into his head. His small body convulsed. White foam bubbled from his lips.

He collapsed.

Nathaniel's composure shattered. Oliver's fragile health was a constant threat. Severe stress triggered these violent seizures.

Sebastian's warning echoed in his mind: Each episode risks permanent brain damage. His development is at stake.

It had been over a year since the last one...

A heavy silence fell.

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. He looked from his seizing son to the dying woman.

Defeat washed over him.

"Alright," he breathed, the word tasting like ash. "I'll help her."

He knelt at Isabella's feet. His hands reached for the waistband of her pants.
###Chapter 6

Nathaniel hadn't planned this course of action.

Yet this woman had undeniably captured his attention.

His family had spent years pushing him toward marriage.

But now...

"Daddy...Daddy..."

Oliver's cheerful voice snapped him back to reality.

Nathaniel noticed the darkening venom spreading rapidly.

It looked terrible.

Waiting for the antivenom would be too late.

He pushed all hesitation aside.

Bending down, he began sucking the poison from her wound.

Oliver watched from the ground, his eyes lighting up.

"Daddy touched Mommy! Daddy kissed Mommy! Now Daddy has to take care of Mommy forever!"

The boy's words never failed to astonish him.

...

Isabella's consciousness returned slowly.

She found herself in a monochrome room.

Elegantly furnished.

Expensive.

Where was she?

The cobra attack flashed through her mind.

She needed to treat the wound immediately!

Looking down, she realized her clothes had been changed.

She now wore an oversized white shirt that reached her knees.

Her wounds were cleaned and bandaged.

Who did this?

"You're awake?" A deep, velvety voice came from the doorway.

Isabella looked up.

A tall, muscular figure entered the room.

He wore a perfectly tailored suit.

His features looked like they were carved by a master sculptor.

He exuded an aura of power and refinement.

It was Nathaniel Blackwood.

The man stood at the pinnacle of society.

The Blackwood family's thirteenth heir.

A dynasty of immense wealth spanning five centuries.

This was Nathaniel Blackwood.

"Did you save me? Did you change my clothes?"

"Mhm." His response was soft yet firm.

He approached her and knelt beside the bed.

"Don't worry. I'll take full responsibility for you."

He produced a small velvet box.

It opened automatically.

Inside sat a heart-shaped diamond ring, glittering under the lights.

"What are you doing?" Isabella frowned.

"Proposing to you," Nathaniel stated calmly.

Rumors claimed Nathaniel had no interest in women.

Even his son came from a surrogate.

Why propose to her?

The son!

The boy's features resembled Nathaniel's.

The child she saved was this wealthy man's son?

Why let his son wander somewhere so dangerous?

And now this sudden proposal?

What an irresponsible man!

"Are you insane? You changed my clothes and now want to marry me?" She scoffed.

"I'm a man of principles," he deadpanned.

"By your principles, men who go to beaches would bring home thousands of wives. Thousands saw me at the beach once. Should I marry them all?"

Thousands of men? Nathaniel didn't like that.

Isabella slid off the bed.

She patted his shoulder gently.

"Mr. Blackwood, we're adults. I don't need your care. Focus on your son. Don't just make money. He has no mother. Neglect could damage his development."

She walked out wearing the oversized shirt.

It showcased her long, slim legs.

She blended masculinity with elegant femininity perfectly.

Nathaniel stiffened in awe.

Did she just reject his proposal?

Any woman would kill to marry him.

Yet she dismissed him without a second thought?

He turned suddenly, his tone slightly raised.

"Is there someone else?"

"Ah?" Isabella looked confused.

Nathaniel locked eyes with her.

He pronounced each syllable carefully.

"I sucked the toxin out myself."

Wait.

Wasn't the snakebite on her thigh?
###Chapter 7

Nathaniel moved swiftly, positioning himself directly in Isabella’s path.

He blocked her exit completely.

Once again, he produced the small velvet box.

“Miss Montgomery,” he stated, his tone deceptively lazy yet layered with unmistakable resolve. “Please reconsider.”

Isabella felt a surge of pure frustration. Was this man serious? Who actually imposed such an absurd condition?

She reached out and plucked the ring from its cushioned nest.

It was, without question, a masterpiece. A flawless heart-shaped diamond, its cut perfection itself, each facet catching the light with brilliant fire. The craftsmanship was exquisite, undeniable. It was a ring of rare, world-class quality.

And yet…

A cool, dismissive smile touched her lips. With a casual flick of her wrist, she tossed the ring. It sailed through the air, a sparkling arc of immense value, before landing with a faint, insignificant clatter against the far wall. Discarded. Worthless.

Nathaniel froze. So did Dominic, his assistant.

Dominic’s mind reeled. She had just refused his boss. She had literally thrown a priceless diamond ring away like common trash.

Isabella remained utterly unbothered. “I am grateful you saved me, Mr. Blackwood. That you ensured my recovery.” Her voice was flat, devoid of emotion. “But I will not marry you. Marriage is not a transaction. A victim is not obligated to wed her assailant. Your logic is profoundly naive.”

She walked around him without another glance.

A muscle twitched in Nathaniel’s jaw. Did she just compare him to a… rapist? The audacity. The sheer, deplorable insolence. This woman was infuriating. And fascinating.

A dark, speculative thought crossed his mind. Would she still be so dismissive if he had his way with her? The urge to find out was unexpectedly strong.

But the primary objective remained. She had survived. She was alive.

“Dominic,” he commanded, his voice sharp. “Send her the evidence we compiled.”

“Sir?” Dominic was utterly bewildered. She had been monumentally rude. Yet his boss wasn’t ordering her ruin? He was helping her? The ruthless, calculating man Dominic knew seemed to have vanished.

“Forget it.” Nathaniel strode toward his office, impatience evident in his every step. “I’ll handle it myself.”

He powered up his laptop, his focus absolute.

…

Isabella arrived at her penthouse. She changed into soft, comfortable clothes, tossing the borrowed white shirt into the wastebin without a second thought.

The sharp ring of her private phone sliced through the silence.

She answered. Harrison Winslow’s voice, usually so composed, was ragged with panic. “My lady! Are you unharmed? Why did you return there? It was secure here! And why dismiss Maxwell and his team? My heart stopped when I received the report of the… incident! That vile woman paid those men… I will make her suffer for this immediately!”

Few knew the truth. The past five years had forged Isabella into a force. Her accomplishments were her own, earning her a formidable reputation and powerful, loyal allies across the globe. She never asked for aid, yet it was perpetually offered.

She held the phone with her shoulder. “Stand down, Harrison. Relay this message: I am handling a personal matter. I am not to be disturbed.”

“But… are you certain?” His worry was palpable.

A cold, confident laugh escaped her. “If I doubted my ability to settle this, I would never have come back.”

She ended the call.

Harrison could only sigh in resignation and do as he was told.

Isabella opened her secure laptop, accessing a private server. A new, unread email flagged her attention. She clicked it.

The contents made her breath catch. Screenshots. Detailed conversations between Victoria and the driver. The entire murder plot, laid bare in text. Financial records showing a transfer from a discreet offshore account directly to the driver. And finally, a video file—clear footage of the orchestrated “accident.” It was a prosecutor’s dream. Enough to bury Victoria forever.

Who? Who could have assembled this damning dossier so quickly? And sent it to her, anonymously?

Her first assumption was an ally, a powerful contact seeking to curry favor. She checked the sender’s information.

Nathaniel Blackwood.

Her brow furrowed. Why? After her blatant, humiliating rejection, why would he provide this? The man’s resources were staggering. His motives, utterly perplexing.

But she was no fool. A gift horse required no dental exam. She saved every file, a dangerous, calculating glint igniting in her dark eyes. The game had just changed.

…

Meanwhile, in a lavishly over-decorated bedroom within the Montgomery manor…

Victoria Kensington sat at her vanity, idly brushing the hair of an expensive porcelain doll. A smug, victorious smile played on her lips. There was no way Isabella survived that cliff unscathed. At best, she was permanently maimed. Once she was vulnerable in a hospital bed, finishing the job and claiming her 15% stake would be simple.

With a sudden, vicious motion, Victoria ripped the doll’s head clean off.

Ding.

A notification chimed on her encrypted phone.

Annoyed, she picked it up. An anonymous email. She opened it.

All color drained from her face. Her features contorted into a mask of pure, unadulterated terror.

The email contained her entire conversation with the driver.

How? How was this possible? She’d used a burner phone! The payment was routed through an untraceable shell account! It was a perfect, foolproof plan!

Trembling uncontrollably, she forced her fingers to type a reply, trying to project a facade of calm.

[Who is this? State your price. Name any amount.]

[I have no interest in your money. You have two choices. One: Hold a press conference. Apologize to your sister publicly. Two: Send me a nude photograph. You have ten minutes to decide. If you fail to comply, these files are released to every major media outlet.]

A nude? This person was insane! A deranged lunatic!

Rage and fear twisted Victoria’s beautiful features into something ugly.

Who could it be?

She typed furiously. [Impossible. I will pay you whatever you want. Remember, I am the Montgomery heiress. You do not want me as an enemy. Cooperate, and your reward will be substantial.]

The reply was instant and merciless. [Nine minutes.]

Victoria’s blood ran cold. She was trapped.
###Chapter 8

Isabella’s knuckles turned white as she gripped her phone.

She immediately dialed her manager, Gabriella Martinez.

“Find out who sent that anonymous email,” she demanded. “I want their identity within five minutes.”

Isabella was certain she could pressure this person into backing down once she uncovered their details.

No one crossed her and got away with it.

But…

Five minutes later, Gabriella called back with disappointing news.

“I’m sorry, Isabella. I contacted the top hacker available and used every resource we have. We still couldn’t trace the sender’s IP address.”

“How is that possible?” Isabella’s voice rose sharply, fear taking over. “We have the best team money can buy! How can we fail to crack a simple anonymous IP?”

As the world’s top supermodel, she had access to elite resources and powerful connections. This shouldn’t be happening.

“The hacker is too skilled. Our team’s best couldn’t penetrate their defenses. Isabella, maybe we need another strategy to keep this quiet. If this gets out, your career is over,” Gabriella reasoned, sighing heavily.

Isabella collapsed onto her bed in shock. Gabriella was her most trusted manager and assistant. If even she couldn’t help, no one could.

What options did she have? Hold a press conference and confess? That would be just as damaging as the screenshots going public. Send nudes instead? Her reputation would still be ruined.

Another email arrived.

[Three minutes left.]

Attached was a screenshot of a drafted Weibo post.

[Supermodel Victoria Kensington paid to have her sister murdered!]

Isabella’s face went pale. Her hands trembled uncontrollably.

If this were exposed, it would make global headlines. She could end up in prison.

[Don’t post it. Wait. I’ll send the photos now.]

She had no choice. She rushed into her bathroom, even grabbing the cucumber she used for her eye mask.

As much as she hated this humiliating act, she saw no other way. The sender was probably some obsessed fan wanting to amuse himself with her photos.

Even if her nudes leaked, she could claim they were doctored. She might even gain more male fans. This outcome was far better than prison.

Biting her lip, Isabella took the photos.

…

At Rosewood Manor…

Isabella sat cross-legged before her computer, sipping wine.

“Three, two, one.”

Right on cue, a new email appeared.

Attached was a photo of Isabella in her bikini under the showerhead, completely drenched. She held a cucumber and gazed seductively into the camera.

Isabella smirked. The fish had taken the bait.

No one could blame Victoria for choosing this option, no matter how desperate.

Suddenly, a man in casual wear entered the study.

He stared coldly at Isabella. “You might have the funds, but remember why you’re really back.”

“I haven’t forgotten. Everything is going according to plan.” Isabella saved the photo while taking another sip.

The man glanced at her screen. “This alone won’t help you defeat Victoria Kensington. You need more fame to take everything from her. Attend the audition tomorrow.”

He tossed a file onto her desk and left.

Isabella picked it up. It was documents for the Chanel audition.

Chanel, an iconic luxury brand, was hosting its 10th Annual Jewelry Show at The Grand Mariner in Mount Claire. They were seeking a supermodel for the grand finale—a role that could make or break a model’s career.

Isabella scanned the list of candidates. Besides Victoria, the other 49 were world-famous supermodels—regulars at Milan Fashion Week and Victoria’s Secret shows.

Isabella was new to the industry, having just returned from abroad. Yet this man had secured her a spot in this elite audition.

He knew what he was doing.

Isabella organized the folder, her eyes returning to the photo on her screen. A sly smile spread across her face.

Tomorrow would be interesting.

Victoria’s reputation was on the line.

###Chapter 9

The next morning arrived with Gabriella Martinez pulling up to the Kensington estate.

Victoria Kensington stood ready in her finest gown, her face perfectly made up. Eleanor Kensington walked her to the door. "I'm so sorry, darling, but I can't accompany you to the audition today. Your father and I have an urgent project meeting. We're both rooting for you, though! Break a leg and secure that final appearance. Mommy knows you're the most talented one there!"

"Thank you, Mommy." They shared a brief, tight hug before Victoria slid into the waiting car.

The moment the door shut, Victoria's sweet, innocent smile vanished. A cold, calculating expression took its place.

Anxiety had been eating at her ever since Isabella Montgomery returned. Victoria knew the terrible truth: Her real birth mother was executed just three days after her delivery. Desperate for her child to have a better life, the woman had switched Victoria with Eleanor's actual daughter. Poor Isabella was left abandoned on the streets.

Would Eleanor still love her if she discovered the deception?

Seeing Victoria's troubled face, Gabriella assumed she was still upset about the previous night. "Don't let it get to you. It's just one photo," she said, trying to sound reassuring. "Even if it leaked, it wouldn't be the end of the world. Your focus should be on clinching that final appearance spot. Everyone who's anyone will be at the show tomorrow. Rumor has it a Blackwood might even attend. Landing this role would skyrocket your value. No one would even remember that birthday party incident."

"I'm aware." Victoria gave a curt nod.

The events of last night no longer troubled her. The hacker was probably just another obsessed pervert, like so many of her deranged fans. Since nothing was released immediately, it was unlikely to surface now. They probably just wanted the photos for their private collection.

"Oh, I almost forgot," Gabriella added. "When I checked the participant list this morning, I saw Isabella Montgomery's name. The girl just got back to the country and has zero modeling experience. It's honestly laughable that she even signed up!"

Instead of joining in the mockery, Victoria’s brow furrowed at the mention of Isabella. Right. She had threatened to take everything from Victoria. Of course she would show up here, trying to compete. But she was utterly out of her depth against a supermodel like Victoria.

A sneer of pure disdain twisted her lips. Today, she would dazzle the audience. She would make them adore her. She would show Isabella exactly how far out of her league she truly was.

Inside The Ritz-Carlton's Grand Ballroom, a long T-stage dominated the space. Luxurious chairs surrounded it, occupied by hosts, elite designers, and deep-pocketed sponsors.

Models walked the stage one after another. Each wore a simple gown with minimal makeup, their faces blank and devoid of emotion. Chanel was presenting a necklace called 'The Eternal Grove' for the final appearance. Crafted from platinum and shaped like a delicate leaf, it featured a hidden green fluorite stone nestled within. The piece, a blend of platinum, white gold, silver, and light green hues, radiated an aura of timeless elegance. The chosen model would need to embody that same eternal grace, or better yet, surpass it.

Sebastian Blackwood watched boredly from a concealed booth on the second floor.

"Bro, you promised the special lady would be here today. The audition's almost over. Where is she?"

"Exactly! Where's Mommy? These women are all so boring and plain. They think they're so chic. I'm getting sleepy..." Oliver mumbled, his eyelids heavy.

Nathaniel Blackwood ruffled the boy's hair. "She'll be here soon." His gaze remained fixed on the entrance.

"Uh... You saw her once and you're that sure?" Sebastian's tone dripped with disbelief and mockery.

"No one believes in love at first sight until that one person arrives and steals your heart completely," Nathaniel replied, an unconscious smirk touching his lips.

"Lord, save me from this cheesefest!" Sebastian howled, clutching his chest dramatically as if mortally wounded. "Bro, are we even related? I think I was a mistake. I shouldn't have been born. Then I wouldn't have a brother saying things like that to me! Your existence is pure torture for a single man like me!"

Oliver piped up, "Uncle Sebastian, you'll always have me! I'm almost old enough for school. Where's your kid, Uncle? Oh, right... you're not married. You don't even have a wife. How can you make a baby?" He chattered on without a filter. "It's so sad, Uncle. Even if you got married, you probably couldn't get a baby as cute as me." He looked at his uncle with genuine pity.

Sebastian felt the verbal slaps keep coming. What had he done to deserve this?

Suddenly, a wave of excited murmurs and appreciative noises rippled through the crowd below.

The three of them stopped their bickering instantly. Their attention snapped toward the stage.
###Chapter 10

Victoria Kensington emerged in a flowing white linen gown.

The dress was understated yet breathtakingly elegant.

She looked like she had stepped out of a classic literary masterpiece.

Her hair fell in soft waves over her shoulders.

A delicate floral crown rested upon her head.

Each movement made the gown sway gracefully.

Autumn leaves swirled around her feet as she walked.

It was a scene straight from a fairytale painting.

Her features were exquisitely refined.

She stood out among the other bland models.

Yet she maintained that otherworldly, fey-like grace.

She embodied celestial beauty.

She moved like a goddess brought to life.

The replica necklace gleamed against her slender neck.

Camille Laurent, the designer, gasped audibly.

“My God! It’s her! She’s perfect!” she exclaimed.

“This is exactly what I envisioned. She’s the one! We must sign her immediately!”

“How can someone be so ethereally pure? So dignified and untainted, like untouched snow.”

“Absolutely deserving of her global supermodel status. Her natural elegance is beyond compare.”

“Hmph.”

“So performative,” Oliver muttered.

Nathaniel nodded in agreement and handed him a chocolate bar.

Sebastian just stared at them, baffled.

Victoria seemed perfectly lovely. Why were they being so harsh? These two were impossible.

Meanwhile, Victoria basked in the audience's admiration.

A radiant smile spread across her face, warm as summer sunlight.

She felt certain in her heart now; she would be chosen for the final walk.

Just as predicted, the host and designers called her forward.

“The rest of the models may stand down. Victoria Kensington, you are our choice. You will be the necklace ambassador and headline tomorrow’s finale!”

“I concur! It must be Victoria. Her victory is undeniable!” Sophia Kensington declared happily.

The other competitors nodded in resigned acceptance. They were no match for Victoria Kensington, the world’s top supermodel.

Victoria bowed her head with feigned humility. “You are all too generous. I graciously accept this honor. I will not let you down.” Her voice was honey-sweet.

The producer confidently ascended the stage, contract in hand.

A genuine, triumphant smile finally touched Victoria’s lips. Once she secured this role, Isabella Montgomery could do nothing to stop her. How foolish of Isabella to even try competing. She should know her place.

As Victoria reached for the contract, a sharp electronic beep echoed through the hall.

The massive screen behind her flickered to life.

A photograph materialized on the display.

It was Victoria, posed under a shower spray.

Her body was scarcely concealed by a nearly transparent bikini, provocatively alluring.

Her expression was particularly captivating: lips parted, cheeks flushed, eyes heavy with seduction.

She was the picture of tantalizing desire.

Instantly, the room erupted into chaos.

“Good heavens… Is that really Victoria Kensington? She’s nothing like her pristine image!”

“She portrays such innocence. Who knew she could be so… brazen!”

Victoria stood frozen, completely blindsided.

She had imagined the photo leaking online last night, but she never dreamed it would happen here, today, at this moment.

Isadora Vasquez was the first to snap into action. “Turn it off! Somebody turn that off!” she shrieked.

But no one moved. The audience was either mesmerized, staring openly, or quickly snapping pictures for their own collections.

The judges’ panel exchanged uneasy, disapproving glances, reassessing their decision.

Amid the growing noise of ridicule and shock, Victoria finally jolted back to reality.

“Turn it off! Please! That’s… that’s not me!” she cried out.

If it wasn’t her, why was she panicking? The entertainment world had no real allies. No one rushed to her defense.

The damning image remained on the giant screen.

Finally, Victoria snapped.

She grabbed a nearby stool and hurled it with all her strength at the screen.

CRASH!

The screen shattered and went dark.

The photo was finally gone.

But…

The judgmental stares remained. Her carefully crafted image of purity was shattered. She was exposed.

“It’s a setup! I’ve been framed! Someone did this to me!” Victoria screamed, her face pale with terror.

The event manager stepped forward, his expression cold and final. “Miss Kensington, we deeply regret this incident. We suggest you withdraw and address this… situation.”

Just like that, her opportunity vanished.
###Chapter 11

Desperate to salvage her career, Victoria Kensington lunged forward and seized the manager's wrist. Her voice trembled with manufactured tears. "We had an agreement! That image was digitally altered—it's not even me! I would never engage in such behavior. How dare people accept it as truth without consulting me first?" She let perfect tears trace down her cheeks, a performance meant to evoke sympathy. Instead, her feigned innocence only sharpened the memory of what everyone had witnessed on screen.

"Deepest apologies, Miss Kensington. Perhaps we can revisit this another time." The manager extracted her hand from Victoria's grasp with visible distaste. "Security, please escort Miss Kensington out. And ensure she receives the invoice for the screen damages."

Several security guards advanced, their expressions a blend of mockery and contempt as they gestured toward the exit.

Victoria seethed internally. As the Kensington heiress, she was accustomed to reverence and deference. This public humiliation was unprecedented.

Though every fiber of her being resisted, she had no choice but to depart, shielding her face with her hands. The moment she cleared the ballroom doors, her pitiful mask dissolved into something venomous and deadly.

Who had done this? She would uncover the culprit and make them pay.

As her thoughts spiraled into dark calculations, a figure emerged from the shadows. Draped in an emerald gown that swayed with each step, the woman moved with lethal grace. Her crimson lips curved into a subtle smirk.

Isabella Montgomery.

Recognition ignited in Victoria's eyes. Of course. It all made sense now.

"You," Victoria hissed, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "You engineered this. You manipulated me into sending those photos, didn't you?"

"Is it significant if I did?" Isabella's laugh was low and unapologetic. She stood tall, hand resting on her hip, not even attempting denial.

Rage ignited within Victoria, burning through her composure. Isabella had orchestrated her downfall—hacked her privacy and orchestrated this very public ruin.

Forgetting her surroundings, Victoria snarled, "You're my sister! How could you be so vicious? I'll expose you. Everyone will know the monster you truly are!"

"By all means, proceed." Isabella scrolled through her phone, utterly unfazed. "You tried to kill me. I discovered it. You offered nudes instead of an apology. I have every media contact in the country—take your pick."

Victoria stood speechless, trembling with fury.

Isabella had unearthed her secrets and weaponized them. The truth would ruin her.

Noticing approaching footsteps, Victoria's expression instantly softened. Tears welled in her eyes anew. "I don't understand why you're saying these things... I've never harmed you! Why fabricate such lies?" Her voice broke as if wounded. "I know you've always envied me. You leaked that photo to steal my opportunity. Had you simply asked, I would have gladly stepped aside! Why destroy my reputation?"

Veronica—now Isadora Vasquez—appeared at Victoria's side. "Exactly. Victoria has a heart of gold. How dare you treat her this way?" She glared at Isabella. "The Montgomerys raised a viper!"

Isabella laughed softly. No wonder Victoria dominated the entertainment industry—she could spin falsehoods into convincing truths. Bored by the theatrics, she replied coolly, "You're absolutely right. I do want to ruin you. What will you do about it?"

She tossed her voluminous hair over her shoulder. "Must you always repeat yourself? How tedious." With that, Isabella turned, her emerald dress flowing behind her as she walked away.

Victoria trembled with volcanic rage. This was not the timid, fragile sister she had once controlled. Isabella had transformed into someone bold, untamed, and infuriatingly arrogant.

She would not accept this. "Watch your back, Isabella Montgomery. This isn't over."

Inside her limousine, Victoria turned to Isadora. "Use every Kensington resource. I want her destroyed."

...

Back in the ballroom, the audition resumed once order was restored.

The manager announced, "Our final contestant: Isabella Montgomery."

The heavy doors swung open. Every eye turned toward her—including three watching intently from the mezzanine. Isabella moved with effortless grace, her simple heels clicking against the marble floor. The emerald gown complemented her fierce beauty, her red lips a statement of intent. She was, in a word, mesmerizing.

A wave of unease swept through the models. "Who is she? I've never seen her before."

"Isn't she the adopted daughter? She has no modeling experience. What makes her think she belongs here?" Sophia Kensington sneered.

Others sighed in disdain.

"How embarrassing. Does she believe anyone can audition for Chanel?"

"The ambassador must embody grace and beauty. She's overdressed—probably mistook this for a Victoria's Secret casting."

"Can someone remove her? She's wasting everyone's time." Complaints rippled through the crowd.

The manager regarded Isabella with open contempt. "Why is there an extra name on the list? Security, escort her out."

"One minute is all I need," Isabella stated calmly, continuing her path toward the stage.

No one believed her. Security moved to block her advance.

"Leave! Don't waste our time. We have actual careers—unlike you."

###Chapter 12

Oliver Blackwood tugged at Nathaniel Blackwood’s sleeve. “Daddy, help Mommy! Someone is hurting her!” he cried.

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable. He picked up his phone, found a contact, and dialed. When the call connected, his voice was low and commanding. “Isabella Montgomery is under my protection.”

Downstairs, the event coordinator stared at his phone in disbelief before his eyes darted toward Isabella, who was being restrained by security. Panic seized him. Dear god… This woman belonged to Nathaniel Blackwood?

“Release her! Now! Don’t lay a hand on Miss Montgomery!” he shrieked, his voice trembling with raw fear.

The security guards froze in confusion. The crowd fell silent, stunned. Wasn’t she just some nobody? What changed?

The coordinator rushed to Isabella and bowed deeply. “Miss Montgomery, my sincerest apologies. You requested one minute? Please, take all the time you require.” His words spilled out in a nervous, respectful rush. “Chanel values fairness above all. We would be honored to have you participate.”

Isabella’s brow furrowed. His attitude shifted faster than a flipping page. Who was on that call?

A strange sensation prickled her skin—the feeling of being watched. She glanced upward, her eyes locking with a man observing her from behind a second-floor glass door.

Nathaniel Blackwood.

What was he doing here? A faint, unconscious smile touched Nathaniel’s lips when their eyes met. Beside him, Oliver waved at her excitedly.

Isabella’s heart skipped. Why would Nathaniel help her? The kid was odd enough, but his father was even more perplexing. She had rejected him plainly yesterday. Was he actually pursuing her?

Nathaniel’s slight smile faded into a frown. Women usually threw themselves at him. Why did Isabella seem so wary and resistant?

Noticing Nathaniel’s intense gaze, the coordinator trembled. “Miss Montgomery, shall we assist you with any preparations?”

“No. I’m ready.” She walked toward the stage, confidence radiating from her.

Isabella’s goal was clear: strip Victoria Kensington of every opportunity and shred of fame. The audience remained clueless, still mocking her choice of dress and her audacity to compete.

They saw her as a delusional upstart. Giving her a chance was charity. Who did she think she was?

Even the designer was appalled. How could the coordinator allow this? Letting this woman touch her creation was an insult. “Not just anyone can wear my designs. If this amateur remains, I will cease working with Chanel.”

Suddenly, all the lights in the ballroom cut to black.

After a moment of darkness, a soft green spotlight swept across the T-stage. A weathered wooden stump materialized in the center. Isabella perched on it, one hand supporting her chin, her features exquisitely highlighted.

She leaned back with effortless grace, as if resting on a lazy summer afternoon. Her dark green dress cascaded around her, evoking a timeless, vintage beauty.

Her crimson lips did not clash with her elegance. Instead, they enhanced it, giving her an ethereal, almost mystical aura—cold and flawless.

Fireflies began to glow in the darkness, drifting toward her. Some settled on her curled lashes; others landed gently in her palm. The scene was breathtaking, a living fantasy painting.

The replica necklace around her neck seemed to come alive against her skin, glowing with an otherworldly light.

The audience held its breath, utterly captivated. It became clear: true beauty didn’t require simplicity or false innocence. A real goddess could shine even with blood-red lips.

The silence was absolute. Everyone was mesmerized.

When her performance ended, the spell broke. Thunderous applause erupted.

“Magnificent!”

“That’s the true essence of ‘Glowing Forest’!”

The designer completely retracted her earlier words. “Who is she? I take it all back. Sign her immediately!” she exclaimed, beaming. “We must have her!”

Upstairs, Oliver jumped with joy. “Mommy is so beautiful! Daddy, hurry! You have to win her over before someone else does!”

“Patience yields better results than haste,” Nathaniel replied flatly, ruffling the boy’s hair.

“Hmph! You’re too slow! I’ll help you!” Oliver pushed away and bolted downstairs.

Nathaniel’s frown deepened. “Stop him!”

Sebastian Blackwood immediately gave chase.
###Chapter 13

The Chanel executive extended the contract toward Isabella.

Sophia Kensington stepped forward abruptly. "Mr. Chamberlain, are you certain about this? She has no professional runway experience whatsoever!"

"Absolutely. Her little firefly stunt was just a cheap parlor trick. Anyone could pull that off with enough preparation. It won't impress anyone at tomorrow's actual event."

The manager's expression turned icy. "If you're all such experts, perhaps you should demonstrate your superior skills? From what I observed, most of you move like mannequins with frozen expressions." He turned back to Isabella with a respectful smile. "Miss Montgomery, your signature right here will suffice. We trust your capabilities completely."

Isabella signed the document with a flourish.

She then faced Sophia with a challenging gaze. "You might want to step up your game tomorrow. It would be embarrassing for an established model like yourself to be outperformed by someone you consider inexperienced." A subtle smirk played on her lips as she turned to exit.

Sophia's cheeks flushed crimson with humiliation. Though not as renowned as Victoria, she commanded significant recognition as both model and actress. Her bold, unfiltered persona had earned her a dedicated following. Never had she been so openly mocked—especially not by an adopted daughter like Isabella! Losing this opportunity to her was absolutely intolerable.

...

Isabella emerged from the hotel into the cool evening air. The parking lot glittered with luxury vehicles, a stark contrast to her modest motorcycle parked discreetly in the corner.

As she reached for her helmet, a small figure darted toward her.

"Mommy! Mommy!" Oliver's sweet voice carried through the night as he wrapped himself around her leg, clinging like a determined koala.

Isabella instinctively moved to push him away, but his cherubic face and pleading eyes disarmed her. She sighed and ruffled his hair. "Sweetheart, where's your father? Did he leave you alone again?"

"I ran away. I missed you... Will you come home with me?" He buried his face deeper into her coat.

"Oliver, I'm not your mother. I have my own home to return to." Her voice softened despite her words.

"But you are! Daddy promised you'd be my mommy! He thinks about you all the time. He even sleeps with your photo!" The words tumbled out in an eager rush. "Today he canceled a billion-dollar meeting just to watch you. He wanted to protect you."

Isabella fell silent. Could this be true? Did Nathaniel actually keep her picture by his bedside?

She gently stroked his hair. "Sweet boy, you're too young to understand. Love isn't something that happens instantly. What people call love at first sight is usually just attraction. It's superficial. Like when a homeless person admires someone beautiful from afar. It's not real, and it's not right."

Nathaniel emerged from the shadows just in time to hear her last words. His handsome features darkened immediately, like storm clouds gathering before a tempest.

Homeless? She compared him to a homeless person?
###Chapter 14

Nathaniel hadn't anticipated Isabella would be so unresponsive. He'd thought mentioning his father would spark her interest.

He wanted to say more, but Isabella simply lifted him and set him aside. "Ollie, go back to your dad. I have important matters to handle," she stated firmly. "Go home, okay?"

"Mommy..." Oliver gazed up with pleading eyes, hoping to sway her with his pitiful expression.

Isabella couldn't deny it affected her, but she remembered her purpose for returning.

Refocusing, she swung her leg over the motorcycle seat.

Oliver pouted dramatically, his lips forming a perfect sulk. His plan had failed. He needed another strategy.

He swung his chubby arms casually as the engine roared to life.

Pop!

The rear tire deflated instantly, causing the bike to tilt dangerously.

"Mommy! Your tire!" Oliver shrieked with feigned terror. "Someone shot it with a dart!"

Isabella dismounted quickly. Sure enough, a silver dart protruded from the rubber.

Who used darts anymore? Especially as a weapon. It seemed bizarre.

Noticing her suspicion growing, Oliver quickly grabbed her hand. "Don't worry, Mommy! Daddy will take you home!" He yelled into his smartwatch, "Emergency protocol! Daddy, respond!"

Her suspicion intensified, but it didn't make sense. Oliver was only five. He couldn't have thrown that dart... probably. His convincingly terrified expression made him seem uninvolved.

A sleek black van pulled up abruptly. Sebastian rolled down the window. "Miss Montgomery! Oliver! Get in now!"

Oliver yanked the passenger door open and scrambled inside. "Mommy, come on! Just a ride, I promise!"

Isabella noted only Sebastian was visible. Her bike needed repairs anyway. Without overthinking, she slid into the back seat.

Instant regret flooded her. Nathaniel sat there too.

Can I still escape? she thought desperately.

Sebastian saw her hesitation in the rearview mirror. He hit the accelerator before she could react.

Too late now, she sighed internally, scooting as far from Nathaniel as possible.

Fortunately, Nathaniel was engrossed in his financial tablet. He radiated his usual aura of aristocratic coldness, detached and undisturbed by his surroundings.

Maybe she was overthinking things.

Suddenly, the van swerved violently. Caught off guard, Isabella tumbled into Nathaniel.

Riiip!

The tablet in his hands cracked under their combined weight.

Silence.

An awkward, heavy silence engulfed the vehicle.

Damn his perfect profile. Her heart hammered wildly against her ribs.

Thump. Thump. Thump.

This was wrong. Why was her heart racing? She gripped the front seat headrest, trying to right herself.

Just as she almost succeeded, the van swerved again.

Isabella fell back into Nathaniel.

This time, her face planted directly against his firm, clothed abdomen.
###Chapter 15

His distinct masculine scent invaded her senses immediately. Isabella’s heartbeat quickened. Anger and embarrassment warred inside her.

‘Sebastian did that on purpose!’ she fumed silently.

Just as she was about to snap, Oliver’s small voice piped up from the front. “Sorry, Mommy. Please don’t be mad. Uncle Sebastian loves drifting. He was a professional racer.”

“Sebastian. Control the vehicle. This is a public road,” Nathaniel’s deep voice cut through, low and commanding.

Isabella swallowed her protest. Nathaniel’s hands steadied her arms. His tone softened, laced with genuine concern. “Are you alright?”

His expression was so earnest she doubted her own suspicion. She pulled away, putting space between them. “I’m fine,” she stated firmly, gripping the overhead handle tightly.

She was secure. Or so she thought.

The van swerved violently again.

Screech!

Isabella held her ground this time. Nathaniel, however, stumbled forward. His hand grabbed her dress for balance.

Rip!

The fabric at her waist tore, exposing her skin.

“Nathaniel Blackwood!” she hissed, her patience snapping.

The van abruptly stopped.

“Miss Montgomery, we’ve arrived,” Sebastian announced, turning with a guilty look. “My deepest apologies. I get carried away behind the wheel.”

“Uncle Sebastian! I told you to stop doing that! You always make Daddy fly!” Oliver scolded, scrambling to the back. “Daddy, are you okay?”

“I’m fine.”

Nathaniel straightened his suit. His gaze returned to Isabella, filled with apparent sincerity. “Miss Montgomery, my apologies for the inconvenience. I will replace the dress. Please, use this for now.” He draped his spare white shirt over her shoulders. His voice was surprisingly gentle.

Isabella’s fist clenched, but she held back. Oliver looked innocent. Sebastian seemed remorseful. Nathaniel appeared completely serious. They all seemed oblivious.

A man like Nathaniel wouldn’t resort to such cheap tricks…

“It’s unnecessary. Thank you for the ride. Keep the shirt. Consider the dress payment for the trip.”

She exited the van swiftly.

“I don’t leave debts unsettled. Especially not with a woman,” his voice stopped her. “I prefer clarity. I will deliver a new dress to you personally.”

Isabella nearly stumbled. She wanted neither the dress nor to see him again. But refusing might imply she wanted him indebted. It was simpler to escape.

She hurried away without a backward glance.

Once she was gone, Nathaniel’s expression shifted. A knowing smile touched his lips as he looked at Sebastian and Oliver. “Alright. What do you want?”

Sebastian grinned. “Get me out of all the family blind dates for a year!”

Oliver clapped his hands joyfully. “I want you to marry Mommy and give me a baby sister!”

“Consider it done.”
###Chapter 16

Isabella stepped into Rosewood Manor, still wearing Nathaniel's shirt. The memory of their encounter replayed relentlessly in her mind. Her cheeks burned with a heat she couldn't suppress.

Nathaniel wasn't the man she had envisioned for herself. Yet she couldn't deny the raw magnetism of his powerful physique. Those defined abs, solid and sculpted...

Lost in her thoughts, she failed to notice the figure closing in on her.

Slap!

The blow came without warning. A stinging pain erupted across her cheek.

Hidden guards immediately tensed, ready to intervene. Their leader, Maxwell, halted them with a sharp gesture. "Stand down. Boss's orders. We observe only."

One guard bristled. "We're just going to let someone assault her? She's our leader! No one touches her without consequences. I'm stepping in."

"Hold your position," Maxwell commanded calmly. "Trust her. She'll handle this. Just watch."

Isabella slowly lifted her gaze. A teenage boy stood before her, his silver-dyed hair stark under the lights. He wore ripped jeans and an oversized shirt, projecting a deliberately rebellious image.

It was Benjamin Kensington. Her eighteen-year-old biological brother. Corrupted by Victoria's influence, he saw Isabella only as a scheming adopted daughter, a gold digger preying on the Montgomery family.

He glared at her with pure venom. "How dare you do that to Victoria? She wouldn't hurt a fly! Why would you fabricate such lies? She cried herself to sleep because of you! She's too kind to even let me confront you! You're a soulless monster! You'd be dead in the gutter if our family hadn't taken you in!"

Isabella wordlessly wiped a trace of blood from her lip. A dangerous glint flashed in her eyes.

Benjamin had been in countless fights. But he had never seen a look so terrifying.

His bravado returned quickly. "Don't you look at me like that! You're just an adopted nobody! The security cameras here are all disabled. I could kill you right now, and no one would ever find your body or even care that you're gone."

Isabella paused. "The cameras are broken?"

"Of course! Why do you think I chose here? Scared now? You should be! Return the final appearance and ambassador role to Victoria. Do it before you regret it."

A cold, cruel smile touched Isabella's lips. "No. But thank you for the information." In one fluid motion, she swung her leg up. Her high-heeled shoe connected hard with his chest.

Thump!

The impact sent him flying across the room. He crashed to the floor, writhing in agony. The crack of breaking ribs was audible.

The hidden guards stared in awe. Their boss was formidable. She had just launched a nearly six-foot-tall young man through the air with a single kick.

Her clothes swayed as she advanced toward him. She moved like a victorious warrior surveying a conquered battlefield.

Terrified, Benjamin tried to shield himself with his arms. "Wh-What are you doing?! Stay back!"

Her skill was terrifyingly precise. One kick had shattered his ribs. He was utterly outmatched.

She loomed over his cowering form. Her gaze was lethal. "You said the cameras are destroyed. How could I waste such a perfect opportunity?"

She raised her leg again. The sharp tip of her shoe pressed down onto his head. She began to apply pressure.
###Chapter 17

Splash!

Benjamin’s face was shoved into a basin of murky, soapy water.

Isabella pressed down harder with her boot. “Clean out those disgusting, delusional thoughts!” she mocked. “Ask yourself this—if Victoria truly cared about you, why did she never push you to be better? Why did she let everyone in this family look down on you?”

He thrashed, desperate for air, but her strength was absolute. Water flooded his nose and throat each time he gasped. Only when his struggles grew weak did she finally release him.

Yanking his head back by the hair, Isabella snarled, “Benjamin Kensington, stop being a fool. That’s my only advice. Cross me like this again, and blood won’t save you. Family or not.”

She released him and walked away.

He slumped against the cabinet, heaving and choking. Unbelievable. How did that timid, quiet adopted girl become this? Who breaks ribs with a single, careless kick?

‘She’s pure evil. Trying to turn me against Victoria after all the pain she’s caused. I will make her pay,’ he vowed silently.

Across the villa, Isabella entered her private bathroom. She was scrubbing off her makeup, rinsing the metallic taste from her mouth, when a man entered and handed her an ice pack. “A DNA test would settle this,” he stated flatly.

“Julian, do you think Victoria is acting blindly? She owns every hospital and clinic in Westchester. The results would be falsified before the sample even reached the lab.” She studied her swollen lip in the mirror. “And what if they learn the truth? They’d still choose her over me.”

Julian’s expression tightened.

“Though,” she added, a cold smile touching her lips as she pressed the ice to her mouth, “I do look forward to the day the truth shreds their perfect world apart.”

His frown deepened. He hadn’t expected to find someone whose bitterness rivaled, perhaps even surpassed, his own.

“There’s a more pressing issue.” He passed her a phone.

The screen displayed a Twitter feed exploding with headlines: [Who is Isabella Montgomery’s Sugar Daddy?], [Victoria Kensington: Deepfake Nudes Scandal], [Victoria Kensington’s Opportunities Stolen!].

The top trending topic: [Victoria Kensington’s Chanel audition was sabotaged by explicit deepfakes displayed on screen, costing her the role.]

The comments were a torrent of hate:

[What a scheming witch! Our Vicky is pure class! She’d never!]

[The timing is so obvious. Dirty tricks to steal the spotlight.]

[She’s pure evil.]

[Who is she sleeping with? A nobody doesn’t land a role like this.]

[Chanel should be ashamed. Boycott Chanel!]

[Boycott Chanel! Boycott Isabella Montgomery!]

[Isabella Montgomery, get out. You’re not wanted.]

The vitriol was endless.

Isabella just scoffed, rolling her eyes. “This is nothing.”

Nothing? The entire internet was calling for her head. Her calm was unnerving.

“This is your first public battle, Isabella,” Julian warned. “You need to win it.”

“Making headlines is a victory in itself, isn’t it?” She strolled to the wine cellar, pouring a generous glass of burgundy. She offered one to Julian, who declined.

His gaze darkened. The past five years had carved cynicism into her soul. “Take this seriously,” he insisted. “It’s not a game.”

At that moment, Chanel’s executives were in emergency session. The online fury made hiring Isabella impossible.

She simply reclined on the sofa, taking a slow sip. “Relax. Do you think I’d make a move without a backup plan?”

Her fingers began flying across her phone screen.
###Chapter 18

Her private Instagram account flooded with hateful comments.

[You’re pure evil! How could you do this to Victoria Kensington? Why not Photoshop your own pictures too?]

[What a disgusting witch. I hope you and your family rot in hell!]

[Who do you think you are, auditioning for Chanel? How many men did you sleep with to afford that? Watch out for STDs!]

Isabelle scrolled through the messages, a cold smirk forming on her lips as she typed:

[Sleep with men for money? Try sleeping on a bed of cash!]

She attached three photos: a towering stack of property deeds, a collection of luxury car keys, and a sweeping aerial view of Westchester’s Gold Avenue.

The images instantly went viral across the platform. Gold Avenue in Westchester was legendary—a two-kilometer stretch home to the world’s most exclusive luxury brands. The stack of deeds represented ownership of multiple properties on that very street. And the car keys? Each one belonged to a supercar worth millions.

[Holy crap, she’s a billionaire!]

[No way this is real. She’s just some adopted orphan—how could she afford all this?]

[I verified it. It’s legit. Isabella Montgomery owns a quarter of the properties on Gold Avenue. Even the powerful Blackwood family only owns half!]

[So maybe she’s sleeping with someone from the Blackwoods. But no way would a family like that take in an adopted girl. Who else is funding her?]

[Even if she’s loaded, she definitely paid for that finalist spot and the ambassador role. She’s buying her way to fame!]

[Exactly. She’s got nothing but cash.]

[She’s purchasing clout, and Chanel is playing along? Money really can buy anything, huh?]

The narrative swiftly twisted.

[Isabella Montgomery uses wealth to buy fame and bully Victoria Kensington!]

Isabella wasn’t surprised. She had anticipated this. She typed another reply:

[Whether I bought my fame or not, you’ll all find out tomorrow night!]

‘Find out tomorrow night’? How could a fraud be so confident?

…

At the Blackwood Estate…

Oliver Blackwood had been quietly browsing on his tablet when he suddenly shot up, bursting with excitement. “Mommy is so cool! I’ve never seen anyone this awesome! I’m totally her biggest fan!”

“You’re a boy,” Nathaniel stated flatly, moving Oliver aside as he opened his laptop.

Oliver pouted, confused. “Daddy, so many people are bullying your wife. How can you just sit there and work? You’re so cold!”

“Quiet. I’m handling Mommy’s situation,” Nathaniel murmured, his tone mysterious yet compelling.

Although Isabella had things under control, Victoria was cunning. She had twisted all the lies back onto Isabella. The forum discussions should have been about #Victoria-nude, but Victoria had flipped the script.

That could be fixed.

With a few deft keystrokes, the headline instantly changed to:

[Professor Zero Analyzes Victoria Kensington’s Nude Photo]

The video began with Professor Zero, a man in his mid-sixties with distinguished grey hair, addressing the camera.

“Greetings, everyone. I am Professor Zero, a National Photo Analyst. As many of you know, I work for the government, specializing in verifying the authenticity of various images and assisting departments in validating evidence from crime scenes.

“Recently, I came across a highly discussed topic and decided to use my resources to clarify the truth. Honestly, I’ve been a longtime admirer of Victoria Kensington. She embodies purity and diligence, and I’ve even encouraged my granddaughter to aspire to her accomplishments at such a young age!

“Therefore, when I saw that controversial photo of her, I was deeply troubled by the false accusations. I took some time to analyze this image to determine if it was altered with Photoshop or AI tools.”

Professor Zero turned the camera to his computer screen, launching a complex software program. As it loaded, he continued, “This is a advanced photo analysis tool, available only to certified professionals. It can detect any form of manipulation or artificial merging in photographs.

“Normally, this software is reserved for critical government projects. However, I obtained special permission to use it today to help everyone uncover the truth.”

He uploaded Victoria’s image into the program. A progress bar appeared:

[Processing: 9%]

Within seconds, lines of complex code filled the screen. The professor turned back to the camera, his expression earnest. “This is the program analyzing the photo’s data. It’s processing every detail.”

He scrolled through the data as he spoke. Suddenly, his aged hand stilled, trembling slightly.

[The image is 100% authentic]

The words were unmistakable.

Instantly, the comments beneath the video exploded.

[This can’t be right! Victoria would never take such a photo! Is this a mistake?]

[It has to be an error! Professor Zero is a respected expert; he wouldn’t fabricate this. Plus, only government officials have access to that software. The results are legitimate.]

[So Victoria actually took that photo? I can’t believe she’s that kind of person.]

[Well, if you think about it, no one is that pure and perfect. She’s been deceiving everyone all along.]

Negative comments flooded the forum. The topics that had been attacking Isabella now shifted to:

#Victoria-nude

#The-photo-is-real

#Professor-Zero

The photo had been verified by Professor Zero. There was nothing her fans could do to defend her.

Victoria’s reputation was permanently stained.
###Chapter 19

Inside the Montgomery Manor…

Victoria Kensington collapsed onto the sofa, trembling uncontrollably.

‘How did this happen? Everything was perfect… How did it all go so wrong? Why would Professor Zero destroy my reputation like this if he claimed to be my fan? And he published that clip!’ Her thoughts spiraled into chaos.

Just then, Alexander Whitmore entered the room, dressed in a flawlessly tailored suit. “Victoria, what’s this about the pho—”

“It’s all lies! Complete nonsense!” Victoria snapped, cutting him off mid-sentence.

Alexander froze. He had never seen Victoria in such a state before.

Realizing it was him, she quickly composed herself and rushed to his side, her voice trembling with feigned distress.

“Alexander, my love, I didn’t mean to shout. I’m just so hurt by Isabella.” She let bitterness seep into her tone. “I’ve always treated her well, except for that one incident five years ago. I never imagined she could be so vicious. Who knows what she’s been doing in Africa all this time? Making money, buying properties, even befriending Professor Zero. She probably paid him off to fabricate that analysis. We both know nothing about photo forensics. He could say anything and get away with it!”

She trembled as she cried, making it seem as though Isabella had committed an unspeakable betrayal. “Alexander, we’ve known each other since childhood. Do you really believe I’m capable of such things? Why would I ever sabotage my own reputation?” Her performance was so convincing it was almost flawless.

“Please, don’t cry. I trust you completely.” Alexander pulled her into an embrace, gently rubbing her back. “I can’t believe Isabella Montgomery has turned so malicious in just five years.”

Victoria pushed him away gently, feigning fear. “Yes, and she’ll come after us for revenge. After all, I did accidentally push her down the stairs, and you… you kicked her. With the power she has now, she’ll stop at nothing to destroy us.”

“Ha! She won’t stand a chance,” Alexander scoffed. “Don’t worry about this. She’s wronged you twice now. I won’t let it slide.” After settling her comfortably on the sofa, he picked up his phone and logged into his Twitter account, which boasted millions of followers.

Over the past five years, Alexander’s parents had retired and handed him the family business, making him the CEO of Whitmore Enterprises.

Originally ranked among the 'Top Ten Most Successful Companies' in the nation, Whitmore Enterprises owned shopping malls, theaters, hotels, travel agencies, and more. Under Alexander’s ruthless yet charismatic leadership, coupled with his savvy social media marketing, the company had climbed into the top five.

Even Theodore Montgomery admired his capabilities and approved of Alexander’s relationship with Victoria. However, they couldn’t officially get engaged until Isabella returned the engagement token, a fact that had fueled their resentment toward her over the years.

Alexander composed a tweet and tagged Isabella.

[Laughable. “Wait until tomorrow night”? Only a fraud like you would spout such nonsense! If you actually make it to the show tomorrow, I, Alexander Whitmore, will owe you 100 million! @IsabellaMontgomery]

As the youngest, wealthiest, and most handsome CEO, he was dubbed the 'National Husband' by his over 40 million followers. Within seconds, his post garnered over 200,000 replies.

[Ahhh! My husband finally tweeted! So commanding and fierce!]

[Even our National Husband can’t stand that witch Isabella Montgomery!]

[Rumor has it Alexander Whitmore is dating Victoria Kensington. Is he defending her?]

[That’s irrelevant! Didn’t Isabella tell us to wait until tomorrow night? If she’s so capable, why is she hiding?]

[Haha! Serves the bitch right for being called out by our national husband. She’s probably crying in a corner right now.]

Unbeknownst to them, Isabella had long logged off her account and was working out in her private gym at Rosewood Manor.

As her agent, Julian Hawthorne was tasked with monitoring the situation. After Professor Zero’s video went viral, he expected the hate toward Isabella to die down, but the attacks quickly resumed, especially with Alexander’s involvement. He had no choice but to leave the sofa and bring this to Isabella’s attention.

In the gym, Isabella was dressed in form-fitting workout attire, relentlessly punching a heavy bag. Sweat glistened on her toned body, her damp skin highlighting her untamed beauty.

Julian, like any man would, was momentarily captivated, but he quickly shook off the distraction. “Isabella, your ex-boyfriend just declared war on Twitter,” he said. “Do you have a moment?”
###Chapter 20

Ex-Fiancé?

“Alexander Whitmore? That disgusting piece of trash?” Isabella’s expression darkened instantly.

“Correct. He issued a public challenge. If you manage to win over the audience with your charm, he’ll owe you one hundred million dollars,” Julian Hawthorne stated calmly.

She scoffed. “Do I look like I need an extra hundred million?” Turning back to her training, she delivered a powerful blow to the heavy bag.

Thump!

The hundred-pound bag swung violently from the impact.

Julian stared, momentarily stunned, though he really shouldn’t have been surprised. This was pure Isabella.

But she wasn’t finished. She pulled off her gloves, grabbed her phone, and typed a swift reply to Alexander.

[Disgusting! AlexanderWhitmore]

She attached a picture of her raised middle finger.

The internet exploded. The nation's most eligible bachelor called 'disgusting' by Isabella Montgomery? A man worth thirty billion dollars publicly given the finger?

[OMG! Is this woman insane? Alexander is perfection! How dare she!]

[No wonder she was disowned. Absolute trash!]

[Too cowardly to accept the challenge? Stop using my future husband for clout!]

[Someone needs to teach her a lesson! I volunteer!]

The hate flooded her mentions, a torrent of vicious comments.

Isabella remained completely unbothered. Their words meant nothing to her. Her phone rang. She answered to hear Harrison Winslow breathing heavily. “Boss! Are you seeing the attacks online?” he gasped.

“Mhmm,” was her simple, uninterested reply.

Harrison was shocked. Who would be stupid enough to come for her? In the last five years, no one had dared cross Isabella Montgomery!

Well, except for Julian, who sometimes had a death wish.

“Boss, should I get on a plane? I can handle this!”

“Unnecessary. Focus on your job. If quarterly profits aren’t up by ten percent, don’t even think about your bonus.” She ended the call without another word.

Harrison was left speechless, a mix of concern and regret washing over him. He shouldn't have called.

Seeing she was off the phone, Julian seized the moment. “The public here prefers humble celebrities. A low profile is advisable. They won’t react well if they discover your true identity, or the power you wield.”

“Relax. I know exactly what I’m doing,” she assured him, already scrolling through her phone again. A thought struck her. She logged back into her social media and posted a new challenge.

[Challenge accepted. If I lose, I pay you ten billion. But if I win, I don’t want your money. I want a live stream of you eating sh*t. Do we have a deal?]

She attached two more photos of her middle finger for emphasis.

Julian could only stare in disbelief. This is her idea of keeping a low profile? When will she ever learn? He sighed, a strange mix of annoyance and amusement twisting inside him.

On the other end, Alexander’s face contorted with rage. How dare she speak to him with such arrogance? This was the same woman who used to follow him around like a pathetic puppy! Fuming, his fingers flew to type a retort, but Victoria stopped him.

“Alexander, darling, don’t be rash. She would not be this confident without a reason. What if she actually wins—”

“Win? Her?” he spat, a cruel laugh escaping him. “I knew her for eighteen years. She was vulgar, talentless, and utterly worthless. Five years abroad doesn’t change that. She’s a paper tiger. Walking a runway requires real skill, confidence, experience. The entire world will be watching, judging her every move. There is no way she can win them all.”

His fingers typed out his reply with furious certainty.

[You’re on. I hope you have ten billion ready!]

He was absolutely convinced of her failure.
###Chapter 21

Isabella let out a cold laugh at Alexander’s response and quickly typed back.

[Someone should decide if they prefer human or cow excrement. Or perhaps pick up stray dog shit off the street?]

Neither side was backing down. A bet worth a century’s fortune had just been made. Fans on Twitter erupted into chaos. A live stream of someone actually eating feces versus ten billion dollars in cash—what could be more insane? Everyone was buzzing with anticipation for Chanel’s show the next day.

Isabella remained perfectly calm. She tossed her phone aside and turned to Julian. “Be ready for tomorrow.”

“Don’t worry. I won’t disappoint you.” With that, Julian turned and left.

He was only her agent, after all. He wouldn’t be staying at her manor. Isabella locked the door behind him and went to bed early.

Victoria, however, wasn’t so relaxed.

She tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Something felt off. Isabella had returned as a completely different person. It was shocking that she could afford the black-green meteorite. As Alexander’s lover, it would be humiliating if he lost the bet.

An idea suddenly sparked in her mind. She got out of bed and knocked on Sophia’s door.

The door opened, revealing Sophia’s confused expression. “Victoria, you’re still awake?”

“Mhm… I can’t stop thinking about Isabella. I’m worried about you,” Victoria sighed.

Sophia frowned. “Worried about me? Why?”

“Oh, Sophia… You saw what Isabella posted online. She’s building an image of being ‘bold and arrogant,’ just like you. And she’s being even more flashy about it.” Victoria paused. “If she dazzles everyone at the show tomorrow night, she might just replace you.”

“Replace me? Is she even capable?” Sophia retorted mockingly, eyeing Victoria. “Victoria, have you lost your mind? I’ve been in this industry for five years. I may not be as popular as you, but I’m one of the country’s top ten supermodels. She’s a nobody. How could she possibly replace me?”

Victoria gripped her hand tightly. “Sophia, the fact that Chanel signed her today proves she has talent. Haven’t you noticed how different she is now? Don’t underestimate her.”

Sophia recalled Isabella’s striking presence on stage. Her face was mesmerizing. Any woman would envy her beauty. Those long, perfectly sculpted legs.

A sudden sense of danger prickled under Sophia’s skin. “Don’t worry. I’ll give it my all. I’ll practice my runway walk right now.”

“One more thing, Sophia: take care of yourself. Isabella has already targeted me twice since she returned. I’m afraid she might come after you, too. Be careful,” Victoria warned softly. “But these are just my suspicions. Isabella is still family. Be kind to her. Don’t make things worse.”

As Victoria disappeared from view, Sophia’s expression darkened. Harm her? Replace her? Over her dead body.

She pulled out her phone and made a call.

…

By 8 a.m. the next day, the entire internet was buzzing about Chanel’s live stream. Isabella woke up early to prepare. But as she was about to leave, she found the door jammed. She tried the knob repeatedly. It was locked from the outside.

She was almost impressed. Someone had the audacity to pull such a childish, low-level stunt right under her nose. Fine. She’d play along.

A cold smirk curled her lips. Instead of forcing the door, she turned back inside.
###Chapter 22

A woman stood guard by the door, her eyes fixed intently. She smirked in satisfaction when the doorknob finally ceased its movement. Confident, she pulled out her phone to report. “Miss Sophia, the plan is proceeding perfectly. Isabella is securely trapped inside.”

“Excellent. Maintain your watch. Ensure she remains confined,” Sophia Kensington replied, her voice dripping with sly approval.

After ending the call, the woman settled into her chair, crossing her legs with a sense of accomplishment.

‘Isabella believes she can use the Chanel show to elevate her status and overshadow Victoria? How delusional. She’s now imprisoned in her own home,’ Sophia thought, smugly convinced that Isabella’s ambitions would crumble.

Isabella had audaciously accepted a wager against Alexander. If she failed to even leave her residence, her humiliation would be absolute.

Sophia chuckled darkly to herself. The image of Isabella becoming a laughingstock online was immensely gratifying.

Her private celebration was abruptly interrupted. A new contact request appeared on WhatsApp from the Montgomery family group. The profile was a stark black image, the username simply ‘Boss Montgomery’.

Who was this? Some relative? Cautiously, Sophia accepted the request. Before she could type a question, a voice message arrived.

[Miss Sophia, everything is going as planned. Isabella can’t get out.]

[Good work. Keep watching, and make sure she doesn’t come out.]

It was the exact recording of her call with her assistant!

Her phone buzzed again with a text from ‘Boss Montgomery’. [Sophia Kensington. Order your assistant to unlock my door immediately. Fail to comply, and I will release this recording publicly. You will share Victoria Kensington’s fate.]

Sophia’s face drained of color. So, ‘Boss Montgomery’ was Isabella Montgomery.

Her fingers flew across the screen in rage. [Isabella! How did you obtain this recording? Are you spying on me? This is illegal!]

A swift reply followed.

[So is unlawfully confining someone. This constitutes the crime of false imprisonment. Under Criminal Law, Article 238, it carries a penalty of up to three years imprisonment, criminal detention, or deprivation of political rights!]

Sophia paled further. Was Isabella seriously threatening her with legal statutes? The repercussions of the recording going viral would be catastrophic. Her reputation would be destroyed.

Her fanbase would abandon her. Grandfather Theodore despised internal family conflict. His punishments were severe—from lashings with a thorned whip to kneeling in the ancestral hall, even revocation of company shares.

Another message flashed.

[Sophia Kensington. You have precisely sixty seconds. If that door isn’t open in time, even if opened later, I will not leave. When my absence from the show makes headlines, this recording will be published. What will people think?]

‘What will people think?’ They would believe Sophia deliberately trapped Isabella all day!

Fury contorted Sophia’s features. She desperately wished to eliminate Isabella, but the clock was ticking. Reluctantly, she dialed her assistant. “Lillian! Unlock the door now! Immediately! You have one minute!”

“What? Why the sudden change?”

“No questions! Just do it! A second late, and you’ll regret it deeply,” Sophia threatened viciously.

Terrified, Lillian ended the call. She grabbed a hammer and frantically smashed the heavy metal chain bolting the door. It had been securely fastened high on the doorframe, impossible to breach from inside. Destroying what she had painstakingly installed took immense effort. Within the minute, sweat soaked her clothes as the lock finally gave way.

The door swung open. Isabella Montgomery emerged, a vision in a crimson gown. Her captivating gaze locked onto Lillian’s. “Have my door repaired. Inform Sophia she wasted thirty-five minutes of my time. She will transfer three hundred and fifty thousand dollars as compensation.”

Three hundred and fifty thousand? That was outright robbery. Was she insane?
###Chapter 23

Isabella wanted to retaliate but Victoria had already swept past her. The sharp staccato of silver heels echoed through the hallway. Every line of her retreating figure radiated unshakable arrogance.

Click. Clack. Click.

Isabella stood frozen, watching until Victoria disappeared from view. Only then did she fumble for her phone. “Sophia, we almost had her! Why did we back down? You should’ve seen her attitude. She demanded I pay for her new door. Claimed we wasted thirty-five minutes of her precious time. She wants three hundred and fifty thousand!”

Three hundred and fifty thousand?

Rage boiled through Sophia. But the memory of that recorded call made her vicious. “This is your entire fault! Why did you call me back? She has the whole conversation! You’re utterly useless.” Her voice was a shrill whip. “The money comes from your salary. Ten thousand a month until it’s paid.”

A monthly deduction of ten thousand? Her entire salary was only twenty! Sophia hung up before she could protest. Arguing was pointless. She was trapped.

Fuming, Sophia quickly typed a warning to Victoria. [She’s dangerous. Got a recording of my call. Tell Alexander to be careful. She’s planning something.]

Victoria read the message, her face darkening. She had manipulated Sophia last night, fueling her hatred, using her as a weapon against Isabella. This defeat was infuriating. If Isabella made it to the show… if she actually won… Would Alexander be forced to humiliate himself live?

Never. She needed another plan.

A cruel idea sparked in her eyes. She turned and strode away without another word.

…

Isabella stood by the roadside outside her manor, waiting. Her booked car had canceled during the confrontation with Lillian. Rush hour meant scarce availability. She was going to be late. Walking was her only option, hoping to flag down a passing car.

The roar of engines interrupted her thoughts. A fleet of luxury sports cars screeched to a halt, encircling her. The lead vehicle was a black Porsche, its sleek body gleaming. Absurdly, its lights, rims, and door handles were painted a garish pink. The clash of colors was tacky, trying too hard to be feminine.

Victoria sat in the passenger seat, makeup flawless, features sharp. She wore a pristine white dress, playing the part of the elegant princess. Her aura was pure condescension.

The other cars held her equally wealthy, sneering friends. Their laughter was sharp and mocking.

“Victoria, isn’t this your charity case sister? The one who boasts about owning hundreds of supercars? The ten-billion-dollar better? Why is she walking?”

“Anyone can lie. I could say I own a thousand jets. Doesn’t make it true.”

“Look at her clothes. Some no-name brand. Lives in the middle of nowhere but talks about billions? She’s a joke. A pathetic one.”

“Please, don’t be cruel. She’s still family.” Victoria’s voice was a sickly sweet simper. She offered a fake, sympathetic smile. “Isabella, you only had to ask. My parents give me a new car every birthday. My garage is overflowing. I’d have given you one. There’s no need for this… walking.”

She poured on the false concern. “Are you going to the show? You’ll be late. Get in. I’ll drive you.” She stepped out and opened the rear door. A large, drooling pug occupied the seat, its fur matted and dirty. It took up most of the space.

The plan was obvious. Get Isabella in the car. Let the dog ‘accidentally’ bite her. A scratch on her face would be ideal. No model with fresh wounds could walk the runway.

Isabella let out a cold, dismissive laugh. Did Victoria truly think she was this stupid? “You think I’d get in that ridiculous eyesore?” Her scorn was palpable. “You believe your cheap, tasteless car is a favor?”

Cheap? Tasteless?

A stunned silence fell. The sheer audacity of the insult left everyone breathless. Even Victoria was momentarily speechless, her perfect mask finally cracking.
###Chapter 24

Victoria’s friends immediately erupted at Isabella’s insult.

“Isabella Montgomery, you’re nothing but a rabid dog biting the hand that feeds you. Can’t tell the difference between kindness and malice? Victoria offered you a ride out of the goodness of her heart. How dare you speak to her like that?”

“What are you even yapping about, you adopted stray? This is a limited edition Lamborghini Sesto Elemento. Only twenty exist in the entire world. It costs over forty million. You should be grateful just to lay eyes on it!”

“Exactly! If you’re so great, why don’t you show up in a better car? All you do is talk. It’s pathetic!”

Their words were venomous. Isabella’s face tightened with disdain. She didn’t even bother to respond.

The girls laughed, mistaking her silence for shame.

“Look at her! She has nothing to say! What a joke!”

“Her lies are catching up to her! She deserves every bit of this!”

“Please, everyone, don’t be so harsh on my sister,” Victoria interjected, her voice dripping with false concern. “Maybe she just doesn’t like Silas. It might not be about the car. Perhaps she’s uncomfortable sitting with him.” She turned to Isabella with a saccharine smile. “I can let you sit in the passenger seat if you prefer. Come on, we don’t want to be late.”

She pushed the passenger door open. Even from the front, she could make sure Silas got a good bite. Maybe he’d even take her head clean off.

Victoria’s friends were clueless about her dark intentions. They only saw her generosity.

“Victoria is such a saint! Isabella Montgomery, what are you waiting for? You ungrateful wretch!”

“Yeah, hurry up! Never been in a car this expensive before? Cat got your tongue?”

“She’s probably never even seen one! How hilarious!”

As they sneered, a shadow blurred past them and pulled to a smooth stop nearby.

The car was a stunning matte black, crafted from carbon fiber and titanium alloy. Its design screamed cutting-edge luxury. The LED headlights glinted with what looked like actual diamond dust.

One of the girls shrieked in recognition. “That’s a Hypersport! There are only seven of those on the planet!”

The group erupted in excitement.

“A Hypersport is worth over a billion! It’s the rarest supercar in existence!”

“I heard the seats are hand-stitched with gold thread. The headlights alone are embedded with diamonds worth a Rolls-Royce.”

“That’s the exact model that jumped between skyscrapers in that movie! The real deal!”

Who could possibly own such an incredible machine? Everyone held their breath, staring at the door.

It opened. A man in a tailored suit stepped out.

Though he was just a driver, he carried himself with a commanding presence that outshone any male model. But what he did next was even more shocking.

He stood rigidly by the car and announced, “Miss Montgomery, I’m here on behalf of my employer to escort you. Please come with me.”

Miss Montgomery? He was here for Victoria Kensington?

“Oh my god, Victoria! Since when do you know someone like that? Why didn’t you tell us?”

“I’m so jealous! Victoria, please, can I just touch it? Just once?”

They gazed at her with pure adoration.

Victoria herself was confused. She didn’t know anyone who owned this car. Maybe some billionaire had seen her viral scandal and sent for her?

A blush crept onto her cheeks. “I… I had no idea, honestly. I can’t believe he sent a car for me!” She turned to Isabella with fake regret. “Oh, Isabella, it seems I can’t give you a ride after all. My driver will take you. I have other plans now.”

She strode toward the Hypersport, chin high, proud as a peacock.

Her friends watched, green with envy. How was she so lucky? Born into the second-richest family in Westchester. Engaged to a perfect man like Alexander Whitmore. And now, a billionaire admirer? No one could ever compete.

But the driver’s brow furrowed. He raised a hand. “My apologies. I am here for Miss Isabella Montgomery.”

What? Isabella Montgomery? Not Victoria?
###Chapter 25

Victoria Kensington stood frozen in utter disbelief. Her face tightened as she struggled to contain the storm of emotions raging inside her. With immense effort, she forced a polite smile. "Sir, there must be some mistake," she said, her voice strained.

Isabella Montgomery had just returned to the country. Hardly anyone knew of her existence. How could some wealthy tycoon possibly know her and send a car specifically for her?

"No mistake," the chauffeur stated flatly. "I'm here for Miss Montgomery. Isabella Montgomery." He deliberately emphasized the name 'Isabella'.

All eyes slowly turned to Isabella, their expressions shifting to stunned silence.

This luxury vehicle was for her? She knew the owner? Impossible! Victoria's face contorted into a mask of pure revulsion. This couldn't be happening.

While everyone remained frozen, the man approached Isabella and gave a formal bow. "Miss Montgomery, your carriage awaits."

Isabella strolled over casually, her critical gaze sweeping over the car. "Hmm... Acceptable, I suppose. Though only seven of these exist globally. An unlucky number. Black also absorbs far too much heat for summer driving. And genuine leather seats?" She tutted disapprovingly. "Does your employer not realize how uncomfortable they become in warm weather?"

The crowd was speechless.

A HyperSport had been sent for her, and she was complaining? Criticizing the number as 'unlucky'? Complaining about the seats? The sheer audacity!

Dominic Sterling's eye twitched. This was classic Isabella Montgomery behavior. She had scorned Mr. Blackwood's diamond ring before, and now she was insulting his HyperSport? What was she even made of?

"Miss Montgomery, please," he said with a sigh, his brow furrowed. "Don't make this difficult. My master was very clear I must bring you. He also sent a gift." Dominic then presented her with an exquisitely crafted wooden box.

Isabella frowned. A young master? With a gift? Who could it be?

She took the box skeptically. Inside was a meticulously prepared breakfast. Rice was shaped into an adorable cartoon character, its eyes crafted from gleaming black pearls. In the bottom corner, a message was written in dark sauce:

[Good luck, Mommy! My Mommy will amaze everyone!]

It was from Christopher Blackwood.

A faint, almost invisible smile touched Isabella's lips as she pictured the boy's round, cheerful face. Her heart softened instantly. 'Fine,' she thought. 'For Momo, I'll go.'

Relief washed over Dominic. He hurried to open the passenger door for her before swiftly taking his place in the driver's seat.

Vroom!

The HyperSport roared to life and sped away, kicking up a cloud of dust and swirling leaves in its wake.

Victoria was sprayed with debris. Leaves tangled in her hair. Dust smudged her pristine white dress. The same so-called 'friends' who had been fawning over her moments ago now watched with barely concealed mockery. They wouldn't dare say it to her face, but she felt their scornful glances like physical blows.

She could no longer hold back her humiliation. She stood there, utterly mortified. The HyperSport was for Isabella, not her. The embarrassment was crushing, a feeling worse than any she had ever experienced.

Her plan had been to delay Isabella, to prevent her from reaching the show on time. Instead, not only had her scheme failed spectacularly, but she had been publicly and utterly humiliated.

No. This wasn't over. She refused to just stand by. Victoria wanted Isabella to fail. She wanted her ruined.

Snatching her phone, she fired off a reply to Sophia Kensington. Her eyes burned with pure, unadulterated malice.

'Just you wait, Isabella. You will be humiliated beyond repair. I will make you pay for this. Ten times over.'
###Chapter 26

At The Grand Mariner.

It was only 9:30 in the morning, but the venue was already packed. The high-stakes wager between Isabella Montgomery and Alexander Whitmore had drawn an unprecedented crowd. Everyone was desperate to witness the showdown. Ticket prices had skyrocketed from a few thousand to twenty thousand dollars apiece due to the frenzy. Even top executives, who were rarely seen in Westchester, had secured front-row seats. They were all there to support Alexander, eager to see what kind of woman would dare to challenge him so publicly.

A sleek black Hypersport pulled up to the service entrance. Dominic Sterling turned to Isabella. "Miss Montgomery, a message from Mr. Blackwood. He said to inform him immediately if you require any assistance. He will handle everything."

"That won't be necessary," she stated flatly. "This is a trivial matter. I don't need his help." Isabella stepped out of the vehicle. As she began to close the door, she paused. "Actually, do relay a message for me. Tell Mr. Blackwood to focus his attention on Christopher. He should stop wasting his time pursuing me. I lack for nothing, least of all male attention. He should abandon this pointless endeavor."

She turned and walked away, her posture radiating an unshakable, regal confidence.

Dominic was left speechless, his face pale. She doesn't lack men? Abandon it? How was he supposed to deliver that message to Nathaniel? He felt a cold dread. Would he be fired for this?

Isabella, however, felt no such hesitation. Her message was clear. She checked the time—9:30. The show started in thirty minutes. She quickened her pace, heading straight for the dressing rooms.

Backstage was pure chaos. Makeup artists darted between models. The manager, Mr. James, was pacing nervously. "Where is Isabella? Why isn't she answering her phone?"

"How unprofessional," Sophia Kensington sneered from her makeup chair. "She's always been arrogant. A nobody pretending to be a star. Mr. James, you never should have given her the closing spot."

"'Shouldn't have hired her'? And who would you suggest? You?"

A cool, cutting voice echoed from the hallway. Isabella strode into the room, her gaze landing dismissively on Sophia. "The model ranked third in all of Westchester... why are you speaking again?"

"You! I am ranked third! What are you? You have no ranking at all! How dare you use that tone with me!" Sophia shot up from her chair, furious.

Isabella let out a derisive laugh. "Precisely. A complete unknown like me was chosen for the finale. Doesn't that prove you're inferior to a newcomer? Are you certain you didn't simply purchase your ranking?"

"You—!" Sophia shoved her assistant and makeup artist aside, lunging toward Isabella.

"Enough!" Mr. James roared. "The show begins in thirty minutes! Everyone, get ready! Anyone who ruins my show will pay ten times the damages!"

The room fell silent instantly. Sophia sat back down, fuming. A makeup artist rushed over to Isabella and began helping her into her outfit.

Mr. James approached Isabella, his expression a mix of anxiety and awe. "Miss Montgomery, I must admit, your audacity is impressive. Because of you, this show is completely sold out. How do you feel? Do you truly believe you can win?"

If she failed, it would damage Chanel's reputation. The company would be criticized for hiring her. He knew better than anyone: a jewelry show wasn't like a fashion show. There were no elaborate costumes or wings. The focus was solely on the jewels. The models simply wore them and walked. How much spectacle could there be? How could one woman possibly stand out?

Isabella remained utterly composed. "Don't worry. I haven't lost to anyone in the last five years." Her tone was as arrogantly confident as ever.

The other supermodels shot her disdainful looks. She was beautiful, yes. But her arrogance was staggering. She was just a woman. Two eyes, a nose, a mouth. What made her so special? Did she think she could just walk out on stage and hypnotize the entire audience? With what? A handful of glitter?

Who did she think she was, going up against Alexander Whitmore, the son of the nation's second-richest man?

Sophia snorted at Isabella's retreating back, seething with impotent rage. Suddenly, her phone screen lit up with a new message.

[Sophia, this is your first major show. Double-check everything. Especially your heels—they can be faulty. Tripping on the runway is the ultimate humiliation for a model. It would destroy your career. Be careful!]

A vicious, calculating gleam flashed in Sophia's eyes as she read the message.

Hmph. Mock me, Isabella? I'll make sure you're run out of the industry for good. You think you can beat Alexander? Not a chance.
###Chapter 27

Time slipped away unnoticed.

It was nearly ten o'clock.

"Places, everyone," an assistant announced backstage to the models. "Line up by the stage. It's starting soon!"

The supermodels rose and arranged themselves according to their assigned numbers. Isabella Montgomery was scheduled to appear last, meaning she had at least thirty minutes before her turn. She relaxed into her seat, settling her mind.

Outside, within the vast expanse of The Grand Mariner, a tall T-stage constructed of semi-translucent colored glass dominated the space. Chairs surrounded it on all sides. The attendees in the hall were among the nation's wealthiest, each having paid a minimum of $200,000 for entry. Outside, standing room tickets had sold for thousands. The audience was abuzz with anticipation—some eager to see the models, others the jewelry. But the main attraction, the topic on everyone's lips, was Isabella Montgomery and her bold promise to 'stun the world.'

To the right of the T-stage, within a secluded area screened by green bamboo, three figures were seated: two adults and a young boy.

Dominic Sterling quietly entered the space. "Mr. Blackwood," he said with clear unease, "Miss Montgomery declined your offer of assistance. She also mentioned—"

"Mentioned what?" Nathaniel Blackwood's tone was sharp.

Dominic hesitated, gathering his nerve. "She suggested you focus your attention on Christopher. That she isn't short of male company. And that you should... give up."

Having delivered the message, Dominic quickly retreated a few steps, wisely avoiding potential fallout.

As predicted, Nathaniel's expression darkened, like the sky moments before a storm. She refused his help? Claimed she didn't lack men? How many men could she possibly have?

Sebastian Blackwood couldn't suppress a loud laugh. "Ha! Who would have thought my brother could be rejected by a woman? My future sister-in-law is truly remarkable."

Nathaniel fixed him with an icy glare. "You should be grateful those three words just saved you."

Sebastian looked puzzled. "Three words?"

"Daddy, what happens now?" Oliver Blackwood's voice wavered, on the verge of tears. "Mommy made a huge bet against that awful man. Can she still win without your help?" He began to sob quietly. "I don't want to see Mommy lose!"

Nathaniel gently ruffled the boy's hair. "Don't worry. Mommy won't lose." His voice was calm, yet carried an unshakable conviction.

Sebastian observed the fire in his brother's eyes whenever Isabella was mentioned. This was the second time he'd seen it. His curiosity got the better of him. "Bro, if you're this serious about Isabella, what about the search for the woman from five years ago? Once we find her, who will you choose? Isabella or her?"

Nathaniel's face instantly grew somber. After a long pause, he replied grimly, "Just continue the search."

At that moment, music filled the air. The lights cut out, plunging the entire hall into absolute darkness—a special feature of The Grand Mariner, designed for events like this. A massive black backdrop blocked all external light, transforming day into night.

Silence fell over the hall. Every eye turned toward the stage. Technicians focused cameras for the live stream, which was being broadcast on multiple platforms. Viewership had already hit ten million before the show began. Now, as it started, the numbers skyrocketed past a hundred million.

The comment sections exploded. Thousands of messages poured in every second. Fans cheered for their favorite models. But a significant portion of the chatter was focused on one thing:

[Here to watch Isabella lose ten billion.]

[+1]

[+10086]

A soft spotlight illuminated the long T-stage, making the modern glass structure gleam with colorful reflections.

The music swelled.

The models began to make their entrance, one after another.
###Chapter 28

Natalia Dubois emerged first on the runway. Her statuesque frame commanded immediate attention. A sleek black mini dress hugged every curve. Platinum waves tumbled over her shoulders like liquid gold. Piercing blue eyes scanned the captivated audience.

The French supermodel wore Chanel's newest collection. Passion. The name suited her intense aura perfectly. A ruby necklace glowed against her pale skin. Matching earrings and bracelets completed the set.

Camera flashes erupted throughout the venue. The crowd murmured in awe. Whispers spread like wildfire among the attendees.

"If Natalia is just the opener... What does that say about Isabella?"

"Who even is this Montgomery girl? She came out of nowhere."

"Probably slept her way to the top. No other explanation."

"Let's see if she lives up to the hype. I bet she trips on the catwalk."

The harsh comments continued unabated. In the VIP section, several men in baseball caps shifted uncomfortably.

One stood up abruptly. "I can't listen to this anymore. Our boss doesn't deserve this disrespect."

Maxwell Carter pulled him back down. "Sit. Isabella's orders were clear. No interference. Unless you want to explain why we ruined her plans."

The man grumbled but complied. "They have no idea who they're mocking."

"Patience," Maxwell said calmly. "They'll eat their words soon enough."

The fashion show progressed flawlessly. Each model embodied their assigned jewelry's essence. Some walked with regal grace. Others exuded modern chic. The audience remained enthralled.

Sophia Kensington made her entrance. A crimson mini dress showcased her enviable figure. She blew a kiss to the crowd. The gesture elicited cheers and whistles.

Meanwhile, the private lounge remained eerily quiet. Nathaniel Blackwood rested with his eyes closed. Christopher slept soundly on his lap, drooling slightly.

Sebastian Blackwood observed the models through a magnifying glass. "Nathaniel, check out this one's proportions! Perfect hourglass shape!" He nudged his brother. "And this model's legs go on forever!"

Nathaniel showed no reaction. His breathing remained steady. Christopher stirred but didn't wake.

Suddenly, an announcer's voice cut through the music. "And now... The moment you've all been waiting for! Isabella Montgomery!"

Nathaniel's eyes snapped open instantly. Christopher jolted awake beside him. Both focused intently on the stage.

Every head in the auditorium turned. All eyes fixed on the runway's entrance. The air grew thick with anticipation.

Backstage, Sophia watched the large screen with a venomous smile. 'This is it, Isabella. Time to face your humiliation.'

She envisioned Isabella's career ending tonight. Public disgrace awaited the so-called heiress.

The music shifted to something ethereal. A hush fell over the crowd. All breathing seemed to stop.

Then... A silhouette appeared from the shadows. Gasps echoed through the silent hall.

###Chapter 29

A silhouette of pure ethereal grace materialized on the runway.

Under the spotlight, she seemed almost unclothed, every contour and shadow of her form starkly visible. A swan-like neck. A waist so narrow it defied reality. Legs that stretched for miles in elegant lines.

Not an ounce of superfluous flesh marred her perfection. She was a masterpiece carved by divine hands. A figure born for the runway.

But was she truly bare? Had she resorted to this for victory?

Nathaniel’s expression hardened. His hands flew up, shielding Oliver’s and Sebastian’s eyes. A foreign, searing anger ignited in his chest. Isabella’s words echoed, ‘Strolling on the beach in a bikini.’

Had she always been this brazen?

The audience sat in stunned silence. A few mouths hung open, the word ‘goddess’ trapped on their lips.

On the live stream, comments exploded. [Holy hell! Can we report Chanel for indecency?]

Then, Isabella took another step forward. The illusion shattered. She wore a gown the exact shade of her skin, expertly wrapped around her torso.

The fabric was a whisper-soft, exquisite silk. Weightless as mist, seamless against her skin, it veiled yet revealed, creating the breathtaking nude illusion. Tiny, irregular diamonds were scattered across the material, catching the low light like a thousand distant stars. She wore the night sky itself.

A long, silken cape of the same ethereal hue flowed from her arms. It billowed with her movement, a swirl of spectral smoke, dreamlike and utterly captivating.

The sheer, skin-toned dress didn’t diminish her elegance. It elevated it. She was a celestial being descended from the heavens. Regal. Untouchable. Exquisite.

The lights plunged into total darkness, swallowing the hall.

A single, soft beam found the jade necklace at her collarbone. The faint green stone glowed with an enchanting light. Her dazzling dress, somehow, did not overpower it.

Then, a firefly sparked to life from the jade. Then another. And another. They swirled around her, a growing constellation of light. Dozens became hundreds, then thousands, flooding the pitch-black venue.

The air filled with a slow-dancing universe of ethereal light. The hall transformed into a scene from a fantasy realm, a magical world that stole the breath from every lung.

Awe was inescapable.

“My God… It’s stunning!”

“Fireflies! Where did they all come from?”

“Is this a movie set? How is this possible?”

“This is unbelievable! Completely surreal!”

The Chanel team was just as baffled. That dress wasn’t theirs. Those fireflies… they were clueless. How could Isabella have hidden thousands of fireflies in a necklace? It was impossible.

Only Nathaniel understood. He recognized the cutting-edge 3D holographic imaging. It projected hyper-realistic, three-dimensional illusions into space.

Very few corporations had access to this technology. How did an adopted woman like Isabella command it so flawlessly?

Alexander and his associates stared, utterly confounded. They had been desperately trying to acquire this exact patent from major tech firms. And here she was, wielding it for a fashion show? And with such devastating effect.

Alexander’s face darkened. Was this captivating, breathtaking vision really the same plain, unattractive Isabella Montgomery he’d discarded?

Julian Hawthorne, backstage controlling the projection, froze. His heart lurched into his throat as her balance faltered.

In the private booth, Nathaniel instinctively shoved Oliver aside, his body coiling to spring into action. The distance was too great. He’d never make it in time.

A collective gasp ripped through the magical atmosphere. Every spectator held their breath.

Would she fall?

Sophia, her jealousy momentarily forgotten, felt a vicious thrill.

‘Finally! The humiliation!’ she crowed internally. A fall here, in front of everyone, would end Isabella’s pathetic career before it began.

All watched, hearts lodged in throats, as her body tilted irrevocably toward the ground. Just as she was about to crash…
###Chapter 30

Isabella spun with liquid grace, the silk cape whipping upward in a fluid arc.

The fabric hung suspended for a heartbeat, a shimmering ribbon against the dark.

Then, with a sharp tug, she used its momentum to swing her body clear of the stage.

She soared.

The silk became her wings, carrying her in a lazy, hypnotic circle above the gasping crowd.

Her nude tulle dress floated around her, ethereal and weightless.

The cape billowed like a stormy sea beneath her.

A thousand fireflies swirled, a constellation of living stars framing her flight.

She was a phantom, a creature of myth stepped out of a forgotten tale.

Breathtaking. Otherworldly.

She moved with the effortless elegance of smoke, a goddess smiling down at her captivated subjects.

In one seamless motion, she hooked her legs mid-swing.

She reached down and slipped off her heels. “Who wants them?”

Her voice, a low purr, wrapped around the audience.

Seductive. Hypnotic.

The reaction was instantaneous.

A tidal wave of people surged to their feet.

“Me! Over here!”

Oliver bounced on his toes, tiny voice lost in the roar. “Mommy! Give them to Daddy!”

A knowing smirk touched Isabella’s lips.

She tied the shoes to the end of the cape and flung them into the crowd.

Chaos erupted.

A scrum of bodies fought for the prize, a frenzy of grasping hands.

“I had them first!”

“Get off! They’re mine!”

Maxwell and his team moved with lethal precision, diving into the fray.

Their boss’s property would not be claimed by some stranger.

A pair of discarded shoes had set the room on fire.

Isabella watched the madness she’d created, a sorceress pleased with her spell.

She descended, landing softly on the runway with the cape pooled around her bare feet.

She turned, utterly unbothered, and walked toward the shadows backstage.

Barefoot, she commanded the stage.

Her long legs, her statuesque height, the dress clinging like a second skin.

She was a vision from an ancient scroll, timeless and untouchable.

Every eye followed her retreat, hypnotized by the sway of her hips, the line of her back.

The moment she disappeared, the fireflies winked out of existence.

Darkness swallowed the hall once more.

Silence held for three full seconds.

Then, the explosion.

The crowd swarmed Theodore Montgomery, chanting her name. “Isabella Montgomery! Encore! Encore!”

Nathaniel’s gaze narrowed at the mob surrounding the old man.

He glanced at Sebastian. “Handle it.”

Sebastian, still dazed, snapped to attention. “No one touches my future sister-in-law.” He sprang into action.

A smirk of pure possession curled Nathaniel’s mouth.

He took his son’s hand. “Let’s go.”

“Where, Daddy?” Oliver asked, confused.

“To find your mother.”

Backstage, models flocked around Isabella, their voices a chorus of awe.

Her dress was a masterpiece, something from a luxury house’s vault.

Her recovery from disaster, her transformation of it into magic, was legendary.

Isabella Montgomery was a star, born tonight.

Sophia Kensington burned with a jealousy so sharp it tasted like metal.

Her fists were clenched so tight her nails bit into her palms.

This wasn’t supposed to happen. She was supposed to fall. She was supposed to fail.

Sophia shoved through the adoring circle and grabbed Isabella’s arm. “What was that?” she hissed. “Where did those insects come from? That dress?”

She’d seen the organizer’s cheap garment before the show.

Without that cape, without that gown, the fall would have been inevitable.

Isabella’s eyes turned to ice. “Who are you to question me? I owe you no explanations.”

The audacity. The sheer arrogance.

This orphan, this nobody they’d pulled from the gutter, dared to speak to her like this?

“Have you lost your mind?” Sophia spat. “You’re a charity case! Without our family’s pity, you’d be dead in a ditch! How dare you use that tone with me? I should slap the ingratitude out of you right now!”

“Try it,” Isabella dared, a cold laugh in her throat. She held out her hands, then gestured to her face and legs. “Pick your spot. These hands are insured for five million. This face? Ten. These legs? A billion. Go on. I dare you to lay a single finger on me.”
###Chapter 31

Isabella’s voice was cold, but it carried a hidden edge.

Sophia felt like the ground had dropped beneath her feet.

A billion in insurance?

How could that be?

Was she made of solid gold?

Isabella’s warning was clear.

If anything happened to her, the insurance company would come after Sophia.

“Go on, hit me,” Isabella taunted. “What’s wrong? Scared?”

She cracked her knuckles.

The sound was sharp.

Sophia flinched.

“What are you doing?” she stammered. “There are people everywhere! You can’t hit me here!”

“Watch me,” Isabella shot back.

She swung her fist hard into Sophia’s upper arm.

Then she delivered a powerful kick to her heel.

A sharp crack echoed.

Sophia’s gemstone bracelet shattered.

Her stiletto heel snapped in two.

Isabella had broken both with bare hands and one kick.

Sophia stumbled, off-balance.

Rage and pain twisted her face.

“Isabella! Do you have any idea how much that bracelet cost? Half a million! I only wore it once!”

“So?” Isabella’s gaze was icy. “You broke my heel. I broke your bracelet and yours. Consider it payback. Double. Try something like this again, and I’ll return it tenfold.”

With that, she shoved Sophia aside and walked away.

Humiliated, Sophia dropped into a chair, stunned.

How did she know? She’d been so careful. No one saw.

Isabella entered her dressing room.

Julian had prepared this before the show.

A precaution against schemers like Sophia.

She was no fool.

She’d hidden a thin steel wire in her cape.

That wire allowed her aerial stunt.

Though she wore protective gear, the impact still left a deep cut.

“Let’s hope the headlines are worth the blood,” she murmured.

She changed and headed for the back exit.

But outside, a crowd swarmed her.

“Isabella Montgomery! I’m a huge fan! I’ll pay you to walk again!”

“Isabella, I booked us a table at a Michelin-star restaurant! Come with me!”

“I bought you a diamond necklace! I’ll get you anything you want!”

“Isabella, I’m from Vogue! Give me a moment!”

“Isabella! Look this way!”

Dozens pressed in.

Some grabbed her arms.

Reporters shoved microphones in her face.

She couldn’t move.

Then, hands groped her waist.

Someone tugged at her clothes.

A sleeve began to tear.

Her eyes narrowed.

She was ready to fight.

Suddenly, a team of bodyguards in black pushed through.

“Make way! Now!”

They formed a protective circle around her.

Their leader spoke curtly. “Miss Montgomery, Master Christopher sent us to escort you out.”

Christopher. Oliver Blackwood.

She didn’t want to owe him.

But she had no choice.

She allowed them to lead her away.

Surrounded by guards, she moved like royalty.

Fans watched helplessly as she left.

Paparazzi snapped photos from every angle.

Amelia watched from a distance, boiling with envy.

Isabella’s first show was a triumph.

Her popularity was skyrocketing.

And those bodyguards… they weren’t ordinary.

The ones Amelia hired for fifty thousand were nothing compared to these.

These men looked premium. A hundred thousand a month, at least.

What had Isabella been doing in Africa for five years?

How did she return like this?

Amelia had to know.

She pulled out her phone and called Lillian.

“Use all our resources. I want to know everything about Isabella’s time in Africa. Every detail.”
###Chapter 32

The bodyguards cleared a path as Isabella Montgomery stepped into the waiting limousine.

Her breath caught. Nathaniel Blackwood occupied the rear seat. Worse, Sebastian Blackwood was behind the wheel again. Was she doomed to relive that nightmare?

She instinctively reached for the door handle. But the screaming fans and flashing cameras outside made escape impossible. In that moment of hesitation, Sebastian hit the accelerator. The car surged forward, leaving no time for protest.

A sudden idea sparked in Isabella’s mind. Her eyes narrowed with determination.

She shifted closer to Nathaniel.

Seeing her approach, his gaze darkened with anticipation. A visible swallow moved his throat. She was already beside him, her hand reaching toward his waist.

Oliver—in the front passenger seat—instantly covered his eyes. Sebastian flipped the rearview mirror down, avoiding any distraction.

Isabella’s fingers searched along Nathaniel’s waistline. Feeling her soft touch, he smirked. "Miss Montgomery, if you're interested, my abs and chest offer a better experience."

She rolled her eyes. "In your dreams." She tugged the seatbelt from behind him and clicked it into place. "I’m ensuring you don’t crush another one of my dresses. They’re not disposable." She then secured her own belt tightly and sat rigidly upright, putting maximum distance between them.

So it was just about the seatbelt. Sebastian readjusted the mirror with a disappointed sigh. Oliver lowered his hands, his hopeful expression fading.

‘Why is Mommy so resistant? How will they ever reconnect at this rate?’ The boy’s large, worried eyes darted as he schemed.

In the back, a tense silence stretched like a chasm. Oliver grew anxious. This couldn’t be it. Wasting a perfect opportunity was unthinkable. As the car approached the city limits, an idea struck him.

He suddenly clutched his stomach, letting out a pained groan.

Sebastian immediately pulled over. "Oliver? What's wrong?"

"My stomach… it hurts so much," Oliver whimpered, his voice weak. "I didn’t eat breakfast…"

Sebastian’s brow furrowed. "That’s serious. It could be the start of a gastric issue. You need food now."

"R-Really?" Oliver feigned shock, then turned a guilt-ridden face toward Isabella. "Mommy… can you please take me to get something to eat?" His whimpers intensified. "Waa… it really hurts…"

"You look pale. Your father and uncle should take you. I'll grab a cab," Isabella said, already moving to unbuckle her belt.

"No!" Oliver’s cry was too forceful for a sick child. He quickly softened his tone, breathing shallowly. "Waa… Mommy… I don’t want to go with them. They always pick spicy food! It’s terrible! I just want something gentle for my stomach, but they never listen!"

He dropped his head, fake tears welling in his eyes. "They say eating spice makes me grow up faster. I always obey because I don’t have a mommy. Nobody loves me. I have to be good. I have to be a good boy… But now…" His crying escalated. "My stomach is on fire! Spicy food will kill me! Waaa… I don’t want to die! Waaa…!"

Nathaniel and Sebastian were utterly speechless. Since when did they force-feed him chili?

The act worked perfectly on Isabella. Her heart melted at his desperate sobs. She quickly opened her door and rushed to gather him into her arms.
###Chapter 33

Nathaniel and Sebastian trailed closely behind Isabella and Oliver.

They stepped into the small eatery. Isabella ordered a warm pot of congee with several side dishes. After the server left, she fixed her gaze on the two men across from her. "Do neither of you have any common sense? He's just a little boy. Spicy food is completely inappropriate. That tall tale about spicy food making you grow taller is absolute nonsense. How could educated men like you believe such foolishness?"

Sebastian opened his mouth to protest.

Nathaniel kicked him sharply under the table. He adopted a serious, attentive expression. "You're absolutely right, Miss Montgomery. I'll be more mindful. Are there any other points I should remember?"

"Mommy," Oliver interjected, seizing the opportunity. "Daddy enrolls me in endless tutoring. My classes run until midnight every single night." He continued, his voice small. "And he leaves me alone at home most of the time. We only share one meal a week. He takes me out to play just once a month." A sad sigh escaped him. "All my friends have parents who play with them. I'm always by myself."

Her heart ached for the child. Isabella's expression hardened as she turned to Nathaniel. "Mr. Blackwood, this is entirely unacceptable. He carries your blood. You are his father. That comes with responsibility. He's a young child. Why burden him with so many classes? He isn't a machine. He deserves a joyful childhood. Furthermore..." She continued, listing his parental failings without pause.

Nathaniel didn't interrupt. He listened quietly, periodically refilling her water glass. When she finally finished, he pulled out his phone. "Miss Montgomery, would you provide me with your number? This way, you can continue to advise me on parenting matters in the future."

"Yes, Mommy," Oliver chimed in, nodding vigorously. "You have to remind Daddy every day. Otherwise, he'll forget everything you said."

Without a second thought, Isabella took out her own phone and added him on WhatsApp. Sebastian watched, utterly bewildered. How had this happened so quickly? They were exchanging contacts now?

Suddenly, Isabella's phone screen lit up. The caller ID showed 'Julian'. As her agent and friend, he only called for urgent matters.

She excused herself quickly and stepped outside to answer.

A flicker of jealousy tightened Nathaniel's chest. Julian. A man's name.

Sebastian leaned in, muttering, "Don't worry. I'll find out who that is."

Outside, Isabella listened to Julian's report.

"Two things, Bella. Maxwell found the guest list from The Ritz-Carlton five years ago…"

The name hit her like a physical blow. The Ritz-Carlton. Her body went rigid. Instinctively, she glanced back into the restaurant.

Nathaniel was carefully selecting food for Oliver. He noticed her look and gave a slight nod. A strange, unexplainable feeling washed over her. She felt a powerful urge to keep the incident from five years ago hidden from him.

"We'll discuss this when I return," she said swiftly, ending the call.

Nathaniel studied her tense posture. "Is everything alright?" he asked, his voice laced with concern.

"It's nothing important," Isabella replied, her brow furrowed. Why was she so worried about Nathaniel discovering the truth about that night? The reaction was puzzling, even to her.

She collected herself, her tone becoming brisk. "Something has come up. I need to leave. The repair shop is delivering my motorcycle. Take good care of him. No more spicy food."

"Mommy!" Oliver scrambled from his seat, clinging to her leg. He didn't want her to go.

She gently ruffled his hair. "Be good, sweetheart. I've added your father on WhatsApp. I'll be watching him closely to make sure he treats you properly."

"Okay! But you have to promise to video call me," Oliver beamed, his large, pleading eyes making him look like a hopeful kitten.

Isabella nodded. As she turned to leave, Nathaniel stood and followed her. "I'll walk you out."
###Chapter 34

Isabella tried to stop him, but Nathaniel was already heading out the door.

Fine.

Her motorcycle was conveniently parked right outside the restaurant. The technician handed her the keys.

She swung her leg over the bike in one fluid motion.

“Wait.” Nathaniel stepped in front of her, his hand closing around her wrist.

She instinctively tried to pull away, but he was already holding a small bottle of ointment. He gently applied it to her cut with his fingertip.

He was… tending to her injury?

His grip was firm yet careful as he smoothed the cream over her skin. He treated the wound with the reverence of a master artisan handling a priceless artifact. Then, he produced a narrow roll of gauze and wrapped it neatly around her forearm.

“Keep it dry for the next seventy-two hours. Try to minimize use of this hand,” he instructed, his voice a low, resonant murmur that vibrated through her.

Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic rhythm she hadn't felt in years. No one had shown her such deliberate, gentle care since before her world fell apart. The memory of that betrayal five years ago sliced through the moment, cold and sharp. She wrenched her arm back. “Thank you. Take care of Christopher.”

The engine roared to life beneath her. The motorcycle shot forward, a streak of crimson and steel. Her dark hair whipped wildly in the wind, the red dress a defiant banner against the fading light. She was a vision of untamed, breathtaking resolve, seemingly impervious to everything in her wake. Nathaniel’s expression darkened as he watched her disappear.

The tires of her bike crunched on the gravel driveway of Rosewood Manor. Julian Hawthorne was waiting inside, perched on the edge of a sofa, a manila folder resting on his knee.

“The list?” she asked, striding into the room.

“Maxwell is running deep background checks on every name. Results should be in shortly. However,” he said, his tone shifting, “there’s a more pressing issue.” He placed the folder on the coffee table. “Someone is digging. They’re investigating your five years in Africa. Due to an oversight on my part, this photograph was discovered.”

He slid a single photo across the polished surface.

In it, Isabella stood radiant in a crimson bandeau gown. Beside her was a man of regal bearing, his attire dripping with opulence, every finger adorned with massive, glittering diamond rings. He was presenting her with a diamond the size of a pigeon’s egg.

Her brow furrowed. “This was supposed to be destroyed. If they connect the dots…”

“All other copies were. It seems Harrison Winslow kept one for himself. Sophia Kensington now has it,” Julian stated, closing the folder. “We can silence her. Or buy off every major media outlet to contain it.”

“No. It’s too late for that.” Isabella walked to the sideboard and poured a glass of water. She swirled the liquid, watching it spin. “If she’s found it, then let her play her hand. I just hope she’s prepared for the consequences.” Her voice was deceptively light, laced with a chilling promise of retribution.

Julian’s frown deepened. “You want to expose her ourselves?”

“It’s insignificant.”

That same evening, Twitter erupted.

#IsabellaMontgomery

#IsabellaFireflies

#IsabellaFlawlessFall

#IsabellaHeels

#Chanel160thAnniversary

#3DHolographicImaging

#AlexanderWhitmoreEatsShit

Six of the top ten trending topics were about Isabella. Clips of her performance were everywhere, transformed into animated GIFs and viral videos on platforms like YouTube, amassing millions of views and an avalanche of praise.
###Chapter 35

The internet erupted in a frenzy of adoration.

Comments flooded in, each more awestruck than the last.

“OMG! Isabella Montgomery is a goddess! That walk, those legs, her presence…utterly hypnotic! A supermodel reborn!”

“Other models have one good feature. She has them all. Her face, her legs, her aura…every inch of her radiates power. I’m obsessed.”

“Now I get her ‘sit back and watch’ comment. No wonder she took the finale from Victoria. Honestly, Victoria would’ve face-planted in those heels.”

“Agreed. Isabella owns the stage. Confidence is everything.”

“Didn’t Victoria Kensington trip and look pathetic? Isabella is my queen.”

Netizens crowned Isabella a hero. Even her former critics publicly apologized.

On Alexander Whitmore’s feed, the tone was starkly different.

“Wow. National Husband really has to eat shit on live stream? That’s gonna be disgusting.”

“You had a chance to perform too, right? Be a man and honor the bet. Stream it!”

“No way! Absolutely not! Isabella was just average to me.”

“Be civil. Admit when you’re wrong. She was stunning. Try to negotiate your way out of this.”

“Yeah, eating actual feces is impossible. Surely she’ll accept something else?”

In a luxurious restaurant, Alexander scowled at his phone. He never imagined Isabella would look so commanding, so devastatingly beautiful. His plan had spectacularly backfired.

He had issued the challenge publicly. As CEO of Whitmore Enterprises, backing out would destroy his credibility. But eating actual waste? The thought was unbearable.

Victoria sat beside him, seething with jealousy as she read the forums. That should have been her on that stage, captivating everyone. Isabella had ruined her reputation with that leaked video. Now she was a laughingstock, forced into hiding.

Worse, she saw the captivated look in Alexander’s eyes as he stared at Isabella’s photos. She couldn’t let that usurper steal her spotlight…or her man.

An idea formed. She lowered her head and began to sob softly. “Alexander, darling… I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. The 3D projection was my idea. I was brainstorming for my finale, and Isabella must have overheard me discussing it with my assistant. To use it against you like this…”

Alexander stared at her, shocked. “The projection was your idea?”

“It was. I spent weeks researching it, perfecting it for my show. You can ask my assistant if you don’t believe me.” Victoria shot a look at her assistant, Sophia, who was hovering nearby, and signaled her over.

Sophia hurried forward. “It’s true, Mr. Whitmore! Miss Kensington worked tirelessly on it. She stayed up for nights—”

“Sophia, don’t,” Victoria interrupted with a choked sob. “It’s my fault. If I hadn’t been so careless, she never would have stolen it. Her victory today… it’s because of my work. It’s all my fault.” She cried silently, playing the victim perfectly.

Alexander immediately pulled her into an embrace. “Don’t cry. I don’t blame you. This is Isabella’s fault! I wondered how she could be so clever. She stole your idea! What a shameless, vile woman!”

“Alexander, maybe… maybe I should go to her. She’s my sister. If I beg her, she might let you out of the bet.” Victoria made a move to stand, feigning resolve.

He held her tighter. “Absolutely not. You are the heiress of the Kensington family. My future wife. You will not debase yourself before that woman. We will find another way. There has to be another way.”

“Of course there is,” a confident, angry voice cut in. “I have information that will destroy Isabella Montgomery.”

Victoria and Alexander looked up to see Sophia Kensington striding toward their table.

“Sophia? What are you talking about?” Victoria asked, feigning confusion.

“I had someone dig into Isabella’s past five years. What they found is… very interesting. Look.” Sophia sat down opposite them and placed her phone on the table.
###Chapter 36

Alexander and Victoria stared at Isabella’s phone screen.

A photo of Isabella Montgomery standing beside a man in royal regalia filled the display.

The man was handing her a massive, glittering diamond.

They looked intimate. Happy.

Alexander’s brow furrowed. “Isn’t that Harrison Winslow? The Diamond Prince of South Africa?”

“Exactly,” Sophia confirmed, a vicious smirk twisting her lips. “That’s her sugar daddy. The reason she’s rolling in cash. Imagine this photo going viral. Her glorious comeback? Ruined. Alexander’s live-stream promise? Forgotten. She’ll be finished.”

Victoria masked her thrill behind a facade of concern. “But… Prince Harrison is married. His wedding to Princess Arabella was a global spectacle. They’re a beloved couple. If this gets out, Isabella will be branded a home-wrecker. Public opinion will destroy her.”

“So what?” Sophia snapped. “After everything she’s done to you? She deserves it. She’s living lavishly on another woman’s husband’s money. She should be exposed. She should feel the shame.”

Alexander’s expression turned to ice. “So this is her transformation. Five years abroad, and she becomes a mistress. If she chooses this path, she must face the consequences.”

Victoria gave a reluctant, almost pained nod. “I suppose… it must be done. For her own good. Maybe the media scrutiny will make her see reason. Make her stop hurting their family.”

That night, the headline exploded across the internet.

[ISABELLA MONTGOMERY SEDUCES SOUTH AFRICA’S DIAMOND PRINCE!]

Sophia’s post accompanied the viral story.

“We were overjoyed at Isabella’s return to the Montgomery family. But her sudden, immense wealth was shocking. The black-green meteorite. The properties. The fleet of hypercars. Our family provided a modest allowance. Where did this fortune truly come from?”

“My contacts in South Africa uncovered the truth. Isabella is a home-wrecker. Not just any, but the mistress of Diamond Prince Harrison Winslow! She chose money over morals, destroying a beautiful marriage.”

“I despise women like her. Popularity? Fans? I don’t care about the backlash. Justice must be served!”

The post included damning photos. Isabella with the meteorite. Isabella on the Hypersport. Isabella surrounded by bodyguards. A life of obscene luxury.

And finally, the photo with Prince Harrison.

The comments section erupted.

“OMG! Her money makes sense now! Prince Harrison’s mistress!”

“She didn’t just sleep with anyone. She bagged a prince. No wonder she’s so arrogant.”

“Prince Harrison and Princess Arabella’s wedding was legendary! 99 wedding cars! They were perfect! How could she ruin that?”

“Disgusting! Destroying a family for money! Morally bankrupt!”

“No wonder she threw shoes on set! Her only talent is seducing married men! What a slut!”

“Home-wrecker! Shameless! I stand with Sophia! Boycott this gold-digging whore!”

The public forgot Alexander’s promised live-stream. The scandal was all-consuming.

Isabella’s new fans, fickle from a single show, abandoned her instantly.

Isabella was at home, a silk mask smoothing her skin, when her phone began buzzing incessantly.

It wouldn’t stop.

She reached for it, answering to the sound of Maxwell Carter’s frantic, panicked breathing.
###Chapter 37

“Boss, we have a situation!” Maxwell’s voice crackled through the phone. “Photos of you and Harrison Winslow are all over the internet. The forums are exploding.”

He took a sharp breath. “And Sophia Kensington just leaked your address. Paparazzi are swarming your location right now.”

Isabella Montgomery remained perfectly still. A handheld device hummed softly against her skin, casting a cool blue glow across her features.

“Should I arrange a safe house?” Maxwell pressed, urgency tightening his tone. “They’ll have you surrounded within minutes.”

“Since when do I hide?” Her reply was ice-cold and detached. She didn’t flinch.

“What’s the plan then? Should I release a counter-statement? Start damage control?”

“Not yet. It’s too early.” Her voice was firm. Final. She ended the call.

A low rumble echoed from outside. Isabella moved to the window.

Dozens of vehicles screeched to a halt outside Rosewood Manor. Reporters and photographers surged forward like a tidal wave. Her security team formed a barricade, but the crowd pushed harder, shouting, shoving, relentless.

Within moments, the villa was completely surrounded. The noise escalated into a chaotic roar.

“Isabella Montgomery! Did you have an affair with Harrison Winslow?”

“Are you the reason he’s separating from Princess Arabella?”

“Give us a statement! How long has this been going on?”

The questions were vicious, pointed, designed to provoke. Isabella’s recent success at the Chanel show had put her on the map, but this—this scandal with a prince—catapulted her into a different kind of spotlight. The kind that burns.

She didn’t react. Her expression was unreadable. Calm.

They began pounding on the doors and windows, their faces pressed against the glass. The vibrations rattled through the quiet house.

A slow, knowing smile touched Isabella’s lips. She turned and walked upstairs.

The second floor housed a secure control room. Banks of monitors glowed softly in the dim light. She approached the main panel without hesitation.

Her fingers pressed a sequence of bright red buttons.

A deep, mechanical groan shook the entire property. From concealed slots around the estate’s perimeter, massive electric fences slammed down. They formed a perfect, impenetrable cage around the villa, buzzing with raw voltage.

The crowd outside recoiled in unison. Shouts of alarm turned into screams of pure terror. Cameras dropped. They scrambled backward, tripping over each other.

Even Maxwell and his team, hidden in the shadows, stared in stunned silence.

“She installed a military-grade defense system,” one of his men whispered, awe in his voice. “That tech isn’t even legal for residential use.”

Maxwell’s face was grim. “This is just the first layer. Let’s hope we never see the others.”

Their worry for her evaporated. She was always ten steps ahead.

Isabella emerged on the second-floor balcony. A glass of wine was in her hand. She looked down at the chaotic scene below with utter indifference. She took a slow sip.

Then, a sudden thought struck her. Her eyes scanned the secured compound below.

A cold dread settled in her stomach.

She had forgotten something critical. Something important.
###Chapter 38

Though she had renovated Rosewood Manor after returning from Africa, Isabella still lacked some daily essentials. Her staff delivered fresh ingredients every morning, but she never kept snacks in the house. Right now, there was absolutely nothing edible available. To make matters worse, her stomach had started cramping painfully. She checked her own pulse and realized her period would arrive in five days—and she had no sanitary pads at the manor!

Meanwhile, at the Blackwood Estate…

Oliver came running toward Nathaniel, clutching a phone tightly. “Daddy, there’s trouble! Mommy looks like she’s trapped inside her house!” he cried, his small voice trembling with worry. “She’s walking around everywhere, like she’s searching for something!” He handed the phone over to his father.

The device was linked to a high-tech drone no bigger than a leaf. Equipped with a four-million-pixel pinhole camera, it could capture crystal-clear images through glass from hundreds of meters away.

When the camera zoomed in, Nathaniel saw Isabella pacing restlessly inside the villa, one hand pressed against her lower abdomen. As a grown man, he understood immediately what was happening. He pocketed the phone and scooped Oliver into his arms.

“Are we going to see Mommy, Daddy?” Oliver asked, eyes bright with excitement.

“Yes,” Nathaniel replied simply. He carried the boy out to the car and buckled him into the backseat.

Nathaniel drove at high speed until they reached a luxury shopping mall. After parking, he turned to Oliver. “Wait for me here. Clear the paparazzi outside Rosewood Manor before we arrive.”

“Don’t worry, Daddy. I can handle it.” Oliver puffed out his chest confidently and pulled out an iPad.

Inside the mall, Nathaniel grabbed a shopping cart and began scanning the aisles. It was his first time in such a place, but he adapted quickly. Still, he couldn’t ignore the stares from other shoppers.

He filled the cart rapidly—fresh vegetables, gourmet snacks, essential groceries.

Then he reached the feminine hygiene aisle. Nathaniel froze, momentarily overwhelmed by the sheer variety of products. Shoppers around him whispered and stared in admiration.

“That man is unbelievably handsome! Way hotter than any supermodel or celebrity!”

“Oh my god, is he really buying pads? So gorgeous and thoughtful! I want a man like that!”

“Who’s his girlfriend? She’s the luckiest woman alive! I’d trade places with her in a heartbeat!”

Women nearby pulled out their phones, snapping pictures discreetly. As the crowd thickened, Nathaniel grabbed one of every type of pad on the shelf. He pushed two overflowing carts toward the checkout.

Cashiers rushed to assist him, their hearts racing just from being near him.

His purchases were packed into several large bags. Suddenly, five bodyguards in black appeared, loading the bags into the car. As Nathaniel reached the exit, he turned to Dominic. “Handle everyone who took photos.”

“Understood,” Dominic nodded, moving off to erase every digital trace.

Back at Rosewood Manor, Isabella lay on her sofa, debating whether to ask her security team to disperse the paparazzi gathered outside. It felt trivial to assign them such a minor task.

Just then, a firm knock sounded at the door. One, two, three raps—steady and evenly spaced.

Had she forgotten to activate the high-voltage security grid? Who could be knocking?

Frowning, she moved to the window and looked down. Two figures stood at her door—one tall, one small. Nathaniel wore heavily insulated gloves. Beside him stood little Oliver, adorable as always.

How did they get through? Where were the paparazzi?

As if sensing her gaze, Oliver looked up and shouted, “Mommy, open up! We brought you groceries!”
###Chapter 39

Isabella noticed Nathaniel and Oliver carrying several shopping bags. She had no alternative but to enter the control room and press two red buttons. The security gates at the main entrance retracted smoothly.

Nathaniel stepped inside the manor, holding Oliver's hand. He placed the grocery bags on the table. When Isabella came downstairs, she found her table covered with packages, including multiple bags filled with sanitary pads.

An involuntary smile touched her lips. "Why so many?"

There were enough pads to last an entire year.

"I wasn't sure which brand you preferred, so I bought one of each," Nathaniel stated bluntly, his expression neutral.

"How much do I owe you? I'll transfer the money."

"Mommy, these are for you! Daddy got them specially! But if you really want to repay him, you could just hug and kiss me," Oliver chirped, stepping forward with his chubby arms outstretched.

Isabella initially intended to refuse, but his adorable pouting face melted her resistance. She bent down and lifted him into her arms. "Sweetheart, you shouldn't be so wasteful. Money doesn't come easily, and I need to reimburse him."

"But you're my Mommy, and we're family! It's perfectly fine," Oliver insisted cheerfully.

Isabella gently stroked his cheek and spoke softly. "Darling, I know you care about me, but I'm not actually your mother. Do you understand that?"

"Yes, Mommy," Oliver replied casually.

She decided to drop the subject, reasoning that their interactions would be limited anyway. Turning to Nathaniel, she said, "It's getting rather late. You should take Oliver home to rest. He's at a growing age and needs proper sleep."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. He had come specifically to look after her, and she was dismissing him already?

A sudden idea sparked in his eyes. "Oliver, come here." Nathaniel reached for the boy. "We're leaving now."

"No! I only want Mommy to hold me! I want to stay with Mommy tonight!" Oliver clung tightly to Isabella's neck.

Nathaniel's expression tightened. "Don't be difficult."

"But I just want to be with Mommy!" Oliver gripped even tighter.

Nathaniel's elegant features darkened immediately. "Come here this instant." He seized Oliver's arm. "What was our agreement before we left home today? Have you forgotten already?" His voice sharpened as he delivered a firm smack to the boy's rear.

Smack!

A loud slap echoed through the room, followed by Oliver's pained sobs.

"Sniff... sniff... It hurts... Stop hitting me...!"

Nathaniel's handsome face grew colder. "Stop crying immediately. Big boys don't cry." He raised his hand threateningly for another strike.

"Waa... Mommy! Help! Save me!" Oliver cried hoarsely, tears streaming down his face as he blinked desperately.

Isabella could no longer remain silent. She swiftly pulled Oliver away from Nathaniel, glaring at him angrily. "Mr. Blackwood, I don't mean to interfere, but this is no way to discipline your son! He's just a child! This kind of treatment could traumatize him!"

"He disobeyed me first," Nathaniel reasoned impassively.

"Waa... I didn't do anything wrong...!" Oliver whimpered again. "I just want to be with Mommy. I miss Mommy! I've never had the chance to sleep with Mommy... I don't want to sleep alone in the children's room... I want Mommy's hugs! I want to be with Mommy..."

His tears flowed freely down his cheeks like waterfalls.

Isabella's heart melted with compassion. "Sweetheart, don't cry, don't cry," she soothed gently. "You can stay here tonight. I'll protect you."

"Really?" Oliver stopped crying instantly, a radiant smile spreading across his face.

"My apologies for the inconvenience, and thank you for your understanding, Miss Montgomery." With those words, Nathaniel walked to the door and closed it firmly behind him.

???

What just happened?
###Chapter 40

“I permitted Christopher to remain. I never authorized your stay.”

Isabella’s tone was firm as she addressed Nathaniel.

He stepped closer, expression serious. “My apologies. Oliver’s condition is unpredictable. Nighttime seizures are a real concern. I can’t leave him unsupervised.”

“Mommy, please let Daddy stay. He cooks. He cleans. He’s useful!” Oliver’s voice was sweet, persuasive.

Isabella raised an eyebrow, skeptical. “Your father does housework?”

“Yes! Ask him yourself.” Oliver glanced toward Nathaniel.

Nathaniel paused briefly under her scrutinizing gaze, then nodded. “It’s true.”

“Fine. You can stay. Make dinner. Three dishes, one soup. Keep it simple. And healthy,” Isabella commanded. With no meal delivery scheduled, a personal chef wasn’t unwelcome.

He had offered, after all.

Nathaniel seemed momentarily taken aback by her specific instructions. Nevertheless, he removed his jacket, rolled up his sleeves, and carried the groceries to the kitchen. His physique was noticeable beneath his crisp shirt—toned and commanding. Isabella found her eyes drifting toward him, her pulse quickening unexpectedly.

Strange. She’d encountered countless attractive men. Why did Nathaniel affect her so strongly?

“Mommy, I’m tired. Will you read to me?” Oliver asked softly.

Isabella shook off her distraction. “Of course. Close your eyes.” She lifted him, carried him to the bedroom, and settled beside him.

Oliver curled against her, his head resting on her arm. Isabella began, her voice uncharacteristically gentle. “Once, there was a lone wolf…”

She didn’t recognize her own soothing tone. Her expression softened with affection. She expected a long story, but Oliver was asleep within moments. His breathing evened, his small hands stilled.

Asleep so quickly?

She lightly brushed his cheek. When he didn’t stir, she carefully slid her arm free. She tucked the blanket around him, adjusted the thermostat to a comfortable level, and quietly left the room.

In the kitchen, Nathaniel stood frowning at the array of ingredients.

“Need assistance?” A playful voice came from the doorway.

Nathaniel turned. Isabella leaned against the frame, arms crossed, an amused smirk on her lips.

He remained composed. “Simply deciding on the cooking method.”

She laughed lightly, stepping forward. She took his wrist, guiding him aside.

“Alright, out. Wait for me. Don’t wreck my kitchen.” Her eyes sparkled with teasing.

His inability to cook was no surprise. Why would a man of his stature know his way around a kitchen?

Isabella washed the vegetables, then began chopping spices with practiced ease.

A slight smile touched Nathaniel’s lips as he watched her focused movements. She handled the knife skillfully, one hand steadying the chili, the other slicing precisely.

Dressed in fitted black attire, her figure was striking. She moved with the confidence of a warrior, though she was merely preparing a meal.

Everything she did radiated boldness and self-assurance. Nathaniel observed, captivated. Soon, prawns turned vibrant red in the sizzling wok. She plated them and carried the dish out.

Passing him, she paused. “Why are you just standing there? Get the utensils.”

No one spoke to him so bluntly. Yet, from her, it felt natural. He retrieved cutlery and followed her.

Isabella sat at the sleek dining table. She picked up a prawn and ate with unpretentious relish. Her manner was unrestrained yet not uncouth.

Though unaccustomed to late meals, Nathaniel joined her, drawn by her evident enjoyment.

The food was excellent. She continually amazed him. After a while, he set down his fork.

“The situation with Harrison Winslow… How are you managing it?”

“A minor issue. It will resolve itself,” she replied casually, snapping a photo of her meal.

Assuming she was downplaying her stress, he approached differently. “I can assist.”

“Oh? How?”

He was direct. “Marry me.”

Marry him?

“I’ve already given my answer,” she stated calmly.

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed slightly, but he persisted. “Isabella, as my wife, no one would believe you’d disrupt Harrison Winslow’s life.”

The Winslow wealth was significant but confined to diamonds. The Blackwood empire spanned technology and medical research. Their influence dwarfed the Winslows.

Marriage to him would silence all rumors.

A smirk played on her lips. She reached out, lightly touching his chin.
###Chapter 41

Her slender finger lifted his chin with deliberate grace.

“Nathaniel,” she murmured, her voice a low challenge. “Do I strike you as the type to trade my body for solutions?”

His brow furrowed. Trading her body? Marriage to him was the ultimate fantasy for countless women. How could she frame it as some sordid transaction? Her fingertip felt cool against his skin, carrying a faint, intoxicating scent.

A slow smile touched his lips. “If Miss Montgomery insists on conducting business that way first,” he countered, “I wouldn’t object.” His large hand closed over hers, small and delicate in his grasp. A jolt, sharp and electric, shot through them both, freezing them in place.

Isabella recovered first, snatching her hand back. “In your dreams,” she scoffed, brushing off her fingers. “A body like mine is far beyond your means.” She turned from the table, her posture radiating unyielding pride as she walked away.

Nathaniel’s frown deepened, but he let the matter drop.

She retreated to Oliver’s room; the boy would be sleeping in her bed tonight.

Sleep, however, eluded her. Lying in the dark, she switched her phone to silent and opened Twitter. A torrent of criticism flooded her screen. Her response was swift and cutting.

[Is this truly the best you can manage? It’s not even worthy of being my garnish.]

She attached the photo of the vibrant, perfectly cooked prawns from earlier.

Her fans had been waiting. They expected her to be hiding, weeping in some corner. Instead, she was living her life, even cooking a luxurious meal. The audacity! The sheer nerve of the woman!

Her inner circle saw the post immediately.

Maxwell and his team rallied in the comments.

[Boss Montgomery’s courage is unmatched!]

[Fools should verify their facts before spewing nonsense.]

[Boss, I stand with you! Can I get priority on the next batch?]

Strange replies peppered the comments, but they were quickly buried under the avalanche of new messages every minute.

Sophia nearly hurled her phone across the room. She had been certain Isabella was drowning in shame. Yet here she was, bold and unbroken. That infuriating spirit remained intact. Unacceptable. She needed a plan to crush her completely, utterly.

Her phone rang. “Sophia! Incredible news!” Lillian’s excited voice burst through. “A confidential source confirms Diamond Prince arrived in Westchester today. He’s staying at The Ritz-Carlton. Presidential Suite, room 8801.”

“Are you certain?” Sophia demanded, skepticism warring with hope.

“One hundred percent. The source is impeccable. I verified it myself.”

“Perfect. Arrange everything. Tonight.”

If she could meet Diamond Prince tonight, convince him to pin everything on Isabella, claim it was all her seduction… then Isabella would be finished. Absolutely ruined.

The thought sent a thrill through her. She selected a new dress and rushed to The Ritz-Carlton.

At The Ritz-Carlton, Presidential Suite 8801…

A strikingly handsome man, every bit the prince, watched the evening news. His doorbell chimed.

A soft, feminine voice filtered through the door. “Good evening, Sir. Your room service has arrived.”
###Chapter 42

Isabella Montgomery lay sleeping in deep burgundy silk pajamas. Her porcelain skin glowed in the morning light. Every feature was exquisitely carved, like a slumbering goddess. The top buttons of her pajamas had come undone, revealing the elegant curve of her neck and a tantalizing glimpse of her décolletage.

Nathaniel Blackwood’s throat went dry. He forced himself to turn away, but his movement was clumsy. His shoulder bumped against the doorframe with a dull thud.

Thump. Thump.

Still asleep, Isabella instinctively grabbed a shark-shaped pillow and hurled it toward the noise.

“Shut up!”

Even unconscious, she was commanding. Yet this refusal to wake made her seem more approachable, more human.

Nathaniel’s lips curved into an involuntary smile. “If you don’t get up, I’m coming in.”

She didn’t stir, merely rolling over with a soft sigh. But the sound of footsteps approaching the bed snapped her awake. Her eyes flew open to find Nathaniel’s powerful frame looming over her.

“What do you think you’re doing, you pervert?” she yelled. The shout roused Oliver from his sleep. He peeked, saw the scene, and immediately feigned continued slumber.

Nathaniel had actually been leaning down to pick up Oliver. Seeing her misunderstanding, he decided to play along. He planted his hands on either side of her, caging her in. “What do you think I’m trying to do?”

“You’ve got a one-track mind this early? A CEO like you, reduced to a creep! I’ll teach you some manners!”

Isabella’s leg shot up, aiming a vicious kick straight for his groin.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. He blocked the strike with his thigh, pinning her legs down. A dangerous smirk played on his lips. “Isabella, are you sure you don’t want to reconsider your future happiness?”

“Reconsider this!” She cracked her knuckles, the sound ominous. “My fists don’t discriminate!”

He hadn’t expected such ferocity. A sharp, precise punch landed on his supporting arm. His balance broke, and he crashed forward onto the bed.

His solid weight landed fully on her. Their lips met in a sudden, shocking collision.

Both bodies froze.

A jolt of electricity shot through Isabella. Her mind went completely blank for several seconds. In all her years, no man—regardless of status or looks—had ever affected her like this. But Nathaniel was different. He made her heart race unpredictably.

Nathaniel recovered first. He pushed himself up slightly. “If I said that was an accident, would you believe me?”

“Believe you? Like hell I will!” She shoved him off and scrambled back, frantically wiping her mouth with the back of her hand like an enraged kitten.

Seeing her fury, Nathaniel quickly scooped Oliver into his arms. “I’ll visit another time,” he said, his voice tight. “Take care of yourself. Stay inside.” He adjusted Oliver and strode out of the room.

‘That shameless bastard! He’s not setting foot in here again!’ Isabella fumed inwardly.

Just outside the door, Nathaniel paused as if struck by a sudden thought.
###Chapter 44

“Isabella Montgomery, I have faith in you. Give me your word, and I will marry you this instant.” Harrison Winslow’s voice was firm, layered with conviction.

A surge of warmth flooded Isabella’s chest, making her heart constrict.

He believed in her?

Everyone else wanted her ruined, destroyed. Yet this infuriating man claimed he had faith in her. The memory of their kiss, mere minutes ago, flashed through her mind. Her pulse quickened, hammering wildly against her ribs.

Pathetic heart, stop racing. He’s only drawn to your face. He just wants to get you into bed. Get a grip. Don’t fall for a reckless, untamable man like him. Isabella mentally scolded herself, pressing a hand firmly over her heart.

Ding! Her phone screen illuminated.

She answered. It was Julian Hawthorne. “Because of the press conference Sophia Kensington is holding, Chanel has postponed today’s shoot. They’re waiting to see how the conference plays out before deciding whether to terminate your contract. Also, a new shipment of diamonds has arrived at Ohly. They’re exceptionally rare. You need to personally inspect them.”

“Right now? Are you certain?”

Even an international powerhouse like Chanel was delaying because of Sophia’s press event. The online mob would be vicious. Leaving the villa meant risking not coming back in one piece.

Julian reassured her. “Don’t worry. The Blackwood Corporation has issued a strict order. No media outlet is permitted to invade your privacy or harass you. Any that do will be shut down immediately. Just keep a low profile outside. These diamonds are critical. You must verify their authenticity and ensure they haven’t been tampered with.”

These were limited-edition stones. A single substitution would mean a massive financial loss.

“Fine. I’ll go,” Isabella relented. Having excessive wealth was occasionally a burden.

“Be cautious,” Julian warned before ending the call.

Isabella entered her room and searched for the most nondescript outfit she owned—something for complete anonymity. She chose a simple black athletic top and matching pants. She added a face mask and a cap. Only her eyes were visible.

Satisfied she was unrecognizable, she left the manor and hailed a taxi to Ohly.

Ohly was an exclusive jewelry boutique specializing solely in wedding rings. Their policy was strict: one ring per person, per lifetime, registered with a government ID. No exceptions, regardless of wealth or status. True to its "one and only" branding, Ohly maintained just one store in each of the nation's 34 major cities.

Upon entering, she immediately spotted four people inside. Of all the luck. It was Eleanor Kensington, Victoria Kensington, Sophia Kensington, and Alexander Whitmore, impeccably dressed in a suit.

Alexander was presenting a ring to Victoria. “Do you like this design, Victoria?” His voice was soft, like a gentle breeze.

The sound alone made Isabella nauseous. She turned to leave.

Victoria caught a glimpse of movement from the corner of her eye. One look was all it took. “You, by the door! Wait!” she called out.

Wait? Who did she think she was, issuing commands?

A cold smirk touched Isabella’s lips. She continued walking, her long strides carrying her away from the store.

Victoria’s initial suspicion grew. The woman’s physique was familiar, but the confident, dismissive gait confirmed it. “That looks like Isabella,” she announced. “Why is she running away after seeing us?”

“Isabella?” Sophia’s head snapped up. She hurried forward, blocking Isabella’s path.

“Isabella Montgomery! Are you deaf? Someone told you to stop!”
###Chapter 44

Isabella paused as Sophia stepped in front of her.
“Did you forget basic manners?” Sophia sneered.
Isabella’s gaze sharpened.
“Why is your mouth so filthy? Don’t you know a good dog doesn’t block the path?”

A dog? Did she just call Sophia a dog?

Sophia’s face flushed with rage.
“Isabella! You’re nothing but a homeless stray now. Everyone’s mocking you. How dare you act so high and mighty? If I were you, I’d find a hole to hide in! And you’re out shopping? Have you no shame?”

“Shame?” Isabella tilted her chin, her eyes unwavering.
“What’s truly shameful? Posing naked with a cucumber? Or trying to lock someone up and ending up paying three hundred fifty thousand instead?”

Isabella’s gaze shifted from Victoria to Sophia as she spoke.
Bystanders immediately looked at the two women differently.

Of course. Victoria’s nude photo scandal.
And Sophia had trapped Isabella, only to be extorted for a massive sum.
How absurd!

Sophia felt the judgmental stares.
Furious, she gritted her teeth.
“Isabella Montgomery! You’re a lying witch! You’ll pay for this today!”
She raised her hand, ready to strike.

Victoria’s face burned with humiliation.
She had hidden indoors for days waiting for the scandal to fade.
Now, just as she was showcasing her perfect relationship with Alexander to divert attention, Isabella had to bring it up again!

Victoria hated Isabella so much she wanted to rip her mouth apart.
But with Alexander present, she forced composure.
She stepped toward Sophia.
“Calm down, Sophia. Remember why we’re here? She’s just a jealous girl. We should be the bigger people.”

Sophia instantly recalled their purpose.
Her expression eased.
She lifted her chin arrogantly.
“Right! Today is a glorious day! I won’t waste another second on a homewrecker like you!”

“Do you even know what this store is? Ohly! It means ‘the one and only’! This is for engagement rings. One identity, one ring, one true love! They’d never sell to a mistress like you! Why are you even here? To stink up the place?”

“Oh, hilarious,” Isabella laughed mockingly.
She had zero interest in entertaining this.

Victoria had expected Isabella to be heartbroken seeing them together.
She thought it would be as satisfying as slapping her.
She never imagined Isabella would remain so indifferent.

Frustrated, Victoria put on a pitiful face.
She looked at Isabella with fake sympathy.
“Isabella, I know it’s my fault. Please don’t blame Alexander. Our love is real. He’s buying me an Ohly ring today. Please, just let us be. You and Alexander are over. You’re the Diamond Prince’s… plaything now. Please, just move on.”
Her voice was soft, pleading, and helpless.

The crowd began to believe Isabella was there to sabotage their ring shopping.
How could a homewrecker be so shameless as to ruin a happy couple?

Alexander stepped forward and embraced Victoria.
“Victoria, why beg her? This is Ohly. There are guards everywhere. If she touches you, we’ll call the police. Come, let’s pick your ring. Don’t let a shameless woman ruin our day.”

“Exactly, Victoria. Pick the most stunning diamond. Show her what real love looks like. That’s the price of being a homewrecker!” Sophia said proudly, chin held high.

Suddenly, a black vehicle screeched to a halt at the entrance.
The store manager exclaimed, “The new limited edition diamond collection is here! I heard this shipment includes a three-carat pigeon’s blood ruby surrounded by diamonds!”

“What? A pigeon’s blood ruby? Seriously? That’s impossible! I heard finding a colored diamond among thousands is rare, let alone a pigeon’s blood ruby!” Sophia gasped excitedly.

Victoria’s eyes sparkled.
“Most red rubies are purplish-red or dark purple. A pigeon’s blood ruby is the rarest gem in the world!”

“If you want it, Victoria, it’s yours,” Alexander said tenderly, glancing at Isabella to ensure she heard.

Sophia smirked at Isabella.
“Hear that? He’s buying the pigeon’s blood ruby for Victoria! An Ohly red ruby! The only one of its kind in the world!”
###Chapter 45

“Why are you still standing there? Get out!”

Eleanor Kensington’s eyes burned with pure hatred as she glared at Isabella Montgomery. “Leave this instant! The Montgomery family has no room for a disgraceful homewrecker like you!”

No matter how loudly they shouted, Isabella didn’t flinch. Her expression remained unreadable, as though she were watching a pitiful circus act.

Realizing Isabella wouldn’t budge, Sophia Kensington turned sharply to the sales manager. “What are you waiting for? Remove this shameless woman immediately! If she stays, we’re not buying a single thing from Ohly.”

The store’s general manager, Beatrice Worthington, had heard about the pigeon-blood ruby purchase. Her eyes lit up with greed. She stepped forward, scowling at Isabella. “Madam, you need to leave. Ohly is an exclusive establishment. We don’t just allow anyone inside.”

“Madam Worthington, store policy clearly states that every customer deserves—”

“Enough! She’s nothing but a despised outsider. Why show her respect? She clearly has none for herself, especially trying to ruin Miss Victoria’s special day. I can’t stand people like her.” She snapped her fingers. “Security! Escort her out immediately.”

Several guards moved to obey.

Just then, the driver from the vehicle outside stepped in. He was a tall American dressed in a sharp black suit that screamed professional agent. His presence commanded immediate attention.

The crowd stared, mesmerized. Even a delivery guard was this strikingly handsome?

Victoria Kensington straightened her posture, feeling a surge of superiority. “Since the ring has arrived, bring it to me,” she said, her voice dripping with false elegance.

The man didn’t even glance her way. He walked straight past her, a white box held securely in his hands.

Victoria’s excitement grew with each of his steps. This rare gem was about to be hers, right in front of Isabella! No matter how much Isabella pretended not to care, she had to be seething inside.

But then the man walked right past her without stopping.

Victoria’s eyes widened in shock. What was happening?

He stopped directly in front of Isabella. “Boss Montgomery, please inspect and sign for this delivery.”

Silence.

Everyone froze in disbelief.

What did he just say? Boss Montgomery? He was asking her to sign?

As the onlookers stood stunned, Isabella calmly opened the box. Inside lay nine exquisite diamond rings. The centerpiece was a stunning 3-carat heart-shaped pigeon-blood ruby, deep red like true passion and genuine love.

“Boss Montgomery, if everything meets your approval, please sign here,” the man said professionally, handing her an invoice.

Isabella glanced over the rings, took the pen, and signed her name with swift precision.

“Thank you, Boss Montgomery. It appears there’s some trouble here. Would you like assistance?” The man’s gaze swept coldly over the crowd.

Isabella handed the pen back. “Not necessary. You may go.”

“Understood.” He left, followed by the guards.

No one moved or spoke for a long moment. He had asked for Isabella’s signature? And with such deference?

Could it really be…?
###Chapter 46

Alexander stared in stunned silence as the truth struck him. “Isabella…you own Ohly?”

“Correct,” she answered with crisp finality.

Isabella removed her wide-brimmed hat. Dark waves tumbled down her shoulders. She shook her hair back with a careless flick. “Is there an issue?”

Jaws dropped throughout the boutique. Disbelief painted every face.

Isabella Montgomery owned Ohly? She was the legendary founder?

No wonder she had watched their petty insults with such cool amusement. No wonder their threats left her utterly unfazed. They had mocked her for not affording a ring…while standing in her own store. The irony was crushing.

Confusion and shock warred on every feature. The Kensington women looked utterly defeated. The orphan they despised, the charity case they pitied, was their superior in every way. It was a devastating blow.

Victoria’s fists clenched. Bitter envy coiled tight around her heart.

Isabella observed the range of humiliated expressions. A cold smile touched her lips. “Do you still wish to purchase the ring?”

Purchase it? That meant handing their money directly to Isabella.

Victoria felt like she’d swallowed something vile. The humiliation was a physical ache.

Eleanor was reeling. The girl she considered worthless was the mastermind behind her favorite brand. The injustice was unbearable.

“Never!” Eleanor spat, her voice trembling with rage. “If we’d known this was your pitiful shop, we would never have entered! What do you have to be proud of? You’re just a leech! Using Harrison Winslow’s diamonds. Have you no shame?”

Sophia’s face flushed a mottled red. “Isabella, I command you! Return this store to Prince Harrison and Princess Arabella immediately! You have no right to what isn’t yours!”

Isabella let out a derisive laugh. “And who are you to command me? Why would I ever listen to you? Furthermore, what proof do you have these diamonds aren’t mine?”

“Yours?” Sophia sneered, her contempt dripping. “A penniless orphan? How did you get them? By selling yourself to the Diamond Prince? By wrecking his marriage for money?”

Eleanor’s fury boiled over. “Isabella, remember your place! I am your adoptive mother! You will obey me! Never forget I saved your wretched life!”

Isabella ignored their screeching. She moved deeper into the store, the velvet box still in her hand. She opened it, placing the rings on the display counter. The three-carat ruby glowed with a fierce, inner fire. It captured the light, scattering bloody sparks across the room.

The sight of such treasures belonging to Isabella was too much for Sophia. Jealousy overrode all sense. She lunged forward, grabbing at Isabella’s arm. “Are you deaf, you ungrateful brat? These aren’t yours! You earned them on your back! If you have any dignity left, you’ll return them to Prince Harrison!”

“Must you buzz like an irritating gnat?” Isabella’s voice was ice. “If you’re not a paying customer, get out.”

Sophia’s face twisted into an ugly mask. “You’ve asked for this! I’ll teach you some respect!” One hand yanked viciously at Isabella’s hair. The other swung high, aiming a sharp slap at her face.

“A lesson?” Isabella’s lips curved into a dangerous smirk. “Let me demonstrate how it’s done.”

She moved with blinding speed. Her hand shot up, catching Sophia’s wrist in a vice-like grip. She twisted, hard.

A sickening crack echoed in the stunned silence.

Sophia’s arm hung limp and useless at her side. Dislocated. Completely powerless.
###Chapter 47

“Ahhh!” Sophia screamed, her face turning ghostly white from the sharp pain.

Eleanor immediately pulled Sophia behind her, her expression darkening. “Isabella, that’s enough! How dare you strike your own cousin? Have you no shame?”

“Shame?” Isabella’s voice was icy. “Should I be ashamed for listening to your nonsense?”

“She is your family!” Eleanor shrieked. “Even if she criticizes you, so what? You’re nothing but an adopted daughter! Your very existence is owed to the Montgomery family. With all the disgrace you’ve brought upon us, you deserve every bit of scorn!”

A cold, mocking glint flashed in Isabella’s eyes.

So she deserved to be scorned to death? They would soon see who would truly fall first.

Victoria seized the moment to play the peacemaker. “Mother, Sister, please don’t fight,” she pleaded softly. “Let’s talk this through. Isabella claims she isn’t the other woman and that this boutique is hers. What if she’s telling the truth? Maybe she was forced into this situation?”

“Forced? Don’t make me laugh! She’s just vain and greedy! If I hadn’t taken her in all those years ago, she would have died on the streets! Instead of being grateful, she repays us with this humiliation!” Eleanor’s voice grew louder, her eyes burning with fury.

“You’ve disgraced the Montgomery name! If you have any respect left for your foster mother, you will go to Senior Montgomery and tell him you’re leaving the family voluntarily! Spare us all from your shame!”

“Aunt Eleanor is right!” Sophia chimed in, her voice trembling with rage. “I’ll expose you to the world! Your reputation will be ruined! You should disappear now before you tarnish the Montgomery legacy forever!”

“Expose me?” Isabella let out a cold, dismissive laugh. “Go ahead. Be my guest.” Her tone was unyielding, filled with defiant confidence.

Victoria hated this version of Isabella—proud, stubborn, and utterly uncontrollable. How could a mere mistress act so arrogantly?

Just then, Victoria noticed paparazzi lurking outside the boutique, their cameras aimed discreetly through the window. An idea sparked in her mind. She stepped forward and gently grasped Isabella’s arm.

“Sister, Mother and Sophia only want what’s best for you. If you made a mistake, just apologize. Or if you’re in trouble, tell us. We’ll forgive you.”

“Forgive me?” Isabella’s eyes narrowed. “You don’t have the right to forgive anyone. Get your hands off me!” She jerked her arm away forcefully.

“Ah!” Victoria stumbled backward, crashing into a glass display counter.

The counter shattered instantly, scattering shards of glass across the floor. Victoria fell hard, crying out as a piece of glass sliced deep into her palm.

“Victoria!” Two voices shouted in unison—Eleanor and Alexander.

Alexander rushed to her side, his face pale with worry. “Victoria, you’re bleeding!” he exclaimed, helping her up.

“I’m fine, really,” Victoria whispered, clutching his sleeve. “It was an accident. Isabella didn’t mean to push me. Please don’t blame her.”

Alexander’s handsome features twisted into a mask of cold anger. He turned his glare toward Isabella. “Isabella! Your sister was trying to help you! How could you be so cruel? You’re nothing but a heartless viper!”

“You wretched girl!” Eleanor snarled, her eyes burning with hatred. “How dare you hurt my daughter? Don’t you know she needs her hands to play the piano? Who do you think you are, laying a finger on Victoria?”
###Chapter 48

Isabella had long grown accustomed to Eleanor's venomous glare over the years. This woman was completely bewitched by Victoria. Even if she discovered Victoria was adopted, she would still take her side.

Speaking to them felt utterly exhausting. Isabella issued a cold command. "Security. Escort them out immediately."

The guards originally meant to remove Isabella now approached Sophia and her group instead.

Sophia cradled her dislocated arm, the white-hot pain still searing. She snarled through clenched teeth. "Don't you dare act so superior, Isabella! I refuse to spend another second in this pathetic store. It's beneath me! Just you wait. This afternoon, I'll expose your true hideous face to the world. Your reputation will be utterly destroyed!"

Sophia refused to let the guards touch her. She struggled to walk out on her own. Alexander and Julian supported Victoria. They shot Isabella looks of pure, unadulterated hatred. Victoria held herself like a regal white swan, the cherished princess. Though she secretly threw a filthy glance at Isabella.

So what if she owned a diamond store? Isabella still lost to her! Alexander was hers. Eleanor was hers. Even the Montgomery family was hers!

Suddenly... "Wait." Isabella's clear voice cut through the tension.

Alexander and the others instinctively halted, turning to look at her. They were visibly startled.

"Please settle the bill for the shattered gold-plated display case. The total is three hundred thousand dollars."

Isabella casually took a card machine, shaking it before them nonchalantly.

Sophia, Eleanor, Alexander, and Victoria were completely dumbfounded.

Their eyes burned crimson with rage. Eleanor, harboring the deepest grudge, snapped. "How utterly shameless, Isabella! After all these years leaching off the Montgomery family's resources, you have the audacity to demand money? And three hundred thousand at that?!"

"Fine. Here's your three hundred thousand! But tonight, you will return to the Montgomery estate and repay every cent you've ever used!"

Eleanor produced a card and flung it at Isabella.

Isabella picked up the card and threw it directly back at Eleanor. "Unfortunately, the display case was broken by Victoria. I will only accept payment from her."

Victoria's face flushed red with fury. Her hand was already injured. Now she had to pay Isabella 300,000? Isabella wasn't giving her a moment's respite!

She desperately wanted to kill Isabella on the spot. But she quickly composed herself, remembering the paparazzi outside and her plans. She swallowed her rage, adopting a soothing tone.

"Mother, Sister is right," she murmured. "I broke it, so I should pay for it." She pulled out a card, though her eyes still blazed with anger. She would make Isabella pay dearly for this arrogance and this ridiculous 300,000 'damage'.

After swiping the card, Isabella tossed it back to her. "You may leave now."

The four of them stormed out of the store, fumes practically visible above their heads.

As they exited, Sophia yelled back. "Just you wait, Isabella! Tune in to the press conference at three o'clock today. I want to see you beg for mercy!"

Isabella's lips curved into a smirk. Cry? Oh, someone would definitely be crying.

She then scanned the store. "Why is everyone just standing around? Clean this place up. Now."

"Yes, Miss Montgomery," the staff replied in unison, immediately starting the cleanup.

Isabella was shameless, but they were still employees. They needed these jobs.

The general manager feigned innocence, pretending to join the cleanup effort.

"You're fired!" Isabella snapped.

In less than an hour, Twitter was flooded with trending hashtags.

#IsabellaMontgomery-owner#Isabella-attacks-Victoria#Isabella-pushes-Victoria#Isabella-abuses-foster-mother

These were the hottest discussion topics. It was blatantly obvious they were orchestrated to attack Isabella. Netizens happily joined the fray, eager for the drama.

[OMG! She's been fully exposed! How can she still be so arrogant?!]

[If it weren't for Eleanor Kensington, she would have died years ago! How dare she treat her mother like that?]
###Chapter 49

Isabella had long grown accustomed to Eleanor's venomous stares over the years. This woman was completely devoted to Victoria. Even knowing Victoria was adopted wouldn't change her allegiance.

Dealing with them felt utterly exhausting. Isabella issued a cold command. "Security. Escort them out immediately."

The guards originally meant to remove Isabella now approached Sophia and her group instead.

Sophia cradled her dislocated arm, pain radiating through her. She snarled through clenched teeth. "Don't act so superior, Isabella! I wouldn't waste another second in this pathetic store. It's beneath me! Just wait. This afternoon, everyone will witness your true hideous nature. Your reputation will be completely destroyed!"

Sophia refused to let the guards touch her. She stumbled out on her own. Alexander and Julian supported Victoria. They shot Isabella looks of pure, unadulterated hatred. Victoria maintained her graceful, swan-like composure. The cherished princess. Though she secretly threw Isabella a filthy glare.

So what if she owned a diamond store? Isabella still lost to her! Alexander belonged to her. Eleanor belonged to her. Even the Montgomery family was hers!

Suddenly... "Wait." Isabella's clear voice cut through the air.

Alexander and the others instinctively halted. They turned to look at her, clearly startled.

"Please settle the bill for the shattered gold-plated display case. That will be three hundred thousand dollars total."

Isabella casually waved a card reader before them.

Sophia, Eleanor, Alexander, and Victoria were utterly dumbfounded.

Their eyes burned crimson with rage. Eleanor, harboring the deepest resentment, snapped first. "How utterly shameless, Isabella! After all these years living off the Montgomery family's wealth! And you dare demand three hundred thousand?!"

"Fine! Here's your three hundred thousand! But tonight, you will return to the Montgomery estate. You will repay every single penny you've ever cost us!"

Eleanor pulled out a card and flung it at Isabella.

Isabella picked it up and tossed it right back. "Unfortunately, Victoria broke the display. I'll only accept payment from her."

Victoria's face flushed scarlet with fury. Her hand was already injured. Now she had to pay Isabella 300,000? Isabella wasn't giving her a moment's peace!

She desperately wanted to kill Isabella on the spot. But she quickly composed herself. Paparazzi waited outside. Her plans were in motion. She swallowed her rage, adopting a soothing tone.

"Mother, Sister is right," she murmured. "I broke it. I should pay for it." She produced a card, though her eyes still blazed with anger. She would make Isabella pay for this arrogance. And for this ludicrous 300,000 'damage'.

After swiping the card, Isabella tossed it back. "You may leave now."

The four of them stormed out, smoke practically billowing from their heads.

As they exited, Sophia yelled back. "Just you wait, Isabella! Tune in to the press conference at three today! I want to see you beg for mercy!"

Isabella's lips curved into a smile. Beg for mercy? Oh, someone would be begging, alright.

She scanned the store. "Why is everyone standing around? Clean this mess up."

"Yes," the staff chorused, quickly starting the cleanup.

Isabella was shameless. But they were still employees. They needed their jobs.

The general manager pretended to help clean, feigning innocence.

"You're fired!" Isabella snapped.

In under an hour, Twitter flooded with trending hashtags.

#Ohly-owner-IsabellaMontgomery
#Isabella-attacked-Victoria
#Isabella-pushed-Victoria
#Isabella-insulted-foster-mother

These topics dominated the hottest discussions. Clearly orchestrated to criticize Isabella. Netizens happily joined the frenzy for entertainment.

[OMG! She's been exposed! How is she still so arrogant?!]

[Without Eleanor Young, she'd be dead long ago! How dare she treat her mother like that!]
###Chapter 50

[Oh god, my princess is injured! That must have been excruciating.]

[Isabella looks completely drained! Sophia must have attacked her out of pure spite for being exposed! How vile!]

[Counting down to the press conference! Let’s see how Isabella tries to talk her way out once everything’s revealed.]

Twitter flooded with reactions like these while reporters rushed to get statements from Victoria and Sophia.

“I won’t back down, no matter how violently Isabella retaliates,” Sophia announced to the cameras, her voice trembling with fake bravery. “The press conference will proceed. The world will know the truth.”

Nearby, Victoria winced dramatically as she nursed a bandaged wrist. “I don’t want to say much… It’s alright if she takes her anger out on me. I only wish to guide her back to the right path. Please, everyone, help me persuade her to stop this?” Her performance, complete with trembling lips and glossy eyes, swayed the public effortlessly.

The audience buzzed with anticipation, eager for the conference to start. They couldn’t wait to see Isabella publicly shamed and expelled from the modeling world for good.

Before long, the clock struck three.

The lobby of The Ritz-Carlton swarmed with paparazzi and influencers broadcasting live, their viewers hooked and waiting.

Amid the chaos, Sophia ascended the platform. She wore a striking crimson satin gown, radiating false confidence.

“Thank you all for coming on such short notice,” she began, gripping the microphone. “I know you’re all eager for answers, so I’ll cut straight to it.”

“Many of you may feel a single photo isn’t enough to prove Isabella is the other woman. That’s why I’ve arranged for a very special guest to join us today—Diamond Prince Harrison Winslow himself. He will clarify everything personally.” She gestured grandly toward the backstage area.

A team of broad-shouldered bodyguards cleared a path as Harrison emerged. Dressed in a tailored black suit adorned with obsidian diamond buttons, he moved with an air of untouchable elegance. His piercing blue eyes scanned the room, silencing the crowd momentarily.

The room erupted.

“It’s really him! Harrison Winslow! The CEO of Prestige Diamonds! He actually showed up!”

“Sophia pulled off a miracle! He hasn’t spoken a word since the scandal broke!”

“Isabella is finished. There’s no way she recovers from this.”

“Your Highness, please explain what happened! Why betray Princess Arabella? Weren’t you devoted to her?”

Reporters shoved microphones toward him while online comment sections exploded.

[Harrison is unreal. How could he cheat?]

[That home-wrecker Isabella deserves everything coming to her.]

The world watched, equal parts mesmerized and outraged, all directed at Isabella.

Meanwhile, the woman at the center of the storm lounged on her velvet sofa, carefully applying a thermal-reactive nail polish that shifted from bright red to deep blood crimson at the tips.

Julian Hawthorne eyed the television nervously. “It’s getting intense. You’re really not watching?”

“Why would I? This color is far more interesting,” Isabella replied without looking up, blowing gently on her nails.

He sighed. It wasn’t like the woman being torn apart online was actually her. Why was he so stressed?

Back at the hotel, the conference hit its peak.

Sophia handed the microphone to Harrison, beaming. “Your Highness, the truth, please. We’re all here for justice.”

Harrison took the mic, his expression unreadable. “This situation is… complicated. Instead of explaining, I’d like to show you all something.” He signaled toward the AV team.

Sophia’s heart raced with triumph. This was their agreement—he would reveal receipts of Isabella’s lavish spending, intimate photos, everything to paint her as a greedy, status-obsessed seductress. Once the evidence dropped, Isabella’s reputation would never recover.
###Chapter 51

At the Blackwood Estate...

Nathaniel Blackwood stood rigid before the massive screen. His knuckles were white. Oliver Blackwood clutched a modified remote. A high-frequency signal disruptor was synced to his drone. Sebastian Blackwood held a printed list. Every media outlet and influencer at the conference was named.

"Stand by," Nathaniel's voice was a low growl.

Oliver's thumb hovered over the kill switch. One press would blackout all signals at The Ritz-Carlton. The live stream would die instantly. No one would slander Isabella.

Sebastian's grip tightened on the paper. His jaw was set. The Blackwood Corporation could silence every company on this list. They would bury any story that tried to hurt her.

Their eyes were locked on the broadcast. They didn't blink.

But then...

The screen didn't show financial records. It showed security footage. From the presidential suite of The Grand Monarch.

Prince Harrison Winslow stood at the door. His expression was disgusted. "You're not a waitress!" he snapped.

Sophia Kensington stood before him. She wore a scandalously tight red dress. "Don't be alarmed, Your Highness. I'm Isabella Montgomery's cousin. I'm here to make a deal."

She smiled. It was a venomous thing. "I'm holding a press conference tomorrow. I want you to attend. Tell them Isabella seduced you while you were drunk. Say she's been blackmailing you ever since."

"Get out," Harrison snarled.

Sophia didn't move. She lowered her voice. "Help me ruin her," she purred. "And I'll do anything you want." Her hands went to the neckline of her dress. She tugged it down. Her intent was blatant.

Harrison's eyes darkened. "Anything?" he asked, his tone shifting.

"Anything," she promised. She stepped closer. She pressed herself against his arm. The movement was slow. Deliberate.

A collective gasp echoed through the conference hall.

The audience was stunned. Cameras flashed wildly. They captured the screen. They captured Sophia's pale, horrified face.

"This is the real story!" someone shouted. "She set this all up!"

"Justice? This is her idea of justice? She's a snake!"

"How could she do this to her own cousin?"

The crowd turned on her. Their disgust was a physical force.

Sophia staggered back. Her mind raced. This wasn't the plan. This was supposed to be Isabella's downfall. Not hers. Her head snapped toward Harrison. Her eyes burned with betrayal.

"You!" she shrieked. "You set me up! Why?"

Harrison looked at her with cold contempt. "Set you up? You came to my room. You offered yourself. You asked me to lie. I don't participate in such schemes."

He turned to the cameras. His voice was clear and firm. "I have never been unfaithful to my wife. There is nothing between Isabella Montgomery and me. These rumors were fabricated by Sophia Kensington. She manipulated you all. She used you to destroy an innocent woman."

The room erupted. The journalists felt used. Their outrage was immediate.

"She played us! We were her pawns!"

"That wholesome image was a complete lie! She's pure evil!"
###Chapter 52

“Did she fake this picture too? Is this another lie?”

Some reporters glared at Sophia while others fired rapid questions.

Hearing this, Sophia snapped out of her daze and shouted, “I didn’t alter that photo! It’s real! I went to see Harrison to help him manage the crisis!”

“Something must be going on between Harrison and Isabella. Otherwise, why would he help her? He even gave her a massive diamond ring!”

Since her reputation was already destroyed, Sophia wanted to drag Isabella down with her.

Just as she hoped, the paparazzi immediately turned their attention to Harrison.

“Prince Winslow, what is your relationship with Isabella? Why did you give her a diamond ring?”

“How did you meet Isabella? Are you here today to defend her?”

Harrison remained completely calm and collected despite the barrage of questions.

“Yes,” he stated coolly, “I am here to defend Isabella, and I will tell you why! Isabella is my boss!”

What? Isabella?! His boss?! Was he joking?

Seeing everyone’s stunned expressions, he repeated clearly, “Isabella holds sixty percent of the shares in the Winslow Diamond Empire. She is the most powerful director on the board.”

Wow!

So Isabella was Harrison’s boss all along? She was the director of the Winslow Diamond Empire?!

How was that possible?

[Prince Winslow, are you mistaken? Isabella is just an adopted daughter. How could she be that wealthy?]

[The Winslow Diamond Empire has been in your family for generations. Over a hundred years, right? How could the director be an outsider?]

[You’re just making this up to protect Isabella!]

Harrison was bombarded with countless questions on the live streams. No one believed what he had just said. The comments flooded in so fast that most of the influencers’ phones crashed.

Even the Blackwoods were utterly shocked. They were prepared to intervene, but the event had taken a completely unexpected turn.

First, Sophia was publicly shamed by the video footage. Now, Harrison claimed Isabella was his boss?

Warily, Sebastian glanced at Nathaniel. “Brother, how much of that do you think is true?”

Nathaniel stared at the screen, recalling Isabella’s proud, defiant face. After a moment, he replied with certainty, “One hundred percent.”

As expected, facing the doubts and questions, Harrison declared firmly, “I, Prince Harrison Winslow, have never lied in my life. In fact, I have proof. Here is a photo from five years ago, taken at the dinner celebrating Isabella’s purchase of shares in the Winslow Diamond Empire.”

At Harrison’s signal, a series of photos appeared on the screen: the Winslow Diamond Empire’s share distribution chart, a photo of Isabella in a board meeting, and the full image of Harrison presenting the diamond ring to Isabella.

This was the complete, unedited version of the photo Sophia had found earlier. In this image, Harrison stood at the front, handing a pigeon egg-sized diamond ring to Isabella. Princess Arabella stood behind him, holding the share certificate. They were actually lined up to present the diamond and certificate to Isabella, but the photo Sophia found only captured a partial view.

The crowd was so shocked they forgot to take pictures, staring blankly at the screen.

It was true. Isabella was the director of the Winslow Diamond Empire. She was Diamond Prince Harrison’s boss!

Prince Harrison, the handsome and wealthy prince, was merely Isabella’s employee!

This was unbelievable! What shocking news!

Only one influencer’s phone was still streaming, but after the last photo was shown, her phone crashed like all the others…
###Chapter 53

The entire audience sat in stunned silence.

No one moved. No one breathed.

Isabella Montgomery watched the scene unfold with cold detachment.

Sophia Kensington stumbled backward, her face pale with shock.

How was this possible?

Isabella was supposed to be nothing but an adopted orphan! How could she be the director of the Gray Diamond Empire?!

It made no sense!

Sophia lunged toward Harrison Winslow in a blind rage. She grabbed his arm desperately. "I don't believe you! There's no way she's your boss! This has to be some kind of trick! Even if she didn't sleep with you, she must have seduced your father! Is that it? Is she your stepmother now? Did your father give her all his shares?"

"Enough!" Harrison shoved her away violently, his blue eyes flashing with icy contempt. "First you slander me, now you dare insult my elderly father? You want to know how Isabella became my director? I'll tell you exactly how—it's all because of you!"

He stepped closer, his voice cutting through the silent room. "Five years ago, when Isabella was exiled to Africa, you paid her maid to lead her to a cliff and push her off. But instead of dying, she discovered something incredible at the bottom—a massive diamond mine containing over three billion tons of diamonds!"

"The owner was a drunkard who had no idea what his land was worth. Isabella managed to gather five hundred thousand dollars and bought the entire mine from him. Do I need to explain what happened after that?"

What followed was a bidding war unlike any other. Everyone wanted the mine Isabella now owned. Offers poured in, but she refused them all. Meanwhile, the Gray Diamond Empire faced total collapse. Their own mines were depleted after a century of operation. Bankruptcy loomed. They couldn't even compete for the new mine—they had nothing left.

Then Isabella appeared like a miracle. She offered to save the Empire on one condition: sixty percent of the company's shares.

Faced with certain ruin or keeping forty percent, the Empire chose survival. The transfer papers were signed immediately.

Sophia didn't hear any of this. Harrison's first words echoed in her mind like a curse.

'It's all because of you...'

'All because of you...'

'All because of you...'

The words hammered against her skull. Rage, hatred, and bitter jealousy threatened to split her head open.

She had been the one to send Isabella to that cliff. She had unknowingly handed Isabella everything! This was all her own doing!

A scream caught in her throat.

Penelope Sinclair saw her daughter swaying on stage and rushed forward with security. They hurried Sophia away before she completely collapsed.

The press conference ended abruptly.

At the Blackwood Estate, Nathaniel Blackwood still watched the screen intently. "What's Isabella's current net worth?" he asked calmly.

Sebastian Blackwood pulled up a financial program, his fingers flying across the keyboard. "At least thirty billion dollars," he announced moments later.

A slight smile touched Nathaniel's lips. Impressive.

Thirty billion would easily place her on Forbes' Rich List. This woman never ceased to amaze him.

Within an hour, Twitter exploded with trending topics:

#Boss-Isabella

#Sophia-seduced-DiamondPrince

#Sophia-tried-to-kill-Isabella

#Isabella-owns-the-GrayDiamondEmpire

#Youtube-crashed

Isabella Montgomery had transformed from a nobody into the most searched diamond magnate—the woman who owned a mine with three billion tons of diamonds.
###Chapter 54

Countless tweets flooded the platform.

[I was completely wrong about you. I sincerely apologize!]

(Isabella Montgomery, are you by any chance in need of a sister? I volunteer!)

(I could be your stepmother, just saying.)

[Forget being family. I'll carry your bags anywhere. No salary needed. Just throw me a diamond you don’t want.]

Isabella lounged lazily on her sofa, utterly unbothered. She scanned the financial section of the newspaper. A large bottle of Coke sat on the coffee table before her, a long straw reaching her lips.

“Your Twitter is blowing up. They’re all begging for a response,” Julian Hawthorne noted. “Thinking of posting anything?”

“Twitter? Right, that.” Isabella took a long sip. She picked up her phone and typed a quick tweet.

Curious, Julian checked her profile. His expression instantly froze. A single line of text sat starkly on her page: –(Alexander Whitmore, have you eaten sh*t yet?)

‘Have you eaten sh*t yet...’

Instead of capitalizing on the moment to build goodwill, she posted...this?! Her obsession with making Alexander eat sh*t was truly something else. But this was Isabella. Expecting anything conventional was a mistake.

Julian swiftly changed the subject. “William Kensington called earlier. He wants you to come home. Your thoughts?”

“Why would I miss such entertaining drama?” A smirk played on Isabella’s lips.

Over at Montgomery Manor, the family was assembled in the grand living room.

Senior William Kensington slammed his hands on the ornate table. “Sophia Kensington! How could you?!”

“You are a Kensington! Have you no shame, throwing yourself at Diamond Prince Harrison Winslow? You’ve disgraced this entire family! All of Westchester is laughing at us!”

“Grandfather, this is Isabella’s fault! She set me up! If she owns the Gray Diamond Empire, why keep it a secret? Why let me host that press conference?!” Sophia stood her ground, defiance in her eyes.

“How dare you!” William’s fury erupted. He grabbed a teacup and hurled it directly at her head. “Did you ask her before publishing that photo? You posted it! You tried to seduce the Prince and pinned it on her! You deserve every bit of this humiliation! She’d be justified if she wanted you dead!”

“Ah!” Sophia cried out. The shattered porcelain had cut her forehead. Blood trickled down.

She pressed a hand to the wound, her anger boiling over. “Grandfather, have you lost your mind? Isabella is adopted! I am your real granddaughter! Why do you always take her side?!”

“Take her side? You feel no remorse?!” William roared, turning to the butler. “Reginald! Prepare the family punishment.”

The Kensington family punishment was thirty lashes. The whip was barbed. It tore the skin, leaving permanent scars.

Penelope Sinclair—Sophia’s mother—rushed forward, shielding her daughter. “Father, please! She’s young and foolish! I will discipline her! Victoria, say something! Your grandfather listens to you. Do you want to see your cousin whipped?”

Victoria Kensington cherished her kind image, but this was serious. She wanted no part of it.

Yet Penelope had dragged her in.

She had no choice but to step forward. “Sophia, just apologize to Grandfather. You were in the wrong this time.”

“I was wrong? All of you blame me! But do you see how vicious Isabella is? We saw her today! We told her about the press conference! She said nothing! She didn’t stop us! She planned this to destroy me!”

“And after all these years we raised her! She hid the diamond mine from us! She didn’t give a single penny to this family! She kept everything for herself!”

“Why defend someone so heartless and ungrateful? She’s just an adopted stray! She doesn’t deserve your sympathy!” Sophia raged, her voice shaking.

The others in the room frowned slightly. But the diamond mine profits concerned them far more than the scandal.

Isabella was adopted by the Kensingtons. Surely the diamond mine rightfully belonged to the family?
###Chapter 55

Isabella Montgomery stood silently, her gentle nature usually hidden beneath a calm exterior. But when it came to Sophia Kensington, her protective instincts surged fiercely.

She stepped forward, her voice soft yet unwavering. "Father, I understand Sophia's actions were unacceptable. But she wasn't entirely wrong in her feelings. We've cared for Isabella all these years. Shouldn't there be some acknowledgment? That diamond mine she discovered... Even if she chooses not to share it, shouldn't she have at least informed us?"

"Precisely," Gregory Kensington declared, his voice booming across the room. The second son of the Kensington family never missed an opportunity to express his opinions. "It's like forgetting the hands that fed you. Not only has she forgotten, but she's also biting those very hands!"

The atmosphere grew thick with condemnation toward Isabella.

Victoria Kensington saw her chance to play the compassionate mediator. She moved gracefully toward William Kensington, the family patriarch. "This isn't entirely fair," she interjected softly. "We can't blame Isabella for her secrecy. She never felt connected to us. But she would have told Grandfather."

She poured tea into William's cup with practiced elegance. "Grandfather always showed her such kindness. She respected him deeply. It doesn't make sense that she would keep this from him." Victoria's voice took on a coaxing tone. "Grandfather, isn't that true? Please tell them Isabella confided in you."

William's expression tightened. Speak for Isabella? Say what?

This was a massive discovery, yet she had never mentioned it. All these years, he had worried about her solitary life in Africa. He had instructed Reginald Thornton to monitor her wellbeing. He reserved those fifteen percent shares for her, protecting her interests against family pressure.

And Isabella...

Victoria noticed his hesitation. A flicker of triumph crossed her eyes, quickly masked by feigned concern. "Grandfather? Don't tell me she kept you in the dark as well?"

Before William could respond, Eleanor Kensington cut in sharply. "The audacity! Everyone knows how well you treated her. How could she hide something so important from you? This is unbelievable!"

"She's spread her wings now," Gregory sneered. "She wants to fly far away from us. Why would she share her wealth or her diamond mine?"

Emboldened by the family's outrage, Sophia looked at William with wounded eyes. "Grandfather, she doesn't value you. Why do you still defend her?"

"I may be impulsive, but I am your true granddaughter. Your blood flows in my veins. I've always used my allowance to buy you gifts."

"And Isabella? What has she ever done for you? Will you really punish me for someone who doesn't consider you family?"

William's mind drifted to memories of Sophia. Arrogant, yes, but she always showed him respect. Isabella, on the other hand...

In his advanced years, material wealth meant little. He craved genuine affection from his grandchildren. For five years, Isabella had sent no word. He had always treated his adopted granddaughter as his own. But did she ever see him as her grandfather?

"Who claims I don't consider Grandfather family?"

A clear, resonant voice echoed from the doorway. All heads turned. Isabella Montgomery stood there, her posture regal. She wore a crimson high-waisted dress that accentuated her slender figure and endless legs. She was, as always, breathtakingly stunning.

Jealousy coiled in Victoria's gut. Why did Isabella have to be so flawlessly beautiful? Victoria would give anything to shatter that perfect face and break those elegant legs.

She suppressed her venom and approached Isabella with false warmth. "Isabella, you've arrived just in time. Please, explain everything to Grandfather. I'm sure you had your reasons for cutting contact. I believe you had reasons for not telling him about the diamond mine. Grandfather always favored you. If you explain, he will understand."

Her words were crafted to seem supportive, but they only fueled the family's anger. Even William looked at Isabella with profound disappointment and hurt.

Isabella positioned herself at the room's center, facing their accusatory glares. Her sharp gaze swept over the assembly before settling on Victoria and Sophia. "Are you both certain I made no contact with Grandfather these past five years?" Her voice was laced with icy mockery.

Her intense stare made Sophia shift uncomfortably. A flash of guilt appeared in Sophia's eyes before she defiantly lifted her chin. "Are we mistaken? Grandfather knows the truth! Tell them, Grandfather! Did Isabella ever call? Did she ever send a gift? You worried constantly. You sent her money regularly. And she shows nothing but ingratitude!"

As anticipated, William's eyes clouded with deeper disappointment. His disillusionment with Isabella was now painfully visible.
###Chapter 56

Victoria watched with satisfaction as her grandfather’s expression darkened.

She maintained her innocent facade. “Sophia, please don’t say that. I’m sure Isabella didn’t mean it. She must have been overwhelmed with her diamond ventures and simply forgot to call Grandpa. Grandpa, please don’t be upset.”

Her words only deepened the gloomy atmosphere.

Busy? More like deliberately neglectful! William’s disappointment was palpable.

Isabella observed the performance between Sophia and Victoria with detached amusement. She looked like a queen being entertained by court jesters. “Are you two finished?”

She lifted her chin, a faint smirk playing on her lips. “Over the past five years, I attempted to contact Grandpa one hundred and ten times. Every call was blocked. I sent ten gifts. None reached him. I even tried emailing. Each message was intercepted by a hacker. How dare you question why I didn’t reach out?”

Her words were sharp and deliberate, each one landing with precision. She produced a thick stack of documents and flung them toward Sophia and Victoria.

The papers scattered in the air, evidence fluttering down for all to see. Purchase records. Mailing receipts. Call logs. All meticulously documented. Proof of deliberate interference. Photos of Sophia and her assistant Lillian collecting the gifts and discarding them.

The room froze, captivated by the damning evidence mid-air. Sophia’s face drained of all color.

How was this possible? How did Isabella uncover everything? And with such concrete proof?

William examined the falling documents. Understanding dawned. His face flushed crimson, his mustache quivering with rage. “Good. Very well! Sophia Kensington, you dared to do this behind my back? Reginald, fetch the whip. Make it sting!”

Not wishing to delay, Reginald produced a long, thorn-studded whip. It gleamed under the light, dried bloodstains still visible on its cruel barbs.

Terror seized Sophia. Her legs turned to jelly. “Grandpa, it wasn’t me!” she whimpered weakly. “She fabricated all of this! It’s lies!”

“Whip her. Now! Use all your strength!” William turned away, refusing to listen.

Seeing her beloved daughter facing such a brutal punishment, Penelope rushed forward. “Father, please! Forgive her! Just this once! She didn’t mean any harm!”

“Anyone who pleads for her will share her punishment,” William declared coldly.

Penelope fell silent. A desperate idea sparked in her eyes. She turned to Victoria. “Victoria, my dear niece, please! Speak for her! She’s never been beaten! She treasures her appearance! There will be scars!”

“I…” Victoria glanced around, feigning helplessness. “Auntie, I have no influence here. Isabella is the victim. If she forgives Sophia, Grandpa will surely relent.”

Hearing this, Penelope scrambled toward Isabella. “Isabella, I beg you! Sophia was wrong! She didn’t intend for this to happen…!”

“Mother, don’t beg her! She’s a witch! She made it all up! It wasn’t me!” Sophia screamed.

Her denial only fueled William’s fury. “Whip her! Now!” he snapped.

“As you wish.” Reginald bowed slightly.

Two bodyguards stepped forward, forcing Sophia onto a bench. Reginald raised the vicious whip high.

He brought it down with full force onto Sophia’s back.

A piercing scream echoed through the hall.
###Chapter 57

The first lash tore through Isabella’s dress instantly.

Blood seeped from her delicate skin, staining the fabric crimson.

Her face twisted in agony, but she refused to cry out. “It wasn’t me! Victoria set me up!”

Reginald sighed with resignation. She was too stubborn to admit defeat.

He had no choice but to continue.

Crack. Crack. Crack.

Each strike sliced deeper into her flesh.

Her back became a mess of torn skin and blood.

She finally collapsed, barely conscious.

With her last strength, she whispered, “I’m… innocent.”

Then everything went black.

William’s voice thundered across the room. “Get this liar out of my sight! She’s confined to the estate for three months. No exceptions.”

Three months of house arrest?

Sophia’s career would be ruined.

“Father, she’s a model! Her career will be over if she disappears now!” Penelope protested as she helped carry her daughter away.

“After this disgrace, does she even deserve to be a model?” William scoffed. “She will quit modeling and find a normal job. If she disobeys, she is no longer a Kensington.”

His tone left no room for argument.

Penelope fell silent, her eyes burning with hatred toward Isabella.

This was all her fault.

That wicked, ungrateful adopted daughter didn’t belong here.

Even after Sophia was taken away, the metallic scent of blood hung heavily in the air.

Victoria looked paler than anyone.

She could almost feel the whip herself.

If William ever discovered her role in this, she would suffer the same fate.

She couldn’t let that happen.

She needed those shares, and she needed them now.

Stepping forward, she poured William some tea, hoping to soothe his anger.

“Grandfather, please don’t be too upset. Sophia is young. She’ll learn from this. More importantly, Isabella’s name has been cleared. And she even gifted us a diamond mine. The Kensingtons will soon be the second richest family in Westchester.”

Her words reminded everyone of the contract on the table.

Gregory spoke up next. “Since you respect your grandfather so much, why not transfer the mine’s shares to him? He can distribute them fairly.”

Isabella was the reason his daughter was punished. She owed them this much.

Eleanor quickly agreed. “We raised you all these years. Fed you. Sheltered you. Without us, you’d be nothing. If you have any conscience, you know what’s right.”

Isabella ignored them completely.

She turned directly to William. “What do you think, Grandfather? Do you agree with them?”

“Hah! A pack of vultures!” William swept the teacups off the table in fury. “For five years, none of you cared about Isabella. Now that she’s back with wealth, you circle like sharks? Have you no shame?”

He glared specifically at Gregory. “You insisted on adopting her just to increase your shares. Did you put Sophia up to pushing her off that cliff in Africa? How dare you ask for her diamond mine! If I were you, I wouldn’t even speak!”

Gregory shrank back, muttering under his breath. “If I had that kind of courage, I wouldn’t be the useless gambler I am today.”

He had always been overlooked in the family. Powerless. Voiceless.

“It better not have been you! Attempted murder is unforgivable!” William growled.

“All of you, get out! Don’t even think about touching Isabella’s mine. She earned it with her life. It belongs to her and her alone!”
###Chapter 58

“Any person who dares speak of the diamond mine will forfeit their family shares!” William Kensington’s voice thundered through the room.

Victoria Kensington’s nails dug deep into her palms. An entire diamond mine, handed over to Isabella Montgomery? Just for her?

How utterly absurd!

The old man had clearly lost his mind.

Of course, Victoria swallowed those words. She forced a calm expression while fury boiled beneath her skin.

Then William added, “Isabella, now that you’re back, sign these documents. I’m transferring the fifteen percent family shares that were always meant to be yours.”

Reginald Thornton stepped forward, holding out the prepared paperwork.

Isabella hadn’t expected this. Not after being granted the diamond mine. A rare warmth flickered in her usually icy gaze.

Before she could pick up the pen, her adoptive father Frederick Montgomery protested loudly. “Father, have you gone mad? She already has a diamond mine worth billions! Why give her more? She doesn’t need it!”

Victoria quickly chimed in. “He’s right. Isabella is already overwhelmed. Managing Gray Diamond Empire, her modeling career… Adding family business responsibilities would be too much.”

Currently, William held thirty percent. Eleanor and Frederick each had twenty. Penelope and Gregory held ten. Benjamin had five. Sophia had five. Victoria possessed fifteen.

That left fifteen percent unclaimed.

Since Benjamin had willingly given his five percent to Victoria, she now held twenty. She had been coveting the remaining fifteen. With it, she would control thirty-five percent—more than William himself. She would become the majority shareholder and chair of the board.

She couldn’t let Isabella take it.

But William was firm. “Isabella has always been a Montgomery. She deserves these shares. As for the mine—she earned it with her own blood. If any of you are willing to risk your lives for one, you may keep yours too.”

He turned to Isabella. “Sign it. Ignore them.”

Isabella nodded. She took the pen and signed her name. If she refused, these shares would end up with Victoria. She would never allow that.

The room burned with hostile stares. Especially Victoria’s. She looked ready to explode.

She had waited five years for those shares. And now Isabella stole them. The woman already owned a diamond mine! Why did she need more?

“Everyone out,” William commanded. “I wish to speak with Isabella alone.”

They left, seething with resentment.

Once they were gone, William gestured for Isabella to approach. “Come. Sit with me.”

She moved closer and sat beside him. “Grandfather, regarding the mine…”

Even if he asked, she would never hand it over to the Montgomery family.

William patted her hand gently. “You did the right thing. You were never truly one of them. I can protect you now, but when I’m gone, they will turn on you.”

“You must safeguard your own fortune. You have no real family. Wealth is your only true ally.”

Isabella felt a pang of emotion. But confusion remained. “Why are you so kind to me?” she asked.

Everyone else despised her. Only William treated her like his own granddaughter. It made no sense.

A shadow crossed William’s eyes, there and gone in a flash. “You will understand in time.” He squeezed her hand. “For now, do not ask. It is not yet the moment.”

This only deepened Isabella’s bewilderment. What was he hiding? Why would he show such devotion to an adopted child? What secret lay behind his kindness?
###Chapter 59

In the Montgomery Manor gardens…

Victoria sat beneath a blooming jacaranda tree. Her blood still boiled from the recent events.

It would have been acceptable if William had transferred a small portion of shares to Isabella. But fifteen percent? Isabella now held the same stake as Victoria, the supposed true heiress of the Montgomery legacy.

To make it worse, netizens were glorifying Isabella, turning her into an icon. Others began questioning the earlier interview Victoria and Sophia had given. Speculations arose, branding Victoria as ‘fraudulent’ and ‘inauthentic’. Her ‘Top Supermodel’ title was on the verge of collapse.

Her agent, Isadora, stood nearby with a concerned expression. “Guci had finalized you for their seasonal cover. But they just called. They need more time to decide between you and Isabella.”

“What?” Victoria gasped, stunned.

Guci was no ordinary brand. It was the pinnacle of luxury fashion, adored by elites and coveted by the masses. An international powerhouse like Guci only featured established supermodels and A-list celebrities. Yet they were considering a newcomer like Isabella?

Watching Isabella and Grandpa sitting together in the nearby lounge, Victoria clenched her jaw.

“Victoria, securing the Guci ambassador contract is critical now. Losing it to Isabella would be disastrous,” Isadora warned.

Victoria’s face paled. Of course she wanted it. But how could she compete with this Diamond Queen? The nude scandal had already drained her resources. She spent fortunes deleting posts, erasing evidence, and bribing sources. The stains remained.

Moreover, Isabella’s online popularity now rivaled her own. How could Victoria possibly win?

Popularity… Rivalry…

An idea sparked. Her eyes lit up as she turned to Isadora. “Call Guci management. Suggest they hire two models instead of one.”

“Victoria, you mean…” Isadora processed the thought, then understood. “Brilliant! No wonder you dominate the industry. I’ll contact them immediately.”

If Guci chose Isabella over Victoria for the Summer cover, Victoria’s reputation would shatter.

A collaboration would eliminate that risk. Victoria could leverage Isabella’s fame to boost her own. As the seasoned model, her shots would outshine any amateur’s. The world would see Victoria’s superiority.

Isabella was just a wealthy upstart. Victoria would seize this dual shoot opportunity.

Alexander approached just as Isadora hurried away. “What’s going on?” he asked, noticing the rush.

“Nothing serious, just…” A sly smile touched her lips. “I learned Isabella’s manager was pushing for the Guci Summer shoot. But Guci had already chosen me. I asked Isadora to request bringing Isabella along.”

“What? After how she treated you? You’d share this with her?” Alexander objected, displeased.

Victoria took his arm. “Alexander, darling, she’s still my sister. I wronged her five years ago. I want to make amends. Her career is just beginning. As her sister, I should help.”

“You’re too generous. Far better than that wretched Isabella! Remembering how she pursued me makes my skin crawl.”

As he spoke, inspiration struck. Isabella had adored Alexander from age three to eighteen. A fifteen-year infatuation! How could she just stop? Her targeted tweets about him were clearly attention-seeking ploys!

If Victoria used Alexander to manipulate Isabella, turning her into a docile housewife…

The idea thrilled her, but she masked it with a guilty demeanor, lowering her head.

“Oh… That’s right. Alexander, darling, Grandpa already transferred fifteen percent to Isabella. I’m afraid I can’t help you secure the shares anymore.”

Alexander frowned. Already? So fast?

Five years ago, the Whitmore and Montgomery families forced him to marry the grotesque Isabella. He loathed her, but always coveted the Montgomery shares. Marrying her would have granted him control.

Noticing his concern, Victoria gently cautioned, “Alexander, darling, I believe Isabella still loves you. Think: Why is she still single despite being the Diamond Queen? Her tweets focus on you, despite her massive following. She’s likely seeking your attention!

“If we revive our five-year plan—making her obsessed with you—she’ll probably transfer her shares and the diamond mine to you!”

Alexander’s eyes darkened. Victoria was right. Marrying Isabella would grant him the shares and the mine. Coordinating with Victoria, they could seize the remaining shares and take over the entire Montgomery empire!

He looked at her in awe. “Victoria, you’re genius! Are you sure you’re comfortable with me marrying her?”

They had Grandpa’s permission. Once they obtained the engagement token, they could wed.

Victoria replied softly, “Alexander, darling, I’ll miss you, but I believe in our future beyond this pain. I trust you won’t fall for her.”

Even if he did, Victoria had contingency plans. Everything would proceed as she orchestrated.

She continued, “Once you marry Isabella, you’ll get her diamond mine plus the family shares. You’ll become Westchester’s wealthiest. I’d sacrifice anything for you, even temporary separation,” she murmured, nestling into his arms.

Warmth flooded Alexander. He felt blessed to have such an understanding fiancée.

“Don’t worry, Victoria. I won’t fail you,” he vowed sincerely.

Dusk settled. Isabella had conversed with her grandfather extensively but still couldn’t uncover his secret. She departed only after he fell asleep. Approaching her motorcycle, a sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled alongside.

The window lowered, revealing Alexander in the backseat. He wore a tailored white suit, his appearance refined and aristocratic.

“Get in. I’ll take you home,” he commanded, as if bestowing a favor.

Isabella gave him a cold stare. “You? Drive me? Overestimate yourself much?” She rolled her eyes, swinging onto her bike.

Alexander was stunned. Since when did this once-devoted follower address him with such arrogance? She sounded contemptuous. Furious, he recalled the plan.

He exited the car. “Isabella, can we talk?”

“Talk? About when you’ll eat shit?” She scoffed, igniting the engine.

As she prepared to leave, he dashed in front of the bike. “Isabella, can’t we communicate? I know you’re angry about five years ago, but it’s been ages. Why hold a grudge? Can’t we discuss this civilly? Why be so petty?”

“Me? Petty? Ha!” She laughed derisively. “You’re right. I’m petty. Anyone who hurts me gets run over.” She revved the accelerator, aiming directly at him.

The motorcycle lunged forward like a predator, speeding toward where Alexander stood.
###Chapter 60

“Oh… that’s right, Alexander darling. Grandpa already transferred fifteen percent of the Montgomery shares to Isabella. I’m afraid I can’t help you secure them anymore.”

Alexander frowned. Already? So soon?

Five years ago, the Whitmore and Montgomery families pressured him into marrying the unattractive and uncultured Isabella.

He resented her for it, but he always intended to seize the Montgomery family shares and take over their business. He believed marriage would grant him control of her inheritance.

Noticing his troubled expression, Victoria gently advised, “Alexander darling, I think Isabella still loves you. Why else would someone of her status—the Diamond Boss—remain unmarried all this time?

“Her social media is still filled with posts about you, despite her massive following. She might be trying to get your attention.

“If we restart our original plan—making her obsessed with you again—she’ll likely transfer her shares and the diamond mine to you!”

Alexander’s gaze sharpened. Victoria was right. If he could marry Isabella, the shares and the mine would become his. Then, working with Victoria, they could secure the remaining family shares and take over the entire Montgomery empire!

He looked at her with admiration. “Victoria, you’re brilliant! But are you truly comfortable with me marrying her?”

Alexander and Victoria already had Grandpa’s approval. Once they retrieved the engagement token, they could proceed.

Victoria replied in a soft, understanding tone, “Alexander darling, of course I’ll miss you, but this temporary sacrifice will lead to our forever. I trust you won’t actually fall for her.”

Even if he did, Victoria had contingency plans to eliminate Isabella. She would ensure everything unfolded as she designed.

She continued, “Once you marry Isabella, you’ll control her diamond mine plus the family shares we acquire. You’ll become the wealthiest man in Westchester. I’d do anything for your success, even endure this separation.” She nestled into his arms.

A warm feeling spread through Alexander. He felt fortunate to have such a supportive fiancée.

“Don’t worry, Victoria. I won’t let you down,” he vowed sincerely.

Night had fallen. Isabella had spent hours conversing with her grandfather but still couldn’t uncover what he was hiding. She finally left the manor after he fell asleep. As she approached her motorcycle, a sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up beside her.

The window lowered, revealing Alexander in the backseat. He wore a tailored white suit, looking every bit the distinguished gentleman.

“Get in. I’ll take you home,” he said, his tone condescending, as if bestowing a favor.

Isabella stared back coldly. “You? Drive me? You overestimate your importance.” She rolled her eyes and swung her leg over the bike.

Alexander was taken aback. Since when did the girl who once followed him everywhere speak to him with such contempt? It felt like she was looking down on him. Furious, he remembered the plan.

He stepped out of the car. “Isabella, can we talk?”

“Talk? About when you’ll eat sh*t?” she scoffed, starting the engine.

Seeing her prepare to leave, he rushed in front of the motorcycle. “Isabella, can’t we have a conversation? I know you’re still angry about what happened five years ago, but it’s been so long. Why hold a grudge? Can’t we discuss this calmly? Why be so petty?”

“Me? Petty? Ha!” She laughed mockingly. “You’re right, I am petty. I crush anyone who crosses me.” With that, she revved the engine and sped directly toward him.

The motorcycle surged forward like a predator, heading straight for Alexander.
###Chapter 61

Maxwell and his team watched from the shadows, their eyes wide with disbelief. Was their boss really going to hit him?

Isabella showed no hesitation. She revved the motorcycle's engine and charged straight toward him.

When Alexander realized she wasn't bluffing, that she was mere inches away, he instinctively leaped aside. The bike moved so fast it nearly caught his sleeve, forcing him to stumble backward.

Isabella glanced at him from the corner of her eye. A mocking smile curled her lips as she flipped him off.

Her wild hair streamed behind her in the night wind. She was fearless.

On the other side, Alexander stood pale with rage. The veins on his forehead throbbed with fury. The woman who once adored him had nearly run him over and then insulted him!

Why had she changed? How could she stop loving him?

No, it was impossible! This was just another one of her games to get his attention!

Alexander watched as Isabella disappeared into the distance.

"Isabella, if you wanted my attention, you've got it!" He turned to his assistant in the car and ordered, "Prepare a bouquet of roses. Send them to her shooting location tomorrow."

Alexander knew better than anyone that roses had been her favorite for eighteen years. Back when she followed him everywhere, she always begged him for roses.

Surely, she would melt when she received them tomorrow.

Women. They loved to play hard to get.

Isabella headed straight for the shower when she reached her manor. Just three minutes with that jerk made her feel sick.

As she stepped out, she noticed Julian was still there. Drying her hair, she asked, "Why are you still here?"

"You're famous now, but you don't seem to care. Naturally, I have a lot to handle," Julian replied, his eyes fixed on the computer screen.

Dozens of companies and brands had sent invitations to Isabella in just one day. Some wanted her as a brand ambassador, others for runway shows, and some sought collaborations hoping for her investment.

After reviewing every email carefully, Julian concluded, "Among all these, Guci is the most prestigious. It would be good for you, but it's highly competitive. The condition is to shoot a cover with Victoria, each representing a different color collection. Whoever's collection sells better wins."

Isabella frowned. Why would Guci suddenly use such a competitive tactic?

No doubt, this was another scheme from that fake bitch. So Victoria wanted to use her fame to boost her own? To defeat her in this showdown?

"I'll take it. Since Victoria wants to play, I can't say no. I just hope she won't regret it." Isabella tossed her half-dried hair and walked away.

She needed an early night, all to make Victoria regret ever proposing this.

Watching her leave, Julian smiled slightly. This woman grew more arrogant every day. He could only hope everything went according to plan.

Thinking of the plan, he made a call after leaving the manor. "Release the draft," he said into the phone.

Soon, a catchy article with an attention-grabbing headline became the center of discussion.
###Chapter 62

[Isabella and Victoria Kensington Collaborate on Cover Shoot: A Sibling Rivalry Showdown.]

The piece detailed every aspect of their professional face-off, complete with expert analysis of their respective strengths and weaknesses. Despite its objective and polished tone, fan wars erupted almost instantly after publication.

[So Isabella has money. Big deal. She’s still a rookie. How can she possibly compete with Victoria?!]

[What’s so special about Victoria? She didn’t even make the Chanel finale. Everyone knows new talent often outshines the old.]

[Pure luck. Isabella’s final walk was visually striking, but if you look closely, it was just her playing dress-up. How can she represent a powerhouse like Guci? Can she actually win this?]

[Exactly. The winner is determined by collection sales. Victoria has eighty million followers. Isabella has under eight. How is that even a competition?]

At the Blackwood Estate…

Nathaniel stood by the bed in the nursery. “Oliver Blackwood. Are you going to sleep or not?”

“No! I’m busy fighting these trolls. Mommy’s fanbase is too small. I’m using a hundred different accounts to defend her,” Oliver declared, rapidly switching between profiles on his tablet.

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. “You’ve been doing this for hours?”

“Yes! No one bullies Mommy on my watch!” Oliver pouted, his small fingers flying across the screen.

Nathaniel reached over and gently took the tablet. “This isn’t the way to support Mommy,” he said firmly. “Be good and get some rest. I’ll take you to see her tomorrow.”

“We’re seeing her tomorrow? Really?” Oliver’s eyes lit up like constellations.

Nathaniel gave a single, confirming nod. “Yes.”

The next morning, Isabella first completed a jewelry campaign shoot for Chanel before heading straight to Guci Tower.

Guci Tower occupied the most prestigious block in Westchester’s financial district. Rumors of the day’s shoot had drawn a massive crowd of fans, all gathered under the blazing sun. On the left side of the building, a boisterous swarm of supporters waved signs for Victoria Kensington. On the right, a quiet group of less than a hundred people waited patiently.

Isabella, after all, was a recent sensation. Her ‘Diamond Boss’ moniker sounded intimidating, not endearing. While she had gained admirers, few were devoted enough to stand in the heat for her.

As Isabella pulled up on her motorcycle, a sleek pink sports car arrived from the opposite direction. Its door swung open and Victoria emerged, elegant in a long mesh gown embroidered with delicate lisianthus blossoms.

The crowd erupted.

“Victoria! Victoria! Victoria!”

“The most beautiful supermodel! I love you! Can I get an autograph?”

“Victoria, sweetie, please, a photo!”

She was instantly swarmed, a radiant white swan at the center of a fervent flock.

Isabella simply parked her bike and dismounted. Her small cluster of supporters kept a respectful distance. Her aura was formidable, after all. She stood alone near the entrance, looking every bit the industry outsider.

“A nobody trying to compete with our Victoria? She’s just riding on her coattails.”

“I know, right? Has she even looked in a mirror? The audacity to shoot for Guci. Does she know how irrelevant she is?”

The jeers from the crowd were loud and clear, aimed at her solitary figure.
###Chapter 63

Victoria’s mouth twisted into a scowl. “Don’t speak about my sister that way. She has supporters too—just look.”

She gestured toward the far side of the venue, where a small cluster of about ten people lingered after the crowd had mostly dispersed. With over a thousand of Victoria’s fans still cheering loudly, Isabella’s group seemed pitifully small. As a newcomer to modeling, Isabella’s supporters seemed unsure how to show their enthusiasm, and many had already slipped away out of sheer awkwardness.

Victoria’s followers burst into mocking laughter.

“Ten people? That’s what she calls a fanbase? How embarrassing!”

“Didn’t she have eight million Twitter followers? Probably bought and paid for!”

“Exactly! She’s the Diamond Boss—she can afford fake followers!”

“What good is money if you’ve got no real talent?”

They stared at Isabella with open contempt, as if she were nothing but a circus act.

Just as Isabella pulled off her helmet, ready to respond—

“Isabella! Isabella! Isabella!”

A roar of voices cut through the air. Everyone turned to see a flood of people rushing toward her. Some sprinted, shouting as they ran.

“Isabella, I’m your biggest fan! What are you wearing today? I want to wear the exact same thing!”

“Isabella! I’m from Royal S Magazine—can I get a quick interview?”

“Look over here! I represent Tina Jewelry! Would you consider being our brand ambassador?”

“I don’t want to bother you, but could you please sign this? It’ll only take a second!”

A crowd of eager admirers swarmed around her, thrusting business cards and autograph books into her hands. Among them were celebrities, journalists, jewelry executives, singers, and even company owners—each one a recognizable name.

Were these high-profile individuals truly her fans? Had they canceled their appointments just to see her here?

Victoria’s face darkened with fury. Though she had many fans, Isabella’s supporters were influential figures. Even at the peak of her own career, Victoria had never attracted this level of elite attention. Important people usually sent assistants or subordinates in their place.

Victoria’s fans fell silent, recognizing famous faces in the crowd. They quickly pulled out their phones, scrambling to capture the moment.

How lucky to witness so many luminaries in one day!

The scene had flipped entirely. Now Isabella was the one surrounded, while Victoria stood ignored.

‘Did Maxwell arrange all this?’ Isabella wondered, scanning the crowd with a hint of suspicion.

She responded calmly. “Please reach out to my manager for any professional inquiries. As for autographs…”

She didn’t have a pen. But rejecting these enthusiastic admirers felt rude.

An idea struck her. She accepted the cards, then pulled a lipstick from her bag.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

“That’s a Guerlain Golden Diamond Lipstick! It costs three hundred and fifty thousand dollars!”

“My god—I heard the case is made of 18-karat gold weighing a hundred and ten grams! Hand-set with a hundred ninety-nine diamonds!”

“She’s signing with a lipstick that expensive? She really is the Diamond Boss!”

“Sign my shirt, Isabella! Please!”

Even some of Victoria’s fans broke away, rushing toward Isabella, begging for a signature worth more than most cars.
###Chapter 64

Isabella Montgomery accepted every request without hesitation.

She took the cards with one hand while signing with the other.

Her movements were swift and confident.

That vibrant crimson signature glowed with undeniable brilliance, much like the woman herself.

Victoria Kensington dug her nails deep into her palms.

She never imagined Isabella would steal her spotlight like this.

Her own fans had abandoned her for this upstart.

The humiliation burned.

She had been the center of attention just moments ago.

What went wrong?

She forced a sweet, concerned smile and approached. "Isabella, we should go. The Gucci team is waiting for us."

"Please be quiet!" An impatient fan waiting for a signature shot her an annoyed glare for interrupting.

Who cared if she was a top supermodel? They preferred Isabella!

The crowd, though initially arranged by Nathaniel, had become genuine admirers.

These were people who usually avoided public scenes.

But since they were here, they wouldn't miss a chance for her autograph.

Victoria's face tightened into a stiff mask.

How dare these minor celebrities and singers speak to her like that?

Veronica saw the storm brewing and quickly grabbed Victoria's arm. "Victoria, let's head up first. Remember the plan."

The reminder of her scheme cooled Victoria's rage.

A sinister glint flashed in her eyes.

The real victory would come during the shoot.

She would crush Isabella so completely she'd never work in modeling again.

As Victoria walked inside, Isabella watched her retreating figure and smirked inwardly.

You think you can compete with me? How pathetic.

Isabella didn't need to lift a finger to win.

Help always arrived when she needed it.

Across the street, in a top-floor office, Nathaniel Blackwood and Oliver watched the scene.

Oliver bounced with excitement. "Mommy is amazing! Her fans are so dedicated! Daddy, you must reward them!"

Nathaniel nodded and turned to his assistant. "Dominic, double their payment."

It was money well spent, especially for the one who told Victoria off.

Dominic frowned, perplexed.

This was getting out of hand.

Not only was the young master obsessed, but the chairman was also throwing millions at this woman.

Since when did wife hunting involve such extravagant spending?

Beauty was truly a dangerous thing.

Sebastian Blackwood couldn't hold his tongue. "Brother, instead of wasting money on this, why not just buy her a gift?"

"Buy her a gift? What could she possibly lack?" Nathaniel countered.

Sebastian was speechless.

After Isabella's identity was revealed yesterday, their deep background check showed she owned countless luxury cars, mansions, and brands.

Some parts of her profile remained mysteriously inaccessible.

"It seems my future sister-in-law won't be an easy catch. Brother, prepare yourself for potential failure."

Nathaniel just smirked. "Failure isn't a word in my vocabulary."

He reached for Oliver. "Momo, come here."

"Yay!" Oliver leaped into his arms.

Nathaniel hoisted him onto his shoulders and strode out.

Sebastian frowned.

What was his brother planning now?
###Chapter 65

Isabella only entered Guci Tower after reapplying her lipstick.

The entire staff stood waiting for her arrival. The moment she stepped inside, Guci's manager rushed forward to greet her. "Ms. Montgomery, what an honor to finally meet you in person. Our entire creative team is prepared and awaiting your direction."

"My apologies for the delay," Isabella responded with genuine courtesy toward the waiting staff.

"Please, no need for apologies. We completely understand given your demanding schedule." The manager personally escorted her toward the preparation area. "We'll begin your makeup while I overview today's shooting agenda."

Isabella settled into the chair beside Victoria, immediately surrounded by a team of makeup artists, hairstylists, and styling assistants.

Victoria's hands clenched beneath the vanity. The manager hadn't even acknowledged her presence earlier—just an assistant had shown her to this room. Yet Isabella received royal treatment from the moment she arrived.

How could a newcomer command more respect than the industry's top supermodel?

Gabriella noticed Victoria's darkening expression and quickly adjusted her foundation. "Stay focused, Victoria. Your performance during the shoot will overshadow everything else. You know how to work the camera better than anyone."

Victoria composed herself. Of course she did. She had dominated magazine covers for years. She understood angles, lighting, and how to captivate the lens. She would outperform Isabella completely and reclaim her position as the undeniable star.

The manager positioned himself between their stations. "For Guci's Summer collection, our designers created two distinct lines. Each of you will represent one collection. The magazine feature will determine which line generates higher sales, thus declaring the winner of this collaboration."

"Given your stellar reputations, we anticipate record-breaking sales for both collections. Now we need to determine who represents the Avocado Green line versus the Ruby Red collection."

Victoria immediately offered her suggestion. "Isabella's vibrant energy perfectly suits the red collection. Red naturally draws attention in print, which would certainly boost sales for that line. I'm happy to let her have it."

Her generous tone impressed the surrounding staff, who admired her apparent professionalism and kindness toward her colleague.

Isabella nearly laughed aloud. Does she truly think I'm this naive?

While ruby red made a bold statement, this was a summer collection. Consumers gravitated toward lighter, cooler tones during hot months—especially refreshing avocado green. Statistics showed most people avoided attention-grabbing colors; only a small percentage preferred standout pieces like ruby red. The green line would undoubtedly outsell the red.

Gabriella intervened when Isabella remained silent. "Is something wrong, Ms. Montgomery? Victoria generously offered you the superior collection. You should be appreciative."

"If it's so superior, then she should keep it. I don't require handouts," Isabella countered sharply.

Victoria's smile tightened. She would never actually choose the red collection herself. Summer consumers avoided bold reds.

"As your elder sister, I've always let you have the best things since we were children," Victoria resumed her gracious persona. "I want to continue that tradition now. I have faith you'll excel with the red collection."

She selected several avocado green garments and headed toward the changing room without looking back.
###Chapter 66

Isabella Montgomery could only manage a faint, bitter smile.

This entire situation could have been avoided if she had arrived earlier.

Now she was stuck with the Crimson Blaze collection.

A deep sense of irritation settled in her stomach as she watched Victoria Kensington claim the Sage Green line.

Engaging in a competition with someone like Victoria was utterly exhausting.

The manager and his team could practically feel the animosity crackling in the air.

None of them dared to comment or ask questions.

This was a professional rivalry, after all.

Some tension between the two models was to be expected.

Their only concern was the final outcome of the magazine shoot.

They needed both collections to generate significant hype and drive strong sales for Guci.

Everything else was secondary.

Isabella finished her makeup just as an assistant wheeled a clothing rack toward her.

“Ms. Montgomery, these are your outfits for today’s session.”

“The schedule calls for thirty-two individual portrait shots first.”

“After that, we will proceed to the joint cover photo with Ms. Kensington.”

Isabella’s eyes scanned the rack.

Every single garment was a vivid, intense shade of red.

The styles varied from long and short dresses to tailored suits and chic jumpsuits.

The designs themselves were actually quite beautiful.

But the overwhelming red color felt oppressive and heavy for a summer collection.

It would make anyone feel hot and uncomfortable just looking at it.

Isabella’s expression remained neutral and unreadable.

She simply selected one of the outfits and headed for the changing room.

Meanwhile, Victoria had already changed and emerged from her dressing area.

She wore a delicate avocado green mini dress.

The chiffon sleeves added a soft, ethereal touch.

The color was incredibly fresh and summery.

Paired with a high top-knot bun, the entire look screamed youthful innocence.

Even the head designer was impressed.

“The top model truly lives up to her title.”

“You’ve perfectly captured the essence of this dress.”

The mood shifted noticeably the moment Isabella stepped out.

A few frowns appeared among the staff.

Her outfit consisted of a long-sleeved chiffon jacket paired with wide-legged trousers that pooled around her heels.

Despite the lightweight fabric, the overall impression was one of heat and suffocation.

The head designer scoffed, unable to hide his disapproval.

“Who on earth decided a red collection was suitable for summer?”

“It’s a complete waste of Guci’s resources.”

His colleague remained silent, offering only a deep sigh.

In theory, summer could be both refreshing and vibrant.

But she had forgotten how a warm color like red could create such a stifling visual effect.

Victoria glanced at Isabella, her eyes gleaming with hidden triumph.

The Crimson Blaze collection was clearly better suited for autumn.

Releasing it in summer was a commercial death sentence.

No one would buy these clothes, no matter how good the photos turned out.

“Sister, I’m starting my shoot now,” Victoria said sweetly.

“Good luck with yours.”

Her words dripped with false sincerity, her true meaning clear.

Isabella ignored her completely and walked directly toward the photographer.

Designer Colette Duvall hurried after her, her face etched with worry.

“This collection might… cause some problems for you.”

“Are you absolutely sure you’re comfortable with it?”

“We haven’t even begun,” Isabella replied, her voice calm and confident.

“How can you be so sure we’ll fail?”

“A designer who lacks faith in her own creations will never succeed.”

Isabella studied her reflection in the mirror.

The craftsmanship of the garment was truly exceptional.

The materials were luxurious and of the highest quality.

The elegant cut gave her a regal, resplendent aura.

The delicate, see-through lace edging on the sleeves offered a subtle glimpse of skin.

It was a refreshing and unique detail.

Yet, something still felt missing…

“I can help you win this,” Isabella stated calmly.

“But I need you to trust me to make a few alterations.”

Before anyone could react, she picked up a pair of scissors from a nearby table.

She began to cut the fabric.

The entire photoshoot team stared in stunned silence.

Designer Colette Duvall looked utterly horrified.

She felt as if her heart were being shredded alongside the fabric.

These were her creations.

Each piece represented countless hours of painstaking work, blood, sweat, and tears.

And now Isabella Montgomery was casually cutting them apart.
###Chapter 67

Designer Colette Duvall had hoped the audience would still appreciate the artistic vision behind her creation, even if it wasn't the most innovative summer collection. She would've been content if just a handful of people connected with her pieces. Yet Isabella Montgomery was ruthlessly cutting apart her work! That garment was being destroyed right before her eyes!

The manager shifted uncomfortably. Isabella might be the diamond-clad boss, but she was currently representing Guci as their endorsement model. How could she vandalize Guci's specially designed clothing?

Isabella straightened her posture and discarded the excess fabric with a flick of her scissors. Instantly, everyone gasped in astonishment. The originally voluminous outfit transformed into a high-waisted masterpiece under her precise alterations.

The redesigned garment now accentuated Isabella's slender, sensual waistline. She had slit the wide-legged trousers up the sides, creating glimpses of her elegant legs that would tease with every movement. What was once loose and shapeless now radiated refreshing sophistication with an undercurrent of provocative allure.

Colette's initial heartache melted into emotional tears of joy. Her collection aimed for ethereal, free-flowing red garments, hence the long sleeves and trouser legs. Yet in her creative process, she had overlooked incorporating true elegance and visual appeal.

Witnessing Isabella's modifications, the clothes achieved greater fluidity and otherworldly beauty within minutes. Overcome with emotion, Colette exclaimed, "It's flawless! Absolutely perfect! Isabella, you're nothing short of genius!"

Maintaining her composed demeanor, Isabella moved to the center of the set. "Let's begin," she stated calmly.

The photographer shook himself from his daze and began working. Unlike most models who needed constant direction, Isabella transitioned seamlessly between poses. She held each position for precisely the right duration—just long enough for perfect shots before shifting stances.

Isabella understood the garments better than their creator. She simulated walking, making the wide trousers flutter dramatically. She raised a hand to touch her hair, showcasing the lace-edged sleeves perfectly. She sat at an angle with slightly bent knees, revealing glimpses of her shapely legs.

Every pose was exquisitely crafted. Breathtakingly beautiful! All thirty-two outfits underwent Isabella's transformative vision, producing spectacular results through the lens. Colette felt tears of gratitude welling up. She knew this collection would break sales records.

The shoot continued until late afternoon. An assistant approached Isabella. "Please take a moment to rest. Once Miss Victoria finishes her session, we'll proceed with the joint photoshoot. That will conclude today's work."

Isabella settled in the lounge, sipping the provided refreshments. Gabriella Martinez glanced her way and couldn't suppress a mocking laugh. "Finished already? The photographer must've been dissatisfied with you. You should learn from your sister—she's performing exceptionally. Her photographer can't stop shooting, hence their extended session."

"Why would I need to learn inferior modeling techniques from her?" Isabella retorted humorlessly.

Gabriella froze, words catching in her throat. 'Damn that Isabella!' she seethed internally.

Just then, Victoria concluded her photoshoot. Gabriella rushed to her side, escorting her to the lounge. Junior assistants immediately attended to Victoria—one serving an iced drink, another massaging her shoulders. She embodied refined elegance like royalty.

Meanwhile, Isabella sat alone. Victoria seized the opportunity. "Sister, why didn't you bring assistants? Ronnie, go help massage my sister's shoulders. Don't worry about me."

"Yes, Miss," Ronnie responded dutifully, moving toward Isabella.
###Chapter 68

“Unnecessary,” Isabella dismissed. “They were just photographs. Did that truly exhaust you? I don’t require such theatrics.”

She rose and walked toward the water dispenser.

Victoria had been relaxed, but Isabella’s sharp tone soured her mood instantly. Humiliation warmed her cheeks, but she quickly composed herself. She was the top model, after all.

She seized the moment. “Oh, what a useless older sister I’ve been. All these years at home, Mother and Father never allowed me to do a thing. They feared I might strain myself. That’s why I’m so terribly spoiled.”

She smiled sweetly. “I truly admire you, dear sister. You’ve had the chance to be so… independent. Not like me. Even on a simple walk, someone always holds my umbrella. Whatever I wish to eat is prepared immediately. I’ve told them often they should be kinder to you. That you could be their real daughter! Can you guess what they said?” She left the question hanging, a deliberate tease.

Isabella didn’t even glance her way, entirely focused on her water.

Undeterred, Victoria pressed on. “Mother and Father said you were always distant, even as a child. They never cared for your temperament. Your personality. They said even if you were their biological child, they would still prefer me.” Her voice was honeyed, but the threat beneath was crystal clear. Unraveling the truth would gain Isabella nothing. No one would ever take her side.

Before Isabella could respond, Beatrice Holloway arrived.

“Ms. Kensington, I had a feeling I’d find you here. Mrs. Montgomery heard you were working so hard on your magazine shoot all afternoon. She was terribly concerned. She prepared ambrosia specially and asked me to bring it to you.”

“Mrs. Montgomery dotes on you, Victoria,” Gabriella Martinez commented offhandedly, shooting a meaningful look toward Isabella. She accepted the ornate container to pass to Victoria.

“Give it to my sister,” Victoria instructed graciously. “She’s never had ambrosia made by our mother personally.”

“A fair point. Our Victoria has had it more times than she can remember. You may have this one.” Gabriella carried the container toward Isabella, her every movement dripping with condescending charity.

Isabella shot them a mocking glance. “Ambrosia has little nutritional value. It’s overloaded with refined sugar. Excessive consumption can lead to diabetes. Hypertension. If you desire something sweet and refreshing, yet far healthier, I’d suggest fruit. High in vitamins. Full of natural sugars. Far superior for you.”

She finished her assessment and waved a dismissive hand at the offering, her expression one of pure distaste. Victoria and Gabriella’s faces darkened instantly. They had made the ambrosia sound like poison!

Fury choked them, but they were surrounded by witnesses.

Gabriella forced her words through clenched teeth. “Isabella, don’t call the grapes sour just because they are out of your reach. Victoria was being generous. How can you be so venomous?”

“Ms. Montgomery isn’t being venomous. She is correct.” The Gucci manager, who had been observing quietly, stepped forward kindly. “In our country, few eat ambrosia regularly. The preservatives in many ingredients are harmful in large quantities. The sugar content is exceptionally high. A natural beauty like yourself should avoid heavily processed foods. Especially sugar-laden desserts like this.”

Victoria’s complexion turned stormy. Her nails dug sharply into her palms. She had never felt so publicly humiliated. Why did disaster always follow Isabella? She longed to wipe that smug look right off her face.

Just then, another figure entered. “Ms. Kensington, our chairman has prepared a bowl of clam chowder for you. He hopes you will enjoy it.”

Isabella’s mood lifted visibly. Clam chowder?

“Clams are a type of shellfish,” Victoria interjected, her voice sugary sweet. “High in protein. Very low in carbohydrates and fat. Exceptional nutrient density. Full of beneficial vitamins and minerals. Iron. Vitamin B-12. Omega-3.” She arched a perfectly sculpted brow, a glint of pure mischief in her eyes. “You don’t have an issue with clam chowder, do you, dear sister?”
###Chapter 69

Isabella’s gaze drifted toward the assistant waiting by the entrance before she answered Victoria. “There’s nothing wrong with clam chowder. But… this one isn’t for you.” She gave Victoria a dismissive glance and turned to the assistant. “Since you’re here, why are you just standing there?”

The assistant immediately stepped forward and placed the chowder in front of Isabella. “Ms. Montgomery, this is for you,” he said respectfully. “Mr. Blackwood spent three hours by the stove preparing this personally for you.”

Victoria froze. The chowder wasn’t for her—it was for Isabella! How could a newcomer like Isabella have a chairman cooking for her? It was infuriating. Absolutely maddening!

Whispers and mocking glances shot toward Victoria while others looked at Isabella with clear admiration.

Isabella accepted the bowl and took an elegant spoonful.

The moment it touched her tongue, her taste buds were awakened by the fresh, perfectly balanced flavor. It was rich but not heavy, utterly delicious. She couldn’t believe Nathaniel—that powerful, commanding man—could cook like this.

Watching Isabella savor the dish, Victoria burned with envy. Each spoonful felt like a slap. She forced her expression to remain neutral. “Isabella, dear, you accepted food from a stranger without even knowing who he is?” she said, layering her tone with sisterly concern. “You should know men always have hidden motives.”

“Accepting his food means accepting his advances. Once you do, he’ll never leave you alone. If you were hungry, you could’ve asked Gabriella or Penelope. They can get you anything you want. Why take food from a stranger?” Victoria’s voice was dripping with false worry.

Isabella smirked coldly. “Oh really? They can get me anything? In that case, can you have them get me ice cream from La Dolce?”

Victoria’s concerned mask slipped instantly. La Dolce was the most famous dessert shop in Westchester. The lines stretched for hours. Hundreds waited daily just for one scoop.

When Victoria didn’t respond, Isabella raised a brow. “Cat got your tongue? You sounded so convincing earlier. Unless… you were just putting on a show?”

Victoria’s face flushed deep purple under the stares of everyone around. She struggled to keep her composure. “Of course not! If that’s what you want, you’ll have it. Penelope, what are you waiting for? Go get it now.”

“Yes, Miss.” Penelope, who had been massaging Victoria’s shoulders, pressed her lips together and hurried out.

‘This heat is unbearable. They’re trying to kill me making me stand in line for hours. That cunning Isabella knows how to make life difficult,’ Penelope fumed silently.

•••

After Penelope left, Victoria turned back to business. “Isabella, since you’ve accepted the chowder, shouldn’t you at least find out who this chairman is? You should thank him properly. It’s basic manners.” This mysterious chairman had helped Isabella twice now. She needed to uncover his identity!

Isabella’s lips curved into a captivating smile. “You would need to thank him. But I don’t.” Her eyes shifted to the assistant. “After all, he’s Harrison Winslow’s assistant. Since Harrison works under me, I don’t need to thank the assistant of my subordinate.”

Her tone was cool and arrogant.

Isabella was lying, but it was for Nathaniel’s protection. If Victoria found out it was him, she would latch onto him and never let go.

Victoria’s gaze turned icy. She stared at the assistant in disbelief. “You’re Harrison Winslow’s assistant?”
###Chapter 70

Prince Harrison Winslow personally preparing clam chowder for Isabella Montgomery? Impossible! Dominic Sterling, Nathaniel Blackwood's assistant, froze in disbelief. He met Isabella's icy stare, a silent warning that sent chills down his spine. Nathaniel's orders echoed in his mind: 'Comply with her every request.'

He straightened his posture. "Yes, my chairman is indeed Prince Harrison Winslow."

Victoria Kensington went rigid. She had envisioned seducing this mysterious chairman, twisting him to her will. Instead, Isabella had humiliated her publicly once more. Heat flooded Victoria's cheeks, her heart hammering against her ribs. "Isadora," she stammered, her voice tight, "assist me to the changing room. The final shot must be ready."

"Absolutely! Your dedication to work is unparalleled, Victoria. Unlike others who prioritize...indulgence," Isadora Vasquez retorted, shooting a venomous glare toward Isabella before guiding Victoria away.

Isabella simply rolled her eyes, dismissing them. She handed the container back to Dominic. "Inform him his deliveries are no longer required. He should focus his attention where it truly belongs." She had accepted Nathaniel's gestures twice now, yet the thought of him lavishing effort on her while neglecting Christopher soured her impression. Since returning, her focus was business, not romance.

Dominic deemed silence the wisest course. He gave a curt nod and departed.

Whispers erupted among the crew. What did Isabella's words imply? It sounded as though Prince Harrison had developed feelings for her, and she was nobly reminding him to remain devoted to his wife, Princess Arabella. How admirably principled.

Isabella ignored their speculative stares and headed to her changing room.

•••

This was the final outfit, destined for the magazine cover. A duo shoot was far more complex than solo portraits. It demanded individual excellence while simultaneously overshadowing your partner to command the spotlight.

Victoria had meticulously prepared, perfecting her makeup. When she saw Isabella emerge in a deep crimson gown, a smug smile touched her lips.

The dress was a rich, blood-red. Puffed short sleeves, a square neckline hugging the collarbone, and a voluminous skirt of layered mesh. Though opulently French-inspired, it felt heavy, out of sync with the summer theme.

In stark contrast, Victoria wore a light avocado green sleeveless mini-dress. Delicate lace adorned the shoulders, exuding sweet delicacy. A subtle V-neck offered a hint of cleavage. The most daring feature was the triangular cut-out at the waist, exposing a sliver of pale stomach and her navel. The effect was playfully alluring.

Side-by-side, Victoria's dress was clearly the covetable piece. The manager announced, "The flamingo is your prop. Pose freely, but maintain harmony."

"Understood," Victoria purred. She approached the flamingo, gracefully straddling it. Her legs stretched out, the short skirt riding up to showcase their long, toned length. Angled slightly toward the camera, the pose accentuated her chest curve and the strategic cut-out.

She leaned casually against the prop, embodying a fresh-faced, lovable ingenue. A wave of applause broke from the team.

"Exquisite! Pure perfection! Don't move a muscle, Ms. Kensington! Hold that pose!" the photographer exclaimed excitedly. He turned to Isabella. "Ms. Montgomery, complement Ms. Kensington's pose. Just ensure you don't disrupt her."

'Don't disrupt her.' Victoria's heart soared. Isabella would be relegated to the background, forced to find some pathetic pose that merely framed Victoria's brilliance. There was no way Isabella could outshine her now. She was destined to fade into obscurity next to Victoria's radiant display.
###Chapter 71

Colette Duvall watched Isabella Montgomery with deep concern.

Anxiety twisted inside her.

What was Isabella planning? Could she perform miracles? This seemed utterly impossible.

Meanwhile, Victoria Kensington sat gracefully upon a flamingo float.

A sweet, practiced smile adorned her face.

She resembled an ethereal fairy, blissfully unaware of the mounting tension.

The avocado green and pink flamingo created a perfect, vibrant contrast.

The aesthetic was so pleasing it almost made one forget the oppressive midsummer heat.

In stark contrast, Isabella wore a voluminous red top paired with a loose, floor-length skirt.

She was completely covered up. Not an inch of skin on her chest or legs was visible.

How could she possibly outperform Victoria like this?

The watching crowd buzzed with curiosity.

Isabella, however, remained utterly nonchalant.

She turned to Victoria, her voice cool. "Are you absolutely certain about this pose? You won't regret it?"

"Of course," Victoria replied, her tone dripping with subtle sarcasm. "Why? Can't you think of anything better?"

Isabella simply sighed, offering no retort.

In one fluid motion, she swung a leg over the same horizontal flamingo.

She settled directly behind Victoria.

The long, heavy skirt restricted her movement, forcing her legs together.

It looked stifling and awkward.

A collective sigh of disappointment rippled through the onlookers. This seemed like a certain loss.

Then, something unexpected happened.

Isabella reached out and firmly placed her hands on Victoria's shoulders.

Her face was a mask of stoic elegance.

She shifted her weight onto her arms, leveraging herself.

The move was executed with shocking grace and precision.

The crowd gasped. Isabella had effectively turned Victoria into a mere prop, a human coffee table.

It was a brilliant, audacious move.

"Let's shoot," Isabella commanded, her voice cutting through the stunned silence.

The photographer jolted back to attention.

He quickly adjusted his viewfinder, lens focusing on the extraordinary pair.

Gabriella Martinez had considered intervening.

But she held back.

Isabella's dress, despite the clever pose, was still overwhelmingly heavy and complex.

Layers of mesh and netting. Who would ever buy it?

Isabella's expression was captivating, fierce.

But Victoria was classically beautiful, photogenic.

This contest was about sales, not just drama.

How could Isabella possibly win?

Gabriella stayed silent.

"Begin!" the photographer called out. "Give me your best!"

He raised his camera, finger poised over the shutter.

In that split second, Isabella used her free hand.

She flung the heavy fabric of her skirt backward with dramatic force.

The shutter clicked, capturing the frozen moment.

The resulting image was breathtaking.

Isabella's body leaned forward over her 'table', her face propped elegantly on one fair hand.

Her gaze into the lens was boldly haughty, utterly commanding.

The ugly, shapeless clothes were transformed.

She made them look expensive, avant-garde.

The skirt, flung back, mimicked the effect of a powerful gust of wind.

Her aura was grandiose, stunningly powerful.

The photographer stared at his screen, breathless. "Perfect! Absolutely perfect!"

No one had imagined a model could salvage such a situation.

Victoria, sitting in front, couldn't see what had happened.

She assumed the praise was for her. She had given her best performance.

"Was it good?" she asked coyly, batting her lashes. "Do you need another shot?"
###Chapter 72

Victoria’s voice snapped the photographer from his trance.

He had completely forgotten she was even there.

He squinted at the digital display.

The composition was technically flawless.

Victoria’s performance was adequate.

But the entire background was a wash of soft pink, mirroring the flamingos.

Her avocado-green outfit simply vanished into the scenery.

All visual focus was violently pulled toward Isabella.

Her flaming-red dress was a shock to the senses.

Victoria’s pale colors made her recede, becoming part of the set.

She looked less like a model and more like a piece of furniture.

A very expensive, very dedicated prop.

Isabella’s pose, leaning casually against her, sealed the interpretation.

Victoria smiled dutifully at the camera, clutching the flamingo.

The overall impression was one of a mistress and her attendant.

A queen and her devoted handmaiden.

It was a perfect shot, if you ignored Victoria’s complete erasure.

“We’re done,” the photographer declared. “It’s perfect. No reshoot needed.”

Isabella immediately turned and walked toward the changing rooms.

The outcome was clear. The battle was over.

Victoria watched her go, a tight smile on her face.

She was certain Isabella was fleeing from her humiliation.

She needed to see those photos now.

She needed to savor the victory.

She glided over to the photographer, her voice sweet. “Mr. Delacroix, you’ve worked so hard. Might I take a peek at the results?”

“Of course, Miss Kensington,” he said, wary. “But please be careful. This equipment is very fragile. And very expensive.”

“I’ll be extremely careful,” she promised, stepping to the side.

She exchanged a quick, silent look with Isadora.

Isadora nodded almost imperceptibly.

She moved behind Victoria, pulling out her phone.

She pretended to scroll through messages.

Her real intention was to covertly photograph the camera’s screen.

They both expected to see Isabella’s disastrous shots.

They were prepared to mock her unprofessional hand movement.

The image on the screen stole the breath from their lungs.

Victoria was annihilated.

She was a blur of green, a background extra in Isabella’s stunning feature.

Isabella was the entire story.

Her red dress seemed to flow with its own life, capturing an invisible wind.

She was midsummer personified.

Every solo shot of Isabella was a masterpiece of raw, captivating power.

Victoria’s solo shots were pretty. Pleasant.

But next to Isabella’s, they looked cheap. Common.

The avocado green made her resemble a store mannequin.

Victoria’s nails dug into her own palms, her smile frozen.

How?

How was this possible?

Those clothes were meant to be her coffin!

They were heavy, ugly, stifling.

Isabella somehow turned them into a crown.

If these photos were released, Victoria’s career would be a joke.

Isabella would eclipse her completely.

She tapped Isadora’s leg with her shoe.

A silent command.

Isadora took a sharp, steadying breath.

She stepped forward, her voice overly bright. “Victoria, you and Isabella were amazing together! This issue is going to be incred— Ahh!”

She deliberately caught her heel on a loose cable.

She stumbled violently into Victoria.

Victoria, perfectly prepared, feigned surprise.

She crashed into the photographer’s outstretched arms.

The expensive camera was launched from his grip.

It sailed through the air in a horrifying arc.

Time seemed to slow.

Then, a sickening crunch of plastic and glass echoed through the studio.

The camera shattered on the hard floor.

Pieces skittered everywhere.

The memory card popped out.

It landed neatly.

Isadora’s heel came down on it with precise force.

A clean, definitive snap.

The card broke in two.
###Chapter 73

Gasps echoed through the studio.

Vincent Delacroix looked utterly devastated.

His custom-built camera was worth a fortune. Every shot from today's grueling session was stored inside.

He dropped to his knees, cradling the shattered equipment with shaking hands.

A thin trickle of blood marked Victoria Kensington's forehead. She ignored it completely.

Her head bowed in contrition. "This is all my fault! I'm so terribly sorry! It was a complete accident! Please, just tell me the cost. I'll cover every penny of the damages!"

"Money can't replace what was lost! That footage was priceless! A full day's work from the entire team gone!" Vincent's voice trembled with a rage he'd never directed at a woman before.

Tears welled in Victoria's eyes. She turned, offering frantic apologies to every stunned crew member in the room.

"I'm begging for your forgiveness! My manager wasn't watching her step... This is entirely on us. I'll reimburse the camera, the lost images, the advertising fees. I'll even cover three days of lost sales revenue. I promise my performance tomorrow will be even stronger than today's. Please, just give me another chance."

Her voice cracked with genuine-sounding distress. The display of vulnerability was masterful. It instantly softened the angry glares around her.

The production manager took a deep, steadying breath. "Fine. We reschedule for tomorrow," he finally grumbled, his tone resigned.

He knew recreating today's magic was nearly impossible. The perfect lighting, the model's energy—it was a fleeting alchemy. This was a compromise born of pure necessity.

Victoria bowed deeply once more. "Thank you! Thank you so much for your understanding. I won't let you down tomorrow!"

Her words were honeyed and meek. But as her head dipped, a fierce, triumphant fire burned in her eyes, unseen by anyone. Isabella Montgomery would not have a successful shoot tomorrow. She would make sure of it. Isabella's time here was over.

Just then, Isabella emerged from the dressing room.

The manager approached her, his expression grim. "Ms. Montgomery, I have terrible news. Our primary camera and the backup SD card are destroyed. Today's work is lost. I must humbly ask you to return for a reshoot tomorrow."

Isabella's brow furrowed. "Excuse me?"

Victoria rushed forward, her voice a pleading whimper. "Isabella, please don't be angry with them. This was my mistake. I broke the equipment. I'll personally cover your fee for tomorrow, and I'll add an extra million for your trouble. Please, you must agree to come back. I'm begging you."

She looked the picture of pathetic remorse.

Isabella's gaze swept over Vincent, still kneeling amidst the wreckage. She studied the scattered pieces of plastic and glass.

Her response was calm and absolute. "I'm sorry. I can't do tomorrow."

A wave of disbelief and anger rippled through the crew.

Victoria had apologized profusely. She'd groveled. A top model was willing to reshoot. Who did this newcomer think she was, refusing?

The manager's voice turned stern. "Ms. Montgomery, this was an unforeseen accident. None of us wanted this. The SD card is destroyed. The data is unrecoverable. A reshoot is our only option."

"Is it?" Isabella asked coolly.

She walked over to Vincent and gently took the damaged SD card from his limp hand.

A tense silence fell as she moved toward the computer terminal.

Nervous glances were exchanged across the room.
###Chapter 74

Could it be fixed? A memory card broken in two pieces was beyond repair.

Victoria’s eyebrows shot up. She immediately rushed after Isabella. “Isabella, stop playing games. There’s no way that’s fixable. Not even a miracle could save it. Just hand it over—I’ll get Vincent a new one tomorrow.”

“What’s impossible for miracles isn’t necessarily impossible for me. Now move.”

Isabella pushed Victoria aside and headed straight for the computer. She sat down, flipped the damaged chip, and began reassembling the broken parts.

Her pale, slender fingers moved with startling precision and grace.

Vincent had already noticed Isabella’s elegant hands during the shoot. Watching her work now lifted his mood. Even if the card couldn’t be saved, he knew he’d capture something special when they reshot.

All eyes were on Isabella. The room was silent, tense. No one dared interrupt.

Only Victoria’s breathing grew ragged. Her nerves tightened. If Isabella actually pulled this off, everything would be ruined. She’d have to pay millions in compensation. And worse—Isabella would look like the hero.

She had to do something. Anything.

Isabella slotted the reassembled card into the reader and plugged it into the computer. Lines of code flashed across the screen as her fingers flew over the keyboard.

A progress bar appeared, inching slowly forward.

Victoria’s fists clenched. She shot a desperate look at Isadora. If they could just ruin the computer now…

But Isadora shook her head subtly. Two “accidents” in a row would be far too suspicious.

Ding.

A folder popped open on the screen. All the day’s photos were there, perfectly intact.

Vincent nearly cried with relief. He rushed over and grabbed Isabella’s hands. “Isabella, thank you! I can’t tell you how much this means!”

As a photographer, he knew better than anyone—some moments couldn’t be recreated. The mood, the energy, the light. Tomorrow’s reshoot would never have matched today’s magic.

The whole room erupted in admiration.

“Incredible! She actually recovered them!”
“Isabella, you’re a genius! An absolute legend!”
“I’m officially a fan. No—I worship you.”

Everyone looked at her with newfound respect. She wasn’t just a pretty face or a talented model. She was a problem-solver. A savior.

Victoria’s face twisted with fury. Her plan had backfired spectacularly. Not only had she lost a fortune, but she’d made Isabella look even more impressive.

She couldn’t take it. Excusing herself with a stiff smile, she slipped out of the room.

•••

Outside, Victoria kicked angrily at the grass. That wretched Isabella had ruined everything. Those photos could end her career if they ever got out. She had to crush Isabella before she rose any higher.

Just then, she spotted a man walking toward her, holding a bouquet of roses.

Her eyes lit up. Of course. How could she have forgotten?
###Chapter 75

The man walking toward her was Harrison Caldwell, Alexander Whitmore's personal assistant. It seemed Alexander was determined to marry Isabella Montgomery.

‘Once Isabella is married… A married woman can’t possibly continue modeling. Especially if she gets pregnant…’ Victoria Kensington smiled to herself, her mood instantly lifting.

“Are those flowers for Isabella? You should treat her well,” Victoria said sweetly.

“Yes, Miss Kensington.” Harrison bowed his head, though confusion swirled inside him. Wasn’t Chairman Alexander supposed to be dating Victoria? Why was he suddenly pursuing Isabella? And why did Victoria seem supportive instead of jealous?

He knew better than to question his superiors. His only task was to deliver the bouquet.

Nearby, a sleek black luxury car idled at the curb. Nathaniel Blackwood sat in the backseat, holding ninety-nine rare angel’s trumpets. A small card rested atop the blossoms: [Your beauty eclipses them all.]

“Do you think she’ll like these?” Nathaniel asked, his voice tense. “Flowers are a safe choice, right?”

Sebastian Blackwood nodded confidently. “Absolutely. Women adore flowers. These angel’s trumpets perfectly match her elegance and status. If she displays them at home, she’ll think of you every time she sees them. Far better than those desserts she devoured without a second thought.”

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. He remembered the elaborate pastries he had crafted for her. Her only response had been a terse, “Stop sending these.” It was the first time a woman had outright rejected his advances. Perhaps flowers would work better.

Just then, Isabella emerged from the building. Nathaniel adjusted his tie, ready to step out with the magnificent bouquet. Oliver Blackwood, sitting beside him, pumped his fist. “Good luck, Dad!”

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. But as he moved to exit the vehicle, he saw another man—Harrison—approach her first, presenting a lavish arrangement of roses.

“Miss Montgomery, these are from Chairman Alexander Whitmore. Imported French roses. He personally selected each and every bloom.”

Harrison deliberately emphasized that Alexander had chosen the flowers himself, his tone dripping with condescension. He knew Isabella had once desperately craved Alexander’s attention. Surely she would be overjoyed to finally receive his affection.

So what if she was the infamous Diamond Boss? She just got lucky. Underneath it all, she was still that uncultured, worthless woman who relied on men.

He expected a gushing, grateful response.

Instead, Isabella scoffed. “Alexander picked out these generic flowers himself? His taste is truly appalling.”

She brushed past him, her shoulder knocking against his. Harrison stood frozen in shock. Did she just insult Alexander’s taste? Hadn’t she pined for him for years? Hadn’t she dreamed of this moment?

Victoria watched the scene unfold, equally stunned. Isabella didn’t care anymore? After fifteen years of obsessive love and relentless pursuit, she had just… moved on? Just like that?

Nathaniel halted, his hand on the car door. He looked down at the exquisite flowers in his grasp.

‘Generic flowers?’ ‘Appalling taste?’

He threw the bouquet into a nearby trash bin and shot a sharp, disapproving glare at Sebastian.

Sebastian offered a weak, apologetic smile. “Well… I suppose our sister-in-law has rather unique preferences?”

Meanwhile, Harrison remembered his chairman’s strict orders. Swallowing his pride, he hurried after Isabella. “Miss Montgomery, please accept these as a token of the chairman’s genuine affection. If you have any issues, please discuss them with him directly. Don’t put me in such a difficult position…”

Isabella stopped and turned, a look of pure ridicule on her face.

“What? Do you need me to sign a receipt for them too?”
###Chapter 76

A strange unease twisted in Harrison Caldwell’s stomach. He couldn’t explain the sudden dread.

Isabella Montgomery moved without warning. Her leg shot out in a sharp, controlled arc.

A crisp, crushing sound tore through the air.

The vibrant angel trumpets were instantly destroyed. Only broken stems remained in the bouquet Harrison still clutched. “We’re done here,” Isabella said coldly. “Leave. Now.”

She was once so gentle. So obedient. When did she become this fierce? This untamable?

Inside the car, Oliver Blackwood clapped his small hands. “Mommy is amazing! That was so cool! Daddy, you have to try harder! Go get her! Don’t let anyone else take her!”

Nathaniel Blackwood considered his son’s words. Pursue her? How? With Isabella’s fiery spirit, she’d likely dismiss him completely.

He glanced at Sebastian, irritation flaring. “Weren’t you the expert on romance? Why are you so quiet now?”

“I know nothing,” Sebastian replied quickly. “I’m just the driver. A very dedicated driver.”

Dedicated? Nathaniel’s mouth curved into a faint, humorless smile. “I have a plan,” he told Oliver. “Just follow my lead.”

The confrontation over, Isabella strode toward the parking lot. She swung a leg over her motorcycle, ready to depart.

“Mommy! Mommy!”

She turned. Nathaniel was walking toward her, Oliver perched high on his shoulders. The boy looked tiny and adorable up there. Nathaniel’s frame was solid and powerful. The contrast was striking. A handsome man. A precious child. It was a captivating image.

Isabella’s brow furrowed. “What are you doing here?” Her tone was sharp, unwelcoming. Nathaniel was accustomed to her coldness. “Last time, your advice was invaluable,” he stated calmly. “I remembered every word. Oliver’s school has a trip today. I took the day off. We’re going to the amusement park.”

Her expression softened slightly. She was surprised he was actually trying.

“However,” Nathaniel continued, his voice earnest, “this is my first time taking him out like this. It’s a crowded place. I’m concerned I won’t be able to manage him properly. That’s why I sought you out. For your guidance.”

“Well…” Isabella studied his serious face. She began instructing him in a firm tone. “He’s still small. Avoid extreme rides. No rollercoasters. No pendulum swings. The park will be packed. You must watch him constantly. It’s easy to get separated. Also—”

Suddenly, Oliver began to sob. Loud, dramatic tears. “I—I want Mommy to protect me! Daddy is a man! He’s not careful! He’s already lost me ninety-eight times!”

“Ninety-eight times?” Isabella gasped, horrified.

Oliver nodded pitifully. “Shopping. Work. Parties. Banquets. He always forgets me! I don’t feel safe! I don’t want to go with Daddy! I won’t go!”

“Oliver, be reasonable,” Nathaniel said patiently. “I’ll watch you closely this time. It’s a school trip. All your friends will be there. They’ll tease you if you don’t go.”

This only made Oliver cry harder. He was hysterical. “No! No! I’m not going! I refuse!”

He thrashed in Nathaniel’s arms, his small limbs flailing. In the struggle, he launched himself forward.

He landed squarely in Isabella’s embrace.
###Chapter 77

Isabella’s brow furrowed as she looked down at Oliver, nestled in her arms. “Momo, what’s the matter? Your father cleared his entire schedule to take you to the amusement park. Why don’t you want to go? As long as you stay close and don’t run off, you won’t get separated from him.”

Oliver sniffled pitifully, his small frame trembling. “I don’t… I don’t want to go anymore.” Fresh tears began to stream down his cheeks.

Isabella was typically detached, indifferent to the emotions of others. Yet something about Oliver’s distress pierced through her usual reserve. Her heart clenched painfully. She held him tighter. “Momo, you can tell me what’s wrong. I’ll talk to your father. He won’t be allowed to upset you.”

The boy wiped his nose with the back of his hand. “It’s not Daddy… It’s not his fault. The teacher said this trip is for families. For moms and dads to be with their kids. All the other children will have both their parents there. This morning, Ethan called me. He was bragging… His mommy bought him a new bubble machine!”

He took a shaky breath, his voice cracking. “Momo doesn’t have a mom. If I go, they’ll just tease me again. I’d rather stay home by myself and cry. It’s better than being laughed at!” His sobs intensified, his small body shaking uncontrollably.

Isabella’s shoulder grew damp with his tears. She could feel the profound sadness radiating from him. It was heartbreaking.

She glanced up at Nathaniel, her expression stern. “Countless women would jump at the chance to be on your arm. Surely the great Nathaniel Blackwood can find a suitable companion for one day.”

“I considered that,” Nathaniel replied, his voice low and serious. “But the background checks were concerning. Their primary motivation is to become Mrs. Blackwood. With that ambition, Oliver becomes a pawn. His safety is my utmost priority. I cannot risk it.”

Isabella frowned. He was right. What woman wouldn’t want to marry Nathaniel Blackwood? The power, the prestige. Many would see a child as an obstacle to be removed. The thought made her blood run cold.

She suddenly became aware of their intense gazes fixed on her. Both father and son were watching her with a silent, unnerving expectancy. A shiver ran down her spine.

“I… I have prior engagements today,” she stated quickly, averting her eyes. “I can’t accompany you to the amusement park.”

Oliver’s face crumpled instantly. The light in his eyes extinguished. “It’s okay… I know you don’t like me, Mommy. I must have done something bad. You should go home and rest. Momo will be fine. I won’t bother you anymore…” His voice was a tiny, broken whisper.

He slowly released her hand. His small shoulders slumped as he took a few unsteady steps away. He looked utterly lost and alone.

“What did Momo do wrong?” he wept quietly, almost to himself. “Why am I the only one without a mommy? Why doesn’t my real mommy want me? Why don’t you want me?”

Each word was a dagger to Isabella’s heart. The pain was sharp, constricting her throat. Every instinct screamed at her to run to him, to sweep him into her arms and promise him the world. But she couldn’t. It was impossible.

Her business with the Montgomery family was concluded. She needed to return home. There were pressing matters awaiting her attention. Furthermore, the events of five years ago had sealed her fate. A happy ending with them was a fantasy she could not afford.

She hardened her resolve, forcing herself to remain still.

Just then, Oliver, who was still crying as he walked, suddenly stumbled. His small body convulsed violently, collapsing onto the grass. His cries turned into choked, guttural whimpers. A faint froth appeared at the corners of his mouth.

“Oliver! Oliver!” Isabella’s composure shattered. All logic and reason vanished. She sprinted forward, dropping to her knees and gathering his convulsing form into her arms. Panic seized her. She glared up at Nathaniel, her voice sharp with fear. “What’s happening to him?! Call an ambulance! Now!”

“It won’t help,” Nathaniel explained calmly, though his eyes were dark with concern. He gently took Oliver from her and laid him carefully on the ground. “This happens when he becomes excessively upset. The seizures are sporadic. They can last up to thirty minutes before subsiding on their own. You should go. Handle your work. He’ll be alright here.”

Thirty minutes? The thought was unbearable. Isabella stared, horrified, at the small body jerking uncontrollably on the lawn. She could no longer stand it.

She reached out and grasped his tiny, trembling hand. Her voice was firm, laced with a surrender she hadn’t known she possessed. “Momo, get better. I’ll do it. I’ll be your mommy for the day. I’ll go to the amusement park with you. Okay?”
###Chapter 78

In a flash, Oliver—who had been convulsing on the ground moments before—leapt up with a burst of energy.

He threw his small hands in the air. “Hooray!”

Then he launched himself straight back into Isabella’s embrace.

Isabella was stunned. ‘How did he bounce back so fast? This… feels like a setup.’

Noticing her hesitation, Oliver wrapped his plump arms around her neck. “Mommy, Uncle Sebastian said my twitching is all in my head,” he explained quickly. “If I take medicine, I’ll get better slowly. You promised. You can’t go back on your word now. We’re going to the amusement park! Grown-ups can’t break promises. They can’t teach kids to lie either.”

What could she say? Isabella gently pinched his soft cheeks. “You clever little thing. Fine. I promised, so I’ll keep it. We’ll go. But from now on, you have to be strong, okay? You’re tough. You won’t let a little mind-trick beat you.”

“Okay! I’ll listen to Mommy!” Oliver beamed, his smile pure sunshine.

Nearby, Sebastian watched, impressed. Their plan actually worked. They’d tricked her into agreeing!

His brother did know how to charm a woman. After 28 years, he was finally unleashing his skills on someone like Isabella.

Sebastian quickly slid back into the driver’s seat, playing his part. Nathaniel opened the car door like a true gentleman. “After you, Ms. Montgomery.”

Isabella carried Oliver inside and settled in the back. She almost told Nathaniel to sit up front, but then she saw the tall stack of files there. The words died in her throat.

Fine. At least Oliver was between them.

She buckled her own seatbelt, then helped Oliver with his. “Good boys always wear seatbelts,” she instructed. “It’s a rule. It keeps you safe.” Her tone left no room for argument.

Nathaniel silently fastened his own belt. Even Sebastian, in the driver’s seat, clicked his without a word. The car began to glide forward, heading for the amusement park.

Then Isabella spotted it. A small trash bin held a clump of crimson flowers. “Why are there flowers in here?” she asked curiously.

The air in the car instantly tightened.

Three voices answered at once.
“From a business partner.”
“An admirer sent them.”
“My school gave them to me.”

Nathaniel, Sebastian, and Oliver had all spoken. Isabella blinked, confused. Whose flowers were they? It was a simple question, so why did everything suddenly feel so awkward?

Nathaniel smoothly changed the subject. “Not important. Look what we got for you. See if you like it.” He pulled something out and handed it to her.

Isabella took it. It was a mask. Not just any mask… it was a Peppa Pig mask! “You bought this for me?” she asked, utterly surprised. What was going through Nathaniel’s mind? Was this his idea of romance?
###Chapter 79

“Isabella, it’s not wise for you to be seen in public at an amusement park,” Nathaniel’s voice came through the phone, calm but firm. “You should wear a mask.”

Isabella almost rolled her eyes. Was he serious? If anyone was at risk of being recognized, it was him and Oliver. One was known as the king of Westchester, the other its crown prince.

“Don’t worry, we’ll be wearing them too,” Nathaniel added, as if reading her mind. He produced two more masks, handing one to Oliver. The little boy’s face lit up as he eagerly put it on. Already adorable, the mask made him look impossibly sweeter.

Something felt…planned. These masks—Mama Bear, Papa Bear, and Baby Bear—were clearly a matching set. A family set. It looked suspiciously like they had been purchased in advance.

Had Nathaniel bought these before she even said yes? She was about to question him when the car glided to a smooth halt at the park’s grand entrance.

“I’ll drop you here,” Sebastian announced from the driver’s seat. “I have to pick up a friend. I’ll return for you later.”

“Understood,” Nathaniel replied smoothly. He secured his own mask, scooped Oliver into his arms, and stepped out. He held the car door open for her, a picture of effortless chivalry.

A chorus of excited squeals erupted from a group of girls nearby. “Oh my god! Look at his height! He has to be over six foot three!”

“And so gentlemanly! A man who treats his woman like that is so rare!” another sighed dreamily.

“I want a husband like that!” a woman whined, elbowing her own partner.

Still inside the car, Isabella frowned. ‘Even with half his face covered, Nathaniel causes a scene. These women are ridiculous,’ she thought, irritation prickling under her skin. Preferring anonymity, she quickly fastened her own mask before exiting the vehicle.

The three of them stood together. Nathaniel, tall and commanding, exuded a powerful, refined aura. Isabella, nearly five-foot-seven herself, carried a vibrant, energetic grace. And between them was precious Oliver, soft and cute enough to melt the hardest heart.

They became an instant spectacle. Heads turned. Whispers followed. Phones were raised, cameras clicking excitedly to capture the striking trio.

Isabella ignored it all. She had promised Oliver a fun day, and that was her only focus. She took the boy’s small hand in hers. “It’s very crowded, sweetheart. You must hold my hand or your father’s the entire time. No running off.”

“I promise, Mommy! I’ll be good!” Oliver chirped, patting his chest earnestly before clinging to her side.

Nathaniel followed a step behind, his dark eyes fixed on Isabella’s retreating form. This was his first time at an amusement park with a woman. He’d heard it was prime territory for romance.

He hoped his strategy would pay off today.

“Mommy! Look!” Oliver suddenly shrieked, pointing a chubby finger at the giant Ferris wheel dominating the skyline. “It’s huge! Can we go? Please? Oliver wants to ride it!”

“The Ferris wheel?” Isabella tried to gently dissuade him. “It’s not very exciting, darling. It just goes around slowly.”

“But it is exciting!” he insisted, stomping his little foot. “Ethan told me! He went on the carousel with his mommy and daddy. I want to go on rides with my mommy and daddy too!”

Her resistance crumbled. “Alright, alright. I heard you. Stay right here. I’ll get the tickets.”

“I’ll handle it,” Nathaniel interjected, his voice a low rumble. “You wait here with Oliver. In the shade.” His hands found her shoulders, large and sure, guiding her gently beneath the broad canopy of an oak tree.

His touch was surprisingly cool despite the summer heat. A jolt, unexpected and unwelcome, shot through her. By the time she collected herself, he was already striding toward the ticket booth.

A faint, involuntary smile touched her lips as she watched him go. The man was undeniably magnetic. Oliver peeked up at her, a secret, knowing grin spreading across his face.

Maybe Mommy didn’t dislike Daddy so much after all.

He giggled, a sound of pure joy. “Mommy, my daddy is the handsomest. He works super hard. And he’s responsible! He never lets other Aunties get close!” He puffed out his chest, imitating his father. “Daddy says a real man’s pride isn’t having lots of girls. It’s loving one person with his whole heart. Forever and ever. That’s what makes him proud.”
###Chapter 80

Isabella couldn't help but laugh at Oliver's unexpectedly mature observation. "Christopher, your attempt to matchmake me with your father is painfully transparent. Did he put you up to this?" she teased, amusement dancing in her eyes.

The little boy shook his head vigorously, his doe-like eyes wide with feigned innocence. "Daddy would never! Every word is true!"

She ruffled his hair affectionately, seeing right through his act. "I know you better than anyone. I can even guess how many cookies you've sneaked today. You're too young to come up with such lines on your own."

His lower lip trembled in protest. "But it's all real! Daddy actually said those things!"

Isabella reached beneath his mask to pinch his soft cheek playfully. "Confess now: how many women has your father sent you to charm with these smooth words?"

A deep, familiar voice spoke directly beside her ear. "Does someone finally want to know about my dating history?"

Isabella jerked her head up, nearly colliding with Nathaniel's sharp jawline. His clean, masculine scent enveloped her instantly. She stumbled backward several steps, glaring at him. "Absolutely not! I was merely teasing your son."

She snatched the tickets from his hand and marched toward the Ferris wheel, pulling Oliver along with her.

Nathaniel watched her retreating figure, a faint smile touching his lips. He had all the time in the world.

The amusement park stood as Westchester's most exclusive playground, designed specifically for the city's elite. Only five hundred privileged families held membership passes to this lavishly equipped paradise. The limited access meant remarkably short queues for all attractions.

Oliver began hopping with excitement as they approached the massive Ferris wheel. "Daddy, hurry! We're going up! This is the best day ever!"

Nathaniel joined them at the boarding platform, presenting their tickets. The attendant promptly opened the gated entrance with respectful deference. Oliver clung to both their hands, bouncing between them with unrestrained joy.

Isabella studied the boy's ecstatic expression. "Christopher, why are you so fascinated with Ferris wheels?"

She found it peculiar. Weren't spinning teacups or roller coasters more appealing to young boys? The Ferris wheel offered nothing but stationary seating and slow movement.

His eyes sparkled behind his mask. "This is my first time at any amusement park! My very first Ferris wheel ride! Look how beautiful the gondolas are!"

Beautiful? Isabella examined the minimalist design. Transparent tempered glass formed the entire structure, devoid of any decorative elements. Plush blue leather benches lined both sides of the cabin. While undoubtedly luxurious, "pretty" seemed an odd description.

As the wheel began its gradual ascent, Oliver's energetic bouncing ceased abruptly. A huge yawn escaped him. He slumped onto the seat with sudden lethargy.

"You should stand for a better view," Isabella suggested.

"I'll watch from here for now," he mumbled drowsily. "Maybe stand later."

Isabella's brows furrowed in concern. His sudden shift in energy felt strange. She settled beside him without further comment.

Nathaniel took the opposite bench, removing his mask. His strikingly handsome features seemed even more pronounced in the confined space.

Despite having seen him countless times, Isabella's breath caught. Mere meters separated them in the intimate cabin. His fresh, earthy scent filled the small space, making her heart pound erratically against her ribs.

The close proximity created palpable tension. The air thickened with unspoken possibilities.

Every slight movement felt magnified. The gentle sway of the gondola. The quiet hum of machinery. The sound of their breathing.

Oliver's head began to nod, his earlier excitement completely vanished. His small body leaned gradually toward Isabella's side.

Nathaniel's intense gaze remained fixed on her, ignoring the panoramic view unfolding outside. The city lights began to twinkle below them, painting the evening in glittering gold.

The higher they climbed, the more pronounced the silence grew. Isabella found herself acutely aware of Nathaniel's every breath, every subtle shift in posture.

Oliver's breathing deepened into sleep patterns, his masked face resting against her arm. The contrast between the sleeping child and the awake, watchful man created an oddly domestic scene.

Isabella kept her eyes trained on the window, watching Westchester transform into a miniature cityscape below. Yet her peripheral awareness remained entirely focused on the man across from her.

Nathaniel's voice broke the silence, low and intimate. "He's never been this happy with anyone else."

She refused to meet his eyes. "Children are easily amused."

"Not this one," Nathaniel countered softly. "He's particular about people."

The gondola reached its peak, suspending them high above the world. The entire city sprawled beneath them like a glittering tapestry.

Oliver stirred slightly in his sleep, mumbling incoherently. His small hand tightened around Isabella's fingers.

Nathaniel leaned forward slightly, his movement drawing her immediate attention. "He needs a mother figure."

Isabella's pulse quickened. "Many children grow up fine without one."

"Not like this," Nathaniel persisted, his voice dropping to a near whisper. "Not with this emptiness."

The gondola began its descent, the downward motion feeling strangely symbolic. Isabella remained silent, processing his words.

Oliver sighed contentedly in his sleep, snuggling closer to her side. The innocent gesture tugged at something deep within her.

Nathaniel watched the interaction, his expression unreadable yet intense. "He's chosen you, Isabella."

The use of her full name sent an unexpected shiver through her. She finally met his gaze, finding raw sincerity in those深邃 eyes.

The gondola reached the base, the attendant preparing to open the gate. Oliver woke abruptly, blinking confusion away. "Did I miss it?"

Isabella smoothed his hair gently. "You slept through the best part, sweetheart."

Nathaniel's eyes never left her face, a silent message passing between them. The attendant opened the gate, breaking the moment.

Oliver jumped up, energy miraculously restored. "Can we go again? Please?"

Nathaniel stood, offering his hand to Isabella. His palm waited, open and inviting.

The city lights reflected in his eyes, creating constellations of gold. The noise of the amusement park faded into background static.

Oliver tugged her other hand impatiently. "Please, Isabella? One more time?"

Nathaniel's hand remained extended, his gaze holding hers captive. The choice hovered between them, weighted with unspoken implications.

The Ferris wheel continued turning behind them, its cyclical motion mirroring the patterns of fate. Each rotation brought new beginnings, new possibilities.

Oliver's hopeful eyes. Nathaniel's patient hand. The lingering warmth of the gondola seat.

Isabella hesitated at the threshold, suspended between past and future. The evening air carried the scent of candy floss and destiny.

Nathaniel's fingers twitched slightly, a barely perceptible movement. "The night is still young."

Oliver bounced on his toes, his mask slightly askew. "We can try the spinning cups next! Daddy gets dizzy on those!"

A faint smile touched Nathaniel's lips. "Only when you spin too fast."

The ordinary father-son banter felt strangely endearing. Isabella found her hand moving almost involuntarily.

Her fingers brushed against Nathaniel's palm, sending electric sparks up her arm. His hand closed around hers, firm and warm.

Oliver cheered triumphantly, pulling them both toward the ticket counter. "Next ride! Next ride!"

Nathaniel kept her hand securely in his, his thumb tracing subtle circles on her skin. The simple contact felt more intimate than any embrace.

The Ferris wheel continued its endless cycles behind them, each cabin carrying its own stories, its own potential romances.

But for now, three figures moved toward new adventures, their joined hands forming an unbreakable chain under the starlit Westchester sky.
###Chapter 81

Isabella attempted to distract Oliver with conversation. He slumped against the armrest and fell asleep instantly.

The boy who’d been begging to ride the Ferris wheel was now completely conked out.

She felt tricked. She considered shaking him awake, but Nathaniel stopped her.

“Let him rest. His seizures drain all his energy.”

Nathaniel was even making excuses for him now.

Isabella sat back, saying nothing.

The Ferris wheel climbed steadily, offering a sweeping view of Westchester.

Pairs of birds swooped past the windows, setting a romantic scene.

Isabella barely glanced at the view. She focused on her phone, ignoring Nathaniel completely.

He frowned, watching her. “Ms. Montgomery, you’re missing the stunning cityscape. Staring at your screen that long strains your eyes.”

“It’s just a standard city view. Nothing special,” she replied without looking up.

His brows furrowed. Weren’t women supposed to love Ferris wheels? Why was she so uninterested?

“What does interest you, then?” he murmured.

“Drifting. Skydiving,” she answered, crossing her legs while still scrolling.

His heart jumped. Those were extreme sports he’d never tried.

The conversation died there.

As the Ferris wheel rose, other couples were cuddling or kissing. But him?

Oliver, pretending to sleep, mouthed silent words to Nathaniel. “Daddy, fifteen minutes left! Fix this! Now!”

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. He refused to waste this chance. Watching Isabella ignore him for her phone, what could he do?

Then an idea struck. He pulled out his phone and texted Sebastian after a quick wink at Oliver.

“Execute the Ferris wheel plan.”

Isabella was reviewing the Phoenix Hotel report from Maxwell. Suddenly, the carriage jolted violently. “Aah!”

Screams erupted as women clung to their partners.

Nathaniel braced to catch Isabella in the panic. But she remained perfectly calm. Instead, she pocketed her phone and shielded the sleeping Oliver on the seat.

Is she even human? He stared, stunned.

The carriage shook again.

More terrified screams followed. But Isabella stayed composed.

Nathaniel’s face fell. Is she always this unshakable? Was this all for nothing?

He never failed.

During another shake, he moved beside her. “Don’t be scared. I’m here.”

He wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her close.

“Who said I was scared?” She recoiled at his touch, startled.
###Chapter 82

“I can see you’re struggling with fear, but don’t be. I won’t make fun of you.” Nathaniel pressed his chest firmly against hers.

Their bodies were nearly fused. She was fully enveloped in his arms.

She wore a tight red dress today. Now she could feel the heat of his skin through the fabric. Her heart hammered wildly against her ribs as they pressed together.

His breath so close to her ear dragged her mind back five years.

She had been comatose, but in her haze, she remembered the feel of a man’s body. Strong. Solid. Like Nathaniel’s…

Stop it! He’s nothing like that bastard!

I will find out what happened that night.

“I’m not scared of this. Let me go or I’ll kick your head off,” Isabella threatened coldly.

“Isabella, it’s okay to be afraid. People have died on these rides before. Come here. I’ll keep you safe.” Nathaniel’s voice was low and earnest as he rubbed her shoulder.

Isabella wanted to scream.

This man is a demon. She imagined driving a knife through his arm but held back. Damn him!

The carriage jerked and swayed violently. Screams pierced the air around them.

Nathaniel’s hand slid along her spine. “Don’t be afraid… Oh, and…” He pulled out a necklace.

“This jade pendant is a Blackwood family heirloom. It wards off evil. Protects the wearer.” He fastened it around her neck as he spoke.

The necklace held a platinum crescent moon pendant. Exquisitely crafted. Detailed.

A translucent jade was set into it, engraved with the words—I Love You.

Along the inner curve of the crescent, a willow leaf seemed to float like a tiny boat.

Isabella’s expression remained neutral, but her heart slammed against her chest.

This was ELVNX’s latest couples necklace released this year. The men’s version was a sun that locked with the crescent to form a full circle.

The leaf and the sun’s ray created a heart when joined.

Sun and moon. “You and me through day and night.”

How dare he call it a family heirloom? It was an award-winning international design. A limited edition—only nine available worldwide!

Ward off evil? It was just jade.

She tried to unclasp it. It didn’t budge. “You can’t remove it. It’s a lock design.” Isabella glared.

She knew the designer of ELVNX was stubborn. Of course she knew.

The flagship necklace couldn’t be taken off once worn. It needed special tools to remove. Unlike OHLY, her own brand.

ELVNX stood for tacky romance and mutual destruction. Those who wore it were seen as loyal lovers.

He had known her for such a short time. And he gave her an ELVNX.

Bang!

The carriage plunged downward. The shaking intensified.

The violent motion threw them against each other, breathless.

Isabella lunged to shield Oliver, who was still asleep. The move threw her off balance.

She and the child tumbled to the floor.
###Chapter 83

Isabella squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact.

But she never hit the ground.

Strong arms caught her, cushioning her fall.

She landed squarely against a warm, solid chest.

A pained grunt echoed beneath her.

Nathaniel.

Her eyes fluttered open to find him sprawled beneath her, his body taking the brunt of their crash.

A crimson stain was already blooming across his shoulder, seeping through his white shirt.

"Are you hurt?" Her voice was tight as she scrambled up, Oliver clutched safely in her arms. A thread of panic she didn't recognize laced her words.

He managed a weak, pained smirk. "You're worried about me."

"Stop being ridiculous, Nathaniel! This isn't a joke!" She shot him a sharp look, her heart hammering.

"Just a scratch from the glass. It's nothing." He pushed himself up, wincing slightly, trying to downplay it for her.

Her eyes scanned his back. A shallow cut, but thankfully, nothing more serious. The rest of him seemed intact.

This Ferris wheel was a death trap. She needed to call for help immediately.

As she fumbled for her phone, the massive structure shuddered and then, inexplicably, the machinery groaned back to life.

The ride resumed its slow, creaking rotation.

What incredible timing.

"See? It's okay now. Don't be afraid." Nathaniel's voice was low, a soothing balm. He mistook her stunned silence for terror.

A warmth radiated from his tone, gentle and reassuring.

He couldn't help the flicker of satisfaction seeing her concern for him.

Oliver peeked out from her embrace, a tiny, secret smile playing on his lips. Yes! Isabella likes Nathaniel a little more now!

Finally, the ride shuddered to a complete stop at the platform.

"That's enough for today. You need to go home and tend to that wound," Isabella stated firmly, carrying Oliver out of the carriage.

"It's truly nothing. A simple bandage will suffice," Nathaniel murmured, brushing it off.

He wasn't about to let this rare opportunity slip away. This was his chance.

Isabella grimaced. "Nathaniel, be serious..."

"Then do it for Oliver. You know how much he adores you. And so do I." His words hit her with unexpected force, making her chest feel strangely full.

"Oliver needs his mommy! Oliver doesn't want to leave mommy!" The little boy's eyes instantly welled up with big, fat tears. His lower lip trembled dramatically.

"If mommy leaves Oliver... mommy might leave forever..." He looked utterly heartbroken, on the verge of a full-blown sob.

The sight wrenched her heart. How could she say no to this precious five-year-old?

"Don't cry, sweetheart. I like you very much. I'll definitely find another time to play with you, okay?" She forced the comforting words out, her resolve crumbling.

"Really? Pinky promise, mommy!" Oliver's tears vanished, replaced by a brilliant, hopeful smile as he eagerly locked his tiny pinky with hers.

What had she just done?

She had intended for this to be the final goodbye. But now, bound by a promise to Oliver, there would inevitably be a next time.

Nothing was going according to her plan.
###Chapter 84

Fine. Just this one time. She would ensure there would be no further opportunities after this.

Nathaniel and Oliver exchanged triumphant smiles. A sweet victory indeed!

Not only had he successfully given her his token of affection, but he had also secured a second date. Perfect!

Isabella was driven home with the necklace still resting around her neck. She had completely forgotten it was there.

Meanwhile, Victoria did not return home after leaving Guci Tower. Instead, she drove directly to SilverPeak Entertainment.

SilverPeak Entertainment was the world's largest entertainment conglomerate. It boasted an immense roster of A-list celebrities, singers, and supermodels. Every major artist was signed to SilverPeak or one of its subsidiaries. The company possessed the finest resources and the most talented personnel, including its PR general manager, Genevieve Beaumont.

Genevieve was a master of public relations and crisis management. She once transformed a notoriously rude celebrity, famous for her arrogance and constant boasting, into a beloved 'Savage Queen' adored by the public.

Another case involved a clumsy model with no runway skills. Genevieve rebranded her as the 'Aces Holder'. The model learned to weaponize her tears, manipulating public sympathy. Despite some backlash, her global fame skyrocketed.

“Only Genevieve can handle this. Give this to her,” instructed Gabriella, handing a meticulously wrapped gift to Victoria.

“Understood.” Victoria took the present and entered the lavish office.

“Victoria! This is a surprise. I thought you avoided this place unless absolutely necessary?” Genevieve greeted her with a sharp, amused laugh. Her presence was clearly unexpected.

The leaked nude photos had devastated Victoria's career. She lost ninety percent of her endorsements. The remaining contracts were with insignificant, low-tier brands.

Genevieve had advised a period of silence and strategic work to rebuild her image.

“I did listen to you. I attended the Guci Magazine shoot today. It was a disaster,” Victoria stated, placing the expensive gift on the desk.

It was an enormous red lipstick box containing 999 tubes of high-end lipstick. The collection included numerous top brands, some valued in the six figures.

“What’s this for?” Genevieve glanced at the box, her interest piqued.

“Victoria gave her all at the shoot. It was going perfectly. Then Isabella conspired with thieves to sabotage her photos,” Gabriella explained bitterly.

She continued, “Once this issue of Guci is published, Isabella will undoubtedly crush Victoria on her climb to the top.”

Toppling the Top Model would cement Isabella's status. She would no longer be an unknown.

Genevieve massaged her temples. She found it hard to believe one woman could be so formidably unbearable.

A calculated idea formed. “It’s just a photo. Not the end of the world,” she said calmly. “Gabriella, take Victoria to the photographers. Get several red costumes. Pose her exactly like Isabella during her shoot.”

“You mean…” Victoria tilted her head, a spark of understanding in her eyes.

“What do you think will happen if your photos are released tonight, right before the Guci magazine publication?” Genevieve’s voice was cool and precise.

Victoria understood immediately.

Releasing the photos first would steal Isabella's spotlight. When Isabella's photos were published, she would be accused of copying and plagiarism.

A brilliant strategy.

Victoria thanked her profusely. “You are the greatest PR genius! I must go now. I’ll make sure my photos are far superior to hers!”

“Go.”

Genevieve watched them leave. Her eyes were complex and unreadable, a swirling mix of countless colors and intentions.

She's a clever one. Victoria is utterly outmatched. It seems I will have to personally deal with this and bring her into the company.

Using her own methods, she located Isabella's number and placed a call.

Chapter 85

Isabella stretched out on her sofa the moment she stepped inside.
She craved quiet, but Harrison wouldn't stop pestering her with endless questions.

“Boss, when are you returning? I genuinely can’t manage the Diamond Company alone.”

“Your management team keeps calling me,” added Maxwell, the man with silver-bleached hair.
“They insist I watch over you while our debut is still on hold.
Do you have any idea how terrified I was hearing about the Ferris wheel incident today? It nearly stopped my heart.”

Harrison shot him an annoyed glare.
“Even if the boss decides to return, she should come with me first.
I’m the one who helped clean up her scandal. Wait your turn!”

“Oh, please. Know your role. That scandal began because of you. You’ve hardly made up for it!” Maxwell retorted.

Just as tensions were about to boil over, Anthony’s voice cut through.
“She’s staying here for at least three months. You both might as well accept it.”

Three months.

Harrison threw his hands up in frustration.
Handling Isabella’s past affairs while keeping up with company targets was draining.

Maxwell was equally pained.
Three months of undercover bodyguard duty—watching from the shadows, unable to openly defend her if danger struck.
He’d rather face a fight head-on if given the chance.

“Boss Montgomery, if you just want Victoria dealt with, say the word.
I’ll handle it clean. No traces left behind.”

“It’s not that simple,” Isabella said, her eyes slowly opening.
“Stay out of it. Focus on your own tasks.”

Theodore and the others still held affection for Victoria, despite her recent scandal.
Facts could be fixed, but people’s perceptions were harder to change.

Suddenly, Isabella’s phone rang.

Maxwell and Harrison exchanged curious glances.
Very few people had this number. Who could it be?

“Isabella, this is Genevieve Beaumont, PR General Manager at SilverPeak Entertainment.
I see great potential in you.
Come to my office sometime—let’s discuss signing you with us,” came the proud, commanding voice over the line.

Everyone knew Genevieve Beaumont.
Aspiring stars dreamed of her attention.

She had never personally signed a celebrity before. This was an exception, and she expected gratitude.

“SilverPeak Entertainment? Genevieve Beaumont? Who?” Isabella squinted, trying to place the name.
She glanced at the others in the room.

Each word stung. Genevieve’s face flushed with suppressed fury.
How could she not know SilverPeak or my name?

“We’re the top entertainment firm. Most A-list celebrities are with us.
Ninety percent of Best Actress awards go to our artists,” Genevieve explained, chin held high.
“You’re lucky I noticed you. I can turn you into a star.”

“Then I suppose I’ll be the ten percent,” Isabella replied flatly.

Genevieve’s irritation flared. “Isabella, don’t overestimate yourself! Money isn’t everything.
This industry isn’t easy to navigate. You need a professional team to reach the top.”
###Chapter 86

"...Look at Sophia. She had nothing when she started and was always so awkward at first. I was the one who turned her into a star..."

"Ah. So you're the one behind Sophia. Sorry to say, but I don't associate with hypocrites." Isabella ended the call.

She was well aware of how easily audiences were manipulated in this industry. Yet she constantly found herself clashing with people like Genevieve.

A respectable agency should champion genuine talent and integrity. Not fabricate personas for incompetent celebrities through lies and manipulation to deceive the public.

A new message flashed from Genevieve.

[Isabella, you should really reconsider. I can show you the true benefits and satisfaction of being with SilverPeak Entertainment!]

Isabella deleted the message without a second thought.

"Have you ever considered starting an entertainment company?" she asked Julian.

Julian was momentarily speechless. Most agents would jump at such an offer, but not him.

"Look, Isabella. I have no desire to engage in a prolonged battle with you over this. Managing one artist—you—is already more than enough trouble. Let's just drop it, alright?"

'How could Julian refuse Isabella? He's being completely unreasonable!' Maxwell and Harrison exchanged exasperated looks.

"Come on, Julian. I already have a name picked out. GoldenPhoenix Entertainment!" she insisted.

A phoenix soaring above the silver peak. It symbolized their dominance over SilverPeak. The perfect name.

It felt like agreeing was their only option. Resisting her would be risking their careers.

"Hello, you mentioned wanting to start an entertainment company before, correct? I'm in," Isabella said with determination over the phone.

"Seriously?" The man on the other end was shocked. "Finally found someone who appreciates real talent in this industry, huh?"

"This is no joke. I'm sending you the details shortly. Get it done as soon as you receive them."

Isabella sent the email immediately after hanging up. She included every objective, target, investment detail, and specification she could conceive. She added a final, crucial note at the end—to poach all the uniquely talented artists from SilverPeak Entertainment!

Julian studied her, his expression deeply concerned. "Are you absolutely certain about handing this to Adrian to manage?"

Adrian was Eleanor's nephew. Also Isabella's cousin, known for his lack of ambition and his fondness for chasing women. The family considered him a disgrace.

But Isabella remembered when she was at her lowest. Adrian was the only one who stood by her. He never believed she would cheat. That unwavering faith was why he was the only family member she maintained contact with over those five years.

Though Adrian could be infuriatingly foolish, his loyalty was absolute. He would never betray Isabella's trust. Moreover, he was bold. With proper guidance, he could actually become capable.

Isabella was a strategist. She immediately began planning the business with Adrian after Maxwell and Harrison left.

"If the company operates at a loss, you'll never see me again. But if it turns a profit, you keep ninety percent of the earnings!"

Adrian was stunned by the incredibly lucrative offer. It was a no-brainer. He was electrified, ready to launch this venture onto the world stage!

Just as Julian was preparing to leave after finalizing Isabella's schedule, a news alert made him freeze.

"Isabella! We have a major problem! The Guci photoshoot has been canceled!"

"What?!" Her face went completely blank with shock.
###Chapter 87

Exhaustion weighed heavy on Isabella's limbs after the grueling day. She craved nothing more than the oblivion of sleep. But the news Julian presented shattered any hope of rest.

He remained silent, his expression grim. He simply extended his phone toward her.

It was Victoria’s Twitter feed. A new photoshoot dominated the screen. Victoria, clad in striking crimson, mimicked Isabella’s signature poses with eerie precision.

She had even replicated the iconic cover shot from Isabella’s portfolio.

In the image, Victoria glanced over her shoulder, her gaze deliberately aloof. She sat with feigned confidence, one hand rotated forward, a shoulder dipped slightly, her head tilted. The provocative contour between her torso and arm was prominently displayed. The red dress seemed to erase any trace of her usual false modesty, presenting a calculated, dangerous image.

[Stunning!] [This red is everything!] [Victoria, you own this look!]

Comments flooded the post instantly. Media outlets and brand sponsors were already swarming.

“She’s attempting to create a sensation by copying my aesthetic.” Annoyance flickered in Isabella’s eyes.

She knew the impact of her upcoming Guci editorial would be diminished. Accusations of plagiarism would inevitably surface. A direct confrontation with Victoria now could empower Victoria’s fans to orchestrate her exile from the industry.

Julian’s worry was palpable. “This is a disaster. The Guci campaign is your second major project since your return. Its success was meant to solidify your position. The Glamorous Night Annual Dinner is next month. A triumphant Guci release could have secured you ‘The Best Artiste’. Victoria has effectively thrown a wrench into everything.”

“Relax. She won’t succeed.” A determined glint shone in Isabella’s eyes, her red lips curling into a sardonic smile.

“Where are you going at this hour?” Julian frowned as she slipped on her heels.

“This isn’t about Victoria. Don’t worry. Let’s go!” She left him standing there, consumed by suspense.

A luxury car idled in the underground parking lot. Nathaniel Blackwood sat in the passenger seat, a single earring resting in his palm. It was undoubtedly the one Isabella had lost in his car earlier. After putting Oliver to bed, he had immediately ordered Sebastian to drive him here.

Ding. “Nathaniel, look!” Sebastian exclaimed.

Isabella and Julian emerged from the elevator side by side.

Julian courteously opened the passenger door for her.

A sharp pang of something unpleasant twisted in Nathaniel’s chest. Isabella showed no reluctance around Julian. Yet, she consistently turned away from him when in his passenger seat.

“Who is he?” Nathaniel’s voice was low, his eyes glinting coldly.

“My investigations have yielded little. What I confirm is he returned from Africa with Isabella and currently manages all her professional affairs.”

Sebastian offered feeble consolation. “However, I can confirm they are not romantically involved.”

“Ah. But that describes the present, not the future, correct?”

A corrosive wave of envy washed over him, witnessing her easy, comfortable dynamic with another man.
###Chapter 88

Nathaniel would need to work much harder.

Meanwhile, Julian drove his sleek sports car toward Moon Studio.

Moon Studio was the most exclusive photography destination in Westchester, reserved for A-list celebrities and major international productions.

They were greeted immediately by Cassandra, the studio's formidable manager.

“Julian! So good to see you,” Cassandra beamed, her eyes already assessing Isabella.

“We need to use your space for a quick shoot. Hope it's not an inconvenience,” Julian said smoothly.

“None at all. Everything is at your disposal.” Cassandra’s gaze swept over Isabella with professional curiosity.

Julian led Isabella to the extensive wardrobe department.

She selected a simple avocado green dress and pulled her hair into a severe ponytail.

“I’m ready,” Isabella stated.

“No makeup? No stylist?” Julian asked, perplexed.

“No. Make me look completely average,” she instructed firmly, moving toward the plain white backdrop.

The backdrop was intentionally bland, almost clinical.

Julian couldn't comprehend her strategy. Most clients demanded glamour and perfection.

Victoria’s photos were always stunningly polished. Wasn't Isabella trying to compete?

“Is this some kind of reverse psychology move?”

“Do I look like I’m playing games?” Isabella retorted with a sharp glance.

“Just shoot it. Post them with minimal editing. You’ll understand in three days,” she added cryptically.

He knew better than to press her further. Isabella always had her reasons.

During the session, Isabella adopted deliberately casual poses.

She sat on the floor, feigned bored yawns, rested her chin on her hand.

Without makeup, her features looked ordinary. The unflattering dress made her blend into the background.

“Seriously, Isabella. You want these published?” Julian finally voiced his concern.

“Yes. Immediately. And remember, only basic edits.” She emphasized her point with a firm tap on his shoulder.

The exhausting session drained her. She hadn't pulled an all-nighter like this in ages.

Yawning repeatedly, she stepped out of the studio.

Suddenly, a black sports car screeched to a halt beside her.

The passenger door swung open, revealing a familiar muscular frame.

“What are you doing here?” Isabella asked, genuinely surprised.
###Chapter 89

Nathaniel moved closer. “I was in the neighborhood. Let me give you a ride. It’s on my way,” he offered, his voice warm and inviting as he held the car door open.

Isabella’s brow furrowed. “Aren’t you staying at The Royal Crest? I live at Rosewood Manor. That’s in the opposite direction. How is that on your way?”

A playful smirk touched his lips. “You know where I live. Seems like you’ve been keeping tabs on me.”

She scoffed, rolling her eyes. “You’re Westchester’s most eligible bachelor. Everyone knows you live in that gated fortress. Gossip follows you everywhere.”

Nathaniel’s expression sobered. He needed to be more careful about his reputation. He didn’t want her hearing anything that might push her away.

“I’m heading that direction anyway,” he insisted smoothly. “Besides, you made a promise to Christopher this afternoon. That makes us friends, doesn’t it?” He gave a slight, gentlemanly bow and gestured for her to enter the vehicle.

She hesitated, knowing she had arrived in Dominic’s Ferrari. He was likely still with Cassandra. Reluctantly, she slid into the passenger seat. A wave of satisfaction washed over Nathaniel.

The city streets were quiet, bathed in the soft glow of amber streetlights under a blanket of stars.

As they drove toward Rosewood Manor, Nathaniel’s gaze kept drifting to Isabella. The silvery moonlight caught the delicate necklace resting against her collarbones. He was surprised she still wore it. A part of him had expected her to remove it.

He wanted to talk to her, but noticed her eyes were closed. She was already asleep.

Curled on her side, she looked small and vulnerable. Her defensive daytime demeanor was gone, revealing a hidden fragility.

A pang of protectiveness shot through him. Gently, he reclined her seat so she could rest more comfortably.

He slowed the car, aiming for a smoother ride. The usual thirty-minute journey stretched to a full hour.

The car came to a stop in the underground garage of Rosewood Manor.

He cut the engine and decided not to wake her. He reached for a blanket in the back.

The moment the soft fabric touched her, Isabella jolted awake. Her eyes flashed with instant alertness. Her hand shot out, gripping his wrist with surprising strength. Her fingers were slender, yet firm.

“It’s just me,” Nathaniel said, his voice calm.

Recognition replaced the cold vigilance in her eyes, though her expression remained distant.

“Thanks for the ride.” She pushed the blanket aside and sat up.

“Aren’t you going to invite me in for…” The car door slammed shut, cutting off his sentence. Isabella was already walking away without a backward glance.
###Chapter 90

Nathaniel felt no urgency. His entire future stretched before him.

Isabella was utterly exhausted. She collapsed into bed the moment she reached home.

Her day had been relentless. A magazine shoot occupied her morning. The afternoon brought an amusement park visit.

Evening was spent establishing GoldenPhoenix Entertainment. An unexpected photoshoot capped the night.

Such a grueling schedule left her completely drained.

She switched her phone to airplane mode. Sleep claimed her instantly.

While Isabella slept deeply, Julian was tearing his hair out.

He had posted the lightly retouched photos per her instructions. The comments section erupted with criticism.

Her most devoted fans offered no support.

[Ms. Montgomery, I truly admire you. But these photos are painfully average. I can't defend them.]

[The plain white background might symbolize purity, I suppose?]

This remark silenced further discussion.

Julian felt a headache brewing. He couldn't decipher Isabella's strategy. He wanted to assist but felt utterly useless.

Watching her get torn apart online was agonizing. As her manager, he felt completely inadequate.

Cassandra handed him a glass of water. "Julian, it's one in the morning," she reminded him gently.

"Right. Sorry for keeping you," he replied.

He pocketed his phone and stood up. "Thanks for your help today. I owe you a meal."

"I'll hold you to that. Now get some rest," Cassandra said with a soft smile.

Julian turned and left.

Cassandra watched his retreating figure, her hands tightening slightly.

His politeness always carried a formal distance.

He only sought her out for work-related matters.

Long after he departed, Cassandra finally stirred. She pulled out her phone and scrolled through her contacts.

Victoria's number glowed on the screen. She hesitated.

After an internal struggle, she tossed her phone onto the couch.

She couldn't bring herself to sabotage his friend, even if that friend was her rival.

Victoria would hear from Gabriella regardless.

"Victoria, check your laptop! Look at Isabella's Twitter. Try to figure out what she's playing at."

Victoria frowned in confusion. "What's happening?"

She opened her laptop and logged into Twitter.

Gabriella explained impatiently, "She posted these bizarre photos... I can't even describe them. Just see for yourself!"

Victoria grew more puzzled. Were Isabella's photos somehow superior?

She searched for Isabella's profile. The underwhelming images made her frown.

The entire internet mocked the mediocre shots. They weren't terrible, just utterly forgettable. Isabella looked like any ordinary passerby.

The contrast made Victoria's red dress photoshoot shine brighter. Netizens praised her to the heavens.

"What is Isabella trying to pull?" Victoria wondered aloud.

"Who knows? Has she lost her mind? She should be competing with better work or attacking you. Instead, she posts this blandness?" Gabriella sounded equally confused.

Victoria studied the photos again. She still couldn't discern any strategy.

A deep sense of foreboding settled in her stomach. Something terrible felt imminent.
###Chapter 91

Victoria feared this might push Isabella over the edge.

She attempted reassurance. “Don’t stress, Tiff. Think about it—Isabella has no agency backing, no professional team, and definitely no retoucher. Those photos are her own undoing. You’ll dominate the Guci editorial. Winning your third Top Model will cement your legacy.”

“I hope you’re right…”

Victoria’s nerves were still frayed. “Stay vigilant. Watch Isabella closely. Report anything unusual to me immediately.”

“Of course.”

She ended the call, her expression tense. Anxiety gnawed at her.

Victoria knew Isabella too well. Every move was calculated. There had to be a reason behind those photos.

She couldn’t decipher the motive. Eliminating Isabella from the industry was the only safe move.

Her eyes hardened with resolve. She quickly dialed Alexander.

His voice, deep and smooth, answered. “Victoria, you’re up early.”

“I had a nightmare. You reconciled with my sister and abandoned me.” Her tone was laced with feigned distress.

Alexander soothed her. “Silly, I’d never choose someone so arrogant. You’re the only one for me, my darling.”

“Thank you, Alexander. I needed to hear that.” Her voice softened. “What’s your plan for Isabella? Is she testing you?”

He scoffed. “A woman who’s had an abortion playing the innocent? Please. I’m securing the diamond mine and her shares first. The paperwork is priority.”

Disgust dripped from his words.

Victoria murmured agreement. “Hurry and lock her down before some fortune hunter swoops in. At least we’re family. We won’t harm her unless forced.”

“I’ll handle it.” Alexander hung up, his lips curling in contempt.

Suitors for that ice queen? They must be desperate.

Victoria was right. The assets needed securing immediately.

Once married, Isabella would be powerless. A docile housewife entirely under their control.

He called Harrison. “Get the Jade Palace breakfast special. Meet me at Rosewood Manor’s underground parking.”

At Rosewood Manor, Isabella was jolted awake by the landline.

She ignored it, but the relentless ringing shattered her sleep.

Grudgingly, she answered. “What is it?” She stifled a yawn.

Maxwell’s concerned voice filled the line. “Boss Montgomery, did you really post those photos? The entire internet is mocking you. They’re calling you a fraud. A ninety-nine layers of makeup phony.”
###Chapter 92

The Guci editorial face-off is happening in forty-eight hours. Why aren't you making a move? I’m ready to assist you with anything, anytime. I guarantee I can capture your photos a thousand times better.

Isabella stretched lazily. Is that the only reason you called me at this hour?

Absolutely! We’re furious on your behalf. You’re stunning—those internet trolls have no right to judge you. You’re our boss, the one and only. No one gets to tear you down like that! Maxwell’s voice vibrated with anger.

Isabella remained unbothered, rubbing her eyes calmly. I spoke with Julian Hawthorne yesterday. This was my plan all along. I know what I’m doing. You’ll understand my strategy during the editorial. Relay this to the team: do not interfere. Stop worrying.

She ended the call without another word.

Sleep was now impossible. She reached for her phone and opened her social media apps.

Twitter had exploded overnight.

Whether Victoria had orchestrated it or not, countless users had joined the hate train. Many even posted Victoria’s photos with mocking captions.

[Look at Victoria’s elegance, Isabella. She outshines you in every way.]

[Quit selling diamonds and fix your appearance. You’re a disaster!]

[Was Chanel your peak? Or were you using a stand-in?]

[Have some professional dignity. These photos are an insult to the industry.]

[I can’t believe Guci chose you as an ambassador. They must be blind.]

Every comment was drenched in venom.

#WhatHappenedToIsabella was now the top trending topic.

Isabella sank into the sofa, a sly smile curling her crimson lips.

Everything was unfolding exactly as she envisioned.

Let’s see how long Victoria and her fans can keep their arrogance intact.

The doorbell chimed.

Who could that be?

Isabella padded to the door and checked the peephole. Alexander Whitmore stood there, impeccably dressed and radiating confidence.

Her mind flashed back to last night’s events.

Alexander had faced a minor crisis during a live stream featuring Luwak coffee and bean grinding. His quick thinking had turned it into a triumph, earning praise from viewers and business leaders alike.

His looks were undeniable—the epitome of a charismatic CEO. Every gesture was photogenic, sending fans into a frenzy.

Within twenty-four hours, Alexander’s images had flooded the internet. Fans were begging him to quit his CEO role and become an actor.

Isabella scoffed. He had just resolved a crisis, and now he was here to flaunt it?

She had zero interest in dealing with him. She turned away and lounged back on the sofa.

Alexander was persistent. The doorbell rang again and again.

Giving up wasn’t in his nature.

He was determined to make Isabella submit to him, just like she used to.
###Chapter 93

The doorbell wouldn't stop ringing.

Isabella gritted her teeth in irritation.

She glared at the bathtub she had just stepped out of.

An idea sparked in her mind.

She swung the door open forcefully.

Alexander stood there, his expression impatient at first.

Then his eyes widened in shock.

She wore a delicate white sundress that clung to her frame.

The fabric highlighted her long, toned legs.

Fine silk complemented her radiant complexion.

She embodied every man's fantasy.

"Isabella, you..." He was stunned by her transformation in just five years.

He wanted to demand why she kept him waiting.

But his words were cut short.

Splash! A full bucket of water drenched him completely.

"What the hell!" His face darkened instantly.

"Can't you see? I was just emptying my bathwater." She tossed the bucket aside casually.

She brushed her hands together dismissively.

"You did that intentionally! I brought you breakfast! I waited in line for hours!"

"Do I look like I care? Yes, it was deliberate. Want to hit me?" She leaned against the doorframe lazily.

Alexander seethed with anger.

He wanted to strangle her but held himself back.

"I know you're still angry about five years ago. It was my mistake. Let me make it up to you."

"You rejected my flowers. That's why I brought breakfast. Can't you see my effort?"

Isabella let out a cold, hollow laugh.

"Sincerity? I thought you were heartless all along. Now you disgust me even more."

"Look at yourself reeking of cheap perfume. How many women have you been with?"

"Clean yourself up before spreading your filth to others."

Her words cut deeper than any blade.

"Enough! You shameless woman! Have you seen what people say online?"

"You're not even half the woman Victoria is!" He grabbed her wrist roughly.

He had never been humiliated like this before.

"You're just a washed-up actress who had an abortion! No one wants you except me!"

Isabella prepared to retaliate when a deep voice interrupted.

"Who said no one wants her?" Nathaniel approached with commanding presence.

Sunlight outlined his powerful physique.

He radiated authority and magnetism.

Four suited bodyguards followed closely behind.

He moved like royalty inspecting his domain.

Alexander stared in disbelief. "Mr. Blackwood? Why are you here?"

Nathaniel ignored him completely.

His attention focused entirely on Isabella.

She captivated him instantly.

The simple white sundress accentuated her curves perfectly.

Her golden hair cascaded over her shoulders as she leaned against the door.

She looked both innocent and dangerously alluring.
###Chapter 94

How dare she wear something so provocative in front of another man?

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened with displeasure. He stepped forward, shoving Alexander aside, and shielded Isabella with his own body.

Isabella flushed with embarrassment at his possessive display in front of others.

Before she could speak, Nathaniel pulled her firmly against his chest. He glared at Alexander, his voice cold and threatening. “She belongs to me. If I catch you near her again, your entire family will be exiled from Westchester.”

Alexander stared, stunned. The threat echoed in his mind.

‘Isabella is with Nathaniel Blackwood? He’s willing to go this far to protect her?’

Nathaniel turned sharply to the four men he had brought. “What are you waiting for? Introduce yourselves.”

The command snapped them to attention. They bowed in unison.

“Good morning, Ms. Montgomery. I am Marguerite Dubois, head chef of a three-Michelin-star restaurant in Paris. I will be preparing your breakfast today.”

“A pleasure, Ms. Montgomery. I am Philippe Moreau, executive chef from Le Grand Mariner. I will be assisting as sous chef.”

“Greetings, Ms. Montgomery. I am…”

Alexander was speechless. These were world-renowned chefs, each commanding six-figure fees. Nathaniel had hired them all just to make Isabella breakfast.

His earlier boast—'no one will treat you better than me’—now seemed pathetic.

Isabella was equally shocked.

‘Did he bring this entire team just to defend me? How much money did he spend?’

While she was still processing it, Nathaniel spoke softly to her. “Tell them whatever you’d like to eat. They will make it for you.”

Then he turned his icy gaze back to Alexander. “Are you leaving on your own, or shall I have you escorted out?”

Alexander paled. He knew better than to test Nathaniel’s patience.

“My apologies. I didn’t realize she was yours. I’ll take my leave immediately.”

He retreated quickly, his expression grim.

He couldn’t comprehend it. How did a woman as arrogant and damaged as Isabella win Nathaniel’s devotion?

So that was why she rejected him—she was already with Nathaniel Blackwood.

What made her so special?

His assistant walked beside him, voice tense with worry. “What do we do now? If they’re together, we’ll never get the diamond mine or the shares. And with the competition between Isabella and Victoria coming up… if Nathaniel helps her, Victoria doesn’t stand a chance.”

Alexander’s mood soured further.

‘Victoria has the full support of the Montgomery family. But Isabella… she’s clearly using Nathaniel to crush us both. I can’t let her win.’

He looked at his assistant, his eyes cold and decisive. “Send the photos from my e-drive to the media. Now.”
###Chapter 95 
The four chefs began preparing breakfast in the kitchen moments after Alexander departed the estate.

Nathaniel seized Isabella’s waist, pulling her firmly against him as he swept inside and shut the door.

Isabella was bewildered.

She had assumed he’d overheard their exchange. Yet he behaved as though nothing occurred.

‘Maybe he truly didn’t hear,’ she reasoned, forcing herself to dismiss it.

“Thank you for your assistance earlier. You may dismiss the chefs now.” She stepped out of his embrace, her tone detached.

“Did I say I came to help you?” he replied smoothly.

Isabella stiffened. If not to help, then why was he here?

“I hired these chefs to prepare your breakfast. Helping you humiliate that woman was merely a fortunate coincidence,” Nathaniel stated, a smirk playing on his lips. “If you’re so grateful, I wouldn’t refuse you offering yourself to me.”

She glared, utterly speechless at his arrogance.

As she moved to remove the outfit he’d lent her, he taunted, “Undressing in front of me? Trying to tempt me, Isabella?”

Fury ignited within her.

“Just wait,” she snapped, storming back into the mansion to change.

She reappeared moments later wearing a simple chiffon blouse and fitted jeans.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened.

He hadn’t expected such casual attire to look so provocatively alluring on her. The jeans elongated her legs and accentuated her curves perfectly.

For the first time, a possessive desire to keep her hidden from the world surged through him. It vanished when she thrust his coat back at him.

“I don’t need your favors. Keep your kindness to yourself. I dislike owing people,” she stated, her voice icy and flat.

Nathaniel’s heart clenched. He loved her deeply, yet she only ever pushed him away. “I choose to be good to you. You owe me nothing. If you must, then simply reciprocate my efforts.”

“Nathaniel, how can you say that? I’ve rejected you from the very beginning,” Isabella retorted sharply.

“You have every right to refuse me. And I have every right to pursue you. I endure the pain of your rejection. Can’t you tolerate my pursuit in return?” he declared, his confidence making him sound like the wounded party.

Exasperated, Isabella chose to ignore him.

She sank onto the sofa and announced coldly, “Do whatever you want. I won’t be eating that breakfast.”

Nathaniel was irritated, questioning the strength of her resolve.

The four chefs presented the lavish spread. Seagull egg fried sandwiches paired with Scottish lobster and crab, garnished with exquisite truffles. Fried spaghetti with sirloin steak, drizzled with a rare caviar sauce.

It was an opulent, extravagant feast.

The rich, fresh scent of milk wafted through the air as it was poured from its carton.
###Chapter 96

The four men finished serving the meal and quietly exited the room.

Nathaniel's voice broke the silence. "Ms. Montgomery, your breakfast is ready."

"I'm not eating," Isabella stated firmly. "Nothing you say will change my mind. You should give up now." She needed to maintain her resolve, to force Nathaniel to back down.

Suddenly, a sweet, high-pitched voice echoed from the hallway. "Mommy! Mommy!" Little Oliver came running into the room, his small body wobbling with each step. He leaped directly into Isabella's waiting arms.

Isabella frowned slightly. "Ollie, what are you doing here?"

"Ollie woke up and Daddy was gone," the child explained, his voice trembling. "I heard Daddy was coming to see you, so I came too." His chubby fingers tightened around her sleeve.

His lower lip began to quiver. "Wah... Ollie's so hungry. Haven't eaten all day. My tummy's making noises." He rubbed his stomach dramatically. "Grrr, grrr, grrr."

"Oh, sweetheart, why didn't you eat before leaving?" Isabella scooped him up and carried him to the dining table. "Luckily there's breakfast here."

Oliver clung to her hand desperately. "I want Mommy to eat with me!"

"I'm sorry, baby. Mommy isn't hungry right now." She gently stroked his soft hair. "You'll have to eat by yourself."

He tugged insistently on her hand, pulling her toward the chair. He placed a breakfast setting in front of her and looked up with pleading eyes. "Please, Mommy? Ollie's five years old but never had breakfast with Mommy before. I just want to know what it feels like. Please? Just this once?"

His round, sparkling eyes gazed up at her hopefully. How could she possibly refuse such a heartfelt request?

"Alright," she relented.

Just like that, Isabella found herself having breakfast with Oliver. Nathaniel watched the scene unfold, a slow smile spreading across his face. His secret weapon had worked perfectly. Now he could move forward with his real plan.

He pulled out his phone, pretending to scroll through messages. Instead, he opened the camera and began taking photos of Isabella from across the room. Her profile was turned toward him, showcasing her exquisite features and stunning figure. Her hair flowed freely in the morning light, creating an aura of effortless beauty. Every casual shot looked like a professional masterpiece. Her beauty was truly captivating.

He experimented with different angles—close-ups, wide shots, various compositions. Within minutes, he had captured nearly a dozen perfect images. Scrolling through the gallery, his eyes filled with admiration and desire.

He immediately sent the photos to Dominic.

[Absolutely flawless. Found perfection.]

Dominic's reply came instantly. [Indeed.]

Suddenly, a hand snatched the phone from his grasp. Nathaniel scowled. "Isabella..."

How had she moved so quietly? How had he not noticed her approach?

She typed a response to Dominic using his phone.

[No need to return.]

She simultaneously deleted all the photos and cleared the entire gallery.

Nathaniel tried to explain. "Isabella, I'm trying to help you. My company has professional retouchers who can turn this situation around."

"Thank you for your concern," she replied coolly. "But I don't need help turning anything around. You're the esteemed head of the Blackwood family—do you really think I require assistance?"

She handed the phone back to him gently.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed deeply. Her tone suggested she thought him foolish. Given the current internet frenzy surrounding her, how could she not need damage control?
###Chapter 97

Isabella clearly had no intention of continuing the conversation. She spoke with grave finality. “Take Oliver home. I stayed up far too late last night and desperately need to catch up on sleep.” With that declaration, she moved toward her bedroom.

As she passed Nathaniel, she paused, unable to resist one more attempt. “Christopher, please be good for me. Look, see these dark circles? I truly need to rest. Will you be a good boy and go home now?”

“Okay! I’ll listen to Mommy!” Oliver’s immediate agreement was unexpected. He even gathered the dishes and headed for the kitchen. “Sleep as long as you need, Mommy. Daddy and I will clean up and then we’ll leave. I promise we won’t disturb you.”

Isabella’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. Since when had her son become so remarkably compliant?

Nathaniel was equally perplexed but chose not to question it. He turned to her. “Get some rest. We’ll handle this and then go.” He followed Oliver into the kitchen to help with the washing up.

She watched their retreating figures—one tall and commanding, the other small and earnest. A wave of unexpected, long-forgotten domestic warmth washed over her, emanating from the kitchen. It was a feeling she hadn’t experienced in five long years.

She entered her room and lay down on the bed. Staring at the ceiling, an unwanted memory from half a decade ago forced its way to the surface.

Five years ago. Alexander Whitmore had invited her to The Grand Monarch, promising a surprise. But the first person she encountered there was Victoria Kensington. After sharing a single glass of wine with her, everything went black.

She awoke later in a bed at The Ritz-Carlton. Her virginity was gone. Alexander was lying beside her. For a long time, she truly believed she had given herself to him that night. She only discovered much later it was all part of Victoria’s vicious trap.

All these years, she had fought hard to bury the memory, to stop herself from dwelling on it. But recently, the resentment toward the unknown man in that bed had grown sharper. If not for him, she would never have been disgraced. Perhaps she wouldn’t feel such deep-seated resistance and wariness toward men’s advances. A man who would take advantage of an unconscious woman was no good man.

The soft click of the front door closing echoed from the living room. Isabella pulled herself from her dark thoughts. She reached for her phone and sent a swift text to Maxwell. “Dig deeper into what happened five years ago. Leave no stone unturned.”

“Understood.”

Outside, Nathaniel had paid no real attention to Alexander’s earlier words. Once they were clear of Rosewood Manor, he looked down at his son. “Why were you so unusually obedient back there?”

“Daddy, couldn’t you see Mommy was really angry with you?” Oliver replied matter-of-factly. “Besides, you didn’t have a good answer for her. She definitely thinks you’re being stupid. The more you talk, the more mistakes you make. Sometimes, it’s best to just do nothing.”

Nathaniel coughed, slightly affronted. Even his young son could see that Isabella thought him a fool?

Oliver offered more advice. “I think you need to figure out why Mommy released those photos herself. And why she refused your help. Everyone is mocking her now. If you can understand her real reasons and support her properly, you’ll stand out to her.”

Nathaniel carried Oliver to the car. As he drove, he pondered deeply. Isabella’s Guci photo should have been enough to utterly destroy Victoria’s. It should have doubled the sales. No one could have predicted the scandal that erupted instead.

His mind suddenly locked onto a single, crucial word: ‘sales’. His eyes narrowed, a new and chilling understanding dawning.
###Chapter 98

“That’s it! So this was Isabella’s real plan all along. Isabella Montgomery is truly one of a kind. To win using what looks like a losing strategy… That’s brilliant.”

Nathaniel pulled his car over to the side of the road. He took out his phone and sent a message.

[I look forward to witnessing your stunning underdog victory the day after tomorrow. When you win, I’ll have a special congratulatory gift prepared just for you.]

Isabella was lounging on her bed, scrolling through her phone. Her close friends were blowing up her WhatsApp, all trying to help her stage a comeback. A few were still begging her to just drop out of the dangerous game entirely.

Genevieve sent a flood of messages.

[Isabella, have you seen the public opinion online? Do you understand the influence SilverPeak Entertainment holds? Everyone is praising Victoria and tearing your photos to shreds. Your dream of starting your own online business is over before it began.]

[If you sign with SilverPeak, I promise I will make you a bigger star than Victoria Kensington. Furthermore, we can help you resolve this precarious situation you’re in. As for profit sharing, we can negotiate that later. No one else can save you but me!]

Isabella’s red lips curled in disgust. She couldn’t be bothered to reply. “There’s no point engaging with narcissists. The only way to deal with them is to crush them with sheer competence.” The real battle was the day after tomorrow. She would teach them all a lesson. She would show them what true talent and skill actually looked like.

Then, her agent Julian texted her.

[Isabella, what in the world are you thinking? The day after tomorrow is the final day.]

Isabella frowned slightly and typed a reply.

[I really wish I could tell you the plan, but the stakes are too high. Until this is over, it has to remain a secret. I’m sorry, but I can’t risk telling anyone right now.]

[Just remember one thing. I, Isabella Montgomery, would never do anything to truly jeopardize myself. All you need to do is wait calmly. Everything will be fine. If you absolutely must do something, go hire some internet trolls. Pay them to attack my photos even more viciously. The more venom they spew, the better.]

Julian had no response. Hadn’t her reputation suffered enough already? Even though he believed in Isabella’s abilities, the current situation seemed hopeless. How could she possibly turn this around? Oh well. Isabella was a willful woman. Even if she failed, she could always just retire and manage her diamond mines. Three hundred million tons of raw diamonds was a solid backup plan. He decided to stop worrying.

After sending her message, Isabella let out a soft sigh. She couldn’t believe no one had seen through her ruse. ‘What about the big boss?’ she wondered. As she sighed, a new WhatsApp notification popped up.

[I look forward to witnessing your stunning underdog victory the day after tomorrow. When you win, I’ll have a special congratulatory gift prepared just for you.]

Isabella’s brow furrowed. Nathaniel had actually figured out her master plan. Was it because of what she’d said earlier? Had she given herself away? It turned out he wasn’t as foolish as she’d thought.

She began typing a reply. But she’d only managed a few words before a memory from five years ago surfaced.

Five years ago, she lost her virginity. She got pregnant. She suffered a miscarriage…

The current trajectory of her relationships with Nathaniel and Oliver felt like a bad omen.

She thought for a long moment. Then, she slowly deleted everything she had just written. She tossed her phone aside and closed her eyes. Nathaniel was treating her so well. What would she have to do to make him give up on her? Should she tell him what happened five years ago?
###Chapter 99

Isabella Montgomery spent the entire day consumed by her thoughts.

Five years had passed since she forged her iron-willed persona.

Yet now, hesitation and confusion clouded her mind.

She switched her phone to airplane mode.

Collapsing onto her bed, she sank into quiet contemplation.

Meanwhile, Alexander Whitmore left Rosewood Manor with purpose.

He immediately summoned his personal assistant, Harrison Caldwell.

"Release the photos," Alexander commanded without hesitation.

Harrison nodded and executed the order precisely.

A flood of Isabella's old photographs instantly flooded the internet.

These images captured her most awkward teenage years.

Junior high Isabella sported outrageous, non-mainstream fashion.

Her hair stood in edgy, spiky formations.

Heavy eye makeup dominated her youthful face.

High school brought a gold-worshipper phase.

Every outfit shimmered with excessive sparkle and shine.

Her fashion choices were painfully unfashionable.

The photos revealed a perpetually hunched posture.

Helplessness radiated from her plain features.

One particularly damning image showed her crawling on all fours.

She had lost a bet to some society ladies.

The internet erupted within hours.

"ISABELLA MONTGOMERY'S PLASTIC SURGERY EXPOSED" trended nationwide.

"ISABELLA CRAWLING LIKE A DOG" followed closely behind.

Online commentary turned vicious and relentless.

[No wonder her photoshoots looked so mediocre! Her real face is nothing special!]

[I can't believe how ugly she used to be! Definitely went under the knife!]

[Plastic surgery! Everything about her is fake! I regret ever supporting her!]

[She acts so high and mighty now? Remember when she crawled like a dog?]

[Fake face, fake fashionista persona. What's even real about her?]

[Those leaked photos are her real face? So disgustingly ugly!]

Isabella's carefully built reputation crumbled overnight.

Her fanbase hemorrhaged followers by the thousands.

Chanel's sales plummeted following her endorsement controversy.

Victoria Kensington watched the chaos unfold with pure delight.

Tomorrow's showdown would be an effortless victory.

With Isabella's reputation in ruins, competition became impossible.

How could Anthony continue favoring such a disgraced woman?

Victoria texted her manager, Isadora Vasquez, immediately.

[Spare no expense. Keep these photos circulating until after the showdown.]

Deep in the night, loud pounding echoed through Rosewood Manor.

Isabella stirred from her troubled sleep.

She had been wrestling with her feelings for Nathaniel.

The relentless knocking pulled her from bed.

She stumbled toward the door in a groggy haze.

Her agent, Julian Hawthorne, burst inside anxiously.

His face was tight with concern as he took in her disheveled state.

"Another disaster happened while you slept," he announced urgently.

He thrust his smartphone into her hands.

The screen glowed with endless hate comments.

Her past photos spread across every social media platform.

Netizens now branded her an ugly, plastic surgery fraud.

Isabella's eyelids fluttered slightly.

A cold sneer twisted her lips.

Alexander had taken these photos during her foolish pursuit.

He called them precious memories of their time together.

Now he wielded them as weapons to destroy her.

Julian studied her silent reaction solemnly.

"Finally feeling scared? Having regrets?" he pressed.

"Regrets?"

Isabella straightened her posture.

A beautiful, chilling smile curved her red lips.
###Chapter 100

“They’re just a mob feeling sorry for that worthless man. They got carried away. As for the photos, don’t worry about them right now.”

“Don’t worry?” Julian questioned her with a deep frown.

Isabella nodded. “Exactly. Let the keyboard warriors keep attacking me. The more they do, the better. It’ll make the final reveal in two days even more satisfying.”

Julian’s expression tightened. “I’m your agent. You need to tell me your plan. I can’t do my job if this spirals out of control.”

“You’re smarter than this. Think about it. ‘The darkest hour is just before the dawn.’ Since Victoria and Alexander are behind the photo leak, I will make sure they regret it deeply,” Isabella stated with unshakable confidence.

Julian remained uneasy. He understood the saying, but Isabella’s reputation was in ruins. How could she possibly recover? Her Gucci editorial, though stunning, would be accused of plagiarizing Victoria’s the moment it launched. ‘How can she come back from this?’ he wondered. With the ‘ugly photo’ scandal, her career seemed doomed.

Seeing his concern, Isabella gently patted his shoulder. “Relax. I promise I will win the showdown. If I lose, I’ll leave the fashion world forever. I’ll manage the diamond business and never seek revenge again. Is that good enough for you?”

Julian knew her well. Revenge had always been her driving force. For her to bet that on this outcome meant she was utterly confident. How could she still win under these circumstances?

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Corporation, Oliver clung to Nathaniel’s hand. “Daddy, the things they’re saying about Mommy online are horrible. If this continues, she’ll lose the Gucci editorial. You have to help her!” Oliver’s voice was filled with worry, nearly trembling.

Nathaniel remained calm. He gently ruffled his son’s hair. “Don’t worry. Remember what Mommy said? This is all part of her plan. We’ll have a great show to watch in two days.”

“Really? Are you sure?” Oliver looked at his father with suspicion.

Sebastian, napping in the corner, overheard and perked up. “A show? What kind of show?”

Nathaniel smiled mysteriously. “It’s a secret.”

Oliver and Sebastian fell silent. They knew Nathaniel’s stubborn nature. If he wouldn’t talk, nothing could make him. They could only wait impatiently for the showdown.

Over the next two days, Isabella’s ‘ugly photos’ spread like wildfire across the internet, remaining a top search topic. ‘Ugly as Isabella’ became a popular insult. Everyone waited for a statement from her, but she had vanished without a trace.

Finally, the day of the Gucci editorial showdown arrived. Despite the scandal, the magazines were printed and ready for sale. If Isabella’s Avocado Green collection sold well, it might mitigate some of the damage. In the entertainment world, any publicity was good publicity. The worst fate was obscurity.

At dawn, Gucci released both Isabella and Victoria’s photo editorials. They launched the sales for both collections simultaneously.

The epic battle between Isabella and Victoria had officially begun!
###Chapter 101

The editorial photos dropped.

Fans who had been waiting flooded in immediately.

Their reactions were instant. Shock. Awe. Disbelief.

(Is that even Isabella Montgomery? She’s radiant! Absolutely breathtaking!)

(Hello? Did we forget she’s a surgery doll? It’s all filters and makeup. Nothing is real!)

(Seriously! Look at her old pictures. They’re so plain and mediocre! Such a drastic change can't be natural.)

(Now look at our queen, Victoria Kensington. Her aura might be subtle, but her beauty is goddess-level, authentic!)

(The Sage Green line is the star here. Support our Vicky! Buying ten sets right now!)

(Yes! Boycott the Crimson line. Don’t support that plastic surgery monster, Isabella!)

(Get the fake out of the endorsement world! She’s an embarrassment to high fashion!)

The online hate for Isabella intensified.

Sales for the Sage Green collection climbed steadily.

The Crimson line, however, saw almost no movement.

People liked the designs, but buying it felt like endorsing a fraud. How could they support her?

By 1 PM, only a handful of Crimson items had sold. The numbers were dismal.

Eric, now Julian Hawthorne, and Kay, now Maxwell Carter, monitored the traffic. They waited. They knew Isabella had a plan. A comeback was coming.

At the Blackwood Corporation, Nial, now Sebastian Blackwood, held Chris, now Oliver Blackwood, close. His eyes were glued to his phone. Anxiety spiked.

This was it.

Isabella was making her move.

A special alert blasted across social media.

Breaking: Isabella Montgomery has a new official account!

Everyone scrambled for their phones. Even Anthony, now Nathaniel Blackwood, paused his work to look.

Her profile bio read: ‘A background character in a past life. Find your true power in Crimson. Unlock your star potential. Transformation starts with Red. Live your main character story.’

Below it, a gallery of photos. A video.

The video showed Isabella in a home gym.

She wore a crimson sports bra and matching leggings.

The vibrant red against her porcelain skin was striking. Breathtaking.

She punched a sandbag. Again. Again. Sweat glistened on her skin.

Her face was bare. No makeup. Yet, she was stunning.

The photos were comparisons.

One side: Sage Green. The other: Crimson.

An old, "ugly" photo next to a styled Guci crimson shot.

A side-by-side with Victoria Kensington in Sage Green versus Isabella in Crimson.

Every single comparison was night and day.

In every frame, the Crimson version won. It was undeniable.

Isabella’s new account exploded.

Thousands of supporters, real people and netizens, rallied behind her.

They clashed with Victoria’s fans, shifting the online narrative.

(Her workout face is so fresh and natural! Zero makeup! Zero surgery!)

(Isabella is devastatingly beautiful in Crimson!)

(Did they pick Sage Green to make people look bad? Even a beauty like Isabella looks washed out in it.)

(True! In the group photo, the Sage Green makes her fade into the background. I barely saw her!)

(What a shame. It can make a supermodel and a diamond CEO look average. Avoid it! I’m steering clear.)

(I love her bio: Find your true power in Crimson!)

(Yes! I want to buy the Crimson line! I want to live my main character story! No more being a side character.)

The tide turned instantly.

The side-by-side comparisons were too powerful. The evidence was clear.

Whether it was Isabella or top model Victoria Kensington, Crimson was superior. It was the color of victory.
###Chapter 102

Ruby Red could transform your entire look instantly. It made you impossible to ignore.

Avocado Green was fresh, but it was a background color. It was meant for blending in, not standing out.

Most people wouldn't spend a fortune just to be noticed. But Guci's clientele was different. They were the elite. Movie stars. Socialites. Tycoons. These women were used to being the center of attention. They never settled for second best.

So the sales shift was dramatic. Avocado Green's early lead vanished. It was completely obliterated by the massive surge in Ruby Red orders. The numbers weren't even close. Ruby Red outsold it by more than ten to one.

Julian Hawthorne and his team were stunned. So was Genevieve Beaumont, who had been waiting for Isabella's downfall. No one saw this masterstroke coming. Isabella had orchestrated it all. She let those "unflattering" photos leak. She didn't suppress them. She amplified them. It was all a setup for her grand reveal. The stunning Ruby Red photos were her knockout punch.

Everyone forgot the real competition wasn't about beauty or popularity. It was about sales. Those "ugly" pictures were Isabella's secret weapon all along.

Over at Blackwood Corporation, Oliver was ecstatic. "Yes! Mommy is a genius! She's the smartest! I want to be just like her!"

"That's not all," Nathaniel stated coolly. He pulled out his phone and called Dominic Sterling. "Transfer fifty million. Use it to boost Isabella's campaign. Flood every platform with her Twitter post," he commanded. He wanted her message seen by the entire world.

With a fifty-million-dollar push, Isabella's face was everywhere. Her caption was analyzed, shared, and memed. People scrutinized the photos. Her features were the same. The transformation was in the color. The Ruby Red collection, combined with the right makeup, created pure magic. It was alchemy.

Even those who never used Twitter were suddenly craving red. Ruby Red became the undisputed color of the season. All because of Isabella Montgomery. Her caption—"Embrace the red. Unleash your inner success. Live your life like the star you are!"—became a viral sensation. Businesses adopted it. It inspired a generation of young women. Her comeback was legendary.

Meanwhile, at a private SJAQ atelier, Victoria was being fitted. She stood in a dazzling blue gown that shimmered like a galaxy. A circle of socialites showered her with praise.

"Absolutely breathtaking!"

"Victoria, you must wear this to accept your award. You'll break the internet! All the headlines will be yours!"

Victoria smiled, basking in the adoration. "Oh, stop it, you're too kind," she demurred, feigning humility. "Nothing is guaranteed yet."

"Who else could possibly win? In our world, you're untouchable," one heiress insisted.

"Besides, you've definitely won the Guci face-off! You're a shoo-in for the 'Most Valuable Commercial Model Award' now!" another added.

The 'Most Valuable Commercial Model Award' carried immense weight. It wasn't just prestige; it was pure commercial power. The winner was guaranteed a flood of lucrative endorsements. Brands always chose the MVCM over the Top Supermodel. It meant business.

Last year, Arabella Fontaine won it. This year…

A triumphant smile played on Victoria's lips. She didn't need to say anything. She carried herself with the haughty grace of a victor.

Suddenly, her agent, Isadora, burst into the room. Her face was pale. "Victoria! It's a disaster! Something terrible has happened!"
###Chapter 103

Victoria Kensington was clearly upset, but they were in a public place. Throwing a tantrum would ruin her image. She forced a sweet smile. "What's going on, Isadora? Take your time and explain."

Isadora Vasquez felt all eyes on them. She understood why Victoria was being so polite. For a moment, she was speechless. One of the socialites seemed to guess the news. "It can't be," the woman probed. "Did Victoria lose the competition?"

"That's impossible," another heiress exclaimed. "She practically had it in the bag. How could she lose?" The crowd gathered closer. They began pulling out their phones to check the news.

The complexions of the socialites instantly paled. Victoria sensed the shift. She snatched the phone from Isadora's hand. Her eyes scanned the headlines. The entire internet was obsessed with Isabella Montgomery's new tagline and platform. Furthermore, Isabella's endorsed fashion line, 'Midnight Iris,' had completely sold out.

In stark contrast, the sales of Victoria's 'Crimson Blush' collection were minuscule. Only a hundred sets were purchased by her most loyal fans. It was a total defeat. Her expression said it all. The onlookers immediately began making excuses.

"Victoria, we just remembered something urgent. We have to go. We'll catch up later." They scurried away like frightened mice.

From a distance, a low voice carried over. "Hmph. She was trying on gowns way too early. Did she really think she'd win this year's prize? Someone finally put her in her place!"

Rage consumed Victoria. Her palms curled into tight fists. Her jaw clenched so hard it ached. Those disloyal social climbers always flocked to the next big thing. She would make them pay one day.

A boutique assistant approached timidly. "Miss Kensington, are you purchasing the gown? Store policy states that even VIPs cannot try on a gown for more than five minutes..."

Victoria's face darkened like a storm cloud. Even this lowly shop girl dared to disrespect her! In the past, she would try on gowns for over ten minutes without a word. The audacity! Isadora saw Victoria's fury and feared she might collapse.

"We'll take it!" Isadora declared to the assistant. "Of course she's buying it! Here's my card. Please give us some privacy." She handed over her card and quickly guided Victoria into a private fitting room.

Once inside, Victoria's composure shattered. She grabbed the nearest object and hurled it across the room. "That witch, Isabella! How dare she! How could she be so vile! How could she defeat me!" she screamed.

'The winner should have been me,' Victoria seethed internally. 'Everyone's admiration should be mine!' If her plan had succeeded, the Guci launch would have been a triumph. The 'Most Valuable Commercial Model Award' would have been hers. Now, everything was ruined.

Isadora watched the meltdown with deep distress. "Victoria, I never expected Isabella to pull such a stunt. I know you're furious. Let it all out. Once you're done, we need to find a solution."

"A solution?" Victoria spat with bitter defeat. "What solution? Have you seen what the netizens are saying? They're all laughing at me! Can't you see how Isabella is overshadowing me completely?" She roughly tossed Isadora's phone back to her.

Isadora didn't have time to react. The phone struck the back of her hand with a sharp thud. Pain shot through her, but she felt no anger. Only profound sorrow filled her heart. The more she saw Victoria suffer, the worse she felt.

She picked up her phone and stepped forward. She wrapped her arms around a trembling Victoria. "Tori, if you need to cry, then cry. You don't have to hold back with me. If you need to hit me or scream at me, do it. This is my fault as your manager. I failed you."
###Chapter 104

“I gave your mother my word that I would protect you, yet I…” Isadora’s voice broke, thick with emotion.

Victoria stared at the angry red mark on her hand before lifting her gaze. Her agent, always so composed, now had tears welling in her eyes. Victoria’s composure shattered. She slid to the floor, a graceless collapse.

“Isadora, I never meant to lash out. I’m just… terrified. I know my place in the Montgomery family is temporary. I needed to build my own career, my own security, before they cast me aside. I wanted to earn my own fortune. Why is Isabella so determined to ruin me? She has everything! The Montgomery empire, more wealth than she could ever spend, even Nathaniel Blackwood himself. Why can’t she just leave me alone? She won’t be happy until I’m completely destroyed!” The words spilled out, venomous and raw with a pain that cut deep.

Isadora sank down beside her, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. “Victoria, not everyone possesses a heart like yours. Isabella targeted you from the beginning. This was a calculated move. We didn’t lose to her; we simply underestimated her ruthlessness. Promise me you’ll pull yourself together. Go home. Rest. I will find another way. I promise you.”

Victoria could only nod, her body wracked with sobs. She leaned heavily against the cold wall, utterly defeated. The situation was dire. The humiliation would follow her for years. The mocking whispers were already beginning.

Watching her, Isadora’s heart ached. “Should I call Alexander? His company might distract you.”

At the mention of Alexander Whitmore, a flicker of life returned to Victoria’s eyes. Over the past few days, he’d been feeding her stories about Isabella’s attempts to seduce Nathaniel. But the news of their actual marriage was a blow she still couldn’t process. Nathaniel Blackwood would never marry a woman with a tarnished past, a woman who had supposedly lost a child.

Aside from the Blackwoods, Alexander was the most handsome, powerful man she knew. The nation’s most coveted bachelor. Securing him would be her ultimate victory over Isabella.

She gave a weak nod. “Yes. Let him come. There are things we need to discuss.”

“Alright.” Isadora made the call, then helped Victoria to her feet. She gently cleaned her smudged makeup and reapplied it with practiced hands.

Victoria glanced again at her injured hand, regret washing over her. “Isadora… I’m sorry. I lost control.”

“It’s alright, dear. No apologies needed. I made a vow to your mother. I owe her everything. Without Evangeline, I wouldn’t be here today.” Isadora’s gaze was filled with unwavering devotion.

Years ago, a young and naive Isadora had been brutally attacked and left for dead in a gutter. It was Evangeline Kensington, Victoria’s mother, who found her, saved her, and became her protector. Even later, Evangeline continued to be her guardian angel.

The last message Isadora ever received from her was clear. [I’ve never asked you for anything. Please, watch over my daughter.]

Isadora had dedicated her life to that promise. Victoria was her daughter in all but blood. Her success was Isadora’s success. Her pain was Isadora’s pain. No one would harm her.

“Remember your greatest asset is that beautiful face. When Alexander arrives, don’t let him see you broken. Hold onto him. He is your safety net. At the very least, you will become Mrs. Alexander Whitmore, a respected name in high society.”

“I won’t fail. Besides, Alexander has a plan. A way to destroy Isabella completely, beyond any recovery.” Victoria’s expression turned serious, determined. “Leave Alexander to me. You focus on Isabella. Watch her every move. We need to find the perfect moment to strike back. This time, we leave no trace. No evidence.”

“Understood.”

Outside, the summer sky had darkened. Thick, ominous clouds rolled in, and the wind began to howl. A storm was coming.
###Chapter 105

Victoria had barely been gone for five minutes when Alexander showed up.
The moment she spotted him, Tiffany rushed into his arms with theatrical distress.
“Alexander… I failed you,” she sobbed into his chest.
“I lost to my sister. I’m so ashamed.”

He gently wiped her tears away.
“Don’t cry, my love. This isn’t about me—it’s about you. You’re the one who’s hurting.”

She continued to weep, leaning heavily against him.
“I’m useless. Isabella is the talented one. She beat me fairly.
But the worse part is… the more she succeeds, the more Nathaniel will want her.
It breaks my heart for you.”

She looked up, eyes glistening with manufactured concern.
“She used to adore you, but now… I doubt she even remembers your name.
Now that she’s won, Nathaniel will be all over her.
What if she hands her diamond mines to him?
You’ve known her since childhood, Alexander…
But you can’t compete with a man like Nathaniel Blackwood.”

Alexander’s expression hardened.
Isabella had not only survived the scandal—she’d turned it into a triumph.
Everyone was stunned.
Nathaniel would only want her more now.
And Isabella… she no longer needed Alexander.
She’d outgrown him.

He pulled Victoria closer, voice low and reassuring.
“Don’t worry about any of that.
Take a few days off.
Rest.
Stay off the internet.
I’ll handle Isabella.
Remember… I still have that card to play.
And I’m ready to use it when the time is right.”

“What card?” she asked, feigning confusion.
“Is it enough to… ruin her?”

“It’s a trap she set for herself these past few days while coming after you.
Don’t give her another thought,” he murmured, holding her tighter.

Victoria melted into his embrace, playing the fragile, broken bird.
But behind the helpless act, her mind was sharp, calculating.
Whatever Alexander had… it had better destroy Isabella completely.
She didn’t need to lift a finger—not when Alexander was willing to do it for her.

He felt her tremble in his arms and his heart clenched.
How could he not love someone who always put him first?
He would find a way to strip Isabella of everything she’d gained.
Victoria deserved to feel safe.
She deserved to win.

Outside, lightning split the sky.
Thunder boomed.
Rain began to pour, hammering against the windows.
The bright afternoon had vanished behind a wall of storm.

At Violet Villa, the doorbell rang.
Isabella looked through the peephole.
Nathaniel stood there, umbrella in hand, little Oliver clinging to his leg.
Even with protection, both were damp from the downpour.

She hadn’t planned on letting them back into her life.
But she couldn’t leave them standing in the storm.
She opened the door.
“What are you doing here?”

“We came to celebrate, Mommy!” Oliver chirped, wobbling under the weight of a large gift bag.
Nathaniel stepped inside, closing the umbrella.
He carried two bottles of expensive red wine.

“Celebrate what?” she asked, arching a brow.

“Your victory,” Nathaniel said smoothly.
“Turning the tables on Victoria… that was impressive.
It calls for a celebration.”

She hadn’t expected this.
“It’s really not that big of a deal.
I’ve beaten plenty of people before.
I’ll beat plenty more.”

Nathaniel almost smiled at her confidence.
“Then let’s just have a simple barbecue.
No occasion needed.”

He moved toward the kitchen, unpacking the bag with practiced elegance.
Prime cuts of wagyu beef.
Fresh Argentine lobster.
Herbs, truffles, delicate sauces.
Everything was pre-prepped in polished containers, ready for the grill.

Isabella stared.
This was his idea of a simple barbecue?
The spread before her was worth a fortune.
Even for someone like her, it felt… excessive.
###Chapter 106

Living alone meant minimal cooking for her.
Instant noodles became her default meal solution.
She had even perfected a self-heating boxed meal technique...

Nathaniel noticed her stillness and approached.
He gently tugged her hand and urged, "Mommy, let's eat now."
His voice carried excitement as he continued, "Barbecue tastes amazing during rainfall. Everything's incredibly tasty."
With determined pulls, he guided her toward the dining area.

Isabella glimpsed the torrential downpour through the window.
Reluctantly, she abandoned her plan to eject them.
She settled at the table opposite Nathaniel.
He expertly grilled pork belly with practiced movements.
Tongs flipped sizzling meat with precise timing.
He brushed oil lightly before seasoning with salt, pepper, and cumin.
The aroma of perfectly charred meat soon permeated the air.

Isabella's brow furrowed in suspicion.
How did someone previously clueless in kitchens master grilling so flawlessly?
Her eyes caught a prominent burn blister on his forearm.
Fresh and angry-looking.

"Did you take cooking lessons just for this?" she questioned.

"Indeed," Nathaniel confirmed elegantly.
He wrapped a perfectly cooked pork slice in fresh lettuce.
His hands presented the neat bundle to her lips. "Try this."

His gaze held tender concern that felt uncomfortably intimate.
Such husband-wife dynamics felt misplaced between near-strangers...

She blinked away the thought. "I can serve myself."
She selected raw meat to grill independently.

Disappointment flickered in Nathaniel's eyes briefly.
He maintained his outstretched hand steadily.
His voice dropped to a magnetic murmur. "Ms. Montgomery, consider my injury."
"Won't you humor me just this once?"

The velvety baritone weakened her resistance inexplicably.
Against better judgment, she acquiesced.

A subtle smile touched his lips.
He brought the lettuce wrap closer to her mouth.
Her lower lip accidentally grazed his fingertips during the bite.
Electric stillness seized both instantly.
A peculiar sensation radiated through their bodies.

Isabella frowned like witnessing supernatural phenomena.
Had she developed cardiac issues recently?
A comprehensive medical checkup seemed urgently necessary!

Nathaniel's smile deepened intriguingly.
He ate another grilled piece himself.
Then he deliberately sucked his fingertips while maintaining eye contact.
"Mmm, exceptionally flavorful," he declared meaningfully.

Isabella's cheeks flushed crimson immediately.
Was he praising the meat's taste or... something else entirely?

As she pondered, Nathaniel grilled a sizable Argentine lobster.
He offered a succulent piece to her lips again.
Using the same hand he'd just sucked clean?

"I don't— Oh!" Her protest got cut off by the inserted morsel.
Her mind reeled at the indirect kiss implication.

"Nathaniel!"

"Present. What requires attention?" He feigned innocence perfectly.

Isabella scowled at his audacious thick-skinned act.
Clearly, direct confrontation became necessary.
She turned to Oliver. "Sweetheart, fetch Mommy's orange juice from the upstairs fridge please?"

"Right away!" Oliver abandoned his utensils cheerfully.
He scampered off on his mission.

Nathaniel's brow tightened almost imperceptibly.
Isabella deliberately sent Oliver away.
Whatever she planned to discuss privately likely boded ill for him.
###Chapter 107

Just as he anticipated, the moment Christopher left the room, Isabella spun around to face him with a stern expression. “Nathaniel. I expect you to behave appropriately around me from now on. Especially in front of the child. He’s still young and impressionable.”

“Hmm? Behave inappropriately? When did that happen?” Nathaniel’s expression was the picture of pure innocence.

Isabella was momentarily speechless. ‘Am I reading too much into this? His acting skills are truly exceptional,’ she thought to herself.

“In that case, let’s address the real issue. Starting today, do not come looking for me with Christopher,” Isabella stated firmly.

Nathaniel’s hand, which was holding the fork, twitched almost imperceptibly. The warmth in his eyes gradually cooled.

Isabella continued, undeterred by his shifting mood. “You know perfectly well that nothing can ever happen between us. Oliver needs to adjust to life without me. A clean break is better than a prolonged attachment. As his father, you should help him move on. Otherwise, he’ll be devastated when the inevitable separation comes.”

Nathaniel’s face darkened. He set down his fork and fixed her with an intense gaze. “I’m curious. What gave you the impression that we are impossible? What exactly is it about me that you find so objectionable? Feel free to be blunt.” His demeanor was deadly serious, his eyes probing.

Isabella’s heart gave a little flip before the memories of five years ago came rushing back. She remembered her circumstances.

Avoiding his penetrating stare, she replied coolly, “I don’t care for men who are overly persistent. It’s unattractive. I prefer men who are aloof and unattainable. I enjoy the challenge. Furthermore, I believe in instant connections. To be perfectly honest, my first impression of you was not favorable. I never developed any feelings for you. Love cannot be forced.”

Nathaniel suddenly rose and leaned across the table, closing the distance between them. Isabella watched his face draw nearer, her heart beginning to race uncontrollably. She struggled to maintain her composure. “What are you doing?”

He captured her wrist with one hand, his other tilting her chin upward. His lips moved inexorably closer. Trapped by his grip, Isabella could neither retreat nor pull away. In an instant, his face was mere inches from hers, so close their noses almost touched.

With each breath, she was enveloped by his distinct, masculine scent. One small movement forward would bring their lips together… Her heart hammered wildly against her ribs, like a frightened animal fleeing for its life. It felt ready to burst from her chest.

Nathaniel watched her, his lips beginning their final descent. Isabella quickly turned her head, evading the kiss. His cool lips brushed against her cheekbone, landing perilously close to her earlobe. A wave of sensation swept through her, leaving her momentarily paralyzed.

A faint smile touched Nathaniel’s lips as he whispered near her ear, “A normal resting heart rate for a woman is between sixty and one hundred beats per minute. In the last thirty seconds, yours was fifty-five. Are you still certain you feel nothing for me? Hmm?”

As he spoke, his grip on her wrist tightened almost imperceptibly. Isabella’s body went rigid. So that was his game. Grabbing her wrist, moving closer… all to measure her pulse? The man was infuriatingly meticulous.

She snatched her hand back, fighting to keep her voice steady. “Has no one ever told you that heart rates fluctuate? Temperature, digestion… countless factors affect it. I told you I have no feelings for you. That is the truth. From now on, unless it’s strictly business, do not seek me out.” Her tone was ice-cold, utterly devoid of emotion.

For the first time, Nathaniel felt a sharp, slicing pain deep in his chest. He was silent for a long moment before replying with quiet resignation, “Very well. I will respect your wishes.”

Perfectly on cue, Christopher returned with the juice, entering the kitchen. Nathaniel took the glass and set it on the counter before reaching for the boy. “Come. We’re leaving.”

“But… Oliver hasn’t finished his steak yet…” Christopher’s face fell, disappointment written all over it.

Nathaniel gently stroked his hair. “Be good. I’ll make you more another time. We mustn’t disturb Mommy today, alright?”

“Okay.” Christopher pouted, turning to wave at Isabella. “Goodbye, Mommy. Eat lots and get super full.”

An unexpected ache tightened Isabella’s throat. It felt constricted, and it took her a moment to force out a single word.
###Chapter 108

“Alright,” Isabella responded to Oliver.

Nathaniel carried the boy and stepped outside. The storm raged violently. Lightning flashed across the sky, followed by deafening thunder.

Though it was daytime, the heavy clouds made it feel like dusk had fallen early.

Isabella watched the door close. Silence enveloped her. Peace returned, but a strange emptiness settled in her chest.

The meat on the table continued to sizzle. The warmth had vanished from the room. Exhausted, she slumped into a chair. Her appetite was gone. Disgust for Victoria and Alexander churned inside her. She loathed the man from that night five years ago. They had ruined everything.

If only she had met Nathaniel first. Things would be different. But now, she distrusted all men. For years, her sole focus had been revenge. That was her only purpose. She closed her eyes, trying to adjust to the crushing quiet.

Suddenly, the front door burst open. Nathaniel rushed back inside, Oliver still in his arms. Her eyes widened in shock. “Why did you come back?”

“You said only for business. I’m here as the CEO of Blackwood Corporation. To discuss a professional matter.” He set Oliver down and approached her, handing her a contract.

She took it. It was a modeling contract for a car show. Blackwood Corp and Mercedes were co-hosting a major national auto event. Thirteen new models were launching, including a limited edition gold sports car. All participating models were elite, seasoned professionals with years of experience. He was offering this to a newcomer like her?

“Nathaniel, is this an abuse of power?”

“Ms. Montgomery, you misunderstand. My duty is to hire the best talent. You are currently the industry’s brightest rising star. Securing you would be an honor for the company. Furthermore, Victoria Kensington is also hired for this event. She will be in a supporting role to you. Still not interested?” His expression was utterly serious, all business.

She glanced at the model list. Victoria’s name was there. Her endorsement was for the lowest-tier car, positioned in the farthest corner of the hall. He knew her too well. He understood her desires perfectly.

Her entire reason for returning was to crush Victoria. To destroy her modeling career utterly. Only when backed into a corner would Victoria’s true, vile nature show. Then the Montgomery family would finally see the truth. Anything that displeased Victoria pleased her immensely.

Making Victoria play a secondary, supporting role was the perfect humiliation. Isabella picked up a pen and signed her name with a sharp, elegant flourish.

A faint smile touched Nathaniel’s lips as he carefully stored the contract. “As business partners, sharing a meal to celebrate is acceptable, yes?”

“Of course! We have many details to discuss!” Oliver chirped, not waiting for her reply. He scampered to the table and resumed eating his interrupted meal.

Nathaniel sat across from her, pouring wine for them both. He raised his glass. “Ms. Montgomery. To a successful collaboration.”

She narrowed her eyes. These two were like persistent kidnappers she couldn’t shake. Yet, watching them, feeling the warmth from the food, the earlier emptiness began to fade, replaced by a reluctant contentment.

Fine. She would play along for now. As long as the job proceeded smoothly. The thought of Victoria being her accessory made her lips curve into a smile. She could already picture Victoria’s furious expression. The day of the auto show would be a glorious spectacle.
###Chapter 109

Isabella finished her meal and was immediately pulled toward the sofa by Oliver. He insisted she rest with him. It didn't take long before his breathing evened out into a soft, steady rhythm. He was asleep, curled on her lap. His small, warm body felt like a little ball of sunshine against her. She gently ran her fingers through his soft hair, her gaze drifting away from him.

It wandered across the room and into the kitchen.

Nathaniel stood there. A stark gray apron was tied over his impeccably tailored suit. He was washing dishes. The contrast was almost jarring. The formal business attire looked utterly out of place against the domestic backdrop of the kitchen. His movements were efficient, yet somehow still carried an air of practiced unfamiliarity. Outside, the heavy downpour had ceased. A single, brilliant beam of sunlight broke through the dissipating clouds. It cut through the window.

By some trick of light, it fell directly upon him.

The light gilded his tall, powerful frame, outlining him in gold. He looked devastatingly handsome, like a statue brought to life. Isabella found herself completely captivated. Her hand stilled on Oliver’s head. She watched, mesmerized.

She couldn't pinpoint the exact moment it had happened. Her life had become… louder. Fuller. Since these two had barged into it. The thought of future days without them…

She caught herself. A sigh escaped her. What was she thinking? A future without them would be no different than her present. She wasn't with them. This was a business arrangement. A contract. Nothing more.

The rain had stopped. Their reason for staying was gone. She deliberately turned her head away, closing her eyes. She willed the unwelcome, sentimental thoughts to scatter. Just then, Nathaniel entered the living room. The apron was gone. He was back to his usual, coolly composed self.

She didn’t look at him. “Take him,” she said, her tone direct and businesslike. “You can go home now.”

“I’m afraid that won’t be possible today,” Nathaniel responded. He sat down on the sofa beside her. His arm casually draped over the back of the cushion, behind her shoulders.

“Why not?” Isabella scowled. What excuse had he concocted now to linger?

“Did you thoroughly read the agreement before you signed?” he asked, his voice devoid of any humor.

“Of course I did,” she retorted instantly. Isabella Montgomery was meticulous. She scrutinized every clause, every line of any contract she ever signed. No one had ever managed to trap her in fine print before. This contract was between her and Blackwood Corporation. There was no possible clause that could force Nathaniel to remain in her home.

Nathaniel held her gaze, his expression unreadable. “Recite the second to last clause for me.”

Isabella’s mind raced, pulling the document from her memory. “After signing the contract, Party B shall be obliged to confirm all plans related to the auto show with the appointed person-in-charge, henceforth known as Party A…” Her voice trailed off. Her frown deepened. “You’re the person-in-charge?”

“Yes.” The single word was delivered with utter seriousness.

A strange feeling washed over her. She felt outmaneuvered. Trapped. She never would have anticipated that Nathaniel Blackwood, the formidable CEO of a vast empire, would personally oversee a relatively minor contract like hers. She slumped back against the sofa cushions. “Fine. What plans need confirming?”

“Hmm…” He pretended to consider it for a moment. “As the person-in-charge, I need to ensure your runway walk meets our standards. Show me. Imagine you’re on the catwalk right now.”

“Nathaniel!” she snapped, her eyes flashing with warning. “Are you trying to get yourself hurt?”

He maintained his perfectly straight face. “What’s the issue? Pre-event practice is standard protocol.”

“Is it really?” she asked, her eyes narrowing into dangerous slits. A sharp, suspicious gleam flashed within them. Even if it was protocol, his motives were absolutely not pure.

He remained infuriatingly calm. “We can table the catwalk for now. In that case, simply show me a pose.”

“Get! Out!” The words were bitten out, sharp and clear. “I want you out of my house! You have three minutes!” She carefully lifted the sleeping Oliver and unceremoniously deposited him into Nathaniel’s arms. She stood up swiftly, turning on her heel. She marched toward the stairs without a backward glance. This man was infuriating. He was toying with her while wearing that maddeningly serious expression. She refused to play his game.
###Chapter 110

Nathaniel’s gaze locked onto Isabella’s unyielding posture. He reminded her coldly, “We have a signed contract, Isabella. You’re breaching it.”

Isabella finally halted her steps. She turned to face him, her expression icy. “Breaching it? Then terminate it. I can cover the tens of millions in penalties without a problem.”

She was ferocious. Utterly untamed.

She knew he wouldn’t cancel their agreement. Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. This wildcat was fascinating.

Meanwhile, at the Montgomery Manor, Victoria was in agony. She hid alone in her room, seething. Alexander had promised retribution against Isabella, but the timing wasn’t right for his leverage. For now, she could only watch Isabella’s meteoric rise.

The internet was obsessed with Isabella. Her popularity dwarfed Victoria’s by over tenfold. Netizens marveled at her stunning reversal and ultimate victory. They were captivated by her beauty, her eloquence, her sheer presence. Isabella seemed flawless.

Victoria’s fists clenched. Jealousy and pure hatred radiated from her in waves. “This is unbearable. I want to destroy her. I want my glory back,” she seethed internally.

The door creaked open. Eleanor entered, carrying a small plate with a slice of cake. “Victoria, darling? Are you alright?” she asked, her voice laced with concern.

“I’m… I’m fine,” Victoria stammered, quickly composing herself and sliding off the bed.

They sat at the small table near the window. Eleanor sighed mournfully. “You can talk to me, sweetheart. Isabella has gone too far this time! She’s adopted. She should be making concessions for you. Why is she so determined to provoke you? Such an ungrateful wretch!”

“Mother, please don’t blame my sister. She’s just… more talented than I am. I’m sure she never meant to harm me,” Victoria said, her tone placating.

“Never meant to? You are too pure, too kind-hearted. Always defending her! Can’t you see? She’s been using your status as the top model to climb up. She’s stepping on you to reach the top! Now she wants to use you as her supporting act!” Eleanor’s anger flared as she spoke.

Victoria’s brow furrowed. “Her supporting act? Mother, what are you talking about?”

Eleanor let out a heavy sigh. “Your agent, Isadora, was here earlier. She brought a contract for you. For the Mercedes Auto Show. Somehow, that novice Isabella landed the lead model role. She must have paid a fortune. She deliberately arranged for you to endorse the lowest-tier car model at the show. I refused it on your behalf, of course.”

Victoria’s expression tightened. The annual Mercedes Auto Show hired Isabella? She always believed they exclusively used foreign models. Mercedes was a premier luxury brand. The attendees were elite, the absolute pinnacle of society.

The previous year, Victoria herself had tried for a spot and was flatly rejected. She couldn’t believe Isabella was hired. A complete newcomer. It was impossible. And they wanted her to play second fiddle?

Eleanor grasped Victoria’s hand. “My dear, don’t pay her any mind. Just stay away from her. All this publicity lately… ‘Rookie model dethrones the number one.’ She’s blatantly riding on your coattails.”

“Promise me, Victoria. Don’t consider her your sister anymore. Never give her another chance to leech off your success. I will find a way to convince your grandfather to revoke those fifteen percent shares he gave her. I’ll make him see her for the manipulative schemer she truly is.”

“Thank you for always protecting me, Mother. But I’ve decided. I want to accept the Auto Show offer,” Victoria stated calmly.

“What? Victoria, are you insane? You want to be Isabella’s supporting act?” Eleanor was utterly shocked, unable to process the words.
###Chapter 111

Victoria narrowed her eyes. She hadn't landed a single endorsement deal in months. The nude photo scandal and her humiliating defeat against Isabella had left her completely frozen out of the industry. Getting a contract with a major corporation like Mercedes was nothing short of a miracle. There was no way she could refuse this opportunity.

Even as a supporting model, she would be the only local talent besides Isabella featured at the prestigious Mercedes Auto Show. This move would silence her critics and crush countless rivals beneath her heel. She had her own special methods for dealing with Isabella Montgomery. Playing second fiddle was merely a temporary strategy.

She put on a sweet, concerned voice. "Mother, I know you heard the organizers chose Isabella as their lead model. But she's still such a novice. She lacks the star power. Without enough buzz at the Auto Show, my poor sister will become a laughingstock. If I participate too, any extra attention I draw will only help her. It's for her own good."

"Victoria, my dear, I've told you before. Stop worrying about that wretched girl. She's the Montgomery family's greatest shame. She doesn't deserve your kindness!" Eleanor Kensington lamented, her voice heavy with disapproval.

Victoria took her mother's hand, her tone soft and pleading. "Mother, we grew up together. Through everything, I will always care for her. I truly believe love can change a person. She will see my sincerity one day and return to the family. We can be a real family again! Staying cooped up here just lets my mind wander to dark places. Please, let me do the Auto Show."

She finished with a coquettish pout, still clinging to Eleanor's hand. Eleanor sighed in exasperated defeat. "Fine. I can never say no to you. But remember this. If she dares to bully you this time, I will not stand idly by. I will mobilize the full force of the Kensington family against her. I will drive her straight out of Westchester for good!"

"I'll remember. Thank you, Mother." Victoria melted into her embrace, a mask of pure glee on her face. Those exact words were what she needed to hear. She had to utterly destroy Isabella before the Kensingtons ever discovered the truth.

The moment Eleanor left, Victoria snatched her phone. A message from Gabriella Martinez glowed on the screen.

[Victoria, I deliberately leaked that contract to Lady Kensington. I wanted to stoke her hatred for Isabella. Use this chance wisely.]

Victoria's fingers flew across the screen.

[Don't worry. She despises Isabella completely now. She even vowed to use all the family's power to exile her from Westchester. This time, we cannot let Isabella turn the tables! I have a detailed plan, but I need you to handle it personally. We can't trust anyone else. This is critical. No one can know about this except us!]

(Understood! I'll handle it myself!) Gabriella typed back immediately.

Victoria sent the intricate plan. Gabriella read it, her frown deepening. If it worked, Isabella would be completely ruined, facing at least five years in prison. But if it failed… She understood now why Victoria demanded her personal involvement. Every single detail was vital. There was no room for error.

In the following days, Isabella and the other top models were immersed in intense preparations. Nathaniel Blackwood, wanting to shield her from clashes, arranged for her to practice separately. Throughout the entire training period, Isabella saw no one, not even Victoria. The peace was a welcome respite. In her spare time, she assisted Adrian Sinclair with managing GoldenPhoenix Entertainment and continued her investigation into the events from five years ago.

She had already scrutinized every guest present at The Ritz-Carlton that fateful day. Even Victoria's role had been uncovered, yet the trail for that man had gone cold. It seemed Victoria was the only one who held the key to the truth.

Isabella set down the list of names, a dark shadow passing through her eyes. Since the investigation had hit a wall, the next step was to extract the information directly from Victoria. The Auto Show presented the perfect opportunity.

Before she knew it, the day of the Mercedes Auto Show arrived. The backstage was a whirlwind of top international supermodels, all blonde and blue-eyed. Victoria had arrived too.

Normally, her entrance would be met with roaring crowds of fans. But the nude photo scandal and her very public defeat had changed everything. Her arrival was subdued, almost anonymous. She moved through the backstage with Gabriella, feeling like a complete unknown, a ghost of her former self.
###Chapter 112

Every top model's eyes locked onto Victoria Kensington. Whispers spread through the room like wildfire.

“Who is she? Mercedes never hires local talent for their main shows.”

“She looks familiar. Maybe a second-tier model?”

“That’s the girl from the nude photo scandal. The one that blew up the industry.”

“Didn’t she completely bomb the Guci campaign? They say she’s poison for endorsements now.”

“How did someone like her even get into the Mercedes Auto Show?”

Their mocking tones cut deep. Victoria’s fists clenched at her sides. They were targeting every one of her failures. Rubbing her public humiliation in her face.

These women were legends. Each had a mantle full of major awards. Victoria had two top model trophies herself. But one was bought through connections. The other was...tainted.

In raw talent, she couldn't match them. Not truly.

Victoria took a sharp breath. She addressed them in their native language, a skill she’d painstakingly mastered. “I was just as surprised to get this opportunity. I didn’t fight for it. My sister secured the spot for me.”

“Your sister?” A wave of shock passed through the group.

“Yes,” Victoria said smoothly. “You didn’t know? She’s this year’s lead model. For the gold race car. I have so much admiration for her. So young. No major awards to her name, yet here she is.”

Murmurs erupted. “A special relationship with the organizer, no doubt.”

“I don’t believe those rumors,” Victoria countered, her voice dripping with false sincerity. “She’s incredibly gifted. You’ll see when you meet her. You’ll understand.” She turned. “Isadora, let’s go change.” Her agent, Isadora Vasquez, nodded and guided her away.

Eleven stunned supermodels were left in her wake. The organizer had kept the lead model a secret. They’d all assumed it was a global superstar. Not some unknown rookie.

A nobody stealing the spotlight from true icons? Unforgivable.

Seraphina Delacroix, the most famous model present, studied Victoria. She seemed familiar. That girl from the Chanel finale... Isabella Montgomery had stolen Victoria’s moment then. Now, she’d snatched the Auto Show’s top role. She was always eclipsing Victoria.

The sharp click of heels echoed in the hallway. Seraphina’s eyes narrowed. “Let’s teach her a lesson.” Unified nods answered her. A common enemy united them.

The door swung open. Isabella Montgomery entered. She wore sleek black bell-bottom trousers and a crimson crop top. Her presence was electric, commanding the room. Hostile glares followed her every move. She ignored them completely. Her gaze was fixed ahead, dismissive of the gathered royalty of the fashion world. She moved toward her designated vanity.

A timid makeup artist approached. “Good afternoon, Ms. Montgomery. I’m your assigned artist for today. These are your accessories.” She laid out a pair of earrings, a watch, and other items.

“Leave us,” Seraphina commanded the artist. She advanced, her coterie of tall, blonde, blue-eyed models forming a formidable wall around Isabella. Their combined height and fury created an intimidating atmosphere.

The makeup artist fled, seeking refuge in a corner.

From the changing room doorway, Victoria watched. A sly smile touched her lips. Crossing Seraphina Delacroix was a fatal mistake. Isabella was finished.
######Chapter 113
The moment the stylist exited, Genevieve Laurent stepped forward aggressively. Her heels clicked sharply against the floor.

She swept her arm across Isabella Montgomery’s vanity. A violent crash echoed through the room.

Cosmetics, brushes, and accessories scattered everywhere. The custom outfit laid out for the show tumbled into the dust.

Seraphina Delacroix watched coldly from the doorway. Her presence alone was a statement. A queen descending to handle a nuisance personally.

“I don’t care who you know here,” Genevieve spat. “You’re a nobody. A rookie. We are not your backup dancers. Know your place. Pack your things. Leave. Now.”

A chorus of agreement rose from the other models. Their glares were sharp, unified. A wall of hostility.

Isabella didn’t flinch. She leaned back in her chair, utterly calm. “You think breaking a few things is supposed to frighten me?”

Silence. Then, disbelief. How was she so composed? Outnumbered and cornered.

Genevieve’s face flushed a deep, furious red. With a guttural sound of rage, she grabbed the edge of the vanity and shoved. The entire unit toppled over. Glass shattered. The noise was deafening.

It wasn’t enough. Genevieve stalked toward the clothing rack. She snatched a delicate beaded bracelet from its hanger.

She threw it to the floor. Her stiletto heel came down on it with brutal force. A sickening crunch echoed in the sudden quiet.

“This is what will happen to you,” she hissed at Isabella, her voice low and venomous. “If you don’t get out. I’ll break you myself.”

Isabella actually laughed. A dry, humorless sound. “That’s all the strength you have? Pathetic. If you’re hungry, there’s food. Eat. Then try again. Put some real effort into it.”

She began removing her own accessories. A sleek black watch. A matching obsidian ring. She dropped them casually onto the floor at Genevieve’s feet. The gesture was wildly defiant.

The models stared, baffled. Was she insane? Was she daring them?

From her spot near the changing area, Victoria Kensington watched, a frown etching her features. This was not going as planned. Isabella’s fearlessness was unnerving.

Another model snapped. “You’re asking for it, Montgomery!” She lunged forward, her heel aiming for the expensive watch.

Crack. The crystal face splintered. A six-figure piece, destroyed.

Isabella didn’t even look. She examined her black-painted nails, bored. “Don’t stop on my account. Keep going. Destroy it all. I insist.”

She finally lifted her gaze, icy and direct. “After all, none of this is mine. Every single item belongs to the event organizers.”

The air left the room.

All color drained from their faces. Stunned silence. They had been so focused on humiliating her, they never considered the labels on the clothes, the tags on the jewelry. These were show pieces. Loaned property.

“You witch!” Genevieve gasped, scrambling back from the wreckage as if it were radioactive. “You set us up!”

“Did I?” Isabella’s voice was a blade of frozen steel. “I forced you to trash my station? I made you stomp on the designer outfits? I commanded your little mob to come threaten me? Is that your story?”

Her words left them speechless, trapped.

Before anyone could form a reply, she checked her phone. “You have about two minutes. If you want to finish the job. The head organizer is on his way up. With a full press corps.”

Seraphina Delacroix’s cool composure finally cracked. “What? Reporters are coming here? Now?”
###Chapter 114

Seraphina Delacroix had received a tip from a confidential source. The head of the Blackwood family was the main organizer of this year's Auto Show. She had been infatuated with Nathaniel Blackwood for years. She had confessed her feelings to him multiple times. Every single time, he had turned her down. Today, she was thrilled to have another opportunity to see him!

Isabella Montgomery’s crimson lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. “I heard all the organizers are prominent CEOs,” she remarked, her voice deceptively sweet. “They’ll be arriving shortly for a live broadcast. Ten top entertainment reporters are joining them. Imagine the scene when those executives walk in and see this disaster backstage. What will the fans think when they witness a group of established supermodels ganging up on a newcomer?”

Her words, though melodious, felt like a venomous curse to the models. As she spoke, Isabella deliberately ran her fingers through her hair, tousling it until she looked like she had just survived a brutal fight.

Genevieve Laurent finally snapped. “Isabella Montgomery, you are pure evil!” she shrieked, her face contorted with rage. “I will make you pay for this! Just you wait!” She spun around, ready to flee the chaotic scene.

Seraphina grabbed her arm, stopping her cold. “Where do you think you’re going?” she hissed. “Clean this mess up. Now.”

“Me?” Genevieve spat out, incredulous.

“Who else?” Seraphina’s voice was icy. “The rest of you, get your assistants. Start picking everything up off the floor. Now.”

Genevieve and the other models seethed with silent fury. How dare she command them like servants?

A low murmur of voices began to filter in from outside the door. Seraphina shot them a glacial glare. “Do you want your fans to see you as bullies?” she demanded. The models swallowed their pride. They had no choice. They scrambled to gather Isabella’s scattered belongings.

The floor was a warzone of shattered makeup and ruined accessories. The supermodels frantically collected the debris, their movements frantic and stressed. Genevieve, who had gleefully destroyed everything moments before, was now boiling with hateful anger. If the organizers discovered she was responsible for this costly damage, she would be forced to pay for it all! She hurriedly scooped up the broken items and dumped them into a trash bin. She turned to her panicked assistant. “Go to the warehouse! Get a brand new set of everything! Money is no object!”

“Yes, Miss Laurent!” The assistant scurried away.

The footsteps outside grew louder, more distinct. Seraphina noticed Isabella hadn’t moved a muscle. “Fix your hair!” she ordered, her voice tight with anger. If the fans saw Isabella looking like a victim, the narrative would be set.

Isabella merely shrugged, her expression one of feigned helplessness. “I’m sorry,” she said, her voice a soft, pathetic tremor. “I’m so terrified after everyone attacked my things. My whole body has gone numb. I can’t move.”

She can’t move! She’s blatantly refusing to cooperate! The audacity! Seraphina thought, her anger reaching a boiling point. She wanted to strangle Isabella right then and there. But the live stream was imminent. Forcing down her rage, Seraphina strode over to Isabella. With rough, impatient hands, she began smoothing down Isabella’s disheveled hair. Once it was perfectly styled again, Seraphina glared at Isabella’s reflection in the new mirror. “You’ve gotten away with it this time, you savage,” she whispered, her voice dripping with venom. “Just you wait. I will have my revenge.”

“Oh, I look forward to it. Do keep me company until the very end,” Isabella replied. A sinister, arrogant smile played on her lips. She laughed, a sound full of mocking triumph. The surrounding models watched in sullen, hate-filled silence, each wishing for her immediate demise.

The backstage door swung open. A group of men in impeccably tailored suits entered. Seraphina instantly stepped away from Isabella, adopting a neutral expression. The other supermodels scurried back to their own dressing tables, pretending to be engrossed in their preparations. The scene was now one of calm, professional order.

Inside her private changing room, Victoria Kensington was fuming. She felt like screaming. What a useless bunch of idiots! So many of them, and they couldn't even handle one Isabella! How utterly infuriating!

But then, a cold, calculating smirk replaced her anger. She remembered her real plan for the day. Perhaps this squabble being settled was for the best. It would make her own scheme run more smoothly. Today, she would ensure Isabella Montgomery was completely destroyed. She would make sure that woman rotted away in prison for good.
###Chapter 115

Nathaniel Blackwood entered with the other executives. The models were already positioned at their stations. Some were having their makeup retouched while others perfected their poses. His eyes scanned the room until they settled on Isabella Montgomery. She lounged indolently in her chair as a makeup artist worked on her complexion. Even in stillness, Isabella radiated a regal and untouchable aura. A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched Nathaniel's lips, a private display of affection that went unnoticed by everyone.

The media team surged forward with their equipment, moving efficiently into the space. They began their coverage from the lowest-ranked model, introducing Victoria Kensington before progressing upward to Genevieve Laurent. Just as a cameraman moved in for Isabella's close-up, Nathaniel fixed him with a glacial stare. A collective shiver ran through the reporting crew. They hastily wrapped their segment. "That concludes our live preview," the lead announcer stated abruptly. "Stay tuned for the grand opening of the Mercedes Auto Show momentarily." The entire media contingent evacuated the area with remarkable speed.

Backstage now held only the models, their assistants, Nathaniel, the Mercedes executives, and the event coordinators. With the press gone, Genevieve could no longer contain herself. She turned to a Mercedes executive with a pointed expression. "Mr. Worthington," she began, her voice dripping with condescension, "isn't it completely inappropriate to have those two local models at this caliber of event?"

"Absolutely!" another supermodel chimed in immediately. "And making that rookie the main model? It's a joke!"

"Isabella is utterly unqualified for that position! It should belong to Seraphina!" declared a third model.

The supermodels took turns voicing their objections, each argument squarely targeting Isabella. Mr. Worthington shifted uncomfortably and looked toward Nathaniel. "Mr. Blackwood," he said, his tone strained, "you see the situation. I warned you this decision would cause an uproar." The statement sent a ripple of shock through those who heard it. Nathaniel Blackwood was a titan in Aldovia, controlling vast swathes of the nation's real estate, retail, and hospitality sectors. The exhibition hall itself was Blackwood property.

The formidable Nathaniel Blackwood had personally chosen an unknown newcomer as the main model?

Seraphina Delacroix, who had maintained an image of flawless elegance since Nathaniel's arrival, felt her composure crack. This was unbelievable. Hadn't Nathaniel always been ruthlessly impartial? Wasn't his reputation built on never granting special favors? Selecting Isabella was his direct order?

Dressed head-to-toe in sleek black leather, Seraphina moved toward Nathaniel with a hypnotic sway. "Mr. Blackwood," she purred, her voice a blend of honey and steel, "please, enlighten me. What possible justification is there for choosing her over me? Is she more beautiful? Has she won more prestigious awards? Are her legs longer or more sculpted than mine? Or perhaps she's simply taller?"

By any objective measure, Isabella was no match for Seraphina. Seraphina was globally crowned the World's Sexiest Model. To men, she was the ultimate fantasy. Her beauty was considered peerless.

Every eye was locked on Nathaniel, waiting for his explanation with bated breath. He regarded Seraphina with an arctic coldness. "My selection," he stated, his voice resonating with absolute, unassailable authority, "is none of your concern." The finality in his tone was a physical force. No one dared to meet his gaze.
###Chapter 116

Seraphina Delacroix stood frozen in utter disbelief.

She never anticipated such a response.

As an internationally celebrated supermodel, she deserved respect. Yet Nathaniel Blackwood dismissed her outright in favor of that novice, Isabella Montgomery!

How could she ever show her face again after this humiliation?

Seraphina lifted her chin defiantly. "Mr. Blackwood, since you refuse to provide a logical explanation, I quit!"

Her resignation meant the Auto Show would be short one model. Finding a replacement on such short notice seemed impossible.

Archibald Worthington rushed to mediate. "Mr. Blackwood, Miss Delacroix, surely we can resolve this through calm discussion."

Isabella watched from her dressing table, frowning at the escalating conflict. She wanted to intervene, but Nathaniel was already on his phone.

"You have twenty minutes to find a replacement for Seraphina Delacroix," he commanded.

The room fell silent in shock. Seraphina was the industry's top supermodel, adored by millions of male fans. Her face paled instantly.

How could she have forgotten she was dealing with Nathaniel Blackwood of the powerful Blackwood Corporation? No one challenged him and emerged victorious.

She had just threatened Nathaniel Blackwood...

Seraphina's agent hurried forward with anxious apologies. "Mr. Blackwood, please forgive Seraphina's impulsive words. She speaks without thinking but means no harm. She was merely joking earlier. A generous man like you wouldn't hold this against her, would you?" He discreetly nudged Seraphina's arm.

Frustration boiled within Seraphina. She wanted to storm out immediately.

But the modeling commission was incredibly lucrative, and she had already received the advance payment. Leaving would mean returning that substantial sum.

Moreover, this was a prestigious luxury brand Auto Show attended by numerous celebrities. How could she miss such an event? Leaving now would make her the laughingstock of the century!

Clenching her fists, she lowered her head. "I apologize, Mr. Blackwood. I was wrong."

She thought, 'I'll endure this humiliation for now. I'll excel at the Auto Show, and my fans will support me while condemning Isabella for stealing my spotlight!'

Nathaniel's response was icy. "I detect no sincerity in your apology."

Sincerity? She had already humbled herself and admitted fault. Now he demanded more?

Seraphina nearly exploded with rage. She had never been so thoroughly humiliated in her entire career!

Seeing her struggle to contain her anger, her agent interjected desperately. "Mr. Blackwood, we deeply regret our mistake. As a gesture of our sincerity, we'll accept only ninety percent of the modeling fee and guarantee our performance will exceed your expectations!"

"Ensure there are no further incidents," Nathaniel stated imposingly, ending the discussion.

He turned and walked steadily toward Isabella.

Isabella watched his approach with disbelief. 'This man! What is he planning? He's made me a target for everyone's resentment, and now he's coming straight toward me. What does he want?'
###Chapter 117

Isabella’s assistants had finished dressing her in the outfit for the Auto Show.
She sat motionless in her chair, like a statue carved from ice.
Nathaniel strode toward her without hesitation.
He leaned in close, his presence overwhelming.
His fingers brushed against the zipper of her form-fitting leather top.
With one sharp tug, he pulled it all the way up to her throat.
The gesture was possessive, almost territorial.
Her slender neck disappeared beneath the black leather.

Nathaniel’s gaze was intense, his voice low and commanding.
“The Mercedes Auto Show is an elite event,” he stated coldly.
“There’s no need to reveal so much skin.”

A collective gasp swept through the room.
No one could believe what they had just witnessed.
Nathaniel Blackwood—the untouchable, ruthless billionaire—had just publicly claimed Isabella Montgomery.
His words dripped with jealousy and ownership.
This wasn’t just professional interest.
This was personal.
The rumors were true.
He was involved with her.

Isabella shifted uncomfortably in her seat.
Every other model was wearing revealing outfits—deep V-necks, tube tops, barely-there fabrics.
And here she was, zipped up like a nun.
Was he trying to humiliate her?
Or mark his territory in front of everyone?

Archibald Worthington sensed the rising tension.
If this continued, the other models would revolt.
He quickly stepped forward, trying to diffuse the situation.
“Mr. Blackwood,” he said nervously, “the show begins in twenty minutes.
The front stage is ready.
Everyone is waiting for you.”

Nathaniel’s eyes lingered on Isabella.
Even fully covered, her curves were unmistakable.
The tight leather hugged every inch of her body.
She looked both innocent and dangerously seductive.
A mistake, he thought.
Letting her participate was a mistake.

He straightened up, his expression turning glacial.
His voice cut through the room like a blade.
“Isabella is under my protection,” he announced.
“Anyone who targets her will answer to me.”
The threat hung heavy in the air.
Without another word, he turned and walked away.
His entourage scrambled after him, relief and fear on their faces.

Isabella stared after him, stunned.
Why did he keep inserting himself into her life?
Why this constant, infuriating attention?

“He’s gone,” sneered Genevieve Laurent.
“Stop staring.
You think Nathaniel Blackwood actually cares about you?
He’s toying with you.
You’re just a passing amusement.”

Isabella snapped out of her daze.
She shot Genevieve a withering look.
“At least he’s amused,” she retorted.
“You can’t even get his attention.”
With that, she swept out of the room.
She had no patience for petty jealousy.

The other models seethed with envy.
Seraphina Delacroix in particular looked ready to claw Isabella’s eyes out.
But no one dared act.
Not after Nathaniel’s warning.
Not when she had his backing.

The backstage atmosphere turned icy.
Victoria Kensington felt her jealousy burning like acid.
She glared daggers at Isabella’s retreating figure.
Her agent, Isadora Vasquez, gave her a sympathetic look before heading out.
She returned moments later with twelve bottles of chilled juice.
“Ladies, let’s not fight,” she said soothingly.
“We’re all here to work.
It’s a hot day—have something to drink and cool down.
The show starts soon.”
She began distributing the drinks.
The models, still furious but momentarily distracted, accepted them.
Compared to Isabella, Victoria didn’t seem so bad anymore.

After handing out the juices, Isadora approached Isabella with a bottle of orange juice in hand.
She smiled warmly.
“Here,” she said.
“You look like you could use this.”
###Chapter 118

“Isabella, you should have some refreshment too,” Gabriella offered, extending a chilled juice bottle.

“The old proverb warns about Greeks bearing gifts,” Isabella replied coolly, not even glancing at the offering. “Nothing from you comes without strings attached.”

Gabriella’s smile tightened with visible discomfort. “Suit yourself. I’ll just leave it here for later, then.” She set the bottle on the vanity and made a swift exit.

Isabella narrowed her eyes in suspicion. ‘Since when does Gabriella show kindness? Victoria must be plotting something again. If she wants to play games, I’ll play along.’ With a calculated flick of her wrist, Isabella snatched the bottle and tossed it directly into the nearby waste bin.

Victoria maintained a neutral expression, but triumph glittered in her eyes. ‘Just you wait, Isabella. Your downfall is guaranteed.’

At that moment, Archibald Worthington’s assistant, Beatrice Holloway, entered carrying an elaborate fruit arrangement. “Ladies, a token of good fortune from the organizers,” she announced warmly. “A custom strawberry tower for everyone to share. Our lead model shall have the first selection.”

The structure was an artistic cascade of glistening red strawberries, meticulously stacked like a champagne fountain. A single crimson blossom adorned the peak strawberry for added luck.

A voice from the group sneered, “Archibald and his superstitions. Who does a luck ceremony for a professional event?”

“Last year’s fruit sculpture was the Eiffel Tower,” another model recalled nostalgically. “Far more imaginative than this.”

“What a waste letting a novice take the first piece. Ruins the entire tradition,” a third voice muttered bitterly.

Isabella ignored the petty comments and plucked the top strawberry with its decorative flower. As she raised it to her lips, an intense prickling sensation crawled up her spine—the unmistakable feeling of being watched. Her gaze snapped to the corner where Victoria sat, a predatory smile stretching across her face as she watched with barely concealed anticipation.

‘Did Victoria tamper with this?’ Isabella’s instincts screamed in warning. Knowing Victoria’s relentless spite, poisoning was entirely within her repertoire. To avoid offending Archibald while protecting herself, Isabella waited for Beatrice to turn toward the other models. In that split second, she discreetly dropped the strawberry into the trash.

Victoria’s glee became palpable. The stage was set. The show was about to begin. This time, Isabella would not escape.
###Chapter 119

The last strawberry vanished. Now, the grand Auto Show began.

This annual spectacle demanded perfection. Every model abandoned backstage drama, focusing entirely on preparation. The exhibition hall spanned thousands of square meters. It was immense. Yet, it was already packed with impeccably dressed men in sharp suits. Each attendee radiated extreme wealth.

Nathaniel Blackwood carried Oliver to their front-row seats. They waited silently for the show to start. Music swelled, filling the vast space. The dance floor began to ascend, revealing a central platform. On it sat the latest luxury cars. A supermodel stood beside each vehicle. Both the machines and the women were breathtaking.

The platform halted. The models began circling the cars. They paused at precise intervals, striking alluring poses. Each movement highlighted the car's design and their own beauty.

Every new car and model combination made the audience's eyes gleam with delight. Reporters raised their cameras, capturing every moment from every angle. The models offered their best angles to the flashing lights.

Victoria Kensington’s turn arrived. The ever-beautiful Victoria wore a tight leather skirt and a daring vest top. This outfit was a first for her. Her face was a mask of determined sophistication.

But she followed a parade of stunning supermodels. Victoria appeared painfully ordinary next to them. On adjacent platforms, blonde, blue-eyed models posed relentlessly. Their glistening, pale skin looked both sexy and refined, perfectly matching their bold stances.

Young and inexperienced, Victoria was instantly outclassed. Photographers eager to capture her took a few half-hearted shots before lowering their equipment in clear disappointment.

Hushed, scornful comments rippled through the crowd. “Victoria is an embarrassment to Aldovia,” one man muttered. “She’s completely out of her league here.”

“She’s lost all her star power,” another voice agreed. “She never should have agreed to this show. Now the world will think all of Westchester’s models are this terrible.”

“Even Sophia Kensington might have done better. The title of ‘Number One Top Model’ fits Victoria less every day,” a third person added. Though Victoria couldn't hear the words, she saw the disdain on their faces. Frustration boiled inside her.

She wouldn't be here if she had any other endorsements. This style was completely wrong for her. The leather felt awful against her skin. But the thought of Isabella Montgomery’s impending humiliation kept her going. This temporary disgrace was a small price to pay for that satisfaction.

Time moved quickly. Eleven spectacular new cars had been showcased. Following the plan, all the models froze in their final poses. The music shifted, growing more vibrant and energetic. It swelled, building the atmosphere to a fever pitch.

At the center of the stage, a new runway began to rise. It was immense, at least 100 meters long and half a meter taller than the others. It was a truly impressive structure.

At its end sat a shimmering gold race car. It rested there, gleaming with an exceptionally eye-catching luster. The audience gasped, utterly astounded. This car was the coolest thing any of them had ever seen. Its hard exterior utilized visible cutting-edge technology. Every detail screamed distinction and extravagance.

But where was its model? As murmurs about the missing model spread, a sharp alarm blared through the hall. Then, the gold car roared to life.

With a deafening VROOM!, it accelerated, flying down the short runway at high speed. Panic erupted. The crowd was terrified. Those in the front rows scrambled, ready to bolt for their lives.

A race car on a 100-meter runway was insane! If it flew off the end, countless people would be injured. No one moved to stop it. The car raced on. 10 meters from the edge. 5 meters!

People in the direct path looked ready to faint from sheer terror. The less brave were already fleeing their seats. But then, a miracle. The car screeched to a halt, its tires stopping precisely at the runway's very edge. One hair's breadth more, and it would have plunged into the crowd. The driver's skill was phenomenal. The technical precision was outstanding.

“Incredible!” someone shouted. “Who is that driver? Such amazing skill!”

“They’d win first place in any racing event!” another cried out.

“It must be a genius, a wizard behind the wheel! Show yourself! Let us see who you are!”

The entire hall waited, buzzing with rapt anticipation.
###Chapter 120

The entire audience was on the edge of their seats.

Anticipation crackled in the air like electricity.

Everyone was desperate to see the face behind the incredible driving performance.

Sebastian Blackwood had almost skipped the Auto Show entirely.

He had no interest in watching his brother Nathaniel chase after some woman.

These events were always full of desperate people doing shameless things for attention.

It was usually too cringeworthy to sit through.

But this year was shockingly different.

He had just witnessed the most breathtaking, thrilling driving demonstration of his life.

As a dedicated drag racing enthusiast, he felt completely energized.

He leaned forward with the roaring crowd, eyes fixed on the track.

The door of the gleaming gold race car finally swung open.

A heavy black Doc Martens boot hit the pavement.

Then another.

They were followed by a pair of incredibly long, sculpted legs.

Those legs were a masterpiece of muscle and grace.

They seemed to go on forever, showcased by a tight black leather skirt.

The rest of the driver’s form emerged from the vehicle.

It was Isabella Montgomery.

The phenomenal driver was Isabella.

She was clad head-to-toe in form-fitting black leather.

The suit hugged every curve and accentuated her narrow waist.

Her dark hair cascaded freely down her back in a simple, elegant style.

Her presence was utterly commanding.

Dark sunglasses shielded her eyes.

Her lips were painted a dangerous, seductive crimson.

Every detail was mesmerizing.

The crowd exploded.

“Oh my god! She’s flawless!” a voice screamed.

“The racing queen is Isabella Montgomery!” another shouted.

“Since when does she know how to drag race like that?” someone yelled in disbelief.

“Those legs! I would worship those legs forever!”

“This is insane! Unbelievable! My heart is pounding!”

The cheers swelled into a deafening wave of sound.

Isabella remained perfectly still, utterly unfazed by the frenzy.

Her expression was one of cool, detached arrogance.

She slid off the car’s hood and removed her sunglasses.

She casually leaned against the golden vehicle.

She looked like a champion racer savoring a hard-won victory.

Her entire posture was relaxed, confident, and utterly free.

The excitement in the room skyrocketed.

The audience couldn't stop cheering.

“Heavens! She’s a goddess! Absolute perfection!”

“This is a world-class show! She’s a world-class model!”

“Her presence dwarfs every other blonde model here! She represents us all!”

Reporters frantically snapped pictures, their cameras clicking nonstop.

The other supermodels had been working hard with elaborate poses.

They were trying desperately to capture the crowd’s attention.

Isabella had barely moved a muscle.

Yet, in under ten seconds, she had completely stolen the show.

She hadn't even changed her position.

She just lounged against the car, sunglasses in hand.

The photographers still swarmed her, circling for the perfect shot.

They were desperate to capture every angle of her stunning beauty.

Nathaniel Blackwood’s gaze was locked on her.

The normally unshakable man showed a flicker of pure astonishment.

He had watched Isabella practice her walk many times.

Each time, he was captivated.

It was no wonder she was the woman he loved.

Oliver was even more ecstatic.

He threw his hands in the air, shouting with all his might.

“Mommy is the best! She’s amazing! The number one model in the world!”

His cheers ignited the crowd.

Soon, everyone was chanting along.

“Number one top model! The world’s best model!”

The atmosphere reached a fever pitch.

Isabella had stunned them all once again.

Victoria Kensington’s face was a thundercloud of fury.

‘I am the real number one model! That title is mine!’ she seethed internally.

But her position was at the very back of the stage.

She was almost completely hidden behind the other models.

Standing in that dark corner, she felt invisible.

Seeing everyone adore Isabella was unbearable.

‘What right does she have?’ Victoria thought bitterly. ‘She’s just a rookie! An unwed mother! She shouldn’t be here!’

The other supermodels were pathetic for letting a newcomer overshadow them.

This had never happened before.

Isabella showed them no respect as her seniors.

She just ruthlessly outshone them all.

But with all the cameras pointed their way, none of the models dared show their anger.

They held their poses, looking bland and ordinary next to Isabella’s radiance.

Suddenly, a pitiful wail cut through the noise.

Genevieve Laurent crumpled to the floor in apparent agony.

She clutched her stomach, her face twisted in pain as she screamed.

The audience frowned in confusion.

What was happening? Was she having a fit?

Then, like dominoes, the other models began to fall.

One after another, they dropped to the ground beside the luxury cars.

They rolled around, clutching their middles, moaning and crying in distress.

The hall descended into chaos.

The air was filled with the sounds of suffering.

Isabella watched the models fall around her.

A deep frown etched onto her face.

‘This isn’t good,’ she thought. ‘Trouble is here.’
###Chapter 121

Within seconds, everyone collapsed to the floor in agony.

Victoria Kensington was among them. She writhed on the ground, clutching her stomach weakly. Her cries were pitiful. "It hurts... Please, someone help..." Beads of sweat covered her forehead. Her suffering appeared genuine.

The event organizers sprang into action. Archibald Worthington barked orders. "Cut the music! Get medical assistance now!"

The background music ceased abruptly. Assistants rushed to reorganize the stage. They leveled the platforms that were previously set at varying heights.

Isabella Montgomery moved first. She approached the nearest model kneeling beside her. It was Genevieve Laurent! Genevieve had curled into a fetal position. She glared at Isabella with pure hatred. But the pain was too severe. She couldn't form any words.

Isabella reached out. She checked Genevieve's forehead. She felt for a pulse.

Genevieve's assistant saw this and shoved Isabella away. "Who do you think you are? A doctor? Get away from her!"

The push caught Isabella off balance. She fell to the floor. She didn't seem bothered. She sat casually, one leg bent. Her hand rested loosely on her knee. "Relax. It's acute food poisoning. Halophilic bacteria. It'll pass in two days."

Camille Laurent didn't understand the medical terms. She saw Isabella's calm demeanor and snapped. "You're not in any pain! Look at them! They're suffering!"

"Exactly. Stop pretending you know anything. Just shut up," another assistant joined in, this one from Seraphina Delacroix's team. The hostility toward Isabella was palpable.

Nathaniel Blackwood had already coordinated with the organizers. He ensured the audience was escorted out. His gaze found Isabella. He turned to Sebastian Blackwood. "Go. Check on them. Now."

"Why? It's not my sister-in-law who's sick. Don't you have other doctors for this?" Sebastian teased, remaining seated. He was a doctor but notoriously selective with patients.

Nathaniel's voice was low. "That's precisely why it's complicated."

Sebastian's smirk vanished. He understood the implication. He rushed forward immediately. He examined each supermodel, noting their symptoms. His expression turned grave. "It's acute food poisoning. Caused by halophilic bacteria."

Camille heard the term again. "What is halophilic bacteria?"

"Vibrio parahaemolyticus," Sebastian explained professionally. "A gram-negative bacillus. Thrives in salty environments. Can survive over forty-seven days in seawater. Causes severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. It's a popular choice on the black market. Tasteless. Easy to store. Not lethal, but excruciatingly painful."

A wave of shock passed through the group. "So this wasn't accidental? We were poisoned on purpose?"

"Who... who would do this to all of us?"

"We barely ate anything today..."

The models lay weakly in their assistants' arms, murmuring their fears. Suddenly, Seraphina Delacroix gasped. "The strawberries... We all ate the strawberries..."

Strawberries!

"That's right! Beatrice Holloway brought them..."

"But we all ate them. Why is Isabella completely fine?" Isadora Vasquez's weak voice cut through the murmurs.

Every eye in the room turned to Isabella. Amid the chaos of contorted, crying faces, she alone sat composed and unaffected. She looked utterly unperturbed.

Victoria's face paled. She quickly turned to Isadora. "Don't say such things! It can't be my sister! I know we've had our issues, but she would never do this!"

"You're right..." Isadora replied meekly.

But the seed of suspicion was planted. The other models had heard. Their distrust grew visibly. Seraphina Delacroix glared at Isabella, her voice accusing. "Isabella. It was you... You did this! Didn't you? Because we all bullied you! This is your revenge!"
###Chapter 122

“It’s absolutely her! She planned this humiliation all along!” Victoria Kensington’s voice was a venomous hiss. Pain twisted her features into something grotesque.

Isabella Montgomery met the accusing stares without flinching. A cold clarity washed over her. Now she understood Victoria’s sudden interest in the Auto Show. This was a meticulously laid trap. Every poisoned model pointed a finger directly at her…

Her expression remained unreadable. “Accusations require evidence,” she stated, her voice cutting through the tension. “Without it, you’re committing slander. I will not hesitate to pursue legal action.” Her tone was ice, leaving no room for argument.

A collective gasp rippled through the room. Victoria feigned weakness, her voice a fragile whisper. “She’s right… We need proof. I know my sister… She could never do this.” She then turned pleading eyes toward Nathaniel Blackwood and Archibald Worthington. “Mr. Blackwood, Mr. Worthington… Everyone is still here. The investigation must start immediately.”

“The strawberries were eaten recently. Evidence might still be found. The container… other clues… Please, call the police. We must clear my sister’s name…” She coughed violently, pretending to fight through agony for Isabella’s sake.

Gabriella Martinez rushed to support her. “Victoria, don’t speak! Save your strength!”

Isabella suppressed an eye-roll. The performance was nauseating. A wolf playing the sacrificial lamb. This move was clever. It discredited Isabella and simultaneously won the sympathy of the other models.

Seraphina Delacroix’s agent shouted, “Yes, involve the police! Find who did this to my Seraphina!”

“We demand justice!” another model cried out.

Eunice Kerr’s replacement, Genevieve Laurent, glared at Nathaniel. “This happened at your event! If you protect the guilty party, our fans will ruin you!”

Nathaniel’s face darkened. His gaze turned dangerously cold. “The police will be called. Not because of your threats. But to find the truth.” His piercing eyes briefly landed on Victoria, seeing through her facade. He gave a slight nod to his assistant, Julian Prescott, who immediately pulled out his phone.

A chill ran down Victoria’s spine. Nathaniel’s gaze always felt like it could strip her soul bare. Could he know? ‘No. Impossible,’ she reassured herself. Her plan was flawless. Days of meticulous preparation left no trace. The police would find nothing pointing to her. Everything would lead back to Isabella.

‘Just wait, Isabella. Your future is behind bars,’ she thought, a hidden smirk forming behind her mask of pain. She bowed her head, pretending to be overcome by illness.

The police arrived swiftly after the call. A thorough investigation commenced backstage and in the main hall. Everyone who touched the strawberries was a suspect. Test strips were used on fingertips to detect poison residue.

Nothing was found.

Suddenly, Gabriella blurted out, “Isabella must be tested too! She handled the strawberries first! She had the perfect opportunity—”

“Gabriella! Stop!” Victoria frantically tried to pull her back, putting on a show. “Don’t listen to her! She’s talking nonsense! My sister is not a suspect! She doesn’t need to be tested…”

Officer Donovan Pierce stepped forward, test strip in hand. “Anyone who had contact will be tested.” He moved toward Isabella. A sense of foreboding settled in her gut…
###Chapter 123

Isabella Montgomery was forced into a chair. Her eyes widened as Officer Donovan Pierce approached.

He extended the test strip toward her. "Ms. Montgomery," he instructed, "briefly pinch this with your fingers."

The strip was partially damp, embedded with complex components. Any trace of halophilic bacteria on her skin would trigger a color change from white to purple.

The crowd turned on her, voices sharp with accusation. "You claimed innocence! Hurry up and do it!"

"Where's that arrogance now? Prove it!"

"Scared? We need to see the results!"

The taunts grew into a deafening roar. Cornered, Isabella had no choice. She reached out. Her fingers squeezed the strip.

It turned purple immediately.

She was guilty. The evidence was on her fingertips.

"I knew it! It's her! She's pure evil!"

"Just over some petty arguments? How could she poison us?"

"She's a viper! You'll pay for our medical bills! And our trauma! And our lost wages!"

The models erupted in fury, hurling abuse. Nathaniel Blackwood watched, his brow furrowed. This was unexpected. The cunning Isabella Montgomery, trapped?

Yet, she sat perfectly composed. A cold smile touched her red lips. Victoria had outdone herself this time. The plan was clever.

Isabella deduced the poison was on the juice bottle Veronica had handed her. She had contaminated her own hand disposing of it.

Since they wanted to play this game, she would play. And she would make it interesting.

Officer Pierce produced handcuffs. "Ms. Montgomery, you are under arrest for the intentional poisoning of your colleagues. Come with us."

"Fine," she replied, her tone breezy. She stood in one fluid motion. A swish of her long hair. She walked toward the police car, her steps confident, her aura undiminished.

She didn't look like a criminal being arrested. She looked like a CEO heading to a board meeting.

The crowd stared, baffled. No explanations? No denials? What was happening?

"She's scared stiff with the evidence," someone muttered.

The officers ignored them and got into the car. Victoria struggled to her feet, feigning weakness. "No... This is a mistake. It can't be my sister... She isn't capable of this. Please, don't take her."

"Victoria," Gabriella reasoned, "the evidence is right there. Why defend her? She's just an adopted orphan. Who knows what kind of criminals her real parents were!"

Victoria clutched Gabriella's shirt, her performance flawless. "Gabriella, I know her. She's not like that. Please, call Mother and Father. Have them hire the best detectives. Find the truth!"

Her face was a mask of frantic worry, perfectly convincing. Gabriella played her part with equal skill. It was a masterclass in deception.

The police car began to pull away.
###Chapter 124

The car door slammed shut.

Chris let out a piercing scream.

He bolted forward, tiny legs pumping furiously. "Mommy! Mommy!"

Nathaniel scooped him up in one swift motion. A large hand covered the boy's mouth, muffling the desperate cries.

He carried the struggling child through the main doors. The police car was already gone, vanished into the city streets.

Chris thrashed violently. He sank his teeth into Nathaniel's hand with all his strength.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. He didn't release his grip. He shoved the boy into the backseat and slammed the car door.

The interior fell silent except for choked sobs. Chris realized they were alone. No bodyguards. No driver.

Tears streamed down his face. "Daddy! Why? Why did you stop me? Mommy needs us! She's innocent! I know she is!"

His small fists pounded against Nathaniel's chest. "Did you stop loving her? You're a traitor! A monster!"

Nathaniel caught the flailing hands. His voice was low and firm. "Enough. The authorities are handling this. What exactly did you plan to do?"

"I...I would have thought of something! I couldn't just watch them take her!" Chris wailed, his body shaking with grief.

"She wasn't taken," Nathaniel stated calmly. "She went with them willingly. There's a difference."

Chris sniffled loudly, confusion replacing some of the anger. "Huh?"

"Think," Nathaniel said, his tone softening slightly. "Remember all the other times? The impossible situations your mother has escaped?"

Chris nodded slowly, a flicker of hope in his wet eyes. "Mommy always fixes everything. She's amazing." His voice dropped to a worried whisper. "But this time...there's evidence. Real evidence. And it's a serious crime. How can she get out of this?"

"Trust her," Nathaniel replied, his gaze steady. "Has she ever truly failed you? Be quiet now. I will take you to see her."

"Okay," Chris whispered, wiping his face on his sleeve. Nathaniel sighed inwardly. Parenting was exhausting. First, he needed to check on Isabella.

The story exploded across every major news outlet within the hour.

[12 INTERNATIONAL SUPERMODELS POISONED.]

The headline screamed. [Initial reports indicate a backstage dispute led designer Isabella Montgomery to poison twelve supermodels. The victims include global sensation Seraphina Delacroix, America's sweetheart Victoria Kensington, and fiery French model Genevieve Laurent. All twelve received immediate medical attention. While Victoria Kensington has remained silent, the other eleven models are demanding a public apology, criminal charges, and fifty million dollars in individual compensation.]

[Mercedes representative Archibald Worthington issued a statement condemning Isabella Montgomery for sabotaging their annual auto show. The company is seeking no less than eighty million dollars in damages. Legal experts note that malicious poisoning causing significant bodily harm carries a potential three-year prison sentence.]

The comment sections boiled over with rage.

[She's a monster! How could anyone do this?]

[What a vile heart! A simple argument and she resorts to poison?]

[Her beauty is clearly only skin deep. A truly evil woman. I bet this isn't the first time!]

[That face hides a demon! Vicious! Cruel! Lock her up and throw away the key! I'm so angry!]

The internet had convicted her. The combined fury of twelve fan armies flooded Isabella's social media, burying any support under an avalanche of hate. Her reputation was shattered.

At the police precinct, Officer Donovan Pierce motioned toward a holding cell.

Isabella didn't move. "You're detaining me based solely on trace residue on my hands? What if I brushed against a contaminated surface? What if someone transferred it there during a handshake while I was distracted?"

Her voice was cool, analytical. "A conviction requires a complete chain of evidence. Have you located the source of the poison? Found the container it was held in? Obtained a confession from me?"

The distant hum of a vacuum cleaner echoed in the hallway.

Officer Pierce frowned, irritation flashing in his eyes. "You were cooperative at the scene. Why the sudden change? What game are you playing now?"
###Chapter 125

Isabella Montgomery met Officer Donovan Pierce’s gaze with unwavering seriousness. “To clarify, I am merely a suspect at this stage. I should be held in a detention room, not a prison cell.”

Donovan was taken aback by her precise knowledge of legal procedure. Everything she stated was factually correct. He nodded stiffly. “Escort her to a holding room.”

She was led into a sterile white space. It was a significant improvement over a cell. A metal-framed bed stood against one wall. A basic but clean lavatory was tucked in the corner.

The door clicked locked behind her. Isabella showed no concern. She moved with casual grace, surveying her temporary quarters before settling on the bed. Her gaze dropped to her hands. A faint, knowing smile touched her lips. ‘Go ahead, Victoria. Make your move while you can. The finale won’t be satisfying otherwise.’

A sharp rap echoed at the door. “Isabella Montgomery. You have visitors.”

She glanced toward the sound. Victoria Kensington, Eleanor Kensington, and Richard Montgomery stood outside. Isabella closed her eyes, dismissing their presence entirely. They entered without waiting for permission.

Eleanor’s voice cut through the quiet. “Isabella! How could you commit such a vile act? Poison the others if you must, but your own sister? Bringing you into our home was the gravest mistake! The shame you’ve brought upon us is immeasurable. And you just lie there! Get up and apologize to Victoria immediately!”

Isabella’s eyes remained shut. She offered no response.

Richard’s fury boiled over. He snatched a glass of water from a nearby table and hurled it. The cold liquid splashed across Isabella’s face before she could react.

Her eyes flew open. She rose from the bed in one fluid motion. Her expression was glacial, her eyes gleaming with a predator’s ruthless light.

Richard flinched under her stare, momentarily stunned. He quickly regained his composure, rage burning hotter. “Still no remorse! The Montgomery family wasted twenty-three years on you! If you refuse to confess and apologize to everyone you’ve harmed, we will publicly disown you. We will cut all ties and exile you from Westchester!”

Victoria’s eyes glittered with concealed triumph. If Isabella was cast out, her fifteen percent family shares would default to Victoria. She quickly moved forward, clutching Isabella’s hand with feigned concern. “Sister, please! Explain yourself to them! Tell them you’re innocent! I know you didn’t do this!”

“Remove your lying, pathetic face from my sight. Stop pretending to be a saint,” Isabella’s voice was a sharp, cold blade. Her gaze pinned Victoria in place.

Victoria recoiled, snatching her hand back. Her heart hammered against her ribs. Even locked up, Isabella’s presence was terrifyingly potent. This was a new level of fury.

Victoria retreated to the far side of the bed, her expression expertly crafted into one of profound hurt. Anyone watching would think she was the victim here.

Isabella seethed internally. The sight of Victoria’s manipulations fueled her anger.

Eleanor pulled Victoria protectively closer. “Victoria, stop. Don’t waste your kindness on her. Look at her defiance. She is utterly shameless! Stay away from her from now on. She is no sister of yours. She doesn’t deserve your compassion!”

Richard glowered at Isabella, his rage palpable. “Since you refuse to admit your guilt, don’t blame us for our severity. I will convene a shareholders’ meeting immediately. You will be expelled from the Montgomery family! I will have you driven out of Westchester!” With that, he and Eleanor hurriedly escorted a seemingly distraught Victoria from the room, as if the place itself contaminated her.

Without missing a beat, Isabella’s voice followed them, cool and clear. “Do take care. I won’t be seeing you out.”

Their steps faltered, shoulders stiffening with renewed anger before they quickened their pace. Silence reclaimed the room. Isabella picked up a tissue and calmly wiped the water from her face.
###Chapter 126

Isabella stared at the damp tissue in her palm. Her expression turned icy cold. Victoria always managed to deceive Theodore and Sophia. She had them completely under her control. Isabella could never compete in that regard. She couldn't pretend or manipulate like Victoria did. She lost because she refused to sink to Victoria's level of wickedness.

But soon, very soon, she would expose Victoria's true nature to everyone. After drying her face completely, she glanced at her outfit. Fortunately, she wore leather today. It repelled the water easily.

Isabella was about to lie down when footsteps echoed outside. She looked up to see a tall figure and a small one at her door. Nathaniel and Oliver stood there.

"Leave. I need to rest," she stated flatly. She then lay on the cot, turning away from them. Her current situation was precarious. Their association could drag them down with her. Furthermore, she had resolved to maintain her distance. The Auto Show had been their only connection. That event was over now. Their interactions should end as well.

Ignoring her dismissal, Nathaniel entered with Oliver. He closed the door firmly behind them. "Isabella," he said directly, "if you agree, I can hire the top private investigators. The best lawyers in the world."

"Don't waste your efforts. Stay out of this," Isabella replied, her eyes still shut.

Nathaniel sensed her emotional distance. He frowned, frustrated. He glanced at Oliver and gave a slight nod. Oliver understood immediately. He rushed toward Isabella's cot.

"Mommy! Mommy!" Oliver cried, leaping onto her. "I missed you so much! I was so worried! Sniff... When they took you away, I cried until my eyes swelled. Mommy, please hold me? Please? I really, really missed you."

Isabella had no time to react before Oliver buried himself in her arms. His pleading, adorable voice filled her ears. She sat up, gently pushing his small arms away. "Oliver, go back with your father. You shouldn't be here visiting me." A child shouldn't be exposed to a place like this.

But Oliver clung to her stubbornly. His little head pressed against her chest. "No! I won't leave! Mommy isn't bad! I want to stay with mommy! Daddy and I believe in you! Someone else set you up! I know you would never do that!" His voice was firm. His eyes shone with absolute faith.

Isabella's heart softened instantly. Since the incident began, no one had trusted her. Everyone looked at her with suspicion and judgment. Even her own parents assumed her guilt. They scolded her without letting her explain.

And now, this little boy declared his belief in her. She knew Nathaniel must have coached him. Which meant... Nathaniel believed her too.

They had known each other for such a short time. They shared no blood relation. Yet he chose to trust her... A bitter irony washed over her, mixed with another, warmer feeling she couldn't name.

She gently pinched Oliver's soft cheeks. "If you believe I'm innocent, then go home. Wait for my news. I'll be out very soon."

"Really?" Oliver's eyes sparkled with hope. "You have a special plan to get out? Like when Superman defeats the monsters? Right?"

Isabella nodded. "Yes, exactly like that. So Oliver needs to go home. Don't mess up my big plan, okay?"

"But I want to stay with you. You'll be scared here alone, right? It's so cold in this room..." Oliver looked around the bleak space. His face fell. Tears welled in his sorrowful eyes.

Just then, Dominic entered carrying a large bag of supplies. There was food, toiletries, and other essentials. He also held an enormous white rabbit pillow.

Nathaniel took the nearly two-meter-long pillow. He handed it to Isabella personally. "Take this. I'll bring Oliver home now."

Isabella was speechless. She stared at the childish pillow. Was he seriously expecting her to accept this?
###Chapter 127

Isabella really didn't want to take the rabbit pillow. But seeing Oliver was about to cling to her again, she reached out and accepted it with a sigh. "Alright, you can go now."

Only after she took the pillow did Nathaniel leave with Oliver, his movements elegant and composed. Isabella stared at the oversized rabbit pillow in her arms. Suddenly, the underground detention cell didn't feel quite as cold anymore.

She hugged the pillow and lay back down on the bed, trying to relax. But her mind kept flashing images of Eleanor and Victoria's cold, indifferent faces. They contrasted sharply with Oliver's and Nathaniel's trusting expressions. The two scenes were as different as night and day.

A tiny crack had formed in her icy heart. It was spreading slowly, almost imperceptibly growing wider... The detention room was bitterly cold, but the world outside was in complete chaos.

Not far from the police station, Maxwell, Harrison, and a few others stood in a tight circle. Many unfamiliar faces were also present, all taking turns discussing the situation.

"We need to find a way to get the Boss out."

"I say we just break her out of jail!"

"Should we blow the whole place up?"

"Maybe we should bring in an expert to handle this."

"The best solution is to involve Kirk. He can solve this and help the Boss! He'd be thrilled to help!"

As soon as someone said that, everyone pulled out their phones, ready to take action. Julian rushed over and said coolly, "Everyone, go home and wait calmly for news."

"Huh? Why should we? Julian, why are you so unconcerned about the Boss? You've worked together for five years! You should be the most worried about her!" Maxwell said, his face full of confusion.

Julian's expression turned serious. "She went in willingly. Besides, she has her own strategy. No one is allowed to ruin her plan!"

"Plan? No way! Is it like what she did at the Auto Show? Or that time at the Guci showdown? Does she have a plan to turn the tables?" someone asked.

"Exactly. This time, when her plan succeeds, it will draw blood. Just wait and see," Julian replied.

Everyone there started to feel excited and cheered. "Hurray! The Boss has a plan! This is the best news!"

"Why did the Boss tell you her plans and not us? Does she like you?"

Julian froze. 'Why would she like me?'

He glanced at the luxury cars driving away in the distance, pushed away his inappropriate feelings, and responded indifferently, "You talk too much. Do you want to lose your tongue? Everyone, go home. Don't you dare ruin her plan! If you do, I won't let any of you get away!"

"Yes, yes, yes, the Boss's husband!" the crowd teased as they dispersed.

The scene went unnoticed by the wider world. Meanwhile, the entire internet was still hurling abuse at Isabella, growing more aggressive by the hour. Gabriella even hired someone to release a video. In the video, Isabella could be seen picking up the strawberry. When she thought no one was looking, she sneakily tossed it into a nearby trash can. The internet exploded with fury!

Isabella must have planted the poison. Why else wouldn't she eat the strawberry? Why else would she secretly throw it away? It was unbelievable! Evil-hearted! Scheming b*tch!

Within two days, news of the 12 poisoned models had spread globally. It was inevitable, given the number of famous models involved. Isabella was also a well-known, wealthy female CEO. Her popularity was sky-high. Even people who didn't follow entertainment gossip knew all about it.

Isabella had become a vicious murderer in the public's eyes. Conversely, a video of Victoria defending Isabella also went viral online. As the only one of the 12 models who believed in Isabella, she was hailed as the number one kind-hearted angel.
###Chapter 128

Victoria Kensington hadn't slept properly in days.

The case remained unresolved without Isabella Montgomery's confession.

Without airtight, irrefutable evidence, the loopholes kept the investigation open.

Isabella's refusal to admit guilt left Victoria constantly on edge.

She couldn't shake the fear that Isabella might suddenly turn the tables.

This situation demanded immediate resolution.

Victoria grabbed her phone and texted Isadora Vasquez.

"Handle it now. Pressure the eleven supermodels to escalate the case."

Those supermodels were notoriously arrogant and hot-tempered.

They'd never tolerated newcomers stealing their spotlight.

They undoubtedly harbored deep resentment toward Isabella.

They'd witnessed her stunning performance at the Auto Show.

Failing to crush her now would threaten their future dominance.

Under Isadora's instigation, all models gathered at the police station.

They demanded Isabella immediately confess her crimes.

They insisted she sign compensation agreements.

They required public apologies from her.

Victoria and Isadora drove toward the station together.

Inside the car, Isadora asked with concern, "What did Theodore Montgomery say? Did he agree to expel Isabella from the family?"

"That stubborn old fool," Victoria spat out angrily. "He insists he believes Isabella. He won't even discuss it unless she's proven guilty!"

Isadora offered reassurance. "Don't anger yourself. The outcome is inevitable. It's merely a timing issue."

Their conversation ended as the car arrived.

Dozens of fans and reporters swarmed outside the station.

Global media outlets covered the unfolding scandal.

A satisfied smile curled Victoria's lips.

Isadora was correct. Victory was assured.

The situation had exploded beyond control.

Current evidence made reversal nearly impossible for Isabella.

Victoria stepped out of the car.

Reporters immediately surrounded her, shoving microphones forward.

"How much compensation are you seeking?"

"What's the Montgomery family's stance on Isabella's poisoning scandal?"

Victoria had applied makeup to appear exceptionally pale.

She'd subtly reddened her eyes to simulate sleeplessness.

She faced the cameras with a pained expression. "I've stated repeatedly. My sister didn't plant that poison. She isn't that kind of person. She's being framed. Please, let me through. I've hired the best lawyer for her. He'll arrive shortly."

She and Isadora pushed through the crowd together.

Admiring sighs followed them. "All other models are furious, but Victoria alone still believes her. She's too kind-hearted."

"Truly the number one pure-hearted goddess. After all these years, she remains spotless and innocent."

"It's baffling. Both are from the Montgomery family. How did Victoria become so lovely while Isabella turned so wicked?"

Victoria's heart swelled with smug satisfaction at the praise.

Externally, she maintained her mask of concerned kindness.

After today, Isabella would have no escape from her predicament.

Inside the detention room, all eleven supermodels had gathered.

Their assistants and lawyers crowded the space, creating chaos.

Policemen formed a human barricade to prevent physical altercations.

Nearly thirty people pointed accusing fingers at Isabella.

They shouted demands simultaneously. "You evil poisoner! Apologize to us now! Compensate us for lost work and psychological trauma!"

"Admit your guilt! Stop pretending! We know you did it!"

Isabella sat on the bed, leaning against the wall.

Her eyes remained closed in meditation throughout the commotion.

Suddenly, a soft voice cut through the noise. "Everyone, please quiet down. I'm Victoria Kensington. Isabella's older sister. I believe she's innocent. Let me speak..."

Isabella's eyes finally opened.

'The fake bitch has arrived,' she thought. 'The real show begins now.'
###Chapter 129

The moment Victoria appeared, the models surged forward like a tidal wave.

“The evidence is overwhelming! How can anyone still defend her?”

“She must pay for our losses! Ten million per model is non-negotiable!”

“As her sister, make her confess! We’ll sue and get her blacklisted industry-wide!”

Their voices merged into a furious chorus. Victoria’s gaze drifted toward Isabella, her lips pressed into a thin, apologetic line.

“My sister has a point,” she said softly. “The evidence is circumstantial. Traces of poison on her fingers could’ve come from accidental contact.”

Eunice scoffed loudly. “Then explain why she didn’t eat the strawberry! Why throw it away?”

All eyes locked onto Isabella. “Yes! Explain yourself!”

“Why is she the only one with poison residue?”

“Enough talk! She’s just stalling. Let’s sue her now! Boycott all her companies!”

Lawyers were already being summoned, phones pressed to ears as legal threats circulated.

Victoria approached Isabella with feigned concern. “Just compensate them first. We can sort out the truth later.”

“So you endorse extorting ten million from the ‘culprit’?” Isabella’s voice cut through the noise like ice.

Victoria stiffened. The question felt like a trap.

“If you’re responsible,” she said carefully, “compensation is reasonable. These are top models losing millions per day. Ten million is generous.”

Eunice sneered. “Be grateful we’re not demanding more!”

Isabella scanned the room. “You all agree? Ten million each? No regrets?”

“Just pay up!” they shouted in unison.

“Fine,” Isabella said. “But I can’t access funds while detained. The court ruling is in two days. My lawyer will distribute compensation then.”

“You’re lying!” Eunice spat.

Isabella ignored her. She produced a notepad and scrawled a contract: ‘The agreed compensation is $10 million per model, payable upon court verdict.’

She coated her thumb in crimson lipstick and pressed it firmly onto the paper.

“Your turn,” she said, passing the document around.

“Why do we need to sign?” Eunice protested.

Isabella’s smile was razor-sharp. “So you don’t suddenly decide to double the price tomorrow. Press your thumbprints. All of you.”

The models hesitated, unnerved by her commanding presence. She was the accused, yet she held the room in her thrall.
###Chapter 130

Each supermodel had no choice but to comply, pressing their thumbprints onto the document.

The paper reached Victoria last. She hesitated, studying it with suspicion. Her eyes scanned the conditions Isabella had written, sensing something unusual. But since Isabella had agreed to the terms, what could possibly go wrong? Besides, this guarantee letter would be perfect to present to her grandfather…

Victoria steeled herself and pressed her thumb onto the paper. In total, twelve copies of the guarantee letter were made, one for each model. They collected their documents and quickly departed.

Victoria was the final one to exit. She cast a look toward Isabella. "Sister, it's only one hundred ten million. That's not a significant amount for you. Don't be too upset. Besides, if you learn from this and courageously admit your fault, everyone will forgive you. Even if they don't, you're incredibly wealthy. You'll be fine without a career in entertainment."

"You talk too much. Leave now, whether you're finished or not," Isabella retorted, rolling her eyes. She moved to the bed and lay down. Her expression was icy, devoid of any warmth, like a frozen winter lake.

Victoria clenched her fists, her eyes filled with contempt. She thought, 'Isabella is detained and hated by the entire world. How can she still act so arrogantly? I can't wait to see how long her savage attitude lasts!'

Externally, Victoria maintained a concerned facade due to the police presence. "Sister, rest well tonight. I'm leaving now," she said softly before exiting and entering her car.

Inside the vehicle, her sweet demeanor vanished instantly, replaced by a smug, malicious grin. Gabriella drove while asking, "Now that you have this document, will Theodore Senior really revoke Isabella's shares?"

"He has always favored Isabella, so of course he won't. That's why I need you to do something else," Victoria replied, then proceeded to give Gabriella a detailed set of instructions.

That same day, the headline [Isabella Confesses! Guilty As Charged!] trended globally. Genevieve had leaked the guarantee letter to the press, complete with Isabella's thumbprint signature. Since the letter stated Isabella agreed to pay ten million in compensation to each supermodel, even her remaining supporters abandoned her.

The internet exploded with venom and hatred directed at Isabella.

[That monster finally admits her guilt! She's agreed to pay up!]

[She really did poison those twelve models! How vicious! She's a wicked, despicable person!]

[Honestly, what stood out to me was how sweet Victoria is! She's the only one not demanding compensation. From all the video footage, she treats Isabella so well.]

[Victoria is Isabella's sister, so refusing money is natural. But I wonder if Isabella will actually pay when the court rules.]

[You're right. I have a feeling she's planning an escape. Why else not pay today?]

[We just have to watch the court proceedings the day after tomorrow. We must ensure this evil woman pays!]

The online abuse was relentless. Meanwhile, the Montgomery family faced their own crisis. Isabella's fifteen percent family shares were part of the Montgomery Group. Her confession triggered a massive plunge in the company's market value. Overnight, share prices hit rock bottom!

Within three days, the Montgomery family shares lost billions in value! The entire family gathered in the main hall, chaos erupting. At that moment, Theodore Senior was kneeling in the chapel, deep in prayer. Suddenly, Reginald rushed in, frantic and anxious. "Senior Montgomery! Senior Montgomery! We have a problem! All the shareholders are outside, demanding you revoke all of Ms. Isabella's shares immediately!"
###Chapter 131

Theodore Montgomery held complete ownership of all shares. He alone determined their distribution among his descendants. Yet ten additional investors held stakes in the Montgomery Group. These individuals were not family. They provided crucial technical expertise and capital. Their agreements guaranteed annual profit-sharing percentages. But they cared nothing for equity control. Their interest began and ended with financial returns.

Decades prior, Theodore had established these terms personally. The Montgomery Group’s very foundation relied on this profit-sharing structure. Their contracts were ironclad. If these investors stirred trouble now, the consequences would be catastrophic. A falling stock price was manageable. Total operational collapse was not. Theodore’s brow furrowed deeply. “Are every single one of them here?”

“All of them, sir,” Reginald Thornton confirmed. “And that is not the worst of it. The entire extended family has arrived as well.” A rising clamor of voices echoed from the hall. Theodore set his prayer book aside. He rose slowly, massaging his stiff knees. He moved toward the door with deliberate steps.

Penelope Sinclair spotted him first. She rushed forward, her expression severe. “Father, that adopted girl confessed everything! Why shield her still? She accused Sophia Kensington of vile intentions. But let’s be clear—Isabella Montgomery is no saint herself!”

“Our family’s losses are monumental because of her!” Gregory Kensington shouted, his face flushed with anger. “She must be removed from the Board immediately! She must return the fifteen percent of shares she holds!”

The chorus of voices swelled in agreement. “Return the shares! Remove her from the Board! Sever all connections with her!”

Theodore’s expression was grave, his voice steady but weary. “Has the investigation concluded? Have the police issued any official statement?”

“She signed a guarantee!” a shareholder yelled. “A written promise to cover all losses within two days!”

The deep lines on Theodore’s face seemed to have multiplied. He appeared to have aged years in just days. Victoria Kensington watched him closely. She moved quickly to his side, offering her arm for support. “Grandfather, I am so sorry. I truly believed my sister was set up. I exhausted every resource trying to help her these past two days. I pleaded with the eleven supermodels. They were utterly inflexible. They forced this guarantee from her…”

Victoria presented the document. Theodore recognized Isabella’s handwriting instantly. He recoiled, stumbling backward. Victoria held him firmly, her voice a soft, comforting murmur. “Don’t worry, Grandfather. I will not let my sister bear this financial ruin alone. You mustn’t distress yourself. And please, do not fear for Isabella’s future. Her diamond mines remain. She will never want for money. Even after… her release… she will live comfortably.”

“The priority is cutting her ties to this family,” Victoria pressed on, her tone shifting to one of urgent concern. “We must stabilize the Group’s stock. We must also protect her from the public’s hatred! So many people despise her now. Their anger could turn violent. We cannot predict what they might do.”

Eleanor Kensington nodded in vigorous agreement. “Father, if you care for her at all, you will take the shares. For her own safety. This mob mentality… it’s dangerous. Someone might harm her if she remains connected to us.”

Theodore’s face darkened further. A profound worry etched itself onto his features. He understood the viperous nature of the crowd before him. If this continued, they would show Isabella no mercy. Their vengeance would be swift and brutal.

A heavy, resigned sigh escaped him. “Very well. Do as you have decided. In two days, I will have Atticus Whitmore, our lawyer, meet with Isabella. He will handle the transfer of her shares.” Having spoken, Theodore turned away. He retreated back toward the quiet solitude of the prayer hall.

Victoria’s brow creased slightly. “Grandfather,” she called after him, “to whom will you transfer Isabella’s shares?”

Theodore paused at the threshold. He did not turn back. “To Richard Montgomery for the time being.” Then he disappeared inside, closing the heavy door firmly behind him.

A surge of pure triumph shot through Victoria. Richard Montgomery’s other children were perpetual disappointments. She was his sole favored daughter. Once those shares were in his possession, they would inevitably find their way to her. It was only a matter of time.

She allowed herself a small, victorious smile before schooling her features into concern. She addressed the closed door with honeyed sweetness. “A wise decision, Grandfather. Please, you must rest now. Do not let this trouble your heart. Isabella will be fine. Her diamond mines ensure she will never be poor.”

Theodore ignored the fading noises from the hall. He waited until silence prevailed. Then he crossed to a seemingly solid wall. His fingers found a hidden button, pressing it precisely. A section of the wall slid open noiselessly, revealing a concealed compartment. Inside rested a single, ornate picture frame. The name inscribed upon it was not Montgomery.
###Chapter 132

Theodore Montgomery stared at the silver-framed photograph.

His chest tightened with a heavy sigh.

"Even though I trust Isabella completely..."

His voice trailed off into the stillness of the room.

"The current circumstances leave no choice."

His fingers traced the edge of the frame.

"Removing her from the Montgomery legacy is the only protection I can offer."

He looked into the eyes captured in the portrait.

"You have my solemn vow."

His words carried the weight of decades.

"As long as I draw breath, she remains my granddaughter."

The declaration hung in the air.

"Shares or no shares."

Victoria Kensington never knew about the hidden photograph.

She floated from the study on a cloud of triumph.

The shareholders' approval echoed in her mind.

She cornered Richard Montgomery with a glittering smile.

"Congratulations, Father."

Her voice dripped with false sweetness.

"Largest shareholder of Montgomery Group."

She placed a possessive hand on his arm.

"Now you can provide even better for us."

Richard's face darkened instantly.

"Don't mention those two!"

His voice sharpened to a blade.

"Isabella sits in a cell."

He practically spat the words.

"And that worthless Benjamin hasn't been home in weeks."

His jaw clenched.

"Thinking about them boils my blood."

He focused on Victoria.

"You're the only one I trust now."

His gaze intensified.

"Drop some endorsements if you must."

A calculated pause.

"Help me rebuild the company's reputation."

He offered the ultimate carrot.

"My shares will be yours eventually."

Victoria feigned humility perfectly.

"I don't care about the shares, Daddy."

She laid it on thick.

"I only want to ease your burdens."

Her performance was flawless.

"I'll create new policies."

She promised the moon.

"I'll handle everything for you."

Richard nodded, thoroughly deceived.

"My true daughter."

He compared bitterly.

"A million times better than that adopted stray."

The press release hit every major outlet by noon.

Isabella Montgomery resided in South Africa for five years.

She held no operational role within Montgomery Group.

Shares were granted based on family status alone.

Due to her recent criminal actions...

The board has voted unanimously for removal.

All shares are hereby forfeited.

Montgomery Group severs all ties with Isabella Montgomery.

Her future actions are her own responsibility.

Public approval was immediate and overwhelming.

Twitter ignited with supportive comments.

Every local branch amplified the message.

Small towns received the news within hours.

Isabella's name became synonymous with poison.

Her reputation dissolved into mud.

Public favor evaporated completely.

She was utterly notorious.

The detention room held an unnatural quiet.

Isabella slept deeply on the narrow cot.

She showed no concern for the world outside.

Nathaniel Blackwood arrived with Oliver in tow.

The scene gave him immediate pause.

He gestured for Oliver to wait down the hall.

Nathaniel entered alone.

An exquisite lunch box weighed in his hand.

"Your trial is tomorrow."

His voice cut the silence.

"Are you truly prepared?"

Isabella didn't bother opening her eyes.

"Everything is handled."

Her tone remained flat.

Nathaniel's frown deepened.

Discomfort prickled under his skin.

"By Julian Hawthorne?"

The name felt like acid on his tongue.

"Is that who you mean?"

Isabella's eyes snapped open.

She caught his jealous tone immediately.

Nathaniel moved to her bedside.

"Eric."

He whispered the name.

Gravel laced with clear displeasure.

Isabella frowned at his possessiveness.

Why would he even care?

Julian hadn't visited once during her incarceration...

Nathaniel misread her silence completely.

His hands shot out abruptly.

He gripped her shoulders with sudden force.

He pulled her upright from the cot.
###Chapter 133

Nathaniel remained seated beside Isabella’s bed.

His gaze was fixed on her. “Anything Julian can do, I can do too,” he said. “Next time something like this happens, you should think of me first.”

His voice was low, but it carried an undeniable authority.

He held her shoulders firmly, their proximity making the air between them feel charged.

All she could breathe in was his distinct, masculine scent.

For reasons she couldn't explain, her heart began to race, thumping erratically in her chest.

She pushed his hands away. “If I ever star in a drama and need someone to play a human leech, I’ll definitely consider you.”

Nathaniel fell silent for a moment.

Then a faint smile touched his lips. “If you’re the female lead, I’ll do it for free. Consider it a friends-and-family discount.”

Isabella had no comeback.

Internally, she thought, ‘When he decides to be bold, he really has no shame.’

“Why are you here?” she asked. “I was about to go to sleep early.”

“I brought you dinner,” Nathaniel replied.

He stood and uncovered the food container, then placed it in front of her.

Inside were delicious-looking dishes arranged in playful cartoon shapes.

‘Did Oliver make this for me?’ she wondered.

Even though she’d already eaten, she accepted the meal. “Please thank Oliver for me.”

“That might be a bit difficult,” Nathaniel said, his brow furrowing.

Isabella continued eating while giving him a puzzled look.

“Oliver said he won’t accept thanks through someone else,” Nathaniel explained. “He wants to hear it from you in person. He’ll be waiting for you at the Blackwood Estate.”

Isabella nearly choked on her food.

‘They’re scheming to get me to the Blackwood Estate? This meal was a trap all along!’

Nathaniel smiled reassuringly. “Don’t worry, there are no wolves or tigers at the estate. Oliver has prepared a gift to celebrate your release. These past couple of days, he’s had no appetite and trouble sleeping. He misses you terribly.”

Hearing that, Isabella found it impossible to refuse.

“Fine,” she relented. “Once I’m out, I’ll make time to visit.”

Outside, Oliver leaped for joy. “Yes! Mommy is coming to our home as a guest! Daddy and Mommy can spend time together!”

Isabella heard a noise from outside. She frowned. “What was that? It sounds like someone’s out there.”

“No, it’s probably just… a mouse,” Nathaniel said quickly, glancing toward the door. He changed the subject. “Isabella, tomorrow is crucial. If you need any help, just ask.”

Tomorrow was the hearing date for her case.

The matter would finally be settled.

Everyone was waiting to see Isabella sentenced to prison.

All eleven models were anticipating the moment she would publicly apologize and pay them the promised compensation.

Reporters and netizens would flock to the courthouse to livestream the proceedings.

The slightest misstep could lead to severe consequences.

Yet Isabella continued eating the meal Oliver had prepared with apparent ease. “Relax,” she said. “My team can handle this small matter.”

‘Small matter…’ Nathaniel thought, bewildered.

Seeing her confidence, he decided not to press further. “Enjoy your food and get some rest tonight,” he said. “I’ll head back to help Momo prepare your gifts.”

His tone was calm and elegant, even though he was fussing over her a little.

Isabella watched him leave, a strange feeling stirring in her heart.

She could see he genuinely cared about her and wanted to see her again.

Over the past few days in detention, he had been the person she saw the most.

If only what happened five years ago hadn’t occurred… If that bastard hadn’t…

Just then, she thought she heard a faint voice from outside her room. “Daddy! You’re amazing!”
###Chapter 134

That voice…

It sounded so much like Oliver’s.

But he should be at home right now, preparing for my release. He should be too worried to sleep or eat. Maybe I’m just hearing things…

Isabella Montgomery shook her head slightly.

She cleaned up the area after finishing her meal. It was late. She didn’t expect any more visitors tonight.

Click. Clack. Click. Clack.

The sharp sound of high heels echoed down the hall. Each step was confident and aggressive. It revealed the wearer’s strong personality.

The door swung open.

Isabella looked up.

A woman stood in the doorway. She wore a deep burgundy dress suit. Her hair was a mass of voluminous curls. She exuded an air of power and competence.

It was Genevieve Beaumont.

Isabella gave her a quick glance. Then she turned away, completely ignoring her.

Genevieve stepped inside and shut the door. Her eyes swept the room with obvious disdain.

“I never thought the famous diamond boss would end up in a place like this,” she said coldly. “I warned you. The entertainment industry isn’t as simple as you believed.”

“You made a fortune in business. But here, without guidance, you’re easily crushed.”

Isabella acted as if she heard nothing. She carefully washed the fine food container. Then she dried her hands with a tissue.

Genevieve was irritated by her arrogance. She forced herself to stay calm.

“Isabella, honestly, I admire you,” she said, changing her tone. “Your ability to turn situations around has always impressed me. Sign with me. I can solve all your current problems. I guarantee you’ll become a top star in Westchester. What do you say?”

Isabella tossed the tissue away. She walked to the bed and sat down. She leaned back against the headboard lazily. Her expression was cool and detached. She radiated an aloof, uninterested energy.

Genevieve finally lost her patience.

“Isabella! I’m talking to you!” she snapped. “Are you even listening? You’re at rock bottom. I came here to help you. How dare you be so disrespectful!”

“Let me make this clear. No one else can save you but me. Signing with me is your only chance!”

“Huh?” Isabella raised an eyebrow. She looked directly at Genevieve. “Who are you?”

Who are you?

The question was like a slap.

Genevieve was stunned. She had just spent all that time pitching her offer. And Isabella didn’t even know who she was?

She was furious. She felt her blood pressure rising.

They had spoken on the phone before. Isabella had been dismissive then. But this was worse. This was a direct insult.

Genevieve was the PR Queen. Everyone in the industry knew her. How could Isabella not recognize her?

She was doing this on purpose.

Genevieve gritted her teeth.

“Isabella, what gives you the right to refuse me?” she hissed. “Do you not realize you’re being sentenced tomorrow? You’ll have to pay massive compensations. Have you thought about how you’ll live the rest of your life?”

“If you sign with me, you’ll be SilverPeak’s top star. You’ll not only be cleared of all charges, but you’ll also be famous across the city. If you choose to stay stubborn and ignorant, you’ll rot in jail!”

“The air in jail is probably hundreds of times fresher than at your SilverPeak Entertainment,” Isabella replied coolly. “Has no one ever told you that your breath stinks?”

She shot Genevieve a look of disgust. Then she scooted closer to the wall.

Genevieve was enraged. Her face twisted. Her hands clenched into fists.

“Isabella! I’m asking you one last time!” she yelled. “Will you be a fool, or will you sign with me? Don’t forget—in everyone’s eyes, you’re finished!”

“Your bad breath is truly extreme,” Isabella said calmly. “Here. Have one of these.”

She picked up a strip of chewing gum from beside her pillow. In one swift, sharp motion, she flung it directly at Genevieve.

Genevieve tried to dodge, but she was too slow.

The gum shot straight into her mouth. She choked and gagged.

“Ugh!” She frantically pulled the gum out. She glared at Isabella with pure hatred. “Isabella! Just you wait! I look forward to seeing how pathetic you are tomorrow!”

She turned on her heel and stormed out. The loud click-clack of her heels echoed through the detention center.

Outside the police station, Genevieve made a call.

“Get me ten influencers for tomorrow,” she ordered coldly. “Prepare them to livestream the hearing. Also, get me these things. I’ll make sure Isabella Montgomery never recovers from this.”
###Chapter 135

The courthouse was surrounded by a massive crowd before dawn even broke.

Clustered nearest the iron gates stood eleven supermodels, all waiting for their settlement checks.

They were also there to witness Isabella Montgomery's sentencing with their own eyes.

Victoria Kensington stood among them, clutching Gabriella Martinez's hand.

The Montgomery family lawyer, Atticus Whitmore, followed close behind them.

They were fully prepared to force Isabella to sign the share transfer documents.

Victoria secretly texted Alexander Whitmore, her heart swelling with triumph.

(Alexander my love, you can rest easy now. After today, those shares belong to us. You won't have to endure the humiliation of courting my sister any longer.)

Alexander was currently lounging on his sofa, swirling a glass of red wine.

His television was tuned to a live stream hosted by a popular internet celebrity.

A nagging doubt plagued him. 'With Nathaniel Blackwood's immense power and resources, would he truly allow Isabella to be imprisoned?'

'But how could even he save her now? The evidence against her is overwhelming. She has completely sealed her own fate.'

'To think Isabella was capable of such a vicious act. She dug her own grave. Who would want her after she gets out of prison in a few years?'

'I can't wait to see her arrogance finally shattered. Victoria is truly the kind and gentle one,' he mused.

He quickly typed a reply.

[My little angel, this is the final day. Ensure there are no mistakes. I will reward you handsomely tonight once our plan succeeds.]

Victoria read the message, a blissful smile gracing her lips.

Reporters suddenly swarmed her, shoving microphones in her face.

"Ms. Victoria, as Isabella's sister, what are your thoughts today? Do you have a message for the public?"

She hastily pocketed her phone, adopting a sorrowful expression.

"Even now, I find it hard to believe my sister is capable of such actions. I feel this must be a terrible misunderstanding."

"Perhaps the court will prove her innocence today! I will hold onto hope until the very last moment."

The crowd was moved by her words, gazing at her with admiration and respect.

Victoria truly embodied the nation's sweetheart, her heart seemingly pure and compassionate.

Dozens of internet celebrities and influencers had also arrived, capitalizing on the event.

They were all conducting live broadcasts, hyping up the spectacle for their audiences.

In a nearby secluded alley, a sleek black Maybach sat idling.

Nathaniel Blackwood and Oliver were in the back seat, while Sebastian was behind the wheel.

Oliver fidgeted nervously with a toy in his hands.

"Daddy! All the top streamers are here. Thirty-nine of them are live right now."

"The main broadcast channel already has over forty-three million viewers!"

Forty-three million. The number echoed in Nathaniel's mind.

That was equivalent to the viewership of major New Year's Eve specials.

A single misstep today would haunt her forever in the public eye.

He frowned, his voice tense. "Sebastian, any update on Julian Hawthorne's movements? Are his preparations secure?"

"Julian..." Sebastian sighed heavily. "He's been completely absorbed with his new agency, GoldenPhoenix Entertainment."

"He's been negotiating contracts for new artists all week. It doesn't appear he plans to come today."

Nathaniel's frown deepened. 'So Eric isn't the one assisting her? Perhaps it's Harrison Winslow? But Harrison is preoccupied with other matters.'

Despite Isabella's assurances, a deep unease settled in his gut.

"Prepare all necessary contingencies. Be ready to adapt to any situation immediately!" he ordered sharply.

"Understood!" Sebastian and Oliver responded in unison. Sebastian gave a firm nod.

Oliver's clear, childish voice rang with determination.

As the appointed hour approached, footsteps finally echoed from the end of the passageway.

"She's here! She's here!" a voice shouted loudly.

Instantly, every head turned toward the sound. All eyes focused on the approaching figure.
###Chapter 136

Isabella Montgomery approached with a police escort.

Her beige cotton dress appeared deceptively simple. The minimalist design radiated an intellectual elegance reminiscent of classical scholars.

At five-foot-seven, she towered over most spectators even in flat shoes.

Her gaze remained fixed ahead with detached composure. She moved with the unbothered grace of someone strolling through private gardens. Her demeanor showed no trace of impending legal judgment.

The crowd stirred at her arrival. Influencers aimed their phones while reporters snapped photographs.

Microphones thrust toward her as questions erupted.

"Isabella! Explain why you poisoned twelve top models! Was this some petty dispute?"

"Are you aware of the diplomatic implications? As a Diamond Boss and wealthiest woman, why model such terrible behavior?"

"Don't you owe the world an apology? Don't you have anything to say?"

Isabella ignored them completely. She treated the shouting crowd as insignificant background noise.

The officers flanking her into the courthouse seemed more like personal security. She commanded attention like a celebrity making a red carpet appearance.

Victoria Kensington clenched her fists. Envy burned through her.

She had expected to see Isabella disgraced and broken. Instead, Isabella maintained her arrogant composure. How could someone facing conviction still radiate such superiority?

Business first.

She turned to Atticus Whitmore. "Must we have her sign the equity transfer today?"

Atticus stood beside Victoria, reminded of their objective. "Absolutely."

He stepped forward with documents. "Ms. Montgomery. The Director requires your signature on the equity transfer agreement today. My schedule is tight. Sign it now."

He thrust the paperwork toward her.

The models surged forward with demands.

"I have appointments later! Return my money immediately!"

"Watching your trial wastes my time! I only care about getting paid!"

"You signed the agreement! No more delays!"

"Apologize and pay us! I want to leave this disgusting place! I can't stand being near a criminal like you!"

They pressed around her like vultures circling carrion. Everyone treated her like contaminated garbage.

Isabella stayed silent. She checked her watch impatiently.

Eight minutes until ten. Couldn't they have arrived earlier?

The crowd grew more aggressive seeing her indifference.

Fans of the eleven models brandished rotten vegetables ready to throw.

One officer raised his voice. "Remain calm everyone! The court hasn't issued any ruling! Be rational!"

Nearby, Genevieve Beaumont watched from her car with a frown.

Days of court sessions had yielded no conviction due to lack of concrete evidence.

Isabella's assault last night still stung her mouth. She wanted Isabella destroyed completely.

She retrieved her phone and sent an anonymous video to Isadora Vasquez.

This video guaranteed conviction! She would finish Isabella through Isadora's hands!
###Chapter 137

Isabella Montgomery observed the unfolding chaos beside Victoria Kensington when a new email notification flashed on her screen.

She tapped it open immediately.

The video attachment loaded instantly.

Isabella subtly tugged at Victoria’s sleeve.

Noticing everyone was preoccupied with condemning Isabella, Victoria discreetly glanced at the email.

Her eyes widened in shock.

Who could have sent this? Who was pulling the strings behind the scenes?

Clearly, she wasn’t the only one who wanted Isabella destroyed.

As long as Isabella faced conviction, the sender’s identity didn’t matter.

Victoria gave a nearly imperceptible nod.

Isadora Vasquez stepped forward. “Everyone, quiet! An anonymous source just sent me a video. They claim it’s definitive proof!”

She raised her phone high, pressing play.

All eyes locked onto the screen. The video showed Isabella Montgomery grabbing the top strawberry from the tower.

It was clearly filmed by a staff member at close range. The quality was far superior to the grainy CCTV footage.

As Isabella reached for the fruit, a fine powder visibly drifted from her palm.

It dusted the strawberries beneath. The evidence was undeniable.

The crowd erupted.

“This is it! She’s guilty!”
“Isabella Montgomery! Confess! You’re caught red-handed!”
“No more lies! Admit your crime! Apologize to everyone!”

The screams of accusation filled the air.

Victoria knew the video was fabricated, but her performance was flawless. She stared at Isabella with feigned horror. “Sister… it really was you. I defended you. I trusted you. How could you be so wicked?”

Her voice cracked with manufactured betrayal.

Eleanor Kensington wrapped a comforting arm around her. “Victoria, my dear, don’t upset yourself. I always warned you about her true nature. Sever all ties. She will only drag you down with her.”

Eleanor turned a venomous glare on Isabella. “Bringing you into the Montgomery family was our greatest shame! Apologize now! Plead guilty!”

“Pay the compensation! Admit your guilt!”
“Sign the equity transfer! Stop disgracing the Montgomery name!”

The mob closed in, their faces twisted with contempt.

Just as Isabella drew a breath to respond, a new voice cut through the din.

“I have evidence to present!”

It was Maxwell Carter, dragging a frightened man toward the crowd.

Confused murmurs rippled through the onlookers. Who were these men?

Isadora’s face paled upon recognizing the man being dragged.

Maxwell shoved the man forward into the clearing. His voice was hard, commanding. “Tell them the truth. Now.”
###Chapter 138

The man looked truly menacing.

A long, jagged scar ran down the side of his face.

Despite his intimidating appearance, he had been completely subdued by Maxwell.

One look at Maxwell was enough to fill him with pure terror.

Utterly defeated, he hung his head and confessed. "My name... is Silas Granger. I deal in pharmaceuticals. The person who bought the Halophilic bacteria from me wasn't Isabella. It was Victoria!"

Victoria Kensington's face drained of all color.

Every pair of eyes in the room instantly snapped toward her.

Shocked murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Victoria? Impossible! She's always been so supportive of Isabella!"

"She's the kindest person I know. There's no way she'd purchase something like that."

"This man is clearly a criminal. He could have been paid off, right?"

"Absolutely! It has to be Isabella! She's trying to clear her name by framing Victoria!"

Eleanor Kensington, ever Victoria's fierce defender, shouted at the scarred man. "Who paid you to lie about my daughter? Victoria would never do such a thing!"

Victoria snapped out of her daze, quickly adopting a mask of pitiful innocence. She addressed the man with a soft, trembling voice. "Sir, you must be mistaken. You do know that perjury is a serious crime, don't you? Are you in some kind of trouble? Facing difficulties? Tell me how much money you need. I can give you more. I can help you solve any problem. But please, don't... don't frame me for this."

Her words, though gentle on the surface, were a blatant attempt at bribery. She was offering more money to buy his silence.

Silas felt a pang of sympathy for the beautiful, distressed girl. But one thought of how Maxwell had dragged him here made him shudder violently. "I'm not in trouble! I'm not facing any hardships! And I'm not lying! I have proof!"

He fumbled for his phone, holding it up high for everyone to see. "This is surveillance footage from my security cameras! Everyone, watch closely!"

All attention focused on the screen. The video was crystal clear.

The footage showed a dimly lit basement. A woman clad entirely in black, a mask obscuring part of her face, was handing a stack of cash to the scarred man. In return, he handed her a small medicine bottle.

The woman was unmistakably Isadora Vasquez. Her height, her hair tied back in a simple ponytail, even the partially visible profile—it was all a perfect match.

A second video played. It showed Isadora walking backstage at the Mercedes Auto show, carrying a box of water bottles. She distributed them to the crew. Everyone thanked her. She even kindly helped arrange the strawberries on the display. Then, when no one was looking, she discreetly poured the contents of the medicine bottle over the strawberry tower.

The evidence was undeniable.

The atmosphere in the room erupted.

"It was Isadora! She works for Victoria!"

"Oh my god! I can't believe it! Victoria had her buy the drug and frame Isabella!"

"She pretended to be Isabella's biggest supporter. She acted so genuine, so nice! All this time, she was pure evil!"

"She's a master of deception! She played every single one of us for fools!"

"We should have realized. That drug is only stable in liquid form. The video Victoria showed earlier had to be a fake! It was fabricated!"

"Not only did they frame Isabella, but they also manufactured evidence to ensure her conviction!"

A wave of angry accusations crashed over Victoria. The crowd stared at her with undisguised contempt and disgust.

Reporters raised their cameras, flashes popping incessantly. Influencers pointed their phones directly at her, broadcasting the scandal live to their audiences.

Even Eleanor, who had defended her so fiercely, looked at Victoria with utter disbelief. "Victoria," she asked, her voice shaking. "What is the meaning of this?"

This was the daughter she trusted and cherished above all others. Could she truly be capable of such monstrous deceit?

Victoria stood frozen, her face a ghostly white.

How could this be happening?

Isadora had assured her everything was handled. How could this damning evidence still exist?
###Chapter 139

Her anxiety spiked to unprecedented levels.

Yet she maintained that pitiful mask perfectly.

"It's fabricated," Victoria whispered hoarsely. "This video is completely fake. Someone engineered this to destroy me. I would never harm my own sister like this."

One of Victoria's loyal friends quickly rallied. "Exactly! If Gabriella's footage was manipulated, this could be too!"

Eleanor snapped out of her stunned silence.

She immediately moved to shield Victoria, her body a protective barrier.

She fixed a furious glare on Silas. "Who paid you to create these lies? Why are you targeting my daughter? I raised Victoria myself! She is incapable of such monstrous acts!"

Her defense was fierce, unwavering.

Isabella watched from the sidelines, a cold, knowing smile touching her lips.

The stark contrast was not lost on her.

Had she been the one accused, Eleanor's hand would have already struck her face.

But for Victoria? Only fierce protection.

Eleanor was about to learn the brutal truth about her precious, perfect daughter.

Isabella's gaze shifted back to Silas, her voice cutting through the tension. "Your credibility is being questioned. Presenting forged evidence in a court of law carries a sentence of up to three years."

Three years in prison.

Silas's legs nearly buckled beneath him.

He was already a wanted man, cooperating with Maxwell for a chance at leniency.

He turned desperately to the lead officer. "I swear on my life this video is authentic! If there's a single fabricated frame, sentence me to death! Verify it yourselves! Go to the black market! Retrieve the hidden security footage! You'll find Miss Martinez clear as day there!"

His eyes darted wildly between Victoria and Gabriella. "Only black market insiders know about that camera. It can't be tampered with! It can't be erased! Nothing escapes its lens!"

Gabriella's face drained of all color.

She had been so careful to avoid all visible cameras that night.

The existence of a hidden one was a catastrophic oversight.

This could ruin her completely.

The lead officer immediately dispatched a team to investigate, forcing a terrified Silas to guide them.

If his claim was verified, she was finished.

A frantic calculation sparked in Victoria's eyes.

Suddenly.

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed as her palm connected brutally with Gabriella's cheek.

"How could you!" Victoria cried out, her voice laced with manufactured agony. "Gabriella! Why would you frame my sister? I treated you like family! Like my own blood! How could you commit such an evil act against her!"

The force of the blow sent Gabriella stumbling to the floor.

A trickle of blood seeped from the corner of her mouth.

She was dazed, struggling to process the sudden betrayal.

The realization dawned cold and hard.

Victoria was sacrificing her.

Of course. Victoria's career, her future, couldn't be tarnished.

She was the top model. She had to remain pristine.

Gabriella remained on the cold floor, sobs beginning to wrack her body.

–

"It's my fault," she wept, the words catching in her throat. "I was blind with rage. I couldn't stand watching Isabella constantly overshadow you. You were always so kind to her, and she repaid you with nothing but schemes. I just... I just wanted to get revenge for you!"

"Unbelievable!" Victoria shrieked, her performance flawless.

She dropped to her knees, grabbing Gabriella's collar and shaking her violently. "I told you! The Guci editorial had nothing to do with Isabella! It was my own failure! I don't blame her! How could you do this! I trusted you like an aunt! Like an older sister! I gave you everything! How could you betray me with such viciousness behind my back? How could you!"
###Chapter 140

Victoria’s voice grew raspy from sobbing.

Tears streamed down her cheeks without pause.

Her delicate frame trembled violently, as if she might collapse from the emotional turmoil.

The spectators watched the scene unfold with rapt attention.

Some found the entire situation unspeakably messy.

Others harbored doubts about the authenticity of her display.

Yet many were completely swayed by Victoria’s performance.

Their hearts ached for her apparent distress.

Eleanor felt a similar pang of sympathy.

She helped Victoria to her feet, offering comfort. “Victoria, please stop crying. This is Gabriella’s fault, not yours. You misjudged her character. You trusted her as your top agent. She’s utterly heartless! I will find you a better agent tomorrow. Please, dry your tears.”

“No, it’s my failure. I failed to supervise my agent properly. That’s why she could commit such a terrible act. The blame lies with me…”

Victoria pushed Eleanor away gently.

She turned to face the eleven models, her expression contrite. “I am so sorry. Truly, I apologize. My agent is the one who poisoned you all. I am the cause of your suffering…”

She bowed deeply at a ninety-degree angle.

Her voice was thick with remorse and hoarse from crying.

She then turned toward Isabella.

She bowed again, even deeper this time. “Sister, I beg your forgiveness. I am deeply sorry for your prolonged imprisonment. It breaks my heart… My failure to uncover the truth sooner allowed you to endure such pain… I apologize on my own behalf, and on Gabriella’s as well. You may hit me. You may kick me. Do whatever you need to do…”

Her crying intensified as she spoke.

Tears flooded her face, her demeanor utterly submissive.

She even grabbed Isabella’s hand, attempting to force Isabella to strike her.

A flicker of cold mockery passed through Isabella’s eyes.

This woman was attempting to play the victim yet again.

Did she truly believe Isabella would fall for such an obvious act?

Isabella had a particular distaste for those who feigned victimhood.

She raised her hand swiftly.

She delivered a stinging slap across Victoria’s face.

The force of the blow sent Victoria stumbling to the floor.

Eleanor rushed to Victoria’s side immediately.

She helped her up, glaring furiously at Isabella. “Isabella! How could you be so cruel! Gabriella is the one who framed you! Victoria is your sister! She has been defending you this whole time! She apologized to you! How could you strike her!”

“Mother… It’s alright… Really, I’m fine… I’m not hurt…” Victoria clutched her reddening cheek, tears still flowing. “It is my fault. I failed to see the truth sooner. I failed to control Gabriella. I share the blame. If she wishes to hit me, she may. I deserve it. It might ease my guilt…”

Her portrayal of distress and remorse instantly won the sympathy of the crowd.

Mutterings began to spread through the onlookers.

“Poor Victoria. She was dragged into this by her own agent.”

“Isabella is too harsh. Look, Victoria’s lip is bleeding. Look at those finger marks on her face. Tsk, tsk…”

“She was only locked up for a few days. It’s not like she suffered greatly. Victoria has apologized profusely. Why hit her with such force…”

Isabella’s gaze remained icy.

In this world, those who cried often received what they wanted.

But Isabella was not a crier.

Was she meant to play the villain simply because she refused to shed tears?

No.

She might not have the power to defeat every evil, but she certainly knew how to handle those who pretended to be victims.

She looked at Victoria with undisguised scorn.

She let out a cold, derisive laugh. “Alright, that’s enough acting. My friend still possesses a complete record of your conversations with Gabriella. If you continue this charade, I will not hesitate to ensure you join her in prison.”

Victoria’s face froze instantly.

The tears that had been welling in her eyes stopped falling abruptly.

Isabella had a copy of her chats with Gabriella!

This… This was catastrophic!

This would utterly destroy her!
###Chapter 141

Victoria’s entire body went rigid.

A heavy silence fell over the room.

Muttered whispers began to ripple through the crowd.

Why had Victoria suddenly stopped crying? She was sobbing hysterically just moments ago. Did she feel guilty now?

Seeing the situation shift, Isadora stepped forward. “This is my fault. It has nothing to do with Victoria. She has always taught me to be a better person and repeatedly told me not to harm Isabella. But you’ve all witnessed how vicious Isabella can be. She never treated Victoria like a sister. She either hit her or verbally abused her constantly. I acted out of momentary rage. There’s no point in explaining further. Arrest me. Charge me. I accept full responsibility.”

Isadora’s performance seemed utterly sincere and believable.

Yet everyone had seen Victoria’s reaction. Her sudden silence was deeply suspicious. Wasn’t she clearly guilty too?

Isadora was obviously taking the fall for her!

An officer finally spoke. “Alright, Isabella is free to go. Victoria and Isadora, you will both remain to give your official statements.”

Isabella’s handcuffs were removed. Another officer moved to detain Victoria.

Victoria’s face had lost all color. The suspicion in the room was palpable. She didn’t dare play the victim again after Isabella’s sharp accusations. She had no choice but to go with the officers.

“Wait.” A cold, commanding voice cut through the noise.

Isabella’s gaze locked onto Victoria. “There is a signed agreement stating the responsible party must pay each model ten million dollars. Victoria, since you’ve essentially admitted fault, shouldn’t you be the one paying this sum on your agent’s behalf?”

Victoria froze. Eleven models. One hundred and ten million dollars total. There was no way Isadora could ever afford that.

Isadora was her closest ally and was sacrificing herself for her. Whether out of friendship or to ensure Isadora’s silence, Victoria had to pay. She was trapped.

But Victoria didn’t have a diamond mine like Isabella. All the money she’d earned modeling had been spent on her lavish lifestyle and currying favor with the Montgomery family.

She held family shares, but they were untouchable. Liquidating them was impossible.

Paying 110 million dollars would completely wipe out her entire savings. She would be left with nothing.

The eleven affected models immediately began to protest.

“Yes, the agreement was signed! We must be paid!”

“I can’t believe we were manipulated like this. It’s disgusting! It feels like swallowing a fly!”

“Pay up now! If you won’t, then Isadora must! The agreement states payment is due today! I want nothing more to do with any of you!”

The demands from the crowd grew louder.

Influencers broadcast the scene live. Reporters’ cameras flashed relentlessly in Victoria’s face.

Humiliation washed over her. She desperately wanted this to end so she could escape.

She had no other option. She pulled out her phone to transfer the funds to each model in full view of everyone.

Eleanor rushed over, trying to stop her. “Victoria, don’t be foolish! Isadora is your agent, but this is her mistake! You shouldn’t have to pay for it! A hundred and ten million is an enormous amount of money! I can’t let you do this!”

Victoria wanted to strangle her.

Was Eleanor an idiot? Couldn’t she see the position Victoria was in?
###Chapter 142

"You demanded my fifteen percent shares for allegedly harming others. By that logic, you should surrender at least ten percent of yours for allowing your agent to commit these crimes."

Ten percent of her shares.

Victoria nearly snarled in fury.

Not only did Isabella demand she pay the models 110 million dollars, but she was also targeting her ten percent stake. It was worth at least twenty billion.

How could Isabella be so ruthless.

Eleanor could no longer tolerate the situation. She shouted at Isabella, "Isabella, stop this! Why are you cornering your own sister like everyone else? It's tragic enough she's been implicated in this mess. Have you no humanity left?"

"Hah, you want me to be humane? Where was their compassion when they framed me for poisoning the models? Where was their humanity when they forced me to apologize for crimes I didn't commit? Where was it when they demanded I hand over my fifteen percent shares? You've defended and believed Victoria this entire time, but have you ever once believed or defended me since this began?" Isabella's voice was icy and sharp, her gaze piercing directly into Eleanor.

Eleanor was speechless. She felt a pang of heartache looking into Isabella's cold eyes.

Just as she prepared to speak, Isabella turned away. "Forget it. I'll ask grandfather about the equity transfer. Let's see if someone who allows their agent to poison and frame others is fit to hold twenty percent of the company shares!"

She immediately called Theodore Montgomery on her phone.

Theodore's voice came through clearly. "Isabella, I saw the broadcast. I know you're innocent. Victoria must take responsibility this time. Where's Atticus? Tell him to transfer ten percent of Victoria's shares to you immediately."

Isabella's phone was on speaker. Everyone heard Theodore's command perfectly.

Atticus, being a lawyer, understood the case was filled with irregularities. It was highly probable Victoria orchestrated this herself. Theodore was being generous by only taking ten percent of her shares.

He approached Victoria with the equity transfer agreement. "Ms. Victoria, please comply with the Director's instructions and sign here."

Victoria trembled with rage. Her face was deathly pale.

Twenty billion dollars. Her twenty billion dollars was vanishing just like that.

She came here to seize Isabella's fifteen percent, and now she was losing ten percent of her own.

She was on the verge of a complete breakdown. But cameras were pointed at her from every direction. The situation had spiraled out of control. What choice did she have? How could she refuse?

She had no option. She gritted her teeth and forced out the words. "Of course... I should do this after causing Isabella so much distress... I will treat her better from now on. I will make it up to her!"

Her hand shook violently as she signed her name on the document.

Atticus brought the agreement to Isabella for her signature.

Ten percent of the shares, with a market value of two hundred billion dollars, now belonged to Isabella.

Victoria's body trembled so uncontrollably she almost collapsed.

Eleanor caught her. "Victoria, let's go. We'll give your statement, then go home and speak to grandfather about this! Isabella, you went too far today. You've disappointed me. You've broken my heart!"

With that, Eleanor led a distraught Victoria away from the scene.

Isabella watched them leave, her expression turning frosty.

Disappointed? Heartbroken?

She felt the exact same way.

She pushed through the crowd. Maxwell handed her the keys to the Kawasaki. She mounted the bike and sped away.
###Chapter 143

Twitter exploded within the hour.

#IsabellaIsInnocent, #GabriellaGets3Years, #VictoriaPays110Billion, and #VictoriaIsRottenInside dominated the trending list.

Gabriella Martinez pleaded guilty immediately. The evidence was overwhelming. Isabella Montgomery had executed a flawless victory.

The internet turned into a frenzy of condemnation. Victoria Kensington became the primary target.

Some netizens defended her innocence. Others dissected the situation with brutal logic.

How could a mere agent possess such audacity? Victoria and Gabriella were inseparable. Ignorance was implausible.

Why did Victoria fall silent under Isabella's questioning? Why pay a staggering 110 billion so readily?

That sum was astronomical. No friendship justified that level of financial sacrifice. It reeked of guilt.

Victoria was clearly the mastermind. Gabriella was a sacrificed pawn.

Victoria's past, hypocritical defenses of Isabella resurfaced online. Her disingenuous nature was exposed.

Isabella had won decisively.

Yet, she found herself speeding aimlessly on her Kawasaki. Her mind was consumed by Eleanor Kensington's words.

Isabella was accustomed to familial neglect. But watching her adoptive mother unconditionally defend Victoria was a fresh wound.

No one had ever shielded Isabella like that.

Hard work never earned her such fierce, blind loyalty.

She pulled over near the coast. The sea breeze whipped against her skin.

The sun was brutal. The wind felt cold and harsh.

Suddenly, an umbrella appeared, blocking the glaring light.

She turned. Nathaniel Blackwood stood beside her.

He towered over her, his shoulders broad and imposing.

From her low angle, his features were devastatingly sharp. His presence was magnetic.

His beauty remained a potent force, capable of stealing breath.

She looked back at the ocean. Her voice was flat, devoid of emotion. "Why are you here?"

The vulnerable woman from moments ago was gone. Nathaniel's expression was serious. "Ms. Montgomery, you promised to visit the Blackwood estate to see Christopher. Are you reneging?"

She remembered. She hadn't expected him to retrieve her personally.

She was free today.

"Don't worry. I keep my promises. Let's go."

She compartmentalized her pain. The helmet went on. She mounted the bike.

Nathaniel wanted to stop her. He knew better. He opted to follow in his car instead.

A woman on a powerful motorcycle drew attention. Especially one in light-colored gear.

A pack of street racers noticed her. They whistled, swerving to ride alongside her.

Nathaniel reacted instantly. His luxury car shot forward, cutting off the racers.

The lead racer screamed in fury. "Who the hell is this asshole? Ram him!"

He accelerated. A subordinate grabbed his arm in panic. "Stop! Look at the license plate!"

The racer paled. The plate was unmistakable.

Mr. Blackwood. The man who owned Shelburne.

The racer swerved violently, fleeing the scene. His gang scattered behind him.
###Chapter 144

Isabella watched everything unfold through her rearview mirror. Something stirred deep within her heart.

This was what it felt like to be truly protected.

The convoy reached The Palace Heart approximately thirty minutes later.

The Palace Heart was an exclusive gated community of luxury villas. Each villa spanned nineteen floors, featuring sprawling pastures, Olympic-sized swimming pools, private golf courses, and meticulously curated man-made gardens. The price tag for a single villa hovered around ten digits.

Only the elite could afford such opulence.

Following Nathaniel's lead, Isabella parked her Kawasaki outside Villa No. 9.

Two neat rows of servants stood waiting at the grand entrance. They bowed in perfect unison, their voices respectful and synchronized. "Good evening, Mr. Blackwood. Good evening, Ms. Montgomery."

Their deference was reminiscent of courtiers greeting royalty.

The scene was familiar to Isabella. She paid it little mind, walking alongside Nathaniel into the villa.

Servants pushed the heavy, ornate doors open for them. A breathtakingly magnificent hall was revealed.

The entire space was lavishly adorned with countless pink roses. The villa appeared to be completely overtaken by a sea of blossoms. Helium balloons floated gracefully near the vaulted ceilings. It felt like stepping into a dreamlike fairy tale.

Isabella was momentarily stunned by the elaborate decor.

"Please, Ms. Montgomery," Nathaniel said respectfully.

He had been leading but suddenly shifted to walk behind her. Isabella had no choice but to step forward.

Just as they reached the center of the hall, a loud pop! echoed. A massive balloon above their heads burst, showering them with a cascade of delicate flower petals.

Oliver emerged from a nearby floral arrangement, his face beaming with joy. "Mommy! Happy Independence Day!"

His childish voice rang out clearly as he pulled the string on a confetti popper he held.

A shower of colorful ribbons and gold foil flakes rained down upon Isabella.

Standing there, enveloped in the celebration, she felt a surreal grandeur, almost like a wedding ceremony.

She had never experienced such thoughtful treatment since childhood...

Oliver rushed forward, grabbing Isabella's hand. "Mommy, I want a hug! I missed you so, so much!"

"It's only been a few days," Isabella smiled warmly. She bent down and scooped the chubby boy into her arms.

For some inexplicable reason, even though he wasn't her biological child, holding him filled her with a profound sense of maternal love and fulfillment.

Oliver melted into her embrace, wrapping his small arms tightly around her neck. "I miss you every second we're apart! I never want to be separated from you! Never, ever!"

Forever…

The word caused Isabella's gaze to darken instantly.

Could there ever be a 'forever' with Nathaniel and Oliver?

Probably not. Their fate had been sealed by that incident five years ago...

Noticing her shift in mood, Nathaniel swiftly changed the subject. "Momo, where is the gift you prepared for Mommy?"

"Oh! Right! Here it is!"

Oliver wriggled out of Isabella's arms and darted back to the flower arrangement. He retrieved a pristine white gift box and presented it to her.

"Mommy, this is for you. I spent three whole days and nights designing it. I had people make it special, just in time. I really hope you like it."

A gift? Custom-made for her?

Isabella had thought the stunning decorations were gift enough. Deeply touched, she accepted the box and carefully opened it.

Dozens of vibrant butterflies instantly fluttered out, creating a magical, dreamlike spectacle. And inside the box, revealed amongst the soft lining, was...
###Chapter 145

Isabella had expected something cute from Oliver.
A dress was the last thing she anticipated.

This gown was utterly unique.
A sleeveless A-line silhouette flowed elegantly.
Intricate ink brushstrokes formed a misty mountain landscape across the fabric.
The hem dissolved into a deep crimson gradient.

Perched on the bodice was a small, sculpted black phoenix.
The overall effect was dramatic.
Smoky haze seemed to swirl around flames.
The phoenix appeared to be rising from them.
It was breathtaking.

Isabella had never seen anything like it.
No designer had released this piece.
So…

“Momo, you made this for me?”

Nathaniel hesitated briefly before nodding.
“Yes. It’s my gift. For your independence day.
I want you to soar even higher after all this.”

She couldn’t help but ruffle his hair.
His acting was decent, but a child designing this?
Impossible.

His momentary pause confirmed her suspicion.
Nathaniel designed it.
He had it tailored for her.

He knew she’d refuse it if it came directly from him.
Using Oliver was a clever tactic.

A complex emotion stirred within her.
She decided not to call him out on it.

“I just got out. I need a shower and a change anyway.
This is a perfect gift.”

A flicker of relief shone in Nathaniel’s eyes.
Her acceptance was all that mattered.

“Follow me. I’ll show you the bathroom.”
He turned, leading her down a lavish corridor.

She had little choice but to follow.
They reached a luxurious bathroom.

The massive tub was already filled.
Rose petals floated on the steamy water.
He’d even drawn her bath?

“Nathaniel, I really…”

“Take your time. I’ll be waiting in the dining room.”
His voice was calm, gentle. He left before she could protest.

She sighed, stepping inside and closing the door.
Sinking into the hot water, her brow furrowed.

His interest was obvious.
Under different circumstances, she might have considered him.
But…

No man, especially one of his stature, would want a woman with her history.
Raped. Pregnant. Abortion.
She had resigned herself to a life alone.

After this, she would tell him the truth.
Make him give up.
Stop him from wasting his time on her.

Fresh towels and necessities were laid out.
Even delicate underwear.

She dried her hair and slipped into the stunning dress.
A maid was waiting outside.

“Ms. Montgomery, right this way.”
The servant’s deference made her feel like the lady of the manor.

She was led to the dining hall.
She expected a grand, formal affair.
Violinists. Candlelight. Steak.

Instead, the room was quiet, bathed in soft light.
The atmosphere was luxuriously comfortable.

The table was set with simple, homely dishes.
Braised duck. Stewed chicken. Pork knuckles.
Seasonal vegetables. Steamed eggs.

Oliver and Nathaniel were already seated.
Oliver wore a t-shirt with cartoon cats, looking adorable.
Nathaniel was in relaxed loungewear, a light gray shirt.
He looked effortlessly elegant.
###Chapter 146

The scene felt instantly welcoming, wrapping Isabella in a comforting sense of belonging.

Nathaniel spotted her and rose immediately, guiding her toward the table. “Mommy, come sit with us. Let’s have dinner.”

Isabella shook off her daze. She followed Oliver to the left side of the long dining table and settled into her chair.

Nathaniel sat directly opposite. “I hope these simple dishes are to your liking,” he offered.

Dominic, standing discreetly outside, nearly groaned. Simple? The entire villa staff had been stretched to their limits!

Nathaniel had planned this menu two days prior. It featured rare ingredients and complex techniques worthy of a three-Michelin-star establishment. The list was exquisite.

He’d even flown in a renowned chef from Paris specifically for the occasion.

But then, just an hour ago, Nathaniel called. He demanded the chef pivot entirely to humble, home-cooked meals.

All the live musicians were promptly sent away.

Seeing Isabella’s quiet melancholy, Nathaniel understood. She didn’t need grandeur; she needed the warmth of a home. So, he changed everything.

This was his first time ever preparing a homely meal for a woman. A flicker of anxiety stirred within him.

What if she disliked it?

Isabella’s eyes scanned the spread. “I love it. Thank you for going through all this trouble after your long day. Here, Oliver, have a drumstick.”

She served her son as she spoke, the mood softening around them.

Oliver beamed. “Thanks, Mommy! You have some too. The pork knuckle is good for your skin, helps with collagen.”

“You’ve lost weight recently. You need to build your strength back,” Nathaniel stated, placing a piece of braised chicken in her bowl.

Oliver suddenly remembered something. He added a generous portion of greens to her plate. “You need vitamins too, Mommy. Eat your vegetables for balanced nutrition!”

Her bowl was overflowing in seconds.

“Okay, that’s plenty. You eat now, Oliver,” she said gently.

“Hehe, okay.” Oliver happily dug into his food.

A serene peace settled over the room. The air itself felt warmer. Though from utterly different worlds, in that moment, they felt like a complete family.

Savoring the delicious food while watching Oliver’s cheerful, round face, Isabella felt her heavy burdens lift.

Who cared about Eleanor, Victoria, or the rest of her complicated family? Nothing compared to having her son right beside her.

Isabella unconsciously finished two full servings.

For years, she’d been consumed by work and her plans for revenge. Meals were merely functional, just fuel to survive. It had been so long since she’d enjoyed eating like this.

Oliver finished his meal, gave a small burp, and rubbed his eyes. “I’m so full and sleepy. I think I’ll go take a nap.”

Before Isabella could respond, he scampered off.

Isabella saw right through it. The little schemer was deliberately leaving her alone with Nathaniel. What a clever boy.

The dining hall grew quiet. Nathaniel broke the silence. “There’s a rooftop garden upstairs with a view of the city. Would you like to see it?”

Isabella remembered she needed to talk to him anyway. She nodded. “Let’s go.”

She followed him into the elevator, arriving moments later on the nineteenth floor.

A vast five-hundred-square-meter open-air terrace had been transformed into a serene lotus pond.

The lotus leaves were a vibrant green, and the flowers bloomed magnificently under the midsummer sky.

Isabella tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear, mentally organizing her words.

It should be simple. She wasn’t one to drag things out.

Yet, for some reason, the words stuck in her throat.

Suddenly, Nathaniel reached out and took her hand.
###Chapter 147

Isabella instinctively tried to pull back, but Nathaniel’s grip tightened. “Relax. I’m taking you to the balcony.”

He led the way, her hand still enclosed in his.

The pond was designed with stone pathways that arched just above the water, weaving through the blooming lotuses.

She didn’t dare struggle, afraid she might accidentally pull them both into the water. She allowed him to guide her toward the garden’s edge.

They stopped at the railing. The night air was cool against their skin. Below, the city glittered with countless lights. Above, the sky was a blanket of stars. It was breathtakingly beautiful. The atmosphere felt intimate, almost dreamlike.

Against her will, Isabella found herself drawn into the moment. But she knew it couldn’t last.

She forced her eyes away, mentally rehearsing what she needed to say.

Just then, Nathaniel turned abruptly. His gaze was intense, direct. “Isabella,” he said, his voice low and steady. “I can give you a home.”

His words, carried on the breeze, made her heart stutter.

A home.

Was this a proposal?

It wasn’t the first time he’d expressed his feelings. Letting this continue was dangerous.

She pulled her hand from his, her expression turning serious. “Mr. Blackwood, don’t you investigate a person’s past before developing feelings for them?” Her pregnancy had been a well-kept secret, explained away as a prolonged illness and a trip to Africa. But a man of Nathaniel’s resources could uncover it if he tried.

“I’m drawn to who you are now,” he replied. “Your past doesn’t change that.”

“What if I told you I’ve killed someone?” she challenged. “Or that I was once pregnant? That I have a child out there somewhere?”

His brow furrowed slightly. A shadow crossed his features. Isabella braced for his disgust. A man of his stature would surely recoil.

Instead, his expression cleared. “If you killed someone, they must have deserved it. I’d help you finish the job. And a child?” A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. “That would mean I get an instant family. Oliver would have a sibling to play with.”

Isabella was speechless. Did he think this was a joke?

“I’m being serious, Nathaniel.”

“So am I,” he stated, his face completely earnest. She stared, utterly stunned.

Was he? Did he truly mean he wouldn’t care? Even about murder? Even about another man’s child?

It seemed impossible. He must believe she was testing him. She drew a sharp breath, gathering her resolve. “Nathaniel, there’s something I need to tell you. Now is the time. We can’t be together because, five years ago—”

“Mr. Blackwood! Sir!”

Dominic’s frantic voice cut through the night as he sprinted toward them. “It’s Oliver! Something’s wrong!”

Nathaniel’s posture snapped to attention. “What happened?”

“He’s having seizures!” Dominic gasped, his face pale. “Violent ones!”

“Where is Sebastian?” Nathaniel demanded, already grabbing Isabella’s hand and pulling her back toward the house.

All thoughts of her confession vanished. The mention of Christopher in trouble sent a jolt of pure terror through her. She needed to see him. Now.

“We’ve contacted him,” Dominic said, struggling to keep pace. “But it will take him at least twenty minutes to get here.”
###Chapter 148

"Hot water. A towel. And the mouth guard. Now."

Nathaniel's voice cut through the tension as he pulled Isabella into the descending elevator.

Her mind raced with images of Christopher's fragile state. She barely registered Nathaniel's firm grip on her hand.

They reached the second-floor nursery. Oliver writhed on his bed, small body seized by violent tremors. Veins bulged beneath his pale skin.

This was far worse than anything Isabella had witnessed before.

"Wait outside," Nathaniel commanded. The scene would undoubtedly terrify her.

She surprised him by stepping forward. "No. I'm staying with Oliver."

She moved quickly to the bedside, taking his small hand in hers. "Oliver, it's Aunt Isabella. I'm right here with you."

He gave no sign of recognition. His body continued to convulse relentlessly.

His eyes rolled back, leaving only the whites visible. Sweat poured from his forehead.

Isabella knew this was no ordinary episode. The severity shook her to the core.

She turned desperate eyes to Nathaniel. "What's happening to him? Why is it this bad? How do we help him?"

"Stay calm. He'll be alright," Nathaniel reassured her evenly. He used the warm towel to wipe Oliver's face and neck.

Then he gently inserted the mouth guard between Oliver's teeth. Preventing him from biting his tongue.

Isabella prided herself on her composure. But now she felt utterly useless.

She could only watch Nathaniel work while she murmured comforts. "Be brave, sweet boy. You promised to be strong. I'm not going anywhere."

Oliver kept convulsing. Trapped in some private agony beyond their reach.

Nathaniel spoke softly. "This happens several times a year. Sebastian will give him the injection. It always helps."

"But Sebastian isn't here yet. We have over ten minutes to wait..."

Ten more minutes of this suffering. For a child so small.

Isabella's heart shattered. "He goes through this every time? There's no permanent treatment?"

Nathaniel's gaze darkened. He said nothing. There was no other way. Oliver had to endure.

The next minutes stretched into an eternity.

They could only stand by. Ensuring he didn't harm himself. Watching helplessly.

Finally, Sebastian arrived. He moved with efficient speed, administering the injection.

The convulsions gradually subsided. Oliver's small body stilled. But his eyes remained closed.

"Let's give him space to rest," Sebastian said quietly.

Isabella lingered, staring at Oliver's pale face. Her worry deepened. She followed the men out reluctantly.

Once the door closed, she turned to Sebastian. "What's really wrong with him? There must be some solution."

"It's affective psychosis. Growing up without a mother... The Blackwoods provide everything materially. But emotional needs are harder to meet. He desperately wants a mother. Until that void is filled, these episodes will continue."

"But I was with him today. He seemed so happy. Why would it trigger now?"

"Before meeting you, he had four to six episodes yearly. This one was overdue, actually. Perhaps his happiness made him fear losing it more." Isabella's heart clenched. Four to six times a year. So much pain for a five-year-old.

He had been radiant today. Giving gifts. Serving food. She thought he felt secure.

Instead, he feared it was temporary.

Nathaniel studied her intently. "Ms. Montgomery. I have a request."
###Chapter 149

Nathaniel’s gaze was intense and unwavering. “I need you to be my girlfriend for six months.”

Six months. Girlfriend.

Isabella’s expression tightened with immediate disapproval. “Nathaniel, how can you even suggest something like this right now?”

“Ms. Montgomery, I’m doing this for Oliver. He’s always longed for a mother. You’re the only person he’s truly connected with in years. If you agree, I believe he can recover fully within six months. After that, you’re free to go,” Nathaniel stated, his voice low and serious.

Isabella frowned deeply. Half a year pretending to be Nathaniel’s girlfriend? Playing the role of Oliver’s mother?

“Lying to a child is wrong. When I eventually leave, the hurt will be even greater for him.”

“It’s a necessary deception. Can you honestly stand by and watch Oliver suffer like this?” Nathaniel pressed.

The image of Oliver’s pained face flashed in her mind. It felt like her heart was being shredded.

Why did such an innocent child have to endure so much agony?

She desperately wanted this to be the last time he ever experienced such a seizure. The thought of him in that state again was unbearable.

Sebastian noticed her hesitation. “Ms. Montgomery, Oliver’s condition is highly unusual. A compassionate lie is forgivable. My recent examination revealed his situation is deteriorating. Without intervention, these seizures could cause permanent brain damage. Each episode pushes him dangerously close to… not waking up.”

Not waking up.

Isabella knew Sebastian wasn’t exaggerating. She had seen the difference. When Oliver was merely upset or feigning illness, he remained responsive. Today, he was completely lifeless.

Her resolve was crumbling, all for Oliver’s sake.

But was it reason enough to spend six months entangled with Nathaniel? To pretend to be his partner?

“Ms. Montgomery, you have my word,” Nathaniel assured her. “Our arrangement will remain private. I won’t interfere with your life or plans. I will compensate you generously—name anything you desire. I will strictly respect your boundaries.” His tone was earnest and respectful.

Isabella fell into deep thought. Nathaniel was practically pleading. Oliver’s life was at stake.

It seemed she had no real alternative.

After a heavy silence, she finally spoke. “Fine. I’ll do it. But I don’t want your money. I want a contract.”

“Of course,” Nathaniel replied, glancing at Dominic.

Dominic immediately produced a laptop and opened a document. “Please state your terms, Ms. Montgomery.”

Isabella considered carefully. “First, you must commit every possible resource to curing Oliver within these six months. Spare no effort. Second, this relationship is a facade. Neither party interferes in the other’s personal life. Third, absolute confidentiality. No one else can know the truth. Fourth, no inappropriate physical contact. Finally, regardless of Oliver’s condition, I leave after six months. Nathaniel cannot invent any reason to extend this. Violation of any term results in a penalty of one hundred billion dollars.”

One hundred billion. Dollars.

Even a family as powerful as the Blackwoods had a net worth estimated around one hundred and fifty billion. This penalty would strip away two-thirds of their entire fortune.

Every clause, except the first, was designed to build a fortress between her and Nathaniel.

Men usually drafted contracts to protect themselves from women’s claims. Here, Isabella was the one building walls against him.
###Chapter 150

A billionaire with immense power, yet Nathaniel Blackwood faced such disdain from Isabella Montgomery?

Sebastian Blackwood glanced at his brother with genuine pity.

Nathaniel remained expressionless. His composure seemed unshakable.

“I accept all terms.”

He extended his hand toward Dominic Sterling, who promptly handed him the printed contract.

Nathaniel signed without hesitation. He even added his thumbprint for verification.

Isabella signed as well. Staring at the crimson impressions left by their thumbs, she felt momentarily disoriented.

Was she now Nathaniel’s contracted girlfriend? Just like that?

She had intended to reveal the truth about that night five years ago, but this sudden turn of events changed everything. Confessing now felt pointless. Besides, if Christopher discovered her past, wouldn’t it jeopardize his treatment?

After careful consideration, Isabella decided to keep her secret buried.

After all, this was merely a contractual arrangement. Their separation was inevitable.

She met Nathaniel’s gaze and warned, “Mr. Blackwood, remember not to develop feelings for me during these six months. I will leave when the contract ends, regardless of circumstances.”

Nathaniel’s expression darkened briefly before returning to neutral. “Understood.”

They had ample time ahead.

Sebastian secretly gave Nathaniel an approving thumbs-up. This was remarkable progress!

Christopher’s condition was concerning, but Nathaniel had skillfully turned the situation around.

It seemed a wedding might be imminent in six months!

Sebastian firmly believed no one could resist falling for Nathaniel after spending half a year with him.

That night, Isabella remained worried about Christopher. She decided to stay and sleep beside him.

Nathaniel instructed the staff to change the bedding to new dark blue sheets adorned with stars and moons. The arrangement felt surprisingly warm.

Isabella cradled Christopher as they settled into bed. She gently stroked his pale cheek.

His complexion had turned porcelain-like after the recent episode.

She whispered softly, “Momo, you must recover quickly. Your aunt…”

Pausing, she remembered the contract. “…Your mommy will stay right here with you.”

The word “mommy” felt foreign yet strangely comforting. It carried a warmth and sweetness she hadn’t anticipated.

Though still asleep, Christopher’s brows relaxed noticeably. He seemed to rest more peacefully in Isabella’s embrace.

Just as Isabella prepared to sleep, her phone vibrated abruptly.

She checked the screen. A message from Julian Hawthorne. “Not staying at Rosewood Manor tonight?”

Isabella replied, “No. Christopher had an episode. I’m staying with him at the estate.”

She expected opposition, but Julian’s response surprised her. “Alright. Nathaniel is a decent man.”

A decent man?

Isabella frowned in confusion. Had she read that correctly?

Since her return, Julian consistently warned her against dating. He claimed all men were trash, himself included.

Yet now, he described Nathaniel as decent?

Where exactly was this decency she hadn’t noticed?

A soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

“It’s me,” a deep, magnetic voice announced from behind the door. Nathaniel.
###Chapter 151

Isabella’s brow furrowed in confusion.
What was Nathaniel doing here at this hour?

Since it was his estate, she had no choice but to yield.
“Come in,” she murmured softly.

Nathaniel entered, followed by maids carrying a mattress and blankets.
They moved with swift efficiency.

Within moments, a sleek gray mattress was laid out on the floor.
Simple, yet undeniably elegant.
The maids exited, closing the door behind them.

Isabella’s frown deepened.
“Mr. Blackwood, what is the meaning of this?”

“Oliver could fall ill at any moment tonight,” Nathaniel stated flatly, already settling onto the mattress.
He wore pure black silk pajamas.
“I need to be here.”

Isabella fell silent, standing just a meter away.
Was this really necessary?
Still, his reasoning wasn’t entirely unfounded.
Having him nearby if Oliver’s condition worsened did make sense.

Choosing not to argue, she closed her eyes and tried to rest.
Nathaniel lay down and used his phone to switch off the lights.

Darkness enveloped the room instantly.
Only a sliver of moonlight filtered through the window, casting a soft silver glow.

Nathaniel turned onto his side, facing Isabella’s back.
A faint smile touched his lips as he watched her silhouette.

They were inching closer.
The day he had waited for was finally approaching.

That night was the most peaceful sleep Isabella had experienced in five years.
No nightmares haunted her.
She slept straight through until ten in the morning.

Slowly, she became aware of something soft and warm pressed against her.
She opened her eyes to find Oliver gazing at her with wide, doe-like eyes.

“Good morning, Mommy!” he chirped, his voice sweet and cheerful.
His plump cheeks were lifted in an adorable grin.

Isabella’s heart melted instantly.
She sat up, surprised.
“Oliver, are you feeling better now?”

“Yes! Thank you for asking, Mommy! I feel much better!”

His small, jelly-like arms wrapped around her neck.
His eyes sparkled as he asked, “Did Mommy hold Oliver while he slept? Did I sleep in your arms?”

“Mhm. Mommy will always be with you,” Isabella said, gently smoothing his hair.
“So you have to be good and focus on getting better, okay?”

Oliver’s eyes widened with hope.
“Does that mean Mommy will never leave Oliver? Daddy told me you would be my mommy forever! Is it true?”

Isabella was momentarily caught off guard, but she nodded gently.
Her only concern was ensuring Oliver’s full recovery in the coming months.

Overjoyed, Oliver began bouncing on the bed in circles.
“Oliver has a Mommy now! Mommy won’t ever leave again!”
His adorable face beamed with pure delight.

Isabella wanted to savor the moment longer, but her phone rang abruptly.
It was her grandfather.
The moment she answered, she heard the urgency in his voice.

“Isabella? Are you busy? Can you come to the manor right away? They’re all causing a scene, pressuring me to change my decision!”

Isabella’s expression tightened.
Pressure? This had to be about the ten percent shares.
Victoria was undoubtedly behind it.
If Victoria wanted to play games, Isabella was more than ready to engage.
“Alright, I’ll be there soon,” she replied.

As she ended the call, she noticed Oliver pouting, his eyes glistening with unshed tears.
“Mommy is leaving… Mommy doesn’t want Oliver anymore.”

“Of course not! Never think that,” Isabella reassured him softly.
###Chapter 152

Isabella worried Oliver might fall sick again. She gently tousled his hair. "Mommy needs to handle some family matters. I'll come straight home to you after, okay?"

"Pinky swear! You have to keep your promise!" Oliver held out his tiny pinky, watching her with serious eyes.

She linked her pinky with his. "Mommy will be back soon."

"Yay! I'll walk you to the door!" Oliver beamed, leading her downstairs by the hand.

In the living room, Nathaniel was lounging on the sofa. He held a document, looking effortlessly poised like a magazine cover model.

Isabella's gaze lingered a moment too long. She quickly shook herself out of it. "I need to go to the family manor for a bit. Please watch Christopher for me."

"I'll drive you." Nathaniel immediately set the document aside and grabbed his car keys.

Before she could refuse, Oliver chimed in, "Me too!"

Isabella had no choice. She got into the car, cradling the sleepy Christopher. A maid handed her a breakfast bag. "Mr. Blackwood asked us to prepare this for you."

"Thank you," Isabella murmured, accepting the warm milk and ham sandwich. The simple gesture thawed a small part of her frozen heart. It had been so long since anyone made her breakfast.

Nathaniel could be surprisingly thoughtful.

She handed a sandwich to Oliver. "Let's eat together."

"Yay!" Oliver cheered, taking the food with both hands.

They chatted happily during the short drive. Soon, the grand gates of the Montgomery Manor came into view.

"Just stop here," Isabella said. "I'll walk the rest of the way."

Nathaniel understood she wanted to keep his involvement private. He didn't argue, pulling the car over.

Oliver's cheerful mood vanished. He clung to her arm. "Mommy, you have to come back! Don't forget me!"

"Don't worry. We pinky swore, remember? I'll find you as soon as I'm done." She gave his hair one last ruffle and stepped out.

As she passed the driver's side, Nathaniel rolled down the window. His voice was a deep, steady reassurance. "Call me if you need anything."

Lately, her heart did a strange, heavy thump whenever she looked at him. She pushed the feeling aside. "Don't worry. I can handle the small problems, at least." She turned and walked toward the manor with confident strides.

Nathaniel watched her go, a slight frown forming. Sometimes, he wished she was just an ordinary woman...

Inside the Montgomery Manor's grand hall, the entire family was gathered.

Eleanor was wailing dramatically. "Dad, this truly wasn't Victoria's fault! Gabriella was the one sentenced to jail! How could you give ten percent of Victoria's shares to an outsider like Isabella?"

"I object as well!" Frederick protested. "Isabella now holds twenty-five percent! That's more than my wife and me combined. It's completely unfair!"

The room erupted in noisy agreement. They didn't care about Victoria's guilt. They only cared that valuable shares were in the hands of an outsider.

William sat with his eyes closed, listening to the chaos. After a moment, he opened them. "Are you all finished? Are you attempting to rebel against me now?" Though his voice was soft, his age and authority made it ring with undeniable power. The room fell silent.
###Chapter 153

Victoria’s sudden move caught everyone by surprise. She tried to backtrack quickly. “Father, why would we ever fight you? All we want is what’s best for the family. Handing over most of our family shares to an outsider… it just doesn’t make sense.”

“That’s right,” Gregory chimed in, frustration clear in his tone. “Even if Victoria was somehow involved… taking her shares is one thing. But why give them to Isabella? She isn’t one of us.”

William’s eyes hardened. “How many times must I say it? Isabella grew up in this house. She lost her parents—we are her family. She is not an outsider!

“Since she returned from Africa, has she brought any disgrace to this family? Look at what Victoria has done! Anyone with half a brain can see the truth!”

Victoria’s face went pale. The old man clearly didn’t trust her at all. She quickly put on a pitiful expression and weakly stepped toward him. “Grandfather, I know you suspect me, but I am innocent. I would never hurt my sister. Gabriella did everything, I swear to heaven. I would never—”

“Enough.” William’s voice cut like ice. “You might fool a child with that act, but not me. I am neither a fool nor an idiot!” He struck his cane hard against the floor, silencing her.

Victoria’s face lost even more color. She had gathered everyone here today hoping to reclaim her ten percent share, but the old man was being impossibly stubborn.

Why did he favor an adopted child so much? Over the past five years, she had contributed so much to the family. She brought them honor, bought expensive gifts. Ten percent was a fortune… and it was going to Isabella?

No. She would get it back, no matter what it took. Her eyes burned with fierce determination, though she masked it behind a veil of tears.

“If Grandfather doesn’t believe me, and no one here does either… then fine. Assume I did it. Assume I am guilty of everything. I’ll give my life to make up for it! Mother, Father, thank you for raising me. I’ll repay you in my next life.” With that, she lunged toward the wall, aiming to smash her head against it.

Screams erupted. Eleanor instinctively rushed forward and grabbed her. “Victoria, don’t be foolish! Stop this! I can’t lose you!”

“Let me die, Mother! Everyone suspects me! My fans hate me, my own family turns on me…” Victoria sobbed, tears streaming convincingly down her cheeks. Her voice grew hoarse. “It’s my fault for not guiding Gabriella properly. I deserve this punishment!”

Eleanor’s heart shattered. But just as she opened her mouth to plead—

“Let her hit the wall. Let’s see if she actually does it.”

A cold, clear voice cut through the chaos. Everyone turned.

Isabella strode into the hall. She wore a smoke-gray gradient tube dress with bold crimson floral patterns. A phoenix was embroidered across her chest, radiating elegance and power.

Victoria’s eyes narrowed instantly. Why was this bitch here? Dressed so boldly, so fearlessly, while she was at her lowest? And now Isabella might actually make her go through with it!

Eleanor was furious. “What did you just say, Isabella?! Victoria is your sister! She always protected you since you were little! How can you be so cruel? Are you even human?”
###Chapter 154

“What?”

Care? Protection?

Victoria had encouraged laziness since childhood, ensuring Isabella would never amount to anything. She pushed for outrageous fashion choices, praising cheap and tasteless outfits. Victoria systematically molded her into the family’s black sheep. Was this the care William spoke of?

Isabella remained utterly unfazed. “Who’s the real monster here? Who harmed countless people just to get to me, then played the innocent victim? Victoria Kensington, you should be an actress, not a model.”

“Your performance is Oscar-worthy. Should I record this and post it online? You’d go viral.”

Victoria’s face tightened. Isabella was cornering her! The sheer audacity!

She masked her rage with a wounded expression. “Isabella, what will make you believe me? If Mother hadn’t stopped me, I would have died crashing into that wall. But she was right. What would happen to her if I died? She raised me all these years. I can’t let her suffer that loss.”

“I’ll swear it, okay? I swear to God: If I had any part in this, may my parents disown and despise me. May I die a lonely, abandoned orphan!” Victoria vowed, pouring every ounce of fake sincerity into her trembling voice.

The room fell silent. The oath was brutal. Pity for her apparent anguish filled the air. Even William’s stern gaze softened slightly. Had he misjudged her?

Isabella watched the theatrics with cold amusement. A cruel vow? She was already an orphan her real parents never wanted.

Victoria continued her lament, playing the misunderstood, unloved daughter.

‘If she loves acting so much, I’ll give her a standing ovation,’ Isabella thought, a sharp smile playing on her lips. “I might have believed you. Sadly, I have proof.” She flung a stack of photos at Victoria.

The images were from the Mercedes Auto Show backstage. One captured a knowing glance between Victoria and Isadora. Another showed Victoria’s venomous stare directed at her agent. A third clearly displayed a money transfer from Victoria to Isadora.

The amount was $19,500. The exact price Silas the dealer quoted for the halophilic bacteria. The transaction date matched Isadora’s court testimony perfectly.

Shocked gasps echoed through the room. Disbelief was etched on every face.

“My God! How could Victoria be so wicked?”

“The evidence is undeniable. She’s clearly involved.”

“What did Isabella ever do to deserve such hatred? She looks murderous!”

“Heavens! And she put on that whole show! Smashing her head! That horrible vow! Unbelievable!”

“This is terrifying! I always thought she was so kind. But look at her in these photos… She’s a monster!”

The room erupted into chaos. Eleanor, who had been holding Victoria, slowly pulled her hand away. Her voice shook. “Victoria… What is this?”
###Chapter 155

Victoria’s face drained of all color.
She never imagined Isabella would obtain the backstage CCTV footage.
Those printed photos were her complete undoing.
She knew everything would collapse once her family saw this evidence.

Panic set in immediately.
“Mother, you must believe me!” she pleaded frantically.
“Please, trust me! I was only practicing poses for the upcoming show!
The exhibition required dramatic angles and expressions—I was just getting into character!

“As for the transaction record… Isadora told me she needed financial help.
I transferred the money without knowing what it was for!”

Her excuses sounded ludicrous.
No reasonable person would believe such a flimsy story.
Even if Isadora had wanted to borrow money, she would’ve asked for a round number—like 20,000.
Not the suspiciously exact sum of 19,500, which matched the price of the halophilic bacteria.

Eleanor’s mind spun into disarray.
For the first time, she felt genuine doubt toward Victoria.
Was the daughter she thought she knew hiding a sinister side?
Did she truly understand the woman standing before her?

William’s gaze hardened as he stared at the photos.
“Guards!” he commanded. “Take Victoria to the prayer hall.
She will kneel in reflection for three days and three nights.
No food. No water. No visitors.”

Three days of kneeling? No sustenance?
Victoria’s legs gave out beneath her.
Without Eleanor’s support, she crumpled to the floor.
She had never faced punishment like this before.

If word got out that she was confined to the prayer hall, she would become a social pariah.
Her reputation would be ruined forever.
Terror seized her. She clutched Eleanor’s arm desperately.
“Mother, please! Help me! You know this isn’t me!
You raised me—you know I would never harm my sister!

“This is Isabella’s doing! She’s jealous of the attention you give me!
She manipulated these images to destroy me!”

Eleanor’s frown deepened.
She studied the photos again, and a cold dread settled in her chest.
These weren’t trick angles.
The malice in Victoria’s expression was real.
It was terrifying.

She had always believed Victoria was gentle and kind.
How could she possess such darkness?

Heart heavy, Eleanor sighed. “Perhaps some time alone will do you good, Victoria.
I need time to think as well.”

Victoria’s grip slackened.
She collapsed fully onto the ground, defeated.
It was over. Even her mother had turned against her.

Maids approached to escort her away.
No one spoke in her defense.
Not even William, who usually doted on her—his face was stern and contemplative.

Victoria knew she had lost.
There would be no mercy this time.

“If I must go, then I will accept my punishment.
Grandfather, Father, Mother… please take care these next few days.
Don’t worry about me. This is my fault.”

She knelt and knocked her forehead hard against the floor.
A red mark immediately bloomed on her skin.
She didn’t flinch.
Tears streamed silently as the maids led her away.
Her slight frame trembled with each step.

Eleanor’s heart broke watching her leave.
Victoria had always been her favorite.
She had never disciplined her so harshly before.
But maybe it wasn’t too late to correct her.
As a mother, she had to try.

William released a heavy sigh.
“Everyone is dismissed. What happened today does not leave this room.”

The crowd had come hoping to reclaim the ten percent shares.
Now it was clear that wouldn’t happen.
They left in quiet disappointment.

As Eleanor passed Isabella near the doorway, she remembered Isabella’s words from the day before:
‘You always defend Victoria. You always take her side. But when have you ever listened to me?’
###Chapter 156

Isabella remembered Eleanor's words from yesterday.
She recalled the loneliness in Eleanor's eyes.
It made her pause and reconsider.

She turned back to face Isabella directly.
"Would you like to stay for lunch today?"

Stay for lunch...
This was the first gentle invitation since Africa.

Isabella considered her own plans.
She nodded. "I'd like that."

Eleanor called out immediately.
"Aunt Judy, prepare lunch for us."

Aunt Judy hurried off to the kitchen.
The entire household staff suddenly became active.

It was Isabella's first meal here in five years.
But not everyone seemed pleased.

People like Frederick remained distant.
Tiffany's mistake didn't erase their suspicions.

To them, Isabella was still the outsider.
The one who took twenty-five percent of the family shares.

They dispersed without acknowledging her.
Isabella didn't seem to care either.

She spent time talking with Theodore.
They spoke for quite a while before he left for business.

Then Isabella headed toward the prayer hall.
She wouldn't miss seeing Victoria's punishment.

As she walked down the hallway, a figure appeared.
It was Alexander.

Dressed in his usual black suit.
The successful, handsome businessman.

Isabella frowned.
Why was he here at the manor?

Surprise flickered in Alexander's eyes.
He thought her reputation was ruined.

But she had proven her innocence.
The netizens were now apologizing and praising her.

Her fame had only grown stronger.
This woman was nothing like the one he knew five years ago.

She was stunning.
Captivating.

Isabella didn't even look at him.
She turned to leave.

Alexander moved quickly to block her path.
"Why are you avoiding me, Isabella? You weren't like this before!"

Isabella laughed coldly.
"You weren't like this either five years ago. Need a reminder?"

She kicked a pebble at her feet.
It flew through the air.

Bam!
The pebble shattered a plant vase perfectly.

Alexander's face darkened.
"I was doing what was best for you! That child was from a rapist! Did you really want to keep it?"

"Think about it. No one knows what happened. You're not as pure as Victoria, but having a child would ruin you completely."

"Wow. Should I thank you for that?" Isabella's laugh was sharp.

"You don't need to thank me. But consider getting back with me. Nathaniel is just playing with you."

"You act like you care, but you only want my assets," she sneered. "Besides, being with a man like Nathaniel is fine. What do you have to compete with him?"

She flipped her hair and walked away.
Furious, Alexander grabbed her wrist.

"You're testing my patience, Isabella!"
###Chapter 157

Alexander’s voice carried a clear, sharp edge of menace.

Isabella remained completely unfazed. “Testing my patience? You’re the one pushing it. I’ve held back from hitting you for a full minute. Do you really want to keep talking?” She shoved his hand away and flexed her fingers, knuckles cracking softly.

She added coldly, “Instead of wasting my time here, why don’t you go check on your precious Victoria? She’s kneeling in the prayer hall right now. Do you honestly think someone that fragile can handle it?”

Alexander narrowed his eyes. He had come because Victoria texted him. Her messages were full of pain and sorrow, so he showed up to defend her. He thought the family adored her too much to punish her harshly. He was wrong.

“I’ll visit her soon enough,” he said darkly. “But you should think twice about being with Nathaniel. It won’t end well for you.” He turned and walked away.

Isabella let out a soft, mocking laugh. A glint of calculation flashed in her eyes as she watched him leave. She had already pushed Victoria to her breaking point. Why not push a little harder? Make her suffer even more.

As Alexander strode off, he pulled out his phone and texted Victoria, concerned.

[What’s going on? Why did they make you kneel in the prayer hall? Was it because of Isadora? Tell me everything. I need to know how to help you.]

Victoria replied instantly.

[Yes. Isabella used cleverly edited photos to frame me. She convinced everyone! Alexander, my love, you have to help me. You know me better than anyone. Other than what happened five years ago, I’ve never hurt her. I’ve been trying to rebuild our relationship. I always hoped she would come back to you so we could move forward with our plans for the shares and the diamond mine. Why would I ruin everything now?]

Alexander remembered how Victoria invited Isabella to the Guci shoot. How she offered to be her prop. He believed every word she said.

He typed back, trying to soothe her. [Don’t worry. I’ll talk to Grandfather. Then I’ll come find you.]

Victoria was kneeling on the floor in the prayer hall, reading his text. A faint, smug smile touched her lips. Under Alexander’s influence, the old man would soften. Alexander was no ordinary man. She would be out of this miserable place soon. Even with a cushion, her knees ached. Every time someone passed by, she heard their whispers.

“Shh, quiet! Victoria is in there.”

“I can’t believe how cruel and evil she is. It’s shocking.”

“Never judge by appearances.”

Her fists clenched tightly. Useless maids. How dare they mock her? Once she was free, she would teach them respect.

Unexpectedly, the door creaked open. Thinking it was Alexander coming to rescue her, she turned eagerly… Only to be met with bitter disappointment. It was Isabella.
###Chapter 158

“What are you doing here, Isabella? Do you find this amusing?”

“And what if I do? You’ve done far worse to me. Am I not allowed to enjoy the show?” Isabella’s voice dripped with icy contempt as she stared down at the kneeling Victoria.

Victoria’s jaw tightened. “You vile creature, Isabella! You planned this all along, didn’t you? Spending three days in prison just to create a scandal and destroy me at the final hour. You tricked me into signing that compensation letter. This was your scheme from the start!” she shrieked.

“Surprisingly, you’re not completely stupid. But you missed one detail. I never had a recording of your conversation with Isadora. I fabricated that to frighten you. And these photos? I’ve had them for much longer than yesterday. Do you know why I held back? Because if I’d revealed them then, you wouldn’t have put on such a convincing performance for the family today. They never would’ve seen your true nature,” Isabella explained, her tone cool and dominating.

Victoria’s face flushed with rage. “You wicked witch! I’ll kill you! I swear I will!” She lunged, fingers clawing toward Isabella’s throat.

Isabella caught her wrists effortlessly, locking eyes with her. “If I’m wicked, what does that make you? If I hadn’t been cautious, I’d be behind bars right now. You tried to ruin me. I’m merely returning the favor. Haven’t you done enough damage over the past five years? Did you really think I’d just stand by and let you walk all over me again?”

“Let go of me!” Victoria snarled. “Who are you to judge? You’re the one who forced me to take those nude photos that went viral! You set me up during the Guci shoot! You’ve been sabotaging my reputation from the start! I despise you! I want to tear you apart! You vicious monster… I won’t forget this!”

“You’re right. I am vicious,” Isabella smirked. “But I’ve done worse. Take a look. Who’s at the door?”

Victoria turned. Alexander stood there, his expression shattered. Her face went white. Her lips trembled. “Al… Alexander, my love.”

Alexander could scarcely believe what he had just witnessed. The gentle, kind-hearted Victoria he thought he knew was nothing but a facade. Moments earlier, she had convinced him she was the victim of a smear campaign. He had even met with William to plead her case. William had refused to listen, and Alexander had been desperately searching for a way to save her. Now the truth was staring him in the face.

He looked at Victoria, his voice strained with disbelief. “What did you mean about Isabella forcing you to take those photos? You told me you didn’t care about winning the Guci contract. Yet you harmed all those models and framed Isabella over it?”

He couldn’t process it. After their last conversation, he had given her space to recover while he tried to reason with Isabella. If Isabella remained stubborn, he was prepared to expose her secrets…

All this time… Victoria had been scheming behind his back?

Victoria scrambled to her feet and clutched his arm. “Alexander, darling, I was just angry. Isabella provoked me! She was cruel, and I said those things to upset her. You heard how she treated me!”

“No. Answer me. What about the nude photos? What did you mean—she forced you? You told me she photoshopped them!”

If Isabella had forced her, that meant the photos were real. She had been lying to him from the very beginning. Victoria’s face lost all color. Her mind raced, scrambling for an excuse, but… What was left to say?
###Chapter 159

Isabella interpreted Victoria’s silence as guilt. Her voice remained icy and detached. “Mr. Whitmore, there’s no need for such anger. It’s really quite simple. She attempted to have me killed in a fabricated car accident. I obtained the evidence and used it as leverage. In exchange, I demanded she send me a compromising photograph. Judging by her… provocative pose, you must consider yourself a fortunate man.”

“Stop it! Just stop talking!” Victoria shrieked, her composure shattering.

Isabella had no more patience for their impending drama. She had far more important matters to attend to. Her objective had been to reveal Victoria’s true nature to Alexander. Mission accomplished. “Take all the time you need to sort this out. Just try not to make a scene.” A cold smirk played on her lips as she turned on her heel. Before exiting, she delivered a final blow. “Oh, and one more thing. Mother specifically invited me to stay for lunch today. She mentioned owing me an apology.”

Victoria’s fists clenched so tightly her knuckles turned white. That was her mother! Hers alone! Why did Isabella insist on stealing everything from her? Yet, she dared not utter another word. She had already lost the trust of so many. She could not afford to lose Alexander’s affection as well.

She desperately latched onto Alexander’s arm, her voice a frantic plea. “Alexander, my love, please, you have to listen to me! Everything I did… I did it all for you! Just to be with you! You know how it’s been since Isabella returned to Westchester. She’s been out for my blood from the very beginning! She was the one who swapped my Meteorite Jade Buddha! She told me herself—she wants to take everything from me! This is all revenge for what happened five years ago!”

“I was terrified! That’s why I thought… if I ended it decisively, it would all be over. But I failed. She threatened me with the evidence! She forced me to send that… that picture! She made me do it! She’s the one tormenting me! How could I not despise her?”

“My plan was to ruin her reputation! To make Nathaniel so disgusted he’d cast her aside! Then you could finally have her! I was doing it all so you could secure her shares and assets faster! So we could be together sooner and live happily ever after! You have to believe me! You have to understand!” Her voice was raw, hoarse with desperation as she begged for his belief.

Alexander stared at her, his gaze clouded with doubt and a chilling distance that had never been there before. “I hear your words, Victoria. But why the deception? Why lie to me repeatedly? I have never once been dishonest with you!”

“I… Alexander, my darling, I was so scared. Terrified you would hate me. That you’d be repulsed by me… I only ever wanted to support you from the shadows. To present only the best version of myself to you…” She clung to his arm, shaking it gently, her eyes pleading. “Please, Alexander, don’t hate me. Please, don’t…”

Alexander let out a heavy, weary sigh. He gently patted her shoulder, the gesture lacking its usual warmth. “Victoria, you are clearly distraught. You need to rest. I will… visit another day.” With that, he firmly extracted his arm from her grasp and strode away without a backward glance.

Victoria staggered backward as if struck. A sharp gasp escaped her lips. The reality of his rejection hit her like a physical blow.

Had his love for her truly vanished? Did he despise her now? How? Why?! Everyone’s hatred should be directed at Isabella! Why was she the one being shunned? This was all Isabella’s fault! Every bit of it!

She would make her pay. She would make Isabella Montgomery pay dearly for this.

Kneeling alone in the vast, silent prayer hall, her mind churned, weaving new threads of malice and vengeance.
###Chapter 160

Alexander’s mind kept replaying Victoria’s venomous glare long after he stepped out of the prayer room.

Isabella was ruthless, but she never pretended otherwise. She made no effort to conceal her nature from him.

Victoria, however, had perfected the art of playing the innocent victim. Her true self was hidden behind a mask of fragility.

She was pure evil.

He couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that she had tried to kill Isabella in a staged accident. She had even harmed other models in the process.

She let her most loyal agent, Isadora, take the full blame.

The thought made his skin crawl. His image of the sweet, gentle Victoria was shattered forever.

The Montgomery family butler approached him. “Mr. Whitmore,” he said politely. “Would you care to stay for lunch?”

Alexander glanced toward the dining hall. His eyes immediately found Isabella seated beside William.

Her outfit wasn’t particularly flashy today. Yet her powerful, striking presence was impossible to ignore.

For the first time, he looked at her without disgust. He almost found her… compelling.

He adjusted his suit jacket and walked over.

A maid promptly set a place for him. Eleanor noticed him and spoke in a concerned tone. “You’re here, Alexander? I assume you’ve heard what happened?”

Alexander nodded as he took his seat. The family members exchanged uneasy glances.

Alexander was known as the ‘National Husband’ throughout Westchester. He was the most sought-after bachelor in the city… after the Blackwood men, of course.

The Blackwoods were in a league of their own. Their family’s wealth spanned over a century.

Even if they retired from all business ventures, their assets would still dwarf every other wealthy family in Westchester.

While others scrambled for resources, the Blackwoods never broke a sweat. Everyone wanted to partner with them.

They were the elite among elites. Far beyond the reach of a family like the Montgomerys.

That made Alexander the ideal son-in-law for the Montgomery family. A marriage between them would bring significant benefits to both sides.

Eleanor sighed and tried to smooth things over. “Alexander, please don’t take this to heart. I know Victoria made a mistake, but hasn’t everyone? This is her first serious error since she was a child. I’m sure she’ll learn from it.”

“Yes,” Penelope agreed quickly. “Victoria is a good girl. She’s always been kind and virtuous. Maybe she just had a momentary lapse… I hope you can overlook it.”

Penelope had to side with Eleanor. Her daughter, Sophia, was confined to the estate. Her husband was useless. If Victoria’s engagement to Alexander fell through, their situation would become even more difficult.

Alexander wanted to forget the whole thing. But once the topic was raised, he couldn’t help recalling Victoria’s sinister expression. It was nothing like the Victoria he thought he knew.

He took a sip of soup. “Don’t worry. I grew up with Victoria. I’ve always seen her as a younger sister. Why would I look down on her?”

The atmosphere at the table shifted immediately. Even William frowned. “A sister? Alexander, are you joking?”

After what happened to Isabella, Alexander had spent most of his time with Victoria. He had proposed to her multiple times. And now he called her a ‘little sister’?

Isabella leaned back in her chair, looking thoroughly amused. ‘This idiot is about to stir the pot again. Where’s my popcorn?’
###Chapter 161

As predicted, Alexander’s gaze swept toward Isabella before addressing the room. “Everyone here knows Isabella Montgomery was once my fiancée. I’ve loved her since we were children. Had it not been for… certain events, we would already be married.”

He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. “After everything happened, I was lost. Victoria was there for me. I mistook that comfort for love.” His voice grew softer, more intimate. “But seeing Isabella again made me realize the truth. My heart has always belonged to her.” His eyes, full of manufactured tenderness, locked onto Isabella. “This isn’t a sudden decision. I even confessed my true feelings to Victoria weeks ago.”

He was effectively using Victoria to validate his fabricated narrative.

Isabella nearly scoffed aloud. The audacity of this man, lying with such conviction. He was utterly repulsive.

Before she could interject, William Kensington’s voice cut through the tension. “You proposed to Victoria! You can’t just oscillate between sisters. It’s disrespectful!”

“Grandfather Kensington,” Alexander implored, his expression the picture of solemn sincerity. “You’ve known me my whole life. You know my character. I would never intentionally toy with anyone’s affections. My history with Isabella… our engagement, the tokens we exchanged… it spans fifteen years. From when she was just a child. What I had with Victoria was brief in comparison.” His performance was masterful, dripping with a pain that felt almost real.

Even William, initially furious, seemed momentarily swayed by the emotional display. “So,” he asked, his tone gentler, “you truly hold no regard for the incident five years ago against her?”

Alexander drew himself up, embodying noble forgiveness. “None whatsoever. As Mrs. Kensington said, everyone makes mistakes. Isabella was young. I was immature. It’s in the past.”

William sighed, turning his attention to his granddaughter. “Isabella? What are your thoughts on this?”

He knew of her long-held affection for this man. Her feelings had to be considered.

Eleanor Kensington watched, her emotions conflicted. Both were her daughters, though she favored Victoria. She knew a marriage without genuine love was a hollow cage. “If Isabella can move past it,” she ventured, “perhaps it’s for the best. Given the scandal from before… others might not be so accepting.” She looked directly at Isabella. “Well? You were engaged once. If you’re willing, we can begin preparations immediately.”

“How very considerate,” Isabella replied, a slight, icy arch to her brow. Her gaze was flat and dismissive as it landed on Alexander. “But no. I don’t go back for trash I’ve already taken out.”

Alexander’s face tightened imperceptibly. She was publicly humiliating him. After he’d offered her this gracious way back in? Now that she was Nathaniel Blackwood’s mistress, she thought she could act with such impunity?

A stunned silence fell over the room. No one had expected such a blunt, brutal rejection from the woman once known for her hopeless devotion.

Penelope Sinclair, whose daughter was still confined because of Isabella, seized the moment to sneer. “Of course. Our Isabella is the Diamond Boss now, swimming in assets. Why would she settle? She certainly has the attitude to match now.”

“Attitude?” Isabella’s retort was sharp and immediate. “Victoria wronged me repeatedly. I possessed evidence I could have handed to the police and the media. I showed restraint.” She let that hang in the air before continuing, her tone shifting to one of mock concern. “My refusal has nothing to do with Alexander himself. It’s out of consideration for Victoria. She is, after all, still my sister. How would it look if I took her discarded fiancé? What would that do to her?”
###Chapter 162

“Victoria stayed with you for five entire years. She gave you her most precious youth. Just because she made one terrible mistake, you want to come back to me? How do you think that makes her feel?” Isabella spoke with convincing emotion, every word dripping with feigned sincerity.

‘Hypocrisy is a language Victoria understands well. Now that her reputation is in ruins, it’s time to strip her of everything she has left,’ Isabella thought coldly.

As anticipated, the expressions of William, Frederick, and Eleanor shifted instantly. They had always viewed Isabella as ruthless and unfeeling. They never imagined she possessed such empathy.

Alexander grew visibly irritated. How could she twist his intentions like this? He couldn’t tolerate her narrative.

“I already discussed this with Victoria. She said herself she wants us to be happy. We had a history long before her, so she understands. I know you kept our engagement ring. You never returned it, even after you came back. You must still cherish what we had, don’t you?”

“The ring? I’d forgotten all about it until you mentioned it. I tossed it into a garbage bin somewhere in Africa. If you need it for another proposal, I can send people to look for it,” Isabella replied dismissively. “I’ll ensure you and Victoria can be together properly.”

Her tone then sharpened into a warning. “Even if Victoria tells you she understands, it doesn’t mean she isn’t hurting inside. She’s always been kind and self-sacrificing, bearing her pain alone. Her willingness to let you go only confirms my decision. I will never be with you again.”

Alexander was rendered speechless. How did she always manage to turn the situation around so effortlessly?

Eleanor felt a pang of sympathy. She never thought Isabella could be so considerate. Even Frederick sided with Isabella for once. He turned to Alexander. “Victoria hasn’t been herself lately. How would she feel about you abandoning her for Isabella?”

“Alexander, you’ve been with Victoria for five years. Since Isabella clearly has no feelings for you, you should make your choice clear and treat Victoria better. If you hurt her, I will not forgive you.”

With the momentum against him, Alexander had no choice. “Of course,” he conceded.

He still had time to execute his plan.

After lunch, Isabella had other matters to attend to. She bid the family farewell and left the manor.

Alexander quickly followed her. He caught up and grabbed her arm. “Isabella, we’re alone now. You can drop the act. Have you considered what I said? Do you truly believe Nathaniel is in love with you?”

“Huh? Is there a dog barking? I hear incessant yapping. It’s so annoying!” Isabella sneered, pulling her arm from his grasp. She walked away without looking back.

Alexander’s face darkened. He glared at her retreating figure, his fists clenched tightly.

‘Isabella, you leave me no choice...!’ he seethed silently.

Isabella walked out through the main gates toward the road. She was about to call for a taxi when she noticed a sleek black car parked nearby. Wasn't that Nathaniel’s car? Why was he still here? Frowning, she began walking toward it.
###Chapter 163

Isabella approached the vehicle, her steps slowing as she took in the scene. Nathaniel sat motionless in the driver's seat, eyes closed, while Oliver slept soundly in the back. Dappled sunlight filtered through the canopy above, casting shifting patterns across Nathaniel's sharp features. The crisp white shirt he wore seemed to glow under the golden light, enhancing his aristocratic bearing.

An unexpected warmth bloomed in her chest. How long had they been waiting? Her meeting had lasted nearly four hours. "Nathaniel?" she called softly, her voice barely above a whisper.

His eyes opened instantly, dark and alert. Recognizing her, he straightened in his seat. "Finished?"

She nodded, studying him closely. "You waited here the whole time? Without eating?"

"Oliver insisted on staying. My schedule was clear today anyway." His tone was casual, dismissive. He moved to exit the car, but as his feet touched the pavement, his legs buckled. He stumbled forward, catching himself against her.

Isabella reacted instinctively, her hands flying to his waist to steady him. For a moment they stood frozen, her cheek pressed against the solid wall of his chest, his body leaning into hers. The scent of his cologne filled her senses—clean and masculine.

Two heartbeats passed before she regained her composure, pushing him upright. "What's wrong?"

"Pins and needles." His voice was tight, his expression carefully neutral. "From sitting too long."

She opened the rear door without hesitation. "Get in the back with Oliver. I'll drive."

Nathaniel stared at her, surprised by the command. When he didn't move, she added firmly, "I'm not letting someone with numb legs drive. It's a safety issue—for all of us."

Reluctantly, he slid into the backseat, settling Oliver's sleeping form across his lap. This was a first—being chauffeured by a woman. But Isabella handled the vehicle with confident precision, her movements smooth and controlled. She drove with unusual care, clearly mindful of her sleeping passenger.

Nathaniel found himself watching her—the way her hands rested lightly on the wheel, the focused set of her shoulders. An unfamiliar sense of peace settled over him.

Instead of heading directly to the Montgomery estate, she pulled into an upscale restaurant parking lot. Isabella emerged from the driver's seat and opened their door. "Let's eat."

Nathaniel hadn't expected such consideration. He gathered Oliver in his arms just as the boy stirred awake. Bleary eyes focused on Isabella, and immediately brightened. "Mommy! Mommy!" Oliver reached for her, his small arms waving excitedly.

Isabella took him, gently pinching his cheek. "You're awake now? Why did you wait for me outside? Next time, wait at home, promise?"

Oliver blinked, then glanced at Nathaniel. "Well...I wanted to go home, but Daddy said—"

A sharp cough from Nathaniel cut him off. "Are you hungry, Oliver?"

The boy's eyes lit up with understanding. "Oh! Right! I begged Daddy to wait! I was scared you'd forget about me." He beamed at Nathaniel before turning back to Isabella. "Yes, I'm starving! Let's eat, Mommy!"

Isabella's lips curved into a faint smile. She'd play along with their little charade—for now. Cradling Oliver in her arms, she led the way into the restaurant.
###Chapter 164

Nathaniel exhaled softly in relief. ‘Thank goodness. Dad made me promise to protect his image in front of Isabella. If she finds out he was waiting outside like a lovesick fool, it would ruin everything.’

The restaurant was one of Westchester’s most exclusive establishments, renowned for its impeccable privacy and discreet service. Its staff were accustomed to hosting high-profile celebrities and dignitaries, so the appearance of Nathaniel Blackwood and Isabella Montgomery caused no visible stir. The doorman greeted them with practiced calm.

“Good evening.”

The manager recognized Nathaniel immediately and glided forward. “Mr. Blackwood, your usual room is ready.”

Nathaniel maintained a permanent private dining suite here. It remained reserved for him, regardless of whether he had a reservation.

Once they were seated in the elegant, soundproofed room, Nathaniel turned his gaze to Isabella. His voice was infused with a soft, almost tender warmth. “What would you like to order?”

The manager nearly faltered, stunned by the unfamiliar gentleness in Nathaniel’s tone. Nathaniel Blackwood never brought women here. Seeing him with Isabella Montgomery was a revelation.

Isabella settled Oliver into his chair. “I’ve already eaten. Just order for yourself and Oliver.” She handed the menu to the boy. “What would you like, sweetheart?”

“Hmm…” Oliver pondered, tapping his chin dramatically before brightening. “The pork chop! And the crispy chicken wings! And the special family platter!”

“Excellent choices,” the manager said, inputting the order onto his tablet.

Nathaniel added one more savory dish and then swiped to the dessert menu. “We’ll also have the signature chocolate fondant cake.”

“Right away, sir,” the manager replied, bowing slightly before exiting to place their order.

Isabella raised a skeptical eyebrow at Nathaniel. “Since when do you have a sweet tooth? I thought that was more of a… feminine preference.”

Nathaniel’s eyes held hers. “It’s for you. I thought you might want something to enjoy while we eat.”

Her heart gave a traitorous, frantic leap against her ribs. Why did he have to be so perceptive? So damn considerate?

“I need to use the restroom. Watch Oliver for me.”

Nathaniel gave a single nod. “Of course. Be careful.”

Isabella stood and left the room, her mind a whirlwind of conflicted emotions. In just two days, the dynamic between them had shifted into something dangerously intimate. If this continued, she was terrified she’d fall for him completely, irrevocably.

Inside the restroom’s opulent silence, she braced her hands on the cool marble vanity and stared at her reflection. ‘Isabella Montgomery, get a grip! You cannot fall for Nathaniel Blackwood! You’re leaving in six months. This can’t happen… it just can’t!’

The restroom door swung open, breaking her reverie.

A woman walked in. It was Genevieve Beaumont.

Recognition flashed in Genevieve’s eyes, followed by a calculated gleam. “Isabella?” she exclaimed, her voice dripping with false warmth.

After the recent scandal, Genevieve had made herself scarce. She couldn’t risk anyone discovering she was the one who leaked the video to Isadora. She knew Isabella was a formidable force, an enemy she couldn’t afford to make. For days, she’d tried every channel to contact Isabella, all failing. Running into her here was an unbelievable stroke of luck.

Isabella shot her a dismissive glance and moved to leave.

Genevieve quickly intercepted her. “Isabella, SilverPeak Entertainment is utterly serious about signing you. What’s the hesitation? We offer the absolute best resources, backed by immense capital. Have you heard of the Delacroix family from America? Oil magnates. Their resources dwarf even a diamond mine. SilverPeak has access to it all. Just sign with us, and we promise to make you the biggest star in the world.”

Isabella froze. The Delacroix family? Seraphina Delacroix’s family? She hadn’t known they invested in SilverPeak.

“Does Seraphina Delacroix know you’re trying to sign me? Did she actually agree to this?”

“Absolutely,” Genevieve affirmed smoothly. “When she heard, she personally instructed me to secure your contract at any cost.”

Isabella’s eyes narrowed into slits. What game was Seraphina playing now?
###Chapter 165

Genevieve Beaumont watched Isabella Montgomery carefully, believing she had finally swayed her. She leaned in closer, her voice dripping with false sincerity. “You might have immense wealth, Isabella, but this industry runs on connections and resources. It’s not just about having money.”

She ticked off points on her manicured fingers. “A top-tier career requires a full team. Resource coordination, fan engagement, strategic marketing, image retouching, intellectual property management… the list is endless.”

“A leading supermodel needs a support staff of at least twenty people. Handling it alone would be exhausting. Sign with SilverPeak Entertainment, and we handle everything for you.”

Isabella was well aware of these requirements. Her real question was about Seraphina Delacroix’s motive. She remembered clearly; Seraphina wanted to sign her to suppress her rising fame. Why would a woman known for her bitterness suddenly offer kindness?

“My apologies,” Isabella stated flatly, her expression unreadable. “But my team is already handling those matters.” She turned and walked toward the VIP exit.

Genevieve moved to follow, but the roped-off VIP aisle stopped her. Only those with exclusive access could proceed. Frustration boiled over. “Isabella Montgomery! A smart person recognizes a good opportunity! I’ve pursued you because I see your value! Don’t throw it away out of pride!”

Isabella didn’t bother to look back. She had no interest in a delusional woman’s rant. As she neared her table, a portly man stepped into her path.

His eyes lit up with recognition. “Isabella Montgomery! What a fortunate encounter! I’ve been trying to get in touch.” He eagerly extended a business card. “A pleasure to meet you.”

Isabella’s gaze dropped to the card without taking it. The embossed text read: Reginald Worthington, Chief Executive Officer, Golden Phoenix Entertainment.

Another entertainment executive.

She raised a cool eyebrow. “What is this about?”

“It’s simple,” he beamed, undeterred by her lack of enthusiasm. “You’ve recently entered the industry. We want to sign you. This meeting feels like fate! You’re a diamond magnate, correct? I made my initial fortune in mining, too. Coal, in my case.”

He puffed out his chest with pride. “My current net worth sits around fifty billion. I founded Golden Phoenix Entertainment. We’re a major player here. Recognise Xander… what’s-his-name? Or Nevil, the chart-topping singer? They’re both with us!”

The company name sounded familiar. Julian Hawthorne had mentioned them. SilverPeak was number one, Golden Phoenix was a close second. SilverPeak excelled at crafting celebrity images. Golden Phoenix was known for buying fame through massive financial investment. Naturally, they expected a high return. They were notorious for arranging private engagements for their stars. Whispers suggested some actresses earned eight figures in a single night. The darkest rumor was that Reginald started the company primarily to meet women…

Reginald mistook her silence for interest. He smiled, placing a familiar hand on her shoulder. “Isabella, sign with us. You’ll get our absolute best resources. First pick of anything you want. We can negotiate the profit split. Just name your terms!”

Isabella’s eyes flicked coldly to the hand on her shoulder. Her voice remained calm and detached. “Your offer is… persuasive, Mr. Worthington. But I have a dilemma. I just encountered Genevieve Beaumont, SilverPeak’s PR director. She made a very similar proposal. It puts me in a difficult position.”

“What? Genevieve is here? Where?” Reginald’s face darkened instantly. Golden Phoenix and SilverPeak were bitter rivals, constantly fighting over talent and awards. SilverPeak had snatched desired artists from him before. Was Isabella next?

Isabella gestured casually toward the restroom area. “Over there. She was quite vocal. Claimed her company was the industry’s undisputed best. Said Golden Phoenix wasn’t even in the same league. Those were her words.”

“The audacity! Wait right here. I need to have a word with her.” Reginald stormed off in the direction she indicated.

Genevieve was still by the restrooms, typing a furious message to Seraphina Delacroix. A booming voice interrupted her. “Genevieve Beaumont! What is your problem?!”
###Chapter 166

Genevieve spun around at the sound of her name. Reginald Worthington marched toward her with a scowl. Her lips curled into a mocking smile. "Mr. Worthington, for a CEO, you have zero class. Did your money just buy you arrogance?"

"What's it to you? You think you're better? Ha! A nobody like you shouldn't even dare to stand in my way. Listen carefully—Isabella Montgomery is signing with me. Try to interfere, and you'll regret it," Reginald snarled, hoping to intimidate her.

She raised a brow. "Isabella? She isn't signing with my agency either."

"Stop lying! You've been competing with SilverPeak from the start. Maybe you need a reality check. Should I expose how your so-called talents are all fakes?" he threatened.

To his surprise, Genevieve laughed. "Go ahead! Let's play this game. You reveal my fakes, and I'll reveal your dirty secrets. Hmph! You earn your money through disgraceful means."

"You... You witch! How dare you? I'll slap that smirk off your face!" Reginald raised his hand, trying to scare her.

Suddenly, something sharp hit the back of his knee. He stumbled forward in pain.

Smack!

His palm accidentally struck Genevieve's cheek.

Genevieve had never been hit since her rise to fame. Even her superiors tread carefully around her. She never expected Reginald would go this far.

Instantly, she saw red. "You arrogant bastard! How dare you hit me? This isn't over!"

Without a second thought, she swung her hand with all her might. A stinging pain shot through her palm as Reginald's head snapped to the side.

His entire body wobbled from the impact. A bright red palm print appeared on his face, with faint scratch marks from her nails.

Enraged, Reginald lunged at her. All hell broke loose.

His punches were met with her scratches. His kicks were countered by her heels. Pure chaos erupted.

On the sidelines, Isabella watched the scene unfold with satisfaction. A faint smile touched her lips as she turned and walked away.

They deserved this for scheming against her.

Reginald and Genevieve fought like wild animals. Only when hotel staff rushed in did they finally stop.

Even the police had to intervene to separate them.

"What? Isabella refused to sign with you?" Reginald asked, shocked.

"Yes! I told you already. I approached her multiple times, and she rejected me every time. If she wanted to join SilverPeak, she would have done it long ago. You never stood a chance," Genevieve snapped back.

Confused, Reginald muttered, "Then why did she tell me—"

Their eyes widened in unison as realization struck. They had been played.

"That witch set us up!" Reginald growled. "She pitted us against each other! Damn it... I'll make her pay!"

"Killing her is too easy," Genevieve replied quickly. "Let's join forces and destroy her career instead!" Reginald's eyes lit up. He liked the idea.

Both SilverPeak and Fortune Entertainment were industry giants. They controlled the entertainment world.

If they worked together, crushing a newcomer like Isabella would be simple.

She would suffer for messing with them.
###Chapter 167

The moment Isabella stepped into the private room, the uproar from Hubert and Genevieve's confrontation flooded the space.

Oliver, mid-bite into a crispy chicken wing, flinched at the sudden noise. "Mommy, what's all that yelling outside?"

"Just some stray dogs fighting." She shut the door firmly, sealing off the chaos.

Isabella settled beside him, gently dabbing his lips with a napkin. "Eat up. You need the energy."

"Okay! Try this cake, Mommy. It's super good!"

He speared a generous slice with his fork and held it out. Isabella leaned in, letting him carefully feed her.

Warmth spread through her chest. She never realized joy could be found in such simple moments.

Nathaniel watched their interaction from across the table, a slow smile gracing his features.

The meal was perfect.

Twenty minutes later, Nathaniel finished eating. Oliver was still happily munching on fried chicken while Isabella chatted with him. Nathaniel checked his phone for urgent messages.

Dominic's text glared back at him.

[Boss! Emergency! SilverPeak and Fortune Entertainment are colluding to blacklist Isabella! No one will sign her or collaborate. Anyone who does faces industry-wide boycott!]

SilverPeak and Fortune Entertainment controlled the industry's top talent. Defying them meant being relegated to third-tier artists permanently. No company could risk that.

Within an hour, news of Isabella's blackout spread rapidly. Everyone chose the safe side. Paparazzi scrubbed all online traces of her.

After last night's events, Isabella should have been the hottest new star. Her name dominated every headline and trended across all platforms. Then the blacklist announcement hit, and she vanished from the internet entirely.

Her name was purged from search results and trending topics. It was as if she never existed.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed dangerously. 'They dare target my woman?'

He kept the news from Isabella, quickly texting Dominic.

[Get her face on every national LED screen. Now.]

Dominic's reply was immediate. [Most slots are booked solid for months...]

[Buy them out. Pay any cancellation fees.] Nathaniel ordered.

[On it, Boss.] Dominic sprang into action.

Nathaniel was pulling out all the stops for the woman he loved. As his right hand, Dominic would fight alongside him.

Yet Nathaniel still felt uneasy. The Blackwood Corporation invested heavily across industries, except entertainment. They backed profitable ventures without hesitation. While financially secure, Isabella had no agency support after refusing to sign elsewhere. She only had GoldenPhoenix Entertainment.

Her company, GoldenPhoenix, had just signed three new artists. Other departments were still in early development.

His gaze shifted to Isabella. "How's GoldenPhoenix holding up? Need any assistance?"

"Progress is steady. We secured three talents quickly. Other sectors are still developing," she replied casually. "Don't worry about it."
###Chapter 168

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. “I can accelerate your company’s expansion.”

“Hmm?” Isabella finally sensed something unusual. “Is there a problem?”

Why was he suddenly offering to speed up her company’s growth? He had never mentioned it before.

Nathaniel’s face grew stern, but just as he was about to speak, Isabella’s phone rang.

She answered immediately. “Isabella,” Julian’s tense voice came through, “what exactly happened? Why is the entire industry blacklisting you?”

Major brands had been competing to collaborate with her after last night’s events, but all offers vanished within hours.

Isabella frowned. “Blacklisted? Today? I haven’t done anything...” Her voice trailed off as she recalled the incident with Reginald and Genevieve. “Less than an hour? That’s impressively fast,” she murmured, genuinely surprised.

“So you did cause trouble. How did you manage to get the entire entertainment industry to boycott you in one day?” Julian asked, utterly confused.

Nathaniel’s intense gaze remained fixed on Isabella, his brow furrowed. He wanted answers too.

Isabella twirled a strand of her hair, offering a faint smile. “It was nothing serious,” she explained casually, “though I might have provoked a conflict between Reginald and Genevieve...”

Julian was speechless. Those two were notoriously difficult personalities. He remembered specifically warning Isabella about them, yet she deliberately stirred trouble between them?

Unbelievable.

“Lay low for now. I’ll handle damage control.” Julian ended the call abruptly.

Isabella set her phone aside and noticed Oliver watching her with an amused expression. She gently ruffled his hair. “My sweet Christopher, eat well and grow strong. If anyone bullies you, tolerate it twice but never a third time. Fight back exactly like Mommy does.”

“Okay!” Oliver nodded enthusiastically, already imagining himself standing up to villains just like his mother.

Isabella then turned her attention back to Nathaniel. “You were saying? You want to help GoldenPhoenix expand faster?”

Nathaniel saw no reason for subtlety and nodded firmly. “It’s the most efficient solution currently.”

“But Julian and Adrian are still conducting interviews. They’re building a dedicated team from scratch—people who share our vision, possess strong teamwork, and demonstrate loyalty. Only with the right foundation can we achieve sustainable growth, and that requires time,” Isabella countered.

Building a company was like constructing a building—the foundation determined its stability. They couldn’t afford to compromise on integrity for short-term gains.

Nathaniel had always viewed her as ambitious, but he was pleasantly surprised by her maturity during this crisis. “I agree. A successful company requires a solid team.

They can take their time selecting members, but leave the rest to me,” he assured.

With the Blackwood family’s influence, no one would dare boycott Isabella.

Even without formal intervention, public opinion would shift simply by featuring her image on their properties.

“No need to rush,” Isabella responded calmly. “This isn’t worth deploying excessive force. I have everything under control. Your intervention isn’t necessary.”

“Explain your plan.” Nathaniel’s piercing eyes studied her as if attempting to read her thoughts.

“Yes, Mommy! Tell us! Daddy will worry endlessly otherwise,” Oliver chimed in supportively, deciding to advocate for his father. He added earnestly, “When you were detained, Daddy couldn’t sleep at all!”

An inexplicable tension suddenly filled the room between Nathaniel and Isabella.
###Chapter 169

Isabella recalled promising Nathaniel everything was handled. Yet he’d been so concerned about her he couldn’t sleep!

She quickly broke eye contact, shifting the topic. “Everyone’s watching these two entertainment giants because they’re using their top stars as bargaining chips,” she explained. “What if we recruit their artists instead? Strip them of their leverage.”

“Recruit them?” Nathaniel’s brow arched.

“Yes. I know GoldenPhoenix is new, but we’re not short on funds. Any problem solvable with money isn’t a real problem.”

She finally met his gaze again. “Guess how many would flock to us if I announced a hundred percent endorsement fee for anyone who signs with us.”

“A full hundred?” His hand gently touched her forehead. “Isabella, you’d make nothing.”

“I’ve earned enough these past five years. Now I just want to have fun,” she stated plainly, without a hint of boastfulness.

After a thoughtful pause, Nathaniel finally yielded. “Fine,” he murmured. “If you lose everything, I’ll support you.”

His words sent a flush to her cheeks, her heart hammering against her ribs. She silently cursed her reaction. “Ah, Oliver’s done. Let’s head home. We can discuss the rest later.”

“Okay!” Oliver washed his hands before grabbing Isabella’s.

Outside the restaurant, Oliver looked up at her. “Will you come home with us, Mommy?” he pleaded. “I want to sleep with you.”

Isabella meant to refuse, to say she needed to return to her own place. But Nathaniel interjected, “His condition can relapse within ten days after an episode.”

Keeping Oliver happy was crucial to prevent his health from deteriorating.

Isabella had no choice but to agree. “Alright, Mommy will sleep with you.”

She knew her career would soon leave little time for him. Besides, staying at the Blackwood estate and sharing his bed each night seemed manageable. Nothing else would happen, right?

She mentally braced herself for an extended stay.

Seraphina Delacroix sat calmly in the chairman’s office of SilverPeak Entertainment.

Thrilled that Isabella was effectively blacklisted online, a smug smile touched her lips. She glanced at Genevieve. “Keep a tight watch on Isabella. Ensure she has no opportunities. Let her languish in obscurity for a while before we extend another offer.”

“What? Sign her? Miss Delacroix, she went too far. I refuse to represent her!” Genevieve protested.

Seraphina smirked. “Who said anything about getting her jobs or making her famous? We sign her to bury her. I guarantee she’ll be forgotten in under six months.”

Seraphina had a point. Why hadn’t she thought of that? ‘Hmph! Isabella will pay for stealing Nathaniel and my best artists!’ Genevieve straightened up, eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Isabella would be begging them for a contract by then.

Desperate and contract-bound, Isabella’s hands would be tied.

Even with vast wealth, she’d never see the spotlight again without resources or opportunities.

Just as they basked in their scheme, an assistant burst into the office, frantic. “Miss Delacroix, terrible news! Most of our artists are coming to terminate their contracts!”

“What? Why?!” Seraphina’s blood ran cold.
###Chapter 170

SilverPeak Entertainment dominated the industry. Where would their artists go if contracts were terminated?

The assistant trembled uncontrollably before drawing a sharp breath. "Isabella just tweeted... Miss Delacroix... You need to see this yourself..."

She feared delivering the news directly.

Seraphina immediately grabbed her phone and opened Twitter. There it was—Isabella's post stating: (SilverPeak and Fortune Entertainment allied to crush me. Hilarious! Thinking you can destroy me is pure foolishness. Within ten days, any artist signing with GoldenPhoenix keeps one hundred percent of their earnings and negotiates their own contract terms. First ninety-nine signers also receive a DovEgg diamond ring!)

Despite being shadow-banned online, Isabella's loyal fans made the post go viral. The comments section erupted instantly.

(Boss Montgomery reigns supreme! Teach them a lesson!)

(Even the lowest quality DovEgg costs hundreds of thousands. Ninety-nine rings? Absolutely insane!!)

(Boss Montgomery, are you hiring? I'll be your janitor. No need for a full ring—just some diamond dust!)

Isabella tweeted again minutes later. (Every retweet enters you to win a house in any city of your choice.)

The offer was too irresistible. Urban property values soared astronomically—five figures per square foot. A free house meant instant wealth!

Retweets multiplied exponentially. Isabella trended worldwide once more.

Seraphina's face darkened. Her blood boiled like molten lava. Was Isabella insane? Burning her fortune to wage war?

Genevieve panicked visibly. "Miss Delacroix? What's our move? Losing all our artists means certain doom!"

"State the obvious. Weren't you hired as the crisis expert? Handle this now!" Seraphina commanded icily.

Genevieve stood dumbfounded. What solution existed now?

Artists stormed into the office simultaneously. They chanted in unison: "We demand contract termination. Immediately!"

Under SilverPeak, artists earned only 40% revenue—minus agent and team commissions. A fifty-million project yielded merely fifteen million.

Signing with GoldenPhoenix meant full fifty-million earnings. Even after team salaries, profits dwarfed SilverPeak's offers.

Genevieve attempted damage control. "Recall your contract terms! Breach penalties reach one billion! Can you afford that?"

"Isabella covers all penalties upfront!" an artist snapped back.

The response silenced Genevieve completely. She glanced helplessly at Seraphina.

This crisis exceeded her experience. She had no answers.

"Stop staring at me!" Seraphina snapped. "I'm just an investor! Where's the chairman? He needs to handle this mess!"

"No need! We're leaving regardless! We brought the cash!"

Artists slammed contracts onto the desk repeatedly. "Sign now. Payment ready. You'll pocket billions instantly."

Seraphina seethed with rage. She couldn't believe this nightmare.

Isabella even funded their penalty payments! Seraphina needed an escape plan—immediately.
###Chapter 171

Isabella’s eyes blazed with fury.
Her mind spun with countless possibilities.
She needed a way out of this trap.
Fast.

She snarled without hesitation.
“The company seal isn’t with me.
The chairman has it.
This discussion is over.”

She didn’t wait for a response.
She turned and strode toward the door.

The celebrities surged forward instantly.
They blocked her path like a human wall.
“You’re not leaving! You’re the majority shareholder!
We need your signature!”

“You’ve exploited us long enough!
We have the money right here!
Just sign the damn papers!”

“Sign them! No signature, no exit!”

They sealed every possible escape route.

Cornered, Isabella shrieked for help.
“Security! Get in here now!”

Armed guards burst into the room.
Genevieve moved swiftly to shield Isabella.
A chaotic scuffle erupted.
They fought their way out through the crowd.

Both women looked disheveled afterward.
Their clothes were rumpled, hair a mess.
They looked like they’d survived a riot.

Inside the car, Genevieve smoothed her dress.
She let out a heavy sigh.
“Thank God you thought quickly.
That could have ended much worse.”

Isabella’s lips curled coldly.
“Did Victoria really think her little scheme would break me?
Contact every senior executive.
No one returns to the company.
No one signs those termination contracts.”

“Understood.”

The artists had no choice but to wait.
They lingered at the company headquarters.
Hoping a manager might show up.
Hoping someone would finally set them free.

Isabella had to stabilize the company first.
Then she would deal with Victoria.

Isabella received the update while supervising Oliver’s homework.
She stepped onto the balcony.
Julian’s call came through.

“It’s fine,” Isabella said lightly.
“Even if the contracts aren’t terminated, we’ve won.
Haven’t we?”

Julian paused.
Then it clicked.
Their real goal was to isolate Victoria.

After Isabella’s social media post, both companies were in chaos.
They were too busy with internal fires to target her.

Many in the industry feared her dominance.
If they boycotted her now, their artists would defect to GoldenPhoenix.

And her company was giving away Dovegg diamond rings.
Every artist chased profit.
No one would refuse free luxury.

Suddenly, endorsement offers flooded in.
Everyone wanted to collaborate with her again.

“Killing two birds with one stone. Well done.
I’ve filtered the endorsement invites.
Made a first-round selection.
You can choose from the shortlist,” Julian said.
“Now that Victoria is out, it’s your time to shine.”

“Don’t worry. When she returns,
I’ll make sure she has nowhere left to go.”
A dangerous smile touched her lips as she ended the call.

Seconds later, Julian sent the list.
Top brands from cosmetics, fashion, eyewear, and more.
His note followed:
[Amor Group’s shoot is at Greenwish Park.
Close to The Grand Monarch.
You’ll stay there overnight.]

Isabella’s hand trembled slightly.
The Grand Monarch.
Five years had passed.
Could she face the ghosts of that night?

Maybe she could find clues about what really happened.

She steadied herself.
Researched Amor Group.

Amor was a luxury fashion powerhouse.
Specialized in bridal wear.
Their designers were elite, obsessive.
Victoria had been their ambassador.

Victoria had the figure of a goddess.
The grace of a storybook princess.
Her noble aura captivated millions.

Isabella’s smile turned icy.
She would replace Victoria.
No matter what.
She told herself she was strong enough.
Strong enough to survive one night at The Grand Monarch.
###Chapter 172

Isabella sent her final terms to Julian Hawthorne. (Amor Group deal is confirmed.)

Julian immediately executed the arrangements upon her acceptance.

She stepped back inside from the balcony. The matter was settled.

Her eyes fell on Christopher. The boy sat staring blankly at his open textbook.

He seemed deeply troubled.

She moved closer to him. Her voice was soft. "What's wrong, sweetheart? Do you need help?"

He looked up, his small face creased with worry. "It's my assignment. I have to write about 'family'. About Daddy, Mommy, Grandpa, and Grandma." He sighed. "I have Mommy. But I don't have a grandpa or a grandma."

Isabella was taken aback. "That can't be right, Christopher. You have wonderful grandparents. Mommy remembers them."

She knew Nathaniel's father came from a long line of renowned physicians. A man decorated with countless medical awards. His mother was born into an elite perfumery dynasty. Her family's signature fragrance once sold for a staggering nine figures.

"They don't love me, though," Christopher mumbled, his voice barely a whisper. It was filled with a sadness that shouldn't belong to a child.

This was new. Isabella had never heard him speak like this before. Her brow furrowed.

"Listen to me," she said firmly, kneeling to his level. "Everyone loves you. You are a wonderful, lovely boy. You know that, right?"

Any trace of happiness vanished from his face. "Grandpa and Grandma don't like me. They said my mommy was a bad woman. So they think I'm bad, too." His lower lip trembled. "They called me a jinx. They said I won't live past eight years old."

Her heart shattered into a million pieces. She quickly gathered him into her arms, holding him tight.

"You are the sweetest, most amazing boy in the entire world," she whispered fiercely into his hair. "If they can't see that, then that is their loss. Their problem. Not yours. You are going to get better. I promise you. God loves you just as much as I do. He will let you live to be a hundred. We don't listen to cruel words from others, understand?"

He looked up at her, his big eyes wide and hopeful. "Really? I'm not a jinx?"

"Of course not," she assured him, stroking his cheek. "You are the best. Promise me you will never be sad because of what other people say. You live for yourself. Remember that. One day, when you are strong and powerful, they will regret ever saying those things."

"Yes, Mommy! I promise!" he chirped, his usual cheerfulness flooding back. A bright, adorable smile spread across his face.

"That's my boy. Now, finish your homework. You can write all about Daddy and Mommy. For the part about Grandpa and Grandma... just write a little. It's okay."

"Okay, Mom!" He wriggled out of her embrace and scampered back to the table, pencil in hand.

Her heart ached as she watched him.

He was only five. Yet he was diligently tackling fourth-grade work during his summer break. She had assumed all Blackwood children were born with silver spoons.

She never imagined Christopher, a Blackwood, would lack a mother's love. Let alone face such cruelty from his own grandparents.

The more she thought about it, the heavier her heart felt.

'It must be because of his condition. I need to talk to Nathaniel.'

"Mommy is going to get some fruit for you. You keep working, alright?" she said, heading for the stairs.

She found Nathaniel in his study. He was focused intently on his work at the large desk. His expression was serious, his gaze sharp.

She paused, momentarily captivated. It was the first time she'd seen him emanate such a solemn, powerful aura. His beauty wasn't just in his features, but in the intense light of his concentration.

He looked up as she knocked gently on the doorframe. "Come in," he invited.
###Chapter 173

Isabella stepped into the study and settled onto the plush leather sofa.

She met Nathaniel’s gaze directly. “I want to talk about Oliver’s grandparents,” she began. “He’s mentioned things to me. It sounds like they don’t approve of him. I believe his seizures might be connected to that emotional distress. To truly help him heal, we need to address the pain he’s carrying inside.”

Logically, a child conceived through IVF surrogacy would still be a Blackwood. He would still be their grandchild. There was no reason for such deep-seated animosity.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened instantly. The world believed Oliver was a surrogate child, but he knew the painful truth.

Five years ago, under the influence of a powerful drug, he had spent a night with a mysterious girl at The Grand Monarch hotel.

High society deemed the incident a sordid scandal. His grandparents and parents were utterly disgusted by the unknown woman he had been with.

He could still vividly recall her: fragile, sweet, and trembling like a frightened dove. He had been completely captivated.

Afterward, he had searched for her relentlessly. He turned the city upside down. His efforts yielded nothing.

He found Oliver later that same year, during a bitterly cold winter. The infant was in a morgue, his breathing faint. Nathaniel’s heart shattered. He brought the baby home. Oliver clung to life inside an incubator.

A subsequent blood transfusion confirmed the shocking truth: Oliver was his biological son.

Nathaniel was certain the girl from that night was the mother. She was the only one. The discovery tore the Blackwood family apart.

They viewed the sickly child as a burden. They believed his mother was a curse. Some were convinced it was a calculated scheme to exploit the Blackwood fortune.

The Blackwoods were pillars of aristocracy. Oliver’s existence was seen as a stain on their legacy. The family pressured Nathaniel relentlessly to send the boy away, overseas.

He fought them all, defiant. He kept Oliver by his side. This was the reason he now avoided the family estate entirely.

Isabella’s question left him speechless. Should he confess that Oliver was his biological son? Should he reveal the truth about that night and the other woman?

Would she be able to accept his past? The fear that the truth would make her despise him was paralyzing.

“It’s nothing serious,” he finally said, his voice tight. He took a slow sip of coffee. “They are just traditional. They disapprove of the concept of IVF. Oliver has had seizures since infancy. They see it as a bad omen.”

‘Is that all?’ Isabella frowned, unconvinced. “Mr. Blackwood, you must resolve this. It’s difficult enough for a child to grow up without a mother. Having his own family reject him is too heavy a burden for a young heart. A child needs a real family, not just a father.”

Nathaniel nodded slowly. “You’re right, Ms. Montgomery. I will speak with them. I will try to change their minds.”

Isabella trusted he would keep his word. Satisfied, she left to prepare a fruit platter for Oliver.

The moment the door closed, Nathaniel’s composure broke.

A wave of anxiety crashed over him.

‘What if Isabella discovers my past? Will she still look at me the same way?’

‘What if she finds out about that girl? What will I do?’

Tormented by doubt, he picked up his phone. His fingers moved quickly, sending a message on WhatsApp.
###Chapter 174

Nathaniel's message flashed on Dominic's screen. (Locate that girl. Immediately.)

He needed to identify her. Compensation had to be arranged. A guarantee she would vanish from his world forever.

His, and Isabella’s.

That woman might try to win his family over. She could charm them into accepting Oliver quickly. Earn their affection and trust.

He refused to entertain the thought. Nathaniel opened his social media and uploaded several photos of Christopher.

“Whoa! What’s this, Bro? Your feed’s been dead for years. Now this?” Sebastian’s surprised text popped up.

Notifications flooded in instantly.

(Oliver is so big now! Adorable!) Aunt Beatrice commented.

(He’s Nathaniel’s miniature copy. Sigh. If only his mother was Vivienne.) Mrs. Blackwood wrote.

[Stop shaming the family with these photos!] Mr. Blackwood’s comment was sharp.

Nathaniel muted the alerts. He returned to his work.

Morning arrived swiftly.

Isabella rose from bed. Christopher still slept soundly.

Today’s bridal shoot was at Greenwish Park. After that, she planned to visit The Ritz-Carlton. The investigation into that night five years ago awaited.

She kissed Oliver’s soft cheek. Slipped out quietly. Nathaniel followed her.

“Look after Momo. Tell him I’ll be back tomorrow afternoon,” Isabella said.

“I’ll have Dominic drive you.” Nathaniel reached for his phone.

“It’s fine. Just a short shoot. I’ll take my Kawasaki.” She moved toward the door.

He walked her to the garage. “Drive safely,” he advised before she left.

“Don’t worry. I handle roads well. Take good care of Momo.” She secured her helmet. Pulled away from the estate.

She glanced in her rearview mirror. A small smile touched her lips.

Having someone see her off felt strangely nice.

“Assign covert protection for her. I’ll handle The Grand Monarch investigation alone today,” Nathaniel instructed Dominic after she disappeared from view.

“Understood, Sir.”

Greenwish Park sat isolated. Prehistoric-themed. Decorated with pavilions and bridges over a serene river. Normally, entry required a fee. Today, Amor Group booked the entire park for the shoot.

The company also reserved a suite at The Ritz-Carlton for Isabella’s team.

She paused in the hotel’s grand lobby. Her mind drifted back five years.

Those memories were a nightmare. This was the place. Where she lost her innocence. That night forced a complete transformation. A shy girl forced out of her shell.

She was no hypocrite. But society held no tolerance for such things.

A raped woman. An abortion… People would scorn her. This stain would follow her forever. A permanent weakness.

Suddenly…

“You’re here, Isabella.” A gentle voice broke her reverie.
###Chapter 175

Isabella Montgomery turned her head and saw Seraphina Delacroix, the founder and lead designer of Amor Group.

At twenty-five, Seraphina Delacroix came from one of Shelburne's most influential families. She had launched her bridal empire at just sixteen. In only nine years, she built Amor Group into the premier bridal brand worldwide.

Yet, she was not the star of the Delacroix family. That title belonged to the eldest daughter, Vivienne.

Vivienne was fluent in multiple languages, skilled in arts, finance, investment, and even crafts like stitching and pottery. She was the golden child, the prodigy.

Rumors also claimed Vivienne was the Blackwood family's chosen daughter-in-law, a perfect match for Nathaniel.

Isabella felt a sharp pang of envy at the thought.

"The makeup artist is waiting for you in the dressing room," said Seraphina, her tone both humble and aristocratic.

"Alright." Isabella followed the assistant to a room on the first floor.

The vanity was lined with an array of luxury cosmetics. The wardrobe overflowed with exquisite bridal gowns.

This room felt different from the one five years ago. That difference might hold the key to uncovering the truth.

"Could you tell me the theme for today's shoot?" Isabella asked.

"Today is mainly for fitting and styling," the assistant explained. "We're doing a relaxed, sunset-themed session. Tomorrow, we'll capture the sunrise shots. Then we're done."

"Understood," Isabella replied as the team began preparing her.

"Immerse yourself in Ms. Montgomery's unique aura. Enhance her natural charisma. She will embody our designs perfectly," Seraphina instructed the stylist.

She turned back to Isabella. "Today's concept is a departure from Guci's usual bold style. We're focusing on elegance and refinement. Please be prepared so we don't waste anyone's time."

Seraphina's words were polite but carried a condescending edge. Privately, she disliked Isabella. She viewed her as arrogant and ill-suited for the gown's delicate theme.

However, Isabella was the hottest celebrity right now. Her involvement would generate massive buzz. Seraphina had to concede.

"Don't worry. I only accept projects I know I can master. I'm more concerned this collaboration might tarnish my reputation," Isabella retorted coolly.

Seraphina's expression tightened. She couldn't fathom how someone so insolent could portray elegance.

Yet, once work began, Isabella transformed. Her professionalism was impeccable.

Between shots, she relaxed on a rocking chair, fanning herself casually. Her face was exquisitely delicate. Her long, silky hair cascaded past her waist like a waterfall. Her features were a perfect labyrinth, captivating and mesmerizing. Strolling through the set, her beauty was so profound it felt almost surreal.

She possessed a reserved quality that contrasted sharply with Victoria's flamboyance.

Isabella was genuine, unlike other pretentious celebrities. Cold as ice yet sweet as honey. Her maturity defied her age. An ethereal presence that commanded every gaze.

The shoot, scheduled for four hours, wrapped in just two. Pleased with the smooth progress, Seraphina left the set.

Isabella lounged lazily under a shade, awaiting the evening session.

"Ms. Montgomery, don't you usually bring a personal assistant?" someone asked curiously.

Reclining in the rocking chair, she responded, "Why would I need one?"
###Chapter 176

I'm here to massage and fan you.
I can also run any errands you need.

Is a photoshoot really that exhausting?
I remember many professions being far more demanding.
Yet I've never seen farmers or researchers getting massages during work hours.

The crowd fell silent under her blunt observation.
She continued without hesitation.
Hiring multiple assistants might look impressive, but it's just vanity.
This toxic trend in our industry needs to change.

Her words struck a chord with everyone present.
Having personal assistants had always been standard practice for celebrities.
Some even brought private makeup artists despite provided staff.
Her perspective made them reconsider other grueling professions—farmers laboring under harsh sun, scientists pulling all-nighters, architects sacrificing sleep.

You're absolutely right, Ms. Montgomery.
You're the most grounded artist I've ever met.

Let me get you a drink!
This isn't blind admiration—it's genuine respect!

Just say the word if you need anything.
I'll help however I can!

They surrounded Isabella, their praises heartfelt and sincere.

I was supposed to be the ambassador.
Victoria seethed from her vantage point at Greenwish Park.
She crushed the cake box in her hands, knuckles whitening.
Isabella stole everything from me.
She shouldn't even be here!

Penelope flinched at her outburst.
Ms. Kensington, we brought this for the apology video...
Her voice trembled as she offered the dessert.

The reminder intensified Victoria's fury.
Her knees still ached from yesterday's prolonged kneeling.
She had faked tears, begged forgiveness, even feigned exhaustion—all to salvage her reputation.
Every performance was calculated to maintain her status.

Get another one. Now.
Victoria's tone left no room for argument.

But the nearest patisserie is seven kilometers—
A glacial stare cut her off.
Penelope wiped cold sweat from her brow and scrambled from the car.

Veronica, close the door!
Victoria's command echoed in the empty vehicle.
Then she remembered.
Veronica was gone.

The memory surfaced abruptly—her eighth birthday, when Veronica revealed she wasn't a biological Montgomery.
The truth had devastated her initially.
But Veronica's timing was strategic; early exposure prevented greater scandal later.
Without that warning, she might have been disinherited without a cent.
Everything she built would have crumbled.

Over the years, Veronica helped her manipulate Isabella, securing her place in the family.
Veronica understood her like a mother—patient with her temper, accepting her flaws.
With Veronica, she could drop the perfect facade and simply exist.

Now imprisoned, Veronica was beyond reach.
Victoria was truly alone, with no one to trust or confide in.

Isabella. This is all your fault.
Her venomous gaze locked onto the distant figure.
The burning hatred crystallized into a single focus.
She would destroy Isabella Montgomery, no matter the cost.
###Chapter 177

The afternoon sun made her eyelids heavy.

Isabella decided to rest after the film crew departed.

She had checked into The Ritz-Carlton with a purpose—to uncover the truth about that night.

Five years ago, her plan was straightforward.

She intended to have Victoria imprisoned for poisoning them, letting the authorities handle it.

She believed Victoria would confess to avoid public disgrace and total ruin.

But things spiraled out of control.

Gabriella’s unexpected loyalty shocked her.

Gabriella took full responsibility for Victoria’s crimes.

Now, Victoria would never confess to save Gabriella.

Isabella knew only one man could prove her innocence.

Victoria must have hidden him well.

She needed to find him through her own means.

Someone at this hotel five years ago must know his identity.

“Sister…” a soft voice called from behind.

Isabella turned to see Victoria in a white dress.

She ignored her, but Victoria approached anyway.

“It was all my fault back then,” Victoria said, feigning remorse. “I must have been insane. Or truly evil. I’m here to apologize. Look, I brought your childhood favorite—matcha cake.”

A cold shiver ran down Isabella’s spine.

Her favorite had always been strawberry cake.

Not matcha.

When they were children, their birthdays featured two cakes.

One was always matcha-flavored.

Made from expensive, finely ground green tea leaves.

Each slice cost a fortune.

Victoria, the wolf in sheep’s clothing, always shared it with Isabella.

She did it to earn praise for her generosity.

If Isabella refused, she was called ungrateful.

As the adopted daughter, she had no voice.

She learned to accept it.

So everyone believed she loved matcha cake.

Victoria had stolen her voice since childhood.

“You think this cake makes up for everything?” Isabella’s voice was icy.

“It’s from Yukkuri. Their matcha cake is famous. Please, try it…” Victoria said sweetly.

Isabella laughed, a sharp, mocking sound.

“Really, Victoria? You apologize with a cake? Is that all you’re worth?”

Victoria stiffened, caught off guard.

She wanted to scream, but she held back.

She glanced subtly toward Penelope, who was hiding nearby.

“I’m sorry, sister. I just want to make things right. It’s not about the price. Please accept my apology. You must be tired. Here, have some.”

As she offered the cake, Victoria tried to flick pollen from her hand onto Isabella.
###Chapter 178

Tulip pollen.

The memory hit her like a physical blow.

Five years ago, she had woken in a room overflowing with tulips. That first spring, they had seemed beautiful. She had believed they represented life's greatest joys. Winter revealed the cruel truth, on the very day her engagement was supposed to happen.

Since that moment, tulips became her enemy. Victoria knew this.

‘She planned this deliberately. She wants to sabotage the photoshoot.’ Isabella’s mind raced, connecting the dots.

Thud! The cake crashed onto the floor. Victoria stumbled backward, feigning a clumsy dodge.

Her eyes locked with Isabella’s, gleaming with malicious triumph. “Ah!”

A sharp shriek tore from her lips as she tumbled into the pond.

“Help! Somebody help me!” Victoria flailed dramatically in the water. Instantly, every eye turned toward the commotion.

“Isabella, this is too far!” Eleanor’s voice cut through the chaos.

“Someone save Victoria! Now!” Eleanor screamed, her panic seeming genuine.

People scrambled. Phones were pulled out. Others searched for something, anything, to use as a rescue tool. Pure bedlam erupted.

Sunlight danced on the water’s surface, cruelly highlighting Victoria’s feigned vulnerability.

A lifeguard finally pulled her out. She shivered violently. Her eyes were puffy and red-rimmed. Her face was a mask of pale fragility.

She gasped, each breath a performance of suffering. “Mother, please… don’t blame Isabella. This is my fault. I understand if she can’t accept my apology. If she hates me. I don’t blame her.”

Slow, calculated tears traced paths down her cheeks. “I’m sorry, Isabella. I came to apologize sincerely. If it’s not enough, do what you must. Push me in again. I just want your forgiveness.” Her voice was a masterpiece of remorse.

Isabella’s hands clenched the railing, her knuckles white. She forced herself to stay still, to not give them the reaction they wanted.

She saw the entire scheme clearly—the pollen, the fall, the drowning act.

She knew defending herself now was pointless. No one would listen.

Isabella’s silence only fueled Eleanor’s rage. “You promised me yesterday you would be kind! Look what you’ve done! I know she was wrong, but she knelt all night for you! She fainted! Her first thought was to apologize again! How can you be so cruel to your own sister!” she shouted, her words lashing out.

The fragile bond formed yesterday shattered into a million pieces.
###Chapter 179

Isabella felt the last thread of connection snap.

Eleanor’s trust was gone.

“You won’t even let me explain? You’ve already decided it was me?” Her voice trembled with raw hurt.

The memory of their recent understanding hung between them, fragile and already broken.

“Explain what, Isabella? I saw everything. What could you possibly say?” Eleanor’s words were sharp, laced with disappointment.

“You think I’d be that stupid? If I wanted revenge, I have enough evidence to ruin her forever. Pushing her into a pool? That’s beneath me.” Isabella’s laugh was cold and hollow.

Her gaze swept over Victoria, icy and furious.

She turned away without another word.

She walked back to the shaded bench, alone once more.

Whispers started among the crew.

“Isabella wouldn’t do that. It doesn’t make sense.”

“What would she gain? It’s too messy. Too public.”

“Don’t be naive. People hide their true selves well.”

“Remember how Victoria defended her before? It feels like an act now.”

Opinions were shifting. Victoria’s innocent image was cracking.

People were seeing the calculated moves behind her tears.

Yesterday’s conversation had changed everything for Eleanor.

Isabella had shown mercy. She held power but didn’t use it to destroy Victoria.

That act of restraint now made Eleanor doubt her own eyes.

Seeing Isabella walk away, alone and accused, twisted something in Eleanor’s chest.

She had chosen to believe the spectacle over the person.

Guilt began to prickle at her.

She turned to Victoria. “Let’s go. You need dry clothes.”

“You believe her, don’t you? Mommy, I can’t even swim! Why would I do this to myself?” Victoria’s voice was a desperate, pitiful whine.

“I know you wouldn’t, darling. But I don’t think she meant to push you. If she truly wanted to hurt you, she had far worse options.” Eleanor’s tone was firm, final.

She took Victoria’s arm and led her away quickly, avoiding the growing crowd.

Victoria seethed internally.

Eleanor’s faith in her was crumbling.

Isabella was winning too easily.

Rage burned hot and vicious under her skin.

At home, Penelope helped her change.

“The video! Show me the video now!” Victoria demanded the moment Eleanor was out of sight.

Penelope flinched, handing over the phone with shaking hands.

The footage showed Isabella brushing cake off Victoria’s dress.

The crucial moment—the push—was completely missing from the angle.

Her perfect plan was ruined.

She needed that clip for social media. For Eleanor.

Nothing.

“You useless idiot!” she screamed. “These angles are worthless! Get out! Get out of my sight!”

Blind fury took over.

She hurled a vase against the wall. It shattered into a thousand pieces.

She grabbed a lamp and threw it next.

The room became a target for her uncontrollable rage.

Penelope shrank into the corner, terrified and small.
###Chapter 180

Shards of glass sliced deep into her palms.
Crimson blood immediately welled from the lacerations.
A searing, fiery pain shot up her arm, forcing tears to her eyes.

Victoria watched the whimpering with pure annoyance.
Every bit of her planning had been utterly wasted.
If Gabriella were here, this disaster would never have happened.

She could no longer depend on Gabriella.
Her assistant was nothing but a liability now.

‘I’ll handle this myself.’

A cruel, calculating smile twisted her lips as she considered Isabella’s vulnerabilities.

[Proceed with the plan at The Ritz-Carlton.]

She sent the text, abandoning the sobbing Gabriella without a second glance, and strode toward her wardrobe.

Across the room, Gabriella trembled, cradling her injured hand.
She tried to hide the bleeding wound, wincing from the throbbing agony.
Hobbling away, she nearly collided with Isabella, who had just returned home.

‘Isn’t that Victoria’s assistant? Why is she crying?’
Isabella’s curiosity was piqued, but she asked no questions.
She simply minded her own business and continued on her way.

After Eleanor had finally left Rosewood Manor, Isabella allowed the mask of lonely vulnerability to drop from her face.

‘Hmph. You think you’re the only one who can act?’ she thought, a smirk playing on her lips. ‘I might not be as disgustingly theatrical as you, but a little performance is hardly a challenge.’

She had walked away and remained silent entirely on purpose.
It was a calculated move to garner sympathy from Eleanor.
And it had worked perfectly.
With this, Victoria would find it much harder to manipulate her in the future.

She had returned to the hotel after concluding her sunset photoshoot.

“Ms. Montgomery, your room for the evening,” an assistant said, handing her the keycard for Room 909.

Isabella’s face darkened the moment she took the card.
This was the very room she had stayed in five years ago.

What an unbelievable coincidence.

The assistant noticed her sudden shift in demeanor. “Is everything alright, Ms. Montgomery?”

“It’s nothing. Everyone, get some rest,” she dismissed them coolly and headed for her room.

Walking down the corridor, each step made her heart pound harder against her ribs.
Even though five years had passed, the memories held a visceral power.
She had believed herself brave and mature enough to face anything, including this.
She was wrong.
A deep-seated insecurity and anxiety took hold whenever she was near this place.

To quell the rising panic, she tried a different thought. ‘Maybe… maybe I can find a clue about what happened that night here.’

She drew a slow, steadying breath and pushed the door open.

The Presidential Suite was immaculate, radiating an aura of opulent luxury.
Bottles of fine wine were arranged in the living area.
The bedroom was adorned with lavish European-style linens.
Everything looked exactly as it had five years ago, yet it felt completely different.

If only she could turn back time.
She would give anything to see that man’s face clearly.

Creak!
The door swung open.
A middle-aged woman entered, pushing a food and beverage cart.

“Good evening. A complimentary meal from the production team,” the woman announced politely.

Isabella snapped back to the present.
Her eyes widened, a spark of desperate hope igniting within her.

Recognition was instant.
Her entire body went still as her mind raced.

It was her.
The same woman who had delivered the food to them five years ago.
She might know something.
She had to know something about that night.
###Chapter 181

Isabella Montgomery suppressed her rising anticipation as the woman entered.

She gestured toward the empty chair opposite her. “Please, join me.”

Beatrice Holloway pushed the dining cart forward, carefully arranging each dish on the table.

“How long have you been employed here?” Isabella began coolly. “There’s something familiar about you.”

“Oh, indeed! Over a decade now. Please don’t mistake my age for incompetence. I’m far more reliable than some of these flighty young girls, no matter how pleasant they seem,” Beatrice replied, her smile radiating pride.

Isabella noted the woman’s genuine and amiable demeanor. She decided to play along. “Reliability is a quality I value greatly. Would you sit with me? There’s something I wish to discuss.”

“Oh? Of course, ask anything,” Beatrice answered, visibly flattered and pleased by the attention.

She knew Isabella was the renowned Diamond Boss, a superstar here for a major campaign. Offending such a powerful figure was unthinkable.

“My questions concern an event from five years ago,” Isabella stated, getting straight to the point. “Please, sit. I need you to think back carefully.”

Five years ago?

A flicker of anxiety crossed Beatrice’s face as a specific memory surfaced.

This very room… five years ago… Wasn't Isabella present then?

The thought that the plain, awkward girl from back then had transformed into this stunning woman was staggering. She cautiously took a seat. “What is it you wish to know, Ms. Montgomery?”

“Valentine’s Day. Five years ago. Who was in this suite?”

This was a presidential suite. Its guests were always notable, leaving impressions. Yet, Beatrice merely chuckled nervously. “My dear, I’m an old woman. How could I possibly recall details from so long ago?”

“Valentine’s Day is memorable. Events of that day would surely stand out, even more than usual,” Isabella countered, her voice steady. “Furthermore, you were responsible for the breakfast service to this room that morning. You accidentally broke a vase in the hallway. The compensation was five thousand dollars. A significant sum for you. I’m certain you remember that day perfectly.”

Isabella spoke with methodical precision. She retrieved a bank card from her bag. “This holds half a million dollars,” she stated. “It’s yours. All I require is accurate information.”

Beatrice’s eyes widened. She had never seen so much money. It represented over a decade of her wages!

Isabella’s intense gaze locked onto her. “Think carefully, Beatrice. Five years ago. Who entered and left this room?”

Her voice was low, persuasive. She slid the card across the table.

The temptation was overwhelming. Beatrice finally capitulated. She wet her lips nervously before speaking. “Ms. Victoria Kensington and Mr. Alexander Whitmore… they brought you in. I was delivering a supper tray next door. I saw them assisting you inside. It struck me as odd. Usually, it was couples. A trio of two women and one man was… unusual.”

Isabella’s brow furrowed. Victoria and Alexander? Five years ago, she had overheard their conversation. Had Victoria masterminded the entire incident?

This story felt wrong. Beatrice was lying.

A cold chuckle escaped Isabella’s lips. “The half-million is for the truth. Do not attempt to deceive me.”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Beatrice blurted. “Even without the money, I wouldn’t risk misleading someone of your stature. I remember them helping you. I remember the childish black dress you wore… Ahem. Forgive my bluntness, but it was… a peculiar, funky-looking garment. It was rather memorable, you see.”

Isabella’s frown deepened. Beatrice’s tone carried a ring of truth. The description of the dress was painfully accurate. She had been a laughingstock that night.

It seemed Beatrice wasn't lying.
###Chapter 182

How did Alexander and Victoria manage to bring her to this hotel?

Alexander must have been involved with Victoria. But if he was present that night, how could he have allowed Victoria to make such a critical mistake?

Beatrice noticed Isabella's skeptical expression and quickly added, "Let me call the floor manager for you. Lawrence Chamberlain has supervised this level for years. He knows every person who has entered or exited these rooms.

"I only handle food deliveries, but Manager Chamberlain provides additional guest services. He would have more detailed information about that incident. You can verify everything with him to see if I'm telling the truth."

"Fine. If your story checks out, you'll get your money." Isabella swiftly put away her bank card.

"Excellent. But please don't mention our conversation to Manager Chamberlain. He's very strict, and I could lose my job if he finds out." Beatrice stood up to leave the room.

Isabella gave a slight nod.

As Beatrice exited, she reminded her, "Remember to open the door for him when he arrives."

The door clicked shut, leaving the room in complete silence.

Isabella stared at the dishes on the table but felt no appetite.

She wondered if Manager Chamberlain would have any real information. Would his account match Beatrice's? While the waitress seemed truthful, something about the story felt off.

What crucial detail was she missing?

Meanwhile, at The Grand Monarch Hotel...

The luxury establishment stood a kilometer away from Phoenix Hotel, its presidential suite occupying the entire top floor.

Nathaniel stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, his gaze fixed on the lavish bed behind him. Five years ago—on Valentine's Day—he had taken a girl's innocence on that very bed. Who was she? Why had she vanished without leaving a single trace?

Sebastian was usually highly competent. Why couldn't he solve this mystery?

At that moment, Sebastian entered with Oliver.

"Brother, I've gathered all staff members who were working here five years ago."

As he spoke, about ten employees filed into the room. They stood with their heads bowed, visibly trembling with fear.

Nathaniel turned and scrutinized the group. His voice remained ice-cold. "Who was the girl in this room five years ago on Valentine's Day?"

"Mr. Blackwood, we truly don't know."

They all gave identical answers, their eyes fixed on the floor in terror.

Nathaniel's tone turned dangerous. "Think very carefully before you answer. I have a hungry alligator waiting in my pond at home."

The staff turned pale at his words. Their bodies shook with uncontrolled fear.

Rumors about Nathaniel Blackwood's cruelty were well-known. That he kept an alligator as a pet was apparently true.

What if he decided to feed them to his pet?

One female staff member suddenly spoke up. "Mr. Blackwood, I don't know who that girl was... but he might know."

She pointed at the man standing beside her. Nathaniel's sharp gaze immediately focused on the indicated man.
###Chapter 183

The man in the tailored suit stood frozen. Gregory Whitmore, now manager of The Grand Monarch Hotel, felt his blood run cold.

His knees nearly buckled when the server singled him out. "That's absurd!" he blurted. "I was just a cleaner back then. How would I remember who accessed the presidential suite?"

"Exactly why you'd know." The server's voice remained steady. "Valentine's Day, five years ago. My shift ended at 5 AM, but my boyfriend wanted to celebrate. I swapped with you."

She took a step closer. "You covered the night watch. You monitored that entire floor. You saw everything."

Gregory's face lost all color. His hands trembled visibly.

Nathaniel Blackwood's gaze sharpened, darkening with intensity. "Seems you'd prefer to meet my alligator. Sebastian, bring him."

Sebastian moved forward, his expression grim.

Terror seized Gregory. He dropped to the floor with a heavy thud. "Mr. Blackwood, have mercy! I don't know the woman! I never saw her, I swear!"

"Then why hide working the night shift? Why the guilt?" Sebastian pressed.

As a doctor, Sebastian read people's eyes with precision.

Cornered, Gregory broke into a cold sweat. He stammered, "I... I was on duty that night. I... administered medication to Mr. Blackwood."

He trembled violently, addressing Nathaniel. "Victoria Kensington made me do it. She threatened me. Said she'd ruin my career if I refused. I slipped the drug into your drink."

"Mr. Blackwood, I beg your forgiveness! My wife is pregnant, nearly due. They need me! Please spare my life!"

Nathaniel glanced at Sebastian, who studied Gregory carefully. After a moment, Sebastian nodded. "He's truthful, brother."

So, five years ago, Victoria drugged him—not the mystery woman.

Nathaniel's voice turned icy. "If Victoria drugged me, why did another woman enter my room?"

"I don't know! After dosing your drink, I panicked. I hid on the stairwell. Victoria ordered everyone to stay away. I saw nothing else," Gregory confessed, his voice shaking.

Nathaniel's expression hardened. Only Victoria held the answers now.

He rose, pausing beside the kneeling man. "Your wife needs you. Go home to her." The dismissal was clear.

Gregory collapsed in relief. He'd been fired, but he was alive. That was mercy enough.

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood!" He bowed deeply, gratitude overwhelming him.

The three Blackwood men entered the elevator, descending in silence.
###Chapter 184

The entire surveillance system conveniently malfunctioned that exact night.

Not a single clue remained.

"What an unfortunate coincidence," remarked Sebastian.

"Only Victoria holds the answers now. Do you wish to confront her yourself, Nathaniel?"

"No. Handle this alone. Extract the truth from her," Nathaniel replied coldly.

Sebastian frowned deeply. "Then where are you going?"

They stepped out of the elevator into The Grand Monarch's opulent lobby.

Nathaniel's intense gaze was already fixed on the Phoenix Hotel across the boulevard.

"I have another pressing matter. Take Christopher with you."

"No! I want to stay with Daddy! Daddy promised we'd see Mommy!" Oliver instantly clung to Nathaniel's leg.

Nathaniel glanced down at the small boy attached to him. He gently patted his son's head.

"Be good. Your mother and I require some privacy. Do you truly wish to interrupt us?"

Oliver pouted, his expression stubborn. "I'll be quiet! I can sleep in the next room!"

"Go with Uncle Sebastian," Nathaniel persuaded softly. "I must locate your birth mother. I need to provide her compensation. Only then can your Mommy stay with us forever."

Oliver's face instantly brightened. That made perfect sense. If his birth mother returned, Mommy would have to leave. He couldn't let that happen. He adored her too much.

"Okay! I'll go!" He immediately grabbed Sebastian's hand and practically dragged him away.

Nathaniel slid into his sleek car and drove straight to the Phoenix Hotel.

While technically a five-star establishment, the Phoenix Hotel occupied the lower tier of luxury. The truly elite would never choose to stay there. Nathaniel himself had never set foot inside.

For Isabella, he was breaking that precedent.

In Room 909 of the Phoenix Hotel…

Isabella had managed a few forced bites of food. She waited with simmering impatience.

The doorbell finally chimed.

She peered through the peephole. A man in a sharp suit and polished leather shoes stood there. A brass name tag on his chest read 'Lawrence Chamberlain, Floor Manager'.

This was the manager Beatrice had mentioned.

Isabella opened the door and gestured for him to enter.

Manager Chamberlain stepped inside and offered a slight, respectful bow. "Ms. Montgomery. You requested my presence?"

"Yes. Please, have a seat."

Once he was inside, Isabella closed the door and took a seat opposite him on the sofa. She wasted no time. "I understand you are the manager for this floor. I'm told all comings and goings are meticulously registered."

"Our hotel policy mandates full registration for all visitors. Guest security and comfort are our utmost priority," Manager Chamberlain stated professionally. "We also provide a welcome gift for all our distinguished guests. Today's offering is a commemorative porcelain cup." He presented a beautifully wrapped box to her. "This system allows us to prepare personalized gifts from our inventory. It also requires us to record the primary guest's name and all accompanying visitors. We strive for complete customer satisfaction."

Isabella accepted the box. A vague memory surfaced. She had been offered a small gift upon leaving this very room five years ago.

Alexander had scoffed at the hotel's "tacky" offering. He'd sent her out to purchase something more suitable instead. At the time, she mistook his action for generosity. Now, she saw the truth. He hadn't wanted a single piece of evidence linking them to this place.

Every item could have been used against Victoria.

She pushed the bitter thought aside and focused on Manager Chamberlain. "Then, do you recall how many people were registered to this room over the past five years?"

Manager Chamberlain's polite smile faltered. His expression grew tense. "Well…"
###Chapter 185

Isabella Montgomery suspected the manager required monetary incentive. She made her offer clear.

“I’ll compensate you generously for any useful information.”

Lawrence Chamberlain remained unmoved. His demeanor showed no trace of the greed she expected.

“That won’t be necessary,” he declined politely. “I’m simply attempting to reconstruct the events accurately.”

He paused thoughtfully before studying her intently. “Ms. Montgomery, are you feeling unwell?”

Isabella frowned. Why would he ask that?

Suddenly, a wave of dizziness washed over her. Her body temperature spiked alarmingly. Coherent thought became increasingly difficult.

Damn it! He had drugged her!

“Are you insane?!”

Summoning her fading strength, Isabella grabbed a nearby vase. She attempted to hurl it at him with force.

But her limbs betrayed her. They turned to lead. She collapsed onto the floor, utterly limp. The vase crashed beside her, shattering loudly.

The drug was potent. Fast-acting.

Lawrence Chamberlain stood up. He adjusted his bow tie meticulously. All warmth vanished from his face, replaced by a sinister, predatory smirk.

“You’re so eager to dig up the past, Ms. Montgomery. Was that man five years ago really that good? Don’t worry. I’m quite skilled myself. I’ll ensure you enjoy tonight thoroughly.”

He began unbuttoning his shirt deliberately. He moved toward her and knelt on the floor beside her prone form.

Isabella’s voice was a weak whisper. “You…you’ll regret this…This is a crime…I will destroy you…”

“A crime?” He chuckled darkly. “You checked into this hotel. You inquired about our…special services from Beatrice. You specifically requested me after hearing about my…talents. The security footage will show you inviting me into your suite yourself!”

He leaned closer, his breath hot against her ear. “Wealthy women like you always crave young men like me. The narrative will be easily believed. No one will question my story.”

His evil smile widened. His hands grabbed the fabric of her blouse.

Isabella’s mind raced. It was all a trap! Even Beatrice Holloway was in on it!

She had asked for him. She had opened the door for him. The realization filled her with cold, paralyzing dread.

A sharp tearing sound filled the room. Her buttons popped, scattering across the floor.

Her jeans and button-down top were violated. Her flawless figure was exposed to his lecherous gaze.

Isabella clenched her fists. She willed her body to fight, to move. But her muscles refused to obey. She was completely conscious yet utterly powerless. Nausea churned in her stomach.

Lawrence Chamberlain pressed his weight onto her. He devoured her with a ravenous look. “I’ve had many women. But never one as wealthy and exquisite as you. You are utterly intoxicating, Isabella.”

He lowered his head. His lips sought the sensitive skin of her neck.

Revulsion surged through her. She tried to push him away. Her efforts were pathetically weak. Her feeble struggles only seemed to amuse him.

The drug held her captive. It twisted her resistance into something playful. Something inviting.

No. This couldn’t happen. Not again. She had to fight it. She had to…

Her consciousness blurred further. Unwanted, chaotic thoughts invaded her mind. Was history repeating itself? Was she doomed to relive the nightmare of five years ago?

Lawrence Chamberlain unbuckled his belt. His focus was singular. He stared at her irresistible beauty. He was consumed by the desire to claim her.

As he moved to remove his trousers, the door exploded inward.

A tall, formidable figure filled the doorway.

Isabella’s vision swam. She couldn’t identify the man. But a profound sense of relief flooded her. A hero. Her savior had arrived.

The feeling was irrational yet undeniable. Hope ignited within her.

Nathaniel Blackwood burst into the room. His eyes immediately found Isabella pinned beneath another man. She looked up at him, dazed and helpless.

A violent tremor of rage shook him. How dare anyone assault a woman in such a vulnerable state?!

He charged forward without hesitation. His fist connected with Lawrence Chamberlain’s face with brutal force.
###Chapter 186

“Ah!”

Nathaniel’s fist slammed into Lawrence’s face, sending him stumbling backward.

His pants slid down his waist as he hit the floor.

Lawrence scrambled to his feet, ready to fight back.

But he froze the moment he recognized the man before him.

It was Mr. Blackwood. The powerful Mr. Blackwood from Westchester was here at The Ritz-Carlton!

No, he couldn’t panic now. Panicking would ruin everything.

He quickly tried to explain. “Mr. Blackwood, please listen to me. Ms. Montgomery was the one who wanted this. Everyone here can testify. She invited me to her room and asked me to sleep with her—ahh!”

Another punch cut off his words.

Nathaniel’s voice was cold and dangerous. “She wouldn’t even have me. Why would she want someone like you? How dare you accuse my woman?” He laughed bitterly before striking again.

Lawrence was beaten mercilessly. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, and one of his teeth was knocked out.

Just then, Isabella let out a weak groan.

Nathaniel threw Lawrence out the door. “Dominic, lock him up. Isabella will deal with him tomorrow.”

“Yes, sir.” Dominic grabbed Lawrence by the collar and dragged him away.

This fool had dared to lay hands on the chairman’s future wife. He was asking for death.

Nathaniel shut the door and rushed back to the sofa.

Isabella’s face was flushed, her clothes torn. She seemed barely conscious but aware enough to feel exposed.

Nathaniel quickly removed his jacket and draped it over her.

Dizzy and burning up, Isabella felt a cool presence beside her. She instinctively reached for it, wrapping her arms around Nathaniel’s waist.

Nathaniel stiffened, his heart racing. He had never felt this way about any woman before. Aside from the girl from five years ago, Isabella was the only one who stirred such emotions in him.

“Hold on,” he whispered gently. “Sebastian is bringing the medicine.”

“I feel… awful…” Isabella murmured, her voice weak. She was losing control, her body craving relief from the intense heat.

The drug was strong. The only thing that soothed her was the coolness of Nathaniel’s body.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. He turned to her and asked firmly, “Isabella, do you know who I am?”

Isabella didn’t answer. Her eyes were barely open as she pressed against him limply. She wrapped her arms around his neck and mumbled, “I’ll pay you… I don’t care who you are… name your price…”

Her scorching breath brushed against his neck, sending fire through his veins.

Nathaniel realized she had completely lost her senses. He couldn’t take advantage of her in this state.

He grabbed her restless hands, his voice strained but controlled. “Isabella, you’re testing my limits.”

Isabella was already overwhelmed, but the sound of his deep, magnetic voice made her want him even more.

She pressed her body against his, overpowering him until he fell back against the sofa.
###Chapter 187

Nathaniel’s brows shot up as Isabella pressed her body flush against his.

He stiffened instantly.

It would be a lie to say he didn’t want her. Not when she was straddling him like this, all seduction and heat.

But he knew Isabella. Knew her too well.

If he took advantage of her now, she would never forgive him.

He fought back the primal urge surging through him.

In one swift motion, he stood up, lifting her with him.

She clung to him like an octopus, her arms winding tightly around his neck.

Her skin was on fire. She needed relief, and her hands began frantically pulling at his clothes.

Rip!

The sound of tearing fabric echoed in the room.

Her grip was surprisingly strong. She had torn his white shirt open, exposing his muscular chest.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened.

If this continued, his self-control would shatter.

He quickened his pace, carrying her into the bathroom.

He placed her in the bathtub and turned on the cold water.

The cool water began filling the tub around her.

Slowly, her frantic movements stilled. She grew calmer.

Nathaniel let out a sigh of relief.

But then, without warning, Isabella’s hands went to her own clothes.

With a sharp tug, she ripped her top apart.

The fabric gave way with another loud tear.

She sat there, partially undressed, looking utterly bewitching.

Nathaniel was stunned. This woman was pure torture.

“Isabella…” his voice was a strained whisper. “I can’t hold back much longer.”

Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

It was Sebastian. He was back with the medicine.

Nathaniel walked out of the bathroom to meet him.

The moment Sebastian saw his brother, he had to bite his tongue to stop a laugh.

He could only chuckle inwardly. Nathaniel’s shirt was torn wide open, revealing his chest.

What passionate escapade had he missed?

Nathaniel’s face was grim. “The medicine. Now.”

“Where is your wife?” Sebastian asked, trying to be professional. “I brought several types. I need to see her to diagnose which one she needs. Giving the wrong medicine could be dangerous.”

But Nathaniel would never allow another man to see Isabella in such a vulnerable state.

“Just give me the medicine,” he asserted, his tone leaving no room for argument. “If a Blackwood family doctor can’t do his job without seeing the patient, then he’s of no use to this family.”

Sebastian was baffled. How could he prescribe without a diagnosis? Even a miracle worker couldn’t do that.

But he had never seen Nathaniel look so intense, so dangerously on edge.

Reluctantly, he handed over the medical kit containing ten different vials.

“At least describe her condition to me,” Sebastian reasoned. “Is she conscious? Does she have any energy left? Is she dizzy? Can she speak?”

Nathaniel thought for a moment. “Her strength comes and goes. She can speak, but she’s not in her right mind.”

Sebastian pondered this, making his best educated guess.

He selected a specific vial and handed it to Nathaniel.

“Brother, are you sure you don’t want me to come in? If she takes the wrong—”

Before he could finish, Nathaniel snatched the medicine and slammed the door in his face.

Sebastian stood there, bewildered.

Wow. His brother was really ditching him for a woman.

Back in the bathroom, Nathaniel froze at the doorway.

Isabella had managed to take off her jeans and her coat.

She was now sitting in the tub, wearing only her bikini, soaking in the cool water.

Her fair skin glistened. Her long legs were stretched out.

The sight was utterly arresting.
###Chapter 188

Nathaniel snatched the towel from the edge of the tub. He tilted Isabella’s chin upward, carefully placing the pill on her tongue.

It dissolved almost instantly. The restless thrashing ceased. Her body went still in the water, the tension finally leaving her limbs.

Asleep at last.

He lifted her from the tub, wrapping the towel securely around her before carrying her out of the bathroom.

Morning light streamed through the windows. Isabella’s eyes fluttered open. She stared at the ornate ceiling above. This wasn't her room. But the familiarity was unnerving.

This place… It was the same suite from five years ago.

The memory slammed into her. The drug. Last night.

She turned her head. A man lay beside her.

Nathaniel Blackwood.

He was still asleep, his features softened in the gentle dawn light. A perfect, tranquil painting.

She felt no urge to admire him. Isabella threw the covers back. Her eyes narrowed. She was down to her underwear.

A quick glance at him. He wore a dark robe. The fabric gaped open, revealing the hard planes of his chest.

What…

What happened here?

She glared at him, her voice a low, furious hiss. “What did you do to me last night?!”

His eyes opened. He found her anxious, furious gaze fixed on him. A lazy, teasing smile touched his lips. “What do you think happened?”

That tone. That infuriating, knowing tone.

Isabella’s mind reeled. Did they…? Did he discover her secrets?

No. Stop. That wasn’t the point.

The evidence was right in front of her.

“Nathaniel, how dare you take advantage of me!”

“Me? Take advantage of you?”

He sat up, throwing his ruined shirt toward her. He pointed to the fresh scratch marks on his chest. “Look at this. Who assaulted whom here?”

She stared at the torn fabric. The marks on his skin did look… recent.

Wait. Did she… attack him under the drug’s influence?

“Well… We’re both adults. I was drugged. Let’s just… pretend this never happened.”

She scrambled out of bed and bolted for the bathroom.

Nathaniel remained seated, his expression freezing. “Pretend it never happened?” he muttered, a dark displeasure in his voice.

The thought made her stomach churn. She had been with Nathaniel Blackwood. Westchester’s most formidable bachelor.

“If you require compensation for your… losses, I’ll pay you one million. Not a penny more.”

Nathaniel went completely still. One million? She was offering him money?

Thank god nothing actually happened last night. Her reaction was already this extreme. He could only imagine the fallout if it had.

He pressed further, his voice dropping. “You’re a grown woman. Can’t you tell if something truly occurred?”

The implication sank in. Her brow furrowed in sudden, dawning comprehension.
###Chapter 189

Nathaniel made a valid point. Isabella couldn't detect any pain or discomfort throughout her body. In fact, she felt completely normal.

The more she assessed herself, the more Isabella realized nothing felt off. That could only mean one thing…

“So nothing happened between us?” she asked, still dazed. “You truly didn’t take advantage of me?”

“Rest assured, I’m not so desperate as to exploit someone in that state,” Nathaniel replied, his tone slightly sharp as he moved toward the bathroom.

As he passed by, Isabella’s gaze remained fixed on his retreating figure, disbelief swirling within her.

Could Nathaniel be telling the truth? Had he really done nothing to her last night?

This was the same man who had proposed marriage the moment they met. Was it possible he showed such restraint when the opportunity arose?

A strange sense of gratitude washed over her.

Nathaniel emerged from the bathroom already dressed in fresh attire.

He handed her a bag from the nearby locker. “Your clothes are in here.”

“Thank you.” Isabella accepted it and made her way to the bathroom.

As she passed him, she paused. “Did I… do anything unusual last night?”

Nathaniel’s mind flashed to the previous night’s events. “What do you think?”

His suggestive tone made her cheeks flush instantly.

She had torn his clothes off! Was that not outrageous enough?

“Ahem! Just… forget I asked. There’s no need to remember any of it!”

Nathaniel eyed her curiously. “Why?”

Why? How could he even ask that?

Isabella’s temper flared. “Nathaniel, what are you playing at? Do you want me to end our agreement?”

Incredible. She still had the nerve to threaten him.

Nathaniel found her endearing with her disheveled hair and unusually expressive face—so different from her usual icy demeanor.

Knowing she had a long day ahead, he decided not to tease her further. “Don’t worry. I’ve already forgotten everything about last night.” He would keep those memories private, locked away as something precious.

Isabella huffed and stormed into the bathroom.

The space had been thoroughly cleaned, erasing all traces of the previous night’s chaos. Yet, it couldn’t erase the hazy images lingering in her mind…

When her eyes fell on the bathtub, the memory of her tearing off her clothes while Nathaniel restrained her resurfaced vividly.

Her heart raced uncontrollably. Last night had been utterly unbelievable!

Embarrassment flooded her, but so did fury at how close she had come to disaster. She wanted Lawrence Chamberlain dead!

Down in the lobby, Dominic received a message on his phone and promptly arrested Lawrence.

Lawrence dropped to his knees. Though terrified of Dominic, he persisted with his lie. “I’ve been wronged! Manager Genevieve investigated this! The footage clearly shows Ms. Isabella invited me and requested… special services!”

As he spoke, Dominic stepped forward and handed a tablet to Nathaniel. “Sir, the video evidence suggests Ms. Isabella was the one who summoned him. Multiple witnesses confirm it.”

The video indeed showed Beatrice Holloway relaying a message to Lawrence, instructing him to visit Isabella’s room. It also showed Isabella opening the door voluntarily to let him in.

Nathaniel set the tablet aside and fixed a cold, penetrating gaze on Lawrence.

“This is your final chance to tell the truth,” he stated, his voice icy and threatening.

Lawrence trembled violently, but the voice in his head echoed relentlessly.

‘If everything goes according to plan, you’ll get three million. If it fails but you don’t implicate me, I’ll give you ten million. Just make sure you handle this properly…!’

If he failed now, Nathaniel would destroy him. Prison would be the least of his worries.

His only option was to hold firm. Three million dollars awaited him! He insisted desperately, “Mr. Blackwood, please believe me! I’m telling the truth!”
###Chapter 190

Isabella stepped out of the bathroom.

Her expression froze instantly.

Lawrence Chamberlain was on his knees.

Nathaniel’s gaze met hers.

He didn’t ask for explanations.

He didn’t demand reasons.

His voice was calm.

“What do you want me to do with him?”

Isabella felt a surge of warmth.

He trusted her completely.

She glanced at the trembling man.

A cold smirk touched her lips.

“That disgusting pervert.”

Her voice was sharp.

“Castrate him.”

A man like him only brought harm.

Nathaniel turned to Dominic.

“You heard her.”

Dominic nodded.

“Understood.”

He dragged Lawrence away.

Lawrence’s screams echoed.

“Mr. Blackwood! Please! Have mercy!”

His voice cracked with fear.

“I admit it! I did it! I’ll never do it again!”

He was sobbing now.

“Someone paid me! They paid me to do it!”

Isabella didn’t care.

Neither did Nathaniel.

It was too late for excuses.

Isabella already knew the truth.

Only three people knew about that night.

Herself. Alexander. Victoria.

Alexander wouldn’t betray her now.

That left only Victoria.

Victoria used her trauma against her.

She set this entire thing up.

All to ruin her reputation.

How pathetic.

Nathaniel studied her.

“Were you investigating something with him?”

Isabella stiffened.

She was digging into the past.

Should she tell Nathaniel?

The thought unsettled her.

They had only been together six months.

Six more months remained on their contract.

She didn’t want his pity.

Or his disgust.

She met his gaze.

Her tone turned sharp.

“That’s my business.”

A warning edged her words.

“You’re not going to invade my privacy, are you?”

Nathaniel sensed her walls.

He respected them.

“Don’t worry.”

His voice softened.

“I’ll respect your boundaries.”

He meant it.

“Tell me whenever you’re ready.”

Isabella relaxed.

Nathaniel kept his promises.

“Thanks for last night.”

She changed the subject.

“I have a shoot.”

She headed for the door.

“See you later.”

Nathaniel watched her leave.

His eyes darkened.

Isabella was always so controlled.

But that look in her eyes…

It was haunted.

Something troubled her deeply.

What was she hiding?

Dominic returned.

“Should I investigate, sir?”

Nathaniel’s face was grim.

He shook his head.

He had given his word.

Instead, he asked another question.

“What about Vivienne Delacroix?”

Dominic sighed.

“Sebastian questioned her last night.”

He delivered the report.

“She admitted to drugging you.”

He paused.

“She was heading upstairs when a fire broke out.”

“Her mother was trapped inside.”

“She rushed back.”

Dominic’s tone was flat.

“I verified the story.”

“It checks out.”

So even Vivienne didn’t know who entered the room.

Nathaniel’s eyes turned stormy.

Downstairs, Isabella entered the dressing room.

A figure stood inside.

Elegant. Poised.

Vivienne Delacroix wore a silk halterneck dress.

Pearlescent fabric hugged her curves.

Her skin glowed.

Long curls cascaded down her back.

She looked like a movie star.

Isabella’s eyes narrowed.

Why was Vivienne here?
###Chapter 191

McKenzie spoke to McAmor in a hushed, honeyed tone.

Isabella couldn't help recalling the rumors linking McKenzie to Nathaniel. A faint unease stirred within her. She quickly suppressed it and approached them.

McKenzie happened to be standing right at Isabella's vanity. Isabella had no choice but to politely say, "Excuse me, ladies."

McAmor glanced over. "Isabella's here, Sister. She's the new face of our collection."

McKenzie didn't even look Isabella's way. She kept her focus on McAmor. "Then it's settled. You must attend our tech awards ceremony in two days." With that, she swept out of the room with an elegant grace, her gaze never once drifting toward Isabella or her surroundings.

The sharp click of her heels echoed through the space. Each tap seemed to resonate deep within the hearts of everyone present. All eyes followed her with pure admiration. McKenzie's aura was overwhelmingly powerful and flawless. From head to toe, she was the picture of perfection. Her skin was as fair and smooth as milk foam, like delicate porcelain crafted by the heavens themselves.

It was Isabella's first time witnessing such innate nobility and grace. McKenzie's prestige was in a league of its own. If one were to compare her to the ever-popular Victoria, McKenzie made Victoria seem cheap and utterly lacking in refinement. If Victoria was a pristine white lotus raised in a sheltered greenhouse, then Isabella was a hardy piranha, weathered by storms and scorching sun.

In that context, McKenzie was a phoenix soaring above the clouds, untouched by earthly dust. Her elegance and nobility were cultivated from a lifetime of privilege, a blessing very few ever experienced.

Isabella took her seat at the vanity, her eyes narrowing slightly. Perhaps only a woman of such perfect elegance could truly be a match for Nathaniel. A woman like that probably didn't even believe in something as trivial as 'love'.

"Isabella, you need to give your absolute best for the main advertisement shoot today," McAmor told her. "My sister has never taken much interest in my work before. But when she heard you were the ambassador, she came to see for herself."

After the events of the previous day, McAmor had newfound confidence in Isabella. Her tone was now more assured and calm.

Isabella gave a noncommittal hum, her mind racing. 'Her sister showed no previous interest, but came because of me? Yet McKenzie completely ignored my presence. Something doesn't add up here...'

Once her makeup was done, Isabella and the crew headed out early to capture the dawn light for the first shots.

Meanwhile, Victoria tossed and turned, unable to sleep. She was anxiously waiting for news from Manager Brown. She had a press release ready, prepared to expose Isabella's scandalous personal life and her affairs with younger men to the world. Even if not everyone believed it, Victoria would be satisfied if it tarnished Isabella's reputation just a little.

But after a whole night of waiting, the only update from Ronnie was that Manager Brown had been fired! By Nathaniel himself!

It was over. All her meticulous planning, her ten million dollars—everything was wasted.

That very same day, footage of Isabella in the gowns went viral. Isabella looked breathtakingly alluring and captivating in the morning light. It didn't take long for her to become the center of attention once again.

Argh! Unacceptable! Victoria couldn't stand it. With everyone fawning over Isabella, her popularity kept skyrocketing. Victoria had to bring her down. She had to destroy her completely. Remembering her backup plan, Victoria grabbed her phone and called Alexander.

He answered on the third ring, his voice flat. "I'm in a meeting. What is it?"

Ever since that disastrous day, the day of her punishment, Alexander had been giving her the cold shoulder. Victoria felt a pang of heartache, but she masked it with a sweet, gentle tone. "Alexander, darling, I called to say goodbye. I've done so many terrible things lately. I don't even recognize myself anymore. I've decided to go to the countryside to reflect and find myself again."

"The countryside?" Alexander frowned. "You've never lived outside the city. What could you possibly do in a place like that?"
###Chapter 192

“Since everyone despises me now, I need time alone for self-reflection. While I’m away, Alexander darling, you must do everything to win Isabella over.”

Victoria paused briefly, then continued in an even sweeter tone. “Even though my sister lost her purity, had a child, and recently became Nathaniel’s mistress… she’s still remarkable. If you can be with her—even if not for her fortune—it’s far better than being with someone like me.”

“What nonsense are you saying? How could I ever fall for a promiscuous, morally bankrupt woman like her?”

Alexander thought of Isabella’s actions and felt a wave of disgust. “When are you leaving? I’ll take you to the airport.”

“No need, my love. Just promise me you’ll take care of yourself. Don’t overwork. Even if you don’t like Isabella, you must pursue her. Her assets will secure your position in the Whitmore family. Call me anytime—I’ll always support you.”

Victoria hung up, her voice dripping with false sweetness. A smug, satisfied smile spread across her face.

‘No man can resist a woman who knows how to play sweet and vulnerable. Did Alexander really think he could forget me? Impossible!’

She began packing immediately. Her new plan was to retreat to the countryside temporarily. She would return in glory one month later.

Meanwhile, Alexander was troubled by Victoria’s words. Despite his coldness, she still supported him selflessly. Yes, Victoria had made mistakes, but her intentions were always to help him. Unlike Isabella…

His eyes fell on a report from Harrison: Last night, Isabella checked into The Ritz-Carlton. Nathaniel arrived just before midnight.

They spent the night together.

Disgraceful! She was still technically his fiancée, yet she spent the night with another man! What did her beauty matter? She was nothing like Victoria! Still… given his current situation, he needed Isabella’s shares and her diamond connections. She held twenty-five percent of the Montgomery Group stock.

Suppressing his revulsion, he ordered Harrison, “Prepare a gift basket. I’m going to The Ritz-Carlton.”

“Right away, sir.”

At The Ritz-Carlton.

Nathaniel had already left when Isabella returned from her morning shoot. Exhausted, she headed straight to bed. Less than an hour later, an insistent doorbell jerked her awake.

She dragged herself to the door and checked the peephole. Alexander stood outside, looking arrogantly impatient.

Him again? He actually showed up?

Isabella had no intention of opening the door. But she knew Alexander—he would keep ringing until she gave in.

She yanked the door open. “What do you want?”

Hearing her annoyed tone, Alexander felt another surge of disgust. How could she ever compare to Victoria?

He forced a pleasant expression. “I heard you’re here for a shoot. I brought lunch—your favorite.”

He tried to step inside, but Isabella blocked the doorway. “No stray animals allowed. If you’re just delivering food, you can leave now.” Her voice was ice.
###Chapter 193

Alexander’s eyes narrowed sharply. “Isabella, you let another man into your room, but you refuse me? Have you forgotten we’re still engaged?”

“Engaged?” Isabella let out a cold, mocking laugh. Her gaze was sharp and dismissive. “Did that thought ever cross your mind while you were wrapped up with Victoria? What gives you the right to question me now?”

“So you are jealous after all,” Alexander said, a smug, arrogant smirk spreading across his face. He was convinced she was still hung up on him—this was all just an act, a game to get back at him.

The sheer audacity made her stomach turn. How could one man be so utterly delusional? It was nauseating.

Before she could even form a retort, he pressed on. “Isabella, I’m here to make things right. I’ve ended it with Victoria. She’s gone to the countryside to reflect. Nothing stands between us anymore.”

He took a step closer, his tone dripping with false sincerity. “I’m even willing to overlook what happened five years ago. That’s more than any other man would offer. Think carefully—no one else would marry a woman with your… history.”

Isabella’s mind raced. Victoria, in the countryside? That didn’t sound like her. Something was off.

When she stayed silent, Alexander mistook it for consideration. “You always accused me of wanting your fortune. That was five years ago. I’ve built my own empire since then. Why would I need yours now?”

He leaned in, voice softening manipulatively. “And think about Nathaniel Blackwood. Do you really believe he’d accept your past? He’s toying with you. A woman needs stability—a family. I can give you that.”

Isabella’s expression darkened. “You truly want to get back together? You’re sure you want to marry me?”

“I give you my word.” His reply was smooth, practiced. He wasn’t lying—not entirely. Marrying her meant securing her assets. And she was still breathtakingly beautiful. Virgin or not, she’d serve her purpose.

Victoria would understand. She’d help him secure everything.

Isabella saw right through him. But she had her own game to play. “Prove your sincerity. Pursue me properly for one month. Then I’ll marry you.”

“Pursue you?” His face tightened with irritation.

“Yes. Or did you expect me to say yes immediately? Do I need to teach you how to court a woman?” Her tone was ice.

“Of course not,” he replied quickly. One month was nothing. After that, she’d be his—assets and all.

“I’ll do it. Will you at least accept lunch with me today?”

She took the lunch bag and feigned a yawn. “I’m tired. I need to rest. You should go—start planning. And don’t forget to tweet about courting me. Publicly.”

She shut the door before he could protest.

Alexander stood there, seething. A public tweet? She wanted the whole world to know? Humiliating. But he had no choice now.

He pulled out his phone, found her profile, and sent a direct message: [You promise to marry me after one month?]

[Yes.]

One word. Clear and final.

He screenshotted it, swallowing his pride, and left the hotel. As he walked, he texted his assistant: [Draft a romantic tweet. Mention Isabella Montgomery.]

No way was he wasting time crafting some lovesick post. Let his staff handle the embarrassing details.

Later that day, Alexander’s Twitter updated: [After all this time, it’s always been you. Isabella Montgomery.]
###Chapter 194

A vintage photo accompanied the tweet, capturing Alexander and Isabella's hands intertwined. Though only their clasped hands were visible, everyone instantly recognized them.

(That's definitely Isabella's hand! I'd know it anywhere! No one else has hands that exquisite!)

(Didn't Alexander and Isabella just have that massive century bet recently? How are they a couple now?)

(Wait, what? This doesn't add up. Isn't Alexander with Victoria? Why is he chasing after Isabella now?)

(Rumor has it Alexander and Isabella were together five years ago. They were even engaged!)

(Seriously? A long-lost reunion then?)

(Probably!! Looks like they're going public!)

Netizens exploded with theories and speculation. Both Alexander and Isabella's names shot to the top of Twitter's trending list.

Inside The Palace Heart.

The living room air was thick with tension. Nathaniel sat rigidly on the ornate European sofa, his expression dark and unreadable. Oliver was pouting beside him, his small face a mask of clear unhappiness.

After a long silence, the boy finally looked up. "Daddy," he asked, his voice small, "do you think Mommy is falling for that bad man? She always replies or says something clever before."

In the past, Isabella would have immediately tweeted something sharp, like 'Reunite? Never in a million years!'

Today, there was only silence. His monitoring software even showed she had logged into Twitter an hour ago.

Nathaniel said nothing. His expression grew even stormier.

Click.

The front door opened. Isabella walked in.

"I'm back," she announced cheerfully, as if completely unaware of the atmosphere.

"Mommy!" Oliver jumped up, ready to run to her.

Nathaniel's voice cut through the room, low and firm. "Momo, go to the study and finish your homework."

"Hmph..." Oliver pouted but obeyed, trudging away on his little legs. He glanced back over his shoulder several times.

Isabella finally sensed the heavy mood. Once Oliver was gone, she turned to Nathaniel. "What's going on?"

Nathaniel remained seated, his intense gaze fixed on her. "What is happening between you and Alexander Whitmore?" His voice was deep, magnetic, and laced with unmistakable displeasure and jealousy.

Understanding dawned on her. He was making a big deal out of this Alexander nonsense?

She slipped off her shoes and walked toward him. "I gave him one month to pursue me. How do you think Victoria will feel watching her precious darling shower me with attention?"

So, it was all to provoke Victoria?

Nathaniel's expression softened a fraction. "And after the month is over?"

"After a month?" A cold, calculated smirk played on her lips. "The real show begins then! I'll agree to marry him. On our wedding day, they will finally return what they stole from me five years ago!"

Her words were bold and carried a chilling edge, despite the summer heat. Nathaniel's tightly drawn brows relaxed slightly. It always took just a few words from her...

"Get some rest," he said, his voice now low and calm. "I'll call you when dinner is ready."

"No, I'm fine. I'll go keep Oliver company," Isabella said, heading for the study. She was worried the news had upset him; she couldn't risk him getting sick again.

She entered the study to find Oliver intently reading a report. It was about Vivienne Delacroix!

The document was incredibly detailed, covering her biography, her habits, her preferences... everything.

Isabella frowned. Why was there such a comprehensive dossier on Vivienne in Nathaniel's study?
###Chapter 195

Christopher jolted back in surprise, his small frame tensing as he saw Isabella standing there. He hastily shoved the report into the desk drawer, his voice trembling slightly. "Mommy, you... did you see that?"

Isabella made a noncommittal sound, choosing not to press him further. She settled beside him, her tone gentle but firm. "Oliver, I know you've seen the things online about me and that man. You mustn't believe any of it. It's all part of a strategy."

His eyes widened, hope flickering within them. "Really? So you'll stay with Daddy forever? You'll never leave us?"

The word 'forever' sent a subtle tremor through Isabella. Forever? Such a concept felt foreign, unrealistic. Her plan was strictly three months. Yet...

She forced a nod, keeping her doubts locked away. "Of course. Don't worry about these things. Focus on your studies and being happy. You need to grow up strong and healthy, understand?"

"Yes! Oliver will always listen to Mommy!" He nodded vigorously, relief washing over his small features. He studied her expression carefully before venturing, "Mommy, why didn't you ask about the report? It wasn't Daddy's. Grandfather Montgomery sent it. He said... at his sixtieth birthday party next month... he's announcing Daddy's engagement to Vivienne..."

He spoke honestly, fearing her anger.

But Isabella had anticipated this. It didn't affect her. "It's fine. I'm not upset."

Since her departure was inevitable, Anthony's engagements were irrelevant. They held no weight for her.

Oliver burrowed into her arms, his voice laced with worry. "But I only want you, Mommy. I don't like anyone else. I don't want another mommy. I want to be with you forever!" He nuzzled deeper into her embrace, whining softly.

Her heart softened. A sigh escaped her. She only planned for three months, yet he dreamed of a lifetime. Children were so pure, so trusting. A pang of concern hit her. What would happen when those three months ended?

Meanwhile, Victoria had departed Montgomery Manor, arriving in a remote, sleepy town far from the city's bustle.

She surveyed the unappealing cottage with open disgust. But she steeled herself. This was necessary for her plan. She had to endure it.

"Clean this hovel!" she snapped at Penelope. "I want it spotless before dark!"

"Yes, Miss Kensington..." Penelope bowed her head, immediately beginning to tidy with efficient movements.

Victoria found a relatively clean spot and pulled out her phone to kill time. She intended to browse the news, but her feed was flooded with updates about Alexander and Isabella.

Alexander's post was shockingly heartfelt. He seemed genuinely serious! She had just been exiled to this backwater, and he was already publicly pursuing Isabella?

What if he actually fell for her during this process? No, impossible! Alexander was far too arrogant. Why would he ever want a woman with a tainted past? Besides, Isabella was just Nathaniel's mistress!

She tried to soothe her rising insecurities. Her plan needed to accelerate. Immediately.

That evening, she created a new Instagram account. She posted carefully curated videos of the rustic scenery—rolling hills, a babbling brook, farmland, and simple villagers. She narrated in her soft, cultured voice, "Finding peace within while rediscovering myself. This is a journey of self-reflection and a new beginning."

A meticulously calculated move to rehabilitate her image.
###Chapter 196

Victoria's video failed to gain significant traction on Instagram. The new account struggled to compete against the platform's overwhelming content volume.

At Whitmore Enterprises...

Harrison Caldwell presented a bound document to Alexander. "Mr. Whitmore, this relationship proposal was developed by a certified intimacy coordinator. Following this protocol for thirty days guarantees Miss Montgomery's emotional investment."

Alexander skimmed the contents, his stomach churning at the prescribed rituals: mandatory morning and evening texts, daily floral arrangements, chauffeur services...

The proposal detailed shared meal preparation, pet ownership bonding exercises, and curated couple's retreats. Memories of performing these actions organically with Victoria soured his mood. Reducing romance to checklist items felt degrading, especially when targeting someone like Isabella.

His expression darkened as he circled acceptable tasks before shoving the document back. "Use my burner phone. You're handling these."

"Sir? This approach seems... inadequate," Harrison hesitated.

Though aware of Alexander's asset acquisition motives, such perfunctory execution felt reckless. Isabella Montgomery wasn't some naive socialite to be manipulated through textbook gestures.

Alexander's glare sharpened. "Problem?"

"No, sir. Immediate implementation." Harrison retreated swiftly.

Alexander's gaze lingered on the discarded proposal, frustration tightening his features. Delegating half the tasks provided minimal relief—the remaining requirements still demanded personal involvement.

He'd monitor Isabella's reactions before committing further. Both anticipated sarcastic rejections or deliberate complications. Neither predicted her unsettling compliance.

Despite ignoring WhatsApp messages, she accepted every delivered gift. Gourmet meals, designer outfits, rare delicacies—all received without protest.

Mid-month, Isabella updated her private feed: Revisiting the past sometimes brings unexpected clarity.

Accompanying screenshots displayed Alexander's daily texts and all accumulated gifts. The narrative suggested genuine emotional impact.

A cold smirk touched Alexander's lips. Women truly were predictable creatures. A few baubles and perfunctory attention melted all resistance. Now to finalize arrangements with both families.

The Jordan family monitored Isabella's private account, including Victoria among her "close friends."

Victoria reclined on her veranda, cucumber mask obscuring her features as she scrolled. Penelope dug planting beds nearby, burying vegetable seeds. Victoria avoided Twitter to escape Isabella's professional triumphs, only to confront her personal life here.

Alexander had been sending Isabella daily affirmations? Purchasing exorbitant gifts? He belonged to her!

No. Composure was essential. One more month of performance remained. The internet's scrutiny demanded her silence, but watching Isabella flaunt stolen affections sickened her. Her parents must be equally disgusted.

Her thumb hovered over Joey's contact when Alexander's name flashed across her screen.

He was calling? After days of impersonal texts, this sudden direct contact sparked wild hope. Had he finally remembered her?
###Chapter 197

Victoria's heart soared when Alexander's name flashed on her screen. She answered with practiced sweetness. "Alexander, my love..."

"Victoria, how are you holding up out there?" His voice carried genuine concern.

She glanced around the mosquito-infested room, grimacing. "I'm perfectly fine, darling. Please don't worry about me. How are you doing?"

"I called because something important happened," Alexander revealed. "Isabella made a promise to me half a month ago. She said if I pursued her for a full month, she'd agree to marry me."

"Marry you? Seriously?" Victoria nearly shrieked, barely containing her excitement.

Though she despised Alexander's courtship of Isabella, the marriage prospect thrilled her. Once wed, Isabella's stubborn pride would force her to abandon entertainment. She'd become a dull housewife, probably handing over all her assets to Alexander willingly.

When Victoria eventually married Alexander, she'd become the wife of the world's wealthiest man!

Alexander mistook her reaction for shared joy. "I have screenshots as proof. Her Instagram activity suggests she's genuinely moved."

"I need your help convincing your family to accept this marriage. I want to make this happen quickly."

Victoria's enthusiasm dimmed. So this call was merely transactional? Their relationship felt increasingly superficial.

She buried her disappointment, adopting a supportive tone. "Darling, you know I'll always support you. I promised to help you succeed, and I keep my promises. I'll call Mother immediately and persuade the family to approve this union."

"You're amazing, Victoria. Once I secure her assets, I won't forget your loyalty," Alexander cooed with artificial sweetness.

They exchanged more nauseating pleasantries before ending the call.

The moment the line disconnected, Victoria's smile vanished into a cold smirk. Alexander used to promise, "Once I have her assets, I'll marry you properly with the grandest wedding. We'll have a future filled with love."

Now it had dwindled to "I won't forget your loyalty."

Had his marriage promise become mere obligation? Had his feelings changed?

Clearly, Victoria needed contingency plans.

She retrieved a hidden diary from her suitcase, scribbling furiously with a pen. After documenting her thoughts, she dialed Eleanor.

Eleanor's anxious voice answered immediately. "Victoria! Where have you been? Why haven't you called? Your father and I have been worried sick!"

"Mother, please forgive me for worrying you. I needed time alone for reflection and clarity. I'm perfectly safe and taking good care of myself," Victoria reassured with saccharine sweetness.

Eleanor sighed heavily. "You've never been away this long. I fear you might do something drastic out there."

"Just come home. Everyone's moved past that incident anyway. Your grandfather forbade anyone from discussing it. No one blames you anymore."

No one blames me? Then why hasn't my ten percent share been returned?

Victoria seethed internally while maintaining calm composure. "I appreciate everyone's forgiveness, Mother, but I can't forgive myself yet. I need this full month of reflection. Please understand."

"Actually, I called hoping you could help rekindle things between Isabella and Alexander."

"What? Victoria, have you lost your mind? I thought you loved Alexander!" Eleanor gasped in disbelief.
###Chapter 198

“It’s because I love him, Mother,” Victoria said softly. “That’s why his happiness matters more than anything. His heart belongs to Isabella. Forcing him to stay with me would only bring him pain… and turn his love for me into resentment. Their bond was written long before I ever came into the picture. I was always the outsider.”

“Don’t you dare say that! Don’t you ever speak of yourself that way!” Eleanor’s voice was sharp, protective. “Alexander is the one who’s blind—chasing after Isabella when he was promised to you! Your father warned him, but that arrogant man never listens!”

Even if he had reasons to leave Isabella all those years ago, that gave him no right to discard her daughter. Not when Victoria had given him her heart.

Victoria shook her head, her expression pained but resolved. “You misunderstand him, Mother. I was the one who ended things. I’ve had time to think… to realize what I’ve done.”

She took a shaky breath. “What I did to Isabella… it was monstrous. Back then, no one stood by her. No one but Alexander. I may have lost him, but I still have you and Father. That’s why… I want to step aside. Let her have him. Maybe then… this guilt will hurt a little less.”

Her words were gentle, self-sacrificing. Eleanor’s heart ached with pride and sorrow.

“Oh, my dear girl… Having a daughter as kind as you is a blessing. I will find you a husband worthy of you—someone far better than Alexander Whitmore.”

“Thank you, Mother.”

That same evening, Eleanor commented publicly on Isabella’s post:

[If you truly wish to rekindle what was lost, your sister has graciously consented. It’s clear you and Alexander share a history that cannot be ignored.]

At the same time, a private message from Theodore Montgomery arrived in Isabella’s inbox:

[I believe you and Alexander should set a date for the wedding celebration.]

Meanwhile, inside the Blackwood Estate, Isabella was guiding Oliver through a series of yoga poses. The practice was meant to soothe his nerves, to bring calm to a mind often clouded by illness.

Nearby, Nathaniel noticed Isabella’s phone light up. His eyes flickered over the screen—first Eleanor’s comment, then Theodore’s message. Even Alexander had texted her:

[Isabella, your family has given their blessing. Have I proven myself these past weeks? There are only fifteen days left. If you agree, I will begin arranging our wedding.]

Nathaniel knew this was all part of her plan—a carefully laid trap for her prey. But knowing didn’t stop the hot coil of jealousy tightening in his chest. Alexander’s relentless pursuit, the gifts, the pressure from her family… Was he really discussing wedding plans?

His gaze shifted, dark and displeased, toward Oliver.

The boy, seated cross-legged on his mat with headphones on, sensed his father’s mood instantly. He clutched his stomach dramatically.

“Oww… Mommy, my tummy hurts! I need the bathroom—I’ll be right back!” He scrambled up and bolted from the room before Isabella could respond.

She smiled faintly, assuming he was just avoiding the session. She resumed her pose. There was much to prepare for—not just the impending confrontation, but the upcoming Night of Glory. She intended to sweep every major award that night, to leave Victoria seething with helpless envy.

Balancing on one leg, Isabella extended the other high behind her, her body forming a clean, elegant line. The dancer’s pose required focus, strength, and grace—a perfect metaphor for her current life.

But she hadn’t practiced this particular pose in too long. Her core wavered. Her balance broke.

She started to tilt, bracing for the fall.

Then a pair of strong hands caught her firmly around the waist.
###Chapter 199

Isabella spun around to find Nathaniel standing right behind her.

She hadn't heard him approach. Dressed in casual home attire, he looked less intimidating than usual, his sharp features softened into an elegant refinement.

She stumbled backward, landing against his chest. Her head tilted back as his hands settled firmly on her waist. She wore only a thin yoga top and form-fitting leggings...

Isabella quickly tried to regain her composure, but Nathaniel's grip tightened, refusing to let her go. She frowned. "Mr. Blackwood?"

His voice came out low and stern. "Are you truly going through with marrying Alexander?"

"Yes. I told you before—it's not real. The wedding won't actually happen," she replied.

Nathaniel's expression remained severe. "You're treating something serious like a game. Is it worth taking such a risk?" Displeasure laced his deep tone.

Straining from the awkward arch in her back, Isabella pushed against his arms with force. "It's not a game. It's a strategy," she explained, her tone deliberately casual despite his intensity.

'Using marriage as a strategy?'

"Isabella, just tell me what you need. I can handle any problem for you."

She didn't need to go this far!

She met his gaze squarely. "Mr. Blackwood, remember our agreement. You can fix almost anything with power and money—but not people's hearts. Besides, our contract clearly states we don't interfere in each other's personal lives. I expect you to honor that."

With that, she broke free from his hold and walked away.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened as he watched her retreat.

Passing the sofa, Isabella noticed her phone lighting up. She picked it up and replied to Alexander: [Yes. Proceed with the wedding arrangements. Make it grand and very public. Announce it everywhere.]

Reading her text, Alexander immediately tried to dissuade her. He had hoped for a quiet certificate signing, not a spectacle.

[Isabella, simple ceremonies are more fashionable now. And you're busy—a large wedding would take days.]

[I'll manage my time,] she replied firmly.

Alexander's face darkened. She had been so defiant weeks ago—now she seemed desperate to marry him!

Just as he expected. Pathetic!

Once they were legally bound, he would make her suffer. He replied: [Alright. I'll start the preparations.]

Satisfied, Isabella then texted Julian: [Schedule me only half-day shoots or events for the next two weeks.]

Julian: [Busy?]

Isabella: [Yes. Wedding.]

Julian: [With Nathaniel?]

Isabella: [Of course not! Do you think Nathaniel Blackwood would marry me? It's Alexander—you know why.]

Julian's confusion cleared as he understood her plan.

[You're stirring the pot again?]

A smirk touched her lips. [Yes. Stay tuned.]

Isabella would make both Alexander and Victoria pay dearly at this wedding.

She set her phone down just as Oliver entered. Though she had warned him beforehand, things might still get messy. She decided to reassure him properly.
###Chapter 200

Isabella gestured for Oliver to come closer. “Momo, over here.”

“Mommy!” Oliver bounded into her arms like an eager puppy, his wide eyes gazing up at her.

“Mommy, is practice over now?”

Even though the moves were basic, all he could think about was sleeping and eating. Sleeping, then eating…

Isabella tousled his soft hair. “You can’t be lazy all the time, sweetheart. You need at least twenty minutes of exercise every day.”

“But we’re finished for today. Mommy has something important to tell you. For the next two weeks, I’ll be spending a lot of time with that awful man. We’ll even be planning our wedding.”

“Momo, you have to remember this is all part of Mommy’s plan. None of it is real. On the actual wedding day, I’m going to make sure that terrible man and his horrible accomplice are publicly humiliated. They will pay for everything they’ve done to me. So, you mustn’t be sad or worried, okay? Promise me you’ll take care of yourself.”

“Okay! Okay! Momo loves watching Mommy defeat the monsters! Momo will cheer for Mommy the whole time!”

Days flew by. Isabella went through the motions of selecting wedding gowns and hairstyles. Fortunately, Alexander was perpetually busy and held such disdain for her that he avoided these preparations entirely. This made everything much simpler for Isabella.

Despite this, paparazzi managed to snap photos of her during these appointments. Rumors of her impending marriage to Alexander exploded across the internet. Fans flooded her social media, desperate for confirmation. Even influential figures like Maxwell, Harrison Winslow, and other powerful contacts reached out for details.

Seeing an opportunity, Isabella composed a tweet. [Putting my career on hold, all for you.] She attached one of the photos of her in a wedding gown.

The internet went into a frenzy.

The Diamond Boss was abandoning her film shoots and endorsement deals… for Alexander Whitmore… for their wedding!

The wealthiest woman in the country was marrying Alexander Whitmore! They were a stunningly handsome couple, and netizens showered them with congratulations and well-wishes. The entire nation eagerly anticipated the wedding of the decade.

In the Blackwood estate study.

Sebastian burst into the room, his face etched with panic. “Nathaniel, are you just going to sit there? Isabella is officially engaged! To Alexander Whitmore! It’s all over the news!”

Nathaniel glanced at her social media feed. If he hadn’t known her true plan, his rage would have been uncontrollable. But knowing the truth, a faint, cold smile touched his lips. “It’s… acceptable.”

‘Acceptable?’

“Brother? Do you have a fever? Are you feeling unwell?” Sebastian moved to feel Nathaniel’s forehead.

Nathaniel shot him an icy glare and tossed a thick, embossed invitation card onto the desk. “Don’t forget to attend. It should be quite a spectacle.”

‘A spectacle?’

Sebastian frowned deeply. What kind of spectacle could this possibly be?

This made no sense. Instead of charging off to confront Isabella, Nathaniel was handing him a wedding invitation? And telling him to enjoy the show?

He then noticed Oliver nearby, calmly playing on his tablet, completely unbothered. “Momo, what’s wrong with your father? Has he lost his mind? Wait… why are you so calm about this too?”

“Uncle Sebastian, there’s no need to worry. Father is correct. There will be an excellent show. Just make sure you’re there to see it,” Oliver stated with the serious air of a miniature adult.

Slowly, comprehension dawned on Sebastian. “You all know this is part of Isabella’s scheme, don’t you? What is she planning this time?”

Nathaniel remained silent. Oliver simply gave a knowing nod.

Sebastian immediately dropped onto the couch beside Oliver. “She’s publicly announced her wedding to Alexander! What possible scheme could there be? You have to tell me, Momo! I’ll buy you all the ice cream you want!”

“I’m sorry, Uncle Sebastian. I promised Mommy I wouldn’t reveal her plan to anyone,” Oliver replied, his expression utterly solemn.

This only fueled Sebastian’s curiosity. They had done this to him before, and now they were doing it again! Why did they always have to toy with his curiosity?

He tried a threat. “Momo, if you don’t tell me, I won’t acknowledge you as my nephew anymore!”

“That’s alright. I still have Mommy!” Oliver responded with a bright, cheeky grin.

“!!!”

It was bad enough his own brother kept secrets from him. Now his nephew was doing the same!

Fine! He would just have to wait for the wedding day to see what incredible trick Isabella had planned.

###Chapter 201

The following two weeks became a media feeding frenzy.

Every detail of the upcoming wedding was dissected and analyzed.

From the design of the engagement rings to the choice of wedding gown designers.

The selected five-star hotel venue. The floral arrangements. The guest list.

Nothing was spared from public scrutiny.

One bride was the nation's wealthiest heiress. The groom was universally hailed as the 'Ideal National Husband,' a devastatingly handsome business titan.

Their union was the most anticipated social event of the decade.

Amidst this whirlwind, Victoria Kensington's private social media account quietly began trending.

She had posted roughly twenty videos on a new profile.

Each clip was meticulously crafted, rich with subtext and meaning.

Some showed her single-handedly organizing a cluttered, neglected space, transforming chaos into a minimalist sanctuary.

Others featured her gardening, hands deep in soil, planting organic vegetables.

There were videos of her visiting impoverished rural communities, working alongside local women harvesting crops.

She performed every task herself.

Her clothing was simple, unassuming, often plain linen and cotton.

She appeared entirely without makeup, her face bare, projecting an image of genuine, girl-next-door innocence.

Within a month, her follower count skyrocketed to seventy million.

'My Fairy Victoria' became the top trending hashtag. Her account exploded in popularity.

Comments flooded every post.

[I can't believe this is Victoria Kensington! She seems so humble and genuine!]

[This is nothing like those other celebrities who stage everything for attention. She's actually doing real work with her own hands!]

[Look at her face, glistening with honest sweat. This feels completely authentic. There's no way this is faked.]

[She's only doing this because her scandal ruined her career! This is just a calculated PR move to rebrand herself!]

[Oh, shut up. If you think it's so easy to fake, why don't you go try it for a month straight?]

[She's clearly remorseful. Why keep attacking her? Does destroying her life bring you joy?]

The court of public opinion had shifted.

Skeptics were quickly drowned out by a wave of supportive defenders.

Victoria's public persona was successfully reborn. She had shed the skin of the manipulative socialite.

She was now the pristine, relatable, 'earth-goddess' fairy.

Time accelerated, bringing them to the eve of the grand ceremony.

Eleanor Kensington personally went to collect Victoria from her retreat.

They also summoned Isabella Montgomery back to the family manor to finalize wedding arrangements.

Alexander Whitmore had been Isabella's designated chauffeur for weeks.

She always returned to Rosewood Manor each night, carefully concealing her cohabitation with Nathaniel Blackwood.

Alexander watched her in the rearview mirror.

Despite their increased proximity this past month, she never sat in the passenger seat.

She never initiated physical contact. Not even a casual brush of hands.

A simmering frustration gnawed at him.

"Tomorrow is the wedding," he finally said, breaking the tense silence. "The entire elite of high society will be watching. Are you absolutely certain you're prepared?"

Isabella gave a noncommittal hum from the back seat, her eyes closed.

He detested her cold, detached demeanor.

She was the one who had begged for this marriage. She had demanded a spectacular, public wedding.

She had no right to act so aloof and superior around him.

He swallowed his irritation. Just one more day.

Tomorrow night, she would be his. She would be pleading beneath him. She would learn her place.

The car arrived at the grand Montgomery Manor.

Alexander exited and moved to open her door, extending his hand in a performative gesture of chivalry. He needed to maintain appearances in front of her family.

Isabella hesitated briefly.

Then her gaze caught a familiar silhouette through the living room window.

A subtle, knowing smile touched her lips.

She accepted his arm, looping hers through his in a formal, detached manner, the kind seen at galas between business partners. It conveyed zero affection.

Yet, it was enough.

Inside the opulent living room, Victoria held court.

She was the center of a concerned family huddle.

"Victoria, my dear, you promised you would take care of yourself," Eleanor fretted, her voice thick with maternal worry. "Look at these calluses on your hands! And that faint scar on your cheek! You are a Montgomery heiress! How could you subject yourself to such hardship?"

Richard Montgomery's face was a mask of paternal anguish. "We have cherished you since the day you came to us. I've always handled you like the most precious porcelain. The thought of you alone in some remote village, doing manual labor... it breaks my heart. Did you even consider how this would make your mother and I feel?"
###Chapter 202

Victoria kept her head bowed low.

"I'm so sorry, Father, Mother, Grandfather, and everyone I love."

"I deeply regret causing you all such worry."

"My only intention was to atone. To seek redemption."

"You don't need to go to such extremes to repent," Eleanor murmured while applying ointment to the scar. "Everyone makes mistakes. I forgave you long ago."

A collective sigh filled the room.

Everyone admired Victoria's actions, including Theodore Montgomery, who seemed genuinely pleased to have her home. Among all the family members, Victoria was the only one who had chosen to live humbly in a remote, rural area. Her actions had garnered widespread respect and admiration, even causing the family's stock shares to rise.

Victoria basked in the greetings and concern from everyone, feeling deeply satisfied.

Then the maid announced, "Ms. Kensington, Mr. Whitmore is here."

All eyes turned to see Alexander and Isabella entering side by side. Isabella's arm was linked with Alexander's, and he held her hand with a gentle firmness. They were a stunning power couple, seemingly made for each other. Their brilliance outshone even the glimmering stars in the night sky.

Victoria's eye twitched violently. A sharp pang of jealousy and anger stabbed through her heart.

Isabella and Alexander were so close, so sweet with each other! Alexander was even holding her hand!

Although Alexander had cheated with her, he had never been publicly seen with another woman. He had always maintained a well-behaved image over the years. Why was he so intimate with Isabella now?!

As the couple stepped into the living room, Isabella secretly glanced at Victoria and flashed a smirk only she could see. In pain? Suffering?

Hah. Served her right!

Isabella then looked at Victoria with an inquisitive gaze. "Victoria, when did you return? You should have told us earlier. Alex and I would have picked you up."

Alex? She called him Alex?!

Alexander jolted slightly, caught off guard by the strange sensation that nickname evoked.

This drove Victoria insane. He was still her man. Hers! Isabella was blatantly showing off in front of her. No matter how much it hurt, Victoria couldn't show it. She had to suppress her emotions.

Fortunately, Eleanor changed the subject. "Isabella, Victoria went to the countryside because of you. She didn't want to come back. She only returned when I told her about your wedding tomorrow. Please tell her you forgive her. Ask her never to go back to such a place again."

Eleanor's heart ached terribly whenever she thought of poor Victoria in that run-down area.

Isabella gave Victoria a thorough once-over. Victoria had actually gotten prettier in just a month. Her skin was fair and flawless like porcelain. Did she look like she had endured any hardship at all? Only someone as gullible as Eleanor would believe her!

Isabella chose to keep that observation to herself. Instead, she replied, "I let it go a long time ago. Actually, I'm even grateful you returned Alex to me. To show my gratitude, I'd like to ask you to be my bridesmaid."

Bridesmaid? Was Isabella seriously asking Victoria to be her bridesmaid?

Tomorrow's ceremony would be filled with important figures. Rumor had it even the Blackwood men might show up, along with hundreds of paparazzi! If she could be the bridesmaid, she would gain immense attention and popularity!

Why would Isabella be so nice to her?

Victoria looked at her suspiciously. "Isabella, are you sure? You're not angry with me anymore? You truly want me as your bridesmaid?"

"Of course! I even have a gown prepared for you as the bridesmaid!" Isabella chirped, making a gesture.

Her assistant, Evelyn—arranged by Nathaniel—entered carrying a box. She presented it to Victoria.

Victoria accepted the box. A slight frown appeared on her face as she peered inside.
###Chapter 203

Inside the box lay a bridesmaid dress, custom-tailored just for her.

It was a strapless silk gown, the fabric so delicate it seemed to float on air. Yet it was crafted in a pale coffee-brown shade—Victoria’s least favorite color.

This particular tone of brown had a way of casting a sallow, sickly pallor over the skin. Anyone wearing it would look washed out and utterly common.

Victoria understood now why Isabella had been unusually kind. She intended to dress her bridesmaid in something hideous. Still, how could Victoria pass up a chance to land on the front page?

She put on a show of gratitude, eyes glistening. “Thank you, Isabella! You’re so thoughtful. I’ll be your bridesmaid tomorrow and give you my full blessing.”

“Hmph. If that’s all, I’ll see you at The Ritz-Carlton. Nine sharp,” Isabella replied.

Eleanor had asked Isabella to come to the Montgomery manor so she could tell Victoria she was forgiven. That way, Victoria would never return to those dark places. Hearing Isabella’s agreement pleased Eleanor greatly.

“You sisters should always support each other like this,” Eleanor said warmly. “It keeps the gossip at bay.”

“Oh, and Isabella—since so many entertainment industry elites will be at your wedding, remember to introduce them to your sister.”

Victoria’s career had been struggling lately. Without Gabriella to secure roles, many opportunities were snatched by others. Even though her Instagram following was growing, she was far from her former glory.

Isabella’s lips curved slightly. “Don’t worry. I’ll make sure to help Victoria tomorrow.”

Her words carried a double meaning no one caught. Though Victoria sensed something odd, she brushed it off. She would stay alert during the ceremony. Isabella wouldn’t dare try anything obvious.

Besides, even if Isabella didn’t help her, she could seize opportunities on her own. The Blackwood men were drawn to Isabella—perhaps they could be drawn to her instead…

Each of them was lost in their own schemes.

The wedding day arrived amid great anticipation. The Ritz-Carlton was packed with guests even early in the morning. Security teams maintained order while reporters weaved through the crowd, filming and live-streaming.

The hotel lobby was transformed into an enchanted forest dreamscape. Flower arches lined the path. Lush greenery and white jasmine blooms created an ethereal, breathtaking scene.

It wasn’t Isabella’s preferred style—it was Victoria’s favorite.

Victoria had imagined her own wedding to Alexander countless times. It always included jasmine flowers, a towering champagne fountain, an exquisite wedding cake…

She never dreamed she’d see it come to life at Isabella and Alexander’s wedding. When she arrived with Eleanor and the others at the hotel entrance, she was stunned. A red carpet ran beneath nine jasmine arches stretching all the way to the doors. The setting was opulent and gorgeous.

Envy clawed at her, threatening to drive her mad. Paparazzi swarmed around them, hurling questions.

“Mr. Montgomery, is this sudden wedding between Isabella and Alexander a business arrangement?”

“Ms. Victoria Kensington, you were with Alexander for five years. How do you feel today?”

Though such questions were asked, the reporters Victoria had pre-arranged quickly shifted the focus.

“Ms. Victoria, is it true you traveled to the Cotswolds Countryside to aid the villagers?”

“Based on your posts, are you atoning for what Gabriella did?”

“Did you expect to gain seventy million followers in just a month?”

“Your fans have nicknamed you the ‘Country Angel.’ What are your thoughts?”

All attention was on Victoria, as if she were the star of the show.
###Chapter 204

Flashing cameras surrounded Victoria. She basked in the attention she had always craved.

With practiced grace, she addressed the eager reporters. “Everything in those videos is completely authentic. If you require further proof, please observe these marks on my hands.”

She extended her palms toward the lenses, displaying the fresh blisters. “We’ve all made mistakes we regret. My manager, myself… everyone. I chose to live in the countryside to reconnect with a simpler existence. I sought spiritual purification. My goal is to atone and eventually assist others in need.”

“The number of followers on my new account is irrelevant to me. My only desire is for my sister’s forgiveness. I hope my supporters can find it in their hearts to forgive me as well. Moving forward, I am committed to working diligently. I strive to become someone worthy of admiration.”

Her delivery was poised and polished. Several paparazzi were broadcasting live. Viewers flooded the streams with comments praising her vulnerability.

No one could deny Victoria’s deceptively innocent appearance. Her eyes shone with a clear, spring-water purity, completely devoid of guile. That kind of facade effortlessly manipulated public perception. It made people forget every terrible thing she had ever done.

Eleanor watched, immensely pleased with her daughter’s performance. She took Victoria’s arm, guiding her toward the hotel entrance.

A reporter suddenly broke through the crowd. “Ms. Kensington! A moment, please! I’m with Stellar News. The public is desperate to know… how do you truly feel about this wedding? After a five-year relationship with Alexander, you’re attending as a bridesmaid. Can you share your feelings? Ten million fans are waiting for your answer!” His tone was pleading, making a refusal seem cruel.

Eleanor tightened her grip, attempting to pull Victoria away, concerned the question was too painful.

Victoria stopped. She turned back with a gracious smile. “Thank you for your concern. The truth is, my sister, Isabella, and Alexander were promised to each other since childhood. They were only separated because she left for treatment. My role these past five years was simply to look after him in her stead. They are destined for each other. My blessings for them are genuine and heartfelt.”

She offered a polite nod before quickly moving inside. The crowd was left in awe of her apparent selflessness. Attending an ex-lover’s wedding and offering sincere blessings was portrayed as a monumental act of grace.

Online, whether through calculated PR or genuine public reaction, trending topics exploded.

#StandInSupermodel
#VictoriasFiveYearSacrifice
#SmilingThroughThePain

Countless articles painted her as a selfless, innocent girl who devoted five years to a man, knowing she was just a placeholder. On his wedding day, she could only watch and smile through her heartbreak. The narrative was expertly crafted to manipulate young, impressionable audiences.

[This shatters my heart. My angel went to the countryside to heal her soul and her broken heart.]

[She gave him five years of her life, and when the real one returned, she was just cast aside. How tragic.]

[If my ex got married, I’d be a mess. Attending with a smile? That’s strength I don’t have.]

Inside the bridal suite, Evelyn handed a phone to Isabella. Her voice was flat. “These trending topics are clearly bought by Victoria’s team. Should we have them removed?”

Isabella glanced at the screen. A cold smirk touched her lips. “No.”

This was precisely what she wanted. Let Victoria climb higher. The greater the height, the more devastating the fall. She would ensure Victoria experienced the crushing plunge from heaven to hell once more. This time, she would make certain Victoria never got back up.
###Chapter 205

Evelyn was the assistant Nathaniel had personally selected for Isabella.
She was efficient, discreet, and exceptionally capable.
Yet even someone as composed as Evelyn couldn’t comprehend Nathaniel’s fascination with Isabella.

When Isabella declined further assistance, Evelyn didn’t press.
She simply nodded and withdrew to attend to other preparations.

Victoria entered the dressing room just as the hairstylists were putting the final touches on Isabella’s updo.
Isabella sat gracefully before the vanity, her gown flowing around her like liquid moonlight.
The dress featured delicate lantern sleeves and an elaborate train that shimmered under the lights.
She resembled Snow White brought to life—ethereal and utterly captivating.

This particular gown was from the coveted “Sun-Snow Anniversary Collection” by a legendary designer.
It was Victoria’s dream wedding dress.
She had once told Alexander she would wear nothing else on their wedding day.
Yet here was Isabella, draped in that very creation.
And the wedding itself?
Rumor had it Alexander spent over a billion to make it perfect.
For her.
How could he be so blind to Victoria’s feelings?

Isabella noticed Victoria’s arrival and dismissed the stylists with a wave.
“That will be all,” she said smoothly.
Once they were alone, Isabella turned, a faint smirk playing on her lips.
“Well? Do you think Alexander will approve?”

Victoria’s fists clenched.
Of course he would.
Isabella was radiant.
Her skin glowed.
Her presence commanded attention.
Most women would feel a pang of envy just looking at her.
That kind of beauty didn’t just captivate men—it enslaved them.

In stark contrast, Victoria’s bridesmaid dress was bland and forgettable.
It made her feel invisible.
She bit her tongue, struggling to keep her composure.

Isabelle rose and glided toward her, each step deliberate.
“You’re jealous. As you should be. I told you I would reclaim everything that was mine. The shares. My parents’ affection. Even Alexander.”

She stopped just inches from Victoria.
“You and Alexander still think you can take what’s mine, don’t you? Did you really believe he would destroy me and then marry you?”
A soft, icy laugh escaped her.
“How naïve.”

“If Alexander abandons you,” Isabella continued, her voice dropping to a whisper, “he becomes the husband of the Diamond Boss. He gains power, prestige, luxury beyond imagination. But if he chooses you? He’d have to kill me to get my fortune. Do you honestly think he would risk that for you? A mere adopted daughter with only a ten percent stake?”

Victoria paled.
Isabella’s words struck like a physical blow.
She had always been so sure of Alexander’s loyalty when Isabella was plain and powerless.
But this new Isabella—wealthy, stunning, formidable—changed everything.
Lately, Alexander had been distant, less passionate.
He was a pragmatic man.
Would he really gamble everything for her?

Isabella placed a hand on Victoria’s shoulder, her touch cold and condescending.
“Watch closely, Victoria. Watch how he looks at me. How he desires me. I will make him mine—heart, mind, and soul.”

With that, Isabella swept past her and pulled open the heavy oak door.
As she stepped into the hallway, she nearly collided with Alexander himself.

He had been coming to check on the preparations.
The sight of her stopped him dead.
His usually stern eyes widened in awe.
She looked like royalty—elegant, majestic, utterly breathtaking.

His heart hammered against his ribs.
He had never seen anyone so devastatingly beautiful.
It took him a moment to find his voice.
“Is everything ready? The ceremony begins in an hour.”
His tone was softer than he intended, almost tender.

Isabella offered a faint smile, then frowned delicately.
“The shoes are a bit loose. I nearly tripped earlier.”
She lifted the hem of her gown to reveal a pair of exquisite lace heels.
Despite her height, her feet were surprisingly small—elegant and delicate.
###Chapter 206

The lace was definitely coming undone. It might slip off entirely if she took another step. When Alexander noticed the loose lace, he instinctively dropped to one knee to secure it. Isabella glanced sideways at Victoria, a mocking smirk playing on her lips. It was a deliberate provocation.

Victoria recoiled as if struck. A wave of raw jealousy and pain washed over her, impossible to suppress. She had seen the way Alexander looked at Isabella. She had witnessed the gentleness in his touch. And now… he was kneeling to tie her shoe!

This was not the Alexander she remembered. Not the man who had once loved her and only her. He hadn't even glanced at her in her bridesmaid dress today.

Alexander remained oblivious. After tightening the lace, he stood. "Your gown is too long. It's a tripping hazard. Be careful today. There are many important guests. We can't afford any mistakes."

"Don't worry about me," Isabella said, gathering the train of her dress. She descended the stairs with an elegant grace. Even her silhouette was mesmerizingly beautiful and utterly stunning.

Alexander's mind was a whirlwind of conflicting thoughts. Was this incredible woman really his wife? She wasn't the disgusting creature he remembered. Against his will, he found himself accepting her presence.

What if they could become a real husband and wife…?

A cold smirk touched Isabella's lips as she felt his gaze follow her.

"Alexander, Victoria… just wait. Your reputations will be utterly destroyed today."

Down in the grand hotel ballroom, the elite guests mingled. Champagne flutes glittered in their hands. The air was thick with the scent of luxury and whispered conversations.

"The Blackwoods are here!" a voice suddenly cut through the murmur.

"What? The Blackwoods? You mean Sebastian Blackwood?"

Sebastian was known to be more sociable. He occasionally attended high-profile functions.

"Not just Sebastian!" another voice clarified, buzzing with excitement. "Sebastian is here, but he's not alone! Another Blackwood is with him!"

"Another? Don't tell me it's Nathaniel Blackwood?"

"Yes! Him! They're at the entrance right now! I saw them with my own eyes!"

"My God! Is that even possible? Nathaniel Blackwood never attends events. He barely shows his face at his own family's parties!"

"I heard he only appears at international summits. And only with other globally renowned figures! He would never come to a wedding!"

"Well, he's here! Look for yourself!"

Every head turned toward the hotel's grand entrance. Under the ornate archway, three figures strode forward on the red carpet. They exuded an aura of innate coldness and supreme nobility, especially Nathaniel. Though he walked behind Sebastian and held little Oliver's hand, he radiated a regal prominence that made the lavish hotel seem dull in comparison.

Sebastian, who usually commanded respect, seemed like a mere backdrop next to Nathaniel. The crowd was awestruck. The heiresses of every wealthy family present flushed, their hearts pounding, breath caught in their throats.

Nathaniel simply walked. His gaze swept over the surrounding people as if they were insignificant specks of dust, utterly beneath his notice. As he entered the opulent lobby, his sharp eyes immediately locked onto a figure standing near a staircase not far away.
###Chapter 207

Isabella descended the marble staircase, her wedding gown flowing behind her like liquid moonlight.

Her breath caught in her throat.

Nathaniel Blackwood stood in the grand lobby, commanding the space with his mere presence.

He wore a tailored suit more formal than his usual attire, the dark fabric accentuating his powerful frame.

Her heart hammered against her ribs.

Why was he here? If anyone discovered their connection...

His gaze lifted, meeting hers across the room.

For a moment, time stilled. She looked every inch the royal bride poised on that curved staircase.

Elegant. Breathtaking.

The fitted bodice of her dress emphasized her slender waist, and his fingers twitched with the urge to pull her close.

But Nathaniel was a master of control.

He glanced away, his expression unreadable, and continued forward with lethal grace.

The Montgomery and Whitmore families surged to their feet, their voices overlapping in eager welcome.

"Mr. Blackwood! What an honor."

"We would have prepared a more suitable venue had we known you were coming."

"The private lounge is this way, sir. Much quieter."

"May we offer you a drink? Coffee? Tea?"

They tripped over themselves, anxious to please.

Nathaniel's voice was a low, enigmatic rumble. "No need. I've collaborated with Ms. Montgomery before. I'm merely here to offer my congratulations."

Sebastian stepped forward, presenting an exquisitely wrapped box. "A gift for the happy couple from the Blackwood family. May they treat each other with the utmost sincerity and respect."

Sincerity and respect? An unusual blessing for a wedding.

Confusion flickered through the crowd, but no one dared question a word from Nathaniel's representative.

Madam Whitmore accepted the gift, her face flushed with delight. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood! Thank you! Please, right this way."

She gestured toward a secluded area sectioned off by an ornate silk screen.

Nathaniel moved, his hand resting on Oliver's small shoulder. The boy's eyes had instantly found Isabella on the stairs, his little body tensing to run to her.

A subtle squeeze from Nathaniel stopped him. He scooped the boy into his arms, settling him on his lap. A single, stern look communicated the plan, and Oliver stilled, obedient.

As they took their seats, a hushed murmur swept through the guests. All attention was riveted on Nathaniel.

Paparazzi lenses itched to capture him, but every professional knew the unbreakable rule: no published photos of Nathaniel Blackwood. They could only watch, frustrated.

A collective gasp echoed through the hall.

All heads turned.

Isabella was completing her descent, a vision in white. Every step was measured, regal. A subtle, practiced smile graced her lips.

The train of her gown flowed behind her like a river of pearls. She was both princess and queen.

The crowd was mesmerized.

The paparazzi snapped back to reality first. Their cameras erupted in a frenzy of flashing lights, devouring the image of the world's wealthiest bride.

Since Nathaniel was off-limits, she was the prize.

They swarmed her, microphones thrust forward.

"Ms. Montgomery! What prompted your marriage to Alexander Whitmore so soon after your return?"

"You're at the pinnacle of your career. Won't this union hinder your professional trajectory?"

"How do you intend to balance your corporate responsibilities with your new duties as a wife?"

Isabella had rehearsed her answers, but a searing intensity from behind the silk screen pierced her composure.

That familiar gaze unraveled her.

She took a steadying breath, forcing a serene mask. "My feelings for Alexander are genuine. I am prepared to step back from my career to focus on being a devoted wife," she stated, her voice clear. "And, in time, a dedicated mother."

A wave of shock rippled through the audience.

Step back? The formidable Isabella Montgomery? The indomitable CEO?

Abandon her empire to become a... housewife?

For Alexander Whitmore?
###Chapter 208

This was utterly absurd! Her decision felt completely…

Producers, directors, and brand sponsors encircled Isabella Montgomery, their faces etched with disbelief.

“Ms. Montgomery, this must be a joke, right? You’ll have plenty of time after getting married! Why leave the industry entirely?”

“I was just about to offer you the cover for our next seasonal magazine!”

“My upcoming historical drama needs a lead actress with your exact talent and presence! It would be a tremendous loss if you retired.”

A collective sigh of disappointment rippled through the group.

Isabella held her ground, a soft smile gracing her lips. “A woman is foolish if she isn’t willing to make sacrifices for the man she loves.”

Her voice was calm, gentle. Dressed in her wedding gown, she radiated the image of the perfect devoted wife and future mother. The crowd envied the depth of her love for Alexander. The live stream chat exploded with emotional fans.

(Ah!!!! This is what real LOVE looks like! I finally believe in true love!)

[I never knew Ms. Montgomery could be so tender! It's incredible!]

[She's giving up her phenomenal career for Alexander! This is it, real love!]

[Alexander better treat her right. We're watching you!]

As heartfelt blessings poured in for the couple, Nathaniel Blackwood’s expression darkened backstage. He knew it was all an act. Yet, watching her in a wedding gown for another man, speaking with such soft affection, ignited a frozen, furious storm within him.

His chilling demeanor made Sebastian shiver. “Nathaniel, get a grip,” he whispered urgently. “You’re being too obvious! If it hurts this much, go out there! Fight for her! You kept hinting something big would happen, but if you just stand here waiting, your future wife will be gone!”

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed dangerously. His future wife, gone?

He couldn’t just stand by.

Meanwhile, Margaret Whitmore and Eleanor Kensington moved to stand beside Isabella. Margaret genuinely liked Isabella; her presence had drawn Nathaniel to the wedding. Isabella brought immense prestige to the Whitmore name, enough to last a decade! Plus, she owned a diamond mine, a fortune that would skyrocket the Whitmore wealth.

She took Isabella’s hand and addressed the crowd. “Please, don’t make things difficult for my daughter-in-law. It’s not as if she needs the money. I’m looking forward to holding my grandchildren!”

“And to all the producers and directors here,” Eleanor seized the moment to shift attention to Victoria. “Please consider our Victoria. She’s exceptionally skilled in acting and modeling. For the record, Isabella learned a great deal from her.” With Isabella seemingly settled and Victoria struggling, Eleanor wanted to help her daughter regain footing.

Mention of Victoria redirected the crowd’s praise.

“That’s true. Victoria is also remarkable! Her five-year modeling career sets a superb example.”

“I heard she’s been creating short video content lately. She’s truly riding the new wave, a pioneer with unique vision.”

“Most importantly, Victoria’s eyes possess a rare purity. They radiate innocence and kindness, a truly harmless quality. She’d be perfect for a youth idol drama.”

“Speaking of Victoria, where is she? I haven’t seen her today. I have some projects I’d like to discuss with her.”

The admiring guests glanced around, searching for Victoria.

Eleanor scanned the room but couldn’t spot her daughter either. She turned back to the crowd. “She’s the maid of honor today, so she’s probably busy handling some details. That girl… always so thoughtful, treating Isabella like a real sister, wanting only the best for her.”

This reminded everyone of the online buzz, deepening their admiration for Victoria. It couldn’t be easy, willingly serving as maid of honor for her ex-lover and rival. Victoria was truly a good soul.

Click!

Suddenly, the main lobby screen flickered to life. The speakers crackled, then emitted the unmistakable sound of someone moaning.

The noise!
###Chapter 209

All eyes were locked on the massive display screen.

The live feed showed the wedding suite prepared by The Ritz-Carlton.

Two figures were entangled on the crimson satin sheets.

Victoria Kensington and Alexander Whitmore were engaged in an unspeakable act.

A collective gasp swept through the grand hall.

Eyes widened in disbelief at the scandalous scene.

“Victoria is sleeping with Alexander!”

“Good heavens! She’s utterly shameless in bed!”

“Did she just say that? She wants Alexander to marry Isabella to seize her fortune?”

“This is beyond shocking! Victoria is betraying her own sister!”

“She publicly blesses the marriage while privately seducing the groom!”

“What a vile woman! She grows more despicable each time!”

“Everyone, take a good look at your ‘Innocent Village Girl’! See her true colors!”

The crowd erupted in furious whispers.

The live feed continued unabated.

Both remained completely unaware, lost in their passionate throes.

Though unsatisfied with his response, Victoria cooperated fully.

A sinister smirk played on her lips.

Her lust-filled eyes gleamed with pride and malice.

‘Dear, dear Isabella. So what if he claims to love you? Your husband is in my bed now!’

Her expression was so venomous it chilled the onlookers.

Paparazzi feverishly aimed their cameras at the screen, broadcasting everything live.

Eleanor Kensington finally snapped out of her shock.

“Shut it down!” she screamed. “Stop this immediately! Cut the feed!”

Members of the Montgomery and Whitmore families scrambled into action.

Isabella Montgomery stood alone in her wedding gown.

She watched the screen with cold satisfaction.

This was the scene the world should have witnessed five years ago.

Their betrayal had cost her everything.

Forced to flee to Africa, losing her unborn child.

This wedding would be their ultimate downfall.

Victoria and Alexander’s reputations were shattered beyond repair.

They would never recover from this public humiliation.

Though inwardly triumphant, Isabella wore a mask of devastation.

She stood frozen, face pale, eyes wide with horror.

The Montgomerys and Whitmores were too busy containing the chaos.

They tried calming guests and silencing the paparazzi.

Eleanor rushed upstairs, leaving Isabella isolated.

Only one pair of eyes watched her from behind a private screen.

Nathaniel Blackwood knew this was her performance.

Yet seeing her alone, subjected to public scorn, made his chest tighten.

A sharp, unexpected pain pierced through him.

He hesitated, then rose to approach her.

Oliver Blackwood quickly grabbed his arm. “Daddy, you can’t!”

“Mommy warned me again this morning. You must not interfere today!”

Nathaniel frowned. Had Isabella anticipated his intervention?

Sebastian Blackwood chuckled beside him. “I didn’t expect the ‘show’ to be this riveting!”

“This will give the press enough material for a decade! Don’t worry, brother. I suspect there’s more to come.”

His tone was laced with anticipation.

Right on cue, Margaret Whitmore rushed toward Isabella to offer comfort.
###Chapter 210

“Isabella, please. Stay calm. I will fix this for you. That boy will be severely punished. He will apologize to you publicly!”

“This is all Victoria’s doing. You must give our Alexander a chance!”

Isabella was destined to become her daughter-in-law. That brilliant diamond mind was nearly the Whitmore family’s asset. Margaret Whitmore couldn't let it slip away. Her priority was soothing Isabella.

Isabella remained motionless, her eyes fixed on the now-black screen.

'Why did it cut off so quickly? Damn it! I should have programmed the Trojan to stream for a full hour!'

Margaret misread her fixation as profound hurt. “Isabella, you and Alexander grew up together. You know his heart belongs to you. Things were going so well between you lately! Don’t be too upset. Men have their weaknesses. I will watch him closely for you from now on,” she coaxed, gently reaching for Isabella’s hand.

“Hmph!” Isabella snatched her hand away with a cold scoff. Without a word, she tore the veil from her head. The necklace followed, clattering to the floor. Then the delicate lace gloves. Every accessory was violently discarded.

Each item was flung down with contempt. She stripped herself of everything but the wedding gown itself. Finally, she snarled, “I was ready to abandon my career for him. And this is his repayment? Compromise is not in my vocabulary. Not for Isabella Montgomery. The. Wedding. Is. Off.”

Her words were sharp, final. She shoved the engagement ring into Margaret’s palm. Holding her gown, she stormed away. Tears glistened in her eyes, yet her stride was fierce and unyielding. She perfectly embodied the betrayed woman reclaiming her power.

Her team watching—Maxwell, Julian, Harrison—silently applauded her masterful performance.

The guests in the lobby and the live-stream audience erupted in praise and respect.

“Yes! That’s the way!”
“Boss Montgomery is incredible! She made the right choice!”
“Alexander is scum! Stay away from trash like him!”
“Victoria is a vile, disgusting slut!”

The elders from the Montgomery and Whitmore families looked ready to collapse from fury and shame.

As Isabella neared the exit, Penelope rushed down the stairs and grabbed her arm. “Ms. Montgomery, wait! Please, come with me!” She urgently pulled Isabella toward the staircase.

Paparazzi trying to follow were immediately blocked by family bodyguards. Behind the screens, Nathaniel stood, Oliver in his arms. They headed for the private VIP elevator.

On the second floor of The Ritz-Carlton…

Victoria knelt on the floor, tears streaming relentlessly down her face. Alexander knelt beside her. His father, Victor Whitmore, raged before them, his anger white-hot.

Eleanor, Richard, and Benjamin Kensington were also present. They stared, hearts broken, expressions复杂. Disbelief was etched on their faces.

Victoria was their beloved, their favorite. Especially Eleanor. She never imagined Victoria capable of such indecency. During the earlier interview, Eleanor truly believed in Victoria's kindness and generosity. This revelation was a devastating blow. Eleanor had only wanted to help Victoria recover financially, even hoping to introduce her to Sebastian Blackwood!

She never dreamed Victoria would entangle herself with Alexander behind their backs. Let alone sleep with him.
###Chapter 211

The memory of Victoria’s betrayal burned in Isabella’s mind.

She clutched Victoria’s sleeves, her heart twisting in agony.

She shook her fiercely. “Why, Victoria? Why would you do this? When did you become this kind of person? Do you realize you’re destroying your own life? How could you betray me like this?”

Victoria stood frozen, completely stunned.

She felt helpless and terrified, her mind going blank.

One moment she was lost in passion with Alexander.

The next, a crowd burst into the room.

Isabella had slapped her without warning.

It wasn’t until she heard the shouting that she understood.

Everything that happened had been live-streamed.

It was over. Victoria was finished.

The whole world now knew she slept with Alexander.

Their private conversations were broadcast for all to hear.

What could she do now? How could she possibly fix this?

Nearby, Penelope was heard sobbing. “Isabella, I’m begging you. Please forgive Victoria. She’s going to be torn apart by the public! You’re the only one who can help her now!”

All eyes turned to Isabella standing calmly by the door.

She had removed all her wedding accessories.

Her hair fell loose and wild around her shoulders.

She looked beautifully disheveled, like a storm.

Victoria’s eyes widened in realization.

Isabella… Isabella was here!

This had to be her doing. It was all her plan.

She made her the bridesmaid on purpose.

She designed the wedding in Victoria’s favorite theme.

She said those triggering words to push her toward Alexander.

Victoria never intended to seek him out.

But Isabella’s sharp words broke her control.

Victoria scrambled to her feet, pointing accusingly. “Isabella! How could you do this to me? You’re pure evil!”

“Evil?” Isabella let out a cold laugh. “You’re calling me evil after what you’ve done? Victoria Kensington, if you wanted my diamond mine so badly, you could have just asked. I would have given it to you. Why ruin my wedding day? Do you know how long I’ve planned for this?”

“I canceled all my projects. I lost millions in endorsements. All I wanted was to marry Alexander and live a simple life. Why did you have to destroy everything?”

Isabella’s voice trembled with raw pain and fury.

Victoria shook her head violently. “No! You planned this from the start! It’s all a lie! You never loved Alexander! You set up those cameras! You designed this trap to ruin me! You—”

Before she could finish, Eleanor’s hand struck her cheek again.

Victoria stumbled backward, her face stinging.

Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.

She touched her lip, staring at Eleanor in disbelief. “Mother… you hit me? Again?”

Eleanor had never raised a hand to her before today.

Now she had been slapped twice.

“How can you show no remorse after such a shameful act?” Eleanor cried out. “How can you still blame Isabella? What happened to the daughter I raised?”

The woman before her felt like a stranger.

“All of you blame me,” Victoria rasped, her voice breaking. “But I never wanted this to happen!”

“It was Isabella! She set everything up! She planted cameras in this room! She never intended to marry Alexander! This whole wedding was a trap! I’m telling the truth!”

Isabella’s gaze turned icy. “It’s easy to check who installed the cameras. But even if I did, did I force you into bed with Alexander? Did I tell you to plot against me and steal what’s mine?”

“Y-You…!” Victoria stammered, turning desperately toward Alexander who knelt nearby.
###Chapter 212

“Alexander, speak! Think carefully. In the past month, did Isabella ever truly love you? Was her intention to marry you even real?”

All eyes focused on Alexander.

Kneeling, Alexander felt utterly humiliated and defeated. The moment he saw Isabella in her wedding dress, an absurd thought crossed his mind—he genuinely wanted to spend the rest of his life with her, to make her his real wife! Then Victoria showed up. He couldn't control his urges. Everything spiraled when Victoria hugged and kissed him. She kept professing her love, her pain.

“Just one more time. You’ll be married for at least a month after this. I won’t disturb you until then,” she had whispered.

He fell for it. He genuinely pitied her, wanted to comfort her. This one mistake ruined everything—his wedding, their reputations. What could he say now? What was left?

Alexander had never knelt before. Yet there he was, on the floor, punched by his father Victor. Publicly shamed in front of everyone. Including Isabella.

Seeing his silence, Margaret rushed forward and slapped him. “What are you doing? Speak! Apologize to Isabella! Beg for her forgiveness!”

“No need. Forgiveness doesn’t exist in my life. Not now, not ever. From this moment, I want nothing to do with them.” Isabella’s words were icy, final. She turned to leave. Her retreating figure was mesmerizing, yet cold and proud.

Realizing their ticket to wealth was walking away, Margaret shoved Alexander urgently. He instinctively stood, grabbing Isabella’s wrist. “Isabella, let me explain! What can I do to earn your forgiveness? Tell me. I’ll do anything to make this wedding happen. Anything.”

He spoke with desperate sincerity. Part of him truly didn’t want to let her go. He felt if he did, he’d never get her back. Also, it was better to pin the blame on Victoria. Their reputations were already tarnished. If Isabella forgave him, the public might move on. If she refused, they’d hate him, boycott him. He had to win her back, continue the ceremony.

Beside him, Victoria’s heart shattered. The man she loved was begging another woman right in front of her. He didn’t care about her feelings at all! She’d been slapped twice, yet he didn’t defend her. He didn’t want to confess their love. All he wanted was Isabella!

It drove her insane. She could no longer hold back. “Alexander, why are you begging her? Don’t you believe me either? Why would there be hidden cameras here? Why would she suddenly agree to marry you? It was all—”

“Enough!” Alexander cut her off furiously.

Lately, Isabella’s temper had softened. She’d given up many opportunities for him. So what if this was all Isabella’s plan? If Victoria hadn’t sought him out, hadn’t seduced him, why would he have done this on his wedding day? Victoria was useless. A constant disappointment. Alexander reached a conclusion. A final decision.
###Chapter 213

Alexander spun toward Victoria. “Apologize. Now. To Isabella.”

“Apologize? Alexander? Are you serious? You want me to apologize to her?” Victoria’s face drained of all color. She could fake remorse and play the victim on any other occasion. But not this one.

This was Isabella’s doing. These were clearly her traps, her schemes. And now she was supposed to apologize?

Alexander used to loathe Isabella just as much as she did. Why was he suddenly demanding this?

His gaze was unyielding. “Yes. When you make a mistake, you apologize. We shouldn’t be together. Let’s end it, right here, right now, in front of Isabella.”

This was the only way to salvage the wedding. The only way to control the damage.

He turned back to Isabella. “It’s true. Victoria and I made a terrible mistake. I am deeply sorry. If you’re concerned about your assets, we can sign a prenuptial agreement immediately.”

Madam Whitmore elbowed him sharply. “Don’t be a fool, Alexander! What are you saying? Isabella will forgive you once you’ve shown true remorse. We’re about to be family. Families don’t keep score like this. You’ll only make things more difficult. Isn’t that right, Isabella?” She offered Isabella a strained, hopeful smile.

Isabella’s expression remained cold. “Haven’t I been clear? I said I will never forgive you! I want nothing more to do with any of you. Ever!”

Victoria felt pure hatred burn through her. She wanted to lunge at Isabella and silence her forever. Alexander and his mother were already begging. Why was she still so arrogantly stubborn? Did she get off on torturing everyone? What more did she possibly want?

Flustered, Madam Whitmore turned to Eleanor. “Eleanor, please, talk some sense into your daughter. There’s no need to destroy our families’ bond over this. What good will it do? Think of the media frenzy. The headlines will be brutal.”

Eleanor and Richard Montgomery were seething. They couldn’t accept that their seemingly pure daughter was actually this deceitful and vile. Yet, they had to consider the bigger picture. If the wedding was truly called off, the fallout would be catastrophic. The family’s reputation was on the line.

Eleanor grasped Isabella’s hand, her voice pleading. “Isabella, your sister is absolutely at fault here. You can punish her any way you see fit. But there are too many reporters here today. Please, reconsider. Take back what you said.”

“You must understand you represent the entire Montgomery family,” Richard added sternly. He shot a disgusted glance at Victoria. “If the alliance with the Whitmores is broken, the consequences will be severe. And yes, Victoria made a colossal error. We will deal with her ourselves. You can oversee her punishment. But she is still family. If the world shames her, they shame all of us. Only your public forgiveness can limit the damage.”

Victoria listened in stunned disbelief. They weren’t concerned for her. They were worried about the stain she would leave on the family name. They were handing her over to Isabella for punishment. Isabella had already engineered her complete humiliation. Was she now to be Isabella’s plaything? To be tormented and degraded at her whim?

Victoria was utterly powerless.

Eleanor was now clutching Isabella’s arm, her desperation palpable. “Isabella, I’m begging you. Please. Remember I’m your mother. Remember I saved your life. Please, let this go. Let the wedding continue. Just tell everyone you forgive her. Please.”

Isabella was the last thread holding the Montgomerys and Whitmores together. Victoria was already a lost cause. If Isabella refused to forgive, the familial bond would shatter, incurring immense costs. Furthermore, without Isabella’s public declaration of forgiveness, Victoria would be torn apart by the court of public opinion. Her career would be over.

Eleanor was using the life debt as her final bargaining chip.

Isabella frowned, watching her mother debase herself for the sake of damage control. Correction: mostly for Victoria’s sake. Ultimately, even though Eleanor was heartbroken, it was because Victoria faced global scorn.

A stark contrast to five years ago, when Isabella was publicly vilified. Back then, Eleanor had remained completely silent.
###Chapter 214

Isabella remained silent as Theodore Montgomery stepped forward. “You must drop this, Isabella. For the good of the family. We can witness the prenup signing right now. Alexander will never dare to harm you again.”

He continued gravely, “Think about what happens if our alliance with the Whitmores collapses. If you ruin Alexander, the Whitmores will cut off our supply of their premium materials.”

The Whitmore family produced the finest construction materials in the industry. Prestige Builders, the Montgomery family's globally renowned development corporation, relied entirely on these superior supplies to maintain its reputation for excellence. Losing this partnership would be catastrophic. The Whitmores held all the power.

Isabella’s eyes narrowed. She was about to respond when…

“So this is how the Montgomerys and Whitmores handle their disputes. By blackmailing the victim.”

A cool, authoritative voice cut through the tension. Everyone turned. Nathaniel Blackwood stood in the hallway entrance. Impeccable in a custom-tailored suit, without a single crease. His polished shoes gleamed. He carried himself like royalty.

The crowd’s pulse quickened. He had heard everything.

Theodore moved quickly to explain. “You misunderstand, Mr. Blackwood. We are merely trying to avoid a public scandal.”

“Precisely,” Margaret Whitmore added, her tone placating. “As elders, we only want the best for our children. Isabella and Alexander have a long history together. We wish to see them happy.”

A small figure peeked out from behind Nathaniel. Oliver Blackwood’s wide, innocent eyes scanned the room. “But if it was your wedding day,” the boy asked, his voice clear and curious, “and your fiancé cheated with someone else, and tried to take all your money and maybe even hurt you… would you just let it go? Could you?”

His question hung in the air. It struck a chord, particularly with the women present. They glanced at their own partners, imagining the betrayal. The answer was a resounding no. They would never let it go. They would want vengeance.

Nathaniel’s voice was ice cold and definitive. “As an outside observer, I find this unacceptable. If the Whitmore family severs ties with the Montgomerys over this, the Blackwood Group will supply Prestige Builders with our materials. Indefinitely.”

A shockwave went through the room. Blackwood materials were legendary, reserved for international projects and elite clients. They had never supplied a local company. Was he openly taking Isabella’s side?

Alexander’s face darkened with fury. This was his wedding, his family’s business. Nathaniel had no right to interfere.

Theodore Montgomery slammed his cane on the floor. “Enough!” he declared, his voice ringing with finality. “This ends now. The wedding is canceled. No one will pressure Isabella further. The Whitmores will deal with Alexander’s discipline.”

He paused, his furious gaze landing on Victoria. “As for you… Pack your things. You are on a flight to Africa today. You will not return until this disgrace is forgotten.”

Africa?

Victoria paled, her face a mask of sheer horror. He was banishing her? To that distant, unforgiving continent?
###Chapter 215

“What’s next?” Senior Theodore scoffed. “You believe this is unfair? When Isabella made an error, she endured five years in Africa before returning. Your transgression today is far more severe than hers ever was!”

Back then, Alexander and Victoria had accused Isabella of infidelity, claiming she carried another man’s child. They alleged Alexander discovered the truth and accidentally pushed her down the stairs. Essentially, Isabella’s only fault was alleged unfaithfulness. But Victoria? She conspired with her almost brother-in-law and plotted to steal her sister’s inheritance!

This was utterly unforgivable!

Senior Theodore remembered the video evidence clearly. His voice turned icy. “Marcus Donovan, escort her out.”

Marcus Donovan was Senior Theodore’s most formidable bodyguard, a powerfully built man. He advanced toward Victoria immediately.

Panic seized Victoria. She understood the gravity now. Her reputation was destroyed. The Montgomery family despised her! Being banished to Africa would mean the end.

Desperate, she clutched Eleanor’s arm. “Mother, help me! I’ve learned my lesson! I won’t repeat this! I refuse to go to such a place! I can’t!”

Eleanor’s heart ached watching Victoria’s tears. But she was horrified by Victoria’s actions and true nature. Outwardly, Victoria supported Alexander and Isabella. Secretly, she seduced Alexander and schemed to seize Isabella’s assets!

She could no longer defend a daughter like this.

Tears welled in Eleanor’s eyes as she pulled her arm away. “Victoria, you must go to Africa. It’s for your own good. For everyone’s sake.”

Victoria trembled violently. Even Eleanor agreed to this exile? Her mistake was huge, but not this severe! Five years away would erase her standing in the Montgomery family. Worse, Isabella would find ways to eliminate her in Africa. Or steal everything she had left, leaving her a discarded orphan!

She gripped Eleanor’s hand tightly, wailing hysterically. “Mother, Father, Grandfather, I’ll apologize! I’ll stay away from Alexander forever! I made a terrible mistake, but don’t send me there! I’ll do anything you ask! Please, I beg you, don’t cast me out…! Waa…!”

Her voice was raw. She transformed into a pitiful, innocent young woman.

Gabriella once said her tears were her greatest weapon. If she could just stay in the city, she could find a way back! With that thought, she collapsed loudly onto the floor. Her limbs went limp as she sobbed wretchedly. “I’m just a fragile girl. I’ve never been apart from you all. I don’t want to leave… I’ll miss you so much…!” She wept again before adding, “I’m still so young. How will I survive there alone…? Waa…!”

Her ragged sobs tugged at many hearts. However furious Eleanor and Richard were, Victoria was still the daughter they raised from childhood. She was their favorite!

Unable to restrain herself, Eleanor turned to Senior Theodore. “Father, perhaps let Victoria stay? We can punish her here as we see fit. She truly is young and foolish…”

“Hah! Did any of you speak for Isabella when she erred? She was merely eighteen then! Was she not young? If Isabella survived Africa alone, can a twenty-three-year-old Victoria truly not manage?” Senior Theodore retorted furiously.

Oliver nodded in agreement. “Exactly! My father says noble families must uphold strict rules. This sort of person cannot be pardoned!”
###Chapter 216

Isabella arrived expecting to witness a spectacle, but Nathaniel’s sudden entrance with Christopher disrupted everything. Their bold statements risked exposing their hidden relationship to her family.

She shot a warning glance toward Oliver, but the boy feigned innocence perfectly. “Did I say something wrong?” he pressed, widening his eyes. “Why is no one taking action? Does the Montgomery family condone women like her?”

He paused dramatically, turning toward Nathaniel with feigned urgency. “Daddy, you must never work with these people! They’re defending someone so vile. Families like this can’t be trusted.”

His words sent a chill through the room, particularly unsettling the Whitmores. The Blackwoods' arrival had initially seemed like a promising opportunity, but now it threatened disaster. Would this scandal get them blacklisted?

Margaret Whitmore rushed forward, forcing a smile. “Young Master Blackwood has such a sharp sense of humor! Of course we don’t support her. We fully agree with the decision! Eleanor, Theodore, send Victoria to Africa immediately. She shouldn’t remain in the country any longer.”

Theodore Montgomery understood the gravity of the situation. Victoria’s reputation was irreparably damaged, and offending the Blackwoods was not an option.

He gestured grimly to his head of security. “Marcus, take her home and ensure she packs her belongings.”

“Yes, sir,” Marcus Donovan replied, stepping forward to forcibly remove Victoria.

Pale with rage, Victoria felt nothing but bitter hatred. This was all Isabella’s doing, yet everyone turned against her. Nathaniel’s interference had only made things worse.

A woman like Isabella didn’t deserve such protection. She didn’t deserve Nathaniel Blackwood!

Her fury finally erupted. “Isabella Montgomery! Everyone will learn the truth about what you did today! Karma will destroy you for framing me! I will never forgive you! Never!”

Her hysterical screams echoed through the hall, dripping with venom.

The guests were stunned. No one had expected the gentle Victoria to reveal such a vicious side. A few even wondered if Isabella might truly be at fault.

But Isabella remained unbothered. The evidence she held was more than enough to ruin Victoria completely. Her priority now was to leave, to put distance between herself and Nathaniel before their relationship was exposed.

She turned to Theodore. “Grandfather, I’ll leave the rest to you. I need to be alone.” Without another word, she walked away, her white gown flowing behind her. Her departure painted a tragic picture, and sympathetic sighs followed her exit.

Theodore glanced at Reginald, signaling him to approach. “Mr. Blackwood, thank you for supporting the Montgomerys today. If you have time, would you care to stay for tea?”

“My apologies,” Nathaniel declined smoothly. “I came to discuss an urgent business matter with Isabella. I must excuse myself.” Taking Christopher’s hand, he followed Isabella out.

Theodore watched them leave, his expression deeply contemplative.
###Chapter 217

Alexander’s vision turned crimson in that moment.

He was Isabella’s man.

Why was an outsider like Nathaniel pursuing her?

He rose to his feet, ready to chase after her.

Theodore Montgomery’s voice cut through the air like ice. “Stay where you are, Alexander! I forbid you from ever seeing my granddaughter again. If you disobey, I will never forgive you!”

Margaret Whitmore interjected sharply. “Theodore, what are you saying? We’ve already disciplined Alexander for his mistakes. He’s been beaten and scolded. Isn’t that sufficient?”

Theodore’s gaze was frigid. “If I demanded a Montgomery man sleep with two of your granddaughters, would you accept that? Do not take advantage of us and then cry for fairness!

“Our business partnership may continue, but my granddaughters will have no further contact with the Whitmore family!” His words were final and unyielding.

He turned and strode away without looking back.

Richard Montgomery and Eleanor Kensington followed closely behind him.

They had initially hoped to contain the scandal’s damage.

They wanted Isabella to proceed with the ceremony and marry Alexander.

But after Nathaniel Blackwood’s intervention, their fears vanished.

Alexander was the source of all this chaos.

He was first involved with Victoria.

Then he changed his mind and pursued Isabella.

When the Montgomery family finally agreed, he was caught in bed with Victoria on his wedding day!

He destroyed the reputations of two Montgomery women in one blow.

If not for the business ties between the families, William Kensington would have beaten Alexander senseless.

With the Montgomery family gone, the Whitmores were left to handle the messy aftermath.

“Damn it!” Margaret hissed under her breath. “What’s their problem? They’re just two women with ruined reputations anyway! Who cares!”

“Shut up!” Alexander snapped at her.

Victor Whitmore kicked his son hard. “You disgraceful boy! Now you’re talking back to your mother? If it weren’t for your actions today, we would be wealthy beyond measure! We wouldn’t be stuck here cleaning up this mess! I should have let your older brothers take over the business. I never should have entrusted it to you!”

Alexander’s face darkened at his father’s words.

He had always been the least favored son in the family.

His parents had wanted a daughter after two sons.

His birth as another boy was a profound disappointment.

His unpleasant personality made things worse.

He was not as intelligent as his older brothers.

He was constantly overlooked.

Among the Whitmore sons, he faced unfair treatment his brothers never experienced.

For years, he worked ten times harder than anyone to build his reputation.

Even after learning Victoria’s true identity, he collaborated with her to seize Montgomery assets.

He did everything to secure his position.

Yet, Victoria brought him nothing but disgrace today.

Isabella would not even look at him.

The elders berated him endlessly!

Margaret noticed the hatred brewing inside him.

She quickly tried to soothe him. “Alright, alright, it’s not the end of the world. Alexander, just find a way to sweet-talk her and win her back. She’s a woman. Women love sweet words and gifts. She’s just angry right now. And never get caught with this Victoria again. Her shares are negligible. Her wealth is nothing compared to Isabella’s.”

“I know what I’m doing,” Alexander snapped.

He stormed out furiously.

Did Isabella even respond to sweet talk?

Could he ever win her back?

Recalling her words earlier, he knew the odds were against him.

But he had her in his grasp.

How could he let her go so easily?

The diamond mine should be his.

Isabella should be his too!

Did Nathaniel think he could have her?

No chance!

Alexander possessed things that could destroy Isabella completely!

Meanwhile, Isabella exited the hotel through the VIP passage.

She got into Evelyn’s car.

Evelyn had not been particularly impressed with Isabella initially.

But she did not expect to witness such a thrilling spectacle.

She was unsure if Isabella had planned it all.

But it was enough to improve her opinion of Isabella.

When they arrived at the mansion, Evelyn opened the door for her.

“Mr. Blackwood asked you to wait for him here. Do not go anywhere.”

“Okay.” Isabella had no intention of leaving.

She entered the mansion and immediately changed out of her wedding gown.
###Chapter 218

The gown's puffed sleeves felt ridiculously juvenile on Isabella. She’d never choose this style herself. Only Victoria’s provocation made her wear it. She headed to the bathroom with fresh clothes. The bedroom door swung open.

Click.

Nathaniel stepped inside. He shut the door behind him.

Isabella frowned. “You’re back. Where’s Christopher?”

“Finishing homework.” His reply was brief. His gaze traveled over her.

Her waves tumbled past her shoulders. The wedding dress highlighted her porcelain skin. It accentuated her unique elegance.

“Don’t change.” Nathaniel’s voice was soft. “Let me look at you a bit longer.”

Look longer? Was he serious?

“You’re breathtaking in that gown.” His tone turned husky. Deep and magnetic. Sincere. Mesmerizing.

Isabella’s cheeks warmed under his stare. Her pulse quickened. An unfamiliar nervousness gripped her.

Nathaniel watched the blush spread across her fair skin. He moved closer. Unconsciously leaning in.

The space between them vanished.

His earthy, masculine scent filled her senses. Her heart hammered wildly. She felt paralyzed. Unable to pull away.

Their lips were mere inches apart.

Suddenly…

Click.

The door burst open. Dominic rushed in. “Sir, there’s an urgent—”

He froze. His boss was about to kiss Ms. Montgomery! They moved fast!

“My apologies! I saw nothing!” Dominic stumbled backward. He slammed the door shut.

Isabella couldn’t believe it. She almost let Nathaniel kiss her. Worse, she hadn’t resisted. This wasn’t like her.

She decided to act normal. Grabbing her clothes, she turned toward the bathroom. After two steps, his hand caught her wrist.

He pulled her into a firm embrace. His strong arms wrapped around her waist. Holding her possessively.

“Isabella, I want to kiss you.”

Six words. Spoken in that deep, rough voice. Wild and captivating.

Isabella’s blush deepened. Her heart raced erratically. His voice and proximity were overwhelming. This couldn’t continue.

She tried to squirm free. A low warning sounded above her head. “Don’t move. I can’t promise I’ll stay controlled.”

His tone was arrogant. Full of possession. Laced with restraint. Isabella went still in his arms. Trapped.
###Chapter 219

Nathaniel held her as if he never wanted to let go.

His arms wrapped tightly around her waist, pulling her so close he could feel her heartbeat.

He wanted to merge with her, to claim her completely.

Her body was flawless, intoxicating. He usually had iron self-control, but today something broke.

Seeing her like this, he wanted to marry her. To make her his in every way.

But he held back. He didn't want to scare her. So he just held her, breathing in her scent.

Isabella felt his warmth, his strong arms around her. Any other man would be on the floor by now.

But not him. Strangely, she allowed it.

Something had shifted between them, silently.

After what felt like an eternity, Nathaniel finally released her. He stepped back, his expression cool.

“Forgive me,” he said, voice low. “You’re too beautiful. I lost control for a moment.”

Cough, cough!

Was he apologizing or flirting?

Isabella pushed down the flutter in her chest. She patted his shoulder lightly.

“Mr. Blackwood, you need to work on your self-control. We still have two months of this arrangement.”

She didn’t want him getting any ideas. She turned and walked toward the bathroom with her clothes.

Nathaniel watched her go, his eyes dark. Two months. He could work with that.

When Isabella stepped out of the shower, Oliver was waiting anxiously.

He rushed over, handing her his phone. “Mommy! That bad woman is trying something again!”

“Hmm?” Isabella took the phone warily.

The headline glared back: Victoria Kensington in ICU After Shame-Induced Wall Collision

Photos showed Victoria indeed hitting a wall. Blood stained the floor. She lay unconscious.

Isabella’s lips curved into a faint, cold smile.

“Don’t worry, sweetheart. This pathetic stunt won’t save her.”

No one would fall for it. Who forgives a traitor because she hurt herself?

As expected, the comments were ruthless. Haters swarmed like vultures.

They shared clips of Victoria with Alexander. Others reposted her humiliation—slapped, forced to kneel.

The comments were brutal:

Haha! Her mask is off! Poisoning models? Sleeping with her sister’s fiancé? Stealing assets? Pure evil!

Look at her kneeling. So much hatred! She played the angel, but now she’s just a dog!

A woman like her should be banned for life! She doesn’t deserve to be a public figure!

Boycott everything she represents! All her ads, all her shows!

Within hours, every brand dropped her. Companies demanded refunds. Producers blacklisted her.

Victoria Kensington was finished.

Meanwhile, Isabella shone brighter than ever. Clips of her canceling the wedding went viral.

She was praised for her strength, her independence.

The comments flooded in:

Boss Montgomery, I’ll always support you! I love decisive women! Cheaters don’t deserve forgiveness!

She took a huge risk. If this hadn’t come out, she might have ‘accidentally’ died next! Her assets going to Alexander? Terrifying!

Is anyone else heartbroken for her? Other celebrities would cry for sympathy, but Boss Montgomery didn’t shed a tear. She’s always so strong!
###Chapter 220

SIKR! All Isabella did was remove her veil and accessories. I burst into tears the moment I saw that scene. She must have endured so much pain!

[Everyone knew she was adopted. She never received proper care even as a child. Maybe that's why she rarely shows emotion? No one ever comforted her anyway.]

(Sigh. My heart aches for Boss Montgomery #10086)

The hashtag #Ifeelbad4BossMontgomery trended worldwide. Her popularity skyrocketed overnight.

Brands flooded her with collaboration offers. Production companies sent acting invitations for lead roles, though she'd never acted before.

Even the Celestial Gala committee extended an invitation. The event was in three days. Isabella received three nominations: Most Beloved Female Supermodel, Most Promising Newcomer, and Best Breakthrough Model. She was guaranteed at least one award.

The Celestial Gala was modeling's biggest annual event. Its global live stream attracted hundreds of millions of viewers. Winning an award here meant instant international fame.

Isabella learned the news while strolling with Oliver in the gardens.

"Isabella, you must get a stunning gown for this event," emphasized Julian. "This is crucial for GoldenPhoenix Entertainment's global recognition."

Though the company had signed A-list celebrities, it lacked prestigious awards to establish industry authority. Competitors already had numerous trophies.

"Don't worry," Isabella replied. "Even if just to provoke Victoria, I'll make sure to dazzle everyone." She smiled imagining Victoria watching from her hospital bed.

Overhearing their conversation, Oliver tugged her sleeve. "Mommy, I'm thirsty! I need a drink."

"Alright, hurry back. I'll wait here," said Isabella, noting his frail constitution needed more exercise.

"Okay!"

Oliver scampered off eagerly. But instead of heading to the kitchen, he dashed straight to Nathaniel's study.

He snatched the documents from Nathaniel's hands. "Daddy! Your big chance is here! Mommy needs a gown for the Celestial Gala. You have to get her the most amazing dress!"

Nathaniel frowned. A gown?

He immediately grabbed his phone and called Sebastian. "That limited edition D.K gown at auction - is it still available?"

"Yes! The design is absolutely revolutionary! Perfect craftsmanship and utterly unique. I'm bidding for my future wife!" Sebastian gushed excitedly.

Nathaniel's lips curved slightly. "Bid for me instead. I'll transfer the funds."

"But I wanted to-"

Beep, beep, beep!

Nathaniel hung up before Sebastian could finish.

Sebastian stared at his phone in disbelief. Was this really brotherly love? Since when did Nathaniel become so extravagant? That gown would cost at least five billion!

He texted frantically: [Are you serious? Five billion for Isabella?]

[I'd pay ten billion if necessary!]

Sebastian sighed in resignation. His brother had truly lost his mind over this woman.

Outside, Isabella remained unaware of the mansion's scheming. She waited in the garden, planning her next moves against Victoria. She knew her adopted sister wouldn't stay quiet for long.

Additional preparations were necessary...
###Chapter 221

Victoria Kensington lay motionless in the ICU bed.

Her head was partially shaved from the scalp injury.

Nine stitches held the torn skin together.

The anesthetic had completely worn off now.

A throbbing agony pulsed through her skull.

She kept her eyes tightly shut against the pain.

Two nurses moved around her room with cold efficiency.

Their whispers cut through the sterile air.

“She brought this on herself.”

“A scalp wound? How convenient.”

“Most people hit their foreheads against walls.”

“Not our clever Miss Kensington.”

“She’d never risk her precious face.”

“Calculating witch.”

“Stealing her sister’s fiancé? Her sister’s company?”

“No shame at all.”

Victoria’s fists clenched beneath the thin hospital blanket.

How dare these insignificant nobodies judge her?

She was still a Kensington heiress.

She still mattered.

The door clicked open.

“Leave us,” ordered Eleanor Kensington.

The nurses exited without another word.

Eleanor and Richard Montgomery approached the bed.

They looked down at their motionless daughter.

Richard’s voice was heavy with disappointment.

“Your daughter has become unpredictable, Eleanor.”

“This is not my fault!” Eleanor protested. “I called her every day in that wretched village! I welcomed her home! She deceived her own mother!”

She let out a weary sigh.

“I never imagined she was capable of this.”

“Cancel everything,” Richard stated flatly. “All appointments. All events. No visitors. For the family’s reputation, she remains here until this blows over.”

Eleanor frowned. “The Celestial Gala committee called. She’s nominated for Best Supermodel—”

“A publicity stunt,” Richard interrupted sharply. “They’re using her for ratings. Even if she won, could she show her face? Cancel it. All of it. Our focus must be on Isabella now. The media is slaughtering us over the wedding.”

The public had turned fiercely protective of Isabella Montgomery.

The adopted daughter neglected by her own family.

Pictures circulated online.

Eleanor delivering soup to Victoria.

Eleanor ignoring Isabella completely.

“I admit I failed her,” Eleanor conceded quietly. “She was always so difficult, so defiant… but it looks terrible.”

“The past is irrelevant,” Richard dismissed. “Damage control is everything now. Our family’s future depends on Isabella’s goodwill. You will accompany her to events. You will be seen together. Use our resources to support her at the Celestial Gala.”

He glanced at the still form in the bed.

“As for Victoria… let her rest. A year, perhaps. Arrange for a psychiatrist. See if that helps.”

Beneath closed eyelids, Victoria seethed.

Their words were poison.

Criticizing her.

Praising that vile Isabella.

Isabella had stolen everything.

Their love.

Their loyalty.

Their respect.

Isabella had orchestrated it all!

She was the monster!

Not Victoria!

This could not stand.

She would not let Isabella win.

The moment the door closed behind her parents, Victoria forced her eyes open.

A grim determination settled in her heart.
###Chapter 222

None of the nurses were willing to tend to Victoria. This left her completely unsupervised.

She seized the opportunity to retrieve her phone. A message was quickly typed out to Penelope.

(Isabella must not receive any awards. Ensure she is barred from attending the Celestial Gala entirely. Contact Seraphina Delacroix. Inform her of my strategy.)

Victoria sent the text using a specialized encryption application. It was designed to automatically erase all messages after they were read.

Not even the most advanced hacker could possibly retrieve the data. The conversation would vanish without a trace.

All she needed to do now was wait. She would watch patiently as Isabella's world crumbled. Isabella needed to experience the same agony she felt.

Over at the Montgomery Manor…

Since the disastrous wedding, she had publicly announced a hiatus from all professional work. Every scheduled commitment was deliberately postponed.

This was a calculated move to sell her narrative of a heartbroken woman. It was all a performance to avoid raising suspicion.

In reality, she had been spending every single day with Oliver inside the vast estate. They shared meals, worked on his school assignments, and even exercised together.

This particular afternoon, Isabella finally had a moment to herself. Oliver was napping. She collapsed onto the plush sofa with a sigh.

She pulled out her phone and opened a specific live-streaming application. It was a platform famous for auctioning rare and exclusive luxury items.

The Celestial Gala was tomorrow evening. The event would be swarming with the world's top supermodels. She needed a gown that would make a statement.

She remembered today was the auction for the limited edition D.K creation. Isabella wasn't typically obsessed with high fashion.

But this specific gown's design had captivated her. For the last five years, she had relied solely on herself.

She had cultivated a simple philosophy: reward yourself when you succeed. She was determined to win that auction.

Isabella opened the app and navigated to an old man's live-stream. The chatroom had a modest audience of about forty viewers.

The elderly man, with a full head of white hair, addressed the camera. "The gown I am auctioning today represents a lifetime of my work. I have named it 'Phoenix'."

His two assistants carefully brought the gown into view. It was a stunning, vibrant red.

The design featured a tight, open-shoulder bodice. The sleeves were meticulously crafted, fitting snugly at the top to slenderize the arms.

From the wrist, the fabric dramatically flared out. It extended into a magnificent three-meter-long train.

The elongated sleeves and the mermaid-tail silhouette created an exquisite, flowing shape. A golden phoenix was intricately embroidered across the bodice, from the chest down to the thigh.

The expansive train was embellished with elaborate embroidery resembling phoenix wings. The craftsmanship was utterly mesmerizing.

It appeared as though the mythical bird could burst from the fabric and take flight at any moment.

The live-stream chat immediately exploded with excitement.

(Absolutely breathtaking! I must have it!)

(This is the legendary D.K! A true master who only creates a masterpiece once a decade!)

(I thought his decade-long creations were a myth! To see it is unbelievable!)

D.K remained completely unfazed by the lavish praise. His demeanor was calm and dignified.

"This phoenix embroidery took me a full decade to complete," he explained. "Every stitch was done using a nearly extinct technique known as the Serial and Curly method."

"I am the last living artisan capable of this work. The phoenix's eyes are set with exceptionally rare yellow diamonds."

"The creativity and design of this gown encapsulate fifty years of my story. Therefore, the starting bid is set at ten million dollars."

The moment he announced the price, the bidding war erupted.

(Fifteen million!)

(Eighteen million!)

Isabella watched her screen silently. Her expression was unreadable, a mask of cool composure.

Her desire for this gown went beyond its breathtaking beauty. It was deeply connected to an event from ten years ago.

A shadow passed over her eyes as the memory surfaced. The past held a painful grip on her heart.
###Chapter 223

Ten years ago, Isabella Montgomery was only thirteen. She was the adopted daughter of the Montgomery family, just starting seventh grade. Under Victoria Kensington's influence, she became obsessed with gothic fashion. While everyone else dressed elegantly, she wore bizarre outfits. She went to school with wild, untamed hair. She became an object of ridicule. The entire Montgomery family despised her.

Victoria would always tell her, "Isabella, remember this. Everyone has the right to be unique and beautiful. We don't all have to be the same. Alexander loves your uniqueness! Even if your family hates you, you still have us!"

Isabella was completely fooled by their manipulation. She believed her family didn't understand her. She thought they didn't support her interests. During one heated argument, she ran away from home. That's when she accidentally met D.K.

Back then, D.K was just a local designer. His real name was Frederick Ashford. He came from the Ashford family, which had over a century of embroidery history. Legend said their ancestors served the royal family for generations. Unfortunately, machines replaced hand embroidery. Traditional clothing was overtaken by modern designs.

The Ashford family gradually faded into obscurity. But Frederick remained dedicated to traditional wear. His girlfriend thought he was too old-fashioned and stubborn. She eventually broke up with him. That breakup inspired him to blend modern designs with traditional techniques. He created elegant gowns that bridged past and present.

D.K were his ex-girlfriend's initials. Sadly, when he became less stubborn, she didn't return. She had died in a car accident the day she left him.

That was ten years ago. Frederick told Isabella everything while drunk on the roadside. He even said, "She loved red gowns. She said people would notice her immediately in red. After her death, I made a gown in her favorite shade. I called it Phoenix. I hoped she could come back to life, reborn like a phoenix."

"But I know that's impossible. I started this project when I was thirty. Now I'm seventy. I lack the courage to finish it. I'm afraid once it's done, she still won't return. I'm scared my only belief will disappoint me in the end."

"I lost this year's fashion week. I felt my Phoenix could win. But I just can't bring myself to complete it!"

"If I ever finish it one day, it means I'm ready to leave this world. I can finally go meet her."

"Young lady, Phoenix represents my lifelong devotion. It's my life's work. Do you think I can make it happen?"

Young Isabella listened to the drunk old man's rambling. She didn't understand what 'devotion' meant back then. She didn't take it seriously. Yet, this memory stayed vivid in her mind all these years. Even now, she could recall Frederick's expression clearly. His face was full of passion and nostalgia.

After Alexander cheated on her, Isabella suddenly understood Frederick's story. She felt it deeply. Frederick's devotion to his ex-girlfriend was something Isabella would never experience. She knew no one would mourn her death. No one would miss her for that long.

So she wanted to buy this gown. Not because it was unique. But because Frederick's raw passion and love shouldn't be ruined by ignorant people.

Meanwhile, the bidding price reached eighty million. People were throwing money around without understanding the gown's true value.

Finally, a user named 'Seraphina Delacroix' commented, [One billion!]

The live-stream chat exploded in shock.

[Seraphina Delacroix? The world's sexiest supermodel?]

[One billion? Is she serious? It's just a gown! How is it worth a billion?!]

[Seraphina, have you lost your mind?]

[I'm not crazy. I'm rich! I'm buying it no matter what! Anyone else want to challenge me?] Seraphina typed her response immediately.

Isabella had been dominating the modeling industry lately. Many artists from her company wanted to terminate their contracts. Seraphina Delacroix was furious about the situation. She just wanted to vent her anger through extravagant spending.

Plus, as the most celebrated supermodel, she needed to stun everyone at the Celestial Gala tomorrow night. She had to outshine everyone, especially Isabella!

When Isabella saw Seraphina's comment, her lips curled into a cold smirk. Her fingers began typing on the keyboard.
###Chapter 224

[I'll add one more dollar to any bid Seraphina Delacroix makes.]

The comment instantly captured the attention of everyone watching the live stream.

(An extra dollar? Hah! Who is this? What a bold move!)

(Definitely one of Seraphina's haters. They're deliberately trying to provoke her!)

Seraphina Delacroix trembled with rage. She tried to identify the user, but the account was just a random string of numbers. No clues at all.

She typed furiously. (Who are you? Are you targeting me on purpose?)

Isabella Montgomery replied: [Targeting you? Sorry, but you're not that important. I simply admire Mr. Ashford's gown design and must have it.]

A viewer commented: (Another wealthy contender! I wonder who will win this bidding war.)

(Probably Seraphina. She's one of the richest models in America. Money is no object for her!)

[No matter how rich this mystery bidder is, can they really outspend Seraphina Delacroix?]

Meanwhile, Frederick Ashford stared intently at his screen. He had used the pseudonym D.K for fifty years. The public only knew him as D.K. How did this person know his real surname was Ashford?

Amid the ongoing bids, he picked up his phone and sent Isabella a private message.

[May I ask who you are?]

Isabella received the message while verifying her bank balance. After a moment's thought, she replied. (Mr. Ashford, you finally made your dream a reality. Sometimes, letting go of an obsession can be a form of liberation. After a lifetime of dedication, it's time to live for yourself.)

Frederick Ashford's white eyebrows furrowed deeply as he read the text. The little girl from ten years ago... It was really her...

He had never told anyone what happened after he lost the fashion week competition a decade ago. How he got drunk in a deserted alley. How he met a strangely dressed little girl by chance. He had felt an immediate connection to her, as if she were his own granddaughter. In his drunken state, he had confessed things he never should have said.

When he sobered up, he realized he didn't know her name or how to find her. He never expected to encounter her again a decade later during his auction!

Meanwhile, Seraphina kept typing comments.

[I don't care if this person bids one or two extra dollars! I'll offer a million more! Mr. D.K, you must sell this gown to me! Whatever the price!]

Her career and company were both struggling. Some random stranger thought they could snatch the gown she desired? Absolutely not!

The audience eagerly anticipated the showdown. It seemed these two were prepared for a financial battle. Even if one of them won, the final price would likely reach billions!

Did this unknown bidder actually have billions to spend?

Suddenly, D.K addressed the camera. "My apologies, everyone. I've decided to sell the gown to the lady I was just speaking with. For one billion dollars."

What?

He chose to sell it to the unknown user?
###Chapter 225

The entire platform erupted into chaos.

(Why sell to her specifically?)

(Mr. D.K, your gowns are always auctioned. Why break protocol for her?)

(One billion? The final bid would easily surpass that!)

The heated debate intensified. Isabella Montgomery herself was stunned. Was Mr. Ashford serious? They had met only once, a decade ago, when she was still considered unattractive…

“You heard correctly,” Mr. Ashford stated firmly to the camera. “My decision is final. It is not up for debate.”

Seraphina Delacroix was speechless. She had allocated over ten billion, prepared to crush any competitor. She never expected D.K to simply bypass the auction entirely!

Was this a deliberate insult? A personal slight?

Furious, she typed: (This is unacceptable! I offer 1.5 billion! I stated only I deserve this gown! This violates all auction rules!)

“My apologies,” D.K replied coolly. “I have a preference for the other lady.”

‘Preference’? He would discard established rules based on a mere ‘preference’? He would sell his masterpiece to someone who hadn't even placed a bid?

Blinded by rage, Seraphina threatened: (Mr. D.K, this is a formal auction platform! You must adhere to its rules! The highest bidder wins! Proceed with this, and I will report you for misconduct!)

She was publicly threatening to report him.

In the presidential suite, Sebastian Blackwood frowned at the screen. A single gown causing such an uproar. Why would D.K make such a rash decision? He hadn't even had a chance to bid!

Failure meant a one-way ticket to Africa, courtesy of his brother.

He immediately called Nathaniel. “Brother, we have a problem,” Sebastian said urgently. “D.K just decided to sell the gown to an anonymous user on the live stream. He’s refusing all further bids. I need you to identify this user immediately.”

He recited the username digits.

“One moment,” Nathaniel’s voice was clipped, his fingers already flying across his keyboard. As the data resolved, his expression hardened. The number belonged to Isabella Montgomery.

It was her all along?

A new thought crystallized. “I’ll handle this personally,” Nathaniel stated, ending the call and opening his contacts.

The live stream descended further into bedlam, but Mr. Ashford remained unshaken.

“My decision stands. Further discussion is pointless.”

Seraphina was livid. “Then prepare for the consequences! I will expose you! You have disrespected every bidder here! The court of public opinion will destroy you!”

Hearing Seraphina’s tirade, Isabella’s brow furrowed. Seraphina was notoriously unreasonable, but Mr. Ashford had indeed created this situation. If this went public, he would be crucified by Seraphina’s legions of fans. He could face industry-wide blacklisting.

Mr. Ashford was in his eighties. A scandal of this magnitude could be devastating.
###Chapter 226

Isabella Montgomery was strategizing solutions when Frederick Ashford checked his phone.

His expression shifted instantly.

He addressed the camera with newfound resolve. "I must retract the auction. A private buyer has offered ten billion for this gown."

Ten billion dollars?

Seraphina Delacroix’s shrill voice pierced the air. "Impossible! Who would waste ten billion on that ridiculous dress?"

Frederick’s eyes narrowed. "Client confidentiality is paramount. Ms. Delacroix, control your tone. This auction is concluded."

He terminated the livestream abruptly.

Seraphina trembled with rage. How dare that washed-up designer dismiss her? He broke his own rules first!

Two enemies had emerged: one who publicly challenged her, another who secretly outbid everyone.

"Find them both," she snarled at her assistant. "I want names now."

Meanwhile, Isabella dissected the situation. Frederick Ashford wasn’t known for capriciousness. His sudden reversal defied logic.

Money over principles? Unlikely. Something else was at play.

Her own investigations hit a wall. The buyer’s identity remained shrouded.

Seraphina, however, had better luck. Isabella’s platform registration used her personal number. A skilled hacker easily breached the database.

Seraphina’s call came through moments later.

"Of course it was you," she sneered. "Isabella Montgomery. You overreach constantly. What gives you the right to challenge me? Your net worth doesn’t even approach mine!"

Isabella remained silent, letting her rant unfold.

"You lost too, didn’t you? Outbid by ten billion. Pathetic. If you truly wanted it, why not offer twenty? Oh, wait—you can’t."

Seraphina’s laughter was venomous. "You wanted that dress for the Celestial Gala? Dream on. You’ll never win Best Supermodel. That’s my title. You’ll be lucky to present some minor award. How embarrassing—showing up in a masterpiece for a nothing role."

"Except you don’t have the dress! The great Isabella Montgomery, humiliated. Serves you right. You think you deserve D.K.? Never."

"Karma’s a bitch, isn’t she?"

Isabella waited until the tirade ended. Her voice was ice-calm. "Perhaps. But if you’re not careful, your entire company will face karma. I’ll acquire it piece by piece."

"Don’t you dare poach my artists!" Seraphina shrieked.

Isabella’s smile was lethal. "Your contracts are legally fragile. One misstep from you, and I’ll dismantle everything you’ve built. Remember that."

She ended the call, the threat hanging in the air.
###Chapter 227

Isabella felt the venom in Seraphina’s voice even through the phone. Her expression darkened instantly.

Nathaniel was threatening her with legal action!

If the artists filed a lawsuit, the court would issue a subpoena. Failure to comply would be seen as forfeiting her rights.

How ruthless Nathaniel was! Did she intend to completely obliterate SilverPeak Entertainment?

What chaos!

Just then, Isabella’s assistant approached. “Ms. Delacroix, a woman named Penelope is here to see you. She claims to be Victoria Kensington’s assistant. She asked me to deliver this letter.”

Victoria Kensington?

Isabella frowned. Although she was SilverPeak Entertainment’s director, she only invested for profit and rarely involved herself. Many employees didn’t even know she was the director until recent events exposed her.

As for Victoria, Isabella had only seen her at fashion shows. They were not acquainted. However, the scandals surrounding Victoria had left a strong impression.

“Why would someone like her seek me out?” Isabella scoffed. “Burn that letter now!”

“But Penelope said this letter can help you defeat Nathaniel,” her assistant insisted.

Isabella’s eyes narrowed slightly. Defeat Nathaniel?

That witch Nathaniel had stolen her spotlight and now threatened to ruin SilverPeak Entertainment! She constantly opposed Isabella. It was time to end this!

With that thought, she took the letter from her assistant.

Opening it, a single word lay quietly on the paper: [Mastiff.]

Isabella’s expression shifted, a sinister smile curling her lips. Victoria did not disappoint. This was a brilliantly malicious plan! She eagerly anticipated how Nathaniel would appear at the Celestial Gala tomorrow night!

Nathaniel was unbothered by her earlier exchange with Isabella. Her focus shifted to tomorrow night’s attire. The Celestial Gala would be her first major ceremony in the modeling industry. It would be her debut recognition in this field.

Moreover, since Seraphina Delacroix wanted to destroy her, it only strengthened Nathaniel’s resolve to prove herself to everyone!

It was too late for a custom gown. Buying one from a luxury store lacked uniqueness.

Suddenly, two soft knocks sounded at the door.

Nathaniel looked up to see Alexander standing there, seeming to have something to say.

Considering Oliver was asleep, she stepped out and asked softly, “What is it?”

“Hmph. Follow me.” Alexander turned toward the study.

Nathaniel followed him silently.

His tall, strong figure gave off an unusual sense of security. Whenever Nathaniel glanced at him, her heart raced, forcing her to look away.

Inside the study, Alexander picked up a cube-shaped box and handed it to her.

“Open it.” His voice was deep and pleasing.

She eyed the large matte black box, frowning in curiosity. She reached for it instinctively. Lifting the lid, her pupils dilated in shock.

Inside lay the gown designed by Mr. Ashford! The red dress contrasted exquisitely against the black box. Even folded, the phoenix embroidery was vibrant. The entire phoenix was stitched with pure gold thread, glowing as if alive. This was a masterpiece born from a lifetime of dedication. One glance conveyed its spirit and story.

Nathaniel’s brows furrowed in astonishment. Why did Alexander have this gown? Was he the one who bought it from Mr. Ashford for ten billion?
###Chapter 228

“That’s right. If you see anything you like soon, tell me immediately,” Nathaniel’s voice was deep and magnetic.

Isabella’s heart fluttered traitorously. He spent ten billion…just because she admired a gown?

She studied his face. “Why are you so generous to me?”

They owed each other nothing. Their relationship was contractual, temporary. She had been clear—she would leave in two months.

Nathaniel’s gaze held a knowing glint. “Are you certain you wish to know the reason?”

That tone. That suggestive depth.

“Never mind,” Isabella cut in quickly. “I…I should go check on Oliver. Thank you.”

She clutched the elegant box and hurried away.

If she had let him answer, he would have confessed again. Admitted his feelings. Repeated rejections would wound his pride. Better to escape.

Yet, as she carried the precious box containing the item she desired, an unfamiliar warmth spread through her. A quiet joy. Her lips curved into a soft smile without her realizing.

She didn’t notice how much she resembled a smitten young girl.

Only when she passed the full-length mirror in her room did she freeze. The reflection showed a radiant, happy woman. Was that truly her?

Since when had she become this person? And because of Nathaniel Blackwood, of all people. The untouchable, powerful Nathaniel.

Who was he? The undisputed king of Westchester. The formidable head of the Blackwood empire.

Her own wealth paled in comparison. She possessed barely a fraction of his assets.

What if he discovered the truth about her past? The events five years ago? Would his kindness remain? Would he still look at her with that intensity?

She stared at the large box in her hands. After a long moment, she pulled out her phone and texted her private banker.

(Transfer ten billion to Nathaniel Blackwood’s account.)

(Ten billion?) came the shocked reply.

[Yes. Immediately.)

She didn’t know what came over her earlier. But now, clarity returned. Who was she to accept such an extravagant gift? She was leaving soon. It was better to owe him nothing.

Nathaniel was feeling pleased with himself until his phone buzzed with an alert.

(Your account ending XXX received 1,000,000,000…)

He frowned. Ten billion. From Isabella? She seemed fine moments ago. Why would she…?

His expression darkened.

Night fell. Oliver came to her, his small face pale. “Mommy, my head feels dizzy tonight.”

“Dizzy? I’ll take you to the hospital.” She reached for his hand, ready to leave.

“No, it’s okay,” Oliver shook his head. “It happens sometimes. Especially…a few hours before…”

His voice trailed off. Isabella’s stomach clenched. Did that mean a seizure was coming?

Nathaniel approached, his presence calming. “Don’t worry. I’ll stay with you tonight.”

“Yay!” Oliver perked up instantly. He tugged Isabella’s hand toward the bedroom, then looked back at his father. “I’m sleeping with Mommy tonight. You can watch over us from the chair.”

The chair? Watch over? Isabella’s senses went on alert. Something was definitely brewing.
###Chapter 229

Nathaniel stood rigid. “I’ll take the sofa.”

Oliver’s sobs began to shake the room. “No… no! I want Daddy to stay. I’m scared!”

Isabella pulled the trembling boy into her arms. “It’s alright, sweetheart. Mommy’s here. Daddy can watch over you from the sofa.”

“But Ethan told me he sleeps between his parents! They hold his hands and hug him all night!” Oliver’s tears soaked through Isabella’s sleeve. “Everyone laughed at me because I’ve never done that!”

His small body convulsed with each ragged breath. Isabella’s heart clenched. She’d give anything to stop his tears.

Still… sharing a bed with Nathaniel?

She attempted reason. “Oliver, research shows sleeping between adults isn’t healthy. The carbon dioxide—”

“I don’t care!” he wailed. “I’ve waited five years for this! It’s all I want!”

His crying intensified. Small shoulders shook with violent tremors. A seizure seemed imminent.

Nathaniel strode forward, his expression dark. “Oliver Blackwood. Stop this behavior.” He retrieved a wooden ruler from the drawer. “Go to sleep. Now.”

The ruler struck Oliver’s bottom with a sharp crack.

The boy jolted, crying harder. “Why are you mad? I just want what other children have!”

He choked between sobs, gasping for air. Isabella panicked. She couldn’t risk another medical episode.

She pulled him close, shooting Nathaniel a sharp look. “He’s sleeping with us tonight.”

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. “That’s not appropriate—”

“Since when are you so proper? Get on the bed.” Her tone brooked no argument.

After a tense pause, Nathaniel relented. “Fine.”

He moved to the far side of the bed. Isabella settled Oliver between them, stroking his back. “No more tears, my brave boy. Mommy and Daddy are here. You need to stay healthy for us, alright?”

Oliver’s tears vanished. A radiant smile spread across his face as he snuggled against her.

The three of them lay in uneasy proximity. Thankfully, Oliver served as a barrier. His well-being outweighed her discomfort.

Isabella wasn’t bound by convention. Her son’s peace mattered most.

She switched off the lights. Moonlight spilled through the window, softening the room’s edges.

Oliver’s breathing soon steadied into sleep’s gentle rhythm. Nathaniel watched Isabella through the silver light, a faint smile touching his lips before he closed his eyes.

Isabella’s eyes snapped open in the darkness.

What had she just agreed to?

They lay together like a proper family. The intimacy of it unnerved her.
###Chapter 230

She had made the firm decision to pull away from Nathaniel just this afternoon too.

Isabella’s mind began to churn. Wasn’t this all a little too convenient? Oliver said he was dizzy, and then Nathaniel walked in and struck him with that stick.

Amid the tangled thoughts, something clicked into place. Nathaniel’s acting was simply too convincing. He staged this whole scene with his own son… just to get into her bed? Strangely, the realization didn’t anger her. She couldn’t even muster the will to be truly upset. If this continued, things would inevitably escalate between them.

Isabella’s eyes narrowed as she reached a critical decision. She would tell him the truth. He would find out eventually, and she despised living a lie.

She carefully rehearsed the words in her head, clenching her fists tightly. “Nathaniel,” she confessed, her voice low but clear, “Don’t fall for me. Nothing can ever happen between us. Five years ago, I was… I had a baby.”

A heavy weight seemed to lift from her chest the moment the words left her lips, yet a sharp, persistent ache took its place in her heart.

She was certain this confession would shatter whatever feelings he had for her. This was the end. Their story was over before it ever truly began.

Isabella slowly closed her eyes, bracing for his reaction. She waited. And waited. But the only response was a profound, deafening silence. The room was so quiet she could hear her own heartbeat.

Frowning, she turned her head to look at him. In the silvery moonlight, his eyes were shut, his brow smooth and untroubled. His expression was peaceful, his breathing deep and even.

He was asleep. He had fallen asleep that fast?

After she had gathered every ounce of her courage to reveal her deepest secret… he was sleeping.

A wave of pure fury washed over her. He had no idea how much it had cost her to say those words, and he… he just slept!

Forget it. Maybe it was fate. They would talk tomorrow. Remembering the Celestial Gala tomorrow night, she forced herself to push down her anger and try to sleep.

Morning light filtered into the room. Isabella opened her eyes to the sight of a bare, sculpted chest. The scent was clean and distinctly masculine.

Wait. What was this?

Why was she curled into Nathaniel’s arm, her head nestled against his chest?

Where was Oliver? Hadn’t he been sleeping between them? How did this happen?

And more importantly, where was Oliver now?

She bolted upright. The other side of the bed was empty. Oliver was gone. It was just her and Nathaniel in the room. He was lying on his side, one leg draped possessively over hers.

“Nathaniel Blackwood!” she scowled, her voice sharp. “Care to explain this?”

Nathaniel’s eyes fluttered open. Sleep softened his usually intimidating features, making him look like a drowsy, powerful lion.

It took him a moment to process the situation. “Explain what?” he asked, his voice a deep, sleep-roughened rumble.

“Stop playing dumb! Explain why you’re holding me! Where is Oliver?” Her eyes were wide with accusation.

“Holding you?” He frowned, a hint of amusement in his tired gaze. “Shouldn’t I be the one asking questions, Miss Montgomery? Take a good look at your current position. Don’t you owe me an explanation?” His voice was a magnetic drawl.

Isabella’s gaze dropped to their entangled limbs. The reality of the situation hit her, and it was far worse than she initially thought.
###Chapter 231

Isabella realized she was the one who shifted positions during sleep.

Somehow she had migrated from her designated side of the bed directly into the center.

This meant Anthony hadn't moved to embrace her—she had actively curled into his arms instead.

Heat flooded her cheeks with instant mortification. This made no logical sense. Her sleeping habits were notoriously still; she never tossed or turned recklessly. How could this occur?

Nathaniel sat up gracefully, adjusting his clothes with deliberate elegance. A smirk played on his lips. "Last time was understandable since you were poisoned. This occasion requires an explanation, Ms. Montgomery."

Last time...

Dread pooled in her stomach as memories resurfaced—that night Lawrence Chamberlain drugged her. Hazy fragments flashed through her mind: lunging at Nathaniel, grinding against him, climbing atop him...

Humiliation burned through her veins. She shook off the vivid recollections sharply. "Why is a grown man complaining? You weren't the one violated here. Stop being shameless!" She slid off the mattress, ready to escape.

Nathaniel's gaze intensified, locking onto her. "That was my first embrace. I've always remained pure. Shouldn't you take responsibility?"

"Don't lie! How could you never have held a woman? Don't fabricate accusations!" She rolled her eyes while slipping on her shoes.

He caught her wrist, expression turning deadly serious. "Isabella, I never lie."

His unwavering stare made her heartbeat stutter uncontrollably.

Was that true? Had he really never lied? Was Nathaniel Blackwood genuinely untouched?

His lips curved into a faint smile. "Marry me. You won't regret it." His voice dropped to a low, determined timbre.

Disbelief swamped her. Their modern society overflowed with promiscuous men, especially wealthy ones who treated women as toys. Yet here he was, completely chaste...!

Obviously no woman would regret marrying him—he was literally one in a million. But...

Her eyes dimmed slightly as she pulled her hand free. "I don't like men who are too pure. It's childish." She fabricated an excuse and bolted from the room.

Nathaniel frowned. Childish?

Did she just call him childish? Or was she insulting his purity? Perhaps it was time to teach her a proper lesson.

Isabella fled into another room like escaping catastrophe. She splashed cold water on her face in the bathroom, Nathaniel's words echoing in her mind. She never imagined he was untouched, but this revelation made everything more complicated. She needed to clarify last night's conversation soon.

"Mommy, you're awake?" Oliver's timid voice interrupted. "Look at my painting."

She turned to see him approaching with a canvas.

The artwork depicted three figures sleeping on a bed—a man and woman cradling a small boy between them. Rendered in oils, the subjects were unmistakably themselves.

Isabella stared in shock. "Momo, you painted this?"

"Yes! Do you like it, Mommy?" Hope sparkled in his eyes.

"Of course! You're so young yet created something this impressive! You're more talented than me!" She praised warmly, ruffling his hair.

Oliver jumped joyfully. "I'm glad you like it! I got inspired early this morning. I'll ask someone to hang it beside our bed!"

Her smile faltered slightly. He wanted to display it near the bed? What if his grandparents or relatives visited? They would undoubtedly see it.
###Chapter 232

The portrait was unmistakably her.

Isabella started to speak. “Christopher, what if we don’t—”

Before she could finish, Oliver chirped, “I’ll handle it right now, Mommy! See you soon!” He dashed off on his little legs.

Isabella sighed. That boy…

It didn’t matter. No one had visited her at the estate since she moved in. Oliver mentioned his grandparents didn’t like him. They probably wouldn’t come.

She refocused. Preparations for the Celestial Gala tonight demanded attention. Though it was ten hours away, her gown required a perfect hairstyle. Matching accessories and shoes were essential. She wanted to honor Mr. Ashford’s effort.

After breakfast, Evelyn approached her with a box. “Ms. Montgomery, Mr. Blackwood assigned me to style you today.”

Isabella had avoided Nathaniel since the morning incident. His thoughtfulness surprised her.

Evelyn was Nathaniel’s top assistant. She specialized in serving elite clients, including styling. Her work was impeccable.

Isabella sat before the mirror. “Thank you.”

Evelyn began styling her hair.

Soon, Isabella’s phone lit up on the desk. The caller ID showed ‘Mom.’

It was Eleanor. She was calling.

Though Eleanor never acted like a mother, and Isabella didn’t see her as one, she kept the contact name to maintain her cover.

Isabella answered flatly. “Yes?”

“Isabella, where are you staying? I went to Rosewood Manor and you weren’t there.” Eleanor’s tone was unusually gentle.

After talking with her husband Richard, Eleanor had searched for Isabella. She couldn’t find her.

Isabella’s eyes flickered. She gave a vague excuse. “Another property. Contact me if you need me.”

“Nothing urgent. I wanted to ask if you’d like to live with us? You’re a Montgomery. Living alone isn’t proper,” Eleanor said.

Isabella didn’t expect an invitation. She remembered how Eleanor and Richard had bodyguards escort her away on her first day back. Contempt flashed in her eyes. “I apologize, but I don’t plan to return. As my mother, you know how everyone despises an adopted daughter. To avoid conflict, I prefer living alone.”

Eleanor sighed. Even if she and Richard accepted Isabella, others might not. After a pause, she continued. “Isabella, can I ask a favor? The Montgomerys have connections with the Celestial Gala organizers. You’ll win awards tonight. Could you say something kind about your sister during interviews? Please don’t criticize her further…”

Isabella’s eyes dulled. So this was the real reason for the call. Victoria committed terrible acts, yet Eleanor still defended her?

Connections? Isabella could win awards without Montgomery connections.

Sensing her displeasure, Eleanor sighed. “I know Victoria made bad choices. She’s unforgivable. As punishment, I transferred her five-percent shares to your father. She’s also badly injured and still in a coma. She’s suffered enough… I hope you can forgive her a little.”

Isabella frowned. They actually took five percent of her shares? Victoria would be furious! With only five percent left, she had little influence in the family. What could she do now?

Isabella’s lips curved slightly. “I’ll say a few words to the media. Under one condition.”

“What condition?” Eleanor asked immediately.
###Chapter 233

Isabella remained silent for a long moment before finally responding. “When she wakes up, she must go live and apologize. In front of all her followers and the press. She has to confess everything she did and apologize to me directly.”

Victoria had been hiding in that hospital room, pretending to be sick, lying in that bed. She thought she could just avoid the whole mess. Did she really believe that after everything, she could just stay quiet and wait for people to forget? Not a chance.

Eleanor hesitated. Victoria wasn't in a good place mentally. What if seeing all the hate online made her faint again, just as she was starting to recover? She was so fragile. How could she possibly face a public apology, knowing she'd be torn apart? And sleeping with your sister's fiancé… that was a deeply shameful act. No one would want to admit to that.

“Is there… no other way?” Eleanor couldn't help but ask. “This condition seems rather…”

“Mother, are you still protecting her?” Isabella's voice was cold. “When has she ever apologized for anything? How can I help her if she won't even admit she was wrong? Would you hesitate like this if it were me? If I had seduced her husband and tried to steal everything from her?”

Eleanor felt a sharp pang of guilt. If it were Isabella, she wouldn't hesitate at all. Isabella was just the adopted daughter. When she made that mistake five years ago, the whole family cast her out immediately. Eleanor was having second thoughts. Isabella did grow up with them, even if she wasn't blood…

“I know I was adopted,” Isabella continued, her voice steady. “That's why I've never asked for anything. But she ruined my wedding. She tried to steal what was mine. I'm not a saint. All I want is an apology. Besides, she'll only learn from this if she admits her mistakes. Don't you agree?”

Eleanor finally relented. “Alright. I'll talk to her. I'll make her apologize. Please… say a few good words for her when you can.”

A cold smirk touched Isabella's lips as she ended the call. She knew Victoria better than anyone. Victoria could fake tears and play the victim beautifully, but it was always for sympathy. Asking her to actually admit her fault? To take responsibility? That would shatter her entire carefully constructed image. It would be pure agony for her.

But what was that agony compared to what Isabella had endured? Being raped, giving birth to a dead child, being thrown out to Africa to die a slow death? What comparison was there? And if Isabella had remained the foolish girl she was five years ago, they would have killed her and taken everything.

They deserved every bit of this.

Meanwhile, in the hospital room…

Eleanor put her phone away and walked back to Victoria's bedside. She looked at her pale, fragile daughter. “Don't worry. Your sister has agreed to speak on your behalf tonight. If she forgives you, the public will eventually move on. She is the victim, after all.”

“Really?” A flicker of hope lit in Victoria's eyes.

Eleanor nodded, sitting down beside the bed. “However… she has one condition. You have to go live. You have to apologize to her, and to everyone.”

“What?” Victoria's face instantly froze.

A live stream? An apology?

God, she loathed even leaving her room after what happened. Every time she remembered people had seen her like that, she wanted to crawl into a hole and disappear. And now Isabella wanted her to apologize publicly? To bring it all up again? Why was she forcing her to face this humiliation?

Seeing the outright resistance on her daughter's face, Eleanor spoke with solemn firmness. “Victoria, you need to face this. You do owe everyone an apology. And Isabella is trying to help you. You get back up where you fell. Only by facing your mistakes can you truly change and become a better person. Don't you understand?”

Hah! How noble. So inspiring. Victoria screamed internally.

Isabella helping her? A bitch like Isabella would do anything to destroy her completely through this. Why would she help? And why make her face it? If this had happened to anyone else, who would ever want to mention it again?

They'd already taken her five percent share. Now they wanted to destroy her completely? Did she have to die for them to be satisfied?
###Chapter 234

Victoria seethed with a cold, calculating rage. Her outward composure was a stark contrast to the storm brewing within.

“You’re right, Mother,” she conceded, her voice a practiced mask of contrition. “I will offer Isabella a public apology. I’ll do it properly.”

Eleanor studied her daughter’s pitiful expression, a flicker of unease in her gut. The sincerity seemed rehearsed, hollow. Something fundamental had shifted in Victoria, a subtle but undeniable change Eleanor couldn't quite pinpoint. She dismissed it as a bad mood, turning to prepare a plate of sliced fruit for her.

Victoria’s gaze followed the glinting blade of the knife. Dark waves of loathing crashed behind her carefully neutral eyes. So Isabella wanted to play games? Victoria was more than ready. She would relish watching Isabella’s spectacular downfall at the Celestial Gala.

Paparazzi had swarmed the venue hours before the event was set to begin. The Celestial Gala was the modeling world’s most prestigious night. Every major supermodel would be there, including reclusive legends rarely seen in public.

The main attraction, however, was Isabella Montgomery. This was her first public appearance since the wedding scandal exploded.

Isabella, the nation's wealthiest heiress. Alexander, the charismatic and powerful CEO. Victoria, the world’s top supermodel. A scandal involving these three titans was irresistible.

Every reporter craved an exclusive, a shocking soundbite. By five in the evening, the area outside the venue was a chaotic sea of media and onlookers.

Isabella, finally dressed in her gown, slid into the waiting car.

Evelyn was behind the wheel. Nathaniel and Oliver sat flanking Isabella. The little boy clutched her hand, his expression wistful. “Mommy,” Oliver murmured, his voice small. “When can I go with you? I want everyone to know I’m your Momo. I want to be right beside you.”

A pang shot through Isabella’s heart. That could never happen, could it?

She forced a gentle tone. “When my career is more settled, sweetheart. I’ll take you everywhere. But first, my brave Momo needs to get stronger. You need a healthy, powerful heart for all those exciting events.”

“I will! I’ll be so strong!” Oliver promised, his face brightening.

His innocent determination twisted a knot of anxiety in her chest. Could she really leave in two months? Would he be fully recovered by then?

Her thoughts were interrupted as the car jerked to a halt about a kilometer from the venue. “There’s some kind of incident ahead,” Evelyn announced, peering through the windshield. “The road’s completely blocked. We’ll have to cut through the side alley.”

“Understood,” Isabella replied, her eyes scanning the congested street ahead.

The Gala attracted the city’s elite and their entourages. Clashes were not uncommon. Avoiding the commotion was the wiser choice. A narrow alleyway opened up just ahead, too tight for the car.

“We’ll have to walk from here,” Evelyn stated, shifting the car into park.

Nathaniel, who had been reviewing documents, finally looked up. He neatly filed the papers away and exited the vehicle, moving to open Isabella’s door. His voice was a low, husky murmur. “I’ll escort you through.”

“No, it’s fine,” Isabella said quickly, stepping out. She glanced toward the alley’s entrance. “Others might use this route too. If we’re seen together… it wouldn’t be good.” Her tone was laced with a reluctant worry.

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. A shadow of disappointment crossed his features. “Am I an embarrassment to you now?” The question was sharp, edged with clear displeasure.

Isabella was taken aback. Of course he wasn’t, but…
###Chapter 235

Isabella Montgomery and Nathaniel Blackwood shared no real connection. They weren't even in a relationship. Why create unnecessary complications?

In two months, their paths would diverge completely. They'd become strangers again. If anyone discovered their current arrangement, it would be utterly humiliating.

She couldn't voice these thoughts in front of Oliver, so Isabella chose her words carefully. "You should stay with Christopher. The alley is only five hundred meters away. Evelyn will accompany me. We can discuss this after Christopher feels better."

Her final sentence carried a hidden meaning: Everything would end once Oliver recovered.

Nathaniel's expression darkened, but he didn't press further. "Take care of her," he instructed Evelyn.

"Yes, sir," Evelyn replied dutifully, moving to support the long train of Isabella's gown.

Isabella waved at Oliver. "Be good for Mommy, alright? Wait for me at home." She blew him a kiss.

Oliver reached out with his small, chubby hand, pretending to catch the floating kiss. His face lit up as if he'd truly captured it. "Okay! Be careful, Mommy!"

Isabella nodded and turned to leave. Nathaniel felt an unexpected pang of jealousy watching Oliver's tiny fist clutching the imaginary kiss...

The alley ran behind the venue, squeezed between two towering hotels. The pavement was even, manageable even in heels. Still, Isabella deliberately slowed her pace for Evelyn. Without the three-meter train, she would have walked alone. Evelyn noticed the consideration, feeling impressed.

Isabella usually maintained a cool, distant aura, except when speaking to Oliver. Yet in small gestures, she showed more genuine care than many superficially sweet celebrities. Still, these qualities weren't enough for someone like her to deserve Boss Blackwood!

They walked single file toward the venue. As they rounded the corner...

"Grrr!"

A massive brown Tibetan Mastiff suddenly charged toward them. The beast stood a meter tall, covered in thick, luxurious fur. It looked powerfully built, almost lion-like in its ferocity!

Before they could react, the mastiff lunged directly at Isabella!

"Ah! Watch out!" Evelyn screamed instinctively, grabbing Isabella and pulling her aside.

Isabella jumped away just as the mastiff leaped. Enraged by their escape, the dog emitted a deep, guttural bark. It launched forward again with monstrous speed.

"Run!" Evelyn's voice cracked with panic as she dragged Isabella into a sprint.

Nathaniel and Oliver were still outside. Mr. Blackwood could handle that beast if he were here!

But how could they outrun a mastiff? It would catch them in seconds.

The worst part: when they turned to flee, the alley's entrance was suddenly blocked by a large ceramic jar. They were trapped!

They reached the dead end and spun around. The mastiff was barely two meters away, jaws wide open. A bloody scent wafted from its mouth.

The normally composed Evelyn cried out in terror. A mastiff this size could tear flesh with a single scratch. One bite could easily crush a skull and end a life!

What could they do? What could they do?!

Isabella's face turned grave as she desperately scrambled for a solution.

Not far from the alley, Seraphina Delacroix watched the mastiff attack Isabella, a vicious smirk twisting her lips. How dare Isabella steal her company's resources? This was the price she had to pay! She even stole her gown? Fine! Let her die wearing it! Seraphina would attend the Celestial Gala gloriously. She would walk on stage to accept her Number One Supermodel Award!

The mastiff closed in on Isabella. Its bloody jaws gaped open. Its sharp claws aimed directly for Isabella's body.
###Chapter 236

One scratch. One bite. That was all it would take to end Isabella Montgomery.

Evelyn Sinclair squeezed her eyes shut in terror.

The mastiff lunged, jaws gaping. Inches from impact, Isabella’s arm snapped forward with explosive force.

The blow sent the massive dog stumbling backward. It scrambled away, fleeing down the alley.

Straight toward Seraphina Delacroix.

Seraphina’s face drained of all color. She spun and bolted, screaming. “Help! Somebody help me!”

No one heard. This was the deserted back of the venue. Her flight triggered the beast’s chase instinct.

It accelerated, claws unsheathed. They raked across Seraphina’s back with brutal force.

Riiip.

The sound of tearing silk echoed sharply.

Her gown shredded. A deep, bleeding gash tore from her shoulder down to her thigh.

Seraphina shrieked, a raw, agonized sound.

The scent of blood maddened the mastiff. It targeted her again.

She ran desperately, her injury crippling her speed. Her heel caught on uneven pavement.

She pitched forward, plunging into an uncovered maintenance sewage tank.

“Arf! Arf! Arf!” The mastiff stood at the edge, barking furiously at the figure flailing in the filth below.

“Get me out! Help!” Seraphina screamed, terrified the beast would leap down and finish her.

Evelyn watched, stunned and horrified. Disbelief locked her in place.

What just happened?
Why was Seraphina Delacroix here?
Why did the dog attacking Isabella suddenly turn on Seraphina?

She turned to Isabella. “Did you… do that?”

A cold smile touched Isabella’s lips. “I simply returned what was given.”

She strode forward and scooped up a small packet of powder from the ground. With a sharp flick of her wrist, she hurled it down the alley, away from the tank.

The mastiff leaped, snapping at the airborne packet, and charged after it, vanishing around a corner.

Isabella had spotted the packet the moment the dog charged. Velcro strips covered it, meant to cling to her clothes. Seraphina’s trap.

With the immediate threat gone, Isabella walked to a heavy metal gate. She pulled it shut with a definitive clang.

Silence descended. The danger was contained.

Meanwhile…

Seraphina thrashed in the murky sewage, only her head above the surface. She clung to a rusty metal bar, preventing a complete submersion.

She saw Isabella approaching. “Isabella! Pull me up! Get me out of here!” she shrieked.

Isabella stopped at the edge. She looked down, her expression icy. “Who are you? Why should I help you?”

“It’s me! Seraphina Delacroix! Director of SilverPeak Entertainment! The World’s Sexiest Supermodel! Now pull me up!” she demanded, gasping, her eyes blazing with fury.

Isabella calmly smoothed her sleeve. “Seraphina Delacroix? The illustrious supermodel? What is she doing in a place like this? How did she end up in a sewage tank?” Her voice dripped with mockery. “Covered in filth. I honestly couldn’t tell it was you.”

“You… You did this! You turned that beast on me!” Seraphina snarled, teeth gritted. “You vicious witch! Help me now, and I might forget this. Otherwise, my family will use every resource to destroy you!”

Her words were pure threat, laced with arrogant entitlement.

Isabella merely offered a contemptuous scoff. She brushed her hands together dismissively and turned to leave.

Seraphina’s face flushed crimson with rage and humiliation. How dare she? Was Isabella not afraid of the Delacroix family’s power? Was she actually walking away?
###Chapter 237

Her eyes burned with pure hatred as she watched Isabella walk away. “Isabella Montgomery! You vicious snake! Stop right there! If you take another step, I’ll drag you to court! You set that beast on me, pushed me into this filth, and deliberately injured me! I’ll make sure you rot behind bars!”

Isabella halted abruptly. She pulled out her phone and began typing.

Seraphina’s rage flickered, replaced by smug satisfaction. “What’s this? Finally scared? Calling your little helpers? Listen carefully—get someone on the line right now, or I swear I’ll ruin you!”

“Be my guest. It might even trend. But such a masterpiece… it deserves an audience, don’t you think?” Isabella’s voice was ice. She turned the screen toward Seraphina.

The footage was horrifying. Seraphina, submerged to her chin in putrid sludge. Her hands white-knuckling a rusted bar. Filth matted her hair, streaked her face. And her expression—twisted, monstrous, snarling like a rabid animal.

Seraphina’s face purpled with fury. “Delete it! Erase it now!”

“Such a waste to delete, though. You wanted to sue me, correct? No cameras around. This… this is your evidence. How will your fans react? Pity? Or will they laugh at the spectacle?” Isabella’s tone remained chillingly calm.

Seraphina felt bile rise. This was a counter-threat. That video was a weapon aimed right at her.

She ground her teeth. “Isabella Montgomery, you’re pure evil! A twisted, sick monster! Just you wait—argh!”

Her body jerked. She sank deeper. A wave of foul liquid flooded her mouth. Exhaustion was winning. Her grip was failing.

“Seraphina Delacroix. Five seconds.” Isabella’s voice cut through the panic. “Confess everything, and I pull you out. Keep lying… well.”

She tapped her phone. A timer appeared. Five. Four. Three…

“Isabella! You witch! I’ve never met anyone as vile as you! You’ll—”

The timer blared. Time was up.

Without a word, Isabella turned. Her posture was regal, untouchable. Evelyn gathered the hem of her gown, following like a loyal attendant.

Seraphina’s arms screamed in agony. She had seconds before she went under completely. Terror won. “I’ll talk! I’ll tell you! It was Victoria! Victoria Kensington! She told me to use the mastiff! The beast is always near my office!”

“Several departments tried to remove it! It’s too aggressive! Victoria sent a note! I got the attractant powder! I only did it because you’re always in my way!”

It didn’t matter. She could still destroy Isabella later.

Isabella’s brow furrowed. Victoria. Again. Scheming even from a hospital bed.

Seraphina sank further. Another gulp of sewage choked her.

Isabella grabbed a discarded rope nearby. She tossed it down. “Grab it. Yourself.”

“I… I have no strength…” Seraphina wanted to beg for help, but the look in Isabella’s eyes froze the words in her throat. She knew that look. No mercy. No second chances.

She summoned every last ounce of will. Her fingers closed around the rough fiber.

Isabella stepped back. Evelyn moved to assist, but Isabella raised a hand. With seemingly effortless strength, she began to pull.

Evelyn stared, stunned. How could someone so slender possess such raw power?

Isabella used one hand. She pulled Seraphina from the two-meter pit without a single strained breath. It was terrifying. Unnatural.

Where did that strength come from?
###Chapter 238

Seraphina finally got pulled out, collapsing on the ground, completely drained and reeking of foul odor.

She scrambled to her feet and charged straight at Isabella.

“Isabella! I’ll ruin you! You’ll pay for all of this!” Her murderous rage was palpable in her stance. The deep wound from the mastiff attack—the gash running down her back—required immediate hospital treatment. That meant she’d miss the Celestial Gala. If she didn’t show, her awards would go to someone else!

How could she just stand by and watch Isabella attend in that stunning gown? No way! She wanted to attack Isabella and scar her face!

Isabella remained completely calm, phone in hand, simply watching Seraphina charge toward her.

“Go ahead. Hurt even one strand of my hair, and I’ll post this video and recording immediately! Everyone will see how you, Seraphina Delacroix, tried to attack me with a mastiff but ended up falling into the sewage tank! Oh, and a friendly reminder: Attempted assault could land you in jail for a year!” Isabella stated clearly, already logged into her Twitter account.

Seraphina, mid-charge, froze in her tracks. Her face twisted into something ugly as she stood there, completely immobilized.

Isabella had recorded everything!

If that footage got out, it would be the end of Seraphina! This was the first time she’d felt such intense hatred, and it was utterly agonizing!

“Isabella! You’re pure evil! I’ll never forgive you! Never—”

“Ugh! Stay away from me, you filthy sewage woman! Disgusting!” Isabella rolled her eyes at Seraphina before turning to walk away arrogantly.

After a few steps, she paused and glanced back at Seraphina one last time. “Ah, yes. I can threaten you once, and I can do it again. Cross me one more time, and I won’t hesitate to post this clip and recording online!” A satisfied smirk curled Isabella’s lips as she turned and left for good.

Seraphina remained rooted to the spot. She was so furious she felt like vomiting blood! Not only had Isabella humiliated her, but she’d threatened her again before leaving! Was she trying to kill her?

Left with no other options, Seraphina clenched her fists tightly and screamed, “Argh!” She had to make Isabella pay for this! She absolutely would!

Evelyn followed behind Isabella, filled with admiration. Under such pressure, Isabella had handled the mastiff and turned the tables on Seraphina, exposing her true ugliness. Evelyn suddenly understood why Boss Nathaniel was so deeply in love with Isabella…

Seraphina cried out in fear, “I’ll tell you! I’ll tell you everything! It was Victoria! Victoria told me to use the mastiff against you! The mastiff is always lurking near my office!

“Many departments have tried to catch it, but it’s too strong! After Victoria sent me a note about it, I got the special powder to attract it. I only did this because you keep getting in my way!”

It didn’t matter. Seraphina could still find a way to eliminate Isabella later!

Isabella frowned; it was Victoria again! Still scheming maliciously, even from her hospital bed.

Seraphina’s body sank deeper, and she accidentally swallowed another mouthful of sewage water.

Isabella picked up a discarded rope nearby and tossed it toward her. “Grab it yourself,” she scoffed.

“I have no strength…” Seraphina meant to ask Isabella for another solution, but before she could finish, she caught Isabella’s icy glare. She knew what Isabella was like; if she kept complaining, she’d definitely be left behind.

So, she had no choice but to muster every last bit of her strength and cling tightly to the rope.

Isabella took a few steps back. Just as Evelyn was about to step forward and help, Isabella used her own grip strength to haul Seraphina out of the tank.

Evelyn’s eyes widened in shock. How could a slender woman like Isabella possess such immense grip strength?

A woman like her had pulled Seraphina up with just one hand, effortlessly! It was a two-meter-deep pit! Where did that strength come from?!
###Chapter 239

Isabella Montgomery finally pulled herself out of the filth.

She collapsed onto the ground, completely drained and reeking of sewage.

Suddenly, she scrambled to her feet.

She charged straight toward Seraphina Delacroix.

“Seraphina! I’ll ruin you! You’ll pay for this!” Her eyes burned with murderous rage.

Her stance was aggressive, fueled by pure hatred.

The deep gash on her back from the mastiff’s attack needed immediate medical attention.

It meant she would miss the Celestial Gala.

If she didn’t show up, her awards would be given to someone else.

She couldn’t bear the thought of Seraphina attending in that stunning gown.

No. She had to attack. She aimed for Seraphina’s face.

Meanwhile, Seraphina remained completely calm.

She held up her phone, watching Seraphina’s frantic charge.

“Go ahead. Hurt even one hair on my head, and I’ll post this immediately.” Her voice was icy. “The whole world will see how you, Seraphina Delacroix, set a mastiff on me and then fell into a sewage tank. A little reminder: attempted assault can land you in prison for a year.” She was already logged into her social media, finger hovering over the post button.

Seraphina froze mid-charge.

Her expression twisted into something ugly and horrified.

Seraphina had recorded everything.

If that video got out, her career was over.

This was the first time she had ever felt such consuming hatred. It was agony.

“Seraphina! You’re pure evil! I will never forgive you! Never—”

“Ugh. Stay away. You smell like a sewer. Disgusting.” Seraphina rolled her eyes dismissively.

She turned to walk away, her posture radiating arrogance.

After a few steps, she paused and glanced back. “Oh, and I can threaten you once, I can do it again. Cross me, and this goes viral instantly.” A satisfied smirk played on her lips before she finally left.

Seraphina stood rooted to the spot, trembling with fury.

She was so angry she felt physically ill.

Not only had Seraphina humiliated her, but she’d left with another threat.

Was she trying to destroy her completely?

Powerless and seething, Seraphina clenched her fists until her nails dug into her palms.

“Argh!” She screamed her frustration into the empty air.

She would make Seraphina pay. She swore it.

Evelyn Sinclair followed behind Seraphina, utterly in awe.

Under that immense pressure, Seraphina had handled the mastiff and turned the tables completely.

She had exposed Seraphina’s true, hideous nature.

Evelyn finally understood why Nathaniel Blackwood was so captivated by her.

The red carpet for the Celestial Gala was swarmed with hundreds of paparazzi.

Supermodels began their grand arrivals.

Major live-streaming platforms broadcast the event to millions.

In her hospital room, Eleanor Kensington turned on the television.

She watched intently, waiting to see if Seraphina would keep her promise.

Victoria Kensington’s eyes were glued to the screen.

One supermodel after another made their dazzling appearances.

A faint, cold smile touched Victoria’s lips.

It was 6:50 PM.

The red carpet would end in ten minutes.

Seraphina was nowhere to be seen.

Haha! Victoria felt a surge of vicious satisfaction.

She pictured the mastiff tearing into Seraphina.

Eleanor noticed her expression and mistook it for discomfort. “Victoria, you should rest. This might be upsetting. I’ll turn it off.” She reached for the remote.

Victoria stopped her quickly. “No, Mother. It’s fine. My sister was right. I need to face my mistakes. Watching her succeed at such a big event makes me happy for her. It helps me feel better. Let’s keep watching.”

She needed to witness Seraphina’s absence herself.

She wanted to hear the announcement that Seraphina was in the emergency room.

Eleanor, unaware of her daughter’s true thoughts, believed she was being genuine.

She smiled and settled in to watch with her.

Suddenly, a wave of excited gasps and shouts erupted from the television.

A paparazzo’s voice cut through the noise, loud and clear. “Look! Who is that?”
###Chapter 241

Isabella Montgomery’s phone buzzed softly on her lap.
A new message glowed on the screen.

Nathaniel Blackwood: (Focus on your awards. I’ll handle everything else.)

Her brow furrowed slightly.
How had Nathaniel discovered what was happening?

Three more notifications chimed in quick succession.

Nathaniel: (If I fail to save your brother, you may take my life.)

Nathaniel: (Trust me.)

Oliver: (Don’t worry, Mommy! Daddy and I will deal with the bad people. We’ve got your back! Bring home lots of trophies—Momo wants to see them!)

A wave of emotion washed over Isabella.
No one had ever stood behind her like this before.
Not in her entire life.
It felt… good.
Really good.
If Nathaniel said he would handle it, he would.
There was nothing Nathaniel Blackwood couldn’t solve.

She typed a quick reply: (Okay.)

Then she settled back into her seat.
Outwardly, she was the picture of calm.

Meanwhile, in a private hospital room…

Victoria Kensington had the awards ceremony streaming on the television.
Eleanor Kensington had stepped out briefly.
Half an hour ago, Seraphina Delacroix’s assistant had informed her—the plan had failed.
Worse, unless something major derailed the event, Isabella would soon be on that stage.
Accepting awards that should have been Victoria’s.

That stage was hers.
The spotlight was meant for her.
Yet here she was, trapped in a hospital bed, humiliated and in pain.
Isabella didn’t deserve any of it.

If Victoria couldn’t have it, neither could Isabella.

Driven by bitter rage, Victoria had paid men to kidnap Benjamin Kensington.
She’d waited for Isabella to panic and rush out of the ceremony.
She knew Isabella better than anyone.
Cold on the outside, but fiercely protective of the Montgomerys.
Why else would she have returned to torment Victoria?

Victoria eagerly anticipated the moment Isabella would flee.
She imagined Isabella being shoved off a cliff by those hired men.
The thought brought a twisted smile to her face.

But Isabella hadn’t moved.
Why wasn’t she leaving?

Had the kidnappers failed?

She snatched her phone and texted them: (What’s happening? Why is she still there?)

(How should I know? The bitch isn’t responding. I’ve got the guy and sent the message. Now pay up!)

Victoria’s jaw tightened. (Keep messaging her! Don’t stop!)

Back in the auditorium, Isabella’s phone lit up repeatedly.
Email after email flooded her screen.

(Isabella, if you don’t come now, I will kill him!)

(This is not a joke! I’ll make sure no evidence is left!)

(Look at this deep water! Don’t you think your brother is scared?)

(You have fifteen minutes! I’m not bluffing!)

Isabelle glanced dismissively at the screen.
A strange, unwavering faith had taken root inside her.
She trusted Nathaniel completely.
If he couldn’t save Benjamin, her presence would change nothing.
Nathaniel Blackwood was the most capable man in the world.

On stage, the host’s voice boomed through the hall.
“The next award is for 2020’s Most Popular Supermodel. The nominees are Genevieve Laurent, Sofia, Isabella Montgomery…”

Ten names were announced.
Their portraits flashed across the massive screen.

In her hospital bed, Victoria clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.
Why?
Why was Isabella still sitting there?
Why didn’t she care about her brother?
Watching Isabella win on that stage would be a fate worse than death.

“And the winner is…” the host paused for dramatic effect, “Isabella Montgomery!”

The name ‘Isabella Montgomery’ illuminated the screen.
Thunderous applause erupted throughout the venue.
Every spotlight and camera lens swiveled to focus on her.
###Chapter 242

Isabella Montgomery remained seated, a flawless smile gracing her lips as she faced the cameras. Her image dominated the massive screen while the host's voice echoed through the grand hall.

"Isabella Montgomery, age twenty-three, first captivated the global fashion scene at Chanel's Jewelry Exhibition. Her subsequent Guci campaign shattered sales records, surpassing last year's top model Victoria Kensington."

"Her appearance at the International Auto Show garnered tens of millions of followers! Her bridal photoshoot achieved unprecedented viral success! Isabella Montgomery is undoubtedly 2020's most celebrated supermodel! This recognition is truly deserved!"

"Let's give another round of applause for Isabella Montgomery!"

Thunderous applause erupted throughout the venue. The screen displayed a stunning array of Isabella's photographs, each showcasing her versatility and mastery of different styles. The applause intensified as fellow models acknowledged her superiority with genuine admiration. Her perfect features, diverse styling, and professional excellence placed her in a league far beyond their reach.

Beneath the admiring gazes of the audience, Isabella rose gracefully. Her long gown flowed behind her like liquid gold, catching the light with every movement. Standing at her full height, she radiated both beauty and regal confidence.

She embodied the ceremony's true royalty.

As she ascended the stage, a revered icon of the modeling industry presented her trophy. Beatrice Worthington, though in her seventies, maintained the elegance of a woman decades younger. Her presence exuded timeless grace and sophistication.

Isabella met the woman's gaze with equal poise. She accepted the trophy with a respectful bow. "Thank you," she stated with genuine appreciation.

Beatrice studied Isabella with keen admiration. "You truly are exceptional, my dear. So breathtaking it almost inspires envy! Does Ms. Montgomery have any words for everyone today?"

Isabella's fingers traced the weighty trophy before she turned toward the cameras. A confident smile touched her crimson lips. "Next year, this won't be enough."

Six words delivered with absolute conviction and power.

The venue erupted in renewed cheers and applause. Only Isabella could make such a bold declaration at this prestigious event. The Most Popular Supermodel Award carried immense honor. Was she already aiming for next year's Top Model title?

An audacious claim indeed!

In their hospital rooms, both Victoria Kensington and Seraphina Delacroix watched the ceremony with seething rage. This two-month modeling newcomer dared challenge them publicly! Worse, Isabella's radiance on stage was utterly maddening. Her flawless perfection provoked bitter jealousy.

How could such a woman be allowed to thrive? It was unacceptable!

Suddenly, all lights in the venue extinguished. Darkness enveloped the grand hall. Isabella's smile vanished as her instincts sharpened. Her eyes scanned the surroundings with heightened alertness.

A single spotlight illuminated her position. Another beam focused on the stage's rear entrance. There stood a man holding an enormous bouquet of roses, dressed in an impeccably tailored suit.

Alexander Whitmore!

Alexander here? Now?

What was happening?

Before Isabella could process the situation, Alexander advanced toward her. Each step echoed through the silent hall as spotlights tracked his movement. Under the brilliant lights, he resembled a storybook prince making a grand entrance.

The audience erupted in excited murmurs.

"Incredible!"

"Alexander Whitmore! Did he coordinate this with the organizers? A public apology to Isabella?"

"Heavens! This is so romantic!"

Throughout the murmuring crowd, women watched with dreamy admiration. While others swooned, Isabella's expression tightened. She stood perfectly still as he approached. "What are you doing here?"

Was this really about a public apology? No, something else had to be unfolding.
###Chapter 243

Just as anticipated, Alexander approached Isabella Montgomery.

His gaze appeared filled with admiration.

He had meticulously evaluated his circumstances over recent days.

The Whitmore family stocks had plummeted drastically.

Members of the Montgomery family began opposing his leadership.

Isabella represented his final opportunity for redemption.

Her breathtaking beauty certainly influenced his decision.

Marrying her would only benefit his position.

As for Victoria Kensington… Alexander had alternate arrangements.

"My dearest Isabella," he began, voice dripping with false sincerity.

"I deeply regret my past mistakes."

"I pledge to devote my entire life making amends."

"Please grant me another opportunity."

Each word sounded carefully rehearsed.

He finished speaking and dropped to one knee.

The bouquet of red roses extended toward her.

A velvet jewelry box rested among the blossoms.

Inside sparkled an enormous engagement ring.

The audience erupted into chaotic excitement.

"This is unbelievably romantic!"

"Alexander Whitmore proposing at such a prestigious event!"

"Victoria seduced him originally. Any man would struggle resisting her advances."

"Besides, everyone makes mistakes. What matters is he learned his lesson."

"Isabella, accept him! You're perfect for each other!"

"Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!"

The chant started with one person then spread like wildfire.

Soon the entire venue echoed with thunderous demands.

Isabella prepared to reject him immediately.

Then her eyes caught something hidden within the roses.

A photograph nestled among the thorns.

It showed her lying on an operating table.

Her pregnant belly swollen beneath surgical lights.

Alexander deliberately brought this photograph.

His gaze remained steady, lips curling triumphantly.

"Isabella, please accept my proposal."

His tone sounded pleading but carried hidden menace.

Only they understood the unspoken threat.

Her face drained of all color.

He blackmailed her with this incriminating evidence.

Rejecting him meant he would expose the photograph.

She had buried those painful memories years ago.

Forced herself to forget that traumatic period.

Now it resurfaced as leverage against her.

If this photograph became public knowledge…

The entire world would learn her secret.

Everyone would know she once carried a child.

No matter how strong she appeared…

She could not endure such humiliation publicly.

Christopher probably watched this broadcast.

What would her son think discovering this truth?

Would his illness relapse from the shock?

And Nathaniel…

Her mind swirled with chaotic emotions.

Meanwhile, Victoria watched from her hospital room.

Her fists clenched until knuckles turned white.

The IV needle tore from her skin.

Fresh blood trickled down her arm.

How could this happen?

Alexander proposing to Isabella?!

She loved him since their childhood days.

He struggled financially back then.

She never doubted his potential.

Her scheming served dual purposes.

Securing Montgomery inheritance benefited them both.

Becoming the legitimate heiress…

Acquiring family shares…

Marrying Alexander…

Solidifying his status…

Building their perfect life together…

Now he knelt before Isabella.

He discarded her completely.

Not one hospital visit since her admission.

Suddenly proposing to her rival!

Back at the Celestial Gala, Alexander remained kneeling.

His handsome features radiate confident expectation.

Isabella's eyes glazed with dull realization.

Must she accept him?

Was surrender her only option?

Accepting publicly meant binding herself to him permanently.
###Chapter 244

Isabella would never!

A strange glint flickered in Isabella's eyes. She stood before him and asked, "Are you certain you want to marry me? Have you truly understood your mistakes?"

"Yes." His reply was immediate and firm.

Isabella's lips curved into a smile. "Very well. I have three conditions. If you meet them, we can be married tonight," her voice rang clear and elegant.

Alexander's brows furrowed. An uneasy feeling settled in his chest. Three conditions? What could she possibly demand?

Meanwhile, at Ravencliff...

Roland Graves had expected Isabella's swift arrival. He didn't anticipate the luxury car that screeched to a halt, kicking up clouds of dust. "That must be her!" one of his men shouted. "Get into position!"

Everyone stood alert, their gazes sharp and wary. The car door swung open. Polished leather shoes touched the ground first, followed by long, refined legs.

Even without seeing his face, his commanding presence was undeniable. The man emerged fully and shut the door with a sharp motion.

When they recognized that stern, dark face, their limbs went weak. A collective shudder ran through the group.

It was Nathaniel Blackwood!

The man who held all of Westchester's power in his hands!

Two legends existed in Westchester. One was that Sebastian Blackwood killed and burned under cover of night. The other was that Nathaniel Blackwood burned cash in broad daylight.

These tales spoke volumes. Sebastian was the fearless king of the underworld, capable of any unspeakable act. Nathaniel didn't need to lift a finger. His wealth alone was overwhelming enough to warm himself with burning money.

Roland worked for Sebastian. His men were feared by many, but they never dared encroach on Nathaniel's territory. They knew to stay at least five hundred meters away from his domain.

Once, someone foolishly challenged Nathaniel's authority. That person harmed one of Nathaniel's men. The next day, the offender vanished without a trace.

Remembering this, Roland and his men felt cold dread. "Mr. Blackwood!" Roland stammered. "What brings you here?"

Anthony's gaze fixed on the figure behind them. Benjamin was tied to a tree branch. "Three seconds," Nathaniel commanded. "Release him."

Five words. Simple yet dripping with authority.

Roland and his men exchanged nervous glances. They wanted to comply, but they had risked everything for this kidnapping.

The client promised them five million. They hadn't had such a lucrative job in years. Letting him go now would waste all their effort.

Roland's eyes darted nervously. He hurried to the tree. "Mr. Blackwood, please understand our situation. We promise not to hurt him. We're just using him to lure a woman here. Once she arrives, we'll release him immediately!"

"It's not easy for us. We have families to feed too. If you force our hand, I'll have to end his life." He pulled out a dagger and pressed it against the rope.

One slice would send Benjamin plunging into the bottomless lake below.

Bound tightly, Benjamin couldn't move. Poison rendered his body useless. He watched Nathaniel with doubt and worry.

Who was this man? Was he here to save him? They had never met.

How could anyone save him under these circumstances?
###Chapter 245

Roland Graves and his men encircled Benjamin, suspended precariously above the water. Their eyes darted nervously toward Nathaniel Blackwood, filled with palpable dread.

Roland’s knife shook visibly in his unsteady grip. He swallowed hard, forcing out the words. “Boss Blackwood… I apologize for the disrespect. But you must see—we had no other option!”

“Time’s up.” Nathaniel’s mouth curved into a cold, faint smile.

Confusion flickered across the men’s faces—but it was too late. Nathaniel had already drawn a sleek, matte-black firearm from inside his tailored suit.

He raised it, aiming directly between Roland Graves’s eyes.

Roland’s gaze sharpened. He lifted the blade, ready to sever the rope. He was certain—Boss Blackwood would hesitate. He wouldn’t risk it.

Bang.

Nathaniel pulled the trigger.

Before the knife could even touch the rope, the bullet tore through Roland’s forehead. Blood sprayed.

Such impossible speed. It was over in less than a breath. He’d been stopped the instant he moved.

Roland’s body convulsed violently. The knife slipped from his fingers, vanishing into the dark lake below as he collapsed backward.

“Boss Graves!”

His remaining men scrambled to catch him. Thoughts of the promised five million vanished. Survival was all that mattered now. They dropped to their knees, begging.

“Forgive us, Boss Blackwood! We were wrong! This—this man is yours! Take him!”

They bowed low, dragging Roland’s body as they scrambled away, desperate to escape.

Nathaniel paid them no further mind. He tucked the weapon away and strode toward Benjamin. With a sharp tug, he loosened the knot securing the rope to the tree. Benjamin dropped heavily onto the grass.

Benjamin stared up, stunned. The man before him moved with lethal grace. Every gesture controlled, every action precise. Why would someone of his stature come to save him?

“Why did you help me?” Benjamin rasped, his voice weak.

Nathaniel looked down at him, a slight, almost imperceptible smile touching his lips. “I’m your brother-in-law.”

Five words. Delivered like a verdict. Quiet, yet burning with intensity.

Brother-in-law? Nathaniel Blackwood? His?

Benjamin ran through his sisters. Victoria—her reputation in ruins. Isabella—scandalized years ago. Sophia—still locked away, hidden from the world.

Which one could possibly be connected to Nathaniel Blackwood?

Just then, the door of the luxury car swung open. Oliver came running out on unsteady legs, his small voice urgent. “Daddy! Daddy, hurry! The bad man is proposing to Mommy!”

Proposing?

Nathaniel took the tablet from Oliver. On the screen, the glamour of the Celestial Gala unfolded. Alexander Whitmore was on one knee, holding out a massive bouquet of roses to Isabella.

Right on cue, her voice rang clear. “Alright. I have three conditions. Fulfill them, and we can be married tonight.”

Married. Tonight.

Was she actually considering it?

A man like Alexander would agree to anything—thirty conditions wouldn’t stop him.

Nathaniel’s fists clenched, his knuckles bleaching white. He was about to pull out his phone when Isabella began speaking again.

“First,” she stated, her tone icy and resolved. “You will testify publicly about every crime Victoria Kensington committed against me. You will personally ensure she is sent to prison.”
###Chapter 246

“First, kneel and apologize to me for everything you’ve done.”

“Second, tell everyone the truth about you and Victoria for the past fifteen years.”

“Third, transfer ninety-nine percent of your shares in Whitmore Enterprises to me.”

Her voice was steady, echoing through the grand hall.

Alexander’s expression froze instantly. Ninety-nine percent? She was demanding nearly everything. Did she intend to strip him of his entire company?

As for the first two conditions… He knew exactly what she meant. She wanted him to confess that Victoria was the real adopted daughter. That Victoria had paid a man to assault her all those years ago. If the truth came out, Victoria would be finished. The Montgomerys would cast her out. She would lose all claim to the family fortune and be sent directly to prison.

Even though Alexander hadn’t searched for Victoria and his feelings had cooled, they had still grown up together. She was his first love, the woman he had cherished most. How could he be the one to utterly destroy her?

Seeing his hesitation, a cold, mocking smile touched Isabella’s lips. “Alexander, you claim to have seen the error of your ways, yet you can’t even meet these basic demands. How can I possibly agree to marry you?”

Her words sparked murmurs through the crowd.

“What else did Victoria do to Isabella? Was it something criminal?”

“That’s not the point. The point is he’s clearly still protecting her. He’s still in love with Victoria!”

“Ugh. I wouldn’t want a husband like that. Isabella, think carefully!”

The court of public opinion had shifted.

Alexander’s face darkened further. “Isabella,” he warned, his voice low, “don’t push this too far. I promise I will cut all ties with her. Can’t we just let the past stay in the past? Regarding the shares, I can give you forty percent. Please, be reasonable. I don’t want us to part on bad terms.”

He emphasized ‘part on bad terms’ as he thrust the bouquet toward her again. A silent threat. If she remained stubborn, he would release the photos.

Isabella’s smile turned condescending. Did he truly believe she was so easily manipulated?

Suddenly, she dropped to one knee, her posture a mirror of his proposal, but her eyes held a chilling intensity. She spoke, her voice a whisper meant only for his ears. “If you’re here asking me to let the past go, why are you using it to threaten me? Do you really think I’m afraid? At worst, you release those photos and we all burn together. And today, I will make Victoria take a DNA test with the Montgomery family.”

She moved to snatch the photo hidden within the roses.

Alexander’s composure shattered. She was calling his bluff! She would rather drag everyone down with her than marry him!

If she preemptively exposed herself and accused Victoria of framing her, the public would turn on Victoria instantly. Her recent scandals had already eroded her credibility. And a DNA test…

No. It was too soon. Victoria hadn’t secured the majority of the Montgomery shares. Their plans weren’t in place.

Alexander shot to his feet, yanking the bouquet back before her fingers could close around the damning evidence. “Isabella,” he said, his voice strained but loud enough for the crowd, “if you need more time, I will give it to you. Whether it takes ten days or ten years, I will wait for your answer.”

He pressed the roses into her hands but kept the engagement ring, quickly pocketing it along with the hidden photo.

The audience was left bewildered, their brows furrowed in confusion. What just happened? Why did he suddenly back down? What had she said to him?

Nathaniel’s gaze was the most intense. He could read lips. He had seen every word Isabella uttered.

‘Release the photos?’ What photos was Alexander threatening her with? ‘Burn together?’ What did Alexander have that could destroy her?

Her conditions mentioned events from five years ago. What truly happened five years ago?

His sharp eyes shifted to Benjamin. His voice was a low, dangerous rumble. “What happened to Isabella five years ago?” He would find out. He would eliminate every single threat against her.
###Chapter 247

Nathaniel would make Alexander pay for threatening his woman.

At the mention of the incident five years ago, Benjamin’s expression turned grim. Though he didn’t particularly like his sister Isabella, it was still a family matter. Outsiders should never learn the ugly truth—especially when it involved Isabella’s reputation.

Benjamin averted his gaze. “I don’t know.”

“You don’t know?” Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed dangerously. His piercing stare seemed to emit sharp, cold light.

Benjamin hesitated under the intensity. “I was only thirteen back then. I really don’t know anything. If you’re curious, ask Isabella yourself.” He closed his eyes, avoiding further confrontation.

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened. Clearly, Benjamin was hiding something.

What really happened five years ago? Why wouldn’t he talk?

Meanwhile, Oliver pouted angrily. “Daddy, he’s so rude! How dare he call Mommy by her first name?”

“Don’t dwell on it. You must call him Uncle.” Nathaniel composed himself and ruffled Oliver’s hair. Then he reached down and helped Benjamin to his feet.

Oliver scoffed. “Uncle?”

Goosebumps rose on Benjamin’s skin. ‘Uncle’? The infamous little terror of Westchester was calling him ‘Uncle’? Was this a joke? And why did the kid keep calling Isabella ‘Mommy’? Was he really her son?

That couldn’t be. The baby Isabella gave birth to five years ago was dead…

As Benjamin wrestled with his thoughts, Nathaniel placed Oliver in the backseat. Oliver tried to climb into the front, but Nathaniel stopped him. “Stay in the back. This seat is for Mommy.”

“Oh, okay!” Thinking of Isabella, Oliver obediently scooted back and sat beside Benjamin.

But the moment he looked at Benjamin, Oliver turned away haughtily. “Hmph! I don’t want a rude and weak uncle like you.”

Benjamin was speechless.

He didn’t want a nephew like that either. Weak? He could have taken all those kidnappers if they hadn’t outnumbered him and drugged him. Still, looking closer, Oliver did bear a slight resemblance to Isabella—especially around the eyes and mouth. He looked a lot like Isabella as a child.

Could Oliver really be Isabella’s son?

But he had seen the stillborn baby with his own eyes. The infant wasn’t breathing at birth, its face purplish and lifeless. How could it have survived? It must just be a coincidence.

The car pulled into an alley a short distance from the Celestial Gala venue. Evelyn was waiting under a tree with Isabella. Oliver’s text had put Isabella at ease. Spotting the car, Isabella waved to Evelyn. “You can go home now. Get some rest.”

“Alright.” Evelyn opened the car door for her, her admiration for Isabella growing even more.

As Isabella got in, Oliver exclaimed excitedly, “Mommy! Mommy! You were the most gorgeous one on stage tonight! You stood out from everyone! I’m your number one fan!”

“Thank you, Momo. Fasten your seatbelt. We’ll talk more at home,” Isabella said gently.

“Okay!” Oliver diligently fastened his seatbelt.

Benjamin watched Oliver’s behavior with a furrowed brow. The arrogant little Blackwood was so well-behaved around Isabella. And Nathaniel Blackwood seemed to dote on her…

Filled with suspicion, Benjamin finally asked, “Isabella, what’s your relationship with them?”
###Chapter 248

“My personal affairs are none of your concern,” Isabella’s voice dropped low. “Focus on yourself.”

She suddenly remembered something and turned to Nathaniel. “Head to the Montgomery Manor first. Drop him off there.”

“Understood.” Nathaniel adjusted the steering wheel.

“I refuse to go back to the Montgomery Manor!” Benjamin protested urgently.

“Do you want a repeat of tonight? Can you guarantee your own safety?” Isabella countered sharply.

Benjamin fell silent, her words hitting a nerve. After a moment, he insisted, “I’d rather die than return there!”

“That’s exactly what they want,” Isabella scoffed.

Victoria had subtly spoiled Benjamin since childhood. She encouraged his school truancy, facilitated his gaming addiction, and even formed a team to enable his habits. Consequently, Benjamin wasted a decade on games while neglecting his education.

To him, Victoria was his only true friend who supported his gaming ambitions. He trusted her completely, unaware of the malicious intentions beneath her sugary facade.

Benjamin frowned at her tone. “I won’t deny Victoria made a huge mistake, but it’s only because she loved Alexander too much. She’s not inherently evil—nothing like what you imply! She treated me wonderfully all these years.”

Isabella merely scoffed, unwilling to explain further. It wasn’t the right time, and he wouldn’t believe her anyway. Besides, Benjamin couldn’t stay outside; it was too dangerous. Isabella had numerous enemies, and she still didn’t know if Victoria or Seraphina was behind Benjamin’s kidnapping.

“Regardless, you’re staying at the manor for now,” Isabella insisted firmly. “I’ll convince Grandpa to let you game at home.”

“Impossible! Don’t even try! Just take me to the Elite Gaming Club,” Benjamin retorted coldly.

He had pleaded with his family about gaming countless times since childhood. He dreamed of becoming a professional gamer, entering the national esports scene, and making a name for himself. Yet no one ever supported him. How could Isabella possibly succeed where he failed?

Isabella glanced at him briefly before pulling out her phone to text Theodore Montgomery. Moments later, Benjamin’s phone rang.

“Benjamin,” Theodore’s voice came through the speaker, “come home immediately. Bring your gaming equipment. I’ll allow you to game at home and won’t force studies on you anymore.”

Benjamin’s eyes widened in shock. He stared blankly for several seconds.

Did he hear correctly? Grandpa actually permitted gaming at home and wouldn’t force studies? Grandpa was the most traditional figure in the family, always insisting his only grandson focus on business school to eventually take over the family empire.

Yet suddenly, he was supportive…

He looked at Isabella incredulously. “What did you tell Grandpa?”

A faint smile touched her lips. “I said what needed to be said. You don’t need the details. Just stay home, understood?”

As they spoke, the car approached near the manor’s main entrance. “Stop here,” Isabella instructed.

Nathaniel pulled over immediately, turning the wheel smoothly.

Isabella turned to Benjamin. “Can you walk?”

The drug’s effects had worn off by now. He opened the door and stepped out.

“I’ll escort him in,” Isabella told Nathaniel. “Wait here for me.”

“Alright,” Nathaniel replied in his low, husky voice, offering no further comment.

As Isabella exited the car, Nathaniel’s gaze lingered thoughtfully on her retreating figure. Clearly, she wanted a private conversation with Benjamin—likely concerning that incident from five years ago. At The Ritz-Carlton, she had warned him not to pry into her privacy. Benjamin likewise refused to disclose details. What truly happened five years ago?

Oliver’s small head popped up from the backseat. “Daddy, should I go with them?”
###Chapter 249

“Don’t,” Nathaniel’s voice was low and firm. “We must respect her privacy.”

Even though every fiber of his being screamed to uncover the truth, Nathaniel would never pry. Not unless Isabella chose to confide in him herself.

Benjamin simply nodded and slipped into the car, waiting quietly.

Outside the Montgomery estate…

Isabella and Benjamin walked side by side along the tall iron fence. As they reached the gate, Isabella stopped and turned to him. “Not a word to anyone about Nathaniel saving you today. Or about my connection to him.”

Benjamin’s brow furrowed. “Why?”

These were two of the most powerful people in the city. Anyone else would flaunt such an association. Why was she deliberately hiding it?

A dark suspicion crossed his mind. “Isabella,” he said urgently, “tell me the truth. Are you his mistress?”

His mistress?

She shot him a sharp, icy glare. “Do I look like the type to be anyone’s mistress?”

“Then why the secrecy?” he pressed. “And why did that boy call you ‘Mommy’?”

Isabella’s gaze flickered toward the luxury car idling in the distance. Her voice dropped to a hushed tone. “That’s none of your concern. I have my reasons. My own plans. If you breathe a word of this to anyone, I will make sure Grandfather reconsiders his decision about you.”

With that, she turned to leave.

Benjamin quickly grabbed her arm, his expression grave. “I don’t care what’s between you and Nathaniel Blackwood. But you need to understand… it can never work. He asked me about what happened five years ago. I didn’t tell him anything. But if he ever finds out the truth, he will leave you. You should end it now, before you get hurt.”

Isabella’s brow furrowed slightly. So Nathaniel had been asking about the past. After the scene Alexander caused at the Celestial Gala, it wasn’t entirely surprising.

She pulled her arm free from his grasp. “I know what I’m doing.”

Benjamin watched her walk away, a complex mix of emotions swirling within him. The Isabella he remembered was the girl everyone looked down on, the one who had supposedly betrayed Alexander five years ago. Now she was involved with Nathaniel Blackwood? She was wealthy and powerful in her own right. Why would she choose this path? It wasn’t his business anyway. She was just an adopted member of the family. They weren’t even related by blood…

Isabella returned to the car. Out of habit, her hand moved toward the passenger door. But Benjamin’s warning echoed in her mind. She changed direction and slid into the backseat instead.

Nathaniel’s eyes flicked to the rearview mirror, noting the change. He said nothing, simply starting the engine and pulling away.

Inside the car, Oliver was curled against Isabella’s side. He peeked at Nathaniel in the front seat, then at Isabella beside him. Deciding to play asleep, he closed his eyes tightly. Soon, soft, rhythmic snores escaped him, like a contented little kitten.

Isabella gently brushed the hair from his forehead, her heart aching with a familiar sorrow. If her own child had lived, he would be about Oliver’s age now. How wonderful it would be to watch him grow. To be his mother.

But would Nathaniel ever be able to accept her past?

She caught herself. Cough. What was she thinking? Wanting Nathaniel’s acceptance? What was wrong with her?

The car came to a stop at a red light. Nathaniel glanced up, his eyes meeting hers in the rearview mirror. After a moment of silence, he spoke. “Julian threatened you today?”

Isabella gave a noncommittal hum, not really wanting to discuss it.

Nathaniel’s voice was steady, his gaze intense even through the reflection. “No matter how difficult the situation,” he said, “you can always come to me.”
###Chapter 250

Nothing in this world was beyond Nathaniel Blackwood's reach. Isabella Montgomery only needed to speak the words.

As the memory of the incident replayed in her mind, Isabella leaned back into the plush seat, a wave of exhaustion washing over her. "It's a trivial issue," she stated flatly. "I'll handle it myself." She closed her eyes immediately after, a clear dismissal. She wanted no further discussion on the matter.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened, a flicker of concern shadowing his features. He hadn't seen her this visibly perturbed in a long while. Yet, if she chose not to confide in him, he would wait. He had infinite patience for her.

Meanwhile…

Victoria Kensington was locked in a bathroom stall, her voice a tense half-whisper into her phone. "What do you mean they all ran? They refused the money?"

"Yes," confirmed Penelope Sinclair on the other end. "They claimed Boss Blackwood intervened to save Benjamin."

Victoria's fist slammed against the cold marble sink. Damn it! While Alexander Whitmore was making a grand, public spectacle of proposing to Isabella, Nathaniel was quietly solving her problems in the shadows. What had that woman done to earn such unwavering devotion from two of the most powerful men?

The sheer injustice of it was enough to make her blood boil. To make it worse, Alexander wasn't even answering her calls anymore. The distance he was putting between them was painfully obvious.

She forced her voice to steady. "Did you acquire the perfume as I instructed?"

"Yes, but the final bid at auction escalated to ninety million. Are you absolutely certain you wish to proceed?" Penelope's tone was cautious.

Ninety million for a bottle of perfume! It felt like daylight robbery.

With Isabella having seized the majority of her assets, Victoria's financial reserves were critically low. This perfume, however, could be the key to turning everything around…

"Purchase it. At any cost!" she commanded, her voice sharp. "I'll arrange the transfer. Just secure it."

"Understood."

The moment the call ended, Victoria's heart ached with the financial blow. She was forced to liquidate a significant portion of her remaining luxury—a collection of over ten limited-edition handbags and several jewelry sets—selling them at a steep discount to a wealthy socialite acquaintance just to scrape together the exorbitant sum.

Once the transaction was confirmed, a vicious, calculating smile twisted her lips. The sting of the cost was real, a physical pain. But she would make this perfume earn its weight in gold, and then some. She picked up her phone again, her fingers swiftly searching for Nathaniel Blackwood's private contact details.

That evening, the aftermath of the Celestial Gala ignited fierce debates across social media. Seraphina Delacroix's conspicuous absence. Arabella Fontaine's shocking ascent to claim the title of No.1 Supermodel and the Award for Most Commercial Value. And, most explosively, the swirling rumors concerning Isabella Montgomery and Alexander Whitmore.

#AlexanderWhitmore-Proposed
#Isabellas-3-Demands
#Was-Alexander-Sincere
#The-Incident-5-Years-Ago

These hashtags dominated the trending lists. Of course, topics like #Isabellas-Gown, #Phoenix, and #D.K also fought for attention high on the charts.

Even though Isabella had only received a relatively minor award, her presence and the scandals surrounding her completely overshadowed nearly every other attendee.

In a sterile hospital room, Seraphina Delacroix seethed, scrolling through the online frenzy from her sickbed.

"That conniving little opportunist, Arabella! She capitalized on my absence! That top model title would never have been hers if I were there!

"And that gown! Someone paid a fortune for it. How did that wretch Isabella get her hands on it? What did she have to do to wear it?

"That bitch! Demanding ninety-nine percent of his company shares? It's nothing but a cheap publicity stunt!"

Fury contorted Seraphina's features as she viciously pummeled her pillow.

"Ms. Delacroix, the doctor stressed the importance of rest and calm for your recovery," her assistant ventured cautiously, trying to soothe her. "This anger isn't helping. The company's current crisis is the more pressing matter. Numerous artists are threatening to terminate their contracts. Arabella, in particular, has become insufferably arrogant since winning that award tonight. She's publicly slandering our company, calling us fraudulent and manipulative, claiming we forced her into unethical situations."

"Hmph! She owes her entire career to this company. Dreaming of leaving? She can rot first!" Seraphina snarled, her teeth gritted.

After a moment of fuming silence, she looked up, a malicious glint in her eyes. "Wait. Weren't there persistent rumors about Arabella and Director Hue?"

"Yes, they were substantiated. I personally witnessed them together on one occasion…" the assistant confirmed.

A slow, cruel smile spread across Seraphina's face. "Let her terminate her contract. She can leave only after she pays the full termination penalty in blood! And then… let her scurry off to Isabella's new little venture."

"To GoldenPhoenix? Ms. Delacroix, are you sure? That seems…" her assistant trailed off, bewildered.

"You're the one who's lost your mind! Didn't Isabella want to challenge a giant with a pebble? Didn't she boast about poaching my artists? Fine. Let her have them. This time, I will ensure her precious GoldenPhoenix is buried for good."

Pure, unadulterated malice shone in Seraphina's eyes, mixed with a cold, calculated evil.
###Chapter 251

Isabella’s phone buzzed early the next morning.
It was Julian Hawthorne.
“SilverPeak just terminated contracts with several artists,” he informed her. “Arabella Fontaine is among them. They’re all demanding to see you. They need your signature to finalize the termination. The compensation amounts are massive—these are top-tier supermodels. My assistants can’t handle them.”

“Understood,” Isabella replied. “I’ll be there soon.”
She turned and glanced at the bed.
Nathaniel and Oliver were both still asleep.
They must have stayed up late.
Oliver hadn’t woken early to paint.
He was curled in the middle of the bed, breathing softly.
Nathaniel lay on the inner side, one arm draped protectively over the boy.
Their profiles, one strong and one delicate, looked like carved jade in the soft morning light.
A warm smile touched Isabella’s lips unconsciously.
She slipped out of bed carefully, not wanting to disturb them.

Shortly after she left, Nathaniel’s phone vibrated on the nightstand.
His eyes opened instantly.
A message glowed on the screen.

[Good morning, Mr. Blackwood. This is Victoria Kensington.
I believe you should know what happened five years ago.
Has Isabella told you? Probably not.
She prefers to handle things alone.
She’s always been fiercely independent.
But Alexander Whitmore has gone too far lately.
He left me, and now he’s threatening Isabella with evidence from that night.
He’s trying to force her to marry him.
What he has… it tortures her.
It could make her do anything—even things she would never choose.
If he becomes desperate, he might drag her down with him.
Destroy her completely.
You’re the only one who can stop this.
Meet me at The Ivy at 2 p.m.]

Nathaniel’s gaze turned icy.
He had never wanted to pry into Isabella’s secrets.
But this message changed things.
How severe was the incident five years ago?
It seemed he had to find out.
He pulled up Dominic Sterling’s contact.
“Clear my afternoon schedule,” he ordered.

Meanwhile…
Victoria grinned when she saw her message had been read.
She was officially discharged from the hospital.
Though a patch of her hair had been shaved, it was easily hidden with a wig.
No one would notice the scar.
And she had the perfume.
That special perfume.
Created by an expert, it stripped away a person’s self-control.
Made them act on impulse.
If a woman with a child could seduce Nathaniel Blackwood, so could she.
Anything Isabella could have, Victoria would take.
Once she slept with him, she would have leverage.
Even if he didn’t want her, she could demand a massive settlement.
Enough to buy Jordan family shares if her father refused to give them to her.
She needed to seize control before Isabella exposed everything.
And…
She placed a hand on her abdomen.
She was in her fertile window.
If she got pregnant with his child…
The Jordans’ disdain wouldn’t matter anymore.
She’d be set for life.
With renewed excitement, she began selecting her outfit.

Isabella arrived at GoldenPhoenix.
Only Arabella Fontaine was waiting in her office.
Arabella was known for her gentle demeanor.
She was SilverPeak’s second most valued artist.
Her voice was soft, almost melodic.
She gave off the aura of moonlight—calm and serene.
But SilverPeak had marketed her as a foodie.
At every event, she had to eat.
And eat.
And keep eating.
All to win audience approval and build her brand.
Arabella despised the persona.
But she had no choice—the company enforced it.
That character won her the Most-Likeable Supermodel Award.
It brought endorsements and customer loyalty to SilverPeak.
Last year, she received the ‘Most Commercial-Valued’ award.
This year, she was crowned ‘No. 1 Supermodel’.
Isabella studied her with a curious frown.
“Why are you here?” she asked. “Did you manage to terminate your contract? Is SilverPeak really letting you go?”
###Chapter 252

Arabella shifted slightly, a flicker of unease crossing her features before she quickly composed herself.

“I heard Mr. Hawthorne and Mr. Sinclair mentioned GoldenPhoenix doesn’t force personas on artists. Does that mean we can be authentic?”

“Correct. I reviewed your portfolio. Maintain your elegant, intellectual style. You’ll lead the Celestial Gala this year.” Isabella’s tone remained strictly professional.

“Seriously?” Arabella gasped, her eyes widening in disbelief.

The Celestial Gala was a massive annual tradition. Thousands paraded through heritage sites in historical attire, a spectacle known worldwide. Victoria Kensington always held the lead position—no one else ever got it. Even when Arabella participated before, she was relegated to second or third row. They even forced her to sneak snacks during the event, drawing harsh criticism from traditionalists.

Now she would lead?

Isabella responded with practiced calm. “Yes. No need to worry. We won’t force binge-eating antics. Drop the ‘foodie’ persona entirely. Ask if you have further questions.”

A sudden thought struck Arabella. “Does this apply to all models?”

“Equal treatment for everyone.” Six words, delivered with crisp efficiency.

Isabella handed her several files. Arabella accepted them, scanning the detailed plans for herself and other top models. Each plan eliminated forced personas and tailored opportunities to their natural strengths. Far superior to SilverPeak’s proposals!

Arabella stayed behind, representing the others, to review GoldenPhoenix’s full strategy. Every detail was meticulously crafted.

She stood, extending her hand. “President Montgomery, I look forward to our collaboration.”

“Likewise.” Isabella shook her hand firmly. “Remember to inform the others: if these high-value contracts fail, I stand to lose the most.” A faint, confident smile touched Isabella’s lips as she exited.

The reminder hit Arabella. The termination clauses were nearly a billion per model. Isabella paid them all upfront. If they underperformed, her losses would be staggering. Yet she invested massively, offered bespoke plans, and took minimal commission. What was her real goal?

Watching Isabella leave, Arabella realized she was different. Not like other models. Not like any manager she’d ever met.

After the meeting, Isabella headed to another office to meet Julian Hawthorne and Adrian Sinclair. Julian was absent, but Adrian’s face lit up upon seeing her. “Isabella! Finally free to visit?” he greeted warmly. “Has it really been five years?”

“What’s this? Miss me? Need me checking in on you?” she teased lightly.

Adrian hastily fastened his top button. “No need! I’ve been buried in work. And you, since Victoria’s exposure! The paparazzi must be hounding you. No time to check on anyone else.”

Isabella’s expression darkened at Victoria’s mention. The paparazzi had indeed swarmed, seeking interviews she consistently declined. Perhaps a public appearance was needed soon. To shame the couple properly.

Adrian’s tone turned serious. “Speaking of Victoria… the news reminded me of something from five years ago. Something I should have warned you about. That night… I saw Victoria meeting a man. They were talking privately.”

“A man?” Isabella’s brow furrowed. She gripped his wrist tightly. “What did he look like?”
###Chapter 253

Adrian watched her reaction with amusement. "I've never seen you so worked up before," he teased. "So you do have feelings after all."

They had maintained contact over the past five years, but the Isabella he knew now was completely different from the woman he remembered. She had transformed into someone who rarely showed emotion, as if nothing could penetrate her icy exterior.

Isabella's brow furrowed slightly. Before returning to the city, she hadn't cared about finding that man. She only wanted closure. But after spending time with Nathaniel, her hatred had grown into something visceral and consuming.

She released her grip on Adrian's wrist, composing herself. "Of course I care. A monster like that shouldn't be allowed to walk free. He's a danger to everyone."

"Always the responsible CEO," Adrian remarked. His expression turned serious. "But at the club, we were too far apart. I only caught a glimpse of him through the crowd. Couldn't see his face clearly. The only thing I noticed was that he was one of Sebastian's men."

"Sebastian Blackwood?" Isabella's eyes narrowed.

Adrian nodded. "The man wore a distinctive half-moon ring. I remember it because the design caught my eye. It was the Blackthorn Syndicate's symbol. If you want to investigate, have Maxwell and his team put pressure on them. You might find some leads."

Isabella considered this. Putting pressure on the syndicate sounded like a solid plan.

Just as she was about to act, her phone rang urgently. Maxwell's excited voice came through. "Boss Montgomery! That Nightshade formula you developed last year just sold for ninety million! You'll never guess who bought it!"

"Not interested," Isabella said flatly. She had created the formula out of boredom and hadn't cared about its fate.

Maxwell sounded disappointed. "It was your sister Victoria! She even arranged to meet Boss Blackwood at The Ivy! Room 999!"

"What?" Isabella's expression darkened. "She's meeting Nathaniel?"

The Nightshade perfume had powerful aphrodisiac properties. This could lead to disastrous consequences. "Forget about Nathaniel for now," she ordered. "I want you to round up every member of the Blackthorn Syndicate. Leave no one behind."

"All of them? Boss, are you serious-"

Beep, beep, beep!

Isabella ended the call without waiting for his response. She didn't have time to explain further to Adrian as she strode out of the building, already dialing Nathaniel's number.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel sat in the back of his luxury car as Dominic drove into The Ivy's parking lot. His eyes were closed, but Isabella's words from their confrontation at The Ritz-Carlton echoed in his mind. She had made it clear she didn't want his involvement, and as a man of honor, he should respect that.

But someone had threatened her. How could he possibly stay out of it?

As he wrestled with his thoughts...

Ring, ring! His phone vibrated, the screen displaying the caller ID: (Wife).
###Chapter 254

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. Isabella never called him. “What is it?” he answered, voice guarded.

She was already on her motorcycle, phone pressed between her shoulder and ear. “Don’t meet Victoria. Ask me anything you want when you get home. I’ll tell you everything.”

His expression darkened. “You know?”

“There’s little I don’t. Nathaniel, if you don’t want to be my enemy, come home now. I’ll be waiting. Victoria is setting a trap. Don’t go.” She ended the call.

She was certain he would return. With that handled, Isabella used a burner phone to text Alexander.

[Victoria Kensington collapsed in room 999 at The Ivy. She only left your number.]

Her eyes turned cold after sending it. Knowing Alexander, he would investigate. If they slept together, the scandal would be everywhere. Those two deserved each other. With Alexander occupied by Victoria, he would stop bothering her.

Did Victoria really think she could seduce a man even Isabella hesitated to touch? Not a chance.

Meanwhile, at The Ivy…

Victoria wore a crimson dress with a deep V-neck. Her alluring figure and innocent face were a devastating combination. She smirked at the Nightshade perfume in the corner.

The perfume was potent. Victoria had tested it. Applied five minutes before his arrival, it would shatter any man’s self-control. The scent would fill the air, working quickly.

But she was growing impatient. “What’s happening?” she called Penelope. “Is Nathaniel here?”

“Yes, his car just entered the parking lot,” Penelope confirmed.

Victoria hung up and sprayed the perfume. She had also placed childhood photos of Isabella. Nathaniel’s interest in Isabella would make him look. Before he finished, the scent and her presence would overwhelm him. Soon, she would be his. Pregnant with his heir. She would control the Montgomery family through him. Or at least secure a massive fortune.

She positioned the hidden camera, took the antidote for the scent, and waited on the sofa. Twenty minutes passed. The antidote was wearing off. Her vision blurred. Heat spread through her body.

Click.

The door opened. A tall, powerful figure entered.

Victoria looked up. Nathaniel’s handsome face captivated her. Her body burned, but a sliver of rationality remained. Wait. Let the scent affect him. Let him make the first move.

He walked toward her. He didn’t notice her flushed state. He didn’t speak. He picked up the photo album on the table and began flipping through it.

Halfway through, his movements slowed. His gaze finally landed on her.

Victoria stood. Her voice was a sweet, seductive whisper. “Mr. Blackwood…”

The sound was intoxicating. His Adam’s apple moved. He closed the distance between them.

Finally. She had succeeded. She was Nathaniel’s woman. She would never wait for Alexander again.
###Chapter 255

Isabella Montgomery pulled up to the Blackwood Estate on her motorcycle. She spotted Oliver in the living room, intently focused on his laptop.

She approached cautiously. “Christopher, where’s your father?”

“Daddy went out earlier and hasn’t returned. Why are you home so soon, Mommy?” Oliver set aside his device and hurried toward her. He lifted his arms expectantly. Isabella instinctively scooped him up. “Did your father drive himself?” she pressed, a frown forming. “Or was Dominic with him?”

“Uncle Dominic was driving,” Oliver replied.

Isabella quickly calculated the timing. Dominic typically drove around 40 kilometers per hour. The trip from the estate to The Ivy should have taken no more than 25 minutes. She had been gone for half an hour—so why wasn’t Nathaniel back yet? Had she misjudged the situation? Maybe he hadn’t heeded her warning and went to meet Victoria after all. A surge of unease shot through her. She set Oliver down on the sofa and pulled out her phone to call Nathaniel.

Beep, beep, beep!

The line rang, then went to voicemail. A robotic voice informed her, “The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.”

Isabella’s frown deepened. No answer. Could Nathaniel actually be in trouble? She turned back to Oliver. “Do you have Uncle Dominic’s number?”

“Sorry, Mommy, I don’t,” Oliver said, his expression growing anxious. “Mommy, do you think something happened to Daddy? When he left this morning, he said he had a very important meeting—something about your future happiness. He left in a rush and cleared his entire afternoon schedule. I tried calling him ten minutes ago too, but he didn’t answer. He still hasn’t called me back.”

Isabella’s concern spiked. No answer for ten whole minutes? Nathaniel was notoriously reliable. It was completely unlike him to miss calls—especially twice. Something was definitely wrong. She faced Oliver immediately. “Christopher, stay here, okay? Mommy is going to find Daddy.”

“Okay!” Oliver nodded vigorously.

Isabella snatched her motorcycle keys and bolted for the door. Her mind raced with thoughts of the Nightshade perfume’s potent effects. She had developed it herself; she knew its power better than anyone. Ordinary drugs might cause discomfort and weaken resolve, but a strong will could sometimes fight them off. Nightshade was different. It induced powerful hallucinations, warping the victim’s perception of reality, making them see someone else entirely. It attacked the mind directly. No amount of willpower could resist its grip. If Nathaniel had been with Victoria because of her own creation…

The mere idea sent a white-hot fury coursing through her. So consumed was she by her thoughts that she didn’t see the solid figure blocking her path until she collided with a hard wall of muscle.

Staggering back, Isabella looked up, her brow furrowing in instant recognition. It was Nathaniel! He stood there, aloof and impeccably handsome in his tailored suit, looking completely unruffled.

“You’re back?” she asked, her voice tight. “Why weren’t you answering your phone?”

“Hmm?” Nathaniel noted her flustered state, then his gaze shifted to Oliver.

Just ten minutes prior, Nathaniel had used Dominic’s phone to check on Oliver. He’d explained his own phone had malfunctioned and specifically instructed the boy to reassure Isabella if she returned home early.

Meeting his father’s questioning look, Oliver flashed a mischievous grin. “Daddy, I told Mommy you were in trouble. She was rushing out to find you. See? Mommy does care about you! Have fun!” With a gleeful chuckle, he scampered off on his short legs.

Isabella stood frozen, completely dumbfounded.

The little schemer had tricked her.

A visible lightness seemed to wash over Nathaniel’s features. His eyes locked on hers, a teasing glint in their depths. “You were worried about me?”
###Chapter 256

Four words. Spoken in a low, husky tone that carried an unexpected tenderness.

Isabella’s cheeks flushed. She turned and walked toward the sofa, forcing an air of calm. “I was just concerned you might get bitten by that snake. You’re still my contractual partner, after all.”

Just contractual partners? That was a weak excuse.

Nathaniel’s lips curved into a faint smile as he watched her. “Isabella, admitting you care about me—or even worry about me—isn’t something to be ashamed of.”

Cough, cough. His choice of words was… bold.

“Care about you? In your dreams!” Isabella denied it vehemently. “I was worried you’d get hurt because of me. I don’t want to owe you anything.”

Nathaniel gave a slight smirk but said nothing. He took off his jacket, hung it on the coat stand, then moved to sit beside her. “If I really had been bitten… would you look down on me?”

Look down on him?

Isabella frowned. “What about you?” Her gaze was serious, darker than usual.

His lips tightened slightly. “Do you really think I’m that shallow?” His voice was deep and steady, piercing straight through her. His expression was solemn—not dismissive in the least.

For a moment, Isabella almost believed him. But what man in the world wouldn’t care about something like that?

A faint smile touched her lips. “Whether it’s true or not, only you would know. But why did you agree to meet Victoria today? Was it because you wanted to know what happened five years ago?”

At that, Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. He reached for his phone to show her something, but it had suddenly stopped working. He fixed her with a questioning look. “What if I said I only wanted to help you solve your problems? Would you believe me?”

Solve her problems?

Isabella was sharp. She understood almost instantly. “Victoria is a fraud. You can’t trust a word she says. As for what happened five years ago… it’s not a big deal. But if you really want to know, I can tell you.” She picked up the glass of water from the coffee table and took a sip.

Nathaniel watched her closely. Drinking before speaking—she was nervous. She wasn’t ready.

Just as she set the glass down and opened her mouth to speak, he cut in. “You don’t have to tell me. I just want to know one thing: Does that incident force you to make choices you don’t want to make? Or… does it still cause you pain?” His tone was full of genuine concern.

Isabella’s lips curved slightly. “If it did, why would I have spent so much time with him on stage last night at the ceremony? As for pain…”

She met his gaze, her voice low and intense. “The more you ask, the more it hurts. Even if you knew everything—even with all your resources—you couldn’t fix it.”

“Nathaniel, like I’ve told you before, some things in this world can’t be solved with money or power. Material problems are easy. Matters of the heart… are much harder to untangle.”

It was rare for Isabella to speak to him with such gravity. Nathaniel’s expression grew somber. He had never seen her this serious.

After a moment, he nodded. “I understand. From now on, I won’t pry. But if you ever decide you want to tell me… I’ll be here.”

Isabella’s brow furrowed. He wasn’t going to ask anymore?

Suddenly, Maxwell burst into the room, his voice bursting with excitement. “Boss Isabella! Big news! Huge breaking news!”
###Chapter 257

“What’s going on?” Isabella’s brow furrowed. Why were her people so jumpy lately?

Maxwell blurted out, “You won’t believe who Victoria slept with! It was Harrison—Alexander’s personal assistant!”

Isabella’s eyes narrowed. Harrison?

Now that was interesting. She had sent the message to Alexander, but he sent his assistant instead?

And Victoria wanted Nathaniel, but ended up with Harrison?

Maxwell asked, “Should we leak this? Or let Alexander handle it himself?” If this got out, Victoria’s reputation would be ruined.

“No. We watch. Where’s the fun in ending her too quickly?” A cold smile touched her lips, beautiful and dangerous.

A thought struck her. She glanced toward Nathaniel’s room and stepped back into her own. Closing the door, she asked, “What about the task I gave you earlier?”

“I looked into the Blackthorn Syndicate immediately. They’ve had a strong underground presence in Westchester for over a century. Their profits come from assassinations, mercenary work, and similar operations. They use low-level thugs for collections and fights. Essentially, they’re task-for-hire. My findings confirm Victoria had contact with them five years ago,” Maxwell reported.

Isabella’s expression darkened. Knowing it was the Blackthorns simplified things.

But Maxwell wasn’t finished. “They have roughly ten thousand members in Westchester. Causing them trouble is one thing, but capturing every single member is impossible. Most are rarely at their main base.”

Isabella frowned. Without a full capture, a complete investigation was off the table. They didn’t even know which branch Victoria had dealt with.

Maxwell added, “If you want everyone, Boss, we must strike during their annual gathering. That happens at year’s end.”

The Syndicate’s annual dinner was at the end of the year. It was only June. A plan began to form in her mind.

“Understood. I’ll handle the arrangements. Stand down for now and await my orders.” She ended the call and gazed out the window, deep in thought.

She had a mission tonight. Since they’d identified the Blackthorns, she might as well pay their base a visit later.

Meanwhile…

Victoria awoke filled with anticipation, only to find Harrison lying beside her.

“Ahhh!” A piercing scream tore from her throat. She bolted upright, clutching the sheets to her chest.

Harrison jolted awake. Taking in the scene, his eyes widened in horror.

What had happened? Alexander had sent him to fetch Victoria. How did he end up in bed with her? She was his boss’s woman!

“Why are you here?!” Victoria snarled, her voice tight with rage. “When did you get here? What did you do?!”

“Ms. Kensington, I’m sorry! I… I don’t know what happened! Mr. Whitmore sent me to get you. I came into the room and then…” He trailed off, too terrified to continue.

Victoria’s fists clenched. Was it the perfume? Had Harrison come in and been affected by its scent? She could have sworn it was Nathaniel!

The perfume’s label mentioned hallucinations, including mistaking one person for another. Had she been under its influence, thinking he was Nathaniel?

That meant Nathaniel never came. It was Harrison all along. She had slept with an assistant!

Seeing the murderous look in her eyes, Harrison scrambled off the bed and dropped to his knees, begging.
###Chapter 258

“Strike me or scream at me all you want, Ms. Kensington. I’ll contact Mr. Whitmore immediately. I accept full responsibility.”

Oliver retrieved his phone with trembling hands.

Victoria snatched it and smashed it against the wall. Her eyes burned with fury. “Why tell him? Haven’t you humiliated me enough? Do you want Alexander to discard me?”

“That… wasn’t my intention.” Harrison looked utterly bewildered.

Rage consumed Victoria as she stared at his pathetic expression. She forced herself to breathe deeply. The damage was done. She needed containment. Silence was essential. Her mind raced. “No one hears about today. Act like it never occurred. Understood?”

“But—”

“But what? If I’m not making it an issue, why are you? Do you aspire to marry me?” She hurled his clothes at him.

Harrison shook his head frantically. “No! I wouldn’t dare. I’m leaving now!” He scrambled to gather his garments.

Victoria’s glare was icy. “If a single word leaks, I’ll charge you with rape. Your family will suffer. Is that clear?”

“Yes! Absolutely, Ms. Kensington. Nothing happened today!” he vowed, trembling.

She dismissed him with a wave. Hatred simmered in her veins as she watched him flee. She, Victoria Kensington, slept with a mere assistant! The disgrace was unbearable.

Thankfully, The Ivy was automated. Robots handled everything. No human staff. She just needed to destroy the hidden camera she’d planted. No evidence would remain.

But why did Nathaniel abandon her?

She checked her phone. Messages from her new assistant, Penelope, flooded the screen.

[Ms. Victoria, emergency! Mr. Blackwood left abruptly! He entered the parking lot but drove off moments later!]

[I investigated. Isabella Montgomery called him. She demanded he return home immediately.]

[What’s the next step? Should we proceed with the alternate plan?]

[Ms. Victoria?]

Victoria’s fists clenched until her knuckles turned white. Isabella! That witch again!

Was this a deliberate trap? If Isabella discovered what transpired here, Victoria’s life would be over. Panic surged. She quickly messaged her hacker, Maxwell.

[Erase all my footage from The Ivy. Investigate if Isabella has any records related to this incident.]

[Acknowledged.]

Maxwell was a renowned hacker. His skills were impeccable. Some tension eased from her shoulders, but hatred festered. If this was Isabella’s doing, revenge would be swift and brutal.

Later that night, at the Blackwood Estate…

Oliver tugged on Isabella’s hand. “Mommy, let’s wear matching pajamas tonight! Christopher wants to match with both of you!”

Isabella smiled gently. “Alright, sweetheart. But I didn’t buy any today. I’ll get us some tomorrow, okay?” She ruffled his soft hair.

Oliver grinned mischievously. “No need! I was bored today and bought a set for us! Ta-da!” He produced three identical pajama sets from behind his back like a magician.

Isabella’s smile faltered. A slight frown creased her forehead as she examined the clothing. The pajamas…
###Chapter 259

Three sets of pajamas lay on the bed. Each featured a simple cartoon illustration right in the center. It was immediately obvious who they depicted.

Two sets were white short-sleeved tees with matching shorts. Hers, the female version, was a V-neck shirt without bottoms. The shirt was so short it barely reached mid-thigh. The cute drawing couldn't distract from that dangerously low neckline.

Sleeping next to Nathaniel while wearing this? Absolutely not.

Isabella immediately rejected the idea. "Sweetie, you and Daddy should wear these. Mommy will wear something else, okay?"

Oliver's face fell. His lower lip trembled. "But why? I picked these specially for us. I designed them myself. Even drew the pictures."

Her heart squeezed. She hadn't realized he'd put so much effort into this. Crushing his enthusiasm was impossible. She scooped him onto the bed. "You're so talented, my love! Mommy adores what you made. It's just... Mommy feels a bit chilly lately. I might need something warmer."

"I'll fix it!" He scrambled off the bed, tiny feet pattering toward the thermostat.

Isabella was speechless.

Since when was her son so stubborn?

Just then, Nathaniel emerged from the shower. A plush robe was tied around his waist. A chill filled the room. Oliver rushed to him, thrusting the pajamas into his hands. "Daddy, wear these! Mommy said yes to matching outfits tonight! We're waiting for you!"

Nathaniel's skeptical gaze found Isabella. The pajamas were... juvenile. Would she really wear them? Yet the set lay beside her. He didn't question it, simply heading to the dressing room.

Oliver bounded back to her, buzzing with excitement. "Mommy! Mommy! Daddy's changing! It's your turn now!"

She sighed in defeat.

She meant to scold him for manipulation. But those sparkling, hopeful eyes disarmed her completely. Gently, she pinched his chubby cheek. "You clever little fox. Alright. Mommy will wear it."

"Yay!" He jumped for joy.

Isabella retrieved a tube top and tight shorts from her wardrobe. She slipped into the dressing room.

Oliver waited on the bed, swinging his legs. Daddy and Mommy needed a push. He was just helping!

Two doors opened simultaneously.

Nathaniel stepped out. His eyes instantly locked on Isabella. The oversized shirt drowned her frame. Lace trimmed the hem. The childish cartoon on the front should have looked silly. Instead, it was oddly endearing. The shirt stopped high on her thighs. Those long, toned legs were utterly captivating. His gaze lingered a moment too long.

Isabella's breath hitched. Nathaniel usually slept in dark, silk pajamas. Now, he wore stark white. The same ridiculous cartoon was plastered on his chest. It softened his usual severity, making him seem almost approachable. A small red heart was stitched over his right pec. The matching detail felt intensely intimate.

Flustered, she moved toward the bed. "It's past eleven, sweetie. Time for sleep."

"Okay!" Oliver dove under the covers, rolling to the far edge.

Isabella frowned. "Oliver, the middle is your spot."

"But you said the middle has bad air," he reasoned, all innocence. "My lungs felt funny sleeping there. I need the edge now. Daddy should take the middle."

Her stomach dropped. Nathaniel in the middle. Her on the side. That meant they'd be sleeping right next to each other.
###Chapter 260

“What if Oliver sleeps with Daddy instead?” suggested Isabella. “Or just with Mommy? Having only two people on the bed would allow better air circulation.”

“No! All three of us sleep together! I love sleeping with Daddy and Mommy.” Oliver gazed at Isabella with pleading eyes. “All my friends’ mommies and daddies sleep together… Unless, Mommy wasn’t telling the truth? Does Mommy not want to be my real Mommy?” His voice grew small and vulnerable.

Afraid the child might discover her contractual arrangement with Nathaniel, Isabella quickly reassured him, “Of course I want to be your Mommy. I’m just not comfortable sleeping near the edge. Come here, I’ll hold you while you sleep!” She moved to the center of the bed, facing Oliver, and wrapped her arms around him. Using him as a barrier felt practical—if Nathaniel tried anything, Oliver would either shield her or wake up.

Nathaniel watched her silently before switching off the lamp. Darkness enveloped the room. Oliver closed his eyes contentedly and soon drifted into sleep, his soft snores filling the quiet space.

Isabella released a quiet breath. This adorable child could be so overwhelming. Though the bed was spacious, lying next to Nathaniel still made her nervous. Her top was shorter than usual tonight, so she stayed alert, careful not to expose herself.

She reached for the blanket to cover up when her fingers brushed against something cool.

What was that?

She touched it again. The structure felt distinct. One, two, three…

Those were Nathaniel’s fingers!

Isabella flinched. She had touched his hand! And she had lingered there a moment too long.

“I was just pulling up the blanket. Don’t get the wrong idea!”

She turned her back to him and shifted away. Under the soft moonlight, Nathaniel could clearly see the alluring curve of her silhouette. His voice came out low and husky in the dark. “You’re stunning, Isabella.”

Her heart skipped a beat. Stunning… He thought she was stunning…

Why did his voice have to be so intoxicating?

This man was a natural charmer. That face could drive anyone insane. That voice alone was enough to melt her defenses.

She fought to steady her racing pulse, then remembered something crucial—she wasn’t under the covers. Which meant from his angle, he could see everything.

The way she was turned away from him gave him a full view of her waist, her thighs, and that ridiculously short top.

Panicked, she flipped onto her back. “Go to sleep,” she said sternly. “And no more talking.”

No more of that flirtatious nonsense, anyway.

Besides, she had plans to execute later. But everyone needed to be asleep first.

Nathaniel turned over without another word, though his eyes still traced her profile. She looked ethereal in the silver moonlight.

Then suddenly…

His hand moved, his fingers brushing against her collarbone. Isabella’s eyes flew open in alarm.

“What are you doing?!”
###Chapter 261

Not a single word was spoken.

Nathaniel’s hand came down firmly on her shoulder. He gave a sharp, sudden tug.

A single strand of hair slid free from her shirt.

It was the middle of the night. Why was Nathaniel plucking a hair from her clothing in the dark? And how had he even seen it? The strand seemed to grow longer as he pulled.

Realization hit Isabella. “Stop!” she whispered urgently.

But it was too late.

With that one motion, the stitching on her pajama sleeve gave way. The fabric—whatever it was made of—ripped easily. A section over her chest tore open, exposing her bralette.

Nathaniel’s large hand stilled. He hadn’t expected this. “My apologies,” he murmured, his voice low. “Shall I get you another shirt?”

“No.”

She’d have to get up. It was too much trouble. She pulled the blanket up to cover herself. “Turn over. Face the other way.”

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed, but he acquiesced. “Alright.”

He never refused her. He rolled onto his side, turning his back to her.

Isabella thought she could finally rest. But the sight of his bare back made her heart stutter again.

Moonlight outlined the powerful lines of his shoulders, tapering down to a narrow waist. Nathaniel had the build of a perfect male specimen. His muscular form was practically an invitation—to reach out, to hold him, to lose herself.

This man… Even his silhouette was dangerously suggestive. Isabella squeezed her eyes shut. She forced her thoughts away. He’s just a pretty picture. It’s all in your head. It’s all in your head…

Time passed. Thankfully, Nathaniel kept his word and didn’t turn. His breathing eventually evened out into sleep.

Thoughts of her plan and the Blackthorn Syndicate swirled in her mind. Once she was certain both Oliver and Nathaniel were asleep, Isabella slipped from the bed. The torn shirt gaped open as she sat up. Luckily, Nathaniel was asleep and didn’t see. She ignored it and moved to the dressing room.

From her luggage, she selected dark, practical clothing. She dressed quickly and silently left the room.

The moment the door clicked shut, Nathaniel’s eyes opened. He had not moved.

Isabella noticed nothing. She used the key Nathaniel had given her earlier. In the garage, she chose the most discreet car and drove away from the Blackwood Estate.

The black sedan headed for a mountain range five miles outside the city. The peaks stretched over ten kilometers. Rumors said wild animals roamed there, keeping people away. Most saw it as just a dangerous, uninhabited place. But Isabella knew the truth. This was the heart of the Blackthorn Syndicate’s operations.

Victoria had hired them to set the trap five years ago. The Syndicate was old, disciplined, and secretive. Their strict codes meant they never talked. That was why Isabella had found nothing all this time.

Now, the truth was close. She had to find out who was responsible.

Isabella parked the car and moved swiftly into the mountains. The night was pitch black, but her vision was keen. She climbed over fallen logs, swung from thick vines, and leaped across gullies. Dressed in black, she moved like a creature of the night—silent and sure.

In the darkness behind her, Nathaniel followed. His eyes, shadowed and intense, tracked her every agile move.
###Chapter 262

This woman never ceased to amaze him.
But what was she doing inside the Blackthorn Syndicate’s headquarters?

After clearing several obstacles, Isabella Montgomery finally reached the main compound.
High walls surrounded the base, with patrol dogs circling nearby.
A faint, knowing smile touched her crimson lips.
She tossed a small medicinal pellet into the air.
The hounds collapsed almost instantly, sound asleep.

Her agile form scaled the tall fence with practiced ease.
She dropped silently into a wide, five-thousand-square-foot training yard.
To the public, the Blackthorn Syndicate posed as a martial arts academy.
Only a select few knew the truth—membership required insider connections.
Trainees who proved worthy were eventually absorbed into the syndicate’s inner circle.

Armed guards were posted every hundred meters throughout the manor.
Yet Isabella moved like a shadow, slipping past them undetected.
As she crossed a moonlit courtyard, her foot caught on a loose ceramic pot.
It tipped and shattered loudly against the cobblestones.
She reacted instantly, leaping onto a thick tree branch and melting into the shadows.

A man sat beside an ornamental pond, dressed in deep burgundy silk pajamas.
One knee was bent; the other dipped lazily into the water.
His robe hung open, loosely tied, revealing pale skin that glowed under the moonlight.
He looked like something from a Gothic novel—elegant and dangerous.

Isabella’s brow furrowed.
According to Maxwell’s intel, this was Sebastian Blackwood, patriarch of the syndicate.
Photographs hadn’t done him justice.
He was strikingly handsome, almost unnervingly so.
How could a man be more captivating than most women?
He didn’t look older than thirty, yet he commanded one of the most powerful underground organizations…?

Sebastian reclined against a smooth stone, drinking straight from a bottle of wine.
A stream of dark liquid poured into his mouth.
Some of it escaped, tracing a path down his jaw, over his throat, and across his chest.
The image was raw and indecently alluring.

Isabella released a quiet breath.
At least he was only drinking.
She dropped silently from the tree and continued her mission.

Nathaniel Blackwood watched from a nearby oak, concealed by dense foliage.
He’d seen the way Isabella stared at Sebastian.
A hot, possessive displeasure coiled in his chest.
She had looked at that man for over five minutes.
Was this her type?

But now wasn’t the time for jealousy.
His priority was keeping her safe.
The Blackthorn Syndicate was ruthless.
There were at least a hundred armed men on the premises.
How could she be so reckless?

He followed her silently, staying just far enough to avoid detection.
To his shock, she’d already broken into the syndicate’s secure records room.
The door required triple-layer biometric authentication—fingerprint, facial recognition, and retinal scan.
Even his best company hacker would need half an hour to bypass it.
And even then, an alarm was almost inevitable.
Yet she’d done it in under a minute.
Without triggering a single alert.

Before he could process what he’d seen, she emerged with a thick ledger in hand.
She scanned the area quickly, then slipped away into the darkness.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened.
She’d risked everything tonight just to steal a ledger?
Why did she need the Blackthorn Syndicate’s records?
The question burned in his mind.

He retreated swiftly, returning to the estate before she did.
He slid back into bed just moments before she re-entered the room.

Isabella paused inside the doorway, listening.
Both Nathaniel and Oliver were still asleep.
Relief washed over her.
She hadn’t been discovered.

She shed her dark clothing, then carried the ledger into the ensuite bathroom.
Inside were transaction records from five years earlier—the syndicate’s complete order history.
If she could find entries from around July of that year, she might identify the man Victoria had hired.
The man who’d ruined her.
And when she found him, she would make him pay.
Page by page, she began her search.
###Chapter 263

The ledger contained records spanning January through December from five years ago. Some entries detailed debt collection. Others involved revenge missions. A few were labeled as 'teaching lessons'. Several concerned information gathering. The Walkers clearly had diverse criminal operations.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she reached the July entries. A cold dread settled in her stomach. Her eyes scanned the page anxiously until they locked on one specific line:

February 13th. Client: Gabriella Martinez. Hired: Vincent Moreau. Target: Isabella Montgomery. Commission: $50,000.

Isabella's breath hitched. Vincent Moreau?

That was the man who had violated her?

She immediately accessed a global database on her phone. Her fingers flew across the screen with urgent precision. Within moments, a profile appeared.

Vincent Moreau. Westchester. Elementary school education. Functionally illiterate. Multiple sexual assault convictions.

The photo showed a coarse-faced man with dull, leathery skin and rotting yellow teeth.

Nausea twisted Isabella's stomach. This disgusting creature was the one Tiffany had hired? Her own sister had paid fifty thousand dollars for this subhuman filth to destroy her?

The paper crumpled in her white-knuckled grip. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

She had expected some lowlife scum, but seeing his actual face made her physically ill. This repulsive monster had stolen her innocence? This vile animal had shattered her entire life?

She had trusted Victoria completely. Treated her like a real sister. Never once imagined harming her. Yet all along, Victoria had been plotting this unspeakable betrayal.

Isabella wanted to storm into Victoria's room and beat her to a pulp right now. But she forced herself to breathe. Not yet. The timing wasn't right. She needed to wait just one more month. Then she would destroy Victoria completely.

Taking several steadying breaths, she locked the ledger in her secure case. She stormed out of the room. The mansion stood silent, all staff asleep.

She grabbed a bottle of bourbon from the kitchen. The gaming room welcomed her with its familiar hum. She booted up the system and took a long swallow of whiskey. Since she couldn't unleash her rage physically, the digital world would suffer her wrath instead.

Her headphones muffled the outside world. Her fingers flew across the keyboard. The mouse clicked rapidly under her control. Her expression remained frozen in icy fury.

Nathaniel watched silently from the doorway. He observed her violent keyboard strikes. He saw the aggressive mouse movements. He noted the frequent, deep drinks of alcohol. Even from behind, her rage radiated like heat from a furnace.

What could have provoked such fury?

He had never seen Isabella in this state before. He considered entering, but decided against it. He simply stood guard, allowing her this catharsis.

Isabella played for hours, her anger fueling a bloody rampage through the game. She slaughtered everything in her path. Chaos erupted in the global chat.

Holy shit! Boss is insane tonight!

Teach me your ways!

I've never seen sniping like this! Best player in the country!

These moves... they remind me of Kill. The legend from five years ago.

Can't be. This is a new account. Probably not Kill...

Kill hasn't logged in for over four years! That player dominated everyone!

This Boss player is just as terrifying! Another pentakill! Unbelievable!

Players watched her character in awe.

Meanwhile...

Benjamin was also online, playing his own match. He kept seeing global notifications flash across his screen.

Congratulations to Boss for achieving 5 consecutive kills!

Congratulations to Boss for solo killing the Dragon!
###Chapter 264

[Congratulations to Boss for 10 consecutive victories!]

Benjamin frowned, his expression skeptical as he swiftly exited his current match to enter spectator mode. He observed a female sniper moving fluidly across the map, seamlessly transitioning between eliminating enemy soldiers and hunting monsters. The sniper even engaged other players without apparent provocation.

Snipers were typically the most fragile class, vulnerable to instant elimination. Yet this player utilized immunization boosts with flawless timing, evading every incoming attack. She consistently turned perilous situations into decisive victories, systematically eliminating all opposition.

Absolutely remarkable! Who could have imagined such lethal prowess from a vulnerable sniper class? The player records indicated a female gamer. A woman with this level of refined skill?

Benjamin immediately sent a direct message. "Hello. Interested in signing with Elite Gaming? Name your price."

He desperately wanted to recruit her, but received no response. The moment her match concluded, she immediately queued for another, as if driven by an insatiable bloodlust.

Many players had stopped participating altogether, choosing instead to spectate her matches. The Eternal Champions forum erupted into chaos, with the player ID 'Boss' rapidly becoming everyone's new obsession. Isabella played relentlessly through the night while drinking, unaware the liquor contained 80% alcohol content. After finishing the bottle, her eyelids grew heavy until she finally collapsed asleep at the desk.

Only then did Nathaniel—who had been observing from the doorway—enter the room. He powered down the computer and gathered Isabella into his arms.

Completely intoxicated, her body went limp as clay, boneless and pliant. Even unconscious, her brows remained slightly furrowed, troubled by some unseen distress. Nathaniel settled her onto the bed and gently drew the covers over her.

He sat on the edge of the mattress, watching her with concerned eyes. What was he to do with this little wildcat?

Isabella slept restlessly, haunted by dreams of that night five years earlier. A powerfully built body pressed against hers, mountainous and unyielding. She struggled to open her eyes, to see his face, but exhaustion overwhelmed her.

"No...! Stop...!"

A agonized whimper escaped her lips, fragile as a kitten fallen into a well.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. What trauma caused her such pain? His mind connected the fragments he knew: Victoria's attack on Isabella five years ago; Victoria facing prison because of it; the scandal that would ruin them all if exposed.

Unless...

A terrible suspicion formed in his mind.

Isabella moaned in distress, "Don't... release me...!"

Nathaniel's face grew stormy. He lay beside her, wrapping her in his arms while gently stroking her back. With his free hand, he retrieved his phone and texted Dominic. "Investigate what happened to Isabella five years ago."

Though he'd promised not to interfere, witnessing her torment made inaction impossible. He prayed the investigation wouldn't confirm his fears.

Cradling her head against his chest, he murmured soft assurances. "Don't be afraid, Isabella. I'm here."

His deep voice resonated through her, gradually soothing her back into calm sleep. Nathaniel remained awake all night, his mind racing through possibilities. With Dominic's efficiency, results would arrive by morning, revealing Isabella's past.

If his suspicions proved true...
###Chapter 265

Isabella Montgomery slept deeply for what felt like an eternity.

Her eyes fluttered open to an opulent ceiling.

What was she resting against?

She turned her head.

Nathaniel Blackwood lay beside her.

Her head had been pillowed on his right arm.

How did this happen?

She remembered playing games last night.

Why was she in Nathaniel’s embrace?

He noticed her stirring.

Nathaniel set aside his phone.

His voice was a low rumble. “Are you feeling alright?”

Isabella shook her head slowly.

Her gaze caught the time on his phone screen.

Six in the evening.

She had slept straight through to the next evening.

She sat up abruptly. “You stayed here all day?”

“Mhm.” He attempted to rise.

A flicker of discomfort crossed his features.

His right arm remained motionless.

Isabella’s eyes dropped to his numb limb.

Her hands moved instinctively.

She began massaging his arm. “You’re insane. You could have moved me.”

“I didn’t want to.” His words were simple yet carried profound weight.

Her heart stuttered.

Didn’t want to?

Didn’t want to disturb her? Or didn’t want to let her go?

This warmth was foreign to her.

Even in her youth, she’d never known such care.

Alexander Whitmore had never feigned this level of devotion.

When Lawrence Chamberlain had poisoned her, Nathaniel stayed the entire night.

Now, he gave her a full day.

He had every opportunity to take advantage.

Yet he did nothing.

She narrowed her eyes slightly.

Her fingers worked his arm, encouraging circulation.

After a moment, she asked, “Better now?”

He attempted to flex his fingers. “Still numb.”

She had no choice but to continue.

She didn’t realize how domestic she looked.

Pajama-clad, tending to him beside the bed.

Nathaniel watched in silent appreciation.

Her gentleness was a rare sight.

His phone screen lit up with a new message.

The notification preview flashed.

[Mr. Blackwood, I’ve hit a wall. Someone else is investigating Ms. Montgomery. No leads.]

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed.

He moved to shut off the screen.

Too late.

Isabella had seen it.

“I…” The usually unshakable Nathaniel felt a surge of panic.

He feared her hatred.

He met her gaze, his own earnest. “Isabella, I only wanted to help you.”

Help her?

By violating her privacy? How was that help?

Rage simmered within her.

She wanted to scream.

No one was supposed to know about five years ago.

She hated anyone uncovering that scar.

Yet, staring into his sincere eyes, her anger faltered.

“Do you truly want to help me?” Her voice was quiet.

He nodded without hesitation.

A bitter irony washed over her.

If Nathaniel knew what happened back then, would he still look at her like this?

The secret was already unraveling.

Hiding it was pointless now.

Better he hear it from her.

She took a steadying breath.

Her lips parted. “Since you want to know… I hope you can accept the answer.”
###Chapter 266

“Five years back, I was—”

“Mom! Mom!”

Before Isabella could complete her sentence, a small figure burst into the room. Holding a bowl of green herbal soup, Oliver rushed toward her and offered it. “Mom, Dad had them prepare this special recipe for you. It’ll help with your headache.”

“Thanks, sweetie.” Isabella’s expression softened as she gently pinched Oliver’s cheek. She took the bowl and drank the soup without hesitation.

After finishing, she handed the empty bowl back to him. “Mom and Dad need to talk privately. Why don’t you go play downstairs? I’ll come find you soon.”

Isabella had decided—Nathaniel deserved to know the whole truth.

Unexpectedly, Oliver replied, “Grandpa and Grandma called earlier. They said they’ll be here in thirty minutes.” Nathaniel had instructed Oliver to stay downstairs, but the phone call changed his plans.

Isabella’s brows knitted together. “What did you say? Your grandparents are coming?”

“Yes, they want to discuss the birthday dinner with Dad. It sounded important,” Oliver answered honestly.

Isabella immediately slid out of bed and turned to Nathaniel. “I’m heading back to Rosewood Manor,” she stated firmly. “We’ll continue this conversation later.”

She couldn’t let the Blackwoods discover her relationship with Nathaniel. Since she planned to leave in two months, there was no point inviting unnecessary complications.

Nathaniel noticed her concern and didn’t press further. “Drive safely,” he simply said.

“Okay.”

As Isabella prepared to leave, she remembered Oliver’s confession from days ago. She knelt before him, placing her hands warmly on his shoulders. “When they arrive, you can go to the gym and exercise. You don’t need to see your grandparents.”

“Huh? Why?” Oliver frowned. His father and teachers had always taught him to be polite and face situations head-on.

Isabella responded, “They don’t appreciate you, and they’ll only scold you if they see you. Why subject yourself to their coldness? You’ve done nothing wrong—you’re innocent. There’s no reason for you to endure their insults.”

“Remember, you’re my little prince. I can’t bear to see you compromise yourself, and you shouldn’t either! It would hurt me deeply if you did, understand?”

Oliver nodded. “Alright, I promise, Mom! For you, I won’t compromise!”

Only after Oliver made his promise did Isabella feel assured enough to leave. Before departing, she instructed the maids, “Please put my things away.”

After Isabella left, Nathaniel changed out of his pajamas and carefully stored the three sets in a box.

Shortly after, Reginald Blackwood and Beatrice Blackwood entered the mansion with Vivienne Delacroix, the eldest daughter of the Houston family.

Vivienne wore a halterneck dress adorned with diamonds. Her fair, snow-like skin and elegant demeanor made her appear almost angelic.

All the maids bowed their heads respectfully. “Sir, Madam, Ms. Delacroix.”

The three walked into the hall with an air of unshakable grace, as if nothing in the world could faze them.

Nathaniel remained lounging on the sofa, a wine glass in hand, making no move to stand and greet them.

“Your parents are here,” Reginald said with clear displeasure. “What kind of attitude is this?”

Nathaniel gave them a cold glance. “Oh? Should I have everyone step outside so we can roll out the red carpet for your grand entrance?”

“You! You insolent—” Reginald growled, the veins on his neck bulging.

Beatrice quickly tugged his arm to calm him. “Reginald, Nathaniel has always been like this. Don’t let it upset you. Remember why we’re here today.”

“Hmph!” Reginald snorted indignantly before snapping, “You will become engaged to Vivienne at my sixtieth birthday celebration! You’re getting engaged to Vivienne!”
###Chapter 267

Vivienne stood silently beside them, her refined features flushed with discomfort as she averted her gaze.

Nathaniel’s expression remained unreadable. “Since when do you decide who I date?” His voice was icy, laced with clear irritation.

Reginald slammed his cane on the floor. “How old are you now? Pushing thirty! What are you waiting for? Still chasing after that woman from five years ago?”

He scoffed. “Nathaniel, I know you resent us, but no respectable family would accept some random woman who bore your child.”

Beatrice tugged Vivienne forward. “Vivienne comes from a good background. She’s healthy and decent. She doesn’t mind that you have a son—she’s even promised to treat Christopher well. What more could you want? Even if you found that woman, how could she possibly compare to Vivienne?”

Vivienne looked at Nathaniel with practiced grace, her red lips parting softly. “Your parents aren’t getting any younger. Do you really want them worrying about you forever? And Christopher… he needs a mother. A proper upbringing. I’ve spoken with your family. If we get engaged, I’ll publicly claim him as my own. He’ll carry the Blackwood name. He’ll be your heir.”

It was a significant concession. A generous offer.

Nathaniel took a slow sip of his whiskey. “Are you finished?” he asked, his voice dangerously low.

The question hung in the air, stark and dismissive.

He set his glass down with a quiet click. “If you’re done, you can see yourselves out.” His tone offered no warmth, no negotiation.

Vivienne stiffened. She was beautiful, accomplished, from an impeccable family. Why did he look straight through her?

Reginald struck the floor again with his cane, the sound sharp with fury. “Nathaniel! Are you trying to be the death of me? You moved out years ago! When will this rebellion end? Do you have any idea the embarrassment you’ve brought upon the Blackwood name? You should be grateful a woman like Vivienne would even consider you! How dare you be so ungrateful!”

“Perhaps you should marry her, then.” Nathaniel’s gaze was flat as he rose from his chair, ready to leave.

Reginald pointed a trembling finger. “You—! You—!” He choked, gasping for air, his face turning red.

Beatrice rushed to his side, rubbing his chest. She shot Nathaniel a furious glare. “How can you speak to your father like that? Are you trying to kill him?”

Nathaniel didn’t bother with a reply. He turned, his broad back radiating cold detachment as he headed for the stairs. He didn’t care why they’d come. Their pressure for marriage was a waste of his time.

The grand hall fell silent, leaving the three of them behind. Vivienne’s hands clenched into tight fists at her sides. Men lined up for her favor across the globe. Why was Nathaniel Blackwood the only one utterly immune?

Beatrice took her hand, patting it gently. “Don’t take it to heart, Vivienne. He’s always been like this, stubborn and cold. You’ve both been busy with your companies. You haven’t had time to build a connection. Feelings need cultivation.” She smiled reassuringly. “Starting today, come by the estate every day. Spend a few hours with Christopher. Get to know them both.”

“But… wouldn’t that be inappropriate?” Vivienne murmured, lowering her eyes.

“Nonsense,” Beatrice said firmly. “I am still the lady of this house. You will come. Three to four hours a day. Make yourself at home.”
###Chapter 268

“I understand your work demands attention, but your marriage deserves equal priority. You must invest more energy into this.”

Vivienne pressed her lips together. After a moment, she gave a reluctant nod. “Fine. I’ll try.”

Susan turned to address the household staff. “Take note. Miss Delacroix will soon be the lady of this house. You will treat her with the utmost respect.”

“Yes, Madam.” The maids kept their heads bowed, scarcely daring to breathe.

Vivienne’s gaze drifted toward the hallway where Nathaniel had vanished. A flicker of fierce resolve ignited in her eyes.

Isabella rode her motorcycle back to Rosewood Manor. The air inside felt colder, emptier than she remembered. She had grown too accustomed to the warmth of the Blackwood Estate.

She would need to readjust. Once she told Nathaniel the truth, he might never allow a woman like her near Oliver again. In two months, when the contract ended, she would likely leave for good.

She rubbed her temples, pushing the thoughts aside. She focused on tidying the villa she hadn't visited in weeks.

Her phone rang, shattering the silence. She checked the caller ID and answered.

“Boss Montgomery, Nathaniel’s men conducted an extensive background check on you overnight. We’ve handled it. The higher-ups are aware. They urge you to complete your task with Nathaniel quickly.”

Isabella remained calm. “I’m aware. I have it under control.”

“The two senior mentors emphasized they have arranged marriage plans for you. This isn’t just about the mission. You need to distance yourself from Nathaniel immediately,” Maxwell cautioned.

Isabella let out a short, derisive laugh. “Did their R&D project fail again? Are they still trying to marry me off to that American?”

“You guessed it, Boss Montgomery…” Maxwell gave an awkward chuckle before his tone turned serious. “It’s not like that. They only want what’s best for you. Frederick Ashford is an excellent match. Young, accomplished, kind, and considerate. Most importantly, he knows about your past and accepts it completely. He’s willing to dedicate his life to you.”

Isabella brewed a cup of coffee, her movements steady. “Tell them to stop. Arranged marriages are archaic. If their project is stalled, they can wait for me to fix it. They don’t need to auction me off. If that’s all, I’m hanging up.”

She was ready to end the call, her patience thin.

“Wait, Boss Montgomery! One more thing! Victoria convinced Harrison to keep her secret. She visited Alexander again last night. They were together.”

Isabella’s brow furrowed. She quickly pieced together Victoria’s scheme. “Monitor her,” she ordered coolly. “But do not intervene without my direct order.”

“Understood. Oh, and Boss Montgomery, I sent Frederick Ashford’s photos to your WhatsApp. Please remember to look at them!” Maxwell spoke rapidly and hung up before she could react.

Isabella saw the notification but ignored it. She placed her phone aside without opening the app. She stood by the window, gazing thoughtfully at the forest beyond.

She had met Frederick three years ago during a joint research project. He was the ideal gentleman, every woman's dream. Exceptionally gentle, attentive, and a brilliant collaborator. Since then, he had maintained close ties with her mentors, persistently seeking information about her.

Isabella knew of his feelings. She had asked her mentors to disclose the incident from five years ago, expecting him to retreat. Instead, he had waited for her all this time.

She found it puzzling. Revealing her past to Frederick had been effortless. Yet, the thought of confessing to Nathaniel filled her with dread. If he discovered her secrets, would he accept her as Frederick had?
###Chapter 269

The phone buzzed insistently.

Isabella Montgomery glanced at the screen. She expected Oliver Blackwood calling about dinner, but Julian Hawthorne's name flashed instead.

She answered. Julian's tense voice filled her ear. "We have a situation. Arabella Fontaine's mistress scandal just broke. She's threatening to jump from the company balcony right now."

"Suicide?" Isabella's brow furrowed.

Adrian Sinclair's panicked voice cut in. "It's bad! Ms. Montgomery, you need to get here! This is my new building! She's our first major signing!"

"We paid one-point-five billion for her contract termination," Julian added grimly. "The Celestial Gala contract has a five-billion penalty clause if the artist can't perform."

Total potential loss: six-point-five billion. Plus incalculable reputational damage.

"Understood. I'm on my way." Isabella ended the call and strode from Violet Villa. She scrolled through news headlines while walking.

(Top Model Arabella Fontaine Exposed as Mistress!)

Several compromising photos accompanied the article.

(Arabella signed with SilverPeak seven years ago. She consistently received preferential treatment, better resources, and a carefully crafted public persona. The reason? A longstanding affair with SilverPeak CEO Harrison Winslow! Her contract buyout was orchestrated through their illicit relationship!

(Harrison Winslow is a married man. His wife, Genevieve Beaumont, was a beloved actress! Seven years ago, Genevieve won the Golden Eagle Goddess Award for her charming looks and stellar performances. At just twenty-three, she became a national treasure!

(Her future seemed limitless. Then, at her career peak, she suddenly retired and vanished from public life.

(Rumors suggested she married a billionaire. No one imagined she wed Harrison Winslow!

(Genevieve captivated audiences as the girl-next-door in teen dramas. Despite her seven-year absence, no one has ever taken her 'Sweetest Goddess' title.)

The internet erupted in fury.

(How dare Arabella wreck Genevieve's marriage!)

(My sweet Genevieve! She left for a quiet life! This is heartbreaking!)

(Arabella is disgusting! That gentle, foodie persona was a lie! She's a homewrecker!)

(She should die!)

Isabella pocketed her phone and mounted her motorcycle. Something felt off. Her first meeting with Arabella left an impression of clear, earnest eyes. A gentle, innocent aura. A mistress? The photos seemed authentic, though.

She needed answers. Fast.

Isabella revved the engine and sped toward GoldenPhoenix. The building had fifteen floors, each five meters high. Arabella perched precariously on the ninth-floor balcony railing.

A hostile crowd gathered below, hurling vicious insults.

"Just jump, you shameless bitch!"

"Not ashamed to sleep with a married man, but ashamed to get caught? This is just a performance!"

"Real suicide attempts aren't public spectacles! You're acting!"

"Jump! Stop wasting our time! Only your death can apologize to Genevieve!" The cruel shouts echoed upward.
###Chapter 270

Isabella Montgomery arrived on her motorcycle, a streak of black against the city skyline. She pulled off her helmet, her gaze icy as it swept over the security team. "What are we paying you for? To stand around and look pretty? Clear this mess. Now."

"Yes, Ms. Montgomery." The guards snapped to attention, fear evident in their hurried movements as they began pushing back the screaming crowd.

Voices rose in a chaotic wave. "Isabella! How could you support a homewrecker? Have you no shame?"
"After what your own sister did to you! Don't you understand Genevieve's pain?"
"That woman destroyed a family! A child is involved! She deserves worse than death!"

Isabella ignored the vitriol. Words were a waste of time. Action was the only currency that mattered here. Most of the mob had been contained, reinforcements were on their way.

She strode into the building, her heels clicking a sharp rhythm on the marble floor. Adrian Sinclair rushed to meet her, his usual composure shattered. "Isabella, thank god. What's the plan? The rescue team's vehicle broke down. They're saying thirty minutes. She could be... it could be too late by then."

He was her older cousin, but right now, he sounded like a panicked child.

Isabella remained unnervingly calm. She moved toward the elevator. "Get me a rope. Heavy-duty gloves. Now."

"Gloves? A rope? For what? To pull her back? She's completely lost it, Isabella! She won't let anyone near!"

Adrian, normally unflappable, was fraying at the edges. This was a crisis unlike any he'd faced.

The elevator doors slid open. Isabella stepped inside, pressing the button for the ninth floor. "Have them brought to me when they're ready," she commanded, her voice leaving no room for argument.

Adrian immediately turned to carry out her orders.

On the ninth-floor lobby, Julian Hawthorne had evacuated everyone, desperate not to further upset the fragile woman on the ledge. He was trying to reason with her, but his words seemed to bounce off her. Arabella Fontaine sat perched on the concrete edge, a solitary, broken figure against the vast sky.

Isabella approached, but Julian quickly grabbed her arm. "Don't. She's not in her right mind. One wrong move... she could slip."

Isabella halted by the doorway, a frown etching her features.

If Arabella was truly the villain they painted her to be, she wouldn't be up here consumed by this kind of agony. The truth was always more complicated than the story.

Adrian arrived moments later, carrying a coiled rope and a pair of thick work gloves. "Here. Now what?" he whispered.

"Both of you. With me." Isabella took the items and turned toward the stairwell.

Julian and Adrian exchanged confused frowns. Follow her? That would leave Arabella completely unattended...

"Will staring at her make her step down?" Isabella's voice echoed slightly in the concrete stairwell as she began to climb.

They had no choice but to follow. The three of them emerged on the eleventh floor, two stories above the desperate scene.

Julian and Adrian frowned again, their confusion deepening. The eleventh floor? How in the world was this supposed to help Arabella?
###Chapter 271

Isabella strode directly to the balcony’s edge.

She swiftly secured the rope around her waist.

Her gloves were pulled on with practiced efficiency.

“Both of you will anchor the rope,” she commanded. “Maintain a firm grip. Do not falter.”

Adrian’s eyes widened in disbelief. “What? Isabella—I mean, Boss! You can’t be serious! You’re going over? This is the eleventh floor! If something goes wrong, how do I explain it to your grandfather?”

Julian’s brow furrowed deeply. He stepped forward. “I’ll do it. You take the rope.”

If any harm came to Isabella, he would be held responsible by countless people. He was the one who brought her back to Westchester.

“We are out of time for debate,” Isabella stated flatly. “Besides, are either of you more capable than I am in this?”

Her words left both men speechless. Julian, especially, knew her skills were unparalleled. His own abilities paled in comparison.

Even so…

A rope descent rescue was incredibly perilous. A single mistake would be unforgivable. He could never face his superiors.

Before he could protest further, Isabella thrust the rope and spare gloves into their hands. “Stay calm. Do not startle her.”

She then climbed onto the balcony railing, fifty meters above the ground.

She stood against the vast expanse of sky, her silhouette sharp and defined against the clouds.

Adrian’s heart hammered in his chest. “Boss, please! Get down! We can find another solution! You’re the only cousin I actually like. If you get hurt…”

“Enough! Hold the rope. Tightly,” Isabella cut him off.

Then, she pushed off the railing, turning to face them as she descended.

Julian instinctively braced, his grip tightening on the rough rope. Adrian squeezed his eyes shut, fear gripping him.

She actually jumped. From the eleventh floor. It was a fifty-meter drop.

On the opposite building, news crews had secured their positions. Their cameras were live-streaming Arabella’s suicide attempt.

The直播 platform’s viewer count skyrocketed. The comment section flooded with vitriol.

[Gigi never pulled a stunt like this. How dare she?]

[Just jump already! Stop faking! Disgusting!]

[The audacity of the homewrecker to play victim. Unbelievable.]

[Vile. Absolutely vile.]

Arabella stood on the ledge, her face a mask of anguish and despair. Silent tears traced paths down her cheeks.

She slowly closed her eyes. Her arms spread wide, as if ready to embrace the air.

She began to lean forward.

A dark figure suddenly shot down from above.

A sharp kick connected with Arabella’s side.

The force sent her tumbling backward onto the balcony floor. A loud crash echoed.

The black figure continued its rapid descent, movements sleek and precise, like a shadow agent.

Reporters and live-stream viewers gasped in unison. Shrieks of shock filled the air.

Julian and Adrian strained against the rope. The sudden weight and velocity were immense.

The rope seared through their gloved hands, generating tiny, fiery sparks.

In a heartbeat, Isabella plummeted past the seventh floor.

Both men hauled back on the rope with all their strength, muscles screaming. The descent halted abruptly.

Isabella now dangled precariously in mid-air.

Assessing the situation instantly, Adrian and Julian exchanged a determined glance.

They began pulling the rope upward together, heaving with concerted effort.

A faint, ominous snap sounded.

Their eyes shot downward.

The rope was fraying dangerously just outside the balcony’s edge.

It was on the verge of breaking.
###Chapter 272

The rope, once thick as a thumb, had frayed to the width of a pinky finger.

It strained, ready to snap at any second.

Their eyes widened in horror.

All movement ceased instantly.

Julian shouted, "Isabella, look out!"

She heard the warning and glanced upward.

The situation became immediately clear.

Isabella knew she had to remain perfectly still.

Even the smallest shift could sever the weakening cord.

Her gaze swept across her surroundings, assessing options.

Across the building, reporters noticed the danger.

Their cameras zoomed in on the fraying rope against the balcony.

The live stream exploded with panicked comments.

(It's going to break! This is terrifying!)

(That's a thirty meter drop! She won't survive the fall!)

(Why risk your life for someone like her, Ms. Montgomery? It's not worth it!)

(Scarlet and her family should pay for this! Her suicide attempt is causing someone else's death!)

(Where are the rescue teams? Hurry! Save Ms. Montgomery!)

Unaware of the broadcast, Isabella calculated her position.

She dangled below the seventh-floor balcony.

The sixth floor stood just out of reach.

Five meters separated the floors.

Too high to reach the seventh, too low to step onto the sixth.

Suspended in air with no support to distribute her weight.

Another sharp 'crack' echoed.

The rope fibers splintered further.

Mere seconds remained before complete failure.

Death awaited if she fell.

Screams flooded the live chat.

(Ahhhh!)

(She's going to die!)

Isabella's brow furrowed slightly.

She withdrew a dagger from her pocket.

With a swift, precise motion, she slashed the straining rope.

The blade cut clean through.

Isabella plunged downward.

Gasps erupted from every witness.

Hearts hammered against ribs.

What had she done? Why cut the only thing holding her?

Before anyone processed the action, her hands gripped the sixth-floor balcony railing.

She executed a perfect mid-air flip.

Landing gracefully on the balcony, steady and unharmed.

Her movements flowed with lethal elegance.

Dressed in black tactical gear, she embodied a elite operative.

The live stream erupted into chaos.

(Am I watching a movie? That was insane!)

(Ms. Montgomery's skills are unreal! So fierce! So brilliant!)

(I'm a fan for life! Forever!)

Isabella stood firm, not a scratch on her.

She peeled off her gloves, tossing them aside.

Her stride never broke as she moved indoors.

Julian and Adrian charged down the stairs, faces pale with fear.

They found her completely unscathed.

Relief washed over them.

Adrian clutched his chest. "Boss, you took ten years off my life. I need a vacation after this."

"Train more, sleep less. Build better stamina," she advised coolly, already heading back up.

"How's Arabella?" she asked without breaking stride.

"Not good," Julian answered grimly. "After you kicked her in, we found a gash on her arm. She sliced her wrist open. Blood is pouring out, but she's fighting anyone who tries to help."

A slit wrist.

She could bleed out in minutes.
###Chapter 273

Isabella Montgomery’s expression darkened as she stepped onto the ninth floor.

The lobby was already crowded with people blocking the balcony from Arabella Fontaine. Her manager and assistants were trying to calm her, but Arabella clutched a vase, weakly threatening, “Stay back! Don’t come any closer! I’ll do it… I swear I will!”

Blood dripped steadily from her wrist, forming a dark pool on the marble floor. Her team kept a helpless distance, but Isabella strode forward without hesitation.

Arabella stumbled backward, raising the vase. “I said don’t come near me!”

“Go ahead. Throw it at me,” Isabella challenged, her steps never faltering.

Arabella’s hands shook violently. “I’ll really do it—ah!”

Isabella moved like lightning, seizing her wrist and wrenching the vase away. In one fluid motion, she pinned Arabella onto the nearby sofa.

The assistants sprang into action, holding her down while the medical team rushed to stem the bleeding.

“Let me go! Why did you save me?” Arabella sobbed. “Why won’t you let me die?”

“So that scumbag can return to his perfect family while your name is dragged through the mud forever?” Isabella’s voice was icy as she stepped back, allowing the medics to work.

Arabella flinched. A bitter smile touched her lips. “What else is left for me? I deserve this… I deserve to die!” She closed her eyes, tears streaming uncontrollably.

Her manager, Penelope Sinclair, rushed to Isabella’s side. “Boss Montgomery, please help us. Arabella had no idea Harrison Winslow was married! She didn’t know about Genevieve Beaumont or their children! She was completely in the dark! She gave that man everything!”

Arabella wailed, her body trembling with each sob.

It was true. She’d been only eighteen, new to the industry, when Harrison swept her off her feet. He treated her like a princess, and she believed she’d found her fairy tale.

She followed his every direction, attended every event he arranged. Even when rival companies courted her with better offers, she never considered leaving. Her free time was spent knitting scarves for him, tailoring his suits by hand. They adopted a cat together. She gave him her innocence.

She dreamed of their wedding, even picking out names for their future children: Markus and Katie Winslow. Symbols of their love, their future.

Just days ago, she’d been thrilled about her contract with GoldenPhoenix, imagining the money she’d earn to buy Harrison a new car. Then the scandal broke—leaked photos of them in a hotel room.

Harrison had orchestrated it all. The man she loved had destroyed her. Eight years of her youth, her best years, were nothing but a lie.

Isabella frowned. “After all this time with Harrison, you must have something on him.”

“Harrison Winslow is a master manipulator. He never told anyone at SilverPeak he was married. No one knew. He never even used social media to message Arabella.”
###Chapter 274

“So without the media leak, Arabella might never have discovered the truth…”

Isabella’s eyes darkened. That bastard had covered his tracks perfectly. Still…

She turned, her voice low and resolute. “The one who deserves to die isn’t you. It’s Harrison Winslow. You will live. I’ll prove your innocence before the Celestial Gala. If I fail, I’ll die with you.” Her cold words hung in the air as she strode out, her posture unyielding.

Arabella frowned, but a faint spark lit in her eyes. Before the Celestial Gala? Prove her innocence? The event was only five days away. How could Isabella possibly clear her name in such a short time?

She was publicly branded a home-wrecker, a mistress who destroyed a family. She couldn’t even forgive herself. How could Isabella save her?

Isabella sped away from SilverPeak, her mind racing. So this was why Kelly let Arabella go free. She set this up to make me lose money! The scandal would cost RisingHawk billions. The company’s reputation would be ruined. For Arabella’s sake and for her own company, Isabella had to fix this.

But with no evidence…

Hah!

She screeched to a halt in the underground garage. Oliver was pacing anxiously. She quickly dismounted. “Momo, what’s wrong? Why are you down here?”

“Mommy! You’re back! Waa… Momo saw the video! Momo was so scared…! Waa…!” Oliver ran into her arms on his short, chubby legs.

Isabella frowned. “What video?”

“This one! Where you jumped off the building to save that lady…! Waa… Momo was terrified! Scared you’d get hurt! Scared you’d leave Momo! It took so long to find a Mommy I like… Waa…!” He sobbed, handing her his phone.

She finally understood. Her rescue of Arabella had been live-streamed. It was trending. Her agile moves had won her fans, but many criticized her for saving a mistress.

Isabella had no time for that. She put the phone away and ruffled his hair. “Don’t cry, Momo. I know what I’m doing. I never take risks I can’t handle. No matter what happens, you must trust me. Okay?”

“Okay! But Momo doesn’t want you to risk your life! Momo wants you to be Daddy’s princess! Let Daddy handle these things! Even if it means he has to jump off a building!” Oliver declared seriously.

Isabella was stunned.

Ask him to jump? Did that mean she ranked higher than Nathaniel in Oliver’s heart?

The thought warmed her. She took his chubby hand. “You’re the best, Momo. Let’s go upstairs. I’ll make you a special dinner tonight, okay?”

Oliver tugged her hand. “We can’t, Mommy. Auntie Vivienne is here.”

Isabella frowned. “Auntie Vivienne?”

“Yes. Vivienne Delacroix. She’s with Daddy,” Oliver explained.

A strange pang hit her heart. So Vivienne was here. With Nathaniel. He left Oliver waiting in the garage while he spent time alone with Vivienne at home?
###Chapter 275

She had been gone from the estate for barely half a day.

And he already had another woman in his home.

As Isabella processed the scene, Oliver quickly clarified, "Mommy, it's not Daddy's fault. Grandfather and Grandmother sent Aunt Vivienne. They said she must spend three hours with us every day from now on."

Three hours.

That could only mean one thing.

The Blackwood elders were determined to matchmake Nathaniel and Vivienne.

They weren't wrong in their choice.

Vivienne Delacroix stood at the pinnacle of Westchester's elite.

Her family background was impeccable.

Her medical and business skills were unparalleled.

She outshone every other woman in the city.

A woman like her was truly worthy of Nathaniel.

Isabella's eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly.

She looked down at Oliver. "Alright, sweetheart. Mommy will leave now. I'll visit you another day."

"No!" Oliver insisted, clutching her hand. "I want to stay with you. She's leaving in twenty minutes anyway. Mommy shouldn't have to leave because of someone like her! Come with me—I'll show you a secret place."

He led her to a narrow, hidden passageway.

It was a spiral staircase barely half a meter wide, winding upward through the walls.

Isabella frowned slightly. Where was he taking her?

She feared no one, least of all Vivienne Delacroix.

She knew she could easily rival the other woman in any competition.

Yet deep down, she acknowledged the truth.

She would never be with Nathaniel.

She wanted to avoid unnecessary complications.

If Vivienne discovered her presence, things could become messy.

While lost in thought, Isabella found herself in a small attic space.

Oliver placed a finger to his lips, signaling for silence.

Isabella realized they were on the ninth floor, peering through a small window in the door.

Below them, the main lobby was visible.

Nathaniel sat on an ornate European sofa, conducting a meeting with several blond businessmen.

They seemed to be discussing something important.

Vivienne sat patiently on a nearby sofa, occasionally checking her wristwatch.

Her elegant face showed clear signs of displeasure.

Isabella felt a flicker of surprise.

Had Nathaniel really scheduled meetings for the entire three hours of Vivienne's mandated visit?

"Ha!" Oliver whispered triumphantly. "Only twenty more minutes! Then we won't have to see her anymore!"

"Why don't you like her?" Isabella asked gently.

This woman would likely become his stepmother.

Oliver pouted. "I don't like her at all. I only want you as my mommy. Anyone else is just pretending! And nobody is as beautiful as you!"

Isabella couldn't help but smile at his words.

Objectively, Vivienne was just as beautiful as she was.

This child certainly knew how to charm.

Down in the lobby, Vivienne finally reached her limit.

She approached the group of businessmen and addressed them in flawless French.

"Excuse me, gentlemen. I need to speak with Mr. Blackwood regarding urgent matters concerning our future together. Please resume your discussions another time."

The men exchanged reluctant glances but eventually departed.

Now only Nathaniel and Vivienne remained in the spacious lobby.

Vivienne seated herself elegantly opposite Nathaniel.

"Nathaniel," she began, her voice soft and persuasive. "I understand your reluctance. But this is your parents' decision. I genuinely wish to help you raise Oliver. Every child deserves a complete family."

Nathaniel remained impassive.

He stood abruptly. "Oliver and I value our peace above all else."

The dismissal was clear.

He turned to leave without another word.

Vivienne moved quickly, grasping his wrist to stop him.

"Nathaniel," she said, her tone turning urgent. "We've known each other for years. I am your best option. No other woman in the world matches your status. Whatever you dislike about me, I will change."
###Chapter 276

Nathaniel stopped walking. “Ms. Delacroix is certainly accomplished, but I dislike women who cling to me. Chasing after someone relentlessly gives the impression of a desperate puppy.”

He pulled his wrist from her grasp and walked off. He took out a handkerchief and wiped his wrist clean before tossing it into a nearby trash bin. The gesture was cold, dismissive, utterly devoid of warmth.

Vivienne stood there, her face pale with humiliation. Did Nathaniel just compare her to a dog? She had lowered her pride to pursue him, and this was his response? How could there ever be a romance if she didn't make the first move?

He was deliberately making things difficult for her, insulting her openly. It didn't matter that his parents approved of her. It didn't matter that she visited their home for hours every day. Nathaniel remained completely indifferent.

Inside the storage room…

Isabella was equally confused. Had she just witnessed Nathaniel being cold to another woman? His method of rejection sounded strangely familiar, reminiscent of how she had once rejected him…

After collecting herself, a dejected Vivienne stepped into the elevator. Once she was gone, Oliver cracked the door open and whispered excitedly, “Daddy! Daddy! Come quick! Mommy was so moved by what you did! She wants to marry you now!”

Isabella was baffled.

Since when had she said that?

It was too late. Nathaniel turned and looked directly at her. She hadn't even had a moment to school her expression. Her face probably did look somewhat… touched.

Nathaniel began walking toward her, each step deliberate. Oliver vanished instantly, disappearing like a wisp of smoke.

Isabella was stunned.

Did her own son just betray her like that?

She tried to step out of the room, but Nathaniel was already inside, closing the door behind him. The storage room was small, only a few square meters, crammed with bookshelves. The space felt cramped and confined. His large, imposing frame made the atmosphere instantly intense.

Isabella raised an eyebrow. “You don’t actually believe the words of a five-year-old, do you?”

“Of course not,” Nathaniel replied, his voice deep and resonant.

Isabella sighed in relief. “Good. Then let me pass. I’m leaving.”

Instead of moving, he swept her up into his arms and placed her firmly on a small table against the wall.

Her heart hammered against her ribs. A flush crept up her neck. “What are you doing? Don’t you dare do what I think you’re about to do, or I won’t be responsible for my actions!” She cracked her knuckles menacingly for emphasis.

Nathaniel remained utterly unfazed. “Don’t move,” he commanded, his voice a low, serious warning.

His large, cool hands settled on her upper arms. He applied gentle pressure, his palms slowly sliding down the length of her arms, over her wrists, and then carefully, deliberately, he began tracing each of her fingers.

A jolt, like an electric shock, shot through Isabella. His touch was cool and deliberate, and every inch of skin he contacted made her nerves sing with tension.

She hadn’t been this close to a man in years. No man had touched her like this. Yet here was Nathaniel, methodically touching her arms, caressing each of her fingers…

She should have punched him immediately. But he wasn’t exactly taking liberties; his actions were oddly clinical. Frozen on the table, she could only watch. “Nathaniel,” she gasped, “what are you trying to do?!”

His large hands moved down and settled firmly on her thighs.
###Chapter 277

Isabella raised her fist, ready to strike.

Nathaniel caught her wrist with a firm grip. "I'm examining you," he growled. "Stay still."

Examining her? What did he mean?

Confusion flickered across Isabella's face.

Nathaniel remained focused as his hands moved with practiced precision. He applied gentle pressure along her thighs. Then he checked her knees. Finally, he examined both her legs thoroughly.

After professionally assessing her feet, his tense expression gradually softened. "You're unharmed this time," he stated. "But never pull such a reckless stunt again!"

Isabella frowned, trying to process his words.

It took her a moment to understand. He must have seen the footage of her jumping from the building. He was worried about potential injuries. That's why he was checking her body so carefully...

A sudden warmth spread through her chest. An unfamiliar emotion stirred within her heart.

This man who seemed so cold-hearted was being incredibly gentle with her. Yet he had been utterly ruthless with Vivienne just moments earlier.

If this continued, things could spiral out of control. She might not be able to maintain her composure much longer...

Isabella looked up at him with weary eyes. "Nathaniel," she said softly. "The person you should care about is Vivienne, not me. Didn't you always want to know what happened to me five years ago? I should have told you this afternoon. Listen carefully now."

She took a deep breath and met his gaze directly. "Five years ago, Victoria paid someone to ra—"

"Enough!" Nathaniel's voice cut through the air like a whip.

His body suddenly pressed against hers, caging her between his arms. "I said stop!" he commanded sternly.

He already knew. Even before she finished her sentence, he understood completely. It matched exactly what he had suspected last night.

Isabella had been...

The woman he dared not touch. The woman he placed on a pedestal. Someone else had violated her.

A cold, deadly aura radiated from him. He resembled a king emerging from hell itself.

Isabella could feel his rage emanating from him. It was palpable, just a breath away. Alarmed, she stared at him. "You should let me go now," she said. "Consider our three-month contract terminated effective immediately."

"Who said anything about letting you go?" Nathaniel's expression hardened into something unreadable.

Isabella frowned in confusion. He knew the truth now. Why wasn't he releasing her? What more could he possibly want from her?

"Does Mr. Blackwood want to imitate some romantic drama protagonist?" she asked sarcastically. "Playing the noble hero who doesn't care about the heroine's tainted past?"

In her opinion, men who pursued women with complicated histories like hers were simply inviting trouble. If she were in his position, she would never choose a partner who brought so much baggage.

"You're absolutely right," Nathaniel replied simply.

He agreed with her...?

Was he actually saying he didn't look down on her? A man of his status truly didn't judge her for her past?

Seeing her confusion, Nathaniel spoke in a husky voice. "It seems I need to convince you properly."

Without warning, he lowered his body and pressed her against the table. His lips captured hers in a searing kiss.

Isabella's mind went completely blank. Shock reverberated through her entire being.

Nathaniel was kissing her... He was actually kissing her...

This was her first real kiss, if she didn't count what happened five years ago!

She instinctively tried to fight back. Her hands pushed against his chest, but his muscular frame didn't budge. He was too strong, too heavy.

Initially, Nathaniel had intended only a simple kiss to prove his point. But this long-overdue contact ignited something primal within him. It was like rain finally falling after a prolonged drought.

A strange yet familiar sensation overwhelmed his senses. It reminded him of that beautiful night five years ago. All self-restraint vanished completely.
###Chapter 278

Nathaniel Blackwood possessed a peculiar trait since childhood. Women held no sway over him. Even under the influence of drugs, his control remained absolute.

Yet five years ago, a woman entered his room. She shattered the rules he had meticulously upheld his entire life. He believed she would be the only one to ever captivate him. In the years that followed, no one else ignited that same fire within him.

It was utterly bewildering then, that Isabella Montgomery could dismantle his composure so completely. She evoked a fervent, desperate wanting he had not felt since that night.

His kiss stole the air from her lungs. This sensation…it was hauntingly familiar. It dragged her back five years into the past. To that night. To the man who had pressed against her with the same raw intensity as Nathaniel did now.

A wave of cold dread washed over her. Panic, sharp and sudden, seized her. Her teeth sank into his lower lip with brutal force.

A sharp hiss of pain escaped him. His grip on her loosened instinctively.

She shoved him away, scrambling upright. Her eyes blazed with a defensive fury. "What is the meaning of this, Mr. Blackwood? My past does not grant you the right to assault me."

He frowned, his thumb brushing the bead of blood at the corner of his mouth. "That was not my intention—"

"I don't care about your intentions. I expect you to behave. I do not welcome being touched." She moved to stride past him, wanting only to put distance between them. His actions had unearthed a ghost she desperately tried to forget.

His hand shot out, encircling her wrist, halting her retreat. "My apologies," he said, his voice low and solemn. "I lost control."

Her steps faltered. Before she could form a response, he continued. "I merely wished to make something clear, Ms. Montgomery. Your past is of no consequence to me. Furthermore, the proposal I extended upon our first meeting remains open."

The proposal still stands.

The implication hung heavy in the air. He would still marry her. Take a woman like her, soiled and unchaste, as his wife.

A strange, foreign sensation bloomed in her chest. He turned her to face him, his gaze piercing. "If that is the reason for your continued rejection, discard it. The one who should bear the shame is the monster who harmed you, not you. You have done nothing wrong. Why should you deny yourself the happiness you deserve?"

His words, deep and resonant, were a balm and a challenge. They chipped away at the fortress around her heart.

This was the twenty-first century, yet the stain of violation remained a global taboo. A mark of otherness. Even Alexander Whitmore had told her, five years ago, that she had forfeited the right to be choosy. That she was lucky to have any offer at all.

For five years, her mentors had pushed William Kensington toward her. They praised his willingness to accept her. They called it a blessing. Their underlying message was clear: no respectable man would truly want her. Her accomplishments were secondary to the charity of a husband.

Over time, she had internalized it. She stopped believing she deserved love. She stopped chasing it.

And now, out of nowhere, Nathaniel Blackwood was telling her she had done nothing wrong. That she should not abandon her pursuit of happiness.

Confusion swirled within her. Had she wasted years punishing herself for a crime committed against her? Even if he was willing to accept her, did she truly have the right to stand beside him?

"Apologies," she murmured, pulling her wrist from his grasp. "I need to be alone." She pushed the door open and left. The urge to say yes was a tangible ache, but cooler heads were needed. For both of them.
###Chapter 279

Nathaniel’s eyes turned to ice as he watched Isabella walk away. The moment she disappeared from view, he pulled out his phone. He dialed Dominic’s number. “I want the entire Blackthorn Syndicate eliminated,” he commanded. “You have ten days.”

They dared to lay a hand on his woman? He would erase every last trace of them from the earth.

Meanwhile…

Vivienne stepped out of the grand Blackwood Estate. She paused on the gravel driveway. She turned back to look at the imposing mansion.

A cold smirk twisted her lips. Did Nathaniel truly believe she was oblivious? She was a master in every field. Her hearing was far superior to any ordinary person’s. She had distinctly heard faint footsteps from the attic. She had caught the murmur of a child’s voice. And a woman’s.

There was no doubt about it. A woman was hidden inside Nathaniel’s home.

He was keeping a woman secret from her. Who was she? Who could possibly capture Nathaniel’s heart besides Vivienne herself?

She turned sharply to the maid holding the umbrella for her. “Who is the woman living in this mansion?” she demanded.

The maid, Lillian, lowered her head nervously. “I… I don’t know what you’re referring to, Ms. Vivienne.”

Vivienne let out a derisive laugh. “Do not take me for a fool. Remember your place. I am the woman respected by the Old Master and Madam. I am the future mistress of this house. Choose your next words very carefully.”

Lillian felt a chill run down her spine. She knew Vivienne had the favor of the elders. But her loyalty was to Boss Blackwood. Betraying him would be a fatal mistake.

“Your silence is telling,” Vivienne hissed. Her voice was laced with venom. “Do you think you will keep your position if this umbrella ‘accidentally’ injures me? Hmm?”

The threat was clear. Lillian’s job hung by a thread.

Lillian’s hands trembled. This job was everything. Her parents had used all their connections to secure it for her. She couldn’t lose it.

Defeated, she whispered the name. “It’s Isabella Montgomery.”

Isabella Montgomery.

Vivienne’s eyes darkened instantly. So it was her.

She had heard the rumors from Seraphina before. She had dismissed them as lies meant to provoke her. She never imagined they held truth.

Isabella was truly with Nathaniel. She was living under his roof.

It all made sense now. This was why Nathaniel had been so distant. That home-wrecker Isabella had seduced him. The image of Isabella’s flawless, captivating face filled her mind. Pure malice ignited in Vivienne’s gaze.

They got into the waiting car. Her assistant, Cassandra, spoke up. “This Isabella Montgomery is dangerously skilled. You must be cautious. Look at this.” She handed her phone to Vivienne.

The screen displayed blazing headlines that overshadowed major news: ‘Agent Isabella’. A video clip showed Isabella moving with lethal, expert precision. How could a mere adopted daughter from a minor family possess such abilities?

Vivienne’s expression soured further. This news was connected to Genevieve. Genevieve was an old friend. They had maintained contact over the years.
###Chapter 280

A sudden idea struck Vivienne as she quickly dialed Genevieve’s number. “Gigi, how are you holding up?”

“I’m… managing,” Genevieve’s voice trembled, heavy with sorrow. “Please, just let me be alone right now.”

Vivienne sighed softly. “I know it hurts, but he isn’t worth your tears. I just saw Harrison visiting Arabella—all because she manipulated him with her victim act. Don’t waste another second on a man like that!”

“He… went to see her?” Genevieve’s voice broke, sounding utterly defeated. The line went dead moments later.

She had ended the call.

A cold, calculating gleam flashed in Vivienne’s eyes. So Isabella thought she could win public favor by saving Arabella? She would regret that decision soon enough. Crushing her company was only the beginning!

Less than an hour later, a new headline exploded across the internet. Genevieve had slit her wrists in her bathtub. This was no publicity stunt—the tub was filled with blood, a horrifying scene. She would have died if her maids hadn’t found her in time.

Photos of an unconscious Genevieve being rushed to the hospital spread like wildfire. Her three-year-old daughter wept uncontrollably, her tiny face streaked with tears as she cried for her mother.

The images went viral instantly.

[I’m so angry I could scream! Gigi deserves so much better! That poor little girl… my heart breaks for her!]

[Scarlet destroyed a beautiful family! I hope that homewrecker rots in hell!]

[Gigi is an actual angel—gentle and kind. Why would Scarlet do something so cruel to her?!]

[Let’s be real, the real villain here is Isabella Montgomery. She never should have saved Scarlet today. If she hadn’t interfered, Scarlet would be dead and Gigi wouldn’t have tried to take her own life.]

[Stop with that nonsense. Our sweet Gigi would never wish death on anyone. She’s just heartbroken by how cruel this world can be. If I were her, I wouldn’t understand why a homewrecker gets to be saved either.]

[Isabella saved Scarlet and publicly defended her. She’s basically rubbing salt in Gigi’s wounds!]

[That video of her jumping off a building to save Scarlet is everywhere now. It’s so obviously staged for clout!]

[Disgusting! Isabella and Scarlet should both just disappear!]

Netizens quickly turned their rage toward Isabella for saving Arabella, making her the new target of their fury.

But it didn’t end there.

Vivienne tweeted: [Some women will sell their souls for money and attention. What do you actually gain from being a homewrecker? Have some shame!]

Vivienne was celebrated as the nation’s top socialite, often compared to royalty. She attended elite events, held multiple patents, and had built a global reputation through her genius innovations. Her social media following neared a billion.

She was a self-made icon in high society, admired for her accomplishments without relying on family connections. Her influence was immense. With one tweet, industry leaders flocked to support her message.

Seraphina Delacroix retweeted Vivienne’s post and added her own: [Scarlet owes Gigi a public apology! Homewreckers don’t belong in this industry—and neither do the people who enable them! We should never support wrongdoing!]

Both women were powerful figures with massive followings. Since Arabella was clearly in the wrong, their tweets ignited a firestorm of attacks against her, Isabella, and GoldenPhoenix Company.

Behind the scenes, business partners quietly agreed to sever ties with Isabella. They would rather pay termination fees than be associated with her scandal.

Just like that, GoldenPhoenix and Isabella were thrust into the eye of the storm, with public opinion turning violently against them.
###Chapter 281

At the Blackwood Estate, Isabella was on a call.

“You don’t need to help me anymore, Isabella,” Arabella’s weak voice came through, heavy with guilt. “Let me go out and confess. Someone like me deserves to die. I can’t drag you and your company down with me.”

“You’ll drag the company down if you die now! Do you have any idea how much GoldenPhoenix has lost because of you? If you truly want to die, at least pay me back seven billion first,” Isabella shot back.

Arabella was stunned by the harsh words. Seven billion… How could she possibly have that kind of money? Supermodels appeared to live glamorous lives, but the reality was different. They spent fortunes on designer gowns and jewelry for every public appearance. While regular people could wear affordable clothes, a supermodel would be crucified online for it. On top of that, Arabella had made significant charitable donations and had given Harrison a substantial amount of money.

She didn’t have seven billion. If she died now, Isabella would suffer a massive financial loss because of her…

Her pride wouldn’t allow that.

Noting Arabella’s silence, Isabella continued, “Don’t worry. My people are gathering evidence right now. This will be resolved before the Celestial Gala. If you feel guilty, just focus on staying alive until then.”

Arabella gave a quiet sound of acknowledgment before hanging up, still consumed by misery and depression. Netizens were scrutinizing her, Isabella, and GoldenPhoenix relentlessly. The situation was incredibly complex. Could Isabella really turn things around?

It seemed highly unlikely…

Isabella sat by the garden pond, absently picking up a small stone and tossing it into the water. She wasn’t worried about Arabella anymore; she was more preoccupied with her complicated relationship with Nathaniel.

Should she tell him the whole truth? She still hadn’t told him about the pregnancy all those years ago…

Yet, it might not even matter. Nathaniel was so determined and persistent. Why was he so certain about her after such a short time? Everything was moving too fast. Isabella didn’t feel ready for any of it.

Suddenly, a deep red rose appeared in her line of sight. She turned to find Nathaniel standing beside her, having approached without a sound. He offered her the rose with an elegant, refined gesture. “When you can’t decide, let fate decide for you.”

Let fate decide?

Nathaniel began plucking the petals from the rose one by one, mimicking a scene from a romantic movie. What would be left once all the petals were gone?

Isabella stood up, brushing off her clothes. “I’m not a child. A person should make their own decisions. This is serious. Give me two more months. I’ll give you my answer before our contract ends.”

Nathaniel frowned. Two months felt like an eternity.

Nevertheless…

“Alright. I’ll wait for your answer.”

Since she would be staying at the Blackwood Estate for the next two months, he had plenty of time to win her over.

At that moment, Isabella remembered Vivienne. “Maybe I should move back to Rosewood Manor for a while?” Her eyes met his. “I’d prefer to keep this private for now.”

“Don’t worry. Today was just a coincidence. I wasn’t prepared. When she comes tomorrow, she’ll want to leave immediately.” A subtle glint shone in Nathaniel’s dark eyes.

Isabella frowned. Did that mean he had a plan for tomorrow? Vivienne was notoriously stubborn. How could she be made to back down so easily?

Isabella was deeply curious. She could hardly wait for the next day to arrive.

The next day came. Isabella was in the computer room from the crack of dawn. She was completely absorbed in her research, headphones on, blocking out the world.
###Chapter 282

Isabella Montgomery worked intently at her computer station.

Nathaniel Blackwood sat nearby on the sofa, reviewing company documents.

Their son Oliver quietly did his homework beside Isabella.

Though no words were exchanged, a comfortable silence enveloped them.

Nathaniel had moved his temporary office into the computer room to stay close.

Dominic Sterling entered and announced, "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Montgomery, Vivienne Delacroix has arrived at the gate."

Isabella immediately turned to Nathaniel. "Handle this quickly."

She knew Vivienne's temper could escalate things to the Blackwood family elders.

Nathaniel remained completely calm. "Everything is under control."

He gave Oliver a subtle signal.

The boy set down his textbook and told Isabella, "Mommy, I'll handle this. You stay with Daddy. Watch me send her away from the monitors!"

He hurried out with determined steps.

Isabella frowned worriedly at Nathaniel. "You're letting a five-year-old confront her? She's dangerous."

A woman like Vivienne might harm Oliver without hesitation.

Nathaniel activated all the security monitors. "Just watch, Ms. Montgomery."

His confident tone suggested he had planned for every possibility.

Screens displayed every angle of the mansion's entrance hall.

Isabella's concern didn't fade. What had he prepared that made him so certain?

Downstairs in the grand lobby...

Vivienne Delacroix entered with her usual air of superiority.

All staff immediately bowed and greeted, "Ms. Delacroix."

Oliver came running toward her. "Aunt Vivienne! You came!"

Vivienne eyed him suspiciously. The boy usually ignored her completely.

His sudden enthusiasm seemed out of character.

But Oliver was Nathaniel's greatest weakness.

Winning his affection could secure her position as future Mrs. Blackwood.

She approached him with false sweetness. "You seem cheerful today, sweetheart. Where's your father?"

"Daddy had urgent business at headquarters. He told me to spend time with you. He said you might become my new Mommy."

Oliver delivered the lines with perfect innocence.

Vivienne's eyes lit up with triumph. "He actually said that?"

"Of course! Daddy said it depends on how well we get along. He just wants someone who can be a good mother to me."

Oliver looked up with wide, hopeful eyes. "Do you really want to be my Mommy, Aunt Vivienne? Will you treat me like your own son? Will you play games with me?"

"Absolutely," Vivienne answered without hesitation.

She reached to pat his head. "I've always loved children. I'll definitely treat you well."

"Then will you play with me? Daddy's always working. I get so lonely."

Oliver tugged her hand gently with pleading eyes.

Vivienne had never seen him act so affectionately.

Though she despised the child's biological mother, she needed his approval.

"What would you like to play? I'll play anything you want."

"Yay! Finally someone will play with me! Come with me, Aunt Vivienne!"

Oliver eagerly pulled her toward the back gardens.

Vivienne followed, pleased at how easily she was winning him over.

She hadn't expected him to lead her outside.

In the extensive gardens stood a massive...
###Chapter 283

A massive steel enclosure dominated the room. Inside coiled over a dozen enormous serpents. The smallest among them measured at least the width of a woman's wrist. The largest rivaled the circumference of a large serving bowl. It was a truly terrifying spectacle.

Isabella stared, her scalp prickling with unease. Goosebumps erupted across her skin.

Oliver skipped toward the cage cheerfully. "Aunt Vivienne, come see!" he chirped. "These are all my friends. This is Sir Emerald. This is Lady Crimson. And this is Lady Gold."

His small hand reached through the bars. He began stroking the massive reptiles. The pythons displayed a variety of hideous colors. The yellow one was particularly nauseating. Its garish, overly bright scales made it distinctly stand out.

Vivienne remained pale near the doorway. "Christopher, do you only play with them in daylight?" she blurted. "Perhaps I could take you somewhere else? For a different activity?"

His expression fell. "But they haven't eaten today," he protested. "I need to feed them. And give them a bath. You promised you'd stay with me, Aunt Vivienne. Will you help me feed them?" His innocent eyes pleaded with her.

Her gaze drifted back to the cage. About ten monstrous snakes writhed together. The sight made her shudder violently. Yet, this was a rare moment of Oliver seeking her attention. She couldn't let this chance slip away.

They were securely behind bars. It had to be safe... right?

She forced a steadying breath. "What... what do they eat?"

###Chapter 284

"Over there, Aunt Vivienne." He pointed to a corner. "Could you please bring them for me?"

She turned. Another metal cage sat in the shadowy corner. It was filled with live frogs! Their bumpy, mottled skin looked utterly disgusting and frightening.

Vivienne's face contorted in revulsion. "The snakes eat... these?"

"Yes! I'll show you!" Oliver hurried over. He grabbed a struggling frog. He carried it back to the python enclosure. He placed it near one of the larger snakes. Instantly, the python's maw gaped open. It was a bloody, horrifying sight. The frog disappeared into its throat.

Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!

The frog's desperate, muffled cries came from inside the serpent's mouth.

Vivienne trembled violently. Her limbs locked with pure terror and disgust. How could this child not be terrified by such a gruesome scene? Why was he asking for her help?

Did he expect her to hand-feed frogs to these monsters?

Absolutely not!

Every ounce of courage drained from her. "Christopher, let the staff handle this," she called out, her voice edging toward command. "Come here. I'll take you to do something much more fun."

"No! No!" Oliver stamped his foot. "I've fed them since they hatched! I take care of them every single day! Daddy helps me feed them when he's home. He said my future Mommy would help me too!

"Aunt Vivienne, you do want to be my Mommy, don't you?" His voice wavered. "Or... or do you not like me at all?"

###Chapter 285

The moment Vivienne Delacroix departed from the estate, Oliver Blackwood bounded up the staircase with unrestrained glee. He launched himself directly into Isabella Montgomery's waiting arms, chirping excitedly, "It's finished! Mommy and Daddy don't need to worry about her anymore. She won't be back for three whole days!"

"Thank you, sweetheart. Weren't you frightened of those pythons?" Isabella asked, her voice laced with maternal concern. He was merely five years old. How could he confront so many large snakes without showing a hint of fear?

Oliver beamed, shaking his head. "Not at all! I watched them grow up. Daddy was always away, so I had no one to play with. They became my playmates. They're very gentle and have never hurt anyone. I adore them!"

His innocent, childlike confession tugged painfully at Isabella's heartstrings. So, he truly had grown up in solitude. His grandparents showed him no affection, he lacked a mother's presence, and his father was often absent. If she were to leave him someday, would he be forced to return to that lonely existence?

A sharp ache pierced her heart. Isabella drew a deep, steadying breath and praised warmly, "My clever boy! Mommy will prepare something special for you, alright? How about a delicious lobster roll?"

"Really? A lobster roll? I want a lobster roll!" Oliver chirped, jumping with uncontainable joy.

"Absolutely." Isabella took his small hand and led him toward the kitchen. She didn't even bother to shut down the computer; her sole focus was on spending precious time with Oliver.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel Blackwood's intense gaze remained fixed on the computer screen. It displayed a sophisticated management platform teeming with thousands of video recordings. His eyes darkened with intrigue. What other remarkable capabilities did this woman possess?

Isabella guided Oliver into the expansive kitchen. All the maids immediately lowered their heads in a respectful greeting. "Ms. Montgomery."

"You may all take a break. I'll handle lunch preparation myself," Isabella stated calmly, her eyes already scanning the room. She spotted a basket brimming with high-quality, sustainably farmed lobsters in the corner. They were impressively large and impeccably clean.

The maids exchanged nervous glances, shaking their heads in unison. "Ms. Montgomery, that's highly inappropriate! Please, simply instruct us on the menu for today...!"

"Don't worry. Consider it a direct order. Go and rest," Isabella insisted firmly, settling beside the basket and gesturing for Oliver to join her.

Oliver shot the maids a decisive look, and they reluctantly filed out of the kitchen. He skipped over to Isabella, his face alight with excitement. "Mommy, are these lobsters? Is it okay for children to eat them?"

"Of course! Mommy will make you a tomato lobster roll. It's packed with calcium and magnesium, excellent for strengthening your immune system," she explained warmly.

As she spoke, Isabella selected a lively lobster and began handling it with practiced, skillful precision. She first severed its powerful claws, then expertly split open the tail. She meticulously cleaned the head and stomach cavity.

Oliver watched, his eyes wide with awe. "Mommy, you know how to prepare lobsters?"

Most of the socialites who relentlessly pursued his father couldn't even boil water. It astounded him that Isabella was not only breathtakingly beautiful but also possessed such impressive culinary skills for complex dishes!

"Naturally! When I was in Africa, I always cooked for myself. During my training, I even—" Isabella abruptly cut herself off, realizing she had ventured into forbidden territory. She glanced at Oliver and swiftly changed the subject. "Anyway, Mommy is full of surprises. I'll make you the most delicious lobster roll. Why don't you go help me chop some onions?"

"Okay! Yes!" Oliver agreed happily, hopping to his feet.

However, most of the fresh vegetables and herbs were cultivated in the estate's extensive outdoor garden, harvested only as needed. Oliver, accompanied by a few maids, headed out to gather the ingredients.

Isabella watched his retreating back with a deeply affectionate gaze. As long as Oliver continued to expand his knowledge and skills, he would fill his time meaningfully and make his life far more enriching. Besides, she realized she had never properly cooked a special meal for him since they'd met.

Fully immersed in her task, Isabella continued preparing the lobster with intense concentration. Suddenly, a distinct, sinister hissing sound broke the silence.

That was odd. A prickle of suspicion ran down her spine. Isabella turned her head cautiously, her eyes scanning the kitchen.

Her blood ran cold.

Dozens of massive pythons were slithering directly toward her!
###Chapter 286

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.

The massive pythons surged into the kitchen.
Some came through the doorway.
Others slid through the open window behind the sink.
All of them moved toward Isabella Montgomery.

These were the same snakes she had seen on the security feeds.
Each one was thick, muscular, and terrifyingly long.
A truly horrifying sight.

Within seconds, dozens of pythons had closed in.
They were now just two meters away from her.
Hidden in the shadows, Lillian Prescott smiled with deep satisfaction.
Vivienne Delacroix had promised her a huge reward for traumatizing Isabella.
When Lillian thought about it, it made perfect sense.

A celebrity like Isabella, who rose to fame through scandals and came from a modest background, was no match for Vivienne.
The elegant Vivienne presided over multiple corporations and knew how to properly reward loyalty.
Isabella was just some flashy nouveau riche who had never given Lillian anything.
So cheap!

Quietly, Lillian raised her phone to record everything.
She was ready to capture the pure terror on Isabella’s face and send it straight to Vivienne.

But…

Isabella didn’t even flinch as the snakes advanced.
She remained seated at the table.
She let out a soft, dismissive scoff.
“All of you,” she commanded, her voice sharp and heavy with authority. “Sit.”

Four words.
That was all it took.
The pythons, poised to strike, suddenly froze.
Every single one settled down and went completely still.

Lillian stared in disbelief.
How… How was this possible?

These pythons only listened to Oliver.
He always spoke to them in a gentle, soothing tone.
He even got hurt if he raised his voice accidentally.
But Isabella had just shouted at them with aggression… and they obeyed?

Isabella continued calmly brushing seasoning onto the lobsters.
Her gaze, however, was fixed on the snakes—icy and intimidating.
“I’m preparing these for your little master,” she stated coldly. “If you’re looking for trouble, I’ll add you to the broth.”

Her words seemed to insult one of the larger pythons.
It raised its head, its eyes sharp and hostile.
It looked ready to lunge at any second.
The snake was as thick as a large bowl—a truly horrifying sight.

Yet Isabella showed no fear.
She glared right back at it. “What are you staring at?” she snapped. “How dare you little cretins come out to scare people? Go back to your cage! Now go find whoever let you out!” Her order was final and left no room for argument.

For a moment, the pythons didn’t move.
Then Isabella raised her hand and flicked her wrist.
Immediately, the snakes changed direction.
They began slithering toward the opposite side of the kitchen.

Directly toward the pillar where Lillian was hiding.

Lillian trembled violently.
Her phone clattered to the floor.

“Don’t… don’t come any closer!” she shrieked.

Why were they listening to Isabella?!
The pythons closed in rapidly.
In a blink, the largest one was only half a meter away.

“Argh!” The terrified maid turned and sprinted for her life.
The pythons gave chase, not letting her escape.
The scene descended into pure chaos.

Isabella wiped her hands clean.
She walked over and picked up Lillian’s fallen phone.
The screen was still lit, showing an open WhatsApp chat with Vivienne Delacroix.
The message history was clear.

Vivienne had written: (Send me a clip of Isabella terrified by the pythons.)

Isabella’s eyes darkened.
So Vivienne had discovered she was staying at the Blackwood Estate.
She had even bribed a maid to harm her.

Isabella had never wanted to start a conflict.
But since Vivienne had chosen to make a move, Isabella wouldn’t just sit back and take it.

She wanted to see a terrified expression?
She could keep dreaming.

A wicked smirk curled on Isabella’s lips.
Her fingers flew across the phone’s keyboard.
She sent a link.
###Chapter 287

At the Delacroix estate…

Vivienne was soaking in her marble tub. The memory of that python coiling around her thigh haunted her thoughts. A violent shudder wracked her body.

That bitch Isabella had to experience that same terror!

Her phone screen lit up on the vanity. It had to be Lillian. Vivienne snatched it eagerly, ready to watch footage of Isabella completely unraveling from a python attack.

Hah! Always acting so cold and superior. ‘Boss Montgomery’? Please. Isabella would be a sobbing mess facing those snakes.

Vivienne tapped the video. The screen instantly went black. Then, a massive, hyper-realistic python materialized. Its scales glistened. Its head filled the entire display. It seemed to lock its reptilian eyes directly on her. It lunged straight for the screen.

“Ahhh!”

A blood-curdling scream tore from Vivienne’s throat. Her hands trembled violently. She flung the phone away from her.

It splashed into the bathwater. The waterproof device remained active. The horrifying 3D python continued its slithering motion in the tub. It looked utterly real.

“Help! Somebody! Get in here!” she shrieked, her voice cracking with pure panic.

This was worse than any accidental horror jump-scare. Her deepest fear was snakes. This visual was too vivid. Too lifelike. It was a waking nightmare.

Her personal assistant, Cassandra, burst through the bathroom door. She found Vivienne huddled and shaking at one end of the large tub. The phone glowed ominously from the water, the python still coiling.

The sight made Cassandra flinch. She steeled herself. She quickly fished the phone out. She tried to force a shutdown.

It was useless. The power button did nothing. The screen remained dominated by the slithering serpent. It tilted its head. Its forked tongue flickered out menacingly.

It was deeply unsettling.

Cassandra’s composure wavered. She grabbed a thick bath towel. She wrapped the possessed device tightly. “Try to relax, Madam. I’ll have this looked at immediately.” She hurried from the room, clutching the bundled phone.

Silence returned to the steamy bathroom. Vivienne’s heart hammered against her ribs. The real pythons were traumatic enough. Now someone sent a digital one to torment her?

That useless Lillian!

No… Lillian was just a maid. She lacked the spine for this.

It was her. That Montgomery witch.

Not only did Isabella steal her intended match, but she also dared to retaliate like this? Who did that low-class woman think she was? Vivienne would make her regret this.

Vivienne climbed out of the tub. She roughly toweled off and threw on a silk robe. She stormed into her study. She powered up her laptop. She opened a secure line to a senior executive at TitanTech.

“Push the headline about Arabella and Isabella to every single TitanTech user. Now.”

TitanTech was her premier national phone brand. It commanded over half the domestic market share. Millions used its devices. A system-wide notification would ensure the entire country saw the story about Isabella’s interference.

The executive complied instantly.

That same hour, every TitanTech user received a system alert:

Homewrecking Gold Digger Exposed! Click to see how a mistress and a Diamond Boss corrupted justice!

The salacious headline was designed for maximum clicks. Vivienne then placed another call. She arranged to meet Seraphina Delacroix. They would visit Genevieve Beaumont in the hospital. They needed to get a new recording.
###Chapter 288

Genevieve lay deathly pale on the hospital bed. Her sunken eyes remained shut, her complexion ashen. Her three-year-old daughter clung to the bedside, her small face swollen from endless tears.

The little girl tugged weakly at her mother’s limp hand. “Mommy, why did Daddy leave us? Was I bad? I can be better, I promise…”

Her tiny voice cracked. “Mommy, please wake up. I don’t want to be alone. I miss your hugs…”

The heartbreaking pleas echoed through the sterile room. Genevieve’s eyes fluttered open. Tears welled and spilled over, tracing paths down her hollow cheeks.

She pulled her daughter into a trembling embrace. Their shared sobs shook the narrow bed.

The scene was devastating.

A video of their grief spread like wildfire online. Sympathy poured in from thousands.

The mother and daughter duo trended worldwide.

(My heart is shattered! That innocent baby doesn’t deserve this!)

(The other woman should rot in hell! She deserves the cruelest punishment!)

(Why did Isabella save Arabella? They’re both monsters!)

(Seraphina is a true friend. Warning her customers about this scandal? She’s taking a stand against Isabella and Arabella! Respect!)

(They should beg for forgiveness at Genevieve’s bedside and then disappear!)

Netizens unleashed a torrent of hatred. Their words were knives aimed at Isabella and Arabella.

Seraphina, however, was celebrated. She was hailed as “The Most Ethical CEO” and “The Entrepreneur with a Conscience.”

Inside the Blackwood Estate…

The pythons had been relentless. They chased Lillian through the halls until Nathaniel himself intervened.

He commanded order. The snakes were returned to their enclosures.

Then came his decree. “Remove her from the estate.”

Lillian froze. Dread washed over her. He was exiling her? “Mr. Blackwood, why?” she cried. “I’ve done nothing wrong!”

Nathaniel didn’t bother to look back. A cold scoff was his only reply. His presence was absolute as he walked away.

Dominic dragged her out of the main hall. “The boss isn’t stupid,” he hissed. “You know exactly what you did. Get ready to live on the streets.”

He threw her out past the iron gates. His final words were a death sentence. The Blackwood family’s protection was gone. No one would ever hire her again.

Betraying Nathaniel Blackwood always ended in ruin.

Back inside the estate, in the kitchen…

Isabella had disposed of Lillian’s phone. She returned to preparing the lobsters.

Oliver stood beside her, confused. “Mommy, how did the snakes get out? Why were they chasing her?”

Isabella’s eyes darkened. The truth was simple. Lillian had planted a pouch of pheromone powder on her. A scent designed to enrage the pythons.

A quick flick of her wrist had sent the powder right back into Lillian’s own pocket.

But Oliver didn’t need to know the cruel calculations of adults. “Perhaps she annoyed them,” Isabella said softly. “Or did something she shouldn’t have. Don’t worry, sweetheart. If you’re good, you have nothing to fear.”

She turned to the stove. “Now step back, my love. The oil might splash. I’d be heartbroken if you got hurt.”

“Okay, Mommy!” Oliver’s worry vanished. The promise of lobster made him retreat with a happy smile.

Isabella cranked the flame to high. Oil shimmered in the wok. She tossed in garlic, scallions, and dried chilies.

The air filled with an aromatic sizzle.

Then came the lobsters. They hit the hot oil and turned a brilliant crimson. They looked utterly delicious.

Her phone rang sharply.

She answered. Julian’s voice was tense and direct. “We have another problem. The organizer of the Celestial Gala is causing a scene at SilverPeak. You need to get here now.”

Another issue? What now?
###Chapter 289

Isabella glanced at the sizzling lobsters in the pan, then at Christopher’s wide, expectant eyes. “Two hours,” she told Julian Hawthorne firmly. “I’ll be at the office by then.”

“Understood.”

She ended the call and turned back to the stove. “Plates, sweetheart. Dinner’s almost ready.”

“Yes, Mommy!” Christopher hurried to help, his small hands carefully setting the table.

Only when he stepped away did Isabella pull out her phone. Her screen flooded with notifications.

[TitanTech Founder Slams Isabella and Arabella]

[Genius Vivienne Delacroix and Top Model Seraphina Delacroix Back Genevieve]

[Genevieve and Daughter Break Down in Tears]

Every headline twisted the narrative against her and Arabella Fontaine. Her Twitter DMs overflowed with rage. Followers demanded why she’d protect someone like Arabella.

Then Johnson Spencer—no, Harrison Winslow—chose to speak. His post made her blood boil.

[I acknowledge my weakness. I gave in to temptation. I vow to become a better man and spend my life making amends to my wife, Genevieve, and our daughter.]

He painted Arabella as the seductress. The homewrecker.

His tweet exploded. Retweets, quotes, outrage. It nearly broke the platform. Then someone leaked Arabella’s location: GoldenPhoenix, under Isabella’s protection.

The mob descended on Isabella’s social media.

Shameless company! Hand over the mistress!

Apologize!

How could you choose money over morals?

I was a fan, Boss Montgomery. This is disgusting!

Boycott GoldenPhoenix! Bankrupt Isabella!

Drive her out of the industry!

It felt coordinated. Manufactured fury. Every brand Isabella worked with faced backlash. Chanel, Gucci—they scrubbed her from their pages. Production companies cut ties with GoldenPhoenix artists. Anything linked to her was toxic.

GoldenPhoenix teetered on the edge.

Isabella’s jaw tightened. The clock was ticking. Her team was still gathering evidence. Without it, Arabella was finished. So was her company.

She called Maxwell Carter. “Use the badge. Mobilize everyone. I need answers. Now.”

The lobster rolls were ready. She filled them carefully. Despite the chaos, she sat down to eat with Christopher and Nathaniel.

It was Christopher’s first time trying lobster. Nathaniel usually forbade it. The boy’s face lit up with each bite.

Nathaniel barely touched his food. His eyes stayed on Isabella. “Let me handle this.”

“No.” Her voice was soft but firm. “I’ve got it.”

She knew Vivienne Delacroix was behind this. Seraphina wanted to crush GoldenPhoenix. Vivienne wanted to destroy her.

If Nathaniel stepped in, Vivienne would only sneer. She had to prove she didn’t need his power. She could fight this battle alone.

After dinner, she checked the time. Almost there. “Time for your nap, sweetie. Mommy has to go to the office. I’ll be back soon.”

Christopher put down his half-eaten roll. “I want to come with you, Mommy.”
###Chapter 290

Isabella glanced at Oliver. "I'm taking the motorcycle today. Can't bring a passenger. If you leave now, all these lobster rolls get tossed."

The Blackwood Estate had strict rules. No leftovers permitted. Uneaten food went straight to the trash.

Oliver snatched a roll. "No! Momo loves Mommy! My heart goes with Mommy! My stomach stays to finish these!"

"Good boy." Isabella ruffled his hair. She stood to leave.

Oliver kicked Nathaniel under the table. Nathaniel wiped his mouth. He rose to escort her.

"Let me drive you," Nathaniel offered.

"Unnecessary. GoldenPhoenix will be crowded. Too much exposure risk." Isabella pulled on her gloves.

Nathaniel frowned. His expression turned serious. "Exposure doesn't concern me."

His words stunned her. He didn't care? He was Nathaniel Blackwood! Why did he act like a lovesick teenager sometimes? Their relationship wasn't even official yet. How would she explain this to everyone?

"We'll discuss it after you've properly courted me." She secured her helmet. The motorcycle roared to life. She sped away.

Nathaniel watched her disappear. A thoughtful gaze settled on his face. Court her? How does one court a wild she-wolf? Taming an actual wolf might be easier...

Sebastian pulled up just then. His car halted before Nathaniel. "Brother. Progress. They collected skin cells from thirty women. All from the presidential suite's bedside. DNA investigation starts immediately."

Nathaniel remained impassive. No joy touched his features. This news would have thrilled him once. But now he had Isabella. What did finding that woman matter anymore?

What if that woman demanded responsibility? What if Isabella discovered his past? He accepted her history. But would she accept his?

His brow furrowed. "Continue the investigation. Report the findings."

"Understood." Sebastian sensed something off. Why did his brother seem displeased?

At GoldenPhoenix...

Isabella parked in the underground garage. She took the elevator directly to the top-floor conference room.

Adrian spotted her. He hurried over. "Isabella. The situation escalates. Celestial Gala's organizer refuses to engage. I exhausted all options. Even offered a luxury cruise. She declined. Julian is still negotiating. She appears immovable. Three of our artists have contracts with them. The total penalty approaches ten billion!"

Ten billion. Even as the Diamond Boss, that sum made her wince.

"I'll handle it." Isabella strode toward the conference room.

Inside, Julian pleaded with Beatrice Worthington. "Isabella will resolve this. She'll provide a satisfactory answer within days."

"Days? I'm terminating the contracts today! The clauses are clear. Artists must maintain clean reputations. Your entire management and artists failed! So what if she fixes it? A former mistress leading our show? Celestial Gala is no ordinary event! It's government-funded! Globally advertised! International audience! A mistress as Lead would create a global joke! Embarrass our nation! The contracts end today! Pay the penalties!" Beatrice's tone brooked no argument.
###Chapter 291

Isabella pushed the door open and stepped inside. Her voice remained steady. “Ms. Worthington wishes to terminate the contracts?”

She paused for a brief moment. “That is acceptable.”

“Acceptable?”

Did Isabella Montgomery just say it was acceptable?

Adrian Sinclair stared at her in disbelief. He quickly moved to her side, his voice a hushed, urgent whisper. “Have you completely lost your mind, Isabella?”

Julian Hawthorne looked equally distressed, his face etched with a deep frown. Terminating these contracts meant a staggering ten-billion-dollar loss. Their artists would also lose their chance to attend the prestigious event.

There seemed to be no way to recover from this.

Isabella walked calmly to the head of the conference table and took the president’s seat. Her gaze was fixed on Beatrice. “Ten billion is not a problem for me. I can arrange the payment immediately.”

She leaned forward slightly. “However, you should consider this. I will only be losing ten billion. You, Ms. Worthington, will be losing an invaluable opportunity at the Celestial Gala in three days.”

With a sharp flick of her wrist, she pushed a proposal folder across the polished table.

Skreet.

The folder slid smoothly directly toward Beatrice. Beatrice picked it up and opened it. Her eyes widened as she scanned the contents.

The proposal was… exceptional.

Even under immense pressure, Isabella had devised a truly ingenious strategy.

The entire plan, however, hinged on Arabella’s innocence. Beatrice lifted her eyes to meet Isabella’s. “Harrison Winslow has already given his public statement. How can you claim Arabella was deceived? Do you possess any proof?”

“The evidence will be here within the next forty-eight hours. You should review my track record, Ms. Worthington. I have never failed to deliver on my word,” Isabella stated, her confidence radiating an almost regal authority.

It was intimidating.

“Under different circumstances, I would not hesitate to take this risk,” Beatrice conceded. “But the Celestial Gala is different.”

She placed the proposal back on the table. “Every costume for that event is custom-made for each specific artist. My team would need to work non-stop for a minimum of three days to produce just one garment. This is precisely why the liquidation damages are so extraordinarily high.”

Her tone was final. “Therefore, I must terminate the contracts with your artists today. I need to immediately begin searching for suitable replacements. I apologize, but this is the only logical course of action.”

Isabella’s expression darkened. She had not anticipated such stubbornness. Beatrice doubted her capabilities and distrusted her guarantee. The apprehension was understandable; even a one percent chance of failure could catastrophically damage the Celestial Gala.

It seemed termination was the only option left. Just as Isabella was about to reluctantly agree…

“Ms. Worthington, surely there’s no need for such haste? Can we not discuss this further?” A deep, magnetic voice cut through the tense atmosphere.

All heads turned toward the door.

Alexander Whitmore walked into the room, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.

Isabella frowned. What was Alexander doing at her company?

Beatrice, however, immediately stood up, a surprised smile gracing her features. “Alexander! What a pleasant surprise. What brings you here?”

“I heard you were paying a visit, Ms. Worthington. It seemed only right that I stop by to say hello. You are an exceptionally busy woman. You never seem to have time for me these days.” His tone was warm, laced with a hint of playful humor.

Beatrice chuckled softly. “Look at you, still such a charmer! I wouldn’t be where I am today without your help all those years ago. I’ve just been preoccupied with some minor issues recently.”

There was a history between them. Years ago, Beatrice had been hiking in a remote wilderness area. She had run out of oxygen near a mountain peak and was close to death. Alexander had been there. He provided her with an oxygen tank and stayed with her until she recovered.
###Chapter 292

Isabella had felt indebted to Alexander ever since the rescue incident. His tarnished reputation did nothing to diminish her respect for him.

Alexander glanced at the proposal on the table. "These are minor adjustments with minimal costs. I'm confident Isabella can handle them. If you remain unsatisfied, I'll secure top-tier artists for the show." He produced a list and handed it to Beatrice. "I've already prepared potential candidates."

Beatrice scanned the document, recognizing renowned SilverPeak artists. Their measurements aligned perfectly with Arabella's team, eliminating need for costume modifications.

Her expression softened considerably. "Excellent work! You've always been so thorough. I'll allow two more days then."

"Thank you, Ms. Worthington," Alexander responded with polished grace.

"Continue your efforts, young man. Remember—it's never too late to cherish what matters. Isabella deserves your devotion." Beatrice gave his shoulder an approving pat before exiting.

Alexander offered a polite nod before turning his attention to Isabella. He anticipated gratitude, but she rose without acknowledgment, moving toward the exit.

"Isabella." He reached for her, but Adrian intercepted with a protective stance. "Mr. Whitmore, maintain appropriate boundaries. The contract termination severs all ties. Do not touch her."

Alexander withdrew his hovering hand awkwardly. "I only wish to speak. Ms. Worthington was right—we learn through errors. Won't you grant me one opportunity?"

Errors? He reduced their history to mere mistakes?

"What purpose exists in sparing a murderer?" Isabella's scoff carried glacial sharpness. "If mistakes taught lessons, why would law enforcement exist?"

Her words landed with precise, brutal clarity.

Alexander's kick had killed her unborn child. Though not his, it remained a life extinguished. How dared he seek redemption after such brutality?

Did he truly believe she couldn't discern his motives? Marriage. Domination. Asset acquisition.

Delusional arrogance.

"Security!" Her command echoed.

Ten guards immediately flooded the room, forming a barrier around Isabella. Shielded by their presence, she exited with an icy, untamable aura.

Alexander stood cornered under the guards' vigilant stares. His gaze hardened as he watched her retreat.

The timid girl who once trailed after him had transformed into an unattainable force.

What fueled her audacity? Her diamond enterprise? Or failing GoldenPhoenix? She owed ten billion without his intervention! How dared she treat him thus? A raped woman who delivered a dead fetus—what right had she to arrogance? Did she truly believe Nathaniel would marry her?

Hmph! She required a harsh lesson.

Outside, the parking lot revealed a vandalized motorcycle. Deep scratches marred its surface. Rotten eggs and fruit splattered across the seat. The handlebars bore unmistakable graffiti:

DIE, ISABELLA!

Her frown deepened. Who would do this?
###Chapter 293

The underground garage was monitored with cameras everywhere. Who would dare cause such destruction?

Isabella pulled out her phone to investigate, then noticed several other vehicles nearby were also vandalized.

Each car bore the same spray-painted message: [TRAITOR! GO BANKRUPT!]

Every tire had been slashed, rendering them undrivable. GoldenPhoenix had to call technicians for towing. Repair costs would easily reach six figures per vehicle. Was the culprit truly this reckless, targeting 'homewreckers' and the company itself?

This was clearly a premeditated attack.

Narrowing her eyes, Isabella called Adrian. "Is there another car in the company garage?"

"Huh? Why?" Adrian sounded confused.

"Bring me the keys if you have one," Isabella stated flatly. "I need it now."

Adrian arrived shortly after she hung up. His face flushed with rage at the sight of the destroyed cars, especially his beloved red Ferrari.

"Damn it! My precious Miss Red! What did they do to her?!"

Isabella watched him coldly. "Do you want payback?"

"Absolutely! I just acquired Miss Red recently! She's my baby! I'll make whoever did this pay!" he seethed.

Isabella extended her hand. "Lend me the car from the garage."

Adrian clutched the keys in his pocket protectively. "What for?"

"Didn't you just say you wanted revenge for Red? Should I walk to help you get it?" she deadpanned.

Adrian glanced at his damaged Ferrari uneasily. "But you'll be targeted again if you drive now. My Miss Red is already ruined... I don't want my Black to get hurt too..."

"Don't worry. I know what I'm doing," Isabella assured confidently.

Reluctantly, Adrian handed over the keys. "Please take good care of my Black. Even if it means forgetting about revenge for Red..."

"Hah! Men are so fickle!" Isabella snatched the keys. "Now go prepare something for me. Place it on the company's second floor."

Adrian listened to her instructions, frowning in confusion. Why would she need those items?

Isabella opened the garage door and slid into the matte black supercar. She slammed the accelerator, making the car skid dramatically out of the garage. Instead of driving far, she parked at the left side of the building where no guards were stationed.

Watching from above, Adrian's heart pounded violently. "Damn it! What is she doing? She promised to protect my Black!"

Julian glanced sideways with a frown. "She's your cousin. Don't you know her by now?"

"How should I know her? The cousin I knew before was nothing like this! Now I have to call her Boss! I'd call her anything if she'd just protect my Black!"

When Adrian looked down again, Isabella had vanished! She left Black parked in that isolated spot and disappeared! That location would definitely attract the vandal!

This couldn't happen! He had to save Black!

He rushed downstairs frantically, but at the entrance, he found Isabella walking in casually. "Relax and watch," she said with laid-back assurance. "Everything is going according to plan."
###Chapter 294

“What’s the plan? Tell me now! I’m going insane! They despise GoldenPhoenix so much—leaving Black out there is basically handing it over to be destroyed!” Adrian’s voice trembled with panic.

Isabella’s lips curved into a cold smile. “I hope they do show up. Honestly, I’d be more concerned if they didn’t.”

She strode calmly toward the window. Adrian stared, completely baffled.

Hope they show up? If they did, his beloved car would be wrecked!

Down below, a group of about ten, all masked and gloved, emerged from the shadows. They scanned the area cautiously before creeping toward the sleek black supercar. Some carried heavy blades, others wielded power drills. A few held baskets filled with rotten eggs and spoiled fruit.

“That’s the car Isabella drives,” one hissed. “Let’s trash it. Teach her a lesson.”

“She deserves it. Who defends a homewrecker anyway? Bet she’s one herself.”

“Don’t hold back. Ruin it. Make her regret everything.”

They moved closer, tools ready.

Then—

From the second floor, Isabella released a pre-prepared net. It unfurled swiftly, dropping over the entire group and trapping them.

Without pause, she lifted a large basket and dumped its contents downward.

Just as the trapped figures struggled to rise, they saw it—a rain of thick, grotesque caterpillars.

Each was as plump as a baby’s arm. Some glowed red, others shone purple or sickly green. Many were covered in sharp spikes.

The creatures landed on their heads, slipped under collars, crawled up legs. A living nightmare.

“Aaaahhh!”

Screams tore through the air. The women in the group wept and thrashed, but the net held them tight.

Upstairs, Isabella brushed off her hands, a merciless smirk on her face. She turned and headed for the stairs.

Adrian followed, a grin spreading across his face. “Well played, Boss Montgomery. Absolutely brilliant!”

GoldenPhoenix staff watched, satisfied, as the vandals suffered beneath them. Red, itchy welts rose wherever the caterpillars crawled. The net ensured no escape.

Isabella stepped out the main entrance, hands on her hips. “How does it feel? Having your skin marked up like that?” Her tone was icy, mocking.

The trapped mob turned on her, shouting:

“Isabella Montgomery! You’re pure evil! Let us out!”

“We did this for justice! For Genevieve! You protect a homewrecker, then attack us?”

“Release us now, or we’ll turn the entire internet against you! Everyone will hate you!”

One man fumbled for his phone, activating a live stream. He aimed the camera at Isabella, yelling, “Look! Everyone, look! Isabella is assaulting us! She trapped us with these disgusting bugs!”
###Chapter 295

Victoria Kensington watched the chaos unfold with a vicious smile. She had recently discovered Isabella Montgomery was the one who informed Alexander Whitmore about her location at The Ivy that day. While Isabella hadn't intended direct harm, her interference had ruined everything. If not for Isabella calling Nathaniel Blackwood back home, Victoria would have succeeded with Nathaniel instead of ending up with Harrison Caldwell!

This injustice demanded retribution. Victoria would make Isabella pay dearly. She had orchestrated this entire vandalism operation, paying the perpetrators handsomely. She even prepared multiple contingency plans. One key strategy involved live-streaming if Isabella attempted to fight back.

The chosen streamer was a famous influencer known for exposing corruption and advocating for the oppressed. His massive follower base would amplify the scandal instantly. Once he went live, Isabella's reputation would be obliterated.

The live-stream viewer count skyrocketed to over ten thousand within minutes. Platform promotions pushed the numbers even higher.

The influencer pointed his camera at the writhing mass of caterpillars and then at Isabella. "We came to vandalize GoldenPhoenix for justice! To teach Isabella Montgomery a lesson! Yet she shows no remorse! She's actively torturing us with these poisonous insects!"

"Look at our skin! Covered in painful red welts! These creatures are crawling everywhere! And she just watches, refusing to help!"

"Isabella Montgomery! Say something! You had the audacity to protect a home-wrecker! Now you've lost your voice?"

Isabella met the camera's lens directly, her posture defiant, hands on her hips. Her voice was glacial. "I have nothing to say to you. You destroyed property. Now you experience the consequences. You will understand what it feels like to be violated."

Her tone was wild. Untamable. utterly arrogant.

Even exposed to thousands online, Isabella displayed zero fear. Not a hint of retreat. Her confidence was unshakable.

The streamer's face flushed with fury. "I'm suing you for intentional harm! You will cover all our medical bills!"

"Oh? Is that so?" A dangerous smirk played on Isabella's lips. "I fully intend to pay. Let's get a medical team here immediately to assess the damages. I will cover every cent. However..."

Her smirk widened. "...you will reimburse me for the vehicles you destroyed. The total cost is three hundred thousand dollars. Prepare the payment."

Three hundred thousand dollars?

The vandals stared, stunned into silence, momentarily forgetting the caterpillars.

The live-streamer recovered first. "Three hundred thousand? Let it be! Righteous citizens will help us raise the funds! We gladly vandalized the cars of a company that protects home-wreckers! A cheap company that signs such immoral artists!"

[Right! Agreed!]

[So satisfying to watch!]

[Send the address! I'm coming to help!]

[Give me your account number! I'll donate ten thousand!]

Rage-filled comments flooded the live stream. Emboldened by the support, the streamer glared at Isabella. "See? You protected a home-wrecker! You deserve this! You're public enemy number one now! Not the idolized Boss Montgomery anymore!"

His companions joined the verbal assault. "The accomplice is worse than the perpetrator! You showed no concern about your artist's disgusting behavior! You even shielded her! Disgusting!"

"You attacked us, the champions of justice, with these insects! Now taste your own medicine!"

One man scooped a handful of caterpillars and hurled them directly at Isabella.

She didn't flinch. She didn't move.

Ten black-suited bodyguards materialized instantly, forming an impenetrable wall in front of her. The caterpillars smacked harmlessly against their tailored suits. In a synchronized motion, the guards brushed the insects off. The caterpillars fell to the ground, motionless.

The display was swift. Professional. Overwhelming.

Everyone stared, shocked. They never anticipated Isabella having such elite, ever-present protection.

Each bodyguard was formidable. Soldier-like. Exceptionally handsome.
###Chapter 296

The mob quickly shook off their stunned silence.

The man holding the live-stream camera glared viciously at the guards.

“Why are you all acting like loyal dogs? Why defend a traitor? Move! Get out of our way!”

“Isabella protected that homewrecker, and you’re still shielding her? Has GoldenPhoenix lost all its dignity?”

“A rotten leader breeds rotten followers! Isabella, you bully ordinary people and use your wealth to crush us even more! This is pure oppression!”

“Let’s charge them! Attack!”

A rallying cry went up. The crowd surged forward like a frenzied beast. The live-streamer joined the rush.

A woman tangled in the net snatched a rock from the ground, aiming it straight at Isabella.

Though trapped, the mob's collective force dragged the heavy net and the writhing caterpillars along with them.

The scene descended into utter chaos.

Isabella’s brow furrowed. If her guards retaliated, it would escalate everything. The backlash would be brutal, especially with women present…

The guards braced, electric batons humming to life. They stood ready, a wall against the oncoming frenzy.

The gap closed. The women took aim. The guards prepared to strike.

“Halt!” Isabella commanded.

She was no saint, but she wasn’t foolish. Escalating this solved nothing. This could be resolved without violence!

Just as her mind raced for a solution…

“Stop! Please, you have it all wrong!”

A clear, strong voice cut through the noise. Everyone turned. A heavily pregnant woman hurried toward them, waddling with effort.

“I’m Isabella’s personal assistant,” she announced, breathless. “You’re mistaken. Isabella saved Arabella not to protect a homewrecker… but because Arabella is not a homewrecker.”

Shock rippled through the crowd. Not a homewrecker? How could that be?

The mob hesitated, wary of harming a pregnant woman, but their anger didn't subside.

“How is she not? The evidence is everywhere! Why lie?”

“You’re about to be a mother. Have some decency for your child!”

“Even Harrison said she was! Arabella herself is hiding. What’s left to lie about? If she’s not, then who is?”

“Is GoldenPhoenix using a pregnant woman to spin lies? How despicable! I hope you go bankrupt!”

The pregnant woman stood her ground. “It’s true Arabella was with Harrison. But she was deceived! Before you judge, listen to this!”

She raised a portable speaker and pressed play.

A recording blasted into the air.

(Harrison, let's get married. It’s been six years. I’ll put my career on hold for you.)
[No. You’re at your peak. Marriage now is impossible.]
(Harrison, this is my thirty-ninth proposal. Your thirty-ninth rejection. Be honest. Do you love someone else? Are you already married?)
[How could you think that? I’m not that kind of man! Listen, Arabella, this is for your own good…]

The voices were unmistakable. Arabella’s gentle tone, Harrison’s dismissive replies. The conversation was crystal clear.

But the content… it was completely different from the story everyone knew.
###Chapter 297

Some of the attackers fell silent at the new evidence.
Others remained skeptical and voiced their doubts.

“Where did this recording come from? Did you pay someone to fabricate it?”
“If this is true, why didn’t Arabella come forward herself?”
“This has to be edited. Don’t think you can trick us with fake proof!”

Their protests grew louder and more aggressive.

The pregnant woman stepped forward confidently.
“Arabella stayed silent because she had no proof. This audio was obtained by Isabella Montgomery.”
“She contacted Vertex Communications and requested an overnight search of their archives.”
“It’s completely authentic.”

She continued, her voice clear and strong.
“Dozens of technicians worked through years of call records.”
“They located this conversation just an hour ago.”
“Vertex Communications will verify this recording’s legitimacy.”
“If it’s fabricated, they will accept full legal responsibility.”

Though visibly pregnant, she carried undeniable authority.
Isabella recognized her immediately.
Eleanor Kensington, former Vice President of Vertex Communications.
She had resigned recently due to her pregnancy.

Isabella had indeed requested the records search.
But she had never spoken to Eleanor directly.
How did she know so many details?

Meanwhile, the live stream comments exploded.
[That’s definitely Eleanor Kensington. She’s reputable and doesn’t lie!]
[Hello, I’m the current President of Vertex. I confirm this recording is genuine.]
[I’m Gregory Whitmore, lead investigator on this project. I also verify its authenticity.]

Gregory Whitmore was Vertex’s head of security.
A decorated former soldier and respected professional.
All usernames were officially verified.

These were real people staking their reputations.
The evidence was undeniable.

Viewers were just as stunned as the trapped attackers.
So Arabella was deceived by Harrison?
She never knew he was married?
The mob’s anger began to shift.

“How could this happen? Harrison lied to everyone?”
“So Arabella wasn’t the other woman? She was victimized?”
“Isabella, you protected her because you knew the truth?”
“All this time, Arabella suffered unjust accusations…”

Isabella responded calmly to their questions.
“You thought her suicide attempt was an act? After I pulled her back, she slit her wrists.”
“She’s still recovering, weak and traumatized.”
“Think about it. If she were truly shameless, why would she try to kill herself?”
“Harrison lied to her from the beginning.”
“He manipulated her emotionally and financially for years.”
“He took everything from her—her trust, her money, her dignity.”

Isabella’s voice grew sharper.
“What happened to Genevieve is tragic, yes.”
“But Arabella is just as much a victim!”
“The only person to blame here is Harrison Winslow.”
###Chapter 298

“You’ve all attacked Arabella from the beginning, yet none of you held Harrison accountable for his actions. When an affair happens between a woman and a married man, why does the woman bear all the blame while the man gets to return to his family and receive forgiveness without consequences?”

Isabella’s sharp, articulate words struck the audience like a physical blow.

Viewers on the live stream flooded the comments with praise for her.

[Isabella is absolutely right, Harrison is the real villain! That scumbag deserves to rot!

[Arabella is so unlucky! Not only did he deceive her for seven years, but he also exploited her. Now she’s being mocked and labeled a homewrecker!

[Harrison Winslow is trash! Let’s storm his social media! Bombard him!]

The online outrage escalated rapidly.

Meanwhile, Arabella’s assistant helped her out of the building. Arabella’s wrist was heavily bandaged, her face pale and drained. As she looked at the crowd outside, tears streamed down her cheeks uncontrollably.

Arabella never imagined the truth would come out. She had resigned herself to dying with her innocence buried, believing no one would ever believe her. She was prepared to die unjustly, yet Isabella managed to clear her name…

In all those years, Arabella had only discussed marriage with Harrison once over the phone. She couldn’t fathom how Isabella had uncovered that recording!

She bowed deeply at a ninety-degree angle toward Isabella, her voice choked with emotion. “Thank you… Thank you, Ms. Montgomery. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t be standing here alive today. I’m so grateful! And…”

Arabella straightened up and turned toward the live stream camera. “I stayed silent from the beginning not because I had nothing to say, but because I was at a loss. I never dreamed the man I loved so deeply was married.

“Before this scandal broke, I was still planning to propose to him. I had an engagement ring custom-made and even bought us a house for our future…”

Her eyes reddened as she spoke. After a pause to collect herself, she continued, “I’m not seeking sympathy… I just want to warn other women not to make my mistake. Remember: if a man refuses to make your relationship public, he’s hiding something.

“Lastly, I want to sincerely apologize to Genevieve. Even though I was deceived too, I still caused harm to your family. The thought of you and your child fills me with guilt. I don’t have the courage to face you directly, so I’m saying this here: whatever you need, please reach out to me. I’ll do everything in my power to make amends.”

With that, Arabella bowed deeply to the camera again, her sincerity palpable.

She was a victim herself—vulnerable, with swollen, tear-filled eyes—yet she set aside her own pain to offer a genuine apology.

Her assistant, Penelope, watched with a heart full of anguish. “I’ve been Arabella’s manager and assistant for six years!” Penelope declared to the camera. “I swear on my life, Arabella had no idea about any of this! She didn’t know Harrison was married. In fact, no one in the industry knew he had a family.

“Harrison took massive amounts of money from her! He constantly claimed his businesses were struggling and swindled nearly a hundred million dollars from her!

“These companies are untraceable. He said they were startups operating under the radar. Looking back now, it’s all so suspicious!

“I’m calling on the power of the internet to help uncover what these companies are and what they were really used for!”

The viewers erupted in fury. Nearly a hundred million dollars? Not only did Harrison lie and cheat, but he also stole her money! That amount was staggering! Could that bastard Harrison really have taken it all?
###Chapter 299

Arabella's eyes were red and swollen, yet she managed to pull herself together. She straightened her posture. "Penelope, that's enough. Let's go."

She was more than satisfied with how things had unfolded. There was no reason to stay any longer. Reporters were swarming toward them, closing in fast. Penelope had no choice but to help Arabella make a quick exit.

They avoided all interviews. But articles about the incident exploded online almost instantly.

(Harrison Winslow Lied to the Entire World!)

(Arabella Was Cheated Out of Her Money and Body!)

(Harrison's Offshore Company Is a Sole Proprietorship, Involving Marital Fund Transfers!)

(Arabella Slashed Her Wrist and Refused Treatment to Avoid Accusations!)

The news spread like wildfire, shooting straight to the top of the headlines. The comment sections were flooded.

(Did Harrison Winslow deceive us all? Was Arabella actually wronged?)

(That gentle, cheerful food lover endured so much pain these past few days. And she didn't deserve any of it!)

(Her heart must be shattered. The man she loved deeply turned out to be married. He cheated on her for so long! She was even terrified of attempting suicide, afraid people would accuse her of faking it.)

(Harrison is a complete monster! Sources say his offshore companies were set up behind Genevieve's back. He must have been planning to divorce her. That's why he started moving the money!)

(That's fraud! It's illegal! He can be sued!)

(He stole a hundred million from Arabella! He belongs in jail!)

(Rumor has it Boss Isabella already filed a report. An investigation is underway!)

The public opinion shifted dramatically. The tables had turned completely.

Meanwhile, inside the hospital room...

Genevieve's eyes were red and swollen. She held her daughter tightly in her arms.

Harrison rushed to the bedside, frantic. "Genevieve, darling, please believe me. It's all fabricated! Everything is fake! They doctored that recording."

Slap!

Genevieve struck him hard across the face before he could finish. "Why?" she snarled. "Why did you do this? Why do you keep lying to me?!"

"Genevieve, I—" Harrison clutched his stinging cheek, trying to speak.

She grabbed a pillow and hurled it at him with force. "What about your offshore companies? How do you explain the suspicious activity in our joint account? You were planning to leave me, weren't you? You lied to steal my money, right?"

"Waa... Bad Daddy! Bad Daddy!" Their daughter ran toward Harrison, hitting him with her small fists.

Instinctively, Harrison shoved her away. She fell to the floor.

Genevieve's eyes burned with fury. She ripped the IV from her arm and scrambled off the bed to scoop up her child. She glared at Harrison, her gaze sharp as daggers. "Harrison Winslow, are you even human? I had my youth and my career back then. I believed your sweet words and gave up everything to marry you!"

"Whenever you needed money or anything else, I went to my parents and got it for you. I gave you my all to support you. And this is how you repay me? This is how you treat our daughter?!"

"Enough! Shut up! Don't you dare mention your parents again! I'm sick of it." Harrison's eyes turned venomous. "Do you really think you're blameless for the state of our marriage? Yes, you were perfect back then. But I was already a vice president when I married you. Just because my family isn't as wealthy as yours doesn't mean I deserve your constant condescension!"
###Chapter 300

“Every family gathering, every holiday...we always had to be there with your relatives. And when money got tight, you’d just go ask them for more. Your parents—every time they see me, it’s ‘Take care of her,’ ‘Don’t disappoint our daughter.’ But the way they look at me…like I’m some kind of failure. I have my pride, Genevieve. I’m the man in this relationship!”

Harrison slammed a fist against his own chest, his voice shaking with bottled-up rage.

Genevieve stared, completely stunned. All these years, she thought his willingness to join her family events was a sign of his devotion. She had felt so grateful, so lucky. She would have done anything for him. She never imagined this resentment was boiling underneath.

Their daughter, frightened by her father’s outburst, buried her face in Genevieve’s shoulder, trembling.

Just then, Harrison’s phone buzzed loudly. He answered, and his assistant’s panicked voice came through clearly. “Sir, Arabella is suing you. She’s demanding a hundred million for fraud. The police are on their way to the hospital right now.”

His expression darkened instantly. Without another glance at his wife, he turned and stormed out of the room.

Genevieve stood frozen, watching him leave. Silent tears began to trace paths down her pale cheeks.

Meanwhile, at GoldenPhoenix…

After dispersing the angry crowd and arranging for the damaged cars to be fixed, Isabella returned to her office. She studied the pregnant woman before her with a curious gaze. “To what do I owe this visit, Ms. Kensington?”

“Mr. Blackwood sent me. He thought it was a smart move. Anyone else handling that mob might have gotten hurt. But me?” She gently rested a hand on her rounded belly. “Nobody’s going to hit a pregnant woman. I could say anything out there, and they’d just have to take it.”

Isabella had to admit, Nathaniel’s logic was sound. Those people, though paid to cause trouble, still had a strong sense of right and wrong. They despised home-wreckers. Attacking a pregnant woman was a line they wouldn’t cross.

Mr. Blackwood? So it was Nathaniel’s doing after all…

Wendy continued, a warm smile on her face. “He had me come out, and he’d already deployed hundreds of his staff to sift through those phone records long before you even started looking. He treats you exceptionally well, my dear. He respects you deeply. You should cherish a man like that.” She gave Isabella’s shoulder a gentle, knowing pat and a wink before taking her leave.

A faint blush rose to Isabella’s cheeks. A peculiar, warm feeling blossomed in her chest. Harrison and Arabella had met frequently at the office, but their phone calls continued for hours even after work. Over the years, there were over a thousand calls. Some long, some short, most conversations seemingly trivial. Finding the crucial evidence meant listening to each one, often multiple times. That’s why her team, working through the night, had hit a wall.

Without Nathaniel’s intervention, she might not have found the evidence until the next day. She had explicitly told him not to interfere in her affairs. Yet, he had helped her silently, from the shadows.

The thought of all his quiet support made her expression grow solemn. If not for the incident five years ago… she would have given him a whole brood of children without a second thought.

But first, she had to settle the storm raging inside her.

She could only repay him with her gratitude for now. She turned to Adrian and Julian. “Handle things here. Keep an eye on Arabella. I might be tied up for the next couple of days.”

“Don’t worry about a thing,” Adrian said, thumping his chest confidently. “You handled the big crisis. I can manage the clean-up. It’s under control!”

With a nod, Isabella left.

Julian watched her go, his thoughts drifting to the retired, pregnant Wendy Morrison. His gaze darkened. It seemed Nathaniel Blackwood had stepped in to help again. Was Isabella finally opening her heart to love once more?
###Chapter 301

Isabella stepped out of the building only to remember her car had been impounded for repairs.

It would take days before she could get it back.

She pulled out her phone to call a ride when a sleek black sedan pulled up beside her.

The window rolled down to reveal Oliver’s excited face beaming from the backseat.

“Mommy! Get in, get in!”

Both Nathaniel and Oliver were inside.

Isabella’s lips pressed into a thin line. They came to pick her up? How did they know about her car?

She scanned the area cautiously before slipping into the vehicle.

Oliver had already claimed the window seat. That left the middle spot open—right next to Nathaniel.

“Sorry, Mommy,” Oliver said with an innocent shrug. “I get carsick. I need the fresh air.”

Isabella almost laughed. Since when did Oliver get carsick? And in a car this luxurious with perfect air circulation?

Nathaniel’s calm voice broke through her thoughts. “Did everything get resolved?”

“Thanks to you, it did,” she replied, offering rare praise.

Oliver clapped enthusiastically. “Daddy’s amazing! So amazing! Mommy, what are you giving Daddy as a thank you?”

Isabella hesitated. She had planned to find a gift later, but now they were here.

“How about a five percent stake in the Gray Diamond Empire?” she offered. “As a token of gratitude.”

“I don’t care for material things,” Nathaniel said smoothly. “And you don’t owe me anything.”

Nothing? He’d mobilized hundreds of employees, even pulling a retired executive out of maternity leave. That was far from nothing.

“Nathaniel,” she said firmly, “I don’t like owing people. If you helped me, I will repay you. Name your price. Anything.”

“Anything?” he repeated, his voice low and intentional.

She nodded. The fewer favors between them, the better.

“Then marry me.”

Isabella choked. “Nathaniel Blackwood! That’s unreasonable!”

“You said anything,” he countered, his tone deceptively mild.

“Mommy, you always say we shouldn’t lie,” Oliver chimed in. “You have to keep your word!”

She coughed awkwardly. “I—I meant anything within reason! Not something this serious!”

Nathaniel thought for a moment. “Then a kiss. Three seconds. That should be reasonable, shouldn’t it?”

A kiss? Three seconds?

Before she could protest, Oliver cheered. “That’s so easy! Daddy and Mommy kiss all the time! You can’t say no this time, Mommy!”

Isabella froze. If she refused now, what would Oliver think?

Fine. It was just three seconds. It wasn’t like they hadn’t kissed before.

She leaned forward, looping her arms around Nathaniel’s neck.

Her lips met his.
###Chapter 302

Isabella moved with lightning speed.

Her lips met his in a sudden, electrifying contact.

Nathaniel jolted at the unexpected softness.

His eyes narrowed instinctively.

Just as he began to savor the moment, she pulled away.

She straightened in her seat, composing herself.

“Time’s up,” she stated calmly.

Had three seconds truly passed so quickly?

Nathaniel didn’t dwell on the brevity.

He slowly licked his lips, a faint smile forming.

This marked the first time Isabella initiated a kiss.

It satisfied him for now; more opportunities would arise.

Isabella noticed his smirk, that familiar seductive expression.

Her heart raced uncontrollably.

She felt a flush of embarrassment at her boldness.

Reflecting on it, the kiss felt excessively forward.

What exactly defined their relationship now?

Sensing the awkward shift in atmosphere, she reached for her phone.

She intended to browse SilverPeak news.

Instead, her name dominated the trending section.

A post titled [Isabella: The Divine Leader!] ranked third nationwide.

She tapped to view the full content.

[Isabella rescued SilverPeak with her brilliance. She uncovered the truth and presented evidence in their defense. Who wouldn’t want a leader like Isabella?]

The comments section erupted with mixed reactions.

[CEO Montgomery is incredible! I need a leader like her!]

[How do I get assigned under her leadership? Sign me up!]

[Am I the only one concerned here? Isabella accessed someone’s call history through Vertex Communications! She holds no investigative authority or Vertex affiliation. What right did she have?]

[So wealth grants unlimited power now?]

[This implies she can freely access anyone’s private calls!]

[Vertex’s security team is incompetent! They trade customer privacy for money?]

[Admittedly, Isabella is powerful and capable, but she owes us an explanation!]

[Vertex must also provide answers!]

The discourse shifted from praise to intense criticism.

Privacy concerns dominated the conversation.

Numerous netizens flooded Isabella’s feed, demanding justification.

Isabella frowned. The situation had initially progressed smoothly.

How did it devolve into chaos? Discussions should have remained focused on SilverPeak’s vindication.

Instead, attention diverted to her actions, accompanied by harsh accusations.

Clearly, someone manipulated the narrative. But who?

Meanwhile, at the Delacroix estate…

Vivienne reclined in her private salon.

Her chief beautician administered a full-body treatment.

Cassandra entered the room. “Vivienne, the narrative is set. TitanTech users will receive notifications shortly. Soon, everyone will know how Isabella abused her wealth for misconduct!”

A mocking smirk spread across Vivienne’s lips.

Her expression radiated arrogance and vengeance.

What made Isabella believe she could compete? Isabella would pay for terrifying her with those pythons!

Public disdain for wealthy individuals misusing power ran deep. Involving user privacy could escalate into criminal charges!

With minimal effort, Vivienne could land Isabella in jail!

Hah! Isabella should have recognized her inferiority!

That same day, TitanTech users received another system notification.

Headlines previously covering Arabella and Harrison now shifted.

By evening, they screamed: [Isabella Does Whatever She Wants!]

Although Isabella retained supporters, furious keyboard warriors controlled the narrative.

The situation descended into utter chaos.
###Chapter 303

Isabella slipped off her heels as she stepped into the Blackwood Estate.

Nathaniel’s gaze shifted toward her. “If you need anything, just say the word,” he murmured, his voice low and compelling.

His tone was tender, layered with unmistakable concern. Before Isabella could respond, her phone buzzed.

Gregory Whitmore, the screen read.

She answered. “Vice President Montgomery,” Gregory’s voice came through, “given the mounting backlash, we’ll need to disclose your identity publicly. Are you in agreement?”

Isabella gave a faint smile. “Do I have a choice?”

“I’ll proceed then, Vice President Montgomery. I’ll handle the announcement immediately.” Gregory ended the call.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. Vice President Montgomery? So she was the vice president of Vertex Communications? He had suspected her connection to the company, but never imagined she held such a high position.

What other secrets was this woman keeping?

Noticing the curious looks from Nathaniel and Oliver, Isabella explained casually, “Before Eleanor Kensington retired, Vertex was searching for her successor. I happened to assist them in securing the patent for fifth-gen wireless tech. That allowed Vertex to launch the industry’s first cellular tech package ahead of everyone else.”

She spoke with detached indifference, as though it were a trivial matter.

Oliver’s eyes sparkled as he gazed at her with admiration. “Mommy is amazing! Just as amazing as Daddy! Last year, Daddy’s R&D team created the first fully integrated fifth-gen wireless smart home system!”

“Quantum Systems?” Isabella asked.

Oliver nodded eagerly. “Yes! How did you know? It’s incredible! The system can detect incoming storms and close windows automatically! It prepares breakfast, adjusts curtains, and even cleans dust! Most importantly, it can put out fires on its own!” He beamed with pride.

Isabella glanced at Nathaniel. It was the first time she had learned about his work since moving in, and it intrigued her—smart home tech was something she had a genuine interest in.

“I’ve tried similar systems before,” Isabella began, “but many functions still required manual control via phone, which I found inconvenient. Once, I was watching TV and couldn’t find the remote or the power button. I had to use the app, but my phone was missing. It was frustrating. Another major flaw is network vulnerability. If hackers breach the system, they could unlock doors and windows. Has Quantum resolved these issues?”

“What do you think, Ms. Montgomery?” Nathaniel’s tone carried a hint of mature confidence.

Isabella frowned. That tone… Had he already solved these problems? Was domestic smart home technology this advanced?

Seeing they finally had common ground, Oliver grinned and quietly slipped out of the room.

Nathaniel moved to the sofa and poured Isabella a glass of water, gesturing for her to sit. Once she was settled, he continued, “Quantum already addressed those concerns. Last year, we upgraded to a sixth-gen AI system. It no longer relies on remotes or phone apps.”

“It operates through built-in artificial intelligence, automating lights and appliances. It also responds to voice commands in nearly a thousand languages, including various dialects. As for security…” He paused. “Even if Quantum is compromised, no other system in the world would remain intact.”
###Chapter 304

Nathaniel’s voice was sharp and deliberate.
He spoke with a relaxed, commanding presence.
Only a man of his stature could carry such confidence.

Isabella studied him, a flicker of admiration stirring within her.
Over the years, she had conquered countless fields.
No one had ever truly impressed her.

But this man…

Her eyes swept the room.
“If it’s as impressive as you say,” she began, “why isn’t it installed here?”

Nathaniel’s expression tightened almost imperceptibly.
He seemed to be guarding a secret.
After a brief pause, he lifted his glass and signaled the butler.

The butler approached with a matte black device.
He set it gently on the coffee table.
“Hello, Kitty,” the butler said.

The machine responded instantly.
“How can I assist you, Uncle?”

Its voice was soft and charming, almost childlike.

The butler turned to Isabella.
“Ms. Montgomery, would you like to try?”

Isabella’s gaze fell upon the machine.
“Hello, Kitty.”

The device replied without hesitation.
“What can I do for you, Mommy?”

Isabella’s brow furrowed as understanding washed over her.

Nathaniel gave a slight nod.
The butler promptly removed Kitty from the room.
They were alone again.

Nathaniel turned to her.
“Quantum’s Smart Home System is named Kitty. It’s designed to feel like a family pet. To make the experience more personal, it recognizes voices. It calls the eldest male ‘Grandpa,’ the female head ‘Mommy,’ and so on.”

He paused, his voice growing heavier.
“Last year, I took Oliver to the demo house. He saw other children with their parents. Their systems called out ‘Mommy.’ His never did. He had a seizure that night. We never used it again.”

Isabella’s heart clenched painfully.
She could picture it clearly—a room full of happy families, and a little boy standing alone.
His device silent where others spoke.
The ache must have been unbearable.

Her eyes narrowed slightly.
“Why not contact the surrogate? She gave birth to him. The Blackwoods have resources. She might have returned for him.”

Besides, his real mother would understand him better.

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened.
If only it were that simple.
He thought of that night five years ago.
Would Isabella still look at him if she knew?
She despised men who took advantage.

After a tense silence, he replied, “It was handled discreetly. No records exist. And the Blackwoods would never accept a surrogate. You know how my father is.”

Isabella pressed her lips together.
He was right.
Senior Blackwood was ruthless.
He would never allow a woman of “lower status” near his grandson.
It would destroy Oliver to lose a mother twice.

But something felt off.
Nathaniel always grew tense when this subject arose.

Suddenly, Dominic burst into the room.
His face was pale.

“Boss,” he gasped. “The Blackthorn Syndicate—they’ve escaped.”

Escaped?

Nathaniel’s face turned to ice.
His elite team never failed.
How could anyone outsmart them?
###Chapter 305

Isabella’s brows drew together as she studied Nathaniel with a skeptical look. “You went after the Blackthorn Syndicate?”

Nathaniel gave a firm nod. “I couldn’t stand by while you were dealing with this.”

All she wanted was to uncover the man’s identity, and Nathaniel decided to dismantle the entire syndicate?

Even worse, the Blackthorn Syndicate had managed to evade his team.

“We spent days preparing,” Dominic explained, “but somehow, they got wind of it. By the time we reached their headquarters, they were gone. They cleared out every piece of evidence and document.”

Isabella’s frown deepened. So the syndicate had discovered their plan?

On second thought, the Blackwoods were high-profile, and Nathaniel had publicly defended her. Whether it was Vivienne, Alexander, or even Victoria, any of them could have uncovered their connection. With the syndicate’s escape, the situation had grown far more complicated.

“Don’t worry,” Nathaniel assured her, his voice steady. “I’ll handle this for you.”

He turned to Dominic, his tone commanding. “I don’t care what it takes. Track down every last one of them.”

“Understood, Sir.” Dominic moved to leave.

“Wait!” Isabella called out quickly. “Keep it quiet this time. Operate in the shadows. Just find Vincent Moreau.”

“Yes, Madam.” With a nod, Dominic exited.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened at the name. Vincent Moreau? Was that the man who had hurt Isabella?

A fresh wave of anger tightened his features.

That same day, Blackwood Corporation issued a stark warning to all partners and suppliers: anyone connected to Vincent Moreau would be terminated immediately and face triple penalties.

Nathaniel was never one to hesitate, whether the offense was personal or not.

It was then that Dominic remembered a piece of intel he had nearly forgotten. He sent a quick text.

Mr. Blackwood, our investigation confirms that the campaign to shut down GoldenPhoenix was initiated by Seraphina Delacroix.

Nathaniel’s reply was immediate. Two days. Make SilverPeak vanish.

Isabella remained unaware of the exchange, focused on her own battles.

Later that day, the president of Vertex Communications released an official statement: As Vice President of Vertex Communications, Isabella Montgomery acted in full compliance with company protocol and legal standards. In cases involving fraud, Vertex retains the right to cooperate with judicial and law enforcement authorities, including providing access to call records.

In other words, Isabella had followed every rule.

Wait… Isabella was Vice President of Vertex Communications?!

The internet exploded.

Oh my god! What’s happening now?! The Diamond Boss is also a VP at Vertex?!

This feels more like a movie than real life!

What else don’t we know about Boss Montgomery?

She runs the Diamond Company, the Ohly diamond store, her modeling career, and she’s a VP at Vertex? She’s a true polymath!

Am I the only one who sees the real issue here? The so-called genius Vivienne was the one who abused her power to send system-wide texts to all TitanTech users!
###Chapter 306

That final question redirected everyone's focus.

(Exactly! Buying TitanTech phones doesn't grant them permission to spam system notifications! Those messages couldn't be dismissed or ignored either. They were literally forcing us to read them!)

[Didn't Vivienne call Isabella and Arabella shameless, claiming to defend her best friend Genevieve? Abusing power is still unacceptable, right?)

[Honestly, I doubt Vivienne was just defending a friend. It feels more like a targeted attack on Isabella and GoldenPhoenix.]

[Absolutely! The moment everyone praised Boss Montgomery, the forums got flooded with hate comments against her. If that wasn't orchestrated, I'll stream myself eating shit.]

[They're both top-tier entrepreneurs. Maybe Vivienne can't handle another woman matching her status?]

You know what they say—two tigers can't share one mountain. I'm convinced Vivienne and Isabella have serious history!]

[Hah! Vivienne probably thought Isabella was some clueless trust fund baby. Never expected a real boss, did she?]

Netizens typed furiously, thoroughly entertained by the clash. Hundreds of thousands of comments piled up within a single day.

A sly smirk touched Isabella's lips. They could hire trolls, but so could she!

Did Vivienne want a war? She should've anticipated this!

The drama escalated further. When the stock market opened the next morning, TitanTech's shares nosedived, losing billions in value.

Influencers erupted over Vivienne's actions, hosting live streams condemning TitanTech. Public opinion turned sharply against her.

Her pristine, flawless 'princess' image shattered completely.

Another company hit hard was SilverPeak.

Harrison—as SilverPeak's CEO—committed an unforgivable act, yet Seraphina still attacked GoldenPhoenix.

Once the truth surfaced, the company faced relentless backlash.

Artists who previously tried to terminate contracts with SilverPeak were outraged. They genuinely admired Isabella and wanted to join GoldenPhoenix instead.

They gathered outside the Entertainment Guild, demanding the chairman's arbitration.

Seraphina had contacted the Guild chairman beforehand, relying on their good relationship.

But the chairman not only ignored her pleas, the Guild actually assisted the artists in successfully terminating their contracts.

SilverPeak became a deserted shell of its former self, stripped of all glory, and was eventually forced to shut down.

Seraphina completely lost her composure. She trashed the company office in a fit of rage.

This drew threats from various parties, forcing her to flee the country.

Isabella learned all this during breakfast with Oliver and Nathaniel.

She was eating while reading a text from Julian:

(SilverPeak is closed. All their artists have signed with Golden Phoenix.)

Isabella frowned. SilverPeak collapsed this fast? In just one day?

Suspicious, she turned her gaze toward Nathaniel. “Mr. Blackwood, was this your doing again?”

“A minor intervention,” Nathaniel replied casually, placing a piece of salmon on her plate.

Her heart skipped a beat. This man always knew how to get to her.

His constant help was starting to make her feel... inadequate.

Her eyes flickered. “Is Vivienne coming today?”

“Yes! I heard she even got some special snake-repellent medicine. She’s trying to get close to Daddy!” Oliver pouted, his frustration clear.

Why did that Auntie want to ruin his Daddy and Mommy? Bad Auntie!

Isabella simply ruffled his hair. “Don’t worry. I have a way to make her back off from your Daddy.”

“Really?” Oliver chirped, his eyes sparkling like stars.

A perfect smirk curled her lips. “Really. Leave her to me when she arrives.”
###Chapter 307

Isabella spoke with unwavering confidence. She outlined her strategy clearly. “Oliver must wait in the study. You cannot look at what we’re doing, understood? The plan fails if you see. Mommy doesn’t want you witnessing something inappropriate. Okay?”

“Yes! Oliver promises to complete the mission!” Christopher saluted sharply.

If it meant getting rid of that horrible Auntie, he would do anything. Even staying locked in the study for hours.

After the meal, Christopher went to his study under the butler’s watchful eye.

Isabella turned to Nathaniel. “This plan requires me to make a personal sacrifice today. Remember, it’s all an act. Nothing is real.”

A sacrifice? An act?
Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. What exactly was this plan?

Isabella elaborated. “Vivienne is attracted to your pristine reputation. Among global elites, you’re known for your restraint. Unlike other men with countless affairs. A genius like Vivienne is inherently proud. She would never accept a man who flirts openly with other women. So, I’ve arranged for several ladies to join us later. You just need to pretend to be a playboy. It will shatter her idealized image of you.”

Pretend to be a playboy?
Nathaniel frowned deeply. “I don’t think I can do that.”

Inappropriate women made him intensely uncomfortable. He avoided them instinctively. Flirting was utterly impossible.

“Relax. Since you’ve helped me so much, I’ll take the lead. The others will simply provide a shoulder or foot massage,” Isabella added.

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. Isabella would take the lead? So the person he was supposed to flirt with was… her?
“Okay.”

His reply was immediate. Direct. Without hesitation.

This man… Why was he being so strange?

She pulled out her phone and made a call. She reminded him, “Don’t expect miracles. This is just phase one. It won’t completely destroy her opinion of you. We’ll plan the next step based on her reaction today.”

“Okay.” Nathaniel voiced no objection.

Isabella sensed a hint of anticipation from him. But his expression remained flawlessly calm and elegant. Unreadable.

Whatever! She was doing this for him! Vivienne’s pedigree was suitable, but her attitude was vile. Isabella refused to let a woman like that become Oliver’s mother. She would help Nathaniel escape her clutches.

Right on schedule, Vivienne arrived at the Blackwood Estate in her luxury car. She gazed up at the imposing mansion, her eyes filled with venomous grandeur. How dare Isabella attack her online? Vivienne had become a public laughingstock. Omega’s stock had plummeted. She would make that woman pay. Once she secured Nathaniel and Oliver’s affections, they would be engaged by the end of the month at Senior Blackwood’s birthday gala. She would become Nathaniel’s wife. The First Lady of Westchester’s wealthiest man!

Then, crushing a nobody like Isabella would be effortless. Did Isabella really think she could steal her man? Dream on!

She composed herself, adjusted a scented sachet, and strode into the mansion. She expected Oliver to lead her to the pythons again. But… the mansion was eerily quiet. Deserted.

Several maids scurried toward the backyard, seemingly fleeing something. Vivienne swiftly grabbed one by the arm. “Where is Nathaniel? Where is Oliver?”

“Oh! Oliver is in a tutoring session. And Mr. Blackwood… He… He…” The maid stammered, her face flushing with clear embarrassment. Just then, the distinct sound of feminine laughter echoed from upstairs.
###Chapter 308

She bolted up the staircase as the maid attempted to block her path. “Ms. Delacroix, Mr. Blackwood gave strict orders not to be disturbed—”

“Don’t touch me!” Vivienne shoved the maid’s hand away and charged upward.

The sounds of laughter grew distinct and louder. The door stood slightly open when she reached it, and inside…

Nathaniel lounged indolently on the charcoal sofa, encircled by a cluster of women attending to his every need. Some kneaded his shoulders, others attended to his feet, while one offered him tea.

Isabella, clad in a form-fitting black lace dress, perched on his lap. She held a bunch of grapes, feeding them to Nathaniel one by one.

He accepted each grape, his hands resting possessively on her waist. Their bodies were pressed so close they seemed fused together. The scene was intensely provocative.

Vivienne stumbled backward, a scorching wave of fury and envy crashing through her.

How… How was this possible?

She had always believed Nathaniel to be virtuous and disciplined, maintaining a respectful distance from women—flawless as a storybook prince. Yet now…

He was surrounded by so many women!

Meanwhile, Isabella leaned into Nathaniel’s embrace, her voice a silken murmur. “Nathaniel, do you enjoy the grapes?”

Her form was supple, her warmth and breath ghosting over his face. Nathaniel, unaccustomed to such feminine attention, naturally exuded a cool, detached aura. But at her words, he couldn’t help responding to Isabella.

His world narrowed to her alone; everything else faded into obscurity. Gazing into her eyes, he replied, “I prefer you.”

His voice was husky and magnetic. Whether intentional or not, his tongue grazed her fingertip as he took the grape.

A jolt of electricity shot through Isabella’s fingers, making her heart stutter.

This man! He had been hesitant earlier, but now he was dominating the scene. Instinct urged her to push him away, but she remembered Vivienne was watching. She had to stay in character. “Then will you marry me?” she purred. “Will you take responsibility? I want to be your wife. I want to be called Mrs. Blackwood. And…”

Her tone was exceedingly tender. Nathaniel looked at her with adoration. “Whatever you desire. Whenever you wish.”

He sounded utterly serious, not joking in the slightest. He lifted her chin, whispering, “But first, I need to inspect you.”

He bent his head and captured her lips in a deep, fervent kiss.

Isabella’s mind went completely blank. Her body tensed.

She had asked Nathaniel to pretend, to be flirtatious—but she never said he could kiss her! And this kiss… it was too intense!

She pushed him away playfully, forcing a smile. “Oh, you’re so predictable! Nathaniel, darling, let’s all join in!” Isabella signaled to the other women, who began to disrobe. She started to remove her own dress as well.

Vivienne was horrified. She never imagined Isabella would sink this low! And Nathaniel seemed to enjoy it! The thought of what might happen next made her nauseated and disgusted. She stormed out of the hallway.

No… She needed air! She couldn’t accept what she had just witnessed!

Hearing Vivienne’s hurried retreat, Isabella’s lips curved in a triumphant smirk. She stopped undressing. But abruptly, a pair of strong arms pulled her, and she tumbled back into Nathaniel’s embrace.
###Chapter 309

"Out," Nathaniel commanded sharply to the women surrounding him.

Immediately, they rose and exited through the rear door, vanishing to avoid Vivienne's arrival.

Only Isabella remained with him in the room now. She felt the sudden shift in energy and stood to leave, but Nathaniel's arms encircled her waist, pulling her back.

"Weren't you just claiming you wanted to be my wife?" His voice dropped to a low, suggestive timbre that made her heart race uncontrollably.

He tightened his hold, drawing her closer against him. Unaccustomed to such intimacy, Isabella pressed her palms against his chest to push away, but the contact only intensified the desire blazing in his eyes.

Her touch ignited a fire within him, his temperature spiking instantly. As she struggled to break free, his voice turned authoritative and strained. "Don't move!"

The raw hunger in his tone froze her completely. He always lost his composure when she was this near, and it wasn't the first time. Why did he have to restrain himself around her?

"Damn it...! Stay here." Nathaniel lifted her onto the sofa and strode quickly to the bathroom.

If he didn't release her now, he would lose all control.

Before Isabella could process what happened, the bathroom door slammed shut, followed by the sound of running water.

So rushed? He probably hadn't even removed his clothes.

Her mind wandered to the image of Nathaniel under the shower, his white shirt soaked and clinging to his sculpted chest and abs, nearly transparent...

Cough, cough! What was she thinking? Since when had she become so captivated by him? She was free now—she should leave!

With that decision, Isabella hurried out of the room.

When Nathaniel emerged from the shower, the room was empty, and his eyes darkened at the sight.

He told her to wait, yet she fled?

Did she only stay until Vivienne left? Was it all just an act? Displeasure and frustration coiled within him.

Everything felt like a performance. Why was Isabella the only woman who could unravel him so completely? Why did a single touch from her shatter the self-control he once prided himself on?

He had only felt this once before, five years ago.

What was the reason?

Meanwhile...

Vivienne slid into her car, still reeling from the shocking scene she witnessed. Hailing from an educated, upper-class lineage, she had never encountered anything so brazen in her life!

She always believed Nathaniel was a man of refinement like herself, but she never imagined...

This felt like discovering a beloved idol was secretly a addict—it shouldn't be happening!

Miranda sat beside her, speaking softly. "Vivienne, are you still planning to get engaged to Mr. Blackwood?"
###Chapter 310

Isabella’s nails pressed sharply into her palms.

She was known for her pristine reputation and virtuous character.

She had always envisioned her future husband to be equally pure.

But now…

Although it seemed like a trap set by both Nathaniel and Isabella, their connection appeared far from superficial.

The way Nathaniel held her, even kissed her…they must have been intimate.

Isabella had an intense aversion to impurity.

How could she accept a man who had been with another woman?

She rubbed her temples and murmured, “I need time. Wait for my instructions over the next few days. And deal with Isabella.”

Did that fool Isabella actually think she could marry into the Blackwood family? Ha!

Once the Blackwoods found out, Vivienne wouldn’t even need to lift a finger to destroy her.

“Understood,” Miranda nodded, already typing on her phone.

The midsummer sky darkened abruptly as a strong wind swept through.

Rain threatened to pour.

A figure lurked near the Blackwood estate, waiting for the right moment to capture photos.

Meanwhile…

Isabella received a call from Maxwell. “Boss Montgomery, someone is attempting to photograph you and Mr. Blackwood together.”

Isabella frowned. Already?

It seemed Vivienne was planning to use Senior Blackwood against her.

But did Vivienne really think it would be that easy to get a photo? Ha!

“Monitor them,” Isabella ordered. “Keep me informed.”

She ended the call, her expression hardening.

She had no plans to leave the estate for the next two days anyway.

Let them wait all they wanted.

The scorching weather made the task nearly impossible.

The spy hired by Miranda endured blistering heat by day and swarms of mosquitoes by night.

Still, not a single photo of Isabella was captured.

Before long, the Celestial Gala was just one day away.

The organizing team had invested heavily to promote traditional culture.

Isabella, wanting to spend time with Oliver, passed all opportunities to her signed artists and stayed out of the spotlight.

However, on the evening before the event, Adrian called urgently. “It’s bad! We can’t locate Arabella!”

“Arabella is missing?” Isabella’s eyes narrowed. “Have you searched everywhere?”

“Yes! We lost contact this afternoon. Her manager and assistants have turned everywhere upside down. Her phone is off. It’s strange,” Adrian explained.

Isabella frowned. Of all days, why today?

Arabella had been in high spirits lately.

Isabella had provided her with an excellent proposal that would let her shine at the event.

After all she had been through, it made no sense for her to disappear now.

A thought struck Isabella. “Find Harrison Winslow. Check all his usual spots. Notify Julian and Maxwell immediately.”

“Got it!” Adrian sensed the urgency and sprang into action.

Isabella glanced at the sky.

Though it was only evening, dark clouds loomed overhead.

A heavy rain was coming.

If they didn’t find Arabella soon, the downpour would make everything much harder.

It wasn’t just about the massive penalty fee owed to Celestial.

Given Harrison’s temperament, who knew what he might do to Arabella?

If anything happened…
###Chapter 311

"I need to leave now." Isabella turned to Nathaniel and Oliver, who were seated on the sofa. "Go to bed early. Don't wait up for me."

"I want to go with Mommy!" Oliver immediately jumped to his feet.

Nathaniel's gaze fixed on her. "Where are you going? I'll drive you."

Their concern was palpable, their care for her evident.

A warm feeling bloomed in Isabella's chest. "That's not necessary. I'm just meeting someone. There are photographers waiting outside to catch us together."

If only she were photographed alone, she could still claim she visited the Montgomerys for business. But if she and Nathaniel were seen together, things would become complicated.

"Don't worry about that," Nathaniel assured her. "I have my methods."

He then turned to Oliver. "Go to bed and wait for us to return. It's raining tonight. You shouldn't go out."

Nathaniel emphasized the words 'it's raining tonight.' Oliver's eyes darted with sudden understanding.

Rainy nights were perfect for couples to bond. If he stayed home, Daddy and Mommy could spend quality time together!

Oliver nodded eagerly. "Okay! Momo will stay home. Daddy must protect Mommy. Help Mommy find her friend. Then bring Mommy home safely."

"Hmph." Nathaniel ruffled his son's hair before turning to Isabella. "Follow me."

Nathaniel walked away from the main entrance. Isabella had no choice but to follow him.

They moved through a hallway and stopped before an elevator. This one appeared significantly larger than the others.

Nathaniel pressed the call button. The doors slid open smoothly.

The elevator interior spanned at least thirty square meters. A matte black luxury vehicle sat inside. The elevator's sleek, metallic walls made the car look impeccably polished and sophisticated.

Nathaniel opened the passenger door like the gentleman he was. Isabella got in without much thought.

She didn't realize how much her relationship with Nathaniel had transformed. She used to maintain a careful distance from him in the car.

Now, over the past few days, they had begun to feel like an actual married couple.

Nathaniel looked at her with affection before taking the driver's seat. As the car doors closed, the elevator doors shut automatically.

The elevator began its descent to the basement.
###Chapter 312

Nathaniel glanced toward the garage.

His voice dropped to a low warning. "For your safety, you need to lie down."

"Lie down?" Isabella frowned at the strange instruction.

Before she could question him further, he pulled her arm.

She tumbled forward, landing across his lap.

His clean, masculine scent filled her senses.

The position was completely improper.

She struggled to sit up.

"Someone's there," he stated curtly.

Two words. Grave and serious.

She immediately stopped moving.

The tinted windows of Nathaniel's car were no match for modern paparazzi equipment. Their high-tech cameras could see right through them. If a photographer captured Isabella sitting beside Nathaniel, Vivienne would undoubtedly show the evidence to Reginald Blackwood.

Isabella had no choice. She remained pressed against his thigh.

Nathaniel hit the accelerator. The car shot out of the garage.

The man hiding outside the mansion scowled. The car emerged from a different exit? That was suspicious.

Someone else must be inside. He raised his camera, focusing the lens on the vehicle.

He was startled to see only Nathaniel driving. No passenger.

How odd. Where was Isabella? Why use a different garage then?

The car accelerated onto the main road. Golden evening light glinted off its polished surface.

Once certain they weren't being followed, Isabella began to push herself upright.

A sharp pain shot through her scalp. She cried out.

Her hair was caught. Tangled in the zipper of his pants.

She tugged at the metal fastener in a panic.

Nathaniel had no choice. He swerved, pulling over beneath a large tree.

"Don't move," he commanded. "Let me handle it."

Mortified, Isabella dropped her hands.

Nathaniel carefully gathered her hair, moving it to one side. A single strand was tightly wound around the zipper's teeth. He tried to work it free gently.

His efforts only made it worse. More hairs became ensnared in the metal.

Isabella's neck ached from holding her head at an awkward angle. She shifted slightly to relieve the strain.

"How is it going?" she asked, her voice strained.

"Bear with me," he replied softly, his focus entirely on the delicate task.
###Chapter 313

Isabella finally relaxed her grip, noticing Nathaniel’s uncomfortable expression.

“It’s just hair,” she said quickly, brushing it off. “Don’t worry about it.”

He stayed quiet. She was right—it was only a few strands tangled.

“Where to next?” he asked.

“Let me check…” She pulled out her phone, scanning the intel Maxwell had sent. The map highlighted several properties owned by Harrison Winslow in the area.

She typed a quick message to Maxwell: [Searching this sector. You take the other zone. Stay alert.]

Maxwell: [Understood.]

She tucked her phone away. “Willowbrook District,” she told Nathaniel.

Willowbrook was an aging, neglected part of town. If Harrison had taken Arabella anywhere, this was the most probable location.

Nathaniel drove to the specified area and parked near a dilapidated house. Isabella noted the complete darkness inside—no signs of life—but she couldn’t rule out activity on the upper floors. “Wait here,” she instructed. “I’ll scout it.”

“No, you stay.” Nathaniel retrieved a compact surveillance drone. He assembled it swiftly, then piloted the device into the property’s perimeter.

“What is that?” Isabella frowned.

“A thermal drone. It detects body heat. Shows if anyone’s inside.” His focus remained entirely on the controls.

The drone navigated obstacles smoothly, entering Harrison’s house with precision. It began an automated sweep of the interior.

Isabella watched the data stream onto the screen, impressed. She had always considered her own inventions advanced, but Nathaniel’s tech was on another level entirely.

This was the unmatched Blackwood Corporation, after all.

After a few minutes, the drone returned. The thermal scan confirmed the house was empty.

They moved to the next property and repeated the process. Each search came up blank. They cleared the entire block with no leads.

Maxwell and his team combed through alleys and warehouses, eventually messaging her: [Nothing.]

They had hit a wall.

Isabella’s expression darkened. Harrison and Arabella had vanished without a trace. Would they ever find them?

A sudden flash of lightning split the sky, followed by a roar of thunder. Rain was coming. And if it started pouring, everything would become harder.

If Harrison had hurt Arabella, the rain would wash away evidence. The thought made Isabella’s stomach tighten.

Seeing her concern, Nathaniel pulled out his phone to contact his Ace Team. Just then, a small pink car pulled up beside them.

The window rolled down. The driver leaned out. It was Genevieve.

Isabella lowered her window. “What are you doing here?”

Genevieve’s eyes were sharp. “Follow me if you want to find them.”
###Chapter 314

Gigi slammed her foot on the accelerator and sped off.

Nathaniel immediately restarted his engine and pursued her.

The two cars headed toward the city limits.

Just before crossing into the metropolitan area, both vehicles screeched to a halt before a row of derelict structures.

Gigi stepped out of her car and marched straight into a narrow alley.

Isabella and Nathaniel moved quickly, staying close behind her.

Thunder cracked violently across the sky.

Intermittent flashes of lightning briefly illuminated the surroundings.

In those stark, electric moments, Isabella glimpsed a dilapidated zone behind the buildings.

A murky river flowed sluggishly beyond the alley.

It was shocking that such a neglected area existed in Westchester.

The front façades of the buildings were deceptively intact.

But hidden behind them lay this forgotten wasteland.

Wild, untamed grass grew everywhere.

Isabella’s instincts screamed that Harrison was here.

Sure enough, near the riverbank stood a crumbling bridge.

It led to a rusted metal door set into a concrete hub.

As they approached, muffled voices echoed from within.

Isabella’s brow furrowed.

No wonder Maxwell’s team had failed to locate this place during their perimeter search.

Who would have imagined such a hidden spot behind these structures?

She turned to Gigi. “Stay here. I’ll check it out.”

“No,” Gigi insisted firmly. “I’m part of this. I need to face it myself—for closure. Only step in if you see I’m overpowered.”

Without waiting for a reply, Gigi strode onto the bridge.

The storm raged on, thunder roaring, lightning flashing.

Yet Gigi’s slight frame moved with unshakeable resolve.

Isabella observed the transformation.

Gigi was no longer the rumored girl-next-door.

She had become a fighter, reclaiming what was hers.

Isabella retreated, concealing herself behind a thick tree trunk.

Nathaniel positioned himself beside her, muscles taut, ready to spring.

The hub was rectangular, roughly a dozen square meters.

It had once served as a shelter for the homeless.

Over time, occupants had added a metal door for protection from the elements.

Inside, the space was cramped and dim, lit only by a single flickering candle.

Arabella was on her knees, hands and feet bound tightly.

Her eyes were red-rimmed, pleading. “Harrison Winslow, you have to stop this! It’s a crime! You’ll go to prison—”

“Shut up!” Harrison snarled, gripping her throat. “Even if I don’t, you’ll have Isabella Montgomery send her lawyers after me! I’ll end up in jail regardless! What will I have left when I get out? Nothing! Haven’t I treated you well all these years? How can you be so cruel?”

“Me? Cruel?” Arabella choked, her face flushing from the pressure. “I gave you my youth! I borrowed money for you whenever you asked, even when I had none!”

“You made me the other woman! You blamed everything on me! Did you ever care about my feelings? Who’s the heartless one here?”

Her voice was raw with pain and betrayal.

Harrison’s rage boiled over. “Because you’re a fool! You chose to be with me! You brought this on yourself!”

“I don’t have time for this. If you don’t drop the charges, I’ll ruin you!”

He shoved her away violently.

Then he grabbed a red-hot iron rod heating in a coal brazier.

The metal glowed ominously, radiating intense heat.

Arabella’s eyes filled with utter devastation.

He called her a fool.

He said she deserved it.

Was he really capable of this?

Was this her reward for years of love?

Harrison advanced step by step.

The searing iron moved closer to her face.
###Chapter 315

Arabella squeezed her eyes shut in terror, bracing for the searing pain.

Suddenly…

Crash!

The metal door burst open.

Genevieve stormed into the hub with the raging tempest at her back. Harrison froze in shock.

“Genevieve? What… How did you get here?”

Arabella stared in disbelief. How had Genevieve tracked them to this derelict location?

Genevieve let out a bitter laugh. “Harrison Winslow. Do you recall our first meeting?”

Harrison’s hand stilled. That was seven years ago. A film crew had been shooting on location near here.

Genevieve’s dog had bolted into this very hub. She’d chased after it, only to injure her leg and tumble into the raging river.

Harrison had been on a call nearby. Hearing the disturbance, he’d rushed over and pulled her from the water.

The thunder and lightning tonight mirrored that stormy day. The sky had darkened then too, rain lashing down. Yet Harrison had shielded her, carrying her into this very hub for shelter…

“Of course I remember,” Harrison sneered. “How could I forget? You’d be dead if not for me. And how did you repay me? How did your family repay me?”

“All these years, every single one of you looked down on me. You pressured me! Threw money at me like I was some beggar! Is that how you treat the man who saved your life?”

“If I could go back, I never would have saved you! I should have let you drown!”

Genevieve recoiled as if struck. His words sent a jolt of disbelief through her.

They had given him a substantial sum. Her parents had treated him with respect, kindly asking him to take good care of her!

He had clung to this twisted resentment.

The Harrison from back then was a different man. He had held her, cared for her, revived her.

To help her breathe, he’d unbuttoned her blouse. When Genevieve finally awoke to the sound of rain pounding on the hub’s roof, Harrison had vowed, “I’ll take care of you for the rest of my life.”

He had clearly forgotten that promise. He was a stranger now.

Her heart shattered. Genevieve glared at him. “I never imagined you saw us that way. We never looked down on you. We never thought of you as a beggar.”

“No matter what trouble you were in, we always tried to help. How could you think so poorly of us? Now, please, calm down. Don’t make this worse. Let her go,” she pleaded.

“Let her go?” Harrison barked a harsh laugh. “So I can rot in jail while you seize all my assets? Don’t be ridiculous! Get out! You have no say here!” He lunged for Arabella, grabbing her throat. His other hand brandished the red-hot iron toward her eyes.

“Arabella Fontaine! Call the court right now! Tell them you’re dropping all charges! Do it, or I’ll burn your eyes out right here! You’ll be blind forever!”

The scorching metal hovered dangerously close. Arabella could feel its intense heat against her skin.

She paled, frozen in sheer terror. Genevieve was equally horrified. She never thought she’d see the man she loved descend into such madness.

“No! Stop!” Genevieve cried out. “I promise you’ll keep your assets after you serve your time! I won’t touch a single penny! We can draft the separation agreement right now! I never wanted your money! Even after your betrayal, I never planned to sue! I swear!”

“I don’t believe you!” Harrison roared. “I’m not going to jail! Get out! If you called the police, I’ll find a way to end you and your daughter! Like this!”

He growled, thrusting the iron even closer. The burning tip nearly touched Arabella’s eyeball.

Suddenly…

A black dart sliced through the dark air. It struck Harrison’s arm with deadly precision, embedding deep into his flesh. Blood instantly gushed from the wound.

“Argh!”

Harrison screamed in agony. The iron clattered loudly to the ground. Both Arabella and Genevieve stood petrified, stunned by the sudden, violent turn of events.
###Chapter 316

“What are you waiting for? Take him down!”

The sharp command cut through the tension. Arabella and Genevieve spun around to see Isabella Montgomery watching them from a short distance.

Her voice snapped them into action. Genevieve immediately sliced through the ropes binding Arabella with the dagger.

Harrison Winslow writhed on the floor in agony. He struggled to rise and retaliate, but Genevieve delivered a brutal kick to his backside.

“That’s for me! Seven years of marriage wasted on your lies!”

“Argh!” Harrison crashed back onto the concrete.

Genevieve then aimed a fierce kick at his face. “And that’s for my daughter! You robbed her of a father and broke her heart!”

“Stop! I’ll kill you both!” Harrison roared, yanking the dart from his arm and lunging at Genevieve.

Her reflexes were too slow. The dart tip hovered inches from her throat.

Arabella tackled him, sinking her teeth deep into his hand. “Run!” she muffled through clenched teeth.

“You’re dead!” Harrison raised the dart toward Arabella’s skull.

A surge of adrenaline empowered Genevieve. She drove her knee straight into his groin.

A deafening scream echoed through the space.

Harrison collapsed, curling into a fetal position. Veins bulged across his forehead.

The women exchanged a fiery glance. They unleashed a synchronized barrage of kicks.

“Filthy cheater! Disgusting pig! Die!”

Every strike released years of pent-up fury. Each impact symbolized their wasted sacrifices.

This was their closure.

Harrison’s cries faded as he lost consciousness.

Isabella observed from the shadows, a satisfied smile touching her lips. This was how women should reclaim their power. Cheaters deserved nothing less.

She summoned Maxwell Carter and Penelope Sinclair to handle the cleanup. Harrison was dragged away.

Penelope would escort both women home.

Under the building’s harsh lights, Arabella approached Isabella. “Thank you, Ms. Montgomery. But I won’t be returning to the company tonight. Genevieve and I need time together.”

Isabella nodded. “Take the night. Remember, the event starts at ten tomorrow morning.”

“I won’t let you down,” Arabella promised.

As she turned to leave, Arabella paused. “Ms. Montgomery…your hair…there’s a patch missing…”

Genevieve’s eyes widened as she stared at Nathaniel Blackwood’s trousers. “Mr. Blackwood…your zipper…”

A clump of hair was tangled in the metal teeth.

Only one explanation existed. Isabella’s cheeks flushed crimson.
###Chapter 317

Isabella and Arabella could clearly see the strands of hair tangled on Nathaniel's zipper, even in the dim light.

How utterly mortifying!

Isabella and Arabella were completely stunned. It never crossed their minds that Isabella Montgomery had that kind of relationship with Nathaniel Blackwood!

Despite their shock, neither woman had the time or the nerve to ask for details. They chose to stay silent on the subject.

Isabella shot Nathaniel a sharp look...

Arabella noticed Isabella's flushed, embarrassed face and quickly tried to smooth things over. "Don't worry, Ms. Montgomery, Mr. Blackwood. We won't breathe a word of this to anyone. Our lips are sealed."

"Yes, we're so sorry for interrupting your evening. Please, don't let us stop you," added Genevieve, pulling at Arabella's arm to leave. Isabella and Nathaniel were probably furious after their intimate moment was ruined by the whole Harrison fiasco...

No wonder Nathaniel had been stone-faced and silent the entire time.

"Drive," Arabella commanded Penelope urgently, "Now!"

"Right away!" The car sped off, leaving Isabella and Nathaniel standing alone under the streetlamp.

Isabella was at a complete loss for words.

Damn it! Clearing up this misunderstanding was going to be impossible. Those two had completely the wrong idea, and their expressions said it all... Isabella's reputation was in tatters! She should have made Nathaniel remove the hair himself, or just helped him!

She turned to him helplessly. "Well, now you have to fix this for me!"

"Fix what?" Nathaniel's voice was a low, magnetic rumble.

"This misunderstanding!" Isabella snapped.

This was never her strong suit. Since Nathaniel always claimed to be so resourceful, he should know how to clean up this mess... Right?

However, Nathaniel merely frowned. "What misunderstanding?"

"Damn you! You set me up!" Nathaniel didn't flinch as Isabella punched his arm.

Her strength was nothing to him; he didn't even blink. He just looked at her. "Isabella, there's no need for embarrassment. Anyone who's been in love knows this is a genuine, intimate moment between a couple."

His tone was calm and matter-of-fact, as if stating a simple philosophical truth.

Isabella rolled her eyes and scoffed, "Oh, and you're an expert on that?" Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. Isabella felt a sharp, uneasy prick in her heart at the sudden change in his demeanor.

Still... It made sense. Nathaniel was 28 years old. How could he be inexperienced? He must have had past relationships, probably more than one...

The thought sent Isabella's emotions into a tailspin. Her heart felt strangely unsettled, almost panicky.

She quickly changed the subject. "It's going to rain soon. Let's go home."

As she turned to walk to the car, Nathaniel grabbed her arm, his voice rough. "Isabella, wait—"

"Hmph. Why are you telling me this?" She shook off his hand casually and said, "I get it. We're all adults here. Who hasn't been with someone before? Honestly, I'd laugh if you were still a virgin. A man should act like a man."

Nathaniel's words died on his lips. He swallowed them back. Other than the incident five years ago, he was, in fact, still untouched. Would Isabella look down on him for that?

Did she truly not care about his past and have zero interest in him? That must be it; her lack of curiosity about his history meant she felt nothing for him. Suddenly, a loud crack of thunder boomed overhead, shaking the air.
###Chapter 318

Thunder cracked violently across the night sky.

Heavy rain began pouring down without warning.

The deluge transformed the streets into rushing rivers within minutes.

Both Isabella and Nathaniel got completely soaked.

Nathaniel pushed aside their earlier conversation.

He swiftly opened the car door for her. "Get in now."

Isabella quickly jumped into the passenger seat.

Water dripped from her hair and clothes onto the leather seats.

Nathaniel slid into the driver's side moments later.

He looked even more drenched than she was.

Isabella grabbed tissues from the console.

She wiped her face and handed some to Nathaniel.

He accepted them and dried himself quickly.

Nathaniel started the engine and drove toward Blackwood Estate.

He worried the cold rainwater would make her sick.

The car moved slowly through the stormy darkness.

Raindrops hammered loudly against the windshield.

Isabella stared out at the torrential downpour.

Her expression grew tense and distant.

This storm reminded her of that night five years ago.

She had just given birth to a stillborn child.

Everyone wanted her gone immediately.

They shipped her off to Africa without a second thought.

So much had changed since that terrible time.

Her thoughts turned inward once more.

What right did she have to judge Nathaniel?

At least his encounter was with an ex-girlfriend.

But she...she had been violently taken against her will.

She had carried a child from that violation.

A sudden loud noise jerked her from her thoughts.

Hiss!

The car lurched to an abrupt stop.

Nathaniel's voice cut through the noise. "The engine flooded. Stay put."

He opened his door to assess the damage.

Water immediately rushed into the vehicle.

Nathaniel moved quickly to her side.

He pulled open her door before she could react.

Strong arms lifted her from the seat.

Even his considerable height was no match for the water.

It reached past his waist as he carried her.

He held her high above the swirling flood.

She couldn't even see his legs beneath the dark water.

Nathaniel's gaze fixed on a building through the rain.

"The Grand Monarch is close. We'll stay there tonight."

His tone left no room for argument.

Isabella's heart beat faster at his words.

Getting a room together this late?

They had shared a bed before, but always with separate rooms available.

She scanned their surroundings through the pouring rain.

No other hotels were visible nearby.

The Grand Monarch stood as their only option.

Memories of five years ago surfaced instantly.

Victoria had sent her to that same hotel back then.

There had been no available rooms that night either.

"The Phoenix Hotel is the next closest," she suggested.

"It would take too long to reach in this weather."

Nathaniel adjusted his grip on her. "The Grand Monarch will have space."

He began moving through the chest-deep water.

The Grand Monarch was Westchester's largest luxury hotel.

It spanned nineteen floors of opulent accommodations.

They finally reached the grand entrance.

A receptionist's eyes widened in recognition.

Mr. Blackwood here at this hour!

And carrying a woman in his arms!

Isabella immediately turned her face away.

She buried it against Nathaniel's chest.

Another headline scandal was the last thing she needed right now.
###Chapter 319

Isabella Montgomery, usually so bold and defiant, now felt like a frightened kitten nestled in Nathaniel Blackwood's embrace.

A faint smile touched Nathaniel's lips, but he quickly schooled his expression. "Bring two sets of clothing to the suite immediately," he commanded.

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood." The staff kept their eyes lowered, not daring to glance at the woman in his arms. Some things were better left unseen if they valued their employment.

Nathaniel carried Isabella into the elevator, which ascended smoothly to the penthouse level.

While the rest of the building housed private karaoke rooms, the top floor contained only one space—the exclusive presidential suite.

This suite belonged solely to Nathaniel Blackwood. It remained vacant when he wasn't present, maintained daily by a specialized cleaning crew.

Entering the lavish room, Nathaniel glanced down at the woman still hiding her face against his chest. "How much longer do you plan to stay like this?"

Isabella started at his voice, scrambling out of his arms. She stood upright, but as her eyes swept the room, an odd sense of familiarity washed over her.

She'd been here before.

Every detail seemed recognizable. How was that possible?

Nathaniel noticed her strange expression and assumed she felt unwell. "You should shower first."

Isabella didn't respond, instead wandering through the space. The familiarity intensified with each step, particularly when she paused outside the bedroom.

The sight of the large gray bed triggered fragmented memories that flashed through her mind.

She struggled to grasp any single memory, but the images vanished as quickly as they appeared.

Something felt wrong.

She stood frozen by the bedroom door, straining to remember.

A man's figure materialized in her mind, followed by a sharp, stabbing pain in her skull.

"Ah!" she cried out, clutching her head.

Nathaniel was at her side instantly. "What's wrong?" Concern laced his voice.

Isabella massaged her temples while staring at the room that felt both known and unknown. "Nothing..." she managed through the pain.

She'd never been here before. Had the storm affected her mind?

Seeing her distress, Nathaniel swept her into his arms and carried her toward the bathroom.

"Put me down!" she protested.

"Given your current state, I can't leave you alone," he stated firmly, settling her gently into the marble bathtub.

Isabella frowned. What did that mean? Would he stay in the bathroom with her?

Seeing Nathaniel standing in the corner with a worried expression, she explained, "It was just a headache. I'm fine now. You can leave."

"I'll stay. I won't look," he said, turning his back to her.

Isabella stared in disbelief.

How could she bathe with him standing there? Even with his back turned, they were still a man and woman alone together. What if he turned around?

When she remained motionless and silent, Nathaniel frowned. "What now? Do you need my help?"

His question carried a suggestive undertone.

Flustered, Isabella grabbed a nearby bathrobe and threw it at him. "Help? Don't be ridiculous! Get out! Wait outside the door, and I'll call if I need anything. Stop being a pervert!"

The robe hit Nathaniel's back before falling to the floor.

Rather than anger, a slight smile touched his lips as his eyes darkened. "Fine. Call if you need anything."
###Chapter 320

Nathaniel stepped out of the bathroom moments later.

Isabella finally released the breath she had been holding.

She began removing her damp clothes.

The warm water soothed her skin as it cascaded over her.

She felt immediate relief washing over her.

But as she rinsed her face, the strange flashback returned with startling clarity.

Why did everything feel so hauntingly familiar?

The steamy bathroom seemed to ease her discomfort.

Perhaps the rain had triggered something unpleasant within her.

A proper bath appeared to be the antidote.

She resolved to push these thoughts aside for now.

Stepping out of the tub, she reached for her clothes.

Her hands met empty air.

Her towel was missing.

She remembered throwing her bathrobe at Nathaniel.

It had been soaked through with muddy rainwater from his drenched form.

The garment was now soiled beyond use.

Only a single towel remained in the bathroom.

She had no clean underwear either.

A wave of frustration washed over her.

Then she recalled Nathaniel's words before he left.

She could call him whenever she needed assistance.

Well, she certainly needed help now.

Wrapping the towel tightly around herself, she approached the door.

"Nathaniel?" she called out softly. "Has the clothing arrived yet?"

"Yes," his voice responded immediately. "Open the door."

She cracked the door open just enough to create a narrow slit.

The towel provided inadequate coverage, leaving too much exposed.

Nathaniel didn't comment on the limited opening.

He passed each garment through the narrow space one by one.

Silk pajamas, lace bra, delicate underwear...

She accepted the pajamas without much thought.

But her eyebrows rose when he handed her the intimate items.

He was handling her personal garments so casually?

She should have opened the door wider and had everything passed together.

This felt incredibly awkward.

She reached out quickly to grab the remaining items.

In her haste, the bra and underwear slipped from her grasp.

They tumbled to the floor, unfolding as they landed.

Both froze in stunned silence.

They moved simultaneously to retrieve the fallen garments.

Their hands collided in the process.

Nathaniel looked up sharply, his eyes widening.

She followed his gaze and felt heat flood her cheeks.

He was staring right at her exposed form!

She straightened abruptly and shoved him backward.

"Pervert!"

She slammed the door shut with considerable force.

Nathaniel stood speechless outside.

No one had ever dared call him that before.

This marked the second time tonight she had used that term.

Pervert?

He could show her what a real pervert looked like.

Isabella dressed hurriedly and emerged moments later.

"Go take your bath," she commanded sharply. "And wash your eyes while you're at it."

Nathaniel turned a calm gaze toward her.

Her damp hair cascaded down her back.

The red lace nightgown clung to her alluring curves.

Though he maintained his composure, the image of the fallen underwear remained vivid in his mind.
###Chapter 321

Isabella noticed the intense gleam in Nathaniel’s gaze.
It sent an uneasy shiver down her spine.
She stepped aside and leaned against the wall to clear his path.
“Go ahead,” she said. “Why are you still standing there? You’re soaked.”

Nathaniel glanced down at his rain-drenched clothes.
Right. He needed to get clean.
He needed to feel comfortable again.

As he moved past, his shoulder brushed lightly against hers.
The contact was brief but electric.

Isabella released a quiet breath once he entered the bathroom.
His presence always made the air feel heavy.
Oppressive.
Now the room felt lighter. Freer.

But then that odd sense of familiarity returned.
The plush carpet. The large bed. The silken sheets…
Everything felt strangely known.

Frowning, she walked to the bedside.
Her fingers trailed over the expensive fabric.
It felt new, clearly replaced often by the hotel.
Yet it stirred something deep in her memory.

Unable to resist, she sat on the edge of the mattress.
She leaned back slowly, letting the sensation wash over her.
Images flickered behind her closed eyelids—swift and elusive.
She couldn’t grasp any of them.

The whole room seemed to pulse with a haunting sense of déjà vu.
Even the air carried a scent she almost recognized.
It was unsettling.

Exhausted and puzzled, she eventually drifted into sleep.

Nathaniel emerged from the shower refreshed.
He found Isabella curled on her side, asleep but restless.
Her brow was furrowed. Her expression tense.

He felt a pang of concern.
Quietly, he moved closer.
After switching off the lights, he paused beside the bed.
He knew better than to wake her—she slept like a soldier.
Alert. Ready.

So he lay down gently beside her, careful not to disturb.
And as he settled, memories of five years ago flooded back.
That night. That woman.
The darkness. The desperate fight against the drugs in his system.

He never reacted to women. Not like that.
But her… that stranger… he couldn’t forget.
He never saw her face, but he knew one thing—he would marry her.

But when morning came, she was gone.
Vanished without a trace.

His eyes drifted toward Isabella’s sleeping form.
How perfect it would be if she were that woman.
But life wasn’t that kind.

Isabella slept fitfully.
Dreams coiled around her like snakes.
A familiar pressure returned—one she hadn’t felt in years.
She woke with a start, heart racing.
Dawn light seeped through the windows.

Just a dream. Only a dream.
Thankfully, the worst was over.

Her phone lit up on the nightstand.
She picked it up.
It was a call from Beatrice Worthington.
###Chapter 322

Isabella Montgomery answered the call. Gloria's panicked voice immediately filled her ear. "This is a disaster, Isabella! We were so focused on Arabella that we missed the bigger problem. Hayley Waltz, the co-lead for the event, has been hospitalized with acute nephritis!"

Isabella's expression tightened. Hayley had been recruited from SilverPeak. She possessed a naturally magnetic and alluring presence. SilverPeak had forced a sweet, innocent persona onto her, crafting an image of a demure idol with a perfect figure. It had worked, building her a large fanbase, though she was often criticized for seeming inauthentic. After joining GoldenPhoenix, Isabella had allowed Hayley to embrace her true, more confident and mature self, so long as it didn't damage her career.

Isabella had personally chosen Hayley for the co-lead role in the Celestial Gala, portraying the Enchanting Concubine. Now, with Hayley in the hospital, GoldenPhoenix had no one who could embody that specific style. Who could possibly step in?

"You have to figure something out, Isabella," Gloria pleaded, her voice strained. "The event starts in three hours! Our annual Celestial Gala cannot be a failure!"

"Don't panic. I'm working on a solution. I'll call you back in five minutes," Isabella stated calmly before ending the call. Her mind raced, scanning through potential replacements.

She quickly opened a search engine, looking for models or actresses who had famously played concubine roles in films or dramas. Dozens of images and articles appeared, showcasing various women of elegance and charm.

One photograph, however, instantly stood out from the rest. It was an old audition photo of Genevieve Beaumont for a historical film. Dressed in a pristine white concubine gown, her makeup was exquisite, designed to accentuate her cool, crystalline eyes. She radiated an enchanting, captivating aura. Throughout history, the concubine was often the king's favorite, more beloved than the queen herself. Genevieve's face perfectly captured that blend of innocence and potent seduction. She was ideal.

A determined glint shone in Isabella's eyes. She immediately found Genevieve's number and dialed.

Meanwhile, at Genevieve's residence...

Just as she was seeing Arabella Fontaine to the door, Genevieve's phone rang.

She answered it. "Hello, Ms. Montgomery?"

"Hayley Waltz is out for the Celestial Gala. We need a replacement. Are you interested?" Isabella got straight to the point.

Genevieve's brow furrowed in surprise. "What? I... I've been out of the industry for seven years. I don't think I'm capable—"

"If it weren't for Johnson back then, you would have landed that concubine role. You would have been more famous than ever. You need to believe in yourself. Climb back up from where you fell. If you want this, I will help you," Isabella's voice was firm, filled with absolute conviction.

Genevieve glanced at Arabella and her own daughter. Both of them gave her a strong, encouraging nod. Taking a deep breath, she replied to Isabella, "Alright. I'll do it."

After hanging up, Isabella sent a detailed plan to her agent, Julian Hawthorne, and tasked him with handling the logistics.

That evening, the event proceeded without a hitch. The Celestial Gala was live-streamed, attracting massive viewership and online engagement.

The so-called rivals, Arabella Fontaine and Genevieve Beaumont—the other woman and the wife—appeared together at the gala. One was adorned in a magnificent gold costume, the other in a striking crimson dress. Both were breathtakingly unique.

They led the other artists through the heritage district, eventually arriving at the summit of the ancient city wall. Their combined beauty, amplified by the recent viral scandals surrounding them, made them the center of attention. Photographers fought for the best angles to capture them.

At the climax of the event, the two women made a joint announcement to the public. "We are establishing the EmpowerHER Fund. Its purpose is to provide financial support and resources to women who have been cheated on or abandoned, helping them heal and grow from their pain. Furthermore, we will host daily free workshops to educate women on recognizing red flags and making smart choices."

Their announcement broke the internet. Arabella and Genevieve, women who were once pitted against each other, were now best friends and philanthropic partners. A wife and the other woman forming a friendship and a charity together was an almost unheard-of phenomenon.

Their stunning appearances, combined with their powerful message, went instantly viral. The Celestial Gala shattered all previous records, generating three times the usual attention and discussion. Retweets on social media soared into the billions.

As the event concluded, Gloria's phone was inundated with calls. She ignored most of them. Then, a specific caller ID flashed on her screen, causing her to freeze in shock.

This person was calling her?
###Chapter 323

It was Master Worthington.

A living legend in the art of calligraphy.

A single stroke of his brush could command millions.

His masterpieces were enshrined in the national museum.

A man of his stature…was calling her?

Isabella finally answered. “Master Worthington, this is an honor.”

“Isabella, this event is a triumph. You single-handedly restored Arabella’s reputation! Your strategic mind is exceptional!” Master Worthington’s voice brimmed with genuine admiration.

Even though Arabella was proven to be the victim, the scandal had left a stain. The ‘other woman’ label was hard to shake. It had cost her followers and credibility.

But this move was pure genius.

Not only did it position Arabella as a philanthropist, but partnering with Genevieve ensured even Genevieve’s fans would embrace her. It skyrocketed their public approval.

An undeniable masterstroke in reputation management.

“The credit isn’t mine,” Isabella confessed. “The strategy came from another formidable woman. I have immense respect for her.”

During their meeting at GoldenPhoenix, when Isabella was ready to terminate contracts, Isabella Montgomery had proposed the charity foundation. The plan unfolded perfectly with Arabella and Genevieve’s joint announcement. The results exceeded all expectations.

Master Worthington was stunned. “It wasn’t your idea? There’s another strategic genius in your industry besides Genevieve Beaumont? Who could conceive something this brilliant? I’ll be direct. My granddaughter is facing… difficulties. Her public image is suffering. I need your help. Her help.”

“Well…” Isabella considered Isabella Montgomery’s status and demanding schedule. She hesitated. “She is… highly selective. I’m uncertain if she’ll take the case. But I can ask.”

“Please do,” Master Worthington replied. “Convey my message. Money is no object. Tomorrow at eight. I’ll be waiting at The Ivy.”

“Understood.”

At The Grand Monarch…

Isabella Montgomery had fallen back asleep after sending the proposal to Julian. Troubling dreams made her rest uneasy. She slept until noon to compensate for the lost hours.

Nathaniel chose not to disturb her. He instructed Dominic to bring his documents. He set up a temporary office in the living room, working while he waited.

Dominic checked the time. Anxiety crept into his voice. “Sir, the international summit is at two. Should we wake Ms. Montgomery?”

“No,” Nathaniel’s tone was firm.

He glanced toward the bedroom door. His voice dropped to a low murmur. “Reschedule the summit for four this afternoon.”

Reschedule.

Dominic felt a wave of dread. The attendees were global leaders. Their schedules were nightmares to coordinate across time zones. This meeting had been locked in for over a month.

“Is there a problem?” Nathaniel’s brow furrowed.

“None, sir. I’ll handle it immediately.” Dominic turned and left.

His boss was utterly bewitched. Reason had flown out the window. Refusal was not an option.

The buzzing of her phone finally roused Isabella. Half-asleep, she answered.

“Ms. Montgomery, I hope I’m not interrupting.” It was Beatrice. “I am so relieved I didn’t terminate our contract. The event was a phenomenal success. I owe you a great debt of gratitude.”

Isabella made a soft, acknowledging sound. Her eyes remained closed.

“There’s another matter,” Beatrice continued. “An esteemed gentleman was deeply impressed by your strategic planning. His granddaughter is currently embroiled in a… reputation crisis. He is desperate for your assistance. He has authorized me to say he will pay any price. He is a deeply respected artist. A titan in his field. I sincerely hope you can help him.”

Isabella’s brow creased. Any price? Money wasn’t an incentive. But extra funds for Oliver’s toys were always welcome.

Her current plan for Victoria required patience. She was waiting for Victoria to make her move. The execution was still weeks away. She had the time.

“Fine,” Isabella agreed.

“Thank you! Thank you! He will be waiting for you at The Ivy. Tonight at eight.”
###Chapter 324

Isabella felt a wave of gratitude wash over her. She had been particularly harsh toward Nathaniel just days before. The memory of their confrontation at GoldenPhoenix resurfaced clearly. “Actually,” Gloria continued, “I should extend my thanks to Alexander. Without his interference, our collaboration might never have happened. I can see he genuinely cares for you. His remorse is palpable. Perhaps you should give him another chance.”

“Gloria,” Isabella’s voice was icy. “Do I strike you as someone who would ever take back a discarded man?” She ended the call abruptly without waiting for a reply.

Sitting up, Isabella stretched her stiff muscles. Her eyes widened slightly when she noticed the time. Noon. She had slept far longer than intended.

Stepping out of the bedroom, her gaze immediately found Nathaniel. He was seated on the plush sofa, one leg elegantly crossed over the other. A file rested on his lap. The afternoon sun streamed through the window, casting a golden halo around his powerful frame. He looked every bit the untouchable aristocrat—commanding, expensive, and devastatingly handsome.

He glanced up, his dark eyes meeting hers. “You’re finally awake. Lunch is on the table.” His voice was a low, smooth baritone.

“Excellent.” Isabella let out a soft, almost imperceptible sigh. How did he manage to look so perfect constantly?

She moved to the dining table and began to eat. A question suddenly popped into her mind. She looked over at him. “Actually, I meant to ask. Did you find the bed… strange last night? Any nightmares? Or perhaps some unexpected memories surfaced?”

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed slightly. Memories? The only thing that came to mind when he thought of that bed was the night five years ago. He would never have chosen this hotel again if not for the emergency flood. He couldn’t tell her that, of course. His gaze remained steady on her. “No. Why? Did you?”

Isabella gave a slow nod. “It was odd. I had a rather intense nightmare. Things I shouldn’t be dreaming about.”

A shadow passed behind Nathaniel’s eyes. Was she referring to the incident with Vincent Moreau? Did she dream about that man? His expression tightened almost imperceptibly, but his voice was calm. “It was likely the storm. The lightning, the rain. It can affect one’s subconscious. Don’t dwell on it. The past is over.”

Isabella nodded again and resumed eating, though a faint crease remained on her forehead. Was it really just the weather? She had spent the last five years hardening herself, training to be immune to such external influences.

“Isabella.” Nathaniel’s voice cut through her thoughts.

She looked up, meeting his intense gaze. “Hmm?”

His eyes held hers, serious and unwavering. “You shouldn’t let your past define you. I meant what I said before. It doesn’t matter to me.” His tone was deep, resonant, and utterly sincere.

Isabella’s heart gave a peculiar flutter. Was he trying to comfort her? He truly seemed unbothered by her history. The genuineness in his eyes was undeniable. She quickly looked down, focusing on finishing her meal. “We should head back,” she said, changing the subject. “Christopher is waiting for us at the estate.”

Nathaniel watched her. Her evasion was obvious, but he didn’t press further. “Agreed.”

After changing into the fresh clothes Dominic had delivered, Isabella was ready to leave. She opened the suite door and peeked into the hallway. Her eyes narrowed instantly. A hotel staff member was positioned discreetly at the far end. Without hesitation, she stepped back inside and closed the door firmly.

The corridor was far from empty. If she walked out with Nathaniel now, the entire world would know they had spent the night together in the same suite.
###Chapter 325

Isabella spun around too quickly.

She collided with something solid and unyielding.

Nathaniel stood directly behind her.

Her face pressed against the muscular plane of his forearm.

He glanced down at her. A frown creased his brow. “Problem? Something else you need from the hotel room?”

“Don’t flatter yourself,” she shot back. “It’s a circus out there. We walk out like this, we’re instantly recognized. Do you have any hats?”

“No,” he stated flatly.

She grimaced. Damn it. She’d gotten in hidden in his embrace. How was she supposed to get out?

He considered for a moment. “The offer still stands. My arms are available.”

Again? He wanted to carry her again?

Her instinct was immediate refusal. “Not happening.”

There had to be another way.

Footsteps echoed down the corridor. Multiple pairs. A group of staff was approaching.

Isabella didn’t think. She launched herself into Nathaniel’s arms. Her arms looped around his neck. She buried her face against his chest.

His arms closed around her instinctively. A faint smirk touched his lips.

The staff reached them. A chorus of respectful greetings followed. “Mr. Blackwood.”

Nathaniel adjusted his hold on her. “Yes?”

The lead staff member kept his eyes lowered. “Sir, you haven’t reviewed the quarterly reports for some time. Since you are here, I took the liberty of bringing the latest.”

The Grand Monarch was merely a convenience for Nathaniel. His brother Sebastian often dragged him to clubs. The usual establishments were distasteful. Chaotic. Unregulated.

So, Nathaniel had his people create one. The Grand Monarch had strict rules. An exclusive atmosphere. Impeccable surroundings. Membership was limited to the top thirty entrepreneurs in Westchester and the nation’s elite three hundred families. A million-dollar minimum spend per visit was enforced. Anyone causing trouble was ejected. Violently, if necessary.

He’d expected modest returns. Instead, it became a grotesque symbol of status. The elite flocked to flaunt their wealth. Profits soared. It consistently outperformed every other bar by a factor of ten.

The report held no interest for him. But the woman in his arms changed his mind. “Proceed,” he commanded.

Isabella stiffened. Proceed? Now? Here? He was supposed to dismiss them. Get them moving.

This would take forever.

She was trapped. Surrounded. She couldn’t speak. She could only wait. Silently. Agonizingly.

The CEO began reading. “First quarter fiscal year 2020. Gross profit for The Grand Monarch reached fifty-three billion. Alcohol sales account for thirty percent. Service fees comprise five percent…”

A torrent of numbers. Data. Dry, corporate jargon.

Nathaniel listened. His arms remained around Isabella. The report droned on. First quarter. Then the second. Then the third. Expenses. Services. Facility upgrades. Five minutes felt like an hour.

Isabella was fighting sleep. The man continued, undeterred. “Our five-year expansion plan targets key cities domestically, with a long-term goal of global market penetration by…”

He was moving on to future plans now.

Isabella shifted in his hold. His scent filled her senses. Clean. Masculine. Potent. Her cheek rested against the hard contour of his chest. The defined muscle was unmistakable even through his shirt.

This position was dangerously intimate. She’d been in his arms for an eternity. Under the watchful eyes of his entire staff.

What if someone saw something? A stray strand of hair. A familiar curve of her body. What if they figured out it was her?

She couldn’t take it anymore. The waiting was torture.

She pressed a finger firmly into his back. A silent, urgent plea.

Nathaniel felt the prodding pressure. A slow, knowing smile curved his mouth. He made no move to acknowledge it. Or to stop the report.
###Chapter 326

Isabella’s brow furrowed.
Did Nathaniel truly feel no pain?

She pressed harder this time, shifting her attention to his waist.

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened as he registered the increased pressure.
“Impressive,” he remarked.
“Keep going.”

He continued toward the elevator, still holding her.

The entire lobby fell into stunned silence.
Mr. Blackwood had not only listened to every report but praised their work?
He even encouraged them?

No one had ever seen him in such high spirits.
Was it because of the woman in his arms?

All eyes followed Isabella with intense curiosity.
They bowed respectfully as the elevator doors closed.
“Thank you, Mr. Blackwood.”

Who was this woman who could influence Nathaniel so profoundly?
They were desperate to know.

Even inside the elevator, Isabella could feel their lingering stares.
It was as if laser beams were aimed at her back.

She still couldn’t comprehend why Nathaniel had entertained those reports.
The whole ordeal took eight full minutes.
With so many people watching, wouldn’t it have been wiser to leave immediately?

Only when Nathaniel placed her in the passenger seat did she finally relax.
“You did that on purpose, didn’t you?” she challenged.

He glanced at her, feigning innocence as he fastened his seatbelt.
“Did what?”

Isabella wanted to accuse him outright.
If they had headed straight to the car, he wouldn’t have needed to carry her for so long.
Everything pointed to him deliberately prolonging their very public display.

But Nathaniel’s expression gave nothing away.
He looked every bit the honorable gentleman.

She swallowed her words and turned away.
“Never mind.”

She decided to let it go—for now.
But she resolved to avoid public appearances with him whenever possible.

The car glided smoothly toward the Blackwood Estate.
Isabella remembered Vivienne’s spy and instinctively moved to lie across Nathaniel’s lap.
Then she recalled last night’s embarrassment and hesitated.

Her eyes scanned the interior.
This was the latest Rolls-Royce J11 custom model, with seats that could recline fully flat.

She pressed the button beside her seat.
The leather hummed as it gradually lowered.

Nathaniel watched, his lips curving slightly.
Dominic had delivered the car just that morning.
How did Isabella know its features so well?

What other secrets was she hiding?

Vivienne’s spy was left with nothing once again.
The car entered the private elevator and ascended directly into the mansion.

As they stepped out, Oliver came running toward Isabella.
He wrapped his small arms around her legs.

“Mommy! You’re back! I had them make soup for you! Drink it while it’s warm!”
A maid approached, carrying a tray with a steaming bowl.

It was chicken liver soup.

Isabella’s cheeks flushed.
Why had Oliver requested this specific soup?

He took her hand, guiding her toward a sofa.
“Sit down, Mommy. Be careful. You have to protect the baby in your tummy.”

Isabella froze.
Baby?
Her head snapped toward Nathaniel.
What had he told Oliver?
###Chapter 327

Nathaniel stared at her, equally bewildered.

Christopher had already guided her to the dining chair. He picked up a spoon and held it toward Isabella's lips.

She frowned. "I'm not hungry, sweetheart. Mommy already ate."

"But you need nutrients! Even I know that. Don't be shy, Mommy."

His eyes sparkled as they dropped to her abdomen. "So," he whispered excitedly, "will it be a brother or a sister?"

Isabella froze.

A sibling?

Did Oliver believe she and Nathaniel had been intimate at the hotel?

Of course he would. Why else would he prepare liver soup and mention babies?

"Darling," she explained gently, "Mommy didn't do anything like that. You're letting your imagination run wild. And besides—"

"I understand! You're superstitious and won't talk about it before three months!" He pressed a finger to his lips. "Don't worry, it's our secret!"

Isabella sighed in exasperation.

What were children learning these days? Before she could formulate a proper explanation, Oliver suddenly brightened and scurried into his bedroom.

Through the cracked door, she watched him sorting through his toys.

She turned to Nathaniel. "What do we do now? How do we explain this?"

"We don't. Sebastian said maintaining his happiness is crucial for his health." Nathaniel remained completely unbothered.

Isabella rolled her eyes. Of course he wouldn't mind—he wasn't the supposedly pregnant one.

Speaking of which...

"Didn't you promise to focus on curing Oliver within three months? Any progress?"

"Sebastian went to America. He's studying the latest treatment methods. We're optimistic."

Isabella's brow furrowed. Optimistic?

So there were no guarantees?

She supposed that made sense. Mental health remained one of medicine's greatest challenges worldwide.

Her gaze returned to Oliver, who now alternated between toy cars and dolls with a delighted smile. He seemed to be deciding which toy would suit a brother or sister.

He deserved a joyful childhood. Why did he have to suffer like this? If only he had a permanent mother figure—someone who could give him a sibling. Perhaps then he'd find daily happiness and eventually heal.

The thought tugged painfully at her heart.

A notification chimed on her phone.

A message from Beatrice. [Master Worthington expects you at The Ivy at 8 PM tonight. Don't forget. Thank you!]

Isabella replied with a simple [Okay.]

The incident between Arabella and Genevieve had exploded across social media. The Horizon Night event had dominated international headlines, creating a publicity windfall for everyone involved.

The industry had crowned Isabella with a new title: "God's Hand."

People resurrected her Guci counter-strategy story. They now called her the "Undisputed God's Hand," surpassing even Genevieve Beaumont—though nobody had heard from the former PR queen since her company collapsed.

Isabella had been back in Westchester for less than two months, yet everything had changed.

At The Ivy, Master Worthington sat waiting with a woman beside him.

It was Vivienne.
###Chapter 328

Vivienne wore a beige designer dress that screamed elegance and sophistication.

“You made me dress this formally, Grandpa. Who exactly are we meeting?” she asked, curiosity evident in her tone.

“A tremendously influential figure who can turn any situation to her advantage. Your reputation took quite a hit these past few days, didn’t it? This person can help restore it. Make sure you’re on your best behavior,” advised Archibald Worthington.

Vivienne’s eyes narrowed slightly. An incredibly prominent person? She thought she knew every major player in their circles.

And what did he mean about her reputation suffering? She had sent those system messages to TitanTech users and faced backlash, but she hadn’t bothered to address it. What could a bunch of internet trolls really do?

She looked at her grandfather, her arrogance clear. “Grandpa, why should I care what a bunch of keyboard warriors think? They’re all broke and classless. Their opinions mean nothing.”

“Look at you! How can you be so dismissive? Everyone cares about their online reputation these days. I’ve seen people still posting on your Twitter, demanding you apologize to Arabella!

“You’re my only heir. All my assets will be yours one day. You need to protect your public image. Understand?”

“Fine.” Vivienne reluctantly gave in.

Archibald checked his watch. “Three more minutes. Important people are always punctual. I’m going to the restroom. Wait here for her and make good conversation.”

“Okay.” Vivienne agreed, though she wasn’t happy about it.

Her grandfather worried too much about appearances. Vivienne was too preoccupied with the whole Nathaniel and Isabella situation to bother with trivial matters. Still… if this could help her reputation, it might be worth it.

After all, Archibald Worthington valued his reputation immensely and expected his heir to be free from scandals and criticism to avoid future complications.

Vivienne took out a compact mirror to touch up her makeup.

Just then, the sharp click of high heels echoed through the room. Vivienne looked up and saw a woman standing in the doorway.

It was Isabella Montgomery!

Isabella wore a crisp white suit, looking every bit the professional. She spotted Vivienne and glanced at the room number. “Where’s Archibald Worthington?” she asked.

Vivienne recovered from her surprise and sneered. “How did you find out about this, Isabella? How do you know my grandfather is here? Do you think just anyone can meet him?”

Isabella’s eyes narrowed. So Archibald Worthington was Vivienne’s grandfather?

Since Beatrice Worthington had arranged the meeting, Isabella hadn’t bothered to investigate further, assuming it was just another industry contact. She never expected Archibald to be so invested in cleaning up Vivienne’s mess.

Vivienne saw Isabella still standing there and leaned back in her chair with a contemptuous laugh. “Why are you still here? Don’t think you can buy my grandfather’s calligraphy with your petty cash. His art isn’t for just anyone, especially not a disgusting bitch like you!

“Even if you get on your knees and beg him, he won’t sell to you. Now get out!”

Her words dripped with venom and disgust. The mere thought of Isabella being with Nathaniel made Vivienne’s stomach turn.

Isabella didn’t even bother rolling her eyes. She simply turned and walked away, her steps steady and confident, radiating an undeniable aura of power.

Vivienne scoffed. A cheap nouveau riche trying to steal Nathaniel from her? She would make her pay dearly.

When Archibald returned to the room, he checked his watch with a puzzled expression. “What’s going on? Didn’t she say she’d be on time? Where is she?”

“Grandpa, why don’t you call and ask? Who would dare keep you waiting?” Vivienne suggested.

Archibald agreed and took out his phone to call Beatrice. Little did he know…
###Chapter 329

“Isabella? Where is she?” Nathaniel’s voice was sharp through the phone.

“Mr. Blackwood! She did arrive, but she claimed your granddaughter offended her and forced her departure!” Gloria’s tone was strained with helplessness.

Archibald Worthington’s brow furrowed deeply. The expert he’d pleaded with came, and his own granddaughter drove her away?

He ended the call abruptly, his palm slamming onto the polished mahogany desk. “Vivienne! What is the meaning of this? Do you comprehend how difficult it was to secure this meeting? How could you be so foolish? Do you even care about salvaging your reputation? I, Archibald Worthington, will disinherit you!”

His face flushed a deep crimson, his neatly trimmed mustache seeming to bristle with his rage.

Vivienne had never witnessed her grandfather so enraged. She quickly tried to explain. “Grandfather, I did not dismiss the person you invited! I only removed Isabella Montgomery from the premises!”

She stopped mid-sentence, her eyes narrowing as a dreadful suspicion took hold. “Grandfather… the expert you invited… it wasn’t her, was it?”

“How would I know her name? All I know is she masterminded the Celestial Gala! She transformed Arabella Fontaine and Genevieve Beaumont overnight! One was a perpetual third wheel, the other a faded star! Yet she made them both shine! Your situation would be trivial for her! Why must you always let your temper destroy everything?!”

Archibald’s roar echoed in the lavish study. It took every ounce of his self-control not to strike his granddaughter.

The truth crashed down on Vivienne. Who else could have engineered those turnarounds but Isabella Montgomery?

The so-called expert her grandfather revered was that woman all along!

She had dressed meticulously, prepared to humble herself before the expert… only to find it was Isabella? Her grandfather wanted her to beg Isabella for help?

Fury ignited within her. “Grandfather, you are only seeing the surface! You have no idea how vile that woman truly is! She’s sleeping with Nathaniel Blackwood!”

“What?!” Archibald’s white eyebrows shot up in stunned disbelief.

Vivienne met his gaze with fierce intensity. “The expert you begged to come is Isabella Montgomery! Recently returned from abroad! The disgraced adopted daughter who brought shame to the Montgomery family!”

“Grandfather, do you truly believe she possesses such talent? She has Nathaniel Blackwood backing her! For all we know, he is the one providing her with all those strategies!”

“Vivienne, you know I despise lies. Where is your proof?” Archibald’s expression was stern. “Didn’t Reginald Blackwood himself confirm your engagement to Nathaniel by month’s end?”

Vivienne let out a bitter, scornful laugh. “That was his parents’ arrangement! Nathaniel wants nothing to do with me! Isabella has him completely ensnared! I witnessed it myself! They were all over each other! They even live under the same roof!”

Seeing the raw honesty in her eyes, Archibald’s initial rage began to cool, replaced by dawning horror. “Is this true? Nathaniel rejects you… for an adopted daughter from the entertainment industry? An actress?”

“Grandfather, have I ever lied to you?” Vivienne guided him to his chair, her movements suddenly gentle as she poured him tea. “When Seraphina first told me, I refused to believe it. I thought a man of Nathaniel’s stature would never be interested in someone like her. But I saw it with my own eyes at the Blackwood Estate. Isabella even convinced Oliver to threaten me with pythons to drive me away.”

She relayed the entire humiliating encounter. Archibald’s fist crashed onto the desk again, the sound thunderous in the quiet room.

“Preposterous! This is utterly preposterous! A woman of her dubious background… who knows what filth she’s been involved with! How could Nathaniel possibly be interested in her?”
###Chapter 330

To Archibald, a man like Nathaniel should only be with someone like his granddaughter Vivienne.

How could an adopted daughter straight from Africa steal him away?

He looked at Vivienne. "Why didn't you tell me sooner? You're my granddaughter! No one gets to bully you. Don't worry, I'll fix this."

"It's fine, Grandpa. We shouldn't act now. It would make me look desperate to marry him," Vivienne commented, her eyes dark with hatred.

Archibald nodded. "Right. His parents would never accept a daughter-in-law like that woman. But you must watch them closely. Tell me if you need anything."

"Okay." Vivienne raised her coffee cup and took a delicate sip.

To the outside world, she remained the refined and elegant Houston heiress. But no one knew the venomous thoughts swirling in her mind. If they couldn't get photos of Isabella with Nathaniel, then she would just have to... Ugh!

Meanwhile...

Just as Isabella stepped out of The Ivy, she collided with the last two people she expected to see.

Alexander and Victoria.

As always, Alexander was dressed in a sharp suit, radiating the aura of a successful CEO. Victoria wore a soft, pale green maxi dress. Her hair fell over her shoulders, making her look fragile, like a gentle breeze could carry her away.

Alexander frowned. He instinctively dropped Victoria's hand the moment he saw Isabella.

"Isabella, what are you doing here?"

Since Isabella had rejected his confession, Victoria offered to help him win her back. That's why they met at the café. He never imagined they'd run into Isabella of all people...

Victoria noticed Alexander's reaction. A flash of pure hatred flickered in her clear eyes. She quickly masked it, stepping closer to Isabella. "Isabella, I finally found you. You haven't returned to the Montgomery manor, and you're no longer at Rosewood. I've been wanting to apologize. I just never got the chance."

"It was all my fault. I never meant to ruin your wedding. Alexander and I are truly over. What happened that day... it was just closure..."

Victoria lowered her head, feigning pain. A faint blush even colored her cheeks. Underneath her meek words, her real message was clear: So what if Alexander wanted Isabella? He still couldn't resist her body.

Isabella scoffed, adjusting her black sunglasses. "Well, look who it is. Dressed like a common streetwalker. The fake Ms. Montgomery, I presume?"

Her tone was slow and dripping with mockery.

Victoria's face flushed. Did she just call her a prostitute?

She even said 'fake'!

Victoria hadn't slept properly since Isabella's return. She lived in constant fear that the Montgomery family would discover her true identity and throw her out.

And now Isabella just said it out loud!

Victoria wanted to rip her mouth shut. To end her once and for all, so the fear would finally stop.

But she couldn't. Not with Alexander watching. She had to swallow her rage.

Victoria's eyes glistened with fake tears. She reached for Isabella's hand, sobbing. "Isabella, I know you're angry. It was all my fault...! I'm so sorry for ruining your wedding with Alexander... If you want to yell at me, or hit me, you can—"

Isabella's hand shot out.

She slapped Victoria hard across the face.
###Chapter 331 

The sharp crack echoed through the air.

Victoria stumbled backward at least two meters.

She crashed into a nearby hedge, tearing her skirt.

Alexander rushed to her side immediately.

He helped her to her feet.

"What was that for, Isabella?!"

"She asked me to hit her. I simply obliged."

Isabella's voice was icy and detached.

Victoria touched her swollen cheek gently.

She clung to Alexander's arm.

"Don't worry, Alexander... I actually feel better now. I don't blame her."

She looked toward Isabella with pleading eyes.

"Sister, I made a terrible mistake this time. But I promise it won't happen again."

"I'm leaving the entertainment industry. All my resources and connections will be yours..."

"Do I look like I need them?"

Isabella brushed past her without a second glance.

Her shoulder bumped Victoria's forcefully.

She walked away without looking back.

Alexander caught Victoria as she stumbled again.

His eyes followed Isabella's retreating figure.

She wore a white suit that accentuated her striking beauty.

Her lips were their usual fiery red.

This version of Isabella was new to him.

He realized only a woman like her deserved to stand by his side.

Her resources could secure his status.

Her demeanor ignited a fierce desire within him.

He wanted to claim her, to make her his.

Victoria seethed with silent rage.

She saw the raw desire in Alexander's eyes.

Isabella had destroyed her career and now stole his heart.

How could she be so vicious?

But with Alexander present, Victoria had to maintain her facade.

She sobbed pitifully into his chest.

"It's all my fault, Alexander! I'm so sorry... I ruined everything..."

Her crying snapped Alexander out of his trance.

He looked down at the useless woman in his arms.

Annoyance flashed across his face.

"Stop crying. Just fix your mistake. Let's go."

He turned and walked into the café.

Victoria froze in shock.

He didn't comfort her. He told her to make it up to him.

Even he thought this was entirely her fault?

Rage burned through her veins.

She forced herself to remain calm.

She followed him into a private room.

"Alexander, I promised to gain Isabella's approval. I will see it through."

"Look what I prepared for you."

She handed him a folder.

Alexander took it and read the title.

Vincent Moreau. Blackthorn Syndicate.

He frowned. "What is this?"

"Isabella has been tracking the Blackthorn Syndicate. She wants to find Vincent Moreau to prove I set her up."

"This is the only evidence that can prove my involvement."

Victoria looked at him meaningfully.

"Won't she be touched if you help her find this man and deliver justice for her?"
###Chapter 332

Alexander Whitmore’s eyes turned to ice as he stared at the photo of Vincent Moreau.

“It’s a clever plan, I’ll admit. But Vincent Moreau was hidden by the family patriarch so thoroughly that no one has found him all these years. How am I supposed to get revenge for her? You’re the one she despises most!”

“I know where Vincent Moreau is. Sebastian Blackwood tried to have him killed once, as if he was covering up some secret. I happened to save him. He’s in Fairview now, working as a butcher.”

Truthfully, Victoria Kensington had intended to kill Vincent Moreau when she found him by the river. But before she could act, the man dropped to his knees and thanked her, calling her his savior. He swore undying loyalty to her, so she let him live.

It turned out to be a wise decision. Over the years, Vincent Moreau carried out every dirty task for Victoria, remaining fiercely loyal.

“If you arrange for me to be with Vincent and let her see that I’ve suffered the same fate, she will surely forgive you and fall for you,” Victoria suggested.

“What? Victoria, have you lost your mind?” Alexander frowned deeply.

Victoria lowered her head, her expression pitiful. “Alexander, it’s nothing… My reputation is already ruined. If this can help you win Isabella… As long as you trust me, my heart will always belong to you. I love you. This is a small price to pay…” Her voice trembled as tears streamed down her cheeks, feigning terror.

Overwhelmed by a mix of emotions, Alexander took Victoria’s hand and pulled her into his arms. “You’re a fool. How could I ever sacrifice you? You belong only to me!”

His tone was firm and arrogant.

Victoria smiled bitterly to herself. Such bold words—'you belong only to me'—yet he was constantly chasing other women.

Of course, she hid her true thoughts, maintaining a meek and gentle demeanor. “I want to be with you forever too, but I… I also want to see you happy. I want to help you reclaim what you deserve.”

“Don’t worry. The plan is solid, but I have another idea. I’ll find someone to take your place that day,” Alexander reassured her, his voice husky and resolute.

“Alexander…”

Victoria looked up at him, her eyes filled with feigned emotion as if she might burst into tears again.

Her gaze made him feel like he was her entire world, greatly inflating his ego.

He wrapped his arm around her neck and pressed his lips to hers. Alexander wanted to take her again, but all he could see was Isabella Montgomery’s face.

Stunning Isabella, with those endless legs…

He closed his eyes and imagined the woman on his lap was Isabella.

Being as observant as she was, Victoria sensed Alexander’s distraction. She knew exactly what he was thinking.

Even as they embraced and kissed, his mind was on Isabella. Was he using her as a stand-in for Isabella?

Since when had she, Victoria Kensington, fallen so low?

She wanted Isabella dead… immediately!

Only with Isabella gone could Victoria return to her former life.

Isabella sat in the car as Dominic Sterling drove her to the Blackwood Estate. Hearing her sneeze, Dominic asked, “Is the air conditioning too cold?”

“No, it’s fine,” she replied calmly.

Isabella was certain that witch Victoria was scheming behind her back. She needed to stay vigilant and guarded at all times.

Just then, Maxwell Carter called her with an urgent report. “Boss Montgomery, you can’t return to the Blackwood Estate right now. Vivienne Delacroix got her hands on a Special Warfare 919 spy camera to surveil the estate. We haven’t pinpointed its exact location yet, but we know the general area.”

Special Warfare? How did Vivienne get access to Special Warfare equipment?
###Chapter 333

The Special Warfare 919 Spy Camera was a technological marvel no larger than a mosquito's wing.

Its integrated power source allowed it to remain concealed in strategic locations for extended surveillance.

Only elite international intelligence operatives typically had access to this level of sophisticated equipment.

Yet Vivienne Delacroix had somehow acquired one.

Her relentless determination was becoming increasingly alarming.

The camera's microscopic size made detection nearly impossible.

This discovery confirmed Isabella's decision to avoid the Blackwood Estate entirely.

She had no alternative but to redirect her driver. "Dominic, take me to Rosewood Manor instead."

"Right away, Madam Montgomery," Dominic responded, immediately changing their route.

After ending her call with Maxwell, she quickly dialed her son.

Oliver's cheerful voice filled the line. "Mommy! Are you coming home now?"

"I'm sorry, sweetheart," Isabella softened her tone. "Mommy can't come home for a few days. There are some important matters I need to handle. You'll be good for Daddy, won't you?"

Suddenly, Oliver's voice trembled with emotion. "You don't love me anymore? Did I do something wrong?"

The mental image of her distressed son tightened Isabella's chest.

She quickly reassured him. "You've done absolutely nothing wrong, my love. Mommy needs to deal with that unpleasant Aunt Vivienne first. You know how tricky she can be. I need time to prepare properly."

"Oh!" Oliver's mood instantly brightened as if the tears had never fallen. "You should have said that earlier!"

His tone then shifted to surprising maturity. "You must take excellent care of yourself, Mommy. Remember to call Daddy immediately if you need assistance."

Isabella marveled at her son's dramatic shift in demeanor.

The child possessed natural acting talent that shouldn't be wasted.

She maintained her serious tone. "I will, darling. You must behave properly too. Mommy will video call you every day. Don't make me worry, alright?"

"Okay! Kiss goodbye! Mwah!"

Oliver's enthusiastic kissing sound conveyed his sincere affection.

Isabetha hesitated briefly before playing along. "Mwah! Mwah!"

"Yay! Thank you, Mommy!" His joyful excitement was palpable through the phone.

Then suddenly, "Daddy's home! Daddy, it's Mommy! She wants to talk to you!"

Isabella's breath caught in her throat.

She hadn't—

Nathaniel's deep, resonant voice came through. "Yes?"

Even through the telephone, his commanding presence felt overwhelming.

Flustered, Isabella quickly explained. "Vivienne planted a Special Warfare 919 in your home. You should be aware."

"You already know?" Nathaniel sounded genuinely surprised.

He had discovered this information merely thirty seconds earlier.

Yet Isabella had apparently known before him.

She cleared her throat. "Vivienne has been monitoring you closely. With your father's birthday celebration approaching, I won't be returning for several days."

"Understood."

His single-word response carried significant weight.

Isabella expected him to say more, but he remained silent.

The pause stretched uncomfortably between them.

"I'll end the call then, unless there's something else...?"

"Wait." Nathaniel's voice stopped her. After a deliberate pause, he asked, "Did Ms. Montgomery forget something?"

"What do you mean?" Confusion colored her response.

Nathaniel's tone remained even. "What were the last words you spoke to Oliver?"
###Chapter 334

Isabella remembered her words to Oliver and replied to Nathaniel, “I told Christopher to take care of himself, to not make me worry. Why? Is something wrong?”

“The part after that,” Nathaniel insisted.

Isabella frowned. The part after that? What had she said next? All she did was kiss Oliver through the phone… What could it be?

Unless…

Realization hit her, and a deep blush spread across her cheeks.

“Nathaniel! How old are you? Look after Christopher!” she scolded before hanging up.

That man… that pervert could still flirt with her over the phone!

The thought of giving a grown man like him a goodbye kiss over the phone…

Nathaniel heard the dial tone and glanced at Oliver.

Oliver quickly covered his face. “Mommy only gave me two kisses, and I can’t share any with you! I’m going to sleep now. Goodnight!”

With that, Oliver pulled the blanket over his head.

Nathaniel was left speechless.

Meanwhile, at Rosewood Manor…

Isabella stepped out of the car after Dominic parked under a tree, a short distance from her villa. As she walked toward her home, she noticed every other villa was lit up except hers, which was completely dark.

Oliver always waited for her with the lights on whenever she returned, yet…

The absence felt unsettling.

Just then, four elderly men approached her. Spotting them, Isabella turned to leave.

They noticed her immediately and called out, “Isabella! Stop right there!”

Despite their advanced age, they ran toward her with the energy of children and blocked her path.

Isabella’s eyes sparkled. “What a coincidence! What brings you all here?”

“Don’t play dumb! Isabella Montgomery, did you think we wouldn’t see you? You were trying to run away!” accused one of the elderly men.

Isabella forced a dry smile. “Haha! You’ve got it all wrong! I was just testing your fitness. It seems you’re all still in great shape!”

“Ha-ha!” The four men laughed sarcastically before grabbing her arms and marching her into the villa.

“We finally caught you, so you’re staying with us tonight. Don’t even think about running away!”

Trapped, Isabella had no choice but to let them in. “Don’t worry, I live here now. Where would I go?”

One of them sighed. “Lucky for us we decided to try our luck tonight. With your habits, we’d be lucky to see you once a year!”

“Since you’re back, why didn’t you come see us immediately? Is the entertainment industry that fun? Is it better than our games?” grumbled another elderly man with a long beard.

Isabella poured water for each of them. “I didn’t mean to. I would’ve come to see you all after handling my matters.”

“Eh? You? That’s not right, Isabella! Why did you serve Lawrence first? Don’t I deserve to be first?” Silas said.

“You got yours second, what more do you want? Why am I third?” complained another.

“And I’m fourth! Isabella, do you not like Uncle Alistair?”

The four elderly men argued over the water like children.

Isabella sweatdropped at the sight.

No one would guess these four men were titans of their respective industries!

Uncle Lawrence led the Esports industry; Uncle Alistair was president of the International Go Association; Uncle Silas was a bigshot in scientific research; and Uncle Reginald dominated the construction industry.

Years ago, when Isabella was sent to Africa to escape Victoria’s schemes, she stumbled into their territory and uncovered their crucial secrets.

Just as they were about to eliminate her, Isabella used her extraordinary talent to solve their most perplexing problems, saving her own life.

From then on, the four men treated her as their apprentice. They pitied her struggles, trained her wholeheartedly, and…
###Chapter 335

Five long years had passed.

These powerful men had secretly protected her while managing Victoria's affairs.

They ensured Isabella remained hidden from the world.

Under their guidance, she surpassed all their expectations.

Her rapid progress astonished them.

They cherished her like a precious jewel.

Isabella watched the four elderly men nearly come to blows.

She quickly defused the tension by changing the subject.

"Enough," she said firmly. "The water was given without any particular order. No point fighting over it! Why did you come find me again? I'm going to sleep if this continues."

She turned toward the staircase.

The four men immediately stopped arguing.

They rushed to block her path.

"Isabella, you can't sleep yet. Something important requires your attention!"

She settled onto the sofa, her expression curious. "What is it?"

"Since you began planning your return, you've neglected us. My Esports team suffered a humiliating defeat in the international tournament. The Westhaven team acted arrogantly. They mocked our loss!"

"Isabella, no matter how busy you are, you must find time to duel their team leader! Restore our pride!" Uncle Lawrence exclaimed passionately.

Uncle Reginald interrupted, "Esports is trivial. Your loss means nothing. Infrastructure is what truly matters! Every nation now competes to build the tallest structure, surpassing the Khalifa Tower. We must join this competition!"

"Why the urgency?" Uncle Alistair countered. "The international Go tournament begins next month. The Germans claim their AI will defeat our human players! The humiliation would be unbearable!"

"Those are minor issues!" Uncle Silas interjected. "Denmark's newly developed Series-7 aircraft has achieved full autopilot! We're falling dangerously behind!"

Chaos filled Isabella's ears.

Had she only returned for two months?

How had so many problems accumulated?

Solving everything would require significant time...

"Calm down," Isabella interjected. "We'll address each issue sequentially, alright?"

"Good! Handle mine first!"

"No, mine takes priority!"

"Absolutely not! My matter is most urgent!"

Isabella struggled to speak amidst their renewed arguing.

The four men began fighting again.

If this continued, she would get no sleep tonight.

She retrieved four slips of paper.

Numbering them from one to four, she crumpled each into a ball.

Placing them in her palm, she announced, "Draw your lots. Your number determines the order."

"Brilliant idea! Our dear Isabella is truly the smartest!" Uncle Lawrence praised.

Isabella shook the paper balls and scattered them across the table.

The elderly men immediately scrambled for the lots.

Uncle Lawrence from Esports drew number one.

Uncle Reginald with the infrastructure issue got number two.

Uncle Alistair from the Go Association received number three.

Uncle Silas from scientific research ended with number four.

Uncle Silas collapsed onto the sofa, utterly dejected.

Isabella offered comfort. "Scientific research is the most time-consuming field. It requires over a decade of dedication anyway! After I finish the others, I'll devote all my time to researching with you, alright?"

"Alright. You promised!" Uncle Silas instantly brightened.

Isabella's words, however, dismayed Uncle Lawrence. "So you're saying my issue is least important because it's first?"

"Not at all! Bringing pride to our nation is never trivial! Don't worry, I'll make you proud tonight," Isabella reassured.

Since sleep seemed unlikely, she might as well play a few games.

Uncle Lawrence grabbed Isabella's arm and hurried her upstairs to the computer room.

"Quickly, quickly! Let's begin immediately! I want Takashi Yamamoto utterly defeated! Show them we're not losers!"

The other three elderly men enjoyed watching Isabella play.

Although Uncle Alistair, Uncle Reginald, and Uncle Silas typically disliked gaming, they found immense entertainment in Isabella's flawless executions.

They gathered around her, watching intently.

Isabella had forgotten her previous username and password.

She used the new account created at Blackwood Estate: Boss.

A young woman using such a bold name!

"Excellent!" Uncle Lawrence exclaimed. "I adore this name!"
###Chapter 336

The three men nodded in agreement with Lawrence Chamberlain's statement.

Eternal Champions was a worldwide game that required team formations. The top-ranked player would earn the coveted title 'Eternal Sovereign'.

The game interface clearly displayed the current highest-ranked player as Takashi Yamamoto from Westhaven, though he was offline at that moment.

Competitive gaming was their specialty, and they vastly outperformed players from Westchester. Only one Westchester player had made it into Eternal Champions' global top ten, while five hailed from Westhaven.

Isabella Montgomery opened Takashi Yamamoto's profile and clicked a specific button: [Challenge]

The 'challenge' feature was a unique aspect of Eternal Champions, permitting players to challenge anyone provided they staked a cash deposit. If the challenger lost, the money was forfeited.

Isabella deposited one hundred million.

Instantly, Eternal Champions' global chat flooded with reactions to the challenge.

[OMG! Someone just staked one hundred million to challenge Takashi Yamamoto!]

[This is only the second challenge against Takashi Yamamoto in five years!]

[The last challenger was 'kill', but that user vanished. Probably dead by now.]

[This is a new player! So audacious! What makes them think they can challenge the Eternal Sovereign?]

[That's one hundred million. Incredibly bold!]

The four elderly men seated behind Isabella simply smiled. They knew their Isabella always possessed such daring.

Besides, Takashi Yamamoto stood no chance of winning that money. Isabella could obliterate him effortlessly!

Unfortunately, Takashi Yamamoto remained offline that night. As the hour grew late, Isabella turned to them. "You should all get some rest. I'll update you when I hear back."

"Absolutely not! I came prepared to pull an all-nighter! I even brought my supplements!" Silas Granger produced an ordinary-looking pill and swallowed it.

"We already settled this," Isabella sighed. "It's very late."

"Settled? We have more urgent matters. Didn't I have Maxwell speak to you recently? What's your answer?" Lawrence Chamberlain pressed.

Isabella was taken aback. "Huh?"

"See? You didn't even notice William checks on you constantly!" Silas Granger said indignantly.

Isabella felt a jolt of alarm. They were here to pressure her into marrying Frederick Ashford!

"That... Ah! I'm exhausted, I really need to sleep..."

She stood to leave, but the four men blocked her path and firmly reseated her.

Reginald Thornton spoke gravely. "Isabella, we've learned about your developments with Nathaniel Blackwood since your return. Nathaniel is undoubtedly a good man, worthy of you, but his family is far too chaotic."

"Precisely. Consider the situation with the child. He isn't accepted by the rest of the Blackwood family. Marrying Nathaniel would make you a stepmother. Furthermore, Nathaniel's parents won't make things easy for you. It will be difficult."

"You'll be dragged into their toxic dynamics. You won't have time to realize your full potential! Such a waste, don't you agree?"

"Additionally, a mysterious force is monitoring the Blackwoods. Even we haven't been able to identify them. Being with Nathaniel won't be simple."

The four men spoke in rapid succession.

Isabella frowned. "A mysterious force? How do you know about that?"

"Because we care about you. We exhausted all resources investigating the Blackwoods. Beyond their business rivals and internal family conflicts, a mysterious force was involved five years ago with unknown motives. This same force delivered Christopher to Nathaniel," Silas Granger explained.

Isabella's eyes darkened. "Mysterious force? Didn't Christopher come from a surrogate mother?"

Nathaniel himself said Christopher was from a surrogate. What did a mysterious force have to do with it?
###Chapter 337

Lawrence let out a heavy sigh. “How can someone so brilliant be so blind about this? Do you honestly believe that child came from a surrogate? If that were true, why would his own grandparents despise him so deeply?”

Isabella’s pulse quickened. So Christopher wasn’t born from a surrogate after all?

Had Nathaniel been hiding the truth from her?

The way Lawrence spoke suggested Christopher’s birth was shrouded in secrets.

“That surrogate story was just a cover fabricated by the Blackwoods,” Alistair explained. “Five years ago, an unknown force orchestrated Nathaniel’s encounter with a mysterious woman. That same winter, Christopher was delivered to the hospital where Sebastian was being treated. The timing was too perfect to be coincidence. But what does it matter if the child was given to the Blackwoods? The mother could have been anyone. A family of their status would never accept her.”

“Nathaniel’s parents assumed Christopher’s mother was some common woman. Perhaps a prostitute or a gold digger trying to trap their son. That’s why they resented the boy. They refused to acknowledge him as family.”

Everything suddenly made sense to Isabella. Now she understood why Nathaniel always hesitated and avoided eye contact whenever she asked about Christopher’s mother. He had been keeping secrets. No wonder the Blackwoods treated Christopher with such contempt and rejection.

Was this the real reason behind everything?

“A man as powerful as Nathaniel was set up?” Isabella’s voice held disbelief.

“Exactly! This is why William is the better choice! He’s a good man who has always been faithful to you!” Reginald insisted enthusiastically.

Silas nodded in agreement, immediately switching to matchmaker mode. “He’s right! Men like William are rare treasures these days! You won’t find another even if you search with a spotlight! Isabella, you must choose carefully!”

“What choice is there? It has to be William! Nathaniel’s family is too complicated, and there’s some mysterious force involved! Too dangerous!” Lawrence declared, slamming his hand on the table for emphasis.

Among the four elders, Alistair remained silent, watching Isabella intently. He trusted that a smart woman like her would make the right decision.

However…

A beautiful smile curved Isabella’s lips. “Exactly! William is too good for me. I would only end up hurting him. Someone like me belongs with a man like Nathaniel.”

Her smile widened as she spoke Nathaniel’s name. A deep sense of relief shone in her eyes.

The four elderly men stared at her in stunned silence. Had they heard correctly? Did she just choose Nathaniel?

“Isabella, are you feeling unwell?” Lawrence reached out to check her forehead.

Given her ruthless reputation in the gaming world, how could Isabella accept a man who had slept with another woman? They knew her carefree nature well—she had always prioritized her freedom above all else. She wanted to live without constraints after achieving her revenge. Choosing Nathaniel would mean stepping into endless complications!

“I’m perfectly fine! My mind has never been clearer!” Isabella argued. “I was hesitant before because I didn’t want to hurt Nathaniel. But now I know he was set up, just like I was forced into that situation with another man. We’re perfectly matched, don’t you think?”

The four men recoiled in shock.

“Isabella! What kind of logic is that?!”

“How can you call this a perfect match? This is like a blind cat stumbling upon a dead mouse!”

“If you choose Nathaniel, you’ll be dragged into his family’s mess! Do you really have time for that drama?”

“And what about this mysterious force? Nathaniel has been searching for answers for five years with no success. No one knows their motives. You could get hurt!”
###Chapter 338

“Visible threats are manageable. Hidden enemies are the real danger. You cannot take this gamble! Don’t act recklessly!”

The four elderly men attempted to dissuade Isabella from her chosen path.

Isabella remained resolute, offering only a faint smile. “I appreciate your concern. But I am not foolish. I can protect myself. And if I cannot, I have all of you. I also have Maxwell and his team.”

Her words made her choice clear. She had chosen Nathaniel.

“Isabella Montgomery!” Uncle Silas used her full name, his tone grave.

“Enough,” Isabella interjected calmly. “I understand the risks. It’s very late. I am only twenty-three. Marriage is not a consideration for at least another seven years. You should all rest. Guest rooms are prepared upstairs.”

“Isabella, this conversation is not over—” Uncle Lawrence tried to persist.

Isabella glanced at the clock. “It’s one in the morning. How can I face Takashi Yamamoto later without proper rest? If I lose because I’m tired, I will never forgive myself. I won’t be able to focus on the Go match. My research will suffer…”

“Alright, alright! We’ll stop. Go to sleep. This can wait.”

“Please reconsider this relationship. Think very carefully.”

“Go on. Goodnight.”

The four men stood and hurried from the study, each retiring to a guest room.

Isabella smiled faintly at their retreating backs. She wished she had used that excuse sooner. It would have saved her from their lengthy lecture.

She returned to her bedroom and lay down. A cool sensation touched her neck.

Her fingers found the necklace Nathaniel had given her. She recalled trying to remove it initially. Over time, she had forgotten it was there, wearing it almost unconsciously now…

She had been hesitant about Nathaniel. But her uncles’ revelations changed everything. It explained his strange behavior whenever Oliver’s mother was mentioned. A powerful man like him, taken advantage of by a woman? Of course he would be embarrassed.

Knowing Nathaniel had also been violated made her feel they were equals. There was nothing left to fret over.

She and Nathaniel were the same.

This thought brought a smile to her lips as her eyes closed.

Isabella enjoyed the most restful sleep she had experienced in a very long time.

Morning arrived. Her phone rang on the nightstand. It was a video call from Oliver.

Isabella sat up and answered. Oliver’s adorable, round face filled the screen. He waved excitedly. “Mommy! Mommy! I saw the news! That’s you, right?”

“Hmm? What news?” Isabella was confused.

Oliver continued, his eyes wide. “Eternal Champions! Someone deposited a billion dollars to challenge Takashi Yamamoto! Everyone is guessing who it is. Daddy and I both knew it had to be you! It is you, isn’t it?” He blinked his adorable doe eyes, looking like a curious little teddy bear.

Isabella frowned. The news spread that fast? Should she tell Oliver? If she told him…
###Chapter 339

Isabella hesitated to share her gaming pursuits with Oliver. He was still so young. Exposing him to that world felt irresponsible.

She had raised him as her own. Protecting his innocence remained her priority.

Nathaniel’s voice resonated through the phone, deep and assured. “Oliver was last year’s top player in Eternal Champions.”

Isabella froze. “Seriously?”

She knew Oliver was brilliant. But Eternal Champions was intensely complex. Fewer than two hundred players worldwide ever achieved that rank.

Oliver nodded eagerly, his small face bobbing like a little bird’s. “Yes! I’m really good, Mommy! But it got boring. No one could beat me. I quit almost a year ago.”

No one could beat him.

Boring.

Isabella nearly choked. This child!

“That’s amazing! You’re absolutely my brilliant boy!”

She praised him, her fingers itching to pinch his adorable cheeks through the screen.

She decided honesty was best. “It’s true, sweetheart. Mommy did challenge Takashi Yamamoto. I want to make Westchester proud. But this is our secret. You can’t tell anyone.”

The people from Westhaven were notoriously ruthless, especially Takashi. If they discovered her identity, her life would be in danger. She was already entangled in the events from five years ago and Victoria’s vendetta. More trouble was the last thing she needed.

“Yes, Mommy! Oliver and Daddy will keep your secret!” He gave a playful salute through the camera.

A warm, maternal smile spread across Isabella’s face. She was embracing this role more than she’d expected.

Oliver suddenly switched to the rear camera. “Mommy, we’re eating! Have you eaten?”

The phone panned over the breakfast table, focusing mostly on Nathaniel.

Isabella saw him sitting at the other end. He ate with perfect elegance, knife and fork in hand.

He looked like a scene from a film—devastatingly handsome and composed.

Her heart fluttered wildly at the sight. He was too perfect. She could watch him forever.

Remembering the news from her uncles, she didn’t hold back. “Breakfast looks delicious,” she said, a smile in her voice. “And your Daddy is incredibly handsome.”

Nathaniel’s hand stilled mid-bite at her words, broadcast through the speaker.

Did she just call him handsome?

In all their time together, she had never given him a direct compliment.

For a moment, he doubted his own hearing.

Isabella bit back a laugh at his reaction. Teasing him was far too enjoyable. After a few more words, she heard footsteps descending the stairs.

Her uncles were coming down!

“Enjoy your breakfast, my darlings,” she said quickly into the phone. “Mommy has to go. I’ll call you later.”

“Okay!” chirped Oliver before ending the call.

At that moment, urgent knocking rattled her door. The voices of her four elderly mentors echoed from the hallway.

“Isabella! Wake up! It’s happening! Get up!”
“Takashi Yamamoto is online! He’s waiting for you!”
###Chapter 340

Isabella Montgomery rose from her seat and opened the door. “He’s online? Waiting?” she addressed the four elderly men standing at her doorstep.

“Hmph! More than that. They’re being insufferably arrogant! Come to the computer room and see for yourself!” grumbled Uncle Lawrence, grabbing her arm and leading her toward the computer room.

The entire Esports community had erupted into chaos overnight. News had spread like wildfire that someone had challenged Takashi Yamamoto with a staggering billion-dollar wager.

Countless spectators were glued to their screens, eagerly anticipating the upcoming duel.

Isabella settled into the chair at the computer desk and saw Takashi Yamamoto actively posting on his feed.

Takashi Yamamoto: [You challenged me, but now you’ve gone silent since I came online?]

Takashi Yamamoto: [If you had the courage to issue a challenge, you should have the guts to show up!]

Netizens quickly echoed his sentiments in the comments:

[Hahaha! Maybe this person got so scared they wet themselves?]

[Perhaps it was just an accidental click?]

[Haha! Probably just another attention-seeker trying to buy fame. Now everyone knows this user named Boss.]

[It’s already ten in the morning! They must be terrified!]

[Another loser from Westchester! Pathetic! Absolutely pathetic!]

Someone initiated a wave of derogatory comments, and supporters from Westhaven swiftly joined in, flooding the feed. Gradually, the comment section became dominated by Takashi Yamamoto’s fans mockingly taunting Westchester with sheer arrogance and rudeness.

A glint of cold determination flashed in Isabella’s eyes as she clicked on the ‘global broadcast’ feature—a premium option costing $1,000 per use. Once activated, every player currently online—whether in-game, team-building, lobbying, or hunting—would see the player’s message.

Instantly, every online user received a notification at the top of their screen.

Boss: [You woke up early just to greet the Boss. I appreciate your enthusiasm.]

What an audacious and savage retort!

The notification remained visible for a full thirty seconds, effortlessly capturing the attention of everyone on their devices.

In the comment section below the post, users erupted with excitement:

[Damn! Boss is online! I love that line!]

[Well said! Fight hard, bro! Bring honor to Westchester!]

[Go, Westchester! Go, Westchester!]

Numerous players voiced their support for Isabella.

Meanwhile, Takashi Yamamoto and his supporters from Westhaven were fuming. They never expected this challenger to respond with such sheer arrogance.

Takashi Yamamoto also purchased the global broadcast feature and fired back:

[A newbie dares to challenge me? Aren’t you afraid your teeth will fall out? Didn’t you want a duel? Bring it on! I’ll beat you so badly your own mother won’t recognize you!]

Beat her until her mother wouldn’t recognize her? Isabella replied: [Fine, the duel starts now. If I can’t defeat you within one minute, you win.] With that, she sent a duel invitation to Takashi Yamamoto.

Players worldwide fixed their eyes on their screens, watching intently. Even Benjamin Kensington stared at his monitor, reading the notifications with exhilaration as he admired the player known as Boss.

Whether Boss won or lost mattered less; their defiant attitude had already won his respect.

He promptly entered ‘Spectator mode’ to watch the duel unfold.

The mechanics of Eternal Champions involved each player selecting a hero character to engage in combat, with the player whose health bar depleted first losing the match. The game offered a diverse array of character classes: Warrior, Mage, Knight, Healer, and many others.

Upon entering the game, Takashi Yamamoto immediately selected the Assassin class, causing spectators to frown with concern.

The Assassin class was notorious for its ability to eliminate opponents within ten steps; few could survive its lethal strikes. With exceptional agility and speed, a single move could completely drain an enemy’s health bar. It seemed dire for Isabella. How could she possibly win?
###Chapter 341

Lawrence leaned close behind Isabella's chair. "Pick the Warrior, Isabella. It's the strongest class!"

His voice grew urgent. "You have to choose it, or the Assassin will eliminate you instantly!"

Isabella remained completely calm. A faint smile touched her lips as she silently selected the Dancer.

The Dancer was a stunning sniper heroine who wielded an ornate crossbow.

Her choice sent a wave of confusion through everyone watching.

[Is the Boss joking? She picked the Dancer to fight an Assassin?]

[The Dancer is powerful, but far too fragile! The Assassin will cut her down in mere seconds!]

[Dancers need a full team for protection! Warriors and Nurses! How can she duel an Assassin alone with that class?]

[Boss, please change your character! For Westchester's honor! For your one hundred million! Switch now!]

Lawrence grabbed her arm, his grip tight with panic. "Isabella, have you lost your mind? Change it! Right now! The Dancer can't win a duel against an Assassin! They're support characters! Backline damage! There's no one to protect you here… You'll be slaughtered!"

"We'll see who does the slaughtering," Isabella replied, her smile unwavering.

The game began. The screen displayed a vast, wild martial arts arena. Character selection was now locked.

A helpless Lawrence sank into the chair behind her, running a hand over his face in dismay. Anxiety radiated from him.

Every observer stared at their screens, unblinking. They didn't dare miss a single moment of the impending clash.

Takashi Yamamoto: [I'll offer you one final chance. Change your mind. Call me 'Boss.' Alter your username to 'Takashi's Dog.' I might show you mercy.]

Isabella: [Hah! Perhaps you should be the one doing that?]

Takashi Yamamoto: [Arrogant fool. I will personally show you the meaning of despair before this match concludes!]

He immediately controlled his character, dashing toward Isabella's starting position to initiate his attack.

Isabella typed calmly, her fingers steady. [Wait. Did you overlook a small detail? My wager is one hundred million. You've put forth nothing. Are you frightened?]

His pride was stung. [Frightened? Of you? I'll wager one billion! One billion dollars!]

Takashi was consumed by the desire to crush this challenger. He'd completely forgotten the bet. She had chosen the weakest possible character… His victory was assured!

He quickly typed, officially placing a one-billion-dollar bet. He added, [If you lose, we meet in person. You will lick my boot.]

Lick his boot? On top of losing one hundred million?

The terms were utterly humiliating.

A thrill shot through Isabella. She loved high stakes. [Agreed. And if you lose, you change your name to 'Boss's Dog.' Whoever breaks their word is a pathetic coward!]

Their exchange was brutally arrogant and sharp.

If the number one ranked player, Takashi Yamamoto, changed his username, the entire gaming world would notice. He never imagined anyone would dare speak to him with such contempt. Even Lawrence, the leader of Westchester's Esports, treated him with deference.

Who did this nobody think she was?

It didn't matter. This challenger would soon be kneeling to lick his boot.

He responded: [Deal. Whoever reneges is the lowest form of coward! Let everyone here be our witness!]

The spectators were electrified by the brutal wager. The comment section exploded.

[Screenshot taken! This is historic!]

[An incredible gamble is on! Let's see who emerges victorious!]

[What is there to see? The Dancer has zero chance! Absolutely none!]

[You think so? I'm not so sure! I'll place a bet!]

[I'm in! 500 on Takashi Yamamoto!]

[I'll throw down 1 dollar for the Boss! A token of faith!]
###Chapter 342

Takashi Yamamoto: [Hahaha! This is absolutely ridiculous! Listen, rookie, why don't you just quit now? I'll even let you choose a different character. I'd hate to embarrass you too badly.]

Isabella Montgomery: (Enough with the nonsense. Let's begin.)

Takashi Yamamoto: [!!!]

Both players immediately entered Eternal Champions' duel mode.

The duel platform featured a rectangular design with crystal castles for each competitor. No character could cross into the opponent's castle territory - any attempt would result in instant elimination.

The game offered two victory conditions. The first method involved eliminating the opponent immediately upon their castle exit or before they could retreat back to safety. The second approach required destroying the enemy's castle from the outside.

Lawrence Chamberlain watched nervously as Takashi Yamamoto charged toward Isabella's castle. "Be careful, Isabella! Watch out! We cannot lose this match! A defeat is unacceptable!"

All of Westchester would face humiliation if she lost or refused to lick his foot.

"Relax," Isabella responded calmly, her Dancer character moving gracefully from the castle's protection.

Still, the Dancer remained vulnerable to quick elimination outside her defensive structure.

Every spectator focused intently on their screens, not daring to blink. Takashi Yamamoto glared fiercely at his monitor.

He controlled his Assassin character, rushing toward the Dancer with aggressive intent. The Assassin moved with incredible velocity, leaving behind shadow clones in his wake. Within moments, he positioned himself directly before the Dancer.

The sharp ring of metal echoed as the Assassin swung his longsword toward the Dancer.

This was the Assassin's ultimate technique - Final Move - capable of shredding opponents to pieces. While a Warrior might withstand such lethal force, physically weaker characters like the Dancer stood no chance against this devastating attack.

Spectators held their breath collectively. The Dancer would surely perish from this ultimate assault! Her defensive capabilities were too inadequate to survive.

Surprisingly, Isabella's fingers flew across her keyboard with astonishing speed. Just as the Assassin unsheathed his weapon, she activated the Dancer's Immunity skill.

This unique Dancer feature provided temporary protection. Though not offensively powerful, the Dancer possessed this special ability that lasted precisely 1.5 seconds when activated right before enemy attacks.

During this brief window, Immunity reduced incoming damage by fifty percent. However, the Dancer still sustained half the attack's force and could perish if unable to withstand the impact.

Viewers and gamers alike watched the live stream without blinking.

What good was Immunity? The brief duration still left the Dancer vulnerable to destruction!

Yet as Isabella activated Immunity, her fingers continued dancing across the keyboard. While protected, her Dancer launched a relentless arrow assault against the Assassin.

In that critical moment, the Dancer emerged virtually unscathed while the Assassin suffered significant damage from her counterattacks.

The arrows struck true, draining half of the Assassin's health bar immediately.

Half!

Takashi Yamamoto frowned at his screen. This player could simultaneously activate Immunity while attacking with such precision?

No matter. Just a cheap trick.

With that thought, Takashi Yamamoto moved his character two meters backward. He retreated!
###Chapter 343 

That defined the Assassin’s core strength.

He could strike and vanish in an instant.

Creating distance was his specialty.

Leaving opponents stranded, unable to retaliate.

Anyone else would have been obliterated instantly.

They’d just watch him retreat, powerless to respond.

But Isabella Montgomery was his opponent today.

She only lost twenty percent of her health.

A weaker character used Immunity and survived.

She still had plenty of health points remaining.

Lawrence Chamberlain finally exhaled, watching the Assassin flee.

He urgently warned, “Isabella, return to your castle immediately.”

“Restore your health to full. Safety first!”

Isabella’s lips curved into a smirk.

“Absolutely not. I promised to end him in sixty seconds.”

Her Dancer charged straight toward the Assassin instead.

The audience gasped in disbelief.

Was she insane?

The Assassin still had forty percent health.

His mobility kept him perpetually out of reach.

Closing the gap was nearly impossible for a Dancer.

This disadvantage only worsened her position.

Isabella seemed utterly unconcerned.

Her Dancer kept sprinting forward relentlessly.

Takashi Yamamoto frowned deeply.

This rookie actually dared to pursue him?

He’d never encountered such audacity from a low-tier character.

She thought she could catch him? Preposterous!

His Assassin accelerated, leaving her far behind.

The speed difference was overwhelming.

Isabella remained perfectly calm.

Her fingers danced across the keyboard with practiced ease.

A faint, confident smile played on her lips.

The Dancer possessed one unique advantage.

She could fire arrows from extreme distances.

This allowed for attacks from relative safety.

But it demanded exceptional precision and timing.

Once released, the arrow’s path was fixed.

Hitting a moving target was incredibly difficult.

Isabella didn’t hesitate.

Her Dancer nocked an arrow and let it fly.

Thwack! It struck the Assassin squarely in the back.

His health bar instantly dropped to thirty percent.

Takashi’s eyes widened in shock.

She hit him while he was moving at full speed?

This was utterly humiliating!

He needed to crush this arrogant newcomer.

Fortunately, his Final Move had recharged.

He spun around, launching another assault.

Activating kill mode once more, his character split into multiple clones.

So what if she had Immunity? So what if she reduced damage?

Her health was only at forty percent now.

A direct confrontation would finish her.

But Isabella surprised him again.

She didn’t activate Immunity this time.

Instead, her Dancer executed a precise flicker, evading the trap completely.

The Assassin’s ultimate move missed entirely.

She now stood just two meters away.

Isabella’s fingers flew across the keyboard.

A barrage of arrows erupted from her character.

Followed immediately by a single, powerful shot.

As the Assassin tried to dodge, Isabella activated her Final Move.

The Dancer’s ultimate ability allowed a teleporting strike.

She leaped forward, firing three arrows simultaneously.

Then returned instantly to her original position.

The entire sequence lasted less than a second.

The Assassin collapsed, defeated.

[ASSASSIN GAME OVER]

The words flashed across the screen.

ASSASSIN GAME OVER!

The rookie actually won.

How did a Dancer kill an Assassin?

The crowd was stunned, rubbing their eyes in disbelief.

There it was on screen. The Assassin lay at the Dancer’s feet.

His sword rested uselessly on the ground.

The match was decisively over.

Isabella emerged victorious.

Takashi Yamamoto lost spectacularly.

The entire city of Westchester erupted into chaos.
###Chapter 344

[Oh my god! This is insane! We actually won!]

[Boss defeated Takashi Yamamoto! She beat the top player from Westhaven!]

[Ha! The so-called best in Westhaven just got destroyed!]

[One minute flat! Perfect timing from Boss!]

[I'm completely obsessed with Boss! This is legendary!]

The gaming chat exploded with frenzied comments.

The victory felt incredibly satisfying.

Takashi Yamamoto slammed his fist on the keyboard. He never imagined anyone could defeat him in just sixty seconds!

He had been lightning fast, dodging every move, yet his opponent moved even quicker. The loss left him stunned and furious.

As hateful comments flooded his screen demanding he change his username, he snarled at his assistant. "Find out who this person is immediately! I want them destroyed!"

"Yes, sir!" The assistant hurried away.

Meanwhile at Rosewood Manor, Lawrence Chamberlain leaped with excitement.

"Absolutely brilliant! You've restored our honor! You finally taught that arrogant Takashi a lesson! Name anything you want, Isabella! I'll get it for you!"

"Really? Anything?" Isabella's voice held a teasing note.

Lawrence puffed his chest proudly. "Anything at all!"

"Then I want to sleep in peace. Why don't you all head home now?"

The longer they stayed, the more they would pressure her about marriage. Better to send them away before that conversation started.

Lawrence looked utterly baffled. "What? You want to sleep instead of celebrating this huge victory?"

"There's nothing to celebrate. When I have time, I'll train a team for you. They'll help you win every match against Takashi and his crew. You'll need to get used to winning calmly."

Lawrence's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Seriously? You'll actually train a team for me?"

"Yes, I promise." Her voice remained steady and sure.

Thrilled, Lawrence beamed. "Alright then! We'll get out of your hair!"

"Wake up, Lawrence! Don't forget why we came here!" Reginald Thornton glared at his friend.

Silas Granger nodded in agreement. "Exactly! Did you already forget our main purpose?"

Lawrence suddenly remembered their primary mission: to convince Isabella to marry Frederick Ashford.

That was the whole point of their visit!

He turned back to Isabella. "We'll leave now, but please think carefully about Frederick. He's a wonderful man. When he called last night, he mentioned coming to Westchester to see you."

Alistair Worthington added eagerly, "Frederick is even prepared to buy a house here! He's willing to relocate to Westchester just to be near you!"

Isabella frowned. She had expected this... though she hadn't anticipated such strong interest from Frederick.

A thoughtful glint appeared in her eyes. "Why don't you give me his contact information?"

All four men stared at her in shock. Had they heard correctly? Isabella never asked for anyone's contact details!

She always said, "If there's no future, why lead them on? I don't want to give false hope."

Yet here she was, asking for Frederick's number. This was definite progress!
###Chapter 345

The four elders practically tripped over themselves in their excitement. They scrambled to send William's contact information first.

"Add him right now! Start talking to him!"

"Young people need to communicate more these days!"

"It's perfectly fine if you don't know him yet. Relationships need time to develop!"

"Both of you are geniuses! Any child you have would be absolutely brilliant!"

They kept encouraging her, each more eager than the last. It was as if they could already picture the wedding.

Isabella rubbed her temples, feeling a headache coming on. "Relax, I know what I'm doing. If you don't leave now, I won't be in the mood to plan anything at all."

"Alright, alright! Just remember to contact him."

"I brought you a new chess strategy book. Look through it when you have a moment." Alistair placed several thick volumes on her desk.

Silas handed her a stack of recent research papers. Reginald unrolled a set of architectural blueprints.

Isabella watched them finally leave and let out a long sigh of relief.

These men had trained her. They had provided her with endless resources over the years. They were the architects of the woman she had become. If only they would stop obsessing over her marital status, everything would be perfect.

The villa fell into a welcome silence after their departure. Isabella sank into the plush sofa and opened her messaging app.

Since the four elders were so insistent, she might as well get this over with. She sent the contact request. Frederick accepted it immediately.

[Isabella, how are you?]

During her time at the research base, everyone had called her by her first name. The habit had stuck.

[I'm fine. I added you because there's something I need to tell you.]

She wanted to be direct, to state her purpose clearly. But Frederick's next message popped up before she could type it.

[Isabella, could you take a look at this project? We've hit a major snag. The machine just won't function properly. Any idea what could be wrong?]

[I've been troubleshooting for days. I didn't want to bother you, but I'm completely stuck. I have no other choice but to ask for your help.]

His words were polite, infused with a warmth and gentleness that was uniquely his. Even through text, she could feel it.

She had expected a conversation about their supposed relationship. This technical problem was a surprise. Her brow furrowed in concentration.

[There's a problem? Send me the files. Let me see.]

Frederick transferred the documents instantly. Isabella opened them, her focus shifting entirely to the complex data on her screen.

Meanwhile, at the Blackwood Estate…

Oliver tugged relentlessly at Nathaniel's sleeve. "Daddy! Daddy, please take me to Mommy! I want to see Mommy! I want to watch her play the game! Please, take me to her!"

"No. Let go of my arm," Nathaniel commanded, his voice cool.

It had only been one day. He couldn't just show up at her door and bother her. Furthermore, the situation with Vivienne was still unresolved. It demanded his full attention.

Oliver refused to give up. He shook his father's arm harder, his voice pitching into a whine. "Waaah…! I won't let go…! I want Mommy! I need to see her!"

Watching Isabella utterly dominate Takashi Yamamoto had only increased his awe of her. He craved her presence, yearned to be held in her arms again.

Nathaniel's expression remained an icy mask. His refusal had been clear. Why did the child persist?

Just as he was about to issue a firmer reprimand, Sebastian hurried into the room. "Brother, we have a problem. A big one. Latest intel: My future sister-in-law is being pressured to marry some guy named Frederick Ashford. They're currently chatting on WhatsApp right now!"

"What?" Nathaniel's head snapped up, his frown deepening. Oliver was instantly forgotten.

Oliver immediately stopped his fussing. He stood up straight, his wide eyes fixed on Sebastian.

Sebastian continued, his tone urgent. "You heard me. I have a mutual contact with Frederick. He saw some old men messaging Frederick about Isabella. He also confirmed Frederick is texting her right now. He contacted me immediately."

A dangerous glint flashed in Nathaniel's dark eyes.

Frederick Ashford? Isabella was texting Frederick Ashford?

She had been gone for a single day. And she was already entertaining another man?

His gaze cut toward Dominic, cold and sharp. "Get the car ready. We're leaving for Rosewood Manor. Now."
###Chapter 346

“Right away, Sir.” Dominic moved quickly to prepare the vehicle.

Nathaniel held Christopher’s hand firmly as they walked toward the exit. Sebastian followed closely behind, eager not to miss a moment of the unfolding drama.

The matte black luxury sedan pulled away from the Blackwood Estate, heading straight for Rosewood Manor.

Meanwhile, at Rosewood Manor…

Isabella’s phone buzzed repeatedly with notifications. They were all messages from Maxwell and his team.

[Westchester Defeats Takashi Yamamoto for One Billion!]

[Takashi Yamamoto, Utterly Crushed!]

[Who Is The Real Boss!?]

She ignored every alert, focusing instead on the documents William had sent. She needed to resolve these issues so she could finally cut ties with him.

After last night, Isabella had made her decision. She was choosing Nathaniel. But first, she had to clean up this mess with William to get her uncles off her back.

Just then…

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Instantly alert, Isabella approached the door. She peered through the peephole and saw Alexander standing outside.

What was he doing here again?

She opened the door and gave him a cold look. “Back for another rejection?”

“Isabella, I’m here on important business. You wanted to find Vincent Moreau, correct? I can take you to him,” Alexander stated bluntly, not wasting any time.

Isabella’s eyes narrowed. Vincent Moreau?

“You know his location?”

“Naturally. I’ve even prepared a gift for you. Follow me,” Alexander said before turning to leave.

Hesitation flickered within her for only a second. The name Vincent Moreau was all the motivation she needed. Isabella followed Alexander. She could always deal with him later. Finding Vincent was her priority.

With his testimony, Victoria would be finished.

Alexander smiled to himself when he heard her footsteps behind him. His plan was working. Since the last incident, his reputation had been in tatters. Whitmore Enterprises’ stock had plummeted, costing him millions daily. His family and shareholders were furious.

Everything depended on this. He needed to win Isabella over. He had to make her fall for him.

They got into a car that quickly left Westchester, heading for a remote village. Isabella sat in the back, eyes closed, but her senses remained sharp. She periodically checked their route, memorizing road signs and directions.

The drive lasted eight hours. Evening had fallen by the time the car finally stopped at the base of a mountain.

Alexander exited and opened her door like a gentleman. “I’m afraid we have to continue on foot from here. My apologies for the inconvenience.”

Isabella ignored his offered hand. She opened the other door and stepped out gracefully. She stood by the roadside, surveying the area.

A small village nestled at the mountain’s foot came into view. The paths were rough and uneven. Countless huts with tiled roofs dotted the landscape.

The scene was picturesque, almost like a painting. Wisps of dark smoke curled from the chimneys.

Who would have thought Vincent Moreau had been hiding in such a peaceful place for five years?

Alexander closed the car door and walked to her side. “The path is rocky. You should hold my arm for support.”

Victoria had nearly fallen walking here. Surely Isabella would need his help too. A little physical contact was all it would take. She would start developing feelings for him.

And… How would Nathaniel react if he saw a photo of them touching? What if he discovered she was meeting another man while involved with him?

Hah.
###Chapter 347

Alexander never anticipated Isabella’s sharp retort. “Wait a second, do you think I’m that phony girlfriend of yours? Pick up the pace. Don’t slow me down.”

She moved ahead of him without hesitation. The trail was narrow and uneven, paved with rough stone steps that grew steeper with each one.

Despite the challenging terrain, Isabella moved with effortless grace. Her steps were sure and swift as she descended several levels quickly.

Alexander watched her back, his eyes narrowing. How did she navigate this treacherous path so elegantly? One wrong step could send her tumbling down the mountainside. Yet she showed no fear whatsoever.

Admiration flickered in his gaze.

He remembered how Victoria had clung to him desperately when they came here last night. Her vulnerability had fed his masculine pride. But Isabella’s confident composure showed him a different kind of strength.

A woman like her belonged only to him.

His expression darkened as he thought of his plan. He quickened his pace to catch up with her. They walked for over thirty minutes before reaching the mountain’s base.

The sky had deepened into twilight. Village homes showed signs of evening meals being prepared, with smoke curling from their chimneys.

Alexander finally stepped in front of Isabella, blocking her path. “Follow me.”

She remained alert as she trailed him deeper into the village. They passed between ridges and along deserted paths. The gathering darkness hid them from any watching eyes.

As they walked, Alexander began speaking slowly. “Isabella, I’ve regretted my actions these past five years. I never should have enabled Victoria’s mistakes back then.”

Isabella merely laughed coldly, offering no response.

If a man like him could truly repent, the world might as well spin backward.

Still, she wanted to discover what game he was playing.

“I mean every word, Isabella.” Alexander stopped abruptly and turned to face her. “During our wedding ceremony, I genuinely wanted to marry you. I wanted to spend my life making things right with you. What happened with Victoria was an accident. Bringing you to find Vincent Moreau today proves my sincerity.”

“Enough nonsense. Are we moving or not?” Isabella’s impatience was palpable.

Alexander’s face darkened again. He had swallowed his pride to say those words, and she dismissed him so contemptuously?

How dare she treat him this way?

He suppressed his anger, remembering his plan. “You’ll believe me soon enough.”

His cold tone carried absolute confidence. As they walked, he made a quick phone call. “Isabella doesn’t believe me. We proceed now.”

“Sir? Are you certain about involving Ms. Victoria—”

“This is an order. Execute immediately.” Alexander ended the call before hearing more.

Isabella’s sharp hearing caught every word.

‘Execute immediately’? Regarding Victoria?

What scheme was he concocting now?

She followed him to a remote hut nestled against the mountainside. A faint, dim light glowed from within.

Instead of approaching the main entrance, Alexander led her to the side of the structure.

A transparent window allowed a clear view inside. Isabella saw a large, rough-looking man throwing a bound woman onto a bed.

“Forgive me, Ms. Victoria,” the man growled, “but Mr. Alexander needs to earn Isabella’s forgiveness. You overstepped back then… This is your punishment.”

The man’s thick, coarse hands tore at Victoria’s clothing.

Rip!

The fabric gave way. The woman curled into herself on the bed, screaming and crying. Her dress hung in tatters, revealing her pale, slender legs.
###Chapter 348

“No…This can’t be happening! Alexander would never do this to me! Get out! You can’t touch me! I demand to see Alexander!”

“Give it up! Your precious Alexander is obsessed with Isabella now! He doesn’t want you anymore! Tonight, you belong to me!”

The man pinned Victoria down and ripped her dress to shreds.

Fabric tore violently, leaving her exposed in nothing but her undergarments. She sobbed uncontrollably, trembling with raw fear.

Isabella’s brow furrowed. Had Alexander truly sunk so low as to orchestrate this violation?

Even in the dim light, she recognized the man’s surgically altered profile. Her sharp eyes identified him instantly: Vincent Moreau.

His gaze was brutish, features coarse and unrefined. Yellowed teeth flashed in a predatory grin. After hiding in these backwoods for five years, he had emerged to attack Victoria.

“I know you crave vengeance, Isabella,” Alexander murmured from the shadows, grasping her hand. “Consider this my most sincere apology. I vow to never disappoint you again. Victoria means nothing to me now. I will spend my life making amends, repaying my mistakes a hundred times over.”

His voice dripped with manufactured sincerity. Even he couldn’t distinguish truth from performance anymore. Somewhere along the way, his feelings for Isabella had shifted.

Isabella merely scoffed, yanking her hand free. She strode toward the hut’s entrance.

Alexander frowned. What was she doing?

Bam!

The wooden door exploded inward under her kick. She marched straight into the bedroom.

Inside, Vincent was aggressively mauling Victoria. Her clothes lay in tattered ruins.

Vincent flinched at Isabella’s entrance. “What… What are you doing here? This bitch made me hurt you five years ago! Now it’s her turn!”

“Pathetic,” Isabella spat.

She approached the bed, her fingers expertly finding a seam on Victoria’s face. With a sharp tug, she ripped.

Fwoop!

A lifelike silicone mask peeled away. The woman beneath was not Victoria.

The air froze.

Vincent gaped in shock. Alexander, who had just entered, stood equally stunned.

He had paid a fortune for that custom mask. How had Isabella detected the forgery in near darkness? Her perception was terrifying.

Isabella tossed the mask dismissively. It landed at Alexander’s feet.

Her eyes hardened into icy daggers. “What did you hope to achieve with this pathetic charade?” she sneered.

“Isabella, I…” Alexander was utterly disarmed, words failing him.

He had envisioned her falling into his arms with gratitude, not exposing his deception.

Isabella turned her fury on Vincent. She seized his collar and hauled him off the bed.

She lifted a man weighing over 70 kilograms with terrifying ease.

With explosive force, she slammed him against the wall. The entire hut shuddered from the impact.

“Argh!”

He crumpled to the floor, howling in agony. His insides felt rearranged. What kind of woman possessed such monstrous strength?

Before he could speak, Isabella advanced. Each step radiated lethal intent.
###Chapter 349

Isabella Montgomery stood facing Vincent Moreau, her gaze glacial.

This man had destroyed her five years ago. He shattered her entire existence!

It didn't matter that Victoria Kensington had bribed him. He was a grown man who committed an unspeakable act against an innocent woman. A fully grown adult!

A man like him deserved to die.

Her fists clenched so tightly her knuckles turned white. Isabella drove her punch straight into Vincent's face.

"Argh!"

Vincent crashed to the floor, a tooth flying from his mouth. As he struggled to rise, Isabella was already on him, delivering kick after punch.

Her eyes held a murderous glint. Each blow was fueled by pure, unadulterated rage. She pummeled him like he was nothing but a practice dummy.

"Aaarghhh!"

Vincent screamed in agony, arms wrapped around his head as he curled into a ball. "Mr. Whitmore... Mr. Whitmore! Help... help me! Argh!"

Each cry was more pitiful than the last, a symphony of pure pain.

Alexander Whitmore wanted to intervene, but the aura radiating from Isabella was too lethal!

Besides...

Isabella needed this. She needed to unleash her fury. Only then could she possibly forgive him.

"You brought this on yourself," Alexander stated coldly. "Take it like a man."

Helpless, Vincent could only endure the beating, shrinking further into himself.

This only infuriated Isabella more. Her rage boiled over. "Damn you! My life was ruined by a worthless piece of trash like you?! You disgusting pig!"

She hauled him up again, ready to hurl him straight through the window.

Vincent panicked. If she threw him out, he'd be crippled for life... if he survived at all!

Was Isabella insane? Did she actually intend to kill him?

"Wait, wait!" he shrieked. "Stop! It wasn't me! I wasn't the one who slept with you that night!"

"Liar!"

Isabella scoffed. Did he really think she'd believe such an obvious lie?

She tightened her grip and launched him through the shattered window.

Crash!

Vincent flew through the broken frame, splintered wood scattering everywhere. The violence of the scene resembled a high-stakes action film.

Alexander stared, stunned. Since when had Isabella become so strong? He remembered a weak, shy girl. This woman was pure power.

Vincent landed hard on the ground outside, blood spurting from his mouth. He groaned weakly, "Not me... really wasn't me...! Why won't you believe me...?!"

Isabella's eyes narrowed. What did he mean, it wasn't him? Her investigation was thorough. Victoria had paid him. The evidence was clear.

She leaped through the ruined window, grabbed his arm, and started dragging him away. "Save your excuses. I'm taking you to the police!"

She might not be pressing charges against Victoria yet, but she needed this evidence secured.

Five years of pain. They would all pay dearly for it.

Victoria, watching from the shadows, stamped her foot in frantic anxiety. What now? What could she do?!

If Isabella got Vincent to the police station, it was over for her!

Victoria had planned everything so carefully. She wanted Isabella to fall hopelessly for Alexander again. Not only had that failed, but now Isabella was taking Vincent away!

Victoria was about to rush out when Vincent, being dragged raw across the rough ground, burst out in agony, unable to bear the pain any longer. "Boss Montgomery, please! I beg you! It wasn't me! I swear I wasn't the one in that room with you!"
###Chapter 350

I did follow Victoria's instructions to enter the karaoke room at The Grand Monarch.

But the room was completely empty.

Victoria locked the door from the outside to prevent either of us from escaping.

I assumed the plan had failed and I wouldn't get my payment.

Then the Syndicate Leader actually brought you back to the room!

The man who slept with you was the Blackthorn Syndicate Leader!

Sebastian Blackwood cried out in genuine agony. His voice carried raw sincerity, completely devoid of deception.

Isabella Montgomery paused. She turned and fixed him with a piercing stare. The Blackthorn Syndicate Leader? You mean Sebastian Blackwood?

Yes! Exactly! Sebastian noticed her hesitation and seized the opportunity. When he brought you back, he handed you over to me. Told me to act like everything went according to plan. Dawn was already breaking. You looked completely disheveled. It was obvious he was the one who slept with you! How could I ever dare touch a woman the Syndicate Leader claimed!

Besides, Victoria and Mr. Whitmore arrived to collect you just minutes later. I never laid a finger on you. Not even a single touch! I swear to God! Ask Mr. Whitmore or Victoria if you don't believe me. My clothes were still perfectly intact. I hadn't even taken off my socks! Sebastian glanced desperately toward Alexander, silently pleading for support.

Isabella didn't bother looking at Alexander. Her mind raced, processing this new information. Alexander had told her she was assaulted at The Grand Monarch, not The Ritz-Carlton!

She had been taken to The Ritz-Carlton to create the illusion she slept with Alexander.

Now it made sense why the hotel staff mentioned seeing two people dragging her inside.

So that was the twisted plan!

Did that mean Isabella somehow managed to leave the karaoke room before Sebastian entered, encountered Sebastian Blackwood, and was assaulted by him?

Alexander caught up to her. Isabella, it's all in the past now. You've punished him enough. There's no need to involve the police. If you're still upset, I can help you locate the Syndicate Leader. Make him apologize to you properly.

Isabella shot him an icy glare. Do you think I want an apology? I want Victoria behind bars. She needs to pay for what she did to me! She snapped and continued walking away.

Victoria watched from a distance, equally stunned. Was Isabella really this ruthless? Determined to destroy her completely? They had already apologized! Why couldn't she just let it go?!

Alexander watched Isabella's retreating figure, a sinister smirk curling his lips. He had never intended to let her leave easily tonight.

He had to have her. No matter what.

He gave a subtle signal to Sebastian and Victoria before chasing after Isabella.

Victoria breathed a sigh of relief. Thankfully, they had a backup plan. It had to work. No excuses.

She approached Sebastian. You're quite the storyteller! She actually bought it! Come on upstairs. Your reward is waiting.

O...okay... Sebastian struggled to his feet, supporting his injured body. He moved toward his hut as quickly as his wounds allowed.

Everything he said was the absolute truth. He desperately wanted to clarify that. He genuinely never touched Isabella. But explaining further was pointless. Surviving that terrifying woman was enough for now.

Meanwhile...

Isabella navigated the village paths from memory. Sebastian's words echoed relentlessly in her mind.

She escaped the room before Sebastian arrived. Slept with another man.

That man was Sebastian Blackwood.

She remembered seeing Sebastian before, during her visit to the Blackthorn base. He was hauntingly beautiful, devilishly handsome. Isabella, back then, was considered ugly and terrible-looking. Why would a powerful Syndicate Leader ever sleep with someone like her? Something felt profoundly wrong about this entire story. Had she missed a crucial piece of the puzzle?
###Chapter 351

Isabella kept walking, her mind swirling with unanswered questions.

The path grew stranger with each step.

She was certain she had passed this exact spot before.

Why was she circling back to the same location?

She recalled it taking less than thirty minutes to reach Rex’s hut from the village entrance.

Yet she had been walking for over an hour now.

Why hadn’t she found the exit?

She halted abruptly, scanning her surroundings.

Moonlight cast a dim glow over the landscape.

Nothing seemed unusual—just a cluster of huts sitting quietly in the distance.

Maybe she had been too lost in thought to notice her path.

She refocused, determined to find her way out.

But no matter which direction she chose, she always ended up back near the ridge.

This was beyond strange.

Suddenly, rain began to fall.

It wasn’t a storm, but steady enough to soak through her clothes.

“Isabella!” A voice cut through the rain, urgent yet soft.

Alexander rushed toward her, shrugging off his suit jacket to shield her. “It’s pouring. Let’s find cover,” he said, reaching for her arm.

She shoved the jacket back at him. “Stop pretending. What’s wrong with this path?”

“It’s complicated. I only just found out myself. Let’s get somewhere dry, and I’ll explain.”

He draped the jacket over her again and started walking ahead.

Isabella hesitated, but the rain intensified.

She had no choice but to follow.

Alexander led them to a dark cave, using his phone as a flashlight.

Both were drenched, especially Alexander. His white shirt clung to him, water dripping from his hair.

He gestured deeper into the cave. “Come inside. It’s too cold by the entrance.”

She tossed his jacket back. “Explain. Now.”

She didn’t want to spend another minute trapped with him.

He sighed, unsurprised by her hostility. “When I came after you, Rex told me this village has another name—Ghost Village. Once night falls, no one can leave. Not even the locals.”

Ghost Village?

Isabella scoffed. “Do I look like a child to you?”

“I’m not lying. You’ve changed, Isabella. You must have heard of architectural designs that create labyrinths. This village was built on that principle. Without proper light, everyone walks in circles after dark.”

She frowned. She knew the concept well.

Without clear markers, people naturally circled similar-looking environments.

At night, with limited visibility and identical huts and fields, it was easy to get disoriented.

The distant houses were strategically placed to mislead travelers.

She would have to wait for sunrise to see the ridges clearly and find her way out.

Alexander noticed her expression shift. His voice softened. “Sit. Rest. I’ll start a fire.”

He began gathering dry wood from the cave’s edges.
###Chapter 352

Isabella noticed Alexander gathering firewood but showed no concern as she retrieved her phone and began tapping on the screen.

Alexander made no move to stop her. He was certain this remote village had zero signal coverage. Nothing she attempted would transmit.

Trapped together in this cave, Isabella would have to endure the night with him until dawn. He would build a fire to provide warmth. He would dry her clothes, tend to her, watch over her. She would undoubtedly be touched by his care!

Soaked through, she would have to remove her wet garments for him to dry them. That was when things would inevitably progress.

By morning's light, Isabella would belong to him!

Isabella, however, seemed utterly indifferent to his presence. She leaned against the rough cave wall, her attention fully absorbed by her phone.

Across from her, Alexander maintained his devoted act, skillfully igniting a fire between them. He picked up his own suit jacket and began drying it near the flames. After a moment, he adopted a gentle tone. "You should wear this once it's dry. Why not try to get some rest first?"

"Rest? Where exactly?" Isabella retorted sharply.

Alexander frowned. She was being difficult. The cave floor was nothing but hard, uneven stone. No comfortable place to lie down.

But did her挑剔matter? The important thing was she was engaging with him. Progress!

Her continued quiet presence also suggested a willingness to stay here with him!

He doubled down on his performance, responding kindly, "I'll prepare a bed for you."

He had stashed some hay deeper inside the cave earlier, intentionally placing it out of immediate sight to seem more spontaneous. The image of Isabella lying on that hay sent a thrill of anticipation and raw desire through him.

They were completely alone here. He would have her.

Eagerly, he ventured further into the cave's depths to retrieve the hay. It took nearly an hour of meticulous effort to arrange a passable sleeping area.

"It's ready for you now," he announced.

The cave was growing colder. Sitting on the cold stone was tiresome. She would surely choose to lie down now!

However...

"You lie down if you want. I have no need for it," Isabella sneered, her voice dripping with disdain.

No need for it? What did she mean?

Before he could fully comprehend her words, a powerful, rhythmic thrumming sound echoed from above, followed by a blindingly bright searchlight piercing the darkness.

That sound...

Alexander stared in disbelief. He rushed to the cave entrance and looked up. A helicopter was descending from the night sky. Just as he feared, it was the distinct sound of rotor blades!

He whirled around to face Isabella, his expression dark. "You called them? How?"

"Not entirely stupid, are you?" A mocking smile curled her perfect lips as she brushed off her clothes. "I'm leaving now. Enjoy your night in the cave."

With that, she strode confidently toward the cave exit.

Alexander lunged forward, grabbing her arm tightly. "How did you contact them? When? There's no signal here! It's impossible!"

"Do you genuinely believe my phone lacks a signal booster?" she shot back, her tone laced with amusement.

While the village itself was a dead zone, Isabella had personally modified her device. It could latch onto a signal and connect to the outside world from virtually anywhere, even the deepest ancient forest!

She effortlessly shook off his grip and marched toward the waiting helicopter.

The aircraft hovered about two meters above the ground. Without hesitation, Isabella took a running leap. She sprang upward with agile grace, her hand catching the landing skid with precision. Using her formidable core strength, she swung her body up and into the open cabin door.

Her movements were fluid, efficient, and utterly controlled.

Alexander watched her retreating, arrogant figure, his eyes clouded with fury and humiliation. His fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

She had known she could leave this place the entire time. She had just sat there, calmly watching him gather wood, start the fire, dry his clothes, and painstakingly build that stupid bed?

Her composure wasn't born from a willingness to spend the night with him. She was simply biding her time, waiting for her ride out! "Isabella! How can you be so heartless?!"
###Chapter 353

“Cold-hearted?” Isabella’s scoff echoed inside the helicopter as she glared down at Alexander. “I suppose I am. But nothing compared to you. So artificial, yet you don’t even come close to that phony girlfriend of yours! You both plotted to trap me, to win my trust and seize my fortune, didn’t you? Ha! Keep dreaming!”

Her voice, sharp and icy, cut through the night air as the helicopter climbed higher.

Alexander flinched at her words. She had known his scheme all along?

How had she become so perceptive?

The timid, foolish girl who once trailed after him—how did she transform into this shrewd, cautious woman?

His fists clenched as he watched Isabella being carried away. Why was she so merciless? Couldn’t she see his feelings had turned genuine lately?

One day… He would make her love him. He swore it.

Frustrated, he kicked a loose rock in the cave. His eyes fell on the makeshift bed of hay he’d prepared. He had been so close. They could have bonded. But it was all wasted.

Damn it. He wanted her desperately.

Images of her lean, proud figure haunted him.

Inside the helicopter…

Maxwell handed Isabella a fresh set of clothes. “Ms. Montgomery, please change. Don’t catch a cold.”

“Alright.” She took the clothes and moved to the helicopter’s small restroom.

As she showered, her bathrobe reminded her of standing before Nathaniel wearing nothing but that. Right. Nathaniel. Oliver.

She had promised Oliver she would call once things settled. She hadn’t contacted them yet. She wondered how they were.

She finished quickly and stepped out. “Any word from Nathaniel?”

“Well…” Maxwell avoided her gaze. “Ms. Montgomery, are you certain about him? Shouldn’t you reconsider what those four men told you?”

“What’s to reconsider? William is a good man, but you can’t force attraction. He’ll remain a colleague.” She towel-dried her hair and sat.

Maxwell sat beside her, insistent. “But Nathaniel slept with another woman five years ago! He has a son! You’d be a stepmother if you married him!”

“Sounds perfect. I skip nine months of pregnancy and get a ready-made child! Every woman’s dream. You’ll never understand the agony of childbirth.” She leaned back lazily and reached for her phone.

Maxwell was speechless.

It was hopeless. She’d lost all reason! How could she twist facts and turn disadvantages into advantages? Would William adopt a child immediately if he heard this?

Isabella ignored him, switching on her phone to contact Nathaniel and Oliver. Her screen flooded with countless messages and missed calls.

Her Do Not Disturb mode had been activated somehow. All notifications were silenced, hidden.

She opened the chat. Her screen was bombarded.

[Mommy! Mommy! Where are you?]

[Mommy! Daddy and I are searching for you! Please reply!]

[Mommy, Mommy! Waaa! Do you hate Momo now? Don’t you like us anymore?]

[Momo misses you! What did I do wrong…? Did I upset you? Mommy, please don’t vanish.]

Isabella frowned. Had she accidentally enabled Do Not Disturb?
###Chapter 354

She hadn't reached out to Nathaniel or Oliver all day. They must be frantic by now.

She immediately dialed Nathaniel's number, but only heard the automated message: "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable."

Unavailable?

She tried Oliver's phone next. The same robotic voice answered.

That's when she knew something was wrong. She turned her sharp gaze toward Maxwell. "What did you do?"

"N-Nothing," stammered the nervous man, avoiding her piercing eyes.

"Nothing?" Isabella's voice turned icy. "I know Nathaniel better than anyone. Why can't I reach him? And why is my phone on Do Not Disturb?"

"Maybe... perhaps he wasn't trying to contact you? Could it be he doesn't care as much as you think? Or maybe you accidentally enabled Do Not Disturb yourself?"

"Really? Keep digging that hole!" She slammed her phone on the table and planted her hands on her hips, staring him down.

Her eyes held the sharpness of daggers, ready to slice through his lies.

Maxwell shuddered under her intense scrutiny. He jumped up abruptly. "I need to use the restroom."

"Africa seems like a lovely place for you. You'll be on a flight tomorrow," she stated with deceptively calm menace.

Terrified by the threat, Maxwell immediately sat back down and confessed. "Ms. Montgomery, please don't blame me! This was all Mr. Granger's plan!

"He wanted Nathaniel to believe you chose William over him. He made us erase all traces of your route with Alexander so Nathaniel would think you deliberately avoided him.

"Since Nathaniel and Oliver couldn't locate you, they've apparently stopped trying..."

Stopped trying?

That explained the unanswered calls!

Nathaniel must think she wanted to be with William. He might even believe she was reconciling with Alexander!

Knowing his possessive nature, who knew what wild conclusions he'd drawn?

She grabbed her phone, attempting to reactivate her location services.

"Won't work," Maxwell admitted. "Mr. Worthington had us monitoring Nathaniel and Oliver Blackwood closely. When we checked an hour ago, they'd gone completely off grid."

Off grid...

For the first time, Isabella felt genuine fury toward her team. How would she find them now?

What if Nathaniel hated her because of this? Just when she'd finally decided to be with him...

What if Oliver had another seizure?

Consumed by worry, she snapped, "This is ridiculous. I want everyone using every resource to locate them immediately! Otherwise, you'll all be mining diamonds in Africa starting tomorrow!"

"Right away! I'm on it!" The terrified man leaped from his seat and frantically worked on his laptop.

He absolutely couldn't go back to Africa.

Isabella seemed truly enraged. Her feelings for Nathaniel were clearly genuine...

Did that mean all hope was lost for William?

No, no! His primary concern should be self-preservation! He had to complete her task, and quickly!

Isabella wanted to search herself, but her phone's programs weren't sophisticated enough to track Nathaniel and Oliver. She demanded to be taken to Rosewood Manor immediately; only there could she access the high-performance computers that would amplify her search capabilities.

As she stepped from the helicopter, she delivered her final warning: "You have one hour!"

One hour!

Maxwell wanted to cry. How could he possibly find Nathaniel and Oliver when they were deliberately evading Isabella?

Though highly skilled, Nathaniel operated on another level entirely! Where should he even begin?
###Chapter 355

Isabella stepped into Rosewood Manor.

Maxwell immediately dialed Alistair’s number in a panic. “What should I do? Ms. Montgomery said she’ll exile me to Africa if I can’t locate Nathaniel and Oliver within an hour!”

“Then embrace your African destiny. Your sacrifice honors Isabella. How noble, Maxwell!” Alistair’s voice was oddly cheerful.

Maxwell’s face fell. “But she also threatened to abandon all her research projects if they aren’t found! She said she’d lose all motivation!”

Alistair gasped audibly.

Unthinkable!

“Find them immediately!” Alistair barked. “Mobilize every resource! Leave no stone unturned!”

Surely their extensive network could locate Nathaniel Blackwood.

Inside the manor…

Isabella rushed straight to the computer room.

Her mind raced with worry for Oliver. What if he suffered another seizure believing she abandoned him? He was just a child; he didn’t deserve that pain.

Knowing Nathaniel’s possessive nature, he might hide Oliver away if he truly thought she was unfaithful.

The Blackwoods owned countless properties. Finding them would require luck.

At that moment…

Her eyes landed on the second-floor living area.

Nathaniel sat elegantly on the sofa, wearing his signature tailored suit—sharp, expensive, impossibly handsome. Oliver slept peacefully with his head on Nathaniel’s lap, his small face serene and content.

The coffee table before them was laden with snacks, pizzas, cakes, and a glass of milk. Everything appeared meticulously prepared for her return.

Isabella’s breath hitched. “How… Why are you both here?”

“Disappointed to see us?” Nathaniel’s voice was calm, almost teasing.

“Of course not!” she protested quickly. “I’m just surprised. I thought you’d… leave. I thought you’d never want to see me again.”

“If the woman I loved betrayed me,” Nathaniel stated coolly, “I would eliminate her lover, not retreat. So, Ms. Montgomery, I’m afraid we’ve ruined someone’s elaborate scheme.” A faint, knowing smile touched his lips.

Isabella stared, stunned. He knew it was a setup? His perception was terrifying.

And did he just say he’d kill the other man if she cheated?

How brutally possessive.

She moved instinctively toward the sofa, sitting beside him. “Your extreme response is… notable. But how did you know I’d come here?”

“I’ve shared your space long enough,” Nathaniel replied smoothly, gently shifting Oliver to lean against a cushion. He handed her a slice of cake. “It would be pathetic if I didn’t understand your character by now.”

His movements were fluid and precise, radiating controlled elegance.

Isabella accepted the dessert, a smile tugging at her lips. “You seem very confident I have no interest in William or Alexander.”

“Naturally.”

She didn’t even fully accept him yet. Why would she fall for a bookish academic like William?

As for Alexander Whitmore? Nathaniel almost scoffed. He knew Isabella had better taste.

He admitted feeling furious earlier discovering she’d spent the day with Alexander while he and Oliver waited here. But after hours of fruitless searching, every trail went cold—a signature move of her elite team.

Then he remembered William Peterson, and the puzzle pieces clicked into place.

“Eat,” Nathaniel urged, his voice softening. “You must be hungry.”

A warm, unfamiliar sensation spread through Isabella’s chest. She’d vanished for an entire day, yet not only did Nathaniel not resent her, he had a feast waiting.
###Chapter 356

Isabella felt even more convinced about her choice.

She took a bite of her food. “What about the Special Warfare 919 Spy Camera?” she asked. “I want to go back soon and sleep with Christopher.”

Nathaniel’s eyes widened slightly. Did Isabella just say she wanted to return to his estate?

It seemed her feelings had shifted after everything that happened.

Noticing his silence, she eyed him suspiciously. “What? Is it not possible?”

“Everything is possible. I don’t even need to handle it. Let Vivienne watch all she wants. Christopher and I will stay here until my father’s birthday celebration,” Nathaniel stated calmly.

Isabella stared at him, shocked. “Live here?”

He nodded. “The most dangerous place is often the safest. I’m sure Ms. Montgomery understands that principle.”

It suddenly made sense to Isabella. Nathaniel had searched all over Westchester for her, but no one expected him to come to Rosewood Manor. She didn’t know how he managed it, but no one discovered his return. Not even her own people knew!

With Vivienne’s limited abilities, she would never guess Nathaniel planned to stay here with her.

“That’s a good plan,” Isabella agreed. “Let’s do it!”

Vivienne would undoubtedly hunt for them in the coming days, but Isabella would ensure she never succeeded. She would use every resource to make it happen.

Once the birthday celebration was over, Reginald Blackwood would stop pressuring Nathaniel to marry Vivienne.

Still, staying inside the manor for several days seemed challenging.

As if reading her thoughts, Nathaniel assured her, “Everything is arranged. We brought all the necessary supplies. Staying here for a month won’t be a problem.” Isabella glanced around and noticed men’s and children’s items scattered about.

Had Nathaniel planned to live with her for a while?

But looking at the snacks and food on her table, she decided to accept the situation.

She picked up a fork and ate the cake, sipping the milk he had prepared. Her movements were efficient and straightforward.

Nathaniel sat beside her, watching with gentle eyes.

After a few bites, Isabella remembered something important. Her four uncles mentioned someone had plotted against Nathaniel, that he was set up to sleep with a woman five years ago. They said Nathaniel had no leads on what happened or who was behind it.

She considered asking him for details to help, but hesitated, worried it might hurt his pride. He had kept it hidden from her, just as she kept things from him.

She understood how he felt. Besides, he was a man who had been violated…

She decided not to ask.

She finished her meal around two in the morning. “There are plenty of rooms here,” she said. “All brand new. Take your pick.”

Take his pick?

“Alright.”

Nathaniel carried Oliver in his arms and walked straight into Isabella’s bedroom.

She frowned and stepped forward to stop him. “This is my room. You can sleep in the one next door.”

Even though she had decided to accept him, many issues remained unresolved. They couldn’t sleep together all the time!

Besides, they only shared a bed to help Oliver’s condition, and the boy had improved significantly.

“Oliver cried a lot today,” Nathaniel reasoned. “He might have seizures tonight.”

That meant they had to share a bed again!

With that, he carried Oliver to her bed and laid him down.
###Chapter 357

Isabella was stunned by Nathaniel’s words.

That man always had an endless supply of excuses, and Christopher was constantly at the center of them!

Fine. Since it was for Oliver, she decided to let it go.

She moved to one side of the bed, making space for Oliver to sleep between them. Thankfully, Oliver was still sound asleep, completely unaware.

Nathaniel didn’t argue. He settled on the other side, next to Oliver. He switched off the lamp.

Moonlight streamed through the window, casting a soft glow. The room felt warm and peaceful.

Meanwhile, Alexander was furious.

He had even arranged for bats, hoping to play the hero and protect Isabella. Damn it, his plan had backfired completely!

To make matters worse, Vincent had been exposed. Isabella would definitely take action now.

Victoria rushed into the cave and grabbed Alexander’s hands. “Alexander, what do we do now?” she fretted. “I even gave up Vincent Moreau! I really wanted you two to be together. I can’t believe she’s so cold-hearted. She’s out there right now! What if she reports Vincent and then comes after me? I could end up in prison…”

“Then why did you do what you did five years ago if you were going to be this scared now?” Alexander snapped at her.

Five years ago, he had asked Isabella to meet him at The Grand Monarch, all so he could pressure her into asking Senior Theodore for the 15 percent family shares. Everything that happened afterward wasn’t part of his original plan, but he had to adapt.

Because of that mess, Isabella had hated him all these years!

Alexander had never yelled at Victoria before, but he had changed since Isabella returned to Westchester. He was different now…

Even though she was seething, Victoria lowered her head and pleaded for sympathy. “I’m sorry, Alexander. This is all my fault, it really is… Why don’t you just hand me and Vincent over? Send us to jail—maybe then she’ll forgive you…”

“I would have done that a long time ago if I could! Go home and rest. Lay low for the next few days. Don’t contact me.” Alexander took the umbrella from her and walked out into the rain.

Victoria watched him leave, her fists clenched tightly.

Did Alexander just tell her not to contact him? He was already pulling away!

Everyone in the Montgomery family had been giving her the cold shoulder since the failed wedding ceremony between Alexander and Isabella. Now Alexander was joining them!

Hah! What a family! What a bunch of hypocrites! Victoria had become a mere pawn, something everyone could discard!

It was ironic, considering how much they had once adored her.

This couldn’t go on. She had to regain her footing. Isabella would not bully her like this!

Victoria’s hand drifted to her stomach as a plan formed in her mind.

Soon… everything would unfold.

Her plan would work!

Vincent, who stood beside her, felt the cold aura she emitted and shuddered.

Only then did Victoria realize someone was next to her. She quickly masked her expression. “Any updates on what I asked you to check?” she asked.

Since Isadora had been imprisoned, Vincent was the only person she could trust.

Vincent replied, “I looked into Madam Whitmore. Her favorite thing is a skincare brand called Jules. Their products aren’t available to the public. Only the elite can get them. Wealthy socialites love this brand, but the producer only makes a hundred bottles per year. They go on sale on eBay at random times and sell out instantly. Madam Whitmore missed out this year. She’s very upset about it.”

Victoria frowned. She had heard of this brand; it launched three years ago. Rumor had it a genius developed the formulas in a lab. Coincidentally, Eleanor also adored this skincare line.

Victoria had tried to bid on a bottle for Eleanor to win her favor. She even attempted to buy the entire brand for her. But the seller only appeared on eBay. They never revealed their identity or responded to any messages.
###Chapter 358

Who would have guessed that Margaret Whitmore was also a devoted fan of the Jules skincare line?

Victoria Kensington’s eyes narrowed sharply.
“One more task,” she said coldly. “Get me the formulas for Jules. I don’t care what it takes.”

If customers were buying the products, all Victoria needed was one authentic Jules item.
She could have it analyzed in a lab, reverse-engineered, and reproduced.
Rex gave a firm nod. “Understood, Madam.”

After leaving the village, Alexander Whitmore summoned his assistant.
“From today onward, send fresh flowers and breakfast to Isabella Montgomery every morning.
And you are no longer authorized to manage my social media accounts.”

It had been Oliver sending those messages to Isabella all along.
No wonder she thought his efforts were hollow.
Isabella wasn’t the same woman she was five years ago.
She couldn’t be easily deceived anymore.
Alexander knew he had to step up his game.

Somehow, he found himself caring more about winning her back.
His mind was set on a single objective: he must reclaim her heart.

The next morning, the doorbell rang at Isabella’s home.

Nathaniel Blackwood woke instantly.
Seeing Isabella still asleep, he slipped quietly out of bed.
He descended the stairs and opened the front door.
No one was there—only a elegant box sat on the doorstep.
A purple card rested on top, bearing three words:

[Remorse. Regret. Redemption.]

Inside was a carefully prepared breakfast set.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. Alexander.

So he was finally making a real effort to pursue Isabella.

His gaze turned icy. “Deliver this to Victoria Kensington,” he instructed the bodyguards waiting in the shadows.

One of them hesitated. “Sir?”

Alexander had sent this for Isabella, but Nathaniel wanted it redirected to Victoria?
They felt Nathaniel’s intense stare and immediately complied, taking the box without another word.

As Nathaniel closed the door, he noticed Oliver Blackwood standing on the staircase, already awake.

Nathaniel frowned and spoke in a low voice. “This stays between us.”

“Don’t worry, Daddy! I won’t tell Mommy!” Oliver chirped, fully cooperative.
“This is the perfect way to deal with that jerk’s gifts!”

Sending a gift meant for Isabella directly to her rival?
It was downright hilarious.
He could only imagine how furious Victoria would be when she received it.
What would she even do with the breakfast?
And how would Alexander react when he found out?

An idea sparked in Oliver’s mind.
He hurried over to Nathaniel. “Daddy, look! We have to handle this too!”

He held up Isabella’s phone.
Alexander had already sent several messages:

[Isabella, whether you believe me or not, I truly regret everything.]

[No matter how deeply I hurt you five years ago, I will love you even more fiercely now.]

[Be with me. I will spend the rest of my life making it up to you.]

[I can help you put Rex Walker behind bars. But not Victoria.]

[I don’t love her anymore. But she grew up with us. She’s your sister, which makes her family to me too. I won’t harm her, but I won’t love her either.]

[Isabella, give me one last chance. No one will ever love you the way I do.]

Nathaniel’s eyes turned cold as he read.
With a few quick taps, he deleted all the unread messages.
Then he installed a stealth program on the device.

From now on, every message from Alexander would be automatically erased—without a trace.
Alexander would never know.
Isabella would never see them.

Oliver bounced with glee. “Daddy, you’re amazing! So clever!”

But Nathaniel’s gaze remained sharp and unsatisfied.
This was only the beginning.
###Chapter 359

Nathaniel pulled out his phone and dialed Dominic. “Whitmore Enterprises has been too quiet lately. Shake things up for them.”

“Right away, sir.”

At Whitmore Enterprises.

Alexander lounged in his executive chair, waiting for his phone to buzz. A smug grin was fixed on his face.

Isabella had been obsessed with him for years. She couldn't just fall out of love overnight. With a little effort, she would come crawling back.

Suddenly, Harrison burst into the office, breathless. “It’s a disaster, Mr. Whitmore! Several luxury brands just canceled their contracts. They said they’ll never work with us again!”

“What?” Alexander’s expression darkened instantly.

Whitmore Enterprises’ main revenue came from their high-end shopping plazas. These were playgrounds for the wealthy. If all the luxury brands pulled out, their stock would crash. The company would face ruin.

Harrison added nervously, “From what I’ve gathered, this was Boss Blackwood’s doing.”

Boss Blackwood?

Nathaniel Blackwood?

Alexander suddenly remembered Nathaniel’s warning at Rosewood Manor. His cold words echoed in his mind: “She’s mine. If you bother her again, I will erase the Whitmore name from Westchester.”

So Nathaniel was making good on his threat.

Was he not just toying with Isabella? How could a man of his stature genuinely fall for her? How could he attack the entire Whitmore family over a woman?

Several shareholders stormed into his office, voices raised in anger.

“Mr. Whitmore, what is the meaning of this? Why did they terminate the contracts?”

“Our stock already took a hit from your personal scandals. The losses were massive. We haven’t recovered. Who did you piss off now?”

“How can we trust you to lead? Are you trying to bankrupt Whitmore Enterprises?”

“I must have been a fool to support you as president!”

Their accusations grew more aggressive.

Alexander’s gaze turned icy. A dangerous aura radiated from him. “Get out.”

The shareholders flinched. Alexander had grown too powerful over the years.

But the fear of financial ruin emboldened them. “We demand a proper explanation!”

“This isn’t just about money! You need to fix this!”

“How can I solve anything with you causing a scene?” Alexander’s voice was low and threatening. “Perhaps one of you would like to be president?”

They recoiled. Become president? They couldn’t.

Though major shareholders, their role was to collect profits. Real power and problem-solving rested with Alexander.

No one could deny his capability.

At least, before everything went wrong.

One shareholder finally spoke. “Fine. We’ll give you time. You have two weeks to turn this around. We expect results.”

With that, they filed out of the office.

Once alone, Alexander’s hands clenched the armrests. The leather cracked under his grip. His aura was frigid.

Isabella…! Isabella Montgomery!

That timid girl had gained so much confidence just by sleeping with Nathaniel? She thought she could destroy him?

Did she truly believe Nathaniel cared for her?

Did she honestly think she had a future with a man like Nathaniel Blackwood?
###Chapter 360

Not a chance in hell.

He would never allow that to happen.

“Continue sending gifts to Rosewood Manor,” Alexander commanded Harrison. “And book me a flight to Paris immediately.”

Over the years, Alexander had cultivated numerous connections. Several luxury brands were eager to partner with Whitmore Enterprises. He simply needed to meet with their representatives.

Harrison hesitated briefly before speaking cautiously. “The gifts we sent this morning were redirected by Mr. Blackwood to Ms. Kensington. She’s extremely upset.”

His tone became noticeably protective when mentioning Victoria.

Alexander’s expression darkened instantly. Nathaniel intercepted his gifts for Isabella and gave them to Victoria instead?

Damn it. This was infuriating.

He never intended to sever ties completely with Victoria. They shared history and mutual affection. Moreover, Victoria possessed certain...compromising evidence about their past dealings.

This situation forced him to comfort her again.

Why did Nathaniel have to interfere?

Alexander massaged his temples in frustration. After a moment’s thought, he issued new instructions. “Keep sending the gifts. Ensure they’re delivered when Nathaniel isn’t present!”

He was determined to make Isabella accept his presents.

As for Nathaniel...avoiding direct confrontation should suffice.

Yet, despite his efforts, the gifts never reached Isabella for days. Every single one ended up with Victoria.

He hadn’t received any response from Isabella despite countless messages!

What more could Alexander do?

He only had two weeks to win Isabella’s favor. He needed her help to mitigate the severe damage to Whitmore Enterprises.

At Montgomery Manor.

Victoria was seething with rage. The堆积如山的gifts filled the room, twisting her features into an ugly mask of fury.

A package with a lavender envelope arrived daily. The gifts varied: diamond necklaces, designer handbags, exquisite handmade artifacts!

Julian had never been this generous with her before! Even during their youthful romance, everything was clandestine. She constantly hid their relationship from everyone.

They only went public after Isabella was exiled to Africa. By then, their dynamic was set. She always pandered to him, cared for him. He only gave her gifts on special occasions.

Why was he so extravagantly generous with Isabella?!

Victoria felt sick with insecurity, anxiety, and burning anger!

She once believed she held Julian’s heart completely. Now, it seemed she had failed.

His heart had changed. utterly.

Eyes blazing with hatred, Victoria stood up abruptly and marched out.

Penelope asked, “Victoria, where are you going?” “I haven’t seen Alexander for a while. He must miss me.” Victoria checked her reflection in the hallway mirror, smoothing her hair. “Prepare the car,” she ordered Penelope. “Take me to Whitmore Enterprises.”

At Whitmore Enterprises…

Alexander was still strategizing how to win Isabella back when Harrison rushed into his office. “Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Vivienne Delacroix is here to see you.”

Vivienne?

Alexander frowned. She was renowned as the ‘genius entrepreneur’. He had only seen her from a distance at an international conference once or twice.

Why was she visiting Whitmore Enterprises?

As he pondered, Vivienne entered his office.

She wore an elegant beige lace dress. She exuded a refined, exquisite aura unlike Victoria or even Isabella!

It was an innate sophistication, bred from generations of high society. The ultimate dignity cultivated only within the highest echelons.

Harrison knew his place and quickly exited, closing the door behind him.

Vivienne approached his desk silently. She placed a small pill bottle on the polished wood and slid it toward him.

Alexander eyed the bottle suspiciously. “What is this…”

“This pill will help you win Isabella’s heart. It’s one of a kind.” Vivienne’s voice was calm yet calculating.
###Chapter 361

Alexander’s gaze sharpened at Vivienne’s proposition.
Could she truly deliver what he desired?

Was that substance… some kind of love potion?

As if reading his thoughts, Vivienne clarified, “This isn’t just any ordinary aphrodisiac. I spent a decade perfecting this pill. She doesn’t even need to swallow it—skin contact is enough. Then you can have your way with her.”

Alexander stared at Vivienne, both impressed and unnerved.
What a ruthless innovator. She actually invented this.

Still…

“Why help me?”

“You don’t need to know. Nathaniel will be at the Blackwood Estate in ten days. That’s your only window.”

Vivienne rose gracefully, her crystal heels clicking as she exited the office.

Alexander’s focus remained fixed on the pill bottle, his mind racing.
Ten days?

Outside, Victoria hid behind a large potted plant, holding her breath.
Once certain Vivienne hadn’t spotted her, she relaxed slightly and gestured to Harrison beside her. “You. Go talk to Alexander.”

“Yes, Madam.” Harrison understood and entered the office.

He noticed the pill bottle in Alexander’s hand and frowned. “Mr. Whitmore, what is—”

“Clear my schedule for the next ten days,” Alexander ordered.

Harrison grew more concerned. “So you’ve decided to pursue Ms. Montgomery? What about Victoria? If she finds out, she’ll be devastated…”

“She’s reasonable. She’ll understand,” Alexander replied coolly.

Victoria, eavesdropping outside, clenched her fists until her knuckles turned white.
Was she doomed to remain his secret mistress forever? Forced to watch him chase another woman, all because she was ‘reasonable’?

Even Harrison felt a pang of sympathy. A woman of Victoria’s caliber deserved better.

Summoning his courage, Harrison pressed further. “What… what happens after? Even if you succeed with Ms. Montgomery, she’s not easily manipulated. Divorcing her later could be complicated. Securing her assets won’t be simple…”

Alexander’s eyes narrowed. Divorce?
The word left a bitter taste in his mouth.

Isabella was powerful, resourceful, incredibly wealthy. Why would he ever divorce her?

“Harrison, you’re overstepping.”

“My apologies.” Harrison bowed his head and turned to leave.
But after a few steps, he couldn’t help asking, “If you don’t divorce Ms. Montgomery, what becomes of Victoria? What kind of life will she have?”

Victoria held her breath, waiting for his answer.
They had been together for years. Surely he cared about her future?

After a tense silence, Alexander finally replied, “I’ll ensure she’s financially secure.”

Financially secure…
Ha! ‘Financially secure’?
That meant he had no intention of marrying her.

Victoria’s heart shattered. Tears streamed down her cheeks uncontrollably.
She had devoted years to Alexander, supported him wholeheartedly, helped him build Whitmore Enterprises. And her reward? ‘Financial security’?

Alexander once promised to love her forever.
Then it became ‘I won’t let you down’.
Now it was ‘financial security’.

Ha… ha… ha…

Harrison asked nothing more. He left the office, closing the door quietly behind him.

Victoria remained hidden behind the plant, sobbing silently.

Moved by her distress, Harrison instinctively reached to wipe her tears.
But Victoria stepped back, composing herself instantly. “Harrison, know your place.”
Her tone was cold, defensive, leaving no room for pity.
###Chapter 362

Victoria wiped the tears from her face, restoring her usual elegant composure. She walked to the office door and knocked firmly.

Harrison watched her retreating back, awkwardly withdrawing his outstretched hand.

Of course. He was just an assistant. What right did he have to comfort her?

Inside the office, Alexander heard the knocking and immediately concealed the pill.

"Enter."

Victoria pushed the door open and stepped inside, her expression now composed with a faint smile. "Hello, Alexander. It's been too long. I brought you those cakes you like."

She walked to his desk and placed an elegant container filled with exquisite pastries from a renowned patissier. These were limited edition creations she had queued hours to obtain.

Alexander glanced at the desserts without expression. "You shouldn't be out right now. The paparazzi are everywhere."

"I missed you," she murmured, moving to sit on his lap. She wrapped her arms around his neck. "I'm so tired of all this. Why don't we stop scheming against Isabella? Let's get married, start a family, live simply. I'll transfer all my Montgomery assets and shares to you. I'll support you completely as your devoted wife."

Her voice was soft and pleading.

Yet Alexander found her offer insulting.

Her pitiful portion of Montgomery shares? What use were those to him?

His hands settled on her waist. "Victoria, you're not thinking clearly. Why rush? Let's wait until you control at least fifty percent of the shares."

Fifty percent?

That would require taking shares from Isabella and her parents! Impossible in her current disgrace.

He was making excuses to delay.

Her expression turned mournful as she searched his eyes. "Alexander, I don't want any of that anymore. I'm exhausted. I just want you. Let's abandon these plans against the Montgomerys and Isabella, please?"

Noticing her unusual behavior, Alexander pushed her away and patted her head. "You're not yourself today. I have urgent matters to handle. Go home and rest. We'll discuss this when you're feeling better."

Victoria pressed her lips together but finally stood after a long silence. She paused at the door. "Alexander...do you still love me?"

Love her?

Love?

Alexander's hand stilled on the document he'd picked up. After a prolonged pause, he replied, "Victoria, haven't I always promised I'd never let you down?"

He'd give her anything except marriage—money, status, even his body.

That constituted not letting her down.

She smiled faintly. "I understand now. Forgive my childishness. I'll let you work. I'll visit again soon."

Her voice remained gentle, her smile bright and innocent. But the moment she left Whitmore Enterprises and entered her car, her eyes turned icy and dark.

Alexander wanted to marry Isabella! He wanted to remain married to her forever!

Was he discarding Victoria now that she'd become useless?

First the Montgomerys treated her coldly, and now Alexander? After everything she'd done?

All because she wasn't born a Montgomery? Because she'd fabricated her identity?

No. Absolutely not.

Her fingers tightened around the recording device in her bag—disguised as a lipstick, utterly ordinary yet technologically advanced.

She had captured their entire conversation. 'You'll regret this, Alexander. You'll regret everything!'
###Chapter 363

At Rosewood Manor

Isabella spent the summer with Oliver, studying checker manuals and architectural blueprints. She remained vigilant against Vivienne and Alexander's schemes, yet no trouble came.

Time flew, and the day of Reginald Blackwood's birthday celebration arrived.

Isabella woke to an empty bedroom that morning. Frowning, she headed downstairs.

In the living room, she spotted Nathaniel and Christopher by the door speaking with Dominic. Dominic departed with a violet box in hand.

She frowned. "What's going on?"

"Nothing, nothing!" Oliver shook his head vigorously.

To appear less suspicious, Oliver dashed to Isabella and tugged her hand to distract her. "Mommy, I'm going to Grandpa's party with Daddy today! You have to be good, okay?"

Nathaniel approached. "Breakfast is in the microwave. Don't forget to eat."

"You're taking Christopher?" Isabella blurted.

Nathaniel nodded.

Oliver was part of the Blackwood family, and Nathaniel never shied from rumors. He would stand by Oliver anywhere.

Isabella pressed, "But your parents dislike Christopher. The rest of the family does too. If he goes with you, they'll mock him."

Nathaniel looked at Oliver. "He's a man."

Three words, clear and firm. As his son, Oliver needed to face such challenges young.

Oliver reassured Isabella, "Don't worry about me, Mommy. I'll be fine. I'll grow strong and protect you with Daddy!"

His small voice held determination, tugging at Isabella's heartstrings. Why should an innocent child like Oliver face the Blackwoods' judgment?

She scooped Oliver into her arms, speaking with maturity. "Christopher is only five. Still a little boy. He shouldn't endure that. I'm here now, and you're here. He never has to grow up!"

Nathaniel frowned. Isabella would be here? Oliver never had to grow up?

That meant...

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed, a soft gleam of affection sparkling within. His gaze softened as he looked at Isabella. "Oh, Isabella, look at you. Being an overprotective parent."

He intentionally emphasized the last two words.

Isabella jolted at his suggestive tone. Right! Since when had she started caring so much about Oliver?

She was always logical and principled, scolding spoiled children. But with Oliver in her arms, she only thought: Even if he destroyed the world, she would protect and help him!

She tightened her hold on Oliver. "I don't mind. I love spoiling him! He's only five. A child shouldn't bear an adult's burdens! You go alone. I'll take care of him today."

Isabella left no room for argument, carrying Oliver toward the kitchen.

In her arms, Oliver made a face at Nathaniel—his chubby arms hooked around her neck—and chirped, "Yay! Mommy loves me! Christopher loves Mommy!"

Nathaniel realized when Oliver said that word—love.

That mischievous boy was getting in the way!

Meanwhile, at Bayview Apartment...

Alexander stood before a full-length mirror, elegantly fastening his collar button. Harrison entered to report. "Mr. Whitmore, Nathaniel has left the Blackwood Estate. Ms. Vivienne reminds you to seize this opportunity."

"Alright." Alexander picked up his suit jacket, draping it over his arm.

He checked his reflection, adjusting his tie with a sophisticated air. Satisfied, he headed out. Suddenly, Victoria rushed in anxiously.
###Chapter 364

“Alexander, I need to speak with you!”

“Not now, I’m occupied.” Alexander continued walking without pause, unwilling to waste this perfect chance.

Victoria clutched his arm desperately. “Alexander, I’m pregnant.”

Pregnant.

He froze instantly, body tensing at her words. He always used protection—except once, about a month ago…

Harrison’s expression darkened.

Victoria met his gaze pleadingly. “Alexander, the baby is thirty-five days old. Let’s get married, please? I’ll raise our child, and we can build a happy life together. I’ll support you with the family, and together we’ll expand the Whitmore empire beyond imagination!”

Alexander studied her. Marriage? A child?

For a moment, his heart softened… until Isabella’s face flashed in his mind.

Today was his only shot!

There was only one pill like this in existence!

He had to sleep with Isabella to make Nathaniel despise her. Only then would she return to him!

Winning Isabella back would solve all of Whitmore Enterprises’ problems and bring unlimited resources.

Alexander was certain Nathaniel would never want a woman who had been with another man twice. Plus, as McKenzie had promised, the pill would induce hallucinations and make Isabella initiate everything.

Even if she tried to press charges, there would be no evidence. The pill was undetectable!

After a brief pause, Alexander patted Victoria’s shoulder. “Victoria, I’d love to have a child with you, but the timing isn’t right.”

Not the right timing…

“W-What did you say?” Victoria’s voice trembled.

“Terminate it,” Alexander stated coldly. “Focus on your health. We can try again later.” He turned to Harrison. “Take her to the hospital. Ensure she’s well cared for.”

“Yes, sir,” Harrison replied, masking the pain in his voice.

Abortion? Mr. Whitmore was utterly heartless…

Tears streamed down Victoria’s cheeks as she watched him leave. “Alexander, please reconsider… Doesn’t our baby deserve a chance?”

Her cries were filled with agony and despair.

Alexander halted briefly. “I’ll compensate you once everything is settled, Victoria.”

With that, he walked away, colder than ever.

Victoria stumbled backward and collapsed to the floor. She had lost. Completely.

She thought the baby would win him back, but he chose to pursue Isabella instead.

All he ever thought about was Isabella!

What made her so special? What?!

Was she more beautiful? Richer? More seductive?

Enraged, Victoria swung her arm, smashing a nearby vase to pieces.

Crash!

“Ms. Kensington!”

Harrison knelt to help her up, but she shoved him away and stood on her own. Her eyes burned with hatred and resolve.

‘So, Alexander Whitmore, you think you can discard me and win Isabella?

Never! You belong to me! Only me!’
###Chapter 365

Victoria stepped out of Bayview Apartments.

Harrison trailed behind her persistently.

"Stop following me," she snapped coldly. "If you truly want to help, just leave me alone."

She slid into her car and instructed the driver. "Take me to Kaiser Hospital."

Kaiser Hospital was Westchester's most exclusive private women's clinic.

Harrison watched her car disappear down the street. Anguish twisted his features.

The child... Could it be his?

But what could he possibly do? He was merely an assistant. Powerless. Useless.

Inside the car, Victoria examined the recording device in her palm. A vicious, triumphant smile curled her lips.

She picked up her phone and sent a text to Eleanor.

Mother, I'm terrified. My heart is shattered. But I have no other choice. I will fight to survive this.

Next, she texted Margaret Whitmore.

Aunt Margaret, I longed to join your family. I dreamed of keeping this baby. But... I'm so sorry.

She powered off her phone immediately after sending the messages.

At Montgomery Manor...

Eleanor was reviewing documents when the message arrived. She shot up from her chair, panic seizing her. She frantically called Victoria's number.

A robotic voice answered. "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable."

"Richard!" she screamed, her voice trembling. "Richard! Get in here! Send someone to find Victoria! Now!"

At the same time, Margaret Whitmore received her message. While she had never particularly liked the girl, Victoria had gifted her a Jules skincare set just days prior. Margaret had failed to acquire the sold-out product herself. Victoria's thoughtful gift had impressed her friends, elevating Victoria in Margaret's eyes.

Concerned by the ominous text, Margaret immediately ordered an investigation.

Within three minutes, both women received identical reports.

Ms. Kensington is pregnant with a male heir. Alexander Whitmore is forcing her to terminate the pregnancy. She suffers from a coagulopathy. The procedure could be fatal...

The news was a thunderbolt from a clear sky.

Eleanor swayed, her legs buckling beneath her.

Richard caught her, his voice urgent. "Get the car! We're going to the hospital! Now! Contact the Whitmores! Tell them to meet us there!"

Theodore Montgomery was incensed. "What is Alexander thinking? Bring him to me! He will explain this outrage! We will not let this stand!"

Though Victoria often disappointed him, she was still his granddaughter. His own blood. How dare Alexander treat her this way?

The entire Montgomery family erupted in fury.

At the Whitmore estate...

Alexander's parents were equally stunned. Victoria was carrying a Whitmore heir! A boy!

How could this pregnancy be terminated? The Whitmores were already on shaky ground with the Montgomerys. If Victoria, with her blood disorder, died during the procedure... The consequences would be catastrophic for their family!

Victor Whitmore's eyes blazed with fury. He glared at his assistant. "Find that disgraceful son of mine! Drag him back here! Immediately!"

Alexander was currently speeding toward Rosewood Manor, determination hardening his resolve. He would have Isabella Montgomery tonight. She would finally be his.

He had waited an eternity for this moment. Even though Anthony had already tainted her, Alexander still craved her. He wanted her body. He wanted her vast fortune.

Suddenly, several black sedans screeched in front of his car, cutting him off. Alexander slammed on the brakes, his frown deepening.

Doors flew open. Bodyguards emerged. Their leader was the Whitmore family's head of security, Theodore Winslow. Theodore marched to Alexander's window.
###Chapter 366

“Mr. Whitmore, Senior Whitmore and Madam Whitmore require your immediate presence at Grace Memorial Hospital.”

“Hospital? Why?” Alexander’s brow furrowed.

Theodore responded, “Victoria underwent surgery and nearly bled out. The Montgomery family is causing a scene and demanding answers from you.”

Alexander’s temple throbbed. Nearly bled out?

The Montgomerys and the Whitmores knew?

How?

How was this possible?!

Today was his only window of opportunity! Once Nathaniel returned to Isabella, everything would be ruined! It was a twenty-minute drive to Rosewood Manor… just twenty minutes away! He told Theodore, “I’ll be there in three hours. Have them calm down first—I’ll provide a full explanation later.”

“Apologies, Sir, but Senior Whitmore insists you come immediately. The Montgomery family has already begun contacting reporters and lawyers!”

If Alexander refused to go to the hospital, the Montgomerys would go public and file charges against him!

Damn it!

Alexander slammed his fist against the steering wheel in fury.

At Rosewood Manor…

Isabella was playing a video game with Christopher. He controlled a rabbit-like character that hopped around, following her avatar. Whenever an enemy attacked, he would jump in front of her to defend.

A warm smile touched Isabella’s lips. Even in a game, she felt protected.

Mid-game, her phone rang. She dismissed the call and continued playing.

It rang again almost immediately. She answered, balancing the phone between her shoulder and chin while her fingers flew across the controller.

Theodore Montgomery’s voice came through. “Isabella, are you available? Come to Grace Memorial Hospital right away. Victoria’s condition is critical.”

“What? What happened?” Isabella asked.

She’d had almost no contact with Victoria since the wedding. The Montgomery family hadn’t pushed for any meetings either.

Theodore sighed heavily. “She was pregnant with Alexander’s child. He forced her to terminate it. We need you here.”

Theodore respected Isabella’s decisions. Regardless of the outcome, they would make Alexander explain. Since Isabella had nearly married him, she deserved to know the truth.

Isabella’s frown deepened. So it had finally happened. She had been waiting for this day.

“Alright,” she replied. “I’ll be there within thirty minutes.”

The game ended just as she hung up. She walked over to Christopher. “Momo, can you stay home for a little while? Mommy will ask a very special friend to come play with you. I’ll be back in two hours!”

“Momo wants to go with Mommy!” Christopher jumped off the sofa, his small face set with determination.

Isabella ruffled his hair. “Momo, listen. My friend can jump off roofs and walk on walls. He can teach you!”

“Jump off roofs? Walk on walls? Really?” Christopher’s eyes widened with excitement.

Isabella nodded and called Maxwell.

Maxwell arrived at the house quickly. “Play some climbing games with Momo,” Isabella instructed. “And take excellent care of him.”

Rock climbing games? Child’s play! Why would a top-tier agent be doing this?

“Make sure Momo has fun,” Isabella stated firmly. “Or I’ll have you transferred to the Africa division.”

“Fine! Alright!” Maxwell agreed instantly.

Isabella handed Christopher over to Maxwell and left the manor.

Just as she had anticipated. Victoria had finally made her move. Perfect. The show was about to begin.
###Chapter 367

At Grace Memorial Hospital...

Victoria Kensington lay pale and fragile on the sterile hospital bed. A heartbreaking sight. "Just let them proceed with the surgery," she whispered weakly to everyone gathered in the room. "I'll pull through. I'll survive. I refuse to be a burden to Alexander..."

"Don't speak such nonsense, Victoria!" Eleanor Kensington clutched her daughter's hand, her voice trembling. "Burden? Alexander must take responsibility for you! We'll ensure he gives you a proper explanation."

Nearby, Benjamin Kensington snarled at Victor Whitmore. "Where is Alexander? Does he have no honor? A grown man acting with zero accountability!"

"Mr. Kensington, please remain calm. He will apologize to Victoria," Victor pledged.

Though they favored Isabella Montgomery, Victoria carried a child—a son. How could they allow her to terminate the pregnancy?

Alexander Whitmore entered the ward at that moment.

The instant he crossed the threshold, Benjamin's fist connected hard with his jaw.

"Alexander! You coward! How could you do this to my sister?!" He lunged again, but the Whitmore family bodyguards swiftly restrained him.

The Kensingtons made no move to intervene.

Protected by his security, Alexander wiped the blood from his lip with his thumb. Fury burned in his eyes.

Victoria knew that look. She recognized his rage. "Benjamin, stop! It's not his fault! It's mine! All mine... Alexander had already ended things. He was set to marry Isabella. I approached him at their wedding. I brought this shame upon myself..."

"Stop defending him, Victoria! He strung you along for five years! He did this to you, and you still shield him?" Eleanor cried out, torn between pain and anger.

Tears streamed down Victoria's cheeks. "Please don't make this worse. If Alexander doesn't want me, let me end this. Let me have the surgery and disappear from his life. I'll be fine. I'll survive..."

Her voice broke into desperate sobs. "Doctor! Where is the doctor?! I'm ready for the procedure...! I don't want this child! I don't want it!"

Her raw, agonizing wails shattered the hearts of everyone present.

Margaret Whitmore finally stepped forward. "Victoria, you have a bleeding disorder. The surgery could kill you! Don't be reckless... We will support you!"

She then turned a sharp gaze to Alexander. "What are you waiting for? Apologize to her right now. Propose!"

A bodyguard immediately handed Alexander a velvet box. Inside was the heirloom diamond ring from his engagement to Isabella—passed down for generations. How many times had he imagined slipping this very ring onto Victoria's finger? But now...

Putting it on her meant losing Isabella forever. Isabella would never take him back.

What choice did he have?

His hesitation was not lost on Victoria. It crushed her. She was dying. Both families were pressuring him to marry her. Yet he still hesitated? When had she become so insignificant to him?

Tears of heartache glistened in her eyes. "Alexander, I meant what I said. I'll be mature. I won't force you. I won't be your burden."

With a sudden, violent movement, she clenched her fist and struck her own abdomen.

"Victoria!" Eleanor screamed, rushing to stop her.

"Let me go, Mother! I beg you! I'll be fine—I don't want this baby! I don't want it...! I don't!"
###Chapter 368

Victoria screamed in agony, her fists pounding relentlessly against her own stomach. Despair and sorrow consumed her completely.

Alexander watched her breakdown, his resolve finally crumbling. "Victoria, stop this!" His voice was sharp and commanding. "Get ahold of yourself!"

Even as he tried to calm her, Alexander made no move to take the ring she had offered.

"Enough!"

Theodore Montgomery had remained silent until now. He suddenly slammed his walking cane hard against the hospital floor.

The loud crack echoed ominously through the private ward. Everyone froze. Even Victoria's violent assault on her own body ceased.

Theodore declared, "Victoria will have this baby. The Montgomery family will raise it. Effective immediately, all business contracts with the Whitmore family are terminated. This is your final warning, Alexander... Your reputation will be destroyed!"

Theodore's words left no room for negotiation. The engagement was off. The alliance between their families was over.

Victor Whitmore paled. Their families had been business partners for generations. While their resources were comparable, Theodore's influence was immense.

Especially since the wedding day when Nathaniel Blackwood had publicly supported them. Now with Isabella on their side, how could the Whitmores afford to anger the Montgomerys?

He stepped toward Theodore. "Mr. Montgomery, please reconsider. This should be a happy occasion. Let's not make hasty decisions. Alexander, come here! Explain yourself!"

"Save your breath. I'm not blind! My granddaughter does not need to beg your son to marry her!" Theodore scoffed. He turned to Victoria. "No matter what mistakes you've made, remember you are a Montgomery. We do not grovel. If Alexander doesn't love you, you won't marry him! Even pregnant, I will find you a better husband!"

Forcing a marriage now would make them look desperate and pathetic.

Theodore despised weakness. He could see Alexander's reluctance clearly. Victoria was no match for him.

Despite his disappointment in Victoria, she was still his granddaughter. He would not allow her to be humiliated this way.

Victoria felt utterly hopeless. Who else could she marry besides Alexander? He was the most successful man in all of Westchester—except for the Blackwood men, of course.

But the Blackwoods were untouchable. Isabella had already ensnared Nathaniel. Victoria held no illusions about winning him over.

Her grandfather claimed to protect her, but he was being utterly thoughtless. His decision would ruin her completely!

Still, Victoria forced herself to say, "Grandfather, I'll obey you. But must we become enemies? I was a willing participant. We can't blame Alexander or the Whitmore family entirely. Business and personal matters should remain separate."

Her words sounded incredibly gracious. The Whitmores looked at her with newfound respect.

They hadn't expected such maturity from Victoria, even in this situation. She was proving to be a remarkable woman.

Margaret Whitmore moved to her son's side. "Alexander, did you hear that? Victoria is still defending you! What is wrong with you? Why are you still hesitating?"

Alexander's gaze settled on Victoria. She appeared so fragile and pitiful. Truthfully, she had never intentionally harmed him.

In fact, she had always stood by him, protecting him.

Yet, his feelings for her had fundamentally shifted. He no longer desired to marry her, to love her... Perhaps...
###Chapter 369

Alexander’s eyes narrowed as he stepped closer. “Senior Theodore, you misunderstand. It’s not that I don’t love Victoria. I was simply overwhelmed and didn’t know how to respond. But my mind is made up now. Victoria and I will be engaged in three days. I won’t fail her.” His voice was firm, carrying a polished gravity.

Victoria’s gaze flickered at his words. An engagement. Not a marriage.

That was his promise.

She was already one month pregnant, and all he offered was an engagement? Victoria knew Alexander too well. This was just a tactic to placate everyone in the room. Once the pressure eased, he would find a way to back out.

Alexander… Oh, Alexander!

“Do you take us for fools, Alexander?” Senior Theodore scoffed. “Victoria is pregnant, and you’re talking about an engagement? Do you want everyone to think she’s being forced into this?”

“Our Victoria isn’t some toy for you to play with and discard!” Eleanor insisted. “If you truly love her, the wedding must happen immediately!”

Alexander frowned. If he married Victoria, any chance with Isabella would vanish.

He needed to buy time. Calmly, he explained, “Of course. Precisely because I love Victoria, I want to plan every detail carefully. I intend to give her the most perfect wedding. Victoria, what do you think?”

His gentle eyes settled on her.

Victoria smiled bitterly. Love? What a convenient excuse!

Despite her resentment, she couldn’t expose him. She couldn’t let Alexander feel coerced. That would ruin her next move.

“Mother, Grandpa,” Victoria said weakly, “I’m exhausted. I don’t want to pressure Alexander. It’s fine if he doesn’t want to get engaged.”

“Don’t be ridiculous! Alexander said he would, and he will! I’ll handle everything and invite all of Westchester! It will be spectacular!” Margaret declared.

All of Westchester? That would be a massive event.

Alexander’s expression shifted. He had hoped for something low-key. Inviting the entire city…

Senior Theodore glared at him. “Your face says it all, Alexander. Do you want this engagement? With all of Westchester invited?”

His tone was heavy with authority.

Alexander knew better than to act impulsively. As for Isabella… He would find a way later.

“Yes,” Alexander replied.

Senior Theodore’s expression softened slightly. “Good. Make it grand!”

A faint smile touched Victoria’s lips. It wasn’t a marriage, but with all of Westchester watching, it might as well be. She would be announced as Alexander’s official fiancée!

“No! They can’t get engaged!” A sharp, clear voice cut through the room.

Everyone turned to see Isabella walking into the ward.

Victoria clenched her fists. Why was Isabella here? To ruin things again?!

Alexander’s eyes lit up. Isabella came… She actually came!

Did she finally have feelings for him? Enough to object to his engagement?

Worried that Isabella would stop the engagement, Eleanor quickly said, “Isabella, you’re just in time. Your sister is pregnant with Alexander’s child. They must get engaged and be together.”

What she really meant was: the engagement must proceed. Isabella should not interfere.

Benjamin glared at her and snapped, “I don’t care about your feelings for Alexander. Victoria is pregnant. They belong together. You need to accept that.”
###Chapter 370

“Exactly, Isabella. You’ve lost your opportunity with Alexander. You didn’t act during the ceremony—now it’s far too late to reclaim him,” Margaret Whitmore sneered.

Isabella only laughed softly. “Who told you I came to take him back?”

“Then why are you here?” Margaret demanded, her expression puzzled.

In silence, Isabella’s eyes shifted toward Victoria.

Victoria’s heart dropped. That gaze was icy and penetrating, like a surgeon’s blade poised to slice her open.

She felt a surge of guilt. What did Isabella know? Could she possibly be aware the baby wasn’t…

Would Isabella expose her?

Just as panic began to churn in Victoria’s stomach, Isabella’s attention suddenly turned to Alexander.

Alexander met her eyes. This was not the timid girl from five years ago. Her stare was fierce and commanding.

It stirred in him a raw desire to dominate her, to claim her. But he knew Victoria carried his child…

As Alexander opened his mouth to speak, Isabella looked toward Theodore Montgomery. “Grandfather, Victoria is pregnant. What’s the purpose of a grand engagement? Her belly will only swell in the coming months. People will assume Alexander was coerced into this. An engagement is pointless—a waste. They should marry immediately.”

What?

A wedding? Now?

Everyone stared, certain they had misheard.

Isabella Montgomery, Alexander’s former lover, was advocating for a swift marriage instead of sabotaging it?

Victoria was equally stunned. What game was Isabella playing?

Isabella continued calmly, “Even if we want a spectacular event, we must arrange the wedding as soon as possible. Today, Alexander pressures Victoria to abort. Who’s to say he won’t push her down the stairs tomorrow? Have you forgotten what he did to me five years ago? If he truly cherished this child, he would never have suggested termination.”

Her words were measured, yet they sent a chill through the Montgomery family. She had a point.

If Alexander truly loved Victoria, why would he do such a thing? He had seemed reluctant to even visit!

Theodore Montgomery made the final decision. “I don’t care about the details. The wedding will take place in three days. That is final.”

Alexander’s fists clenched tightly. A wedding in three days?

Did Isabella truly wish to see him marry another woman? Was she genuinely ensuring he was bound to another in just seventy-two hours?

“Three days is too rushed,” Alexander interjected quickly. “I doubt I can arrange a proper ceremony—”

“Don’t worry. My associate is highly skilled at event planning. They could organize it by tomorrow,” Isabella cut him off.

Alexander’s face darkened. She was forcing his hand.

Unexpectedly, Margaret Whitmore agreed. “Fine. The wedding will be in three days.”

Since Victoria was already carrying Alexander’s child, marriage was inevitable. Why delay and invite more scandal?

Margaret instructed Alexander, “Begin preparations immediately. Select an auspicious time to take Victoria dress shopping.”

Alexander seethed, but under the circumstances, he had no choice.

“Understood.”

He shot a furious glare at Isabella and turned to leave.

Victoria watched Isabella, her brow furrowed. Why would she help her? Why show such kindness?

It made no sense. Isabella was scheming—Victoria felt it in her bones.
###Chapter 371

The moment Alexander left, Margaret Whitmore finally spoke. “Alright then. Should we begin the wedding preparations immediately? I hope Victoria can get some proper rest now.”

“Of course.” Eleanor Kensington gave her daughter’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “You’ll stay right here, Victoria. I’ll handle everything. Don’t you worry about a thing.”

“Okay,” Victoria replied with a compliant nod.

It had all worked out in the end. As long as she married Alexander, her future was secure.

Most of the people in the hospital room filed out to start organizing the wedding. Uninterested, Isabella Montgomery turned to Theodore Montgomery. “If there’s nothing else requiring my presence, Grandfather, I’ll be heading home.”

“Thank you for your assistance today, Isabella. Your sister is in your debt. I’ll put you in charge of the real estate development project next year,” Senior Montgomery stated.

He felt a pang of sympathy for Isabella. She had spent eighteen years with Alexander, only to have her own wedding destroyed. Now she had to watch her sister marry him.

It must be agonizing. No project, no matter how profitable, could truly compensate for that heartache.

Isabella, however, showed no outward emotion. She simply acknowledged his words. “Understood.”

A bitter taste filled Victoria’s mouth. Her hands clenched into tight fists beneath the sterile hospital sheets.

She owed Isabella? Owed her for what? Isabella was the one who had publicly ruined her reputation!

And now Grandfather was just handing the project over to her? That project was supposed to be Victoria’s responsibility! Its success would have brought her significant profit and cemented her standing. Why this sudden change?

Theodore Montgomery turned his attention to Victoria. “Victoria, you must focus on recuperating. You don’t object to this arrangement, do you?”

Object? Of course she objected!

She felt like she could tear them all apart in that moment. But the wedding was imminent. She had to maintain control, to not risk offending the Montgomery family. She had no choice. “Of course not,” Victoria forced out. “As long as Isabella isn’t overburdened.”

“Don’t concern yourself. I’m not pregnant, and my health is excellent. You should concentrate on your recovery. Focus on becoming a good mother and a dutiful wife. I will manage everything else,” Isabella commented, a faint, cool smile touching her lips.

With that, she turned and exited the room.

Victoria watched her leave, teeth gritted. She was gloating. Isabella was deliberately rubbing her face in it—flaunting the project, her vitality, her victory.

If the original plan had held, Isabella would be the one marrying Alexander, destined for a life as a confined housewife. That was supposed to be Isabella’s fate! Isabella should have been the one rendered useless and irrelevant!

But the tables had turned completely. Now Victoria was the one being forced into that powerless role.

Once married, her standing in the modeling world would vanish. She would never reclaim her former glory. She would be forced to watch from the sidelines as Isabella’s star rose higher and higher.

What alternative did she have, though? None. If she didn’t hold onto Alexander, she would have nothing left.

A wave of nausea washed over her, despite the cheerful wedding planning happening just outside her door. Isabella’s final words echoed, eerie and threatening. It was impossible that Isabella would help her without some hidden scheme in motion.

Theodore Montgomery soon left to join the wedding discussions. Not long after, Margaret Whitmore re-entered the room. Her tone was gentle. “Victoria, Alexander just called. He said it’s too late to have a custom wedding gown made. We’ll have to purchase a designer one from a boutique. Also, because of the short notice, The Grand Mariner is completely booked. We’ll have to hold the ceremony at a different hotel. I hope you understand.”

A designer gown? The same mass-produced design anyone with enough money could buy?

And The Grand Mariner was the most distinctive venue in all of Westchester. Built out over the ocean, its spire was visible from every corner of the city, a landmark from any angle!

Every prestigious family and public figure hosted their weddings at The Grand Mariner.

Now, suddenly, Victoria had to compromise on everything.

Compromise. The word curdled in her stomach. Victoria was utterly displeased.
###Chapter 372

Victoria remained silent, her expression unreadable.

Margaret Whitmore moved closer, her voice dripping with false concern. “Oh, Victoria…”

She let the words hang in the air for a moment.

“You’re carrying a child now. Your little scandal with Alexander is front page news. Everyone knows.”

She patted Victoria’s hand, a gesture that felt more like a warning than comfort.

“This wedding is the only solution. For you. For him. Endure this unpleasantness now. Behave. Do as you’re told. Then, after you’re married, you’ll be treated well. Provided you become a proper wife and mother, of course.”

The message was clear, wrapped in a veneer of maternal advice. ‘You are damaged goods. Be grateful we are allowing this marriage. Your only value now is in protecting our family’s reputation.’

It was a calculated insult.

Victoria’s fists clenched beneath the bedsheets. Her nails bit into her palms, drawing blood. The physical pain was nothing compared to the searing humiliation.

She had to endure it. There was no other choice.

She forced her voice into a soft, compliant tone. “Aunt Margaret, please don’t worry. I’ve left my modeling career behind. My only focus is being a good wife to Alexander. I will take care of myself and this baby. The family can handle all the arrangements. I trust your judgment completely.”

“Good. That’s very sensible.” Margaret stood, her smile tight and satisfied. “Since our families are so close, we’ll keep the wedding simple. No need for unnecessary fuss.”

She swept out of the room, leaving Victoria trembling with a rage so potent it threatened to choke her.

Simple?

She had dreamed of a spectacular wedding for years. As the world’s top supermodel, from the prestigious Montgomery family, marrying into the Whitmore dynasty… It should have been the event of the season.

Now they wanted it to be simple? Quiet? An embarrassment to be swept under the rug?

They thought she was worthless. They believed Alexander was settling for her.

She was Victoria Kensington! The heiress to the Montgomery fortune! The face that launched a thousand campaigns!

“Sis?”

The voice pulled her from her furious thoughts. Benjamin stood in the doorway, his young face creased with concern.

She quickly schooled her features into a mask of weary acceptance.

“Benjamin? What is it?”

“I heard what she said.” His hands were balled into fists at his sides. “It’s not right. You deserve better than a ‘simple’ wedding. I’ll go tell them!”

He turned to leave, fueled by righteous anger.

Victoria slid from the bed and grabbed his arm. “No! Benjamin, don’t. Please.”

She infused her voice with a heartbreaking mixture of shame and resignation. “This… this is what I deserve. After what I did… ruining Isabella’s moment… I’m lucky to be alive. I’m lucky they’re still allowing this marriage. I can’t ask for more.”

Benjamin froze. The memory of the live-streamed scandal flooded back. The undeniable proof of her scheming with Alexander against Isabella. His own sister, the architect of such public humiliation.

His anger faltered, replaced by confusion and unease. “You… you never really explained that to me,” he mumbled.

Explanation? What could she possibly say? The evidence was irrefutable.

Victoria’s eyes glistened with unshed tears. “The past is too painful to revisit. Someday you’ll understand the difficult position I was in, but not now. Just know that I am your sister. I’ve always looked out for you, haven’t I? Since we were children. I’ve always wanted what’s best for you.”

She painted herself as a martyr, silently bearing a burden to protect him.

Benjamin remembered. She had always been his defender. She funded his gaming team when their parents scoffed. She cheered him on when no one else did. His expression softened.

Seeing his defenses crumble, Victoria gently took his hands. “I’ve never asked you for anything, Benjamin. Not once. But I need to ask you for a favor now. Will you help me?”

A favor? He looked at her, his loyalty warring with his doubt.
###Chapter 373

“I don’t care if the Whitmores despise me,” Victoria began. “And I don’t care what anyone else thinks of me either. But I’m terrified—terrified this wedding won’t happen. Benjamin, you know I’ve left modeling. I have nothing left except Alexander and this baby.”

She paused, letting the silence hang.

“But Isabella… she despises me. She won’t just let me be. Of course, it’s just a suspicion… I worry she still has feelings for Alexander. I’m afraid she might try to hurt me.”

Benjamin narrowed his eyes. “That seems unlikely.”

Isabella was with Nathaniel now. Her hatred for Alexander was obvious…

“I hope you’re right!” Victoria continued. “But I don’t feel safe. If she didn’t hate me, she wouldn’t have mocked me like that before she left.”

She looked down, feigning distress.

“You know she’s never accepted my apology. She still holds a grudge. So… I need you to stay with her for a few days. You don’t have to confront her. Just watch her. It’s harmless.”

“If she plans anything, you can intervene. You’re her brother, after all. You can warn me if something happens.”

Benjamin frowned. She wanted him to move out of Montgomery Manor? To live with Isabella? He already disliked her. Did he really have to stay under the same roof?

“Benjamin, I know you’re reluctant. But it’s only three days. Just three! In return, I can get Takashi Yamamoto to coach you. Personally.”

His eyes lit up immediately. “Seriously?”

Even though Takashi had lost to that player called Boss, he was still one of the top gamers. Besides Boss, no one could touch him.

The night after his defeat, Takashi had challenged every top player—and won every match. His reputation was fully restored. People whispered that Boss must have cheated. Or gotten lucky. Or was some kind of gaming deity.

To Benjamin, Takashi was still a legend.

Victoria nodded. “Yes. I met him at an event in Westhaven once. He’s a fan. He’ll do it if I ask. This isn’t a bribe, Benjamin… I see you as my own brother. I know you’ll be bored these next few days. Think of it as my wedding gift to you.”

He felt a pang of guilt. She was always so thoughtful. And here he was, hesitating over such a simple request.

“Alright,” he agreed. “I’ll do it. I’ll go find her right now.”

Victoria watched him leave, a cold smirk twisting her lips once his back was turned.

Penelope closed the door behind him and approached, confused. “Ms. Victoria, we could hire someone to watch Isabella. Sending Benjamin and paying Takashi… that will cost a fortune!”

She knew Victoria’s finances were strained. After the last scandal, her shares were frozen. Theodore Montgomery had ordered her to rest at home. No one was giving her money anymore.

As for Takashi… Even if he admired her, no one did favors for free. Not for a woman with a ruined reputation.

Victoria scoffed. “You know nothing. I have my reasons.”

She picked up her phone and typed a message to Takashi Yamamoto:

[Mr. Yamamoto, I have a favor to ask. My brother is an avid gamer and admires you greatly. Would you be willing to train him? I will make it worth your while. If you can take him to Westhaven for intensive coaching, I will be even more grateful. Help him achieve his dream.]

Her eyes darkened as she sent the text.

Just wait. Soon, everyone who looked down on her would regret it. Even the mighty Whitmores.

Meanwhile, the entire manor was buzzing with wedding preparations. Even Theodore was involved.

Only Benjamin slipped away, rushing to the parking lot.

Luck was on his side. Isabella hadn’t left yet. Her car was still there.
###Chapter 374

Isabella Montgomery reached for the ignition when she sensed movement behind her. She turned to find Benjamin Kensington seated there. Her brow furrowed instantly.

"What are you doing here?"

"The estate is unbearable today. I'm staying with you for a couple days." Benjamin stated it plainly, without pretense.

Isabella found it odd. Even if the Montgomery manor was chaotic, he had other options. Friends. Hotels. Why choose her?

Victoria must have made her move. Isabella's curiosity prickled. What was her adopted sister planning now?

She secured her helmet and handed Benjamin a spare one.

He blinked, surprised. He had expected resistance, not immediate compliance.

This was going better than anticipated. Benjamin fastened the helmet.

Isabella revved the engine. The motorcycle surged forward, accelerating at a breathtaking pace.

Benjamin grabbed the rear handle, caught off guard. His mind flashed to the old Isabella. The pretentious, clumsy girl who trailed after Alexander Whitmore. The constant embarrassment.

Now, she was this. Formidable. Impressive. He had to admit, she looked incredibly cool.

Meanwhile, at the Blackwood Estate...

A lavish celebration was in full swing. Industry elites mingled throughout the opulent halls. Their conversations were a low, refined hum.

Vivienne Delacroix stood apart even here. A crystal wine glass dangled from her fingers. She sat near an elaborate floral arrangement.

Her strapless gown was a masterpiece. The hem was a river of inlaid diamonds. They caught the light with her slightest movement, sparkling from every angle.

She was beauty. She was class. She was utterly singular.

A cluster of women orbited her. Admiring gazes from men followed her. But Vivienne's attention was fixed on one figure alone.

Nathaniel Blackwood stood by the champagne tower. His tailored suit accentuated his powerful frame. He was surrounded by businessmen, yet he held a quiet command.

He didn't need to speak. His presence alone radiated an aura of exquisite authority.

A slow smile touched Vivienne's lips. The plan was in motion. By now, Alexander should have had his way with Isabella. She could barely contain her anticipation.

She imagined Nathaniel's face when he saw the photos. The delicious shock. The betrayal.

Just then, her assistant, Cassandra Delacroix, rushed over. "Madam, an urgent matter."

Vivienne offered a brief apology to her companions. They dispersed immediately, not daring to linger.

Cassandra leaned in, her voice a hushed whisper. "Alexander's plan failed. Victoria is pregnant. They're announcing their engagement."

What? Vivienne's grip on the glass tightened. The stem threatened to snap.
###Chapter 375

How could Alexander let such a perfect chance slip through his fingers and end up engaged to Victoria instead?

What a useless pawn he turned out to be.

“Get back immediately and drive it to Vivienne,” she ordered in a low, sharp tone. “Reginald Worthington.”

Reginald was the CEO of Fortune Entertainment who had conspired with SilverPeak to attack Isabella.

But after being publicly humiliated by Isabella, he had kept a low profile.

Since Isabella possessed evidence of his affairs, his company had been forced into seclusion.

He harbored a deep hatred for Isabella. He craved revenge. If he got his hands on this pill, he would make sure Isabella paid dearly.

“Probably not today,” said Cassandra. “Isabella’s brother, Benjamin, is going back to Rosewood Manor with her.”

That meant Isabella would have both a child and her brother living with her!

Damn it!

Her grip tightened violently. The stem of the wine glass snapped with a loud crack.

Anthony’s mother, Beatrice Blackwood, approached her at that moment. “Vivienne, what’s wrong? Why are you sitting here all alone?”

“It’s nothing,” Vivienne said, quickly recomposing herself. She put on a worried expression. “I’m just ashamed I couldn’t complete the task you gave me.”

Vivienne was supposed to spend this month building a closer relationship with Nathaniel, aiming for an engagement announcement today. But she had made zero progress with him.

Beatrice sighed. “What a pity. With so many important people here, it would have been the perfect occasion for an announcement. Sadly…”

She shook her head. “Never mind. There’s still time. Come with me. Let’s go talk to Nathaniel. You two need more contact!”

She offered her hand to Vivienne.

Vivienne stood up gracefully and followed her toward Nathaniel.

Hah! So what if Nathaniel liked Isabella? His parents favored her. Only she, in her exquisite gown, deserved to stand by his side.

Just as they neared him, his phone rang.

Nathaniel answered. It was Dominic. “Boss, we have a problem. Ms. Montgomery is bringing a man back to the mansion. The man is riding on the back of her motorcycle!”

Nathaniel’s face instantly turned to ice. He ended the call without a word.

He had told Isabella to stay home and look after Oliver. Instead, she went out and was bringing another man back to his property?!

He pocketed his phone and approached his father. “I have an urgent matter to attend to. You’ll have to excuse me.”

Reginald Blackwood frowned. Excuse him? The celebration had only just begun. Lunch hadn't even been served. He was leaving already?

Despite the tension that had existed between them since the incident five years ago, Nathaniel was still his most accomplished son. His presence at the birthday celebration was a point of pride. How could he just leave?

Beatrice walked over, pulling Vivienne along. “What could possibly be more important than your father’s birthday? Can’t it wait until tomorrow? You haven’t been home in ages. There are still relatives who want to see you.”

She nudged Vivienne forward.

Vivienne stood there, the picture of elegance and composure. Gorgeous. Dignified. She was certain she was the most beautiful woman in the room. Surely Nathaniel would finally look at her.

However…

“Another time,” Nathaniel replied curtly. He turned and walked away.

His stride was steady and cold, utterly merciless. He didn’t even glance at Vivienne as he passed her.

The other society heiresses had always looked up to Vivienne, believing she was the only woman who could hold Nathaniel’s attention. That illusion was shattered in that moment.
###Chapter 376

What a humiliating scene!

Isabella clenched her fists, feeling the weight of everyone's mocking stares.

Why would Nathaniel do this to her? Why publicly embarrass her like that?

Thankfully, Beatrice was quick to smooth things over. "Oh dear... Nathaniel has always been this way, completely consumed by work. It's all business with him!"

"Quite understandable! That's precisely why Blackwood Corporation thrives," the guests chimed in politely.

The tension eased slightly, allowing Isabella to discreetly signal Cassandra.

They needed to discover why Nathaniel left so abruptly!

Meanwhile, Isabella and Benjamin arrived at Rosewood Manor and stepped inside.

Benjamin expected an empty mansion, but was immediately confronted with evidence of other occupants - men's shoes and children's footwear scattered near the entrance.

A child's drawing board lay on the sofa, covered with adorable animal sketches. The entire place radiated warmth and domestic life.

His brow furrowed. Was Isabella living with someone?

Upstairs, cheerful laughter echoed through the hall. "Fly! Christopher is flying! Maxwell, let me fly higher!"

Isabella's expression softened instantly at the familiar voice, and she hurried upstairs.

Benjamin followed, perplexed. 'Christopher'? Why did that name sound familiar?

They entered a spectacular room spanning two floors with an eight-meter ceiling.

The wall was transformed into a climbing surface with professional grips. Christopher descended skillfully, secured by safety harnesses.

He moved with astonishing agility, stepping between stones like a trained professional.

Isabella watched with pride. Her son moved with such natural grace!

Maxwell approached her, impressed. "No wonder he's Mr. Blackwood's son - those genes are remarkable. I expected to guide him step-by-step, but he's leaping three stones at once! Mastered it in ten minutes flat! Reminds me of your training days at the base!"

Isabella had been weak initially, but her uncles' rigorous training unlocked her potential. She'd mastered climbing in the same timeframe.

It was as if motherhood had unleashed her inner strength after leaving Alexander and surviving the stillbirth.

Isabella smiled proudly. "Of course! Look who his mother is!"

Maxwell shook his head in amusement.

Christopher's biological mother remained unknown, and Isabella was merely his stepmother!

Spotting Isabella, Christopher descended eagerly. "Mommy! You're back! Look, I can climb now! I can fly!"

"I saw everything, sweetheart. I'll make your favorite chicken wings for lunch as a reward!" Isabella ruffled his hair affectionately.

Christopher clapped excitedly. "Yay!"

During his celebration, he noticed Benjamin behind Isabella. "Mommy, why is he here?" His smile vanished.

This man had nearly made Mommy leave the Celestial Gala! Daddy had to travel far away to rescue him because of this man! He didn't like him at all!

Benjamin studied Christopher, confusion mounting.

While he knew Nathaniel was serious about Isabella, he hadn't realized they were still together! And she'd formed such a close bond with the young heir!
###Chapter 377

Isabella looked at Benjamin. “He’ll be staying with us for three days. Christopher is the young master of this house, so you must treat him with respect. Understood?”

Young master?

She called Oliver Blackwood ‘young master’?

Benjamin’s soul nearly left his body. He was Isabella’s brother—the only blood relative she had in this entire building!

And the way she spoke to him… Was she treating Oliver like her own child? Was she truly serious about Nathaniel too?

“Isabella, have you forgotten our conversation the other night?” The words slipped out before Benjamin could stop himself. “You’re being reckless.”

Nathaniel was playing with her! How could she be so naive?

“Don’t you dare speak to my Mommy like that!” Oliver jumped up, positioning himself protectively in front of Isabella. “You’re the reckless one! Your whole family is reckless! You’re completely blind!”

Benjamin was stunned into silence.

It was the first time he had ever been scolded by a child. But this was Nathaniel Blackwood’s son. He couldn’t afford to offend him—especially not with his father around.

Defeated, Benjamin muttered under his breath, “Isabella, I hope you’ll reconsider. Be rational! Victoria is getting married soon. It’s time you started looking for a husband too.”

With that, he turned and stormed out of the room. He marched down the stairs and slumped onto the sofa.

A restless feeling settled in his chest. The thought of Isabella becoming the other woman—Nathaniel’s mistress—made his blood boil.

Five years ago, she had shamelessly chased after Alexander. Now, five years later, after finding someone better, she was repeating the same mistakes?

Just then, the front door swung open.

Click!

Nathaniel stepped inside. As expected, a man was sitting on the sofa. From this angle, he could only see the back of his head.

Judging by his silhouette… he looked young.

So, Isabella had a thing for younger men?

His expression darkened instantly. “Throw him out.”

Those three words were spoken calmly, yet carried a sharp, venomous edge.

This man—whoever he was—had the audacity to get close to Isabella and ride on the back of her motorcycle!

Damn it!

Dominic immediately signaled two bodyguards. They moved forward to seize Benjamin.

Pulled roughly to his feet, Benjamin stared at them in confusion.

The atmosphere grew thick with tension.

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. Benjamin? The man Isabella brought home was her brother, Benjamin?

Dominic was equally shocked. So the person who returned with Isabella was Benjamin after all?

Mr. Blackwood had almost thrown out his own brother-in-law!

Nathaniel shot him an icy glare. “Get out. One hundred push-ups. Now.”

Dominic felt a pang of injustice. Benjamin had been wearing a helmet earlier, making it impossible to identify him. How was he supposed to know it was Mr. Blackwood’s brother-in-law?

Perfect. He had offended Benjamin and nearly caused his boss to eject his own family.

“I’ll do them right away, sir!” Flustered, he hurried out with the two bodyguards.

Benjamin frowned. What was Nathaniel playing at? One moment he nearly had him thrown out, the next he dismissed his guards?

But Nathaniel was the most powerful man in Westchester. Fearful of crossing him, Benjamin kept his mouth shut.

Nathaniel acted as if nothing had happened. He removed his suit jacket and hung it on the coat stand. Then he walked over and settled into the sofa. “What are you doing here?”

His tone was neutral, devoid of its earlier edge.

“I’m staying with my sister for three days.”

Three days?

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed slightly. The air around him grew heavier. His dark eyes revealed nothing—no emotion, no thought.

Benjamin felt the pressure intensify. It was as if the oxygen had been sucked out of the room.

Just when he thought Nathaniel was about to kick him out, Nathaniel spoke again. “Do you need anything? Toiletries? Clothes?”

Benjamin was speechless. Was he hearing things? What kind of question was that?
###Chapter 378

Nathaniel’s gaze remained fixed on Benjamin before he retrieved his phone to call Dominic.
“Prepare a set of daily essentials for Mr. Kensington.”

Dominic, who had been bracing for punishment, accepted the new assignment without hesitation.
“Right away, sir!”

Benjamin snapped out of his daze.
Was Nathaniel Blackwood actually arranging personal supplies for him?
The untouchable head of the Blackwood family was showing him consideration?

Nathaniel rose to his feet.
“No need to be tense. I’m your brother-in-law.”

His voice was low and textured, carrying an air of effortless sophistication.

Then he turned and headed upstairs.

Benjamin stared after him, completely stunned.
Brother-in-law…?
Did Nathaniel just say that—so openly, so casually?

Upstairs, Isabella was with Oliver in his room, speaking softly.
“Don’t let Benjamin upset you, sweetheart. He’s just stubborn and set in his ways.
How about some exercise? Or we can play with your new toys.”

As long as his immunity strengthened, Oliver’s recovery would accelerate.

Oliver nodded obediently.
“Okay! A big person doesn’t fight with a small one.
I’m a grown-up five-year-old, after all!”

Just then, Nathaniel walked in.
His eyes immediately landed on Maxwell, who stood near Isabella.

Maxwell had striking silver hair and was dressed in sharp black tactical wear—like a special ops agent.
He looked familiar; Nathaniel was sure he’d seen him at an international security conference before.
What was he doing here, so close to Isabella?

Under Nathaniel’s intense scrutiny, Maxwell nearly flinched.
He’d faced combat zones and high-stakes negotiations, but Nathaniel’s gaze—authoritative and faintly possessive—was unnerving.

“Mission complete, Ms. Montgomery,” Maxwell said quickly.
“I’ll take my leave.”
He exited the manor almost at a sprint.

Isabella didn’t stop him.
She turned warily to Nathaniel.
“Weren’t you at the corporate gala? Why are you back so early?”

“It was tedious,” Nathaniel replied dismissively.

Noticing the safety harness Isabella had ready, he added,
“You two carry on. I’ll handle lunch.”

“Alright.”

Lately, Nathaniel had taken over most meal preparations.
They were premium pre-made dishes, designed to be heated precisely—each labeled with exact microwave timings by world-class chefs.
The results were consistently flawless.

Isabella helped Oliver with his rock wall and pull-up bar exercises.

Downstairs, Benjamin remained frozen on the sofa, struggling to process the situation.
Then he watched Nathaniel enter the kitchen and tie on a black apron.

Benjamin frowned. What was happening?

Nathaniel unwrapped the gourmet packages, placed them in the microwave, and set the timer.
He retrieved plates from the sterilizing cabinet—first three, then, noticing Benjamin in the living room, a fourth.

Benjamin stared, disbelieving.
Was he hallucinating?
Nathaniel Blackwood—ruthless, formidable, a titan of industry—was in the kitchen preparing a meal?
He lived with Isabella… Wasn’t she supposed to be the subordinate? The dependent?
Why was he the one cooking?

With innate elegance, Nathaniel set the table with plates and cutlery, then arranged the dishes.
Every movement was fluid and precise, like a scene from a classic romance film.

Thirty minutes later, four exquisite dishes graced the table.
Nathaniel removed his apron and looked toward Benjamin.
“Go inform your sister and your nephew it’s time to eat.”

Benjamin stiffened.
Nephew…
The young master of Westchester—his nephew?
And he was really about to share a meal with Nathaniel Blackwood?
###Chapter 379

The idea made Benjamin's blood run cold. But Nathaniel had already given the order. Benjamin had no choice but to call them down.

Isabella was training on the pull-up bar with Oliver. Their movements looked professional and impressive—an adult and child effortlessly performing chin-ups.

The scene felt warm and domestic, like a real family enjoying time together.

Benjamin shook off the thought and called out flatly, "Lunch is ready."

Isabella landed gracefully before lifting Oliver down from the bar. "Remember to stretch after exercising," she instructed. "Just like Mommy is doing."

She clasped her hands above her head and bent side to side, stretching her arm muscles. Oliver mimicked her movements, his small limbs making him look utterly adorable. After finishing their leg stretches, Isabella took Oliver's hand and they walked downstairs together.

Four different dishes sat in the center of the table, with empty plates set before each seat.

Nathaniel sat at the head of the table, placing his napkin on his lap with his usual elegance. Benjamin observed everything as he descended the stairs. It suddenly struck him why Isabella would agree to be Nathaniel's secret lover. The man was perfection personified, and every movement captivated those around him.

The rectangular dining table perfectly accommodated four people. Benjamin lacked the courage to sit beside Nathaniel, quickly taking the seat farthest from him.

Oliver immediately protested. "That's my spot! I want to sit next to Mommy!"

"Christopher, he's your uncle. Show some respect. Come here," Nathaniel warned sternly.

Oliver pouted as he trudged to Nathaniel's side, his little face clouded with displeasure.

Isabella smiled helplessly and took the seat opposite Nathaniel. She gave Oliver a chicken wing. "Be good, sweetheart. You can still see your beautiful Mommy right across from you."

"Oh yeah! I can't let anyone else have the best view! Hmph!" Oliver pouted and glared at Benjamin, his expression both arrogant and adorably childish.

Benjamin felt utterly speechless.

The young master clearly viewed him with hostility, though he'd done nothing wrong. He lowered his head and began eating quietly.

Nathaniel placed a slice of fish on Isabella's plate. "You're too thin. Eat more."

"Okay." Isabella accepted without hesitation.

This surprised Benjamin. A serving spoon lay on the table, yet Nathaniel used his own fork to serve Isabella.

Moreover, Isabella didn't seem to mind at all!

Benjamin remained the only one using the serving spoon. He knew how much the upper class valued table etiquette. Even when dining with the Montgomery family, they always used serving utensils.

What more the Blackwoods?

When had these two become so intimate?

Just then, knocks sounded at the door.

Isabella frowned. Who would visit at this hour? She rose to answer it, finding Dominic standing outside with several other men. Each held boxes filled with various items.

"These are the daily necessities prepared for Mr. Kensington," stated Dominic. "Please inform us if anything is missing."

Benjamin stared at the boxes containing everything from toiletries to clothing. There was even a brand new four-piece suit and a large-screen computer.

He was only staying with Isabella for three days, yet Nathaniel had them prepare all this?

Even Isabella looked shocked as she turned to Nathaniel. "Benjamin is only staying three days! This seems wasteful."

"It's fine. He's your brother."
###Chapter 380

Nathaniel's voice was impossibly soft. His eyes held a gentle glow, filled with undeniable affection.

Benjamin frowned deeply. Was Nathaniel being kind only because he was Isabella's brother?

Was Isabella really just his secret lover? Something felt off. Very off.

Warmth spread through Isabella's chest at his words. Right then, she made a firm decision.

In two days, once she had a moment, she would help Nathaniel investigate the incident from five years ago.

She needed to find out who he had slept with that night.

Meanwhile…

The Montgomerys and the Whitmores finalized the wedding plans. Time was tight. Most luxury venues were fully booked.

They eventually settled on The Ritz-Carlton.

It was the same hotel where Alexander and Isabella had held their engagement party. A five-star establishment, but not the absolute pinnacle of luxury.

When the families announced the news online, it exploded across social media.

A former top supermodel. The so-called 'National Husband'. Their scandal was still fresh in everyone's minds.

#Victoria-marrying-Alexander instantly trended at number one.

(Is Victoria actually marrying Alexander?!)

(Didn't he just propose to Isabella at the Night of Glory gala?)

(Her nudes leaked, then she slept with him at his wedding to Isabella, and now this? Marriage?)

(That's all history! They're perfect for each other! They have a five-year history!)

(He proposed to Isabella and failed. Now he's marrying Victoria? Who does he actually love? Both?)

(Isabella hasn't taken any modeling jobs since the wedding. She's stepped back from the spotlight. Probably heartbroken.)

(It must destroy her, watching her ex marry her sister…)

(Sending love to Isabella.)

(Sending love to Isabella +10086)

Despite being the bride, Victoria's name was overshadowed. Isabella's name was searched more frequently.

Netizens dredged up everything: the leaked photos, the plots against other models, the betrayal with her almost brother-in-law.

The comment section was a warzone.

Victoria had just returned home. She was in her room, reviewing her schedule, when she saw the comments.

Her fists clenched until her knuckles turned white.

This was Isabella's doing. It had to be!

Isabella pretended to be so magnanimous in front of their grandfather. She acted supportive of the wedding.

All while scheming behind the scenes to sabotage it. How utterly vicious!

After a moment's thought, she called Alexander.

He answered after a few rings. His voice was flat. "Yes?"

All the previous gentleness was gone. There was no joy about their impending marriage.

Victoria's grip on the phone tightened. "Alexander, have you seen the news online? It's horrible… Someone is behind this. You have media connections. The wedding is so soon. Can't you have them take it down?"

Alexander was in his office. He absently rolled a small pill bottle between his fingers.

This should have been his wedding to Isabella. Everything was supposed to go according to plan.

Instead, he was stuck marrying Victoria.

Her stake in Montgomery Holdings was pitifully small. How could she possibly help him?

"Ignore them," he said, his tone devoid of emotion. "Clear your head. Focus on being a bride. Don't waste energy on this."

Victoria's face darkened. Clear her head? Everyone was tearing them apart!

How could she possibly ignore it?

If this wasn't stopped, she would have to endure their judgmental stares on her wedding day. Was he looking down on her because of her small share percentage?
###Chapter 381

Victoria was about to respond to Alexander when Penelope burst into her room with excitement.

Good news?

Victoria had assigned her a task. Had she completed it successfully?

Victoria immediately ended the call with Alexander. "You must be exhausted. Get some rest."

"Alright. You too," Alexander replied flatly before hanging up.

Victoria turned to Penelope. "What did you find out?"

Not satisfied with just planting Benjamin as a spy, Victoria had sent Penelope to track Isabella's movements. She wanted to know exactly where Isabella lived, ideally to block access and trap her inside!

Penelope reported, "I followed Isabella back to Rosewood Manor. I was going to proceed as instructed, but I discovered two shocking revelations!"

Penelope closed the door, approached Victoria, and whispered, "Isabella is living with Nathaniel! They're both at Rosewood Manor. Also, someone else was following and observing them."

"After further investigation, I identified the stalker as Vivienne's assistant, Cassandra!"

Victoria frowned. Nathaniel was still with Isabella?

She thought Nathaniel was just toying with Isabella. Why was he still involved with her?

As for Vivienne? Anyone familiar with Nathaniel knew Vivienne. She came from generations of aristocracy and education—an exceptionally talented and extraordinary woman. Although her reputation was briefly tarnished by the Genevieve scandal, she recently issued several research and development patents that silenced critics. Since her patents benefited the public, who would dare insult a renowned researcher?

This new information seemed insignificant, but for Victoria, it presented more advantages than drawbacks!

Her red lips curled into a slow smile. Vivienne was investigating Isabella… That meant she was also keeping tabs on Isabella!

No matter how clever Isabella was, she couldn't defeat Vivienne, who had vast resources. Victoria simply needed to wait for Vivienne to crush Isabella and then seize the opportunity!

Victoria eyed Penelope. "Did you find out what Vivienne is planning?"

"She attended Senior Blackwood's birthday celebration today, but Nathaniel ignored her. I spent a considerable amount to learn that Vivienne is trying to obtain a photo of Isabella with Nathaniel to send to his parents!"

Penelope continued gossiping, "I heard Vivienne spent a fortune on a Special Warfare spy camera after Boss Blackwood moved out of his mansion, but she still hasn't managed to get a photo of them."

Victoria's eyes darkened. Was Nathaniel protecting Isabella?

Still, Nathaniel must not know about Isabella's past pregnancy. He would surely discard her once he found out!

The best strategy was to ally with Vivienne.

She picked up her phone and texted Benjamin: [Benjamin, are you settling in alright there?]

At Rosewood Manor.

Benjamin had just finished arranging his new room when he received Victoria's text. He replied: [Don't worry, Sis. Everything is perfect.]

All the daily necessities were brand new, and Nathaniel had even sent someone to install a new curved-screen computer in his room. He could play games to his heart's content.

Victoria texted: [How is Isabella's manor? Is she lonely living by herself? Invite her to come home and live with us—it's better for everyone to be together.] Benjamin thought about how cozy everything felt and sent a reassuring reply.
###Chapter 382

Benjamin: [Don't worry about me. She's perfectly fine, really.]
Victoria: [Good. I sent you those premium Bluetooth earphones—make sure you get them. Perfect for gaming sessions or listening to music.]
Benjamin: [Thanks, Vic.]

The earphones arrived that afternoon. They were the newest model from a top tech brand, sleek matte black with crystal-clear sound that made every track feel like a live performance.

Benjamin loved them. He didn’t even take them off during dinner.

Meanwhile, Victoria was reviewing a series of images sent directly to her encrypted email. Tiny, undetectable pinhole cameras hidden in the earphones had done their job perfectly. The photos were sharp, intimate, and automatically uploaded to her private server.

She opened the files. There was Isabella curled on the sofa reading, little Oliver tucked beside her. In another, Nathaniel was at his desk, documents spread before him, but his gaze was fixed on Isabella. There was even one where they were leaning close, speaking softly, a moment of quiet understanding.

Each image radiated domestic warmth. A burning jealousy twisted inside Victoria.

Why did Isabella get everything? A man like Nathaniel, devotion, a family… while she was cast aside by Alexander?

Isabella was damaged goods. A victim, a mother to a dead child. She didn’t deserve this happiness.

Nathaniel was a king. A man every woman dreamed of. What dark magic had Isabella used to ensnare him?

Her face a mask of bitter envy, Victoria forwarded the entire set of photos to Vivienne.

Let Vivienne see this. Let her simmer. Isabella’s perfect little world was about to crack.

After leaving the Blackwood patriarch's birthday, Vivienne had returned to her lab. Her assistant, Cassandra, entered quietly. “Ma’am, Mr. Blackwood went directly back to Rosewood Manor. He’s with her.”

Vivienne’s hands stilled. He left his own father’s party early just to run back to Isabella?

Isabella Montgomery. That cunning, low-class witch. This was a direct challenge.

Then her phone chimed. An anonymous message with attachments. She tapped the screen.

The images loaded. Nathaniel’s cold demeanor, softened entirely as he looked at Isabella. The three of them looked like a perfect, happy family.

The sight was a physical blow. The man who treated her with icy indifference was pouring all his warmth onto that woman.

Rage erupted. She swept her arm across the lab bench, sending glass beakers and reagents crashing to the floor. Chemicals mixed and sizzled, eating into the wood.

Cassandra rushed to contain the mess. “Should I send these to Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood?” she asked cautiously. “A woman of her… reputation… could never meet their standards.”

Vivienne’s voice was dangerously calm. “Not yet. First, I want her name trending everywhere. Draft press releases. Highlight her eighteen-year ‘epic romance’ with Alexander Whitmore.”

“But… if Mr. Blackwood is with her, he must already know. He clearly doesn’t care,” Cassandra pointed out.

A cold smile touched Vivienne’s lips. “I don’t need him to care. I need the public to believe Isabella’s heart belongs to Alexander. When these photos eventually leak… what will everyone see then?”

She picked up a scalpel, holding its tip in the blue flame of an alcohol burner. The flickering light carved shadows on her face, making her look utterly ruthless. A devil with a plan.
###Chapter 383

Isabella finally understood everything.

Vivienne was absolutely right.

The entire world believed Isabella was heartbroken over Alexander's betrayal.

They thought she had withdrawn from modeling because of him.

If photos of her with Nathaniel surfaced now, everyone would assume she had secretly moved on to the Blackwood heir.

The public would brand her as a calculated, manipulative woman.

Worse yet, if they exposed her past relationship with Alexander, Nathaniel's parents would think she still had feelings for her ex.

They would believe she was seeing both men simultaneously.

Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood would never accept such a woman as their daughter-in-law.

It was a flawless plan.

Vivienne truly was a genius.

Miranda immediately began executing the scheme.

Over the next two days, countless articles flooded the internet.

"Isabella's decade-long love for Alexander Whitmore."

"Isabella left the country to heal her broken heart, only to return and find her lover married to her sister."

"Everything Isabella sacrificed for Alexander."

"Isabella's world shattered on her wedding day."

These viral pieces kept the #ComfortIsabella hashtag trending for days.

In contrast, Victoria and Alexander's five-year relationship seemed trivial and insignificant.

Few people offered them wedding congratulations.

The public now viewed Alexander as a heartless cheater.

Victoria was labeled a scheming homewrecker who stole her sister's fiancé.

A woman who conspired to seize her sister's inheritance while seducing her sister's future husband.

Meanwhile, Victoria stood in a luxurious bridal fitting room.

She held herself with poised elegance as attendants adjusted her gown.

Her mood was radiant despite the ready-made nature of the dress.

The designer label was prestigious enough, and the design was acceptable.

Marrying Alexander and becoming Mrs. Whitmore was all that mattered.

Everything changed when Penelope rushed in, her hands trembling as she offered a phone.

Victoria's contentment vanished the moment she saw the screen.

Her face paled instantly.

Why was the entire internet sympathizing with Isabella?

Why was everyone calling her a homewrecker?

Strangers were wishing for her marriage to fail, hoping Alexander would abandon her.

The situation had escalated beyond control.

Why hadn't Alexander taken action to stop this?

Penelope stammered nervously, "Madam, you must stay strong. The wedding is in two days. You'll be Mrs. Whitmore then. I only showed you this because I didn't know how to handle it. We need to find a solution..."

Victoria's anger intensified.

Her previous agent, Isadora, would have resolved everything before bothering her.

But Isadora was gone, replaced by this incompetent fool who needed guidance for every little thing.

The frustration boiled within her.

If other attendants weren't present, she would have slapped Penelope immediately.

Victoria forced herself to remain calm, returning the phone with steady hands.

"Don't worry. None of this is true. They can say whatever they want. I've done nothing wrong."

She lifted her gown gracefully and exited the room.

Alexander waited outside, already changed into his wedding suit.

He sat motionless on a velvet sofa, lost in thought.

The curtain rustled as Victoria emerged.

His eyes lifted, and his expression shifted subtly.

Victoria wore her hair in an intricate loose braid.

Her wedding gown featured dramatic bishop sleeves that accentuated her delicate frame.

She resembled a princess descending from a royal palace.

There was no trace of meekness in her posture.

She exuded elegance and refined beauty.

Her face was perfectly sculpted, her eyes luminous and captivating.

She was a vision meant to be cherished and protected.

Alexander's still heart suddenly began to beat again.
###Chapter 384

How could Alexander forget? If he compared their beauty, Victoria was not inferior to Isabella in any way.

Isabella was like a sharp-edged rose, while Victoria was a soft and gentle lily.

Lately, Alexander had been so obsessed with the thorny rose that he neglected Victoria, who had always remained loyal by his side. What’s more, she was carrying his child—his own flesh and blood.

Victoria noticed the shift in Alexander’s expression and smiled sweetly. “Alexander, darling, how do I look?”

“Beautiful,” he finally answered, rising to adjust a stray strand of her hair. “You look absolutely breathtaking today,” he said with genuine admiration.

Blushing, Victoria lowered her gaze and playfully tapped his chest. “You’re teasing me, Alexander. I look the same as always.”

“You’re always beautiful,” Alexander replied, feeling a pang of guilt for how cold he had been toward her recently. He held her closer than usual. Victoria rested her head against his chest, wrapping her arms around his waist. They stood together before the full-length mirror—a handsome man and a stunning woman reflected back.

Alexander’s eyes softened with affection. Marrying Victoria wasn’t such a bad idea after all. He had loved her once, and that love had started long ago.

As for Isabella… he would handle her later.

Just then, Victoria lifted her head and spoke softly, “Alexander, my love, please don’t look at your phone these next few days. Avoid the news and social media. Let’s just focus on our wedding.”

Alexander frowned. “What’s going on?” he asked.

“It’s nothing, really. Just ignore it. Like you said—we should live our own lives. No matter what others say, I’ll always stand by you. I believe in you,” Victoria murmured soothingly.

But how could Alexander resist checking after that? He immediately opened his social media feed and saw the heated discussions.

He expected to see criticism aimed at Victoria, but why were people mocking him too?

They called him heartless, a two-timing player who couldn’t make up his mind!

Articles claimed that Isabella had sacrificed so much for him, only to be treated unfairly.

Ha! Hurt? Sad? Isabella hadn’t even glanced his way! She pushed him toward Victoria, and now she was playing the victim online?

Victoria gently took his phone away. “Alexander, please don’t be upset. I’m sure my sister didn’t plan this. Let’s just get married and forget about all this noise.”

“Who else could it be? She doesn’t want us to be happy! Our wedding is just around the corner, and she’s still causing trouble!” Alexander growled, his eyes burning with anger.

He wondered why he had been so torn up these past few days over not being able to marry Isabella… She was a wicked woman!

Yes, they had wronged her five years ago, but ever since she returned, she had ruthlessly turned their lives upside down!

They had apologized again and again, but not only did she refuse to forgive, she became even more hostile!

Alexander patted Victoria’s shoulder reassuringly. “Victoria, I’ve neglected you these past few days and made you sad. Don’t worry—I’ll take care of this.”

“Please don’t, Alexander. You’re exhausted. It’s my honor to marry you. I don’t want to take up more of your time,” Victoria said, her voice tinged with sadness.

That only made Alexander feel guiltier. Even though Victoria’s reputation had suffered, it was all because of him.

One woman saw him as her whole world; the other was actively trying to destroy him. She had even secretly gotten involved with another man!

He must have been blind these past few days to have fallen for someone like Isabella! Alexander would make it up to Victoria—and show Isabella that he was not a man to be trifled with.
###Chapter 385

His eyes burned with pure venom. Alexander turned to Victoria. "Go select some jewelry. I'll handle the payment."

"Of course... I'll make sure to look perfect for you. I won't disappoint." Victoria gave a knowing smile before walking away.

Alexander sank into the plush sofa. He opened WhatsApp, searching for Isabella's contact. He considered messaging her there, but remembered all his previous attempts had been blocked. He switched to standard text messaging instead.

[Stop spreading lies online, Isabella. Don't force me to release these photos!]

He attached a picture of Isabella wearing a provocative nurse uniform.

Five years ago, she had been blindly infatuated with him. She followed him everywhere, desperate to give him everything, yet he never gave her a second glance. In her pathetic attempts to gain his attention, she had dressed in all kinds of revealing outfits. If these images got out, the scandal would be just as damaging as Victoria's nude leak.

At Rosewood Manor.

Isabella was finishing a game of checkers with Christopher. So engrossed in their game, she didn't notice her phone lighting up on the nearby sofa.

Nathaniel, working on his laptop nearby, picked up the vibrating device.

[Stop spreading lies online, Isabella. Don't force me to...]

The lock screen prevented him from reading the full message. He glanced at Isabella, completely focused on teaching Christopher. He could easily bypass her security, but...

He decided against it. Respecting her privacy mattered. He stood and brought her the phone.

She took it, seeing the message from 'Waste of Space' on the lock screen.

That was her saved contact name for Alexander.

Why was he texting her now, right before his wedding?

Unlocking the phone, her grip tightened. Her brows furrowed deeply.

There it was. A photo of her on her knees on a bed, wearing that nurse costume, looking as seductive as possible.

A memory from five years ago flashed. After turning eighteen, she had lamented to Victoria: "Do you think Alexander even likes me? He never lets me near him."

Victoria's reply had been cunning. "Don't be silly! Alexander is just reserved. You need to take charge. Be bold! I'll get you some special outfits. Surprise him."

Young and foolish, Isabella had believed her. She dressed up like an idiot, hoping to finally capture his attention. Instead, it made him despise her more. The Montgomery family found out, branding her a shameless disgrace.

It shocked her that Alexander still possessed this photo. And now he was using it to threaten her...

Nathaniel, standing beside her, saw the image. His expression darkened instantly, a storm gathering in his eyes.

He never knew she had that side. That she had shown it to another man.

Isabella felt the air grow thick with tension. She looked up, meeting his intense gaze. "What? Disappointed?" The words escaped, laced with defensive bitterness.

Disappointed she had been that kind of woman. Disappointed in her past shame.

Knowing Nathaniel, he must be disgusted.

His response stunned her. A single, low word. "Furious."

Not disappointed. Furious.

Furious that she had been such a fool. An idiot who poured her heart out trying to please a man like Alexander. Who offered everything and received contempt in return.

And now, that man used her moment of vulnerability to threaten her. He weaponized her naive love.

His face a mask of cold anger, Nathaniel pulled out his own phone. His fingers flew across the screen. [If this photo is leaked, Whitmore Enterprises will cease to exist.]

He showed her the sent message. "It's handled. Don't worry."

Isabella stared, speechless. Even after seeing such an embarrassing, scandalous photo from her past, he didn't turn away. He didn't leave. He stood by her and fought back against Alexander without a moment's hesitation.
###Chapter 386

What was Nathaniel thinking?

Oliver noticed the sudden shift in the atmosphere. He quickly stood up and rushed out of the living room.

On the second floor, he bumped into Benjamin who was heading downstairs. He grabbed his arm firmly.

"Don't go down there," Oliver insisted. "My father and Isabella need privacy right now."

He pulled Benjamin back into the room without waiting for a response.

Benjamin looked completely bewildered by his words.

Privacy? In the middle of the day? How adventurous were Isabella and Nathaniel being?

Back in the living room, Isabella continued her confession. "There were more photos. I wore four different costumes that day."

After Alexander rejected her first rabbit costume, Victoria had suggested, "He didn't like that one? Try more styles—one of them will definitely catch his attention. Don't worry, I'll make sure nobody in the family finds out."

Five years ago, Isabella had been so naive. She had believed every word Victoria told her!

Foolishly, she had tried on various costumes, including some that were nearly transparent.

True to Victoria's promise, the family never found out. However, Alexander refused to see her for over two weeks afterward. He preferred innocent, pure girls like Victoria, not someone who seemed desperate. If not for Isabella's fifteen percent stake in the Montgomery family shares, Alexander would have broken off their engagement immediately!

Isabella pushed the memories aside and met Nathaniel's intense gaze. "Four costumes, each more revealing than the last. You'll regret loving me. It's not too late to walk away now."

Isabella preferred brutal honesty over sugarcoating the truth. She would take responsibility for her past actions. So what if Nathaniel hated her for it? She was accustomed to being alone anyway.

Yet when she saw the fire in Nathaniel's eyes, an unfamiliar fear stirred within her.

She was terrified he would say goodbye. Terrified he would abandon her.

Strangely, she cared deeply about what he thought of her...

Just as she braced for his disgust, Nathaniel's words shocked her. "It wasn't your fault."

Not her fault?

Isabella stared at him in disbelief. Was she hearing correctly? Were her senses deceiving her?

Nathaniel's voice remained firm and mature as he continued, "Loving someone and fighting for them isn't wrong. The fault lies with him. But..."

He looked deeply into her eyes. "Fortunately, he made a mistake. Fortunately, he didn't appreciate you."

His husky voice carried sincerity and magnetism, incredibly soothing to hear.

Isabella's heart skipped a beat. She understood his meaning perfectly: Nathaniel got his chance because Alexander had thrown her away.

Anyone else seeing those photos would have mocked her relentlessly. Yet Nathaniel said it wasn't her fault...

She studied the man before her. "Nathaniel, you're too good to me. How can I ever repay you?"

Nathaniel sat down opposite her and began gathering the checkers from the table. "Maybe spend more time with me? Treat me half as well as you treated Alexander."

Half as well?

Nathaniel Blackwood, settling for only half of her affection?

Isabella's red lips curved into a smile. "Sorry, but no."

No?

Nathaniel's expression darkened immediately.

Was Alexander still that important to her? Would she not even give him half of what she gave to Alexander?

"Isabella, tell me what percentage of your attention you can give me."

If she couldn't give half, couldn't she spare him at least some fraction? Isabella looked at him, her lips slowly curling upward.
###Chapter 387

The message was sent.

Alexander waited for Isabella to beg him not to release those scandalous photos.

Instead, his phone buzzed with a reply from an entirely different number.

[If these images ever surface, Whitmore Enterprises will cease to exist.]

The number was a chilling sequence of eleven identical digits—66666666666.

A custom account. The kind money couldn't buy.

A cold, severe face flashed in Alexander's mind. Him. It had to be Nathaniel.

They were still together. He hadn't left her.

Isabella’s confidence, her audacity… it all made sense now. She had Nathaniel Blackwood backing her. She feared nothing with his power behind her.

A dark, bitter hatred coiled in Alexander’s gut.

She played the victim online while secretly entangled with Nathaniel. What a cunning, calculating woman.

Spoiled. She was utterly, completely spoiled.

He snatched his phone, dialing a number. “Harrison. Southern Cemetery. Genevieve Beaumont’s grave. It’s time to act.”

Genevieve Beaumont. The Montgomery family’s longtime nanny. She raised Isabella from a child. When the world mocked Isabella as the adopted daughter, Genevieve was her sole protector.

Disturb that grave, and Isabella would drop everything. She would rush there immediately. And knowing her connection to Nathaniel now… he would surely go with her.

A cruel smirk twisted Alexander’s lips. Let’s see who calls me a douchebag then, when her affair with Nathaniel Blackwood is exposed for all to see.

And when the powerful Blackwood family discovers their heir is involved with a woman like her? They would never approve. They would despise her.

Nathaniel would have to choose. His family… or her. He would drop her. He had to.

The image of Nathaniel discarding Isabella filled Alexander with grim satisfaction. The thought of her crawling back to him, begging.

He craved it. He wanted to see it happen.

Nearby, Victoria pretended to browse jewelry. She observed Alexander’s every move. She heard his phone call.

Perfect. Alexander was plotting against Isabella. Her days were numbered.

But…

A nagging worry pricked at Victoria. Alexander and his parents still looked down on her. Her shares in the Montgomery empire were pitifully small. They knew she was the true adopted daughter, not Isabella.

Once she married into the Whitmore family, her time to win over the Montgomerys would vanish. Her bonds with Eleanor and Richard would weaken.

What good were such meager shares then?

She needed more. She needed a larger stake before the wedding. With more shares, Alexander and his parents would finally respect her. They would value her.

A sharp glint of malice lit her eyes. She excused herself, heading for the restroom.

Inside a locked stall, she pulled out her phone. She opened her chat with Takashi Yamamoto.

[Mr. Yamamoto, I heard you’ve connected with my brother. Yet I understand you haven’t begun his lessons? Please, let me know if there is anything I can assist with.]

The reply was instant.

[Victoria, my admiration for you remains. Since our encounter in Westhaven, you are all I can think of.]

Victoria’s lip curled in distaste. [Your flattery is noted, Mr. Yamamoto. But I am to be married soon. We can, however, remain… good friends.]
###Chapter 388

Takashi Yamamoto's message glowed on the screen. [Don't worry. I have no intention of disrupting your wedding. I simply desire five photographs of you. Similar in nature to the one that gained such notoriety.]

Victoria Kensington's face paled. Her mind flashed back to the leaked nude. The viral scandal. A cold dread seized her.

She could still feel the stares. Everywhere she went. Burning into her. Some men even had the audacity to ask for more. Those images were a permanent stain. A brand on her reputation. They would follow her forever.

And now Takashi wanted his own private collection? He had to be joking.

She was finally marrying Alexander Whitmore. Her wedding was so close. Why was he demanding these photos? Photos that could obliterate everything she had built.

Her fingers trembled as she typed a reply. [Mr. Yamamoto, I must apologize. I am to be married. This is simply impossible. Please. Ask for anything else.]

His response was immediate. Cold. [I want nothing else. If you cannot provide this, then our arrangement is terminated.]

Terminated?

No. He couldn't do that.

This deal was everything. Her entire plan hinged on using Takashi to control Benjamin. To secure the remaining family shares. It was the most critical piece. The cornerstone of her strategy.

She typed frantically. [Mr. Yamamoto, there must be another way I can repay you. Please, reconsider. My brother idolizes you. He dreams of learning from you.]

His answer was a lesson in cruelty. [There are no free meals in this world, Ms. Kensington. I'm certain a woman of your standing understands that basic principle?]

[I understand perfectly,] she wrote back, desperation clawing at her. [Name your price. Anything else I can offer. Let us negotiate.]

[I lack for nothing,] he replied. [I merely admire your… beauty. Do not fear. I swear a solemn oath. I shall never leak the images. If I break this vow, may lightning strike me. May my future crumble to dust. May I never father a child.]

Victoria read the deadly vow. Her fierce glare softened slightly. The words were persuasive.

The last leak was Charmine's fault. Isabella's doing. This was different. Takashi just wanted a private collection. A personal trophy. And he had sworn such a severe oath…

Another message arrived. [I will be frank with you, Ms. Kensington. I possess a collection. Photos of other female celebrities. If any of it were ever exposed, my own reputation would be utterly destroyed.]

[It is merely a hobby. I enjoy collecting images of beautiful women. Send me the photos, and I will speak to Benjamin. I will teach him my finest techniques. He may even come to study with me in Westhaven.]

Study with me in Westhaven.

The words captured her complete attention. If Benjamin left… her plan would proceed flawlessly. She had already begun to win back a sliver of Alexander's affection. Securing more shares would be the ultimate victory.

Her eyes darkened as they lingered on the screen. A decision solidified within her.

[Very well,] she typed. [I will send them now.]

Approximately ten minutes later, Victoria emerged from the washroom.

Alexander had already settled the bill. "Let's go," he said, his tone flat. "I will take you home."

"Of course. Thank you, my dear Alexander." Her voice was sugar and submission.

He looked at her, this picture of meek devotion. "Do not trouble yourself with the online rumors," he reassured her. "I have taken care of everything. Your only task is to prepare to be my beautiful bride."

Victoria nodded, a shy, demure gesture. With Alexander handling the scandal, her scheme was safe. Once those photos of Isabella and Nathaniel were revealed, McKenzie and Nathaniel's parents would make Isabella's life a living hell.

At Rosewood Manor…

Isabella Montgomery was sketching a new design when her phone vibrated. She answered promptly. "Hello?"

"Ms. Montgomery? This is the Westhaven Memorial Gardens. Due to recent restructuring within the cemetery, we are required to relocate the remains of Ms. Genevieve Beaumont. May I inquire as to when you might be available to come and oversee the process?"

Isabella's brow furrowed. When she first returned to Westchester, she had visited Genevieve's grave. But her work had consumed her since. She had not found the time to return.

Genevieve was the only one who had shown her genuine kindness during her years with the Montgomerys. She needed to see this for herself.

"Understood," Isabella replied, her voice firm. "I will be there shortly."

Outside, the sun beat down relentlessly. A single cloud drifted across its face, offering a moment of reprieve. In that temporary shadow, the plot continued its inexorable unraveling.
###Chapter 389

When Victoria returned to Montgomery Manor...

Eleanor hurried to meet her, concern etched on her face. "Victoria, how was it? Did you find a gown you love? Is everything alright?"

"Mmm... yes..." Victoria's lips trembled slightly. She looked dejected but managed a weak smile. "Don't worry, Mother. I'm fine... Just exhausted. I need to rest."

"Alright." Eleanor studied her daughter closely, sensing something was wrong.

After Victoria retreated to her room, Eleanor summoned Penelope. "What happened? She seems upset."

"Oh, it's n-nothing, Madam! Really, nothing at all..." Penelope shook her head vigorously, but her expression betrayed her words.

"Tell me everything immediately," Eleanor demanded, "or I'll find Victoria a more competent assistant."

"Madam, no! I want to serve Ms. Victoria! I'll tell you... I'll tell you now!" With a frightened look, Penelope lowered her head and stammered, "W-We went to choose the wedding gown today. They only had ready-made designs, nothing custom. Ms. Victoria found one she adored, but it cost a million dollars. Mr. Whitmore said she shouldn't pick such an expensive gown and told her to choose another...

"Also, Madam Whitmore has repeatedly told Ms. Victoria that marrying Alexander is a blessing. She warned her not to demand too much and to be more accommodating...!"

"Penelope! Stop lying!" A sharp voice interrupted from above.

Victoria rushed down the stairs and sat beside Eleanor. "Mother, please don't listen to Penelope... None of that happened! The Whitmores treat me wonderfully, and Alexander is very good to me. Penelope invented all of that... S-She made it up..."

Despite her reassurances, Victoria's voice grew hoarse, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Eleanor's heart ached at her daughter's distress. "Nonsense! How dare they treat you like that? You're our precious daughter, not someone for them to belittle! Stop defending them, Victoria. We're going to have a serious conversation with them right now!"

Eleanor grabbed Victoria's hand, ready to leave.

Victoria resisted, clutching her mother's hand tightly. "Mother, no, please don't! My reputation is ruined. Marrying Alexander truly is my greatest blessing. I'm genuinely happy. Besides, you know how profit-driven people like the Whitmores are. Now that I've left modeling, I earn nothing and only have a small share of family stocks. What more can someone like me possibly ask for?

"Alexander is willing to accept me, willing to marry me. That's already more than I deserve. I don't need anything else. Please, Mother, don't make things difficult for them."

Her tone was soft, weak, understanding, and humble.

Eleanor felt a pang of pity and gradually calmed down. She had noticed the Whitmores' condescending attitude during wedding preparations but had restrained herself from confronting them.

She never imagined they would still mistreat Victoria!

After all, Victoria was her own daughter—the apple of her eye since childhood. How could the Whitmores treat her so poorly? At that moment, Eleanor made a decision. Gently, she said, "Victoria, I'm glad you're so understanding. Go rest now. I have some matters to attend to."

"Alright, don't overwork yourself," Victoria said caringly before leaving with Penelope. "Don't speak behind my back again!" Victoria scolded Penelope sternly.

"Okay..."
###Chapter 390

Victoria watched Eleanor and Ronnie ascend the staircase.

She rose from her seat immediately.

Her footsteps carried her toward the first-floor study.

Richard was inside, organizing a stack of documents.

She entered without knocking. “Richard. We need to talk. I want to give Victoria our twenty-five percent shares.”

They originally held twenty percent. After the wedding incident, they had seized an additional five percent from Victoria.

That left Victoria with a mere five percent.

Richard’s face darkened instantly. “Have you lost your mind? Give her all our shares? I might have agreed before, but consider her recent actions!”

First, the nude photo scandal. Then, her scheme against the top supermodels. It got worse. She seduced the man who was nearly her brother-in-law. And now, a pregnancy-forced marriage. She had brought endless shame to the Montgomery name.

“I know she’s made mistakes,” Eleanor sighed. “But she’s apologized. She’s been punished. Her only desire now is to marry Alexander and find happiness. She’s carrying a child. She won’t act recklessly anymore.”

She continued, her voice tightening. “Do you know how the Whitmores are treating her? They’re treating this wedding like a joke. She’s still the daughter we raised, despite everything. She’s always supported you with the business. She was the most considerate of our children. Now the Whitmores are bullying her because of her past and her tiny five percent share! If this is how they treat her before the marriage, what happens after?”

Tears streamed down Eleanor’s cheeks. As a woman, she understood the pain of being undervalued. She had endured her own hardships when she married into the Montgomery family. She refused to let her daughter suffer the same fate.

Richard’s expression remained grim. “You’re not entirely wrong. I’ve considered that too… But every time I remember her plotting against those models, how she lied to us with those pitiful acts, it sends a chill down my spine. You were there when she claimed she was happy for Isabella. Look what she did behind her back. She slept with Alexander. She conspired to steal Isabella’s assets. Now I can’t distinguish her truths from her lies.”

Outside the door, Victoria listened, her fists clenched. Were they really going to deny her everything because of past errors?

She had been obedient lately. She had followed all their rules. She had even helped Richard resolve several company crises. Wasn’t that enough to atone for her mistakes?

Were her own parents refusing to help her when she was being mistreated?

Back in the study, Eleanor felt a sharp pang in her heart. After a long silence, she spoke. “She’s pregnant now. I believe, for the baby’s sake, she will mature and learn from her errors. Regardless, I won’t let the Whitmores destroy her!”

“Don’t worry. I am her father. The wedding is in two days. We still have time to discuss this,” Richard said, his tone placating.

Victoria’s face contorted with fury. Discuss? What was there to discuss? They simply didn’t want to give her the shares!

They were this critical of her without knowing she was adopted. What would they do if they found out?

Knowing Isabella, the truth would eventually surface. Victoria needed those shares now. Her eyes turned dangerously dark.
###Chapter 391

Richard Montgomery stood organizing files in his study. He rose to pour himself a drink. His cigarette accidentally dropped onto the expensive carpet. It immediately began smoldering.

He tried stamping out the small flame. But it spread rapidly instead. The fire quickly consumed everything flammable around it. Wooden furniture. Bookshelves. Piles of documents. Even the heavy drapes.

“Help!” Richard shouted desperately. “Fire! Somebody help!”

He suddenly remembered an critical contract hidden in the shelves. Three months of relentless negotiations would be destroyed. He had to save it.

Richard charged through the flames toward the shelf. His sleeve caught fire. The heat seared his skin.

“Aargh!”

He cried out in agony and stumbled back. Frantically, he beat at his burning clothing.

The contract was moments from being incinerated. It would be lost forever.

Suddenly, a slender figure burst into the room.

“Father, get out!” Someone shoved him forcefully into the hallway. The figure dashed past him into the inferno.

It was Victoria!

Victoria actually ran into the burning study!

“Victoria! Come back! Get out!” Richard yelled while extinguishing his sleeve.

She ignored his shouts completely.

Flames engulfed the entire room. Bookshelves groaned and collapsed around her. Burning volumes crashed at her feet.

She pushed forward relentlessly. Her target was the deepest shelf.

Victoria snatched the contract from its hiding place. She also grabbed the laptop from the desk.

A massive bookshelf cracked loudly overhead. It plummeted directly toward her.

“Victoria!” Richard screamed. He tried rushing back inside.

But it was too late. The heavy shelf slammed down onto Victoria with crushing force.

“Argh!”

She was pinned beneath the burning wreckage.

Maids finally arrived with fire extinguishers. They battled the blaze furiously. Several minutes passed before the last ember died.

Richard and the staff heaved the shelf off her. Victoria’s clothes were charred. Soot blackened her face. Deep cuts marred her arms.

Yet she lay protectively cradling the contract and laptop. Despite her severe injuries, the documents were completely unharmed.

Richard’s eyes stung with emotion. “Victoria! Why… why would you be so reckless?!”

“My Victoria! Oh, my poor girl!” Eleanor Kensington helped lift Victoria from the debris. She carried her out carefully.

Victoria moaned painfully as consciousness flickered. She lay limp in Eleanor’s arms, dazed and confused. Her voice emerged as a strained whisper. “The contract… Father’s contract…”

Though barely audible, her sole concern was the document.

Eleanor’s heart clenched at the raw worry in her voice. “The contract is safe. You saved it,” she soothed. “Don’t speak now… The doctor is coming.” Victoria relaxed hearing this. Her eyes fluttered shut as darkness took her.
###Chapter 392

"Victoria...? Victoria?! Doctor! Someone get a doctor!" Eleanor screamed in pure panic.

Medical staff rushed into the room immediately. After a thorough examination, the lead physician announced, "She's extremely fortunate to have received immediate medical attention. Any delay could have resulted in severe burns. She has a minor spinal fracture, but considering the circumstances, it could have been fatal. Her survival is nothing short of miraculous."

Richard and Eleanor both collapsed into nearby chairs, overwhelmed with relief.

Just then, Benjamin's excited call came through. "Father! I'm going to Westhaven! Takashi Yamamoto himself agreed to train me! He said he'll make me the next gaming champion! I'll leave right after my sister's wedding ceremony. I'll return as a champion and make our family proud!"

Richard's expression darkened instantly. Westhaven? Now of all times?

While he was drowning in corporate responsibilities and family affairs, his son wanted to chase gaming dreams in Westhaven?

"Are you deliberately trying to provoke me?" Richard's voice turned icy. "Do you have any awareness of our current situation? Your sister is holding our company together while you, a grown man, waste your life on games! What could possibly be going through that empty head of yours?"

"What's wrong with pursuing gaming? It's a legitimate career path! Do you think traditional business is the only way to succeed? I'll bring honor to the Kensington name! You'll all regret underestimating me!" Benjamin ended the call abruptly.

The dial tone echoed in the silent room. Richard's face contorted with fury. "Useless! Absolutely worthless!" he roared. "What did I do to deserve such a failure of a son?"

"Unbelievable!" Eleanor seethed, her anger palpable. "He keeps sinking lower every day! Not only is he addicted to those ridiculous games, but now he's abandoning us for Westhaven? We never should have had him! He's nothing like Victoria—not even comparable!"

She paused, watching Victoria's unconscious form on the hospital bed. "Richard, we can't rely on Benjamin anymore, and Isabella isn't our biological daughter. We should transfer our shares to Victoria. She promised to continue managing the company even after marrying Alexander, and we know she's capable. If we transfer the shares now, they'll be considered pre-marriage assets, so they'll remain solely hers rather than becoming marital property."

After a long silence, Richard glanced at the fire-damaged document that had miraculously survived intact. "Very well," he agreed finally.

Victoria lay perfectly still, internally celebrating her triumphant success.

At long last... She had done it!

Meanwhile...

Isabella sat in the luxury vehicle with Nathaniel and Oliver heading toward Southern Cemetery. Both father and son had insisted on accompanying her despite her initial objections, leaving her no choice but to accept their presence.

As they neared the cemetery grounds, Isabella received a text from Maxwell: [Ms. Montgomery, numerous reporters have surrounded Southern Cemetery. They're positioned to capture photos of you and Mr. Blackwood together.]

Isabella's brow furrowed. Had this been a setup all along?

Was someone deliberately trying to photograph her and Nathaniel together?

Was Vivienne behind this again?

Her eyes narrowed dangerously as she turned to Nathaniel. "Stay in the car with the curtains drawn. I'll go alone."

Nathaniel saw the message on her phone screen. "We're already here, and she was important to you. It's only proper that we pay our respects together."

"Yes! I want to meet Mommy's aunt! I brought flowers for her!" Oliver added enthusiastically, clutching a bouquet.

Isabella hesitated. "But the reporters... I'm not ready to publicize our relationship yet."

"Don't worry," Nathaniel assured her with his characteristically firm tone as the car came to a stop. "I'll handle this."

He opened the door and stepped out before she could stop him.

Isabella's heart raced. What was he planning? With so many reporters watching, was Nathaniel about to officially reveal their relationship to the world?
###Chapter 393

Isabella's mind raced with chaotic thoughts.

Nathaniel had already circled the car to her side.

He opened the passenger door for her.

She remained frozen in her seat, studying him cautiously.

"Nathaniel," she said, her voice laced with warning. "You know I'm not ready for them to find out yet."

His gaze remained steady and unyielding.

"Trust me," he insisted, his tone firm yet reassuring.

Hesitation flickered across her features before she finally relented.

She stepped out of the vehicle, deciding to take the leap of faith.

His calm demeanor provided a strange sense of security.

He had asked for her trust, and she would give him that chance.

She wondered how he would handle the situation with the paparazzi reportedly swarming the area.

The hidden photographers gaped in disbelief at the sight before them.

They had received tips about Isabella Montgomery arriving at Southern Cemetery with Nathaniel Blackwood.

Yet they had dismissed it as false information until this moment.

The reality left them stunned.

Nathaniel Blackwood was indeed involved with Isabella Montgomery!

Their interactions suggested deep affection between them.

Cameras immediately began clicking from various angles.

Some photographers shot from the sides, others from behind.

A few bold ones even captured frontal shots despite the risk.

The sweltering heat became irrelevant in their excitement.

Isabella walked beside Nathaniel toward the cemetery entrance.

Oliver trailed slightly behind them on his short legs.

His large, observant eyes scanned their surroundings carefully.

After a moment, he spoke softly. "Daddy, eleven o'clock. Nine paparazzi behind the bushes. That's most of them."

Nathaniel showed no reaction to this information.

Instead, he took Isabella's hand and placed it firmly on his arm.

She lowered her voice. "Nathaniel, what are you doing?"

This posture clearly signaled their relationship status.

He offered no explanation as he guided her toward the eleven o'clock direction.

The paparazzi could hardly believe their luck.

This close-range shot with her hand on his arm was headline gold.

These photos could fuel gossip columns for months.

They snapped away furiously, caught up in their excitement.

Nathaniel suddenly stopped directly before the concealed bushes.

His expression turned icy as he stood with Isabella beside him.

"You have one minute to surrender your memory cards," he stated coldly. "Otherwise, I'll take them myself."

His authoritative voice carried undeniable weight.

The atmosphere grew thick with tension.

The hidden photographers trembled with sudden fear.

Nathaniel Blackwood had discovered them—he knew exactly where they were.

But surrendering their memory cards? After hiding all day for these exclusive shots?

The thought was unbearable.

Nathaniel raised his wrist, checking his watch with clouded, dominant eyes.

He spoke to Dominic who stood behind them. "Clear them out."

"Yes, sir!" Dominic immediately pulled out his phone.

The photographers behind the bushes shook with terror.

Some actually wet their pants in fear.

'Clear them out'? What did that mean?

Were they going to be fed to sharks? Or perhaps wolves?

They had forgotten who they were dealing with—the king of Westchester.

No media outlet had ever successfully published details about his private life.

Trying to publish these photos was equivalent to declaring war against him.

And everyone knew what happened to those who opposed Nathaniel Blackwood.

Instantly, one photographer scrambled out and handed over his memory card.
###Chapter 394

“Mr. Blackwood, this was a terrible mistake! I swear it won’t happen again! Everything is on this SD card—take it! Please, just let me go!”

“Have mercy, Mr. Blackwood! Here’s my memory card—no, take the whole camera! It’s yours!”

“Me too! I didn’t see or capture anything, I promise! I’m leaving right now!”

Trembling, the paparazzi scrambled to pile their SD cards on the ground. Fear of being “taken care of” drove them to abandon their equipment and stumble backward in a panic.

Nathaniel watched their frantic retreat, his voice cold. “Did I say you could leave?”

He wasn’t letting them go.

Terror seized them. Some dropped to their knees, begging desperately.

“Please, Mr. Blackwood, I’ve learned my lesson! I have a family depending on me! Spare me!”

“I swear to heaven, I’ll never take another photo of you. I’ll quit this job today!”

“Me too! Take my eyes, beat me—do whatever you want! Just let me live… I don’t want to die!”

Each one pleaded for their life.

Isabella was stunned. Nathaniel had only spoken a few words, yet they were all kneeling and begging? What had he done in the past to inspire such fear?

She didn’t even have that kind of power.

Calm and detached, Nathaniel studied the group. “Who sent you?”

The question surprised them.

Was he stopping them just to ask that? Did it mean they might be spared if they talked?

One answered instantly. “It was Harrison Caldwell! Alexander Whitmore’s assistant! Alexander set this up!”

“Yes! He’s engaged to Victoria, yet he’s still trying to interfere with your relationship! He’s despicable!”

“He won’t let his ex move on while he parades his engagement? It’s outrageous! We were fools to help him! Don’t worry, Mr. Blackwood, we’ll never do it again.”

“You and your wife enjoy your time. We’ll never take another photo! Never!”

Nathaniel’s icy expression softened slightly. The oppressive atmosphere lifted. “Dig up every piece of dirt on Alexander Whitmore,” he commanded. “Keep it in the headlines until his wedding day.”

Shock rippled through the group. It took a moment to process. Was Mr. Blackwood sparing them? Giving them a chance to redeem themselves?

They nodded eagerly. “Yes, sir! We’ll get right on it!”

With that, they scrambled away as if death was seconds behind them.

Isabella couldn’t suppress a smile. Being with Nathaniel had its perks! They could walk anywhere publicly, and no one would dare photograph or even glance their way twice!

The thought filled her with gratitude. She felt even more certain of her choice. Once she dealt with Victoria, she would help him find the woman from his past. He deserved peace.

She also needed to find Sebastian Blackwood. That monster would pay for what he did. She would never let her rapist escape justice. Never.

Lost in thought, she barely noticed they had reached Genevieve’s grave. Isabella placed the flowers and fruit before the headstone. She smiled softly, speaking silently. ‘Don’t worry, Aunt Genevieve. The last five years were hell, but I’ve found happiness now. I’ll destroy the man who ruined me. He and Victoria will get what they deserve. If you can hear me, haunt Sebastian Blackwood for me…’

She quickly reconsidered. “No, forget I said that. Rest peacefully, Aunt Genevieve. You gave your life protecting my childhood. I’ll take care of myself now.”

Nathaniel watched Isabella pray. His eyes darkened slightly. He sensed not sorrow, but a cold, brutal fury radiating from her.
###Chapter 395

Isabella Montgomery stood upright after paying her respects at Genevieve Beaumont's grave. Memories of the woman's unwavering kindness and protection during her childhood flooded her mind. Isabella made a silent vow. She would resolve all outstanding issues and build a life with Nathaniel. Genevieve deserved to rest in peace, free from worry.

Nathaniel Blackwood and Christopher placed floral tributes with solemn reverence. Their research indicated Genevieve had shown Isabella exceptional kindness, caring for her for eight years. Tragedy struck when eight-year-old Isabella fell into a raging river. Genevieve saved the child but was tragically pulled under by the strong current and drowned. This incident drastically worsened Isabella's life within the Montgomery household. She was universally blamed for bringing misfortune upon the family.

Nathaniel's gaze remained fixed on the headstone. 'Rest assured. I will protect Isabella.'

Recent renovations to the cemetery grounds meant other visitors were present. A man dressed entirely in black was tending a grave several meters away. Appearing to be in his fifties, he wore a tailored black suit, his hair neatly tied back. His movements were deliberate, almost languid, and he seemed completely at ease, undisturbed by their presence.

Isabella noticed him but dismissed him as irrelevant.

Her phone vibrated. It was Maxwell Carter. "Ms. Montgomery, Victoria orchestrated a fire to rescue Richard. She also arranged for Takashi Yamamoto to train Benjamin in Westhaven. Richard and Eleanor have already transferred their twenty-five percent company shares to her. Theodore Montgomery approved the transaction!"

Isabella's eyes narrowed. Victoria was moving faster than anticipated. Her plan was finally in motion.

This development meant Victoria now held thirty percent of the Montgomery shares, having acquired twenty-five from Richard and Eleanor. Isabella personally held twenty-five percent. Theodore also retained thirty percent. This placed Victoria on equal footing with Theodore, granting her matching authority within the company!

If anything were to happen to Theodore, Victoria would effectively gain control of the entire corporation…

A dark shadow crossed Isabella's features.

Standing beside her, Christopher tilted his head. "Mommy, that bad woman isn't even a real Montgomery. Why can't you just make her leave? Those shares should be yours!"

His words pulled Isabella from her dark thoughts. She knelt to his eye level. "You're still young, my love. Some matters are complex. Reclaiming shares is straightforward. Winning back loyalty and affection is the true challenge. Victoria lived as a Montgomery for twenty-three years. Even knowing she isn't their blood, their hearts may not readily accept me. These things require patience. But it will conclude soon. She has made her opening move. I hope she is prepared for the consequences!"

A cold, determined glint hardened Isabella's eyes.

The middle-aged man, still within earshot, overheard the exchange. His expression darkened slightly. Her words echoed in his mind: 'Victoria lived as a Montgomery for twenty-three years. Even knowing she isn't their blood…!'

She was not the actual daughter…

Not the actual daughter…

Isabella departed with Nathaniel and Christopher. The man remained, deeply contemplative. He watched their retreating figures with a grave and intense focus.

A bodyguard approached him cautiously. "Sir, shall we proceed with the investigation? If their claims are verified, should we arrange for Madam's immediate return?"

"Patience. If it is indeed her… a marriage is impending. We must gather more intelligence before we act," the middle-aged man instructed, his voice low and measured.

"Understood, Sir." The bodyguard withdrew.

After finalizing the necessary cemetery paperwork, Isabella, Nathaniel, and Christopher prepared to leave. Given the likely schemes of Alexander Whitmore and Vivienne Delacroix, returning to the safety of the estate was paramount.

Nathaniel's phone rang as they settled into the car. A panicked shareholder's voice came through the speaker. "Mr. Blackwood, urgent situation! Critical issues have emerged with the outreach initiative. Immediate intervention is required!"

Nathaniel's composed demeanor shifted, a storm of emotions brewing beneath the surface. This project had run smoothly for three years. Why would catastrophic problems arise so abruptly?

"Convene a meeting in thirty minutes." He ended the call and turned to Isabella. "Please take Oliver home directly. I must go to the corporate office immediately."
###Chapter 396

"Alright."

Nathaniel needed to go to the office.

He had spent over two weeks at Rosewood Manor with Isabella, only handling meetings remotely.

Dominic drove Isabella and Oliver back to the manor first.

Then he took Nathaniel to Prestige Builders.

Isabella entered the villa with Oliver.

She saw Benjamin and Victoria sitting on the sofa.

Victoria was speaking to Benjamin in a soft, soothing tone.

Benjamin was nodding diligently at her words.

Isabella frowned.

She looked down at Oliver. "Momo, go upstairs first."

"I want to stay with you, Mommy! I'm a big man. I can protect you," Oliver insisted.

He stepped in front of Isabella, glaring at Victoria.

Victoria's face stiffened.

Had she become a villain in this young master's eyes?

Isabella must have poisoned his mind against her!

She must have been bad-mouthing her behind her back!

Victoria suppressed her anger.

She forced a faint smile. "Oh, Oliver is here too. Auntie didn't know you were visiting. I didn't bring a gift. Don't worry, I'm your Mommy's sister. I won't harm you."

"Hah! Can you even believe your own words? Your voice is so fake and annoying! Shut up! Leave now!" Oliver snapped impatiently.

Victoria's face froze completely.

Her words got stuck in her throat.

Did he just speak to her like that?

He called her...

Isabella didn't want Oliver involved in adult matters.

She gently ruffled his hair. "Momo, be good. Go prepare the rock-climbing gear. Give me five minutes to make her leave, okay?"

"Okay, then," Oliver muttered, pouting.

He still shot a scornful look at Victoria. "Listen, you bad woman! I'm warning you! Don't hurt my Mommy, or my Daddy will make you pay!"

Then he ran upstairs.

Victoria's expression shifted between shock and humiliation.

She was once the top supermodel.

Everyone used to respect and admire her.

Now even a child despised her!

How could a child say such cruel things?

It had to be Isabella.

Isabella must have slandered her behind her back.

She must have ruined her reputation.

Victoria wanted to tear that pretty face to shreds.

But Benjamin was here.

She could only glare at Isabella with reddened eyes.

"Isabella, I've already apologized. Can't you forgive me? Why are you turning a child against me?"

"Hah! Slander? Are you even worth my time?" Isabella rolled her eyes.

She turned her cold gaze to Benjamin. "This is my home. Why did you let a stray animal in without my permission?"

"She's not a stray animal! She's our sister!" Benjamin insisted. "Don't forget how she always protected you when we were kids! Why are you two fighting over a man?!"

"Over a man? Benjamin, let's get something straight," Isabella scoffed.

She pulled out her phone and played a video clip.

The footage of Victoria and Alexander in bed appeared instantly.

Victoria's moans filled the room. "Alexander darling, am I prettier? Or is Isabella prettier? Do you like me or her?"

"Alexander darling, I'm just scared you'll fall for her. I'm scared her money and looks will tempt you. I'm terrified you'll stop loving me..."

"Will you still take her assets for me? Will you divorce her and marry me?"

Every word was fake yet seductive.

Her expression in the video was completely different from the pure, innocent face she wore now.

Benjamin jolted.

It was easy to forget how vicious Victoria could be.

Especially when the Victoria standing before them seemed so gentle and kind.

Who would believe she had this side?

Until Isabella showed the video again.
###Chapter 397

Victoria’s face burned with a mix of fury and humiliation.

That incident was ancient history.

Yet Isabella deliberately brought it up in front of Benjamin.

How calculating could she be?

Isabella let out a cold, dismissive laugh. “Benjamin, look closely. She didn’t just steal Alexander from me. She conspired with him to plunder my entire fortune. If this recording hadn't surfaced, I’d be dead by now. They would be in control of all my assets at this very moment.”

“You’re asking me to forgive her? Fine. Answer me this: Have you ever truly forgiven our parents and Grandfather for how they treated you?”

The question struck Benjamin unprepared.

She was right.

He harbored deep resentment for the way his parents and Grandfather had always looked down on him.

What Victoria did to Isabella was far worse.

How could forgiveness even be an option?

If he were in Isabella’s position, having endured all that betrayal, he would have ended them.

Victoria sensed Benjamin’s shifting loyalty instantly.

Tears immediately welled in her eyes and began to stream down her cheeks. “It’s not what it looks like! There are reasons… complicated reasons. I can’t explain them now. Not yet. You’ll understand someday. I promise you will.”

She sobbed pitifully, implying she was burdened by a terrible secret.

She then produced an ornate invitation card and walked slowly toward Isabella.

“Sister,” she began, her voice choked with emotion. “I came here today to personally deliver this to you. I sincerely hope you will attend my wedding to Alexander. I know I’ve wronged you in the past. I will spend the rest of my life making it up to you. Please… we are sisters. I’m begging you to come. Do you know I have no friends left? No one is willing to be my bridesmaid.”

“Mother and Father agreed that you should be the one. They hoped it would help you forgive me. That we could heal our relationship. Please… I’m begging for a chance to make things right.”

Her voice was raw and hoarse from crying. The tears never stopped falling. She performed the picture of utter agony.

Isabella merely responded with another cold scoff. She was about to speak, to refuse, but Victoria forcefully pressed the thick cardstock invitation into her hand.

“Sister, I know you’ll say yes. I choose to believe this world is still beautiful, just like you do. I’ll be expecting you in two days. You have to be there.”

With that, she turned to Benjamin before making her exit. “Be ready, Benjamin. Don’t waste this opportunity. Call me if you need anything…”

Her final words successfully redirected Benjamin’s thoughts to Takashi Yamamoto. A notoriously arrogant and reclusive top-tier gamer like him usually refused all coaching requests. Yet Victoria had somehow convinced him.

Maybe she really was a kind sister at heart.

Perhaps there were hidden reasons for her being with Alexander, just as she hinted…

Benjamin turned back to Isabella. “Isabella, everyone makes mistakes. She’s learned hers. I truly believe she won’t harm you again. You should find it in your heart to forgive her. She’s going to be a mother soon.”

Isabella looked down at the invitation in her hand, her eyes narrowing to slits.

Victoria should be terrified of her showing up at the wedding, fearing she would ruin it.

So why actively invite her? And insist she be a bridesmaid?

Victoria was plotting something. She had to be.

Isabella had no intention of arguing further with Benjamin. She moved to leave when her sharp eyes caught sight of the earphones lying on the sofa.

On the side of one earpiece was a tiny, almost imperceptible dent.

Her gaze instantly turned razor-sharp.

It was a dent specifically caused by the installation of a pinhole camera!

“Who bought you those earphones?” Isabella demanded, her voice sharp.

“Victoria did. She’s very thoughtful. She’s not a bad person. I believe she’s acting under difficult circumstances,” Benjamin attested loyally.

Isabella scoffed in derision.

No wonder Victoria was so desperate for her to attend the wedding.

So that was her game.

It seemed the time for showing any mercy to Victoria was long past.

Victoria slid into the back of her waiting car, leaving Rosewood Manor behind.

The pitiful, weeping mask she wore for Benjamin and Isabella vanished instantly.

It was replaced by a dark, vicious smirk of triumph.

In the palm of her hand, she clutched a tiny pinhole camera.

Hah!

She couldn't wait to see how Isabella would possibly talk her way out of this one.
###Chapter 398

McKenzie's inaction and Julian's failed plan were insignificant now.

She would project photos of Isabella with Nathaniel on a massive screen for the world to see their relationship!

While everyone currently pitied Isabella, how would the public react upon discovering her involvement with Nathaniel all along?

What would they say?

Moreover, McKenzie and the Montgomerys would undoubtedly take action once this news dominated the headlines!

Victoria envisioned it clearly: Isabella and Nathaniel's intimate photos displayed for all guests during her wedding ceremony.

The public would abandon Isabella entirely by then, and the Montgomerys would never forgive her!

Isabella's happiness would be permanently destroyed when that moment arrived!

Time flew by swiftly until the wedding day arrived.

Both the Montgomery and Whitmore families bustled with unprecedented activity.

This ceremony far surpassed the grandeur of Alexander's previous wedding with Isabella.

They had invited nearly every influential figure, and all had accepted.

Alexander also enlisted numerous celebrities and supermodels, striving to make the event unforgettable.

So what if online critics condemned their union?

In their elite circles, wealth and influence always trumped public opinion.

The Whitmores and Montgomerys ranked among the top ten wealthiest families.

Who would dare offend both powerful dynasties?

Their alliance only strengthened their positions.

Although everyone privately scorned the heartless man and his deceitful bride, attendance remained mandatory.

The wedding atmosphere radiated luxury and sophistication.

Inside the bridal suite...

Victoria had completed her makeup.

Eight bridesmaids surrounded her, all her female cousins.

Some appeared charming, others exuded sex appeal, while several maintained elegance.

Their dresses and hairstyles remained deliberately subdued and unremarkable.

This ensured none could overshadow Victoria's radiance.

She stood out brilliantly like the fairest of them all.

This arrangement was orchestrated by the Montgomery family.

They intended to demonstrate their unwavering support for Victoria despite her past mistakes.

They wanted the world to witness their familial loyalty.

Victoria's lips curved into a smirk as she eyed the solitary dress hanging aside.

Isabella would play nothing but a minor role in her wedding!

The smoke-gray dress looked utterly drab.

Anyone wearing it would appear frumpy and unattractive.

Furthermore, all eight bridesmaids possessed their own distinct allure.

How could Isabella possibly outshine them collectively?

The thought of Isabella being ignored filled Victoria with immense satisfaction.

Most importantly, Isabella's secret relationship with Nathaniel would soon explode into public scrutiny.

She would face the internet's furious wrath!

Speaking of Isabella...

She arrived at the hotel precisely then.

She hesitated momentarily, recalling this was where she had been pushed down the staircase years ago.

This was where her reputation had been destroyed.

Yet she proceeded inside.

Since Victoria had planned such dramatic entertainment, how could she miss it?

Besides, exchanging gifts was only polite.

She had prepared an exceptionally generous return present for Victoria!

She opened the car door, preparing to exit when Nathaniel asked, "Are you certain you don't want me accompanying you?"

"Positive. I can handle this alone. Just focus on caring for Christopher." Isabella waved at Oliver before walking away.

She understood Nathaniel's protective instincts.

She needed to resolve matters with Victoria quickly to assist his investigation into the five-year-old incident.

Additionally, Nathaniel's men had found no traces of the Blackthorn Syndicate.

Numerous urgent matters demanded her attention.

Isabella's sharp gaze fixed upon the magnificent Ritz-Carlton Hotel.

Ironically, Tiffany and the Blackthorn Syndicate had orchestrated the tragedy here five years earlier.

Now, five years later, none of them would escape consequences.

Victoria had destroyed her happiness and continued plotting against her even during her own wedding!

It was only fitting that Victoria prepared to have her reputation utterly shredded.

Victoria should ready herself to experience every suffering she had inflicted.
###Chapter 399

Isabella Montgomery strode toward the dressing room from memory.

She found Victoria Kensington surrounded by a flock of bridesmaids.

They chattered around her as if she were the princess she always pretended to be.

Victoria’s smile widened when she saw Isabella. “Sister! You made it. I wanted you as my only bridesmaid, but Grandfather and our parents insisted on more. I suppose it’s better this way. It shows the world how close our family is. I hope you don’t mind?”

Isabella scanned the room with an impassive expression.

The Montgomery family had always been like this.

Theodore Montgomery cared deeply about appearances.

He constantly sought to project an image of family unity.

As long as it didn’t interfere with her plans.

The other women knew Isabella’s reputation.

They fell silent under her gaze.

The air grew thick with tension.

Victoria lifted a solitary dress and offered it to Isabella. “Here, sister. Go change. We’re all waiting. Grandfather asked me to remind you—today’s wedding is crucial for the Montgomerys. We must all behave.”

Her meaning was clear.

If Isabella disrupted the wedding, Theodore would never forgive her.

Isabella eyed the smoky gray gown.

She took it from Victoria’s hands.

So this was Victoria’s plan.

Dress her in this dull, lifeless color and then destroy her reputation.

Victoria was about to learn the true meaning of regret.

It would be a lesson she would never forget.

Isabella entered the dressing room.

The moment the door closed, the eight bridesmaids erupted in whispers.

“Who does she think she is? A bit of money and she acts superior to everyone!”

“Exactly. Victoria is so much nicer. Even at her peak, she never acted like that.”

“What does her arrogance matter? She’s still just a bridesmaid. Alexander is marrying Victoria. She has no one.”

Their voices were hushed but sharp.

Victoria heard every word.

A smug smile touched her lips.

How could Isabella ever compete?

Every Montgomery adored her, not Isabella.

The thought of Isabella standing beside her, overshadowed and insignificant, filled her with glee.

Then… Click.

The door swung open.

Isabella emerged.

Every jaw dropped.

The gray gown featured a deep V-neck that accentuated her swan-like neck.

Drop-shoulder lace sleeves draped elegantly over her slender arms.

Most strikingly, the original tutu-style netting at the hem was gone.

Isabella had removed every layer.

She transformed the cheap, childish dress into a sleek, floor-length gown.

Delicate lace overlay added sophistication.

The smoky gray hue enhanced her cool, commanding presence.

Isabella didn’t wear the dress—she elevated it.

Whatever she touched turned to gold.

Victoria’s face froze.

How was this possible?

She had chosen the ugliest design on purpose.

The sleeves were meant to look like bat wings.

The tutu skirt was cheap and ridiculous.

How did Isabella alter it so quickly?

The other bridesmaids scowled.

They were all stuck wearing the identical tutu dresses.

Isabella had changed hers deliberately.

She wanted to stand out.

She wanted all attention on her.

Victoria couldn’t tolerate it.

She turned to the others. “Leave us. I need to speak with my sister alone.”

They filed out without question.

The door shut behind them.

Isabella and Victoria were alone.
###Chapter 400

Victoria’s gaze turned icy as she stared down Isabella. “You planned this all along, didn’t you? You’re just desperate for attention!”

“What if I am?” Isabella replied, her voice dripping with cold indifference.

Victoria hadn’t expected such a blunt admission. Her expression tightened, fists clenching. “Do you really think that will work? Mother and Father have already transferred their shares to me. I now hold thirty percent of the Montgomery family’s stock—far more than you! I’m their favorite daughter. Even if you reveal your true identity, no one will care!”

“And?” Isabella remained unshaken.

‘And?’ Was that all she had to say? How could she be so arrogantly dismissive?

Victoria shot to her feet, hatred burning in her eyes. “You’ve lost to me! Alexander is marrying me! Our parents adore me! Aside from Grandfather, I hold the most shares in this family! Me!”

“No matter how stunning or captivating you look today, you’ll always play second fiddle. You. Have. Lost.”

Victoria enunciated each word with venomous clarity, radiating superiority.

Isabella merely smirked. “You know, you look just like a flustered peacock right now.”

Steam practically billowed from Victoria’s ears.

She wanted to strangle Isabella. She wanted to wipe that smug look off her face forever.

Suddenly, a knock echoed at the door. Eleanor’s concerned voice followed. “Victoria, are you in there? Open up, darling—I’ve brought you that diamond necklace you wanted.”

Victoria’s expression shifted instantly. A triumphant smile curled her lips. “Hear that, Isabella? I’m still Mother’s favorite. I merely mentioned wanting a Cadisen diamond necklace, and here she is with it!”

“You call me a peacock? Look at you—a pathetic orphan trying too hard to be relevant.”

She turned away haughtily, her diamond heels clicking against the floor as she strode toward the door. Every movement oozed elegance and conceit.

Outside stood Eleanor and Richard. As soon as Eleanor saw Victoria, she fastened the dazzling diamond necklace around her daughter’s neck. “You were right, my dear. This wedding gown needed something extraordinary. Now it’s perfect.”

Cadisen was a world-renowned luxury diamond brand, famous for its exclusive, top-tier gems and exorbitant prices. If an ordinary jeweler sold a diamond for $100,000, Cadisen would price it at ten million! Their pieces were status symbols, notorious for their exclusivity and cost.

This particular necklace was a limited edition masterpiece, valued at fifty million dollars.

Witnessing the Montgomery family’s lavish treatment of Victoria—and knowing she held the majority of shares—even Margaret Whitmore stepped forward to praise her. “Victoria looks absolutely radiant in that necklace! No wonder she’s the Montgomery family’s most treasured daughter. It’s no surprise my son is so taken with her!”

“Of course,” Eleanor beamed with pride. “Victoria, darling, if you need anything else, just say the word. I’ll make sure you have it.”

“Your father supports you unconditionally, too,” Richard added.

Everyone gathered around Victoria, showering her with compliments and support. Standing at the center of it all, she cast a look of sheer arrogance and vanity toward Isabella.

So what if her reputation had been tarnished? She was still the favored daughter. She was the one marrying Alexander! She was their parents’ favorite! Isabella was nothing but a pitiful, irrelevant nobody.
###Chapter 401

Isabella Montgomery stood alone in the room.

Her presence was completely ignored by both the Montgomerys and the Whitmores.

During Isabella’s engagement celebration, neither Eleanor nor Richard had come to see her.

They hadn't even bothered to participate in the wedding preparations.

They sent staff to handle everything.

To them, their 'real' daughter Victoria was the most important.

No matter how many mistakes Victoria made.

She was still their true daughter.

Isabella was just the adopted one.

The rebellious child since childhood.

But Isabella stayed calm.

She was used to this treatment for as long as she could remember.

Isabella rolled her eyes and walked out calmly.

When Richard and Eleanor noticed her, they both flinched slightly.

Since when had Isabella been in there?

Why hadn't they realized she was present?

Eleanor quickly recovered and forced a smile.

“I’m glad you’re here! You sisters should be kind to each other.”

“Especially now that Victoria is pregnant. You should be extra gentle with her.”

“The past is the past, Isabella. Behave yourself today,” Richard warned.

Isabella scoffed inwardly.

Had anyone ever said such things to Victoria?

She had done nothing, yet she was told to behave?

They were being overly protective of Victoria.

Afraid she might get hurt?

Hah!

She could only imagine how they would feel when Victoria’s true nature was exposed later.

Isabella offered a faint smile.

“Don’t worry. I’m aware she’s pregnant.”

“I’ll be on my best behavior toward her.”

Her words carried a hidden meaning.

Victoria felt a chill of fear.

But she reminded herself the wedding was about to happen.

What could Isabella possibly do now?

Besides, the baby in her stomach wasn’t…

Only Oliver knew about this.

And Oliver wouldn’t dare expose her.

Victoria wanted to strip every bit of happiness from Isabella.

At that moment, a mocking voice cut through the air.

“Hmph. I thought no one would attend the wedding of a heartless jerk and a fake witch.”

“But I’m surprised so many people showed up!”

“Why make such a big deal out of this?”

“Can’t you just sign the papers and be done with it?”

“I’m embarrassed to be related to you!”

Victoria recoiled in shock.

How dare anyone speak to her like that?!

Both families turned to see a man in black pants and a burgundy shirt.

He looked disheveled and full of scorn.

It was Adrian Sinclair.

He was the son of the Sinclair family.

Victoria’s cousin.

The nephew of Richard and Eleanor.

Eleanor instantly scowled.

“Adrian! How could you be so rude?”

“Victoria is your cousin! Don’t believe those rumors online!”

“I think people know how to tell truth from lies.”

“Isabella was with Alexander for eighteen years. How is that fake news?”

“And all the terrible things Victoria did—could those be fake?” Adrian stated loudly.

He looked at everyone with contempt.

“If I had a son and daughter like them, I’d beat them to death out of shame.”

“How can you all make such a spectacle of this wedding?”

“Aren’t you aware how ridiculous this is?”

Adrian’s words were sharp and insulting.

The two families glared furiously.

Especially Victoria.

Her face turned pale with rage.
###Chapter 402

Victoria knew most wedding guests despised her.

She could tolerate their hidden contempt as long as they maintained surface politeness.

Once she and Alexander were officially married, she would become Mrs. Whitmore.

Wife of the president of Whitmore Enterprises!

That wretched Adrian had to openly voice such cutting remarks.

His harsh words stabbed at her pride relentlessly.

Seeing Victoria's eyes welling up, Eleanor quickly grasped her hand.

She shot Adrian a furious glare. "What right do you have to judge her? Everyone makes mistakes. She's acknowledged hers and vowed to change. Why must you dredge up the past?"

"Exactly! You call my son heartless, but do you know how hard he tried to win Isabella back? She's the one who rejected him repeatedly! She probably spread those vile rumors online herself!"

Though Madam Whitmore scolded Adrian, her accusing gaze remained fixed on Isabella.

Anyone would assume Isabella orchestrated the rumors out of spite.

The implication made Isabella's blood boil.

Did they truly believe she had nothing better to do?

Alexander had threatened her via text.

Now Madam Whitmore publicly shamed her.

What made them think she cared enough to sabotage their wedding?

Before she could respond, Richard chastised Adrian. "Stop causing trouble! This is your cousin's wedding day. You've achieved nothing yourself. Look in the mirror before criticizing others!"

Everyone in Westchester knew Adrian was a worthless playboy.

His arrogance had landed his parents in the hospital.

He'd been rightfully disowned by the Kensington family.

A flicker of malice crossed Victoria's eyes before she adopted a wounded expression.

"Please don't scold Adrian. He means well. Perhaps we were wrong to make this wedding so extravagant. I don't deserve such a grand celebration..."

She dabbed at fake tears with her delicate fingers.

Her performance successfully manipulated the crowd.

Eleanor patted her hand comfortingly. "Nonsense! Even ex-convicts deserve second chances. Your past mistakes don't define you. Don't overthink it."

"But Adrian is right. We should scale back the festivities." Victoria turned to Adrian with feigned gratitude. "Thank you for your advice. I agree completely. However... as you see, all the guests are here. Everything is prepared. We can't cancel now. If you had concerns, you should have voiced them earlier. I would have listened."

Her words subtly implied he was too late to object.

Adrian nearly exploded at her blatant hypocrisy.

Victoria continued her act of false benevolence. "Regardless, I appreciate your concern. If you need anything—career opportunities, housing assistance—please let me know. I'll help however I can."

She deliberately highlighted his unemployment and homelessness.

Eleanor glared disapprovingly. "Victoria, don't be foolish! He was disowned for being useless! Why help someone who just insulted you?"

"Exactly! He's twenty-five and still mooches off friends daily! Any money given to him would be wasted! And after his rudeness! Your kindness is misplaced!" Richard added angrily.

Victoria shook her head meekly. "Please don't say that. I'm sure Adrian has hidden talents. How about this: you gave me a factory for my birthday last year. Let Adrian manage it. We can guide him through the process. Family should support each other."

She sounded impeccably gracious and considerate.

No one knew the factory was already bankrupt and drowning in debt.
###Chapter 403

This particular factory was the least valuable asset owned by the Montgomery family.

It specialized in crafting architectural scale models for the Montgomery Group.

Richard had initially handed this factory over to Victoria as a test of her capabilities.

She endured six grueling months there, learning the ropes through sheer perseverance.

Since their output was limited to real estate models, the annual dividends were pitifully low.

They barely scraped past two hundred thousand dollars each year.

Victoria had long wanted to rid herself of this burden.

Yet she played the generous benefactor, offering it up with false magnanimity.

Adrian’s eye twitched in irritation.

Did she genuinely think he was destitute?

Did he appear to be in need of her charitable donations?

“That factory was a gift to you!” Richard snapped, cutting Adrian off before he could speak.

“How could you even consider giving it away?”

“Especially to this worthless fool who can’t even stand by his own family…”

“He attempted to sabotage the wedding! He deserves nothing from you!”

“Father, I only want Adrian to find his footing and build a proper career,” Victoria pleaded, her voice dripping with feigned concern.

“Absolutely not! You’re being far too kind-hearted!” Eleanor protested vehemently.

Adrian finally lost his patience.

He let out a derisive scoff.

“Hold on. Just stop right there.”

“Which one of your eyes sees me begging for charity?”

“Which ear heard me ask for that pathetic factory?”

“That place barely brings in three hundred thousand a year.”

“Aren’t you ashamed to make such a grand gesture out of nothing?”

His tone was laced with open mockery.

Victoria lowered her head, adopting a wounded expression.

“Adrian, I… I only wanted to help.”

“This is the only asset I have to offer…”

Alexander, observing the entire exchange, pulled Victoria into a comforting embrace.

“Victoria, the world is full of ungrateful people.”

“You try to help them, and they fault you for not giving enough.”

“Don’t waste another second on someone like him.”

“What a thoroughly ungrateful man!” Margaret chimed in with disapproval.

Richard spoke with blunt contempt.

“You’re a jobless failure with no prospects.”

“How dare you look down on a factory that generates a steady two hundred thousand annually?”

Victoria kept her head down, pretending to be hurt.

Secretly, she relished the upper hand.

Did he really think he could insult her?

The situation had completely reversed in her favor.

This was the price for crossing her!

However…

Adrian met everyone’s gaze with an icy smirk.

“Who told you I’m a jobless failure?”

“I am the President of GoldenPhoenix Entertainment. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.”

He pulled a stack of business cards from his pocket.

He tossed them into the air with a flourish.

Dozens of cards fluttered down around them.

Each one was printed in gleaming gold foil.

[President of GoldenPhoenix – Adrian Sinclair]

The room fell into stunned silence.

The useless, unemployed Adrian Sinclair was now the president of GoldenPhoenix?

How… How was that even possible?

GoldenPhoenix had signed numerous top-tier artists.

The company’s market valuation was well over a billion.

Adrian was the president?

That meant his personal net worth had to be at least…

Victoria felt as if she’d been slapped across the face.

She had just tried to “gift” her measly two-hundred-thousand-dollar factory to a man of his stature?

The humiliation was unbearable.

Everyone else looked equally uncomfortable.

Their expressions were as if they’d accidentally swallowed a fly.

Alexander narrowed his eyes suspiciously.

“Doesn’t GoldenPhoenix belong to Isabella?”

Isabella?

Oh. Right.

The reality of the situation crashed down on everyone.

Who didn’t know that GoldenPhoenix was Isabella’s company?

She had been incredibly public about it.

She’d practically thrown money around on Twitter for the entire world to see!
###Chapter 404

How could Adrian Sinclair claim to be GoldenPhoenix's president with such audacity?

Eleanor Kensington glared at him. "Adrian Sinclair! How dare you show us counterfeit business cards? Don't you realize this company belongs to Isabella Montgomery?"

"Of course I know!" Adrian shot back. "Isabella provided the financial investment while I contributed my expertise. What's the issue with that?"

His response left everyone in the room stunned. Did Isabella really establish this massive company just to let Adrian play president? That made absolutely no sense!

Richard Montgomery scanned the room and noticed Isabella had already moved to a side sofa. She sat with perfect posture, legs elegantly crossed and hands resting on her waist. Her relaxed recline radiated an aura of cool detachment, as if she were watching a performance by amateur actors.

Richard turned to address her directly. "Isabella, is this true? Did you actually appoint Adrian as company president?"

Everyone held their breath, hoping desperately this wasn't the case. They wanted to see Adrian humiliated and exposed as a fraud in front of the entire gathering.

Isabella merely raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. "And if I did? Is there some problem with that?"

Her voice carried that signature chill, arrogant and utterly self-assured. The confirmation struck the room like a physical blow. Adrian Sinclair truly was president of GoldenPhoenix!

Just moments ago, they had all been mocking him while pretending to offer charity with that pathetic factory worth only $200,000 in dividends. Meanwhile, he commanded a position that made their petty offerings laughable. They had become the fools in this scenario.

Victoria Kensington had intended to publicly shame and embarrass Adrian, but instead found herself the target of ridicule. This was her wedding day! How could everything keep going so wrong? Even this minor confrontation had spiraled out of control. Her useless cousin had come to insult her at her own wedding!

White-hot fury surged through Victoria's veins as tears began tracing paths down her cheeks. She turned her pained expression toward Isabella. "Isabella, do you truly hate me this much? I begged for your forgiveness repeatedly, yet you never accepted my apologies! If you despise me, just say it directly! Why send Adrian to publicly humiliate me? Why involve innocent people in our personal conflict...?"

The revelation clicked for everyone simultaneously. Since Adrian worked for Isabella, he must have been acting on her instructions when he spoke those cutting words.

"Agh..." Victoria suddenly clutched her stomach as if in severe pain.

Margaret Whitmore's face paled instantly. "Victoria! Are you all right? Don't let this stress harm the baby!"

"Victoria, let's get you out of here," Eleanor said, taking her daughter's hand. "Come rest in the bridal suite. Don't lower yourself to their level."

She guided the seemingly distressed Victoria toward the private rooms reserved for the wedding party.

Richard turned his furious glare toward Isabella. "Even if Victoria made mistakes, you shouldn't sabotage her wedding! You're embarrassing the entire Montgomery family! And that child she carries is your own niece! Are you trying to cause a tragedy?!"

"I'm warning you clearly," Margaret added with a scornful look. "If anything happens to my grandson, I will hold you completely responsible!"

The entire wedding party swarmed around Victoria, some asking about her condition while others fetched water. They treated her like precious royalty in that private room while Isabella remained alone in her corner outside, appearing more isolated than ever.

Alexander Whitmore fixed Isabella with an icy stare. "I never imagined you could be this cruel, Isabella." He scoffed in disgust before turning away.

Not long ago, he had been desperately trying to win her affection. He believed her to be straightforward, genuine, and real. Now he saw her for what she truly was—a vicious, irrational, and heartless woman! If anything happened to Victoria's baby, he would never forgive her!

A subtle smirk touched Isabella's lips as she watched the crowd fuss over Victoria. They were all so concerned about that unborn child. She wondered what expressions they would wear when they finally discovered the truth...
###Chapter 405

Isabella found a secluded corner to sit, away from their prying eyes.

Once she was gone, Victoria turned to the Montgomerys and Whitmores. “Please don’t worry, it was just a cramp. I’m feeling much better now. I know you’re all very busy—please, don’t let me keep you.”

“Oh, darling! No matter how busy, you are our priority! Ignore whatever those people said; they’re just jealous!” Margaret Whitmore comforted her.

“We’ve put the past behind us, so you should too. The only thing that matters is that you and Alexander are happy together.”

“Exactly. Your happiness is crucial for the baby’s health. Pay no mind to cruel words—we know your true heart. As long as you learn from past mistakes, we will always support you,” added Eleanor Kensington.

“Alright... I won’t disappoint you,” Victoria nodded obediently.

After successfully persuading them to leave, a sinister expression returned to Victoria’s face. These people were so easily manipulated. A few sweet words from her, and they danced like puppets.

Isabella? Ha. That pathetic woman had no real allies.

Just then, a group of guests passed by the resting room, their voices carrying.

“Goodness, isn’t this wedding excessively lavish?”
“They must have spent a fortune. I thought they’d be more discreet!”
“Hah! The audacity. One is a notorious playboy, the other a master manipulator. They have no shame, flaunting this spectacle.”
“Absolutely. Look around—no one here is genuinely happy for them. I’d be mortified.”
“A cheating scoundrel marrying a home-wrecker? And they make it this grand? Hilarious...”

Inside the room, Victoria’s fists clenched tightly. It seemed Rio wasn't the only one mocking her.

No doubt, similar conversations were happening everywhere today. This was her wedding day, the most important day of her life! How dare they?

This was all Isabella’s fault. Isabella was the one who spread those rumors online. Those articles were still circulating for everyone to see.

Isabella had rejected Alexander, yet she played the victim publicly. All just to ruin this wedding!

Victoria scoffed coldly. “Penelope, is everything prepared?”
“Don’t worry, Madam. It’s all set. The photos will be revealed as planned,” Penelope answered.

Hearing this, Victoria’s expression softened slightly. She could hardly wait for the ceremony to begin.

She wanted everyone to see how Isabella was secretly involved with Nathaniel Blackwood while pretending to be heartbroken over Alexander!

Meanwhile...

Adrian Sinclair approached Isabella and sat beside her.
He spoke in a low voice. “Isabella, why haven’t you told them the truth? I can’t stand another second of that woman’s act.”

Isabella’s eyes darkened, though her face remained calm.

If possible, she preferred not to expose the truth about the baby Victoria carried. Perhaps it was her own maternal instinct, born from her experience five years ago.

Even though she knew the child was the rapist’s, she still felt a connection. The child was innocent, regardless of the adults' sins.

Her original plan was to let Victoria’s schemes unfold, let her ruin the Montgomery family herself, and then step in to reveal everything. She had no interest in interfering in their romantic affairs.

She never expected Victoria to secretly photograph her with Nathaniel and plan to expose them at the wedding.

If Victoria insisted on this path, she deserved no mercy. A mother like her would be terrible for the child anyway.

A dangerous glint flickered in Isabella’s eyes.

“Soon.”
###Chapter 406

One hour remained until the ceremony.

The atmosphere buzzed with frantic energy.

Everyone moved with purpose, consumed by their duties.

Downstairs, the Montgomerys and Whitmores mingled with arriving guests.

Their laughter echoed through the grand lobby of The Ritz-Carlton.

Upstairs, the final preparations were underway.

Makeup artists hovered, ready for last-minute adjustments.

Victoria Kensington sat perfectly still before the vanity.

Her reflection showed a vision of bridal perfection.

Penelope Sinclair adjusted a stray curl.

"Madam, you must be so happy," she gushed. "You look absolutely stunning today."

A faint smile touched Victoria's lips.

"Thank you, Penelope."

Her eyes remained fixed on her own image.

She knew she rivaled any woman in beauty, even Isabella Montgomery.

Isabella's appeal was sharp, edged with arrogance.

Hers was softer, more refined.

Elegance radiated from within her, gentle and pure.

She embodied innocence, like a delicate jasmine blooming in silence.

Men adored such qualities.

They fell helplessly for this type of woman.

Today, she would captivate everyone.

A sudden knock interrupted her thoughts.

The sound was firm, deliberate.

Penelope moved warily to the door.

A man stood in the hallway, dressed in simple black attire.

His clothes were plain, unremarkable.

"Who are you?" Penelope asked, blocking his view.

The man's gaze shifted past her, landing directly on Victoria.

"I need to speak with Victoria," he stated. "Isadora Vasquez sent me."

Victoria's composure faltered.

Isadora? Her agent was imprisoned.

Why would she send this man?

Her eyes scanned him, taking in his age, his appearance.

A cold dread washed over her.

She knew, instinctively.

"Leave us, Penelope," Victoria commanded, her voice tight. "Wait outside. Allow no one to enter."

"Yes, Madam." Penelope stepped aside, allowing the man entry before exiting.

The door clicked shut.

Silence filled the luxurious room.

Victoria studied the stranger, her expression icy.

"Explain yourself," she demanded. "Who are you? Why are you here?"

The man's eyes held a strange mix of sorrow and intensity.

"Twenty-three years," he murmured, his voice thick with emotion. "You've grown into a beautiful woman."

Her blood ran cold.

What was he implying?

Her hands trembled slightly.

A horrible suspicion took root.

Could this be... him?

"I met with Isadora," he continued, his gaze never leaving her. "She told me everything. I failed your mother. I... I failed you."

"Stop!" Victoria's voice cracked with fury. "I don't want to hear it! Your apologies are worthless!"

She glared at him, her eyes burning with contempt.

"Mother is dead! I survived by hiding in fear among the Montgomerys! Why now? Why today? Do you want to ruin me?"

Tears of anger welled in her eyes.

"Should I announce to everyone that I'm not a true Montgomery? That my father is... a man like you?"

Her words dripped with venom.

He wore cheap, simple fabrics.

Nothing of value adorned him.

If the Whitmores discovered her connection to this man...

Would Alexander still go through with the wedding?

If society learned she wasn't a Montgomery heiress...

If they knew she was just an ordinary man's daughter...

Her modeling career was already ashes.

This identity was all she had left.

She couldn't lose it.

"Victoria, please, let me explain—" he began, his voice pleading.

"No! Get out! Leave immediately!" she interrupted, her tone sharp and final. "I never want to see you again! No one can know!"

A sudden thought struck her.

She stood abruptly, moving toward a nearby drawer.
###Chapter 407

The drawer Victoria opened was packed with neatly stacked cash, her emergency fund for unforeseen troubles.

She grabbed two thick bundles, roughly twenty thousand dollars.

She shoved the money into the man's hands, her grip firm and unyielding. "Get out," she commanded, her voice cold and sharp. "And never let me see your face again."

"Victoria..." he stammered, his eyes wide with a mix of shame and desperation.

"Go!" She spun around, unable to bear the sight of him for another second. His shabby appearance filled her with a deep, burning humiliation. How could she possibly be the daughter of such a pathetic, impoverished man? How could her real parents be so utterly worthless? No. She refused to accept it. She was a princess, the revered Ms. Montgomery. That was her identity. She turned back, a venomous scowl twisting her beautiful features. "Listen carefully," she hissed. "If you breathe a word of this to anyone, I will destroy you. Your life won't be worth living."

The man flinched, recoiling from the sheer malice in her threat. Defeated, he had no choice. He shuffled toward the door but paused on the threshold. "I wish you happiness, Victoria," he mumbled, his voice barely audible. "I'll... I'll come find you when you're not so busy." With that final, feeble promise, he finally disappeared.

Victoria's fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms. Find her again? For more money? A father who abandoned her for twenty-three years, only showing up now to leech off her success? Rage simmered inside her.

"Madam," a cautious voice interrupted her furious thoughts. Penelope stepped into the room. "The ceremony is beginning. It's time."

Victoria drew in a sharp, steadying breath. She forced her expression into a placid mask, smoothing away any trace of the darkness that had just consumed her. She glanced at her reflection in the mirror, ensuring only elegance and grace remained. Then, she swept out of the room. As she passed Penelope, she issued a quiet, sharp order. "Be ready with the photos." Her mood was ruined, and she was determined to ruin Isabella's day too. Why should she suffer while Isabella thrived? She wanted Isabella branded a gold-digger, despised by every single Montgomery. She wanted Isabella to feel every ounce of the pain she was feeling.

The grand lobby was a spectacle of opulence. A breathtaking floral arch, dripping with romance and beauty, stood as the centerpiece. Guests filled the seats, their chatter a low hum of anticipation. On the stage, the emcee's voice boomed with cheerful excitement. "Let's have a huge round of applause for our beautiful bride and handsome groom!"

All heads turned. The couple appeared at the end of the flower-lined aisle. Victoria held Alexander's arm, a picture of perfect elegance and bliss. A radiant, practiced smile was plastered on her face. Her extravagant gown flowed behind her, its hem glittering with countless exquisite diamonds. Alexander, devastatingly handsome and impeccably dressed in his tailored suit, complemented her perfectly.

The crowd, some of whom had earlier whispered criticisms, was instantly mesmerized. The groom was dashing. The bride was stunning. Together, they looked like a fairytale couple, a match crafted by destiny itself. All of Victoria's past scandals and misdeeds seemed to vanish in that moment, erased by the sheer power of their visual perfection. People could only see her beauty, her poise, her sheer exquisiteness.

With a face and presence like that, no one would dare dispute her claim to being the most beautiful woman in the world.

Victoria saw the awe reflected in their eyes. Her smile widened, triumphant. She lifted her chin higher, her posture becoming even more regal, like a majestic swan gracing a mere pond of mortals.

Isabella followed behind with the other bridesmaids. Though her beauty was unique and she stood out effortlessly among them, the group was large—nine bridesmaids and nine groomsmen. They moved as a collective unit, making it difficult for any single person to immediately capture attention.

Once on the stage, the wedding party fanned out to either side. A surge of satisfaction washed over Victoria. Isabella was reduced to a mere background character in her grand spectacle. This small victory felt like a sweet, long-awaited payoff for all her simmering resentment and hatred.
###Chapter 408

Everything was flawless.

Victoria Kensington was the radiant center of attention.

Isabella Montgomery remained in the shadows, just a background character.

She was exactly like the servant she had always been.

Victoria was the one marrying Alexander Whitmore.

She was the one claiming her happily ever after.

Special arrangements had been made for this occasion.

She exchanged a brief glance with the emcee.

The emcee’s voice boomed with excitement across the grand hall.

“Reaching the sacred union of marriage is never an easy journey.”

“Today, Ms. Victoria Kensington wishes to express her deepest gratitude to every guest present.”

“She has prepared a special musical performance to share with all of you.”

A soft, melodic tune began to play.

The lighting in the hall gradually dimmed, casting a warm, intimate glow.

The massive screen behind the stage flickered to life.

Someone handed Victoria a microphone.

She accepted it gracefully.

A haunting melody started playing in the background.

She began to sing.

“I’ve grown accustomed to the silence.”

“Where gossip blurs the lines of truth and lies.”

“I close my eyes, and the chaotic world fades.”

“Only one face remains.”

Her voice was filled with melancholy.

The lyrics echoed through the silent hall.

On the giant screen, images flashed of vicious rumors targeting Victoria.

Each photo appeared more cruel than the last.

They seemed designed to inflict maximum pain.

Her voice trembled with a fragile, gentle sadness.

It was a performance meant to evoke pity and compassion.

The audience was completely captivated.

They were drawn into her sorrow.

A heavy silence blanketed the room.

Victoria continued her song.

“You understand that love knows no season.”

“Even in the wrong time, at the wrong place.”

“Two souls can still find each other.”

“I have no regrets for loving.”

“I care not for what is right or wrong.”

Her voice grew stronger.

It shifted from sorrow to fierce determination.

The screen now displayed wedding photos of Victoria and Alexander.

Pictures from their five years together appeared one after another.

Every image radiated happiness and devotion.

The message was clear.

She had fallen for a man she shouldn't have loved.

But she would never stop loving him.

Her love was too deep, too consuming.

The audience was deeply moved.

They saw her as an innocent woman, pure in her love.

The music swelled, rising in intensity.

Victoria’s voice climbed to a powerful high note.

“The rumors are so loud.”

“They drown out all joy.”

“Loud and destructive.”

“I am so tired.”

“All I ask for is a simple life.”

“Is that too much to ask?”

The screen split into two contrasting halves.

One side showed vicious online comments and cruel criticisms.

The other side displayed beautiful photos of Victoria and Alexander.

The stark contrast was heartbreaking.

It shattered the hearts of everyone watching.

Sympathy washed over the crowd.

Eleanor Kensington was especially affected.

Tears welled in her eyes.

Her throat tightened with emotion.

Victoria only wanted to love.

She fell for a man she shouldn't have.

Yet she endured so much pain and public scorn.

This was supposed to be the happiest day of her life.

But the guests arrived with judgment and disdain.

No one truly wished her well.

Victoria harbored no resentment.

She bore all her sadness alone.

Her gentle voice continued, soft yet resolute.

“The rumors are deafening.”

“They ignore the depth of my love.”

“I don’t care what anyone says.”

“I only want to hold your hand until the very end.”

The final notes of the music faded away.

Tears streamed down her cheeks.

She walked slowly toward Alexander.

She took his hand in hers.

Her eyes glittered with unwavering determination.

Her fragile figure seemed to transform.

She appeared courageous, like a victim fighting for her happiness.

Alexander was deeply moved.

His heart ached with sympathy.

Victoria had just confessed her love in front of everyone.

He had no prior knowledge of this surprise.

He gripped her hands tightly.

One thought consumed his mind.

He must protect her.

He must protect their unborn child.
###Chapter 409

Tears welled in the eyes of many audience members as the final notes faded.

The melody had pulled at their deepest emotions.

Such an innocent and tragic woman.

Why had the online mob attacked Victoria so viciously?

She had done nothing wrong.

She had simply fallen in love with Alexander.

Her love for him began after Isabella had abandoned him five years prior.

Isabella had already ended their relationship.

It was a personal choice, not a crime.

Yet they had hunted her like wild animals.

Numerous people wiped their cheeks, hearts aching with regret.

They bitterly regretted the cruel words they had once directed at Victoria.

In an instant, all their prejudice transformed into sincere goodwill.

The audience was filled with directors and producers.

Every single one was utterly captivated by Victoria's performance.

They never knew she possessed such a stunning voice.

Her singing was enchanting, more compelling than the industry's top vocalists.

Her heartfelt passion resonated deeply with every listener.

"I would seriously consider producing an album for her," a prominent producer stated.

"That song would be an instant hit."

"Absolutely. I have a strong feeling she could stage a major comeback."

"Her popularity would skyrocket."

Madam Whitmore heard these murmurs of approval.

A wide, satisfied smile spread across her face.

Victoria had made her immensely proud.

She walked confidently onto the stage.

She presented a glass case to Victoria.

"Victoria, this is for you."

"From this day forward, you are my official daughter-in-law."

"I will take excellent care of you."

"And I will protect the baby you carry."

"I promise you will know nothing but happiness."

Victoria accepted the ornate case.

Inside rested an exquisite piece of emerald jade.

The carving was masterful, the shade a deep, captivating green.

It evoked the pure, untamed beauty of nature.

This was a top-tier imperial jade, large and flawlessly sculpted.

A gasp rippled through the crowd.

"That's the Whitmore family heirloom!"

"A legend says it was a gift from royalty generations ago!"

"Madam Whitmore is giving it to Victoria!"

"She is passing the family legacy directly to her!"

Victoria's smile widened at their words.

She bowed her head graciously.

"Thank you, Mother."

The precious jade felt cool in her hands.

Her eyes flickered subtly toward the group of bridesmaids.

Isabella stood in a shadowy corner, obscured from the light.

A large potted plant blocked her from view.

No one could see her expression.

A surge of triumph coursed through Victoria.

Perfect.

All eyes were on her.

The world's cameras were focused solely on her.

She was showered with praise and blessings.

Today, she was the woman everyone revered.

Isabella was merely an invisible spectator, utterly ignored.

But no... it wasn't quite enough.

She would only be truly satisfied when Isabella's reputation lay in ruins at her feet.

She wanted the entire world to witness how Isabella had seduced Nathaniel.

She wanted them to know she had slept with him.

Victoria gave an almost imperceptible signal to Penelope, who stood nearby.

Penelope nodded in understanding and immediately moved to prepare.

The background music softened into silence.

The large screen transitioned to a romantic backdrop of falling blossoms and snow.

The emcee's voice rang out clearly.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the moment we've all been waiting for has arrived."

"Please welcome our beautiful bride and handsome groom to the center stage."

"Let the official ceremony commence!"

This time, Alexander offered his arm to Victoria with genuine care.

They walked together to the center of the stage.

The memory of her tears and her haunting voice filled him with guilt.

He must have been under a spell to let such a gentle, beautiful woman go.

He had been a fool to choose the poisonous Isabella instead.

Isabella was stunning, yes.

But she was a rose covered in sharp thorns.

She was not feminine. She was not wifely material.
###Chapter 410

Victoria held thirty percent of the Montgomery shares.
Once Theodore Montgomery passed, the entire Montgomery Group would be hers.
She had wealth, beauty, and status.
Most importantly, she carried his child.
Alexander repeated these facts to himself, trying to cement Victoria's perfection.
He needed to erase Isabella from his mind completely.
"Mr. Alexander Whitmore," the officiant's voice cut through his thoughts.
"Do you take Ms. Victoria Kensington as your lawful wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse? For richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish until death do you part?"
Alexander answered without pause. "I do."
He took the ring from his best man.
He slid it onto Victoria's finger.
The massive screen behind them flickered to life.
The entire ballroom erupted into chaos.
Whispers spread like wildfire through the crowd.
A smug, dark smile curled on Victoria's lips.
Perfect. The pictures were finally showing.
Everyone would see Isabella with Nathaniel.
No amount of money could save Isabella from this scandal.
She would be exposed as a gold-digging social climber.
Victoria felt a surge of triumphant satisfaction.
But Alexander suddenly recoiled.
He ripped the ring off her finger.
His eyes burned with fury. "Victoria Kensington!"
He spat her name out, each syllable dripping with rage.
Victoria flinched. Why was he using that tone?
Something was wrong.
The crowd's stares felt different... accusatory.
She turned slowly toward the screen.
Her blood ran cold.
It wasn't Isabella with Nathaniel.
It was her. With Harrison Caldwell.
The video played for everyone to see.
Her legs gave out. She stumbled backward.
This couldn't be happening.
She had deleted this. Hired hackers to erase it completely.
How was it here?!
The crowd's murmurs grew louder, more vicious.
"Oh my god! Is that Victoria?"
"I thought she loved Alexander! Why is she with another man?"
"That's his assistant, Harrison! She slept with Alexander's assistant?"
"Unbelievable! And she had the nerve to sing that song earlier!"
"What a deceitful, disgraceful bitch!"
The Montgomery and Whitmore families sat in stunned silence.
Victoria had always been the picture of elegance.
This video showed a completely different woman.
Margaret Whitmore was the first to move.
She stormed the stage and slapped Victoria hard across the face.
The sound echoed through the silent hall.
Margaret glared, her expression venomous. "Victoria! Explain this!"
"We accepted you despite your past! And you betray my son like this?"
"How could you be so shameless?" Victor Whitmore scowled darkly.
###Chapter 411

The Montgomery family was utterly disgraced.

They wished they could vanish into the ground.

The shame was overwhelming, a suffocating weight with no escape.

Even Eleanor and Richard were completely devastated.

Their hearts were shattered, their trust obliterated.

They offered no defense for Victoria.

Madam Whitmore unleashed her fury on Victoria.

She shook her violently, her voice a sharp, furious crack.

"Say something! Look at that deceitful face of yours!"

"Give me back my jade! Return the engagement ring!"

"The Whitmore family will never accept a woman like you!"

Victoria was rattled, her cheeks stinging from the force.

Her entire world had just imploded.

Every pair of eyes in the room burned with pure contempt.

This wasn't how it was supposed to go.

Isabella should be the one drowning in humiliation.

Isabella should be the target of this hatred, not her.

She had clawed her way back, fought to restore her name.

She had schemed and sacrificed to secure Alexander.

She couldn't lose everything again. Not like this.

Panic seized her. She lunged for Alexander, clutching his hand desperately.

"Alexander, my love, it's all lies! None of it is true!"

"I was drugged! This is a setup! I'm innocent!"

"Someone is framing me, you have to believe me! I beg you!"

She sobbed, her voice raw with anguish and fear.

But her pleas fell on deaf ears.

After that graphic video played for everyone to see, who would believe her?

The footage was still displayed on the giant screen for all to witness.

The Victoria in that video was clearly a willing participant.

She showed no signs of being drugged at all.

And if she truly was a victim, why had she never reported it?

Why had she remained silent all this time?

Alexander coldly wrenched his hand from her grasp.

His gaze was ice. It was filled with betrayal, disgust, and utter revulsion.

Nothing she said mattered anymore.

The truth was undeniable. She had cheated on him.

Victoria's face drained of all color.

The finality in his eyes was terrifying. He was lost to her.

What could she possibly do now?

From the crowd, Adrian crossed his arms, a smug smirk on his face.

"What a spectacular mess! I wonder, cousin, is the baby Alexander's... or Harrison's?"

A collective gasp rippled through the guests.

"Victoria is pregnant?"

"No wonder they rushed this wedding!"

"So Alexander was forced to marry her because of the baby?"

"Wait, then who is the real father?"

The Whitmore family's rage intensified tenfold.

The Montgomerys had threatened them when the pregnancy was first discovered.

They had strong-armed the Whitmores into taking responsibility.

They had made it clear: if Alexander didn't comply, the Montgomery family would ruin them.

The entire wedding had been a reluctant concession, forced by the baby.

Now, it was likely the child wasn't even Alexander's!

The Whitmores were nearly tricked into accepting this shameful woman.

They almost agreed to raise another man's child!

Madam Whitmore, incensed, stormed forward and delivered another stinging slap to Victoria's face.

"You shameless, vile creature!"

"How could you do this to Alexander? How dare you force him into this?"

"I have never encountered such a filthy, deceitful woman in all my life!"

"You are not worthy of this wedding gown!"

In a blind fury, Madam Whitmore grabbed the delicate fabric of the gown.

She tore at it with all her strength, ripping it apart.

Victoria's ears rang from the force of the blows.

Twin red handprints bloomed across her cheeks.

Her beautiful, expensive wedding gown was shredded, exposing half her body.

The crowd erupted. Camera flashes exploded like relentless lightning.

Reporters scrambled, capturing every humiliating second.

Victoria's world spun, tilting into a chaotic, blurry nightmare.

Everything was crashing down. She was losing control.

Thud.

A wave of dizziness overwhelmed her.

The sheer chaos, the crushing shame, it was too much.

Victoria collapsed to the floor, unconscious.

But her fainting spell did nothing to quell Madam Whitmore's wrath.

She moved to strike the unconscious woman again.

Finally snapping out of their stupor, the Montgomerys surged forward.

Eleanor rushed to intervene, blocking the path.

"Enough! You've beaten her senseless! What more do you want?"
###Chapter 412

“We will provide a full explanation to everyone after this.”

“No, we will announce everything to the world. The entire truth!”

With that, Isabella ordered the bodyguards. “Come. Carry her out immediately.”

They placed Victoria on a white stretcher.

The once radiant Victoria, in her stunning wedding gown, now lay completely unconscious.

Her dress was torn in several places.

Isabella found a black suit jacket and draped it over her.

It looked like they were covering a corpse.

Who could have predicted this?

Just moments ago, she was the dazzling center of attention, touching the hearts of everyone present.

Now she was being carried out like this.

Theodore Montgomery coughed violently. His entire body shook with rage.

“Investigate this! Launch a full investigation right now!”

The Montgomery family swiftly obeyed, helping him leave the chaotic wedding scene.

Alexander remained frozen on the stage.

He stared in the direction Victoria had been taken, his chest feeling like it might explode.

He truly believed Victoria loved him.

All her mistakes, he thought, were made because of that love. For him.

He never imagined she would sleep with Harrison.

The woman he loved. The woman he was about to marry.

She had been with Harrison.

Harrison approached him anxiously, then dropped to his knees with a heavy thud.

“Mr. Whitmore, it was all my fault! Not Ms. Kensington’s! I was drugged...”

Alexander glared at him with icy coldness.

His mind raced, connecting all the pieces.

He remembered how Harrison often asked about Victoria. He always urged Alexander to treat her better.

The signs were there all along.

They had made a complete fool out of him.

His fists clenched. He punched Harrison squarely in the face.

Again. And again.

The blows were brutal, relentless.

Someone finally intervened, pulling Alexander away before he caused serious injury.

Isabella watched the unfolding chaos.

A faint, untraceable chill flickered in her eyes.

She turned and left, a victor exiting the stage.

This scene felt hauntingly familiar.

Five years ago, her own engagement party had ended in similar disgrace.

After she fainted that day, Alexander stood on that very stage and announced to the guests:

“My apologies. I have just received some devastating news.”

“The baby Charmine carries is not mine.”

“She slept with another man behind my back. She tried to trick me into raising another man’s child.”

“We argued. She fell down the stairs accidentally.”

“I apologize for the scene. But I do not regret my actions.”

“I will cover her medical expenses. But our engagement is hereby canceled.”

That day, she was dragged out of the hotel.

She was covered in her own blood.

She was met with scornful glares and mocking hatred from everyone.

No one covered her.

No one defended her.

The pain made her lose consciousness.

The baby, so ready to be born, struggled inside her.

It had died. Kicked by Alexander. Probably from lack of oxygen.

Her baby was due any day.

It was supposed to enter this beautiful world, loved by its parents.

Instead... it died.

It died in her womb before taking its first breath.

Mocked by everyone.

She later heard the infant was the size of a kitten when removed.

It was covered in bruises.

It was wrapped in a trash bag and discarded in the mortuary.

No one cared.

The memory was a sharp blade piercing Isabella’s heart.

She could barely breathe from the agony.

The five-year-old wound felt as fresh as yesterday.

What Alexander and Victoria felt now was nothing compared to her pain.

She had been innocent. She had harmed no one.

They deserved every bit of this punishment.

This was meant to be a celebration.

But all she could see was herself on that stretcher.

Her stillborn child inside her.

Her heart felt wrenched, squeezed impossibly tight.

Isabella left the hotel.

A black car waited quietly outside.

It was Nathaniel’s car.

Had he been waiting for her this whole time?
###Chapter 413

The car door swung open.

Oliver’s small face appeared in the gap. “Mommy! Mommy, come quick! The reporters are swarming this way—they’ll trap you for interviews!”

Isabella snapped back to reality.

She quickly slipped inside the vehicle.

Dominic was in the driver’s seat.

Nathaniel sat in the back.

Oliver occupied the middle.

Judging by their positions, it was clear they hadn’t left.

They had waited for her the whole time.

A sharp pang shot through Isabella’s heart as she remembered her stillborn child.

She turned her gaze toward Oliver.

Overcome with emotion, she pulled him into a tight embrace. “Are you okay, Mommy?” Oliver asked, his voice small.

“It’s nothing… Let me hold you for a bit,” Isabella murmured.

She buried her face in the curve of his shoulder and shut her eyes.

She needed to calm down.

Holding Oliver’s soft, warm little body worked like magic on her frayed nerves.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened slightly.

Was the boy’s shoulder more comfortable than his?

Lately, he found himself growing increasingly jealous of his own son.

The kid was nothing but trouble.

Isabella held Oliver for a long moment.

She thought about how her own baby would have been his age if he had survived.

But that was all in the past.

She had to cherish Oliver now.

At least this child hadn’t been born into a world of pain and suffering.

After a while, she slowly released him, feeling somewhat soothed.

“Thank you, Momo. Your shoulder is so warm… it’s magical.”

“Really? Then anytime Mommy feels sad, she can hug me! Always!” Oliver chirped, nuzzling into her arms.

Nathaniel scowled at the sight. “Come here.”

“Huh? Why?” Oliver whined.

“Safety first. No horsing around in the car,” Nathaniel said sternly.

Isabella immediately understood.

She quickly settled Oliver back into his middle seat and fastened his seatbelt.

Oliver huffed. “Just admit you’re jealous, Daddy! You’re jealous because Mommy hugged me! Admit it! You’re jealous!”

Both Nathaniel and Isabella fell silent at his outburst.

The atmosphere in the car grew tense again.

Isabella replayed the events in her mind.

Oliver had a point.

It did seem to make sense.

Was Nathaniel actually jealous of his own son?

A strange, unfamiliar feeling stirred inside her.

Five years ago, Alexander had despised her.

But now, five years later, she had met a man who genuinely cared for her.

A man who was incredibly sweet.

A man who truly loved her.

Meanwhile, the Montgomery and Whitmore families were in deep trouble.

News of the wedding disaster had gone viral.

[Alexander cheated on by Victoria]

[Madam Whitmore slaps Victoria]

[Victoria slept with Harrison]

[Victoria pregnant—father unknown]

Every article detailed the chaotic scene, publicly shaming both families.

Everyone knew the Montgomery and Whitmore stocks would plummet.

Within two hours, nearly fifty percent of shareholders had dumped their shares at rock-bottom prices.

Both families lost at least ten billion dollars in market value in that short time.

Victoria, of course, became the target of widespread ridicule.

[How dare she sing that song? ‘Rumors are loud’? Why don’t these ‘rumors’ happen to anyone else?]
###Chapter 414

Karma always finds its way. The rumors were proven true, yet she kept pretending to be innocent. Everyone agreed she deserved a new title: Queen of Deceit.

Now let’s all go listen to that song she sang—'I Want to Hold Your Hand Forever.' How laughable! More like 'I Want to Betray You Forever'!

They call this poetic justice. Alexander cheated on Isabella, and now Victoria cheated on him! He had it coming!

No one will ever forget how Victoria Kensington played him. And she even had the nerve to sing 'I Have Nothing to Hide.' Then why not tell the truth, you liar?

Victoria and Alexander’s reputations shattered completely. Over at Montgomery Manor…

Theodore Montgomery hired the top private investigator. The findings were clear: everyone at the café that day was high-profile. None had any motive to harm the Montgomery family. No one drugged Victoria.

One corner camera survived deletion. It showed only Harrison Caldwell entering the room after Victoria. No one else went in.

The investigation also revealed Victoria’s own staff deleted the other footage. If she were truly drugged, the culprit would have erased the evidence. All signs pointed to her lying.

Richard Montgomery was livid. He arranged an immediate abortion while she was still unconscious. It didn’t matter if the baby was Alexander’s or Harrison’s—it could not be born.

The Whitmore family cut all ties with Victoria that day. She would not be marrying some assistant either.

Theodore’s face was stormy. “Release a statement,” he ordered. “The Montgomerys are revoking all her shares. She will learn her lesson. She’ll sign the transfer documents the moment she wakes.”

Richard did not object. Eleanor Kensington sighed but stayed silent. She never imagined her favorite daughter would fall this far.

They had forgiven Victoria’s many shameful mistakes. But she betrayed their trust. Taking back her shares was the only way to salvage the family’s dignity.

Inside her room, Victoria opened her eyes with effort. Pain and rage filled her. Ruined. Everything was ruined.

She was so close to marrying Alexander. Now this scandal destroyed any chance with him. Her life was over. How could she face anyone? How could she go on living?

Just then, Penelope Sinclair entered quietly. “Madam,” she reported softly. “They said… once you wake up, you must return all your shares.”

All her shares? All thirty percent she fought so hard to get? She would have nothing left. No money. No status. Nothing.

No. She would not allow this. She had to think of something. Fast.

A dark idea formed. She spoke weakly. “Get out. Don’t tell anyone I’m awake.”

“Yes, Madam.” Penelope felt Victoria’s icy glare. She hurried out, frightened. She knew Victoria too well. Something terrible was brewing.

Penelope didn’t dare stay another second. Once the door closed, Victoria struggled to her feet. She dragged herself toward the window.
###Chapter 415

At The Grand Monarch Bar, inside a private room.

The room was completely dark, not a single light on.

Alexander Whitmore sat on the floor.

Empty wine bottles covered the table in front of him.

He drank one after another.

A growing pile of bottles surrounded him.

His eyes were bloodshot.

A cold, distant aura radiated from him.

Each sip of wine brought back memories of a younger Victoria Kensington.

He remembered the first time he saw her at the Montgomery manor.

He told himself she was a fairy tale Snow White.

He wanted to be her Prince.

Back then, he was bitterly paired with the unattractive, coarse Isabella Montgomery.

It was an arrangement between the Whitmores and the Montgomerys.

He despised Isabella but kept silent.

He had no right to object.

Slowly, he and Victoria began a secret relationship.

He always loved and cherished her.

Even after discovering she wasn't a blood-related Montgomery, he never looked down on her.

He worried for her survival within the family.

He taught her to manipulate Isabella and Benjamin.

To slowly steal their shares.

It seemed like he was the instructor.

But revisiting these memories, he realized Victoria did everything herself while pretending reluctance.

He always believed she was kind, pure, and innocent.

He never imagined she could be so calculating!

Thinking of the investigation results, he took another large gulp.

Yes, Victoria was indeed drugged.

But she drugged herself!

She set a meeting with Nathaniel Blackwood.

She wanted to sleep with him but failed.

Isabella sent Alexander a text that day, trying to give him and Victoria a chance.

He sent Harrison Caldwell instead.

If Victoria's plan had succeeded, she would have slept with Nathaniel and dumped him!

He always saw her as Snow White.

The truth was she secretly wanted to sleep with Nathaniel and then discard him!

Another mouthful of wine.

The pile of empty bottles was now a small mountain.

The drunker he got, the clearer his thoughts became.

Isabella's face slowly surfaced in his mind.

Free from Victoria's manipulation for 18 years, she would have been just as incredible.

Isabella never did anything wrong.

Even the incident five years ago was set up by Victoria.

If... If he could turn back time, he would gladly accept the marriage arrangement with Isabella.

He would support her.

Work hard with her.

They would have been happily in love.

An indisputable power couple.

Most importantly, Isabella would never betray him.

Never!

Isabella followed him everywhere since they were children.

Her eyes sparkled every time she saw him.

He made a mistake.

He picked the wrong girl from the very beginning.

He swung his arm violently.

The glass bottle shattered instantly.

Pieces of broken glass scattered everywhere.

A sharp cut on his palm.

The pain jolted him back to reality.

Thinking of Isabella, he clenched his fists.

His eyes darkened.

At Rosewood Manor, Isabella was sitting on the sofa using her phone.

Maxwell Carter. [Boss Montgomery, should we expose your true identity now? Along with the DNA results? I think it's time.]

Isabella. [Not yet. Soon. Wait two more days. Keep a very close eye on Victoria in the meantime.]

Maxwell. [Alright.]

She was about to put her phone down when a call came in.

An unknown number.

She answered.

"Hello, Ms. Montgomery, this is The Grand Monarch Bar. A man named Sebastian Blackwood wishes to speak with you. He says he has important information for you."

Sebastian Blackwood?

Important information?

Isabella's eyes lit up.

Was Sebastian finally emerging now that Victoria was ruined?

"Okay. I'll be there soon," she replied.

She put her phone away.

She saw Nathaniel and Oliver preparing dinner in the kitchen.
###Chapter 416

Oliver’s small hands were still puffy as he helped wash the vegetables.

Nathaniel wore an apron for the first time, attempting to cook.

His knife skills had improved significantly since staying with Isabella.

He swiftly sliced ginger into uneven chunks.

A look of elegant pride lit up his face.

Isabella watched, momentarily captivated.

Yet confusion lingered in her mind.

Why was Nathaniel so determined to cook dinner himself?

They could have simply ordered in.

But that didn’t matter now.

She approached the father and son.

“Don’t mind me,” she said softly. “I need to go out for about an hour. I’ll be back to celebrate.”

“I want to come with you, Mommy!” Oliver immediately perked up.

Isabella walked over and gently pinched his cheek.

“Look at you,” she smiled. “You can’t leave a job half-done. Finish washing these vegetables. I’m just running a quick errand. I’ll be back soon.”

“Oh, alright…” His voice was soft and sweet. “Come home soon, okay Mommy? We’ll be waiting for you…”

Waiting for you to come home.

The phrase warmed her heart.

She would hurry back.

As she turned to leave, Nathaniel’s low, gentle voice stopped her.

“Drive safely.”

His tone was like a husband’s reminder to his wife.

Isabella paused.

Their affection made her want to stay.

But this was important.

“Don’t worry,” she replied. “I’ll be back soon.”

She rode her motorcycle away from Rosewood Manor.

The bike weaved through heavy traffic with ease.

Within twenty minutes, she arrived at The Grand Monarch.

Her memory guided her to the private room.

She stood outside Room 707.

Emotion tightened her chest.

Five years ago, she was raped in this very room.

It was Valentine’s Day.

Alexander had promised her a surprise.

She arrived excitedly, only to find Victoria inside.

Victoria handed her a glass of juice.

Everything went black after that.

For years, she believed it happened at The Ritz-Carlton.

Only recently did Vincent Moreau reveal the truth.

It happened here.

She took a deep breath and pushed the door open.

The strong scent of alcohol hit her immediately.

Before she could react, a figure moved swiftly.

The door locked behind her.

The lights dimmed to a romantic pink.

Rose petals covered the floor and sofa.

Isabella frowned.

The man blocking the door was Alexander.

His suit jacket was gone, leaving only a wrinkled white shirt.

His collar was torn messily.

His handsome face was flushed red.

He was drunk.

Very drunk.

She realized he had trapped them both inside.

“Open the door right now!” Her voice was ice-cold. “Let me out!”

Alexander leaned against the door, his gaze sincere.

“Isabella, don’t go. Hear me out…” His words slurred slightly. “I was wrong all these years. I shouldn’t have manipulated you from the start. I shouldn’t have let Victoria hurt you. You can hit me. Yell at me. Do whatever you want.”

He stepped forward and grabbed her hand.
###Chapter 417

Isabella dodged his advance with practiced ease, stepping back to create distance.

Alexander froze, his expression crumbling. A bitter laugh escaped his lips. “I know you despise me. Denying my blame would be a lie. Today, I kept thinking…if I could turn back time, if I had another chance, everything would be different now. But it’s still not too late.”

He dropped to one knee, pulling a velvet ring box from his pocket. The diamond inside caught the light, glittering coldly.

“Marry me, Isabella. I’ll agree to any condition. Testify against Victoria? I’ll do it. A prenuptial agreement? We’ll sign one immediately. Just say yes.”

His words were slurred from alcohol, but his eyes held a desperate, sober intensity. This was his only path to redemption, the sole way to erase years of regret. He was certain she would accept.

Isabella’s gaze was pure ice. She looked down at him as if he were something foul stuck to her shoe. “The great Alexander Whitmore, on his knees for me? Weren’t you the one who swore you’d never want me, even if I were royalty?”

The memory of those cruel words, spoken five years ago, hit him like a physical blow. Victoria had poisoned his mind back then. He’d been blind to the truth, blind to the fact that Victoria had forced Isabella to hide her beauty.

“I was a fool,” he choked out, a sob catching in his throat. “Blind and stupid. You can hate me. You can punish me.”

A harsh, mocking laugh tore from her lips. “You think this pathetic display is sincere? You believe it moves me? You’re nothing but a drunken fool, a pathetic cuckold who got what he deserved! Do you even love me? If I’d returned from Africa looking the same, without the diamond mine, without this fame…would you be here? Would you be kneeling?”

The hand holding the ring trembled violently.
She leaned closer, her voice a venomous whisper. “You don’t love me. You love the glamorous illusion. You miss the woman who truly loved you, the one you kicked down a flight of stairs. This version of me will never be yours.”

In one swift, brutal motion, she raised her leg and drove her heel into his chest.
The force was immense, echoing the violence he’d once inflicted on her.

Thud!

He crashed to the floor, the ring skittering away into the shadows.
Isabella didn’t even flinch. She stepped over him, her posture regal and utterly cold.

As she reached for the door, he scrambled up. Drunk and enraged, he lunged, grabbing her arm and slamming her against the wall. His fingers dug into her shoulders.

“You’re not mine, so you belong to Nathaniel?!” he roared, his eyes bloodshot. “You think he actually wants you? He’s playing with you! He’ll discard you! I don’t care that you’ve been with him! I don’t even care about the child! What right do you have to reject me? What right?!”

He shook her violently. Her back slammed into the unyielding wall, pain radiating through her. The world spun from the force of his rage.

It took her a moment to focus. Her eyes met his, filled with a contempt so deep it was paralyzing.
He had ignored her at their engagement party. He had slept with Victoria that very night.
Why this desperate begging now?
###Chapter 418

Alexander actually dared to question her and Nathaniel?

He even used that disrespectful tone?

“What if I refuse you?” Isabella sneered. “What if I’m with Nathaniel? A man like you doesn’t stand a chance!”

She raised her hand to push him away, but Alexander seized her wrists and snarled, “Isabella! Nathaniel will never marry you! He wouldn’t even waste a moment on you if he knew your history! He would despise you! Marry me, be with me, and I can pretend none of this ever happened—”

“Hah! Do you believe everyone is like you? Do you think all men are as selfish as you are?” Isabella met his gaze and enunciated each word with cold clarity. “You discarded Victoria the instant you discovered her past with Harrison. But did you ever consider why she acted that way? If it weren’t for your own actions, she never would have done those things! You are nothing but a selfish, disgusting, narcissistic man! Nathaniel is nothing like you!”

Her expression softened slightly at the mention of Nathaniel. “He knew I was assaulted five years ago. I know you would have abandoned me immediately if you were in his position. Nathaniel chose to help me investigate what happened. He never once looked down on me! So you have no chance with someone like me anymore. The moment I agree, he will marry me without hesitation!”

Her voice was sharp and filled with contempt as she shoved him away with surprising strength.

Alexander was thrown back onto the nearby sofa like a broken marionette. He made no move to get up, his eyes wide with stunned disbelief. Nathaniel… Nathaniel knew everything? And instead of casting her aside, he helped her? How? Why? How could Nathaniel not despise Isabella?

The scent of alcohol still clung to Isabella’s clothes even after she left The Grand Monarch. She stopped at a boutique to buy a new jacket before riding her motorcycle back toward Rosewood Manor.

The image of Alexander’s devastated face replayed in her mind during the ride home. A deep sense of satisfaction settled within her. Finally. That despicable man got exactly what he deserved. Perfect karma.

Yet, something felt incomplete. It wasn't until she was nearly at Rosewood Manor that she remembered her promise to Oliver. She had promised to celebrate with them when she got home, and she had returned empty-handed.

She pulled over to the side of the road and called Maxwell. “Get a bottle of Silas’s special reserve sent over immediately. The good one.”

“That’s difficult,” Maxwell replied. “You know how he is about his wine collection. He guards it like his life.”

“Just tell him I’ve hit a wall with the autonomous drone navigation system,” Isabella insisted. “I need some… inspiration.”

“That might work. I’ll relay the message right away.”

“Wait,” Isabella added. “Also, get a bottle of Peach Nectar on the way.”

The Peach Nectar was one of Silas’s original creations. Every year during the peak of the peach blossom season, he would personally collect the morning dew from the petals, along with the most perfect blossom from each tree, to ferment into a delicate, fragrant essence. The alcohol content was low, but the peach flavor was intense and refreshing, its aroma instantly uplifting.

Maxwell let out a low chuckle. “I can already picture Silas having a heart attack.”

Isabella smiled and ended the call. Today had been immensely satisfying, the most in years. Celebration was absolutely necessary. She could always help Silas collect more peach blossoms next season to make it up to him.

A light, cheerful feeling accompanied her as she finally entered Rosewood Manor. She was greeted by the sight of Oliver fast asleep on the sofa.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel…
###Chapter 419

Nathaniel was focused on his laptop.

From her position, Isabella could clearly see the screen.

It displayed photos of her leaving The Grand Monarch.

There were also images of Alexander Whitmore.

Had Nathaniel sent people to follow her?

He heard the door open and turned quickly.

His eyes narrowed as he quietly closed the laptop.

"You're home," he stated.

Isabella nodded and locked the door behind her.

She entered the room casually.

"I saw everything," she said nonchalantly.

Had she really seen it all?

Nathaniel frowned deeply.

Did she see the images? Did she know he had her followed?

He pushed the thought aside.

His gaze swept over her critically.

"You changed clothes?" His voice was low and demanding.

He looked like a lion guarding his territory.

Isabella had intended to question him first.

She didn't expect him to turn the tables.

Memories of her interaction with Alexander surfaced.

A strange guilt washed over her.

"I ran into a dog," she replied coolly. "It was disgusting, so I changed."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened instantly.

That's all she had to say? 'Ran into a dog'?

She was in a room with a completely drunk Alexander.

They had a history together.

How was that just 'running into a dog'?

He suddenly rose from his seat.

He advanced toward her slowly, one deliberate step at a time.

Isabella frowned. "What—"

He was already in front of her before she could finish.

He scooped her into his arms effortlessly.

He carried her straight to the first-floor bathroom.

Unease prickled her skin. "What are you doing, Nathaniel?"

His silence felt ominous and distant.

He shut the bathroom door firmly behind them.

He placed her inside the large bathtub.

He turned on the water tap without a word.

Isabella tried to get up.

Nathaniel pressed her down firmly by her shoulders.

"Clean up," he instructed, his tone leaving no room for argument.

It finally dawned on her.

He was an even bigger clean freak than she was.

He was making her bathe because she encountered Alexander?

"Nathaniel, it was nothing. He just grabbed my wrists, touched my shoulder—"

"Just?" His eyes darkened dangerously. "You were expecting more than that?"

She was right. He was jealous.

Nathaniel took her wrists firmly.

He began rubbing them under the running water.

He scrubbed from her left wrist to her right.

He was so thorough her skin turned red.

He showed no intention of stopping.

The thought of Alexander touching her wrists infuriated him.

He rarely got to touch his own woman.

How dare that man lay a finger on her?

And her shoulder.

Did he grab her shoulder too?

The mere thought...

Nathaniel's eyes grew stormy.

He reached out to clean her shoulder.

His hand landed on her damp shirt.

Their eyes met. Both of them jolted at the contact.

"Get out," she insisted. "I'll wash myself thoroughly."

His trance broke. "I'm not convinced," he asserted.

He looked around and grabbed a towel.

He covered her with it roughly.

Then he continued washing her shoulder through the fabric.

Isabella was utterly speechless at his possessiveness.
###Chapter 420 

Nathaniel, this man… Did he really intend to wash her personally?

Wrapped in the towel, Isabella felt as if she were at a luxury spa. Was the CEO of Blackwood Corporation actually giving her a scrub-down? Fine. If he insisted on doing it himself, she might as well relax and let him ‘serve’ her instead of resisting.

Nathaniel’s hands moved from her left shoulder to the right, rubbing until her skin flushed pink. He paused, his gaze sharp. “That’s enough for now. Next time, it won’t be just this.” His voice held a dark, possessive edge. Isabella’s heart stuttered. Next time? What did he mean by that?

She could sense Nathaniel was plotting something.

But it didn’t matter. She would never let Alexander get that close to her again anyway. Nathaniel brought her a fresh set of clothes and left the bathroom. After changing, Isabella picked up her soiled garments to toss them in the washer, but Nathaniel intercepted. He took them from her hands and threw them straight into the trash.

Straight into the bin! That jacket was brand new—almost ten thousand dollars! Just because he was filthy rich didn’t mean he could be this wasteful. Nathaniel’s expression remained stern and unreadable.

He sat at the dining table. “Dinner is ready.”

Isabella walked over and took a seat, suddenly remembering Oliver. “I’ll ask Momo to join us.”

“No need,” Nathaniel said. “He already ate before he fell asleep.” On the sofa, Oliver immediately pretended to be deeply asleep again. Waa…! I can’t wake up now! Mommy can’t know Daddy lied…!!

Unaware that Oliver had been awake, Isabella began eating with Nathaniel. The table was laden with gourmet dishes: seafood platters with scallops and imported prawns, white truffle pasta, gold-leaf pizza, seafood curry, caviar chocolate pudding… Each dish was exquisitely prepared and looked incredibly expensive.

Isabella frowned. What was going on? Wasn’t he slicing ginger earlier? Why were there no ginger-infused dishes in sight?

Nathaniel’s face gave nothing away. He picked up a bottle of red wine, ready to open it, but Isabella stopped him. “Wait! Today calls for a celebration. I want you to try something special.” She walked to the mailbox and retrieved two bottles. One was a frosted glass bottle containing a dreamy peach-colored nectar. The other was an elegant glass bottle filled with a deep rose-red liquid.

She set the peach nectar aside and brought the red wine over. She poured half a glass for him and half for herself. Nathaniel eyed the unlabeled bottle skeptically. No brand, no origin—just mysterious liquid in a plain bottle. “Is this safe to drink?” he asked.

“Absolutely. Try it!” Isabella urged. She raised her glass and took a small sip. Instantly, her muscles relaxed. She had to admit, Uncle Silas’s homemade wine was in a league of its own.

Nathaniel took a cautious sip, expecting some cheap swill. To his surprise, the flavor surpassed even wines worth tens of millions. His sharp gaze settled on Isabella, lingering. “Isabella, how many more secrets are you hiding from me?” His tone was intrigued, almost tender.
###Chapter 421

Throughout Nathaniel's—and Oliver's—stay at Isabella's residence, she consistently found ways to astonish him.

Each new layer she revealed only deepened her enigma.

Nathaniel had never encountered a woman who could captivate his interest while remaining so profoundly mysterious.

Isabella's crimson lips curved into a teasing smile. "What about you?"

Three casual words, yet they carried a subtle undercurrent of genuine curiosity.

Nathaniel held her gaze. "What about me? Are you interested?"

"Not really!" Isabella took another sip of her wine. "Forget it. Let's eat."

Naturally, Isabella refused to reveal any care or affection for him.

Men were peculiar creatures; the more humble a woman acted, the easier she was discarded.

Maintaining an air of indifference was her best defense against getting hurt.

Over the years, Isabella had constructed formidable walls around her heart.

Even though she had accepted Nathaniel's presence, she would never openly show it.

Nathaniel noted how she deftly avoided the question.

It reminded him of his previous request for just a fraction of her attention.

If she was unwilling to offer fifty percent of her love, how much could she truly give?

Her evasion was transparent to him.

Her demeanor toward him had noticeably softened recently... so why still dodge admitting her feelings?

Nevertheless, Nathaniel felt no rush. He served her some food. "What are your plans after this?"

"After this..." Isabella's eyes darkened.

Victoria's reputation would be utterly destroyed sooner or later. There was no path to redemption for her.

After this, Isabella wouldn't need to lift a finger.

The image of a furious, livid Victoria brought a languid smile to her lips as she sipped her wine. "She should've known the consequences of her actions."

Her tone was low and ominous.

Nathaniel refilled her empty glass and raised his own. "A toast to you, then."

"Thank you." Isabella clinked her glass with his and took another sip.

Although she had unsettled Victoria numerous times, this time was fundamentally different.

It would take less than ten days for Victoria's true nature to be exposed for all to see.

Isabella eagerly anticipated it.

She finished the red wine in her glass, her mood excellent as she continued her meal.

Maxwell, watching over Isabella from outside the manor, received a call at that moment.

"Maxwell, remember to tell Isabella the wine's alcohol content is different now. It's much stronger. Tell her to drink less!"

Maxwell frowned. "I'm afraid it's too late..."

Isabella ate and drank continuously–one had to admit, the wine handmade by a professor like Silas was truly unique.

It had a sweet, cooling texture with a lasting, exquisite aftertaste. It was as refreshing as fruit juice.

Yet, the more she drank, the dizzier she became.

Her vision blurred. Nathaniel, once one person, now appeared as two, then three... She was seeing double!

Was she drunk?

Isabella never usually got drunk on Silas's wine. She eyed Nathaniel suspiciously. "D-Did you put something in my wine, Nathaniel?"

"Am I that kind of man in your eyes?" Nathaniel refuted.

Isabella had no response to that.

Of course not.

Nathaniel had ample opportunity to take advantage of her before, yet he never did.

Perhaps she really was just drunk.

As the thought crossed her mind, Isabella's body went limp, and she slumped onto the table.

Nathaniel set down his fork and walked over to carry her back to her room.

Finally, Oliver jumped up from the sofa and ran upstairs to open the door for them.

Once Nathaniel entered the room, he heard a loud 'click' from outside.

That sound...

Undoubtedly, Oliver was messing with them again!

Oliver loved inventing things, including an anti-opening device.

Once that device was secured on both sides of the door, no one inside could open it, no matter their strength.
###Chapter 422

Nathaniel didn't get angry at Oliver's actions. He simply smiled. The boy was actually less irritating than usual.

Outside the door, Oliver examined the anti-opening device he had installed. He dusted off his hands with satisfaction. Finally! After resisting his hunger for so long, he could finally enjoy his dinner. Now his father and mother could have some quality time together. Maybe he would get a little sister soon! He happily ran downstairs. He ate with impeccable table manners, behaving like a proper little gentleman.

Back inside the room...

Nathaniel laid Isabella down on the bed before settling beside her. A soft blush colored her cheeks. It gave her a completely different allure compared to her usual icy demeanor.

His hand instinctively reached out to caress her face. But just before his fingers made contact, he paused. He gently played with a stray strand of her hair instead. "Oh, Isabella..." he murmured. "When will you finally celebrate with me?" She was always so consumed by her past and her enemies. He often felt overlooked. Suddenly, Isabella turned over in her sleep. Her arm wrapped around his waist.

The distance between them vanished completely.

Her intoxicating feminine scent, mixed with a hint of alcohol, filled his senses. It was utterly arousing.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "My little wildcat," he whispered huskily. "Do you even realize you're playing with fire?" Isabella remained asleep, offering no response. Her arm stayed firmly around him. Nathaniel sighed. He was talking to a completely intoxicated woman. It was pointless.

He pulled her closer, wrapping his arm around her waist. A satisfied smile touched his lips as she nestled against him. With him, she was always so vulnerable and trusting. He could feel her walls slowly crumbling down.

However...

A shadow crossed his face as memories from five years ago resurfaced. Would Isabella leave him if she ever discovered the truth? Would she think he was a monster? He knew how much she despised that kind of man. He desperately hoped to keep it hidden a little longer. At least until after they were officially married. Once she was legally his, she could never escape.

Isabella slept soundly, completely oblivious. In her drunken state, she had forgotten all about Benjamin.

Benjamin had attended Victoria's wedding. He had been genuinely happy for his sister. Then that video played on the big screen. It shattered his image of her pure and gentle nature. He got blindingly drunk. He didn't even bother going home. Coincidentally, Takashi Yamamoto sent his men to bring Benjamin to Westhaven. Benjamin boarded the plane without a second thought.

At the Montgomery Manor, Victoria finally woke up. She dragged herself to the window and picked up her phone. She sent a text to Takashi Yamamoto: [Do this one thing for me. I'll agree to any condition you demand.]

In Westhaven...

Takashi smirked at the message. So, Victoria had finally been broken. So what if she had slept with Alexander and Harrison? Her beauty remained untouched. She was still utterly bewitching! That once untouchable, pure woman was now begging him for help? He replied: [Are you certain? You'll agree to share my bed?]

Victoria: [Yes. I will come to Westhaven to meet you after this is done.]

Takashi: [Very well. It's a deal.]

Victoria received the files from Takashi almost immediately. When Eleanor and Richard were not in the living room, she forced her weak body out of bed. She walked deep into the estate's grounds. Theodore Montgomery lived in a separate, two-story house there. After the scandal, he had sent all the maids away. He sat alone in his living room, trying to clear his mind.

His door was pushed open gently at that moment. He turned around, furious. He saw Victoria standing there. "What are you doing here? Get out!" he demanded, his voice cold and harsh.

Victoria was the absolute last person he wanted to see.
###Chapter 423

Theodore Montgomery held affection for Isabella, but he also cared deeply for Victoria.

She was his biological granddaughter, after all.

He had placed great hopes in her future.

That was why he allowed Richard and Eleanor to transfer their shares to her.

Even knowing it threatened his own controlling stake.

To him, Victoria's past mistakes were common among ambitious women.

What woman didn't fight for status and love?

The important thing was her genuine desire to change.

To uphold the family's honor.

Her scandal with Alexander's assistant shocked him deeply.

She had Alexander, yet she betrayed him with his own staff.

Victoria destroyed the Montgomery family's reputation.

They became the laughingstock of high society.

Theodore felt utterly devastated.

To him, this granddaughter was already dead.

Victoria approached him despite his visible anger.

She stood directly before him.

"I came to discuss something important."

"I heard you plan to revoke my shares?"

"That's correct." His expression remained stormy. "After such a disgrace, you deserve nothing. The Montgomery legacy will not be destroyed by you."

Tears welled in Victoria's eyes instantly.

They streamed down her cheeks in practiced sobs.

"Grandfather... I'm your real granddaughter! I was set up! I'm completely innocent!"

"Set up? Our investigation found no evidence of drugging. Why persist with these lies?"

"No one drugged me... I drugged myself."

Theodore's frown deepened at her unexpected confession.

What did she just say?

She drugged herself?

Victoria met his gaze with a bitter smile.

"You have no idea the torment I've endured."

"Since Isabella returned, she systematically destroyed my modeling career."

"She ruined my public image."

"Yes, I deserved some of it. But I had no other choice!"

"I truly loved Alexander. Because of that love, I made terrible decisions."

Her voice cracked with manufactured emotion.

"Grandfather, do you realize how incredible Isabella became after Africa?"

"Alexander's heart changed. He promised to love me forever, yet he abandoned me for her!"

"We both made mistakes at their wedding, but only I faced consequences."

"He faced no backlash. He just pursued Isabella harder!"

"He told me never to contact him again."

"He demanded I help him win Isabella back!"

"Do you know how much that hurt?"

"Five years of love... utterly wasted!"

Victoria clutched her chest as if stabbed.

Her tears fell like a summer storm.

Theodore maintained his stern composure.

"None of that excuses sleeping with Harrison! Without that scandal, you'd be married to Alexander now!"

"And why did he fall for Isabella? Because of your own actions!"

Victoria seethed internally.

Her own actions?

Isabella forced her into every one!

If Isabella hadn't schemed against her from the start...

If she hadn't been pushed to the brink...

Would any of this have happened?

She swallowed her rage.

Now was not the time for honesty.

She needed to play the victim a while longer.

She forced her voice back into a pitiful whimper.

"I never wanted any of it! I never wanted Harrison!"

"Alexander made it happen!"

"You know I've been secluded lately."

"He refused to see me. Too busy chasing Isabella."

"I loved him too much. I couldn't live without him."

"I begged him to meet me at The Ivy. To save our relationship."

"He didn't come. He sent Harrison instead...!"
###Chapter 424

I put on my most beautiful dress and waited for him with anticipation.

My heart was pounding with nervous excitement.

But he never showed up.

Instead, his assistant arrived in his place.

Tears streamed down Victoria's face as she spoke.

Theodore Montgomery frowned deeply.

Could it be true that Victoria had drugged herself for Alexander, only to be met by his assistant?

Victoria watched Theodore from the corner of her eye.

Seeing his growing belief, she sobbed even harder.

"This wouldn't have happened if he came himself," she cried. "I never wanted any of this!"

She collapsed to her knees, her body trembling with emotion.

"I've been suffering the most through all of this!"

Victoria curled into a small ball on the cold marble floor.

Her fragile form looked heartbreakingly vulnerable.

She hugged her knees tightly as tears continued to fall.

"Now everyone in the world despises me," she whispered. "No one trusts me or likes me anymore."

She looked up with pleading eyes. "But I'm your real granddaughter. Would you really treat me like everyone else? Would you really bully me too?"

Her voice grew softer. "This is my home, my only safe place. I don't even ask to marry Alexander anymore. I just don't want you all to look down on me..."

Her words were filled with humility and pain.

Theodore's stern expression finally softened.

He let out a heavy sigh. "Go back to your room and rest. I'll make sure everyone here treats you properly."

He paused, considering his next words. "As for the shares... there's no alternative. We must wait for this scandal to pass before returning them to you."

Victoria's hands clenched tightly beneath her sleeves.

He was still taking her thirty percent shares?

Even after seeing her completely broken and vulnerable?

Ice-cold determination filled her gaze.

All that acting had been for nothing?

How could he be so heartless?

Transfer them back later? She knew better.

They would keep all her shares until they discovered she wasn't the real daughter.

Then they would throw her out completely.

A cold smile touched Victoria's lips as she staggered to her feet.

"Grandfather," she said, her voice trembling. "You've forced my hand. You left me no choice."

She met his gaze directly. "I considered you all my family, my only support system. But now you've all turned against me!"

Her voice rose with desperation. "I have nothing left! Those shares are my only security!"

"I can't lose them! I won't let you take them from me!"

She took a shaky breath. "So forgive me... but you've pushed me to this point. I have no other options."

Theodore felt a sudden sense of unease. "What are you doing?"

Victoria pulled out her phone and showed him several photos.

The images showed Benjamin locked in a small underground room.

The dark space had no windows, only a dim yellow light overhead.

Benjamin knelt on the floor, curled into a pitiful position.

Theodore's face paled with alarm. "Victoria! How could you do this to your own brother? He gave you his shares!"

"Don't worry, Grandfather," Victoria said coldly. "As long as you don't take my shares and give me your thirty percent, I'll make sure Benjamin returns home safely."

Theodore's expression darkened completely.

Not only could he not take her shares, but he had to give her his own?

She was using Benjamin to threaten him!
###Chapter 425

"Victoria!" Theodore Montgomery's voice thundered through the room. "Have you completely lost your mind? You're destroying your own future! The family will despise you even more for this!"

"What does it matter?" Victoria Kensington's bitter laugh echoed coldly. "None of you ever liked me anyway. You all hate me now and want to strip me of my shares. You treat me like garbage when I need my family the most. What difference does any of this make?"

Her smile twisted into something painful. "I'm just trying to secure something for myself. My health is ruined. Modeling is over for me. Alexander Whitmore will never marry me now. I can't expect the family to treat me the same ever again."

She stepped closer, her eyes burning with desperation. "All I want are the shares. I'll pour everything into the company. I'll lose myself in work. When I control sixty percent of the Montgomery shares, no one will ever bully me again. No one will look down on me. I will remain Ms. Kensington. I will be the one in charge of this family!"

Theodore stared at her, fury and disbelief warring within him. "What makes you think I would ever agree to such madness?" he scowled. "With our resources and Isabella's help, finding Benjamin will be a matter of time. Your threats are empty."

"Go ahead and try!" Victoria's voice turned shrill, her composure shattering. "But if you refuse me, I won't hesitate to have him killed! Let's see who finds him first. You pushed me to this. I have nothing left to lose. I am capable of anything now!"

She was completely unhinged. A deranged, fierce light glowed in her eyes. Theodore had never seen this side of his granddaughter. The usually poised and gentle Victoria was gone, replaced by this monstrous stranger openly threatening murder to get her way.

She would truly kill Benjamin. His only grandson. Victoria was corrupt, rotten to the core. Isabella was brilliant, but she was adopted. The family would never fully accept her as heir. Benjamin was the only legitimate future for the company. Theodore's face hardened into a mask of grim severity.

Victoria put her phone away and thrust a document into his hands. "Read it, Grandfather. Don't forget, I am your real granddaughter. My blood is Montgomery blood. Despite all my mistakes, I am still the most capable of all your grandchildren."

Her voice softened into a persuasive, venomous whisper. "The company will not be destroyed in my hands. It will grow stronger. Bigger. You have no reason to hesitate." She forced the proposal into his grip.

He looked down at the detailed plans for the Montgomery Group's future. It was impeccably crafted. It even outlined strategies to mitigate the current scandal's damage. She was undeniably capable.

But did that mean he had to hand over everything to this villainous girl?

"Just agree, Grandfather," she coaxed, her tone hypnotic. "I was forced into this. I need something to rely on. I can't bear being cast aside by everyone. I will take care of the family. I will prove myself to the world. You don't actually have another choice, do you?"

Her words were a demon's sweet song.

Theodore glared, but she held his gaze without flinching. In that moment, he saw it—a desperate, cornered young woman, pushed to the brink, truly willing to kill.

If he refused, Victoria might actually have Benjamin murdered.

After a long, heavy silence, Theodore pulled out his phone. He called his attorney. "Prepare a contract immediately. I am transferring my thirty percent shares. Keep this absolutely confidential."

"Yes, Sir," the attorney replied and began working.

A wave of relief washed over Victoria. It was working. Everything was falling into place.

She had succeeded.

Soon, she would own sixty percent of the Montgomery Group. She would be the largest shareholder. She would be unstoppable.

The attorney arrived shortly. His frown was immediate and deep when he saw Victoria was the recipient. Transferring thirty percent to her? After her reputation was in tatters? This would devastate the company.

"Mr. Montgomery..." the attorney began, his voice laced with concern and caution.
###Chapter 426

Theodore Montgomery said nothing in response to his lawyer’s inquiry.

He picked up the pen.

His signature flowed across the document, his gaze fixed intently on Victoria.

“I expect you to honor our agreement, Victoria.”

“I will, Grandfather.”

A saccharine smile graced Victoria’s lips as she took the contract.

She exited the room without a backward glance.

Theodore watched her leave, his eyes slowly closing with profound weariness.

Her earlier outburst had shaken him to his core.

He never imagined she possessed such a ruthless side.

Holding Benjamin hostage left him with no alternative.

She was, after all, his biological granddaughter.

They had pushed her to this extreme.

Perhaps granting her the shares would bring her some peace.

If she executed the plans outlined in her proposal, the company might even benefit.

What other choice did he have?

He was bound by blood.

A heavy sigh escaped him.

A sudden thought prompted him to address his attorney.

“Transfer all properties under my name to Isabella Montgomery.”

The lawyer was visibly stunned.

Everything? To Isabella?

He…

Back in her room, Victoria’s expression contorted into pure malice.

She finally held sixty percent of the company’s shares.

She was now the director of the Montgomery Group.

The thought of her new status clashed violently with the humiliation she had endured.

A powerful urge to flee the country surged within her.

Not yet.

She had to endure a little longer.

The Montgomery Group shares were valuable, but not enough.

Accessing the company’s main official accounts, she logged into Twitter.

Her post was calculated and precise.

(After a thorough investigation, it has been confirmed that Victoria Kensington and Harrison Caldwell were drugged with a substance known as Nightshade. Its scent induces unconsciousness and vivid hallucinations. The perpetrator remains unidentified, but the Montgomery Group is committed to uncovering the truth! Furthermore, the Montgomery Group pledges ten billion dollars to the Phoenix Initiative. This project will combat illegal narcotics and underground syndicates, aiming to protect innocent women from harm! Victoria Kensington will lead this project and serve as its ambassador to raise societal awareness!)

She attached a photo of a fabricated medical certificate.

Its caption stated, (Victoria Kensington’s poor fetal development was directly caused by exposure to illegal drugs!)

The post went live.

Victoria immediately paid a swarm of online commentators to flood the replies.

(OMG! Nightshade causes unconsciousness? That's terrifying!)

(I didn’t notice anything in the video! I thought she was conscious! I had no idea it was such a sophisticated drug.)

(The world is truly a dangerous place. Poor Victoria’s reputation was destroyed because of this! It’s so unfair.)

(It’s heartbreaking. Her wedding was ruined, her reputation shattered. She’s suffered so much.)

(Is it just me, or does this seem suspicious? Victoria was the top supermodel, then her nudes were leaked, a media storm followed, other top models were targeted, and now she was drugged!)

(It’s clearly a targeted attack! The modeling industry is vicious!)

(Even if Victoria was involved with Harrison, that’s her private business! Who released that video? It’s a gross invasion of privacy!)

(Exactly! She should sue whoever did this!)

(I feel so sorry for Victoria. She doesn’t deserve this.)

The paid comments dominated the section, suppressing any dissenting voices.

To solidify her narrative, Victoria posted a carefully crafted video statement.

“To be completely honest, I wanted to contact the authorities when this happened. But I was paralyzed with fear. I was terrified of losing Alexander. I was utterly terrified. And now…” She paused, her eyes welling with manufactured tears. “The truth is, I was drugged. Because of that, I was forced into actions against my will. Now, everyone mocks me. The man I love has abandoned me…”

She took a shaky, dramatic breath before continuing.

“But I don’t blame him. I can’t even accept myself right now. From this moment forward, I will dedicate myself entirely to my work. I will strive to become a better person. Through the Phoenix Initiative, I hope every woman will join me. We will stand united. We will fight against the manufacturers of these illegal drugs. We will fight for every victimized woman. If you are brave enough to share your story, I will personally oversee the investigation and resolution of each case. I will also provide comfort funds from the initiative.”

The video successfully重塑 her image.

Public perception began to shift in her favor once again.
###Chapter 427

Isabella woke to complete darkness.

Moonlight streamed through the window, casting silver patterns across the room.

A distinct masculine scent filled her senses.

She blinked away the sleep, realizing she was in Nathaniel's arms.

They lay facing each other, bodies intertwined beneath the sheets.

Nathaniel slept soundly beside her.

His white shirt was wrinkled and torn, stained with her lipstick.

What happened?

She rubbed her temples, the hangover pounding in her head.

Had she done this to his shirt while drunk?

Guilt washed over her as she tried to slip away.

A strong arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her back.

She met Nathaniel's darkened gaze.

Their faces were inches apart.

Her lips nearly brushed against his chin.

"Let me go," she whispered, not moving.

"You held me all night, Ms. Montgomery. Don't I deserve compensation?" His voice was deep and rough.

Isabella flushed. Held him? Touched him?

Impossible.

"I sleep like the dead when drunk. I wouldn't do that—stop making things up!"

"Seems I need to refresh your memory. How you used my arm as your pillow..." Each word made her feel guiltier.

Despite her protests, the evidence was on his clothes.

"Enough! Just tell me what you want!"

Nathaniel's lips curved. "Kiss me."

Kiss him?

Her eyelids twitched. "Nathaniel, that's too much!"

I owe him for touching him, but...a kiss?

"Do you know how much trouble you caused today? Or should I show you?" His voice dropped lower.

She understood his meaning.

"Fine. But you forget this ever happened. Tell no one."

"Agreed." He smirked, waiting patiently.

She panicked under his intense gaze. "Close your eyes."

He smiled and complied.

She studied his perfect features up close.

His presence always felt so restrained.

Kissing him wouldn't be terrible.

She closed her eyes and leaned in.

Their lips met in an electric jolt.

Her heart raced wildly.

She tried to pull back, but Nathaniel cupped her head, deepening the kiss.

Her mind went blank, overwhelmed by his intensity.

She gasped for air, drowning in him.

"Isabella..." His voice was husky with emotion.
###Chapter 428

Isabella’s pulse raced as Nathaniel’s kiss left her breathless.
His voice alone was enough to unravel her defenses.
So hypnotic, so commanding.
She felt herself melting under his touch.

“Fine,” she whispered, her voice unsteady. “It’s not like it’s my first time. I’m not losing anything.”
She wanted this—needed to feel alive.
To reclaim a part of herself she thought she’d lost.

But Nathaniel’s expression shifted instantly.
His eyes cleared, intense and serious.
He pulled back, putting space between them.
“Don’t ever say that again, Isabella.”

She blinked, confused.
What had she said wrong?

He cupped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.
His voice was low, firm. “Listen to me. What happened five years ago wasn’t your fault. Your body, your soul—they’re still pure. You’re the most incredible woman I’ve ever known. Never belittle yourself because of something that wasn’t in your control.”

He stood up, adjusting his shirt with practiced elegance.
“I crossed a line today. I shouldn’t have let it go that far. I respect you too much for that. And I need you to respect yourself, too.”

Warmth flooded Isabella’s chest.
They were so close… yet he stopped.
For her.

Most men would’ve taken what they wanted without a second thought.
They would’ve called her easy.
Used.

But not Nathaniel.

She rose from the bed and wrapped her arms around him from behind.
Her cheek pressed against his back.
“Nathaniel,” she murmured. “Giving myself to you isn’t disrespect. It’s what I want. Are you really turning me down?”

His body went rigid at her touch.
She could feel the tension in his muscles.
The struggle.

But his voice was steady. “I want you, Isabella. More than you know. But not like this. Not when you’re drunk. Not when you’re confused. I want it to be on our wedding night.”

Her heart fluttered wildly.
He was serious.
He really meant to marry her.

This wasn’t a game to him.

She pushed him playfully, putting on a teasing tone. “So eager to make me a Blackwood, are you? Not a chance. I won’t marry a man who can’t even slice ginger properly.”

She was sure he’d failed at that task earlier.
Probably ordered takeout instead.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. “Are you saying you won’t make it up to me?”

Isabella coughed, caught off guard.
Why did he have to be so direct?

“I need some air,” she deflected, moving toward the door. “It’s getting stuffy in here.”

But when she turned the knob, it didn’t budge.
She pulled harder.
Nothing.

Frowning, she glanced back at Nathaniel.
“What’s wrong with the door?”

“Your son’s doing,” he replied simply.

Oliver.
Of course.

“What do we do now?” she asked, a hint of panic in her voice. “How do we get out?”
###Chapter 429

Nathaniel settled onto the edge of the bed.
“We wait.”

The room was completely sealed.
No sound could escape, not even if they screamed.
Their phones had been confiscated outside.
Contacting Oliver was impossible.
They were trapped until he decided to release them.
Isabella’s brow furrowed deeply.
“How long must we stay here?”
“That depends on how long he believes his father requires,” Nathaniel stated plainly.
A flush crept up Isabella’s neck at his implication.
She scanned the room desperately.
The windows were securely locked from the outside.
The door was their only exit, and it was solid, immovable.
No tools were available to force it open.
“Try to rest tonight,” Nathaniel suggested, his voice calm. “We will find a solution in the morning.”
Isabella recalled his promise not to overstep.
She forced herself to relax slightly.
Oliver would surely let them out tomorrow.
He wouldn't let them starve.
She noticed some old architectural blueprints and checkers strategy books she’d left in the room previously.
She moved to the desk, deciding to occupy her mind.
The wall clock showed 8 PM.
Having slept all day, sleep felt miles away.
Nathaniel seemed equally alert.
Isabella could study her designs, but Nathaniel’s work documents were outside.
He had nothing to do.
He came and stood behind her, looking over her shoulder.
She was sketching the framework for a new skyscraper.
He picked up a pencil and added a few precise lines.
“A pyramidal base here increases structural integrity and allows for greater height.”
Isabella studied the modified foundation.
His adjustment was brilliant, a masterstroke of engineering.
Combined with her original vision, the design would be revolutionary.
She stared at him, impressed.
“How do you know this? Blackwood Industries doesn’t deal in architecture.”
Blackwood Industries was a global investment titan, not a construction firm.
They hunted profitable markets, not designed buildings.
Yet, every project they backed was a guaranteed success.
She assumed Nathaniel only understood finance and investment.
His knowledge of structural engineering was a complete surprise.
A faint, knowing smile touched his lips.
“I possess many talents. You will discover them all after we are married.”

Married.
She nearly choked.
Why did he constantly bring that up?
“I... I need to focus on this drawing,” she mumbled, bowing her head and pretending he wasn't there.

Fortunately, Nathaniel didn’t press further.
He picked up one of her advanced checkers manuals instead.
The publications were dated, from years ago.
The mentors who had given them to her were legends in their fields.
Time slipped away unnoticed.
It was 2 AM.
Exhaustion finally pulled at Isabella.
She turned to Nathaniel.
“Oliver isn’t watching. We don’t have to share the bed. You take the floor.”
She couldn’t risk a repeat of earlier… incidents.
His eyes darkened, a storm brewing in their depths.
“Your memory is conveniently selective when you’re sober.”
“You said you wouldn’t mention the kiss again!” she retorted, irritation flaring.
He countered smoothly. “After everything that has transpired between us, you relegate me to the floor?”
Without waiting for a reply, he stretched out on the bed beside her.
Isabella was rendered speechless by his audacity.
He was utterly unreasonable.
Was she destined to be stuck with him, even without an audience?
Was this his new permanent arrangement?
###Chapter 430

“I’ll be good,” Nathaniel murmured, his voice low and husky as he wrapped his arm around Isabella’s waist, pulling her firmly against him.

She stiffened for a moment, ready to push him away, but then she relaxed. He had promised not to overstep. Resisting now would only make her seem childish. It was just sleep, after all.

Moonlight spilled into the room, casting a silvery glow over them like a delicate veil.

The next morning, the distinct sound of a key turning in the lock echoed through the room. Christopher was finally unlocking the door. Isabella immediately tried to sit up, but Nathaniel’s arm tightened around her. “In a rush to leave?” he asked, his voice still rough with sleep.

“Obviously,” she replied, confused.

“Think about it,” he said softly. “Oliver went to all this trouble to get us together. If he finds out nothing happened, he’ll be heartbroken. You know how his health is.”

Isabella’s heart clenched. There was still no reliable treatment for his condition. A severe emotional shock could trigger another episode. She couldn’t bear to see him suffer.

But still…

“If neither of us says anything, how would he know?” she argued, frowning.

“Do you really think he’s that naive?” Nathaniel countered, his voice dropping to a whisper.

Isabella wanted to protest. Oliver was only five! He was incredibly bright for his age, but surely a child wouldn’t understand these things.

Suddenly, Nathaniel shifted, moving over her. “For Oliver’s sake, I’m afraid you’ll have to play along, Ms. Montgomery.”

Before she could process his words, he was leaning down. His lips found the sensitive skin of her neck, sucking gently until a faint mark bloomed beneath them. Just as she was about to push him away, he pulled back. “There. That should do it.”

Done? That was it? Just a few kisses?

Isabella was baffled until she caught her reflection in the mirror. Several vivid love bites stood out against her skin. Had this man really been celibate all these years? She found it hard to believe.

Nathaniel chose that moment to open the door. Oliver immediately bounded into the room.

“Good morning, Daddy! Good morning, Mommy!” he chirped.

Isabella instinctively tried to cover her neck, but her collarless shirt offered no protection. Oliver’s sharp eyes immediately spotted the marks. A brilliant smile spread across his little face. “Mommy, I used the breakfast machine to make us a meal. You can’t skip breakfast. It’s not good for you.” He hurried over, taking her hand carefully as if she were made of glass, and began leading her downstairs.

Isabella shot a glare over her shoulder at Nathaniel. The damage was done. There was no undoing this misunderstanding now.

Nathaniel simply smirked, looking thoroughly pleased with himself. But as he watched Oliver guiding Isabella down the steps with such care, a shadow crossed his features. His expression darkened, his eyes clouding with a sudden, deep worry.

If she ever discovered the truth about his past… if she learned about the woman he had violated… would she still want him? Would she still be willing to have his child?
###Chapter 431

Oliver guided Isabella to the dining table. He had spent the entire previous evening scrubbing every surface. He even washed all the dishes and mopped the floors. Isabella was touched by his effort, though her eyes still scanned the room. She spotted her phone resting on a nearby shelf. As she began to rise, Oliver suddenly spoke up. "Mommy, wait! I'll get it!" His small form darted across the room. He carefully retrieved the device and brought it to her. He handled it with extreme caution, as if it were fragile. His entire demeanor radiated a protective anxiety. Isabella reached out and gently tousled his soft hair. "My sweet boy, you're the child here. Let Mommy take care of you, alright?" Oliver shook his head, his expression serious. "But the baby inside you is smaller than me. A big brother protects his sister. Please, just sit. I will bring your breakfast." He hurried toward the kitchen before she could protest. Isabella watched him go, a mixture of surprise and warmth flooding her. She decided not to stop him, allowing him this gesture.

She unlocked her phone. The screen lit up with a flood of overnight notifications. Among them were several messages from Alexander. [Alexander: Good morning.] [Alexander: Sleep well.] [Alexander: Have you eaten?] She stared at them for a long moment, her finger hovering. She chose not to reply. Instead, she tapped on the messages from Maxwell. [Maxwell: Urgent news, Ms. Montgomery! Victoria has acquired Mr. Montgomery's shares! She's launched a massive PR campaign to rebuild her image!] [Maxwell: Ms. Montgomery, are you there? The situation is critical. Victoria now controls sixty percent of Montgomery Group! This is disastrous!] A deep frown etched itself onto Isabella's face. She quickly opened a social media app. The top trending topic was #ThePhoenixInitiative. She scrolled through the feed. There was no criticism. Not a single negative comment. Every post praised Victoria. They highlighted her support for various women's charities. They applauded her donations. They celebrated her work helping women regain their confidence. The most shocking development was her new alliance with city officials. Together, they were investigating major drug rings and criminal syndicates. Her destroyed reputation was not just repaired; it was being sanctified. Isabella's frown deepened. None of this would be possible without the Montgomery family's influence and connections. Those officials were Theodore Montgomery's longtime associates. Why would he ever willingly hand over sixty percent of his life's work? A cold dread settled in her stomach. She immediately dialed her grandfather.

"Grandfather, how are you feeling? Is your health stable?" "I'm managing. I've been better," Theodore Montgomery replied, his voice heavy with a weary sigh. Isabella pressed on, her tone soft but insistent. "Grandfather, something is wrong. I can hear it in your voice. Please, tell me what happened. Let me help you." Another long, drawn-out sigh traveled through the phone. "Ah, Isabella... So many people have called asking the same thing since yesterday. I had no other choice. Just... let it go. I don't want to burden you with this." His evasion only sharpened her concern.

Her voice firmed with resolve. "There is nothing I cannot handle. If you won't tell me, I will use every resource at my disposal to find out the truth myself." Hearing the steel in her words, Theodore finally relented. His voice dropped to a defeated whisper. "Victoria... she has Benjamin. She kidnapped him. He's her prisoner now..."

Everything clicked into place for Isabella. Of course. That explained everything. It was the only leverage powerful enough to force Theodore's hand. To make him surrender his shares and use his influence to rehabilitate Victoria's name. The woman had finally made her move against the family directly. Isabella had anticipated this escalation. "Don't worry, Grandfather. Looking at her current strategy, Benjamin is her only valuable asset. She won't risk harming him. I give you my word. I will get him back safely within three days."

"Truly? You're certain?" A fragile thread of hope wove itself into Theodore's weary tone.
###Chapter 432

Benjamin was his only grandson. Theodore Montgomery’s concern was completely justified.

“Yes,” Isabella answered calmly. “Don’t worry, Grandpa. But please don’t let Victoria know we spoke. I’ll do everything I can to save Benjamin.”

“Alright, Isabella. Be careful. Victoria… She’s changed so much it frightens me now.” Theodore had believed Victoria would free Benjamin after he transferred his shares. Instead, she extended their agreement, stating she’d only release him after her reputation improved. Meaning, Theodore remained under her control.

Isabella’s lips curved slightly. “Don’t worry, Grandpa. I’m not the same person I was five years ago. I can handle this and protect myself.”

Theodore sighed, finally relieved. Inside his prayer room, he opened a drawer and spoke to a portrait with deep emotion. “Did you hear that? Isabella has grown into a remarkably capable woman. She can take care of herself now. We don’t need to worry about her anymore…”

Ending the call, Isabella stared at the overcast sky with fierce determination. Benjamin had vanished after Victoria’s wedding. But he’d also packed his belongings beforehand, indicating he planned to leave. She’d heard Victoria hired Takashi Yamamoto to train him. Was Takashi involved? If Benjamin had gone to Westhaven, things would become complicated.

Isabella retrieved her phone and texted Maxwell.

[Isabella: Locate Benjamin’s current whereabouts. Keep this completely confidential.]

[Maxwell: Understood.]

Just then, Oliver approached with a plate of toast. “Mommy, try this toast! I made it myself!”

“Thank you, Momo.” Isabella took a piece. The breakfast machine had perfectly controlled the heat and timing, resulting in a soft, delicious slice. “Momo is so talented!” she praised warmly. “This is really yummy!”

“Yay! Momo is clever, and my sister will be cute and clever too!” Oliver beamed, gazing expectantly at Isabella’s stomach.

Isabella was speechless.

Nathaniel joined them at the table. He took some toast and a glass of milk, instructing Oliver, “I’m returning to the company today. You stay home and look after Mommy and your sister.”

“Don’t worry, Daddy. Momo will complete his mission!” Oliver saluted.

Isabella felt a pang of confusion. She could handle a childish Oliver, but a childish Nathaniel? How disappointed Oliver would be when he discovered there was no sister.

Nathaniel’s phone lit up on the table.

[Sebastian: Results from 30 DNA tests are in. Major updates! Get to the company now, Bro. You won’t believe who was in that room!]

Nathaniel frowned. The presidential suite was his private domain. No one accessed it without permission. How could Sebastian claim over 30 DNA profiles were identified from that room? This meant they might finally track down the woman from five years ago.

Finding the truth now… his relationship with Isabella… Nathaniel instinctively glanced at Isabella sharing toast with Oliver—a heartwarming scene. He quickly looked away, grabbed his suit jacket, and headed out. Regardless of who it was, he needed closure. He wouldn’t let this jeopardize what he had with Isabella.
###Chapter 433

Shortly after Nathaniel departed, Isabella received a text from Maxwell.

Maxwell: I’ve confirmed Robert was taken to Westhaven by Takashi Yamamoto. They’re staying in a secluded mountain estate with heavy security. Approaching undetected will be difficult.

Isabella’s brow furrowed. Takashi Yamamoto was not known for his charity. Why would he help Victoria? Clearly, some underhanded deal had been struck.

Another question nagged at her. Why had Victoria remained at Montgomery Manor after securing sixty percent of the family shares? Why was Benjamin still up on that mountain?

A thought occurred to her. Her fingers flew across the screen.

Isabella: Maintain surveillance. Identify their patterns and vulnerabilities. Do not engage until I give the order.

Maxwell: Understood.

Isabella pocketed her phone, the online headlines flashing through her mind. She turned to Oliver.

“Momo, are you getting bored staying indoors? Would you like to go out with Mommy?”

“Yes! Yes!” Oliver bounced with excitement.

Since Nathaniel and Oliver had moved into her residence, they had avoided public outings. The fear of McKenzie’s photographers kept them confined. The mere prospect of leaving the house thrilled him.

But then…

“Won’t the bad Auntie find us? What if she tells Grandpa and Grandma to take me away?” Oliver’s lower lip trembled.

Isabella ruffled his hair. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. No one will recognize us. Mommy will give you a makeover.”

She led him to her dressing room. Using special child-safe cosmetics, she transformed his features. His large, doe-like eyes were reshaped into a sharper, more angular shape. His full lips were made to appear thinner. Strategic contouring gave his face a less cherubic, more defined look.

She topped it off with a stylish golden wig and dressed him in a trendy, street-style outfit. The elegant little boy was gone, replaced by a cool, slightly spoiled-looking kid.

Oliver stared at his reflection, clapping his hands in delight. “Wow! I love it! I look like a little superhero! Ready to protect Mommy and my sister!”

Isabella smiled warmly. “I’m glad you like it.”

She then turned her attention to herself. With skillful application, she softened her own striking features, creating a more subdued, ordinary appearance. A simple white dress completed the look of a typical, unassuming stay-at-home mother.

She studied her reflection, a satisfied smirk playing on her lips. So, Victoria thought she could just stay, did she? She had clearly pushed her into a corner, but Victoria wasn’t finished. She must have another card to play before she’d finally leave.

Isabella had no intention of giving her the chance to play it. She would ensure Victoria had no opportunity to salvage her reputation in the days to come.

Isabella hailed a taxi with Oliver and headed downtown to Whitmore Plaza. The mall, owned by Whitmore Enterprises, was a bustling hub of restaurants and entertainment—a shopper’s paradise.

Remembering her plan, she bent down to Oliver’s level. “Momo, you need to be extra good today, okay? It will be very crowded. Do not wander off. Wait for my instructions.”

“Don’t worry, Mommy. I’ll be good,” Oliver promised, his eyes wide with excitement. His father rarely took him to crowded places, usually arranging for private shopping. This was a thrilling first for him.

Seeing his anticipation, Isabella took him straight to the fifth floor. It was the mall’s main entertainment level, packed with arcade games, children’s play areas, dart boards, and bowling alleys.

The main attraction, however, was the long rows of gleaming claw machines. They were filled with an array of adorable plush toys—Hello Kitty, Mickey Mouse, and various other cute animals.

Isabella scanned the area. The person she expected to see wasn’t there yet. Her eyes narrowed slightly. It seemed they would have to wait a little longer.
###Chapter 434

Oliver's eyes sparkled at the sight of the arcade machines.
That spark vanished just as quickly.
He noticed a figure in the distance and immediately tugged Isabella's arm.
"Let's go," he whispered urgently.

Isabella looked down at him. "What's wrong, Christopher?"

"I saw Amelia," he mumbled, his voice low. "Uncle Gregory's daughter. She'll make fun of me if she sees me here. And Daddy... Daddy always said these machines are a waste of time. He never lets me play."

Isabella's expression tightened. Uncle Gregory? She recalled Nathaniel had a younger brother, Gregory Blackwood. Gregory constantly battled Nathaniel for control of the family empire, always losing. To his credit, Gregory was a shrewd businessman. He'd married Sophia Delacroix, an acclaimed actress from an old-money dynasty. The press adored them as the perfect power couple.

Naturally, since Gregory and Nathaniel were rivals, his daughter Amelia would despire Oliver. The entire Blackwood clan, it seemed, looked down on the boy.

Isabella squeezed his small hand and smoothed his hair. "Christopher, look at you today. Your disguise is perfect. She won't recognize you. And remember, I'm right here. No one gets to bully you. Not on my watch. Now, tell me the truth: do you want to play that claw machine? Do you want to show Amelia Blackwood what you can do?"

He nodded instantly, his earlier fear replaced by determination. "Yes! I really do!"

"Then let's go." She led him firmly toward the arcade.

Inside, Amelia Blackwood was furiously jabbing at a claw machine controls. She'd already wasted a stack of tokens with nothing to show for it. She stamped her foot in frustration.

Just then, a woman and a child entered her line of sight. The woman wore a simple white dress that radiated a quiet grace. The boy... he was dressed like a tiny rockstar, but that wasn't what caught Amelia's eye. He was clutching a gigantic lollipop, bigger than his own head! He happily licked at it as he walked, a picture of pure joy. A whole necklace of other colorful lollipops hung around his neck.

Amelia's mouth watered. Despite her privileged life, her parents enforced strict, perfectionist rules. Sugary treats like this were completely forbidden. The temptation was overwhelming.

"Hey, you!" she called out, her tone imperious. "I want one of those! Give it to me!"

Oliver flinched instinctively. Her voice brought back memories of her constant taunts, her cruel words about his mother, her sheer disdain. But this time felt different. He felt the steady, reassuring warmth of Isabella's hand in his. He looked up, meeting Amelia's gaze with newfound courage.

"No," he stated clearly. "Get your own mommy to buy you one." He then took an exaggerated, satisfying bite of his giant candy, his eyes never leaving hers.

His defiance only infuriated her more. Amelia planted her hands on her hips. "Do you even know who I am? Do you know who my parents are? I'm a princess! You have so many, you have to give me one!"

"Well, I'm my mommy's prince!" Oliver shot back. "And I won't! Come on, Mommy, let's play!" He pulled Isabella toward an empty machine.

On their way to buy the candy, Oliver had confided in Isabella. He told her how Amelia had mocked him since they could barely walk, how she'd turned other children against him, and the time she'd pushed him into the garden pond.

A cold fire ignited in Isabella's eyes as she stared at the spoiled girl. So you're the one who's been tormenting my son. Your little reign of terror ends today.
###Chapter 435

Isabella turned away from the pouting girl. She led Oliver to a brightly lit claw machine.

Her fingers moved with practiced precision. The metal claw descended with perfect timing.

It grasped the coveted cat plushie Oliver had been eyeing. With a smooth motion, the prize dropped into the retrieval chute.

The oversized plush was nearly as tall as Oliver himself. He hugged the soft toy with visible delight.

"Mommy's incredible! You're the best mommy ever!" His joyful exclamation echoed through the arcade.

Amelia watched from a distance, her expression souring. She had wasted countless tokens trying to win that exact toy.

This woman achieved it on her first attempt! Pure luck, nothing more.

Isabetha smiled down at her beaming son. "What else would you like, sweetheart? Point to anything."

Oliver's eyes scanned the glass cases. "That bunny! The fluffy white one with pink ears!"

She tousled his hair affectionately. "Consider it yours."

Amelia rolled her eyes dramatically. Surely this woman couldn't replicate that fluke.

Her jaw dropped when the machine whirred to life again. Another prize tumbled out effortlessly.

Oliver applauded with unrestrained glee. "You did it again! Thank you, Mommy!"

"Wait here, darling." Isabella settled him onto a nearby velvet bench.

He obediently nodded, giant lollipop in hand. An assortment of won toys surrounded him like a colorful fortress.

Isabetha continued her winning streak. Prize after prize joined the growing collection.

Other children paused their games to watch in awe. Their envious glances focused on Oliver's mountain of plush toys.

Amelia's bottom lip began to tremble. She had nothing to show for her efforts.

Tears welled in her eyes as another toy joined the pile.

A loud, hiccupping sob escaped her. "It's not fair! You have so many!" She glared accusingly at Isabella. "Why won't you share? I want one!"

Isabella regarded her with cool detachment. "Whose child is this? Such poor manners." She turned back to Oliver. "Let's find something else to play, my love."

Oliver gathered his treasures with difficulty. His happiness radiated from his beaming face.

Amelia's wails intensified into full-blown tantrum. "Meanies! Horrible, nasty people!"

A well-dressed couple approached through the crowd. The man carried himself with understated elegance in his tailored suit.

The woman moved with theatrical grace, her floral dress swaying. This was Sophia Delacroix, scion of a renowned acting dynasty.

Trained in classical theater from childhood, she had become a celebrated prodigy. Her film performances earned critical acclaim and numerous awards.

She secured the Best Actress trophy by twenty. Marriage into the Blackwood family cemented her status among the elite.

Her reputation as devoted wife and mother remained impeccable within high society circles.
###Chapter 436

Isabella dropped to her knees and wrapped her arms around Oliver. Her voice was laced with worry. "What's wrong, sweetheart? Your father and I only stepped away for a minute. Did someone upset you?"

He burst into fresh sobs. "It was a lady and her boy! They looked shabby. They saw my nice clothes and laughed at me! They flaunted all the prizes they won right in my face!"

Oliver pointed a trembling finger. "Over there! It's them!"

Isabella followed his gaze and saw the retreating figures of Isabella Montgomery and her son. Her brow furrowed in distaste. These common people dared to bully her child?

She looked at her husband, Gregory. "Darling, you must handle this. Our son deserves justice!"

"Don't fret," Gregory assured her calmly. He appeared gentle, but his eyes held a steely resolve. "I'll contact Alexander immediately. I'll ensure he personally escorts them from the premises and adds them to the plaza's permanent ban list."

He moved aside to make the call. Isabella Montgomery walked away with her son, their arms overflowing with stuffed toys. The spectacle drew curious stares from other shoppers.

Remembering her next objective, Isabella stored all the prizes in a locker.

Just then, a stern-faced manager approached her. "Madam, you've been placed on our restricted list. You and the child must leave the premises immediately."

A blacklist? Isabella's eyes narrowed. This was unexpected. Whitmore Plaza didn't arbitrarily ban patrons. Her sharp gaze scanned the area and landed on a couple watching from a distance.

Gregory Blackwood stood holding their daughter, Amelia. His wife, Sophia, stood beside him. Both observed the scene with cold satisfaction. Amelia wore a smug, triumphant smirk that clearly said she had won.

Isabella let out a soft, derisive laugh. They thought they could have her thrown out? How amusing.

She reached into her purse and produced a matte black card. "Are you absolutely certain you want me to leave?" she asked, her voice dangerously quiet.

The manager and nearby security guards froze. Their eyes locked on the card. Their expressions shifted instantly to one of sheer panic.

It was the Obsidian Card. Fewer than ten existed worldwide. Only the most powerful elite could obtain one. Even their employer, Alexander Whitmore, didn't possess this level of access.

All staff underwent rigorous training to recognize this card. Offending its holder was a career-ending—potentially life-altering—mistake.

The manager's head bowed immediately. "Our most profound apologies, Madam. A terrible error has been made. We beg for your forgiveness."

"You make a habit of ejecting customers based on 'errors'?" Isabella's tone was icy. An aura of absolute authority radiated from her, the kind born from immense power.

Her glare swept over them. "Go inform those adults to control their ill-mannered child."

"Yes, Madam. Immediately." The manager scurried away without a second glance. Offending the Blackwoods was preferable to angering an Obsidian Card holder. Rumor claimed only Nathaniel Blackwood himself held one.

Amelia, Sophia, and Gregory, who had been waiting for the satisfying sight of the pair being humiliatingly removed, watched in confusion as the security team marched toward them instead.

Amelia stamped her foot. "You idiots! What are you doing? Throw them out!"

The manager's voice was firm, devoid of its previous deference. "Our apologies. After a full review, we found the other party violated no plaza rules. They will not be banned."

He continued, his tone formal. "Furthermore, CCTV footage confirms Miss Amelia Blackwood was the instigator of the conflict. We strongly advise Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood to provide better guidance for their daughter. Continued behavior of this nature will damage her reputation."

Three faces flushed a deep, mortified red. How dare a mere employee speak to them with such impudence? Who did he think he was?

The realization hit them. His attitude had been servile moments ago. It only changed after he spoke to that woman. She was behind this.

Who was that common-looking woman to command such fear? To make the manager choose to insult the Blackwoods rather than cross her?
###Chapter 437

The crowd closed in around Gregory, Sophia, and Amelia.

Whispers spread like wildfire through the onlookers.

Camera phones were raised, capturing the tense moment.

Sophia immediately shielded her face with her sunglasses.

She had no choice but to concede publicly.

"We'll handle her discipline properly," she stated through gritted teeth.

She linked arms with Gregory and steered him away.

Amelia burst into loud, frustrated tears.

"Why are we leaving? They're the ones who—"

"Enough," Sophia cut her off sharply. "You're a Blackwood. Act like it."

Amelia swallowed her sobs, feeling utterly betrayed.

Not even her mother offered comfort.

Gregory patted her shoulder reassuringly.

"Daddy will find out who she is," he promised in a low voice. "This isn't over."

His expression darkened as he pulled out his phone.

A quick text message was sent to his assistant.

[Track the woman and the boy. Now.]

Isabella walked away from the arcade with Oliver.

She had come to Whitmore Plaza for a specific reason.

Her target was nowhere to be found.

Had Alexander broken his old routine after all these years?

Just as doubt began to creep in, she saw them.

A group of serious-looking men in suits emerged from the elevator.

They moved with an air of importance, following one man.

Alexander Whitmore led the pack, listening to reports as he walked.

A faint smile touched Isabella's lips.

Some habits never die.

He still conducted his monthly inspection on the tenth.

Victoria would know this schedule too.

If Isabella remembered correctly, Victoria would be here today.

Victoria's public image had been carefully rebuilt.

But it was a facade, purchased with money and lies.

Isabella knew the truth.

She was here to shatter that illusion.

Right on cue, a figure in a hat and mask appeared.

Victoria slipped into Alexander's private office.

Isabella knelt down to Oliver's eye level.

"Sweetheart, I need your help with something important."

Oliver nodded eagerly, his small face serious. "I can do it!"

She whispered her instructions quickly.

He listened intently before marching off with determination.

Isabella watched him go, her eyes narrowing.

The game was finally turning in her favor.

It was time for Victoria to face the consequences.

Alexander returned to his office after the rounds.

He found Victoria waiting for him on the sofa.

She wore an elegant white dress, her hair tied back simply.

She looked every bit the refined socialite.

He ignored her and walked straight to his desk.

"What are you doing here?" His voice was cold.

He sat down and began reviewing documents, dismissing her presence.

She noticed his new assistant was not Harrison.

Another clear sign of his distancing.

Victoria remained calm.

She stood and quietly closed the office door.

"Get out," Alexander growled without looking up.

He was sick of her manipulations.

He never wanted to see her deceitful face again.

Victoria's composure cracked slightly.

Her eyes reddened with unshed tears.

"After ten years, Alexander? This is how you treat me?"

Her voice trembled with feigned hurt. "I've given you everything!"

He finally looked up, his gaze icy.

"Helped me?" He let out a cold, harsh laugh.

"Stop the act, Victoria. I know every single thing you did was for yourself."

He leaned forward, his words cutting deep.

"You're a nobody with a fabricated past. You clung to the Kensingtons out of desperation."

His eyes bore into her. "You tried to use me in your pathetic schemes against Isabella."

"Did you really think I wouldn't discover the truth?"
###Chapter 438

“You pretended to help me win Isabella while secretly plotting her death! You never intended for me to actually connect with her!”

“Did you really think I wouldn’t discover your little scheme with Harrison? That you tried to seduce Nathaniel Blackwood?”

Alexander’s voice was ice. Each word cut through the air like a shard of glass.

His expression held no trace of their past warmth. Only cold contempt.

Victoria flinched. Her face drained of color.

He knew. He knew everything.

A slow, bitter laugh escaped her lips. “Fine. No more lies. You’re right. But ask yourself this—who pushed me to this?”

“Why do you get to chase Isabella despite your ruined reputation, while I’m not allowed to find someone else? If you had treated me like you used to, would I have been driven to this?”

“You think I did this for myself? Before I tried to seduce Nathaniel, you were all I wanted! But you? You fell for Isabella long ago! You stopped loving me ages ago!”

Her voice broke with raw pain and fury.

Alexander’s frown deepened. Her words echoed in his mind. ‘You fell for Isabella long ago.’

Was that true?

He adjusted his collar irritably. “If you hate me that much, then get out. I want nothing more to do with you.”

Victoria’s smile turned mocking. Hah! Nothing to do with her? How easily he said that.

He could discard her because his heart belonged to another. But he was the man she had loved from the start!

Driven to desperation, she had tried to claim Nathaniel for herself.

All she ever wanted was to marry Alexander, be his wife, build a life together. And what did she get?

She cooled her emotions, recomposing herself. “I don’t want anything to do with you either. I’m here to propose a business deal.”

“I’m busy. Not interested.” He picked up a document, dismissing her. He had no patience for a woman who betrayed him.

She sat down opposite him. “You will be interested. I want you to buy the fifteen percent shares from Penelope and Sophia. With the Montgomery Group’s reputation damaged, twenty billion should secure them.”

“After you acquire those shares, you will marry me.”

“Marry you?” He looked up, his tone dripping with condescension. “Are you insane?”

The words stabbed her heart. She was once the world's top supermodel, the woman he vowed to marry. Now he looked at her with pure disgust.

She swallowed her pain. “Don’t worry. I don’t need a grand wedding. Just the paperwork. It will salvage my reputation.”

The negative articles were suppressed, but only thanks to Theodore Montgomery’s money. Buying热搜, scrubbing the internet, paying for fake comments—it cost a fortune.

But it was all surface. Everyone still mocked her. The Montgomerys despised her.

Only Alexander’s public forgiveness could truly clear her name.

“It will be a marriage on paper only,” she added. “I won’t interfere in your life. Furthermore, I’ll sell you my sixty percent stake at half its market value.”

“Once you acquire my shares and the fifteen percent, you’ll hold seventy-five percent of Montgomery Group. You’ll become the director. Isabella, with her mere twenty-five percent, will have to answer to you.”

Alexander’s eyes darkened. The offer was significant.

Following her plan, he could buy a controlling sixty percent at a massive discount. Combined with the other shares, he would own seventy-five percent of the entire company.

He would effectively control the Montgomery Group.
###Chapter 439

Victoria watched as Alexander slowly began to believe her scheme was possible. A subtle smile touched her lips.

“Alexander, it’s just paperwork—no ceremony, no announcements. We can draft a separate agreement stating the instant Isabella agrees to marry you, we divorce immediately. Until she accepts you, we play our parts. I get my reputation restored. You get the Montgomery shares. It’s a win for you.”

She spoke with confidence, but cunning simmered behind her calm expression. Once married to Alexander, her reputation would be salvaged. She would become the dazzling Mrs. Whitmore!

Moreover, once Alexander acquired Sophia and Penelope’s fifteen percent, the rest of the Montgomery family would hold no power. They would be left with nothing! So what if Isabella revealed her true identity then? So what if Isabella returned to the family?

By then, the Montgomery name would be a hollow shell. The family that scorned her would have nothing! When they finally uncovered the truth about her, the Montgomerys would be ruined and penniless!

If Victoria couldn’t be the heiress, neither would Isabella! Alexander sensed hidden motives in Victoria’s plan…but he didn’t care. The offer was too tempting.

Victoria wanted her reputation and to destroy Isabella. He wanted control of Montgomery Group. With those shares, his wealth would double!

Still…

He locked eyes with her. “Why should I trust you? You despise me. Why give me this chance?”

Even to save herself, she could have found another buyer. Sixty percent of shares at half price was a discount of billions! Many would marry her for that! Many! If no one would, she could sell the shares, leave Westchester, and start over abroad!

Victoria held his gaze. “Even if you don’t love me, you’re still the man I love. Besides, if I sold to someone else, Isabella might just buy them back. What’s the point in that?”

She wanted the entire Montgomery family to collapse. She wanted it beyond saving, even with Isabella’s money!

The Montgomerys looked down on her? Soon, they would understand true despair!

Instead of running, she would become Mrs. Whitmore. She would watch Isabella return to a ruined family…a family under Alexander’s control! Alexander studied her. After a moment’s pause, he said, “I agre—”

Before he could finish…BANG!

The door burst open. A cool-looking boy with blond hair stood in the doorway. “Brother, don’t believe her! She’s lying! I heard her on the phone in the stairwell! She said she has no cash and needs to use someone! She said once the share price rises, her stocks will be worth more! She talked about the Montgomerys buying back her shares, Isabella wanting them—even you would want them! Then she could sell high and watch you all fight! She plans to use the shares to force you to stay married! She wants to get pregnant with your child to trap you with sympathy!”

What?

Alexander’s face darkened. His gaze turned icy as he glared at Victoria. How calculating could she be?!

Victoria shook her head frantically. “Alexander, don’t listen to him! I’m not like that! Why would I do that? Someone must have sent him to ruin our deal! You can’t trust a child!” She jumped up and moved toward the boy.
###Chapter 440

Victoria Kensington snarled at the cleverly disguised Oliver Blackwood. “Who gave you permission to enter? You—”

“Ahh! I didn’t make any of this up! Don’t hurt me! Please! Big brother, save me!” Oliver cried out, scrambling to hide behind Alexander Whitmore.

Alexander’s gaze shifted from Victoria’s furious expression to the trembling child behind him. “Get out, Victoria Kensington,” he hissed.

He never wished to lay eyes on that deceitful woman again.

Victoria’s eyes reddened as a cold dread washed over her. “Alexander, you would trust the words of some random child over mine?”

Before Alexander could respond, Oliver quickly piped up, peeking out from behind him. “You sounded so wicked on that phone call! Who would ever believe you? Doesn’t your tongue ache from all the lies? Can you swear to God everything you said was true? If anything you said was a lie, may you die?”

Victoria’s face lost all color. Her offer regarding the shares was genuine; she truly intended to sell them to Alexander at half their market value. As for the marriage, she had hoped to gradually win his sympathy… “I never imagined you could be this malicious, Victoria,” Alexander noted her hesitation, his expression darkening. “Security! Remove her at once!”

Immediately, the security team entered and began dragging Victoria out of Alexander’s office.

She screamed, “Alexander…! Alexander! Please, you have to believe me! I never planned to inflate the share price or force you into anything! I just wanted you to eventually develop feelings for me…!”

Why would Alexander believe her now?

He waited until the guards had hauled her away before slamming the door shut with a loud bang. He never wanted to see her face again.

The security team dumped Victoria in a deserted corridor. She collapsed onto the cold floor—seething with anger, consumed by fury, and wracked with pain. It was over. Completely over! She had hoped to use Alexander’s name and influence to salvage her ruined reputation. If he had forgiven her and publicly acknowledged their marital status, she could have reclaimed her social standing. She longed to witness the Montgomery family’s bankruptcy, see Isabella fail to repurchase the shares, and watch the entire Montgomery dynasty crumble to dust. But now, that was nothing but a distant, shattered dream. It was truly over for Victoria! Alexander’s trust was irrevocably broken. No matter who she sold her shares to now, Isabella would find a way to buy them back!

Was her only option now to flee with the money and helplessly watch Isabella rescue the Montgomery family?

Victoria remained on the floor for a long time. After confirming there was no path back to Alexander, she had no choice but to leave the plaza.

Once inside her car, her new assistant, Penelope, was there, offering her a cup of coffee. “Madam, please, rest for a moment.”

The moment Victoria took the coffee, the scalding heat burned her hand. “Couldn’t you let it cool down first?” she snapped at Penelope. “How am I supposed to drink this?”

“I’m sorry! I’m so terribly sorry!” Nearly crying from fear, Penelope bowed her head and apologized profusely. The sight of her only infuriated Victoria more. Ever since her loyal agent, Isadora, had been imprisoned, nothing seemed to go right for her. Argh! She felt she would lose her mind if she stayed in Westchester a moment longer!

Unable to bear the pressure any longer, Victoria pulled out her phone and sent a text to a contact named Rex: [Contact potential buyers. Sell my shares off in separate lots. No need to rush. Aim to drive the price up, but ensure absolute discretion. No one must know.]

Victoria was desperate to cut ties with the Montgomery family quickly, but their shares weren’t worth a fortune. Waiting a few more days could net her a few extra million. Besides, leaving the Montgomerys too soon would be a gift to Isabella. She had to leave a parting gift for Isabella before she made her exit!

Isabella Montgomery stood composed and aloof within Whitmore Plaza. A cold, arrogant smirk touched her lips as she watched Victoria’s car speed away from the building. Did Victoria really think she could play games with her? She should take a long, hard look in the mirror first! Still, Isabella was curious to see what other tricks Victoria had hidden up her sleeve.
###Chapter 441

Back in Alexander’s office…
Alexander studied Oliver after Victoria left them.
“You did me a favor. What would you like in return?”

“Nothing, thank you! I don’t need anything. I enjoy helping others. But if you insist on rewarding me…”
Oliver pointed at the ring on Alexander’s thumb.
“You could give me that jade ring.”

It was a white jade ring with intricate carvings.
Emerald green patterns swirled through the pale stone like a dragon soaring through clouds.
Alexander smiled faintly at the boy’s boldness.
“You want nothing else but this ring? Do you know its value?”

Of course Oliver knew.
He had seen it at an auction with Nathaniel last year.
An antique piece that sold for ninety million.
He had loved it instantly, but his father refused, calling jade too feminine for a man.
Now was his chance.

Oliver kept his expression innocent.
“I don’t know the price, but it’s beautiful. Just like you!
I didn’t want to interfere—I was afraid that woman might retaliate.
But when I passed by, I saw how handsome you looked!
You even match well with… Isabella Montgomery.
That’s why I stepped in to help.
You and this ring share the same elegance.
I’d like to keep it as a keepsake.”

Oliver’s tone was soft and charming, nothing like his usual voice.
Lately, Alexander had been in a foul mood, but the boy’s words eased his tension.
“You think Isabella and I look good together?” he mused.

“Absolutely! They say children have a good eye for these things.
I’ve seen the news about you two.
You make an exceptional pair.
If you stay sincere and persistent, I believe she’ll return to you!”
Oliver declared with earnest conviction.

It was the first time anyone had spoken to Alexander with such encouraging honesty.
Without the boy’s intervention, he would have fallen into Victoria’s trap.
Buying 15% of the Montgomery shares without securing the promised 60% would have been useless.
Wasting twenty billion would have strained his cash flow and created unnecessary risk.

Moreover, this child had risked his own safety to help.
Victoria was not one to forgive easily.
Alexander’s gaze sharpened as he handed the ring to Oliver.
“Take it. If anyone gives you trouble, show them this ring and mention my name.”

The name ‘Alexander’ was engraved inside the band.
Few in Westchester would dare cross him.

Oliver accepted the ring joyfully.
“Thank you, Big Brother! You’re so generous!”
He beamed. “I’ll never forget you!”

With that, he clutched the ring and dashed out.
The moment he left the office, he nearly gagged.
If it weren’t for the ninety-million-dollar ring, he would never have said those nauseating things!
He knew Alexander had hurt his mother before.
This was payback.
He wondered how Alexander would react when he realized he’d been tricked by a child.
Haha!

Isabella waited upstairs for Oliver.
She saw him approaching with a wide, mischievous grin.
“What took so long, Momo? Did he harm you?”
“No, no. He thanked me and gave me this jade ring as a reward.”
Oliver handed the ring to Isabella.

She examined the antique piece.
Its craftsmanship and material spoke of immense value.
Why would a man like Alexander part with something so precious?
“Momo,” she pressed, “what exactly did you do?”
“Nothing much! I just told him what he wanted to hear.
He gave it to me willingly.
We can sell it later and invest in a ninety-million-dollar amusement park!”
Oliver chirped happily.

Seeing his delight, Isabella asked no further questions.
They left the mall together, content and satisfied.
###Chapter 442

Nathaniel Blackwood sat in his office at the top floor of Blackwood Corporation.
He held a document listing thirty-seven names.
Thirty-six were female staff from The Grand Monarch hotel.

The investigation results were clear.
All thirty-six women had fantasies about touching Nathaniel.
They were obsessed with him, his suite, even his bed.
They had rolled on the sheets where he slept.
That explained why their DNA was found there.
Thirty-six different women had slept in Nathaniel's bed over the years.

Sebastian tried to comfort him.
"Don't worry. I've already ordered their termination."
He flipped to the final page nervously.
"Look at this last person."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed.
The name on the last page was Sophia Whitmore.
That name hadn't crossed his mind in over a decade.

When Nathaniel was eighteen, he attended Westchester University.
He was the wealthiest heir in the city.
She was a scholarship student from a poor family.
Sophia was delicate, fragile like a flower.
Yet she persevered, working multiple part-time jobs.
It was the first time Nathaniel encountered someone so determined despite poverty.
Out of sympathy, he helped her a few times.
She became one of the few women he allowed close.

His family assumed they were in a relationship.
They paid her five million to leave the country.
Sophia was forced to abandon her education and dreams.
Nathaniel always felt guilty about what happened.
He tried to find her for years to make amends.
But she had vanished completely.
Over time, he pushed the memory aside.
He never formed any special connections with other women.

Until five years ago.

Sebastian watched his brother's reaction anxiously.
"Bro, what do you think? Sophia must have returned to Westchester."
"We just haven't located her yet."
"If Christopher is really her son..."

Nathaniel's expression darkened.
He had considered many possibilities.
But never that Sophia would reappear after ten years.
If she was the woman from that night five years ago...

Sebastian paced the room nervously.
"Damn it... Even you're speechless!"
"What if it's confirmed? What then?"
"I've invested so much effort helping you win Isabella."
"If your relationship falls apart because of this, I'll suffer the consequences."

Whenever Nathaniel was unhappy, Oliver became upset.
Then Oliver would complain to Uncle Sebastian.
When Nathaniel was happy, Sebastian felt like a third wheel.
When Nathaniel was upset, Sebastian bore the brunt.
Life was so unfair.

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened on Sophia's name.
"It's not a big deal."

Sebastian stared blankly. "Huh?"

Nathaniel closed the folder decisively.
"Find Sophia. Verify if it's really her."
"I'll handle the rest."

His feelings for Sophia were only pity and sympathy back then.
With a faint admiration for her resilience.
When he learned she was forced away, guilt consumed him.
But he had fought hard to win Isabella's heart.
Why would he abandon Isabella for Sophia now?

Of course...
If Isabella discovered his history with Sophia, would she be angry?
Would she despise him for it?
###Chapter 443

A dark thought took root in Nathaniel's mind. He turned to Sebastian with grim determination. "Keep this entire matter from Isabella. She must not know."

He couldn't risk anything before making her his wife.

Sebastian frowned deeply. "Brother... You're planning to conceal this from Isabella?"

"It's not concealment. I'll address it when the time is right." He would handle everything appropriately.

Nathaniel gave Sebastian's shoulder a firm pat before walking out. Sebastian felt uneasy but hoped his brother could manage the situation before Isabella discovered the truth.

Neither man noticed the figure hiding in the bathroom.

Vivienne.

She had come to Nathaniel's office that morning hoping to negotiate. Those photos of him with Isabella were her bargaining chips to force their separation.

The sudden arrival of both brothers forced her into hiding. But her eavesdropping rewarded her with explosive information.

Nathaniel was still searching for the woman from five years ago.

And that woman was likely Sophia Whitmore.

Jealousy burned through Vivienne at the thought of that penniless girl. Born into poverty, Sophia had been all doe-eyed vulnerability and pathetic weakness. Exactly the type to ensnare men's souls.

Vivienne despised her.

She had grown up with Nathaniel since childhood. Shared sandboxes and childhood dreams. Yet he never once looked at her with interest.

Worse, he had grown inexplicably close to Sophia when he turned eighteen.

She had conspired with Beatrice Blackwood to send Sophia away years ago. Never expecting her return.

Was she truly at The Grand Monarch five years ago?

If the woman he slept with was Sophia... then she would be Oliver's mother...

Vivienne's fists clenched tightly. Sophia took the five million and left Westchester. Yet she bore Nathaniel's child?

The more she thought, the more Oliver's watery eyes resembled Sophia's!

Rage simmered within her.

But her assistant Cassandra quickly intervened. "Madam, please remain calm. This is actually beneficial. Consider what Isabella would do upon discovering Sophia's existence?"

Vivienne gradually cooled at Cassandra's reasoning. She had a point.

Knowing Isabella's temperament, she would undoubtedly target Sophia. Even if she didn't, she would never tolerate Nathaniel keeping another woman in his heart.

Once Isabella was out of the picture... Sophia posed no threat. She was a fragile flower that could be crushed with minimal effort.

"Find Sophia," Vivienne commanded coldly. "Get to her before Sebastian does."

"Yes, Madam."

Meanwhile...

Nathaniel drove back to Rosewood Manor, memories from a decade ago flooding his mind.

Back then, Sophia was constantly bullied by wealthy university boys. No matter how they tried to buy her, she never yielded. She fought back fiercely.

Despite her powerlessness and poverty, she stood firm without wavering. He had never encountered such determination and strength in a woman.

He had pitied her then.

Those feelings faded over the past decade. He never thought of her until Sebastian's revelation today.

Would Isabella misunderstand if she learned about this?

When he arrived at Rosewood Manor, he found Isabella and Oliver playing checkers in matching cute pajamas. The late afternoon sun cast a warm glow over them.

The sight was breathtakingly beautiful and heartwarming.

All his doubts instantly vanished as his gaze fixed on Isabella.
###Chapter 444

Isabella’s face was bare and fresh from the shower, yet her beauty remained breathtakingly hypnotic.

Some women possessed a fleeting allure that faded with familiarity. Isabella’s was timeless.

Her radiance never dulled. Day after day, it held the same magnetic intensity.

Her eyes, especially… They glimmered like crystals drawn from ancient wells—clear, luminous, yet touched with a knowing depth. They were story-filled, compelling.

Her beauty stood in stark contrast to Sophia’s. Sophia inspired protectiveness. Isabella commanded distance.

Just then, Oliver noticed him and beamed. “Daddy! You’re home! Come say hi to the baby!”

Nathaniel frowned. Say hi to the baby?

Isabella was equally confused. “The baby in Mommy’s tummy!” Oliver chirped adorably. “I read that talking to the baby makes it smarter after birth.”

“Watch!” He turned toward Isabella’s abdomen and waved. “Hi, little sister! I’m your big brother! I’m playing checkers with Mommy now. When you come out, I’ll play with you every day! Look—Daddy’s back.”

Isabella and Nathaniel exchanged uneasy glances. Lying to a child like Oliver was a terrible mistake.

Oliver met everything with eager anticipation. His imagination knew no bounds. How would he react when he learned the truth?

Forget the future. How would he accept that his Mommy wasn’t actually pregnant?

Isabella had never faced a situation this delicate.

Nathaniel hesitated. He paused to hang his suit jacket. Then he moved toward them.

“She’s still very small,” he said gently. “She won’t start growing for another month. You should read more science books, or your friends might tease you.”

“A whole month?” Oliver looked puzzled.

Isabella ruffled his hair affectionately. “Daddy’s right. The baby hasn’t begun developing yet. We usually start interacting after three months. It’s common knowledge.”

Three months… Isabella wondered where she and Nathaniel would stand by then. Maybe by then, she’d find a better way to explain.

Oliver pouted, disappointed by their answer. “Oh… okay.”

Seeing his downcast expression, Nathaniel quickly changed the subject. “Look what I brought.”

He handed Oliver a paper bag. Inside were his favorite Orleans-style roasted chicken wings.

Oliver’s eyes lit up instantly. “Wow! Thanks, Daddy! I love you!”

Clutching the chicken wings, his mood lifted immediately. He scampered to the dining table to eat.

Isabella watched his lively little figure and smiled. Children were so pure. Their joys came so easily.

She turned to Nathaniel. “How was work? Tough?”

His expression darkened. Work wasn’t the problem. What weighed on him was far more complicated.

He had helped Sophia out of pity. But he’d helped her many times over the years.

If Sophia truly was the woman from that night, and Oliver was really her son… would Isabella still trust him?
###Chapter 445

Isabella noticed the sudden intensity in Nathaniel’s gaze when she asked her question. It was as if he were wrestling with something dark and complicated. She rarely saw him look so conflicted. “What’s wrong? Is it that difficult to talk about?”

“No.” He snapped back to the present, his eyes locking onto hers with fierce protectiveness. “Isabella, I need you to promise me something.”

“Hmm?” She tilted her head, curious.

Nathaniel’s voice was low and serious. “There might be… complications ahead. Things that could test us. I need you to trust me completely. No matter what you see or hear—trust that I will handle it. Don’t let anyone plant doubt in your mind.”

His expression was so grave it made her chest tighten. Was this about the incident five years ago? Had he uncovered something disturbing? Something that might hurt her?

A soft smile touched her lips. “You don’t have to worry. When I choose someone, I don’t waver. If I did, it wouldn’t be love.”

His eyes darkened at her words. Love. Did she really love him? He hoped so. He needed to clean up the past—fast.

After he left to deal with some documents, Isabella watched him go, her mind racing. She quickly sent a message to Maxwell. [Ask the Uncles if they’ve found anything new about Nathaniel’s incident five years ago.]

Maxwell replied almost instantly. [Will do. But there’s something more urgent.] [Tiffany is secretly trying to sell her shares. They could be gone within two days. She also just showed up at the office. Looks like she’s pushing a big project.] [We scouted Uji Quin’s compound. The place is covered in infrared sensors. The terrain is a nightmare. Even my best men can’t guarantee we can extract Robert safely.]

Isabella’s expression tightened. So Tiffany was getting desperate.

If Maxwell’s team couldn’t handle it, the mission was borderline impossible. That meant she had to go herself.

It wasn’t that she was more skilled than they were. But her body was smaller, more flexible. At the training base, she’d always been the one who could slip past detectors without setting them off. It was her specialty.

After a moment’s thought, she typed back. [Keep monitoring Tiffany. Proceed with the plan. How is Robert? Is he hurt?]

[Not physically. But it’s complicated. Robert doesn’t realize he’s been kidnapped. Uji Quin has him convinced that fasting unlocks gaming potential. The idiot hasn’t eaten or drunk anything since he got there.]

Isabella almost laughed. Robert was so sharp in some ways, so painfully naive in others. If she didn’t act soon, he might actually starve.

She glanced toward the dining room where Oliver was. Then she replied. [Prepare the jet. I leave for Kansas at midnight.]

The flight from Westchester to Kansas would take two hours. If she moved quickly, she could be back before dawn.

Tiffany didn’t return home after leaving Whitmore Plaza. She went straight to Jordan Group and demanded an emergency board meeting.
###Chapter 446

Victoria Kensington stood before the boardroom, presenting the nationwide Garden Properties initiative. She announced the requirement for a hundred-billion-dollar loan to fund the ambitious venture.

The room erupted in immediate dissent. "Ms. Kensington, have you lost your mind? A hundred billion is impossible!"

"Are you ignoring our current crisis? Montgomery shares have plummeted, causing a hundred and fifty billion in losses already. Now you want to borrow another hundred billion?"

"This project will bankrupt Montgomery Group if it fails!"

Even Penelope Sinclair voiced her concern. "Victoria, this is far too dangerous. We must be cautious."

Victoria remained seated in the director's chair, her expression unwavering. "Setting aside the financial aspect, is this not an exceptional project?"

The board members exchanged uneasy glances. Silence fell across the room. They couldn't deny the project's potential brilliance.

Their nation was advancing sixth-generation garden properties, granting even modest homes the luxury of beautiful gardens. Major developers were testing similar projects in limited regions. If Montgomery Group launched this nationwide, they would dominate the industry within two years.

But the risk was astronomical. One hundred billion dollars. Even utilizing all available Montgomery funds would leave them fifty billion in debt. Failure meant utter destruction.

"I recognize your apprehensions," Victoria addressed the tense atmosphere. "However, remember that I now hold the Director position. Any consequences will fall upon me. I accept full responsibility for this venture."

"If I'm willing to risk everything, why shouldn't you support me? Trust my judgment. I want what's best for this company. This risk promises the most substantial returns."

"I will personally secure the loan. It won't take long."

The board gradually yielded to Victoria's determined conviction. She spoke truth—she controlled the majority shares and would bear the ultimate burden. Her fearlessness became their reassurance.

Success meant enormous dividends. Crucially, with Montgomery Group hemorrhaging money, securing bank loans would signal financial confidence to investors. The new project could reshape their perception entirely.

The proposal passed with full board endorsement.

Victoria proceeded directly to the bank negotiations, carrying the Montgomery Group's official seal. Alone in her car, pure malice glittered in her eyes. Her scheme was falling into place perfectly.

She would leave Isabella Montgomery a devastating farewell gift.

The Montgomery family learned the news that same evening. Victoria was conspicuously absent from dinner.

Eleanor Kensington pressed her father. "You still haven't explained why you transferred all your shares to Victoria. Is she truly capable of handling such responsibility?"

"I find her too young and impulsive. If that fifty-billion loan gets approved, Montgomery Group faces tremendous danger for the next two years," worried Penelope added.

Gregory Kensington sighed heavily. "I would oppose it, but I have no voice anymore. Not a single share remains with me."

"Don't worry. The bank likely won't approve such an enormous loan," Richard Montgomery attempted to reassure them.

Theodore Montgomery listened silently, deep in thought. Why would Victoria take such a colossal gamble? This decision would either save or destroy the company!

She had already kidnapped Benjamin. What wouldn't she do?

Victoria sought to prove her capability. She wanted to restore her reputation. As the Montgomery heiress, the group's bankruptcy served no benefit to her.

Just as Theodore prepared to speak, the dining room door swung open.

Click!

All eyes turned toward the entrance. Victoria stood framed in the doorway.
###Chapter 447

Victoria had returned to the mansion earlier but lingered outside the dining room upon hearing their heated discussion. She knew they all despised her, yet hearing their words still turned her stomach.

The Montgomerys were never her true family. They even doubted her ability to lead the Montgomery Group. The thought of her carefully laid plans and her imminent departure from this wretched family brought a dark satisfaction. These people would soon face utter ruin and destitution! Ha! That was the price for crossing her! Her next move was to ensure every detail fell perfectly into place. She smoothed her features into a mask of placid determination and stepped into the room with a faint, practiced smile. “Grandfather, Father, Mother, Aunt Penelope, Uncle Gregory. The loan negotiation is successful. The funds will be transferred within two days.”

“Is that true?” Eleanor’s eyes widened in disbelief. Victoria secured a 50-billion loan? What bank would agree to such a massive amount? Of course, Victoria would never reveal she had mortgaged every single asset of the Montgomery Group, including the corporate headquarters. She replied with feigned calm, “Mhm. I presented our entire project proposal and offered them the highest possible interest rate. They’re willing to take the calculated risk on the Montgomery Group. I understand the concerns regarding this venture, but please trust my resolve and my capabilities. No one wants this project to succeed more than I do. I aim to prove my worth and compensate the company for any past… setbacks. In two years, our profits will soar, and our market valuation will increase by at least fifty percent.” Her ambitious declaration made Penelope and Gregory look at her with newfound interest. A fifty percent increase? Their shares would be worth a fortune! Penelope beamed with sudden approval. “Oh, Victoria, please disregard my earlier comments—I was merely anxious. If the bank has approved the loan, we have faith in your project’s success. We can simply tighten our belts for these next two years.” “Do not worry. You are my closest family. I would never hold it against you.” Victoria smiled sweetly, maintaining her impeccable facade. Though most still harbored resentment, her performance offered a sliver of reassurance. Eleanor, now calmer, recalled her earlier harshness and felt a pang of guilt. If she had wanted to meet Alexander instead of Harrison, it wasn't Victoria's fault, yet she had scorned her. Eleanor sighed inwardly; Victoria was such a diligent and forgiving daughter… She fetched a clean set of cutlery for her. “Sit, Victoria. You look thinner. You should rest at home these next few days and focus on your health.” “Thank you, Mother. Keeping busy is the only thing that makes me feel better. Actually, there is one more matter. I… Never mind. Let’s eat.” Victoria pretended to hesitate, then picked up her spoon. As anticipated, this only piqued their curiosity further.

Eleanor pressed, “What is it? You can tell us. We will help you.” “I… well, actually…” Victoria feigned reluctance, drawing out the pause. “I know my past actions were… disappointing. But many circumstances were beyond my control. Things would not have escalated so badly if someone hadn’t deliberately worked to sabotage my public image. I wasn’t sure if this person was targeting me specifically or the entire Montgomery family, so I launched a private investigation. We managed to interrogate an assistant, and she… She claimed…” Victoria trailed off, her expression growing troubled, as if she couldn’t bear to continue.

Penelope, ever the meddler, urged her on. “Victoria, who was it? Just tell us! We’ll deal with them!” “Yes. To be fair, this person is clearly malicious, constantly leaking those damaging clips. Just say the name,” Eleanor encouraged, her tone supportive. Victoria bit her lip, appearing genuinely conflicted and anxious before slowly uttering the name, her voice laced with feigned uncertainty…
###Chapter 448

“The assistant swore…it was Isabella…”

Isabella Montgomery? The atmosphere instantly chilled. Theodore Montgomery’s eyes narrowed, his displeasure directed at Victoria. “Victoria, you know how I despise liars. I will not tolerate baseless accusations within this family!”

“I understand your skepticism, Grandfather. I, too, was reluctant to believe it initially. But her assistant was adamant. If we analyze the pattern, the first photo leak coincided with the Chanel show, where Isabella ultimately replaced me. The second incident occurred during her wedding to Alexander Whitmore. She never intended to marry him; her heart belongs to another. The third leak happened at my wedding. She clearly opposed my union with Alexander.”

“Victoria, do you possess any concrete evidence regarding Isabella’s involvement with another man?” Eleanor Kensington inquired.

Victoria nodded. “Yes, I’ve witnessed it myself. Alexander Whitmore and Seraphina Delacroix are also aware. His identity remains a mystery to us. You are welcome to verify this independently.” She dared not mention Nathaniel Blackwood; the consequences of involving him would be catastrophic.

The room fell into a heavy silence, Theodore’s expression particularly grim.

Isabella’s refusal to return to the family estate… Was that indicative of another relationship?

Adam Montgomery interjected, a thought striking him. “If she had no desire to marry Alexander, why sabotage your wedding? She was the one who encouraged it…”

They had monitored Isabella closely. She had always comported herself with maturity regarding the past, showing no lingering attachment to Alexander. While her demeanor toward Victoria was cold, orchestrating such a public ruin seemed out of character.

Victoria lowered her head, feigning profound guilt. “There is something I have concealed for five years… The burden has weighed heavily on me. Now, I must confess.”

She bit her lip. “The truth is… I was present when Isabella fell down the stairs five years ago.”

What? She was there?

Eleanor frowned. Hadn’t Victoria been late to the ceremony that day?

Victoria continued her performance, voice trembling with manufactured remorse. “I came upon them arguing on the staircase. Alexander was accusing her, claiming the child she carried wasn’t his. Their fight escalated. I moved to intervene, to protect Isabella, but Alexander accidentally pushed her. She has always believed I pushed her intentionally. You can call her and ask if you doubt me.” Victoria was confident. If Theodore called Isabella, his question would be direct: ‘Did Victoria push you down the stairs?’ Isabella’s likely response, ‘Grandfather, you knew?’ would confirm her narrative.

She maintained her facade of fear and shame. “Because of this, Isabella has harbored an intense hatred for me. She believes I stole Alexander from her these past five years. Since returning from Africa, her sole focus has been revenge…” She looked pleadingly at Eleanor and Richard Montgomery. “Mother, Father, recall her first day back? Before she left, she whispered in my ear that she would utterly destroy me. That she would take everything from me until we were ‘even.’

“I’ve tried to explain, to reason with her, but she refuses to listen. She systematically strips me of everything I hold dear, meticulously planning my downfall. I never imagined my own sister could be so cruel…” Victoria’s voice broke into a weak sob, tears tracing paths down her cheeks.

The family was stunned. According to Victoria, Alexander accidentally caused the fall five years ago, and Isabella had been ruthlessly exacting vengeance ever since? All the negative press targeting Victoria was part of Isabella’s elaborate scheme? Merely over an accident Victoria claimed Alexander caused?

Richard Montgomery slammed his hand on the table with a roar. “This is monstrous! She is your sister! How could she do this? I’m calling her this instant! She will return here and answer for this!” He pulled out his phone.
###Chapter 449

Victoria did nothing to stop Richard as she wept softly into her hands.

Her sobs were perfectly timed, delicate and heart-wrenching.

She had secretly installed a blocking application on both Richard and Eleanor's phones.

The program automatically rejected all calls from Isabella Montgomery.

Just as she predicted, Richard heard the automated message.

"The number you have dialed is not in service."

She blocked him!

Victoria cried harder, her voice trembling with manufactured pain. "Dad, Mom, please stop calling her... She told me she resents you both for loving me more. She'll never come back. I'm not saying this to gain sympathy—I just want you to accept me. Everything I did... I was forced into it. I wouldn't be like this if Isabella hadn't destroyed me first. I can't even stand myself anymore..."

Her delicate features contorted in genuine-looking agony.

Eleanor moved to sit beside her, taking her hand gently. "Victoria, why did you hide this from us? We could have protected you! We could have watched her more closely!"

"I thought if I tried harder, she would eventually accept me!" Victoria's voice broke. "I believed that even if she hated me, she wouldn't sabotage our family's reputation... But I was wrong... I never imagined..."

"Don't worry, Victoria," Eleanor said firmly, turning to Theodore. "Father, you need to speak with Isabella. We must confront her about this. Yes, we favored Victoria, but that was our choice. If she plotted against our family because of jealousy, she must be held accountable! She must face consequences!"

"Exactly!" Penelope chimed in angrily. "She can't just tear this family apart because she's jealous! She's adopted! And yet she holds twenty-five percent of the company shares! How dare she act this way!"

Gregory shook his head with a dramatic sigh. "What a waste, what a shame. If it weren't for Isabella, Victoria would still be the top supermodel. She used to give us lavish gifts every month! Now we have nothing! It's disgraceful!"

"Our family is a laughingstock now," he continued. "We're humiliated everywhere we go. An adopted daughter like her never should have been allowed into this family!"

The room erupted in agreement, each voice layering on another complaint.

Richard's expression was cold, his voice cutting through the noise. "We need to reclaim her shares. Immediately. It doesn't matter who holds them—you or Father. They cannot remain in her hands."

Theodore remained silent, his face stern, brows deeply furrowed.

He didn't fully believe Victoria's story.

But she had encouraged them to call Isabella, seemingly without fear.

And she was desperately trying to win back their favor.

It didn't seem like she was lying.

Had Isabella truly done all this?

Had she sought revenge without any regard for the family's honor?

It appeared he would have to speak with her directly.

"Let's eat," Theodore finally said, rising slowly. "I will handle this."

He leaned heavily on his walker as he left the dining room.

Victoria watched him go, a spark of triumph in her eyes.

She might be leaving soon, but she would make sure Isabella's return was hell.

She would ensure Isabella was despised by everyone.

Once Theodore returned to his study, he took out his phone and dialed Isabella's number.

The same automated message greeted him.

"The number you have dialed is not in service."

His expression darkened.

Was she really with another man?

Was that why she refused to come home?

Who was he? Nathaniel Blackwood?

Theodore recalled how Nathaniel had publicly supported Isabella.

But would the prestigious Blackwood family ever accept someone like her?

Impossible!

His lawyer approached quietly. "Mr. Montgomery, do you still wish to transfer all your assets to Isabella?"

Theodore had made that decision days ago.

Victoria had taken his shares.

Benjamin was useless.

He feared all his property would eventually fall into Victoria's hands.

He worried Isabella would be bullied and left with nothing.

He wanted her to have something to rely on.

Something that would ensure her security and independence.
###Chapter 450

Theodore Montgomery never expected such complications. Transferring his assets to Isabella would spark family-wide opposition. He dismissed the idea with a weary wave. "Not now."

At Rosewood Manor.

Isabella plugged in her silenced phone while preparing for her Westhaven flight. She cradled Oliver, reading until his eyelids grew heavy. By eleven, the child slept peacefully in his bed. "I have to go out," she whispered to Nathaniel. "Watch Christopher for me."

He glanced up from his documents. "At this hour?"

She gave a firm nod. "Benjamin's in serious trouble. This requires my personal intervention."

"I could arrange—"

"Your men can't handle this situation," she interrupted. "It demands specific expertise. Stay with our son."

Isabella retrieved her tactical gear from the dressing room. Nathaniel didn't argue when she resolved like this. Yet after her departure, he immediately contacted Dominic. "Deploy a hundred men to shadow her."

"Yes, sir!"

Driving her compact car from the estate, Isabella noticed multiple missed calls from Theodore. She tried calling back but received no answer. Unusual behavior for her grandfather—he never called repeatedly without urgency.

Suspicion gnawed at her. She executed a sharp U-turn toward Montgomery Manor while contacting Maxwell. "Delay the flight one hour. I'm checking on my grandfather first."

The manor's gates stood locked at eleven, all lights extinguished. Only the entrance lamp cast a feeble glow across the property. Isabella rang the bell repeatedly until a guard appeared.

"Miss Montgomery? You've returned?"

"I need to see my grandfather." She moved to enter but found her path blocked.

"Apologies, but the Senior retired quite distressed tonight. I must inform Sir and Madam before granting entry."

Isabella's eyes narrowed. Since when did she require permission to enter her own home?

Even during her most unpopular years, no one had barred her from the family estate. This was unprecedented.

"What happened today?" Her voice turned icy and sharp.

"Unclear, Miss. Evening orders stated you couldn't pass this gate without authorization. Please understand I'm following instructions."

The adjacent guard was already calling Richard. The phone soon transferred to Isabella. She accepted it with a frosty expression, curious what explanation her uncle would offer.
###Chapter 451

Isabella took the phone, her expression hardening instantly. “What do you want?”

“What do I want?” Richard’s voice was a low, furious growl. “How dare you use that tone with me? Have you finally decided to grace us with your presence after all your gallivanting? Do you think Montgomery Manor is some cheap motel you can check into whenever it suits you?”

His anger escalated with every word. “Letting your mother bring you home was the biggest mistake of my life!” he spat. “You destroyed your own reputation five years ago, and now you’re trying to drag your sister down with you? You’ve shamed the Montgomery name! I should have ended you the day you arrived. It would have saved us all this disgrace!”

Isabella was blindsided by the tirade. Before she could form a response, Eleanor snatched the phone.

“Whatever Victoria did to you, even if she pushed you down those stairs, she is still your sister!” Eleanor’s voice was sharp, laced with venom. “That bastard child never should have existed! How can you be so vindictive? Holding a grudge for five years and now trying to ruin our family’s standing? You are utterly ungrateful!”

Isabella’s face went cold. So they knew. Victoria had gotten to them first, spinning her web of lies.

“You need to take a long, hard look at yourself, Isabella,” Eleanor continued, her words like shards of glass. “Stop spreading your legs for every stranger you meet. You’re an embarrassment. If you ever want to set foot in this house again, you will apologize to your sister. Properly. Then, and only then, might you be allowed to move your things back in. But if you think you can treat this estate like your personal flophouse, you can forget it. I wish we’d never taken you in. To me, you’re already dead!”

Each syllable was a deliberate blow. Apologize to Victoria? Sleeping around? They were swallowing every lie Victoria fed them, even after her own scandals. How could they be so blind? Did tears and dramatics always win over the truth?

Eleanor didn’t give her a chance to defend herself. She barked orders to the security team. “Make her leave. If any one of you lets her past the gates, you’re all fired. Every last one of you!” The line went dead.

The guards looked at Isabella with palpable anxiety. “Ms. Montgomery, please… don’t make this difficult for us.”

Isabella stared at the imposing Montgomery Manor. The grand, picturesque facade now felt like a cruel joke. This was her birthright, stolen from her for twenty-three years by Victoria.

Now, even returning was a battle.

A dark, cold smirk touched her lips. Soon. Very soon, they would all be on their knees, begging for her return.

She tossed the phone back to the guard and turned on her heel.

Saving Benjamin was the priority. As for Grandfather…

She slid into her car and quickly typed a message to Theodore Montgomery. [I don’t know what lies Victoria has told you, but trust nothing from her mouth. I will explain everything when I return.]

She powered off her phone and sped toward the private airfield. None of them had any idea. The adopted daughter they despised was their true heir.

At the private airport…

As Isabella’s car screeched to a halt, Maxwell was already waiting, flanked by ten of his most elite agents. They stood at rigid attention, bowing in unison as she stepped out. “Ms. Montgomery!”

Their respect was absolute. Their orders had come from the very top: protect this woman at all costs. Maxwell had told them only she could get to Takashi Yamamoto’s mountain stronghold. Where they would fail, she would succeed. Her capability was beyond question.

Isabella’s brow furrowed slightly at the sight of the large contingent. Too many.
###Chapter 452

“Why bring such a large team? Send them back to rest.”

“You’re heading to Westhaven. We have no operations there. Extra manpower ensures safety,” Maxwell explained.

Isabella countered sharply. “I’m going directly to Takashi Yamamoto’s mountain. I’ll retrieve Benjamin and return immediately. They can’t even ascend the summit… unless they intend to become mosquito bait at the base?”

Maxwell fell silent at her logic.

“Return to base and rest,” Isabella ordered the ten men.

They hesitated, disappointed. Accompanying Isabella on missions was a rare honor, yet she dismissed them so effortlessly.

Her point stood: What purpose did they serve besides being insect food at the mountain’s foot?

The team reluctantly agreed.

Isabella boarded the plane with Maxwell. The jet headed straight for Westhaven. A sudden thought struck her. “Is Takashi Yamamoto home tonight?”

“No, he’s a night owl. Clubs every evening. Poor Mr. Kensington remains trapped in the basement, starving himself foolishly.” Maxwell sighed.

Isabella relaxed. Takashi’s absence simplified everything. She entered the dressing room, changing into her stealth mission suit. She checked all necessary equipment.

Ninety minutes later, the plane landed silently on a secluded Westhaven mountain peak. The spy-model aircraft attracted zero attention.

“Landing on Takashi’s mountain would alert his guards. Driving there takes approximately one hour.”

“Understood.” Isabella exited the plane, entering a waiting vehicle. They sped toward the mountain.

The driver suddenly warned, “Maxwell, Boss Montgomery, we have a tail.”

Isabella glanced back, her sharp eyes instantly recognizing Dominic Sterling behind the wheel.

Had Nathaniel sent Dominic to monitor her?

“Ignore them. They’re with me,” Isabella stated calmly.

The driver relaxed while Maxwell frowned. With her? Was Boss Montgomery no longer cautious around Nathaniel?

What about Mr. Kensington?

The car reached the mountain base. Isabella stepped out, adjusting her custom sunglasses. She moved toward the slope.

“Exercise extreme caution, Boss Montgomery,” Maxwell called out anxiously. “If anything seems off, retreat immediately. Don’t take unnecessary risks.”

“I know what I’m doing.” Isabella calibrated her glasses. These specialized lenses detected infrared beams invisible to the naked eye.

Scanning the mountain, she observed a dense network of infrared tripwires. Triggering any would set off alarms.

Heh. Did they really think this could stop her?

She advanced steadily, her black tactical suit emphasizing her lethal grace in the darkness. Isabella moved with cold, calculated precision.

Approaching the first infrared beam, she simply arched her back smoothly, clearing it effortlessly.

The driver watched from the car window. “Hey Maxwell, want to bet? I wager Boss Montgomery reaches the summit within an hour.”

“One hour?” Maxwell frowned. Even sprinting without obstacles took over an hour from base to peak. How could Isabella possibly achieve that?
###Chapter 453

The driver grinned widely. “If Boss Montgomery reaches the summit within an hour, I get ten days of paid vacation!”

“You’re on,” Maxwell replied.

Even though he was fully aware of Isabella’s capabilities, the mountain was treacherous. Scaling it in under sixty minutes while dodging every single infrared sensor seemed nearly impossible.

But up on the ridge, Isabella didn’t follow the main trail.

She moved with purpose, scanning her surroundings with sharp eyes.

She headed straight for the area with the highest concentration of infrared beams.

Places with heavy security usually hid the most valuable secrets.

Just as she anticipated, after maneuvering through an intricate web of lasers, a narrow passage came into view.

It was carved directly into the cliff face, resembling an ancient mountain pathway.

Only one person could pass through at a time.

The entire corridor was lined with overlapping infrared grids.

Isabella’s brow furrowed.

What was Takashi Yamamoto hiding? Was he really just a professional gamer?

This level of security felt excessive.

She took a deep breath and began her approach.

She dropped into a low crouch, then sprang forward with explosive speed.

Her movements were a fluid dance—leaping, twisting, scaling the rock wall, sometimes crawling flat against the ground.

Every muscle in her body was perfectly toned.

Under the pale moonlight, her silhouette moved with an almost supernatural grace.

It was like watching a panther stalk its prey.

Roughly forty minutes later, she stood at the mountain’s peak.

Down below, the driver had been dozing against the steering wheel.

A soft chime from the monitor woke him.

His eyes snapped open.

The screen displayed a system notification: [Target has reached destination.]

The altitude sensor confirmed she was at the summit.

The driver turned to Maxwell with a triumphant smirk. “I win!”

Maxwell had been waiting in tense silence outside the vehicle.

His eyes widened in disbelief.

Forty minutes.

Boss Montgomery conquered the peak in forty minutes.

He realized, once again, that he had underestimated her limits.

At the top stood a sprawling European-style mansion.

From a distance, Isabella could make out numerous guards patrolling the grounds.

She quickly assessed her surroundings.

The nearest guard was about three meters away—the most immediate threat.

She pulled out a custom-designed air pistol.

With a nearly silent release, it fired a small pellet.

Isabella immediately covered her mouth and nose.

The pellet was one of her uncles’ inventions.

It released a colorless, odorless gas that could knock out anyone within a ten-meter radius.

Within moments, every guard in the vicinity collapsed.

Even the sentries at the main entrance slumped to the ground unconscious.

Isabella sprinted toward the mansion.

She slipped through an open window with practiced ease.

Her intel indicated that Benjamin was being held in the basement.

She activated her infrared scanner and swept the interior.

Areas with unusual energy concentrations stood out immediately.

It didn’t take long to locate the basement entrance.

But she wasn’t in a rush.

She took a moment to scan the rest of the mansion.

Then she moved swiftly toward the control room.

Within seconds, she hacked into the security mainframe and disabled the entire defense grid.

Every infrared beam throughout the compound vanished instantly.

The system attempted to send an intrusion alert to Takashi Yamamoto.

Isabella terminated the signal before it could be transmitted.
###Chapter 454

It was finished.

No more barriers stood in her way.

Isabella sprinted toward the basement entrance.

The space had no windows.

A single dim yellow bulb glowed on the wall.

Benjamin lay on a Japanese-style tatami mat, sleeping deeply.

She approached and nudged his leg with her foot.

"Wake up. You're coming with me."

His eyes fluttered open.

Recognizing her, his brow furrowed in confusion.

"Why are you here?"

"You'd starve if I didn't come," she retorted. "Get up. Now."

He remained on the floor.

"I'm not leaving. I'm training with Takashi Yamamoto."

Since arriving at the mansion, Takashi had preached about inner peace.

Gaming required total isolation from external distractions.

A secure, dark environment was essential.

Benjamin had been skeptical initially.

But Takashi descended to the basement to demonstrate.

He claimed this very space helped him find his 'gaming rhythm' years ago.

So Benjamin stayed.

Days and nights blurred together.

He avoided food and drink, seeking that elusive inner tranquility.

Perhaps it was psychological, but his skills had sharpened noticeably.

Why abandon such progress?

Isabella tapped his forehead.

"Think he's actually teaching you? This was all Tiffany's scheme. She conspired with Takashi to abduct you."

"She used a photo of you here to extort Grandfather's thirty percent shares."

"Her entire offer to train you was a trap. Your disappearance shattered our parents. They surrendered their shares to her."

Benjamin froze, processing the accusation.

Then he shook his head vehemently.

"Impossible. I don't believe you. Victoria would never do that."

"See for yourself when we get home. Move. Now. If Takashi returns, we're trapped."

She grabbed his arm to pull him up.

He yanked his arm free.

"I said no! What awaits me at home? More backstabbing? More plots over shares?"

"Even Victoria, the one person who cared, has become a stranger. There's nothing left for me there."

"Here, I can focus. I can improve. I'll return one day and prove gamers can succeed too."

A cold laugh echoed from the staircase.

"You think you can teach him? Arrogant."

Isabella spun around.

Takashi Yamamoto descended the stairs.

He wore burgundy silk pajamas, his chest bare.

He exuded the aura of a decadent playboy.

One hundred bodyguards crowded the entrance behind him, blocking escape.

He wasn't supposed to be here. He should still be at the nightclub.

His return was alarmingly swift.

Takashi toyed with two jade beads in his palm.

"Disappointed? Didn't expect me? I admit, breaching my security impressed me."

"A gut feeling brought me back early. Good thing I listened."

Isabella met his gaze icily.

"Kidnapping is a crime. You and Tiffany are partners in this?"

"I have no idea what you mean," he replied smoothly.

He turned to Benjamin.

"Benjamin. Come stand by me. Tell her: Did I kidnap you?"

"Yes, Master." Benjamin nodded obediently and moved toward Takashi.
###Chapter 455

Isabella’s eyes narrowed sharply. She seized Benjamin’s wrist, yanking him firmly behind her. “Stay behind me,” she commanded, her voice low and dangerous. “Don’t move an inch. I won’t hesitate to break your hand. You’d never play another game in your life.” Her threat was delivered with a chilling intensity. Though Benjamin was prideful and resistant, the aura she projected was utterly terrifying. He froze, too scared to argue, and obeyed without another word.

Isabella knew the situation was escalating. They needed to leave, and fast. “You actually believe you can learn from Takashi Yamamoto?” she scoffed, her tone dripping with disdain. “His skills are mediocre at best. Studying under him will only ruin your potential.” The insult hit its mark perfectly.

Takashi Yamamoto’s face flushed with anger. “How dare you question my ability just because you bypassed my security, Isabella! You’re a clueless woman. Know your place and shut your mouth!” He could tolerate many things, but having his gaming prowess insulted was unforgivable.

Seeing she had successfully provoked him, Isabella locked eyes with him. “If you’re so confident, then prove it. Right here, right now. A one-on-one match. If I win, I take Benjamin and we walk out of here. If I lose… I’m yours to command.” Her challenge hung in the air.

Takashi threw his head back and laughed. “Hahaha! A one-on-one? With me? Did you all hear that?” He turned to his bodyguards, who erupted in mocking laughter. They looked at Isabella as if she were a complete fool.

“A woman challenging Mr. Yamamoto?”
“Do you have any idea who you’re dealing with? He’s been the undefeated champion of Eternal Champions for twenty consecutive seasons!”
“Shouldn’t you be home cooking or sewing? Gaming? That’s a joke!”

Humiliation burned through Benjamin. “Isabella, just leave! You’re embarrassing yourself! And you’re ruining everything for me! Get out of here!” He feared his chance with his idol was crumbling because of her.

Isabella ignored him completely, her cold gaze never leaving Takashi. “Stop wasting time. I’ll ask one more time. Do you dare to accept?”

“Such arrogance! Of course I accept! Let’s do it!” Takashi rolled up his sleeves and strode toward two high-end gaming setups in the basement. He powered them on, smirking arrogantly. “Right here, right now. You win, you both go free. I win… you stay here and serve me.”

“Deal. I expect you to be a man of your word,” Isabella stated calmly, taking a seat at one of the computers.

Takashi sat at the other. They both clicked the game icon simultaneously. Everyone watched Isabella, their expressions a mix of pity and ridicule. A woman challenging Takashi Yamamoto? This was a foregone conclusion. She would be annihilated in seconds.

Benjamin couldn’t bear to watch. “Isabella, stop this humiliation! You’re no match for Master Yamamoto! Please, just go!” he pleaded, desperate.

“Step back and be quiet,” Isabella shot back dismissively. She logged into her account.

Benjamin was about to protest again when his eyes caught the system notification flashing on her screen: (Welcome back, Boss!)

Boss?
The name sent a jolt through him. It sounded incredibly familiar. His mind raced. Then it hit him. ‘Boss’ was the legendary, anonymous player who had defeated Takashi Yamamoto in a historic match. The only person ever to do so.

Could Isabella possibly be… Boss?
No. That was impossible. It couldn’t be her.
###Chapter 456

This had to be a coincidence! Isabella Montgomery simply shared the same username as that legendary player. Boss—nothing more than that! Then, Isabella sent a duel challenge to Takashi Yamamoto. A game notification flashed across Takashi’s screen. [Boss has invited you to a 1v1 duel!] A smaller line of text followed below: [Friendly Reminder: Player Boss has previously defeated you—stay alert.]

Takashi’s expression darkened. His eyelids twitched. Boss—the very player who had humiliated him before—was challenging him again. But wait… He was supposed to be facing Isabella. Why would Boss send him an invitation now?

Unless…

A shocking realization dawned on him. He spun around, his eyes locking onto Isabella’s monitor. Her screen displayed: [Duel request sent. Waiting for opponent to accept…]

Takashi froze. His disbelief was palpable. It was her. Isabella was the one who had crushed him, costing him billions. The Boss he had desperately tried to hunt down. The only person in the world capable of defeating him. The legendary player who had nearly forced him to rename himself “Dog”!

Benjamin Kensington, standing behind Takashi, was equally stunned. His eyes widened in shock. How… how was this possible? His own sister was Boss? The mythical figure every gamer revered?

Even the bodyguards at the entrance were speechless. They knew their master had suffered only one defeat—a humiliation that had followed him everywhere. Rivals and enemies never let him forget it. They had all underestimated Isabella, dismissing her as just another woman who knew nothing about gaming. Never in their wildest dreams had they imagined she was the legendary Boss who had humiliated Takashi Yamamoto.

Isabella remained calm, her gaze cool and impatient. “What’s wrong? Scared now that you know it’s me?”

Takashi snapped back to reality, his face flushing with anger. “Who said that? I made a few mistakes last time. Do you really think you can beat me again?”

He clicked the accept button, and the duel began. Instantly, thirty percent of Takashi’s followers received a notification: [Takashi Yamamoto is now in a 1v1 duel with Boss…]

The online community erupted. Players flooded into the spectator mode. Even those offline dropped everything to log in and watch. The comments section exploded. [Takashi didn’t change his name after losing to Boss last time. Why are they fighting again?]

[He claimed it was a fluke, that Boss cheated. Let’s see if it was really a coincidence!]

[I still think it was luck. Watch Takashi destroy Boss in seconds!]

Takashi read the comments, his resolve hardening. He had to win this time, no matter what. His reputation depended on it. He remained hyper-focused, waiting for Isabella to select her character. Just like before, she chose the Dancer.

Takashi’s eyes narrowed. The Dancer again? That same character had defeated him last time. But… Hah! He quickly locked in Daji, the Witch—a character known for her instant-kill abilities. The Dancer’s skills were primarily defensive, making her useless against the Witch’s aggressive playstyle. Two of the Dancer’s skills would be completely ineffective in this matchup.

Hah! Isabella didn’t stand a chance this time. Takashi smirked, already envisioning her defeat. He would reclaim his glory and make her beg for mercy on her knees.
###Chapter 457

Isabella Montgomery kept her eyes fixed on the computer screen, completely ignoring Takashi Yamamoto.

The match began. Since it was a player-versus-player format, both characters started with all their skills unlocked. No leveling up was required.

Takashi immediately launched an attack with his Witch character. The Witch possessed three key abilities. Her first skill was a debuff that reduced the opponent's defense by thirty percent. This made targets vulnerable and easy to hit. Her second skill cast a spell that stunned the opponent for one and a half seconds. Her ultimate ability unleashed a torrent of violent flames, capable of eliminating any foe in mere seconds.

These three skills spelled certain doom for the Dancer.

Takashi was determined to finally defeat Isabella.

Benjamin Kensington stood behind his sister, utterly speechless. He stared at the two screens without blinking. He still couldn't believe his own sister was the legendary Boss. Overwhelmed by this revelation, he needed to see if her previous victory over Takashi had just been a fluke.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of gamers worldwide were spectating the live duel. The viewer count skyrocketed past six figures.

Isabella didn't move her character. She let her Dancer avatar remain perfectly still under the protection of her crystal tower.

This inactivity provoked instant ridicule from the watching crowd. [Hahaha! Is Boss too scared to fight now?] [Hiding like a coward under her tower? Pathetic!] [Looks like Boss is going to lose for sure this time!]

Takashi felt a surge of arrogant confidence. The character he selected had a natural advantage over hers. He was absolutely certain she stood no chance of winning.

His Witch avatar swiftly closed the distance to her crystal tower. They were now only a few meters apart.

Finally, Isabella moved. Her fingers flew across the keyboard. Her Dancer emerged from the safety of the tower's shield, making herself completely vulnerable.

Takashi’s eyes narrowed. He instantly launched his first attack. But Isabella had already anticipated it. Her avatar sidestepped with lightning speed, effortlessly avoiding the blow.

Takashi scoffed. Trying to dodge? He prepared to use his second skill, the stun spell. He would finish her off in seconds!

Isabella’s special talent was useless here. Once caught in the Witch’s magical trap, she wouldn't be able to move at all. It would be an instant kill.

To his shock, Isabella activated her own special talent first: Fainting Spell. This ability rendered her opponent immobile for 1.5 seconds. The Witch was frozen in place. Takashi’s fingers were a mere tenth of a second too slow. Just one-tenth of a second!

A dangerous smirk played on Isabella’s lips. It was time for her final move. She unleashed a volley of three arrows simultaneously. The Witch’s health bar instantly plummeted to fifty percent.

Isabella triggered another powerful blow. The health bar dropped sharply to thirty percent. Takashi panicked. His eyelid twitched violently. He never expected her to activate her special talent before he could.

The Witch’s major weakness was a lack of agility compared to the Dancer. Her only defensive skill was a Sprint. But how could he use it with only thirty percent health remaining?

Damn it! He wanted revenge!

The moment the Fainting Spell wore off, Takashi desperately triggered his second ability, trying to cast the stun spell. But Isabella was ready. She activated her own second skill and sprinted away with incredible speed. It was as if she had predicted his every move. The Dancer elegantly evaded every single spell the Witch hurled her way.

Takashi’s face darkened with fury. She was running away! How was she so impossibly fast?!
###Chapter 458

Takashi Yamamoto refused to accept defeat. His eyes burned with pure rage as he pursued Isabella's Dancer. He had to activate his third ability. He needed to unleash the inferno to incinerate Isabella!

But…

He had forgotten Isabella's initial strategy. She hadn't been in a hurry to engage. She only emerged from her tower when he was practically on top of her.

Consequently, Isabella's avatar was a mere two meters from her crystal tower's safety. While his desperate final assault did land, inflicting serious damage, Isabella simply retreated back into her tower.

Even though his ultimate move had been powerful, Isabella's crystal tower continuously regenerated her health. By the time the Witch had exhausted all three of her skills, Isabella's health bar was still over half full.

Simultaneously, the Dancer's skills reset completely.

A cold smile touched Isabella's lips. She activated two skills simultaneously. She dashed toward the Witch with her second skill and unleashed a volley of three arrows with her third!

Takashi's screen went black instantly. When it brightened again, all he saw was his defeated Witch lying at the Dancer's feet.

Takashi had lost. Again.

The entire duel lasted less than sixty seconds. It was brutally fast.

The spectators were utterly speechless. A moment of stunned silence hung in the air before the crowd erupted.

[No way! OMG! That's insane!]
[Takashi lost again! The number one ranked player was defeated in under a minute! Unbelievable!]
[So precise! So ruthless! The Boss showed no mercy!]
[Her reaction time was inhuman! She attacked before he could even process it! A fraction of a second faster!]
[That was a total slaughter! This Boss has to be a professional!]
[I'm convinced she's a seasoned pro gamer! That level of skill is unique!]
[Hah! Now Takashi can't blame it on luck this time!]
[I strongly recommend he changes his ID to 'The Loser'!]

Reading the flood of mocking comments, Takashi's face darkened with fury. He never imagined he would lose to Isabella a second time. And so humiliatingly fast.

He had never experienced such public shame in his entire life.

Benjamin stood frozen beside him, his mind reeling. The idol he had worshipped for a decade was just crushed. The teacher he held in such high regard was utterly worthless compared to… his own sister! The sister he had always underestimated was revealed to be this incredibly powerful and skilled. He looked at Isabella with entirely new eyes, filled with awe and admiration.

Isabella rose from the computer terminal. She cast a calm, dismissive glance at Takashi. “You need more practice. Goodbye.”

She turned, taking Benjamin's hand to leave. Takashi seethed with venomous hatred. Did she think she could just walk away after humiliating him like that? A person like her didn't deserve to live; she was a threat that needed to be eliminated. Immediately, he signaled his guards with a sharp look. They understood instantly.

They drew their taser batons, blocking the exit, the weapons pointed directly at Isabella and Benjamin. Isabella's brow furrowed. “Breaking your promise so easily?”

“So what?” Takashi sneered coldly, his eyes filled with malice. “The end justifies the means. You humiliated me. You're the only one who can defeat me. Do you honestly believe I'd let you leave my estate alive? How naive!”

With that, he pulled out a sharp, gleaming dagger.
###Chapter 459

Takashi Yamamoto’s eyes narrowed as he demanded sharply, “Benjamin, what do you think you’re doing? Explain yourself.”

“What does it look like I’m doing?” Takashi unsheathed his dagger. The blade glinted dangerously under the dim basement lights. A cruel smirk twisted his lips. “You have two options, Isabella. One, my men beat you until there’s nothing left. Two, you cut off your own hands and crawl out of here.”

No one was allowed to surpass him. Anyone who could defeat him deserved to be erased.

If Isabella Montgomery lost her hands, she would never compete again. That would be the end of Takashi Yamamoto’s humiliation.

He threw the sharp dagger. It landed at her feet with a cold, metallic clang.

The sound echoed in the tense silence. Benjamin Kensington’s pulse raced. How could someone as refined as Isabella be forced to mutilate herself? He immediately stepped in front of her, his voice shaking with fury. “Master Yamamoto! This is outrageous! You lost fair and square! Have you no honor?”

“Silence! Do not call me ‘Master’! Do you honestly believe I wanted you as my student? I made a deal with Victoria!” Takashi scoffed, his expression full of contempt and impatience. His gaze was icy. “With your mediocre talent? I only agreed because Victoria promised to share my bed!”

He laughed, a harsh, grating sound. “Surprised? Everything Isabella said was true! Victoria lured you away from Westchester. She used you to seize control of the entire sixty percent family shares! I’ve been keeping you locked in my basement all this time, and you still call me ‘Master’? Pathetic! You are a fool of the highest order!”

Takashi reveled in the destruction. He loved shattering people’s realities.

Benjamin stumbled backward, his face pale. His world was crumbling. Had it all been a lie? Had Victoria truly manipulated him so completely? Had she really traded her body to a man like Takashi just to ruin him? Was her kindness merely a facade to steal his inheritance?

That meant Isabella had been telling the truth. She had come here to rescue him.

The sister he adored had betrayed him. The sister he despised had risked everything to save him.

Benjamin’s eyes burned. His hands clenched into white-knuckled fists.

Takashi found his anger amusing. A mocking half-smile played on his lips. “What’s this? Anger? You want to go home and seek revenge? Then convince Isabella to chop off her hands. You can even do it for her! As long as her hands remain here, I will let you both leave. Otherwise…” His voice dropped to a deadly whisper. “You will both die here today.”

His gaze was utterly merciless.

Benjamin stood his ground, shielding Isabella completely. “Never! This is insane! I won’t let you lay a finger on her!”

“Hahaha! Ahahaha! You are hilarious!” Takashi erupted in derisive laughter. He looked Benjamin up and down with pure scorn. “Oh, Benjamin! What right do you have to speak? What right? With that weak, useless body? Or those clumsy fingers that can’t even win a simple game?”

The words hit their mark. Benjamin froze. What right did he have? Takashi was right.

His whole life had been about games. He rejected every business and science course his family enrolled him in. He never studied. He never learned.

Victoria had secretly funded his gaming. She encouraged his addiction. He used to think it was kindness. He believed she was the only one who understood him.

Now he saw the truth. It was all a setup for his downfall. She was engineering his ruin.

Suddenly, he remembered the words Isabella had once said to him.
###Chapter 460

Use your brain and think properly for once. Think! If Victoria was truly good to you, why did she never encourage you to study harder? Why did our parents and the entire family give up on you? Benjamin, you’re thanking the very person who betrayed you!

You’re thanking the person who sold you out!

He hadn’t believed it then. He had despised Isabella for saying those words to him. Now, he regretted every second of his stubbornness. Under Victoria’s manipulation and influence, Benjamin had become nothing. A worthless piece of trash. How could he have ever protected Isabella?

Isabella, standing protectively in front of him, could feel the storm of emotions raging within him. She hoped he would learn from this. Of course, their primary concern was escaping this basement.

Just then, the impatient Takashi Yamamoto sneered. “You’re just useless trash, Benjamin. And you, Isabella, what can you do even if you’re skilled? Do you really think you can fight me and my hundred bodyguards? If you know what’s good for you, you’ll chop off your own hands and beg for your lives. Both of you will die the moment my patience runs out!”

“Oh, really? I suppose I should consider it then,” Isabella said coolly, bending down to pick up the discarded dagger. She tested its weight and sharpness, her movements deliberate.

Benjamin’s face paled in horror. “Isabella, no! Don’t listen to him!”

“Shut up! Let your sister think! One more word and I’ll kill you first!” Takashi snapped.

Even Isabella pushed Benjamin aside dismissively. “What do you know? Let the adults handle this. Takashi is right. If we cooperate, we get to live.”

“Hah! Finally, someone with some sense—” Takashi’s boast was cut short.

Isabella moved like a shadow. In a blink, she was behind him. The cold edge of the dagger pressed against his throat.

Takashi froze, completely caught off guard. He stood rigid, fear locking his limbs. Everyone in the basement stared, stunned. How was she so fast? How did she take their leader hostage so effortlessly?

The head bodyguard reacted first, lunging for Benjamin. But Benjamin was quicker, dodging and scrambling behind Isabella’s protective stance.

Isabella pressed the blade harder. A thin red line appeared on Takashi’s neck. “Everyone, step back. Now. Or this blade goes deeper,” she commanded, her voice icy and devoid of mercy.

The guards halted, rooted in place. They could only watch their captive boss, unsure what to do.

Takashi growled, furious and scared. “You’ll pay for this, Isabella! Hurting me is a death sentence! Murder is illegal! You don’t want to—”

He yelped as the dagger bit deeper. A trickle of blood ran down his neck.

“Try me,” she threatened, her gaze terrifyingly cold.

His legs trembled. “Get back! All of you, move!” he shrieked, his bravado gone.

The bodyguards reluctantly stepped back, creating a path.

Holding Takashi tightly, Isabella began moving toward the exit. Benjamin stayed close behind her. The air was thick with tension, a dangerous standoff with every step they took.
###Chapter 461

Robert trembled as he followed Isabella closely. He had never felt such bone-chilling fear before.

They were fortunate to have Takashi Yamamoto with them. They made it out of the basement and onto the outdoor walkway. The path was dangerously narrow, and accidents could happen at any moment. Isabella knew Takashi Yamamoto wouldn't let them escape so easily. He definitely had backup plans.

Her priority was ensuring Robert's safe exit from Takashi Yamamoto's stronghold. She pressed a hidden button. It was an emergency signal for Maxwell.

Beep!

Maxwell responded immediately. With the infrared deactivated and the walkway visible, he should arrive quickly.

"Go first," Isabella commanded Robert. "Just keep moving forward. Someone will be waiting for you at the bottom."

"I can't..." Robert instinctively protested. How could he abandon Isabella in such danger?

Isabella shot him an icy glare. "What good are you staying? You'll just be a liability. Go!"

Robert froze. She was right. He was useless here. He couldn't even protect himself.

Self-loathing washed over him. He hated his own weakness. Swallowing his pride, he turned toward the passage. He had to leave without causing more trouble for Isabella.

As Robert stepped onto the walkway, a bodyguard moved to intercept him. Isabella instantly dragged Takashi Yamamoto to block the entrance. She pressed her dagger against his throat.

"If even one hair on his head is harmed," she threatened coldly, "Takashi Yamamoto dies right here."

The terrified man screamed at his guards, "Don't move! Listen to her! Back off now!"

The bodyguards reluctantly retreated. No one dared touch Robert. His footsteps grew fainter until they disappeared into the night.

Takashi Yamamoto's eyes narrowed. He hadn't seen anyone at the mountain's base earlier. His alarm system hadn't been triggered either. Yet someone was waiting for Robert down there!

How many people had Isabella brought? He didn't know she only came with two men. More would have been detected. A small team was easier to conceal.

Isabella maintained her vigilant watch. Her eyes never left the bodyguards or Takashi Yamamoto's movements. Nothing could go wrong now.

Time passed slowly. Takashi Yamamoto's back ached from the tense position. He spoke with forced condescension, "Isabella, this is all a misunderstanding. Your brother is safe now. Why not let me go? I promise you'll leave unharmed."

"Shut up," Isabella snapped coldly. She was still calculating how long Robert needed to reach safety.

Takashi Yamamoto flinched at her tone. No one had ever spoken to him like that since childhood. Yet with Isabella, he didn't dare fight back. He could only roll his eyes in frustration.

How dare she treat him this way? She would pay for this!

After twenty minutes, Isabella finally narrowed her eyes. "You're right about one thing," she told Takashi Yamamoto. "Do exactly as I say, and I might let you live. Try anything funny, and you're dead."

She released her hold on his neck and delivered a powerful kick to his backside.

Thud!

Takashi Yamamoto went flying toward his hundred bodyguards. Isabella immediately sprinted down the walkway.

Pain shot through Takashi Yamamoto's buttocks as he roared, "After her! Now!"
###Chapter 462

“Yes, Sir!” Takashi Yamamoto’s hundred bodyguards immediately charged toward the wooden pathway.

Concealed in the darkness beyond the estate were his archers, poised to unleash a deadly volley of arrows at Isabella Montgomery as she fled through the forest.

Swish, swish, swish!

Dozens of arrows sliced through the night air, their razor-sharp tips aimed directly at her shadowy figure.

Isabella’s brow furrowed. Had Takashi stationed snipers around his property?

Hah!

If she dared to come alone, she certainly had a plan to leave unscathed.

With agile precision, she weaved left and right, evading each projectile effortlessly.

She retrieved a compact, owl-claw grappling device and launched it skyward.

The metal claw embedded itself into a thick tree branch, allowing her to swing through the air gracefully.

In one fluid motion, she propelled herself more than ten meters forward, creating significant distance from her pursuers.

A quick press of a button retracted the device seamlessly back into her hand.

A faint smile touched her lips. Her uncles’ latest invention proved incredibly useful. The upgraded sensitivity far surpassed previous models.

She repeated the maneuver several times until she reached the mountain’s base.

The bodyguards now trailed over two hundred meters behind!

A sleek black car idled silently within the shadowy woods.

Inside, Benjamin Kensington kept vigilant watch over the path.

The moment he spotted Isabella, he flung the door open urgently. “Isabella, hurry! Get in!”

She leaped into the vehicle without hesitation.

Leaning out the window, she extended a triumphant thumbs-up before abruptly flipping it downward.

The pursuing bodyguards witnessed the taunting gesture as the car sped away.

Fury burned within them. Her skills were unnervingly superior, and she mocked them openly! Damn her!

The team leader immediately contacted Takashi. “Sir, she escaped in a black sedan.”

Upon hearing the news, Takashi’s face darkened with rage.

He hurled his phone against the ground violently. Damn it! How did that woman slip through his fingers?

She had humiliated him profoundly!

As long as she lived, he would never reclaim his title as the top player in Eternal Champions. He would remain a permanent laughingstock!

His butler approached cautiously, offering consolation. “Sir, please remain calm. Have you forgotten our earlier contingency? Her taking Benjamin away actually works in our favor. If he had died here, the complications would have been significant…”

Takashi’s eyes gleamed with sudden realization. Right, he had almost forgotten.

It was better that Isabella took him. Benjamin would still be utterly ruined regardless!

Meanwhile…

The car raced toward the private airfield where their jet awaited.

They boarded swiftly, and the cabin door sealed shut as the plane prepared for immediate departure.

Only when everyone was securely seated did a collective sigh of relief echo through the cabin.

“Boss Montgomery, you’ve shattered records again!” Maxwell Carter exclaimed admiringly. “The entire rescue took under three hours! And you successfully retrieved Benjamin!”

Isabella frowned. Three hours?

She quickly checked her phone. It was nearly six in the morning!

Oliver Blackwood typically woke between seven and eight. If he didn’t find her there, he would panic…

“Instruct the pilot to accelerate,” she ordered Maxwell urgently. “I’m on a tight schedule.”

“Understood.” Maxwell hurried toward the cockpit to relay the message.

Benjamin sat beside her, studying her intently, his emotions swirling chaotically within his gaze.

Who exactly was Isabella Montgomery? She commanded a private jet and a team of fiercely loyal operatives.

Most astonishingly, her combat skills were impeccably refined! She extracted him from a heavily guarded compound completely unharmed!

Remembering all the pain he had inflicted upon her since childhood, overwhelming guilt consumed him.

He opened his mouth to speak, but a sudden, searing pain erupted from his abdomen.

Agh! The agony was blinding!
###Chapter 463

Benjamin Kensington writhed in agony, curling into a tight ball on the leather seat. His hands clamped over his abdomen as a guttural moan tore from his throat. “Argh!”

Isabella Montgomery’s brow furrowed instantly. “What’s happening?”

“It…hurts…so much!” he gasped before his body went limp. He collapsed onto the aircraft’s cold floor.

Thud.

He was out cold. Isabella dropped to her knees, her fingers urgently tapping his pale cheeks. No response. Within seconds, his complexion turned a ghastly, ashen grey. A cold dread shot through her. She pressed two fingers beneath his nose, seeking any sign of breath. Her hand recoiled sharply.

He wasn’t breathing.

Panic surged, but she forced it down. “The emergency kit! Now!” she barked, her voice cutting through the cabin’s hum.

Maxwell Carter was already moving. He retrieved the advanced medical kit, stocked with experimental drugs and cutting-edge resuscitation equipment.

Isabella’s fingers flew through the contents. She seized a single, unmarked white pill. Reborn. A prototype developed by her mentor, Silas Granger, and his top research team. It was designed for catastrophic organ failure, a last-chance gamble that had to be administered within thirty seconds of clinical death.

She pried his jaw open and placed the pill on his tongue. It would dissolve instantly.

Next, she grabbed the portable CPR device, pressing the electrode pad firmly to his chest. The machine whirred to life, delivering rhythmic, precise compressions.

“Divert to the nearest hospital in Westhaven!” Maxwell ordered the pilot.

“No!” Isabella’s command was absolute. “Continue to Westchester! Full speed!”

Westhaven was Takashi Yamamoto’s domain. Any hospital there would be compromised. Benjamin would be a sitting duck.

Maxwell nodded grimly, understanding the unspoken danger. He clipped small electronic nodes to Benjamin’s palms and the soles of his feet. They emitted a low-frequency current, designed to prevent neuromuscular lock-up and stimulate neural activity.

Sweat beaded on both their foreheads. The only sound was the mechanical thump of the CPR device and the low hum of the nodes.

Isabella’s mind raced. He couldn’t die. Not like this. Victoria Kensington had manipulated him his entire life. He had only just begun to see the truth. He deserved a chance to live it.

And Theodore Montgomery… How could she ever tell that gentle old man he had lost his grandson?

Her will became a tangible force. She poured every ounce of her focus into the fight for his life.

Nearly an hour later, a miracle. Benjamin’s index finger twitched.

“He’s back!” Maxwell exclaimed, relief washing over his face. “Vitals are stabilizing!”

Isabella’s breath hitched. She checked for a pulse. Faint, but there. Steadying.

She immediately shut down all the devices, removing the pads and clips. She leaned close to his ear, her voice low and fierce.

“Fight, Benjamin. Do you hear me? Your grandfather is waiting. Everyone is waiting. Victoria needs to be exposed. You can’t leave this unfinished. You will not drag me down with your failure. Stay. Alive.”

He remained unconscious, unresponsive, trapped in a fragile state between life and death.

It was a critical situation.

The jet finally touched down at the Westchester private terminal. Maxwell’s team was already waiting on the tarmac with a stretcher. They carefully transferred Benjamin’s still form.

Isabella never left his side. She slid into the back of the waiting SUV beside the stretcher.

“Grace Memorial Hospital. Now,” she instructed the driver. It was the largest, most secure private hospital in the city, located mercifully close to the airport. Their exorbitant fees guaranteed immediate, discreet, and top-tier medical attention. It was his best chance.
###Chapter 464

The helicopter blades sliced through the air as Dominic Sterling and his team returned. Through the window, Dominic spotted Isabella Montgomery and her security detail rushing away in vehicles. He immediately pulled out his phone to contact Nathaniel Blackwood.

The call jolted Nathaniel awake. “Sir, Benjamin appears to have lost consciousness. They are currently en route to the hospital with great urgency.” Nathaniel’s voice was sharp with command. “Contact Grace Memorial Hospital. Instruct them to prepare a full medical team and a trauma bay immediately. Now.”

Across the city, at Montgomery Manor, Victoria Kensington’s phone lit up with a message from Takashi Yamamoto. (Beautiful, I’ve expended significant effort on your behalf. You owe me a visit. Make it soon. A compensation is in order. Yes, Isabella retrieved Benjamin, but he has been poisoned. He is essentially a corpse at this point.)

Victoria’s heart hammered against her ribs. A cold dread washed over her. He had been saved? She had anticipated this possibility, but not so quickly. The timeline was accelerated. If Takashi confirmed the poison, then Benjamin should already be dead. Deceased. Gone.

A wave of nausea hit her. She had never been responsible for a death before. Her hands trembled. It took several minutes of controlled breathing to steady her nerves. She then placed a call to a contact she knew only as ‘Rex’. “I require visual confirmation. Photographs of Benjamin Kensington in critical condition. Send them to me.”

Minutes later, her phone chimed with several images. They showed a gurney being rushed into an emergency room. Victoria’s brow furrowed in confusion and rising panic. Why was he still alive? The poison should have been fatal. Why was he in the ER? A new text from Rex appeared. (Rex: My sources indicate Isabella performed emergency resuscitation on site. She stabilized him enough for transport. He remains unconscious. His survival is not guaranteed.)

Unconscious. Not dead. That meant he could potentially wake up. If he regained consciousness, everything would unravel. Her entire scheme would collapse. A desperate, calculated idea flashed in her mind. She sprang from her bed and ran into the hallway.

She rushed toward Theodore Montgomery’s private wing. Her frantic knocking echoed in the quiet corridor. “Grandfather! Wake up! It’s a catastrophe!” she cried, her voice cracking with manufactured hysteria.

The door was opened by the head butler, Reginald Thornton. “Ms. Kensington? What is the meaning of this disturbance?”

“I must see my grandfather! Immediately!” she sobbed, pushing past him. “Grandfather! Please!”

The commotion drew Theodore from his bedroom. He emerged, concern etched on his aged face. Seeing him, Victoria threw herself forward. Her knees hit the polished floor with a sharp thud. She clutched at the fabric of his pajamas, her body wracked with theatrical sobs.

“Grandfather, it’s horrible! Isabella… she… she has harmed Benjamin! She did it to frame me! To turn everyone against me! She… she has killed him! Oh, God!” she wailed, her performance flawless.

Theodore recoiled as if struck. “What? What are you saying? What has happened to Benjamin?!”

“My… my friend just called me!” she choked out between sobs. “Benjamin has been taken to the emergency room at Grace Memorial! He’s unconscious! The doctors say he might not… he might never wake up!” Her cries were raw and desperate.

The color drained from Theodore’s face. He staggered backward, his legs buckling. Reginald lunged forward, catching the old man before he could fall. Theodore’s lips trembled. His grandson. His only grandson. Harmed.

The noise had alerted others. Eleanor Kensington and Richard Montgomery rushed into the room. “Benjamin? What’s wrong with Benjamin?” Eleanor demanded, her voice shrill with fear.

“It’s my fault! All my fault!” Victoria cried, kneeling on the cold floor, her head bowed in a show of utter remorse. “The pressure… everyone in this family looks down on me! I made a terrible mistake! I lied to Grandfather! I told him I had kidnapped Benjamin to force him to transfer thirty percent of the family shares to me!”

Gasps filled the room. The shocking admission hung in the air. The motive for the sudden share transfer was now horrifyingly clear.
###Chapter 465

Victoria sobbed uncontrollably as she explained. “Everything was fabricated—I deceived Grandfather. I never abducted Benjamin. I merely assisted Benjamin in connecting with Takashi Yamamoto to train together in Westhaven. Benjamin had developed a passion for competitive gaming, and I only wanted to support his ambitions. The photographs I showed Grandfather were taken when he was instructed to remain in the basement. Takashi was helping him cultivate greater patience and focus…”

She pulled out her mobile device, displaying her message history with Takashi Yamamoto. The exchange was clearly visible: [Takashi Yamamoto: Ms. Kensington, please do not worry; I will ensure your brother's well-being. He is adjusting, though still acclimating to the new regimen.] Several images of the basement were attached. The space did indeed contain two high-end gaming computers. One photo showed Benjamin seated before a monitor, wearing headphones. Theodore Montgomery’s expression turned stormy. So Victoria had manipulated him? There had never been an actual kidnapping?

Benjamin was never abducted… It was all an elaborate scheme for Victoria to acquire the company shares? Eleanor didn’t immediately challenge the deception regarding the shares. Instead, she pressed, “You claimed Benjamin was in poor condition? Explain what happened.” “Waa…! It’s Isabella! She’s still not satisfied after publicly ruining my reputation! Now that all of you have transferred your shares to me, she’s consumed by fury! Last night, she went to Takashi Yamamoto’s residence and forcibly took Benjamin! He was perfectly fine when she took him, but after they returned to Westchester, Benjamin was rushed to the emergency room…”

Victoria wore a mask of profound worry and guilt, her body shaking with sobs. “She wants all of you to despise me! To blame me for abducting Benjamin and causing him harm! Waa… Benjamin is so young! How could she possibly injure him? He’s completely innocent!” She broke down into tears once more.

Eleanor and Richard were visibly stunned. True, Benjamin had been a profound disappointment to the family, but he was still their blood relative. They never wished any actual physical harm upon him.

Who could have imagined Isabella was capable of such a monstrous, inhuman act!

Richard’s voice was icy with contempt. “Prepare a car for Grace Memorial Hospital immediately! Ensure that ungrateful wretch Isabella is still there when we arrive!” Theodore followed them, his anxiety palpable. He had not seen the message Isabella had sent him.

At Grace Memorial Hospital.

After over an hour in the emergency room, Benjamin was finally transferred to a private ward. The lead physician approached Isabella, his tone deeply apologetic. “Ms. Montgomery, I regret to inform you that we have exhausted all immediate options. We have been unable to identify the specific toxin administered to Mr. Kensington. Based on his current vitals and neurological responses, it is highly probable he will not regain consciousness.”

Never wake up? A permanent vegetative state? Isabella’s brow furrowed deeply. “Explain. You cannot even trace the origin of the poison?” “We have drawn extensive blood samples for comprehensive analysis, but the results will require a minimum of seventy-two hours. This toxin is exceptionally complex. It appears to induce acute neurological death, directly attacking the central nervous system and cognitive functions. He is fortunate you initiated resuscitation procedures so promptly. Otherwise… Well.” He sighed heavily.

Isabella’s eyes darkened. Acute death? When she had boarded the private jet with Benjamin, there had been no signs of poisoning… Their environment had been secure.

At that moment, the rapid, heavy sound of approaching footsteps echoed down the corridor. Isabella turned. Theodore Montgomery, Richard, Eleanor, and Victoria were striding toward her, their faces contorted with pure, undiluted rage. They had evidently heard the doctor’s grave prognosis.
###Chapter 466

Isabella’s eyes narrowed as Eleanor stormed toward her, hand raised high. The slap never landed—Isabella caught her wrist mid-air, grip firm and unyielding.

“Explain yourself,” Isabella demanded, voice cold as steel.

“Explain? You want an explanation?” Eleanor’s voice trembled with rage. “Why is Benjamin in the hospital? Who poisoned him?”

A bitter laugh escaped Isabella’s lips. “You should be asking your precious daughter, Victoria. Ask her why she arranged his kidnapping. Ask her why he was poisoned.”

The accusation hung heavy in the air, met with scornful glares. Even Theodore’s expression darkened with disapproval. Victoria’s lies had taken root—they believed Isabella was the one framing her.

“How dare you!” Eleanor snarled, wrenching her hand free. “After what happened five years ago, you’d stoop this low? Using an innocent boy to destroy Victoria’s reputation?”

Isabella’s jaw tightened. Frame her? What twisted story had Victoria fed them?

Tears welled in Victoria’s eyes as she stepped forward, playing the victim perfectly. “Isabella, I know you hate me. I understand if you want revenge—but leave Benjamin out of this! He’s done nothing wrong!”

Her voice broke, each word dripping with false sincerity. “Do you think poisoning him will make everyone blame me? I’ve already told Grandpa and our parents everything—they won’t be fooled by your schemes!”

She clutched Isabella’s arm, sobbing dramatically. “Please, just admit what you’ve done. Give him the antidote. I’ll beg them to forgive you—I promise!”

Isabella’s patience snapped. She shoved Victoria away, disgusted. “If you’ve already decided to believe her lies, I have nothing more to say. The blood test results will reveal the truth in three days.”

She turned to leave, but Victoria lunged again, desperate. “Three days is too long! He’ll die because of you! Fine—let’s say it was me! I poisoned him! I’ll take the blame! I’ll even give you my sixty percent shares—just save him!”

Eleanor yanked Victoria back, shielding her. “Don’t you dare! She doesn’t deserve a single share! After everything we’ve done for you—this is how you repay us? Bringing you into this family was our biggest mistake!”

Richard turned to Theodore, voice firm. “Father, strip her of the Montgomery name. Revoke her twenty-five percent share. She is no longer one of us.”

The room fell silent, awaiting Theodore’s verdict.

If he agreed, Isabella would lose everything—her name, her inheritance, her place in the family.
###Chapter 467

Theodore Montgomery stared at Isabella, his expression deeply troubled. He wanted to believe her. He truly did. But every single piece of evidence pointed directly at her. It was a devastating blow. Her continued silence, her refusal to answer his calls, only made everything appear worse.

For years, Victoria had been the dependable one. She always answered, no matter the time or place. She checked in, she reassured him. She made him feel cared for.

Isabella was different. Since her return, she was a ghost in the manor. Rare visits. Even rarer calls. He was an old man. His heart craved simple respect and affection from his grandchildren. If Isabella truly held such malice for the Montgomerys… if she felt nothing for them… the thought shattered him.

Isabella met his gaze, her own solemn. She was not like Victoria. She didn't deal in pretty words and empty promises. Her proof was always in her actions. She had given her word she would save Benjamin. She intended to keep it.

She never anticipated this.

A heavy weight settled in her chest. What could she possibly say to him now? How could she explain this tangled web?

Would the one person in this family who had shown her genuine trust ever believe her again?

A long, weary sigh finally escaped Theodore. "We will discuss this when Benjamin wakes," he declared, his voice heavy with exhaustion. "His recovery is our only priority now. Richard, use every resource. Contact the finest medical specialists globally. Money is no object."

Richard nodded, though his sharp, blade-like glare never left Isabella. "This isn't over. Once he's conscious, we will have our answers. Be ready with those transfer documents." He turned on his heel and strode away.

Eleanor was equally furious. Her face was a mask of cold rage. "Your grandfather's patience is not ours! Get out. We will care for Benjamin. You are no longer a part of this family. Do not ever call me your mother again. I regret the day we brought such a viper into our home!"

Her words were ice, meant to wound.

Before Isabella could respond, Victoria clutched her arm, her voice a trembling whisper. "Mother, please… don't say such things. You'll upset Isabella…"

A cold, mocking laugh escaped Isabella's lips. Her eyes locked onto Victoria's feigned concern. "Enjoy your performance while it lasts, Victoria. It ends the moment Benjamin opens his eyes."

Her tone was a promise, laced with frost.

She turned and walked out, leaving a chill in her wake.

Victoria felt a shiver of genuine fear. Could he really wake up? It was supposed to be impossible. Takashi Yamamoto had guaranteed the poison was lethal. Keeping him alive was a miracle in itself. Waking? Unthinkable. She just needed two more days. Then she would be gone from Westchester forever. Benjamin simply could not wake before then.

A dark, oppressive cloud seemed to follow Isabella out of Grace Memorial Hospital. Her family placed Victoria on a pedestal. She was the golden child, beloved since infancy. Her words were gospel.

Victoria was the poisoner. Yet she had masterfully twisted the narrative, painting herself the victim. Isabella, no matter what she did, was always viewed with suspicion and disdain.

They were her blood. Her parents. And yet…

No. Panic was a luxury she couldn't afford. Demanding a DNA test now would only make her look utterly unhinged. She had to wait. Just a little longer. The truth would surface. It had to.
###Chapter 468

Isabella remained deep in thought, analyzing Victoria's next potential move.

A sudden roar shattered her concentration.

"Isabella Montgomery! Return my grandson this instant! I'll beat that wretched girl to death!"

She looked up to see William and Beatrice Kensington storming toward her.

These were Eleanor's parents—her maternal grandparents.

Eleanor had been their only daughter, and they adored her children immensely.

They had reserved substantial family assets for Victoria and Benjamin.

Vacationing abroad when news of Benjamin's crisis reached them, they had rushed directly to the hospital.

Beatrice now raised her walking cane, preparing to strike Isabella with full force.

Caught off guard, Isabella barely registered the attack.

Just as the cane descended, a powerful hand intercepted it mid-air.

In the next moment, she was pulled into a solid, protective embrace.

She glanced up at Nathaniel's striking profile.

His expression was ice-cold, radiating undeniable authority.

Matte black sunglasses concealed half his face, revealing only his sharp, commanding jawline.

Beatrice failed to recognize him as she shook her cane violently. "Who do you think you are? Release my cane! I'm disciplining my granddaughter! Step aside immediately!"

"I protect what's mine. This doesn't concern you," Nathaniel's voice resonated deeply as he released the cane.

Beatrice stared in shock. His woman? Isabella belonged to him?

A realization dawned on her face. She scowled at Isabella. "Now I understand! No wonder Victoria mentioned you keeping some stray man! That's why you refuse to return home! It's true!"

William stepped forward, his expression dark. "Isabella, do you believe wealth grants you impunity? How dare you shame our family with this... this paramour!"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. A stray man?

Never had anyone referred to the President of Blackwood Corporation in such terms.

And they dared insult his woman in his presence.

He began removing his sunglasses.

Isabella caught his hand, her gaze hardening toward her grandparents. "When I have a genuine partner, you call it shameful. Yet when Victoria sleeps with numerous men—including her fiancé's assistant—what exactly would you call that?"

Her clear voice hung in the air.

The elderly couple's faces stiffened instantly.

Their agitation intensified at her words.

They had been on an extended cruise when the scandal erupted.

The voyage to a remote island had taken two months without port calls.

They remained confined aboard until returning just last night.

Victoria had always been their cherished granddaughter.

They never anticipated such disgraceful behavior.

Upon their return, they immediately contacted Eleanor.

Hearing the truth from her had enraged them.

After a stunned moment, Beatrice's glare sharpened. "How dare you mention that? Your mother rescued you from the streets! Clothed you! Fed you! And you repay her by destroying our family! Victoria's reputation would be intact if not for your schemes! I've never witnessed such ingratitude!"

Another accusation of thanklessness.

Isabella had grown accustomed to these claims.

A mocking smile touched her lips. "If you insist on labeling me ungrateful, so be it. Your opinion means nothing to me."

She scoffed, tightening her grip on Nathaniel's hand.

They walked past the elderly couple shoulder-to-shoulder.

Her steps were crisp and deliberate.

Undeniably arrogant.
###Chapter 469

Zachary and Pam stared in disbelief. They couldn't comprehend such audacity from an adopted daughter.

She had transformed into someone entirely unrecognizable from five years ago... Pam clutched her chest, stumbling backward. "Oh heavens! Oh heavens! Why did Eleanor bring home this wretched girl? How could she be so utterly ungrateful?!"

"Grandpa! Grandma!" A honeyed voice cut through the tension.

Victoria had heard the commotion outside. Seeing them berating Isabella, she rushed forward. She gently supported Pam, her voice dripping with feigned concern. "Please don't upset yourself, Grandma. Don't harm your health. Isabella didn't mean to provoke you... She's still immature... speaks without filtering her thoughts..."

"Immature? You share the same birthday! How are you so compassionate while she's so vile?" Pam's fury intensified at the reminder of Isabella's defiance.

Zachary snorted in contempt. "What was Senior Theodore thinking? They clothed and fed this foundling for years. He even gifted her substantial family shares. She not only framed you but attempted to murder Benjamin! A despicable creature! I must confront Senior Theodore immediately!"

"Grandpa, no! Isabella is still family. She carries our name. We can't do this to her..." Victoria hastily intervened, her voice trembling.

"Look at you! Too kind-hearted! That's why that wicked Isabella set you up! Don't stop me. I'll handle this. She doesn't deserve our surname!"

Pam grasped Victoria's hand, her face etched with worry. "Instead of defending that ingrate, focus on yourself. Look at you! Only two months and you've withered away!"

"No, Grandma, really... I'm perfectly fine..." Victoria's eyes welled up. Her voice cracked, thick with emotion. Her tear-filled gaze made her appear profoundly wronged and pitiable.

It shattered Pam's heart. "Oh, my precious granddaughter..." She soothingly stroked Victoria's hand. "Don't pretend with me. I know you've suffered. But rest assured, we all believe you. Since Isabella harmed Benjamin, it proves she wants you both dead to seize all Montgomery shares. We won't allow it."

"Ah, yes! We bought you a magnificent gift on our vacation. Come with us later. I'll show you."

A dark glint flashed in Victoria's eyes.

Pam and Zachary lived independently. They owned over a dozen mansions. Countless priceless treasures filled their homes. Zachary was a renowned antique collector and appraiser. Their collection contained immensely valuable artifacts.

Selling it all would net Victoria a colossal fortune! Her departure was in two days. She never anticipated another massive windfall! Once she left Westchester, the Montgomery family would plunge into chaos. These two elders would be left destitute. She wanted Isabella to return to a shattered, bankrupt family!

The thought made her expression sweeter, more docile. "Thank you, Grandma."

"Oh, darling, no need for formalities! So polite! I'll check on Benjamin and speak with your parents. Wait for me." Pam patted her hand and entered the hospital room.

After they left, Victoria slipped into an empty hallway. She retrieved her phone. A text message flew to Rex:

[Make arrangements regarding William and Beatrice...]
###Chapter 470

Rex’s message flashed on Victoria’s screen.
He confirmed a potential buyer for 60% of the shares.
But the offer stood at only 80 billion.

Eighty billion? Victoria’s brow furrowed.
The Montgomery Group’s shares were worth far more.
That lowball offer was insulting.

She typed a swift reply.
Not selling below 95 billion.
She wouldn’t accept anything less.

Rex responded immediately.
The buyer refused to go higher.
He cited the family’s damaged reputation.
His tone was firm and unyielding.

Victoria felt the pressure mounting.
Eighty billion was a substantial amount.
But it wasn’t enough for what she needed.

Her situation was growing desperate.
Everyone despised her now.
She had to flee Westchester soon.

Where would she go?
Starting over required funds.
New identity, new life—all costly.

As she pondered, movement caught her eye.
A man in dark green stood at the hallway’s end.
She recognized him instantly—her wedding day.

She glanced around nervously.
Everyone was still in Benjamin’s room.
She hurried out to meet him.

The man waited under a garden tree.
The spot was secluded and empty.
Victoria approached him, furious.

Why are you here? she demanded.
Did you spend all the money already?

I’m not here for money, he began.
Victoria cut him off sharply.

I don’t care why you’re here, she snapped.
Leave now. Don’t ever contact me again.

My life is falling apart, she hissed.
I have no time for you.
I owe you nothing.

The man sighed heavily.
Victoria, I came to take you home.
Just come with me. You’ll understand.

Home? she laughed bitterly.
Where were you when I needed you?
When my mother struggled alone?

Her voice trembled with rage.
Memories flooded back, painful and sharp.
Her eyes reddened with unshed tears.

My mother worked as a cleaner, she spat.
Pregnant and exhausted every day.
She barely slept or ate.

She had nothing when I was born.
Couldn’t even pay the hospital bills.
She died three days after giving birth.

She swapped me into the Montgomery family.
So I wouldn’t end up like her.
So I could have a better life.

I lived in constant fear.
Terrified they’d discover the truth.
I avoided hospitals, blood tests, everything.

I was paranoid about leaving evidence.
Even a single strand of hair.
Every day was a nightmare.

The man looked down, guilt-ridden.
He tried to speak her name.
Victoria cut him off violently.

Don’t say my name, she snarled.
You gave me nothing. Not even my name.
You weren’t there for twenty-three years.

Now you show up because I’m rich?
Have you no shame? No guilt?
Get out of my sight forever.

I don’t want your money, he insisted.
Victoria shoved him hard.
Go! Now! Leave me alone!
###Chapter 471

Victoria pushed the middle-aged man away with force.

He stumbled backward, nearly losing his balance.

Seeing her agitated state, he had no choice but to retreat.

After a few steps, he turned back to offer his business card.

But Victoria had already vanished.

His outstretched hand hung awkwardly in the air.

A bodyguard in black approached him quietly.

"Sir, should I have someone else explain things to Ms. Kensington?"

"Not yet," the man sighed heavily. "Give her some time to process this."

Victoria stormed away from the garden.

She pulled out her phone and replied to Rex's text.

[Fine! 80 billion it is. Sell the shares privately—no attention. Prepare my flight for 10 tonight!]

She wasn't rushing without reason.

That man's appearance had unsettled her deeply.

She feared what might happen if she stayed longer.

The situation had spiraled out of control.

Enough was enough.

Her priority now was securing the shares from William and Beatrice.

Coincidentally, they were just leaving Benjamin's hospital room.

"Victoria, you're back," Beatrice greeted warmly. "We're heading home. Come with us?"

"I've prepared gifts for you and Benjamin. His favorite crystal gaming keyboard is included."

"You can bring it to him later. Maybe talking to him will help him wake up sooner."

"Okay," Victoria agreed.

She glanced back at Eleanor and Richard inside the room.

A strange pang of guilt shot through her heart.

After fleeing Westchester, she might never return.

She remembered their kindness over the years.

Part of her felt bad about leaving them like this.

But then she recalled how they took her shares.

How they favored Isabella over her.

How they looked down on her during her lowest moments.

Her eyes turned cold again.

They forced her into this position.

If they had treated her better after that video exposure...

If they had cared more about her feelings...

She wouldn't have to take such drastic measures.

Isabella had been nothing but a menace.

Pushing her to the edge, threatening her very existence.

She had no choice but to run.

With these thoughts hardening her resolve, Victoria followed William and Beatrice to their car.

Meanwhile...

Isabella and Nathaniel sat together in his car.

Nathaniel could still hear her words echoing in his mind.

"So when I find an actual boyfriend, you call it an embarrassment..."

An actual boyfriend...

A slight smirk played on his lips.

Isabella noticed his expression. "You're happy they called you a wild man?"

"I don't mind being your wild man," Nathaniel replied, his voice deep and magnetic.

Isabella choked on her own breath.

Cough! Cough! What kind of logic was that?

He was a man of reputation and status!

Nathaniel leaned back elegantly against the seat. "What's your next move?"

"First, I'll find the best specialists for Benjamin. Get him the proper diagnosis and treatment."

"As for Victoria... Let things unfold naturally."

With William and Beatrice returning home, Isabella wanted to see how far Victoria's cruelty would go.

The family had spoiled her since childhood.

She couldn't possibly be completely heartless.

If she truly was... Then the Montgomery family would learn the hard way.

Sometimes, being hurt was the only way to see someone's true colors...

Isabella took out her phone and texted Maxwell.

[Maxwell: Latest update—Victoria booked a flight for 10 tonight. Should we stop her?]

Isabella's eyes narrowed.

That fast? She's rushing to leave tonight?

After a moment's hesitation, she replied.

[No need. Let her run.]
###Chapter 472

Only Victoria’s abrupt departure made the entire Montgomery family grasp the severity of the situation.

Isabella wanted to witness everyone’s reaction when they finally saw Victoria’s true nature.

At the Kensington estate.

When Victoria, William, and Beatrice returned, they found the mansion completely ransacked.

Sofas were slashed. Tables were overturned. Expensive decor lay shattered across the marble floors.

Beatrice’s hand flew to her chest. “What in heaven’s name happened here?”

“A break-in? The security code was bypassed. I’m checking the cameras.” William stormed toward the security room.

Victoria and Beatrice hurried after him.

The surveillance footage showed a figure in black keying in the passcode with ease.

The intruder systematically combed through the rooms, pocketing valuable jewelry and artifacts.

Then the person turned directly toward the hidden camera and grinned. “A message from Ms. Montgomery. She said you shouldn’t have crossed her. How dare you speak to her like that! She’s taking all your assets within seventy-two hours. Just wait.”

William’s face purpled with rage. Beatrice swayed on her feet, grabbing the desk for support.

Isabella! How could she do this? The sheer audacity!

Not only the invasion, but a direct threat to seize everything they owned in three days?

“That vile, ungrateful wretch!” Beatrice shrieked, her voice trembling with fury.

Victoria rushed to her side. “Grandfather! Grandmother! Please, stay calm. Your health is paramount. If something happens to you, Isabella will get everything. You know Benjamin and I are no match for her. We can’t possibly fight her…! Listening to that… she’s clearly plotting something drastic…”

“Preposterous! I’d rather donate my entire fortune to charity than let that witch inherit a single penny! I’m drafting my will this instant! She gets nothing!” William roared, scrambling for a pen and paper.

A glint flashed in Victoria’s eyes. She gently held his arm. “Grandfather, you’re in perfect health. A will is so… final. But Isabella is cunning. I don’t know what she did, but she manipulated Theodore into giving her twenty-five percent of the Montgomery shares. That’s over forty billion!”

“Even if you write a will now, she might find a way to contest it. To seize it all. I suggest a direct transfer. Move all your assets to Mother first. They’ll be safer with her.”

She sounded utterly sincere, every word dripping with concern.

William scowled. “Your mother is a foolish woman. None of this would have happened if she hadn’t brought that viper into our home!”

“Then… to Benjamin? Transfer everything to Benjamin,” Victoria proposed softly.

Beatrice sighed deeply. “The share transfer requires his signature. We have no idea when he’ll wake up. I have this dreadful feeling… like a storm is coming. This must be settled immediately.”

Her gaze then landed on Victoria, and her eyes lit up. “Victoria! Of course! We’ll transfer everything to you! You are our most trusted granddaughter. We entrust it all to you!”

“No, Grandmother, please… I can’t accept. My reputation is in ruins. No one will have me now. I don’t deserve your generosity…” Victoria hung her head, a picture of shame and guilt.

Beatrice gently took her hand. “You were framed by that wretched girl. Isabella schemed to take what was yours. It’s only right you have this. The incident with Harrison… you were the victim! We don’t blame you. The shares are yours!”

“She’s right. I’m calling my attorney. He’ll be here shortly. Victoria, come with me. I’m giving you the key to my vault.” William already had his phone to his ear, ushering Victoria toward his private vault.

As she followed behind him, a triumphant smirk curled on Victoria’s lips.
###Chapter 473

The sun dipped low as Victoria received the final documents. William and Beatrice Kensington had signed over everything. Every asset, every valuable. All now legally hers.

She clutched the folder tightly. A perfect excuse formed on her lips. She needed to leave the Montgomery Manor immediately. To liquidate it all before anyone could interfere.

Beatrice watched her adopted daughter retreat. A deep frown etched onto her face. She turned to her husband. "William... we've given her everything. Isabella shouldn't be a threat now. So why does my heart feel so heavy?"

William sighed, his own worry evident. "I fear Isabella might still try to take it from Victoria by force."

Beatrice's eyes widened in alarm. "Of course! Victoria now holds sixty percent of the family shares. Plus our personal assets worth billions. Isabella would target her without a doubt! This cannot happen!" She scrambled for her phone. "I'm calling Eleanor. They must protect Victoria at all costs!"

Over at Grace Memorial Hospital...

Eleanor was deep in conversation with a specialist about Benjamin's condition. Her phone's ringtone cut through the sterile air. She excused herself, stepping into the hallway.

"Eleanor, listen carefully!" Beatrice's voice was raspy with urgency. "We confronted Isabella today. She sent thugs to ransack our estate! She threatened to seize all our assets! You must guard the Kensingtons. Protect Victoria. I'm terrified Isabella will harm her next."

"What? Are you certain?" Eleanor's brow furrowed in disbelief. "There must be some mistake. She wouldn't—"

"Would I lie?" Beatrice snapped. "We saw it ourselves! And look at Benjamin! We verified the security footage from Takashi Yamamoto. Benjamin was perfectly fine when he left his home. Who else could have poisoned him but Isabella? Bringing that viper into our family was our gravest error. Will you stand by while she plunders everything? If she could harm Benjamin, Victoria is next!"

Eleanor's grip tightened on the phone. A cold fury began to simmer within her. "Alright," she said, her voice clipped. "I understand. I'll handle it."

She ended the call, her breath coming out in an angry huff. How had Isabella become so monstrous? Poisoning Benjamin wasn't enough? Now she threatened her own grandparents? The sheer audacity was breathtaking.

Just then, Richard approached the hospital room. "Eleanor? I need to meet with Father to finalize the specialist for Benjamin."

"Wait," she commanded, her tone leaving no room for argument. "Come with me to the manor first. We need to force a withdrawal of Isabella's twenty-five percent shares. Before Father finds out."

As the family patriarch, Theodore Montgomery held the corporate seal. Combined with the other shareholders' approval, they could legally revoke her stake.

Richard hesitated. "That's... drastic. You know how Father will react."

"A scolding from Father is preferable to Isabella's schemes!" Eleanor's voice rose. "Do you know what she did? She threatened my parents! She said she would steal everything they own! I am furious, but Father refuses to see the truth! We return her shares to Theodore and cut her from the family. We can explain it to him afterward."

Richard glanced back at Benjamin, lying motionless in the hospital bed. The image solidified his resolve. He gave a grim nod. "Okay."

They returned to Montgomery Manor swiftly. A clandestine family meeting was convened, Theodore deliberately kept in the dark. The vote was unanimous. Isabella Montgomery was to be disowned.

An attorney was summoned. The paperwork for the forced share withdrawal was drafted and signed with swift, brutal efficiency.

Richard then accessed the official Montgomery Group Twitter account. His fingers flew across the keyboard, publishing a statement that would ignite a firestorm.

[Official Statement: Due to Isabella Montgomery's reprehensible actions and conduct endangering lives, the Montgomery family has unanimously voted to disown her and reclaim all family shares. Effective immediately, Isabella Montgomery is no longer the adopted daughter of the Montgomery family. We sever all ties.]

The post exploded across the internet within seconds.

Reprehensible actions? Endangering lives? What did she do?

Insider leak: the Montgomery's only son is in a vegetative state. Unlikely to ever wake up.

What? Isabella did that? I never thought she was capable.

Is this another one of Victoria's setups?

This came from her own parents. They disowned her. This has to be serious.
###Chapter 474

The argument escalated rapidly.

Eleanor accessed her private account and posted a bold statement.

"Our investigations are conclusive and error-free. To seize the Montgomery family assets, Isabella orchestrated schemes against Victoria and Benjamin. This is utterly reprehensible! She knows exactly what she has done!"

Her tweet instantly swayed public opinion.

Even Isabella's staunchest defenders began to doubt her.

"Eleanor wouldn't be this furious without solid evidence."

"But Isabella is incredibly wealthy. Why would she covet others' money?"

"The richest always crave more. The Montgomery fortune is nearly twenty billion."

"Consider this: an outsider adopted into the family, plotting against the true heirs to steal their inheritance..."

"An outsider betraying the family? That sounds entirely plausible."

At Rosewood Manor.

Isabella and Nathaniel had just stepped inside when Oliver came rushing toward them.

"Mommy! Mommy! Check Twitter right now! Someone is setting you up!"

His chubby hands held out the phone urgently.

Isabella took it and scanned the tweets from Montgomery Group and Eleanor.

The online discussions were vicious.

She frowned deeply.

She knew Eleanor and the others disliked her, but Theodore had intervened.

Yet they still expelled her from the family and forced the withdrawal of her shares.

Clearly, they were using social media to destroy her reputation.

Did they truly despise her this much?

Nathaniel's hand settled gently on her shoulder.

His voice was low and reassuring. "I'll have Dominic handle this immediately."

"Unnecessary." Isabella's expression turned icy again.

She was accustomed to their cruelty. There was no point in sadness.

Undoubtedly, Victoria had orchestrated this mess before her departure.

Victoria was leaving tonight anyway.

Isabella wanted to see how the Montgomerys would react.

Yes, they had disowned her.

But they would come crawling back to her within a day!

Oliver looked puzzled. "But why not, Mommy? Uncle Dominic can fix anything! He's amazing!"

Isabella kept the phone and comforted him. "It's alright, Oliver. We don't need to stoop to their level. Remember, if a dog bites you, you don't bite it back."

"Hmm... But we can kick them! Kick them all!" Oliver retorted angrily, his voice still filled with childish innocence.

Isabella nearly choked. Why were children so difficult to teach these days...

Nathaniel intervened. "Oliver, let Mommy rest now. I will handle everything else."

"Oh, right! Mommy, you need sleep–remember the little baby. I'll walk you."

Oliver carefully supported her back toward the bedroom.

Isabella was speechless. Perhaps he would never let go of this imaginary baby.

She was exhausted from last night's lack of sleep and the day's events.

Just as they walked down the hallway...

CRASH. CRASH. SMASH.

The glass windows shattered violently.

Shards flew everywhere, assaulting the trio.
###Chapter 475

Attack!

Nathaniel immediately shielded Isabella and Oliver.

Glass shards rained down upon his back.

"Take Christopher upstairs," commanded Nathaniel, his voice low and authoritative.

Isabella hesitated briefly.

Oliver's safety was paramount.

"Be careful!" She locked eyes with him, her gaze intense.

"Don't worry." A dark, seductive smirk played on his lips. "You won't become a widow."

Isabella was momentarily stunned.

How could he flirt at a time like this?

She gripped Oliver's small hand and hurried up the staircase.

Nathaniel moved to a secure vantage point to assess the threat.

Recognition dawned.

The assailants outside were...

Isabella reached the second-floor balcony with Oliver.

She looked down.

Her brows furrowed instantly.

Eleanor and Richard stood below.

They had brought nearly a dozen bodyguards.

The guards were violently assaulting her manor.

Pure hatred contorted Eleanor's face.

Thirty minutes prior.

Richard had consulted the specialist.

The doctor delivered devastating news.

Benjamin's condition was irreversible.

Fury consumed them.

Remembering how Isabella had desecrated the Kensington estate, their hatred burned white-hot.

They wanted her dead.

They mobilized their guards and stormed her property.

Eleanor suddenly looked up, sensing Isabella's gaze.

She scowled viciously.

"I never imagined you could be so cruel, Isabella! Harming an innocent like Benjamin! Threatening the elders!"

"Produce the antidote now! Or you will never know peace!"

"I will avenge Benjamin and my parents!"

Her voice dripped with venomous hatred.

A bitter taste filled Isabella's mouth.

They had stolen her shares.

They had destroyed her reputation.

Now they attacked her home.

Their malice knew no bounds.

She let out a cold, derisive laugh.

"Killing me won't produce an antidote. You're wasting time here."

"You should be watching Victoria. Monitoring the transfer of family shares."

Richard's frown deepened.

"Isabella! How can you still slander Victoria at a time like this? Have you no humanity?"

"Victoria has always been kind to you! She still speaks well of you!"

"Enough talk!" Eleanor snapped, turning to the guards. "She refuses to cooperate! Keep attacking! Destroy this house! Seize her!"

"I accept full responsibility!"

A few million meant nothing.

She would teach Isabella a lesson.

But the attacking guards suddenly froze.

They recoiled in unison, stumbling backward.

Their leader stared in abject terror.

He stammered, voice trembling.

"Sir... Madam... This manor... We cannot attack it..."

"Why not?" Eleanor scoffed. "The Montgomery family is not so poor we can't cover the damages!"

"But... This manor belongs to..." The leader tried to explain.

An immense, crushing pressure silenced him.

It felt like a vise around his throat.

He could feel a pair of sharp, domineering eyes watching from within the building.

A violent shiver ran down his spine.

"Truly, this manor cannot be harmed. Sir, Madam, we must leave. Immediately."

He grabbed Eleanor and Richard's arms, attempting to pull them away.

Eleanor was furious.

"What is inside? Tell me the truth! What trick is she playing?"

"Who pays your salaries? Why are you disobeying our orders? Release us!" Richard demanded.

The guards were too terrified to stop.

They hurriedly increased their pace, forcibly escorting Eleanor and Richard from the property.

If Nathaniel heard their insolence, the entire Montgomery family could vanish overnight.

Eleanor wanted to teach Isabella a lesson.

She never expected her own guards to betray her.

She shot a final, deathly glare toward the balcony.

"Just you wait, Isabella! This isn't over!"
###Chapter 476

"You're no longer a Montgomery. Don't you dare set foot in this manor again." Eleanor's voice dripped with venom. "I brought you into this family, which means I own your life. If Benjamin doesn't survive, I'll take everything from you!"

Isabella had built walls against such cruelty, but hearing those words from her own flesh and blood still pierced through her defenses.

Suddenly, a small warm hand slipped into hers. "Don't be sad, Mommy." Oliver's voice was soft yet firm. "Daddy and I will always protect you. We're your real family now."

Her heart clenched at his words. She looked down at the boy standing beside her, his crystal-clear eyes filled with unwavering loyalty.

It was ironic. Those who shared her blood sought to destroy her, while those bound by choice stood as her fortress.

A gentle smile touched her lips. "Mommy's alright, sweetheart. Thank you." She squeezed his hand. "Let's get you to bed."

Nathaniel was ascending the staircase when he saw them. He had expected devastation after that confrontation, but Isabella stood composed, her strength evident in her steady posture.

How much pain had she endured to become this resilient? The thought made his chest tighten with protectiveness.

Isabella's gaze swept over him, noticing the shard of glass embedded in his forearm, blood staining his sleeve.

Her brow furrowed. She immediately retrieved the first-aid kit. "Sit down," she instructed, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Nathaniel took the kit from her. "I can manage. You should rest."

"Be quiet," she countered sharply.

Though no medic, Isabella possessed competent emergency skills. With precise movements, she extracted the glass using tweezers, applying pressure with sterile gauze to stem the bleeding.

Oliver, observing from the sidelines, understood his cue. He retreated downstairs to give them privacy.

The lower level was chaos. Shattered windows littered the floor with glittering debris. The exterior walls bore ugly scars from the impact.

His small face hardened. How dare they attack his mother! Blood relation meant nothing when they acted like monsters.

Pulling out his phone, he dialed Dominic. "Uncle Dominic, I need two snakes. Put them in those horrible people's car before they leave."

The reptiles would deliver a fitting scare without traceable evidence. Mommy would never suspect a thing.

Dominic approved the plan immediately, moving to execute it. Shortly after, Maxwell arrived with a repair crew. He had been monitoring the property from the shadows but held back upon recognizing Eleanor and Richard. He understood Isabella's deliberate pacing around the situation.

Even with Victoria's reputation in tatters, the Montgomerys still favored her. They discarded their true daughter for a malicious imposter. Fools.

Maxwell eagerly anticipated their eventual reckoning when the truth finally emerged.

Upstairs, Isabella finished dressing Nathaniel's wound, discarding bloodied gauze into the bin. The sight was gruesome.

"You shouldn't have intervened," she murmured, avoiding his gaze.

"I'm your real boyfriend. Protecting you is my responsibility." He emphasized the title, his voice low.

Isabella felt heat rise to her cheeks. She had said that in the heat of the moment to defy her parents. Why was he latching onto it?

Now wasn't the time for this discussion. "I'm exhausted. I need to rest before dealing with tonight's matters." She stood to leave.

Nathaniel's eyebrow quirked. She didn't correct him... Did that mean she accepted it? His hand shot out, capturing her wrist before she could retreat.
###Chapter 477

Isabella was yanked back by Nathaniel’s firm grip, halting her exit.
She turned to face him, her expression cool.
“What is it?”

Nathaniel’s gaze locked onto hers.
“Say the word, Isabella, and I’ll handle everything for you.”
Whether it was Victoria or the entire Montgomery clan.
Why should she endure their daily accusations?

A faint smile touched her crimson lips as she freed her arm.
“No need. I can manage my own affairs.”
“It will all be over soon.”

The more they despised her, the more thrilling tonight would become.
Her dark eyes shimmered with anticipation and dark amusement.

Isabella slept soundly through the night while the Montgomerys descended into chaos.
Theodore Montgomery exhausted his top connections searching for specialists.
Every expert reported the same grim news: reviving Benjamin was impossible.
The family was crushed.

Joey and Richard were tormented by nightmares of giant snakes coiling around them in their car.
They worked tirelessly into the late evening, yet received no hopeful updates.
Lily, Felix, Sophia, along with distant relatives and close friends, crowded the hospital room.
Theodore believed more visitors might stimulate Benjamin’s awakening.
He remained unaware that Isabella had been disowned and her shares seized.

Sophia, recently released from detention, sneered at Benjamin’s unconscious form.
“This is Isabella’s evil work! She framed me, then Victoria, and now she’s harmed Benjamin!”
“She’s plotting to seize the entire Montgomery fortune! How vile!”

“Eleanor never should have brought that witch into our home.”
“She’s ruined everything and got our Sophia imprisoned!” Lily complained bitterly.

The room erupted into accusations against Isabella.
A soft voice spoke up timidly, “We can’t blame Isabella for what happened to Sophia.”
“Sophia harmed her first…”

“Silence!” Sophia glared furiously at the young woman.
“How dare you defend Isabella now? Do you want to end up in a hospital bed too?”

The speaker was Lillian Montgomery, Theodore’s brother’s granddaughter.
A twenty-year-old music student, she lowered her head and fell silent under Sophia’s wrath.

From the crowd, Adrian scoffed.
“No one knows if Isabella actually harmed Benjamin.”
“Don’t be too surprised when the truth emerges.”

“Who else could it be? She benefits the most if something happens to Benjamin!”
“She wants the Montgomery assets! You work for her—get out of this room!”
“Don’t upset Benjamin!” Sophia shouted.

The ward descended into noisy arguments.
Theodore stared at Benjamin’s still form, his heart aching with panic and grief.

“Oh, Benjamin, what happened? Wake up and tell us the truth.”
“Everyone is condemning Isabella. If she’s innocent, do you want her blamed?”

Seeing Theodore’s silence, the family grew louder.
Some took out their phones to tweet:
[You’re too young to leave us! Wake up! We’ve avenged you—wake up and confront her!]

Nearly every Montgomery retweeted the post, further destroying Isabella’s reputation.
#MontgomerysHarmed trended as the hottest topic online.
The entire family despised their ungrateful adopted daughter.

Amid the chaos, Lillian asked again, “By the way, where’s Victoria? Why hasn’t she come today?”
###Chapter 478

Eleanor’s voice dripped with admiration. “Victoria is working tirelessly. She’s determined to find the finest doctor in the world for Benjamin.”

After all, Victoria was her true daughter. Her real flesh and blood.

Everyone in the hospital room sighed in agreement.

“They were both raised in the Montgomery family, yet Victoria is flawless while Isabella is lower than dirt.”

“Even when Victoria made mistakes, she never dragged the entire family down like Isabella did.”

“We must devote more attention to Victoria from now on. She’s our only hope.”

“Exactly. Richard nearly died in that fire, and Victoria saved him. Isabella only ever brings destruction.”

The family attorney burst into the room, his face pale.

“Mr. Montgomery, it’s terrible! Something awful has happened!”

Richard glared at him, annoyed. “What could possibly be worse than our current situation?”

The attorney struggled to speak, gasping for air. “It’s Ms. Victoria… She…”

Eleanor leaped up and grabbed his arm. “What about Victoria? Did Isabella harm her?”

“I’ll find Isabella right now! This time, I’ll end her!” Richard stormed toward the door.

The attorney quickly seized his arm. “No! It’s not about Ms. Isabella. Ms. Victoria has disappeared with all the money!”

The room fell into stunned silence.

Victoria ran off with the money?

The news was too shocking to process.

Eleanor tightened her grip on the attorney’s sleeve. “What are you saying? Explain yourself! How could Victoria do such a thing?”

“Madam, I didn’t want to believe it either. When I reviewed the company’s finances, I discovered a massive transfer of shares. Victoria sold her sixty percent stake to an unknown buyer. And the fifty billion for the Garden Project—plus the fifty billion bank loan—is gone. She took everything.”

Eleanor stumbled backward, nearly collapsing.

Theodore jolted upright in his bed.

Everyone felt as if they’d been struck by lightning.

Victoria sold her shares. She emptied the company accounts. She vanished with the bank’s money.

Just moments ago, they were singing her praises. Now she had robbed them blind.

“No… It can’t be… Victoria would never do this…” Eleanor muttered in disbelief.

The family butler, Reginald, rushed into the room. “Sir, Madam, it’s a disaster! Ms. Victoria took all the valuable items from the estate and sold them. Her phone is disconnected.”

Was she trying to ruin the entire family?

Pam, sitting in the corner, suddenly remembered something. Her hands trembled as she pulled out her phone and called her lawyer. “Check if all our properties are still under Victoria Kensington’s name…”

“Madam, I was about to call you. All your properties have been sold. New owners are moving into your mansion tonight. Mr. Kensington’s antique collection has been taken…”

Pam’s hand shook violently.

Her phone crashed to the floor and shattered.

Zachary’s eyes rolled back, and he fainted from the shock.

“Darling! Darling! Somebody call a doctor!”
###Chapter 479

Medical staff hurried into the room. They immediately transported Zachary to the adjacent ward for emergency resuscitation.

He regained consciousness briefly. The devastating realization of his entire collection vanishing made him faint again. Chaos erupted among the Jordans. Everyone was completely blindsided by this shocking turn of events. Tiffany had fled. She disappeared with all their liquid assets. Every valuable item inside the mansion was gone. What remained for them now?

Amelia suddenly remembered her own stake. She rushed toward the family attorney and grabbed his arm desperately. "My five percent! What happens to my shares now?"

"You and your mother still legally hold the shares. However... the company is currently fifty billion in debt. All remaining assets will be liquidated to repay creditors. Shareholders are now personally liable for the remaining debt..." the attorney explained calmly. Amelia's eyes widened in sheer horror. Fifty billion? She was responsible for repaying that? "No! That's impossible! Why would Tiffany do this? How did this happen? Find her! We need to find her right now!"

Adam finally snapped out of his dazed state. His first coherent words were a roared command. "Bring her back! We must find her!"

They had given Tiffany everything. They treated her with immense kindness and privilege. Yet she betrayed them utterly. She stole everything and vanished. The Jordans were bankrupt. They had to locate her. They needed answers, no matter the cost.

"The issue is timing," the attorney interjected. "It's month-end. The security staff haven't received their wages. They are growing restless. News about Tiffany's actions has already leaked. Company employees have looted the offices and fled with anything of value..." The Jordans couldn't even afford to fund a search party. Being penniless and buried under crippling debt was horrific enough. Losing their company and primary residence was catastrophic.

Senior Jordan had remained silent through the entire ordeal. He suddenly coughed violently, spitting a mouthful of blood onto the floor.

"Father!" Adam, Lily, and Felix rushed to support his faltering body. "Senior Jordan, we are navigating a severe crisis. Your health is paramount!" the attorney urged with genuine concern. The family was in total disarray. Bank representatives would arrive tomorrow. If Senior Jordan fell ill now, the Jordan family would be completely finished.

Senior Jordan clutched his chest, breathing laboriously. With a trembling hand, he slowly removed the ancient jade ring from his thumb. He pressed it into Adam's palm. "Take this... Pawn it. Use the money to... to pay the staff. Report this theft to the police... Regarding the debts... plead for an extended grace period... as long as they will allow..."

He took another shaky breath. "Also... discover the truth. Why did she run? We must understand..." She was the designated heiress. Her actions made no sense. There had to be a hidden reason, a secret she kept from them all.

"Understood, Father. Please, remain calm. Preserve your strength. I will handle everything," Adam vowed, closing his fingers around the precious heirloom.

The jade ring was a centuries-old family artifact. Passed down through countless generations. Now they were forced to sell it for survival. The situation could not possibly be worse.

Joey returned from the other ward and witnessed the scene. Tears streamed down her face silently. Her legs gave way, and she collapsed to the cold floor. "How... how could this happen?" she sobbed, her voice breaking. "Why would Tiffany do this to us? We raised her with love! We gave her everything! Why...?" Her desperate cries echoed in the room.

No one moved to comfort her. Lily shot her a look of pure contempt. "What good are tears now? Your parenting is the real disaster. The daughter you brought home destroyed our family. Your real daughter robbed us blind and vanished."
###Chapter 480

The Montgomery family now faces complete financial ruin.

You two are the primary culprits behind this disaster!

You must take full responsibility for all outstanding debts!

Absolutely! You bear the greatest liability in this situation!

You need to locate Victoria immediately, or the entire Montgomery legacy will collapse!

Even if you find her, the damage to our stock value is already catastrophic!

This will drain our resources beyond recovery!

You will compensate for every single loss we suffer!

The crowd hurled furious accusations at Eleanor.

Eleanor's heart already shattered from the current crisis, now faced relentless scorn from those who once curried her favor.

They were the same individuals who previously flattered her and sought her friendship.

Yet now...

It was Victoria! That deceitful Victoria!

She seized Senior Montgomery's thirty percent company shares and liquidated everything, creating this chaos!

How could she be so utterly heartless? What possible motive drove her to such betrayal?

Adrian slipped away from the hospital room amidst the turmoil.

Outside the hospital, he pulled out his phone to contact Isabella. "Isabella, should I reveal the truth to them now?"

"Not yet. Let them discover it gradually—they'll learn everything in due time. For now, stay by Grandpa's side personally these next few days. Ensure he receives proper care. Also, cover Benjamin's medical expenses on my behalf."

Isabella was resting in her room during the call. She attempted to sleep after ending the conversation.

But her mind swirled with too many thoughts, keeping her awake. She had anticipated this moment for five long years.

Since everything had descended into chaos, so be it. She wanted the entire Montgomery family to witness their beloved Victoria's true nature!

Had they not mocked her for being the adopted daughter and demanded she never set foot on Montgomery property again?

She longed to see their expressions when the truth emerged—Isabella wanted to hear what excuses they could possibly offer!

The following day unfolded exactly as predicted. The Montgomery family descended into total disarray.

All of William and Beatrice's assets had been sold, leaving them completely homeless. The hospital became their only shelter, though the remaining funds in their bank accounts were severely limited.

After covering the exorbitant medical costs, they struggled to afford even basic meals.

When the bank discovered the fifty-billion-dollar loan had vanished, they immediately shuttered every Montgomery Group factory, along with all their hotels and properties.

They issued a five-day ultimatum for debt repayment before initiating asset liquidation.

The Montgomerys' relatives and friends, terrified of being entangled in the disaster, fled instantly. None wished to be associated with the catastrophe.

Even all the household staff abandoned the manor. Senior Montgomery, Richard, Gregory, Penelope, and the rest remained confined to the hospital, surviving on inexpensive hospital food.

Overnight, the Montgomery family's glory evaporated, replaced by desperate circumstances.

Every financial news outlet and social media platform exploded with headlines:

[The Nation's Top Real Estate Empire Declares Bankruptcy!]

[Montgomery Group Shuts Down Operations!]

[Montgomery Family Swamped with 50 Billion Debt!]

[Victoria Kensington Absconds with Family Fortune—Manhunt Underway!]

Comment sections flooded with shock and disbelief.

[Unbelievable! Victoria actually stole their money and ran!]

[That innocent-faced Victoria committed such an act?]

[Isn't she the Montgomery heiress? Even without stealing, she controlled sixty percent of shares. Why would she do this?]

[She fled with the money, making herself universally despised. Is she insane?]

[This year's most sensational drama! Can't wait for the full truth to emerge!]

The public watched the spectacle with morbid fascination. Some investigators dug into the Montgomery family history, uncovering their profound foolishness—they were arguably the most gullible family imaginable.

Victoria had been their favored child since infancy. They invested enormous sums in her upbringing, enrolling her in piano lessons, language courses, and countless other trainings.

Their expenditure on her far exceeded what they spent on their other children. What could have driven her to such betrayal?

BANG!

A sudden, explosive noise reverberated through the hospital ward.
###Chapter 481

Isabella glanced up to see Sophia hurling the food container across the room. The plastic lid popped off, scattering rice and vegetables over the linoleum.

Sophia clawed at her own hair, pulling strands loose from her ponytail. Her eyes were wild with frustration.

"I can't do this anymore! This room smells like disinfectant and misery. I refuse to sleep propped up in that plastic chair again. And this slop they call food? Unacceptable! I need proper lobster. I need to feel human again!"

Eleanor moved to comfort her, hands fluttering nervously. "Darling, you must be patient. The authorities are tracking Victoria across six continents. They'll find her. We just need to hold on a little longer."

"Hold on? With what? Hope?" Sophia's laugh was brittle. "What if she's already blown through everything? What if there's nothing left when they finally catch her? I'm done with this pathetic existence! Fix this, Mother! You have to fix this now!"

A heavy silence filled the room. Gregory shot a venomous look toward Richard and Eleanor. "Look what your family's incompetence has brought upon us. Clean up this mess. That other daughter of yours—the Montgomery heiress. She's rolling in money. Find her. Make her pay for decent accommodations. At least get us out of this hospital hellhole."

Eleanor's head snapped up, a sudden idea flashing in her eyes. She turned to Richard, her meal forgotten. "She's right. Isabella! That ungrateful wretch we took in. This has her fingerprints all over it. Victoria would never do this. She loved us! Isabella must have threatened her. Forced the transfers. Maybe even... eliminated her afterward?"

Richard went rigid, the color draining from his face. The unspoken horror of it settled over everyone.

Penelope shot to her feet, the plastic chair screeching. "Of course! It makes perfect sense! Victoria was the heir. Why would she throw that away? Risk prison? Unless she had no choice! That Montgomery viper! She could have arranged the whole thing! She could have had her killed!"

The air grew thick with dread. Just as Theodore drew a breath to reprimand them, the attorney burst through the door, disheveled and breathless.

"I found something! In the waste bin... pieces... I pieced them together..."

Eleanor snatched the reconstructed page from his trembling hands. The family crowded around, their breaths held.

The handwriting was frantic, desperate.

Why... why wasn't I born a Montgomery? Why is my entire life a lie balanced on a knife's edge?
This constant fear of losing it all is torture! I'm losing my mind!
What gives you the right, Isabella? Just blood? You want to steal the twenty-three years of love I earned?
Why didn't you just die in that damned village?!

Victoria's breakdown was etched in every jagged word. She'd torn the evidence of her turmoil to shreds, a futile attempt to hide her crumbling sanity. The attorney's meticulousness had unearthed her secret.

The paper trembled violently in Eleanor's grip. Her world tilted on its axis.

Victoria... wasn't hers.

Isabella... was?

Impossible.

She had cradled Victoria, had fed her, had soothed her nightmares. Isabella was the charity case, the child from the trash.

This couldn't be real.

Richard stood frozen beside her, his mouth agape, unable to form a single word. The truth was a physical blow.
###Chapter 482

“This can’t be true! Victoria would never write this! There must be some error… Look into it immediately!”

“But… I’ve already verified the handwriting. It’s unmistakably Victoria’s. The document even carries her fingerprints,” the attorney explained helplessly.

What more evidence could they possibly need?

Adrian entered at that precise moment. “There’s no need for further investigation. Isabella is your biological daughter. Years ago, Victoria’s birth mother and Eleanor gave birth in the same hospital. Her mother was dying after delivering Victoria. To secure a better future for her child, that woman secretly switched the babies. She took the true heiress, Isabella, and abandoned her in a trash bin. That’s how Victoria became the Montgomery heiress. This is why your heart ached when you found the baby in the bin. This is why you always treated that foundling better than Victoria.”

Eleanor felt as if struck by lightning. Her pupils dilated in shock.

It was true—her heart had wrenched at the sight of little Isabella in that bin. She had always favored the child she rescued over Victoria. But was that really enough to believe Isabella was her actual daughter?

It sounded absurd.

Everyone in the hospital room was stunned into silence.

Isabella—Eleanor’s real daughter? Victoria was just a swapped imposter? It was too dramatic to believe. It felt like a plot from a soap opera.

Adrian handed over a DNA report. “The day after you exiled Isabella five years ago, she asked me to collect strands of your hair for a DNA test outside Westchester. She tried calling everyone to come home, but all her calls were blocked.

“This new DNA test was conducted yesterday using Isabella and Benjamin’s blood. She always intended to show you, but never got the chance.”

Eleanor, Richard, Theodore, and the others crowded around to read the report. The results were clear: Isabella was undeniably the true Montgomery heiress. She and Benjamin shared the same mother.

The first test might have been done at a hospital outside Westchester, but Grace Memorial was owned by the Blackwood corporation. No matter how powerful Isabella was, she could never have bribed Blackwood staff…

“So… Isabella is actually my cousin?” Sophia murmured, still dazed.

“It does make sense, though,” Gregory added. “Victoria ran off with the money because she knew she wasn’t a real Montgomery. She wanted to destroy the entire family.”

Adrian laughed mockingly. “Oh, it’s much worse than that. Victoria discovered the truth when she was eight. First, she manipulated Benjamin and Isabella, rendering them useless. She planned to seize every share of the family fortune. Five years ago, during Isabella’s engagement party, she overheard Victoria conspiring with Alexander. That’s why they pushed her down the stairs! Victoria has been a demon lurking in the shadows since she was eight, plotting against all of you. And you treated her like royalty! How utterly hilarious.”

His scornful words echoed through the room.

Eleanor’s body jolted violently. Overwhelmed, her blood pressure spiked. She collapsed to the floor, unconscious.

Richard quickly lifted her onto an empty bed. The room descended into chaos again.

Theodore trembled, urgently gesturing to Adrian. “Hurry, find Isabella… Bring her back…!”

“It’s too late, Father,” Richard muttered, his voice thick with regret. Each word felt like a punch to his gut.
###Chapter 483

Richard Montgomery’s expression darkened at his son’s words. “Why?”

“I… We believed Isabella was responsible for the destruction at the Kensington Estate yesterday. So we invoked your authority to revoke her shares and formally disowned her. We even gathered men to storm the Rosewood Manor and insulted her publicly. She… She may refuse to assist us now…” Richard hung his head, the shame of facing Isabella overwhelming him.

The elder Montgomery’s face flushed with rage. “You fools! How could you be so reckless? Did I not explicitly say we wait for Benjamin to regain consciousness? How dare you defy me—cough, cough!”

His coughing intensified with each furious word.

Adrian Sinclair rushed to his side. “Please, sir, remain calm. Let them rectify their errors—don’t sacrifice your health over their foolishness.”

“My health is irrelevant… Isabella is what matters. My true granddaughter all along! Richard, you will go to her and apologize immediately! I don’t care how you do it, but you will bring her back into this family. If you fail, I will disown you as my son!” Senior Montgomery’s voice trembled with fury.

Richard nodded grimly. “I understand, Father. Once Eleanor is conscious, we will go together. Please, try to calm yourself.”

He needed to steady his own emotions. The daughter he cherished for twenty-three years was not his biological child, while the one he rejected and mistreated was his actual flesh and blood.

The daughter he adored had been secretly scheming against the family all along.

The revelation felt like the ground had shattered beneath him.

Eleanor Kensington drifted in a troubled sleep, trapped in a lengthy nightmare. She dreamt of rescuing Isabella from a dumpster and raising her with affection until she turned eight, when the girl became defiant and unruly. Isabella repeatedly humiliated the Montgomery name. Eleanor’s scornful words echoed in the dream: “Get out of this family! I regret ever taking in a stray like you!” “Why are you so ungrateful? You’re just an adopted child! Nothing more!”

Young Isabella stared back with tear-filled eyes. “If you hate me so much, then cast me out!”

She turned and fled, sprinting toward a jagged cliff edge—a gaping chasm with no bottom.

Eleanor tried to chase her, but Isabella leaped into the void, her small form disappearing into the abyss.

“No!”

Eleanor jolted awake, her face wet with tears. Richard gripped her shoulders. “What’s wrong, Eleanor?”

“I… I dreamed of Isabella. She was running away…” Her voice shook with terror.

Her mind foggy, she clutched Richard’s arm. “Tell me it was just a dream. The lawyer hasn’t come, right? Victoria is still our real daughter, isn’t she?”

Richard frowned and sighed heavily after a long pause. He said nothing.

The hospital room grew thick with tension.

Eleanor’s grip on his arm slackened, her hand falling away.

His silence confirmed the truth. It was no nightmare. Victoria was not her biological daughter. Her real daughter was Isabella…
###Chapter 484

Isabella was the same daughter Eleanor had scolded and beaten as a child. She had despised this 'adopted daughter' so much she even removed her from the family registry. She had even brought men to attack her private manor! A tidal wave of guilt and regret crashed over her. She clutched Richard's arm desperately. "Oh, Richard, what do we do now? How can we possibly face Isabella? Will she ever forgive us? I'm too ashamed to even look at her!"

"I'm utterly ashamed as well," Richard sighed heavily.

At least Eleanor had been kind to Isabella when she first brought her home. Everyone else had fought against the decision, assuming Eleanor and Richard were just scheming for a larger share of the family fortune. It had caused a massive scandal back then. Because of that, Richard had never liked Isabella from the start. He had never shown her a single ounce of kindness.

Just then, Penelope approached Richard. "Brother, Father said no matter how ashamed you both feel, you must go and find Isabella."

"Look at the mess we're in," Gregory added, stepping out from behind Penelope. "We're fifty billion in debt. Bankruptcy is imminent, and there's no way we can find that kind of money. Only Isabella can save us now."

Eleanor was furious hearing this. "What right do you have to say that? When I first brought Isabella home, all of you thought I was just angling for a bigger share of the family assets! You all wanted her gone! For twenty-three years, have any of you ever stopped treating her with hostility? Have you ever stopped condemning her and hurling insults? Now that we're in trouble, you want her to use her own money to bail us out? Have you no shame?"

"Isn't Isabella the true heiress of this family? Saving the family is her duty!" Sophia declared, walking over.

It was true, Sophia did not like Isabella. But Isabella was the only one who could save them now. That was the only reason Sophia was joining in to persuade them to bring Isabella back. At least to save the family first.

Richard scoffed, "That's not what any of you said when she secured her share of the family trust. You're all well aware of how we treated her all these years! We looked down on her during our prosperous days, and now that we're drowning, we expect her to rescue us? I'm too ashamed to even ask! If you feel no shame, then you go find her yourselves!" His voice was firm and laced with fury. Since Theodore was on their side, Sophia and her parents shrank back under Richard's words.

Richard and Eleanor didn't care what the others thought. The moment they discovered Isabella was their biological daughter, their only desire was to see her, to apologize, to beg for her forgiveness. To ask her to come home and save the family's crumbling empire? They were far too ashamed for that.

Sophia pouted, slumping into a chair angrily. "Fine then! Let's all just live in this hospital forever! Let's survive on hospital meal boxes for the rest of our lives! This is our fate now!"

"The Montgomery family is so unlucky," Gregory muttered under his breath. "What's so difficult about keeping track of your own children? One daughter gets swapped and the real one isn't even willing to take responsibility…"

Richard exploded with rage. He slammed his palms on the table and shot to his feet. "Say that again! Who isn't willing to take responsibility?!"

"What I'm saying… what I mean is…" Gregory hastily hid behind Penelope, peeking out from behind her, "Whether she was the real daughter or the adopted one, they were both your daughters! Especially that Victoria. You raised her! Of course you have to take full responsibility for this mess!"

"That's not what you said when you were accepting gifts from Victoria worth tens of thousands of dollars!" Eleanor retorted angrily.

The scene was devolving into another family brawl.

Suddenly…

"Enough!"

A hoarse, aged voice cut through the chaos. Theodore anchored his walker heavily onto the floor. "A bunch of useless trash. Stop this squabbling immediately! Richard, you will go and apologize to Isabella. Right now. No matter what, you must secure her forgiveness. As for saving the Montgomery family, only ask if she is willing. If she is willing, the entire Montgomery family and all its assets will belong to her. If she is not, do not force it… I only wish for her to come home and share a meal with us."

Theodore desired nothing else—he merely longed to hear her call him 'Grandpa' one more time. All these years, she had addressed him as Grandpa while being the adopted daughter. Theodore yearned to hear it from the family's true heiress.

However, Sophia instantly jumped to her feet in protest. "No! The entire Montgomery family cannot go to her!"
###Chapter 485

The Montgomery family, if Isabella chose to save them, would be valued at nearly two hundred billion. That figure would skyrocket once their other assets were included. Though the Montgomery Group carried heavy debt, its proprietary technologies and dedicated workforce were irreplaceable. With sufficient capital infusion and retaining their core team, the Montgomery Group could swiftly reclaim its former prestige. If Isabella gained sole ownership, the rest of the family would be entirely dependent on her, stripped of their shares. They would lose all annual dividends.

Theodore Montgomery shot Sophia a cold glare. "If you can produce fifty billion to rescue this family, then you may claim the Montgomery Group."

Sophia fell silent. If she possessed that kind of wealth, she wouldn't be standing here pleading.

Theodore turned to Richard. "Remember, our only objective is to apologize. Whether she agrees to help is secondary."

"Understood, Father. We know our place after everything that's happened," Richard assured him. Eleanor sighed heavily beside them. "I'm still too ashamed to face her..."

Even a simple apology felt impossible while they were destitute. Asking for financial salvation was an even greater humiliation. Given their past mistreatment and the mountain of debt, how could Isabella possibly agree?

"Eleanor, you must go." Beatrice entered from the adjacent ward. She offered comfort, "An apology to Isabella is necessary. The Montgomerys cannot continue like this. We've exhausted every contact; no one will assist us. If Isabella provides the funds, as Theodore stated, all Montgomery assets and shares become hers. Furthermore, she can receive half of the Kensington family's fortune."

The Kensington family?

That was Beatrice's lineage, which included Eleanor's father—Isabella's great-grandfather. The Kensingtons were centuries-old ceramic developers, producing and supplying exquisite pieces. Their work was classified as nationally protected artifacts, with legends stating their ancestors crafted for royalty. However, the market for such cultural art was niche. Mass-produced commercial ceramics had overshadowed them, despite their superior value and heritage.

Eleanor frowned. "Would Grandfather truly agree to give half his estate to Isabella? That's at least thirty billion!"

"A sigh... You don't understand. Your grandfather only had your uncle and me. Your uncle was meant to inherit, but... he and his wife could never have children. They're in their late sixties now, still childless—too traditional to consider adoption. With no heir, the estate's future troubles him deeply. When I spoke to him today and mentioned Isabella, he expressed confidence in her. He's willing to grant her half," Beatrice explained.

After all, Eleanor was Senior Kensington's granddaughter, making Isabella his great-granddaughter. She was the youngest direct descendant of his bloodline.

A flicker of hope sparked in Eleanor. "With half the Kensington assets... Isabella would only need to provide around twenty billion to save the Montgomerys. Perhaps she'll agree... I'll speak with her."

Sophia seethed with envy. Isabella was so fortunate to have a great-grandfather ready to bequeath his fortune. Why was she so blessed?

Why didn't she have a generous great-grandfather like that?

Outside the ward, an elegant figure halted. Vivienne had come to Grace Memorial Hospital to visit a friend and had coincidentally overheard the entire conversation. Her fists clenched tightly.
###Chapter 486

Isabella knew the Hahn family's reputation intimately.

They were the sole dynasty in the nation honored as 'Ceramic Royalty' and 'Living National Treasures'.

Their craftsmanship was legendary.

Each piece was meticulously handcrafted for royal patrons across the globe.

Their output was intentionally scarce, creating years-long waiting lists for their exquisite work.

Nathaniel's grandmother was their most devoted collector.

She dispatched aides annually to secure her place in the queue, adding a new Hahn masterpiece to her private trove.

If Isabella reclaimed her Montgomery birthright and gained control of both the family shares and half the Hahn fortune…

Nathaniel's grandmother would undoubtedly champion her.

She would wholeheartedly support a union between Isabella and Nathaniel.

McKenzie had intended to expose Isabella to the Blackwoods.

But after overhearing the Montgomerys' discussion…

Isabella's hidden lineage changed everything.

McKenzie couldn't afford any risks.

She had to drive Nathaniel and Isabella apart before the Blackwoods discovered the truth.

McKenzie stormed out of Grace Memorial Hospital.

She slid into her car and immediately dialed Miranda.

"Any progress on locating Annabel?"

"Madam, I was just calling you. You must come to The Grand Mariner at once. I'll be at the service entrance," Miranda's voice buzzed with urgency.

"Drive to The Grand Mariner. Now," McKenzie commanded her driver.

The Grand Mariner was Westchester's most exclusive seafood establishment.

Every delicacy was flown in daily from international waters, prepared only upon order.

The car glided to a halt at the restaurant's rear delivery bay.

Miranda opened the door and slipped inside.

"Madam, look through the window. See who is working in there."

McKenzie peered through the tinted glass.

They were parked directly behind the restaurant's bustling kitchen.

Inside, a frail figure knelt on the cold tile floor.

She scrubbed a basket of fresh prawns with a stiff brush.

A simple white cap covered her hair, pulled into a limp ponytail.

Her uniform was drab and stained, marking her lowest status.

Yet her face remained hauntingly delicate.

It was petite, paler than McKenzie remembered.

Those wide, watery eyes still held that pathetic, pleading look.

One glance still stirred a foolish desire to protect her.

"Tch. Still playing the helpless victim," McKenzie's crimson lips twisted into a cold smirk.

She pushed the car door open and stepped out.

Miranda scurried ahead, clearing a path through the kitchen staff.

Annabel remained focused on her task, scrubbing the prawns on her knees.

She didn't notice the other kitchen staff silently dispersing.

The service door swung open.

A long shadow fell across her work station.

Annabel's eyes traveled up from a pair of elegant beige heels.

Her hands froze mid-scrub.

Her breath hitched.

"Ms. McKenzie…"

"You remember me?" McKenzie placed her hands on her hips, looking down her nose with sharp disdain.

"If you remember our agreement, why are you back?"

"I… I'm so sorry. Truly, I am." Annabel dropped the brush, scrambling to her feet.

She bowed repeatedly, her voice trembling.

"I took the money. I went abroad for my grandmother's treatment, just as you arranged. But five years ago… she passed."

"Her final wish was to be laid to rest here in Westchester. She didn't want to remain in foreign soil."

"I only returned with her ashes to grant her peace. I want nothing else. I swear it."

"Five years?" McKenzie's glare was icy, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

"Did it take five whole years to bury an old woman? Answer me."
###Chapter 487

Isabella lowered her head, her posture as deferential as a servant. "I had no other option..."

"After returning, I discovered my parents—who'd ignored me for years—had also come back. They claimed they were forced to neglect me back then. Having been an orphan for so long, all I desired was to reunite with them and live a quiet life..."

"So you remained in Westchester for five years and bore Nathaniel's child?!" Vivienne's voice sharpened, her eyes blazing with fury. "After what you've done, I could make you vanish without a trace!"

At Rosewood Manor.

Isabella lounged lazily on the sofa, her tone casual but firm. "Ensure Theodore is well cared for. I want him comfortable and content."

"Don't worry—Senior Montgomery has improved greatly since learning the truth. But prepare yourself; Eleanor and Richard are likely to visit soon," Adrian warned.

Isabella's expression remained cool and detached. Exposing Victoria's deceit wasn't about rejoining the Montgomery family. It was about ensuring Victoria faced consequences for her actions. Their apologies and regrets meant nothing to her.

Across the sofa, little Oliver lay on his stomach, sketching intently with colored pencils. After Isabella ended the call, he scrambled over and proudly presented his drawing. "Mommy, look! I made this for you."

Isabella took the paper. A tender scene unfolded under soft window light—herself reclining gracefully on the sofa. The artwork was remarkably detailed and skilled, far beyond his years.

Yet...

Oliver had drawn a large white circle over her abdomen, with a peaceful baby girl sleeping inside. Isabella's lips twitched slightly. Was he truly this desperate for a sister?

Ever since that night, Oliver had constantly hinted at a sibling—through drawings, preparing toys, even excitedly building a small crib. When he discovered the truth, he might be... Her gaze drifted to Nathaniel, seated nearby.

Nathaniel sat in a single armchair, documents resting on his lap. His posture was impeccably elegant, exuding an aura of sharp intelligence and refined coldness. He looked like he belonged on the cover of a luxury magazine.

Even after living together, her heart still raced uncontrollably whenever she watched him. The wound on his arm stood out starkly against his flawless skin.

She remembered how he'd shielded her that day, and all the moments they'd shared since. A strange thought surfaced: Perhaps having his child wouldn't be so terrible.

She knew how sincerely Nathaniel treated her. He seemed genuinely committed to their relationship.

Suddenly, the doorbell chimed.

Isabella frowned. Who would visit Rosewood Manor at this hour? Could it be Eleanor arriving so soon?

She rose and opened the door. A woman stood there, barely five feet tall. Her delicate, palm-sized face wore a pitiable expression, eyes glistening with unshed tears. She wore a faded, cheap white dress that made her appear fragile and meek.

She resembled a pure white lily—so delicate and gentle she might be swept away by the wind. This was the genuine article, unlike Victoria's artificial performance.

Upon seeing Isabella, the woman stammered nervously, "Hello... Is... Is Mr. Blackwood here?"

Isabella's brow furrowed. She was here for Nathaniel?

Unease flickering within her, Isabella turned toward Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, you have a visitor."

Nathaniel glanced up from his documents. His eyes darkened instantly upon seeing the figure at the door. The papers in his hands trembled slightly.
###Chapter 488

The atmosphere in the manor grew thick with tension.

A flicker of something unreadable passed through Sophia's eyes when she saw Nathaniel. She quickly averted her gaze, her voice barely a whisper. "Mr. Blackwood... I... Could we speak privately?" Her tone was meek, almost fragile.

Nathaniel hesitated for a brief moment. He set the document down. He walked toward the door. As he passed Isabella, he stopped. His voice was a low, serious rumble. "I will handle this. Do not forget my words to you."

Isabella frowned. His words? He had said so many things to her...

Nathaniel turned to Sophia. "Follow me."

He led the way toward the koi pond in the garden. Sophia offered Isabella a small, polite nod before trailing after him.

Isabella watched them go, a strange unease coiling in her stomach. She could sense it. Nathaniel's interaction with this woman was different. The way he looked at her was unusual. His entire demeanor was off.

There was history there. A story she did not know.

The image of his broad back leading the way, with her small, delicate figure following behind, was striking. It looked like a scene of a protector and his charge. It felt intimate.

Isabella's hand tightened on the doorframe.

By the koi pond, they were alone. Nathaniel stood with one hand in his pocket, his posture rigid and imposing. He said nothing, simply waiting. Sophia stood behind him, wringing her hands nervously. Finally, she found her voice. "Mr. Blackwood... I wouldn't have come if I had any other choice. I know I wronged you all those years ago..."

Back then, they were not officially together. Yet he was always there. Protecting her. Helping her. His world was sterile then. Just work, study, business deals. She had promised to show him a different life. The simple joys. The vibrant chaos of street food stalls. The beauty in small, everyday moments. But the very next day after making that promise, she took the money. She left Westchester without a word.

Sophia hung her head in shame. "I know five million was too much for someone like me. Taking it was degrading. But my grandmother... she was sick. Kidney failure. The treatment costs were astronomical. I had no other options. And I knew I was never good enough for you. Being with me would have only brought you trouble. So I..."

Nathaniel remained silent. His back was a cold, unreadable wall.

Her voice grew hoarse with emotion. "I planned to never return. To stay away forever. But my grandmother passed five years ago... Her final wish was to be buried in her homeland. She didn't want to rest in a foreign place. She begged me every day to bring her home. I couldn't let her soul be restless. I had to bring her ashes back to Westchester."

"I know you've built a new life. I never intended to disrupt it. I never meant to break my promise to Ms. Delacroix or your mother. But... you know my history. I was an orphan. My parents abandoned me as a child. My grandmother raised me alone. When I returned with her ashes, I found them. My parents. They had come back. It turns out they were captured. Forced into slave labor at illegal brick kilns. Their captors only released them when they were completely broken. Used up..."

Tears welled in Sophia's red-rimmed eyes. "After Grandma died, they were all I had left. I couldn't just leave them here. But the five million... it was all spent on her medical bills. I had nothing left to take them away, to start over somewhere else. So I had to stay. I've been here in Westchester for the past five years."

Nathaniel's expression darkened with each word she spoke. A jolt went through him at the phrase 'five years ago'. His hand clenched inside his pocket. Five years. She returned five years ago. The timeline aligned perfectly. Was it true, then? Was she the one? Was Oliver truly her son? His son? Was Sophia Whitmore the woman from that fateful night?
###Chapter 489

“You worked at The Grand Monarch to earn money?” Nathaniel’s voice came out low and gravelly. “I…”

Sophia lowered her head, guilt washing over her. “Back then, I had just returned to Westchester. Finding a job was nearly impossible without a university degree. When I saw The Grand Monarch was hiring and the position was out of sight in the kitchen, I took it. I wasn’t thinking of anything else. I just wanted to wash dishes in the back. I never went anywhere else in that place, but…” Her mind drifted back to that night five years ago. Her gaze grew distant, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. “A friend of mine got terrible food poisoning on Valentine’s Day. She begged me to deliver a room service order to the penthouse. I tried to refuse, but she said the guest was demanding it urgently. If it was late, her pay would be docked. So…”

“I planned to leave immediately after dropping off the food, but the suite door was slightly ajar. I had no idea it was you inside. I only meant to pull it closed. But when I reached for the handle, you…” Sophia’s words trailed off. She kept her head down, shame and guilt burning on her face.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened to obsidian. That night, he had been drugged. The woman he had dragged into that room was…

Could it truly have been Sophia all along?

Sophia was Oliver’s biological mother?

The woman he had spent five years searching for was right here.

Seeing his stormy expression, Sophia grew anxious. She had always been afraid of him. “Mr. Blackwood, I’m not asking for anything. I know my place. I quit that job and left Westchester right after it happened. I thought I would never trouble you again. I never wanted to be connected to you. But then… I discovered I was pregnant.” Her voice cracked. “I didn’t even know until he was already five months along…”

She continued, the words thick with shame and regret. “No one would have believed I was innocent. My body has always been weak. My cycles were irregular. My family was poor. I couldn’t afford proper medical care in Westchester. For the first five months, I thought I was just sick. I never imagined… It wasn’t until I felt movement that I realized…”

She paused, her hand instinctively moving to her lower abdomen. “I considered an abortion. I didn’t want to cause you more trouble. But the doctor said the fetus was fully formed. He was five months old. He was moving…”

“I genuinely… I truly grew to love him. He was innocent. So I was selfish. I decided to keep him. I wanted to raise him on my own. I never intended to bother you, but…” Her voice broke completely.

Nathaniel’s expression was impenetrable, darker than a moonless night.

Sophia’s voice became a ragged, hoarse whisper. “I never expected… the baby would be stillborn. The doctor told me he was already gone when he was delivered…”

“I only saw him once before they took him away. He was so tiny. So pitiful. Like a little kitten. My heart shattered… I wanted to save him… But I couldn’t…” A sob ripped from her throat.

Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. Her shoulders shook with the force of her breathless, gut-wrenching sobs.

Nathaniel remained with his back to her. He hadn’t turned around once. He couldn’t begin to fathom what she had endured. Giving birth alone. A difficult labor. The death of her child. While he felt no love for her, he was undeniably the cause of all her suffering.

After several minutes, Sophia’s sobs subsided. She wiped her tears away, her movements shaky. “Mr. Blackwood, I’m not telling you this to get anything from you. I’ve survived the hardest part of my life. I never wanted to cause you more trouble. The only reason I’m here today is that I have no other choice. I’m begging for your help.”

She took a shaky breath. “Vivienne found out. She made me tell you everything. She wants to destroy your relationship with Isabella. I didn’t want to do it. All I want is to live a peaceful life with my parents. But she forced me. She made me take a drug. She said she’d never give me the antidote if I told you the truth…”
###Chapter 490

Isabella froze mid-step.

Her knees hit the marble floor with a sharp crack.

"Mr. Blackwood," she whispered, voice trembling. "Please...I want to live. I'm not ready to die." Her hands clenched into fists on her thighs. "I only reconciled with my parents five years ago. They have no other children. I can't leave them like this."

Nathaniel turned at the sound of her collapse.

His eyes narrowed as he took in her crumpled form kneeling before him. He reached down, fingers closing around her arm to pull her up.

"Vivienne drugged you?"

"Yes." The word came out choked. "This afternoon. She gave me your address. Helped me get past Rosewood Manor's security." Her gaze dropped, unable to meet his. "She said...she said no one could develop an antidote. That I'd need monthly doses to survive. If I told you, the worst you'd do is kill her...but I'd suffer forever."

Nathaniel's expression darkened.

His jaw tightened. Not only had Vivienne targeted Isabella, but she'd dragged this innocent woman into her schemes? "Go home," he commanded, voice low. "I'll handle this."

"Thank you." Relief washed over her features. "Thank you so much." She bowed deeply before turning to leave.

Nathaniel watched her retreating figure, his gaze heavy with unspoken thoughts. This woman had endured so much pain...and he was the unwitting cause of it all.

"Dominic," he said without turning. "Watch her. And dig deeper into her situation."

"Yes, sir."

Meanwhile, inside the manor...

After Nathaniel and Sophia left for the gardens, Oliver tugged Isabella toward the window.

He pressed a pair of sleek, high-tech earbuds into her palm. "Put these on, Mommy. They'll pick up their conversation from here."

Isabella shook her head. "Oliver, we can't. This is an invasion of privacy."

"But Daddy's family!" Oliver insisted, his small face serious. "We have a right to know what's happening. You're his wife. This isn't spying—it's understanding him better. How can we be a happy family if we don't understand each other?"

Before she could protest further, he slipped the earbuds into her ears.

Isabella tried to remove them, but Oliver held her hands firmly in his.

She had no choice but to listen.

The voices came through crisp and clear.

But then Oliver heard something he shouldn't have.

His eyes widened. "Mommy, take them off! Now!" He released her hands, suddenly frantic.

But it was too late.

Isabella had heard everything.

Every devastating word.

Her world tilted.

An invisible hand seemed to squeeze her heart, stealing her breath.

That fragile, gentle woman...was the one Nathaniel had slept with?

Oliver's biological mother?
###Chapter 491

Isabella had considered countless scenarios. She believed someone had schemed against Nathaniel.

She assumed the woman who slept with him was malicious and cunning. She was prepared to face any challenge alongside Nathaniel.

She never expected the woman would be fragile, innocent, and harmless. A woman who endured immense suffering because of Nathaniel... As Christopher pulled Isabella toward the window, she watched Nathaniel extend his hand to help Sophia up. Throughout their entire relationship, Isabella never witnessed Nathaniel touch another woman. Yet he protected Sophia. He treated her differently...

If Isabella wasn't present, Nathaniel would have reunited with Sophia. Christopher would have found his real mother...

Seeing Isabella's expression shift, Christopher tugged her hand urgently. "Don't overthink, Mommy. Daddy only loves you! This mommy is from the past. And I only like you! I only want you as my mommy! Even though she seems nice, I don't like her. I feel nothing for her. Momo only loves you!"

Christopher spoke with complete sincerity. He truly felt no connection to Sophia, while he adored Isabella instantly upon meeting her. Being with Isabella felt warm and secure, as if she was his real mother.

Isabella removed the earbuds and ruffled his small head. "Don't worry, Momo. Mommy isn't overthinking. I'm just..."

She just found it difficult to accept. The situation felt increasingly complicated.

The door opened suddenly. Nathaniel's tall, imposing figure entered. He saw Isabella and Christopher by the window, holding the high-tech earbuds. He frowned.

Had she heard everything? Isabella met Nathaniel's gaze. Their eye contact grew complex and heavy.

The atmosphere turned tense and strange. After a moment of silence, Nathaniel spoke to Christopher. "Go upstairs."

"Okay..." Christopher sensed the seriousness and scurried upstairs on his small legs.

Isabella set down the earbuds calmly. "Momo gave them to me." She didn't want Nathaniel thinking she eavesdropped habitually.

"I understand."

Nathaniel harbored no suspicion toward her. After closing the door, he walked into the living room and sat on the sofa. He rested his arms on his lap, fingers entwined, leaning slightly forward.

He adopted a pensive posture, his expression grave. Isabella had never seen him like this. She knew he was gathering his thoughts, so she waited patiently by the window. After a while, Nathaniel asked, "Isabella, do you trust me?" His deep voice carried a faint trace of unease.

Isabella frowned. This wasn't the opening she anticipated. She looked at him and countered, "Does it matter? Whether I trust you or not."

"Of course it does." Nathaniel lifted his gaze to hers. "You heard everything. I was drugged five years ago. My consciousness was blurred. I harmed Sophia."

"Sophia attended the same university as me. I owed her a debt. But that's all it was—repaying a favor. No emotions involved. Give me time. I'll resolve this." His final sentence was delivered with sincere reassurance.

Isabella felt conflicted. Though Nathaniel sounded genuine, she had to consider other factors. Sophia suffered tremendously because of Nathaniel. Nathaniel had to make amends and take responsibility.

There would be more interactions between them. Could feelings develop through continued contact? Moreover, they shared a university background and a ten-year history.
###Chapter 492

Isabella Montgomery had only known Nathaniel Blackwood for three months.

Nathaniel noticed her silence.

His usually icy composure fractured with unease.

“Don’t overthink this, Isabella.” His voice turned gravel-rough. “I’ll handle it.”

“How long?” The question sliced through the tension.

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. A timeline? He couldn’t promise one.

“I’m not certain yet. But I’ll expedite it.” Sophia Whitmore was drugged. Confronting Vivienne Delacroix without the antidote would backfire. Vivienne would make Sophia suffer more if provoked.

Until Sebastian Blackwood and his medical team developed an antidote, the situation remained volatile. Nathaniel refused to make false promises. Especially not to Isabella.

A sharp pang pierced Isabella’s chest. His caution was unnerving. The decisive Nathaniel Blackwood was hesitating. For Sophia.

He feared for her safety. He worried the antidote might never come.

It was simple, really. Had it been anyone else, Nathaniel would have crushed Vivienne immediately. But this was Sophia Whitmore. His former lover. Chris’s biological mother. That changed everything.

His concern for the consequences shackled him. That’s why he couldn’t give her a clear answer.

Ding-dong.

The doorbell chimed again.

Both their gazes snapped toward the entrance. Was it Sophia returning? Neither moved.

The bell persisted.

Faint voices filtered through the door. “Perhaps Isabella isn’t home? Should we wait?” It was Eleanor Kensington’s voice.

Isabella released a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. “Go inside,” she instructed Nathaniel.

After that scene, introducing him to her estranged parents was impossible. Their future together now felt uncertain, hanging by a thread. Nathaniel paused, then wordlessly stood and retreated into the house. He respected her decision. He wanted to claim their relationship openly, but now was not the time.

The air in the living room remained thick and heavy even after he left. Isabella drew a steadying breath and opened the door.

Eleanor and Richard Montgomery stood there. Their wealthy veneer had completely vanished. They still wore the same clothes from the hospital yesterday, now wrinkled and stale. Eleanor’s hair accessories were gone, her face bare and weary. She looked plain and diminished.

Eleanor held a delicate matcha cake box. “Isabella…” Her greeting was strained, overly polite.

Isabella leaned against the doorframe, her posture cool and closed-off. “Yes?” Her tone was clipped, each word measured and distant, as if speaking cost her a fortune.

Richard and Eleanor felt the chilling divide. Guilt washed over them. This was their actual daughter. Their flesh and blood.

Because of Victoria Kensington’s schemes, they had ruined any chance with their real child. For twenty-three years, they’d cherished an imposter while their true heiress was scorned as the ‘adopted’ daughter.

Eleanor’s emotions were a tangled mess. She extended the cake. “Isabella, I remember you loved matcha cake. Your father and I bought this for you.”

Isabella’s eyes flicked to the offering. Her expression, already frosty, turned to absolute ice.
###Chapter 493

Matcha cake again.

In their youth, Victoria never enjoyed matcha-flavored desserts. She would always pass her portion to Isabella. As the adopted daughter, Isabella never felt empowered to refuse. She endured every bitter bite.

Eventually, everyone assumed she adored matcha cakes.

No one ever truly learned her preferences.

The memory almost made her laugh aloud now.

"I never liked matcha cake," Isabella stated flatly.

Eleanor froze, the cake hovering awkwardly between them. She had always believed Isabella loved matcha. All those years, they never knew her true tastes?

Slowly, Eleanor withdrew the offering. "We'll get you something you prefer next time. We want to understand you better now."

"Unnecessary," Isabella dismissed coldly.

Richard's voice strained with emotion. "We know you resent us, Isabella. We were wrong. We failed you terribly."

He continued, "Discovering you're our biological daughter changes everything. We will compensate for past neglect. We won't repeat those mistakes."

Eleanor's eyes glistened with unshed tears. Her gaze pleaded for forgiveness. "I'm so deeply sorry, Isabella. We treated you like an outsider since childhood. We never listened. Never tried to understand you."

Her voice trembled. "Recently, our actions became unforgivable. We wronged you repeatedly."

She clasped her hands tightly. "We don't deserve your forgiveness. But tell us how to ease your pain. Shout at us. Strike us. Anything to provide you solace."

Both parents radiated genuine remorse and shame.

Isabella observed their weary expressions. The satisfaction she anticipated felt hollow now. Seeing their pain brought no fulfillment.

Their apologies meant nothing. Could words undo childhood trauma? Erase years of neglect?

Never.

Those experiences shaped her permanently. She never felt belonging in this family.

Yet, should she despise them? They were also Victoria's puppets. Victims of manipulation.

Forgive them? Could she?

Five years ago, she attempted explanation. She claimed victimhood. Eleanor struck her before she finished speaking.

The Jordan family universally condemned her. They dismissed her pleas. Branded her a disgrace.

They exiled her barely conscious to Africa. Abandoned her to die. Only miraculous fortune spared her.

For five years, no contact. No concern. As if she never existed.

Returning to Westchester, they blamed her incessantly. Despised her presence.

Just yesterday, they disowned her. Seized her shares. Attacked her manor.

Isabella's eyes hardened recalling these injustices. "Leave. Your apologies are worthless. I require nothing from you. Nor will I retaliate."
###Chapter 494

“That only makes us feel more guilty, Isabella…” Eleanor clutched Isabella’s wrist desperately.

Isabella’s gaze turned icy as she stared at the hand restraining her.

Eleanor immediately released her grip under that frosty glare. She withdrew her hand, eyes reddening. Her voice came out hoarse and broken. “I know forgiveness can’t be earned overnight. We’ll spend our lives making it up to you. We’ll visit whenever we can.”

She took a shaky breath, pressing on. “But we have one request. Please do this for your Grandfather. He misses you terribly. He just wants one family meal together…” Eleanor trailed off, terrified of rejection. She looked up, pleading. “Don’t worry about the cost. I’ve sold all my jewelry. We won’t eat at the hospital. We can go anywhere you want. My treat.”

Her eyes begged for a sliver of hope. “Just one meal. Please?”

She braced for the inevitable refusal. Isabella’s cold demeanor offered no comfort.

Then, unexpectedly, Isabella spoke.

“I’ll come.” Her voice was flat, decisive. “I will also save the Montgomery family. And I will do everything in my power to save Benjamin’s life.”

Eleanor and Richard stared, utterly stunned. Was she serious? She agreed to return? She offered to save them without them even asking?

“Do not mistake this for forgiveness,” Isabella stated coldly, cutting through their shock. “This is solely for Grandfather Theodore and the Montgomery legacy.”

She remembered his unwavering support. When the entire family scorned her, he had insisted on granting her fifteen percent of the Montgomery shares. He treated her as his own. She would not abandon him now.

Eleanor nodded frantically, tears welling. “I understand! Truly, I do! This is more than we dared hope for! Your Grandfather already promised… if you save the family, everything will be yours. The entire Montgomery fortune. And my father… he vowed to give you half of the Kensington assets!”

Isabella frowned. She anticipated Theodore’s offer. The Kensington proposal, however, was unexpected. Her knowledge of the Kensingtons was limited to whispers. Eleanor never brought her along on visits.

Her impression was built from others fawning over Victoria. “She’s so lucky! Heir to the Montgomerys and the Kensingtons!” “The premier ceramics dynasty in the country! A living national treasure!” “Their pieces are commissioned by royalty! We commoners never even see them!” “Ugh! I’d kill to be born into that family!”

A family of such prestige was willing to hand her half their wealth? It made no sense.

After a moment’s consideration, her decision was firm. “I will accept the Montgomery shares. I refuse the Kensington assets.”

Eleanor’s face fell. How could she refuse such an immense fortune?
###Chapter 495

The Montgomery family’s shares were not particularly high, yet their global prestige was immense.

Even a simple ceramic vase crafted by the Montgomerys could fetch over a million dollars at auction.

Everyone longed for a connection to the Montgomery dynasty. Yet Isabella had just refused their offer?

“I’m helping the Montgomery family for Grandfather’s sake,” Isabella stated calmly. “I don’t require any reward.”

“I don’t need repayment from any of you. You should head back now. I need to pack.”

With that, she stepped inside the villa and shut the door. Though they were her biological parents, she hadn’t forgiven them. She wouldn’t allow them inside.

She couldn’t risk them discovering Nathaniel lived with her. Richard and Eleanor, still outside, didn’t mind. They were already overjoyed that Isabella agreed to return and save the family. Everything else could be mended over time. They were prepared to spend their remaining years making amends.

Back in the villa…

Isabella waited until Richard and Eleanor had driven away before entering the living room. Nathaniel was lounging on the sofa, doing nothing but waiting. Clearly, he was waiting for her.

When he saw her, he began to speak. “Isabella.”

“I plan to stay at Montgomery Manor for a while,” she interrupted. Nathaniel’s brow furrowed. Stay at the manor? Did that mean she no longer wanted to live with him? He stood up immediately.

“What’s wrong, Isabella? Talk to me. I dislike unresolved issues.” Distance would only create more distance between them.

Isabella met his gaze seriously. “It’s not about leaving things unsaid. I just believe we need space. Time to think clearly.”

“I have nothing left to think about. My position is clear. I have no connection to Sophia. I only need to find the antidote for the drug she took,” Nathaniel insisted.

“But I need time to think, Nathaniel. Please give me that,” Isabella argued, her voice heavy with fatigue.

Though Nathaniel seemed resolute, she needed to process everything. His history with Sophia seemed solid. Were it not for the Blackwoods’ interference, they might have been together. They even shared a son.

Sophia was Oliver’s biological mother. Nathaniel, Oliver, and Sophia were meant to be a complete family. Without Isabella, they might have found happiness together.

In this light, Isabella felt like an intruder.

She needed time to determine if she was the third wheel. To understand Sophia’s true significance to Nathaniel. She looked at him solemnly.

“If you’re certain of your choice, then let time prove it. True love won’t fade from a few days apart. I’ll be occupied with family matters. I hope you can resolve things with Sophia.”

Having said her piece, she marched upstairs.

Nathaniel watched her retreating figure, his expression heavy and conflicted. He remained rooted to the spot for a long time. Ultimately, he did not follow her.

On the second floor of the villa… Oliver was in his room, playing with his toys.
###Chapter 496

It was a tiny robot.
Nathaniel had somehow squeezed a Barbie dress onto the metallic toy.
He frowned, wondering if his baby sister would actually like something like this.

Ugh. It looked ridiculous.
He’d just buy her a brand new one.
Just as he was about to toss it in the trash, Isabella walked in.

She scooped Oliver into her arms and gently pinched his cheeks. “Is my sweet boy having fun?”

“Yeah! I wanted to give all my toys to my baby sister, but… they’re all kinda ugly.”
Most were Transformers, race cars, or battle bots.
Isabella understood when she spotted the frilly pink dress stretched over the robot’s chassis.

If things were different… she might have actually considered building a family with Nathaniel.
She pushed the thought away. “Oliver, I need you to promise me something.”

His smile instantly vanished.
Tears welled in his wide, fearful eyes.

Her chest tightened.
She’d grown so attached to him these past weeks.
Even though he wasn’t biologically hers, a deep, protective bond had formed.
The idea of him hurting felt like a physical wound.

But she had no choice.
She needed space. Time to breathe.
She needed to see what Nathaniel would do—how he truly felt about Sophia.
Time would reveal if their family could ever truly be whole.

If not… she would walk away for good.

She sat him on the bed, her voice soft. “You know Mommy’s family is in trouble, right? The Montgomery family… we’ve lost everything. My brother is in the hospital. I have to go back. I need to fix things, to fight off the bad people. When it’s all over, I’ll come back for you.”

“No! Waa… no!” He burst into sobs instantly. “Don’t leave me! Please, Mommy! Don’t go!”
His small arms locked around her neck, his whole body trembling against hers.
Tears soaked through her shirt.
Each cry felt like a shard of glass in her heart.

She held him tighter. “Sweetheart, listen. I’m not leaving you. I just need to handle some things at home.”

“You’re lying! I’m not a baby! I know you’re mad at Daddy! You’re leaving him! And you’re leaving me!”
He suddenly pulled away, scrambling off the bed. “I hate Daddy! He hurt you! How could he be with another woman? I’m gonna beat him up!”

He dashed toward the door, a tiny ball of fury.
Isabella’s heart lurched. She hadn’t expected him to see through it so clearly.
She caught him just as his little hand reached for the doorknob, pulling him back into her arms.

“Oliver, no. You misunderstood. I swear on my life, I will come back to you. I just need to save my family first.”
She prayed that by the time she dealt with the Montgomery crisis and Benjamin, Nathaniel would have resolved things with Sophia.

But Oliver kept crying, his small body shaking. “I don’t believe you! You’re lying! You won’t come back! You don’t love us anymore! Waa…!”

His desperate wails filled the room.
Then, steady, heavy footsteps echoed from the hallway.
Nathaniel walked in.
###Chapter 497

Nathaniel approached Isabella's side.

He settled beside her with practiced ease, his movements fluid and deliberate.

His gaze softened as he looked at Oliver cradled in her arms. "Momo, Daddy and Mommy are perfectly fine. Mommy would never disappoint you."

"Waa... I don't believe it!" Oliver's tear-filled eyes glared accusingly at Nathaniel. "Mommy's leaving! She's leaving a terrible man like you! Even Momo doesn't want you anymore! Why did Mommy ever choose you?"

Nathaniel's expression tightened momentarily. "You truly believe Mommy doesn't care for me?"

"Yes!" Oliver nodded vigorously, his small face set in stubborn defiance.

The moment the word left his lips, Nathaniel's arm snaked around Isabella's shoulders, drawing her firmly against him.

His lips captured hers in a sudden, possessive kiss.

Right there, in full view of their distraught son.

Oliver's crying ceased abruptly.

Isabella froze in shock.

She had been tense since Nathaniel sat down, the air between them charged with unspoken tension. This bold move completely blindsided her.

Her hands instinctively rose to push him away, but she hesitated.

Oliver's tear-streaked face flashed in her mind.

If he truly believed she was abandoning them, his heartbreak would only deepen. She couldn't bear to see him suffer.

Reluctantly, she allowed the kiss to continue.

Nathaniel's kiss was demanding, leaving no room for doubt about his intentions.

When he finally pulled back, he turned to their son. "Convinced now?"

"Hmm... Maybe fifty percent..." Oliver mumbled, wiping his tears.

After all, if Mommy truly hated Daddy, why would she let him kiss her like that?

But still...

"You were the one kissing Mommy," Oliver pointed out with childish logic. "That only proves you like her. Mommy didn't kiss you back at all..."

Both adults fell silent at his perceptive observation.

Why did their child have to be so astutely observant?

Parenting such a clever boy presented unique challenges.

Nathaniel's silent gaze shifted to Isabella, waiting expectantly.

A flush crept up her cheeks. She was still recovering from the intensity of his kiss, and now she had to initiate one?

But if she didn't, how would she calm their distressed son?

After a brief internal struggle, she leaned forward and pressed her lips briefly against his.

The moment their lips connected, an electric jolt passed through them both, making their hearts race.

Isabella pulled back instantly, her face burning with embarrassment.

Oliver's innocent voice piped up again. "Waa... That didn't look real at all! I can tell Mommy doesn't mean it! She doesn't really like Daddy! Waa... I don't want Mommy to leave! I won't let her go!"

He clung desperately to Isabella's arm, as if his tight grip alone could prevent her departure.

Isabella felt utterly helpless. This situation was spiraling out of control.

With renewed determination, she wrapped her arms around Nathaniel's neck and pulled him closer.

She kissed him properly this time, pouring all her conflicted emotions into the embrace.

"Momo, do you believe us now?" she asked breathlessly when they finally separated.

She would completely break down if he still refused to believe them...

"Haha! I believe you now!" Oliver's tears miraculously vanished, replaced by a bright smile. "But if Daddy and Mommy love each other so much, why are you separating? Won't you miss each other? If Mommy has to go home, why can't you take us with you?"

He looked up at Isabella with wide, hopeful eyes, his innocent question hanging in the air between them.
###Chapter 498

Isabella was completely stunned.

Oh, heavens.

It looked like she was going to end up staying with Oliver after all!

Suddenly, Nathaniel’s deep voice cut through the room. “Don’t worry, Momo. Mommy has agreed to see us once a day. Or we can visit her at the Montgomery manor.”

“Really?” Oliver’s eyes lit up like tiny stars.

Isabella frowned.

Had she said that?

She didn’t recall making any such promise.

But under Oliver’s hopeful gaze, remembering how heartbroken he had been, how he had sobbed… she had no choice.

She nodded. “Yes.”

“Yes! That’s wonderful! I get to see Mommy every single day! I want to see Mommy every day!” Oliver began bouncing on the spot, a pure, joyful dance.

Isabella couldn't stop the smile that spread across her face as she watched him.

Children found happiness so easily. Their joy was so simple, so complete.

How perfect it would be to stay with him. To watch him grow up day by day.

A wave of sadness washed over her.

Would that ever happen? Could she ever stay by his side forever?

It seemed… impossible.

The thought of Sophia Whitmore made everything feel long and uncertain. Endlessly complicated.

“Go help Mommy pack her things,” Nathaniel instructed Oliver.

“Okay!” Oliver immediately grabbed a small suitcase. He began carefully placing her clothes inside. He added her skincare products. Then the books and chess strategy manuals she liked to read.

His small figure moved with serious purpose around the room. It was an utterly adorable sight.

Nathaniel sat down beside Isabella. His voice was low, for her ears only. “Isabella, I’m letting you go home. But this doesn’t mean I’m letting you go. Remember the promise you made to Momo. We see each other once a day.”

Isabella was speechless.

She had been expertly trapped.

She had thought this would be a clean break. A chance for them both to cool down and think clearly. A period of no contact was what she had wanted.

Now she was committed to daily meetings?

She couldn’t refuse, though. Not with Oliver’s happy face seared into her memory.

“Don’t worry,” she said, her tone clipped. “I’ll keep my word. I’ll message you the time and place for our meetings. Wait for my instructions.”

What she really meant was she did not want them showing up unannounced. Their relationship was on unstable ground. She didn’t want anyone else knowing about it yet.

Nathaniel saw right through her. His eyes darkened.

After a while, Isabella zipped up the suitcase. She headed for the garage without looking back.

She could feel two pairs of eyes burning into her. But she didn’t dare turn around.

She knew if she looked back, she would miss them too much to leave.

As she got on her motorcycle, she caught their reflection in the rearview mirror.

A tall, imposing man and a small boy.

Nathaniel stood with one hand in his pocket, the picture of elegant perfection. Yet the air around him was heavy and tense.

Oliver watched her with wide, watery eyes. His little cheeks were puffed out, looking like he might burst into tears at any second.

A painful squeeze clenched Isabella’s heart. She felt suffocated.

She wanted to run back to them. To forget about everything else.

But her rationality held her firmly in place.

No. She couldn’t go back.

Not yet.

She needed time. Time to see Nathaniel’s true feelings regarding Sophia.

After what Alexander had put her through, she craved a relationship that was pure. Simple. Free of complications.

Besides, she would still see them every day. It wasn’t a real separation.

Before she could fix the mess with her own family, Nathaniel needed to resolve his past with Sophia. If he truly loved her…

Isabella could only hope that was the case.
###Chapter 499

Nathaniel watched the motorcycle vanish down the winding road.

He turned to face Oliver, who was pouting with clear displeasure.

"You would have been finished, Daddy, if I hadn't stepped in. You need to fix everything with that woman. I won't call you Daddy again until you do."

"Don't worry." Nathaniel ruffled his son's hair, his voice firm. His mind was set. Everything he felt for Sophia was just guilt.

Dominic returned just then, carrying a stack of files. "Mr. Blackwood, our investigation confirms everything Ms. Sophia stated. She currently lives with her parents in Willowbrook. Their conditions are... difficult."

Because Sophia had a child out of wedlock, the villagers had shunned her. They hurled insults and looked down on her. No one would marry her. No one offered her family any help. She used her wages from The Grand Mariner to support her parents. Their life was a constant struggle.

Dominic continued. "I've collected her blood sample. We'll have the drug composition analyzed shortly. I also obtained strands of her hair. Should I send it for DNA testing?"

Nathaniel scanned the documents and gave a single nod. Even with the evidence, a DNA test was essential. "Have Sebastian handle this personally."

This matter was too important. There was no room for error.

"Yes, Sir." Dominic nodded and prepared to leave.

Nathaniel stopped him, a new thought occurring. "Her living and working conditions need immediate improvement."

The report mentioned Sophia lived in a dilapidated tile house. It was so old it threatened to collapse at any moment.

Dominic understood the unspoken order. He left to make the arrangements.

Oliver's pout deepened. "I don't like how nice you're being to this Auntie!"

"Ollie, it's not about being nice. It's about repaying a debt. I can only fix things once the debt is cleared." His voice was rough, thick with emotion.

Oliver grunted in acknowledgment, still mumbling under his breath. "I still don't like it..."

Nathaniel frowned. Children had sharp instincts. If Sophia was truly his mother, why did Oliver feel nothing for her? Was it because he had spent too much time with Isabella?

He didn't linger on the thought.

Maxwell, watching from the shadows, was equally puzzled. The investigations by Isabella's uncles had pointed to a secret plot against Nathaniel. How did it lead back to this seemingly helpless woman?

And if Sophia was the woman from that night, why had all the data and video footage vanished? Their best technicians couldn't recover a single trace.

How could a weak, harmless woman possess that kind of power?

He called Silas to report his findings.

He was met with Silas's cheerful response. "So you're saying Nathaniel's first love has returned?"

"Yes, but something feels off about it..."

"What's off? It doesn't matter if something's off! Nathaniel was never right for Isabella anyway! Now that his old flame is back, things will work out. This gives William a real chance! Maxwell, I'm warning you: Don't tell Isabella things she doesn't need to know. Just do your job." Silas's tone was stern, leaving no room for argument.

Maxwell still felt he was missing a crucial piece of the puzzle, but it eluded him. He reconsidered. Nathaniel was a businessman with countless enemies and a complicated family. William was a researcher from a respectable, scholarly family with a clean reputation.

"Understood. Don't worry. I also believe Boss Montgomery needs a gentle, uncomplicated man," Maxwell replied.

Meanwhile, Isabella sped away from Rosewood Manor on her motorcycle.

She called Maxwell as she rode. "Prepare five billion. Any news from the doctors you contacted?"

"Don't worry, Boss Montgomery. They've already responded. They will visit Benjamin today," Maxwell informed her.

Isabella felt a wave of relief. She continued her ride.

After a long distance, she spotted two familiar figures waiting at a bus stop.
###Chapter 500

They were Eleanor and Richard.

With the Montgomery family bankrupt, they no longer owned any vehicles. Public transportation was their only option now. They had taken the bus to see Isabella.

The bus stop was a thirty-minute walk from Rosewood Manor.

Eleanor and Richard felt a deep sense of shame and discomfort when they spotted Isabella. This level of poverty was entirely new to them; they had never experienced such hardship in their entire lives.

They never imagined Isabella would witness them at their absolute lowest point…

Isabella’s grip on the bicycle handles tightened. She paused for a brief second. Then, she pedaled away swiftly. She did not even glance in their direction, treating them like complete strangers.

Did she feel sorry for them? Not in the slightest.

During Isabella’s first year of middle school, Richard had slapped her. The reason was trivial—she had accidentally dropped ice cream on Victoria in the car. As punishment, he forced her to take public transit for an entire month.

They attended the most exclusive private school in Westchester. Every student came from an immensely wealthy family. Luxury vehicles were the norm. Some even arrived in rare, limited-edition cars. Victoria was chauffeured in a custom white sedan.

For that entire month, Isabella had to ride the bus. She always arrived at school with scuffed shoes. Her hair was often disheveled. She carried the strange, unpleasant smells of the crowded bus with her.

The other students would look at her with pure disdain. Their sneers were constant and cruel. “The Montgomerys have an adopted daughter like this? How utterly humiliating!” “One Victoria is more than enough for that family. Why did they bother picking up this trash?” “If I were part of that family, I’d have thrown her out immediately. She’s disgusting!”

Remembering those days, Isabella’s eyes turned cold and distant. It was only fair they finally understood the humiliation they had forced upon her.

At Grace Memorial Hospital.

Theodore Montgomery, Gregory, Penelope, and Sophia were gathered in the hospital room. They were supposedly there to watch over Benjamin. In truth, every single one of them was waiting for Isabella.

Theodore felt a knot of anxiety. He wondered if Isabella would actually agree to have a meal with them. The other three, however, had a different hope. They were waiting to see if she would save the family. They desperately wanted to escape their current situation. This vulgar existence was beneath them.

The private room was spacious, over seventy square meters. It included a sofa and an ensuite bathroom. For the once-pampered Montgomerys, however, living together in this single room was intolerable. It felt cramped and undignified.

The sound of approaching footsteps caught their attention. They all turned toward the door, expecting to see Isabella. Their surprise was palpable when Alexander Whitmore appeared instead.

Alexander was impeccably dressed in a tailored suit. He looked every bit the powerful, handsome executive. Theodore’s eyelids twitched with irritation at the sight of him. “Get out!” he commanded sharply.

There was still much they didn’t understand about the recent events. But Theodore’s disgust was clear. He despised how Alexander had toyed with the emotions of both his granddaughters.

Alexander remained completely calm. “Theodore,” he said, his voice steady. “I’m here to help Benjamin.” He stepped aside, revealing a man standing behind him.

The man was young and wore a green long-sleeved shirt. He carried an air of sharp intelligence and crisp professionalism. The family’s eyes widened in recognition.

It was Sebastian Worthington. A brilliantly renowned physician in Westchester, despite his youth.

Sebastian was only thirty years old, yet his fame was widespread. There was a famous case of an athlete who had been disabled. Confined to a wheelchair for a decade, every specialist had given up on him. Sebastian, using only acupuncture, had miraculously treated him. The athlete walked again. The story had gone viral.

Rumors said Sebastian was the sole apprentice of the legendary Dr. Weir. The Weir family was considered the best in the medical field. Their ancestors had served as physicians to the Royal Palace. Their exceptional reputation had been maintained for centuries.

The Weir name was synonymous with medical excellence worldwide. As Dr. Weir’s protégé, Sebastian was notoriously private and rarely made public appearances.

After Benjamin’s accident, Theodore had tried everything to contact Sebastian. All his attempts had failed. He had no success at all.

Who could have predicted that Alexander would be the one to bring him here?
