###Chapter 1

My phone screen lit up.

A video began playing automatically.

My Liam was tied to a chair.

A masked kidnapper swung a hammer at his fingers.

One finger.

Then another.

Blood splattered violently.

A message popped up.

"One hundred million dollars ransom. Wire the money. Or next time, it will be his head."

My hands trembled so badly I could barely hold the phone.

My heart felt like it was trying to escape my chest.

I forced myself to stay calm.

I immediately logged into my bank account to transfer the funds.

A system alert popped up.

"Account Frozen."

The person who froze it was Scarlett Roscente.

Alexander Roscente's secretary.

Also his publicly known mistress.

I stormed into the CEO's office.

Scarlett was sitting in Alexander's chair, applying lipstick.

She looked up at me.

Her gaze was utterly contemptuous.

"Oh, you got here fast."

"Need money?"

She pulled a single bill from her wallet.

She flung it at my face.

"Two hundred fifty dollars. For you."

The edge of the bill scraped across my cheek.

It stung a little.

She laughed, her whole body shaking with glee.

"Try negotiating with the kidnappers."

"Pay in installments."

"Get the child back in installments too."

"How about that?"
--------

I raised my hand and slapped her.

Then I slapped her again with the back of my hand.

The sharp sound echoed through the office.

Scarlett covered her face and screamed.

"How dare you hit me!"

The office door was kicked open.

Alexander rushed in.

He shoved me aside violently.

He moved to protect Scarlett.

I crashed into the coffee table.

A sharp pain shot through my ribs.

Alexander's eyes were icy cold.

"Apologize."

I steadied myself against the table and stood up.

"She froze the joint account."

"Liam has been kidnapped!"

Alexander scoffed.

"Quite the story."

"Let me tell you the truth."

"Scarlett and I already have a son."

"Be smart about this."

"That child might still call you 'Mom'."

My phone vibrated.

The kidnapper sent a new video.

Liam's fingers were a bloody, mangled mess.

But as the camera zoomed in.

I froze.

That wasn't Liam.

They looked very similar.

But there was no mole by the eye.

I suddenly became very calm.

I transferred two hundred and fifty dollars to the kidnapper.

I made the note very clear.

"Partial payment as requested by the child's biological mother."

"Please return the child in partial installments."

Scarlett's face turned pale.

Alexander didn't notice.

He was tenderly stroking Scarlett's cheek.

I walked to a corner of the hallway.

I video-called Liam.

He answered after two rings.

Liam's little face filled the screen.

"Mommy!"

"I'm at the airport!"

"Uncle and I won the championship!"

The sound of airport announcements was in the background.

My nose stung with emotion.

"My宝贝 is amazing."

"Mommy will wait for you to come home."

I ended the call.

I turned and saw Scarlett directing employees to put up a black and white photo.

It was a picture of Liam's face.

The words "In Loving Memory" were written below.

I rushed over and tore the photo to pieces.

Shreds of paper scattered everywhere.

Scarlett put on a sad expression.

"My condolences, sister."

"I'm only doing this for your own good."

I laughed coldly.

"The condolences should be for you."

"It's your son who was kidnapped."

Scarlett's face went deathly white.

She threw herself into Alexander's arms, sobbing.

"She cursed Noah!"

Alexander slapped me across the face.

"You bitch!"

"Haven't you and your son sucked enough of my blood?"

"You want money?"

"Then take your clothes off!"

"One thousand dollars per piece!"

Employees all around held up their phones, recording.

I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth.

I cast the kidnapper's video onto the main lobby screen.

The bloody images caused gasps of shock.

Scarlett suddenly screamed and covered her eyes.

"It's horrible!"

Alexander immediately yelled for someone to smash the screen.

He didn't see.

The child's features in the video were identical to Scarlett's.

The IT department forcibly deleted the video from my phone.

Scarlett hid in Alexander's embrace.

She raised an eyebrow at me triumphantly.

The kidnapper's call came through on Alexander's phone.

The speakerphone echoed through the hall.

"Mr. Roscente, do you really not want your son?"

A child's cries tore through the air.

"Daddy! Mommy! It hurts!"

Alexander froze.

"That sounds like Noah."

Scarlett quickly interrupted.

"Nonsense!"

"Noah is safe at the family estate!"

"It must be Liam imitating Noah!"

Alexander immediately agreed.

He even shouted to the kidnapper.

"Just kill him then."

"Remember to preserve the kidneys for freezing."

"Noah needs a kidney source."

"You'll get ten million if you do it right."

The kidnapper hung up directly.

I looked at Alexander.

My stomach churned with nausea.

I pulled the divorce agreement from my bag and threw it in his face.

"Divorce."

"Sign it now."
###Chapter 2

Alexander Roscente's eyes turned icy cold.

A mocking smile curled at the corners of his lips.

"Failing to get money, you resort to threats now?"

He snatched a pen and signed with swift, harsh strokes.

He slammed the signed divorce agreement onto my face.

The edge of the paper scraped across my cheek.

"The doctor warned long ago that your fertility would decline year by year."

"By now, you probably can't even produce an egg, can you?"

He looked down at me from his superior height.

"I was going to be generous and let you stay at the Roscente house as a maid."

"Since you're refusing the offer, don't come crawling back to me later."

I clutched the divorce papers tightly, my knuckles turning white.

The truth rolled on my tongue, but I swallowed it back.

He was the one diagnosed with infertility back then.

To protect his dignity, I took the blame for it.

Alexander turned and scooped Scarlett Roscente into his arms.

"Scarlett, we're going to the hospital now."

"Noah can have his kidney transplant surgery immediately."

The kidnappers delivered the kidney as promised.

Alexander immediately had his men escort me to the hospital.

He demanded I sign the organ donation consent form.

When I arrived at the operating room, Alexander was transferring money to the kidnappers.

A cold, sinister voice came through his phone.

"Very prompt, Mr. Roscente. But without the full hundred million, your son might be returned in pieces."

Alexander hung up angrily and yanked me to the table.

"Sign it and give your fingerprint. Now."

I stared at him coldly.

"This is Noah's kidney. Scarlett should be the one to sign."

Alexander grabbed my chin violently.

His grip was so tight it felt like he would crush my bones.

"Say one more word wishing harm on Noah, and I'll make your life a living hell."

His assistant rushed in urgently.

"Mr. Roscente, the IT department located the kidnappers' hideout!"

"We can rescue the young master if we alert the police!"

I quickly broke free from Alexander's grip.

"Then notify the police immediately!"

Alexander shouted to stop them.

"No one calls the police!"

His gaze swept over everyone with dark menace.

"Destroy all the location data now."

I looked at him in disbelief.

"Alexander, he's your own son!"

He shoved me away forcefully.

"Noah needs this kidney. Calling the police will ruin everything."

"Are you really that eager to kill a child?"

He ordered his men to smash my phone and computer.

I watched expressionlessly, hatred churning in my eyes.

Alexander, you chose this path yourself.

Scarlett suddenly rushed into the operating room in tears.

"Alexander! The staff at the family estate said Noah is missing!"
###Chapter 3

Alexander's face darkened instantly.

Anxiety crept into his expression.

Scarlett raised her hate-filled eyes.

She stared fixedly at me.

She suddenly dropped to her knees before me.

"Sister, I know you're grieving the loss of your son."

"You resent that my Noah is still alive."

"But if you're angry, take it out on me."

"Please give Noah back to me."

"I'm begging you."

I frowned, about to ask what madness possessed her.

Alexander kicked me hard in the abdomen.

I fell to the ground, clutching my aching stomach.

The pain was so intense I could barely breathe.

Alexander looked down at me from above.

His gaze was as cold and sharp as a blade.

"Tell me where Noah is. Right now."

"Otherwise, I will make you wish you were dead."

I struggled to speak through the pain.

"I told you, the kidnappers took Noah."

"You should be demanding answers from them, not me."

Alexander let out a series of cold laughs.

He turned and ordered his assistant.

"Isabella's brother has gone abroad. Investigate it. Now."

Soon, a stack of photos was delivered to Alexander.

They showed my brother and Liam from behind at the airport.

Because my brother's influence lies overseas, he is always protected by top-tier bodyguards.

These photos only dared to capture their backs from a distance.

Seeing Liam's familiar figure, my heart ached unbearably.

At that moment, I felt immensely relieved that it wasn't Liam who had been kidnapped.

I pointed at Liam's back in the photo.

"Alexander, look carefully."

"This outfit was custom-made for Liam's birthday last year by you."

"It's one of a kind in the entire world."

"The one with my brother is Liam, not Noah."

Alexander's hand holding the photos trembled slightly.

A flicker of panic passed through his eyes.

Scarlett suddenly snatched the photos away.

She spoke with absolute certainty.

"Alexander, don't believe her."

"The height and build are identical to Noah's."

"This is our Noah."

"Believe me, the kidnappers won't harm Noah."

Watching Scarlett's confident demeanor, a ridiculous thought formed in my mind.

Alexander's furrowed brow gradually relaxed.

He lifted his foot and stomped hard on the back of my hand.

The sound of cracking bones mixed with my agonized scream.

Driven mad by the pain, my eyes turned bloodshot.

I sank my teeth into Alexander's leg.

Alexander cried out in pain and let go.

He looked down at me with a vicious smile.

His voice was icy and cruel.

"Stop pretending."

"I know your brother has the means to take Noah quietly."

"But understand this clearly. Your backing isn't in the country right now."

"If you don't have him return Noah immediately, you will join your Liam."

I fought back tears, about to speak.

A bodyguard brought over a box reeking of blood.

"Mr. Roscente, this was sent by the kidnappers."

The box was opened.

Inside was clearly a child's arm.

There was also a threat letter from the kidnappers.

They claimed this was the first "installment."

If the money wasn't paid soon, the next would be fatal.

I stared fixedly at Alexander, shouting loudly.

"Alexander, if you're a real man, have Scarlett take a paternity test with this arm!"

"See if I'm telling the truth!"

Alexander, indeed provoked, immediately called for a doctor.

"Alexander." Scarlett pouted and clung to his arm, whining.

"Don't fall for her trick."

"A paternity test takes time."

"She's definitely stalling, waiting for her brother to come back and save her."

Hearing this, a ruthless glint flashed in Alexander's eyes.

Violence churned in his gaze.

His voice was laced with venomous coldness.

"It seems you won't yield until faced with disaster."

"In that case, don't blame me for being merciless."
###Chapter 4

Alexander's men dragged me roughly toward the wolf cage.

Several starving wild wolves were trapped inside the iron enclosure.

Their green eyes glowed with menace in the darkness.

A bloody small arm hung from the cage bars.

The wolves growled excitedly, pawing at the enclosure.

Scarlett nestled in Alexander's embrace, wearing a mask of false pity.

"Sister, I advise you to tell your brother to return Noah immediately."

"If you hesitate any longer, this arm will be fed to the wolves."

She added with feigned consideration, "I'll give you ten more minutes to think if you kneel and apologize."

Alexander dotingly tapped Scarlett's nose.

"You're always too soft-hearted."

I stared coldly at the arm, my voice utterly calm.

"You two are truly made for each other. Even your blindness matches perfectly."

"Look closely. There's an oval-shaped birthmark on that arm. Liam never had such a mark."

Scarlett's expression shifted slightly as she hurried forward for a closer look.

She then scoffed dismissively. "That's not a birthmark, just bloodstains."

"Sister, are you hallucinating from grief?"

Alexander gently fed Scarlett a grape while issuing a cold command.

"Throw it in."

The starving wolves instantly pounced on the arm, their tearing sounds horrifying.

Alexander watched my expression intently.

Seeing no reaction from me, he lit a cigarette irritably.

"Has she truly gone mad?" he muttered to himself.

Alexander waved his hand again, and suddenly a large group of reporters swarmed in.

Scarlett gave me a triumphant smile.

"Sister, I specially invited the media to help. This way Liam can be rescued faster."

"Even though you orchestrated Noah's kidnapping through your brother, I won't hold it against you."

I couldn't help but laugh coldly.

Everyone knew media exposure would only anger kidnappers and endanger the hostage.

Despite everything, a mother's instinct made my heart ache for that innocent child.

Tears welled in my eyes as I sighed softly.

"Do you have to be this ruthless?"

Scarlett leaned close to my ear, whispering words only I could hear.

"Even if you don't produce Noah, your son is doomed."

"Who told him to stand in my son's way?"

"Even if he survives this time, there will be another opportunity."

"Let's see how long your son's luck holds out, sister."

I finally lost control and slapped her across the face.

Scarlett took the opportunity to fall heavily to the ground, immediately bursting into theatrical tears.

Alexander flew into a rage, his chest heaving violently.

He strode forward and scooped Scarlett up, announcing to all media present.

"After investigation, Liam's kidnapping was entirely orchestrated by Isabella herself."

"Therefore I will not rescue him, and I sever all paternal ties effective immediately."

"My lawyers have prepared the documents. We can sign and execute them now."

The media frantically captured my devastated appearance.

Bystanders surged forward, hurling the vilest accusations at me.

Someone roughly forced me down, making me press my fingerprint onto the termination document.

I struggled free and gazed calmly at Alexander for a long moment.

Finally I bit my finger and pressed a bloodied fingerprint onto the paper.

My words came clear and measured. "Alexander Roscente, from this day forward Liam shares no connection with you."

Alexander smiled with satisfaction, kissing Scarlett tenderly.

"My entire fortune will belong to Noah now, my dear."

"I've finally kept my promise to you."

Just as they basked in their triumph, a team of bodyguards suddenly stormed in to clear the area.

Liam's anxious voice rang out from behind me.

"Don't be afraid, Mommy! Uncle and I are here to save you!"
###Chapter 5

Liam came running toward me.

His small figure crashed into my line of sight.

I could no longer control the overwhelming emotions.

Tears instantly blurred my vision.

Liam threw himself into my arms.

His small hands frantically wiped my cheeks.

"Don't cry, Mommy. It's all my fault."

"Liam shouldn't have made you worry."

My brother stood beside me.

His gaze sharp as a blade swept toward the couple.

"You dare bully my sister when I'm not around."

"Alexander Roscente, you must have a death wish."

Alexander didn't hear my brother's words at all.

He stared fixedly at Liam.

His lips trembled, unable to speak.

"Liam is here... then who was tied up?"

"Could it really have been Noah?"

He swayed unsteadily.

He collapsed heavily onto the ground.

Scarlett remained unusually calm.

Her cold eyes lingered on Liam.

She forced a stiff smile.

"What a relief. Liam returned safely."

"But you should be more careful next time, sister. You might not be so lucky."

I caught the unwillingness in her tone.

"Miss Scarlett doesn't seem worried at all."

"Aren't you concerned about Noah being in the kidnappers' hands?"

Scarlett blurted out.

"Of course not. My Noah could never be with those kidnappers."

My brother keenly awared of abnormalities, his brows slightly furrowed.

I quietly gave him a look.

A bodyguard hurried over holding a box.

"Mr. Roscente, the kidnappers sent a second..."

Alexander's mood soothed just now collapsed again.

He reached out a trembling hand to open the box.

But Scarlett rushed over suddenly.

She grabbed the box and threw it violently into the wolf cage.

"Alexander, don't fall for it!"

"I promise that's not Noah!"

The box shattered inside the cage.

A head rolled out.

Alexander let out a piercing wail.

"Noah! That's my Noah!"

Scarlett's legs gave way.

She barely managed to steady herself.

She dug her nails into her palm, muttering to herself.

"It's not Noah... It definitely isn't..."

She suddenly lunged at me like a madwoman.

She grabbed my collar.

"This is your doing! You found a fake head to trick us!"

I looked down at her coldly.

I lifted my foot and kicked her away.

This time, Scarlett fell solidly to the ground.

Her face turned pale.

Alexander hurriedly protected her.

He looked up at me angrily.

"Scarlett is just too upset! Why did you have to be so harsh!"

I let out a cold laugh.

"Is it that you don't want to believe it, or because she planned all this?"

"You'll find out soon."

Sirens approached from a distance.

Police officers rushed in.

They directly handcuffed Scarlett.

"Scarlett Roscente, you are suspected of masterminding a kidnapping. Please cooperate with the investigation."

"The kidnappers have confessed and identified you as the mastermind."

My brother gently patted my shoulder.

He whispered in my ear.

"Isabella, those who hurt you won't get away with it."
###Chapter 6

The crowd slowly dispersed.

Alexander Roscente collapsed to the ground, completely drained.

Rage choked his chest, but he had no outlet for it.

He wanted to blame Isabella Roscente.

But upon careful recollection, she had repeatedly warned him that Noah was the one kidnapped.

Why hadn't he believed her then?

It was all Scarlett's fault. She was the one who insisted it wasn't Noah.

He never imagined she was the mastermind behind the kidnapping.

Alexander's eyes burned red. He slammed his fists into the ground.

He roared until his hands were a bloody, mangled mess.

Finally, he couldn't hold on any longer. He coughed up blood and fell into complete unconsciousness.

When he woke again, he was in a hospital bed.

Voices from outside reached him—a doctor and his assistant.

"Mr. Roscente's health has been declining these past few years. First, he lost his fertility. Now this is the final blow. The shock is too great. Recovery will be difficult."

A loud crash echoed.

Alexander had fallen from the bed.

He ripped out his IV line and stormed out, grabbing the doctor by the collar.

"What nonsense are you spouting!" Alexander screamed wildly. "How can I be infertile? It's that bitch Isabella who couldn't have children!"

Because Scarlett had recklessly called the media, everything that happened today had spread throughout the city.

The doctor looked at him with contempt.

"That was Ms. Isabella protecting you. She was afraid the news would affect the Roscente Group's stock price."

"She went to great lengths to keep it hidden all these years."

Alexander raised his hand.

But in the end, he slapped his own face with brutal force.

Regret and guilt gnawed at him like ten thousand ants.

The pain made his heart convulse.

He couldn't face staying in the hospital. He stumbled home in a daze.

Pushing the door open, he called out softly out of habit.

"Isabella, Liam, I'm home."

Only silence answered him.

Alexander stood alone in the darkness, his back gradually stooping.

It felt as if a thousand-pound weight crushed him.

He could barely breathe.

With red-rimmed eyes, he looked around the warm home.

This was the place he and Isabella had shared for over a decade.

At some point, he had started wanting to come home less and less.

Scarlett had a young body and their love child.

He began to despise Isabella and Liam.

He even wished they would disappear.

But now, he was the one who had lost everything.

Alexander found all the alcohol in the house.

He drank himself into a stupor, ignoring everything.

Until his assistant sought him out with a grave expression.

"Ms. Scarlett met with a lawyer in prison. She's terrified. She had a mental breakdown and confessed to many things."

"Including that she arranged the kidnapping."

"And..." The assistant paused, gathering courage. "She admitted to poisoning your food and drinks all these years. She wanted to destroy your health completely. To ensure you lost your fertility. So Noah would be your only heir."

Crack!

Alexander crushed the glass in his hand.

The assistant stood by, not daring to breathe.

But Alexander didn't erupt. He just looked at his assistant coldly.

"Find the best lawyer. Money is no object. Follow my orders exactly. Get Scarlett out."

He spoke her name now.

His voice dripping with nothing but pure, bone-deep hatred.
###Chapter 7

I spent three full days wrapping up all my domestic affairs.

The immigration paperwork was now underway.

Liam had been exceptionally well-behaved these past few days.

But he often hung his little head low in silence.

I knew these events had left deep scars on his heart.

I gently pulled him into my arms.

"Liam, don't you want to go with Mommy?"

He shook his head.

"I do."

"Wherever Mommy goes, Liam goes too."

His words made my heart ache.

"Then why are you so sad? Is it because of Alexander Roscente?"

Since signing the parental rights termination contract, he no longer deserved to be called Liam's father.

Liam opened his mouth to speak.

A staff member approached with two documents.

"Please sign after verification. Once approved, the immigration process can begin."

I patted Liam's head and asked him to sign first.

Just as he picked up the pen.

A figure rushed over, snatched the documents, and tore them to shreds.

"Isabella Roscente!" Alexander's eyes were bloodshot. "You're taking my child to immigrate? Did you ask me?"

"I forbid it! Do you hear me!"

I watched his outburst with cold indifference.

He looked completely different after just a few days.

The once confident CEO now had disheveled hair and a scruffy beard.

His suit was wrinkled and carried a sour smell.

"Barking?" I sneered. "The divorce agreement is signed. The parental termination is signed."

"We have nothing to do with you anymore."

"Have you lost your mind, Mr. Roscente? Don't you remember any of this?"

"You prepared the termination papers yourself."

"Didn't you say you wanted Liam out so Noah could inherit everything?"

I feigned surprise, covering my mouth.

"Oh, I forgot. Noah can't inherit anything now."

Alexander trembled violently.

I thought he might become physical and prepared to call security.

Instead, he dropped to his knees before me.

"Isabella."

His voice choked with tears.

"I was wrong. I truly know I was wrong."

"Please give me another chance."

"Scarlett deceived me. I was blinded."

"All these years, only you and Liam truly cared for me."

"How can you bear to leave me alone?"

It was the first time I had seen Alexander cry so pitifully.

Yet I felt nothing but cold amusement.

Suppressing my anger, I spoke softly to Liam.

"Liam, go wait outside for Mommy."

As Liam passed Alexander.

He suddenly lunged and grabbed the child.

"Liam, don't go! Look at your father!"

Liam struggled in terror.

Seeing he couldn't break free.

His small face darkened.

He suddenly shouted.

"Uncle! Hurry! Chase this madman away!"
###Chapter 8

Alexander was beaten back relentlessly.

Yet he stubbornly turned his head to look at Liam.

My brother laughed heartily and scooped Liam up.

"You're truly a Qiao through and through. As decisive as your mother was back in the day."

"I just hope you don't end up as unlucky as her when you grow up, meeting such scum."

I shot my brother an annoyed look.

I reached out and took Liam into my arms.

Liam buried his little face in my shoulder.

A warm wetness soon seeped through my clothes.

My heart clenched.

I gently patted his back.

"Liam, Mommy knows it's cruel to make you face a father like that."

"It's Mommy's fault for not protecting you better."

But Liam shook his head forcefully, his voice muffled.

"Mommy, it's not your fault."

"I'm the one who's sorry."

"Mommy stayed with someone like this for so long because of me."

He hurriedly wiped his tears away.

His clear, bright eyes held a determined glint.

"Don't worry, Mommy. Liam will definitely protect you from now on."

I couldn't help but chuckle at his words.

I lovingly booped his little nose.

"Okay."

Alexander still refused to give up.

The immigration paperwork would take some time.

He somehow found out mine and Liam's address.

Though there were bodyguards stationed around, arranged by my brother, he didn't dare approach.

But a shadowy figure constantly loitering at the entrance was really affecting my mood.

Alexander finally couldn't hold back.

He paid a hefty sum to bribe a security guard into passing me a message.

He said he wasn't here to cause trouble this time.

He just wanted to discuss the asset division.

I pondered for a moment and eventually agreed.

I thought Alexander was just using it as an excuse to see me.

But upon arriving at the Roscente Group, he immediately pushed the company seal toward me.

He had become gaunt, with dark circles under his eyes.

These days spent stalking me and Liam had left him looking like a homeless man.

Seeing he seemed sincere, I frowned.

"Alexander, are you dying?"

"Trying to do some good deeds before you go?"

Alexander didn't get angry at my harsh words.

He just slumped wearily back into his chair.

He forced a pale smile and suddenly pointed at a painting on the wall.

"Isabella, do you remember that?"

I followed his gaze. The painting was covered in a layer of dust.

It was a crude crayon drawing of two adults holding a child's hand, with a house, trees, and a sun beside them.

It was from when Liam was two years old, during a trip our family took to the park.

Back then, Alexander and I were still on good terms. Having Liam made everything sweeter.

Liam had always been clever.

He huffed and puffed to draw this painting and insisted it be hung in Alexander's office.

He said with childish earnestness that it was a family portrait, so Daddy would think of us while working overtime.

The memory tugged at my heartstrings, and I felt a slight stir.

But that was all.

Under Alexander's hopeful gaze, I walked forward and took the painting down.

I used both hands and tore it in half.

One half showed Liam and me holding hands under the sun.

The other half was Alexander's lonely figure.

Alexander shot to his feet, his voice trembling.

"Why, Isabella? Won't you even leave me this last keepsake?"

I carefully tucked away the half with Liam and me.

I let out a cold laugh.

"Alexander, let me ask you one thing."

"If it was Liam who was kidnapped, while you, Scarlett, and your Noah were safe and sound."

"Would you still have thought of us then?"

Alexander was immediately speechless.

All color drained from his face.

Finally, he bowed his head in defeat.

After a long while, he only managed to squeeze out one sentence.

"I'm sorry."
###Chapter 9

I have read too many stories about chasing an ex-wife through a fiery hell.

Those male leads always weep bitterly after hurting the female lead.

Their kneeling and begging may seem deeply emotional.

But it is utterly hypocritical.

They never truly feel regret.

They only fear losing their acquired benefits and comfortable lives.

Alexander Roscente is the epitome of this.

He quickly caught up and blocked my path.

His eyes were red as he looked at me.

His lips trembled for a long time before he managed to speak.

"I have to leave."

"Scarlett's situation can no longer be hidden. The police are onto her."

"I must take her abroad to seek refuge."

I couldn't even be bothered to lift my eyelids.

I picked up the company seal and walked straight toward the door.

Leaving behind only an icy blessing.

"May you two stay locked together forever. Never return."

As I passed his car.

A violent banging sound suddenly came from inside.

I instinctively glanced over.

Scarlett was gagged and trapped in the back seat.

She had been beaten beyond recognition.

Her eyes were swollen to mere slits.

Her fingers twisted at unnatural angles.

She desperately slammed her head against the window.

Her gaze fixed on me was complex and indecipherable.

I couldn't tell if it was hatred or a plea for help.

But none of this had anything to do with me.

Everyone must pay the price for their choices.

I quickened my pace to leave this troubled place.

Alexander left all his assets to me.

I quickly liquidated that enormous fortune.

I took Liam and started a new life overseas.

Our days were peaceful and warm.

Liam grew healthier day by day.

The shadows of the past gradually faded.

Until one day my brother brought news.

"Scarlett fled back to the country and was arrested on the spot."

"I heard she was so excited to see the police that she kowtowed repeatedly."

I raised an eyebrow with interest.

My brother continued sharing the details he had gathered.

"Turns out Alexander never intended to let her go after bailing her out."

"He tormented Scarlett in every way possible this past year."

"Recently, he even forced her to have a child."

"His mental state has been deteriorating."

"He often mistakes random children on the street for Liam."

"When drunk, he threatens to take Liam back."

"But don't worry, he would never dare come to my turf."

This outcome was exactly what I had expected.

Alexander is a vile person to the core.

News about him trickled in sporadically later.

He was globally wanted for abusing Scarlett.

Forced to wander in exile, too afraid to return.

He even had to void his identity and become stateless.

Many years later, on a certain afternoon.

I suddenly received an international call.

A vicious threat came from the other end.

"Are you Alexander Roscente's family?"

"He says you're his wife and loaded with cash."

"Prepare ten million dollars in ransom, or we'll kill him."

I calmly replied, "Okay."

After hanging up, I transferred 250 dollars to the provided account.

Adding a note: Payment in installments. Please return him in installments as well.

[The End]
