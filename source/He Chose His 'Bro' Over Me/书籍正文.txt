###Chapter 1

The air at the party was stifling.

The music blared deafeningly.

My chest tightened, and my breathing became labored.

My trembling fingers reached for the emergency inhaler in my pocket.

The medicine bottle felt unusually light.

I shook it, but there was no sound.

Adrian walked over with Zoey in his arms.

He casually said, "Zoey had a sore throat, so I let her use your inhaler."

I clenched the empty bottle, my fingertips turning white.

"That was my life-saving medication..."

Zoey nestled in his arms, her voice soft and sweet, "Don't be mad, sis. I just had a little dry cough."

I gasped for air, but it felt like someone was choking me.

"A dry throat... Couldn't you just drink water?"

Adrian looked impatient. "Throat lozenges could help too. Don't make a big deal out of it."

The flashing lights on his face made him look utterly cold.

I slid down the wall, sitting on the floor.

The phone screen blurred in my vision.

I struggled to type.

Every breath came with a wheeze.

"Mom, I'm having an asthma attack."

"Adrian gave my inhaler to someone else."
---------

Adrian glanced at his phone screen and let out a mocking laugh.

"Tattling again? Are you in elementary school?"

He snatched my phone and held it high above me, looking down with a smirk.

I struggled to get up and grab it back.

Suddenly, my vision blurred, and I collapsed back onto the couch.

"My asthma... help me..." I managed to choke out the words.

Zoey sauntered over, waving an inhaler with a sly smile.

"Oh, our dear Princess Evelyn is feeling unwell? Or is this just an act?"

"That's why we shouldn't bring girls to these gatherings. Always causing drama with their jealousy."

I gasped for air, glaring at Zoey.

She was Adrian's childhood "best buddy."

Always hanging out with the guys, acting like one of them.

Adrian often praised her in front of me, calling her straightforward and bold.

A real tomboy, he said.

When we first started dating, I thought she was interesting.

But then Adrian introduced me to his circle of friends.

Zoey always seemed enthusiastic on the surface.

"Adrian has good taste! Where did you find this princess?"

"Let's stick together, girl! We'll have fun and ignore these smelly men."

But her gaze always carried a sharp edge.

She was cunning.

She talked about sisterhood but subtly excluded me at every turn.

At every gathering, she would bring up childhood memories.

I couldn't join the conversation, so I just sat quietly in the corner.

Then she would dramatically throw an arm around Adrian's shoulder.

"Why so quiet, Princess? Are you jealous?"

I had told Adrian many times how uncomfortable I felt.

But he always brushed it off, saying I was overreacting.

He said Zoey was just being her straightforward self.

But now, Zoey didn't even bother pretending.

"Princesses are so delicate. Are you upset because we're not paying attention to you?"

The men burst into laughter.

"Give me the inhaler... I can't breathe..." My voice trembled.

The room fell silent for a moment.

Then erupted into even louder laughter.

Zoey clung to Adrian, laughing until tears streamed down her face.

"Great acting! Adrian, don't fall for it!"

The others joined in.

"Adrian, you're not scared of your girl, are you?"

"Man, you're embarrassing us! You need to put her in her place!"

Adrian's face turned red.

He deliberately avoided looking at me, raising his voice.

"Who cares about her? She needs to learn a lesson!"

The suffocation grew worse.

I desperately grabbed Adrian's sleeve, my throat making hoarse, guttural sounds.

"Help... me..."

Adrian seemed to waver.

Zoey quickly cut in.

"Enough, Evelyn. No one's buying your act."

I tried to crawl toward the door.

But Zoey shoved me back onto the couch.

"The gathering isn't over yet. Are you really going to ruin it?"

She pushed me hard.

The back of my head slammed against the wall.

A dull thud echoed, and stars danced before my eyes.

Before I could recover, Zoey suddenly screamed.
###Chapter 2

Zoey dramatically covered her mouth with her hand.

"Oh my God, you're so manipulative."

"I didn't even touch you, and you threw yourself against the wall."

Adrian's gaze towards me grew colder.

"Evelyn, haven't you caused enough trouble?"

I bit my lip hard, trying to stay conscious.

"I have severe asthma. If you don't stop, it could be fatal."

My throat felt like it was being sliced by razor blades, each breath tinged with the taste of blood.

Zoey deliberately waved the inhaler in front of my eyes.

She took a deep breath right in front of me.

"Ah, so refreshing. Too bad I can't share it with you."

"Expensive things really do work better."

I struggled to reach for it.

She effortlessly held it above her head.

"Want it? Beg me."

My vision blurred, and cold sweat soaked through my back.

Adrian watched coldly.

"Zoey just wants to use it. Don't be so stingy."

"We've all seen your medical report. You don't even have asthma."

I clung to the last shred of my rationality.

"Adrian, you've seen me have an attack before."

Zoey suddenly interjected.

"Faking illness for sympathy, huh? Isn't that the trend these days?"

"Don't tell me you have depression too?"

Laughter instantly filled the private room.

Someone whistled and egged them on.

"Adrian, this girl is too much."

"Zoey's more your type, so much more generous."

I mustered all my strength and lunged at Zoey.

Just as my fingertips were about to touch the inhaler, she suddenly stepped back.

I crashed heavily onto the carpet.

"Such a convincing performance," Zoey feigned surprise.

She bent down and whispered in my ear, her voice so soft only I could hear.

"Just die already. It'll make room for me."

When she stood up, her tone shifted to concern.

"Stop messing around. Everyone's waiting for the toast."

Adrian finally noticed something was wrong.

He knelt down and held me.

"What's really going on with you?"

"Help me..."

I clutched his wrist desperately, my voice barely audible.

"Medicine..."

Adrian's brow furrowed, a flicker of panic in his eyes.

He looked at Zoey, "Give her the inhaler first."

Zoey's expression changed instantly.

She hid it behind her back, stomping her foot coquettishly.

"Adrian, are you crazy? Don't you remember how she played you before?"

She suddenly turned to the others and shouted.

"See? The pity card works wonders."

Several men immediately chimed in.

"Zoey's been our friend for years. She wouldn't lie to you."

"These delicate types just need to be put in their place."

Adrian's grip loosened slightly.

I could feel his hesitation.

Excruciating pain tore through my chest, and my consciousness began to fade.

"But she really does look terrible..."
###Chapter 3

Adrian frowned deeply, his gaze lingering on my pale lips.

Zoey suddenly slapped her forehead, letting out an exasperated gasp.

"I just saw her take a sanitary pad to the restroom. It must be menstrual cramps."

She put on a concerned expression, but her voice carried a subtle hint of amusement.

"Evelyn, if it's cramps, just say so. Why pretend to have an asthma attack? You really scared Adrian."

Adrian's tense shoulders immediately relaxed.

His eyes now only held dissatisfaction as he looked at me.

"That kind of joke is too much. I really thought something was wrong with you."

I weakly leaned back on the sofa, every breath accompanied by a sharp pain.

Thankfully, I had taken preventive medication before leaving home.

Otherwise, with their delay, I would have been dead by now.

Zoey hid behind Adrian, flashing me a triumphant smile.

She pulled out a small bottle from her bag.

"Here, these are throat lozenges. Didn't you say your throat was bothering you?"

She forced the lozenge into my mouth.

The intense mint flavor exploded instantly, and my throat felt like it was being cut by a knife.

I wanted to spit it out.

But she firmly held my chin.

"Swallow it. Why aren't you eating it? You're just pretending to be sick."

Only when I gagged and spat out the lozenge did she let go, turning to Adrian.

"See, she didn't want to eat it. She's just acting."

Adrian looked at the lozenge on the floor, then at me.

The last bit of concern vanished, replaced entirely by annoyance.

He thought I was being unreasonable.

He shoved me back into the sofa.

My back hit the hard wooden armrest, and the pain made my vision blur.

"Enough, stop this."

"No, I..."

I tried to explain, but only broken gasps came out.

Zoey affectionately patted Adrian's shoulder.

"Let's go get a drink. Don't mind her."

Adrian nodded.

Before leaving, he glanced at me one last time.

His eyes held only impatience, not a trace of concern.

He was pulled into the crowd by Zoey, throwing a final remark.

"Behave. Don't embarrass me."

The onlookers laughed and dispersed, continuing to drink and joke.

I curled up in the corner, watching Adrian and Zoey being urged to do a toast with linked arms.

"Linked arms! Linked arms!"

"Don't be a spoilsport, Adrian."

"It's just for fun. Your girlfriend won't mind, right?"

In my blurred vision, I saw Adrian glance at me.

Then he wrapped his arm around Zoey's waist and kissed her...

The air in my lungs seemed to vanish.

I truly couldn't breathe.

My phone was thrown on the floor by Adrian.

But I didn't even have the strength to reach for it.

In despair, I suddenly remembered the emergency pill I had placed in my bag last month.

With the last of my strength, I fumbled around.

The moment my fingers touched the chain, my heart almost leaped out of my chest.

I desperately tugged at the bag strap, the leather making a faint sound.

The bag opened.

I tipped over.

A white pill rolled onto the carpet.

That's it!

Though it was just a slow-release pill.

Not as immediate as an inhaler, but it could buy me some time.

I was almost in tears.

But just as my fingertips were about to touch the pill—

A high heel stepped on it.
###Chapter 4

The high heels crushed the pills.
Again and again.
Grinding them into powder.

Zoey stood in front of me.
A cold smile curled at the corners of her lips.

"Oops, I almost let you take the medicine," she said, deliberately drawing out her words.
Her toes kept twisting.

My blood rushed to my head.
"Get away! I'll kill you! My mother won't let you get away with this!"
A suffocating feeling surged over me.
After shouting, I collapsed back onto the sofa.
Like a fish out of water.

"Teehee, it's so amusing to see you helplessly raging," Zoey crouched down.
Her long nails grazed my cheek.
"You deserve this. Who told you to steal what's mine? Adrian is mine. Even if I don't want him, it's not your turn."
She suddenly grabbed my hair.
"Alright, you can die now."

A tearing pain shot through my scalp.
I wanted to fight back.
But I couldn't even lift a finger.

"I'm from the Ashcroft—"
In my blurred vision, Zoey's face twisted.
She cut me off.
"Adrian is over there drinking," she leaned close to my ear, her breath cold.
"Do you think he has time to care about you? If you died right now, do you think he'd be sad?"

I tried to bite her.
But she easily dodged.
She stood up, gently patted my face.
Then she called out to the distance.
"Adrian, come quick! Evelyn seems to be in bad shape!"

Adrian walked over with a frown.
He looked at my limp body, his expression grim.
"What's the fuss this time? Just period cramps, don't act like you're dying. Every woman gets them."
"I... I have asthma..." I gasped weakly.
Adrian glanced at my pale face, then at Zoey.
Zoey innocently spread her hands.
Adrian looked disappointed.
"Evelyn, I've had enough of you. If this continues, we're breaking up."
He turned and walked away.
Zoey trotted after him, turning back to give me a victory sign.

My lungs felt like a broken bellows.
Every breath carried a metallic taste.
The spots of light in my vision grew denser.
Zoey swayed in the light, like a demon.

Laughter echoed from the other side.
Adrian and his friends were toasting and drinking.
Zoey pretended to be drunk, leaning into Adrian's arms.
He didn't push her away, instead tightening his grip around her waist.

"Adrian..." I called out with my last strength.
My voice was barely a whisper.
He suddenly turned.
Zoey immediately whispered in his ear.
He frowned, shaking his head impatiently.

The last glimmer of hope was extinguished.
I slowly closed my eyes.
Regret flooded over me.
Why did I ever get together with Adrian?
He was just a poor student.
While my mother was a billionaire.
To protect his pride, I had always hidden my family background.
He always thought I was just slightly better off.

Zoey came back again.
She crouched in front of me.
"I heard you're from a single-parent household? If you die, your mother would cry herself to death, right?"
"But it's okay, Adrian will handle the funeral as your husband. Your mother might soften and give him the family fortune..."
Zoey was still dreaming.
Before she could finish, the private room door suddenly swung open.
"Evelyn!" My mother's voice echoed through the room.
###Chapter 5

"Evelyn!"

Darkness completely engulfed my vision.

I don't know how long it took before I finally managed to open my eyes.

A warm hand immediately grasped mine.

Only then did I realize I was still alive.

"Evelyn, you're awake? Are you feeling any discomfort?"

Mother's voice was hoarse, her eyes red and swollen.

I wanted to tell her I was fine.

But my throat was so dry I couldn't make a sound.

Mother's tears fell on my face.

"The doctor said if you had been ten minutes later..."

She choked up, unable to continue.

I opened my mouth, my throat burning with pain.

I barely managed to squeeze out a faint whisper.

"Mom..."

"I'm here."

She forced a smile.

"You were severely asphyxiated, almost didn't make it. Thankfully I arrived in time..."

Seeing the new streaks of white in mother's hair, my eyes welled up.

I always said I was grown up, didn't want to be controlled too much.

Yet I still made mother worry about me.

"I'm sorry..." I couldn't stop the tears.

"Silly child, no need to apologize."

Mother gently wiped away my tears, her expression suddenly turning cold. "The one who should apologize was never you."

The doctor came in to check on me.

Said my blood oxygen levels had stabilized, I could be moved to a regular ward in a few days.

After the doctor left, mother's expression turned serious.

Her tone was calm but carried an undeniable force.

"I won't let them get away with this."

I was stunned.

Mother took out her phone and played a surveillance video.

It was footage from the private room.

Clearly recording Adrian and Zoey's actions.

Zoey snatched my emergency inhaler, stomping on the medication with a sneer;

Adrian prevented me from saving myself, watching coldly;

And the jeering from those men...

Every detail was captured clearly.

Mother put away her phone.

"Don't worry, I've hired the best lawyer. Zoey's actions constitute attempted murder, the police have filed a case."

"She will face the harshest punishment."

My fingers trembled slightly under the blanket.

"What about Adrian and the others..." I asked softly.

Mother's expression darkened further.

"Don't worry, those people won't escape either. They prevented you from saving yourself, even if they were deceived they still bear legal responsibility."

I nodded, finally feeling at ease.

I had been worried they might escape punishment by claiming ignorance.

I fell asleep again.

When I woke up in the evening, I idly browsed social media.

Saw the posts from Adrian's so-called "bros."

On the day of the incident they were still posting "Adrian's a real man," "Princess is such a good actress..."

All those posts were now deleted.

Some accounts had even been deactivated.

The next day there was a knock on the hospital room door.

The police came to take my statement.

I briefly explained what had happened.

"Officer, no matter what they say, I won't be issuing any letter of forgiveness."

"Understood."

The officer gave some instructions and left.

Soon after, my phone rang. It was Adrian calling.

I didn't want to answer.

But I was curious how he would plead.

To my surprise, Adrian's attitude was still haughty.

"Evelyn, what's your problem? You're fine, why call the police?"

"Do you know your mother brought the police here? Zoey was terrified, she's still being investigated at the station!"
###Chapter 6

Adrian once again shattered my understanding of human nature.

When the call connected, my voice was hoarse.
"Adrian, I almost died in that private room."

Silence fell on the other end.
After a long pause, he hesitantly spoke.
"Evelyn... none of us knew you had asthma."
"Zoey said she saw your medical report..."
"She might have... made a mistake."

Even now, he was still making excuses for Zoey.
I couldn't help but let out a cold laugh.
"Do you even believe that excuse yourself?"

My voice was weak but clear.
"She likes you, that's why she targeted me. Can't you see that?"

Adrian stammered, unable to form a proper response.
After a while, he managed to squeeze out a sentence.
"It might be a misunderstanding... but she definitely didn't mean it."
"Evelyn, we're all friends, let's just drop it."
"Zoey is still young, a criminal record would ruin her life."

Friends?
I was never friends with them.
I laughed out loud.

Adrian's tone turned helpless.
"Don't be so aggressive."
"I was just caught up in the moment, I wasn't thinking clearly."
"I wanted to help you, but you wouldn't cooperate..."

The absurdity made me laugh uncontrollably.
The victim became the one at fault?
Some people will always shift the blame onto others.

"Adrian."
My voice was unusually calm.
"We're done."
"Remember, I won't let Zoey off, nor any of her accomplices."

With that, I hung up.
I immediately blocked his number.

Sunlight streamed through the window, warming my body.
The warmth dispelled the gloom in my heart.

Mom pushed the door open.
Seeing my expression, she sighed in relief.
"It's good that you've moved on. I was afraid you'd still be hung up on that scumbag."

"I only hate him."
I threw myself into Mom's arms, acting spoiled.

Mom gently stroked my hair.
"My daughter has finally grown up."

Seeing the love in Mom's eyes, I nodded firmly.

I thought I had seen the true colors of the Lowell family.
But I never expected to see that figure at the hospital a week later.

A thin, dark-skinned middle-aged woman barged into the garden.
The security guard looked apologetic.
"Miss Ashcroft, I'm sorry. She said she has a heart condition, we didn't dare stop her."

Bodyguards immediately stepped forward to block her.
The woman shouted at me over the human wall.
"Evelyn Ashcroft, I'm your mother-in-law!"

I was stunned.
I just graduated, how could I have a mother-in-law?

Looking closely, her face bore a striking resemblance to Adrian.
I narrowed my eyes.

The woman complained loudly.
"Is this how you treat your mother-in-law on your first meeting?"

The bodyguards didn't budge.
Seeing she couldn't get closer, Mrs. Lowell sat down on the ground.
She slapped her thighs and wailed.
"What a tragedy, my life is so bitter!"
"I worked so hard to raise my son, and this is how my future daughter-in-law treats me!"

People around us started to look.
I was trembling with anger.

"Auntie, please don't talk nonsense. I'm not married."
"Isn't it just a matter of time? My son said he's going to marry you."

I gave her a cold glance.
###Chapter 7

Talking to such people is a complete waste of breath.

The Lowells are all insane.

I turned to leave.

Mrs. Lowell suddenly scrambled up from the floor.

"Who said you could leave? I'm not done talking!"

She lunged at me, but the bodyguard shoved her away.

That push ignited her dramatic side.

Her wails were deafening.

"How dare you bully me behind Adrian's back! Just wait until he gets here!"

"Adrian? He's currently enjoying tea at the police station."

I turned back with a cold smile.

Mrs. Lowell's face turned ashen.

She pointed at me with a twisted expression, tears and snot smeared across her face.

"You witch! Release my son immediately!"

"Who ever heard of a couple's quarrel ending up at the police station? It's unheard of!"

I crossed my arms, watching her performance.

Seeing my smile, she thought she had found my weakness.

Mrs. Lowell stood up, her greedy eyes scanning me.

"Adrian said your family is well-off. After marriage, all your money will be managed by me."

"Your mother's pension will also be transferred to my account."

"Spend less and stop being extravagant, or you'll never be accepted into the Lowell family."

Even the bodyguards looked disgusted by her words.

I had no patience to listen further and gave a slight wave.

The bodyguards immediately stepped forward to drag her away.

Mrs. Lowell was still screaming.

"Evelyn Ashcroft, you'll die a horrible death! How dare you treat your mother-in-law like this..."

One of the bodyguards chuckled.

"Our young lady is the sole heir of the Ashcroft Group. You think you're worthy of being her mother-in-law?"

"The Ashcroft Group? What's that?"

Mrs. Lowell froze.

The bodyguard pointed to the massive electronic billboard outside.

"See that? Top Ten Outstanding Entrepreneurs—Vivienne Ashcroft."

The screen shone brightly with my mother's photo.

Mrs. Lowell's mouth hung open wide enough to fit an egg.

"V-Vivienne Ashcroft?"

Her face turned ghostly pale.

Finally, she realized I wasn't just "well-off" as Adrian had claimed.

The difference was like heaven and earth.

Mrs. Lowell tried to say something, but the bodyguards dragged her out.

Back in the hospital room.

My mother set down her documents and looked at me.

"What was all that noise outside?"

I briefly explained about Mrs. Lowell.

My mother gave a disdainful smile.

"Truly a family with rotten roots."

She took my hand.

"Don't waste your energy on such people. Focus on recovering. The trial is next month."

"If you don't want to see them..."

I interrupted her.

"No, I want to witness their downfall with my own eyes."

...

In the days leading up to the trial.

The families of those people tried every means to reach me.

But after Mrs. Lowell's scene, my mother increased security.

Not even a fly could get through.

Zoey Langley, with the most severe charges, was already in custody.

She repeatedly requested to meet.

I naturally ignored her.

Zoey's parents were incredibly arrogant, sending messages through mutual friends.

They claimed the judge was on their side.

They demanded I drop the charges.

They even boasted they could afford any consequences.

I responded with a smile.

"Tell them I'm ready for the fight."
###Chapter 8

The sky was overcast with a dull gray hue.

The courtroom was filled with a heavy, oppressive atmosphere.

I sat upright in the plaintiff's seat.

The Ashcroft Group's lawyer whispered to me, going over the final details.

Documents were neatly arranged on the table.

The bailiffs escorted the defendants into the room.

They all looked dejected and defeated.

Adrian's mother was nowhere to be seen.

After learning my identity, she had sold off her assets overnight.

She disappeared without a trace, taking the money with her.

Zoey's eyes were bloodshot.

Her hair was disheveled and dry.

She glared at me with venomous hatred.

"Evelyn Ashcroft, must you be so ruthless?" Her voice was hoarse.

She stood straight, but her shoulders trembled slightly.

Adrian kept his head down, unable to meet my gaze.

He flinched when the bailiff called his name, responding in a muffled voice.

The accomplices looked even more pitiful.

Their faces were pale with fear.

They were just ordinary kids from average families.

They had never experienced anything like this before.

Their fear was almost tangible.

"Your Honor, we really didn't know..."

"I can't go to jail, my parents would be devastated..."

"It was all Zoey's idea!"

The courtroom erupted into chaos.

The bailiffs sternly restored order.

Zoey suddenly became agitated.

She pointed at me and screamed.

"You stole Adrian from me! You forced me into this!"

Her shrill voice echoed through the courtroom.

I looked at her calmly, my expression unreadable.

Adrian finally looked up.

His eyes were pleading.

"Evelyn, please let Zoey go..."

"She just made a mistake..."

"Think about our past—"

I gently interrupted him.

"Our past?"

A mocking smile played on my lips.

"You almost let me die in that room."

Adrian's lips trembled, but he couldn't say a word.

My lawyer began his statement, his voice clear and composed.

"Zoey intentionally took the asthma inhaler."

"The other defendants stood by and did nothing."

"Adrian, as her boyfriend, bears significant responsibility."

Zoey finally began to tremble with fear.

Muffled sobs escaped from behind her hands.

Adrian stared at me intently, still hoping for my mercy.

The surveillance footage was played in court.

Zoey's lawyer tried to argue.

"It was just a joke..."

"The severity of the illness might have been exaggerated..."

Zoey shot me a defiant look.

My lawyer remained calm.

He presented a thick stack of medical records.

Each page was stamped with the hospital's official seal.

Clear diagnostic records.

Multiple emergency treatment reports.

The judge's expression grew increasingly grave.

My lawyer pressed on.

He brought up another piece of surveillance footage.

In the video, I was at a party, having fun.

In a moment of urgency, I tucked a ring into my bag.

Zoey sneaked closer.

She rummaged through my bag.

She had intended to destroy the ring.

But she accidentally found the medical records...

Her actions were clearly recorded.

Zoey's face turned deathly pale.
###Chapter 9

The video ended.

The courtroom fell into dead silence.

Even the noisy "brothers" shut their mouths.

Zoey's face turned pale.

Her lips trembled. "It's not like that... I didn't see..."

Adrian suddenly turned to look at me.

For the first time, guilt appeared in his eyes.

He finally realized that Zoey had known about my condition all along.

And he had almost become an accomplice in my death.

Adrian stared at Zoey with intense hatred.

He gritted his teeth. "Zoey, you've ruined me."

Zoey laughed and cried at the same time.

"What's wrong with loving you?"

Adrian looked at her as if she were a monster.

When the trial was adjourned, my mother walked in.

She wore a sharply tailored suit and sat beside me.

Her powerful aura froze the air.

A "brother" in the back row suddenly gasped.

He pointed at my mother, stammering.

"Isn't that... Vivienne Ashcroft? The one from the financial news..."

His voice was soft, but it reached everyone's ears.

Like a stone thrown into still water, it created ripples.

Adrian followed the direction and his pupils constricted.

"Evelyn, who is she to you?"

His voice trembled.

I didn't answer.

Zoey's breathing stopped.

She stared at my mother, her face drained of color.

"Vivienne Ashcroft... Evelyn Ashcroft..."

She repeated these two names.

Suddenly, she looked up at me, her eyes filled with shock.

"You're from the Ashcroft Group..."

They finally connected me to the Ashcroft family.

Zoey tried to rush at me like a madwoman but was restrained by the bailiff.

"Impossible... She was just an ordinary girl..."

She never imagined that the girl she had schemed against was the heiress of the Ashcroft Group.

The "brothers" in the back row fell completely silent.

Some covered their mouths and cried.

Some looked ashen-faced.

They finally realized they had messed with the wrong person.

Only the judge's voice echoed in the courtroom.

I looked at them, feeling no joy, only a sense of melancholy.

The judge struck the gavel.

"Defendant Zoey Langley, attempted murder, with aggravating circumstances, sentenced to fifteen years in prison."

Zoey's legs gave out, and she almost collapsed.

The bailiffs held her up.

Her eyes were empty, and she let out a desperate whimper.

"Defendant Adrian Lowell, causing grievous bodily harm through negligence, sentenced to eight years."

Adrian's eyes widened.

His face instantly lost all color.

He looked at me with regret in his eyes.

But it was too late.

"The remaining accomplices are sentenced to three to five years in prison."

Some burst into tears on the spot.

Some were dragged away by the bailiffs, their legs giving out.

The trial ended, and I walked out of the courthouse.

Sunlight broke through the clouds and fell on me.

My mother gently held my hand.

"It's all over."

"Yes, it's over."

The weight in my heart finally lifted.

Later, Adrian wrote me multiple letters from prison.

I heard he even threatened suicide to see me.

The prison guards had to relay the messages.

But my mother intercepted them all.

She told me,

"The cheapest thing in this world is regret."

"He didn't suddenly love you; he just regrets missing out on a wealthy family."

I nodded.

Of course, I understood.

Perhaps I was just a tool for him to show off.

He never truly cared for me.

Zoey's parents once came to plead for leniency.

They dropped their arrogance and humbly offered to give up everything they had as compensation, just to get my forgiveness.

I chuckled.

"Compensation? Would the heiress of the Ashcroft Group care about your petty money?"

They never showed up again.

I occasionally followed my mother to learn how to manage the company.

I also made new friends.

They were sincere and kind, never maliciously speculating about me.

One day, while sorting through old belongings, I found the cheap bracelet Adrian had given me.

A nine-dollar trinket.

Without hesitation, I threw it in the trash.

The future is long, and these unworthy people should be forgotten.

Years later, I inherited my mother's business and became the widely praised young CEO Ashcroft.

I heard about Adrian from a mutual friend.

He had been released from prison.

After getting out, he was penniless.

He struggled to find a job.

In the end, he had to work as a laborer at a construction site.

The friend went on and on.

"You know, he still hasn't given up. He's been asking about you. It's ridiculous."
