###Chapter 1A Fragile Marriage
Brinley Shaw set her resignation letter on the HR manager's desk, her fingertips smoothing the edge of the paper as though ensuring not a single fold or wrinkle remained.



The manager parted his lips, a resigned sigh escaping before he spoke. "It's such a pityto see you leaving,Brinley.Are you absolutely certain about this?"



"Yeah," Brinley said with a soft smile, her eyes curving like crescents. "I'd like to spend more time with my family."



Stepping out of thecompany building,she was met by a flood of sunlight.



She squinted against the glare and pulled a pair of sunglasses from her bag, slipping them on.



Just then, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Ryland Francis, a real estate agent. "Mrs. Palmer, the owner of the villa you like has agreed to lower the price. Could you come view it this afternoon?"



Brinley smiled at the good news.



That small villa on the outskirts of the city-a place  she had admired for a long time-stood far away from the noise and bustle of downtown.



Its peaceful surroundings might just be the opportunity she needed to strengthen her fragile marriage with Colin Palmer.


Married for two years, she and Colin had never once been intimate.



In the beginning, she had convinced herself his hectic work schedule was to blame, but gradually, doubts about her own attractiveness began to creep in.


Finally admitting that something had to change, she quit her job to spend more time with her husbandand salvage their relationship.



That afternoon, she visited the villa. It turned out to be even more charming in reality than in the photographs.



The elderly couple who owned it had kept a garden brimming with roses, their sweet perfume lingering heavily in the air.



Standing in the middle of the sunlit living room,Brinley watched her shadow stretch long across the polished floor.


"This is the one! How do we proceed?" she said in a firm voice. Ryland's face lit up. "Excellent! I'll prepare the contract immediately. By the way, will Mr. Palmer be joining you to sign?"



Brinley shook her head. "No, he's tied up with work.I'll take care of it."



"Alright then. Please bring all necessary documents with you tomorrow for the paperwork."



On her way home,Brinley sent Colin a quick message."I resigned and found a villa I love. I'm planning to buy it."



His reply came almost instantly. "So sudden? But if it makes you happy, that's what matters. I'll come home early tonight; we'll celebrate."



Warmth spread through Brinley's chest as she gazed at the screen.



Colin had always treated her with care and tenderness.He remembered her favorite meals, always had sweet treats ready when she had her period, and never missed an anniversary without a thoughtful gift.



Apart from his refusal to be intimate with her-which upset her deeply-he was nearly the perfect husband.



The following morning, Brinley dressed with special care before leaving for the real estate agency. She chose a pink-and-white dress, the very one Colin often praised as suiting her best.



"Mrs. Palmer, please, have a seat," Ryland greeted her warmly. "I'll bring out the contract."


Smiling, Brinley passed him a folder. "Here's a copy of my marriage certificate with Colin. I would like to register the house as a joint marital property."



Ryland accepted it and tapped away at the computer for a while, but soon he frowned. "That's odd... The system isn't pulling up your marriage registration record."



Brinley's smile faltered. "What do you mean by that?"



"Probably just a system error," Ryland said quickly,trying to reassure her. "You can confirm it directly at city hall. It happens every now and then."



Brinley's chest pounded wildly. A creeping sense of unease overwhelmed her.



Forcing herself to stay calm, she replied, "Alright. I'll head there right away."
###Chapter 2 A Substitute



The staff at the City Hall adjusted his spectacles,peering at the copy of the marriage certificate again and again.


At last, he spoke. "Ma'am, the document you've presented is counterfeit. Our records show no marriage registration whatsoever between you and Mr.Colin Palmer."



Brinley stiffened when she heard this.



She opened her mouth to speak, but no words came;her lips only twitched.


"This... this can't be," she finally muttered, her voice almost inaudible. "We were married here... two years agO..."



The staff shook his head, looking sympathetic. "I'm sorry,but this is the truth: I can't find any information about your marriage in our system. If you believe you've been deceived, it's best to report the matter to the authorities."



Nodding stiffly, Brinley accepted the copy of the marriage certificate as he handed it back to her. Her fingers trembled when they brushed its edge.


The document she had treasured for the past two years turned out to be fake.How preposterous!


Outside the City Hall, Brinley halted on the steps, her head dizzyingly light.


She needed time. She needed somewhere quiet to untangle the storm of thoughts threatening to consume her.



She wandered into a small café nearby and ordered an iced black coffee, strong and bitter.



The sharp taste filled her mouth, but it could not compare to the bitterness clawing at her heart.


At that very moment, her phone lit up with a message from Colin. "Brinley, what would you like for dinner tonight? I'll pick something up after work."



A surge of nausea rose within her as Brinley stared at the message on her screen.



Drawing in a shaky breath, she typed, "Don't worry. I'll cook."



Almost instantly, Collin replied, "Alright. I'll be home on time after work."



Brinley didn't respond. Instead,she checked the clock; it was half past three.



Then she decided to pay a visit to Colin's office without informing him beforehand.



His tech firm was located in a modern tower on the east side of the city.


She had delivered him lunch there many times,enough that the receptionist recognized her at once and greeted her with a smile, waving her through.


The elevator carried her to the 28th floor, and she stepped out,following the familiar path toward Colin's office.


But as she rounded a corner, the sound of his familiar voice drifted from the break room. "I'm conflicted,but you know... I just can't let go of Milly."


Brinley stopped in her tracks, her body stiffening as though the world itself had frozen around her.



Quietly, she backed up and pressed herself against a column, straining to listen.



"What do you intend to do,then?" a man asked.



Brinley recognized the voice immediately. It belonged to Vance Graham, Colin'sclose friend.



"Are you planning to stay with Brinley while marrying Milly Russell? Colin, that's not fair."



The words struck Brinley like a violent blow. She had to grasp the wall for balance.



Milly Russell? Who was she? Colin was marrying that woman?



Each word felt like a blade slicing into her chest.



"I know it isn't fair," Colin admitted with a weary sigh."But when Milly left to pursue her career abroad, I was heartbroken.Then Brinley came along...she reminded me so much of Milly that dating her finally brought healing to my broken heart."


Brinley bit her lower lip until she tasted the metallic tang of blood. She reminded him of Milly?


So that was what she was? A substitute?
###Chapter 3 Marriage Alliance



"But later on," Colin continued in a hesitant voice, "I came to realize Brinley isn't like Milly at all. She's softer,depends on me more, and... loves me in a way Milly never did."



Vance chuckled derisively. "And with that realization,you still justify deceiving her?"



"I don't deceive her!" Colin's voice rose with sudden intensity before falling again into a whisper."I truly do care for her... it's just..."



"Just what?" Vance asked impatiently.


"It's just that I can't seem to cut Milly off completely,"Colin admitted, sounding torn. "She was my first love.When she came back from abroad and reached out, I couldn't push her away. But at the same time,I didn't want to give up Brinley."



"So you went as far as to forge a marriage certificate,letting Brinley believe the two of you were legally bound?" The disgust was obvious in Vance's voice."Colin, that makes you nothing short of a scumbag."



Colin fell silent for a few seconds before answering with a bitter, self-mocking laugh, "Yes, I'm a scumbag. I want Milly's fire, Brinley's gentleness... I even let myself imagine how perfect it would be to keep them both in my life."



"You must be delusional!" Vance snapped. "If Brinley ever found out about your double life, do you honestly think she'd forgive you?"


"She won't ever know," Colin said, interrupting Vance."She trusts me completely, never questions a thing.Even when she phoned while Milly and I were in bed,she was too oblivious to notice anything unusual."



Those words smashed Brinley's heart like a ruthless strike.



Turning, she walked soundlessly toward the elevator.Each step felt unreal, as though she were moving through a heavy fog.


The man she had loved for two whole years was nothing but a liar.







Brinley had no idea how she managed to return home.


Absentmindedly, she unlocked the door, drifted into the kitchen, and began preparing dinner mechanically.


At half-past six, the sound of a key turning in the lock reached her ears. Colin entered with his usual charm, carrying a fresh bouquet of lilies.


"I'm back." He leaned in and brushed her forehead with a kiss, smiling warmly.


Brinley forced her lips into a smile as she accepted the flowers.



Oblivious to her stiffness, Colin shrugged off his suit jacket and sniffed the air. "Mmm, what did you make?Smells delicious."



"Your favorite. Grilled meat." Brinley turned away to place the bouquet into a vase, hiding her cold expression.


Through the entire meal, Brinley kept her eyes fixed on him, studying every gesture.



Collin's phone never left the table, lying face down,and every so often he flicked his eyes at it, as though waiting for a message.



"My head aches a little," Brinley muttered after dinner."Could you fetch me some medicine from upstairs?It's in the nightstand drawer."



"Of course," Colin said immediately, springing up."You just rest here." The moment he was upstairs, Brinley snatched his phone.



The screen came on, requiring a password.



She tried her own birthday, then their anniversary Neither unlockeed it.



Just as she was about to attempt again, a message notification flashed across the screen. "Colin,wonderful news-I'm pregnant!"


Brinley's fingers froze. The words blazed before her eyes,stabbing her like sharpened steel.


She stared in shock until Colin's footsteps began descending. Panicking, she dropped the phone back onto the table.



Colin returned with the pills and a glass of water."You don't look well. Do you want to lie down early?"


Brinley accepted the pills, pretended to swallow,then replied, "I'm fine. By the way... is there something going on at the office? You kept glancing at your phone."


For a moment, Collin stiffened, but then he quickly composed himself. "Yes, a project issue. I might need to head back later." "Then go," Brinley said with a gentle smile, though her heart was breaking inside. "Work always comes first."



Colin slipped on his coat, pausing to kiss her cheek."Don't wait up for me. Get some rest."



As the door clicked shut behind him, Brinley's smile crumbled.



Tears formed in her eyes, but she stubbornly tipped her head back, refusing to let them fall.



Only after a long struggle did she finally pick up her phone, her hand trembling, and dial a number she hadn't called in two years.



"Dad, I've decided. I'll return home... and I'll accept the marriage alliance you arranged."
###Chapter 4 Charity Gala



Three months later



A sleek black Maybach rolled to a stop outside the glittering club, its polished surface catching every shard of neon light.


When Brinley stepped gracefully from the car, her eyes lingered on the grand entrance, ablaze with chandeliers and flashing lights.


Tonight, the Knight family's annual charity gala was underway, drawing in the wealthiest and most influential figures in Bleron.


Old memories pressed in, bitter and sharp, tugging a sarcastic curve at Brinley's lips.


"Ms. Shaw, you've finally arrived." Ryan Bailey, the Knight family's longtime butler, hurried forward with quick precision, flanked on both sides by two lines of imposing bodyguards. Every gesture radiated deference.



Brinley tilted her chin and gave him a faint, cold nod in acknowledgment.



Ryan gestured politely. "This way, please," he said,  moving ahead while those bodyguards followed, their presence alone drawing stares.



Because of Brinley's identity, they bypassed the main hall and slipped through a private passage.


At her quiet request, Ryan waved off the bodyguards,but their absence did little to lessen the attention she attracted. Her arrivalstill turned heads.



Draped in a bold crimson gown with her hair swept into a sleek ponytail,Brinley radiated confidence-elegant and arresting in her simplicity.


Recognition rippled through the crowd.


"Isn't that Brinley?" someone whispered, awe and curiosity threading through their tone.


"Oh my, what is she doing here? Since when did the Knight family's gatherings become open to just anyone?"



"I heard Colin tossed her aside after catching her cheating. It was a whole spectacle. How does she still have the audacity to show up tonight?"


"Shh,keep your voice down. She used to be the apple of the Shaw family's eye, but they've cut her off completely... Look at her, still carrying herself as if she matters." The sharp whispers rippled through the hall and drifted to Brinley, yet she remained unfazed.



Settling elegantly into a quiet corner,she sampled the appetizers with calm detachment. Her serene poise only made the gossipers more irritated.



At the front of their little pack was Renee Dale,daughter of Dale Group's CEO.



With a sly smile curving her lips and a glass of wine poised in her hand, she swept toward Brinley, her companions trailing behind.



Renee's voice carried deliberately, her smile sharp as glass. "Well, if it isn't Miss Shaw. All by yourself tonight? Where's Mr. Palmer? Oh, that's right-I heard the two of you split. Hardly shocking. A man like him could not tolerate a partner who was unfaithful."



Before Brinley could answer, one of Renee's companions leaned in eagerly. "Renee's right. No offense, Brinley, but do you really think showing up here will win Mr. Palmer back? That ship has sailed.Milly's the one by his side now-she's carrying his child."



The sharp exchange only stirred the crowd further,hungry for drama.



Brinley tilted her head just enough to meet Renee and her entourage with a cold glance. "You all seem awfully fascinated with my personal life,"she said, her tone deceptively gentle but edged with steel. "My affairs, however, aren't open for your judgment. And as for why I'm here..." Her lips curved into a wry smile. "Does the Knight family need your permission before extending an invitation?"


Renee faltered,her face reddening with fury. "Brinley,get off your high horse! Everyone knows about your scandal.How dare you show your face here? What,are you desperate? No man would ever want you now!"


Brinley's eyes hardened, her voice cool and measured."It's none of your business, Miss Dale." She tilted her chin ever so slightly, her tone laced with irony."Instead of wasting your time on me, perhaps you should pay attention to Dale Group's stock. Word is,it's been plummeting thanks to some very poor decisions."



The color drained from Renee's cheeks. "What are you talking about? That's complete nonsense!"



Brinley arched a brow, and replied evenly, "Don't play dumb. You know exactly what I mean."



She brushed Renee off with effortless grace, lifting a delicate pastry from the tray and taking a slow,unhurried bite as if savoring the sweetness more than the conversation. Across the hall, Colin was in conversation with a man,one arm draped possessively around Milly's waist.



He turned instinctively at the sound of the commotion,his gaze locking on a figure he could never mistake.A jolt ran through him, his chest tightening at the sight of Brinley.


Without sparing Milly aglance, he strode straight toward Brinley despite the surprised onlookers.



"Colin?" Milly's voice faltered, her smile freezing.



Her expression soured as her eyes landed on Brinley not far away, and she hastily hurried after Colin.
###Chapter 5 Painted Brinley As A Desperate Clinger

"Brinley!" Colin's voice broke through the commotion as he shoved past the curious onlookers, urgency sharpening his stride until he was standing right before her.



For a moment, his chest clenched with dread-afraid she might vanish again, slipping through his fingers the way she had before,leaving him to chase shadows in her absence.



But when their eyes met, her gaze was icy,stripped of any trace of warmth.



His breath hitched, the words he'd prepared dissolving on his tongue. The joy that had flared in his chest extinguished in an instant, like a bucket of cold water poured over his head. His expression hardened, and his tone became chilling. "What are you doing here? And why did you disappear back then without a single word?Do you know how much time and money I burned trying to find you?" His voice cracked with anger."Tell me you didn't actually throw me away for someone else, like all those whispers claim."



The sharp demand pulled every head toward Brinley curious eyes cutting into her like blades


Milly hurried to Colin's side, clutching his arm with soft urgency. "Colin, please, calm down and talk it through.Miss Shaw must have had her reasons for vanishing without a word."



She faced Brinley then, her sympathetic tone laced with gentle reproach. "Miss Shaw, I understand if you still carry feelings for Colin, but you should move on.Disappearing and then suddenly showing up again like this-surely you know it only makes things harder for everyone."


Her words, disguised as soothing counsel, instead painted Brinley as a desperate clinger, a caricature of obsession. The judgment weighed heavy in the air, and the whispers around them grew sharper, more merciless.



"Exactly-what is Brinley after, hanging around here like this when Colin has already moved on?"



"Milly is being awfully generous-if it were me, l would've snapped by now."


"This is the Knight family's event. They don't just let anyone wander in. Did she slip past security? Where's the organizer? Someone needs to toss her out."



"Honestly, just sharing the same room with her drags down the class of this gathering." The restlessness spread quickly, whispers swelling into a low tide of outrage until someone had already gone to fetch the organizer, demanding Brinley's removal.



Listening to Milly's so-called persuasion and the rising chorus of disdain around him, Colin exhaled softly, the sound heavy with weariness. "Brinley, I know you regret having left me. Why don't you apologize? Out of respect for our... history, I could even put in a word with Mrs. Knight and help you stay."



Brinley only let out a derisive laugh,her eyes sweeping over Colin with a cold detachment that silently warned him to keep his distance.



She lifted her glass and took an unhurried sip of wine,her face serene, untouched by the tension around her.



That effortless dismissal cut deeper than any sharp retort could have.



A flicker of wounded pride shadowed Colin's expression.





Before he could muster another word, a stocky middle -aged man bustled over, clearly the assistant to the organizer, his tone clipped and unfriendly. "Miss, this is a private event. If you don't have an invitation, I'll have to ask you to leave."



The crowd leaned forward with undisguised  anticipation, hungry to see Brinley humiliated and dragged out.


Brinley arched a brow, a low, unreadable laugh slipping past her lips, offering no reply.


Colin,unsettled by her silence, stepped in close, his voice taut with urgency. "Brinley, you'd really rather be tossed out like this than give me an answer-or even an apology?"


Milly's fists tightened at her sides, though she plastered on a soft, understanding smile. "Miss Shaw,be sensible. Apologize to Colin. With all these eyes on you,why put yourself through more shame?"


Every gaze in the hall pinned itself to Brinley, waiting for her next move as if she were the evening's entertainment.



The air seemed to press in, heavy with suspense and the promise of mockery.



Brinley finally placed her dessert aside, dabbing her fingertips with a napkin before lifting her gaze past Colin and Milly to the figure striding toward them.


"Mathew!" A commanding voice rang out, laced with authority.


Mathew Patel, the middle-aged man, spun around,ready to report to his superior that Brinley didn't have an invitation, but the newcomer's cutting glare froze the words inhis throat.



Without sparing Colin a glance, Ryan went directly to Brinley. He addressed her in a deferential tone. "Ms.Shaw, I deeply apologize for the disrespect you've endured. The fault lies entirely with me for failing to discipline my assistant. Please forgive this lapse."



All color drained from Mathew's face. "Ryan, I..."



His attempt at explanation was crushed beneath Ryan's glacial stare, sharp enough to silence him completely.


Ryan's voice dropped into a measured calm that carried more weight than if he had shouted."Who gave you the right to disrespect our guest in front of everyone?" he asked, each word edged with quiet authority. "How could you just assume that she walked in without an invitation?"



The color drained from Mathew's face with every syllable.


The crowd held its breath, stunned by the unexpected turn.



Ryan was the Knight family's butler, a man who had faithfully served Thalia Knight for three decades,his voice carrying weight across Bleron's highest circles. And yet here he was, treating Brinley with unmistakable deference.



Whispers rippled through the onlookers. Why did Ryan treat Brinley with such respect?



Hadn't the Shaw family already severed ties with her?



"Ms. Shaw,please forgive what happened just now,"Ryan said once more, his voice respectful yet edged with nervous submission. "I know Mathew upset you,and I'll deal with him right away. WVould you prefer to rest in the VIP lounge,or..." His words trailed, anxiety rising.



Thalia had instructed him to treat Brinley with care,yet in the few minutes he was gone, everything unraveled.



Brinley idly swirled the champagne in her glass, her expression composed. "I'll go along with whatever arrangements Mrs. Knight has made."



"Understood!" Ryan bowed his head as he gestured for her to follow. "The lounge has been set with refreshments. Mrs. Knight was just speaking of you."



Another gasp rippled through the crowd at his words.



Thalia was the undisputed queen of Bleron's real estate world-a woman even the mayor deferred to. For crying out loud! She was personally hosting Brinley!




Colin's gaze locked on Brinley, his expression tangled with disbelief and unease. Words rose to his throat but died there as she moved past him, her poise unbroken, following Ryan toward the lounge.



Milly clutched Colin's arm, sensing the rigid tension running through him.



While Ryan guided Brinley toward the grand spiral staircase that led to the second-floor VIP lounge,Mathew went crashing to his knees in a desperate gesture. "Ms. Shaw, please accept my apologies for my earlier rudeness. Please... grant me mercy just this once!"



Brinley didn't so much as flinch, not even sparing him a glance.



Ryan, on the other hand, halted in his tracks and leveled Mathew with an icy stare. "You've broken the family rules. That's why you're fired-not because of Ms.Shaw."



He lifted a hand, signaling to the nearby guards before delivering his verdict with crisp authority. "Escort him out.Notify HR-his employment is terminated. Makeit clear he will never be rehired." "Wait! Ryan, please-don't do this!" Mathew's desperate cries echoed for a moment before being muffled as the guards dragged him away



A heavy hush blanketed the banquet hall. Guests stood frozen, stunned by how swiftly judgment had been passed.



Those who had sneered at Brinley minutes earlier now felt a cold dread crawl down their spines, realizing just how dangerous it was to stand on the wrong side of her.
 ###Chapter 6 Her Husband



Colin's gaze lingered on the stairwell until the sweep of Brinley's scarlet dress vanished from sight,leaving his chest painfully tight, as though gripped in an iron vice.



Memories pressed in-two years of her quiet loyalty,her gentle temper, the way she'd even defied her own family for his sake.



And now, when her eyes met his, there was nothing left but cold indifference.



What had gone so wrong?



Catching the shift in Colin's gaze, Milly nibbled her lower lip, her face still carrying that soft, demure facade. "Colin, let's sit down over there. It's getting far too crowded."



Colin blinked, dragging himself from the fog of memory.His eyes flicked to Milly's rounded belly, then back to the empty stairway, before he finally forced his gaze away. "Fine. Just watch your step."



But before they could take a step, the heavy double doors of the banquet hall rattled with sudden commotion. The security guards stiffened and all the guests turned their heads expectantly toward the entrance.


The wall of black suits cut straight through the buzzing hall, forcing the crowd to part.


At their head strode a man who radiated dominance,his tailored suit clinging perfectly to broad shoulders and a lean waist. His face was all hard lines and precision, his gaze deep and unyielding, carrying a weight that pressed down on the room.


"Mr. Moore?" The stunned whisper slipped out, and the entire banquet froze into a silence so deep a pin drop could have echoed on the marble floor.


Recognition rippled through the guests. It was Austin Moore,the elusive and ruthless CEO of Moore Group -a man who commanded both fear and awe in boardrooms.



It was quite unexpected that he would appear at the Knight family's charity gala.


Never before had he attended trivial events like this.In the past,Moore Group sent only a senior executive as a formality. Austin himself avoided even major business summits, dismissing them as a waste of time.



Gasps and murmurs slowly returned, hushed but fervent. "My God, what on earth is Mr. Moore doing here?"



"Unbelievable... he never shows up to these things."



"Is it possible he came here because of Mrs. Knight's personal invitation?"



The whispers grew into a quiet tide of speculation.Every pair of eyes was fixed on Austin, flled with curiosity.


Several of the Knight family's members bustled forward, their smiles overly bright and eager.


"Mr. Moore, what an honor to have you with us tonight!" one of them gushed.



Austin barely spared them a glance. His eyes were locked on the second-floor VIP lounge.



Leaning in, his assistant murmured discreetly, "Your wife is already upstairs with Mrs. Knight and the butler."


Though the nearby guests couldn't catch the words,they could read the tightening of Austin's jaw.



A ripple of unease swept through the hall, and many heads turned toward the upper floor with silent sympathy.


The Knight family had left the infamous Austin wajting at the hall while they entertained Brinley? That kind of slight was reckless. Everyone knew how merciless his temper could be, and the consequences would fall hard. As for Brinley... caught in the middle,her situation looked just as perilous.



"This is about to get ugly," someone whispered nervously. "Crossing Mr. Moore is practically suicide."


Murmurs rippled through the crowd, and Milly's lashes lowered just enough to veil the flicker of gloating delight in her eyes.


Now that Brinley unwittingly provoked Austin, her lofty status wouldn't protect her-she'd soon be kicked out of Bleron.



With that thought, Milly brushed Colin's sleeve with delicate fingers, her voice soft with feigned frailty."Colin, my stomach feels a little uneasy..."



Colin's eyes had been locked on the stairway,his mind racing for a way to shield Brinley. But Milly's plea snapped him back, his expression tightening with worry. "What's wrong? Are you feeling worn out?Come,I'll take you to the lounge so you can rest."



"Mm, it's just a little stifling in here..." Milly sighed faintly, leaning into him as though the effort of standing was too much. Yet even as she did, her gaze slid toward the stairway, sly and taunting. A slight smile tugged at her mouth as the thought crossed her mind. As long as she was around,Brinley could damn well forget about ever getting near Colin again.



She knew well enough that his heart hadn't let go of Brinley. But it didn't matter. His child growing within her was the chain that would bind Colin to her forever.



Over the past few months, Colin had showered her with affection, yet more than once she had overheard him breathing out "Brinley" in his sleep.


She understood with painful clarity that although Brinley had once been her substitute, now it was Brinley who held Colin's heart.


Still, that didn't trouble her. Her triumph lay in one thing only: becoming Colin's wife.


Colin guided Milly toward the lounge with practiced care, his every gesture brimming with tenderness, as though he hadn't been the man drowning in heartbreak just minutes ago.


At that same moment, a sharply dressed, middle-aged guest eased his way closer to Austin, eager to flatter him while twisting the knife toward Brinley.


He deliberately raised his voice, making sure the nearby guests could hear. "Mr. Moore, you probably haven't been told, but the Knight family has been pouring all their attention on Miss Shaw tonight.The display was so extravagant, one might assume she was some exalted figure..."



Austin's eyes flicked over him, his tone smooth yet laced with ridicule. "Oh? My wife sure knows how to stir things up,huh?"



The remark made the man's mouth twitch, his features blanching in shock.



Austin had just called Brinley his wife!



He looked as though he might try to explain, but Austin's bodyguards closed in with faces carved from stone, motioning him toward the exit. "Sir, that's enough. Please come with us."



The man's complexion shifted from smug to pale."What in the world are you doing? I was trying to let Mr.Moore know..."



"Mr. Moore's business is not yours to discuss," one of the bodyguards cut him off, voice flat and frigid,leaving no room for negotiation.



When he tried to resist, two bodyguards seized him firmly by the arms and dragged him away, his protests quickly swallowed by the crowd.


 
The onlookers stiffened, a collective shudder running through them. No one dared to make another careless remark.



Austin, however, didn't spare the man a glance. His eyes stayed locked on the second floor, his expression unreadable.



Meanwhile, in the VIP lounge above, Brinley sat opposite Thalia, their conversation flowing easily,smiles lighting the quiet room.


At that moment, a manager knocked lightly on the doorframe and announced, "Mr. Moore has arrived."


Before the words had even settled in the air, Austin was already striding in from behind, offering Thalia a polite nod.



Brinley's head lifted instinctively.


Across the room, Austin's gaze locked with hers, and in that instant, the atmosphere seemed to turn still and weighty.


It was the very first timne she had seen him since their marriage.



For the past three months, he had remained overseas,absent even on the day their registration was finalized.



Until now, her only impression of him came from glossy magazine covers flaunting his striking features and ruthless reputation.



Yet here he stood, barely five steps away.



The sheer force of his presence pressed down on her,and without realizing it, she held her breath.
###Chapter 7 Quite The Impression You've Made

Austin stood tall, his presence so striking that all eyes were irresistibly drawn to him.



Brinley thought to herself that it was no wonder he was hailed as the most handsome man in Bleron.



His appearance, his commanding aura, and his physique-all of it-were far superior to Colin's in every possible way.



Ending up with such a wealthy and dazzling husband was nothing short of fortune smiling upon her.



Brinley and Austin glanced at each other for a moment.



Before either could speak,the doors swung open and a sudden commotion filled the room.



Several business partners entered in a rush.



"Mr. Moore, we've been waiting anxiously for your arrival."



"You're always occupied with work; it's rare to catch a glimpse of you." The men immediately surrounded Austin, each eager to curry favor, unintentionally pushing Brinley aside in their eagerness.



Austin was noticeably displeased at the interruption,but the group remained oblivious, chattering away with unrestrained enthusiasm.



Thalia stepped forward to ease the awkwardness. "Mr.Moore will be spending plenty of time with you today,so there's no need to hurry. Please, take a seat and have some drinks first."



With that, she walked to Brinley and guided her back from the sidelines, smiling as she introduced her."This is Ms. Brinley Shaw. She's here today to share some of her business insights with you."



Thalia's intention was to smooth the atmosphere,but instead, the mention of Brinley's name triggered a ripple of muffled laughter.



One of the men, Oliver Simpson, looked Brinley up and down before remarking with a mocking grin, "Ms.Shaw,you are indeed easy on the eyes, but your judgment... perhaps not as impressive. You cut ties with your own family for a man, becoming nothing but a subject of ridicule in Bleron."



Another added, "Yes, Ms. Shaw, if you're so devoted to men, perhaps family affairs should be your focus  rather than business ventures."



"Oliver!" Thalia frowned in displeasure, ready to step in,but Austin lifted a hand to stop her.



All eyes immediately turned to him.



Austin crossed the room unhurriedly.He reached out and brushed a strand of Brinley's hair back behind her ear before slipping an arm naturally around her waist.


"So, in your opinion, Mr. Simpson, my wife doesn't measure up to your standards?"


His tone was light but had a menacing undertone.


Oliver froze with terror.



The Brinley Shaw who had severed ties with her family and tarnished her name for some man turned out to be the wife of Austin Moore?



Oliver laughed awkwardly, scrambling for words."Ah,Mrs. Moore, my apologies. Mr. Moore, people say you are not interested in women, but clearly, you have exquisite taste and prefer..."



He paused, then continued, "Prefer beautiful women."



Though he was offering a compliment, his eyes clearly conveyed subtle contempt. Thalia scowled, ready to intervene again,but Austin signaled for her to hold back.



Instead of speaking, he studied Brinley with interest,clearly curious about how she would handle the situation.


Smirking, Brinley turned to address Oliver. "Mr.Simpson, your words remind me of something. I once heard that some influential businessmen have a fondness for keeping several young women at once.They are really shameless. Surely you've heard such rumors too?"



Oliver went pale at once.



He did maintain several mistresses, some quite young.It wasn't entirely public, but neither was it a well-kept secret.



Brinley's remark was a clear jab at him. But with Austin standing beside her, Oliver dared not lash out.


Brinley had a small smile on her face,glancing around the room. "Instead of speculating about others,wouldn't it be wiser to tend to your own affairs?"



Her words, polite in tone but sharp in substance,deflected the mockery and issued a subtle warning.



Standing beside her, Austin looked utterly pleased. He had assumed that Brinley was gentle and reserved,yet here she was, fearless and assertive.



Sensing the tension, Thalia intervened,laughing lightly."Well, Brinley certainly has a sharp tongue. Alright,everyone, let's not take it too seriously. Come, let's sit down. No need to crowd around."



Oliver looked stiff and displeased. But he sat down,not daring to retort.



Leaning toward Brinley, Austin whispered, "Quite the impression you've made, my dear wife."



Brinley tilted her head toward him, her smile playful."Like what you saw?"



Austin only smirked, deciding not to reply. Instead,he gripped Brinley's waist even tighter.
 ###Chapter 8 You're Coming Back With Me
Austin was hardly ever seen at social events like this,so his appearance today caused a stir-people flocked to him one after another, eager to strike up conversations.



Brinley sat silently at his side, looking like nothing more than a beautiful ornament.



Those who knew who she was didn't dare approach too closely. They had witnessed the confrontation earlier and had no intention of provoking her.



Normally, Austin would have brushed off these flattering business talks with irritation. He had always kept others at arm's length.



But tonight was different. His attention never truly left the petite figure beside him-Brinley.



For over a decade he had been watching from a distance, and now, unbelievably, she was right here next to him.



"I need to use the restroom." Brinley leaned close and whispered into Austin's ear. She was restless from sitting too long. Austin responded in a low voice, "Don't take too long,okay?"



She gave a nod and walked out of the VIP lounge.Many pairs of eyes followed her.



After using the restroom, she stepped out, only to find a man reeking of alcohol staggering drunkenly into her path.



"Brinley..." he mumbled.



Brinley scowled the moment she recognized Colin.


"Mr. Palmer, please control yourself," she said, taking a step back.



But Colin tottered forward, reaching for her hand."Brinley, I've realized how wrong | was! Give me another chance. I can't do without you. These three months apart... I've missed you so much I feel like I'm going mad!"


"Enough!" Brinley snapped. "I don't want to hear any more of your nonsense. Colin, listen, we're done. Stay away from me, or I promise you'll regret it."


She sounded cold and menacing.



For a moment, Colin falteredat the fierce glint in her eyes. But the alcohol clouding his judgment and the  fear of losing her made him reckless.


He lunged forward, trying to pull her into an embrace,even attempting to kiss her. "Brinley, just gve me one more chance, please..."



"Get lost!" Brinley barked, swiftly dodging him.



Then, in a flash, she drove her high-heeled foot into his abdomen with all the force she could muster.



Colin let out a cry of pain, bending over and clutching his stomach.



Before he could recover, Brinley kicked him squarely between his legs.



"Ah!" Colin screamed in agony, collapsing to the floor and curling up miserably.



He looked ghostly pale, his shirt drenched in cold sweat. He could barely make a sound.



The disturbance drew the attention of nearby guests,all looking stunned and intrigued



Brinley stared down at Colin with disgust.



She crouched and whispered close to his ear, "Colin,take this as your warning. If you dare try this again,you'll regret it far more than you do now." Straightening, she smoothed her dress and strode away.


From a distance away,Austin had seen it all. He had just finished his conversation and now stood with his hands tucked in his pockets, watching Brinley leave.A faint,knowing smile played across his lips.


His wife was far more fascinating than he had imagined.



Once the banquet was over, the guests began to disperse.


When Brinley reached the exit, a sleek black Maybach pulled up to block her way.



The window slid down, revealing Austin's charming face.



"Get in," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.


Brinley had a frown on her face. "Mr. Moore, I have my own car."



"I already had it sent back," Austin replied firmly. "Now,get in."


 
Keeping a straight face, Brinley replied, "I want to return to my own place." "Your place?" Austin blinked. "Have you forgotten we're married? That means we're supposed to live together."



"But..."



"No buts," Austin said, cutting her off. "I prepared our new home three months ago. Now, you're coming back with me."



He spoke in a domineering tone, yet oddly enough, it stirred no resistance in her.



Brinley met his deep eyes, silent for a minute.



She knew he was the kind of man who demanded compliance and would not tolerate resistance. Besides,she needed a new beginning, a solid identity as Austin's wife, to truly free herself from her past.



Taking a steadying breath, she pulled open the car door and slid inside.



"Drive," Austin ordered the driver.



The black Maybach glided into the night, disappearing into the stream of traffic.



Leaning back in her seat, Brinley stared at the neon lights flashing past outside the window. A swirl of emotions churned within her heart.
###Chapter 9 | Don't Want Unnecessary Trouble
The car eventually rolled to a stop in front of a grand villa perched midway up the hillside.


The villa stretched out broadly, its glowing lights bright against the night, almost like a modern-day castle.



"We've arrived," Austin said as he stepped out first,circling around to open the door for Brinley.



She stepped down gracefully,raising her head to take in the imnposing edifice. For a moment, she was struck with a mixture of awe and unease.



This was her new home.



Unlike the house she once shared with Colin, this villa was unquestionably more opulent, yet at the same time strangely foreign.



Austin, standing side by side with Brinley now,said in a low voice, "From today onward, this is your home."



Brinley turned her head to study him.



Beneath the glow of the villa's lights, his profile  appeared prominent and dignified.


She gave a small nod and followed him inside.



As she took in the interior decor, she was surprised to find that his house was both modest and elegant.


She turned, studying Austin.



How could this man-with such a gentle look-be the same ruthless figure the public feared?



Well,perhaps this calm side of him was nothing but a front.



Glancing up, Brinley caught a glimpse of Austin's collarbone revealed by the slight shift of his suit collar. The sight made her swallow unconsciously.



She couldn't deny he was indeed an attractive man.But she still felt a deep, instinctive caution. This was someone she needed to keep her distance from.


"Mr. Moore," Brinley said, trying to stay calm,stopping at the base of the curved staircase, "since this is a marriage of convenience, I think it's better we establish some clear boundaries."


Austin leaned lightly against the banister, tilting his head to look at her.



The soft light spilling from above threw his sharp face into shadow and glow-his nose high, his lips sharply defined.



His eyes, always carrying that trace of a smile,glimmered now with amusement. "Go ahead, I'm listening."



Brinley straightened her shoulders, trying not to be unnerved by his gaze. "First, we don't interfere in each other's private lives."



She paused briefly before continuing, "Second, we keep our finances separate. Neither of us will touch the other's assets."



Then she lifted her chin, glaring into his eyes. "Third, if we ever divorce, we'll part on good terms-with no complications."



A hush settled over the hallway for a mnoment.


Then Austin suddenly laughed, the deep sound echoing warmly through the stairwell. "Don't you think you're being a little too cold with me?"



He took a few strides and stood in front of her.



Brinley caught the scent of cedarwood clinging to him.


"Remember, we're legally husband and wife now,"Austin said. Brinley's heart gave a small jolt, and she instinctively stepped back.



Austin looked fierce and intimidating like a predator advancing towards its prey.



"I think you should understand that this is just a partnership, and there are no feelings attached," she said, trying to stay calm. "I don't want unnecessary trouble."



Looking amused, Austin studied her stiff face.He chose not to press harder.



He reached out, as if to brush the strand of hair resting near her forehead, but midway he stopped and said teasingly, "Trouble? Is that what you think I am?"



Austin's voice had a subtle trace of lust in it. He made no move to touch or hold her, yet somehow,Brinley felt heat creep up her cheeks.



"That's settled," Brinley said firmly, turning her face aside.



Austin gave a helpless shrug, lifting his hands as if in surrender. "Alright, as you wish, my dear wife."



It sounded quite natural when he addressed her teasingly as "my dear wife." Brinley acted as though she hadn't heard a thing,quickly moving past him up the stairs.


The villa had three floors. Austin mentioned that the guest rooms on the east side of the second floor offered the best light and comfort.


But Brinley didn't stop to glance at the options;she continued upward to the far end of the third floor,where a modest wooden door marked the attic space.



She opened it to reveal a room with a lofty ceiling,slanted roof beams, and aged wooden floors. A tall window framed the northwest horizon, the view expansive and quiet.


"This one," she said calmly. "I like the vintage feel."



In truth, she simply wanted the room farthest from his master bedroom.



Austin leaned casually against the doorway, smirking.



"You do have unusual taste," he remarked, eyeing the slanted roof."But in the winter, the drafts will be harsh."



"It doesn't matter," Brinley replied coldly without looking back. "I can manage the cold."



She began to settle in, but her stomach betrayed her with a sudden growl. Austin puckered a brow, amused. "Hungry?" he asked playfully.



Nodding without hesitation, Brinley replied, "Yes. I didn't eat properly at the party."


"Then come on," Austin said, straightening himself."Let's get you something to eat."



Brinley imagined there must be a professional chef waiting in such a luxurious home.



Yet when she followed him into the kitchen,she was surprised to see Austin himself shrug out of his jacket,draping it over a chair. He reached for an apron hanging on the wall, tying it neatly around his waist.


At this moment, he looked nothing like the intimidating man he usually was when he wore suts.


Austin rolled up his sleeves, revealing strong forearms,and began pulling fresh ingredients from the refrigerator.


Brinley paused at the doorway, stunned into silence,as he set a cut of beef on the chopping board. The knife in his hand gleamed under the light, slicing the meat into thin, even strips.



Without glancing up, he called out, "What are you doing just standing there? Come help." Brinley arched an eyebrow but stepped forward,accepting the onion he handed her. She washed it briskly and began chopping it.
###Chapter 10 There's No Need For A Wedding Ceremony
 Austin cast a sidelong glance at Brinley before letting out a low chuckle. "You handle that knife quite well.Did you often cook for Colin in the past?"



Brinley didn't bother looking up from the chopping board. She replied in a calm, almost indifferent voice,"Yes, I did. But looking back now, I guess all that effort was nothing more than a waste."



Austin arched a brow, mildly intrigued by her bluntness. "Oh? Do you regret it?"


Brinley gave a short laugh, brushing the diced onions aside with a casual sweep of her hand."Why should I?For someone so undeserving, it's best not to mention him at all."



Austin's hand froze for a moment as he studied her.He looked curious. "So indifferent?"



"What do you expect?" Brinley raised her head, a faint smile tugging at her lips. "That I cry endlessly,playing out some melodrama of heartbreak?" She gave a little shrug. "When it comes to love, you gamble.Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I can take the loss, and I know how to let go." Austin regarded her for a few seconds before breaking into an amused laugh. "Interesting."



Brinley, uninterested in his teasing, reached for a green pepper. "What else needs to be chopped?"


Without warning, Austin held her wrist firmly but gently. "I'll take care of the rest. You should rest."


Brinley quirked an eyebrow at him. "Why? Do you think my cutting isn't good enough?"


"No," he replied casually, releasing her wrist. "It just struck me that this is our first night under the same roof.You shouldn't tire yourself out."



Brinley hesitated, then laughed softly. "You do know how to be thoughtful."



She set the knife down, wiped her hands, and said lightly, "Fine, I'll take you up on that."


Without wasting time,she turned and ambled out of the kitchen.



Austin's deep eyes followed her, a faint smile lingering on his lips.



Before long, he set three dishes and a soup on the dining table. "Come, try them."



Brinley eyed the plates. One dish still had visible grains of sugar that hadn't melted. The broccoli was overcooked, its edges tinged with black. As for the stir-fried beef, half of it was charred to the point of being unrecognizable.



She blinked,momentarily speechless.



At last, she asked dryly, "You looked rather skilled slicing the beef earlier. But your cooking seemed...lacking."



Austin was unfazed. "I've trained myself with the knife,but heat control isn't exactly my strength."



Brinley was at a loss for words.


Austin continued to look at her, clearly waiting for her to try the food.



Having little choice, Brinley picked up her fork.



She stabbed a piece of the blackened beef, raised it with a pointed look at Austin, who was untying his apron, and asked flatly, "Are you trying to upset me with your culinary adventures?"



Austin stopped wiping his hands and glanced up at her amusedly. "You've got quite the sense of humor."



He pulled out a chair across from her, sat down, and picked up his own fork Brinley's eyes drifted to his forearm, where his sleeve was rolled up.



There,faint but unmistakable, was an old scar winding across the skin above his wrist bone.



It contrasted sharply with his current gentleness.


Brinley recalled the rumors about his ruthless nature,and her fingers tightened around her fork.



The meal continued in a strange, heavy silence.



Despite its appearance, the food tasted far better than it looked.



Brinley ate slowly, taking small bites and stealing glances at Austin from time to time.



He ate calmly, looking elegant even as he consumed his own burnt beef.



Because it was late, the household staff had already retired for the evening.



So after dinner,Austin carried the plates back into the kitchen himself and began washing up. Brinley stared at his retreating figure in disbelief.


Austin, the man who dominated the business world of Bleron, personally cooking and even doing the dishes? Leaning back in her chair, Brinley watched as he moved beneath the warm kitchen light.



As it appeared, the Austin everyone spoke of,heartless and untouchable, was not the same man right before her eyes.



She pressed her warm cheeks with her palms, silently reminding herself, "Brinley, pull yourself together.Don't let appearances deceive you. No matter what,this is just a marriage of convenience. Don't let it become more."



When Austin finally emerged, drying his hands, his sleeves still rolled casually up his forearms, he looked serious, the playfulness gone. This was how he would look in a business meeting.


"Now that I've returned, there are formalities to address," he said, leaning lightly against the kitchen doorframe, staring at her. "Next week, we should visit your father. The wedding also needs to be properly arranged."


Brinley's hand froze around her glass of water, her fingertips trembling slightly.



She set the glass down carefully, meeting his eyes."The purpose of this alliance has already been fulfilled.Informing our families is enough. There's no need for a wedding ceremony,is there?" 
"What do you mean by 'no need'?" Austin frowned,approaching her slowly



The faint cedar scent clung to him, blending with the traces of cooking smoke.


"Even if it's only a marriage of convenience, we will not skip our wedding," he said firmly.



Brinley pushed her chair back, creating somedistance,and answered, "My father is currently tied up with a major project. It's really not a good time..."


"Don't worry," Austin replied, cutting her off firmly."I'll have my assistant coordinate with your father's secretary."



He said it so naturally, as if the wedding were a matter already decided.



In comparison, it made Brinley's reluctance appear suspicious.



Her eyes searched his, looking for signs of jest or calculation.



But he looked dead serious-even earnest-as if this was simply the way things should be.



Finally, she said, "I'll call my father first to see when he's available."
###Chapter 11 Confusion



"Great." Austin nodded, then gave a soft, fleeting smile, so fleeting it was almost as though Brinley had imagined it.



She felt her heart thud unexpectedly as she watched him go up the stairs.


His decision to personally cook for her and his insistence on visiting the Shaw family made her confused.



A man like Austin was supposed to be distant and restrained.



Why was he suddenly paying so much attention to these trivial things?



Brinley frowned, lost in her thoughts. She knew that,when things didn't add up, there was usually a hidden reason.



What exactly was Austin's reason for this unusual attentiveness?



Was there some secret in the Moore family that she didn't know about? Or was there some hidden scheme?



The light at the stairway corner cast his shadow long and dark against the wall.


Brinley squinted as she stared at that silhouette,growing suspicious.



Later that night, once she was back in her room, she fell asleep at once, forgetting her suspicions.



Whatever plans Austin might be making, the Shaw family was not one he could toy with. If he dared to target them, he wouldn't regret it. 2


The following morning, Brinley headed to the office.



For the past three months, she had been building her own company, VantagePath Realty, a firm operating in the same sector as the Palmer Group.



At the mere thought of Colin, Brinley's face scrunched up with displeasure.



Since he had chosen deceit over loyalty, then he needed to be ready to pay the price. She intended to crush his pride in the field he valued.



The days that followed left Brinley with no time to dwell on Austin. Her hours were consumed by preparations for the company's business proposal.


Austin, havig only recently returned to the country,was also tied up with business. During this period, Colin tried repeatedly to seek Brinley out, but she never once agreed to see him.



In Bleron's new development zone, a major commercial complex was about to open up for bids.



The potential profits were enormous, drawing the attention of countless companies.


The Palmer Group had spent a full year laying groundwork for this project, with Colin personally overseeing preparations.



This very project had played a significant role in Brinley's decision to return to Bleron.



Aware of this, Austin discreetly instructed his assistant to forward her the latest information on city planning.


At that moment, Brinley sat at her desk, revising her proposal on the computer screen.



Spread out in front of her were the most recent land assessment reports.



"Ms. Shaw, the final version of the bid presentation is ready," an employee said, handing her a stack of documents.



Brinley accepted them.



She couldn't help recalling the two years she had spent with Colin; their so-called marriage had been nothing but a scam. The memory made her lips curl into a cold smnile.



Just then, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Austin. "I've arranged for my assistant to be at the bidding venue. If you need anything, just reach out."



Brinley's reply was curt. "No need. I can manage it myself."



Setting the phone facedown on the desk,she returned to the proposal before her.



Meanwhile, in the top-floor conference room at Palmer Group headquarters, Colin sat restlessly.


For days, he had tried every possible way to get close to Brinley, yet he hadn't managed to see her once.


Now, with the bid drawing near, he had no choice but to return for this crucial meeting.



"This project will be Palmer Group's highest priority over the next three years," Colin said to the board members. "The development district director has already acknowledged that our proposal is in close alignment with the city's long-term planning."



Several board members nodded in agreement. The marketing director added confidently, "Mr. Palmer,we've already poured thirty million into the land assessment. Our network and connections are firmly established."



Colin gave a small nod, quite relieved.



He flashed a self-assured smile as he glanced around the room. "Palmer Group is set on winning this project."



It was then that someone remarked, "By the way,I heard Brinley has registered a company called VantagePath Realty and is preparing to bid as well.And now that she's Austin's wife,she might carry more weight than expected..."



The attendees were all aware of what had happened at the Knight family's banquet, and the complicated history between Colin and Brinley was hardly a secret.



Every eye flicked toward Colin.


He chuckled dismissively. "Relax. She's just an ordinary woman. What could she possibly know about real estate development? Most likely, that company of hers is nothing but a shell she set up on a whim."


Still, the thought of Brinley made him shiver slightly.



"She always shows up wherever I am. Perhaps she's just trying to get my attention again," he said lightly.


When the executives heard this, they relaxed. They were well aware of how Brinley had once defied her family for Colin. Somehow, she was now Austin's wife.



They all believed there was more to the story.


Yet, as long as she didn't threaten the Palmer Group's grip on the project, they had no reason to be concerned.



Three days later, the bidding venue buzzed with anticipation.



Colin sat in the front row, speaking in low tones with the development district director, but his eyes kept straying toward the entrance.



He was waiting for Brinley.
###Chapter 12 How's Austin Treating You
The moment Brinley appeared in a fitted white suit,Colin clenched his fists tighter.


She stood tall, looking composed and confident.


She looked nothing like the soft, naive woman he had once known.



"Next, VantagePath Realty."



When her company's name was called, Brinley strode to the podium and began her presentation without delay.



The 3D model projected on the screen turned slowly,clearly displaying the intricacies of her design and integration plan.



"Our innovative spatial planning can increase land use efficiency by 30 percent," Brinley concluded.



The moment she finished, the room burst into applause.


Her delivery was polished and professional, every data point seamlessly connected to the government's requirements, each design stage presented with flawless clarity.



Colin was no longer smiling.



He found it difficult to reconcile this poised strategist with the Brinley he remembered. Even more startling was her command of urban planning. She even responded to technical questions with ease, in areas his seasoned team of experts usually had to debate over at length.



"Next, the Palmer Group."



Colin forced down his unease and mounted the stage,beginning his presentation. But by the third slide, the development district director chimed in, "Mr. Palmer,VantagePath Realty's proposal is clearly superior to yours."



Colin blanched, a thin sheen of sweat forming at his temples. He opened his mouth to protest but quickly realized there was no point. Compared to Brinley's,his proposal fell short, especially in interpreting and applying policy.



"The committee has reached a unanimous decision,"the director announced. "VantagePath Realty's proposal best aligns with Bleron's development plans The contract will be awarded to VantagePath Realty."



Thunderous applause filled the room. Colin shot to his  feet,his chair screeching loudly against the floor.


He glared at Brinley, who stood on stage with a calm,composed smile as she shook hands with the director.



Watching her smile and carry herself with such grace struck Colin like a physical blow.



After the meeting ended, he intercepted her in the corridor.



"Why?" he rasped. "You knew how important this project was to me! Was this all just revenge? Fine,take the project! I don't care about anything else; just come back to me..."



Brinley regarded him with a cold, almost amused expression, as though he were a stranger. "Mr.Palmer,VantagePath Realty won fairly. This project was never yours to grant; it was mine to earn. What you should be asking is why the Palmer Group failed."



With that, she turned on her heel, leaving him behind.



The click of her heels against the hallway floor struck Colin like a heavy blow, leaving him breathless and aching.



That evening, Brinley returned to Hillcrest Villa.


 
The satisfaction of winning the bid had washed away her tiredness. "You are back." Austin's voice floated from the living room.



He sat on the sofa, a stack of documents in hand. In recent days, they had both been so busy that they had rarely seen each other.



Brinley acknowledged him with a nod as she bent to change her shoes, her eyes unintentionally catching on the glimpse of his collar left slightly open. "You're home early today."



Setting aside the documents, Austin rose and came toward her.



Tonight, he wore a grey casual outfit that softened his appearance.



"Congratulations," he said, a faint smile on his lips."Securing this project means VantagePath Realty has a promising future ahead."



Brinley smiled, "Thank you."



Austin stared at her for a moment before changing the subject. "We talked about visiting your father.When would he be available?"



The reminder made Brinley tense slightly; the matter had completely slipped her mind. "My dad's been very busy lately... Maybe in a few more days," she replied.



Austin seemed to see through the excuse, but he didn't push. "No hurry."







Later that night, as darkness settled over the villa,Brinley remembered Austin's earlier words.



She curled herself into the beanbag chair in the attic,her phone in hand, her finger hesitating above the contact labeled "Dad" before finally pressing the dial button.



After two rings, a familiar, jovial voice answered the phone. "Well, if it isn't the CEO of VantagePath Realty!The workaholic finally has time to call her father?"


A smile tugged at Brinley's lips. "Dad, I've just secured a project for my company."



"That's good to hear," Brandon Shaw replied. Then his voice turned stern. "Now tell me,how's Austin treating you? Is he bad to you?"



At the mention of Austin, Brinley felt a tug in her chest.


 
"No. Actually, he's suggested visiting you. He's even  talking about arranging a wedding ceremony." She sounded casual as she added, "I just wanted to know when you might be free."



There was a silence on the line for a moment.



Brinley could almost picture her father rubbing his chin in thought.


"I'd love for you to come visit," Brandon replied, his voice softening, carrying a hint of warmth. "But I still haven't forgiven you for what happened with Colin."



Brinley felt a sudden ache in her chest.She knew her father's words were harsh, but beneath them lay nothing but love.



"Dad, I was foolish back then..."



"Alright, enough," Brandon said, interrupting her gently. "No need to drag up the past. How about next Saturday? I'll be available then."



He hesitated before adding, "Just so you know,your brothers are tied up with their own work and can't attend. Hope you don't mind."


Brinley let out a small laugh. "Dad, I don't mind.They've got their own responsibilities. It's only a meal;it doesn't matter if they're there or not."



She was well aware that her brothers were constantly busy, always away with their own commitments, and over time, the family had simply grown used to their absence.



"That's good," Brandon said warmly. "And tell Austin he better not come empty-handed. I'll be expecting a gift."



"I'll remind him," Brinley said, chuckling.


After ending the call, she felt relieved.



No matter his scolding, her father's love was constant and unconditional.
###Chapter 13 Are You Doubting Me
The next day, Brinley had just finished her work when Austin's call lit up her phone.



"Are you free tonight? Let mne take you somewhere to relax."



A moment passed before Brinley nodded with a tender murmur. "Alright."



By eight o'clock, Austin's sleek car rolled to a stop outside a renowned, upscale revolving restaurant in Bleron.



When he stepped out and opened the door for her,the night breeze lifted strands of her hair and carried a sharp hint of citrus that brushed against his senses.



Inside the elevator, as the city lights blurred below them, Brinley tilted her head toward him. "What made you suddenly want to take me out?"



Austin turned, his eyes steady and unreadable. "You're my wife," he replied with quiet gravity."It's only right that I treat you to dinner."



Her lips curved into a light laugh. "You really do have  the sweetest way with words, Mr. Moore."



Over dinner, conversation flowed easily between them -from the grind of daily work to her long-held dream of pursuing design at university.



What startled her most was how deeply Austin seemed to know her past-right down to the obscure award she had once received at a design exhibition.


"You really do... know a great deal about me," she murmured, setting her knife and fork aside, her gaze steady yet questioning.


Austin tilted the bottle, pouring her a measure of red wine, the candlelight dancing in the depths of his mesmerizing eyes.



"It isn't hard to learn about someone," he replied,offering no further explanation. Lifting his glass, he beamed, "Cheers."



Their glasses touched with a soft chime.



The velvet wine coated her tongue,rich and lingering.She lowered her eyes, concealing the faint swell of emotion in her chest.



Kindness without motive was something she had never expected from anyone outside her family. So when Austin showed her gentleness, she couldn't help but question what he truly wanted. When the meal ended, Austin drove her back to Hillcrest Villa, his presence steady beside her as the night closed around them.



As they pulled up, his phone buzzed-his assistant's name flashing on the screen.



Austin slipped out of the car, circling around to open Brinley's door with practiced ease. "There's an urgent problem at the company. Head upstairs and get some rest," he told her gently.



She gave a light acknowledgment before walking back into the villa alone.



While moving through the quiet corridor, her gaze caught on the study door.



Memories of dinner-of how Austin had known intimate details about her past-flashed across her mind, stirring a restless curiosity that pushed her closer.



The handle turned easily. The door yielded without resistance.


The moment she stepped inside, a subtle blend of cedarwood and lingering ink filled her senses.


Walnut shelves lined the walls, packed tight with volumes of every size. Brinley drifted through the room, her hand trailing over the spines until, at the far corner, her fingers brushed against a board that felt strangely out of place.


A flutter rushed through her chest. After a moment of hesitation, Brinley pressed down gently.



A sharp click echoed in the quiet room.



Instead of ledgers or company secrets, a hidden compartment revealed a single scroll, carefully wrapped in protective paper.



Drawn by curiosity, she unfolded it-and her eyes flew wide in shock.



It was her own early sketches from the national design newcomers' competition, the work she had submitted back in her sophomore year.



The memory of this set of drafts was etched sharply in her mind.



On the night of the exhibition, a sudden blaze had devoured her booth, reducing every original sketch to ash. She even lost the USB that contained her copy.



She had resigned herself to believing her work was gone forever,yet here-tucked away in Austin's study -the designs had reappeared like a ghost from her  past.



The pages were tinged a soft yellow at the edges,but they remained astonishingly well-preserved.


"What are you doing here?" A voice, cool and unhurried,broke the silence from the doorway.



Brinley's fingers jolted, nearly letting the fragile pages slip.



She turned in alarm to find Austin leaning casually against the doorframe, somehow back.



His jacket had vanished, leaving him in a crisp white shirt, the cufflinks undone so his forearms flexed with lean muscle.



In the glow of the study's warm light, the faint scar on his wrist gleamed pink, catching her eye.



His appearance nearly gave Brinley a heart attack-how did a man that tall move without making a sound?


"Mr. Moore?" Brinley jerked in surprise, hastily tucking the sketches behind her back, her pulse quickening."Didn't you say you were heading to the company?"



Austin arched a brow as he stepped into the room,his movements silent, as though he drifted rather than walked. "I left a file behind." His eyes slid toward her hidden hand, and a faintly amused curve touched his lips "Enjoying yourself in my study?"



Heat crept across Brinley's cheeks, unease pricking her before she stiffened her spine. "I was only looking around," she countered quickly.



Drawing the sketches out with deliberate defiance, she lifted her chin. "But hiding my sketches-don't you think that crosses into invading my privacy?"



Austin's gaze lowered to the papers. His expression remained steady, unbothered, as if she'd been holding nothing more than a stack of invoices.



"I found them by chance." His voice was calm,detached, almost lazy. "They had a certain spark.Thought they might tie in with a project at Moore Group."



"Oh?" Brinley's eyes narrowed, a faint edge sharpening her tone. "Since when do you pay attention to university students' designs?"



"Anything with potential tends to draw my attention,"Austin replied smoothly, his voice low as he reached for the sketches. His fingers deliberately grazed against hers.



The accidental touch made her flinch as though she'd brushed a flame. His quiet laugh followed. "What's wrong? Something bothering you?"



Brinley tightened her grip, rolling the sketches and pressing them firmly against his chest. Her chin tilted upward in defiance. "Well, it feels like more than coincidence that the designs you admire happen to belong to me."



His gaze dropped to her hand against him, his Adam's apple bobbing once before he suddenly closed the distance.



She stumbled back until the edge of the desk stopped her retreat, trapping her between its hard corner and his tall frame.



The air shifted-cedar and clean linen wrapped around her senses. From this closeness, she could even trace the faint shadows his lashes etched across his cheek.



"It does feel like quite the coincidence." Austin's tone dropped lower, weighted with an almost suffocating force. "Tell me, Brinley-are you doubting me?"
###Chapter 14 | Can Deal With Colin Myself
With a quiet curve of his mouth, Austin stepped in closer,sending a flicker of nervousness through Brinley.



She realized that she should not have entered his study without his permission in the first place-her intrusion had been reckless.



"I..." Her teeth caught her lower lip, her earlier boldness draining away. "I was only asking."



Austin's gaze lingered on the flush at her ears and the faint tremble of her lashes, his eyes narrowing with quiet intent.



Without warning, he lifted his hand and brushed the stray lock from her forehead,the movement unhurried,almost tender.



Brinley faltered mid-breath, bracing for something more, until his calm voice broke the tension. "The study's rather cold. Why don't you rest upstairs?"



The coolness of his fingertips against her skin somehow set her cheeks ablaze. She bobbed her head in a hurried nod and almost bolted from the study.



Behind her, his low, resonant laughter followed her into the hallway, curling around her like smoke she couldn't escape.



Once in her bedroom, she pressed her back against the door, her pulse drumming so fast it rattled her ribs.


It struck her then-Austin had been toying with her from the start. Every word, every subtle glance had been calculated to tease her, to savor her discomfort.


"That infuriating man..." she muttered under her breath,indignation tightening her chest.


In the days that came after, she slipped out of sight whenever he was near, dodging him with quiet determination.



If he lingered over breakfast in the dining room,she carried her plate upstairs to eat alone in her bedroom.


When he sprawled on the living room sofa, leafing through thick stacks of documents, she'd invent a company emergency to escape the villa.



Even on the narrow staircase, when their paths collided, she ducked her head and hurried past,refusing to acknowledge the flicker of amusement glinting in his eyes.



Austin noticed her unease but didn't call her out on it,choosing instead to let his smile curve deeper each time she darted away.



The situation continued until Saturday morning, the day of their planned visit to her father.



Brinley checked her phone and saw Austin's message flash across the screen. "Are you good to go? We're leaving at ten."



With a huff, she raked her fingers through her hair and shot back a curt "Yes" before heading to her wardrobe to pick something suitable.







The sleek luxury car glided down the road toward the Shaw Mansion, but the air inside felt heavy with tension.



Brinley kept her gaze fixed on the passing scenery,making it clear she had no interest in small talk with Austin.



When her phone suddenly lit up with her younger brother's name, she seized on it like a lifeline and quickly answered.



"Hey,Felix?" Felix Shaw's bright voice burst through the line,underscored by the rumble of engines somewhere in the distance. "Brinley! I just heard overseas-Colin dumped you, didn't he?"



Brinley froze for a heartbeat, then let out a soft,helpless laugh. She hadn't yet told her brothers about what had happened with Colin.



Racing had always been Felix's obsession. From the time they were kids, he had dragged her across tracks around the world,teaching her the basics.



In the end, she'd outpaced even her mentor, her natural talent eclipsing his lessons. Her victories in the underground circuit were too dazzling, though, so she never breathed a word of them to him-always hiding behind an alias when she competed.



When she got together with Colin, Brinley gave up the chase of the rush, silencing her urge to fly down the track. She hadn't raced in years.



By the time she came back three months ago,her brothers had been scattered abroad. Reaching them had been impossible.



Brinley had held back, knowing it wasn't the right time to bring up the subject.



Felix's unexpected call meant he'd finally stolen a moment away from his international races to check in.



"No need to worry. I'm doing fine," she murmured softly.



"Fine?" Felix's tone cracked like a whip. "That bastard swore he'd treat you well for the rest of your life! And now he dares to toss you aside? That son of a bitch really begging for death?"



In her mind, Felix was already storming through the racetrack's locker room, fists clenched and temper blazing.



"It's all behind me now," she murmured, her voice low."And... it wasn't him who ended things."


She quickly ran through the whirlwind of the last three months-her marriage to Austin, Colin's constant harassment,every tangled detail.


"Felix, I was so stupid before. I'm sorry."


The silence on the other end stretched so long she thought the line had cut out.


Then she heard him inhale sharply, his voice rough but tightly restrained. "What on earth are you even apologizing for?" He hesitated for only a beat before his voice burst out, brimming with lighthearted relief."That's perfect! To hell with him! That piece of shit should've been dumped where he belongs a long time  ago!"



The outburst caught her off guard, dragging a laugh from Brinley.


"But Brinley..." Felix's voice hardened again,seething with fury. "Colin actually dared to hurt you? Damn it!I'll request leave from the team and grab the first flight home. I swear I won't rest until I make that asshole pay!"


"No, absolutely not!" Brinley cut in quickly, her voice firm yet coaxing. "I can deal with Colin myself. You need to stay focused on your races-don't let this distract you."



She spoke with gentle insistence,calming him little by little until Felix finally relented. Though he agreed not to fly back right away, he still vowed to make Colin regret ever crossing her.


When the line went dead, Brinley finally noticed the vehicle slowing to a halt at the Shaw Mansion's imposing front gates.



"Felix really looks out for you," Austin noted warmly as he stepped out first, his voice carrying a quiet gentleness while he held the door open for her.



She gave a small nod, unbuckled the seatbelt, and slid from the car. Drawing in a steadying breath, she started forward-only to feel Austin's hand close firmly around her wrist.
###Chapter 15 Visiting Brandon



Brinley tilted her head, curiosity flickering in her eyes."What are you doing?"


Austin's hand slid into hers, their fingers locking with practiced ease, as if they had rehearsed the gesture countless times.



"In front of your family," he murmured, his gaze dropping to her with a teasing spark, "we've got to look convincing. You wouldn't want your father getting the idea we can't stand each other,right?"



Her attention dropped to their linked hands. His palm was firm and warm, the rough edges of his calluses grazing her skin in a way that sent a quiet steadiness through her chest.



She considered tugging free, but his low voice followed, calm and deliberate. "Don't you want your father to feel at ease?"



Brinley exhaled hard and rolled her eyes, but she didn't pull away.


In the end, she decided there was no harm in letting him hold on. After all, it was hardly worth making a fuss over. Almost against her will, her fingertips brushed over the calluses in his palm.



The warmth of his skin surprised her-steady,grounding, almost pleasant. Her gaze lingered a moment longer; he looked effortlessly handsome,and even his hands carried a quiet strength she found hard to dismiss.



Austin caught the subtle motion, a flicker of amusement tugging at the corner of his lips, though he offered no comment.



Just as they stepped into the entryway, a thunderous voice rolled from the courtyard, shaking the quiet.


"Felix,you hear me? Run that race abroad and give it your best! Come back with a trophy-and drive safely!"



Her father's scolding made Brinley's lips curve into a smile.



Following the sound, she spotted Brandon standing beneath the leafy grape trellis, phone clutched to his ear,his heavy brows drawn together. "Brinley's affairs aren't your problem," he barked into the receiver."Austin's the one taking care of her now, and he's a million times more reliable than you."



Felix's muffled protests carried faintly through the receiver,but Brandon only snorted and snapped into the phone, "And how exactly is Austin less reliable than you? Enough already! Keep running your mouth,and I'll cut your allowance right off!"


He jabbed the button to end the call, then turned and spotted Brinley and Austin. His face instantly hardened into a mask of stern authority. "Oh. You're here."



The act didn't even last three seconds. His expression softened, and he beckoned Brinley over with a gentle wave. "Sweetheart,come here."



Austin lingered nearby, quietly entertained by how quickly Brandon's demeanor shifted.



Brinley slipped forward and hooked her arm through Brandon's, flashing him a playful smile. "Dad, were you yelling at Felix?”



"Serves him right," Brandon huffed, puffing up his chest. "That reckless brat knows nothing but charging headfirst without thinking."



Then he bent closer, lowering his voice to a hushed whisper. "By the way,Felix wired you a hundred million.It's all yours to use however you want."


Brinley was caught off guard. The next moment, her phone buzzed in her hand.



A quick glance confirmed her hunch-it was a transfer notification from Felix. His note read, "Spend it however you want. If it's not enough, just tell me. And if Colin dares to bother you again, I'll fly back and wreck his company myself!"



Shaking her head, she typed back with helpless amusement, "Got it. Focus on winning your race."


Not far away, Austin lingered quietly, taking in the warmth between Brinley and Brandon.



For all of Brandon's bluster and harsh words, the fondness in his eyes betrayed him every time he looked at Brinley.



Catching Brinley's unguarded smile, Austin felt his own lips curve before he could stop them.



Only when Brandon finally turned to him did Austin step forward.With both hands, he offered the velvet gift box he'd been holding. "Mr. Shaw,this is my first visit. I brought a small token-please accept it."


Brandon accepted the gift without openingit,his gaze sweeping over Austin with deliberate authority."That's very kind of you. My daughter got a stubborn streak. If she gives you trouble, I hope you'll let it slide."


The words carried a veneer of courtesy, but beneath them lay the quiet concern of a father wondering how his son-in-law would treat his daughter.



Though the Shaw family commanded respect,they still trailed behind the Moore family, whose influence stretched across both politics and business.



With most people, Brandon might have been more affable,but when it came to the man who married his daughter,he preferred to probe.


Austin dipped his head slightly, his voice steady with sincerity. "Brinley's incredibly thoughtful. Having her as my wife makes me the lucky one."



After a brief pause, he went on with quiet conviction,"I know how deeply the Shaw family cherishes her.I'll make sure she's cared for, and I won't allow her to endure any grievances."



His calm assurance struck the balance between deference and resolve, revealing respect for Brandon while making clear his own unwavering stance.


Brandon studied him for a long moment, and when he found only sincerity in Austin's eyes, his stern expression softened into a rare smile. "Good! Come inside-the food's already on the table."


Clapping Austin warmly on the shoulder, he guided him toward the main hall.



Trailing after them, Brinley noticed how deferential Austin looked beside her father, and an odd flutter stirred in her chest. A man who could dominate boardrooms and lead an empire was here showing such patience and courtesy,like any ordinary son-in-law intent on earning his father-in-law's approval.


During the meal, Brandon struck up a conversation with Austin about business affairs.



Austin listened attentively, offering a handful of sharp,measured insights at just the right moments.



He carried himself with calm restraint, neither flaunting his knowledge nor bending too low.



From her seat at the side, Brinley lowered her gaze,watching his composed demeanor with a heart that grew increasingly complicated.
###Chapter 16 You Really Know How To Turn Me On



Brandon walked Brinley and Austin to the door after dinner, his expression stern as he clapped Austin on the shoulder. "Take good care of my daughter."



Austin met his gaze steadily and said with quiet sincerity, "You have my word."



The ride back carried a different air-lighter, free of the earlier tension.



As streetlights and buildings blurred past the window,Brinley leaned against the glass, her heart still holding the warmth her father had left there moments before.



Breaking the silence, Austin's voice cut in, teasing."Tell me,have you been avoiding me lately?"


Brinley's stomach lurched, but she forced a calm smile."Why would I? I've been drowning in work-l can hardly breathe, let alone make time to avoid you."



Tilting his head, Austin leaned in, closing the space between them in an instant.



The subtle scent of cedar clung to him, warm and clean, while his eyes glimmered with amusement. "Is that so?" he murmured. "Funny, though-every time I'm in the living room, you suddenly remember urgent overtime. And on the stairs, you always bolt past me with your head down. Doesn't that sound a little suspicious?"



His breath skimmed across her cheek, sending her pulse racing.



Up close, his appeal was almost disarming-the sharp line of his nose, the curve of his mouth, and those fathomless eyes that seemed intent on unraveling every secret she tried to hide.



She tore her gaze aside, struggling for composure."You're reading too much into it. I've just been..really busy."



"Really?" His voice dropped, husky with an edge that pulled at her. "Because I can't shake the feeling it's about what happened in the study..."



"No!" she blurted, cutting him off, heat rushing to her cheeks.



Refusing to linger on the subject, she fumbled for an escape. "We're home-let's get out!"



Without waiting, she all but bolted from the car,retreating into the villa.



Austin's eyes lingered on her retreating figure as he  let out a quiet chuckle, his gaze softening with unmistakabletenderness.



Back within the villa's walls, Brinley still felt frustrated about her hasty escape.



Why did he always manage to keep the upper hand?The more she dwelled on it, the more her irritation grew, until she silently swore she'd seize the upper hand at the very next chance.



From behind her came his calm, unhurried voice. "The pool is freshly maintained. Want to give it a try?"



She spun around to find him leaning lazily against the stair railing, a knowing smile playing at his lips, as if he'd caught her thoughts.



A flicker of determination surged through her chest."Fine," she answered, her tone brisk."Let's go."



Minutes later, dressed in her swimsuit, Brinley stepped out to the poolside.



Austin was already there, running a towel through his damp hair.



A loose white towel clung precariously at his hips,showing the sculpted lines of his back and the hard ridges of his abdomen.



Beads of water traced the dips of his muscles,sliding  downward until they vanished at the towel's edge,sketching an outline that was almost too enticing.



Her pulse quickened despite her effort to remain composed.Determined not to let his presence rattle her,she walked steadily toward the pool's edge.



"You've been watching me for three minutes straight,"Austin drawled suddenly, his voice laced with playful tease.



Brinley blinked at the sudden remark but kept her face serene. Rising on her toes, she let her fingertips skim across his hard abdomen, her voice lilting with playful provocation."With a body like this, you could easily walk a runway."



Her hand lingered at his Apollo's belt, brushing the taut warmth there before she added with a sly smile,"Though I have to say-touching it feels even better."



Austin's Adam's apple shifted with a swallow, his gaze sharpening.



He reached for her wrist, only for Brinley to slip away with a quick flick



Arching a brow, she tilted her head at him. "Isn't this exactly what you like? Then why the sudden blush?"



Without giving him a chance to respond, she turned sharply, her silhouette trailing like a final stroke of elegance.



Austin stayed where he was, watching her retreat with a shake of his head.



His gaze dropped to the towel drawn taut across his hips, and he let out a low, self-mocking laugh before striding to the poolside shower and twisting the knob to unleash a rush of icy water.



Upstairs, Brinley pressed her back to the closed door of her room, her heartbeat racing as if she'd just run a mile.



Even she hadn't expected her daring move at the pool.


Her fingertips brushed the heat in her cheeks, the image of Austin's sculpted body and the ripple of his muscles beneath her touch replaying vividly in her mind.



A muffled cry slipped past her lips, and she quickly clapped her hands to her burning face.


Why the hell was she so easily tempted by Austin's looks?



Her breathing gradually evened out. The flustered gleam in her eyes hardened into determination.


She gave herself a stern reminder not to falter. Colin had once been the same-lavishing her with affection, making her feel as if she'd discovered love that would last.



Yet in the end,his half-hearted wavering between her and Milly destroyed everything, leaving only misery behind.



Austin seemed more reliable than Colin, but who Ccould say what schemes hid behind his calm exterior?



It was a marriage of convenience, a fact she could never allow herself to forget.



Brinley shook her head as if to scatter the jumble of doubts.



She drifted to the window, where the last light drained from the sky, her feelings a tangled knot she couldn't quite name.



Meanwhile, Austin stepped from the cold shower,droplets clinging to his skin as he faced the mirror. His cheeks still carried a faint flush.



With a helpless smile tugging at his lips, he muttered under his breath, "Brinley, you really know how to turn me on." ###Chapter 17 Is Just Touching Enough For You



As night draped over Hillcrest Villa, the house glowed warmly with light.



Brinley slipped inside after a long day at work,but the moment she opened the door,her breath hitched.



Austin stood in the living room, bare-chested, his muscles rippling as he moved through a weight training routine.



Under the glow of the chandelier, his skin gleamed,sweat tracing down the ridges of his back before vanishing into the waistband of his low-slung workout pants.



His jaw was tight with exertion, his breaths rough but steady, the veins along his arms stark against the swell of muscle.



A sharp flutter rattled through Brinley's chest.



She had seen him composed in sharp suits, relaxed in casual attire-but never like this, stripped of clothes and unguarded, every line of his body speaking of strength. Her eyes lingered helplessly on the sculpted lines of his shoulders, the hard definition of his abs, the smooth flex of his back.



Rooted in place with one hand still on the doorknob,Brinley could only stare, caught in the moment as though spellbound.



Just then, a sharp metallic clang shattered the quiet.



The dumbbell slipped from Austin's grip, crashing against the floor with a sharp clang that jolted Brinley back to herself.



"Careful!" she blurted out.



Her body acted on instinct, hurrying forward to steady him.



But before she reached the weights, strong arms swept her close.



Her spine pressed against the hard wall of his chest,and his damp heat surrounded her, his breath carrying the raw edge of exertion and sweat brushing against her neck.



"I'm exhausted," Austin murmured, voice husky, his face buried in her hair as his hold tightened around her waist. "Let's rest a little." The tip of his nose grazed her earlobe, sending a shiver racing down her back



Brinley froze in place, her thin blouse clinging as the heat and sweat from his chest seeped through,raising goosebumps across her skin.



"Austin, you..." Her protest faltered the moment her palm met the slick firmness of his abs.



The taut muscles flexed beneath her trembling fingers,making it impossible to push him away.



It only took a moment before her composure returned.She twisted sharply, her knee digging into his side with practiced precision.



Austin grunted, and in that instant of weakness,she seized the opening-rolling him flat onto the yoga mat.



Settling astride his waist, Brinley gripped his arm, her fingers squeezing the firm swell of his biceps. An eyebrow arched as she teased, "Mr. Moore, playing at being helpless with muscles like these?"



Flat on the mat, Austin met her gaze with a flicker of amusement in his teasing eyes.



The fading sun streamed through the windows,catching in her hair, softening her sharp beauty into  something almost luminous



Brinley dipped closer, her lips near his ear, her voice drawn out and deliberate. "But I must admit, those lines... they're sculpted like a fashion model's body."


Her hand slid down the length of his arm,fingertips tracing every contour until she felt his body tense under her touch.



The intensity in his stare thickened, fierce and unyielding.



With a swift motion, he reversed their positions,pinning her beneath him against the mat.



His arms braced on either side of her head, his face lowering until the bridge of his nose hovered a breath from hers.



Their breaths tangled in the narrow space between them, and mischief flickered so vividly in his eyes it was almost tangible



His hips pressed forward, the taut muscles of his abdomen grazing her waist. His tone dipped into a low challenge. "Is just touching enough for you?"



"You!" Brinley's sharp cry broke out as she jerked her knee upward toward his stomach.



But Austin was quicker.He caught her ankle mid-strike,  his grip like forged steel


She twisted, trying to break free, yet his hold didn't budge an inch.



"Let go of me!" Her cheeks flamed red, her voice edged with fury.



Instead of releasing her,Austin leaned closer, his body heat surrounding her like an inescapable cage.



Her pulse raced as she found herself staring at his face only inches away-lashes dark and thick, nose finely carved,lips shaped with infuriating perfection.



As her thoughts scattered and her frame froze, she forgot to move aside. Yet Austin came to an abrupt stop.



Instead of stealing the kiss she'd braced for, he reached out and brushed a feather from her hair,one she must have picked up when tumbling onto the pillow earlier.



"There's something in your hair," he murmured in his usual even tone, as though the heat in his gaze moments ago was just something she'd made up in her head.



He straightened and glanced down at Brinley sprawled on the mat. An eyebrow arched, his lips tugging into a smirk. "So, are you planning to move in down there?" The remark jolted her back to herself. Color rushed to her cheeks, creeping hot all the way to her ears.



She scrambled up, smoothing her rumpled blouse with quick, embarrassed motions, then shot him a glare."You did that on purpose!"



"What do you mean?" Austin pressed, tone innocent but eyes glittering as he dragged a towel across his damp skin. Mischief curled in his expression. "You're the one who couldn't stop staring at me while l worked out-and then went diving straight into my arms."



"I am not staring at you!" Brinley shot back, her temper flaring as color rose in her cheeks."I was just walking past! And why on earth are you working out in the living room instead of using the gym? What's wrong with you?"



"The AC in the gym broke," Austin answered evenly.His eyes lingered on the curve of her flushed earlobe,his lips tugging into a faint smile.



"The AC is broken?" Brinley echoed, eyeing him skeptically. "Why does this place have so many issues?Maybe you should think about getting a new villa altogether."



Austin didn't bother responding, content to study her indignant expression.The longer he stared, the more unsettled she felt,Brinley turned away sharply and stomped toward the dining room, determined to ignore him



She hurried through a few mouthfuls of dinner,but her thoughts kept circling back to the image in the living room-Austin's sweat-slicked skin, the heat of his breath brushing her face, and that teasing glint in his eyes.



Abruptly, she set down her knife and fork with a clatter, pushing back from the table as if fleeing a battlefield. Without a glance behind her, she escaped up the stairs to her bedroom. 
###Chapter 18 You Dared To Slap Me!
Brinley slammed the door shut and slumped against it,dragging in shaky breaths.



After a long pause, she forced herself into the bathroom and splashed cold water over her face.



The reflection staring back had flushed cheeks and wide,unsettled eyes.



Her palm pressed against her chest, as if she could slow the frantic pounding beneath her ribs.



There was no denying it-any woman would have been shaken by that kind of lethal charm and physique.



Austin knew exactly what he was doing. He reveled in watching her lose composure.



Brinley shook her head hard, as if she could scatter the tangled thoughts clouding her mind. Sleep didn't come easily; she tossed and turned before exhaustion finally pulled her under.



With tomorrow's business gala ahead, she knew she had to get some decent sleep. Since walking away from Colin, she had come to understand a hard truth-no man's affection could rival the pull of ambition.



A career's triumph was far more intoxicating than fleeting romance. She had vowed to shape her own destiny, never again sacrificing her future for love.


The following evening, the business gala unfolded beneath dazzling chandeliers, the glow casting the hall in the splendor of a grand ballroom.



Brinley arrived in a custom black mermaid gown,sequins along the hem scattering light with each graceful step.



As she made her debut as CEO of VantagePath Realty,her polished makeup and composed elegance seized every glance in the room.



The guest list brimmed with Bleron's entrepreneurs,making the event influential yet not entirely exclusive



Among the crowd, only a select handful from the city's inner circle carried the knowledge of her connection to Austin.



Across the room, Colin arrived with Milly at his side.His gaze locked on Brinley the moment he entered.



He had heard she would attend, and that alone   been reason enough to come.



In truth, he hadn't planned on bringing Milly, but she had insisted-and he hadn't managed to refuse her



Milly had chosen a white dress styled to echo Brinley's old eleggance, a calculated attempt to imitate her former softness. But against Brinley's luminous poise,Milly's effort looked cheap and artificial.



"Colin, let's.. let's head over there," Milly whispered tightly, clutching her handbag so hard her nails nearly punctured the leather.


Colin's silence stretched on, his focus pinned entirely to Brinley. She looked more dazzling than ever-like a diamond he had once held in his hand, only to let it slip away.



Brinley paid no mind to the lingering looks cast her way. She held her champagne glass lightly and stood at the terrace's edge, serene and untouchable.



"Ms. Shaw, are you all by yourself?" a man's voice drawled behind her.



She turned, her gaze falling on a middle-aged man with a sagging belly and an oily grin.



She didn't recognize him; he clearly wasn't from any family of consequence. His eyes roved over her with a greasy boldness before he let out a low chuckle. "Nice to meet you. l am Rogelio Scott. Running a company of that scale must be exhausting for someone as young as you."



Brinley inclined her head with a courteous nod and shifted just out of reach. "You're flattering me, Mr.Scott. VantagePath Realty thrives because of the team behind it."



"What team can measure up to a dependable man?"He pressed, leaning closer until his pudgy fingers nearly brushed her arm. "If you were with me, you wouldn't have to work so hard."



Dropping his voice, he added with a hushed murmur,"I can give you more than yoursugar daddy ever could."



The hum of conversation dimmed; a few onlookers turned openly curious stares their way.



Her expression chilled, lips curving into a smile as brittle as glass.



Staring at his oily face, she couldn't help recalling the ridiculous gossip that once painted her as some young woman climbing through an old man's bed. The thought alone made her want to laugh.



"I'm afraid you've mistaken me," she replied aloofly,her words cutting deep.woman of my league is  nowhere near within your reach."



Rogelio barked out a laugh as if she'd just entertained him. "Ha! Everything has a price, Ms. Shaw. Just say the number." His hand lifted, thick fingers reaching to pinch her chin. "Stay by my side, and the entire Scott Group could be yours."



A brutal smack shattered the air, silencing the hall in an instant.



Brinley's palm hovered mid-swing, her fingers tingling from the impact.



Rogelio clutched his burning cheek, his eyes flashing with shock before twisting into rage. "You dared to slap me?!"



"What's wrong with that?" Brinley shook out her stung hand, her gaze slicing through him like steel. "Look at you-pathetic,oily, and shameless."



Rogelio's face contorted as he rolled up his sleeves,preparing to lash back-until someone abruptly stepped between them.



Colin blocked Rogelio's path. Though he did not want to cross him, he still stood up for Brinley. "Mr. Scott,laying hands on a woman hardly suits a gentleman."



Recognition flickered across Rogelio's face, then dissolved into a sneer. "Mr. Palmer? I didn't expect you  to play the hero."



His eyes raked over Colin with contempt. "With Palmer Group's stock in freefall, you still have the nerve to meddle in other people's business? Better worry about your own crumbling empire first."



The moment the words landed, Colin's face twisted crimson with fury, his fists balling so tightly that his knuckles whitened.



A sharp retort hovered on his tongue, but the memory of Palmer Group's precarious state silenced him,leaving only frustration in his chest.



Rogelio, seizing on Colin's hesitation, lashed his wrath at Brinley. "And you! Don't fool yourself into thinking a pretty face makes you exceptional. At the end of the day, you're just a woman! What could you possibly accomplish, you pathetic whore?"



Brinley's glare turned lethal as she demanded,that again, I dare you!"



Before the insult could leave his mouth, Brinley's leg snapped out, striking the back of his knee.



Rogelio crumpled with a startled cry, collapsing onto the polished floor.



In one swift motion, she seized his tie and yanked him down further, pressing his cheek against the floor with unflinching force



Her voice was low, edged with deadly certainty."|"L make sure you learn what respect really means."
###Chapter 19 She Is My Wife



A tense silence settled on the room.



Everyone watched the unfolding drama, disbelief scrawvled on their faces.



Who would have imagined that the sweet and soft-spoken Brinley could have such a sharp, unrelenting side?



Standing a little distance away, Colin felt his chest tighten with tangled emotions.



The fierce, confident woman before him was nothing like the shy Brinley he had once known, the one who had always looked at him with timid admiration.



That Brinley would never have dared raise her voice,yet here she was, handling a difficult situation with such finesse.



The guests were still recovering from the drama when a stir rippled through the entrance of the banquet hall.


Austin ambled inside, flanked by bodyguards. He looked dangerous and intimidating.



Glancing across the room, he caught sight of Rogelio,who looked disheveled and trembling. Then he glanced at Brinley. Her gown was slightly out of place,yet she stood tall and dignified.



Austin's eyes had a menacing gleam in them.



"It's Mr. Moore!" someone gasped in awe.



Ignoring the whispers around himn, Austin walked straight toward Brinley



Without asking a single question, he slipped off his jacket and laid it gently across her shoulders. He then turned and flung a murderous glare at Rogelio.



"Mr... Mr. Moore..." Rogelio stammered, his voice quivering uncontrollably. He now looked pale and terrified. "It's... it's all a misunderstanding... nothing more..."



Austin didn't even bother to acknowledge him.Instead,he spoke in a low, decisive tone to his assistant,Miguel Barnes."Throw him out."



Then, glancing around, he announced coldly, "From this moment forward, Moore Group will be targeting every single project run by Scott Group."



The words hit like thunder, drawing audible gasps as faces paled all around



Rogelio's knees nearly buckled. He tried to plead,but the bodyguards had already dragged him away "Mr. Moore, please! Have mercy! I was wrong!"



His desperate cries echoed down the corridor until they vanished, leaving the hall swallowed in an eerie silence.



Every head turned back toward Austin and Brinley,stunned.



They knew well enough. Austin never made idle threats. Scott Group was finished.



Colin stood rooted in the crowd. He had watched Austin wrap his jacket around Brinley's shoulders protectively. A bitter ache stirred deep within him.



He longed to step forward, to say something,but his legs felt heavy, as though shackled to the floor



What right did he have anymore?



Beside Austin, Brinley felt the shelter of his tall frame,a sense of safety creeping over her.



Seeing Rogelio hauled away in disgrace and the once -lively hall frozen in fear,she could only smile wryly in amusement.



She glanced up at Austin's face and asked softly,still bewildered, "Why are you here?"



After all, Austin almost never appeared at such public events.



"Because you're here," Austin answered simply, as if it were the most natural thing in the world



Colin's chest throbbed as he watched them both act intimate.



Just moments earlier, he had entertained the foolish thought that he could play her savior



Yet compared to Austin, he looked pitifully powerless.



The orchestra resumed its playing, but the vibrant chatter had vanished, replaced by hushed murmurs.



Those who had been oblivious about Brinley and Austin's relationship now understood.



And with understanding came respect and caution.Brinley was no longer someone they would dare provoke.



One bold reporter seized the moment, stepping forward nervously. "Mr. Moore, may I ask... Who is this lady?"



Opportunities to question Austin in person were rare,and no journalist would let it slip by.



"She is my wife, Brinley Moore," Austin replied without hesitation. He paused,sweeping his eyes over the hall, his voice firm and resonant. "My wife and I share a profound bond, and I warn those harboring hidden intentions not to waste their time with cheap tricks. Anyone who dares to lay a hand on my wife will findthemselves standing against the full power of Moore Group."



The words slammed into Colin like a heavy blow.



The seasoned businessmen present understood the message immediately. One by one, they approached Brinley to express courtesy and goodwill.



Milly's face had taken a sickly color as she instinctively clutched Colin's arm, but he shook her hand off.



Despite his turmoil, Colin forced his way toward Brinley. With a stiff smile, he said, "Brinley, don't you remember how your throat always troubled you every summer? I had someone prepare the special drink you used to like. Would you..."



"Thank you for the thought, Mr. Palmer." Austin stepped in, his voice polite yet cold. "But I'll take care of my wife's needs. There's no need for you to trouble yourself."



His eyes then flicked toward Milly. "And Mr. Palmer,perhaps you should direct more of that concern toward your wife." He paused deliberately, smirking. "Wait, my mistake,"he corrected himself smoothly. "The lady beside you isn't your wife yet,is she?"



Milly blanched, her complexion chalk white.



Colin stiffened, as though struck by lightning, his fists clenching tight.



Brinley grabbed the opportunity, slipping her hand around Austin's arm. With a polite but cold smile,she said, "Mr. Palmer, my husband doesn't enjoy socializing. If you'll excuse us, we'll be leaving now."
###Chapter 20 Your Cooking J ust Keeps Getting Better 
Colin remained rooted to the spot, his gaze lingering on Brinley's retreating figure, eyes shadowed with unwillingness to let her go.



Beside him, Milly noticed the desolation etched on his face,a pang tightening her chest.


She slipped her fingers around his sleeve, tugging lightly as her voice trembled with practiced gentleness. "Colin, my stomach feels a little off... Can we leave now?"



Her words pulled him back to the present. Meeting Milly's fragile, almost pitiful expression, his hardened stare eased.



"Let's go home," he murmured at last.



He placed a steadying hand on her shoulder,guiding her out of the hall.



Days later, the Hillcrest Villa carried the scent of simmering broth and freshly chopped herbs.



In the kitchen, Brinley moved briskly between stove and counter, her sleeves rolled, the clatter of utensils filling the air



The real estate project, which had been slated to launch in the year's second half, had suddenly hit a roadblock. The Housing and Urban Development Department had put it on hold, citing a missing quality assessment report.



Since the approval process was bound to stall for a while, she gave her staff an early holiday, keeping only a handful on duty at the company



The oven's timer rang out, cutting through the moment.



Brinley tugged on an oven mitt and pulled out a tray of cookies, their edges blackened and bitter-smelling With a sigh, she dumped the ruined batch into the trash.



Stuck at home with nothing to occupy her, she had started dabbling in recipes, but every attempt ended in disaster.



Yesterday's mushroom soup had been so salty it was inedible, and now today's cookies were nothing but charred crumbs.



"Need a hand?" Austin's voice suddenly drifted in from behind her.



He strolled in wearing casual clothes, damp hair still tousled from a shower



Brinley turned just in time to see him head straight for the counter. He plucked up one of the less-destroyed cookies, cracked it open, and inspected it with mock seriousness. "Wow, these are... something else. What do you call them? 'Charcoal briquettes'?" he teased.



"If you're hungry, there are sandwiches in the fridge,"Brinley grumbled, clearly annoyed. She snatched the cookie from his fingers and tossed it into the bin, then tore off her apron with a scowl.



From the moment the project was suspended,she observed Austin returning home earlier each day, even spending entire weekends sprawled in the living room with company files scattered around him.



On top of that, the villa's chef and housekeeper had both been placed on a medical leave by Austin just the week before.



Now,as she watched him casually sample the lopsided slices of fruit she'd just struggled to cut, it dawned on her-he'd orchestrated this on purpose.



"Actually," Austin remarked, spearing a chunk of apple and chewing with deliberate leisure, "I think your cooking has a kind of everyday warmth to it."



He arched a brow, a playful gleam flickering in his gaze, before adding, "Honestly, it's more satisfying  than a Michelin three-star dinner."



Brinley rolled her eyes. "I know it's bad. Your comfort is unhelpful."



She folded her arms, narrowing her eyes as he polished off the last slice of apple and even dared to sip her bitter melon drink.



His oddly glowing review made her frown.stin,did you lose your taste buds?"



He froze mid-motion, plate in hand, before breaking into a laugh.



Crossing to the counter, he brushed his fingers across the flour smudges on her blouse, speaking with sincerity. "It's not every day I find you cooking in the kitchen. As your husband,I should at least act grateful."



To prove the point, he grabbed a piece of charred toast and bit into it, not a flicker of discomfort on his face. "A satisfying crunch followed by tender flavor.I've got to admit, not bad."



She stared as he swallowed the blackened bread without a blink, the corner of her mouth twitching."If you enjoy it so much, I'll whip up some charcoal-grilled avocado with pickled herring tomorrow."



She waited for him to flinch. But Austin only curved his lips into a calm smile. "Now that sounds like a challenge. I'll be looking forward to your masterpiece." As he turned toward the door, he tossed back casually. "By the way,the melon you've been craving is in the fridge. Don't forget to have it."



Throughout the next several days, Austin continued turning up to eat with her.



Brinley, restless and reckless in the kitchen, churned out one strange dish after another-braised pork glazed with both sugar and salt, yogurt sprinkled with chili flakes instead of sugar, even weirder combinations after that.



No matter what landed on the table, Austin ate it without flinching, sometimes even shooting her a playful thumbs-up, praising her with a grin. "Your cooking just keeps getting better."



On the fifth evening, when he polished off her chocolate chili ice cream without hesitation, Brinley finally blurted out, "Do you actually enjoy torturing your taste buds?"



Her blunt words shattered the soft glow of their candlelit dinner like glass underfoot.



Austin, however, remained calm. He dabbed the corner of his mouth with his napkin and met her gaze with an easy smile. "For me, it's an honor to eat  anything you've made yourself."



Brinley faltered, words sticking in her throat.



She excused herself to clear the dishes and slipped into the kitchen, pulling out her phone to dial Austin's assistant. "Miguel, I need to ask-what is Austin like at the company?"



Miguel's tone brimmed with reverence. "Just today,Mr. Moore tossed out a competitor's proposal during the board meeting and said, 'This garbage isn't even worth bidding.' The poor representative was so rattled he nearly collapsed from low blood sugar. And last week? He had a business partner who deliberately broke a contract and was sued into bankruptcy-the summons have already been delivered."



The man Miguel described-a ruthless, decisive figure feared in boardrooms-felt like a stranger compared to the one who sat across from her, calmly praising her terrible cooking.



The more she dwelled on it, the more uneasy she became.



Austin's reputation was built on ruthlessness, yet he seemed almost delighted by her failed culinary experiments. He had even sent the servants away just to make sure she cooked for him herself.


 
A shiver traced up Brinley's spine. Whispers shehad once dismissed about the hidden games of wealthy families now crept back to mind.



Could Austin's marriage to her be part of some deeper,secret agenda?
###Chapter 21 A Nightmare



Brinley couldn't shake the absurd thought that Austin might be gravely ill-perhaps battling some hidden disease that required a lifesaving organ transplant-and she was a perfect match.



The idea slithered down her spine, leaving goosebumps in its wake.



Scenes from melodramatic soap operas flickered through her mind, where marriages of convenience masked sinister plots for organ harvesting.



What if Austin had a secret illness and needed her organ to survive?



As his legal wife, wasn't she the most convenient donor?



"Something bothering you?" Austin's voice broke her spiraling thoughts as he stepped inside.


Catching sight of her pallor, he reached out to check her forehead. Brinley flinched away, dodging his touch so quickly she nearly stumbled.



Her eyes dropped to his long, refined fingers, and her imagination betrayed her-those hands no longer belonged to a businessman but to a surgeon gripping a scalpel. Panic jolted through her, and she backed into the kitchen counter with a sharp thud.



"N-no, it's nothing!" She forced a brittle smile. "I just feel exhausted.I'll head upstairs to rest!"



Before Austin could say another word, she turned and fled to the second floor.



He lingered there, his hand frozen mid-air as he watched her hasty retreat.



A faint crease formed between his brows.



Why on earth was Brinley acting so strangely?



Later that evening, she lay restless in bed,tossing beneath the sheets. Her thoughts tangled with the image of Austin calmly chewing her burnt cookies,overlapping with Miguel's description of the merciless CEO who crushed rivals without blinking.



The more she dwelled on it, the colder her skin felt,until fear dragged her into a nightmare.



In the depths of her dream, Austin's smile warped into something sinister as he came after her, a scalpel gleaming in his hand.



"You monster, Austin!" she shouted in her sleep,thrashing against invisible hands. "You're after my kidney?! I swear, I'll fight you off!"


Her arms flailed wildly, nearly toppling the lamp on her bedside table. She cried out again, her voice ragged with desperation, "There's nothing I want from you,yet you're greedy enough to want my kidney!"


Beneath her room, Austin lay awake, her strange behavior earlier gnawing at him. When her muffled cries drifted down the staircase, he threw on a robe and hurried upstairs.



Pushing open the bedroom door, he found Brinley twisted in the sheets,her face damp with sweat,brow drawn tight.


She mumbled frantically, words tumbling out in broken fragments, "Kidney... my kidney... Austin,give it back..."



He froze beside the bed, staring at her tormented expression. A helpless sigh slipped from his lips before he leaned down, brushing her clammy forehead with careful fingers.



The instant his touch grazed her cheek, her eyes snapped open.


Panic flared in them as she recoiled wvith a piercing scream. "Ah! Austin! You really came to steal my kidney!" The room was cloaked in darkness, and under the silver wash of moonlight, his face appeared both shadowed and inscrutable. Only half of his features showed, the rest swallowed by darkness, perfectly matching the sinister figure that had haunted her dream.



Brinley thrashed back in a panic, her hands and feet tangling in the sheets until her spine hit the headboard.Her wide eyes brimmed with fear.


Austin, watching her frantic retreat, felt a pang of amusement laced with frustration.



He clicked on the bedside lamp, the warm glow chasing away the eerie shadows, then eased himself onto the edge of the bed. Softening his tone, he murmured, "Brinley, it's alright. You were caught in a bad dream."



"Bad dream?" Her lashes fluttered as she blinked,gaze darting between the familiar walls of the bedroom and Austin's steady face.Realization finally dawned-it had only been a nightmare.


Relief escaped her in a shaky breath, but embarrassment rushed in to replace it, her cheeks flaring crimson.



"You were mumbling in your sleep..." Austin shot her a look, his raised brow full of playful provocation."I  was after your kidney?"


If the bed could have sucked her down into its depths,Brinley would have welcomed it.



The absurdity of the dream, combined with his crooked half-smile, left her squirming with embarrassment.



"Um, I was just rambling nonsense," she stammered,her voice shaky and meek. "Some... stranger was chasing me." She forced herself to stay composed,lifting the blanket as if to leave the bed. "It's late.You should head back to your room."


Austin's brow arched, his expression making it clear he didn't believe her.



His gaze lingered on her reddened ears and wide,uneasy eyes, already guessing what had flustered her.


Instead of pressing, he gently eased her back down and pulled the blanket up around her shoulders. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow, tell me what you want to eat.I'll have Miguel buy whatever you need."


"There's no need!" Brinley blurted out, her voice a touch too sharp. "I can take care of it myself!"



Watching him leave, she clutched her heated face in both hands. Once inside his room, Austin slouched against the door, a grin tugging at his lips.


Kidney? What in the world was running through Brinley's head?



Shaking his head, he picked up his phone and sent a message to Miguel. "Go through Brinley's recent searches. See if there's anything about organ transplants."



Miguel immediately texted back, "Mrs. Moore's recent search history includes 'high-society organ trade scandals'."



Austin read the message, rubbing his forehead with a sigh.



Clearly,he'd need to have a talk with Brinley tomorrow -before she convinced herself he secretly worked as some underground organ trafficker.



Meanwhile,Brinley lay cocooned under the covers,her cheeks still burning as the nightmare replayed in her mind.



Damn it! She had made a fool of herself in front of Austin!



By morning, the atmosphere at breakfast was stiff.Brinley sat quietly spooning porridge, her lashes lowered, while Austin watched her from across the table, his fingers absently tracing the rim of his porcelain bowl.



"Do you have time this morning?" His voice carried clearly in the hushed dining room. "I'd like to talk-about last night. We..."



Brinley froze mid-motion, the spoon hovering.Without meeting his eyes, she muttered, "It was just a dream.Nightmares happen. Don't read too much into it."



The memory still made her squirm, so she ducked her head and forced down her porridge faster, as though speed alone might keep the conversation at bay.
###Chapter 22 Try My Cooking
Brinley could feel the weight of Austin's gaze.



Austin was ready to speak, but seeing the stiffness in her posture and the resistance written across her face,he swallowed his words.



Breakfast passed in silence.



No sooner had she set her bowl down than Brinley rose quickly from her seat. "I should check on the hydrangeas in the garden; they looked like they were wilting a few days ago."



Without waiting for his reply, she hurried from the dining room, as though escaping something.



Outdoors, her eyes drifted involuntarily toward the second floor of the villa.



Austin's study lay to the east, its curtains drawn halfway, leaving the room's interior hidden.



The complicated thoughts that had plagued her earlier surfaced again.



Ever since she had caught sight of those old items connected to her, her heart had been restless.Somewhere in that study, she felt, lay answers Austin kept carefully concealed.



He had wanted to talk to her this morning, but she had no intention of facing his subtle questions. Better to sneak into the study first and see what she might discover.



When the gardener bent over the rosebushes,distracted with his shears, Brinley slipped quietly through the side door of the villa.



The living room was empty. Austin might still be in the dining room.



Moving cautiously, she crept up the spiral staircase to the second floor.



Her heart thudded as her fingers closed around the study's doorknob. It turned easily; it wasn't locked.



Brinley pushed the door open just enough to peer inside,then slipped in and shut it behind her, leaning against the cool wood to release a tense breath.



She scanned the room urgently.


This time, she told herself, she would find out what Austin was hiding.



The study looked even more orderly than before.


She checked everywhere-the drawers, the shelves, even the neatpile of magazines beside the lamp.


Not a single piece of paper related to her remained.


The clippings from her university design exhibition that she had glimpsed last time were gone, erased as though they had never existed.



Austin had deliberately removed everything related to her.



"What are you looking for?"



The sudden voice made her jump. In a panic, she shoved the drawer shut and spun around, only to bump into the bookshelf. Several heavy books toppled down.



In one swift motion, Austin steadied her by the waist with one hand and caught the falling boooks with the other.



The heat from his hand seeped through the thin fabric of her blouse, sending a tingling shiver across Brinley's skin.



"N-nothing," Brinley stammered, retreating quickly,her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her blouse. "I was just... looking around."


Austin's eyes flicked to the disturbed stack of magazines, his eyes betraying that he had noticed,but  he chose not to question her.


He calmly put the books back on the shelf. "There's really nothing worth your attention in here. Perhaps





"I have something to do. I'll head back to my room,"Brinley blurted, cutting him off before he could finish.She darted out, practically fleeing.


Even as she rushed down the hall, she could feel his eyes heavy on her back,piercing her.


This man was so annoying.


He was certain her curiosity would compel her to look,so he made sure to remove all clues. It left her feeling as though her curiosity were a game he was watching her play.


Back in her room, she slumped into the chair at her vanity, her reflection staring back at her, flustered and unsettled.



Their marriage of convenience felt like a fog, and Austin's unreadable behavior only deepened the mystery.


She picked up her phone and scrolled to her father's number.



Her finger hovered above the call button, but after a long hesitation, she pressed the screen dark.


Some conversations, she thought, would need to happen face-to-face.


Later that afternoon, something occurred in the kitchen that left Miguel utterly stunned.


Austin was standing at the counter in an apron,frowning in concentration as he flippedthrough a cookbook.



Miguel could barely believe his eyes.



Who would have imagined that the same man who silenced boardrooms with a single glance was now clumsily stirring and chopping in the kitchen, strapped in an apron?



"Mr. Moore, if you want to surprise your wife, a professional chef could come over..." Miguel offered cautiously.



"It's different," Austin said, plating a piece of seared foie gras and topping it with truffle shavings. His movements lacked polish but were deliberate. "She eats restaurant food all the time. I think...she might like something homemade."



Miguel could only shake his head in silence.



Austin was clearly set on doing this himself. Miguel helped where he could, though he couldn't stop imagining the uproar this would cause if the powerful business world of Bleron ever found out.



By five o'clock, Brinley had changed into comfortable clothes, ready to slip out unnoticed from the villa.



She deliberately avoided the kitchen, but fate had other plans. At the foyer, she ran right into Austin, who was carrying a bottle of wine.



His crisp white shirt had a stain at the cuff, and there was even a dab of cream on his nose.



For once, his normally flawless appearance softened into something approachable, yet still deeply attractive.



"Where are you going?" Austin leaned casually against the cabinet, twirling the bottle of Lafite in his hand,blocking her path.


"I'm visiting my father," Brinley said uneasily,trying to hide her bag behind her back.



He replied with a raised brow, "I've made dinner. Eat with me first, then I'll go with you."


Brinley hesitated, grasping for an excuse. "That's...not necessary." "Try my cooking," Austin said, his tone brooking no refusal. He took the bag from her and set it on the cabinet. "Miguel's gone, so it'll just be the two of us."



The anticipation in his eyes left Brinley momentarily speechless. She wanted to say no, but she swallowed it back.
###Chapter 23 It's Not Terrible
Brinley trailed Austin into the dining room, her gaze catching on the lavish spread waiting on the table.



Golden-seared foie gras glistened beneath a drizzle of fig sauce, lobster sprawled across a bed of garlic-slick vermicelli, a bowl of pumpkin soup shimmered like liquid velvet, and rosemary-scented lamb chops released a mouthwatering aroma that curled through the air.



Every dish looked flawless, a cruel contrast to the charred and oversalted failures she had scraped together in the kitchen over the last few days.



Austin pulled out a chair with deliberate grace,his smile tinged with teasing challenge. "What are you standing there for? Sit down and see for yourself."


Brinley sank into the seat with stiff reluctance, hands folding in her lap, the polished silverware left untouched. "I'll pass. I'm not hungry."



Her voice carried a quiet defiance, her wary eyes fixed on the feast as though it were a carefully baited snare instead of a meal.


The search in the study had yielded nothing, leaving  kindness he kept showing her.


"Just one bite." Austin slid the utensils back toward her, his tone softening into patient coaxing. "If it's awful,you can throw the plate at my face."


The corner of her lips nearly curved at his ridiculous offer, but she caught herself, muffling the spark of laughter with a low, noncommittal hum that served as her reluctant surrender.



Her fingers finally curled around the utensils,every motion taut with resistance.



She carved off a sliver of foie gras, pausing so long it seemed she might set it down again, before slipping it past her lips.



The crisp shell yielded beneath her bite, releasing a rush of velvety oil that coated her tongue, its butery richness cut with the delicate sweetness of the sauce,surprisingly light instead of cloying.



Her eyes flew wide without her realizing, the flavor still dissolving as her gaze darted over the plate,already hunting her next morsel.


Never had she imagined Austin could sharpen his culinary craft so dramatically in a matter of days.



"So?" Austin asked, his smile easy as his gaze lingered on her parted lips. "It's fine," Brinley mumbled, stubborn pride sharpening her voice-even as her hand betrayed her, fork sliding right back down to snag another bite. She popped it into her mouth, chewing faster this time, like her resolve was unraveling with every savory chew.


Her gaze strayed to the lobster. That was all it took.Discipline snapped. She reached for it without a second thought.


After devouring the lobster, she went straight for the pumpkin soup, dipping her spoon in with eager precision. Then came the lamb-sliced into neat pieces, each one polished off in seconds beneath a drizzle of pepper sauce.



Her puffed cheeks gave her the look of an overeager chipmunk,strangely adorable as she stuffed bite after bite with zero concern for appearances.



The woman who'd insisted she wasn't hungry now ate with the abandon of someone who hadn't seen food in days.


Before her, the feast that once looked curated for royalty was vanishing by the second. She bent over her plate with single-minded devotion, as though nothing existed beyond the flavors claiming her senses.


 
Across from her, Austin remained still, his gaze never leaving her face.


The amusement in his eyes deepened, watching her stiff resistance melt into uninhibited appetite, her lips glistening with sauce, her eyes alight with unguarded joy.


After a long stretch of silent indulgence, she finally raised her head to meet his steady stare.


Color surged to her cheeks. She fumbled for a napkin,nearly knocking over a glass in her flustered haste.


Muttering under her breath, she shot him a sidelong glare. "Why are you looking at me like that..."


Austin gave a low chuckle and slid a glass of water toward her. "Slow down. It's not like anyone's going to snatch it from you."


Brinley shot him a sharp look, yet still lifted the glass and sipped, hiding her embarrassment behind the rim.


When she set it down again, her gaze skimmed over the half-empty plates, and warmth rushed to her cheeks-she might have looked like someone who hadn't eaten in days.


"I guess... it's not terrible," she muttered, forcing out the reluctant compliment, her ears glowing scarlet.


Austin let the lie pass without comment. Just as he reached for the ladle to serve soup, his phone vibrated sharply against the table.



He glanced at the screen, his expression tightening. In an instant, his voice hardened as he answered. "Have the legal department draw up the papers immediately.I'm on my way."


The call ended, and he looked at Brinley again, the sternness in his tone replaced by something gentler."Something urgent came up at the company. I'll need to step out."



"Alright," Brinley murmured, her eyes drifting back to the lamb chops she'd been carving into tidy slices.


Austin slipped on his suit jacket, pausing at the doorway. He glanced over his shoulder, catching sight of her eating with quiet focus, and the corner of his mouth lifted almost unconsciously. "Take your time and enjoy it."



The heavy click of the villa's front door left the room echoing with silence. Alone at the long table, Brinley stared at the untouched dishes, her appetite fading as quickly as it had come.



She had been so certain Austin's attentiveness carried ulterior motives. Yet now, with him gone, an inexplicable hollowness pressed against her chest.


Letting out a faint sigh, she reached for the bowl of  pumpkin soup he had left untouched. Cradling it between her hands, she tipped it back and drained every drop in one steady motion.
###Chapter 24 You Shameless Rogue!
Brinley cleared the dishes, then sank into the sofa,her mind wandering before she finally pulled out her phone and dialed her father.



The call connected almost immediately, and Brandon's warm, buoyant voice filled her ear. "Brinley,what's got you calling your dad tonight?"



"I need to ask you something," she said, drawing in a steadying breath. "What's really behind this arranged marriage to Austin?"



On the other end,silence stretched for a beat.



When Brandon finally spoke, his tone had shed its cheer. "Brinley... there are things you're old enough to hear now." He hesitated, as though weighing each word, then continued with a grave slowness, "That winter, Austin's mother-Selene Moore-was in a devastating car accident. Your mother risked her life in the pouring rain to drag her back from death's door.Out of gratitude, Selene had gone so far as to suggest a marriage alliance between the two families.You're the only daughter in our family, and the only fitting partner the Moore family could offer was their  youngest son, Austin1."


Brinley's breath caught, her fingers curling tight around the phone as if anchoring herself.


"All these years, the Moores never pursued any other match for Austin," Brandon went on, a weary helplessness threading his words. "Because they've been waiting for you. Even when you were with Colin,Austin's father, Westley Moore, came to me personally.He said that if you ever changed your mind,the arrangement would still be honored."



A sigh slipped from Brinley, soft but laden with resignation. So that was the truth behind it all.


She reclined against the sofa cushions, eyes tracing the gleam of the crystal chandelier above her,her chest knotted with a swirl of emotions too tangled to name.



So that was why the engagement had never been dissolved during her two years with Colin. It finally made sense why Austin, of all people, would agree to a union that looked so mismatched.



Everything traced back to that long-ago promise, to the moment her mother risked her life to save another.



Perhaps-Austin's gentlenesstoward her-his overprotective patience and indulgence-wasn't affection at all, but repayment of that unshakable debt.



Once the truth settled in, the storm in her chest quieted at last.



"Dad, I get it now," Brinley said softly into the phone."I'll come by to see you soon."


After the call ended, she let the phone slip from her hand and drew her knees close, curling up on the sofa.



Maybe this marriage wasn't such a terrible thing after all-more like a practical partnership where neither owed the other anything.



Fatigue settled over her like a heavy blanket, and she let out a quiet yawn as her eyelids drooped.



She nestled deeper into the cushions, cheek pressed against the pillow's softness, and drifted off into sleep on the sofa.



She had no idea how much time passed before the faint sound of the door opening stirred the silence.



Austin stepped into the living room and spotted Brinley curled up on the couch.



Her arms clutched the pillow tightly, her face tilted toward the fabric, lost in peaceful slumber. Moving softly across the floor, he leaned down and laid his suit jacket gently over her shoulders.



Brinley stirred in her sleep, curling instinctively toward the comforting heat.



The innocent motion tugged at Austin's composure,and his mouth curved in a quiet,helpless smile.


He lowered himself beside the sofa, fingertips hovering just shy of brushing her cheek, lingering in the air as though afraid to break the spell,before pulling back.



"How did you drift off here?" he murmured, voice no more than a breath as he slid an arm beneath her.



She was feather-light in his hold, curling against his chest like a small, trusting cat.


But the moment he rose with her cradled in his arms,her lashes fluttered and her eyes snapped open.



"Who is it?!" Brinley's hoarse voice cracked from sleep as she jolted awake, thrashing instinctively.Her elbow slammed into Austin's chest with surprising force.



"It's me, Austin," he grunted, his breath hitching as he tightened his hold to keep her from slipping.



When her eyes finally focused and she recognized him,  relief flickered across her face, quickly replaced by embarrassment. She shoved at him with both hands and feet. "I've got legs of my own; let me down already!"



"Stop moving-the floor's slick," Austin warned, his tone firm.



No sooner had the words left his mouth than his lower back struck the sharp edge of the coffee table with a solid thud, driving a groan out of him.



The sudden imbalance pitched Brinley forward.



For a heartbeat, the world seemed suspended in stillness.



Her lips brushed against Austin's in an unplanned collision.



He stiffened,caught off guard.



He breathed in the fragrance of her hair and tasted the sweet remains of pumpkin soup on her mouth.



That accidental kiss sent subtle tremors through his chest,unsettling emotions he hadn't expected.


Though it lasted only a few fleeting seconds,the moment stretched endlessly, as if time refused to move. Brinley jolted back to her senses, shoving him off and stumbling several steps away, her cheeks burning crimson.



"Austin! You...you shameless rogue!"


She jabbed a trembling finger at him, though her heart was a whirlwind of confusion.



That kiss just now-why hadn't it felt wrong?



Austin didn't move. His hand lifted to his lips, as if the warmth of her mouth still lingered there.



As he watched her flushed, indignant face, a faint spark of amusement flickered in his eyes. "I didn't do it on purpose."



"You call that an accident? And yet we kissed?" Her voice spiked, her chest heaving as her heartbeat thundered against her ribs.


A wild, foolish thought darted through her mind-what if the kiss had gone on longer?



The instant the notion surfaced, she crushed it with merciless self-reproach. "Brinley, have you completely lost it? Actually wishing to kiss Austin even more?"



Brinley refused to glance back at Austin, sprinting up  the stairs as though a pack of wild beasts were nipping at her heels.


Once inside her room, she slammed the door and pressed her weight against it, gasping for air,her heartbeat racing so violently it felt ready to burst from her chest.


She darted into the bathroom and twisted the cold faucet open.



The frigid stream splashed over her trembling hands,sending shivers down her arms but anchoring her thoughts.



Without hesitation, she slipped into the tub filled with icy water, letting the chill bite into her skin, desperate to drown out the reckless flutter pounding inside her heart.
###Chapter 25 Why On Earth Did You Marry Me
 "You're hopeless, Brinley!" Brinley slapped her own cheeks in exasperation. "What on earth was I thinking,actually wanting to kiss Austin again? Stop it! Don't even go there!"



Yes, Austin had the kind of looks and physique that could make anyone's heart flutter, but she had no business letting such thoughts linger.



Just then, her phone, resting on the edge of the bathtub, lit up with a notification.



It was a message from Colin.



"Brinley, are you alright? I regret what happened before. I know it's far too late to be saying this now,but I need you to know l've thought a lot about my mistakes. Even if you never want to read my messages again, I still have to say I'm sorry."


Brinley stared at the screen for a moment before she turned off the screen, her face blank. She had no wish to see anything connected to Colin, let alone his hollow apology



The harm had already been done; just saying he was  sorry could never mend it.



Brinley felt the exhaustion again, and the chill of the bathwater only deepened her dizziness.


Her eyelids grew heavy, and before she knew it, she had drifted into sleep in the tub.



In her dream, she found herseIf reliving those two years with Colin.



They were back in the high-rise flat overlooking the river. Colin lounged on the sofa, but Milly was curled up in his arms, dressed in Brinley's nightgown,her smile coy as she snuggled against him.



The way Colin looked at Brinley was unlike anything she'd seen before-cold,indifferent,almost cruel.


"Brinley," he said softly, his voice strangely tender,"I love Milly. She's the one who truly fitsme,body and soul."



He ran a hand through Milly's hair, glaring at Brinley with disgust. "That's why I never touched you."


Brinley gasped awake, jerking upright in the water,her hair dripping cold against her shoulders.


 
It took her a second to realize it had only been a dream. The first light of dawn was creeping through the window, the bathroom lamp throwing a weak glow across her face.



Still shaken from the dream, Brinley could feel her stomach twist.



Wrapping herself in a towel, she stepped out of the bathroom,heart still pounding.


Her eyes fell instinctively on the liquor cabinet in the living room.



A sudden urge for a drink tugged at her-not to bury her sorrow, but to ease the sick feeling in her chest.



She had just pulled open the cabinet when a deep voice came from behind. "Brinley."



Startled, she spun to find Austin leaning in the kitchen doorway, dressed in loungewear, dark circles under his eyes betraying a sleepless night.


"Why aren't you in bed?" she asked.



"I heard some noise," Austin replied simply, his eyes flicking to the bottle in her hand. He turned to fetch two glasses from the cupboard. "Want a drink?"


Brinley hesitated, then gave a small nod.



"Let's go to the rooftop," Austin suggested,taking the  bottle from her. "The breeze will do you good."



The rooftop garden was alive with roses, their petals glistening faintly with dew. The early morning wind was damp and refreshing against the skin.



Austin uncorked the bottle, filling a glass for her and one for himself, though he didn't drink. He held his glass idly, eyes fixed on the skyline stretching out before them.



Brinley raised hers and downed it in a single gulp.



The rich taste hugged her tongue, its faint bitterness loosening the knot in her chest.


"Is this about Colin?" Austin asked suddenly, his voice wafting with the breeze.



Looking at him, Brinley scowled. "Do you honestly think I'd drink myself silly over an ex?"



"No," he replied with a shake of his head,a solemn expression on his face. "I just think something's weighing on you."



"Spare me the questions," Brinley snapped, snatching the bottle from him and refilling her glass. "If you're not up for keeping me company,you can just go."



Austin said nothing as he watched her take another gulp. He simnply lifted his glass and drank with her in  silence.



Before long, the wine was gone.


Brinley's cheeks glowed red, her eyes starting to wander unfocused.



Normally, she could handle her liquor, but drinking on an empty stomach left her tipsy far too quickly.



"Colin's a bastard!" she blurted out, slurring as she swayed with the empty glass in her hand. "And Milly's no better! Two shameless cheats!"



Austin sat quietly and listened to her wvithout interruption.



"And you!" Brinley suddenly jabbed a finger at him,wobbling slightly. "Austin, you're an idiot! Out of all the women you could have chosen, why on earth did you marry me?"



Austin studied her flushed face and clouded eyes,fully aware she was far too drunk to recall this later.



A faint smile tugged at his lips, touched with helplessness but deepened wit tenderness.



Then he spoke quietly. "I've wanted to marry you since l was fourteen."


Tilting her head slightly, Brinley peered at him and muttered incoherently, "Huh? What was that?"



Austin knew she hadn't caught his words, but he continued anyway, voice low and wistful, "When I was fourteen, at that party in the Moores' house..."



His eyes drifted into the distance, as though seeing beyond the horizon. "It was the anniversary of my mother's death. My siblings cornered me, calling me a curse, a bringer of misfortune..."
###Chapter 26 What A Fool



Austin's voice carried a deep, steely edge that softened only when he spoke of her. "There were countless faces at that banquet, but only you-little braids flying, furious and fearless-stood in front of me and drove my bullying siblings away."



His gaze dropped to Brinley, watching her sway in a drunken haze, emotions flickering in his eyes like a storm barely contained. His words fell so low they were almost swallowed by the silence. "From that moment, I told myself I'd wait for you to grow up...wait until I could make you my wife. I've waited all these years."



Leaning closer, he let his fingertips ghost across her cheek, as if afraid she might vanish if he pressed too hard. His voice turned achingly tender. "And now...you're finally mine."



Brinley blinked through the blur of alcohol, struggling to follow, her lashes heavy with sleep. In theend she only managed a slurred, faint "Mm-hmm," before her body gave out, collapsing helplessly into his arms.



Austin caught her before she toppled, a weary sigh slipping from his lips as he gathered her into his arms. For once, Brinley didn't resist. She instinctively curled against his chest, her cheek pressed to the steady rise and fall of his breathing, her own breaths slowly evening out.



He carried her into the bedroom, lowering her carefully onto the bed. After tucking the blanket around her, he leaned close, brushing a stray lock of hair from her brow.



"Have a nice dream, Brinley," he murmured, his fingertip lingering briefly against her skin as though to reassure himself she was really there.



Austin remained by her side for a quiet moment,watching until her features softened into sleep, then finally turned and stepped away.



Back in his own room, rest eluded him.



A sharp, familiar ache twisted in his stomach,cold sweat breaking across his back.



His brow furrowed as he fumbled through the drawer,shaking out a few pills and swallowing them dry.Yet the pain refused to ease.



Propped against the headboard, he shut his eyes,letting the waves of agony roll through him, enduring it alone in silence. When morning arrived, the shrill chime of her phone dragged Brinley from her dreams.


Half-dazed, she fumbled to answer, only to hear Migual's anxious voice spill through the line. "Mrs.Moore! Do you happen to know where Mr. Moore went? I've been trying to contact him, but nothing's going through, and both offices report he hasn't shown up. He told me he had something crucial scheduled today..


Brinley furrowed at those words. The fog in her mind lifted abruptly, jolting her into clarity.



She barely remembered how she ended up in her bed -only that she had wanted to drink and had run into Austin in the living room afterward.



"I... I'll check right now." she blurted,cutting the call short.


Throwing on a coat, she hurried to Austin's room and rapped on the door, her voice rising, "Austin? Are you in there?"



Silence pressed back at her.



Her heart thudded fastor as she knocked harder "Austinl Answer mel"



Panic spiked in her voins when nothing came back A sick weight was pressing against her ribs. She grabbed the doorknob and twisted, but it refused to turn-the door was locked.



An ominous chill slid down her spine.



Austin was never careless. He lived by strict routine,punctual to the minute, never one to vanish without reason.



Something was wrong.



Without wasting another second, Brinley hurriedto the butler and demanded the code.



Though hesitation clawed at her, she forced her fingers to punch in the numbers.


The lock clicked open with a subdued snap.



She stepped inside for the very first time.


Instead of opulent grandeur, the room revealed severe simplicity-an expanse of black, white, and muted gray that mirrored the man's distant composure.



The vast space held no warmth, almost nothing beyond the essentials.



And then, the figure lying motionless on the bed shattered that frozen solitude. Austin lay stretched across the mattress, his complexion ghostly pale, lips edged with a sickly gray.



Even his usually immaculate hair had fallen into disarray, stray strands plastered to his damp forehead.



His eyes stayed shut, and the faint rise and fall of his chest was so slight it seemed it might stop at any moment.



The spacious bed swallowed his frame,making him look thinner, diminished, almost fragile.


A sharp ache pierced Brinley's chest, spreading like cold needles through her veins.


She had known him at his most commanding, seen his easy arrogance and teasing smirks, but never once imagined this unshakable man could collapse into such weakness.



"Austin?" Her voice trembled as she crept closer.



She reached out, her fingertips brushing his skin-heat seared into her palm,stealing her breath in alarm.



On the nightstand, several medicine bottles lay scattered, one for stomach pills nearly drained.



The cap had rolled onto the carpet, and a trail of white tablets spilled across the floor. Brinley's brows drew tight, her mind replaying every kitchen disaster-the steak blackened to ash, the cream soup so salty it puckered the tongue,the cookies burned beyond saving.



She couldn't stomach a bite of them, yet Austin had eaten each one without flinching.



Now, as she stared at his pale, feverish face, the truth dawned on her: he had been forcing himself to endure her culinary failures all along.



"What a fool," she sighed, shaking her head lightly.



The butler trailed in after her, startled at the sight before him. He fumbled for his phone, dialing Miguel and summoning a private doctor without delay.


Brinley, refusing to just stand there, darted out and returned with the medical kit. She ripped open a fever patch and pressed it clumsily onto Austin's burning forehead, then soaked a towel and began wiping his neck and palms in nervous haste.



The instant the cool cloth met his overheated skin, his lashes quivered hard, a low groan slipping past his lips.



"Austin? Please, wake up!" Brinley leaned closer, her chest tightening as she caught the bittertang of alcohol on his breath. Guilt surged through her. He had drunk heavily with her hours ago, and she had been so caught up in her own drinking that she hadn't noticed his condition worsening.



His eyelids finally lifted, pupils hazy and unfocused,struggling to settle on her face.



After a long moment, he rasped, his voice hoarse and broken,"Why are you here? You should go..."
###Chapter 27 Gastric Bleeding





Brinley snapped, her voice sharp as she slapped Austin's hand away. "Who's supposed to take care of you if I walk out?" Her fingers brushed his skin by accident, catching on the cold sweat slicking the back of his hand, and unease prickled down her spine. "Lie down and stop fighting me!"


"It might be contagious. Stick around me and you'll probably catch it." Austin's words dwindled to a husky murmur, his breath shallow. "You should go..."


Only then did it dawn on Brinley-he wasn't trying to push her away out of stubbornness, but out of fear that he carried something that could infect her.


A laugh escaped her, threaded with both irritation and reluctant fondness, as she pressed his restless arm firmly against the mattress. "Don't be ridiculous.Contagious, really? Try moving again and I'll throw you out myself." Austin's eyes flickered open, a glint of clarity breaking through the feverish haze.


His gaze lingered on her, turbulent with unspoken emotion, before his lashes drooped.


With a weary surrender, he let his arm fall still and finally closed his eyes.


Brinley let out a shaky breath of relief and kept tending to him, her hands moving with a steadier rhythm as she wiped his clammy skin.


Austin's awareness flickered, caught between fog and fleeting clarity.


Each time his heavy eyelids lifted, the blurred outline of Brinley working tirelessly by his side filled his vision.


The sight stirred a quiet warmth in his chest, like a subtle current moving through his chest.


A fleeting smile flickered across his mouth before exhaustion pulled him under again. Miguel soon arrived, the private doctor trailing at his side. This was the sight that greeted them as they stood in the doorway: Brinley darting busily around the bedside, while Austin lay sprawled on the sheets,his fever patch slipping askew, his furrowed brows softened into rare ease.



"Mrs. Moore." Miguel's voice carried as he strode forward, ushering the doctor in.


Startled, Brinley sprang upright, nerves tightening her voice. "Doctor-you're here! Please, check him right away!"



The doctor ran a quick check on Austin before delivering his diagnosis. "Acute gastric bleeding,accompanied by a high fever. He needs to be transferred to the hospital at once."



Brinley's chest tightened, her pulse tripping over itself at his words.



Her disastrous meals were undoubtedly the cause of Austin's acute gastric bleeding. "I'll go with him," she blurted, the words rushing out before she thought. "I know exactly what he's eaten these last few days."



···


At the Moore Group's private hospital, the VIP suite still carried the same sterile chill of its minimalist design that mirrored Austin's bedroom.


Brinley sat rigidly in a chair by the bed, her gaze fixed on the nurse inserting an IV into Austin's arm. The clear liquid dripping into his veins only deepened the knot of worry in her chest.


When Austin stirred awake, she leaned forward, her voice sharp with equal parts fear and frustration."The doctor said it's from eating terrible food and drinking alcohol-no wonder your stomach rebelled."


Her eyes narrowed as she scolded him, "Austin,you're a grown man. Shouldn't you know how to handle yourself? Must you push yourself until you end up like this? What now-are you planning to blame this on me?" Austin's voice carried a teasing edge. "I'm definitely putting the blame on you," he murmured, stretched out on his side, eyes fixed on her.


Though his skin still looked drained of color, the gleam in his gaze burned with a startling brightness.


Brinley's chest gave a sudden jolt. Heat rushed to her face, and she spun away as if his words had scorched her. "I'm telling you now-don't even think about it."



A low chuckle escaped him, but the laugh tugged at his stomach, making him wince and groan.



Her head whipped back instantly, brows furrowed."Stop laughing. Do you even remember you're supposed to be resting?"


Despite her sharp tone, her hand reached out on instinct, tugging at his pillow until it supported him more comfortably.


When her fingertips brushed the side of his neck, the delicate warmth of his skin sent a jolt up her arm. She jerked her hand back, a fiery blush racing up to her ears.



Austin caught every flicker of her reaction.Amusement deepened in his eyes, sparking like sunlight on water as he quietly savored the sight.


The doctor insisted Austin stay hospitalized for at least three more days to recover.


During that time, Brinley ended up becoming his reluctant caretaker.


Guilt gnawed at her-after all, it was her cooking that had landed him here in the first place-so she couldn't just walk away.


Every morning without fail, she stepped into the hospital room with a container in her hands.


Brinley ladled some porridge into a bowl, then set it in front of Austin."Eat."



Austin accepted the bowl, but instead of lifting the spoon, he nudged it back toward her with a fleeting smile. "You haven't eaten either." Brinley flinched at his words, retreating slightly. "I'm not hungry," she murmured, her eyes drifting to the faint marks left by IV needles on the back of his hand.



The sight made her oddly uncomfortable.


He was forced to eat with his left hand, awkward and unsteady because of the IV in his right, but he stubbornly insisted on handling it himself.


"Have a taste?" he asked, lifting a spoonful toward her,his piercing eyes unyielding.


The porridge's warmth curled in the air, and Brinley's heartbeat stumbled.



She averted her gaze, murmuring so softly it barely carried, "Go ahead, eat it yourself."


Austin let the matter drop, chewing slowly while never taking his gaze off her.


Feeling uneasy under his quiet scrutiny, Brinley picked up the stack of documents she had brought with her and pretended to read. Yet, no matter how hard she tried, her eyes drifted toward him again and again.



When the bowl was empty, Austin sank back against the headboard, a tablet propped on his stomach. His fingers glided across the screen with practiced speed as he scanned reports.



Now and then, the phone at his side buzzed. He answered in a low, steady voice that carried effortless authority, settling matters in a few clipped sentences.



Brinley's eyes lingered on his concentrated profile,and in that instant she finally understood-Austin's achievements had never been a matter of luck.



Even lying pale in a hospital bed,he carried himself with relentless drive, his mind fixed on business matters.



"Do you really have to push yourself this far?" she queried, unable to stop herself. "The company won't crumble without you for a few days." Lifting his head, Austin curved his lips into a light,teasing smile. "I'd hate for you to think I can't measure up to your standards."


Her throat tightened, and she turned abruptly,pouring water into a glass to avoid his gaze, though the tips of her ears betrayed her by flushing crimson.


Catching sight of her reflection in the window, she realized she couldn't drift through life in this half-hearted daze any longer.


If Austin could rise this high through sheer willpower,then why couldn't she?


The VantagePath Realty project was stalled, but her ambitions weren't meant to end there.


"When you've recovered, let's set our companies against each other and watch which one thrives more," she declared, returning to his side and setting the glass down with a decisive clink.


Amusement flickered in his eyes. "I'm in."
###Chapter 28 Caught Up In Your Husband's Charm, Are You
 Golden afternoon light slipped through the blinds,casting shifting stripes of shadow across the floor.


Austin sat with his head bowed over the tablet,his gaze skimming across the documents.


Across from him, Brinley studied her own stack of papers, her brows tightening now and then in concentration.


Silence filled the room, but it carried a calm, almost soothing weight.


Austin's attention faltered, his gaze snagging on the mesmerizing outline of her profile.


Sunlight brushed against her face, softening her features. Even the furrow of her brow appeared impossibly captivating to him. Feeling the weight of his gaze, Brinley lifted her head sharply, shooting him a glare. "Quit staring."


A low chuckle slipped from Austin, but he let her scolding stand without an answer.


In the afternoon, there was a video conference waiting for Austin, prompting him to call Miguel for his laptop.


Brinley, intending to give him space, started toward the sofa, but his voice stopped her. "Sit here."


He patted the empty spot beside him on the bed.


Since he didn't seem to mind her listening to his conference, Brinley saw no reason to hold back and took the seat at his side.


Once the meeting began, she lowered her gaze to her phone, though her ears betrayed her, tracking every word.


Austin spoke about a complicated merger with calm precision, his tone steady, his logic sharp. Every so often, he cut in to correct or redirect others, the  authority in his voice leaving no room for dispute.


Brinley sneaked a look at hm. Sunlight skimmed across his lashes, gilding them in gold.


Though ill, his composure held firm-jaw taut, mind sharp-every bit the shrewd strategist he'd always been.


Time slipped by unnoticed until the meeting finally drew to a close.



Austin snapped his laptop shut and caught Brinley staring, her gaze soft and unguarded.


"What's the matter?" he drawled, one brow arched."Caught up in your husband's charm, are you?"



His teasing jolted her back, color rushing into her cheeks. "Who's looking at you? I was thinking about my project!"


He leaned closer, his voice dipping smooth. "Your CloudVista Estates project? Do you want my help?"


The delicate fragrance of her shampoo enveloped him, his warm breath brushing her ear in turn.


Brinley's heartbeat stumbled into a frantic rhythm.


Startled, she jerked backward, forgetting the bed's edge was right behind her. She nearly toppled over.


Before she could fall, Austin caught her wrist and drew her back toward him.



She landed against his chest with a muted thump,the sound punctuated by his faint groan. Only then did she remember-he was still recovering.


"Sorry!" Brinley blurted, quickly bracing her hands on him, eyes full of worry. "Did that hurt?"


Though his complexion drained of color, Austin shook his head. His gaze lingered on her flustered face, Adam's apple shifting as he swallowed. "I'm alright."


She tried to pull her hand free, but his grip only tightened, anchoring her there.


Their eyes locked, and the air seemed to still, her  reflection caught in the dark depths of his stare.Emotion flickered there-layers she couldn't quite name.



The moment shattered when the door opened.Miguel stepped inside, arms full of files.At the sight before him, he nearly dropped everything. "Mr.Moore, Mrs. Moore, I... I didn't see a thing!"


Brinley jolted upright, breaking free of Austin's arms,and hurried across the room. She sank onto the sofa with her back turned, hoping distance might smother the heat rising in her chest.


Austin's eyes followed her retreat, amusement flickering in their depths even as his voice stayed deceptively calm. "What's wrong?"


Only then did Miguel shuffle forward, thrust the folder into Austin's hand, and practically flee.


Brinley remained seated, pressing her palms against her knees until her pulse steadied. At last she risked a glance over her shoulder. Austin was already absorbed in the paperwork again,his profile carved in cool, rigid lines, as though the charged moment between them had been nothing but her imagination.


She gave a small shake of her head, as if that could scatter the tangle of thoughts. Her voice came out stiff when she muttered, "I'Il go see about dinner."


Without waiting for his answer, she slipped out the door, not daring another look back.


Only once the hallway closed around her did she release a long, shaky breath.


Following a brief pause, she gave in and went to warm up another bowl of porridge for Austin.


Lately, his meals had been reduced to nothing but liquid food-three rounds of porridge each day.


This was already the third time she had heated it for him today.


At seven that morning, the first bowl had to be lukewarm, not scalding. By noon, the second one needed to be just right, heated through to perfection.


Now, for the late-afternoon portion, the porridge only required a half-minute of reheating.


As Brinley stepped back into the room, she found Austin propped against the headboard, a stack of documents spread in his hands. His gaze lifted as she stepped inside, and the corner of his mouth curved into a faint smile.


"You don't have to put yourself through all this,"he murmured, turning a page with deliberate ease, his voice roughened by illness. "I'm not that picky."


Brinley shot back, slamming the steaming bowl onto the bedside table, "That was why you had managed to land yourself in the hospital."


She scooped up a spoonful, blew on it until the steam thinned, and held it firmly to his lips. Her voice came out stiff and clipped. "Open up."


Austin didn't budge, his gaze fixed on her instead.


"What now?" Her shoulders tightened under his  silent stare. She pushed the spoon closer. "Come on,eat it before it cools."



At last, Austin parted his lips, swallowing the porridge as its gentle warmth slid down his throat.


His eyes lingered on her, and he found himself oddly thinking that perhaps this bout of gastric bleeding hadn't been entirely pointless.


"Want something else tomorrow?" Brinley asked as she drew the spoon back, dishing out half a bowl for herself. "The doctor said you could try other foods."


Austin arched a brow, a faint smirk tugging at his mouth. "You planning to cook it yourself?"


Brinley swiftly shot him a sharp glare. "Of course not!I'll get someone else to do the cooking!"


She hadn't forgotten her catastrophic attempts in the kitchen. With a quick add-on, she muttered, "Or I'll ask the butler to send something up."


Austin chuckled under his breath, but the movement tugged at his stomach, making him wince and let out a low groan.


Alarmed, Brinley immediately set her bowl down."What is it now?" she asked, her voice tight with worry.


"Just wishing I could eat something you make,"Austin murmured gently.


Brinley huffed in exasperation, "Get well first,then you can chase down every bizarre craving you want."
###Chapter 29 You're Different




Twilight slipped away, and night took its place.


Brinley cleared the last of the dishes and she began considering where she'd sleep.


"I'll stay in the caregiver's room next door," she declared with quiet resolve, scooping up her belongings.


Miguel had already arranged it; the suite-like space next door was comfortable enough for her to rest.


But Austin's expression tightened suddenly, his complexion paling as his breath quickened."My stomach's acting up," he admitted, his voice rough.


Brinley halted mid-step, turning back to him. "Do you want me to call the doctor?"


He gave a small shake of his head, brushing it off,though there was a flicker of fragility in his eyes. "No. It's an old problem. I can manage. Just... if it gets worse in the middle of the night, it's hard being alone."


Her eyes lingered on his bloodless face, and her resolve to leave wavered.


Austin was, after all, a patient. If something did happen...

"There's a call bell in the ward," she pointed out,her tone steady on the surface yet edged with unease.


Austin grumbled with a soft edge of grievance,"That bell's way too loud. I'm not feeling well. All I need is proper rest,nothing else."


Brinley's words caught in her throat; she had nothing to throw back at his argument.

Her gaze shifted from the folded caregiver's bed in the corner to his wide, guileless eyes, and finally she let out a weary sigh. "Fine, I'll sleep on the folding bed."


She told herself there was no difference-sleep was just sleep, no matter the place.


Resolute, she unfolded the narrow frame with brisk efficiency, smoothing out her own sheets and spreading a blanket across it.


Austin's gaze lingered on her small, diligent figure,a flicker of quiet satisfaction flashing through his eyes before he lowered his lids again, pretending weakness.


Night settled thick around the ward, broken only by the rhythmic ticking of the monitors.


Brinley drifted off quickly, her breathing evening out into the steady rhythm of sleep.


After a long silence, Austin's lashes lifted. In the silver wash of moonlight, his gaze lingered on the folding bed.


Brinley lay curled beneath her blanket, her brow faintly knit as though trapped in a nightmare.


Brinley murmured drowsily, her lips brushing against the pillow, "Austin, you jerk... sneaking off with my cookies again..."


A low laugh rumbled from Austin's chest as he reached for his phone on the bedside table. With practiced quiet, he switched it to silent, then angled the camera and captured her sleeping face.


On the screen, a soft crease touched her brows,yet an innocent smile tugged at her lips, leaving her looking almost childlike.


The sight drew him back to that night years ago at the Moore Estate banquet-when she'd been the only one bold enough to stand at his side.


The moonlight then had been just as gentle,wrapping her in silver light, lending her an untouchable grace.


The image on his phone dimmed, but the warmth in his eyes lingered.


Slipping the device back onto the table, he leaned into the pillow and allowed a tender smile to remain as sleep reclaimed him. By morning, the muffled sound of coughing pulled Brinley from her dreams.


She rubbed her eyes and blinked toward the bed.Austin sat half upright, a hand clutched to his chest as a fit of coughs wracked him, his complexion paler than it had been the night before.


Alarm jolted her fully awake. She scrambled to his side."What's going on?"


"It's nothing," Austin said hoarsely, waving her worry away as his breathing slowly evened. His lips curved subtly as he added, "I just need to go to the bathroom."



Brinley took a step back, her finger flicking in the bathroom's direction. "Go on your own."


Austin didn't budge. His eyes stayed fixed on her."Help me."


Her brow furrowed as she retorted, "You didn't lose an arm or a leg."


"I feel dizzy," he countered. He even gave a dramatic sway, as if ready to collapse.


The urge to scream bubbled in her chest,but Brinley bit it back. With no real alternative, she stepped forward and slipped an arm under his.


His skin burned with fever, and the frailty in his body pressed most of his weight against her.


At the bathroom door, just as she tried to pull away,his hand shot out and caught hers.


"Help me..."


Her heart lurched, and her face flamed. "Austin!" She yanked her hand back as if scalded. "Handle it yourself. If you can't, I'll get a male nurse or doctor!"


His expression soured instantly, his frown making his resistance clear."No."


"Why not?" she immediately demanded.


"Because I don't like strangers," he responded, his tone steady. "I hate being touched by anyone else."


Brinley froze, startled by his answer. "Then why do you keep leaning on me?"


Austin took in her fiery expression, a delicate trace of amusement in his eyes, though his voice carried nothing but quiet sincerity. "Because you're different."



Her heart skipped, and the words spiled out before she could stop them. "Different how?"


He didn't speak, only held her in that steady gaze,dark and fathomless.



Unease prickled at her skin. She spun on her heel and stormed toward the door. "Figure it out yourself!Call me only if you're completely helpless!"


The bathroom door shut hard, a barrier slicing the air between them.


Austin leaned back against the cool wall, a low laugh slipping from his throat.


Minutes later, the door creaked open.


He stepped out slowly, hand braced against the wall, his complexion ghostly pale.


Brinley rushed forward, catching his arm, her voice sharp with worry. "I told you to call the nurse! But no -you chose to stay stubborn. And now look at you,suffering and barely able to stand!"


"Don't worry, I'm fine," Austin said, his eyes tracing the flush on her face, a quiet strength stirring in him."With you here, I feel much better."


Brinley was struck dumb, but she quickly guided him back to the bed and eased him down.


"Stay put and quit moving around," she ordered firmly, pulling the blanket up around him, her voice sharp even as relief softened her chest.


Austin's smile widened as he watched her fuss over him.


Her anxious care was exactly what he craved. That raw, unguarded worry made him happy-it was proof she cared.
###Chapter 30 Promise Me You'll Eat Properly

Once breakfast was over, a nurse came in to replace Austin's IV.


His complexion looked steadier, though the pallor hadn't quite left his face.


The moment the nurse stepped out, Miguel slipped inside,carrying a stack of documents.


"Mr. Moore, these need your signature," he informed,setting the papers neatly on the bedside table before lowering his voice. "A handful of media outlets wanted to talk to you this morning about your hospital stay. I shut them down. The Moore family also sent someone to check if you required assistance, but I turned them down for you."


Brinley's ears twitched at the mention, though she kept her gaze locked on the glossy pages of her  magazine, pretending she hadn't heard a thing.


"Got it." Austin's expression didn't shift. He picked up a pen, signing the papers with crispstrokes."Turn them away. Let my father know I'm alright and I'll come back in a few days."


Miguel inclined his head. "Understood," he replied before quietly retreating from the room.


The room settled into silence once more.



Brinley flipped through her magazine a little too loudly, her mind snagging on Miguel's earlier words.


The Moore family... She had only ever read about them in financial reports-an empire sprawling and intricate, far removed from the comparatively straightforward Shaw family.


Once the signatures were complete, Austin became aware of her distant stare. "What's on your mind?"



"Nothing." Brinley snapped the magazine shut and rose to her feet. "I'll get you some water." On her way to the dispenser, her thoughts refused to quiet.


Why on earth had the Moore family merely sent someone to inquire instead of being there to tend to Austin themselves?



The indifference felt strangely cold.


Still, Brinley didn't linger on the thought and brushed it aside.


That evening, just after the nurse finished changing the IV, Austin suddenly tensed, pressing a hand to his stomach with a sharp intake of breath.


Brinley, who was clearing away the plates, spun around at the muffled sound of pain. "Is it flaring up again?"


"Yeah," he muttered, sweat dotting his pale forehead."It'll ease soon."


Not convinced, she rushed to his side, lifting her hand toward his forehead. Before she could touch him,he seized her wrist. A feverish heat radiated from his palm as he gripped her hand hard.



"No need to call anyone," he rasped, his voice rough."I know myself well enough; this isn't a big deal.If the doctors show up, they'll fuss over me, draw more blood, and order another round of tests. Too much hassle."



"But sometimes hassle is necessary." Brinley tried to yank her hand free, but his grip only tightened. "Let go-I'll call the nurse."


"Brinley." Austin lifted his eyes to hers, the haze in them softening his features like a wounded hound."Just stay with me."


The raw plea in his gaze, that unguarded dependence, turned her refusal into a lump she couldn't force out.



She let out a quiet sigh, taking in the drained complexion of his face before lowering herself into the chair by his bed, leaving her hand resting in his. Silence wrapped around them, broken only by the steady beeping of the monitors and the faint rasp of his breath.



A blend of antiseptic medicine and the warm trace of cedar clung to him, strangely grounding rather than unpleasant.



"Did you always have stomach problems?" she ventured, her words reaching to fill the awkward silence.



"It has for years." Austin's eyes dropped to their intertwined hands. "Work devoured most of my time.I often skipped meals, and eventually it turned into this chronic mess."



Her mind replayed images of him in late-night meetings, posture rigid, voice unwavering, his focus unbroken until exhaustion claimed him.


The memory stirred a pang of sympathy within her. It was a stark reminder that even the most unyielding men could be broken by illness. "Promise me you'll eat properly from now on," she murmured, her tone softening. "Don't push yourself past the limit."


A quiet laugh slipped from Austin, but the motion strained his stomach, forcing him to catch his breath.


Brinley stiffened at once. "Does it hurt again?" she asked,her voice tight with worry.


"It's nothing." He gave a slight shake of his head,though the worry in her eyes softened something in him. "With you looking after me, I wouldn't dare skip another meal."


Heat rushed to her cheeks as she snatched her hand back. "Who said I would be looking after you?"


She pushed herself up, reaching over to tidy the plates.


Austin's gaze followed her retreating figure, the curve of a smile lingering on his lips.


As night deepened, Brinley had just unfolded the makeshift bed when a muffled cough drew her  attention.


She looked up to find him staring at the ceiling,a faint crease marring his pale face.


"What is it?" she inquired.


"Just a little chilly." He tugged the quilt higher,his voice even but touched with a thread of weakness."It's probably the antipyretic kicking in."


After lingering for a heartbeat, Brinley crossed to the wardrobe, pulled out a spare blanket, and draped it carefully over him. "Better now?"


Austin cocooned himself in the softness, giving a small nod. "Much better."


She turned back toward her own bed, but his voice followed her, low and sudden. "You toss and turn a lot when you sleep."


At his words, Brinley halted abruptly and looked back at him. "I caught you mumbling in your sleep last night," Austin continued, his mouth curving in a sly grin."And you kicked the blanket so hard you nearly sent the folding bed's rail flying."


Color rushed to Brinley's face, every part of her wanting to vanish into thin air.


She had dreamed last night-of baking cookies that ended in disaster, the oven blowing up in her face.Somewhere in the chaos, she'd been chasing something, maybe even kicking wildly in her sleep...


"You're just making that up," she countered, her voice sharp with stubborn pride. "I always sleep soundly.I don't dream."


Austin casually lifted his phone, twirling it between his fingers before holding the screen toward her with a teasing smile. "Care to see the proof?"
###Chapter 31 No One Can Touch You




"Austin!" Brinley, flustered, darted forward to snatch his phone, but in her rush, she nearly banged into the bedframe.


Austin's reflexes were sharp. He caught her wrist,and with a light pull, she stumbled down, ending up seated right on the edge of the bed beside him.


The closeness made Brinley's senses whirl; she could pick up the faint scent lingering on him,see the playful curve in his eyes, even notice the length and thickness of his eyelashes.


Her heart gave way, hammering wildly, as if it had broken loose from all control.


"Still planning to grab my phone?" Austin asked in a low, deep voice, sounding quite amused.


His warm breath swept past her ear, and Brinley shivered, her skin prickling from the sensation. Snapping back to herself, she yanked her wrist free and scrambled back across the room to the folding bed, diving under the blanket like a turtle retreating into its shell.


"You jerk!" she shouted from beneath the covers.


Austin chuckled at thesight of her curled up like a bundle, his eyes glowing with tenderness.


He set the phone aside, leaned back, and closed his eyes again. The faint smile on his lips remained.


The hospital room had felt like their own little hideaway from the rest of the world for the past three days, even though there were still some interruptions.



The following afternoon, a woman in an elegant suit showed up at the door, introducing herself as a representative of a partner company and asking to see Austin.



Miguel stood firmly at the entrance and replied with a courteous but cold smile, "Mr. Moore is resting. He won't be receiving visitors. I'll pass along your regards."


The woman's lips parted, wanting to say something,but Miguel had already angled his body, signaling her to leave.



The following morning, the Moore family's butler,Caiden Lopez, showed up as well.


He carried a food container in his hands, looking quite concerned. "Austin's father sent me to check on him."


"He's just fallen asleep," Miguel answered, accepting the container with respectful firmness. "I'll deliver his father's regards to him. Rest assured, the doctor said he's recovering well."


Caiden cast a look at the tightly closed door, sighed heavily, then turned and walked away.


Inside, Brinley sat quietly on the sofa, listening to the muffled exchange outside and realizing something.


She flipped through the magazine idly before asking in a casual tone, "Your family situation seems...rather complicated, doesn't it?"


Austin lifted his gaze from the document, studying her."Why do you say that?"


"I saw the butler from the window. His gaze toward the door was meaningful," Brinley replied, shutting the magazine and meeting his eyes squarely."Maybe because with a big, powerful family like yours, there are always relatives hoping to climb higher."


For a moment, Austin was silent, then unexpectedly let out a laugh. "You are actually perceptive."


"So it's true, then?"


"More than half of the Moore family is just waiting for me to fall," he said casually, as if he were speaking about someone else. "What I have is far too enviable."



Brinley blinked at him, taken aback. She'd known wealthy families could be complicated, but this level of ruthlessness was beyond what she imagined. She hesitated and asked in a quieter voice, "I won't get caught up in it, will l?"


Austin caught the wary expression on her face.She looked like a startled kitten, fur bristling defensively,and he couldn't help a quiet laugh.


He put aside the document in his hand and stretched out his palm. "Come here."


Brinley scowled but reluctantly rose to her feet,moving over.


He held her hand gently, the warmth of his touch seeping into her skin, filling her with a sense of safety and assurance.


Staring deeply into her eyes, Austin said in an uncharacteristically serious tone, "As long as I'm here, no one can touch you."


Brinley snorted, tugging her hand back. "Even without you, no one can touch me."


With that, she returned to the sofa, picked up her magazine again, and pretended to bury herself in it. But the faint flush creeping up her ears betrayed her.


Austin continued to stare at her in amusement.


These days spent lying in bed might have been the most restful he had experienced in recent years.


With her by his side, even the pain dulled.


The sunlight pouring through the blinds stretched across the room, scattering warm golden shadows around them.



After spending one more day in the hospital for observation, Austin was finally discharged.


Brinley stood at the gates of Hillcrest Villa, her forehead slightly creased.


"What's on your mind?" Austin asked, his voice rough from illness.


Still weak, he leaned against Miguel for balance,his face pale from recovery, yet his eyes were clear and luminous.


"Nothing," Brinley blurted and turned away, clutching her phone, which still displayed a message from the butler.


It read, "The chef and staff have arrived. Dinner will be prepared according to Mr. Moore's dietary requirements."



She slipped the phone back into her pocket and asked in an airy voice, "What do you feel like eating tonight?"


Austin replied with a smile, "Whatever you cook will be fine."



"Don't even dream of it." Brinley shot him a glare."The doctor said your stomach lining is badly damaged. For the next three months, you're on light meals only. The chef is back, and he'll be handling your food from now on."


She added firmly, "I won't be stepping into the kitchen again."


There would be no more reckless experiments; she couldn't risk endangering him again. Seeing the indignation written all over her face,Austin melted into a smile. He already knew what was in her mind.


Miguel had informed him that after learning her meals had caused his gastric bleeding, Brinley had stood in the corridor outside his ward, muttering for half an hour, "It's all because my cooking is awful."


"Alright," Austin said gently, indulging her. "I'll do as you say."
###Chapter 32 Being My Wife Ties You To The Moore Family
Brinley went straight to the kitchen the moment she returned to the villa, determined to check on how the staff were doing.


The chef was busy at the stove while the servants moved briskly around him, each step efficient and orderly.


The chaos she had once stirred up here had vanished without a trace.


"Please don't worry, Mrs. Moore," the chef assured her, turning with a respectful nod. "Every dish l prepare for Mr. Moore will be soft, balanced, and easy to digest, just as the doctor recommended."


That promise eased her heart, and she gave a satisfied nod.



Just as she made to head out, she nearly collided with Austin, who was leaning casually in the doorway.


"Watch your step next time," he murmured,steadying her with one hand. His fingers brushed her arm-warm and soft.


"Alright, I know." Brinley pulled back immediately, a faint frown tugging at her lips. "Why are you here?Shouldn't you be resting?"


Austin gave a quiet, unhurried reply. "I was waiting for you." He eased into a smile, though his complexion remained pale. "The doctor said light walks will help me recover. How about joining me for a stroll in the garden?"


Seeing the exhaustion written across his face, Brinley couldn't bring herself to refuse.


They moved slowly along the garden path, shoulder to shoulder, while sunlight streamed through the branches above, scattering mottled shadows across the ground.


The air carried the freshness of grass and blooming  flowers, yet it was faintly tinged with the sterile scent of antiseptic that clung to Austin.


"Austin," Brinley murmured, nudging a loose pebble with her shoe. "Don't you think there are people waiting to exploit your sickness and cause trouble at Moore Group?"


The memory of him saying that more than half the Moore family wanted to see him collapse made her nerves tighten.


"Don't let it weigh on you," Austin answered evenly,his tone calm as stone. "Miguel will take care of it."


Brinley gave a small nod and let the matter drop.


She knew there was little she could do, so all she could offer was a quiet prayer for his swift recovery.


Several days later, on a warm afternoon, she sat in the living room, poring over a stack of real estate project files when Miguel appeared. His tone was formal as he reported, "Mr. Moore, Mrs. Moore,someone from the Moore family has arrived,inviting  you both to return to the Moore Estate for dinner."


Brinley lifted her gaze from the papers.


The Moore family had finally reached out.


Austin set aside the document in his hand and said evenly, "Tell them we will visit over the weekend."


"Understood." Miguel bowed slightly before leaving the room.



Once they were alone, Brinley turned toward Austin,concern edging her voice. "You're really planning to go back? But you're still recovering."


Austin's reply was calm, steady. "I'll be fine. It's time you met my father and the rest of the family."


Brinley hesitated, her brows knitting before she finally murmured, "Can I skip it?"


The thought of being paraded before the Moore family, their sharp gazes dissecting her every move,made her stomach tighten.


Austin's reply left no room for debate. "Absolutely  not. Being my wife ties you to the Moore family. Like it or not, we'll have to return. The sooner you adapt,the easier it'll be."


Though she recognized the truth in his words,resistance stilI tugged at her chest.


At last, she gave a reluctant nod and conceded,"Fine...I'll go."


Once the decision was made, she threw herself into preparations with quiet determination.


She had never set foot in the Moore household before and had no idea about their tastes or temperaments. Showing up empty-handed would be unthinkable.



Over the next few days, Brinley threw herself into her own little campaign.


She asked Miguel to discreetly collect information on each family member's preferences, then set out on a carefully planned shopping spree, determined to arrive at the Moore Estate with thoughtful gifts in hand.


On her first day out, Brinley headed straight to the city's most exclusive luxury mall. Knowing Austin's sister had a weakness for handbags, she carefully selected a limited-edition piece that wasn't easy to come by.


The following afternoon, she attended a high-profile auction. Since Austin's father was an avid art collector, she bid aggressively until she secured a notable oil painting by a celebrated master-an indulgence that cost her dearly.


On the third day, she wandered through a tucked-away antique shop, searching for something wvith history. Austin's eldest brother had a fondness for timepieces, so she chose a weathered but impeccably preserved pocket watch.


She didn't forget the others either, arranging thoughtful gifts for each member of the Moore family.


Every day, she set out early and returned long after  dusk, her body weary from the endless errands. The moment she stepped through the door, she collapsed onto the sofa, too tired to move another step.


Austin, watching her rush in and out in haste every day, grew increasingly puzzled about what she had been secretly planning.


He called Miguel with a laid-back ease. "Miguel,what's Brinley been up to lately?"


Miguel faltered for a moment before giving a candid reply. "She's been running all over-luxury malls,auctions, antique shops. From the looks of it, she's hunting for gifts for your family."


Austin blinked in surprise, not expecting her to go to such lengths. "She went by herself?"


"That's right," Miguel immediately confirmed."She wouldn't let me trail her. Said she wanted to choose everything personally."


Austin ended the call. A subtle, tender smile tugged  at his lips.


By evening, Brinley trudged home, worn out from the day.


The moment she stepped inside, she spotted Austin on the sofa. He held a document in hand, though his eyes weren't on the page-they were fixed on her,watching quietly as she walked in.


Austin rose to his feet and relieved her of the shopping bags. "You're home. Looks like you went a little overboard shopping."


"Pretty much," Brinley muttered with a weary nod.She kicked off her shoes, collapsed onto the sofa,and rubbed her sore legs. "I'm completely wiped out,"



The sight of her slumped shoulders tugged at him, a pang of guilt cutting through his chest.


Settling beside her, he lifted one of the gift boxes and flipped it open. "This one's for my dad,right?"


"Indeed." Her head slumped against the cushion. "Miguel mentioned he's into paintings, so l found one that might suit his taste. I can only hope he appreciates it."


"He'll love it," Austin said without hesitation, his tone warm."You handpicked it-he'd be a fool not to."
###Chapter 33 Visiting The Moores





Austin set down the gift box in his hand and glanced at Brinley. "You really don't need to go to so much trouble. It's fine if you don't prepare gifts for my family; they wouldn't mind."


"How can you say that?" Brinley immediately straightened her back, meeting his gaze with resolve."It's my first time visiting your family. I can't risk seeming impolite. What if they think I lack proper manners and that I'm not good enough for you?"


Her seriousness made a soft warmth rise in Austin's chest.



"That won't happen," he said calmly. "As long as I'm with you, no one will dare utter a word against you."


The conviction in his eyes melted the anxiety in Brinley's heart. Before their departure for the Moore Estate, Brinley twirled once in front of the full-length wardrobe mirror.


She was wearing just casual wear, but her natural beauty and elegance made it impossible for her to look plain.


"Mrs. Moore, all the gifts have been taken into the car," the butler announced at the doorway, a list of items in his hands. "Would you like to confirm them again?"


Brinley had already gone over the list more than five times.



She had spent days choosing every single gift.


"No need," she replied, taking the list from him. The anxiety left her palms cold.


She knew the presents were extravagant, perhaps even excessive, but she would not risk being belittled on her first visit, nor would she allow Austin to lose face because of her. Outside, Austin's car waited at the entrance of the villa.



He wore a charcoal grey suit patterned with subtle designs, which emphasized his tall frame.


When Brinley stepped out, Austin grinned with admiration. He held the door for her. "You look stunning."


Brinley blushed, feeling self-conscious, and she quickly slipped into thecar."Let's go."


As the vehicle rolled away from the villa, Brinley turned to glance at the van following behind, filled with the gifts she had carefully chosen one by one over the last several days.


She inhaled deeply, silently encouraging herself.


The Moore Estate lay in the eastern suburbs of Bleron, nestled halfway up a hill, surrounded by thick camphor trees.


From the car window, Brinley watched it draw closer,her fingertips curling slightly with unease. "Don't be afraid," Austin muttered beside her, taking her slightly cold hand in his. "I'm here."


Brinley turned her head toward him. Sunlight spilled through the window, tracing gentle shadows across his face.


She was grateful for his comfort, yet she couldn't help but feel anxious. The Moore family was vast and complicated; remembering names and faces alone would be a challenge, let alone dealing with the hidden rivalries and alliances beneath polite smiles.


The car pulled up, and the great iron gates swung open from within.


An elderly man, clearly the family's butler, stood at the front with a row of servants lined neatly behind him.


Leading them was Austin's eldest brother, Byron Moore, dressed in a dark blue suit.


"Austin, we've been waiting for you," Byron said warmly. He glanced between Austin and Brinley before gesturing toward her. "And this must be Brinley? Please, come inside."


Brinley followed Austin through the grand entrance.As they crossed the corridor, she noticed a handful of figures lurking behind the pillars, peeking at them curiously.


Among them stood a woman in a designer suit,whispering to a young man while stealing glances at Brinley.


Thanks to Miguel's notes, Brinley quickly identified her: Carolyn Moore, wife of Ryder Moore, Austin's second oldest brother. Standing beside her was her son,Corbett Moore.


The living room was already packed with people.


At the center, seated in the main seat, was an older man with silvering hair-Westley Moore, the patriarch.


To his side sat Austin's oldest sister, Briseis Moore,elegant in a refined dress. "Dad." Austin approached Westley, nodding slightly in greeting.


Brinley moved to follow with her own greeting, but before she could speak, Carolyn shrieked, "Oh? So this is Austin's new wife? She certainly looks young.But I heard she was married before."


After she spoke, the room seemed to freeze instantly.





Westley frowned but said nothing.


Brinley had stopped smiling, turning to respond to Carolyn. But Austin beat her to it.


"What do you mean by that, Carolyn?" His voice was menacing. He added firmly, "Brinley is my wedded wife."



Carolyn stiffened with embarrassment, forcing a smile. "Austin, I only meant it out of concern."


"There's no need for your concern," Austin replied,guiding Brinley to an empty seat. "We handle our own affairs." The room settled into an awkward silence.


Carolyn, feeling rebuked, pursed her lips and didn't dare push further. In her mind, she dismissed his defense as nothing more than pride.


Their marriage had been a family arrangemnent,after all; how much real affection could there be? Austin had always been aloof with women; how could he possibly care deeply for Brinley so soon?


The others remained quiet as well, each harboring their own thoughts.


Carolyn simmered with resentment.


It was Briseis who finally broke the tension."Come now, we're all family. That's enough. Brinley, since it's your first time here, try the coffee I just brewed."


Brinley lifted her cup politely. Being naturally discerning, she could already tell that this gathering would be a challenge to her.


After only a short round of pleasantries, she signaled for the servants to bring in the prepared gifts. Soon, over a dozen beautifully wrapped boxes were carried in and arranged neatly in the corner, ddrawing everyone's attention at once.
###Chapter 34 Why Would You Torch That Much Money
"Since it was my first time visiting all of you, l brought these gifts. I hope you all like them." Rising from her chair, Brinley signaled the servants to pass the gifts around. "For Westley, an oil painting. Briseis loves scarves-this one's this year's limited release.Byron and Ryder each get a set of..."


Carolyn shot up with a theatrical gasp, hands flying to her cheeks. "Oh my gosh, Brinley-you are really generous!"


With a mild turn of the head, Ryder sent her a measured look, his tone even yet pointed. "Since it's your first visit, Brinley, you've been very thoughtful to prepare these gifts.But..."


Dragging out the word, he let the silence settle before he continued, "These gifts cost a fortune,right? Austin may be running the company now and  hardly short on cash, but our family has always preached restraint. Your extravagance could draw unwanted criticism if people hear about it."


At once, Carolyn cut in, "Exactly, Brinley, you ought to be prudent with money. How could you be so careless? And isn't it Austin's money you're burning?"


From the couch, Brinley listened to their criticism of her, a cold smile ghosting at the corner of her mouth.


They saw her as an easy target, someone they could lash out at to make Austin look bad.


Resolved, Brinley lifted her handbag, slid out a stack of printed pages, and set them on the coffee table."Ryder, Carolyn, how about you take a look at these?"


Attention snapped to the neatly stacked papers,curiosity humming through the room.


In a crisp, steady tone, Brinley announced, "I chose every gift myself, and yes, they weren't cheap. I paid  for them with my own money-none of it came from Austin."



With a light tap of her fingertip, she indicated the documents. "Here are the itemized gift list, the matching receipts, and my bank statements. Go ahead and verify them."


Corbett reached for the list first. As his eyes skimmed the columns, his brows knitted tighter until he drew a sharp breath. "Hold on-this painting is the one from last month's auction?"


"Yes," Brinley replied with a small nod. "I'd heard Westley is into paintings, so l made sure to bid on that one."


A stunned edge roughened Corbett's voice. "We're talking thirty-two million for this painting!"


Most of them didn't truly grasp art, yet they felt the price tag humming off the painting.


Gasps cracked through the room.


Refusing to accept it, Carolyn snatched the itemized  list and the bank statements, running a finger down each line.



Rows of figures-some in the hundreds of thousands,others pushing into the millions-drove her to the final tally.


These gifts totaled forty-eight million seven hundred thousand!



Color drained from her face as the sheets slid from her grip and fluttered across the floor.


"No way," she snapped. "This was an arranged marriage-why would you torch that much money?"


"If you doubt me, feel free to look into it yourself."Brinley's voice stayed steady, yet it carried a steel edge of authority. "Back then I broke with my family,almost cutting ties completely, but I didn't sit around doing nothing. I've built up plenty over the years.Using my own savings to buy gifts for my husband's family-tell me, what's wrong with that?"


The living room went utterly still, the weight of her  words settling over them like a heavy veil.


Carolyn's lips parted as if to fire back, but nothing came out.



She had hoped to embarrass Brinley, but instead,she ended up embarrassing herself.


Westley's eyes lingered on Brinley, a flicker of intrigue glinting in his expression.


From his chair, Byron studied her calm face, his features giving nothing away.


With the receipts squared into a neat stack, Brinley let a courteous smile return. "I know you can afford anything you want, but these gifts are personally selected for each of you because you are Austin's family. I am standing on my own feet-with a career and savings. Austin didn't pay a dime for any of these gifts."


A beat ticked by as her gaze swept over Carolyn and Corbett, her tone turning cold. "Carolyn, since you feel the gifts are over the top, I'll come empty-  handed next time."


Carolyn found no retort; instead she cut a glare toward Corbett, pinning the mess on his loose talk.


Silence seeped back into the room. The Moores hadn't imagined the soft-spoken Brinley carried that kind of edge.


Wealth and confidence wove through those few lines,leaving Ryder and his family completely embarrassed by her retort.


His fingers stilled on the tabletop, Westley's gaze warming with quiet admiration as he stayed on the sidelines, watching rather than weighing in.


With a soft cough to cut the strain, Byron tried to smooth things over. "Brinley, thank you for your gift."


Across the room, Ryder and Carolyn looked stormy,their features set in dark, unyielding lines.


Ryder had tried to put Brinley on the spot to humiliate Austin, but his plan backfired spectacularly when he was outmaneuvered.  The quiet broke when Westley finally stepped in, his tone calm yet commanding. "That's enough, Ryder.Why are you being so harsh with Austin's wife?Careful-you might spook her."


Though his words carried the edge of a rebuke, they subtly offered Ryder and his family an escape, all while making his support for Brinley unmistakable.


Ryder dipped his head in a quick nod. "I shouldn't have said that." He turned to Brinley, voice easing."Don't take it to heart,Brinley."


Carolyn also stretched a smile so stiff it read as a grimace.


Without offering a word, Brinley gave a small nod,letting the air settle as though the earlier storm had already blown past.
###Chapter 35 His Dear Wife Hadn't Let Him Down





Austin sat quietly beside Brinley, not saying a word throughout.


When others had criticized her, he had subtly slid his chair closer and brushed his knee against hers,as though to wordlessly show his support.


Looking at her calm face, he now smiled.


His dear wife hadn't let him down.


Brinley, sensing his eyes on her, turned to glare at him.



He had clearly known that some of the Moores were set on giving her trouble, yet he hadn't given her the slightest warning. Obviously, he wanted to see how she handled it. How maddening!


But after thinking it over, she had to admit that  Austin's approach had its merits.


By holding back, he had given her the chance to stand strong in front of the Moore family and even win Westley's approval.


His tactics were ruthless indeed. No wonder his family wasn't close to him. Who could truly embrace someone so sharp and calculating?


Before long, the butler came in to announce that dinner was ready, and everyone moved to the table.


During the meal, the mood lightened a little, though a subtle awkwardness lingered in the air.


A few relatives began small talk with Brinley.


Carolyn also approached, taking Brinley's hand warmly as she asked about her skincare routine and hair salon, acting as though the harsh-tongued woman from earlier was someone else entirely.


Corbett, nudged firmly by his father, dragged himself over to share a drink with Brinley. He forced out a stiff smile, but his eyes still carried a defiant spark. Around the table, some people huddled in small groups, whispering while stealing glances at Brinley,their faces filled with curiosity, envy, and speculation.


Others acted as though she wasn't there, chatting amongst themselves, making it plain that they had no intention of being connected to her.


Brinley felt drained dealing with them. It was more exhausting than sitting through three back-to-back meetings.


At last, she understood why Austin preferred staying in his villa rather than coming back to the Moore Estate.



The very air in this house seemed to reek of scheming, and each conversation felt like a hidden trap.


When the gathering began to disperse, Briseis had a word with Brinley. She brought out the scarf that Brinley had gifted her and said with a smile, "You have great taste, Brinley. I've been searching everywhere for this one." "I'm glad you like it," Brinley answered with a polite smile.



"Don't take Carolyn's words to heart," Briseis added in a quieter voice. "She only cares about money."


Brinley gave a small nod without replying further. She wasn't sure whether Briseis was being sincere or simply testing her, but at least Briseis was friendly.


Still, Brinley felt suffocated by the entire gathering,as if caught in an invisible net.


The men retreated to the study to talk business,while the women lingered in the living room for idle chatter, their eyes frequently darting toward Brinley with thinly veiled judgment and calculation.


Holding her teacup, Brinley felt her fingers turn cold.


She was not used to this kind of setting. Every word she spoke felt like balancing on a blade, afraid that one misstep could turn her into a target and, by extension, bring trouble to Austin.


Since Austin had been called away by Westley to the study, Brinley was left alone and restless.


"I need to use the restroom," she said as she rose to her feet.



Instead of going to the restroom, Brinley turned back the way she had come and walked toward the back garden.


The afternoon sunlight streamed through the lush foliage, scattering dappled shadows along the stone pathway.


She deliberately avoided the servants, following a small pebble path until she reached a quiet corner screened by a rose-covered trellis.


There stood an old wooden swing, its paint faded but carefully kept clean.


Brinley sat on the swing and let it sway/, enjoying the moment of stillness.


Pulling out her phone, she opened her chat with Miguel and typed, "Send me the details of the Moore family ties; make it as detailed as possible." Miguel's reply came quickly. "Give me a moment.I'll put it together now."


A file soon landed in her inbox, spanning more than a dozen pages.


Brinley scrolled through the file, her frown growing heavier with every page she read.


The Moore family truly was a century-old dynasty branching out like a massive tree.


Westley and his late wife, Selene, had five sons and two daughters. Austin, the youngest, happened to be the same age as Ryder's son, Corbett.


The file also noted that Selene, already older when she bore Austin, had died giving birth to him.①


Because of this, Westley doted heavily on Austin,indulging his every wish.


But Austin's siblings treated him differently.


His eldest brother, Byron, was calm and even-tempered, always unreadable and giving away nothing of his true stance.


His second brother, Ryder, was openly ambitious,aimed to take over as family patriarch.


His third brother, Blaine Moore,had settled overseas,remaining neutral in the family disputes.


His fourth brother, Kendrick Moore, was a scholarly type, uninterested in power struggles and on good terms with Austin.


His eldest sister, Briseis, had married into another wealthy family. She was opportunistic and calculating,always weighing profit and advantage.


His second sister, Clarice Moore, was gentle and one of the few who showed Austin genuine affection,though her poor health kept her in a sanatorium much of the time.



"What a tangled web," Brinley muttered, rubbing her temples as a headache started to form.


She slipped her phone back into her pocket, shut her eyes tightly, and continued rocking gently on the swing. 
###Chapter 36 Staying The Night





The swing rocked lazily beneath the leafy shade of the garden, lulling Brinley into a deep, untroubled sleep.



Lost in her dreams, she was oblivious to the passage of time.



Inside the study, Austin sat stiffly, half-listening to his father's steady voice, though his gaze strayed again and again toward the window.


Brinley had vanished for nearly an hour now, and an unshakable tension coiled in his chest.



"What's on your mind?" Westley caught the flicker of distraction and lowered his teacup with a soft clink.



"It's nothing," Austin answered quickly, forcing his attention back. "I was just thinking about some company matters." Another thirty minutes crawled by, and still Brinley did not return.


Austin rose abruptly, unable to stay seated any longer. "Dad, I'm stepping out for a moment," he muttered,already striding toward the door.


Once outside the study, he questioned the servants scattered in the living room, but every one of them shook their heads-they hadn't seen Brinley.


Noticing his search, Carolyn let out a cutting laugh."Maybe she couldn't handle our family's atmosphere and slipped off."



Ryder added with a hint of reproach, "It's her first time here. You should have kept her company,Austin. What if she's already lost?"


Austin's jaw tightened, his eyes darkening with unspoken worry.


The sprawling Moore Estate stretched far and wide.Its gardens were divided into sections to the east,west, and south, with winding paths and several deserted rock gardens where one could easily vanish.



Austin pulled out his phone, his tone sharp and unyielding as he issued the order. "Miguel, pull up the surveillance-I want Brinley located now."


Miguel flinched at the command and hurried to call the Moore Estate's security room without a word.


Within moments, the estate stirred to life-servants rushing down corridors, bodyguards scattering through the courtyards and gardens, every corner of the property combed with urgency.


Westley's brows knit together as he ordered Caiden,the butler, to help with the search.


At the threshold of the main building, Austin stood rigid, his eyes sweeping the endless stretch of gardens. Each passing second made his chest tighten, a relentless knot winding tighter, suffocating him.


brought Brinley here at all?


At last, a bodyguard sprinted across the lawn,breathless and wide-eyed. "Sir, we found your wife-she's... she's asleep behind the rose trellis in the west garden."


The crushing weight in Austin's chest finally loosened. Without hesitation, he strode swiftly toward the west garden, every step fueled by raw relief.



From across the garden, he spotted Brinley curled up on the swing, her head tipped against the thick rope,lips parted slightly in a drowsy sigh, lost in peaceful sleep.


He stepped closer, his movements soundless, then crouched beside her.



Her lashes fanned across her cheeks, throwing feathery shadows, and the faint blush on her nose made her look like a small, contented kitten soaking in the warmth of a dream.
A pang of regret stabbed through him-why had he  The restlessness that had been gnawing at Austin melted, replaced by a swell of quiet tenderness.


"Brinley," he murmured, stretching out his hand.


His fingertips brushed her cheek, coaxing her awake.She shifted against the swing, lids fluttering before she blinked at him through the haze of sleep.


"Austin?" Her voice was low and husky, roughened by slumber, her unfocused eyes trying to catch hold of him. "Why... why are you here?"


"If I hadn't shown up, you'd probably have slept until morning," Austin said, his voice laced with weary amusement and a touch of fondness.



Brinley jolted fully awake, blinking in confusion before realizing she was the center of attention.


A ring of bodyguards and servants surrounded her,and Byron stood nearby with several Moores who had all rushed over at the commotion.


Every one of them stared at Brinley as if she were some rare curiosity on display. Not far off, Caiden's expression twisted with poorly suppressed laughter, the corners of his mouth twitching despite his effort to stay composed.


Heat flared in Brinley's face until her cheeks burned crimson, and she longed for the ground to simply swallow her whole.



Only then did it strike her: on her very first visit to her husband's family estate, she had dozed off on the garden swing and sunk into a deep, unguarded sleep.


"I..." Brinley parted her lips, searching for an explanation, but every word she tried to form felt clumsy on her tongue.


"Come on." Austin rose smoothly, offering his hand with quiet certainty, "We should head back."


Brinley wavered for a breath, then slipped her hand into his.



His grasp was broad and steady, carrying a faint,cooling warmth that eased the tension knotting in her chest.


As he guided her toward the path, she became achingly aware of the eyes trailing after them,heat crawling up her neck until her cheeks burned.


What a spectacle she had made on her very first appearance at the Moore Estate. She could already imagine the laughter whispered behind fans and wineglasses, her nap becoming tomorrow's favored joke.



When they returned to the main building, Westley studied them briefly but chose not to mention Brinley having dozed off in the garden. Instead, he said in his steady voice, "It's late, Austin. Don't drive back tonight-stay here and head out tomorrow."


Caiden quickly added with a grin, "Exactly. You don't come home often. Stay, and I'll have your room on the third floor made up."


Ryder and Carolyn echoed the suggestion, their cheerful tones carrying a hint of  Brinley suspected they were eager to see if she and Austin would share a room; if they didn't, Ryder and Carolyn would use it as a weapon to target them.


Austin's eyes drifted to Brinley, his expression gentle yet full of respect. "What do you think-should we stay?"


The stiffness in Brinley's chest loosened under his considerate gaze.


She dipped her head slightly and murmured,"Whatever you decide."


Austin's mouth curved intoa small, approving smile before he turned to Westley. "Then we'll stay the night."


Caiden's face lit up as he declared, "Excellent! I'll make the arrangements at once!"


The Moore famnily's grand residence stretched across four floors, each space meticulously designed to reflect their wwealth and heritage.


On the ground level were the living room, dining hall,forced politeness. and a series of leisure rooms meant for hosting guests.


The second and third floors housed Westley along with the rest of the family.


The fourth floor was entirely reserved for Austin.


When Caiden escorted them up the sweeping staircase to the third floor, Brinley found herself pausing, struck by the realization.


The entire floor stretched into more than a dozen suites,each lavishly furnished.


From every window, a sweeping view of the Moore Estate's garden unfolded-endless manicured lawns and winding stone paths in perfect symmetry.


"You'll be staying in the master bedroom.Everything has already been arranged," Caiden said with quiet deference.


Brinley's pulse stumbled when her eyes landed on the master bedroom-only one enormous bed dominated the space.
 ###Chapter 37 Sharing A Bed

"Um..." Brinley gave Austin's sleeve a timid tug, her words soft as a breath. "I'll sleep in the guest room instead."
There were more than enough empty rooms on the floor-no reason for them to share.
Austin's gaze shifted toward her, a faint crease forming between his brows. "Why would you do that?"
Her lashes fluttered as she glanced away, heat creeping into her cheeks. "It just feels...inappropriate. With so many other rooms, it makes sense."
A quiet weight settled into his voice, calm but unyielding. "What's so inappropriate about it? You're my wife."
Brinley faltered, her lips parting with hesitation. "But..."



Austin leaned closer, his tone dropping low, leaving no room for retreat. "No buts. My family wants us to stay because they're curious," he said evenly, his gaze steady on her. "If we end up in separate rooms,they'll whisper that our marriage is falling apart.Once that rumor takes root, they'll only use it against you."



Brinley sighed, the realization hitting her like a splash of cold water.


The Moores had eyes everywhere, and the smallest crack would be pried wide open.


"But..." she murmured, biting her lip, the thought of sharing a room with him still making her chest tighten.


"Relax." Austin lowered his voice, his expression softening. "I'm not going to cross any lines with you."His gaze drifted to her flushed earlobes, his voice laced with quiet amusement. "Or are you worried I might be harboring improper thoughts about you?"
"L..."Brinley faltered, words catching in her throat.


The truth was, she had entertained the idea.


A man like him-handsome, powerful, and never lacking admirers-somehow treatedI her differently.Who would believe he wanted nothing from her?


The thought unsettled Brinley, making her avert her gaze.


"Fine then, we won't split rooms," she murmured at last, mindful of the tangled undercurrents within the Moore family.


Austin studied her, the curve of his smile deepening,warmth flickering in his eyes.


The door clicked shut, and an uneasy stillness settled over the room.



Brinley drifted toward the window, feigning interest in the nightscape beyond, though her chest thudded with frantic rhythm.


From the corner of her eye, she caught Austin at the desk, casually thumbing through papers. His side profile-clean lines, refined features-was almost sculptural, radiating a quiet dominance that made it hard to breathe,much less look away.
"I... I think I'll take a shower," she declared, her voice breaking the silence as she snatched up the neatly folded pajamas Caiden had set out. With hurried steps, she all but escaped into the bathroom.
The space inside was lavish, a blend of polished stone and gleaming fixtures, with a glass-walled shower beside a vast soaking bathtub.
She twisted the handle, and warm water streamed over her skin, but the comfort did nothing to still the restless pounding in her chest.
The thought nagged at her, insistent and unnerving-tonight, she was truly sharing a room with Austin.
Though she grasped his reasoning-separate rooms would only stoke gossip-an unsettled feeling still lingered in her chest. Her earlier suspicions replayed in her mind, sending an embarrassed heat crawling up her cheeks.
Fresh from her shower, Brinley stepped out dressed in modest cotton pajamas, damp strands of hair spilling over her shoulders.
Austin had already changed into a dark gray set of loungewear. He sat comfortably on the sofa, a stack of documents in hand. His eyes lifted the moment he heard her footsteps.
"Make sure you dry your hair before bed, or you'll end up with a headache," he remarked, nodding toward the hairdryer resting on the nightstand.
"Alright." She nodded, taking it up quickly before turning her back to him.
Warm air fluttered through her hair, but what unsettled her more was the sensation of his gaze lingering behind her-light as a brush of feathers,oddly soothing, yet stirring something restless within her. Her hair finally dry, she lingered by the bed,torn between standing and sitting, before lowering herself gingerly onto the edge of the bed.


Austin set aside the stack of documents on his desk and strolled into the bathroom, the sound of running water soon filling the quiet room.


Brinley's pulse quickened all over again as she sat stiffly, her ears tuned to every splash behind the door.



Her gaze drifted to the enormous bed, and she toyed with the idea of markinga line straight down the middle.


When Austin returned, steam still clung to him,beads of water trickling through his dark hair and sliding along the sharp angle of his jaw before vanishing into the collar of his soft loungewear. The sight carried a subtle, dangerous charm.


Brinley's eyes flicked over him before she could stop herself, her face heating instantly. She snapped her gaze upward, feigning fascination with the ceiling. Austin caught the tension in her stiff shoulders and let out a low chuckle. "Time to turn in," he said lightly.


He slid under the quilt and stretched out on the far edge, making a point to leave her plenty of space.The boundary was unmistakable.


Brinley exhaled a shaky breath of relief and lowered herself onto the bed, careful to turn away from him.Her posture remained taut, her shoulders locked as if she were lying on a bed of thorns rather than linen.


Austin reached over and switched off the lamp,plunging the room into a hush lit only by pale moonlight spilling across the floor.


The quiet magnified every sound-the rustle of fabric, the faint rhythm of their breathing-until it seemed almost deafening.


Brinley's pulse drummed wildly, refusing to settle no matter how tightly she willed it.

 
She could sense the steady heat radiating from Austin's body, the kind of warmth that seemed to slip through the cool night air and brush against her skin.


"Still awake?" His low, husky voice cut through the darkness.


"Yes," she whispered, barely above a breath.


"Having trouble getting used to this?" he inquired softly.


"Yeah."


After a beat of quiet, Austin tilted his head and asked, his tone casual but probing, "Did you enjoy your little nap in the garden today?"


Brinley groaned under her breath, her cheeks warming. "Don't bring that up."


"I wasn't teasing," he replied with a soft chuckle."It just looked like you were fond of that swing."


Brinley ducked her gaze, muttering, "Honestly, it felt a lot cozier than sitting stiffly in the living room."


"Think of this as your home too, and drop in whenever you want."


Brinley froze at his words.


Home? She had never once imagined the grand Moore Estate could ever become her home.


Yet the tension that had been coiled tight inside her eased, her chest loosening as if a weight had lifted.


She shifted toward him, his silhouette softened by the silver wash of moonlight.
###Chapter 38 A Sleepless Night





Brinley's lips parted as if she might swallow the words back, but she forced them out.


"Austin." Her voice trembled, then steadied. "Do you...do this often?"


He tilted his head, his gaze fixed on her in the dim light."Do what?"


"Manipulate people." The hesitation faded,replaced with quiet insistence. "Even me."


Austin didn't answer right away. A long silence stretched between them, heavy with things unspoken. At last, he said evenly, "In the Moore family, if I don't stay three steps ahead, I'Il end up falling into someone else's trap. I won't let that happen. And I won't let you get hurt either."


There was no mockery in his tone, no shield of arrogance-o nly a raw honesty that caught her off guard.
Though shadows hid the details of his face, Brinley could still catch the honesty shining through his words.
"I see," she murmured, her voice barely audible.
Curling onto her side with her back to Austin,she tried to still her racing thoughts. Onlya few minutes passed before the steady rhythm of his breathing filled the quiet room.
Unable to resist, she shifted just enough to steal a glance at him. A thin blade of moonlight slipping through the curtains sketched his face in sharp relief,highlighting the strong cut of his profile.
He looked as though sleep had already claimed him.
Her taut nerves loosened, yet rest still wouldn't come.
The dip in the mattress reminded her that he was there. 
His scent drifted across the narrow space-crisp cedar-not heavy, but insidious, curling around her senses like smoke. The more she breathed it in, the wider awake she became.


A low murmur drifted from behind her. "Still awake?"The words carried an easy tone, but a quiet thread of curiosity wound through them.


Brinley's pulse faltered, and she instinctively stilled,her breath shallow. Her lashes fluttered despite her effort to remain composed.


She forced her chest to rise and fall in an even rhythm, fingers curling tightly into the sheet beneath her.



Austin didn't speak again, leaving the room to its hush.


Still, she couldn't shake the heat of his unseen gaze pressing against her back-steady, inquisitive,almost burning-raising goosebumps along her nape.


She dared not roll over, eyes clamped shut as if sleep had already claimed her, though her thougts wandered restlessly in the dark.


The clock on the nightstand marked each dragging second until its hands pointed to one in the morning.


Brinley's eyelids drooped heavier by the second, and just as she began sinking into real sleep, the mattress shifted under a subtle weight.


Her breath caught, every musce strung tight as she sensed his presence leaning closer, the warmth of his gaze pressing down over her like a shadow.


For one dizzying heartbeat, she thought his fingers would graze her hair-but the touch never came, the moment suspended in a fragile hesitation.


"Brinley." Austin's voice borushed against her ear,hushed and fleeting, like a sigh swallowed by the dark.


Her lashes trembled, a strange sensation unfurling in her chest.


She burrowed deeper into the mattress, giving a soft, <###Chapter 38 A Sleepless Night               +120 Points at most sleepy murmur as though his voice had pulled her from her dreams.
Austin let out a low chuckle, the sound carrying both resignation and a quiet fondness.
Afterward, the room slipped into heavy silence,without the faintest rustle.
Brinley,though,remained wide awake.
She sensed he hadn't stretched out beside her again, as if he were still seated nearby, his eyes lingering on her.
Not wanting him to know she was still awake, she held her rigid posture, her thoughts spinning aimlessly into the night.
Why was he watching her so intently? Could it truly be that Austin harbored a weakness for her?
Brinley pictured Austin dusted in flour as he stubbornly tried to master cooking, the steady calm in his face while he swallowed down her disastrous attempts at a meal, and the ghostly pallor when he endured the pain of gastrointestinal bleeding.


Those snapshots flickered through her mind like a reel of film, and her pulse stumbled, racing faster.

To everyone else, Austin was decisive, relentless, a man carved from steel-yet before her, he revealed a tenderness that seemed to exist nowhere else.


The thought stirred unease. Maybe she was reading too much into it.


Perhaps it wasn't affection at all, but simply that Austin had never been close to a woman before.Suddenly bound by marriage, he might only be treating her kindly out of obligation.


Their union had cemented the two families together,and she reasoned that so long as he posed no real danger to her, she was content to continue the marriage.


As for what lay ahead-they would just take things step by cautious step.

  
Brinley's thoughts meandered until the faint glow of dawn finally softened her mind into a shallow sleep.


When she stirred again, the space beside her was already vacant.


Sunlight poured in through the tall windows, spilling golden streaks across the polished floor.


Out on the balcony, Austin stood with a phone pressed to his ear, his lean, imposing frame outlined by the light. The dark gray pajamas he wore only sharpened his aura of quiet authority.


As she watched his back, Westley's words from the night before echoed in her memory.


"Brinley, you may not know this, but Austin's mother left the very day after he was born. He never experienced a mother's love. That's why he seems cold and distant. But he's soft on the inside; he just doesn't know how to connect with people. You're his wife, so try to endure. If he ever mistreats you, tell me-I'll make sure he's taught a lesson."


Back then, she had acknowledged with a smile, though something complicated twisted inside her chest.



Learning Austin had grown up in such a cold, barren household suddenly explained why he buried his emotions so deeply.


Yet Brinley couldn't help but question-was the Austin she knew truly as detached as Westley described?


This was the same man who had fumbled his way through cooking just to please her, eaten every poorly prepared dish she put on the table without a word of complaint, and stood quietly at her side when his family made things difficult for her.


He seemed nothing like the person that Westley had described.


"You are awake." Austin ended the call and turned with a faint curve to his lips. "Go freshen up.Breakfast's ready."


Brinley gave a small nod, slipped out of bed, and hurried toward the bathroom. In the mirror, she caught sight of the faint shadows beneath her eyes-evidence of the sleepless night she had endured.
###Chapter 39 Do | Come Across As Frightening
The mood at breakfast felt far lighter than the tense silence of the day before.
Brinley's stunt of sleeping in the garden had caught everyone off guard. Those who had planned to give her trouble now watched her with a mix of curiosity and speculation, their open hostility softening.
Westley, clearly in a good mood, kept piling food onto Brinley's plate while recounting one embarrassing childhood tale after another about Austin.
Brinley burst into laughter, sneaking a glance at Austin, whosat composedly with his milk, sipping as if the stories had nothing to do with him.
Once the meal ended, Miguel hurried in and bent close to whisper something into Austin's ear.  Word had spread to Austin's siblings-news that he'd brought his bride home had sent them all clamoring to return and meet her.
A faint crease formed between Austin's brows before he turned to Westley. "Dad, something came up at the company. I'll leave with Brinley now."
He understood exactly what his siblings were after:not a warm welcome, but a chance to test Brinley.And he had no intention of letting her face another round of scrutiny.
Westley nodded with a knowing smile. "Go on, just promise me you'll remember to eat on time, even if work piles up."
Turning to Brinley, he added warmly, "Make sure you visit often whenever you can."
"Of course," Brinley answered with an easy smile.
On the verge of leaving, Austin paused to give Caiden a few instructions, while Brinley lingered by the doorway. Austin returned quickly, his movements sure as he slipped his hand naturally into hers. "What's on your mind?"
"Nothing important." She shook her head and followed him out of the estate. "Are we heading back to Hillcrest Villa now?"
"That's right. I'll take you back first." With practiced ease, Austin opened the passenger door.
Sliding into the seat, Brinley hesitated before speaking. "Could you stop at the intersection ahead?I'd like to swing by the company first."
Her small firm was tucked inside an office building in the heart of downtown.
Since the project had ground to a halt, most of the staff were on extended leave, leaving only a skeleton crew still working.
She decided to stop by with food as a small gesture of thanks.
"I'll go with you," Austin said without hesitation. Brinley immediately waved him off. "No, really, I can handle it. Don't you have work piling up? Go take care of that-I'll be fine on my own."
The thought of having him shadowing her at her own office made her squirm.
Austin's brows drew together as he studied her. "Do l come across as frightening?"
She shook her head quickly. "No, that's not it.."
"Then why keep dodging me?" His tone carried an edge of irritation, each word deliberate. "I'll have the driver take you. And I'll just wait in the car."
Brinley faltered, tongue-tied beneath the weight of his gaze.
Only then did it strike her that she might, in truth, be pulling away from him on purpose.
Was it unease? Or something deeper she didn't dare name?
At last she exhaled and gave a small nod. "Fine. Thank you for giving me a ride."
Relief softened his expression. He pulled out his laptop, his focus shifting to the screen as his long fingers danced across the keys.
The car soon settled into silence, broken only by the steady rhythm of his typing that filled the quiet space between them.
Seated at his side, Brinley found herself sneaking sideways glances she couldn't quite resist.
Sunlight spilled through the window, painting his profile in warm gold and sharpening the edges of his already striking features.
She couldn't deny it-Austin looked exactly like the kind of man she'd always found herself drawn to,every detail checking the boxes of her secret preferences.
As Brinley's thoughts drifted, Austin turned his head abruptly, catching her with a direct, steady gaze.
"Enjoying the view?" he asked, a faintly teasing smile curving his lips.
Flustered, she snapped her head toward the window.Her voice came out awkward and defensive. "What? I wasn't... I was just admiring the scenery. The view on your side happens to be better."
Beyond the glass, only a blur of busy streets stretched out-nothing remotely scenic.
Austin's low chuckle slipped out, but he didn't press her lie. He returned his attention to the laptop resting on his knees.
Leaning against the cool windowpane, Brinley felt warmth creeping up her cheeks.
When she dared another sidelong glance, Austin was still immersed in his screen, not sparing her a look.She exhaled quietly in relief.
The car rolled steadily toward the city center, tires humming against the asphalt.
After she scrolled aimlessly on her phone, boredom set in, and her gaze drifted back to Austin without her realizing it.
With a small pause, she slipped her phone into silent mode, hesitated, then discreetly angled it to capture his sharp profile in secret.
The sunlight caught his brow just right in the photo,sharpening his focus and making him impossible to ignore.
Brinley lingered on the image, a subtle smile tugging at her lips.
Even a few stolen glances at his face were enough to brighten her mood.
As if sensing her, Austin turned, his gaze locking with hers.
Flustered, she ducked her head and pretended to scroll through her phone. "Huh? What is it?"
He studied her nervous act, amusement sparking in his eyes, but chose silence, returning to his papers with a slight curve to his mouth.
The moment her shoulders loosened in relief, the car lurched violently to the side. The driver must have swerved hard to avoid something, and her phone slipped from her hands with a sharp thud as her body pitched forward.
Instead of striking the seat in front of her, she crashed against the solid warmth of a broad chest.
"Ouch..." Her nose smacked into Austin's shoulder,the sting so sharp it sent tears pricking at her eyes.
Austin reacted instantly, his arms circling her in a firm catch before she could tumble further.
"You hurt?" His deep voice carried a note of alarm above her head.
Blinking back the sting, Brinley/ realized she was sprawled across his lap, her fingers clenching the fabric of his shirt as if holding on for balance.
###Chapter 40 Was He Being Thoughtful On Purpose
Brinley quickly pushed against Austin's knees, trying to stand, but in her haste, her elbow ended up poking him in the stomach.
"Sorry," she muttered, withdrawing her clumsy movements. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and sat back down, attempting to mask her awkwardness as she reached forher phone.
But when the screen lit up, the photo she had secretly taken earlier was clearly displayed.
Her mind went blank. She hurriedly brushed her fingertip across the power button, shutting the screen off. Still, when she lifted her eyes, she found Austin watching her with a faint, knowing smile.
Brinley was completely lost for words. The embarrassment was unbearable. At the front, the driver, pale with fright, stole a glance in the rearview mirror and stammered, "Mr. Moore,I'm so sorry... A cat suddenly ran into the road..."
Usually, if something had jolted Austin's ride like this,the driver would have been dismissed on the spot.
Yet today, Austin only responded calmly, "I see."Then he fell silent.
An uneasy silence filled the car.
Brinley leaned against the window, straining her ears to catch any sound from Austin.
From the corner of her eye, she saw him resting with his head tilted back, eyes closed, and his sharp face softened. There was no trace of irritation on his face.That was the strangest part.
This man usually lost his temper over coffee served a degree too hot or too cold, but today, after she had knocked into him, he hadn't shown the slightest anger.
Was he plotting something bigger? Before she could make sense of it, Austin spoke up."Pull over up ahead."


The driver obeyed immediately, stopping in front of a dessert shop.


"You stay here. I'll buy something," Austin said as he pushed open the car door.

"T'll come too," Brinley replied at once, quickly following him.


The last thing she wanted was to give him time to think about how to punish her.


The moment they stepped inside the dessert shop,the sweet scent of cream and chocolate hit them.


Austin went straight to the counter and recited an order; every dessert he named happened to be among Brinley's favorites.


Turning toward her, he asked, "Anything else you'd like?"


"No, that's enough," Brinley replied, shaking her head, only becoming more puzzled. Was he being thoughtful on purpose? But why?
After leaving with the desserts, Austin directed the driver to a nearby fruit shop with glowing reviews.
"Your staff will probably enjoy these," he explained as he carefully picked out fresh fruits.
Brinley's guard began to drop as she watched him pick the fruits.
Whatever game he was playing, the mood between them wasn't so tense anymore.
Once they were back in the car, the atmosphere felt noticeably lighter.
Brinley picked up a strawberry and bit into it. The sweet juice burst across her tongue, instantly lifting her spirits.
"Taste good?" Austin asked, his eyes on her, a smile tugging at his lips.
"Mm, very sweet," she replied. Almost without  thinking, she picked up another strawberry and held it near his mouth. "Want one?"


Austin seemed momentarily surprised, but then leaned forward and took a bite.


His lips brushed lightly against her fingertips,whether deliberately or not.


Brinley's fingers twitched, but her face remained calm. She drew her hand back casually and went on eating strawberries as if nothing had happened.


Chewing slowly, Austin stared at her profile, the smile in his eyes growing deeper.


Soon, the car pulled up outside the office complex in which Brinley's was located.


Just as the driver was about to turn into their reserved parking spot, a bright red Ferrari shot out from the side.



Its engine roared loudly as it swerved and forcefully claimed the space. "What in the world?" Brinley exclaimed, scowling.
That spot was part of the company's lease, and there was a guard station at the entrance; random cars were not allowed to park there.
Austin's face darkened instantly, but before he could act,Brinley touched his arm. "Let me handle this."
She stepped out of the car, already running through her options.
Austin didn't stop her. He only leaned back,observing the flashy Ferrari.
"Sir, this parking space is reserved for our company.Would you mind moving?" Brinley spoke calmly,standing beside the sports car with a polite smile.
The Ferrari's window slid down slowly, revealing a young man with grey-streaked hair. He gave her a sweeping glance and answered with a mocking grin,"With a pretty lady asking, I'd like to say yes. But moving this beast is such a hassle. How about you grab coffee with me, and I'll think about it?" Brinley's smile vanished, but she replied calmly,"Please mind your manners.Security will be here any minute. If they get involved, it'll only end awkwardly for you."
The man blinked, clearly not expecting firmness from someone with such a gentle face. He huffed and said stubbornly, "I'm not moving. What can you do about it?"
Pulling out her phone, Brinley answered lightly, "l've heard they're cracking down on illegal parking lately,especially in reserved corporate spaces. At best,your car gets towed. At worst... it could stay on your driving record."
Her words hit home.
The man's face tightened, and after muttering a curse, he started the engine and sped away.
Brinley watched the sports car vanish into traffic,then returned to the car carrying the bags of fruit and desserts for her employees.
###Chapter 41 You're A Complete Tyrant

Austin's gaze hardened, his voice edged with frustration."You were grinning far too sweetly at a man who's nothing but a scoundrel."
Brinley finally caught on to what stoked his fury. She lifted her chin, her tone calm but earnest. "That was nothing more than courtesy. Picking a fight in public would have only made things worse."
His brow arched, and the air between them seemed to tighten as he answered, clipped and commanding,"Men like him aren't worth your breath. He should be driven out of Bleron altogether."
The cold authority in his profile sent a shiver skating down her spine.
This was the true Austin-the man who could decide a person's fate with a single sentence.
Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she replied, <###Chapter 41 You're A Complete Tyrant        *120 Points at most "You're a complete tyrant. What you decree becomes law."
Austin almost looked entertained at being called a "tyrant," the corner of his mouth softening even as his gaze stayed firm. "Next time you run into someone like that, don't waste time on courtesy."
"Sure," Brinley answered lightly, masking the weight of her thoughts. She knew better than to believe it was that simple.
He had the luxury of sitting high above the fray,untouchable no matter who he offended.
Yet, she was unlike him, unafraid to be challenged.
With a single careless move, she could be the one paying the price.
While she wrestled with that reality, Austin had already turned away, his fingers moving with quick precision across his phone screen, placing a call without hesitation.
"It'sme, Austin," he said, his tone snapping back to its familiar chill. "The parking lot beneath my wife's office needs to be secured. Mark off a section and assign two dependable men to watch it. No one else is allowed near." Whatever answer came through the line, Austin cut it short wvith a curt "Okay" before ending the call.
Brinley studied him, a trace of weary disbelief flickering in her eyes. "Do you honestly have to make such a big deal over one parking space?"
"I do," Austin replied, his stare blazing with such heat it nearly burned. "I would not let anyone upset my wife."
His words carried a sharp edge, and the intensity in his eyes made Brinley's chest tighten.
"I'd better head up now," she whispered.
As she reached for the car door, her fingers grazed the stack of documents on Austin's lap, sending several pages sliding to the floor.
She bent down in a fluster to retrieve them, only to feel his hand press gently over hers, heat seeping through his touch.
"Careful now," he murmured, his deep, magnetic voice brushing against her ear like velvet.
Brinley instinctively withdrew her hand, hastily gathering the stack of papers before pressing them into his arms. "I'm heading in now."
A grin tugged at Austin's lips as he watched her head into the office building.
From the back seat, Austin lounged against the leather seat, eyes never leaving the slow spin of the revolving door.
But the instant Brinley's silhouette faded inside, the warmth in his expression drained, leaving behind a sharp,frigid stare.
He noticed a man in a tailored gray suit following her in with purposeful steps.

It was Colin. The way he moved-composed and clearly expectant -made it obvious he had been lingering there,waiting for her arrival.
Austin arched a brow, disdain flickering in his eyes.Colin had the audacity to pester her again!
Inside the office, the air was light with chatter and the sweet scent of strawberry cake. A crowd of employees clustered around the long conference table, laughing as they savored generous slices.
"Brinley, this cake you picked out is incredible!"Corbin Burke, the eager intern, spoke around a mouthful, his cheeks puffed like a chipmunk.
Brinley chuckled softly, passing him a napkin with a gentle shake of her head. "Slow down-there's more than enough to go around."
No sooner had the words left her lips than movement beyond the glass door caught her eye.
Colin stood there in a perfectly pressed gray suit, a paper bag dangling from his hand. His tall frame filled the doorway, but the stiffness in his posture betrayed a rare trace of unease.


He stayed outside, staring at her through the glass,his expression tangled with emotions she couldn't quite name.


For the briefest heartbeat, she almost saw the Colin who had once spoiled her without restraint.


The illusion vanished as quickly as it came.


Brinley understood better than anyone. He had squandered her love, and now that they had broken up,he regretted it.


Maybe there lingered a trace of affection,but more than that, he simply couldn't accept the fact that she was walking away from his life.


Her faint smile slipped. With a quiet word to her employees, Brinley pivoted toward the door.


She pushed open the glass door, her expression unreadable. "Mr. Palmer, do you need something from me?" she asked, her tone measured but edged with distance.



Colin blinked as if shaken from a daze. He hurriedly held out a paper bag, his voice carrying a hint of nervous hope. "I happened to be nearby and saw this bakery. You used to love their pastries, so I thought I'd bring some for you."



The logo on the bag belonged to the shop she had once praised endlessly, saying their pastries were flaky, buttery, and just the right kind of sweet.


She didn't reach for it. With a cold shake of her head,she replied, "Thank you, but I don't eat those anymore."


Colin's hand stalled mid-air, the bag crinkling slightly in his grip. Disappointment clouded his eyes for a fleeting second before he forced a polite smile. "I see."



He let his gaze wander across the open office space,and genuine surprise softened his features. "I didn't realize your company had grown so much. I thought you were still managing a small studio..." "The place started as nothing more than a cramped little studio," Brinley said, leaning against the doorframe with her arms loosely folded, her stance carrying a quiet distance. "But little by little, it expanded."
"That's impressive," Colin replied, genuine admiration coloring his tone. "I didn't realize you were so skilledin business," he added, his gaze steady."Balancing work while running the company.You've put in a lot of effort."
A faint sting tugged at Brinley's heart, a dull ache rising like an old bruise.
Of course, he had no clue. Back then, she had spent her days at the company and her nights locked away in the study, porig over plans and research until the first pale light of dawn crept across her desk.
###Chapter 42 What Do | Mean To You

After cutting ties with the Shaw family, Brinley threw herself into building a life without leaning on anyone else. She was determined to make money through her own hard work and build a good life with Colin.
Secretly, she even set money aside, planning to surprise him later by offering to invest in the Palmer Group once things at the company had settled.
But before long, she discovered his involvement with Milly.
All those sleepless nights, all her hopes for the future, had been reduced to nothing in an instant,like a cruel joke.
Lowering her eyes, Brinley quickly hid the flicker of pain. When she looked up again, her face was calm and expressionless. "I assume you didn't come here just to compliment me, Mr. Palmer. Is there something else on your mind?"
"Yes," Colin replied, nodding his head as he pulled a document from his briefcase. "There's a real estate project. If we work together, we could maximize the returns..."



"We cannot collaborate," Brinley said coldly without even looking up, cutting Colin off completely. His hand, still holding the file, froze in mid-air.


"Brinley..." Colin looked at her stiff professionalism and forced a strained smile. "The cherries in Crystal Lake Park are in bloom. You mentioned wanting to go there.I never made the time before, but now..."


"No need." Brinley's eyes were sharp and cold as she interrupted him again. "The past means nothing to me now."


Just after she spoke, the faint sound of movement could be heard from the office entrance.



Brinley turned her head and saw Austin standing there, tall and composed, staring deeply at her.


What was he doing here? His eyes swept over the others in the room, landing directly on her. With a faint smile tugging at his lips,he said, "It's lunchtime. Let me take you out to eat."


At his words, Brinley's eyes lit with a trace of happiness. She immediately turned to Colin. "Mr.Palmer, you're not welcome here. Don't bother coming again."


Without waiting for his response, she strode toward Austin and joined him at the doorway.


Colin could only watch as she walked away, side by side with Austin, their steps perfectly in sync. The paper bag in his hand crumpled under the pressure of his clenched fist.



Only Brinley and Austin rode in the elevator.


The mirrored walls reflected their figures standing close together, an awkward, charged silence falling between them.


Brinley glanced at Austin. His brows were furrowed,his expression frosty. He was clearly in a bad mood. "What's the matter?" she asked before she could stop herself.
"Nothing," Austin answered blandly.
"Obviously, something's wrong." She raised her brows, cutting straight to the point. "You saw Colin,and it bothered you, didn't it?"
Austin pursed his lips. He didn't admit it, but his voice carried jealousy as he said, "It looks like Colin is very taken with you."
"He came to discuss business," she replied.
"Business? Does business require bringing pastries?"Austin scoffed, his tone even colder. "And that look on his face, as if he were playing out a tragic love story for everyone to see."
Brinley couldn't help laughing softly. "Wow, your jealousy is really something."
"Jealous? Me?" Austin was taken aback by her remark. He scowled and let out a short, dismissive snort."I am not." Brinley looked at himn, amused by the contradiction between his words and actions, just about to tease him further when the elevator suddenly dinged to a stop.
The doors opened slowly, revealing an empty hallway.

It was obvious someone had pressed the button and left before it arrived.

Austin squinted, and in the next moment, he stepped forward, pinning Brinley lightly against the elevator wall.

His hand braced against the wall by her ear, his chest so close that his clean, crisp scent surrounded her.
"Austin! What are you doing?" Brinley's heart gave a sudden jolt, but she struggled to stay calm, raising her eyes to meet his.

His breath brushed her forehead, warm and steady.His eyes, swirling like a deep vortex, carried a hunger for control that she recognized, along with a trace of nervous tension he rarely revealed.


"Brinley," he called in a low, husky voice, "what do l mean to you?"


The question took Brinley by surprise.


Looking at his face so up close, seeing the rare earnestness in his eyes; she suddenly didn't know how to answer.



Her silence stretched as the elevator doors slid shut again.


In the enclosed space, only their breathing filled the air, and a subtle tension hovered above them.


Austin stared down at her lips, noticing the faint trace of cream left from the cake she had eaten earlier. It drew him in like a tempting candy.


His Adam's apple bobbed, and he instinctively leaned in closer.


Brinley's heart pounded, but she didn't close her eyes. Instead, she stared back at his approaching face.



Their lips were just about to meet when the elevator dinged again.


The doors opened slowly, revealing another floor.Brinley was still pressed lightly against the cold elevator wall, and Austin hadn't backed away, the two of them still standing close enough to feel each other's breath.



"Mr. Moore?" A surprised voice broke the moment.



Brinley turned her head and saw Melany Cooper,the marketing director from the neighboring company standing outside the elevator with a cup of coffee in hand. Her eyes flicked from Austin to Brinley,lingering with thinly veiled curiosity.


Austin moved a step to the side, giving Brinley a little more space, yet he still kept his arm around her,holding her close as if to shield her from jostling passersby.


Brinley could feel Melany's scrutinizing eyes sweeping over them, as if silently saying she understood exactly what she'd walked in on. That look made Brinley uneasy, but she didn't appear flustered.
Melany didn't stay long. With a quick excuse, she walked off, leaving Brinley and Austin undisturbed once again.
###Chapter 43 Rosara





On the way back, Brinley and Austin sat in silence in the car, neither of them attempting to start a conversation.


When they reached Hillcrest Villa, dinner was already set out in the kitchen. It was a collection of light and homely dishes.


Because Austin had ongoing stomach troubles, his doctor had recommended a bland diet.


Brinley had gotten used to following this routine with him, and tonight she quietly focused on finishing her meal.


The silence became unbearable after dinner. Brinley,seeking escape, grabbed her yoga mat and slipped away to the home gym.


She rolled it out and eased into a flawless downward-facing dog pose just as Austin walked in, wearing a grey tracksuit.
The loose outfit gave him ease of movement, and his half-open collar faintly revealed thesharp line of his collarbone.
"Your posture isn't right," he said as he stood near her, looking down. "Lift your hips a little more, and don't lock your knees."
"I've been practicing this for six months. It's already perfect," Brinley shot back defiantly as she deliberately straightened her legs even more.
Then, without a word, Austin bent down and placed his hand gently on her waist.
The warmth of his fingertips seeped through the thin fabric of her outfit, making Brinley stiffen as her breath hitched.
"Like this, raise up," he said.
His touch made Brinley's arms weaken, and she nearly toppled onto the mat. "What are you doing?" she shouted, straightening quickly, her voice brimming with irritation.


"Correcting your posture," Austin replied, pulling his hand back. His voice was serious, but there was a playful glint in his eyes. "What's wrong? Are you uncomfortable with me helping you?"


"I'm not," Brinley said stubbornly, rolling up her mat before walking toward the stairs.


A soft laugh sounded behind her, brushing against her heart like a feather and leaving an unexplainable rush behind.


With her will to keep exercising gone, Brinley headed straight to her bedroom.


Soon after, the gym lights went out, and the glow from the study replaced them.


It was clear Austin had gone to work.


Later, even that light dimmed into darkness.


Unable to sleep, Brinley tossed and turned before finally getting up for a glass of ice water.
She left the main lights off, moving carefully by the pale light of the moon spilling through the window.
She had just opened the fridge when she heard footsteps approaching.
Startled, she turned, only to see Austin in his pajamas.
His figure blurred in the dimness, yet the tall, distinct outline of his frame was impossible to mistake.
"Still awake?" he asked, his deep voice roughened from long hours of work but carrying an oddly compelling texture.
Brinley's heart jolted suddenly. She didn't answer,only reached for the bottle of water.
Noticing her unease, Austin let out a soft laugh. "Did I upset you earlier, in the elevator?"
"No," Brinley muttered, her voice faint, almost inaudible. "So... you were shy?" Austin teased lightly.
Brinley was stunned to silence for a moment,realizing he always had a way of pressing exactly the right buttons to unsettle her.
She avoided his eyes and turned toward the staircase. "I'm tired. I'm going to sleep."
Austin's laughter trailed after Brinley, and just as she reached the turn of the staircase, he called out,"Goodnight."
His voice was soft, but it seemed to echo right inside Brinley's ears.
For a moment, she hesitated, then quickly continued upward without turning back, retreating into her room.
That night, she turned under the covers again and again before at last slipping into a deep, heavy sleep.
Over the next few days, Brinley carefully kept her distance. She avoided staying too long in the same space as Austin. Yet he carried on as if nothing had changed, casually calling her to meals and discussing things when necessary.


Gradually, the tension she felt began to ease in this routine, giving her a sense of calm.

Late one night, around eleven, light still spilled from the study.


Brinley paused at the doorway, a cup of warm milk in her hand, while the steady clatter of Austin's keyboard told her he was stillburied in work.


She took a slow breath and gently pushed the half-open door wider.


The air inside the room held the faint blend of ink and coffee.


Austin sat in a dark grey set of loungewear,his collar loose with two buttons undone, the soft glow of the desk lamp bathing his face, softening its characteristic sharpness.

 
A pile of thick documents sat in front of him, and he was so absorbed in them that he didn't even notice her come in.
Brinley stepped closer and placed the milk on the desk. "Still busy?" she asked softly.
Only then did he look up at her. His eyes looked tired,but the instant he saw her, they softened at once."Almost finished. Why aren't you asleep yet?"
"I tried. I couldn't," she said, pulling a chair closer to sit beside him. "So I brought you some milk."
Closing his laptop, Austin leaned back in his chair. He took a slow sip, letting the warmth slide down his throat and ease some of his exhaustion.
As he lowered the cup, his elbow brushed the desk drawer, and a click followed.
The impact caused the half-open drawer to slide out fully, exposing the carefully arranged contents inside.
Brinley's eyes landed there instinctively, and she gasped at what she saw. Inside the drawer wasn't paperwork or personal
items, but a neatly arranged collection of detailed racing models. Each one gleamed,clearly treated with care.
They were all 1:18 scale replicas, crafted with intricate detail and obviously kept as prized collectibles.
In the center sat the most striking of them all-a bright red car marked boldly with the word "Rosara."
On its plate, a small engraving read,20Sriarrough Grand Prix Champion Car."
That had been Brinley's final championship before she retired, the race that became the highlight of her career.
In the world of racing, she had been known as "Rosara."
###Chapter 44 Are You Into Racing, Too




Brinley stared on at the red racing model, almost gasping in shock.


How on earth did Austin come to own that? And why was it displayed so prominently in the center of his collection?



"You like these racing models?" Austin's voice drifted over, carrying a hint of nonchalance. "I picked these up back when I was obsessed with racing. They have just been sitting there since then; I never really got around to tossing them out."


Snapping herself back to the present, Brinley forced down the wave of emotions threatening to rise,struggling to keep her tone calm. "You...you used to race?"


"Yeah, there was a period when I was fascinated by it." With a casual flick of his wrist, Austin closed the drawer. "But once I took charge of the company, I stopped racing. Why do you ask?"


"Nothing. Just... these models are so finely crafted."Brinley stared straight into Austin's eyes, searching their depths for a trace of memory.


Throughout her years on the track, she had encountered countless opponents. Their eyes had always burned with passion, shrewd calculation, and stubborn defiance.


Austin's eyes, however, were calm and unfathomable, like a deep well that revealed nothing at all.


"Bought them on a whim." He reached for a file on the desk, clearly uninterested in elaborating. "Are you into racing,too?"


"A little," Brinley replied. "The thrill of speed has always drawn me in."


But her words trailed off as she glanced down,fearful of revealing too much.


Could it be that he already knew who she really was? Was he deliberately showing her his interest in racing?
"The faster you go, the more dangerous it gets,"Austin remarked, his tone as detached as if he were dissecting a quarterly report.
"True." Brinley no longer felt like keeping the conversation going. She stood, took the empty milk cup in hand, and said, "You should get some rest;don't stay up too late."
"Alright." Austin's eyes followed her brisk exit, a flicker of curiosity crossing his face, but he made no move to stop her.
Brinley all but rushed out of the study, and by the time she reached her room, her palms had been damp with sweat.
Leaning against the door, she replayed the sight of those racing models and Austin's unnervingly calm tone when speaking about them. Her mind whirled with thoughts.
That red race car was the very one she had driven to victory-a championship model produced in fewer than fifty units worldwide.


It was such a coincidence that he owned one.


Back then, she had competed under the alias "Rosara," hailed as the queen of racing drivers,winning multiple titles and gathering an enormous following. If Austin truly admired racing, it would make sense for him to collect a model of her championship car.


In the days that followed, Brinley found herself increasingly drawn to watching him.


At dinner, whenever racing was mentioned on the sports news, he always had sharp, precise insights.


He could break down a racer's split-second miscalculation, identify an engine failure, or point out technical detailsthat even engineers might overlook.


Brinley's doubts only grew, pushing her to test him.


That Friday night, Austin finished work earlier than ###Chapter 44 Are You Into Racing, Too              +120 Points at inost
usual. They sat side by side in the living room, the television tuned to a racing broadcast.
A replay of a classic race came on, and Brinley's breath stalled when the camera panned over the stands.
The footage was from her final race before retirement, and in the corner of the crowd, a hooded figure bore an unsettling resemblance to Austin.
She clenched the cushion tightly, her eyes flicking to him despite herself.
Austin was quietly peeling an orange, his face softened by the glow of the screen, seemingly unaware of her unease.
"That racer was incredible," Brinley remarked, her voice carrying a forced lightness. "Her last race was unforgettable."
Austin held a slice of orange to her lips, answering evenly, "She was good."
"You watched it?" she asked. "I saw a replay with a client," he said smoothly,brushing her lips with his fingertips as he offered the fruit."Is it sweet?"


Pulled back into the moment, Brinley felt her cheeks grow hot. She bit into the orange and muttered,"Yeah."


The broadcast droned on, but her mind drifted elsewhere.



She studied Austin's profile, thinking he was like a book written in a code she couldn't crack, each page holding something hidden.


She decided to test him. Leaving a racetrack design where he would easily see it, she waited. He glanced once before casually commenting, "That curve's drawn the wrong way. It's dangerous and can cause accidents."



"How do you know that?" Brinley asked, forcing her voice to stay steady.


Austin paused with his glass in hand, answering without hesitation, "From virtual racing simulations.
Angles like that, when reversed, always cause skids."


Brinley frowned slightly. Virtual racing?


His expression was so straightforward that she suddenly felt foolish for doubting him.


Maybe she really was reading too much into it.Perhaps his knowledge came only from old hobbies and simulation games.


Choosing not to push further, she turned her focus back to work.



They had been notified that the CloudVista Estates project would be suspended for quite some time.


It had originally been designed as a major undertaking that demanded the combined effort of the entire company. But with such a long delay ahead, waiting it out simply wasn't practical.


She decided that they should shift their focus and take on other projects. When news broke that the government had announced a tender for a racing-themed real estate project, Brinley was right in the middle of a project kickoff meeting.
All the key staff had been called in.
On the conference room screen, the post-mortem analysis of their last failed commercial complex was still up, while Brinley absentmindedly rolled the stylus between her fingers, her brow tightly drawn.
"Brinley, take a look at this!" Corbin rushed in,holding up his phone. "The government just posted a tender for a racing-themed real estate project. It's a huge opportunity. Should we go after it?"

###Chapter 45 You're Also Standing Behind Me
"What did you just say?" Brinley's eyes flared,excitement sparking through her like a live wire.
Corbin slid his phone into her hand, the screen glowing with a government notice. "A five-hundred-acre racing-themed complex is set for the outskirts of Bleron, with bidding open to every company...
"Racing-themed..." Brinley whispered, her fingertips brushing over the bolded words as her breath quickened, chest rising and fallig in a rush.
The project fit her to perfection, like someone had carved it straight out of her own ambitions.
Across the long table, employees exchanged surprised looks, baffled by why their composed,untouchable boss suddenly burned with such fierce light in her gaze.
Only Brinley grasped the weight of what stood before her-and how sharply it could tilt the course of her company's development.


"Enough for now. We'll take a break!" She sprang to her feet and swept the jacket off her chair. "Corbin,email me the full project dossier right now. I want every policy, every planning map, down to the smallest detail."



"But what should we do with the rest of today's agenda..."


"Push everything back." Brinley spoke with flint in her voice, steady and uncompromising. "We cannot afford to lose-this project must be ours!"


During the ride back to Hillcrest Villa, she stayed on the phone with her assistant, racing through specs and timelines while the car sped smoothly along the road.


The Bluetooth console kept flashing with Austin's incoming calls, but without so much as a glance, she declined each one. <###Chapter 45 You're Also Standing Behind Me    +120 Points at most Her thoughts spun with visions of hairpin curves and sweeping straights, of luxury suites overlooking the circuit, of how the roar of racing could blend seamlessly with bustling commercial plazas.
In her mind, the thunder of engines returned,vibrating through her chest as vividly as if she were already standing trackside.
When the sleek black car finally rolled past the ornate gates of the villa's neighborhood, her eyes caught a tall figure waiting at the entrance.
Austin stood motionless in a tailored gray suit, the iron gates behind him, his steady gaze locked on the approaching vehicle.
Brinley slammed the brakes, and as the window slid down, his calm yet commanding presence seemed to sweep into the car with the evening air.
"You ignored my calls." Austin's voice stayed even,but his gaze cut straight through her.
"Sorry, I was tied up," Brinley hurriedly explained, unfastening her seatbelt. She shoved the car door open, clutching the freshly printed project packet so tightly the corners had already crumpled.


Austin's eyes dropped to the stack in her hands, his brows drawing together. "The government's racing-themed complex project?"


"You've heard about it too?" A spark leapt into Brinley's eyes. She thrust the documents toward him with both hands. "Look at this-an FIA Grade 2 circuit layout, a themed hotel designed around racing culture. This project is so me! It's a perfect fit!"


Words tumbled out of her in a rush, her cheeks tinged pink with excitement, completely oblivious to the softness in Austin's eyes as he watched her glow.


"You're really passionate about this?" Austin pressed, flipping the packet open. His fingers lingered on the bold phrase "racing-themed," his voice steady but laced with curiosity.


"Passionate doesn't even cover it." Brinley's voice rang with conviction. "This is the chance our company needs to rise again."


A faint flicker of surprise crossed his features before his composure returned. "So you're planning to bid?"


"Without question," she answered with a firm nod,her tone resolute.


Austin flipped open the terms page and discovered that the design proposal needed to be submitted within three months. His brow lifted as he muttered,"That's a brutal timeline. Besides, there's so much tied up in it. Government permits, sponsor coordination, motorsport certifications-your company alone can't shoulder all that."


"I know it won't be easy." Fixing her gaze on him,Brinley's voice rang with fierce, unwavering grit."But after the last project collapsed, we need a milestone to prove we can stand tall again."


"Want my help?" Austin shut the folder, his expression suddenly intent. "Moore Group has a team that knows every corner of this system-the government, the association. I can line up the funding anytime."
He delivered it with a quiet authority, as if summoning an army of resources were no more difficult than flipping a switch.
A rush of warmth spread through Brinley's chest.With Austin's backing, the project would be hers for the taking.
Yet, she shook her head. "No need. I appreciate it though." Drawing in a breath, she met his gaze with clear, unyielding eyes. "I need to do this on my own."
Arching a brow, he queried, "And why's that?"
"Because this company is mine-it's my battleground." Locking onto his gaze without flinching, Brinley's voice carried a sharp conviction."The Moore Group is powerful, and your network is unmatched-I'm well aware. But I refuse to spend my life buried in another's shadow. Confidence is forged with every project you see through."
A gentler note slipped into her tone, yet the strength in her words remained resolute. "I don't want people to remember me only as Austin's wife or the Shaw family's daughter. I want them to say Brinley stands out, and so does her company." The breeze stirred her hair, strands brushing against her cheek, while the last streaks of sunset spilled across her shouders like a crown of gold.
Austin studied the pride and unshakable will in her eyes, instantly recalling that scene at the Moore Estate when she stood her ground against Ryder and his family, cutting down their provocation with a sharp,fearless rebuttal.
Brinley had never been the kind of woman who hid behind others. She carried her own defenses, her own foundation, and a vision for what she wanted to achieve.
"Are you sure?" He fixed his eyes on her. "This project is riddled with hidden traps, and there are powerful players moving in the shadows. On your own,you..." "I'm not on my own," Brinley swiftly cut him off with a confident curve of her lips. "I have my team, my skills,and..."

Her eyes flicked to him, softening as she added with quiet certainty, "And Austin, you're also standing behind me, aren't you?"
###Chapter 46 He Looks Out For You In Every Detail
Austin felt a faint warmth ripple through him at Brinley's words, like someone had brushed against his heart with the gentlest touch.


A low chuckle escaped him as he reached out,his hand sliding through Brinley's hair in a casual ruffle that felt far too natural, as if it had been a habit for years. "You're right. I'll have your back," he said with quiet amusement.


As he passed the documents back,his tone softened and an indulgent smile appeared on his lips. "If this is what you want, then go for it. Just promise me you won't wear yourself out. And if anything crops up that you can't handle, come to me first."


Brinley nodded, her voice steady. "I understand."


As she took the file, her fingertips brushed lightly against the back of his hand. The accidental contact sent a spark through both of them, and they drew back at once, as if scalded. The air between them thickened, charged with something unspoken.
Breaking the silence, Austin cleared his throat and shifted his gaze toward the villa."Come on, let's go inside. It's too cold out here."

Brinley trailed after him, her gaze following the tall,steady lines of his back, and a quiet reassurance settled in her chest.

Austin rarely wore his heart on his sleeve, but when it mattered, his presence was unshakable.
The chandelier overhead spilled a golden wash across the dining room, its light glinting off polished silverware. The butler had already laid out dinner,everything in place.
Brinley slid into her seat, still riffling through the project files spread before her. Her lips moved as she calculated. "The track's buffer zone has to be at least eight meters wide..."
Austin nudged a steaming bowl of soup closer, his voice carrying a thread of exasperated fondness."Eat first."
Her head jerked up, startled from her thoughts."Alright." She dipped the spoon into the broth and sipped obediently, though her eyes lingered on the documents as if tethered.
Watching her drift between dinner and diagrams,Austin found himself thinking that maybe this project was exactly what she needed.
What shone in her eyes, at least, was real, and the fire she carried when talking shop made her far more captivating than when she had to suffer the empty niceties of his family.
"That reminds me," Austin said, recalling something."There's a racing association banquet coming up.Plenty of industry players will be there-including the person overseeing this project. Want to attend with  me?" Brinley tipped him a playful wink, a smile tugging at her lips. "Already taken care of."
His brows lifted, a hint of surprise flickering through his calm expression.
Dinner wound down to the background sound of her distracted murmurs, half-formed ideas slipping out between bites.
Once the meal ended, she retreated quickly to her study, clutching the files with restless determination,intent on burning the midnight oil to draft a preliminary proposal.
Austin didn't interfere, only murmuring an instruction to the butler to warm a cup of milk and bring it in.
From the doorway of the study, he lingered in silence, watching her hunched over the desk as her pen flew across the page. A faint smile curved his lips before he even realized it.
Pulling out his phone, he dialed Miguel. His tone was arlow but decisive. "Look into every company bidding on the racing-themed complex. Gather the blueprints for all the racetracks in Bleron and deliver them to my villa." When the call ended, he leaned against the doorframe, his gaze fixed on Brinley's focused expression.
The lamplight threw delicate shadows beneath her lashes, her brows drawn tight in thought, making her look strikingly radiant.
With three demanding weeks behind her, Brinley's world had been overtaken by work. Long hours and endless tasks had become her rhythm.
One morning at six, just as dawn was breaking, she darted into the garage while biting into a sandwich.
The passenger seat overflowed with folders, while the backseat was buried under design plans scribbled over with dense notes-numbers, track curves, sharp calculations. Today she intended to head straight to the project site, determined to capture precise slope data before
the workers even arrived.
Miguel glanced back from the driver's seat,extending a thermos with both hands. His voice carried a careful note. "From Mr. Moore, for your lunch,Mrs.Moore."
Brinley froze halfway through fastening her seatbelt,her eyes landing on the familiar thermos.
For nearly a week now, she had been leaving at dawn and coming home past midnight, without a single shared meal with Austin.
On the rare nights she returned to find him waiting in the living room, only a few clipped exchanges passed between them before they drifted off to separate rooms.
"Okay then." She slid the thermos into the stack of documents on her lap and said evenly, "Let's go."
As the car eased out of the villa gates, her gaze flicked to the glowing windows of the main house in the mirror. A pang of guilt pricked her chest, but it was quickly drowned by the tide of deadlines and calculations pressing in on her mind.
The project had reached a perilous crossroads, the blueprint already torn apart and rebuilt over ten rounds of revisions.
Government pressure bore down relentlessly, while rival firms circled like vultures, leaving Brinley no room for distraction.
Upon arriving at the project site, she immediately plunged into taking measurements.
Sneakers scuffed through dust as she moved with a laser distance meter in hand, crisscrossing the barren stretch. Sweat dampened her hair until it clung to her cheeks, itchy and slick against her skin.She was so absorbed in her work that the whole morning slipped away without her noticing.
Corbin, now officially her assistant, hurried over with a tissue, his tone threaded with concern. "Brinley, <###Chapter 46 He Looks Out For You In Every Deta+120 Points at most please, slow down for a minute. You haven't had any water since you arrived."
"No worries, I'll take a break after I get through this bit," Brinley replied, dabbing at her forehead but never breaking her focus on the ridgeline ahead.
Her eyes narrowed as she went on, "This slope's sharper than our initial survey showed. If we don't adjust the track layout, it could become a safety hazard."
Not until the sun reached its brutal peak-scorching the soil until heat shimmered off the ground-did she finally lead her team into the shade of the hastily erected shed.
Corbin helped pop open Brinley's thermos, and a rich fragrance of broth and steamed egg instantly drifted through the air. Inside was a hearty soup, thick with warmth, and two smooth eggs nestled at the surface.
His eyes brightened as he leaned closer. "Mr. Moore made this for you? It smells incredible." Brinley lifted the spoon and took a careful sip.
The heat lingered on her tongue, chasing away the fatigue that had been dragging her down for days.With each mouthful, the tension in her chest began to ease.
Watching her eat, Corbin tore into his bread and grinned. "The two of you really have it good. He looks out for you in every detail."
Brinley laughed softly, the corners of her eyes curving with amusement. "Don't twist it into something tender. He just doesn't want me to starve to death."

Her words carried a joking edge, yet she never slowed her pace, polishing off every last drop of soup until the bowl was empty.
###Chapter 47 Your Health Matters More


The afternoon meeting dragged on from two until six, only to be followed immediately by a video conference with the design institute.

When Brinley finally had a moment to breathe, night had already settled in outside the windows.

She rubbed at her aching temples as she stepped out of the meeting room and found Miguel waiting by the company entrance.

"Mr. Moore told me if you weren't done by eight, I should get you home no matter what," Miguel said awkwardly.

Brinley checked the time. It was nearly nine o'clock.

That was when she remembered the message Austin had sent that morning. It read, "Come home early tonight; I have something to tell you."

She had replied casually, "Okay." Then she had completely forgotten about it.

"Alright, let's go," Brinley said, opening the car door. The moment she sat down, her eyelids felt unbearably heavy.

She leaned against the back seat and closed her eyes. Her mind, however, wouldn't stop circling back to the design drafts.

She had dozed off until Miguel's gentle voice roused her. "Mrs. Moore, we're here."

Brinley opened her eyes and saw the villa's living room lit up, a soft golden glow streaming out through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

When she opened the door and stepped inside, she saw that Austin was sitting on the sofa with a newspaper open in front of him.

"You're back," he said quietly, glancing up at her face. There was a hint of tiredness in his eyes, but no trace of irritation about her late return.

Brinley strode over. She asked softly, "Were you waiting long?"

"Not really," Austin replied, setting the newspaper aside and motioning to the seat next to him. "Come sit."

The faint smell of tobacco mixed with the familiar cedar scent on him instantly eased the tension that had clung to her all day.

"How was the soup today? Did you like it?" he murmured.

"It was good." Brinley stared into Austin's eyes, a feeling of unease creeping into her chest."Thank you."

"Then why did you only drink the soup and leave the eggs untouched?" he asked, sounding clearly displeased.

Brinley blinked in surprise. He even knew about that?

Lowering her head, she whispered, "I had the soup and then rushed to my meeting. After that, I got busy."

Austin gently tilted her chin up, making her look at him, the concern in his eyes unmistakable. "Brinley, the project matters, but your health matters more. If you break down, who's going to see it through?"

"I'm fine..."

"No, you're not," he said firmly, cutting her off."Look at yourself. Dark circles under your eyes, hands freezing cold. Keep this up, and you'll end up in the hospital before the project's done."

Brinley fell silent, lowering her head again.

Austin sighed. Instead of scolding her further, he went to the kitchen and returned with a cup of warm water."Here. Drink this first."

After watching her take a sip, he said suddenly, "From tomorrow, you're to be home by eight every night."

"No way!" Brinley blurted out. "Evenings are the only time I can revise the drafts. Eight is far too early."

"Then work on them the next day," Austin replied without hesitation. "I've already told Miguel to notify your  building management to cut the power after eight."

"Austin!" Brinley gasped, staring at him in frustration. "How can you do that?"

He met her eyes, a resolute look in his. "Either you come home on time, or I'll make sure your project doesn't move forward."

Brinley studied his expression, knowing he wasn't bluffing. He was never one to go back on his word.Especially when it came to her, he was unyielding.

Her eyes stung as she glared at him. She knew he was worried, but the way he interfered so forcefully with her work left her feeling cornered.

She tried to reason with him. "I'm working on an important..."

"Nothing is more important than your health," Austin said, reaching out and running a hand through her hair with such an unexpected gentleness. "Make sure you look after yourself, okay?"

Those words carried such tenderness that they struck directly at Brinley's heart, and her anger melted like ice in the sun.

She sniffed lightly and muttered, "Fine."

Austin softened when he saw her give in. "There's porridge in the kitchen, kept warm. Go eat some."

"I don't want any; I'm not hungry."

"You still need to eat." He stood, pulling her up insistently.therwise, I'll call your team right now and give them all a day off tomorrow."

Dragged into the kitchen, Brinley watched him scoop a bowl of steaming seafood porridge from the pot. It was filled with her favorite ingredients, cooked until perfectly tender. The aroma alone was comforting.

"Eat." Austin placed the spoon in her hand and leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, watching intently.

Brinley reluctantly lifted a spoonful to her mouth. The warmth spread through her stomach, easing the exhaustion and refreshing her almost instantly. She glanced up to see Austin watching her closely, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

"Why aren't you eating?" she asked.

"I'll eat once you've finished." Austin's reply was casual.

"Alright," Brinley said softly and continued eating.

The porridge was served at the perfect warmth-neither scalding nor lukewarm-showing it had been reheated more than once so it would be ready the moment she came home.

It was only then that Brinley realized Austin hadn't had anything urgent to tell her. He just wanted to be there,making sure she ate.
###Chapter 48 I'm Only Here To Accompany My Wife


After Brinley finished her porridge, Austin washed the plates with quiet focus. She lingered in the doorway with her arms folded, studying him.

His casual home clothes looked understated, his sleeves rolled back to reveal lean, defined forearms.Though his dishwashing was clumsy at best, the simple effort carried a warmth that wrapped around her like a blanket.

This was the same man who could be cold and commanding in public, yet here he was-patiently cooking soup for her, reminding her to eat, insisting she rest early.

Her chest softened with a sudden rush of emotion.

"Austin," she murmured, her voice gentle. "Thank you."

With a sideways glance, Austin's eyes gleamed in amusement. "What exactly are you thanking me for? For making you finish your porridge?"

"Yes." Brinley gave a sincere nod, her voice softening. "And... thank you for looking out for me."

The moment the words slipped free, a rush of embarrassment flushed her cheeks. She spun on her heel,hurrying toward the stairs with a flustered wave. "Anyway-it's late! I should get some rest!"

Austin's eyes followed her retreating figure. A quiet laugh escaped him, his gaze warm with unspoken affection.

Weeks drifted past like a breath, and before long, the evening of the racing association's banquet was upon them.

Brinley had planned to show up solo, but Austin insisted on going with her, swearing he'd keep to the background as the quiet plus-one.

Resistance didn't last; she agreed with a small,resigned nod. With her arm hooked through Austin's, Brinley crossed the threshold into the gilded hall, attention snapping toward them at once.

Stares drifted their way-some curious, some appraising, and some brimming with outright hostility.

"Looks like my wife is drawing more eyes than the project tonight." Austin kept his voice low and teasing as his thumb pressed lightly at her wrist, a quiet reassurance.

Brinley brushed past his words without a second thought, her eyes drifting over the shifting tide of people.

Grayson Deleon, the man spearheading the project, was nowhere in sight, yet the hall buzzed with businessmen who had clearly come because of him.

She even caught the sharp profiles of several well-known racers.

Back when she competed, the helmet had always shielded her face, and anonymity had suited her. Now she had even less desie to let anyone connect her to that past life.

Sure enough,Colin and Milly had shown up as well.

The moment Brinley's gaze found Colin, his eyes snapped to hers, surprise flickering across his face like a sudden spark.

Colin strode in wearing a tailored gray suit, two tumblers of amber whiskey balanced in his hands. His eyes lingered on Brinley a moment longer than courtesy allowed before he approached with unhurried steps."Brinley. Mr. Moore. What a surprise running into you here."

"Mr. Palmer, are you here for the same project?" Brinley ignored the drink he extended, instead smoothing a loose strand of hair back behind her ear. Her expression stayed calm, her voice measured, yet the faint coolness in her tone kept distance between them.

The project's profits had drawn in a swarm of ambitious real estate developers, and she had already anticipated Colin would be among those vying for it.

he replied, his gaze sweeping over her with thinly veiled interest. "But tell me,Brinley-what brings you here today?" In Colin's memory, Brinley had always seemed the last person to be linked with racing.

Her gaze stayed calm as she answered, voice cool and detached, "That isn't something you need to concern yourself with."

Austin smoothly slid a glass of champagne into her hand, his movement casual yet deliberate as he blocked Colin's line of sight. His tone carried quiet confidence, edged with warning. "From what I recall, Palmer Group's strengths lie in commercial real estate. Taking on a racing-themed project might prove more difficult than expected."

For a split second, Colin's grin faltered before he regained composure. "Don't worry, we've brought in a seasoned team. Tell me, Mr. Moore-are you competing for the project as well?"

Austin's mouth curved faintly, his reply unhurried but firm. "I'm only here to accompany my wife." With a steady arm around her waist, he guided Brinley toward the center of the venue and added, "Whatever she wants to do, I'm behind her one hundred percent."

While they moved, Brinley felt Colin's stare press between her shoulder blades-and sensed a second,colder gaze lingering at the edge of the lights.

By a nearby pillar, Milly lingered with a knot of socialites, trading murmurs and quick, sidelong looks.

A moment later, her voice drifted over-soft enough to sound innocent, clear enough for the crowd to catch."Colin, doesn't it seem a bit reckless for Mrs. Moore, who's never even sat in a go-kart, to jump into a racing-themed real estate project?" A light laugh slipped from her as she added, "Maybe with Mr. Moore paving the way, any project turns into a sure thing?"

Her mocking words were nothing short of grating.

Around them, the cluster of socialites went quiet, lips flattening as their gazes flicked back and forth between Brinley and Austin, clearly waiting for the scene to break open.

By design, Milly pitched her comment to the room, angling it to imply Brinley landed projects-only on Austin's influence.

Brinley's fingers cinched around the chilled champagne flute. "Seems you're awfully invested in me, Miss Russell." A breath later, she pivoted, her voice steady and bright.

Milly blinked, thrown off balance by the reply she hadn't expected in place of polite silence.

Brinley fixed her eyes on Milly, her voice cutting with quiet certainty. "Mr. Deleon is respected for his integrity. He despises those who attempt to use their influence to sway his decisions. Are you suggesting he'd entrust the project to an unqualified party?"

Milly's cheeks burned crimson. Her eyes watered almost instantly as she stammered, "I... I didn't mean anything by it..."

Austin's voice carried a sharp edge. "Then you should think before you speak next time," he said, stepping in front of Brinley, his shoulders squared as his eyes swept coldly across Milly. "Miss Russell, if idle chatter is all you have to offer, why not lend the waitstaff a hand with the trays? At least that would be more useful than peddling gossip."

A ripple of muffled laughter stirred through the crowd.

Milly's lashes trembled, her eyes brimming as if on the verge of spilling over. Yet she swallowed back any reply, only sending Colin a helpless, wounded look, as though begging him to intervene. 
 ###Chapter 49 There Is Nothing Left Between Himn And Me


Colin's brow knit as if he meant to argue, but when his eyes met Austin's glacial stare, the retort died in his throat.

With forced ease, he remarked, "Milly crossed the line. I owe you an apology on her behalf, Mr. Moore."

Austin didn't soften. "You should keep your wife in line. It would reflect poorly on you if she continues to...embarrass herself," he said flatly, tightening his hold on Brinley and steering her away without a backward glance.

Once they reached a quiet terrace, Brinley released a sharp little huff of annoyance.

Austin slipped off his suit jacket and settled it over her shoulders, the fabric carrying his warmth and chasing off the chill in the night air.

"Does that count as revenge well served?" he queried, leaning one elbow against the railing while his gaze drifted to the glowing track lights in the distance. "People like Milly deserve to be put in their place."

Brinley let out another huff, irritation still tugging at her expression. "I asked you to stay put, but you insisted on coming anyway."

"Alright, alright, blame me," Austin sighed with a helpless curve of his lips before steering the conversation elsewhere. His tone grew quieter, more probing. "You and Colin... there truly isn't any possibility left between you?"

Brinley froze for a moment, caught off guard by the unexpected question.

She gave a small shake of her head and said with quiet certainty, "There is nothing left between him and me.We're done. From now on, my only focus is my company-I don't want to be distracted by anything else."

Austin didn't answer, though a faint, knowing curve touched his lips.

They lingered on the terrace side by side, their eyes drawn to the glowing track below. The breeze carried the low hum of engines across the night air, wrapping them in a strangely intimate stillness. Brinley's mind drifted unbidden to years ago, when she sat behind the wheel of a race car.

The helmet pressed tight around her head, the roar of the engine deafened her ears, and in the mirror loomed a relentless rival chasing her down. Ahead, the finish line's blinding lights cut through the darkness,urging her forward.

Austin's voice pulled her back from the memory."What's on your mind?"

"Nothing important," Brinley said with a fleeting smile. "Just a flash of inspiration for how the track design could take shape."

Austin arched a brow, a trace of amusement flickering in his gaze. "Oh? Want to let me in on it?"

Brinley leaned forward, her eyes alight. "I'm thinking of installing a glass curtain wall between the commercial district and the track... and redesigning the go-kart park into a scaled-down professional circuit..."

Her words tumbled out faster, her excitement bubbling over, completely unaware of how intently Austin was watching her.

The more she spoke, the more it struck him-when Brinley talked about racing and design, she radiated a quiet fluency, as if this world belonged to her bones rather than something studied on paper.

"You've got some bold ideas," Austin interjected smoothly, though his tone carried an edge of scrutiny."Funny thing, though-you talk about track parameters as if you've lived them. You even quoted the safety threshold for centrifugal force without hesitation."

Brinley's breath caught, the rush of enthusiasm halting as a sharp jolt shot through her chest.

Swept up in her excitement, she revealed technical details-far beyond what any ordinary designer would know.

"I dabbled in it before," she noted lightly, lifting her glass for a slow sip of wine to hide the sudden tightness in her chest. "Some of it seemed useful, so I committed it to memory." Austin didn't challenge her explanation, but his gaze lingered, steady and unyielding.

The weight of it made her skin prickle. Just as she searched for an excuse to slip back into the crowd, the project manager appeared.Grayson came toward them with a glass of wine, his smnile wide and his cheeks flushed from drink.

"Mr. Moore, Mrs. Moore-apologies for the delay. I was tied up in a discussion with a few experts about the track planning. I didn't realize you'd arrived already."

"There's no need for apologies, Mr. Deleon,"Austin remarked, taking his hand in a firm shake. His voice carried a composed warmth. "My wife has a keen interest in this project, so I thought it best to bring her here."

Grayson let out a warm laugh, but his eyes held a sharp edge as they flicked toward Brinley. "Mrs. Moore,you've accomplished quite a lot for someone so young. I even heard from Mr. Palmer that your team has been coming up with some bold ideas. Still, in the end, only the best plan will take the prize, won't it?"

The implication was clear enough-Colin had already been speaking about her behind closed doors, and whatever he said likely wasn't flattering.

Brinley drew a breath, ready to respond, when Colin smoothly cut in, "Mr. Deleon, both my team and Brinley's are approaching this with genuine sincerity. Perhaps we should use this chance to go over the project's exact requirements together?"

His sudden appearance came with Milly on his arm. She had regained her composure, but her simmering resentment still glimmeredwhenever her gaze landed on Brinley.

Grayson, sensing the undercurrent, curved his lips in a diplomatic smile. "That sounds reasonable. A few other designers are here as well-let's all sit down and exchange ideas."

The group began filing toward the meeting room. Brinley stayed close to Austin's side, fully aware of Colin's gaze brushing over her more than once, and Milly's quiet hostility prickling like a thorn at her back..

What appeared to be a polite discussion carried an unmistakable edge, the tension threaded through every word before the real conversation had even begun. Colin's assistant fired the first shot as soon as the meeting began. "Mrs. Moore, most of your work has been in commnercial real estate. A racing project is highly specialized-don't you think you're out of your depth?For example..."

Brinley lifted her head, her gaze sharp and unwavering. "I've done my research, thanks. FIA Grade 2 circuits require honeycomb aluminum buffer zones. My team has been studying these standards for quite some time."

She flipped open her file, tapping a page with her fingertip. "Here's our preliminary cross-section. The curve has a twelve-degree incline-exactly in line with international regulations. If you'd like, my assistant can forward you the detailed specs."

The dense string of technical terms landed like blows, leaving the young man gaping. Color crept up his neck, and for a moment he was too stunned to speak.

Colin smoothly stepped in. "You've certainly done your homework, Mrs. Moore. But a racing-themed real estate development isn't only about the track. You also have to manage commercial operations-balancing professional events with public attractions, securing sponsors, and creating a sustainable business model.That kind of experience doesn't come from blueprints alone."
###Chapter 50 You Handled Yourself Well Just Now


Brinley offered Colin a measured smile, her tone laced with sarcasm. "Mr. Palmer, you make a valid point.But in the end, expertise is the solid ground beneath it all. If we can't guarantee a safe track, then all the dazzling operations are nothing more than hollow talk."

Her words landed cleanly, drawing a firm nod from Grayson. "Mrs. Moore, you're absolutely right. Safety always comes first."

Colin's face hardened, though he chose not to push back.

Beside him, Milly's nails dug into the silk of her dress as she watched Brinley sit at the center of attention,confidently exchanging ideas with seasoned professionals.

A pang twisted in her chest. She, too, had once envisioned herselfin that role-tailored suit, commanding voice, admired in a boardroom.

Yet reality had stripped her of that dream, leaving her seated quietly at Colin's side, reduced to nothing more than a decorative companion.

Envy coiled tight around Milly's chest like a strangling vine, squeezing the air from her lungs.

What the hell had Brinley ever done to deserve all this?

Why was Brinley allowed to shine so brightly after leaving Colin, while she herself, no matter how fiercely she clawed forward, was still trapped in the shadows of others?

When the meeting wrapped, Grayson gave his nod to Brinley's proposal, leaving Colin's face stiff with suppressed anger.

Trailing after Colin, Milly slowed her steps, and as they crossed paths with Brinley, she gave a sharp shoulder bump,leaning close to hiss, "Don't get cocky. This project won't fall into your hands."

Brinley didn't bother answering. Her calm gaze followed Milly's retreating figure with a detached coolness. She let out a cold sneer. Milly never understood that schemes couldn't replace skill-true success came from ability, not manipulation.

Austin laid a steady hand on Brinley's shoulder,his touch grounding her."Come on," he murmured, voice warm against the undercurrent of tension."Let's go home."

The city lights streaked past the car windows, and Brinley let her head fall back against the seat,weariness settling deep into her bones.

This endless tug-of-war, hidden barbs and polite facades, drained her more than any sleepless night spent hunched over design drafts.

"You handled yourself well just now," Austin finally said, breaking the heavy quiet. His tone carried a hint of pride. "Far more professional than I expected."

"I came prepared," Brinley murmured, pressing her fingertips against her aching temples. "But Colin's team is formidable. The real contest hasn't even begun-it's going to be brutal."

Austin turned his gaze toward her, warmth flickering in his eyes. "With me here, you have nothing to be afraid of. Even if the project slips away in the end, it'Il still sharpen your skills."

The sincerity etched across his profile stirred something inside her, an unexpected warmth that spread through her tired heart.

Over the next few days, her routine blurred into relentless cycles-dawn departures, late-night returns, and hardly a moment left to breathe.

Austin saw to it that Miguel brought her food and stayed until she ate every bite, knowing how easily she forgot.

Her design draft gradually took shape, yet with the bidding deadline loomning,it still remained incomplete.

Unwilling to lose focus, she told Austin she would be staying at the office and buried herself in the work for several days straight.

Three straight mornings passed with Brinley waking up at her desk. Shafts of crooked light pierced through the blinds, casting fractured shadows on the half-finished racetrack layout.

She had slipped into slumber in her chair, pen still in hand from the night before.

Her weary fingers skimmed the touchpad, but the section linking the track to the commercial hub stayed stubbornly blank.

That unresolved problem had pressed on her chest like a stone for three relentless days.

"Brinley, the track material samples you asked for just arrived," Corbin announced as he entered, lugging several hefty folders. His eyes widenedat the sight of her slumped at the desk. "You... stayed here all night again?"

Brinley pressed her aching temples, her voice rasping as she admitted, "Yeah... the connection design has me stuck."

She gestured toward the glaring red question mark flashing on the monitor. "The track's drainage system keeps clashing with the commercial district's underground network. I've revised it eight times already, and the balance still won't hold."

Corbin laid the folders on the desk and offered her a cup of warm milk. "You've been running on empty for three days.Why not head home and rest a little? Inspiration might come easier after some sleep."

Brinley shook her head and instead lifted her coffee, letting the bitterness sharpen her foggy mind."No need. The final draft is due in just a few days. If I cave now, all of our work will collapse with me."

She snatched up a marker and began sketching alternate pipeline routes across the blueprint.

The faint rasp of the pen against paper cut through the stillness of the office.

Yet midway through, her hand slowed again, the tip of the marker hovering uselessly over the page.

No matter how she rerouted it, the sewage lines from the commercial district still cut straight across the racetrack's foundation. Left unresolved, the overlap would one day cause the ground to sink-a fatal flaw for any professional circuit. "Damn it!" With a sharp tug, she raked her fingers through her hair and flung the pen onto the table,watching it spin before clattering to the floor.

For days, she had been living at the office, too pressed for time to go home. Austin's messages piled up unanswered, her replies delayed.

She was well aware she'd been giving him too little of her time, but the looming deadline left her no choice.

In that moment, the door eased open with a soft creak.

Assuming it was Corbin, she didn't bother to glance up. "Just leave the samples on the desk. I'll look them over later."

Yet silence followed.

Lost in confusion, she looked up and halted mid-motion.

Austin filled the doorway in a sleek black suit, a manila envelope tucked under his arm, his gaze lingering on the bloodshot haze in her eyes.

"What are you doing here?" she blurted, scrambling to straighten the chaos of her desk, but didn't know where to start.
###Chapter 51 Do You Mean To Drive Yourself Into The Ground


The office resembled a storm's aftermath-coffee rings, papers strewn everywhere, and sandwich wrappers abandoned on the desk.

Austin slipped inside without a sound, each step measured, deliberate.

A faint trace of cedar clung to him, cutting through the stale bitterness of coffee and stale bread,replacing it with a clean, woodsy sharpness.

He stopped beside Brinley, stooped to retrieve a marker that had rolled beneath her chair, set it back on the desk,then leaned close enough to brush a dark smudge from her chin with hs fingertips.

"Hold still," he murmured.

The cool touch skimmed her skin like a feather's edge, and Brinley froze, startled by the sudden shiver that chased down her spine.

"You..."

"You've been gone three days, only to hole up here? In this dump?" Austin's voice carried no clear emotion,yet the quiet worry/ in his eyes betrayed him.

His gaze drifted over the cluttered desk, lingering on the stack of drained coffee cups. His frown tightened."Running on nothing but coffee? Brinley, do you mean to drive yourself into the ground?"

Brinley shifted aside, refusing to meet his eyes, her face burning as color crept into her cheeks.

Mortification burned hotter than any project setback when he caught her rumpled and hollow-eyed at the desk.

Austin dragged out the chair opposite her and settled in, sliding a folder through the scattered pens and papers. "Look this over."

"Is this for me?" Brinley asked, brow kntting as she lifted the cover to a dense stack of pages.Across the front, the title read: "Global Top Ten Racing-Themed Case Studies."

A few quick flips sent a spark through her fatigue, and her gaze sharpened.

It featured not just detailed real-world photos and design blueprints, but also specifics on how the tracks connected with the commercial zones. The document even outlined the materials and precise diameter specifications for the drainage systems.

Her fingertips brushed across a page filled with methods to separate the track from the surrounding commercial networks-the very solution she had been agonizing over. Her voice quivered as she whispered,"This... this is exactly what I've been looking for." She lifted her gaze. "Did you ask someone to dig this up?"

"I did." Austin's reply was calm, his expression unreadable. "I knew you'd hit a wall, so l asked Miguel to contact some friends and compile these case studies."

He leaned in slightly, tapping the margin of a highlighted example. "Here-this project used an anti-seepage isolation method, building a three-meter underground barrier. Itstabilizes the track foundation while shielding the commercial system. Study this one-you might find it useful."

Brinley's eyes misted with sudden warmth. She lifted her gaze to Austin's composed profile, remembering how, just a few days earlier, she had brushed him off mid-call with nothing more than a curt, "I'm busy,"before cutting the line.

Only now did she realize-he had been doing all of this quietly for her.

"Tell me...how did you know I was in need of this?" she asked, her voice roughened with a faint catch in her throat.

"Lucky guess." Austin bent to pick up one of her crumpled drafts, smoothing it absently between his fingers. His eyes paused on the glaring red question mark scrawled across the page. "The drainage system for a professional track has to be absolutely sealed, but the commercial district's underground lines are messy by nature. Clashes like this are unavoidable. I've seen at least five similar porojects run into the same obstacle-and their solutions followed a common thread. You can adjust it according to the specifics here."

His tone carried a casual ease, yet Brinley understood that gathering those materials had been anything but simple. International cases like these were closely guarded trade secrets, impossible to buy outright. He had surely pulled strings across borders, leveraging every connection to secure such detailed internal records.

"Austin..." Her lips parted, the words "thank you" rising to the tip of her tongue, but emotion caught in her throat and left her silent.

Austin caught the shimmer in her eyes, and amusement flickered at the corner of his gaze. With a gentle hand,he mussed her hair. "Go through the materials carefully. Feel free to ask me if anything is unclear."

Brinley blinked, genuinely startled. "You actually understand this?"

"I used to dive into racing studies," he replied, lips quirking faintly. "Picked up more than a little about track infrastructure." He leaned forward, pen in hand, and circled a section on one of her drafts. "The diameter calculation here isn't right. It should be recalculated against Bleron's average rainfall. Let me jot down the proper formula for you..."

As Austin bent his head to write, the slanting sunlight poured across the desk, gilding his lashes and leaving delicate shadows beneath his eyes.

Brinley found herself staring at the quiet intensity on his face, his voice a low murmur threading through the technical jargon, and an unexpected warmth unfurled in her chest.

Though she'd already worked out the formula earlier, she chose not to reject Austin's kindness.

He wasn't one for flowery talk; he showed up with steady, practical help, clearing snags and standing with her when things turned rough.

"Lost in thought?" When he capped the marker and noticed her watching him, a smal smile tugged at his mouth.

"Huh-what?" She ducked over the stack of materials, cheeks warming as she pretended to study the page.

He spared her the tease, lifted the cup, and tipped the coffee into the bin. "Ease up on this; it's hard on your stomach. Have Corbin warm some mil. Drink it, then get back to work."

"Alright." She dipped her chin in a small, obedient nod. Austin settled into the chair across from her and let the quiet stand, turning her castoff drafts one by one with careful fingers.

Silence pooled around the office, broken only by the papery whisper of pages and the occasional scratch of her pen.

Morning light slipped through the blinds, laying a warm mosaic between them like a cozy painting come to life.

While tracing the crisp, precise notes in the materials and setting themn against her tossed drafts, she felt the old anxiety unclench and finally dissolve.

###Chapter 52 You Deserve A Real Meal


Brinley's mind slowly untangled, each past case sparking clarity until an idea struck like lightning.

She snatched up a pen, her hand moving in quick, decisive strokes across a fresh sheet.

This time the lines poured out without resistance, solutions surfacing where she had been stuck for three days.

Austin,watching from the side, felt the tight knot of worry ease from his chest, his gaze softening with a quiet tenderness.

HHe pulled out his phone and quickly typed a message to Miguel. "Tell the butler to make some soup and take it over to my wife's office."

Austin understood Brinley's stubborn streak better than anyone. Once she committed to something, there was no stopping her halfway.

He didn't intend to talk her out of the grind-his role was to build her a cushion, to make sure she felt protected and supported while she drove herself forward.

The sunlight outside mellowed, its warm glow spilling across the desk in a hazy wash of gold.

Setting her pen aside, Brinley studied the proposal, almost finished at last, and let out a slow, steady breath that loosened the tension in her shoulders.

She turned toward Austin and saw him slumped in the chair, fast asleep, her discarded drafts still clutched loosely in his hand.

She figured he had come straight from company matters, exhausted and lacking proper rest.

Brinley rose silently, fetched a blanket, and laid it gently across his shoulders.

Her gaze lingered on the hard line of his brow, furrowed even in sleep. Almost without thinking, she reached out, her fingers hovering, wanting to ease that stubborn crease. But at the last instant, she recoiled, startled by her own impulse.

Brinley sank back into her chair, her eyes lighting up at the flawless connection plan glowing across her screen, and a faint, satisfied smile tugged at her lips.

Two days before the bidding proposal's deadline, she at last sent off the completed file.

That left forty-eight precious hours before she would have to stand on stage at the bidding conference and defend it.

For once, she allowed herself to clock out early.

As she pulled into the Hillcrest Vila drive, her eyes landed on a polished black Maybach-Austin's-already stationed by the garage.

"Mr. Moore returned earlier than usual today," the butler said warmly as he accepted her bag, a faint smile tugging at his lips. "He mentioned how hard you've been working and went so far as to cook soup himself."

Brinley froze in the entryway,caught off guard.

Austin rarely had a spare moment to breathe, let alone cook. He clearly knew she'd be home earlier today,which accounted for his early return.

With that thought lingering, she quickened her steps toward the kitchen. Through the frosted glass door, a shadow shifted.

The moment she pushed the door open, the rich fragrance of mushrooms drifted out to greet her, washing away the heaviness of her long day.

Austin stood over the stove in easy loungewear, sleeves pushed to his forearms, the light catching on the smooth lines of his wrists.

With a ladle in hand, he stirred the simmering pot, his profile softened by the golden glow of the kitchen lamp-stripped of boardroom sharpness, cloaked instead in the warmth of domestic calm.

"Perfect timing," he murmured, eyes on the soup, his voice carrying the ease of someone who had done this a hundred times before."Dinner will be on the table in ten minutes." Brinley lingered at the doorway, leaning her shoulder against the frame. Watching his careful, almost awkward movements, she felt a flicker of disbelief, as if the entire moment were some tender dream.

"What made you decide to cook soup today?" she inquired.

"Noticed you've seemed run-down lately," Austin said, lifting a spoonful toward her with a faint smile. "See if the flavor works-I can add more salt if it's too plain."

The rising steam curled against her nose, fragrant with earthy mushrooms, just as the spoon reached her lips.

Brinley parted her mouth without thinking, but the instant the broth touched her tongue, she sucked in a sharp breath, the scalding heat leaving it tingling and numb.

"Did it burn you?" Austin quickly set the spoon aside, leaning closer as one hand anchored lightly on her shoulder and the other brushed the corner of her lips with his thumb. His tone softened. "Take it slowver."

His fingertips, faintly cool, skimmed across her skin like a feather, sending a shiver darting through her.Brinley's whole body went rigid, her breath hitching.

The touch was toosudden, far too intimate, and her pulse lurched wildly.

She stepped back at once, hiding her mouth behind her hand as if shielding herself.s fine,"she muttered, voice muffled and flustered."Don't worry."

Austin's hand lingered in the air, suspended between them. His gaze flicked to the flush coloring her ears,amusement glimmering in his eyes. He said nothing, though his lips curved faintly, choosing silence over teasing.

He pulled his hand back and, with casual ease, gave the soup a slow stir. "It still needs a little longer. Go wash up first."

At his words, Brinley darted into the bathroom, twisting the cold tap open with trembling fingers.

She drew in a long breath, forcing herself to steady her hammering pulse, though her mind remained a snarl of confusion. All that time-if Austin had been hiding some darker intent, she ought to have caught even the faintest hint.

Yet nothing ever slipped. He had been nothing but attentive and meticulous, treating her like a cherished partner-his quiet devotion so intense it almost unsettled her.

Maybe it was time she carved out a moment to sit down with Austin and have an honest conversation.

She didn't have the strength for it now, but once the bidding ordeal was behind her, she promised herself she'd face him head-on.

When Brinley stepped back into the dining room, the table was already laid out.

The dishes weren't lavish, yet each plate bore the mark of patient, deliberate effort.

"Here, taste this." Austin carefully placed a piece of bass on her plate. He had picked away every last bone before sliding it toward her."You've been missing meals again, so I made you something. You deserve a real meal."

Brinley lowered her gaze, spoon moving slowly as she ate in silence. She didn't dare meet his eyes, her voice barely above a whisper when she murmured, "Thanks."

The fish melted on her tongue, tender and flavorful.

"Your cooking's come a long way," she said at last, blurting it out in an effort to cut through the delicate tension between them.
###Chapter 53 Don't Let A Man's Sweet Tricks Reel You In Again


"I learned to cook while studying abroad," Austin remarked, ladling soup into his bowl with the easy air of someone recalling a minor detail. "Later, once work consumed everything, I barely touched a stove. I lost the rhythm of it-the way heat bends to your control. But now that l've picked it up again, it feels almost instinctive."

Brinley glanced up, only to meet the depth of his gaze. His eyes were steady, like still water hiding currents too deep to fathom.

A nervous flutter stole through her chest, and she quickly dropped her eyes, pretending to fuss over her plate, unaware of the streak of sauce clinging to her lips.

When the last bite was gone, she sprang up to gather the dishes. Her movements were brisk, almost clumsy, as though flight into the kitchen were the only way to escape the honeyed tension thickening between them.

Austin caught her wrist just as she reached for the plate.

"I'll take care of the dishes." The cool press of his fingers lingered on her skin, his grip gentle yet insistent."Go sit in the living room, or head upstairs and rest for a while."

Brinley gave a small tug to free herself. "It's fine, I can manage..."

But his hand tightened, firm enough to still her. Their gazes locked, so close that they could see the flutter of each other's lashes.

Her breath eased out in a hush, as if afraid the quiet spell between them might shatter.

"Please, just be a dear and do as I say?" Austin's voice dropped lower, husky and gentle. "The plan's already submitted. You should rest now."

Heat crept up Brinley's face, a sudden tide of warmth and comfort flooding her chest. Almost as if startled by her own reaction, she pulled her hand back and hurried out of the kitchen.

"I'll wait in the living room, then!" she called over her shoulder.

Left behind, Austin leaned against the kitchen doorway, gazedrifting to his fingertips.

The soft warmth of her wrist lngered on his skin, leaving him with a smile he couldn't quite suppress, his eyes glinting with a quiet brightness.

Across the living room, Brinley tucked herself into the corner of the sofa, fingers gripping the edge of a throw pillow until the fabric creased.

Her palm pressed against her chest, trying to steady the frantic rhythm of her heartbeat.

From the kitchen came silence as the water shut off.

Moments later, Austin emerged, a towelin hand, drying his fingers. His gaze swept over her curled figure,and a low chuckle slipped from his lips.

He settled onto the sofa across from her, remote in hand. "What do you feel like watching?"

Brinley only gave a slight shake of her head, lips pressed together.

Moments later, she cleared her throat, forcing a light tone. "Austin, how did you even have time to personally..."

Before she could finish, he cut her off, "Come here."

He patted the empty spot on the sofa, the cushion dipping slightly beneath his hand.

Brinley's grip on the pillow tightened as she shook her head. "I'm fine right here."

"Sit with me." His voice carried quiet insistence, gentle but impossible to refuse.

The living room was bathed in dim light, the TV off, and silence was broken only by the soft rhythm of their breathing.

After a beat of hesitation, Brinley pushed herself up and reluctantly sank down beside him. Though nearly half a meter separated them, the space between seemed charged, as if some unseen current had wrapped around them, warming the air and blurring the distance.

Austin kept silent, idly flipping through a financial magazine, the crisp snap of each page unnervingly loud in the quiet.

Brinley, on the other hand, sat stiffly upright, her back tense, a restless unease knotting in her chest.

Her eyes flicked sideways, catching Austin's calm figure absorbed in his reading, yet a subtle prickle told her he was still aware of her every move.

"I should take care of some work upstairs," she blurted, rising too quickly, seizing the excuse as if it were her only escape.

Austin's gaze lingered on her, a knowing curve tugging at his lips. "Like I said earlier, you needto rest."

"It'll just be a quick check. It won't take long." With that, Brinley bolted up the stairs.

Behind the closed door, she slumped against it, chest rising and falling in sharp bursts until her breath finally steadied.

Downstairs, Austin followed her retreat with his eyes, then set the magazine aside. His fingers tapped lightly against his knee as the amusement in his expression deepened.

At the desk upstairs, Brinley sat motionless before her computer, staring at the black screen that mirrored her faint, shadowed reflection.

The flush on her cheeks lingered, her'mind replaying the heat of his fingertips and the low timbre of his voice.

Her heartbeat skittered wildly once more, and with a frustrated tug at her hair, Brinley grabbed a glass of water and drank deeply.

The icy rush slid down her throat but did nothing to cool the restless flutter in her chest.

"Brinley, get a hold of yourself. Don't let a man's sweet tricks reel you in again," she muttered under her breath. Yet another whisper rose from the back of her mind, softer and tempting. "But what if he's truly sincere?"

The moment that thought surfaced, Brinley shoved it back down.

She rubbed at her temples, trying to chase away the storm in her head, but her gaze betrayed her and slid back to the phone.

On the screen lingered Austin's last message from the morning-his gentle reminder to take care and get some rest.

Her fingertips hovered above the screen, trembling slightly, before she pressed the lock button with a snap.

She refused to let those messy emotions linger. Shaking her head once more, she resolved to put it aside and let herself sink into sleep.
 ###Chapter 54 Plagiarism


The next morning, Milly sank into the sofa in Colin's office, her posture stiff, thumb absently skimming over the glassy surface of her phone.

On the screen, the complaint portal of the bidding conference website glowed like a silent temptation.

Though sunlight poured in through the tall windows in dazzling sheets, an icy shiver threaded down Milly's spine, settling into her bones.

A few minutes earlier, she had caught sight of Brinley's team's newest design update on the project bulletin board. Their intricate designs were so flawless that they gnawed at her insides, stoking a jealousy so fierce it bordered on rage.

Milly thrust the phone into Colin's hands, her voice quivering despite her effort to sound firm."Colin,just look at this proposal... it's practically lifted straight from that foreign racing park. Even the track layout is a carbon copy!"

Colin studied Brinley's designs in silence, his brows knitting slightly as he flipped through the details.The overall concept did echo that foreign project, yet Brinley's draft contained flourishes and innovative touches the other lacked.

"This doesn't strike me as plagiarism." He set the phone aside, his voice even and composed. "Brinley isn't the type to pull something like that."

Milly's tone sharpened, the edge of frustration cutting through as her composure faltered. "She's desperate for a comeback, and this project is her golden ticket. Colin, are you really willing to stand by while she beats us with those stolen designs?"

Colin's brows knit together, but he held his tongue.

No one understood Brinley like he did, and he knew she would never stoop to plagiarism; her pride forbade it. If anything, it was Milly who had been unraveling lately, her actions growing stranger by the day.

"Enough," he said, slicing through the tension with a clipped voice. His hand came down on the table,steady but controlled. "Whether she copied or not has nothing to do with us. What matters is getting ready for the defense two days from now."

He forced himself to turn back to the proposal, though his shoulders remained tight with unease.

Even surrounded by a team of professionals, he couldn't shake the memory of Brinley at the banquet.Her profound speech about the project had unsettled him so deeply that it still held his nerves taut, refusing to let him rest.

Brinley's knowledge of racing was uncanny, her insights rivaling those of the seasoned professionals he paid to advise him.

The sting of his previous miscalculation lingered-he had dismissed her then, and she had snatched the project out from under him. This time, he swore he wouldn't repeat the same fatal error.

Determination burned through him; he would show everyone what he was truly capable of.

"Alright," Milly muttered, her lashes lowering to mask her frustration, though the document in her hands bore the deep creases of her clenched grip.

That very afternoon, Brinley stepped into the conference room, her notes spread neatly before her as she readied herself for the upcoming defense.

Corbin burst into the room, his face drained of color, clutching a letter. "Brinley, bad news! Someone filed an anonymous report claiming our proposal plagiarized a case from Flonga!"

The conference room froze; a heavy silence dropped over the table, and every gaze locked on Brinley.

She accepted the letter without haste, her slender fingers brushing over the stark words-suspected plagiarism of a racing park in Flonga. Her brows drew together, then smoothed as quickly as they had furrowed.

"Is this worth losing composure over?" she murmured, laying the letter flat on the table. Her voice carried a cold steadiness. "A single complaint doesn't define plagiarism."

"They said they'll re-evaluate our proposal. What if..." Corbin's voice cracked, his eyes glassy with the threat of tears. "There are only two days before the bidding conference. What if the review falls apart?"

"There is no 'what if.'" Brinley cut him off, her tone firm as she uncapped a marker and scrawled "Proof of Originality" across the whiteboard. "Gather every detail and highlight the heart of our proposal," she instructed, her pen tapping against the board for emphasis. "That racing park doesn't have these features.That's what sets us apart."

Her gaze swept across the anxious faces in the room before she added with quiet authority, "Our proposal is unique. Pull the materials together-I'll be the one to present them this afternoon."

The steadiness in her voice worked like a balm; the tension in the room eased, and one by one, her teammates bent back over their work with renewed focus.

Corbin leaned back in his chair, watching Brinley sketch crisp lines and precise annotations across the whiteboard. He felt a swell of admiration-a leader who remained unshaken in a crisis was a real gem.

Later that afternoon, Brinley entered the client's company, her demeanor steady and composed.

At the conference room, she was received by Elisha Holden, the secretary-general overseeing the event-a dignified older man with gold-rimmed glasses that caught the light with every movement.

In his hands, he carried Milly's formal complaint letter along with a thick folder of documents tied to the Flonga racing park project.

"Mrs. Moore," Elisha said, sliding the folder across the polished table toward her. "Here are the complaint materials. Please review them." He adjusted his glasses before adding, his tone measured, "The opposing party alleges that both your track layout and the spectator area design bear a striking resemblance to the Flonga project."

Brinley flipped open the document, her brows knitting as she scanned the neatly formatted complaint. The letter dripped with forced professionalism, complete with two supposedly damning plagiarism sketches highlighted for emphasis. Anyone with an ounce of discernment could see the truth-their idea might share a faint resemblance, but the execution lived in an entirely different league.

"Mr.Holden." Brinley set the file back on the table with calm precision, sliding her own stack of materials forward. Her gaze was steady, her tone unwavering. "First of all, Flonga did not invent the track concept. At least five international circuits have incorporated similar layouts. Second, my proposal introduces three distinctive features that Flonga's design does not even touch."

Every syllable landed with crisp authority. Supported by her intricate schematics and data, her case stood ironclad, leaving no space for argument.

Elisha's head bobbed faster and faster as he listened, until at last he couldn't restrain himself. HHis voice burst with admiration. "This isn't plagiarism at all. You've elevated the work-you've outshone the original!Brilliant!"

Brinley gathered the documents into a neat stack and shut them with quiet finality. Her tone remained steady,almost detached. "Thank you for acknowledging that, Mr. Holden. I trust you'll prepare a clarification letter soon, so the review process isn't disrupted."

"Of course!" Elisha answered without hesitation, leaning forward with earnest urgency. "WVe'll release a statement on the official site and set your reputation straight."
###Chapter 55 I'll Stand Behind You


The last streaks of sunset stained the horizon in shades of gold and rose as Brinley slipped away from the building.

Pulling out her phone, she typed a crisp order to Corbin. "Have the tech team prepare the patent certificate for the new material and get it posted on the company site."

His answer came in seconds, punctuated with a playful cheer emoji."On it!"

Though she already suspected who had stirred up trouble, Brinley chose not to stew over it.

Milly's petty maneuvers weren't worth a battle now, not when the stakes were higher.

In Brinley's mind, schemes and shortcuts could never outlast real ability.

With the matter settled, she headed back to Hillcrest Villa, arriving just as the clock struck six, the twilight air still warm against he skin.

Austin lounged in the living room, waiting for her return, the aroma of dinner already drifting from the neatly arranged table.

"Rough day?" he asked in an even voice as he rose to take her bag from her shoulder.

Brinley shook her head, easing into her chair and tasting the soup. The delicate sweetness washed over her tongue,comforting enough to melt away the day's weariness. "Nothing serious-it's all handled now."

He didn't press. Instead, he reached for the tablet she had set aside, his gaze scanning the clarification statement posted on the website.

When the design sketches caught his eye, a flicker of admiration softened his expression. "This concept is brilliant."

Her face brightened instantly.""You think so? I worried it might be too bold for the judges.""True design never shies from boldness." He set the tablet down and met her gaze with quiet certainty."You've had a long day. Get some rest after you finish your soup."

"Alright." Brinley drained the last of her soup, set the spoon aside, and quietly made her way upstairs.

Austin lingered át the table, his gaze following her until she vanished down the hall. A faint smile softened his features, warmth flickeing in his eyes.

"Goodnight," he murmured after her.

She faltered on the steps, hesitated for a heartbeat, yet chose silence instead of answering.

On the eve of the big presenation, rain drifted lightly over Bleron, misting the streets in a silver haze.

Brinley's study glowed softly under the solitary lamp, shadows stretching across shelves lined with books.Rain pattered steadily against the vast panes of glass, a quiet counterpoint to her hushed rehearsal for tomorrow's presentation.

The third cup of coffee sat abandoned on the desk.

As her fingers reached absentmindedly for it, they brushed against unexpected warmth-a bowl that hadn't been there before. She flinched slightly, startled.

"Too much iced coffee will ruin your stomach." Austin's low murmur came from above.

Lifting her gaze, she found him standing there in cream-colored loungewear, an empty tray balanced in his hand,the porridge still steaming faintly beside her.

"Why are you still awake?" she asked softly, her eyes lingering on the shadows beneath his lashes,a faint ache tugging at her chest.

Lately, Austin had made a point of returning home earlier, yet his nights stretched long in the study, pages and screens keeping him company until dawn.

"I was waiting for you," he murmured, dragging a chair closer before settling beside her. His gaze swept over her pale face. "You must be worn out." "I'm fine." Brinley gave a weak shake of her head, unable to hold it upright for long. "I keep thinking, what if..."

"There's no 'what if'" Austin cut in, his voice steady, his eyes unwavering. "The plan you've drawn up is already more than enough."

"You didn't even make it to the last page."

"I don't need to," he replied in a low, steady tone. "The way you spent night after night fine-tuning every parameter told me enough-you were destined to win."

Brinley's head snapped up and her heart warmed at his words.

By then, the rain outside had slipped away unnoticed, leaving the moon to break through a ragged veil of clouds. Its pale glow spilled across the design sheet in Austin's hands.

"This concept is daring," he murmured, brushing a fingertip over the sketched lines. "But it has something magnetic about it."

"Magnetic?" Brinley arched a brow, a trace of challenge in her voice. "What if they say it isn't professional?"

"Professionalism isn't about clinging to rigid rules," Austin said, lifting his eyes to hers, his voice steady but warm. His gaze carried a depth that softened the edges of his words. "Real mastery lies in blending contradictions until they feel like harmony."

Brinley's chest tightened as she met the sincerity in his eyes, and something long knotted inside her seemed to loosen at last.

She dropped her gaze to her lap, fingers twisting together, and whispered,"Austin... what if I don't win this project?"

The moment the words slipped out, regret stabbed through her.

She never exposed her fears, never cracked her armor-but tonight, with Austin watching her so intently,the anxieties she had buried for days refused to stay hidden.

This project wasn't just another stepping stone; it was the culmination of endless hours and relentless determination. She had poured herself into every detail. The thought of falling short-of all her sacrifices ending in disappointment-was unbearable.

Austin sat in silence, letting the air stretch before he spoke.

He reached for the glass on the table and held it out to her with steady hands."Here.Drink this first."

Brinley accepted it, her fingertips brushing against the warm surface, and a faint calm seeped through her restless chest.

"You don't need to force it." His voice was low yet firm, threaded with quiet authority. "If this project slips by,wait for the next one. Your ability will eventually shine."

His gaze lingered on her tired face, exhaustion from too many sleepless nights evident in her features. With a gentler edge, he continued, "But Brinley... to me, your health matters more than any deal. Losing one project isn't the end of the world. I'llstand behind you."

Those words flowed from his lips with such effortless ease, as if they were the most natural truth in the world.

Yet, they made Brinley's heart stumble in her chest.

The warm water slid down her throat, coating it with a faint comfort.

She tilted her head toward the moon outside the window, her voice rough as she muttered, "I never asked you to support me."

Austin gave a low laugh, eyes glinting. "I know you didn't. I just want to."

Brinley pressed her cheek against the cool surface of the table, retreating into silence.

Only after a long pause did she lift her head again, eyes rimmed red yet curved with a small smile."Thank you."
###Chapter 56 She Grasped The Spirit Of Racing Itself


Closing the scattered drafts, Austin rose from his chair and gestured toward the hallway. "Come on, time to call it a night. You've got a speech in the morning, and if you stay up, you'll be dragging those dark circles around with you."

"I be fine." Brinley rose with a languid stretch, arms lifting above her head, her spine arching in an almost graceful display. "A face mask will fix everything. I'll look flawless by morning."

Austin studied her, his mouth curving in a faintly amused smile as though he wanted to tease her but held back.

Without thinking, his hand lifted. He tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, his fingertip brushing the delicate curve of her lobe. The brief contact froze them both in place.

Color rushed across Brinley's cheeks. She stepped back abruptly, her voice a touch too brisk. "I'm going to my room."

Austin let his hand fall away, his voice dropping to a gentle murmur."Alright.Goodnight."

"Goodnight," Brinley echoed, hurrying toward the door as though fleeing a shadow pressing too close.

After switching off the study lamp, Austin stepped into the hall, his stride unhurried.

The soft glow of the nightlight traced the angles of his tall frame as he made his way down the hallway.

When he neared Brinley's door, he slowed, pausing in the hush of the hallway.

Only after her light clicked off, assuring him she had gone to bed, did his shoulders ease. With that small reassurance, he finally turned toward his own room.

Austin lay awake, staring at the shadows on his ceiling, sleep nowhere in sight.

Brinley's effort to mask her nerves replayed in his mind like a stubborn film reel. Reaching for his phone, he typed a quick message to Miguel. "Arrange top-tier security for tomorrow's venue, and have a fresh bouquet of sunflowers ready."

Miguel's confirmation came almost instantly. "Understood."

Setting the phone aside, Austin let his gaze drift upward, the faintest smile tugging at his lips.

The next day, the atmosphere at the venue was suffocating with tension.

Brinley stood offstage, her posture rigid as Colin presented his proposal. Her face betrayed nothing, a blank mask against the charged air.

Colin appeared in a tailored charcoal suit, his tie knotted with meticulous precision.

The softness that once lingered in his eyes had vanished, replaced by a blade-like sharpness, every word he delivered carrying a crisp, commanding edge.

As he outlined his vision for the mall'sfuture, the judges leaned forward, nodding in steady rhythm to his argument.

"Our concept integrates racing with gaming, a dual theme designed to draw in massive crowds." Colin's gaze swept deliberately across the panel before locking on Brinley, a glint of unwavering resolve in his eyes."Business thrives on profit, not on sentiment."

The remark struck Brinley like a sudden knife to the chest. She instantly understood the hidden target of his words.

Her proposal still carried the raw, unpolished passion she had always held for racing.

"Brinley, it's our turn," Corbin urged, his voice taut with nerves, the papers in his grip wrinkling under the pressure of his restless fingers.

Brinley steadied herself with a long breath, her heels striking the floor in crisp, measured beats that cut through the silence of the hall.

At the podium, she planted her feet firmly, lifting her chin to meet Colin's eyes as he lowered himself back into his seat. His gaze didn't burn with mockery this time-it was sharp, unyielding, a wordless vow that seemed to say,"This round, you won't defeat me."

Meanwhile, Austin sat quietly behind the row of judges, his long fingers tapping a steady rhythm against his knee.

From where he watched, he caught the flicker of unease in Brinley's eyes, the subtle tightening of her fists as she tried to mask her nerves.

"Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Brinley Moore, representing VantagePath Realty."

She didn't dive straight into her proposal. Instead, the lights dimmed as a video began to play.

Sheets of rain pounded a racetrack while a scarlet race car skidded out on a slick curve. Just as it seemed destined to smash into the barrier, the car slammed into a cushioned buffer zone and bounced back intact.The racer climbed out, shaken but unharmed.

"The foundation of my design is speed built on safety," Brinley declared, her voice carrying crisply through the mic. "Standard safety zones measure eight meters. I've expanded mine to ten, and the crash-absorbing material surpasses international strength requirements."

The video shifted to racetrack schematics. Brinley lifted her hand, gesturing toward the screen. "This particular curve was tested seven times before we finalized its incline at precisely 14.5 degrees. This setup gave professional racers the rush of raw speed while still allowing casual players to enjoy the track without fear."

From the panel of judges, Grayson leaned forward, admiration gleaming in his eyes.touch steeper and the track is treacherous; a touch flatter and the thrill vanishes."

"Right." Brinley's voice carried a subtle note of pride."Our team spent three months at the test grounds,trying out a dozen different surface materials before locking in the one that gripped perfectly at this incline."

For the next forty minutes, she laid open the blueprint like a jeweler displaying a rare gem.

From the concealed drainage grids beneath the track to the custom-built seating designed for spectators,she presented every element with steady confidence and precision. Down in the audience, Colin sat rigid, his nails biting into his palms.

He had to concede that Brinley's presentation carried real weight. Her vision stretched beyond blueprints and concrete; she grasped the spirit of racing itself.

Had she cultivated this insight recently through relentless study, or had it been a hidden strength quietly waiting for the right moment to surface?

When the floor opened for judges' questions, the tension in the room rose immediately.

"Mrs. Moore, your proposal is solid and professional, but the budget is fifteen percent higher than Palmer Group's. For a government project, cost control is critical." One judge pressed, his tone sharp.

Before Brinley could get a word in, Colin lifted his hand with deliberate calm. "Paying fifteen percent more just to gain a twenty percent bump in safety isn't worth it. My plan meets eighty percent of the safety standard and still keeps spending under control." He let the silence stretch a beat, his gaze locking on Brinley, then added coolly,hasing perfection can turn into a liability when it strays too far from practicality."
###Chapter 57 Love Only Survives On Sincerity And Honesty


Brinley lifted her gaze and met Colin's eyes, her tone steady but edged with resolve. "Mr. Palmer, a racing project can't be judged by budget alone. Every fraction of added safety could mean the difference between life and death in a crisis."

With a few clicks, she displayed a chart on the screen and went on, "Here are last year's global racetrack accident statistics. Nearly eighty percent of severe crashes happened in that twenty percent safety gap."

Grayson leaned forward at once, his voice firm. "Mrs. Moore makes an excellent point. Safety is the line that can never be crossed in racing."

What followed turned into a sharp exchange between Brinley and Colin.

He dismissed her operational model as overly idealistic, and she countered with precise customer-flow predictions.

She exposed the hidden flaws in his drainage design, while he fired back with supplemental test data to defend it.

Austin positioned himself in the rear seats, quietly observing the sharp clash unfolding on stage. His hand tightened around his cup, and a shadow of displeasure lingered across his face.

He caught the way Brinley's fingers tapped against the table whenever she gathered her thoughts, a small unconscious rhythm that betrayed her nerves.

Colin, meanwhile, couldn't help but flick his gaze toward her before every rebuttal, his eyes carrying emotions too tangled to decipher.

When the judges moved into the final voting stage, the hall grew so still that the scratch of pens against paper cut through the silence.

One by one, the seven judges recorded their scores. By the time the staff began tallying them, cold sweat had already traced down Brinley's back. Colin leaned slightly toward her, his voice low enough for only her to hear. "I'm confident this project is mine."

Brinley's eyes stayed fixed on the sunlight streaming through the window. "Shut up."

The host broke the seal on the last envelope, and the room burst into gasps of surprise.

Brinley's total came to 92.5-narrowly beating Colin's 92. It came down to half a point, the thinnest margin possible.

"According to the scoring rules, safety weighed heavier than cost control. By the slimmest of margins,VantagePath Realty takes the win!" the host declared.

The hall burst into thunderous applause, the sound crashing over Brinley like a wave. For a heartbeat she stood frozen, unable to process it.

Corbin wrapped her in a jubilant hug, bouncing with unrestrained joy.

Brinley, however, felt as if her strength had drained away, her gaze drifting instinctively toward the judges'table.

Across the sea of people, Austin's eyes found hers. He smiled warmly, his expression carrying a tenderness that seemed to spill beyond words.

When she stepped down from the stage, Colin waited at the bottom of the stairs.

His suit was creased, his tie askew, and the polish he always carried had completely unraveled.

"Half a point," he muttered, tugging at the corner of his lips as though forcing a smile.

"Mr. Palmer," Brinley said softly, her eyes cool as they met his. "Your proposal was indeed meticulous.Unfortunately..."

"Unfortunately, I don't really understand racing." His voice broke in, the dim light in his eyes betraying a quiet defeat. "I thought commercial benefits were what mattered, but I forgot-the heart of this project is the track itself. Now I understand why we broke úp. When I thought stability was enough, I lost sight of what truly matters-that from the very start, love only survives on sincerity and honesty." The words struck Brinley like a sudden blow, and her expression frosted over.

Colin continued, "Brinley, we...

"Enough," she cut him off, her tone sharp and distant.

Colin parted his lips, ready to argue, but his gaze flicked past her shoulder. Seeing the figure behind her, he forced a thin, bitter smile instead. "Goodbye,Brinley."

He turned and walked toward the exit, every step weighted, his back bent as though the years had suddenly caught up with him.

"What's got you so lost in thought?" Austin's voice rose gently from behind.

Brinley pivoted to find him standing there, a bouquet of bright sunflowers cradled in his hands.

"It's nothing," she replied softly. Her fingers brushed his as she accepted the bouquet, and a wave of warmth passed between them. Somehow, the hollow inside her chest felt full. "Thank you."

"What exactly are you thanking me for?" he asked, brushing a loose strand of hair from her shoulder.

"For the flowers."

Austin dipped his head, studying her animated face before letting out a low chuckle. "That's all I get? Just words?"

Cradling the bouquet, Brinley's gaze grew complicated, shadows flickering behind her eyes. "As thanks,plan to buy you dinner tomorrow. Do you have time?"

"Of couurse, I'll make time for you." His laugh came easy, his eyes bright with amusement.

Brinley, however, looked away deliberately, refusing to meet the depth in his expression. "Pick a time and send it over. There's still a site survey I have to handle, so you go back without me."

Raising an eyebrow, he offered, "I'll drive you."

"There's no need. I need to bring Corbin and the others. I'm heading out now." Without waiting for a reply, Brinley motioned for her teammates and strode off, her steps brisker than she realized.

The bouquet remained clutched tightly against her chest, her mind circling back to the dinner invitation for tomorrow. She felt the urge to sidestep it entirely.

With the project finally wrapped up, it was the right moment to sit down for a serious conversation with Austin.

Yet the thought of sitting across from him, laying it all bare, stirred a reluctance she didn't want to acknowledge.

Austin's gaze followed Brinley until her figure was gone, the corners of his lips tightening into a faint, bitter grin.

"Mr. Moore, should we..." Miguel, hovering at his side, finally broke the silence. He had been waiting,restless, watching Austin stand rooted in place long after Brinley disappeared.

Finally, his eyes shifted aside, his expression settling once more into that rigid severity."We're going back to the company."

Meanwhile, once outside the hall, Brinley waved off her team with a bright smile, tellingthem to unwind and enjoy the victory.

It was the dedication of the entire team that allowed them to secure this project.

"Brinley, aren't you joining us for a meal?" Corbin asked.

"I'll pass. There's something else I need to take care of." With that, she offered them a gentle farewell before turning away, her steps carrying her alone toward the project site in the quiet stretch of the suburbs.
###Chapter 58 Ambush


The evening breeze whispered across the barren site, carrying with it fine grains of sand that crackled softly against the steel framework.

Brinley stood at the highest rise of the project site, a laser distance meter balanced firmly in her hand.

The sinking sun stretched her shadow long across the dirt, mirroring the weight of her tangled thoughts.

Instead of joining the team in their well-earned celebration, she had chosen solitude, burying herself in numbers and measurements.

Work had always been her refuge when her mind felt like a storm she couldn't quiet.

Even now, she couldn't explain why she was so frustrated.

Her fingers tapped swiftly across her tablet as she uploaded the last set of data, the bluish glow casting a sharp light on her concentrated face.

Once she snapped the case of her equipment shut, movement in the distance caught her eye. Two figures lingered at the edge of a dirt road, their posture hesitant and suspicious.

This place was desolate-construction crews had long since left for the day. At this hour, no one had any reason to be here. And yet, they were.

Brinley's brows furrowed, her breath catching. Something wasn't right.

Off to the side sat a black car, parked like a predator lying in wait. No license plate, windows dark as ink-it stood out starkly in the empty wasteland.

Were they just passersby?

She eased the tablet into her backpack, her fingertips grazing the reassuring weight.of her car keys in her pocket. The rugged terrain had been the reason she'd driven a SUV out here in the first place.

Turning toward her white SUV, she slowed her stride deliberately, her eyes catching the reflection of the black car in the glossy side panels.

Her hand gripped the door handle-right then, the other vehicle's engine growled to life, low and menacing.The headlights stayed dead, yet the car shifted, its nose angling straight at her.

Brinley's chest tightened-these men weren't passersby; they were hunting her.

She yanked open the car door and slipped inside, her hands moving with desperate speed.

The engine roared to life, and before her seatbelt even clicked, she had shoved the gear into drive and slammed her foot down.

The vehicle leapt forward, tires spitting yellow sand in a furious spray.

Through the rearview mirror, a dark shape surged after her. The black car swung in hard, closing the distance fast, its headlights still off but its intent unmistakable. They wanted to cut her off.

"Damn it!" she muttered under her breath, knuckles whitening around the steering wheel.

This stretch of land offered no safe options-only one paved road out to the main highway,while the rest were narrow, broken industrial lanes that twisted into dead ends.

If something went wrong here, there'd be zero chance of reaching anyone.

Brinley veered away from the straight cement road.

When the road split, she jerked the wheel, tires shrieking as the car skidded hard onto the gravel path to the right.

In the mirror, the black car swung after her without a flicker of hesitation.

The engine's thunder reverberated between the narrow warehouse walls, chasing her with relentless intent.

Her eyes narrowed, a glint sparking in the gloom. Fine-she'd show them how the game was played.

The calm, accommodating woman vanished, and in her place emerged Rosara-the fearless racer who once owned every track she touched.

A prickling rush coursed along her spine as her hands gripped the wheel with lethal precision,each motion sharp as a blade's edge.

The vehicle slashed through the maze of deserted warehouses, her path weaving with fluid, practiced control.

Even though Brinley had stepped away from racing years ago, the instincts never dulled.

She hurled the SUV through two sharp ninety-degree turns, barely easing off the gas. The chassis leaned hard, brushing past crumbling walls as the tires shrieked across the surface.

Within the mirror's frame, she noticed the black sedan lost the corner, fishtailing until it nearly slammed the concrete.

For a moment it lagged behind, but the driver steadied the wheel and pressed on, closing the gap again.

"Relentless, aren't you?" Brinley muttered with a tight sneer, eyes flicking ahead.

The road ended at a T-junction: left toward a dead end, right into a skinny lane.

At the far side of that path, a heavy iron gate emerged from the weeds, its frame nearly swallowed by the wild growth.

She remembered spotting it that the other day during her survey-the hinges slack, the gate left slightly open, concealing the stretch of abandoned warehouses beyond.

Drawing in a steadying breath, Brinley shot toward the junction, slammed the brakes, and yanked the handbrake, the wheel spinning under her grip.

Tires screamed across the pavement as the car slid in a flawless arc, its frame cutting across most of the lane, forcing the black car behind to slam on its brakes.Using that brief hesitation, she dropped the handbrake and twisted the wheel shaply, sending the vehicle lunging into the narrow right lane like a released arrow.

By the time the pursuers adjusted, her SUV had gained nearly a hundred meters of distance.

She barreled through the loosened gate, which groaned faintly on its rusted hinges, and the view burst open to a sprawling field of warehouses.

The ground was jagged, littered with rusted beams and corroded steel plates that gleamed dully under the fading light.

She guided the SUV through the chaos with unflinching precision-accelerating hard one moment,tapping the brakes lightly the next.

Each evasive swerve threaded her vehicle through danger with a racer's intuition.

The black sedan burst through the gate seconds later, the engine bellowing with fury,its hunt undeterred.

Determination flickered in Brinley's eyes, steady andunyielding.

She twisted the wheel again, hurling the SUV toward a ninety-degree corner at the farthest edge of the warehouse sprawl.

Rows of rusted containers flanked the outer curve, leaving just a sliver of space wide enough for a single vehicle to squeeze through.

The maneuver was dangerous, but it was the only opening she had.

Caught off guard by Brinley's reckless gamble, the black car faltered for a breath, swerving toward the broader inner road instead.

Her chance had come!

As the bend loomed, Brinley slammed her foot on the accelerator instead of easing off.
###Chapter 59 Does It Sting


A deafening roar burst from the engine, gravel exploding away from the spinning tires.

Before the vehicle could crumple against the container wall, Brinley jerked the wheel and feathered the brakes, steadying the vehicle in a hair-raising swerve.

It skimmed past with barely a sliver of space to spare, the side mirror clearing the steel by less than a fingertip's width.

In her rearview, she caught sight of the black sedan struggling with the turn, forced to loop wide around a stack of containers, losing at least fifty meters in the process.

She refused to ease up, shooting through the far end of the warehouse complex and aiming straight for the narrow road that linked back to the highway.

When her tires finally hit the smooth stretch of asphalt, Brinley exhaled in relief, realizing her palms were slick with sweat and her heartbeat pounded against her ribs.

A quick glance in the mirror confirmed the sedan had broken off-the driver knew chasing her into public traffic was pointless.

Easing off the gas, she tried to regulate her breath, though her thoughts still reeled from the pursuit.

Who the hell were they? Why had they been on her tail?

Was it tied to the project... or something far more dangerous?

A sudden flicker in her line of sight made her look twice, revealing a car idling at the roadside.

It was a sleek black Maybach, the license plate number etched into her memory.

The tinted window slid down, revealing Austin's sharp profile.

His gaze wasn't on her but on the road behind, his expression taut with shock and unguarded worry. For a split second, Brinley's heart faltered mid-beat.

What on earth was he doing here?

Her instincts overrode hesitation-she braked hard and pulled up alongside him.

Pulling the window down, she let the evening breeze wash over her flushed skin, steadying her nerves.

"What are you doing here?" she inquired, her voice unsteady, the adrenaline from the chase still humming in her veins.

Austin stayed silent at first, his gaze traveling from her ashen face to her knuckles clenched white around the steering wheel, then lingering on the mud-caked tires and scraped rims of her SUV. His expression remained unreadable.

After what felt like forever, he finally spoke, his voice low and rough. "I called you. You didn't answer. I got worried and came looking for you."

He cut himself short, eyes narrowing toward the stretch of road that disappeared into the abandoned warehouse complex, his tone edged with restrained tension. "What in the world just happened out there?"

The realization struck Brinley hard-he hadn't coincidentally shown up; he'd come for her.

And the chase that had left her heart hammering...How much of it had he witnessed?

Meeting his dark, searching eyes, her throat tightened.

The night breeze swept across the roadside, scattering brittle leaves across the pavement.

The bitter odor of burnt rubber still hung in the air between their two vehicles, thick and suffocating in the silence.

Brinley parted her lips, but no words came out.

Austin only studied her in silence, his gaze steady yet turbulent, as if fighting to contain what he felt:

He had come to take her home-only to make sure she wasn't stranded in such an isolated place-yet he had stumbled upon a side of her he'd never seen. The woman who used to blush and spar with him had, behind the wheel, become someone altogether different: composed, razor-sharp, radiating an iron-willed resolve.

Every drift and surge of speed had beenflawless, executed with the elegance of a champion racer.

What other secrets was she still keeping from him?

He didn't voice the question. Instead, Ausin closed his hand around her wrist, his touch firm but not harsh,and guided her toward the passenger seat.

"Come on," he murmured, his tone leaving no room for refusal. "Let me drive you back."

Brinley sank into the passenger seat of Austin's car without protest.

It took nearly three minutes before the tremor in her chest eased, her breath still uneven from the chase.

She hadn't been behind the wheel like that in years, and the sudden eruption of danger had rattled her more than she wanted to admit.

Her mind spun with questions she couldn't answer-what the pursuers wanted and what might have happened if they'd managed to box her in. The thought alone made her palms clammy.

The cool blast of the air conditioning grazed her damp forehead, sending a faint shiver down her spine.

"Cold?" Austin asked. Without waiting for her reply, he adjusted the temperature with calm efficiency.

The drive passed in heavy quiet until the car rolled to a smooth stop before Hillcrest Villa.

Austin at last broke the silence, his deep voice steady and certain. "Someone's tailing you."

"That's right," Brinley admitted it with a small nod, her tone deliberately light. "Fortunately, I pulled it off and shook that car behind me."

"Fortunately?" Austin's brows drew together as he closed his hand around her wrist once more. "Come on,get out first. We'll continue this inside."

The heat of his palm and the unyielding strength of his grip left her powerless to resist. Brinley nearly lost her balance as he guided her into the villa.

Warm amber light glowed across the polished floorboards, pushing back the night outside, though it did little to ease the unease churning in her chest.

While she bent to change her shoes, Austin disappeared briefly, returning with a first aid kit in hand.

"Come here." His voice remained calm, yet beneath that steadiness was an unmistakable command that demanded obedience.

She faltered for a second before softly insisting, "I'm fine, really. I didn't get hurt."

"Come here," Austin said again, already holding iodine and cotton swabs in his hand.

Backed into a corner, Brinley lowered herself onto the sofa.

He gently took her arm, turning it under the light to inspect her elbow and wrist before motioning for her to push her pant leg higher so he could check her knees.

His touch carried a careful tenderness, every movement deliberate, so unlike the calm, controlled composure he usually wore.

"I told you, I'm fine," Brinley murmnured, trying to tug her hand back. "Just a little rattled,that's all."

Austin didn't answer. His gaze shifted to her palm, where a deep red welt stood out from how hard she'd gripped the steering wheel.

He dipped a cotton swab in iodine, brushed it lightly against the mark, and finally spoke."Does it sting?"
###Chapter 60 You Handle A Car Impressively


"It's fine, doesn't hurt a bit," Brinley murmured.

The tenderness in Austin's touch unsettled her, leaving her strangely restless.

He bent his head lower, treating the shallow red mark on her hand.

A slant of lamplight traced shadows along his dark lashes, softening the severity of his profile.

Only the distant chirping of crickets through the open window broke the silence in the living room.

Brinley studied the lines of his face, her chest tightening with emotions too tangled to name.

His concern for her had always expressed itself this way-not with words, but with quiet, steadfast action.

Austin packed away the first-aid kit and returned to the sofa, offering her a steaming cup of water."Drink this."

Brinley accepted it, the warmth sliding down her dry throat like comfort itself.

When she glanced up, his eyes were already fixed on her, steady and penetrating, as though he could read every secret she carried.

"You handle a car impressively," he said suddenly.

Her fingers twitched, and the cup nearly slipped from her grasp.

Determined to appear calm, she placed the cup back on the table and avoided his gaze. "It's nothing. I trained for a while, so I can manage when things get tricky."

"Is that so?" His tone remained calm, almost flat, "Even seasoned racers might not have pulled off a drift like the one you did."

Brinley's mind detonated at his words, leaving her stunned. He really had seen it-her reckless, nearly unhinged drift through the deserted warehouse district.

Her pulse thundered in her ears, sweat dampening her palms as panic pressed in.

What excuse could she possibly offer?

Could she brush it off as nothing more than sheer luck?

"Just a coincidence," Brinley muttered, her throat tightening as she kept her eyes lowered. "I dabbled in it a long time ago. When the moment came, my hands just...reacted."

Not a word came from Austin; only his calm, unrelenting stare bore into her.

That quiet scrutiny felt like an invisible net, leaving her trapped without a way out.

The longer he studied her, the more flustered she became, and even she knew how flimsy her excuse sounded.

"Why were you even there?" Brinley finally blurted, forcing herself to look up, desperate to shift the subject.

Austin ignored her question, his voice cool and direct. "Who do you think is pulling the strings behind those tailing you?"

Brinley froze, her mind flashing back to the black car and the masked figures inside. She gave a small shake of her head. "I'm not sure. Could be competitors trying to dig into project details. Or maybe..." She hesitated, then forced the words out. "Maybe they're after you."

Given Austin's tangled family ties, filled-with constant rivalries and hidden wars, the thought didn't seem far-fetched.

Austin's jaw tightened as he reached for his phone."Miguel will handle the investigation. Until then, don't step out alone. I'll assign bodyguards to stay with you."

"I don't need that. I..." Brinley's refusal camne instinctively, the idea of being shadowed by his peopl.e making her frown.

"You do," Austin cut her off, his voice firm and final, making it clear there was no room to argue."Unless you'd rather have me personally drive you to and from work every single day."

His eyes carried a gravity that allowed no refusal, a firm edge that left no space for argument.

Brinley studied the taut lines of his face, realizing he meant every word.

His concern for her safety wasn't just spoken-it weighed on him.

The warmth that rose in her chest came laced with a faint sting of helplessness.

She parted her lips to speak but, in the end, only gave a small nod.

Pleased with her compliance, Austin tucked the first-aid kit back into place and straightened to his full height. "It's late. Go shower and get some rest."

"Mm," Brinley answered softly, almost under her breath. She rose from the sofa and quietly made her way toward the staircase.

Inside her bedroom, she closed the door and leaned back against it, one hand pressed over her thundering heart.

She couldn't tell how much Austin had actually witnessed, but she wasn't ready for him to know too much about her.

The truth was, she knew almost nothing about him, much less why he cared for her with such intensity.

In the past, she hadn't bothered to question it, never curious enough to pry. Now, though, she realized the time had come for a candid conversation.

Hot water streamed over her in the shower, easingthe tension wound tight in her chest.

When she emerged, steam trailing after her, she noticed a glass of warm milk waiting on her nightstand with a folded note beside it.

The handwriting was unmistakably Austin's. "Drink the milk before bed-it'll help you sleep."

Brinley hesitated before lifting the glass, sipping the milk in slow, careful swallows. The warmth slid down her throat and settled in her stomach, easing her tension bit by bit. Later, stretched across the bed, she stared at the silvered moonlight streaming through the window, finding herself restless in a way she hadn't been before.

In the study, Austin lingered at the window, eyes fixed on the glow of her room until it finally went dark. Only then did he pull out his phone, his voice low and clipped as he instructed, "Miguel, look into Brinley's past."

···

By noon the next day, their lunch appointment had arrived.

Brinley lingered at home far too long, forcing herself into a brisk walk so she wouldn't be late. She managed to sip through the restaurant's doors at the very last minute.

It was a long-standing eatery in Bleron, a place Austin was rumored to visit every so often.

Brinley had reserved a private room ahead of time.

When she pushed open the wooden door, she found Austin already waiting inside.

He worea light gray shirt with the sleeves casually rolled up, showing the smooth lines of his wrists.

His whole demeanor seemed far more at ease than usual.

He lifted his eyes to her, his gaze lingering on her face for several seconds.

###Chapter 61 I'm In Love With You


Brinley chose a beige dress that softened her usual businesslike image, one of the rare pieces in her wardrobe that wasn't designed for meetings.

"I just wrapped up some work and came straight here. Did I keep you waiting?" she asked in a gentle tone as she slid into the chair, her fingers lightly playing with the hem of her dress.

Austin shook his head and poured water into her glass. "Not at all. I only got here a moment ago. How's the project going?"

"It's been going smoothly-the government seems very pleased," Brinley said after taking a sip. A faint smile touched her lips. "Honestly, if it weren't for your help, we might not have won the bid."

She dropped the praise deliberately, using it as a natural bridge toward what she truly wanted to discuss.

Loose ends still weighed on her mind, matters that needed to be sorted out.

Austin had been going out of his way for her lately.

His constant, considerate gestures left her more unsettled than grateful.

Before Brinley even arrived, Austin had already ordered-a full spread of her favorite dishes.

Each plate looked like a tiy masterpiece set out neatly before her.

Brinley lifted her knife and fork, selecting a crab, but her appetite was gone.

Austin caught her distant gaze and gently placed a peeled shrimp onto her plate. "Why aren't you eating?Try the shrimp here."

Brinley managed a small nod. "Alrght." She lifted the shrimp to her lips, but though its sweetness touched her tongue, the taste never reached her.

The private room sank into a heavy stillness, broken only by the faint drone of cicadas outside and the muffled tread of the waiter bringing more dishes.

The silence pressed down on her until she exhaled sharply. "Austin." She laid down her knife and fork, lacing her fingers together on the table, her face solemn. "I need to thank you for your help in securing the project."

Austin lifted his eyes to her, his gaze warm yet steady. "You are my wife. Whatever concerns you naturally concerns me."

Brinley gave a small shake of her head, her tone firm but earnest. "That's not what I mean. WVe both know this is an arranged marriage, so you don't need to be so kind to me. Still, you look after my daily life and offer assistance whenever I find myself in trouble." Her eyes shone with a clear, almost stubborn intensity as she leaned toward him. "Why are you treating me this well?"

The question had haunted her far too long. For a man who had never been interested in women, Austin had carved out an exception-for her alone.

His hand stilled against the porcelain cup, and the shift in his expression was impossible to read.

He paused before answering, "So in your eyes, all this kindness must come with strings attached?"

Brinley gave a forthright nod. "Of course. In our world, favors don't come free. We began with a deal, not romance. If there's a reason behind what you're doing, just lay it out. After everything you've done for me,I'm willing to grant your wish if I can. But I need to be clear..."

Her words cut short when his fingertip flicked gently against her forehead.

It wasn't painful, but it carried the unmistakable feel of quiet reproach.

Brinley's head jerked up, colliding with Austin's gaze, the corners of his mouth curved with quiet amusement.


At some point, he had leaned closer, close enough that she caught the crisp scent of his cologne laced with a faint, unfamiliar sweetness.

"Brinley." His voice was low, carrying a touch of frustration. "What goes on in that mind of yours?" "L..."' Her pulse stumbled under the weight of his stare. Instinct pushed her to lean back, putting distance between them. "I just don't want to end up indebted to anyone."

"And if I told you I have no hidden agenda?" Austin eased into his seat again, lifting his glass with deliberate calm. He took a slow sip, but his eyes remained fixed on her. "What if the reason I treat you well is simply because I choose to?"

"No way!" Brinley shot back without hesitation, her protest sharp, though her voice carried less conviction.

Austin's tone dropped, threaded with a warmth that was impossible to mistake. "This isn't about gain. Every kindness l've shown you is free of calculation." He held her gaze, steady and unyielding, and spoke with deliberate clarity. "Brinley... I'm in love with you."

Her mind erupted in static, the world around her buzzing until she could barely hear her own breath.

Heat rushed across her skin, painting her cheeks and climbing to the tips of her ears until even her earlobes burned.

When she tried to form words, her throat betrayed her. She only sat there, stunned, her wide eyes locked on Austin in wvordless disbelief.

What the hell? Had he really just said he loved her?

Those words knocked the breath from her chest, leaving her stunned in place.

"You... you can't be serious," Brinley stammered, panic flickering beneath her voice. "Do you even know what you're saying?"

"I mean every word." Austin's steady gaze never wavered. "What I feel for you isn't a passing fancy-it's real."

He hesitated, searching her face, his words softening even more. "I know this must feel abrupt. You don't need to say anything right now. All I want is for you to believe me-what I feel is real."

The silence stretched between them, weighted with an undercurrent that made Brinley's chest tighten.

She dropped her gaze to the table, fingertips drifting over the embroidered patterns in the cloth, her pulse hammering faster with every passing second.

What choice did she have? Reject him outright? Or...

As Brinley turned the thought over in her mind, flashes of the past weeks surfaced. Without realizingit,she had grown used to Austin's steady presence, to the way his care always seemed to reach her before she even asked.

When obstacles loomed, his face was the first that came to mind.

And now, after hearing his love confession, she realized her heart hadn't recoiled. There was no sense of revulsion, no urge to flee. Instead, something deep inside her softened, a fragile warmth unfurling in the silence between them.
###Chapter 62 I Can't Promise I'll Fall For You


Brinley inhaled deeply, steeling herself, then lifted her eyes to meet Austin's.

His gaze held a quiet expectancy, a faint tension flickering in it, like someone awaiting a verdict.

"Austin," she said, her voice quivering but steady. "I'm not ready to give you an answer yet."

A shadow passed over Austin's eyes, but he nodded gently. "That's fine.I can wait."

"That's not what I mean," Brinley said, biting her lip as she summoned her courage. "I realize l've come to rely on you more than l expected."

She saw a spark lit up in Austin's eyes.

"So," she continued, her cheeks flushing but her words resolute, "I need a little time to see if my feelings for you might grow into something more."

The moment the words left her lips, a weight lifted from her chest. She ducked her head,too nervous to gauge his reaction.

"You want me to give you some time, right?" Austin's tone carried a trace of playful warmth.

"Yeah," Brinley muttered, barely audible. "But I can't promise l'Il fall for you."

She hesitated, then added, "And if... if it doesn't work out, you have to let me go if I fall in love with someone else."

Her heart raced as she braced for his response.

Would he think shewas asking too much? Would he be upset?

Silence hung in the air for a moment before Austin's soft chuckle, laced with affection, broke it.

"Brinley," he said, his voice warm with amusement and a hint of frustration,"Are you putting me on a trial run?" Guilt pricked at her, but she straightened, her voice firm. "What else can I do? You can't force love-it takes time."

Austin didn't argue. HHe just looked at her, his gaze tender yet resolute, brimming with quiet determination.

After a pause, he simply murmured an assent.

Brinley snuck a glance at him, catching his gentle smile.

Her heart skipped, and she quickly focused on her plate, pretending to be absorbed in her meal, though her senses were attuned to his every move.

Outside,the faint hum of summer cicadas filled the air.

Brinley's mind churned with nerves, uncertainty, and a flicker of excitement she wasn't ready to admit.

The whole idea of trying to love him... it didn't seem so bad after all.

In fact, the thought brought a small, involuntary smile to her lips.

Austin's smile widened as he noticed, his confidence growing.

A trial period? He was confident he could turn it into a lifetime commitment.

For the rest of the meal, they steered clear of the topic, but a quiet warmth blossomed between them.

Austin casually served her food, and Brinley accepted it without hesitation.

Their eyes met now and then, sparking brief moments of connection-less awkward than before,but still charged.

As they left the private dining room, Austin drove her back to her office.

Soft music played in the car, and neither spoke for a while.

Brinley's mind churned with questions, unable to fathom what was going through Austin's head.

She couldn't believe that Austin's kindness all this time was because he had feelings for her. Why her? When did his feelings start?

The car rolled to a stop in front of her office building.

As Brinley unbuckled her seatbelt, poised to step out, Austin's voice halted her. "Brinley."

She turned, brow furrowed."What?"

His gaze softened, and his tone became sincere. "Whether you end up loving me or not, I'll make sure this trial shows you I'm worth choosing."

Wordless, Brinley pushed open the door and hurried into the building, her ears burning with a quiet flush.

From an upstairs window, she watched his car pull away, her hand pressed to her chest, feeling the steady thump of her heart.

A faint smile crept onto her lips. She couldn't deny Austin's remarkable qualities, nor the stirrings she felt for him.

But love? She would proceed cautiously, determined to avoid the missteps she had made with Colin.

Meanwhile, Colin's frustration erupted as he stormed into his home, hurling his tablet onto the coffee table.

The screen remained open on the project bid winning announcement page, the bold "VantagePath Realty"text piercing like daggers, burning into his reddened eyes.

Damn it! Brinley had wrestled another project from him!

Each defeat stung more sharply than the last.

At first, he had dismissed it as luck or Austin's influence, but after reviewing her team's impeccable proposal, he had to concede-she had outdone him fair and square.

"Another loss?" Milly stepped out from the kitchen, a bowl of soup in hand, her white silk nightgown clinging to her slightly rounded belly. Her expression was filled with concern.

Colin had cited her pregnancy to keep her from the bidding conference, and she, still grappling with unease over reporting Brinley for plagiarism, hadn't objected. He avoided her gaze, his voice flat. "Brinley's proposal was better than mine."

The matter-of-fact admission cut into Milly like a blade.

Standing before him, she forced a sweet tone. "Well, she's got Austin in her corner. That's why you lost."
###Chapter 63 Shouldn't We Plan The Wedding


"It had nothing to do with Austin," Colin cut Milly off, his voice edged with impatience. "Every step of the review was documented-there's no way he could've meddled. Brinley's work speaks for itself. Her grasp of racetrack design is remarkable, and even the judge admitted she has a natural gift."

He lifted the tablet, sliding it open to Brinley's designs. His fingertips skimmed across the parameters,each one calculated down to the hundredth.

"Take a look at this..." The sharpness in his voice eased as he spoke, and though he didn't realize it, a flicker of genuine admiration lit his gaze.

Milly's hand trembled so violently the hot soup sloshed over, scalding her tender skin-yet she didn't even flinch.

A sharp, crushing ache clenched her chest, stealing the air from her lungs.

Still, she curved her lips into a soft smile and reached up to smooth the crumpled collar of Colin's shirt."get it. I was mistaken about Brinley." Her voice carried a fragile steadiness. "Well, we may have lost this round, but we'll take it back the next. You'll always have me."

Her fingers lingered, brushing deliberately against the line of his throat with a feather-light touch. "Even if I can't do much right now-being pregnant and all-I'm still here, whenever you need me."

Colin finally lifted his eyes to her, his gaze falling on the gentle swell of her belly, softening the sharp lines of his expression. "Milly, you've really carried the weight of all this."

"For you, it's nothing I'd ever regret." She melted against his chest, pressing her ear to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, though inside it felt as though thorned vines wound tight around her heart.

She knew Colin's nature too well-his calm exterior masked a relentless urge to dominate those he admired.

Once, that fire had been directed at her brilliance. Now, his reverence had drifted to Brinley. And how could she ever bear that? Milly steadied her breath, her voice trembling with wounded longing. "I really do want to help you. Just a few days ago, I even tried sketching a design for a business district, but after sitting for a short while,I got so dizzy I couldn't keep going..."

Colin's frown deepened exactly as she had anticipated, and he reached out, his hand firm on her shoulder as he eased her upright. "I told you not to push yourself. What matters now is your health and the baby's,not the company."

Her gaze lifted to him, shimmering with unshed tears, long lashes trembling. "But I want to be more than just someone you protect. I want to be useful to you." Her voice caught, colored with both yearning and defiance. "I don't want to always weigh you down. I want people to see that your wife is more than a homemaker-she's someone who can stand beside you."

Colin's weak spot had been struck cleanly.

That quiet defiance touched him more than any dramatic plea, echoing the Brinley who once stood at his side-only now it was Milly, carrying his child.

His hand drifted to her hair, stroking with uncharacteristictenderness as his voice softened. "We'll revisit this once the baby's here. For now, your only task is to take care of yourself."

Milly lowered her head with a dutiful nod, though inwardly she sneered.

She had to marry him to secure her place-before Colin's heart slipped further toward Brinley.

Her hand drifted over her belly, and she spoke in a voice softer than a sigh. "You know, I'm already four months along, yet I still haven't met your parents. My mom called the other day, asking when we'd come home for dinner, and I didn't know what to tell her."

Colin froze mid-motion.

Milly tilted her face up, her eyes shimmering with a mix of hope and unease. "Colin, shouldn't we...plan the wedding? If my belly grows much bigger, I'll look terrible in a wedding dress."

Those words struck Colin like icy water, snapping him back to reality. A wedding? Tying his life to Milly's?

Half a year ago, he would have calledit his greatest wish.

Yet everything had shifted the moment Brinley reappeared-standing on stage, voice steady, eyes alight with passion. That brilliance had stirred the still pond of his heart, sending ripples he could no longer ignore.

He often drifted into memories, replaying every moment they had once shared.

Details he had buried deep came surging back like an unstoppable tide, forcing him to face the truth-he had never really let her go.

Marrying Milly felt like severing the final thread to his past, a silent admission that Brinley was lost to him forever.

The thought left him with a resistance he couIdn't explain.

"There's too much happening at the company right now. Let's put off the wedding for a while." Colin lowered his eyes, lifted the cup, and took a slow sip before continuing, "I'll speak with your mother.You don't need to worry."

The brightness that had been shining in Milly's gaze vanished in an instant.

She quickly forced a smile, slipping her arm through his and leaning close. Her voice softened into a tender whisper. "Alright, I'Il do as you say. I know how busy you are, but... if the baby arrives out of wedlock, people will gossip."

Her fingers gave his arm a gentle shake, her tone light and almost playful, though each word pressed down with the weight of duty. "Still, it doesn't matter. As long as I'm with you, I don't care about what others say."

Watching her put on such fragile bravado, Colin's chest tightened with a heavy pang of guilt.

He turned her hand over gently, his voice softening. "Don't worry. Once this project is wrapped up, we'll go choose your wedding dress together,alright?"

Her eyes brightened instantly. "For real?" "Yes." Colin gave a firm nod, though a heavy ache pressed against his chest.

Milly rested her head on his shoulder, a smug smile tugging at her lips.

She recognized his delay for what it was, but it didn't bother her. With a man like Colin, whose heart softened easily, coaxing him gently would always succeed more than pressing him outright.

Her patience was her weapon-this baby, this hasty wedding-each step a careful tether binding him closer.

When her thoughts drifted to Brinley, her gaze fell, palm smoothing over the curve of her belly, a steely light sharpening in her eyes.

No matter how brilliant Brinley might be, in the end she was still a woman leaning on a man. How far could she really go on her own?
###Chapter 64 Brinley Was Transforming Into Something Extraordinary


As darkness enveloped the night, the villa's lights dimmed one by one, leaving only the soft amber glow of the second-floor bedroom.

Colin lay awake, the steady rhythm of MAilly's breathing beside him failing to lull him to sleep.

His phone screen glowed faintly, displaying VantagePath Realty's website. The homepage showcased Brinley standing confidently by a racetrack, her hair dancing in the breeze, her radiant smile captivating enough to draw every eye.

He gazed at the image for what felt like an eternity before switching off the screen and turning away from Milly.

Two days later, morning sunlight broke through the clouds, casting a golden hue over the scene.

The groundbreaking ceremony for Brinley's real estate project buzzed with excitement, colorful banners fluttering and upbeat music filling the air.

Brinley, dressed in a tailored red suit that accentuated her beautiful presence, took a steadying breath and ascended the stage.

A wave of applause greeted her, and her eyes instinctively swept the crowd, landing on Austin.

Clad in a casual light gray suit, tie absént and sleeves rolled up, Austin leaned against a railing, his subtle smile radiating quiet support.

Catching her glance, he lifted his water bottle in a small, encouraging gesture, as if to say, "You've got this."

Since their dinner three days prior, when Brinley had decided to try to love him, a delicate tension had simmered between them.

She had braced for awkwardness, but Austin carried on as if her words hadn't shifted a thing,his natural warmth slowly easing her nerves. Even now, he had come to support her but chose a discreet spot, ensuring he wouldn't steal her spotlight.

His admiring gaze was genuine, free of expectation, allowing her to shine without pressure.

Onstage, Brinley spoke with clarity and conviction, her voice steady as she outlined the project's vision and goals.

Her smile struck a perfect balance-professional yet warm, captivating the audience.

Below, the crowd brimmed with dignitaries, business partners, and journalists, all hanging on her words.

Brinley's gaze moved gracefully over the attendees, offering subtle nods to key figures, her poise impeccable.


Colin, who had slipped into the crowd unnoticed, stood at the edge, his eyes fixed on the luminous Brinley commanding the stage. His grip tightened on his briefcase.

He couldn't deny it-Brinley was transforming into something extraordinary.

In his memories, she was merely a charming companion, her soft voice and occasional playful outbursts endearing but unremarkable.

Yet the woman before him now exuded confidence and authority, as if destined to hold the spotlight and command the room.

He also couldn't ignore her impeccable execution of this project.

From the initial sketches to securing final approvals and now this flawless ceremony, every detail was perfect.



Brinley's ability to secure commitments from notoriously difficult sponsors was nothing short of remarkable.Whatever method she used, she had persuaded them to pour substantial resources into her vision.

"Mr. Palmer, Brinley's influence is growing undeniably stronger," his assistant whispered. "I've heard she's carving out a solid reputation in the industry, and some heavyweights think highly of her."
 
Colin's face clouded over, but he remained silent, his jaw tight. Unaware of his boss's mounting irritation, the assistant pressed on. "At a cocktail party the other night, I caught wind of some chatter about you... but maybe it's best not torepeat it."

"What did they say?" Colin demanded sharply.

The assistant wavered before reluctantly continuing, "They said you're clinging to Milly, who's all charm and no substance, while overlooking a true talent like Brinley. They called it a foolish choice."

"Shut up!" Colin barked, his outburst drawing curious stares from nearby onlookers.

He inhaled deeply, reining in his anger, and issued a cold directive. "Track down whoever is gossiping about me and teach them a lesson."

"Yes, Mr. Palmer," the assistant replied, quickly lowering his gaze.

Onstage, Brinley wrapped up herspeech with poise.

The next moment, fireworks burst overhead, and vibrant ribbons swirled through the air.

Brinley joined a group of dignitaries, each gripping a shovel to break ground, her dazzling smile glowing under the sunlight as the cascading ribbons framed her brilliance.

Colin watched her, a heavy pang gripping his chest, as though an invisible weight pressed against his heart.

He turned and silently slipped away from the scene.

After the ceremony, Brinley was swarmed by eager suppliers.

As she finished speaking with them, her phone buzzed with a message from Austin."Go easy·on the drinks tonight. I'll be there to drive you home."

She stared at the screen, her fingers pausing before typing a brief,"Alright."

That evening, the cocktail party buzzed with the clink of glasses, filled with Bleron's real estate elite.

Brinley glided through the crowd, a champagne flute in hand, warmly greeting familiar faces and exchanging cards with new contacts. Her demeanor was polished, her words articulate, as she deftly navigated discussions about partnerships and ventures.

"Mrs. Moore, you're truly a promising young woman," remarked an older executive with silver hair,clinking his glass against hers. "This project has real potential. Let's talk business soon."

"Thank you for your support. I am always open to a conversation," Brinley replied, her smile radiant with assurance.
###Chapter 65 An Invitation


As the party went on, one business partner, clearly emboldened by alcohol, leaned forward and insisted that Brinley join him for three shots of whiskey.

Brinley couldn't hold her liquor, yet she understood that refusing might come across as rude.

She steeled herself, fingers brushing the rim of the glass as she prepared to force it down-when another hand slid in ahead of hers and lifted the drink away.

"My wife doesn't hold her liquor. P'll take the three shots for her." Austin's calm but firm voice cut through the chatter.

Brinley blinked up at him, caught off guard by his sudden appearance.

Standing tall with effortless poise, Austin commanded the room's attention in an instant, his presence impossible to ignore.

"Mr. Moore?" The man's surprise deepened when Austin appeared at Brinley's side, casually taking the drinks for her. He gave a respectful nod, a touch of awe in his tone. "I didn't expect you tobe here."

Austin's response carried an even calm. "I'm here to pick up my wife." With that, he tipped his head back and swallowed all three shots in one smooth motion, never flinching.

Brinley's gaze lingered on him, warmth blooming in her chest.

She knew how much he disliked these social gatherings, yet he accepted the drinks without losing his temper, fearing he would make things difficult for her.

He was showing her, in the quietest way, just how deeply he respected her.

"Thank you," she murmured, emotion lacing her whisper as she looked up at him.

"You're welcome." Austin's reply carried a gentlé warmth, his gaze softening as it lingered on her. "It's late.Let's go home." Brinley gave a quiet nod, and the two slipped out of the party together.

During the drive, she rested her temple against the cool glass, her eyelids growing heavy with fatigue.

A faint flush colored her cheeks, the alcohol making her head swim.

The car remained hushed, broken only by the mellow hum of music drifting from the speakers.

After some time, Brinley became aware that Austin's gaze kept flickingtoward her.

She slowly opened her eyes, catching him in the act.

"What is it?" she asked softly.

"Nothing," he said, a faint smile tugging at his lips. "I just couldn't help thinking how stunning you look tonight."

Feigning composure, Brinley turned her face toward the window, gazing at the glittering nightscape blurring past.

"Don't drive yourself to the limit next time," Austin said, his voice threaded with quiet concern. "Work matters, but your health matters more."

"I know," Brinley murmured, warmth spreading in her chest at his words.

The car rolled past the villa gates when her phone buzzed. Corbin's name lit up the screen.

"Brinley, you won't believe the latest talk going around," Corbin said brightly. "They're saying Colin made a foolish choice-that he's clinging to Milly, who's all charm and no substance, while overlooking you, a true talent."

Brinley was amused. "That's enough gossip, Corbin. Get some rest. Bye."

After she ended the call, Austin shifted toward her, his brow creasing slightly. "What's the matter?"

"Just some silly gossip," Brinley replied, unfastening her seatbelt as she pushed open the car door. "They're saying Colin made a foolish choice-that he's clinging to Milly, who's all charm and no substance, while overlooking me, a true talent." She exaggerated the tone, then broke into her own laughter.

Austin studied her, his gaze steady and unreadable. "To me, you're something more."

Her smile faltered, one eyebrow arched in surprise. "What do you mean?"

His voice dropped, rich with quiet conviction that cut through the still night. "You're the woman I intend to hold dear."

Brinley froze for a heartbeat, only then grasping that his words had been a love confession.

She forced a laugh. "Oh, Austin, you are such a sweet talker," she teased.

With that, she slipped out of the car and shut the door with a firm click before striding away.

Left alone, Auustin's gaze lingered on the empty passenger seat. His brow furrowed faintly as thoughts churned in the quiet.

Back in her bedroom, Brinley stood at the window, following the sight of Austin's car as it pulled into the garage below.

His voice echoed relentlessly in her mind: "You're the woman l intend to hold dear."

Those sweet words-what had felt awkward only moments ago-now sent her pulse racing wildly.

"Get a grip, Brinley. Don't get carried away by sweet nothings," she muttered.

Then she rushed to the bathroom, forcing herself to splash cold water on her flushed cheeks. She lingered beneath an icy shower until the haze óf Austin's voice finally dulled. Only then did she collapse into bed,drifting quickly into dreamless sleep.

The following afternoon, the heat bore down mercilessly.

At three o'clock sharp, Brinley crouched beside the skeletal outline of the racetrack, hard hat shading her face as she checked measurements herself, clipboard steady in her hands.

After hours under the sun, she trudged to the temporary canopy, tugged off her helmet, and exhaled in weary relief, sweat cooling against her skin. She reached for the tablet resting on the table and pulled up the project group's reports. Just as the screen came alive, a fresh email notification slid across the top.

The sender was none other than FIA.

Brinley tapped it open, and the golden crest of the association blazed on the screen, stirring memories she had tried to bury.

The message itself was short but carried a gravity that hit her chest like a weight.

It was an invitation-summoning her to the annual exhibition race.

The alias "Rosara," highlighted in bold crimson, seared across her vision, stabbing into her like the point of a needle.

For years,FIA had continued to send her invitations.

But once she chose a life with Colin, she shut the door on the perilous world of racing.

Since then, she had gone out of her way to eraseevery trace-discarding trophies and her racing suits and refusing to watch even a second of racing news on sports channels.

She had convinced herself that the racer once called Rosara was buried for good.

Yet this email, like a key slipping into a forgotten lock, unsealed memories she thought she'd lost forever.
###Chapter 66 Double Life


Brinley swiped through her tablet, checking the track for the upcoming exhibition race.

"Mrs. Moore?" The construction foreman's voice broke her focus. "The workers said they need to adjust the slope. Do you want to double-check?"

Snapped back to the moment, Brinley quickly flipped her tablet face down on the table.

"I just sent you the measurements. Make sure to stck to them." Her voice was strained, betraying her effort to stay composed.

"Got it," the foreman replied, oblivious to her unease, and turned to relay the instructions.

Alone under the canopy, Brinley lifted her tablet again, the screen still open to the race invitation.

Her finger lingered over the "Reply" button, wavering.

Should she go?

Attending meant slipping back into her racing suit, grasping the steering wheel, and possibly facing Austin's probing gaze.

Skipping it felt like turning her back on the spark reigniting within her.

The moment she saw the invitation, her long-dormant passion for racing roared back to life, as vivid as it had been years ago at the starting line.

She wouldn't sacrifice that fire-not for anyone, not for the illusion of stability.

Taking a deep breath, Brinley tapped the screen, typing. "I'm in."

That evening, when she was back at the villa, the butler had dinner ready.

Austin hadn't returned yet. Brinley sat at te dining table, picking at her food, her thoughts consumed by the race. She needed to rebuild her skills-stamina, reflexes, the instinct for handling a car. Every piece had to be reclaimed.

After her shower, she slid into bed, pulling the covers over her as she opened her tablet to the racing simulator she hadn't touched in years.

The familiar interface sparked a rush of emotion, causing her eyes to well up with tears.

A virtual red racecar waited at the starting line, the name "Rosara" gleaming on its side.

The engine's low hum stirred her muscle memory.

Brinley's fingers danced across the virtual controls-turning, accelerating, overtaking.

Her first lap was sluggish, a full ten seconds off her best times.

Gritting her teeth, she practiced until 2 a.m., finally hitting a consistent lap time within her goal.

Exiting the app, she erased her browsing history and tucked the tablet into the nightstand drawer.

Slipping out of bed for water, she froze at the bedroom door, spotting Austin at the end of the hall in loungewear,holding a glass of water.

"Can't sleep?" His voice cut through the stillness, clear and calm.

Brinley's pulse spiked. She stretched, feigning grogginess. "No, a bit thirsty."

Austin approached, offering her the glass of water. "Is the project stressing you out? You seem exhausted."

His eyes lingered on her slightly reddened ones, concern flickering in his gaze.

"It's fine, just a bit busy," Brinley said, taking the glass. "Why are you awake?"

"I was sorting some documents." Austin studied her for a moment. "I heard noises from your room earlier."

Brinley sipped the water, forcing calm. "It was probably the wind rattling the window. I slept pretty soundly,so I didn't hear anything."

"Really?" Austin's brow arched, but he didn't push. He just brushed a strand of hair from her forehead."You can go back to sleep. If the project is too much to handle, let Miguel pull a team together to help."

"I've got it handled," Brinley said, avoiding his eyes as she turned back to her room. "I'm heading to bed."

"Brinley," Austin called softly.

She glanced back, her heart pounding.

"If something's weighing on you, I'm here," he said gently. "You don't have to carry it alone."

She nodded silently and hurried into her room.

In the days that followed, Brinley led a double life.

By day, she was the sharp, efficient project leader-checking data on-site, negotiating with vendors in boardrooms, and charming contacts at social gatherings.

By night, she trained in secret.

At 5:30 a.m., before the sky lightened, she slipped into the gym, running intervals on the treadmill and powering through core workouts, her clothes drenched with sweat.

At 11 p.m., after Austin was asleep, she locked herself in her bedroom, honing her skills on the simulator.

One morning, as she crept back from training, she found Austin on the sofa, holding her fitness tracker, its screen still displaying her recent workout stats.

"Where were you?" His voice, rough from sleep, carried a quiet intensity as his eyes scanned her sweat-soaked gym clothes.

Brinley's heart raced, her mind scrambling. "Just did some stretches in the gym. Too much desk time makes my back ache."

Austin said nothing for a long moment, setting the tracker down.

"You haven't been sleeping well lately," he said abruptly, his voice low and steady."Are you overwhelmed with the project?"  "Just a little," Brinley answered evasively, snatching her fitness tracker from the table. "Things will get better soon. I'm heading to the company now."

Clutching the tracker, she hurried out.

Only after stepping outside the villa did she let out a long, heavy breath.

Brinley didn't want Austin to know about her participation in the exhibition race.

She wasn't prepared to reveal that part of herself to him yet.

For now, she decided, it was best to keepo him in the dark about her secret identity.
###Chapter 67 Are You HidingSomething From Me
After the project meeting ended, Brinley massagedher aching temples, exhaustion weighing on her.
On her drive back to the villa, the car radio buzzegwith updates about the upcoming exhibition race.
Almost reflexively,she cranked up the volume, hergrip tightening onthesteering wheelas theannouncer mentioned the event.
Tucked behind the passenger-side sun visor was thegold-embossed invitation to the race,its emblem asilent pull on her attention.
Each morning before leaving, she would steal a qlanceat it, the sight stirring something deep within her.
Tonight, she arrived home later than usual
The living room was quiet, making her wonder ifAustin was home yet.
As she passed his study, its door slightly ajar, a warmglow spilled into the hallway.
She nearly walked by, but something on the desk caught her eye, stopping her cold.
There, bathed in lamplight, sat an envelope bearingthe same gold-embossed racing emblem as the onehidden in her car.
How was this possible?
Her breath hitched for a moment.
Had Austin received an invitation too?
"Come in," Austin's voice called from inside, tingedwith a playful tone.
Caught off guard,Brinley felt aflush ofembarrassment at being spotted.
She steadied herself with a deep breath and pushedthe door open.
Austin lounged behind the desk, casually lifting theenvelope before setting it down with a nonchalantflick. "You're back."
Brinley's eyes darted to the envelope, her breathingmeasured.
"Yeah," she said, stepping to the desk and flippingthrough some folders to mask her unease. "What'sthis? lt looks quite fancy." "lt's an invitation from FlA," Austin said, leaning backwith his arms crossed, his gaze fixed on her. "Theywant me to join the exhibition race."
"Exhibition race?" Brinley's voice tightened "Are yougoing?"
"I haven't decided yet." Austin gave the envelope asmall shake. "What do you think?"
You shouldn't go."
The words slipped out before she could stop themand she instantly regretted it.
Her response was too quick, too telling, as if she weredesperate to keep him away.
Sure enough,Austin'sbrowarched,hiseyessharpening with curiosity.
Brinley scrambled to recover, forcing a neutral tone"You're Austin Moore, a man worth billions. Whybother with a showy race? lt's dangerous. What ifthere's an accident?"
'An accident?" Austin cut in, standing abruptly
His height loomed as he stepped closer, his gazecarrying a subtle weight. "You think l will lose?"
"It's not about that," Brinley said, her back pressing against the desk's cold edge, trapped. "it's not worthit. The prize money's a drop in the bucket comparedto your projects. A loss would be humiliating, and aninjury? That would derail everything at Moore Group.
Before she could finish, Austin gently tilted her chin up
He leaned in, his face so close his breath grazed herforehead.
"You seem awfully worried about me racing. Why isthat?" His low voice sent a shiver through her.
You're imagining things." Brinley forced a calmfacade. "|'m just being realistic.
"ls that so?" Austin chuckled, letting go of her chin.Then why do you look so on edge?"
Instinctively, she stepped back, forgetting the deskbehind her. Her lower back hit the edge, and shewinced in pain.
"Be careful," Austin said, his hand swiftly finding herwaist, the warmth of his palm seeping through hershirt, igniting a spark across her skin.
They were closer now, his chest nearly brushing hershoulder, his breath warm against her neck
Brinley's heartbeat thundered, loud enough to betrayher "What are you so nervous about?" Austin asked softly
"1.." Brinley faltered, grasping for an excuse butfinding none.
Just then, her foot caught on his shoe, and shestumbled forward.
Austin's arm instinctively wrapped around her, andthey tumbled to the floor with a muffled thud, landingin a heap.
Brinley found herself in his arms, her cheek pressedagainst his shirt, his familiar scent enveloping her.
His grip tightened briefly around her waist, as ifreluctant to let go.
She tried to push herself up, but his hand gentlypressed her shoulder.
'Hold still." he said, his voice husky, tinged with theshock of their fall.
His breathing was uneven, mirroring her own. She wasforced to stay in his lap, and the intimacy of theirposition sent heat rushing to her face.
"Brinley," Austin murmured, his fingers brushing gentlythrough her hair, his touch soft. "Are you hidingsomething from me?" His eyes,deep and searching,seemed to piercethrough her defenses.
For a moment, she nearly blurted out, "l got theinvitation too.l was a pro racer, and l want toparticipate in the exhibition race!"
But she clamped down on the words, unwilling toreveal that truth. Not yet, at least.
'Stop being silly. What would l even be keeping fromyou?" Brinley dodged his eyes, giving his shoulder alight push. "Let go of me. This is weird."
Austin didn't probe further
He loosened his grip on her waist and steadied her asshe stood. "Fine, we'll leave it at that.
###Chapter 68 Austin's Test



Austin bent down, retrieved the folder from the floor,and skimmed through it. "How's the leasing for the commercial street coming along?"



Brinley forced herself to stay composed, trying to shift her focus back to business.



But the words on the page seemed to blur in her eyes,her thoughts kept circling back to Austin's earlier question and that sharp, knowing look in his eyes



He had to be suspicious.



"So far we've locked in three anchor tenants, and we're still negotiating with two others," she said, her voice betraying a slight tremor. "We should have definite outcomes by next week."



"I see." Austin gave a slow nod, fingertips brushing over the folder. "Add in that racing-themed café. It fits the overall atmosphere better."



"All right," Brinley said and nodded, but the uneasy throb in her chest wouldn't stop.



Their conversation ended quickly. Brinley scuttled out of the study, clutching the folder tightly. At the door, she glanced back. Austin was still seated at his desk, the invitation letter in hand,staring out of the window, as though lost in heavy thought.


Once outside, she leaned against the closed door and let out a long, shaky breath.



Ever since Brinley spotted that invitation in his study,she had been on edge. She resolved to train harder but with more secrecy.



In the same time, her workouts became more rigorous.Her main goal was to restore her stamina, especially her core strength. Professional racers endured g-forces up to five times their body weight in sharp corners. She couldn't afford to falter on the track.



"Need a hand?" Austin called out from the doorway,startling Brinley so much she almost tripped.



She turned and found him leaning against the door,dressed in a grey tank that revealed defined,sculpted arms.



"No, I'm fine." Brinley hit the pause button, grabbed a towel to mop her sweat, and forced a casual tone."You here to train too?"



"Yeah. Couldn't sleep," he said, walking closer, his eyes lingering on her flushed face with the faintest curve of a smile. "Your heart rate's high; you're overdoing it."



Brinley looked away and replied in a calm voice,"I can handle it. I'm used to this."


"Is that so?" He lifted a dumbbell effortlessly, his tone light. "I've been watching racing videos lately. Those racers' core strength is no joke."



His eyes flicked briefly to her waistline."How long do you think it would take the average person to build that level of strength?"



Brinley hesitated. Was he trying to test her knowledge of the racers?



"Not sure. . probably a long time," she answered,taking a sip from her water bottle. "Anyway, I'm done.Heading up."



As she walked away, she felt his stare burning into her,a heavy, unsettling weight between her shoulder blades.



From then on, he would appear without warning always armed with a probing question.



When she stayed up sketching racetrack layouts late at night, he would show up with a glass of warm milk,his eyes lingering on her drawings a moment too long



When she analyzed racing simulator data on her  computer, he would casually pass the study door,asking in an offhand tone,"What's got you so focused?"



And what unnerved her most was that he had started watching replays of actual races.



One evening, she entered his study with a plate of fruit and caught him frowning at a screen showing an intense rally



"You follow this stuff?" Brinley asked, setting the plate down and trying to sound indifferent.



"Somewhat." Austin picked up a strawberry and held it out to her. "This driver's angle is risky. What do you think?”



Caught off guard, Brinley bit into the strawberry,muttering, "Looks... impressive."



"Impressive?" Austin chuckled softly, eyes flicking to her lips. "I think he could improve his throttle control He's not managing the power delivery smoothly through the corners."



Brinley fell silent. He was right. That was the biggest weakness of that racer, and that had been her exact thought when she watched the race back then.



How did Austin catch it so quickly?



"You really know a lot about racing," she remarked. "Just a little." Austin's tone was deliberately dismissive,the same way she had brushed him off once. But the amusement in his eyes had only deepened.



Their interactions shifted, becoming more nuanced and subtle.



One evening, while they were eating dinner one night,Austin set down his utensils and said almost casually,"The FIA called again today."



After a slight pause, Brinley asked, "And what did they say?"



"They doubled the appearance fee." Austin's eyes held a teasing glint. "Looks like they're desperate for me to join."



"Don't go," Brinley blurted, then quickly added," not worth risking your life for any amount of money If something happened to you, what would become of Moore Group?"



"But now I'm curious to try." Austin set a piece of fish on her plate, his tone easy. "Who knows? Maybe I'm a natural."



"Your gift lies in business," Brinley replied firmly



She lowered her head,absently stirring her food, her chest heavy with unease Was this another test? Did he already suspect something?



"Maybe." Austin didn't drag the matter on, simply watching her in silence, his gaze intense and inscrutable.



Later that night, Brinley lay in bed, restless and unable to sleep.



After a long stretch of hesitation, she finally picked up her phone and dialed a number she had deliberately kept out of reach for years.
###Chapter 69 Do You Know Austin Moore
"Hello? Rosara?" A startled voice rang out on the other end of the line. It was Warren Barton, Brinley's former teammate. "Wow, it's been ages since you last called me!"



"Warren, I need to ask you something." Brinley sounded slightly tense. "Do you know Austin Moore?"



"Austin Moore?" Warren's voice rose instantly, full of intrigue. "Oh, I've actually crossed paths with himn! He was incredible when he dabbled in rally. Even though he never went pro, he was easily one of the best in the amateur circuit. We even raced against each other once.His cornering skills-honestly, they were more daring than some professionals I know!"



Brinley's hand trembled so hard she nearly dropped her phone.



So Austin's claim was true-he had once dabbled in racing, and his skills were surprisingly sharp.



"What's the matter? W/hy are you suddenly asking about him?" Warren sounded genuinely puzzled.



"Oh, nothing, just curious. Warren, I'll have to call you  back; something just came up."



Brinley hung up and sat on her bed, unable to steady her thoughts.



She had assumed Austin was only mildly curious about racing, but knowing how good he truly was unsettled her.



Would he really take part in that exhibition race?



Meanwhile, Austin was on a call with Miguel in his study.



"It's been confirmed, Mr. Moore," Miguel reported crisply. "The men shadowing Mrs. Moore last time were acting on your brother Ryder's orders. I've already dealt with it."



Austin leaned back in his chair, drumming his fingers lightly against the desk. His voice stayed even as he said, "Understood."



He hesitated before adding, "Also, look into..." But he stopped himself. "Never mind. Get some rest."


After Austin hung up, he opened his racing simulator and pulled up the exhibition race track map.


On the screen, a sleek black virtual car darted forward.cornering and overtaking with flawless finesse. Austin had already confirmed his participation with the FIA.



From the very beginning, he had sensed Brinley's secret passion for racing.



At one point, he'd even considered ordering Miguel to dig deeper, but he had decided against it.


He didn't need evidence. On the track, the truth would come out on its own.



Over the next few days, Brinley poured herself into her project.



The timing of the exhibition race overlapped with the final phase of her work, and she was determined to wrap it up before then.



But the more she rushed, the more obstacles appeared.



Brinley glared at the rejection notice on her screen,gripping the document tightly in frustration.



"They're demanding forty-five percent landscaping coverage?" she snapped angrily, slamming the document down on the desk. "Our plan already exceeded the national standard by three percent!Forty-five percent is impossible!" Corbin had a pale look on his face. "Mr. Saunders said ... it's a new regulation that must be strictly enforced.He also added that if we don't comply by next week,the project will be suspended."



"A new regulation?" Brinley snorted, scrolling through her recent calls. "Funny how he never mentioned it when I spoke to him yesterday."



This was the third major roadblock since the project began.



The first two times, she had revised the plan seven different times before getting approval.



And now, practically out of nowhere, a so-called new regulation had materialized.



Something wasn't adding up.



Brinley picked up her coat. "Get the car. We're going to the housing and urban development department."


Corbin quickly intervened. "But Mr. Saunders isn't in the office today. I just checked with his secretary."


"Then I'll wait at his house," Brinley said coldly. "I need to know if this is truly a new regulation or if someone is deliberately putting me in a corner."



As the car pulled away from the project site, her phone rang. It was Austin.



"Where are you?" he inquired.



"On my way to the housing and urban development department," Brinley muttered, massaging her aching temples with her palm. "The project's approval has been stalled again."



There was a pause, then Austin spoke up, his voice deep and authoritative. "Don't go. Head home and wait for me. I'll be there in half an hour."



"But..."



"Please do as I say." His tone left no room for debate."If you go now, you'll be walking straight into a trap."



Holding the phone tightly, Brinley watched the city blur past outside the window. At last, she told the driver to turn back.



She knew Austin was right, but the frustration of being targeted stung.



By the time she arrived at the villa, Austin was already in the living room, waiting for her.



He was dressed in a black suit, clearly just back from the office, tie still fastened.



As soon as he saw Brinley, he stood, walked over, and  gently brushed her messy hair back into place. "Sit."



A servant set down a drink, and Austin pushed it toward her. "Jasiah Saunders has been cozying up to Ryder lately."



Brinley froze. "Ryder? Your second brother?"



"Yes." Austin gave a small nod. "Last month, he tried to interfere in Moore Group's construction material business. I cut him off. He must be holding a grudge and is now using Jasiah to sabotage your project."



Brinley's stomach sank as everything began to make sense.



No wonder the approval process had been so painfully difficult. Austin's petty family rivalry was poisoning her project.


She frowned. "So what now? Forty-five percent landscaping is unrealistic. We can't just let the project be shut down."



"It's doable." Austin picked up a pen and swiftly sketched something on paper. "Convert the rooftops of the commercial buildings into sky gardens, and plant low shrubs in the racetrack buffer zones. That way, you can meet the requirement without compromising the track itself."
###Chapter 70 I'll Always Be On Your Side
Brinley studied the sketch, her eyes gradually brightening. "This could actually work! But... why is Jasiah so set on targeting our project? The Moore Group has interests in countless industries. Why doesn't he touch those instead?"



Austin set the pen down, staring at her face as he replied in a low, firm voice, "Because he knows I'd lose it if he went after you."


Brinley's chest tightened, a mix of warmth and bitterness stirring inside.



So this entire mess wasn't really about her at all; it was about Austin. She was only an unfortunate casualty caught in the middle.



"So, what's your plan?" she inquired.


"Teach him a lesson. I'll show him that there's a price for crossing anyone close to me." Austin's eyes turned cold and menacing as he reached for his phone.



He dialed Miguel and spoke into the phone. "Miguel,look into the bidding records for the Riverside project Jasiah handled last year." When he hung up, he noticed the tension on Brinley's face. He reached over and gently ruffled her hair."Don't stress. You will pass the review next week. For now,just focus on finishing the sky garden design."



Brinley stared at him, suddenly realizing something "You knew from the start that Ryder was behind this?"



"| suspected as much," Austin admitted calmly."Schemes like this are his style."



Brinley was frustrated. "Then why didn't you say anything earlier? I've been worrying for nothing all this time!"



"I wanted to see how tough you really are." Austin gave a low chuckle. "And you've proven to be even stronger than I expected."



At that, Brinley's irritation faded into reluctant acceptance. "Fine. But next time something like this happens, at least give me a heads-up."



"I can't do that," Austin said casually, raising an eyebrow. "But I'll always be on your side."


Brinley fell silent, not knowing how to respond.



For the next three days, she threw herself into leading her design team, working nonstop to incorporate the sky garden into the overall project. Every evening, Austin would drop by, not to interrupt,but to sit nearby handling his own work. Whenever she hit a block, he'd quietly offer a suggestion that helped her push through.



By Friday afternoon, the revised design was finally submitted.



Brinley stared nervously at the progress bar on the approval system,her palms clammy.



"It's approved!" Corbin suddenly shouted, pointing at the screen. "Mr. Saunders even said it's innovative and worth promoting!"



Flooded with relief, Brinley slumped into her chair and exhaled deeply.



That evening, when she walked through the door of the villa, the scent of food drifted out to greet her.



Austin was in the kitchen, apron tied around his waist,bathed in the soft glow of the setting sun as he carried out a dish.



"You're back," he said with a warm smile in his eyes."We're celebrating your success tonight."



Later during dinner, Brinley couldn't hold back her curiosity. "What exactly did you do to Jasiah? His sudden turnaround is completely unexpected." Austin slid a piece of fish onto her plate and answered casually, "Just had Miguel send the disciplinary committee an anonymous report on his shady practices."



Brinley was momentarily speechless.



That was Austin's style through and through-direct,efficient, and decisive.



"And Ryder?" she asked.



"He's tied up dealing with the committee's investigation now. He doesn't have time to make trouble for us." Austin took a slow sip of soup, his eyes fixed on her. "But this is only the start. My family is capable of playing far dirtier than you think."



Brinley had a concerned frown on her face now. "Are you saying..."



Setting his utensils down and looking at her seriously,Austin began, "Well, it's too late to back out now.You're bound to me."



Brinley met his gaze, then suddenly laughed. "Back out? Do you really think I'm afraid?"



Austin simply smiled in return, refusing to say anything Austin's move forced Ryder to focus on cleaning up his own mess, leaving him no time to sabotage Brinley's project.



Her work finally returned to its normal pace. As progress advanced, she carved out her spare hours to keep training for the exhibition race.


One morning, she was already at the gym by six o'clock.



She ran for forty minutes, with sweat-soaked strands of hair sticking to her forehead.



The heart rate monitor on her wrist buzzed,signaling that her pulse had spiked.



Her core strength was back to about seventy percent of what it once had been, yet whenever she pushed herself this hard, her muscles still protested with a dull ache from the strain.



Brinley clenched her jaw, ignored the warning flashing on her monitor, and pushed the treadmill speed up another notch.



Just then, a faint thud disrupted the stillness of the gym.



She turned toward the sound. Austin stood there,two cups in his hands.


He was wearing a gray sports vest, his shoulders and back sharply defined in the morning light, with sweat still glistening on his arms from a round of dumbbell lifts.



"Still not done?" he called out, walking over and offering her one of the cups. "I added honey. It's at the perfect temperature."



Ever since he discovered her training, Brinley had stopped bothering with excuses.



She enjoyed working out and wanted to stay strong and in shape. There was nothing wrong with that, of course.



Now, Austin had made it a routine too, showing up every morning for hisworkouts, sometimes peeling off his top when he felt too hot, flaunting his toned abs without a word.



Brinley accepted the cup, her fingers brushing against the back of Austin's hand. His skin was slick and hot from exercise, burning against hers like a small flame.



She took a sip, the honeyed water soothing her parched throat instantly.
###Chapter 71| Can't Believe You Actually Came
 "Stayed up too late again? You've got dark circles under your eyes," Austin remarked, studying Brinley carefully.


Brinley flashed an awkward smile.



He wasn't wrong; she had hardly slept. The night before,she had gotten carried away practicing on her racing simulator until the early hours.



"I was buried in work and lost track of time," she fibbed, then quickly changed the subject. Glancing toward the staircase, she added, "By the way,could I borrow your copy of 'Racetrack Engineering Analysis'?We're preparing a racer interview segment forthe project, and I need to refresh my understanding of the technical details so I can sound well-informed and credible when I'm asking questions during the interviews."



Austin arched an eyebrow. "All of a sudden, you're interested in racing?"



"It's just for work," Brinley said, keeping her tone calm."You know the project is racing-themed. I should be able to hold a conversation with the partners, at least." Austin didn't push further. With a slight nod, he said,"The book is in my study-the one with the red cover on the third shelf. Be careful with it. It's out of print."



Brinley already knew it was rare, which was exactly why she had asked him for it.



She nodded. "Alright, no problems."


She exhaled in relief, about to continue,when Austin grabbed his things from the equipment rack. With a casual wave, he said, "I'm heading out."



Brinley watched him walk away, realizing only then that her excuse hadn't been particularly convincing.



Had he already seen through her story?



As she stood lost in thought, Austin suddenly turned back. "And make sure you eat regularly."



"Oh... okay," Brinley stammered, snapping back to reality.



Without another word,Austin left the gym.



Once he was gone, Brinley switched off the treadmill and remained in place for a while, taking a moment to steady herself and collect her thoughts.



Her mind wandered to the book, "Racetrack Engineering Analysis," which had detailed notes on a professional racer known as Nightblade. Before she retired from racing, she had competed against him,and he'd been a formidable opponent.


With the passing years, his skills might have gotten better.



It was rumored that he would be entering the exhibition race.



Since Brinley was going to take part, she wanted nothing less than first place. And knowing her rivals was the first step toward victory.



She walked to the window and opened it slightly.


Downstairs, Austin's black Maybach rolled slowly down the driveway.



She stood watching until it disappeared at the end of the street before turning toward the staircase and heading into the study.



On the third shelf sat the book with the worn red cover. The gold lettering on its spine was faded from age.


Taking a deep breath, Brinley opened the book and began to read with focused intensity


 
The digital clock on the desk ticked softly, switching to seven-thirty. Startled, she snapped the book shut, tucked it under her arm, and rushed out of the study.



She needed to be at the project site by eight; the supervisor was waiting



Passing through the kitchen, she noticed a white porcelain bowl set neatly on the table, filled with warm porridge. A small dish of sliced pickles sat beside it.



A servant approached and said politely, "Mrs. Moore,Mr. Moore asked me to prepare breakfast for you. He reminded me to tell you not to skip it."



"Alright," Brinley replied softly



It seemed the supervisor would have to wait a little longer



Brinley sat down, picked up a spoon, and started enjoying her breakfast.



After breakfast, she headed to the project site for the morning. Later that afternoon, Brinley drove to the private racetrack tucked away in the mountains outside the city.



With the exhibition race drawing closer, she needed to get a feel for the track in advance.



She had arranged the trip discreetly, telling Austin she  would be spending the entire day at the project site,using that as a cover to hide her real intentions.



The track lay hidden among the hills, reachable only by a narrow cement road. The place was closed to the public, open only to a select few. Yet within racing circles, it was well known as a training ground for professionals seeking to escape the spotlight


Brinley parked her car, pulled on oversized sunglasses and a mask, and retrieved a black suitcase from the trunk.



Unzipping it, she changed quickly



Her newly tailored fireproof suit was a deep red,patterned with subtle roses woven into the fabric. It fit snugly and comfortably, molding perfectly to her figure.



Once she fastened the helmet over her head, the world's noise dulled instantly, leaving only the sound of her steady breathing.



In the repair area under the canopy, several mechanics in uniforms were working on a silverrace car.



When Brinley appeared, a bearded man broke into a grin. "Rosara! I can't believe you actually came!"



Brinley smiled beneath her helmet. "Jensen, is the car  ready?"



"Of course." Jensen Rayne, her longtime friend and mechanic, nodded toward the corner. "The red one,modified just like your old setup."



Before coming, Brinley had reached out to a few people she trusted completely.


They knew her only by her helmet, having never seen her face.



She didn't want her identity revealed, and they understood not to ask questions.



Walking over, Brinley ran her fingertips lightly along the hood of the red car.



Its sleek contours gleamed under the light, and the small rose emblem on the side had been her signature on the track.



Though years had passed, the cold feel of the mnetal stirred her muscle memory, sending a rush of heat through her fingertips.



"Thank you, Jensen," she mumbled, her voice soft with emotion.



"The voice changer's set up," Jensen said, handing her a Bluetooth earpiece.
###Chapter 72 Encountering Austin
Brinley slipped on her earpiece. The voice changer transformed her clear tone into a low, neutral rumble.



"All good," she told Jensen.



As she settled into the driver's seat, a wave of familiarity washed over her.



The suede steering wheel, smoothed by years of her grip, was her own choice.



The pedals were meticulously adjusted to her feet,and the seat was tilted just right for maximum effort



When the engine roared to life, its deep growl was like a beast awakening, vibrating through the seat with raw power.


Brinley's fingers tapped lightly on the wheel,her eyes scanning the dashboard's flickering numbers, a grin spreading across her face.



"Rosara, do you want a warm-up lap?" Jensen asked from outside the car.



"No need," Brinley replied, snapping her seatbelt into  place, her relaxed air giving way to razor-sharp focus "Let's hit the track!"



The red racecar launched from the pit like a shot,slicing through the air.



At the first turn, she cranked the wheel, the car drifting through the corner at its limit, tires screaming.



Wind whipped through the open window, tugging at her hair.



Brinley zeroed in on the track, her senses razor-sharp.After two laps, her old rhythm clicked back into place



On the final corner, she held off braking for an extra 0.3 seconds, letting the car dive into the turn with reckless flair, its tail brushing dangerously close to the barrier.



It was her signature move from years ago, always catching rivals off guard at the last second.



"Perfect!" Jensen's voice crackled through the earpiece, brimming with excitement.



Brinley had just begun to relax when a new roar erupted from the track's entrance.



The sound was deep and primal, like a predator baring its teeth. The sound alone screamed it was a high-displacement, heavily modified racing machine. Brinley eased off the gas, her red car slowing on the straight.



In the rearview mirror, a black racecar streaked in like a bolt of lightning, carving through corners with surgical precision.



Brinley froze, her eyes locked on the car.Its cornering angles and throttle control were hauntingly familiar,echoing her old rival, Nlightblade.


The black car closed in fast, pulling alongside her on the straight.


Her heart skipped a beat, her grip tightening on the wheel.



Both cars rolled to a stop at the pit entrance.



The black car's door swung open, and a man in a sleek black racing suit stepped out.



As he removed his helmet, sharp features emerged,sweat tracing his jawline, glinting in the sun.



Brinley's breath caught.



Austin? How could he be here? Wasn't he supposed to be meeting clients overseas?



He had lied to her! Austin's eyes widened slightly as he spotted Rosara,his gaze catching the rose emblem on her helmet.


Since Rosara's legendary days, copycats had swarmed,especially after she vanished. Her rose emblem had become a talisman for some, hoping to borrow her luck.



Austin studied her, clearly wondering if she was the real Rosara or just another pretender.



Leaning against his car, fingers drumming lightly on the roof, Austin asked, "First time here?"


Brinley deepened her voice, letting the voice changer blunt her tone. "Heard this track was open for practice,so I thought I would have some fun."


She forced an awkward edge to her words, mimicking a nervous rookie.



"Fun,huh?" Austin chuckled, his eyes scanning her red car. "Interesting mods. That air intake grille's tuned for low-speed corners but compromises straight-line speed. Whoever built this is a tactical driver."



Brinley's pulse quickened.


Few,even among top mechanics, would notice those details so quickly. She pretended to check the tires, brushing her fingers over the warm rubber surface. "A friend's gift. I don't understand modifications. As long as it drives, it's fine."



"Is that so?" Austin stepped closer, stopping by her driver's side. "Your line says otherwise. Delaying the brake by 0.3 seconds on that last corner-bold move.Skill or dumb luck?"



Brinley froze, glancing up through her tinted visor,meeting his probing stare



"Just messing around," she said, turning the key to rev the engine. "I don't know anything about braking points. My foot probably slipped."



Austin didn't let her off so easily, tapping her window lightly. "Your left hand drags the wheel half a turn down when cornering-a classic racer's technique.Most new drivers just muscle through with their arms Not many have that kind of finesse."



A chill ran down Brinley's spine. That move was a rare trick she had picked up from an old coach.



"Maybe... it's just a coincidence," she muttered,sliding the window shut to cut off the conversation. "I'm going to run a few more laps."



"Hold on," Austin said, his hand stopping her. His eyes flicked to her car's rear wing. "That angle is too safe.  With your speed on that last corner, you would get better grip by lowering it."



He paused, then added with a knowing smile, "But to each their own. Maybe you just like it that way."


Brinley didn't answer, slamming the accelerator.


The red car surged forward like a loosed arrow, tearing away from the pit.
###Chapter 73 Had He Come Looking For Her
From the rearview mirror, Brinley caught sight of Austin standing with his hands slipped casually into the pockets of his racing suit as he stared firmly at her car.


The sunlight wrapped him in a golden glow, but a shiver still ran down Brinley's spine.



The uncanny insight in his words made her shiver.



His deep understanding of cornering techniques and his spot-on evaluations of modifications... Aflicker of suspicion began to glow within her.



The red race car tore down the track, but Brinley's focus faltered.



In her mind, Austin's image blurred and overlapped with her memory of the enigmatic racer known as Nightblade.



Nightblade had been just as mysterious as she was-never appearing off the track, existing only as a shadow within the racing world.



Could it be that... Brinley quickly shoved the thought away. No. It was absurd. Austin was the head of the Moore Group, a man consumed by business. How could he possibly be involved in professional racing?



Forcing her thoughts back into order,she steadied her breathing and deliberately chose the safest line through the final corner, braking cleanly like a novice determined not to take risks.



When she rolled back into the pit, Austin was still there.



The pit crew member was changing the tires on his sleek black race car, while he sat perched on a toolbox, scrolling through track data. Looking up as she approached, he asked calmly, "Done practicing?"



"Pretty much. Time to call it a day," Brinley answered quickly.



Austin rose and walked over. "Next time, if there's a chance,we should do a couple of laps together."



His eyes flicked briefly to her rose-patterned helmet."I'm very interested in you."



Brinley's heart almost stopped beating. She muttered a curt reply, snatched up her backpack, and left.



At the doorway, she risked one last glance back.  Austin was still watching her, his eyes as deep as an abyss.



Sliding into her car, Brinley tugged off the voice changer and exhaled hard. Cold sweat plastered her racing suit to her skin, making her shiver uncomfortably.



She started the engine. Behind her, Austin's black race car fired up with a roar, shooting down the track,its thunderous growl echoing into the distance.



Brinley drummed her fingers lightly on the steering wheel, her mind in knots.



Could Austin truly be Nightblade?



Was their meeting at the track today pure coincidence,or had he come looking for her?



The questions crowded her thoughts, leaving her unsettled about the upcoming exhibition race.



When Brinley arrived home that evening, she found a small bouquet of fresh sunflowers placed neatly at the center of the long dining table, their cheerful brightness filling the room with warmth. The aroma of rich, savory dishes drifted through the air, awakening her appetite.



After slipping into comfortable home clothes,she saw Austin step out of the kitchen, carrying a steaming  dish.



"Smells incredible," she said with a smile, her tone lighter



Though their unexpected encounter at the racetrack still lingered in her chest, seeing him in this familiar,domestic space eased some of her unease.



Austin set the dish on the table and took a seat across from her. "Fresh from the stove. Best eaten while it's hot."



He served her a rib, adding, "I know you like sweet, so I added extra sugar."



Looking down at the glossy rib in her plate, Brinley felt a warm feeling spread inside her chest.



Austin usually preferred lighter flavors, rarely making sweet dishes. This one was clearly for her.



"Thanks," Brinley muttered, lowering her head as she took a gentle bite



The meal went on in silence, the soft clinking of cutlery the only sound between them.



Brinley carefully steered away from racing talk,instead recounting amusing incidents from the construction site. When she mentioned the supervisor blowing up again over the workers slacking, Austin chuckled under his breath.



"Is the asphalt work moving smoothly?" he asked suddenly,ladling soup into her bowl.


"Yes. The hardness tests passed; we can mark the track lines next week." She took a sip of the soup before adding, "When will the imported guardrail samples arrive? I'd like to run some checks myself."



"They should land tomorrow. I'll let you know once they're in." Austin nodded, staring at the small curve of her lips before shifting gears. "I stopped by a private racetrack this afternoon. Met a racer worth noting."



Brinley froze for an instant, masking her surprise with feigned interest. "Oh? What kind of racer?"



"Wore a rose-patterned helmet," Austin said casually,sipping his soup, his eyes watching her closely. "Drove a red car. The modifications were clever."



Brinley tried hard to keep her expression neutral."A rose-patterned helmet? That's unusual. Were they better than you?"



"Hard to judge," Austin replied, setting his spoon down."Straight-line speed was average, but the cornering  was bold,almost reckless."



"Sounds professional enough," Brinley said, forcing herself not to flinch. "But I don't know much about racing."



"Is that so?" Austin chuckled softly, a glint of amusement flickering in his eyes. He didn't press further. Instead, he added another serving to her plate."This one's tender. You'll like it."



Brinley stared at the food before her, lost in thought.


Austin was like a hunter. He had his prey in sight, but instead of striking, he circled patiently, tightening the trap.


The subtle pressure of his probing was far more unnerving than an open confrontation.



She placed her cutlery down, leaned forward slightly.and with a sudden laugh, said teasingly, "You seem to remember that racer's car awfully well. Tell me, Austin,are you interested in the one wearing the rose-patterned helmet?"
###Chapter 74 Milly's Schemes
Austin blinked, clearly caught off guard by Brinley's question. After a beat, a wider grin spread across his face. "I'm more invested in the woman sitting here with me than in any racer hidden behind a helmet."



His eyes lingered on her with disarming sincerity."You get to eat my cooking. The one in the helmet doesn't get this privilege."



Heat crept into Brinley's cheeks, and she let out a sharp little scoff. "You really are a shameless sweet-talker."



"I'm only stating facts," Austin countered lightly, his tone threaded with amusement. "Tomorrow I'll have Miguel drop off a set of racing documentaries-deep dives into classic events. Since you're working on that interview segment, they could prove useful."



The suggestion came off casual, yet deliberate, a seamless blend of generosity and another gentle nudge toward racing.



Brinley recognized it instantly as one of his subtle probes, but no excuse came to mind strong enough to turn him down. "Thanks," she murmured, spearinga bite of food. Then her voice softened. "But watching documentaries only gives theories. Maybe... when you have a chance,you could explain it to me in person? You clearly know cars, and nothing beats firsthand knowledge."


With that, she tilted her head, offering him a faint, sly smile.



If there was no escaping his game, she might as well take the lead and see where it carried them.



Austin caught the spark of defiance dancing in her eyes and let out a low chuckle. "I'd be glad to."



He slid another rib onto her plate with casual ease."Go on, eat before they cool off-doesn't taste the same once they lose the heat."



The dinner carried a quiet undercurrent, a balance between comfort and tension.



Their talk drifted from updates on work projects to the occasional detour into racing.



As the conversation stretched on, Brinley became aware that Austin's manner wasn't intrusive.



He wasn't prying or stripping away her defenses.Instead,it felt like a subtle game played in silence, one where both knew the rules without spelling them out. Every so often, he lobbed a question her way,gauging her reaction with sharp eyes, then effortlessly pivoted to a different subject.



A strange tingle ran through her chest. Logic told her to be wary, but instead of resistance, a quiet spark of anticipation stirred in her veins.



Brinley gave her head a sharp shake, dismissing the absurd thought, and lowered her gaze to the rib waiting on her plate.



The sweet-and-sour glaze coated her tongue,its layered flavors echoing her own mood-tangled,bittersweet, impossible to name.


Across town, Milly reclined on a cushioned spa bed, a cool mudpack spread evenly over her face.



The beautician's hands kneaded her shoulders with practiced ease, working slow, steady circles along her tense neck.



Though the treatment should have been indulgent,a crease remained etched between Milly's brows, her troubled thoughts refusing to loosen their grip.



Her phone buzzed with a curt text from Colin. "Dinner party tonight. Won't be back."


Milly's chest tightened as she stared at the screen,  emotions tangling inside her



Since Brinley launched her flashy racing-themed real estate project, Colin's visits home had dwindled.


On the rare nights he did appear, he sat glued to his laptop, the glow of the monitor often revealing Brinley's company page.



Unease clung to Milly like a shadow. Brinley's name lingered everywhere-on Colin's lips, in his work, in his thoughts.



Brinley wasn't just climbing higher in her career;she seemed determined to reclaim the very place Milly held most dear-Colin's attention.



Milly couldn't accept it!



On the next bed, a woman reclined with her phone pressed to her ear, her voice lilting with syrupy sweetness as she gossiped about love and romance.



All at once, the conversation shifted. "What did you just say? Rosara's staging a comeback? Seriously?"



Milly blinked her eyes. Her ears caught every word.



Rosara?



The name struck a chord-wasn't that the female racer who had once dominated headlines, only to  vanish without a trace?



"She will attend the upcoming exhibition race? Really?"the woman asked, her voice rising with excitement.



The conversation dissolved into noise,and Milly barely paid attention until a particular name cut through.


"Brinley? You mean the one leading that racing-themed project? She's entering the race herself?" the woman asked in surprise.



The words jolted Milly so hard her pulse skipped,nearly propelling her upright off the bed.



Milly reeled at the thought-Brinley entering a car race?



The revelation tore through her haze like a flash of lightning



For weeks she had been clawing for a weakness, yet every angle crumbled against Brinley's spotless project and Austin's steadfast support. Any frontal attack would have been a suicide mission.



But this changed everything. A real estate developer participating in an exhibition race was bound to spark whispers.



With the right push, the spectacle could be twisted into a circus act-a shameless ploy for attention dressed up as ambition. Milly's thoughts spun in circles.


Brinley was determined to secure her place as a rising star in real estate while simultaneously dazzling the racing world.



Yet that daring two-front campaign was as dangerous as wielding a blade with no handle-one wrong move,and it could slice straight through her. The spectacle could collapse into disaster.



"Take this mask off, now," Milly ordered abruptly,her voice sharp with urgency.



The beautician froze, startled. "But the treatment isn't finished yet..."



"Take it off. Now!" Milly insisted.



The beautician peeled away the mudpack, and Milly wasted no time. She swept on a layer of makeup with brisk strokes, snapped her compact shut, and slung her bag over her shoulder before striding out of the beauty salon.



Sliding into the back seat of her car, she immediately punched in a number.



On the other end was an entertainment reporter Colin had once introduced her to-a man who thrived on scandals and click-bait headlines "I've got something worth your while," Milly murmured,lowering her voice with a deliberate air of secrecy."A crossover bombshell-real estate colliding with racing.The kind of story that'll set the internet on fire."
###Chapter 75 Rumors Spread
"Miss Russell, please go ahead," said the voice on the other end, carrying a note of curiosity.



"You've heard of Brinley Moore, haven't you? The one tangled up in real estate." Milly reclined against the leather seat, eyes flicking to the blur of city lights streaming past the window. A sly smile curved across her lips. "She's signed up for an international exhibition race."



"An exhibition race?" Reporter Johnnie Quinn's tone spiked with disbelief. "Does she even know how to handle a race car?"



"Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't." Milly's low laugh carried a teasing edge, every word laced with implication. "Funny how someone with no racing background suddenly decides to jump behind the wheel. The only reason she landed that spot is because Austin pulled strings. This whole thing screams publicity stunt, just a flashy way to draw attention and inflate her project's profile."



Johnnie narrowed his eyes. "And you can actually prove that?"



Milly let out a sly laugh. "Prove it? Please. A real  estate developer strutting onto a professional racetrack? Don't you find it absurd? Drop it anonymously, splice together her glossy construction -site shots with a few from the circuit, then add snide little captions. That'll stir things up fast."


She leaned back, voice dripping with calculation."And make sure to tie it back to her racing-themed project.Suggest she's willing to gamble her life just to grab headlines. That'll have people in an uproar."


Johnnie sounded persuaded. "Tha's quite a scoop,Miss Russell.Once it's done..."



"I will pay you generously," Milly interrupted coolly,her voice edged with warning. "But don't forget-this must never circle back to me or Colin."



"Relax, I know how the game works."


When the call ended, no sense of triumph came.Instead, a sharper unease pressed at Milly's chest.She quickly dialed another number, one she'd saved from a late-night exchange on a racing forum-a fringe figure drifting from one racing team to another,scraping together cash by peddling gossip and inventing scandals about drivers.



"I need your help," Milly said, her tone dropping into an icy register. "I want you to spread a little rumor through the racing circle." The voice that answered on the other end dripped with flattery. "What kind of rumor are we talking about?"



"About Brinley Moore," Milly said coolly, her gaze fixed on her reflection in the darkened car screen,her eyes gleaming like shards of ice. "Make it sound like her participation in the exhibition race isn't about passion at all-it's because her real estate project is bleeding funds. She's clawing for investors and hoping the racing crowd will bite."



Milly let the words hang in the air before lowering her tone, every syllable sharpened with intent. "And don't keep it vague. Tell them she can't even read the flags.She once misinterpreted a blue flag as yellow on a private track and nearly rear-ended the car ahead.Swear you saw it yourself-that way, no one questions it."



A hesitant voice slipped through the receiver. "Isn't that a little... far-fetched?"



"The wilder the rumor, the faster it spreads," Milly sneered, her tone dripping with malice. "The more absurd it sounds, the more eager people will be to believe it. Make sure it feels like privileged insider talk,laced with contempt for her fake sophistication."



"Got it! I'll handle it right away!" the voice on the other end replied with enthusiasm. Once the call ended, Milly sank back into her chair,exhaling a long breath as tension gave way to satisfaction.



Her gaze drifted to the window, where the gleaming Moore Group skyscraper cut into the skyline. A faint,triumphant glimmer lit her eyes.


So Brinley wanted victory, did she?


Very well. She would ensure Brinley's defeat was a public and humiliating one.



By midafternoon, the headline "Real Estate New Force Brinley Moore Racing for Publicity" had climbed to the top of the local trending list at a startling speed.



The faceless account that lit the fire had posted a barbed message dripping with provocation. "Insider leak: Brinley Moore, a businesswoman behind a racing -themed real estate project, is set to appear in the international exhibition race. But whispers in the industry say she's clueless about racing and only secured her entry because Moore Group's CEO,Austin Moore, pulled strings. Shouldn't she stick to concrete and blueprints instead of chasing attention on the track? Is this a cash-grab stunt, or merely a desperate attempt to gain attention?"



The hashtag with Brinley's name lit up, fueling gossip. The post highlighted two images set side by side. One showed Brinley on-site in her work clothes, streaks of dust across her face, her hair undone, every bit the gritty developer in the middle of construction chaos.



The other blazed with glamour-a sleek poster for the international exhibition race, a professional racer captured in sharp colors and roaring energy.


Set in pointed contrast, the images formed a jarring mismatch, whispering ridicule at Brinley's daring self-belief.



Within minutes, the comments section detonated.



"A real estate developer stepping onto a race track?Quite the stunt, isn't it?"


"I always figured her project was a gimmick-now she's trying to play influencer?"


"With Mr.Moore behind her, it's no wonder-she gets away with anything she wants."



"Poor Colin-dumped by Brinley, only to watch her end up with Mr. Moore."


A torrent of hostile remarks surged online,drowning out the rare voices that dared to question whether the so-called leaks were even genuine. Almost at once, the nation's largest racing forum exploded with an anonymous thread flaunting a scandalous headline: "Unbelievable! Real Estate's Rising Star Can't Even Recognize Track Flags Yet Dares to Race?"



The story spread like a wildfire-slipping from entertainment tabloids to investment boards and finally infecting the racing community itself.


In Colin's apartment, Milly reclined carelessly on the edge of the sofa, one ankle crossed over the other,her fingers tapping idly against her phone.Each fresh notification lit her screen with another cruel comment or surging hashtag. The corners of her lips curved into a slow, triumphant smile, her eyes gleaming wwith spite.



This was the outcome she had schemed for-a public frenzy sharp enough to shred Brinley's carefully built image into pieces.



Milly's lips curled into a venomous whisper. "Brinley,this is only the start. When your reputation crumbles,let's see if Colin or Austin will still be by your side."



The muffled sound of footsteps drifted in from the living room-Colin had come back.



Milly swiftly hid her spite behind a harmless smile,gliding into the kitchen to make dinner as though she hadn't just set a media frenzy ablaze.
###Chapter 76 Racing Is A Personal Interest
Brinley was still at the project site, double-checking the accuracy of the track markings, completely unaware of the storm brewing across the internet.



Her phone, left on top of a toolbox, kept lighting up and dimming, buzzing with notifications she ignored.


It wasn't until Corbin rushed over and urged her to return to the office that she finally saw the flood of messages and the swirl of rumors spreading online.



She had never intended to race under her real name,but somehow the information had leaked, quickly going viral.



Back at the company, the senior staff had already gathered in the conference room. They sat around the long table,tension written across their faces.


In front of each person were printed reports with bold,sensational headlines.



"Rising Real Estate Star Dabbles in Racing-Industry Questions Professionalism"



"Brinley Moore Using Project for Publicity? Housing  andUrban Development Department LaunchesReview"



"Brinley, so it's true? You really are entering the race?Or is this just a rumor?" Jerome Byrd, one of the most experienced members of the team, finally broke the silence. His face was lined with worry and disapproval.


Brinley paused for a moment, then nodded slowly."Yes. At this point, there's no sense denying it."



Jerome let out a surprised gasp. "In the real estate industry, reputation and stability are everything! Why would you invite this chaos? If you lose, people will gossip about it and even question your professional credibility!"


"I'm not doing this for publicity," Brinley explained,looking up to look at him. "Jerome, you've worked with me for years; you know I don't make reckless decisions."



"Not reckless? Then what is this?" Jerome's voice rose."To prove you can race? Is that really worth it? You've poured endless nights and all your energy into this project. Why gamble with it now?"



"It's exactly because we're at a crucial stage that l have to race," Brinley retorted. She picked up one of the reports and pointed at a line. "Look at this. They're saying I don't even know flag signals or track rules.Letting these lies stand unchallenged would hurt the  project more than anything else."



Corbin added cautiously, "But if the government freezes the approval process, the financial damage would be huge."



"Approvals depend on compliance and quality, not on whether I can drive a car," Brinley said as she rose and walked toward the floor-to-ceiling window. "I'lI make it clear to Elisha that racing is a personal interest,unrelated to the project's professionalism. But giving up is not an option. Some doubts can only be silenced on the track."



"Brinley!" Jerome stood too, slamming a hand on the table. "Your hobby cannot outweigh the future of this company. Don't you see? Our competitors are waiting for you to slip. You're giving them ammunition!"


His voice faltered, but then he added, "Racing isn't something you master overnight. If you perform poorly, the damage to our credibility will be even worse. It would be smarter to clarify things now and minimize the fallout."



The conference room went quiet, the only sound Jerome's heavy breathing.



Corbin opened his mouth as if to speak but fell silent again.



The legal advisor pushed up his glasses, breaking the  silence with a cautious voice. "From a legal standpoint, Brinley's personal involvement in racing won't impact approval. But from a public relations angle, the risks are real and shouldn't be dismissed."



Brinley turned back, glancing over each face at the table. "I understand your concerns. But trust me,I'll deliver results you'll be satisfied with."



She grabbed her car keys and strode toward the door.



Before leaving, she added, "Have PR prepare a feature on racer training routines-their schedules, their intensity. Push it to our media partners tomorrow."



Looking at the worried faces around the table, she softened her tone with a reassuring smile. "Don't be afraid. Leave this to me. The exhibition race is just around the corner. The harsher the criticism now, the stronger the comeback will be."



With that, Brinley walked away.



Corbin watched her retreating figure and sighed."Honestly... Brinley has a point. Our whole project is built around the spirit of racing. If even the leader won't face challenges head-on, wouldn't that make the message hollow?"



Jerome dropped back into his chair, chest rising and falling with emotion. His voice was quieter now. "It's not that I don't want her to race. I just don't want her  to get hurt. And the project could suffer significant negative consequences as a result. She's the one who has given the most to this, working day and night,pushing herself harder than anyone. I've seen it all."



The legal advisor leaned forward, adjusting his glasses."Then let's support her strategically. I'll draft a statement stressing that her racing is entirely personal and unrelated to the project. Corbin, line up some positive coverage-highlight the eco-friendly materials we're using, and show the professionalism of our work. Shift the focus back where it belongs."



"I'll handle it right away," Corbin said with a nod.


Jerome sighed and picked up the blueprints spread on the table.



The design of the track-its smooth curves and sharp angles-bore Brinley's imprint in every detail. Every line showed her persistence,her passion.



Maybe he had been too cautious. Maybe Brinley really could prove herself.



By then, Brinley had already left the company.



Instead of heading straight to the racetrack,she drove to the Housing and Urban Development Department


She took a file folder with her, its contents her strongest arguments against doubt: the latest  environmental assessment reports and updated progress schedules.



When she walked out of the building, the sky was washed in red by the setting sun.


Elisha's attitude had been less severe than she expected. Perhaps the solid evidence had swayed him.In the end, he simply said, "Be careful with your personal choices. Don't let them create problems for the project."
###Chapter 77 It Seems Like You're Coming Along Nic...
Brinley eased into the driver's seat, clicking her seatbelt into place as her phone buzzed.



The name "Austin" lit up the screen, and after a brief pause, she swiped to pick up.



"Where are you?" Austin's rich, steady voice came through.



"I just left the Housing and Urban Development Department," Brinley replied, turning the key in the ignition. "Did you see those rumors floating around online?"



A faint shuffle of papers sounded from Austin's end."Yeah. Do you want me to handle it?"



Brinley's fingers tightened around the wheel.


She knew Austin could squash the gossip effortlessly,but that wasn't her style.



"No,I've got this," she said quietly. "I signed up for the exhibition race-so this mess is on me to clean up."



A brief silence followed, then a soft chuckle. "How do  you plan to handle it? Learning more about racing from the book 'Racetrack Engineering Analysis' that you borrowed from me?"



Brinley's cheeks flushed, a touch of embarrassment hitting her. "Stop teasing me. I'm thinking of having PR drop some training shots and tie them to old interview pieces to shift the narrative."


"Fair enough, I'll stop," Austin said, his tone growing serious. "Where are you practicing? Do you need someone to look out for you?"


"No need to bother," Brinley replied quickly."I've got some old friends helping me out."



She definitely didn't want to run into Austin at the track, especially not while she was there only as Brinley, without her professional facade.



Austin's voice stayed even. "Stay safe then, and come home early tonight. I had the chef whip up some soup for you."



"Got it," Brinley said, ending the call swiftly


She sank back in her seat, staring out at the fading twilight and letting out a slow breath.



Austin's easygoing demeanor always masked his knack for hitting her weak spots. Instead of heading home, she steered toward a racetrack on the city's edge.



Less isolated than her previous spot, it was perfect for someone "new" to practice in.



She had already told Jensen to stash the red racecar and bring out a plain white one instead.



As she pulled in, Jensen was waiting by the entrance with a young guy in work gear.


"Brinley, meet my cousin, Fenton Miller. He used to be a racing team technician, and he will help you train,"Jensen said, nodding toward the young man.



Fenton, looking barely out of his teens and a bit shy,gave a quick nod. "Nice to meet you,Brinley."



"Thanks for helping out," Brinley said with a warm smile.



Jensen clapped Fenton's shoulder. "Make sure she gets the hang of the car, and keep things smooth."



Then, leaning closer to Brinley, he lowered his voice."Rosara, I saw the stuff online. If you need backup,just say so."



Her heart warmed, and she nodded. "I'm good, don't worry." Sliding into the white car's driver's seat, Brinley took a deep breath.



This car was far less powerful than the red one, but that was the point-it screamed "beginner."


Fenton settled into the passenger seat, calmly guiding Brinley through the car's controls and features. "The brakes are a bit loose, so you'll want to ease into them before corners," he advised.



Brinley nodded, absorbing his words with focus,intentionally keeping her driving cautious to mimic a beginner's skill, even pausing slightly at turns


Fenton remained patient, offering soft corrections whenever she slipped up.


After a few laps, she started to settle in, gradually picking up speed and handling corners with smoother precision.



While nowhere near the expertise of Rosara, her performance was believable enough to avoid looking like a total rookie.



"You're getting the hang of it quick, Brinley," Fenton said with genuine admiration.



She flashed a smile, about to reply, wvhen a familiar black Maybach caught her eye at the track's entrance. Her pulse raced, fingers tightening on the wheel



Why was Austin here?



The Maybach's door swung open,and Austin stepped out,his sharp black suit clashing with the track's grimy,oil-soaked vibe yet somehow commanding every gaze.



He strode directly toward them, and Fenton quickly hopped out to greet him. "Mr. Moore," he said respectfully



Austin gave a brief nod, his eyes locking onto Brinley through the window with a subtle smirk. "It seems like you're coming along nicely."


Brinley stepped out of the car, brushing dust off her clothes with practiced nonchalance. "Hardly. I was just fumblingthroughsomepractice.Whatbringsyouhere?"



"I was nearby and figured I would swing by," Austin said, his gaze flicking to the white car. "This car doesn't really match you."



"I'm a beginner. A high-end car would be overkill,"Brinley replied.



He let out a soft laugh, not pressing the point, and turned to Fenton. "How is she doing?" "Brinley has got real skill and picks things up fast,"Fenton replied honestly.



Austin nodded, his eyes drifting back to Brinley."Want to take my car for a spin?"



She hesitated, glancing at the Maybach, and quickly waved it off. "No way, I'm not ready for fancy cars."


"Not the Maybach," Austin said, nodding toward a sleek silver-gray sports car parked at the entrance,clearly worth a small fortune. "That's my practice car.It has solid performance."
###Chapter 78 She'd Just Exposed Herself
Brinley's eyes lingered on the sleek sports car.temptation tugging at her heart.



Its raw power and precision far outclassed her current ride,and she knew it.



But sliding behind that wheel would mean exposing just how much skill she'd been hiding from Austin.


"I'll pass," she murmured at last, shaking her head "With how I drive now, handling something like that would only get dangerous."



Austin didn't argue. An easy smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. "Fair enough. Keep practicing -I'll be right here."



True to his word, he drifted toward the shade of a nearby awning, hands slipping into his pockets as he settled in to watch.



His calm gaze followed her car around the track,steady and unrelenting. That unwavering attention unsettled her, and more than once she nearly botched a turn. To mask it, she eased her speed, forcing herself to appear clumsy, an amateur testing her limits.



Even so, the weight of his eyes-sharp, probing,impossible to fool-made her chest tighten. Her pulse quickened every time she thought of it.



After an hour of circling the track under that scrutiny,she couldn't stand it anymore. Brinley swung the car to a stop in front of Austin and pushed open the door."I'm done. I just want to head back."


Austin inclined his head, unbothered. "Then I'll take you."



She quickly waved him off, forcing a casual tone. "No need. I can manage on my own..."



"Get in the car," Austin cut her off, his voice firm and final.



He swung open the Maybach's door and shot her a look. "You don't want tomorrow's headlines to read,'Rising Real Estate Star Brinley Moore Caught Sneaking Around the Racetrack at Night,' do you?"


Left with no choice, Brinley ducked inside and sank into the passenger seat.



The Maybach slid smoothly away from the track, the hush inside the cabin pressing against her ears. She kept her eyes on the blur of neon lights rushing past the window, her thoughts tangled and restless.



"You don't want me to see how you drive, do you?"Austin's sudden question sliced through the silence.



Her heart gave a nervous jolt. "That's not it," she insisted quickly. "I just... don't like being watched."


Austin let out a low laugh, not bothering to argue.Steering effortlessly, he veered onto a narrow,deserted road.



Brinley frowned, confusion creeping in. "This isn't the way back to Hillcrest Villa."



"I know." His mouth curved faintly as he kept his eyes on the road. "I'm taking you somewhere else."



Half an hour later, the car rolled to a stop outside a warehouse.



Austin stepped out,pushed open the heavy door,and revealed a compact racing simulator room gleaming inside.



Brinley's eyes widened at the unexpected sight."What is this place?"



"A little spot I use for practice," Austin said,casually lifting two helmets and offering one to her. "Want to  try it out?"



Her pulse quickened as she took in the setup. She knew how advanced these simulators were-down to the subtle grip of the tires and the roar of the engine,they mirrored the real track almost flawlessly



"What's the matter? Feeling nervous?" Austin pressed,one brow raised, his voice tinged with a teasing challenge.



That spark of competitiveness in her ignited. She snatched the helmet from his hand, fastening the strap with determination. "Afraid? Not a chance.Let's see what you've got."



Sliding into their seats, the two pulled on their headphones. A moment later, the massive screen in front of them came alive, projecting the curves and straightaways of a very familiar course-none other than the track where the upcoming exhibition race would be held.



"The rules are simple. Three laps is all it takes. The one who finishes in less time gets the victory."Austin's voice came through Brinley's headphones.



"That's fine by me!" Brinley replied, her fingers tightening around the wheel as she drew in a steadying breath.



The sharp crack of the virtual starter's pistol sent both posed cars rocketing forward.



At first, Brinley deliberately held back, keeping her pace clumsy, the picture of a cautious novice.



But as Austin's car pulled farther ahead, her pride burned hotter than her restraint.



She stomped the accelerator, body jolting with the surge as she steered with sharp, precise turns. Her car darted through the track with effortless agility, cutting corners tighter and gaining speed with every lap.


All the skills she had tried so hard to bury spilled out in a rush, her instincts seizing the wheel.



When her car shot across the finish line, realization slammed into her.



Damn it. She'd just exposed herself.



She yanked off her helmet, chest heaving as she sucked in air, her gaze snapping toward Austin.



He slid his own helmet free, an amused glint in his eyes. "Well now, my dear, you're far from the clumsy driver you claimed to be-you're actually quite skilled."



Brinley's pulse hammered in her throat.



She realized her flawless performance had betrayed too much, and Austin's suspicions about her had only  deepened.



"I..." Words caught on her tongue, leaving her stranded in silence.



Austin didn't push, instead allowing a sly smile to tug at his lips. "That exhibition race should be quite the spectacle."



Liftinghimself from the chair, he crossed to the window and fixed his gaze on the star-scattered night."I've always been curious about what prompted you to sign up for it so suddenly."


Brinley hesitated, then drifted to his side, her voice quiet but steady. "I just wanted to push myself."



"Is that really it?" Austin turned, eyes piercing straight into hers. "Funny-I remember you once claimed it was nothing more than a hobby."



She lifted her chin, trying to mask the heat rising to her cheeks. "So what? What's wrong with me pursuing my hobby and participating in an exhibition race?"



Austin's mouth curved in silence, his gaze shifting back to the night.



His fingers idly drummed the window frame, though the faint gleam of curiosity in his eyes betrayed his thoughts. What else was Brinley hiding behind that calm facade?


Her driving style echoed the mysterious Rosara in too many ways, yet her nervousness didn't feel staged.



The two of them fell silent, and the air between them thickened, filled with a quiet, unspoken tension.
###Chapter 79 Sabotage



By the time Brinley and Austin returned to Hillcrest Villa, the clock had already inched toward ten.



The butler spotted them at once and stepped forward with practiced deference. "Mr. Moore, Mrs. Moore,dinner has been prepared. Shall I warm it up for you now?"



Austin shook his head lightly. "No need. We already ate out."



"Very well," the butler murmured, bowing slightly before retreating down the hall.


Inside the quiet living room, Brinley started toward the stairs, but Austin's voice stopped her. "Hold on a second."



With a glance in his direction, she queried,there something else?"



Closing the distance between them, Austin drew a small velvet box from his pocket and offered it to her."This is for you."



Brinley accepted it, curiosity flickering in her eyes.When she lifted the lid, a delicate brooch gleamed  inside-shaped like a rose, its clean, elegant lines catching the light with understated beauty.



"This is..." Her voice trailed off, caught between surprise and wonder.



Austin's smile softened as he said, "Think of it as a good-luck charm for your exhibition race. I hope you crush it out there."



A swell of emotion stirred in Brinley as she cradled the brooch in her palm.



She lifted her gaze to him, her voice low. "What is it that you really want to know?"


His eyes lingered on her, layered with unreadable depth. "I just want to get to know the real you."


Her chest tightened, her pulse stumbling


She parted her lips, but the words refused to form.


Rather than pressing her, Austin curved his mouth into a quiet smile. "Get some rest."



As his footsteps faded, Brinley curled her fingers tightly around the delicate rose-shaped brooch.



The weight of it pressed into her palm, a reminder that his suspicions were sharpening-and she would have to tread even more carefully As the countdown hit its last week before the exhibition race, Brinley spent nearly every day at the racetrack on the city's edge.



To keep up her "novice" façade, she stuck to the white car and deliberately kept her cornering speeds steady and tame.



Yet the more she held herself back, the harder it became to bury the wild streak that belonged to Rosara.



Every glance at the glowing numbers on the timing board tugged at he hands, whispering to push harder,faster.



Later that afternoon, as she zipped up her racing suit,Jensen strode over. "Rosara, Fenton's tied up with some family matters today and can't make it. I've arranged for Bowman to step in. He's been around nearly ten years-knows this place better than anyone."



Brinley followed Jensen's line of sight to a man in the corner. The middle-aged mechanic, clad in a gray work uniform, was polishing a wrench with deliberate strokes.



At the sound of his name, he lifted his head and offered a courteous smile. "Nice to meet you, Mrs. Moore. I am Bowman Alvarez. Don't worry, I'll make sure you're in good hands."



A ripple of unease ran through Brinley



Something about Bowman didn't sit right-the glint in his eyes clashed with the easy facade of a veteran trackhand.



Still, Jensen was trustworthy, and she forced down her misgivings with a curt nod. "Thanks."



The white car eased onto the blistering track,sunlight glaring across its hood.



She tapped the brake out of habit, only to find the pedal stiffer than yesterday, as though a thin cushion had been wedged beneath her foot.



Her brows knit together. Turning the wheel, she noticed the steering lagged by half a beat,sluggish and muffled, as if cotton had been crammed into the column.



Pressing the walkie-talkie,she asked evenly, "Bowman,did you set the car up wrong?"



Bowman's voice came through the walkie, laced with static. "Mrs. Moore, you're stressing over nothing. We ran the checks this morning-brake fluid and steering system are fine. Maybe you're just a little rusty?" Brinley let the matter drop. Cars at the track were handled by countless drivers all year, and unexpected issues surfaced from time to time.



She drew in a steadying breath, pressed the accelerator, and the white car leapt smoothly down the straight.



The first two laps passed without incident.



She kept her speed reined in, concentrating on compensating for each flaw she felt.


The brakes resisted, so she tapped them half a second earlier.



The steering dragged, so she angled her turns ahead of time.



By the third lap, however, the glitches worsened.



As she fought through the string of S-curves, the wheel suddenly locked mid-turn, then snapped loose,spinning a half rotation too far when she tried to correct.



Brinley frowned, clutching the wheel so hard her knuckles whitened. The tires shrieked in protest as the car skimmed past the guardrail by inches.



A cold sheen of sweat broke across her forehead- this was far more than some minor issues



"Bowman,check the steering system right now!" she barked into the walkie-talkie.



The reply was nothing but a harsh crackle of static.



A sharp flutter rattled Brinley's chest. The situation reeked of imminent danger



She slammed her foot on the brake, trying to angle the car toward the pit lane, but the pedal felt fused to the floor.



It pressed down barely an inch before locking solid.



The needle on the speedometer climbed past seventy,and up ahead, the sharpest hairpin on the circuit came rushing closer like a looming threat.



Sweat seeped through her racing suit, clinging hot against her skin.



A vise-like tightness squeezed her chest, but her thoughts cut razor-sharp.



This wasn't a breakdown-it was cold, calculated sabotage!



She flicked her gaze to the rearview mirror. The straightaway stretched empty behind her; there was no one to call, no time left. Ahead, the hairpin's guardrail loomed larger by the heartbeat, sunlight bouncing off the metal in a blinding glare.



Brinley flicked on the hazard lights and yanked the handbrake.



For any racer, that desperate move marked the final resort when brakes failed.



The car whipped sideways, tires shrieking, acrid smoke curling up from the asphalt.



Harnessing the wild momentum, she fought the slide,forcing the nose toward the runoff zone carved inside the bend.



That stretch was lined with thick rubber mats-the last buffer meant to catch machines out of control.



But just as her front bumper veered toward safety,the steering wheel froze stiff in her hands.
###Chapter 80 Accident



Brinley's eyes widened in horror as the car's nose dashed straight toward the guardrail, with only five meters left before the inevitable crash.



In a desperate instant, she released the handbrake and kicked hard at the lock of the passenger-side door.



The sleeve of her fireproof racing suit snagged against the steering wheel and tore,her arm scraping along the edge of the metal trim, leaving behind a hot,stinging pain.


She couldn't think about it now. In the fleeting seconds before the car spun completely out of control, her hand darted beneath the dashboard,searching frantically until her fingers hit the small hidden switch beneath the carpet.



It was a secret failsafe Jensen had installed for emergencies like this.



With a heavy bang, the passenger door blew open,and a violent rush of air slammed into the car.



Brinley clung to the wheel with her left hand while her right latched onto the door frame. Using the vehicle's momentum,she threw her body toward the passenger seat.



The moment she left the driver's seat, the front of the car collided brutally with the guardrail.



The impact blurred her vision. Her shoulder crashed against the frame, and the force nearly stole every bit of breath from her lungs.



Through sheer grit, she grabbed the wheel again,forced her body back into the driver's seat, and at the same time slammed down the engine kill switch.



The unbearable screech of metal grinding against metal cut off at once.



The white car lurched to a crooked stop at the edge of the safety zone, its front crushed and twisted,fragments of debris scattered across the ground.



Brinley collapsed against the wheel, gasping raggedly,her body trembling uncontrollably from the shock.



"Brinley!" a voice bellowed in panic from behind.



She snapped her head around and saw Austin sprinting toward her from his black Maybach.



His suit jacket hung open, his tie was skewed, and his usual composed demeanor was gone. His expression was raw and frantic, one she had never seen on him before. He reached the driver's side and flung open the distorted door, his eyes darkening at the sight of her sweat-soaked figure and the blood streaking her arm."Where are you hurt? How bad is it?"



Brinley tried to answer, but before she could, Austin scooped her up into his arms.



His hold was firm and urgent in a way that rattled her.



She struggled weakly against him. "Don't move,"Austin ordered, holding her tighter. "I'm getting you to a hospital."



"I'm fine... just scratches, bruises..." Brinley protested in a weak voice.



Ignoring her words, he carried her toward the Maybach.


As they passed the wrecked white car, he glanced coldly at the mangled front and scattered pieces. A deep scowl creased his forehead.



"Who was responsible for inspecting this vehicle?" he asked in a cold, stern voice.



No one in the pit lane answered.



Brinley glanced around. Bowman was nowhere to be seen. Jensen stood there, pale as chalk, a walkie-talkie clutched tightly in his hands. Once the Maybach pulled smoothly away from the track, the shock fully hit Brinley



For a moment back there, she had thought she would never make it out of the track alive



Her arm throbbed fiercely, grounding her in the grim reality of just how close she had comne.



Austin pulled the car over to the side of the road and retrieved a first-aid kit from the back.



His movements were rushed, even clumsy, yet when his fingers touched her wound, they were astonishingly gentle.



Brinley groaned as the antiseptic burned across her raw skin.



Austin froze, his hand stilling as his eyes met hers.



The dread lingered on his face, his Adam's apple moving as he swallowed hard. "Does it hurt badly?"



"Not too much." Brinley turned her face away, unable to meet his intense eyes.



In that split second of desperation, she had fallen back on Rosara's self-rescue moves without even thinking.Would he.



"Why didn't you just aim for the safety zone?" Austin asked in a low voice, breaking the silence.your speed, you'd have walked away with a scratch. Why risk everything like that?"



Brinley's heart pounded.



What? He saw the way she lunged toward the passenger seat?



She clenched the fabric of her clothes, scrambling for an excuse. But Austin didn't give her time. "When you shifted to the passenger side, your left hand was still adjusting the steering wheel's angle. That's not something a casual driver does; that's the instinct of a professional racer. Brinley, what are you not..."



"I... I learned!" Brinley blurted out, cutting him off,her voice trembling. "I picked up emergency techniques from friends before. Just theory. I never thoughtI'd actually use it."



Even to her own ears, the words sounded flimsy.



Could someone with only theory really react so precisely in a split-second life-or-death moment?


Austin didn't argue further. His focus returned to her arm, carefully wrapping it in layers of whie gauze.


The silence inside the car was stifling,broken only by the sound of their breathing. The tension congealed the air so much that it felt suffocating After a long pause, Austin spoke again, his voice weary this time. "Was this Milly's doing?"



Brinley's eyes snapped to him in shock. How did he know?



A cold smile slit Austin's lips. "She thought her bribery of a technician would go undetected. What she didn't realize is that Moore Group recently acquired the racetrack's surveillance system."



He paused, then stared deeply into her eyes. "Brinley,how much longer are you going to keep things from me? I don't understand why you insisted on racing,but now this sabotage is endangering your life. Can't you just be honest with me?"
###Chapter 81| Will Always Care For You

Brinley stared back into Austin's deep eyes, a lump forming in her throat.



The secrets she carried felt like storm clouds crowding her chest, making it hard even to breathe.



She wanted to explain, but where could she begin?



How could she possibly tell him she was Rosara? How could she reveal that her so-called daring self-rescue moves weren't improvisation at all, but instincts etched into her bones long ago?



"I..." Brinley's voice broke as she fiddled nervously with the hem of her racing suit, her fingertips twisting at the fabric. "There are things I can't say yet."



Austin studied her face for several seconds, and in the end,he chose not to push.



Rubbing his brow, he put the emergency kit back in the trunk, then slid into the driver's seat. Starting the car, he said softly, "Let's get your arm properly treated first at the hospital. We'll talk about the rest later."



The car drove straight to a private hospital that  belonged to the Moore Group.


The moment the medical staff spotted Austin's Maybach,they hurried forward with a wheelchair ready.



Brinley had stayed here once before when Austin had been admitted with stomach bleeding.



As she stepped inside again, the tang of disinfectant hit her, bringing with it a strange, almost familiar feeling.



The nurse guided them into the exam room, where the doctor cleaned and dressed her wound again. Austin stood by the window, upright as always, but his body was tense, coiled with unease.



"It's a surface wound, nothing serious, no damage to the bone. You're lucky," the doctor said,a lingering concern in his voice as he pulled off his gloves. "If it had gone just a bit deeper, your arm would have needed dozens of stitches."



"Thank you," Brinley muttered faintly, her eyes inevitably drifting toward Austin.



His profile was sharp under the sterile hospital lights.He was typing into his phone, his jaw clenched,and even without words she could sense the anger surging inside of him.



When the treatment was over, Austin didn't let her go home. He led her straight to a ward.


Unlike a typical hospital room, it felt more like a refined hotel suite.



The balcony was arranged with the same greenery and fresh flowers she had seen during her last visit,and even the lamp on the bedside table was the same design she remembered from the last time.



"Stay here tonight," Austin told her as he pulled a chair to sit by her bed. "I've already asked the butler to bring over your clothes."


"That's too much trouble already," Brinley protested,trying to sit up, but Austin gently pressed her shoulder back against the bed.


He said in a firm but tender voice, "Please stay here.We haven't figured out what happened this afternoon.I can't relax until we do."



The memory of the accident made Brinley hold back any further arguments.



Her eyes fell to the bandage around her arm,then snapped up suddenly as a thought struck her. "What about Jensen? Will he be blamed?"



"I've already had MMiguel take him to the police to give his statement," Austin said, passing her a glass of warm water from the bedside table. "Bowman, on the other  hand,ran. But surveillance caught him meeting with Milly."


He paused for a moment, and when he spoke again,his voice was colder. "Focus on recovering. Leave everything else to me."


Brinley accepted the glass, feeling the warmth seep into her palms and spread quietly into her chest.


She knew exactly what Austin meant by "leave everything else to me." He was a man who never spoke empty words.


Yet the weariness shadowing his eyes made her heart twist with guilt.


"Actually..." She hesitated. "Milly's after me. You don't have to..."



"Brinley." Austin cut her off, a faint, mocking smirk on his lips. "She laid a trap for someone under my protection and thinks she can walk away without consequence? You're my wife. I will always care for you and protect you."



The bluntness of his words made Brinley's heart jolt



Just then, a knock sounded at the door



Miguel entered, a folder in hand. "Mr. Moore,we've uncovered something." He passed the documents over and explained,"Yesterday, Bowman's account received a transfer of fifty thousand from a shell company tied to Milly. We also discovered she's been approaching several pit crew members, repeatedly asking about Mrs. Moore's training schedule."


Austin frowned as he flipped through the folder.



Reaching the final page, he let out a cold laugh."She really pulled out all the stops."


Brinley leaned over to take a look and saw a detailed account of Milly's recent activities.



Not only had Milly bribed Bowman, but she'd also been plotting to smear Brinley on race day with fabricated claims of rule violations.



Brinley was visibly furious. "Damn it! She's trying to orchestrate my downfall all because of that scumbag Colin."



Brinley's jab at Colin seemed to amuse Austin; his lips twitched with a faint smile before he quickly masked it.



Snapping the folder shut, he handed it back to Miguel and instructed casually. "Sort this out and send it anonymously to Kashton." Miguel hesitated, then nodded when he finally understood.At once, he left the room with the file.



Brinley scowled, puzzled. "Why send it to him?"


Kashton Palmer, Colin's grandfather, had always indulged him. Even if he found out what Milly had done, at most he'd probably just give her a token reprimand.



Austin chuckled, pouring more warm water into her glass. "He cares about reputation more than anything -especially the Palmer family's. Milly pulling shady tricks exploiting Colin's connections won't sit wvell with him."



He set the glass back on the table and added,"Besides, the Palmer family is bidding for land in the east of the city. Kashton is eager to establish his authority at the board meeting. With Milly stirring up trouble,tell me-how do you think he'll deal with her?"
###Chapter 82 | Won't Let Anyone Lay A Finger On Y...
Brinley finally understood what Austin was doing-he wasn't going to confront Milly outright. Instead,he planned to make someone else push her into paying for her own schemes.



The strategy carried a ruthless elegance, but Brinley found it far more satisfying than any direct clash.



"You're really cunning," she murmured under her breath.



Catching her faint smile, Austin's gaze softened, the frost in his eyes thawing. "If I'm not cunning enough,how can I protect you?"



Heat rushed to her cheeks at the weight of his words,and she quickly turned away, feigning interest in the night lights spilling through the window.



The silence stretched, boken only by the steady tick of the wall clock.



Yet Brinley could feel Austin's eyes lingering on her,his attention sharp and unwavering.



Her mind drifted back to those early days, when she  had eyed him with suspicion-believing their whirlwwind marriage was a calculated move, and his affection a complete facade.



Her doubts began to falter as she watched him care for her, even willing to challenge the Palmer family head-on.



He remembered her small preferences and cooked meals just for her. Earlier, when he saw her injured,he had pulled her into his arms anxiously.



Those gestures, like a slow-steeped infusion of warmth,seeped quietly into her heart.


She realized that his care for her was real.



"What's on your mind?" Austin's voice broke through the silence.



Startled, Brinley looked up into his eyes and mumbled,a bit flustered, "Nothing, just... thanks."


Tilting his head slightly, he raised a brow and asked,"Only thanks?"


Her lips curved into a faint smirk as she shot back."What more are you expecting?"


A quiet laugh slipped from him as he rose, moving to her bedside. He leaned down, close enough for his breath to stir across her forehead. "When you're  better,how about you buy me dinner?"



The closeness of his presence sent her pulse into a stumble, her heart tripping over itself.



The urge to retreat flickered through her, halted by the tender weight of his hand at her neck.



"Don't move." His voice was low and rough-edged,carrying a quiet command. "Let me see your wound."



His eyes dropped to the bandage on her arm,fingertips grazing its edge with painstaking care, each movement as if he were handling something impossibly fragile.



A warm ache unfurled in her chest, a softness she hadn't expected.



"It really doesn't hurt anymore," she murmured, her tone carrying an unintentional dependence.



Austin rose and smoothed the blanket around her shoulders. "If you're tired, close your eyes. I'll stay and keep watch."



Her body, still tense from the earlier fright and drained from the storm of emotions, yielded to exhaustion.


She gave a small nod and let her eyes close, though sleep clung stubbornly out of reach. The faint rustle of papers and the occasional baritone murmur of Austin handling business calls threaded through the quiet.



Even in that clipped, decisive tone, his voice carried a steadiness that soothed her.



Time slipped away unnoticed, until at last, drowsiness overtook her and she drifted into sleep.



When Brinley woke again, the sky beyond the window had already deepened into full night.



Only the bedside lamp glowed softly, casting a warm halo over Austin, who had dozed off in a chair beside her.



It looked as though he feared disturbing her, never daring to climb into the bed. His body remained in that stiff position, his brow faintly furrowed as though some restless thought refused to let him go.



The dark circles under his eyes made Brinley's chest ache.



She knew how heavy his days had been-juggling company afairs while still worrying over her.



Quietly, she shifted, meaning to drape something over his shoulders. Yet th e moment her hand reached toward him,his lashes fluttered and he stirred. "You're awake." His voice carried the gravel of sleep as he rubbed his eyes. "Do you want some water?"



Brinley gave a small shake of her head. "You should lie down on the sofa. You'll hurt your back sitting like this."



"I'm fine. I'm not sleepy anymore." Rising, Austin poured her a glass of warm water with steady hands."What about you? Hungry at all?"


Brinley's stomach did give a small protest, so she nodded in agreement.



Austin wasted no time and called for the nurse.



A few minutes later, the nurse wheeled in a cart carrying a steaming bowl of porridge with a few light side dishes. The warm, simple aroma filled the quiet room.



Austin took the bowl himself, carefully feeding Brinley spoon by spoon. As he watched her eat with clear appetite, a trace of relief softened his expression.



Tidying up the dishes afterward, he remarked, "Miguel just sent word. The Palmer family's been stirred up-Kashton called Colin back and scolded him."



"That's all?" Brinley blinked, surprised by how light the punishment was. Austin let out a quiet laugh. "That's only the opening move. Kashton values financial gain above all else.What Milly has done not only brings shame to Colin and the Palmers, but it also jeopardizes their land bid in the eastern district. He won't simply brush this off."


Austin lingered for a moment before speaking again."By the way, I had Miguel dig into that project Milly helped Colin land. Seems the entire deal is messy with irregularities. I've already had the evidence delivered anonymously to the authorities. It's only a matter of time before they're dragged under."



Only then did Brinley understand-Austin had orchestrated everything right from the very beginning.He moved quietly, yet each strike wvas sharper than the last,leaving Milly with nowhere to turn.



"You..." Brinley stared at him, struggling to form a response.



She had never imagined he would go to such lengths for her.



Catching her thoughts, Austin crossed to her bedside,settled down, and wrapped his fingers gently around her uninjured hand. "Don't let it weigh on you. People like that don't deserve mercy. And besides-this isn't just for you. It's for me."



"For you?" Brinley blinked, confused. "Yeah." His nod was firm, his gaze unwavering. "You are my wife. I won't let anyone lay a finger on you."
###Chapter 83 Since When Do You Have Back Problems
With words that balanced firmness and tendernesS,Austin left Brinley blushing furiously, her heartbeat unsteady.



She tried to slip her hand away, but his grasp only tightened.


"Austin..." Her voice wavered,betraying her fluster.



He didn't answer, only looked at her with a gaze layered in complicated,unspoken emotions.



The warmth of his palm against hers sent her heartbeat racing in bewilderment.



Just then, her phone buzzed, slicing through the charged silence.



Jensen's name lit the screen.



"Brinley, are you okay?" His voice came through, thick with guilt. "This is on me. I never should've let Bowman get near you..."



"It's not your fault. I just wasn't careful enough."Brinley rushed to reassure him, her voice soft but firm.  "How are things on your side? Miguel didn't give you any trouble, did he?"



Jensen let out a small laugh, relief lacing his words."Not at all. Miguel was surprisingly helpful-he actually cleared things up for me. Oh, and Brinley,your car..."


"The car isn't important. What matters is that I'm alright." Her reply was quick, almost cutting him off."Don't worry about me. I'll get in touch once I'm discharged."


After ending the call, she lowered the phone toward the bedside table. Before it landed, Austin's words shattered the stillness. "I'm staying with you tonight."



Her hand froze mid-air. Snapping her head up, Brinley stared at him wide-eyed. "What did you just say?"


Austin's tone held a calm certainty, as though stating a fact no one could contest. "I said I'm staying here tonight. With your arm like this, you'll need someone to help you with water, the bathroom, everything."



Brinley's reaction was instant. "That's not necessary!"she blurted,instinctively scooting deeper into the bed."There are nurses around, and I can take care of myself."



The idea unsettled her. Even if the mattress looked wide enough, the thought of squeezing two people onto it felt unthinkably awkward. But Austin seemed deaf to her protests. He strode to the wardrobe, pulled out a neatly folded set of pajamas, and held them up as proof.


Obviously, he'd laid the plans well ahead of time.


"See? I even brought clothes." His eyes carried a steel -edged resolve as he waved the pajamas. "Don't fight me on this. You're injured. So for once, just listen."



Brinley's voice sharpened with unease as she tried to push herself upright. "Austin! This is a hospital, not our home.You can't just..."



"Can't just what?" He arched a brow and leaned closer,his face hovering near hers with deliberate provocation. "When I was in the hospital, you stayed by my side, didn't you? So why are you tryingto push me away when you need assistance?"



Her cheeks heated, words tumbling out in protest."That's not the same at all! Back then, you insisted that you needed me around twenty-four seven,andI got dragged into it against my will!"



Austin drew out his reply, eyes gleaming with playful mischief. "Well, I have to say, you took excellent care of me. Now it's my turn to return the favor."



Brinley was at a loss for words. She turned her head away,avoiding his gaze, and finally hissed,"No matter  what, you're not sharing a bed with me. If you want to rest, take the sofa."



Yet Austin acted as if the sofa didn't exist. He settled onto the edge of her bed instead, slowly working open the buttons on his shirt cuffs. "That thing's too soft. My back won't survive it."


Brinley blurted out, staring at him in disbelief,"Since when do you have back problems?"



She remembered him at the gym not long ago,casually lifting weights heavier than the trainer's,without the slightest sign of strain.



Austin tilted his head up, a crooked smirk tugging at his lips."Maybe I twisted it when I rushed over to save you this afternoon."



The mix of truth and exaggeration slipped neatly into her heart.



The memory of his frantic dash earlier left her throat tight, the words of refusal stuck fast.


There was no way she was going to let him strain his back any further on her account.


Catching her hesitation, Austin pressed in smoothly "Just one night. Sleep without worry, and I swear l won't lay a hand on you." His tone was steady, his eyes carrying a disarming sincerity, leaving her momentarily stripped of arguments.



With reluctant resolve, Brinley shifted deeper into the bed, carving out space for him. Her voice dropped to a fragile whisper. "You'd better keep that promise."



"Deal," he answered at once, though a flicker of smug satisfaction glinted in his eyes.



After slipping into his pajamas,he eased himself down beside her.



This hospital bed was wider than the standard ones-enough to leave a fist's breadth of space between them.



Even so, Brinley couldn't shake the tension winding through her chest.



Every breath carried Austin's faint shampoo scent, his steady rhythm of breathing brushing against her ears,his warmth radiating across that narrow divide.



Each subtle trace of him teased her senses like feathers trailing over bare skin, stirring her restless heart and making sleep impossible.



Tense from head to toe, she dared not move, fearing the slightest turn would touch him. Time blurred into an anxious haze before Austin shifted without warning.



Brinley's pulse kicked up, and she held still, barely allowing herself to breathe.



A moment later, she felt him shift closer, his warmth closing in, his breath fanning against her skin.



"What are you doing?" Her voice came out tight.


"Nothing," Austin murmured, his tone heavy with drowsy ease. "The bed shook a little-I thought you might roll off."



"This bed is solid. I'm not about to tumble out," she countered,almost scoffing at his flimsy excuse.



"But what if you did?" Austin's voice lost its laziness,turning solemn. "Your arm's injured. If you fall, you could seriously hurt it again. Staying close means I can keep you safe."
###Chapter 84 Slept In His Embrace
While Austin spoke, he edged closer to Brinley, their shoulders brushing faintly together.



Brinley was speechless, caught off guard by his shameless reasoning, and scooted farther away to put some distance between them.



She asked with a huff, "This bed is huge. Why do you have to squeeze in next to me?"



"I'm not squeezing you," Austin replied with mock innocence."The bed's just too small."



Brinley nearly choked. Too small? This bed was much wider than a standard hospital bed. He had to be joking, claiming it was too small.


At that moment, she finally realized he was doing it deliberately.



She inhaled deeply, deciding the best response was to ignore him. Closing her eyes, she feigned sleep,convinced that if she didn't engage, he would eventually give up.



But Austin clearly wasn't going to let her off that  easily


Moments later, she felt the faint tug of fingers brushing her hair.



"Quit it," Brinley muttered without opening her eyes.



"It's not my fault," Austin replied with a quiet laugh. "It was your hair that brushed against me."



Brinley lost her patience.



Her eyes flew open, and she turned to glare at him."Austin! What exactly are you trying to do?"


In the dim light, his eyes glowed like stars against the night,bright and persistent.



He stared at her and, to her frustration, chuckled softly. "Well, I just want to be closer to you."



His voice was gentle, tinged with something honest and tender. The sound slipped into her heart like a feather on still water, stirring ripples she couldn't suppress.



Brinley's heart skidded, her cheeks turning warm at once.



His bluntness left her flustered, and she instinctively turned her head away. "You're unbelievable." She acted irritated, but inside she felt giddy and flustered.



Austin didn't press further. He simply watched her in silence.



The room grew quiet again, broken only by the whistle of the wind outside.


Yet Brinley could still feel his deep, intense eyes drilling into her.



Her chest thudded, her cheeks flushed, and her breaths grew shallow.



She didn't understand what was wrong with her. She should have been mad at him, but she couldn't seem to bring herself to. Instead, there was an undercurrent of nervous excitement she couldn't deny.



Just as her mind wrestled with conflicting emotions,Austin reached out and gently clasped her uninjured hand.



His palm was warm, his grip steady, carrying a strength that felt protective.



Brinley reacted instinctively, trying to pull away as though burned, but Austin only held tighter



"Don't move," he said softly, his voice low but firm. "Just let me hold it a while."



His fingertips brushed lightly against the back of her hand, his touch careful, reverent, as though she were something sacred.



Brinley's heartbeat instantly stumbled out of sync,and for a moment, she completely forgot to breathe.


Their closeness magnified everything-the sound of their breathing, the thrum of their heartbeats.



Brinley opened her mouth, wanting to speak, but her throat tightened, and no words came out.



In the end, she let Austin hold her hand, letting the warmth of his palm seep into her skin.



Time blurred. Her eyelids grew heavy, her thoughts hazy, until at last sleep pulled her under.



Just as she drifted away, she thought she heard Austin whisper something in her ear.


His voice was faint and dreamlike, the words indistinguishable, but it wrapped her in a sense of safety.


That night, Brinley slept better than she had in a long time. No nightmares, no sudden awakenings-just the rhythm of Austin's breathing beside her, comforting as a lullaby. When she woke the following morning, the sunlight was already pouring in.



Golden beams slipped through the curtain gaps,scattering warm patterns across the floor.


As Brinley stirred, she realized she was nestled in Austin's arms.



Her head rested squarely against his chest, where his heartbeat thumped strong and steady.



One of his arms was wrapped securely around her waist,holding her close as though guarding something precious.



Brinley's face flamed crimson when she realized this.She had actually-unbelievably-slept in his embrace the entire night.



How had she ended up tangled with him like this?


She had been angry with him last night, so how had she surrendered to this closeness in her sleep?


Her thoughts spun in a chaotic blur, and she instinctively tried to shove him off before he woke up.



But her movement stirred him awake.



Austin's eyes opened slowly, an amused look on his still-drowsy face as he found her so close. He said in  a voice still rough with sleep, "Good morning."


His breath fanned across her forehead, intimate and warm,and her cheeks flared hotter still.


"Austin! Let go of me!" Brinley squirmed, trying to wriggle free.



But Austin only tightened his hold, keeping her firmly against him.



"Stay still," he muttered, his eyes glinting with playful warmth. "Just let me hold you a little longer."



Brinley sputtered, equal parts shy and furious, "No way!Let go!"



Austin shot back without hesitation, "We're married.Sleeping in each other's arms is perfectly normal."


Brinley was once again struck silent, unable to counter his logic. She shoved at him with her uninjured hand, but he didn't budge. If anything, he pulled her tighter.



"Austin!" Brinley glared at him, her face burning with exasperation. "If you don't let go, I'll pinch you hard."


"You won't." Austin smirked, leaning in closer until their noses nearly brushed.
###Chapter 85 Was She Actually Beginning To Ca t...

Brinley was so stunned by Austin's shamelessness that her cheeks burned a vivid red.



She snapped her head to the side to avoid his intense gaze, blurting out in a flustered voice, "Austin, you are such a tease!"



At that, Austin chuckled, the vibration of his laugh traveling from his chest into the narrow space between them, rippling through her like a current she couldn't escape.



"We're legally married. A little closeness is nothing unusual," he said, his tone light.


"Enough!" Brinley reached up quickly to cover his mouth,but Austin caught her wrist mid-air.



His palm was warm and firm, the grip not forceful,yet enough that she couldn't break free.



They were so close that Brinley could catch his clean,refreshing scent and even notice the subtle rise and fall of his Adam's apple



Her pulse hammered in her chest, erratic and  overwhelming,making it almost impossible to breathe.


Turning her face away, she whispered with a voice barely audible, "Let go... What if someone comes in?"


"What's there to be afraid of?" Austin leaned closer,his lips brushing near her ear as he laughed softly."We're not doing anything inappropriate, are we?"



The warm brush of his breath sent a jolt through her,her body going rigid.



She shoved against him with sudden force, finally breaking free of his embrace, retreating to the edge of the bed like a cornered animal, and glaring at him with caution.



Austin watched her, amused at her overreaction,but he didn't push her further. Instead, he sat up casually.



"Alright, I'll stop teasing you," he said, reaching out to ruffle her hair in a gesture that felt both natural and disarmingly gentle. "You should get ready. The doctor will be by for rounds soon."



The sudden tenderness caught her off guard, leaving her stunned for a beat. When she came back to herself, her cheeks heated again.



Awkwardly, she swatted his hand away, tossed the blanket aside, and rushed into the bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she leaned against it,covering her flushed cheeks with both hands, her heart still pounding wildly.



The closeness they had shared, the smile in his eyes,the seriousness in his voice-it all lingered in her mind like an imprint she couldn't shake



Taking a deep breath, she turned on the faucet and splashed cold water over her face, desperate to calm down.



But when she looked up at the mirror, her reflection betrayed her-rosy cheeks, a flustered expression,nothing like the composed and decisive professional she was known to be.



She stared at herself in the mirror, and for a moment,an unexpected wave of uncertainty swept over her.



What exactly was her relationship with Austin?


Was it still just an arranged marriage, or... were they slowly becoming a real couple?



Was she actually beginning to catch feelings for him?


By the time she stepped back into the room, Austin was already dressed, lounging on the couch with a document in hand. The morning sun streamed through the window,outlining his tall figure in light, accentuating the strong lines of his face.



His focused expression gave him a unique charm.



When he heard the sound of her emerging, he raised his head, his eyes settling on Brinley as a faint smile tugged at his lips. "Finished?"



"Yeah," Brinley answered stiffly, moving to sit back down on the bed.



Moments later, a knock came at the door.



A nurse pushed in a cart. "Good morning,Mr. Moore,Mrs. Moore. If today's final check goes well, the doctor says you can be discharged, Mrs. Moore."


"That's good to hear. Thank you." Austin got up immediately, taking the cart from the nurse. She gave a polite nod and slipped out, leaving the room to them.


The moment the door clicked shut, the atmosphere tensed up again.


Austin rolled the cart closer to the bedside table."Enjoy your breakfast. It's all the things you like."



Brinley looked at the carefully prepared breakfast,and a warm feeling bloomed in her chest. He always remembered her preferences, even down to something as simple as breakfast.



She picked up the spoon and ate slowly.


Austin didn't disturb her. He sat nearby,watching her quietly,occasionally offering a tissue or pouring her a glass of water, his gestures considerate.


After breakfast, the doctor arrived for his rounds.


The examination confirmed Brinley's wound was healing well,with no sign of infection. She was cleared to leave.



Brinley let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding.



Hospitals made her restless, and sharing a room with Austin only heightened her unease.



Austin stepped out to take care of the discharge paperwork while Brinley gathered her belongings in the room.



The butler had only sent over a few changes of clothes, so it didn't take her long to finish



By then, Austin was already back.



"Let's go." He picked up her bag and naturally reached for her uninjured hand. Brinley instinctively tried to pull away,but his grip only tightened.



"Don't struggle. There are plenty of people outside.If any reporters see you injured, it'll just stir up ridiculous stories," he said in a voice that was low but imposing.



Brinley paused. He wasn't wrong. The online uproar about her hadn't died down yet. If anyone saw her bandaged arm, who knew what wild rumors might spread?



Reluctantly, she allowed him to hold her hand, letting him lead her out of the hospital room.
###Chapter 86 Nightblade Was Unbeatable In His Prime
Miguel pulled up just as Austin and Brinley stepped out of the hospital.



Parked at the entrance, the black Maybach's sleek lines spoke of understated class.



When Miguel climbed out to open the rear door, his gaze snagged on their linked hands. A flicker of surprise passed across his eyes before he quickly masked it. "Good morning,Mr.Moore, Mrs. Moore," he said smoothly.



Austin gave a curt nod and guided Brinley inside.



Once they settled into the leather seats, Brinley's brow furrowed with a sudden thought.



She murmured, "What about my car..."



"It's been towed and sent for repairs," Austin cut in,placing a water bottle in her hand. "Over the next few days, I'll either drive you to the construction site myself or have Miguel take you."



After a brief pause, his tone deepened. "Milly hasn't been entirely dealt with yet. I'm concerned about your  safety."



The mention of Milly made Brinley's protest catch in her throat. She found herself unable to argue.


After the scare the day before, she couldn't shake off the faint chill of unease that clung to her.



The accident had failed to seriously hurt her, which meant Milly was probably still lurking in the shadowS,waiting for another opportunity.


Her safety was a genuine concern.


"Alright," Brinley murmured at last, giving a small nod."Thank you."


Austin let out a light laugh and reached over, ruffling her hair in a warm, almost teasing gesture. "Don't thank me. We don't need that kind of formality between us."



His easy affection startled her. Heat rushed to her face,and she quickly turned toward the window to hide the blush creeping across her cheeks.



Beyond the glass, the city stretched wide beneath the blaze of sunlight, cars weaving in steady streams.


Yet her heart was caught in a swirl of conflicted emotions. The relationship between her and Austin felt more intimate than before, as if an invisible line drawing them closer with every moment.


This new intimacy wrapped her in a nervousness edged with hope.


The car rolled to a smooth stop outside Hillcrest Villa.


As they stepped out, the butler greeted them warmly,"Welcome home,Mr.Moore,Mrs. Moore."


Austin acknowledged him with a nod and guided Brinley inside. "Have they prepared lunch already?"he asked,glancing toward the dining room.


"It's all prepared," the butler replied



The moment Brinley crossed the threshold of the living room, the rich, mouthwatering scent wrapped around her.



The dining table gleamed with plates of food that had been carefully arranged, each one tailored to her taste.



The sight of the meal, so thoughtfully prepared, sent a gentle warmth through Brinley's chest.



Whatever lay ahead between her and Austin, at least right now, the care he showed her was unmistakably real. "Come on, wash up first, then we'll eat," Austin insisted, setting her bag down on the sofa before gently steering her toward the bathroom.


When she returned with freshly washed hands, Austin was already seated at the table, waiting with patient ease.



He nudged her plate of ribs closer and said with quiet insistence, "Taste this and tell me what you think."


Brinley lifted her fork, picked up a rib, and took a slow bite, savoring the rich flavor.



The sause spread warmly across her tongue, and the tender meat slid cleanly off the bone.



"This is amazing," she said with genuine delight, her eyes lighting up.



Watching her enjoyment, Austin's lips curved into a gentle smile. "Have more if you like it."


They ate in companionable silence, sunlight spilling through the floor-to-ceiling windows and bathing the table in golden warmth.



The quiet ease of it all left Brinley faintly spellbound,as though they were just a regular couple enjoying a plain but contented life. Once lunch ended, Austin left to handle company affairs,while Brinley returned to her room to rest.


With her back pressed to the headboard, she reached for her unfinished book, "Racetrack Engineering Analysis," yet her eyes skimmed the page without absorbing a word.



Her thoughts kept drifting back to Austin-his smile,his quiet tenderness, the firm decisiveness he carried,and the closeness they had shared in the hospital room that morning.



Brinley dragged her fingers through her hair in frustration, then flung the book aside with a sharp thud.



To distract herself, she reached for her phone,meaning to scroll through the news, and was startled to find the tide shifting.



The smear pieces about her had thinned out, replaced by headlines on the Palmer Group's projects facing regulatory probes.



Austin's counterattack was clearly beginning to take effect.



Milly and Colin seemed tangled in their own mess,leaving her a rare moment of ease. A soft sigh slipped from Brinley, relieved she didn t have to fend off their schemes for now.



Switching apps, she opened a racing fonum for updates on the exhibition race



To her surprise, the threads were buzzing with her name alongside the elusive Nightblade.


"I have news about Brinley. She's been hurt-and itt appears to have been deliberate sabotage."



"That poor girl-just stepping into therace took guts.and now someone's already targeting her."


"Still, do you think she can really race? She's just a rookie."



"Who knows? But I respect her for trying. At least she's brave enough to race."



" wonder whether Nightblade will actually show up People are saying his spot's already secured"



"No way! If that's true, this race is going to be incredible. Nightblade was unbeatable in his prime!



"Imagine if he and Brinley go head-to-head.I'd pay good money to see that showdown,"


The moment Nightblade was mentioned, a sharp glint lit Brinley's eyes. Could he really be making a comeback on the track?



Would the moment come when they finally stood as rivals on the same ground?



Could she rewrite the regrets that had haunted her for years?



Resolve surged through her chest, hardening her gaze with newfound fire.



Whether Austin was Nightblade or not, she had to claim victory in this race.



Not only to prove her worth to the world, but to honor the part of herself she'd once left behind.
 ###Chapter 87 Nothing In My World Matters More Than...
In the following days, Austin took on the role of Brinley's personal chauffeur.


One morning, as Brinley finished getting dressed and was about to head to the construction site, she spotted Austin descending the stairs, car keys glinting in his hand.



"I thnought Miguel was supposed to drive me today?"Brinley remarked, tilting her head with a questioning look.



She vividly recalled Austin had an international video conference scheduled-one he wasn't supposed to miss at this hour.



Closing the distance, Austin plucked the hard hat smoothly from her hand and answered, "The meeting got pushed back. I'll take you instead."



Brinley's brow shot up. "You're bound for the office,and I'm going to the construction site. We're going in opposite directions."



Austin let out a soft chuckle and brushed a stray lock of her hair back into place. "I'm heading to the    materials market near your site. They just brought in a shipment of imported protective stock. Figured you could use it-and I wanted to check the quality myself."



His tone carried quiet conviction, his eyes warm and unwavering, but Brinley was still not convinced.


Yet, she chose not to push it and accepted his offer of a ride.



Sliding into the Maybach's passenger seat, she stole a sidelong glance at Austin as he maneuvered the car with practiced ease.


She was lost in thought. This was already the fifth time this week he made time to drive her.


Wherever she needed to go, Austin always had some perfect excuse to offer her a ride.



At first, Miguel had gone through the motions of offering her rides, but soon enough he stopped pretending. Now he simply forwarded her schedule straight to Austin and happily enjoyed the extra hours of freedom.



The car eased out of the villa gates, gliding smoothly onto the main road. Brinley sat angled toward the window, eyes following the blur of street scenes rushing past, before her curiosity finally spilled out."Austin, haven't you been busy lately?" she queried. 
His hands stilled on the steering wheel for a fraction of a second. When he glanced at her, the corners of his eyes crinkled with amusement. "Why would you say that?"



"You're the powerful CEO of Moore Group, yet you've been hovering around me all day and acting as my chauffeur. Doesn't that feel beneath y/ou?" Her tone was laced with humor, but there was a sharp edge of seriousness beneath it.



She had noticed the way he had trimmed away countless unimportant social obligations, even rearranged his work schedule, all so he could chauffeur her back and forth.



His attentiveness had gone far beyond the casual habits of most married couples.


Austin let out a low laugh and turned his gaze back to the open road. "Nothing in my world matters more than you do."



Those words sent her pulse skittering, a warmth creeping across her cheeks before she turned sharply toward the window, pretending she hadn't heard.



Still, the odd sensation lingered, like a pebble dropped into calm water, ripples spreading endlessly inside her chest. When the car rolled to a stop at the site entrance,she unfastened her seatbelt, ready to step out. Austin's hand closed gently around her wrist, halting her.


"I'll pick you up tonight," he said, his gaze steady and full of intent. "We'll have dinner at a restaurant."



"There's no need. I might be stuck working late..."Brinley murmured hesitantly.


"Late or not, you still have to eat," Austin cut in, his tone firm, the kind that left no room for refusal.



Brinley bit back the refusal poised on her tongue.



Drawn into Austin's gaze as though something unseen held her there, she finally gave a small nod. "Fine."


With deliberate slowness, Austin let her hand slip free,his eyes glinting with sly triumph. "Go on. Take good care of yourself."


She opened the door, stepped out, slipped on her hard hat, and set off toward the construction site.



As her footsteps carried her forward, instinct made her glance back. Austin's car still idled where she'd left it, his window rolled down, his eyes fixed on her with a soft, lingering smile.



Their gazes locked, and her chest gave a sharp,  unsteady thump. Flustered, she spun back around and quickened her pace.



That warmth of his stare clung to her skin, steady and unyielding, until she stepped onto the site and it vanished.



Inside the temporary boardroom. Brinley leaned against the wall, pressing her palms to her flushed cheeks.



"Get a grip, Brinley! Now's not the time to be lovestruck!" she reminded herself firmly.



The project was teetering at a crucial point,and with the exhibition race looming, the weight of unfinished work pressed down on her from every direction.



By six o'clock, Austin's car waited at the construction site entrance, headlights glowing faintly through the drizzle.



Brinley had intended to work overtime, but under his quiet insistence, she had no choice but to leave.



The slanted drops rattled against the windows.Inside the car, Austin sat with a document in hand, his profile softened by the dim interior light.


When Brinley slipped inside, her damp hair clung to her temples, carrying a chill from the rain. Without hesitation, Austin passed her a folded towel."Here, dry yourself."



She accepted it, blotting her hair as she glanced sideways at him. "So, where are we having dinner?"



Starting the engine, Austin steered smoothly onto the road. "There's a new restaurant on the north side.After that,we'll head over to the racetrack."



Brinley hesitated, her head tilting as she studied him."Why?"



Austin's voice carried a quiet certainty. "Your car was wrecked, remember? I had a new one brought in for you."



Her fingers stilled mid-motion, and she sat frozen,staring at him in stunned silence. The moment stretched until Austin chuckled softly and tapped her forehead with a light flick of his fingers.



That little gesture broke her daze. She finally nodded,murmuring, "Alright."



The restaurant he chose was tucked away in a quiet corner of the city, refined and discreet, its atmosphere hushed and elegant.



The food was exquisite, every dish distinct and bursting with flavor. Brinley ate until her hunger was satisfied, her usual guarded expression softening as her eyes lingered on Austin, warmth slipping into her gaze.
###Chapter 88 | Want You To Open Your Heart To Me
 By the time Brinley and Austin left dinner for the racetrack, the rain had already stopped.



He drove her to a city-center course,where beginners usually honed their skills.



A new white car sat waiting in the corner of the pit lane. It wasn't built for speed or flair-just the kind of ride meant for learners.



"Want to give it a try?" Austin asked, tossing a helmet toward her.



Brinley caught it, and the chill of the surface against her fingertips made her heart skip, though she couldn't explain why.



She strolled up to the car, tugged the door open, and slid into the driver's seat, exaggerating her clumsy attempts to adjust it.



Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Austin lingering in the pit, his eyes fixed on her.


When she turned the key, the engine roared to life.Its low rumble was much softer than the race cars she had practiced with, perfectly suited for a beginner's car.



"Austin." Brinley rolled down her window, her voice exaggerated with excitement. "Up for a race?"



Austin gave her a look, half amused. "What's on the line?"



Brinley leaned into the act, her tone childlike."Whoever loses has to buy the other dinner for a whole month."



She kept her act up, making sure she looked every bit the clueless beginner.



Austin laughed under his breath and strolled toward a black race car. "Fine. But let's sweeten the deal."


Sliding into the driver's seat, he lowered his window and met her eyes, his voice calm. "If I win, I want you to open your heart to me."



Brinley's heart pounded wildly, her fingers curling tightly around the wheel.



The glow of the streetlamp highlighted the contours of Austin's face, and as he stared at her, she realized he wasn't teasinng at all.



The wind carried the damp scent of rain across the track, tugging lightly at the strands of hair on Brinley's  forehead.



She remembered his attentive care over the past few days, how he always remembered her preferences and the quiet worry he showed when she was hurt.



All the little details she had ignored now slotted together like pieces of a puzzle.



"Just you wait-I'll win!" Brinley declared, rolling up her window.



The white car rumbled as it rolled onto the track.



She kept her speed deliberately cautious, even hesitating on gear shifts to keep up the novice act.



In the rearview mirror, she noticed the black car trailing her at a careful half-car length-Austin matching her movements as if refusing to overtake.



As she crossed the finish line, Brinley hit the brakes,bringing the car to a smooth stop.



She removed her helmet, pulse still racing, and glanced at the black car that had crossed the line just ahead of her.



On that last corner, instinct had almost taken over.She'd nearly slipped into her usual sharp cornering,but managed to hold back at the last second. Austin's car pulled up beside her. He stepped out,the wind tossing strands of hair across his forehead, a faint smile lingering on his lips.



He walked up to her window, leaning down until he could see her. "I won."



The timer confirmed it. He'd beaten her by three seconds.



Brinley found herself staring at his face, so close to hers,the light glinting in his eyes.



"Austin." She hesitated, then continued, "Did you..."



She wanted to ask if he'd seen through her act, if he had been holding back on purpose. But instead, the question that had been lodged in her chest slipped out. "Why are you treating me this well?"



It was the same question, surfacing again.



Austin watched her pout and couldn't help but chuckle.



He reached forward and pinched her cheek lightly,his touchimpossibly tender.



His voice lowered, gentle yet firmn. "I'll give you the answer when you really fall for me."



The evening breeze fluttered the edges of their clothes. Brinley stared at him, completely speechless.


The honesty in his eyes didn't seem like an act, yet she still couldn't bring herself to fall for him.



On the drive back, silence stretched between them.



Brinley rested her head against the window, watching the blur of streets outside as an unfamiliar warmth filled her chest.


Maybe...letting herself fall for him wouldn't be such a terrible thing.



The thought had barely formed before she quickly suppressed it.



No,she couldn't afford distractions, not with the race ahead.



And yet, when her eyes drifted sideways to Austin,intent on the road,her heartbeat faltered.



It was already nine o'clock when they reached Hillcrest Villa, the darkness settling around it like a heavy cloak.



A late-night snack awaited them, prepared by the butler.



Austin took a bottle of red wine from the wine cabinet and poured a glass for Brinley "Take it easy," he said lightly. "You can't hold your liquor well. Don't end up flat on the table like last time."



"That was one time!" Brinley shot back, snatching up the glass and taking a bold sip.



The cool wine slid down her throat, rich with a faint fruitiness, smoother than any red she'd had before.Without thinking, she tipped back another half glass.



Austin didn't stop her. Instead,he served her food at an easy pace, eyes lingering on her as her cheeks bloomed with color. The sight quietly amused him.



She'd had a few more drinks. The whole room swam before her eyes, and the glass wobbled dangerously in her hand.



She propped her chin on the table, staring straight at him like a lazy, satisfied cat.



"Austin." Brinley's voice came out low and husky."Why?"
###Chapter 89 Are You Another Colin
"Why what, exactly?" Austin lowered his fork and grabbed a napkin, gently dabbing the sauce from the corner of Brinley's mouth.



"Why are you so kind to me?" Brinley said with a blink."You've been so kind to me-cooking,helping me out -but | can't figure out why. Is there an ulterior motive?Are you another Colin?"



Austin's eyes narrowed, his voice firm. "I'm nothing like him.”



"How so?" Brinley pressed, suddenly prodding his cheek. "Though, I must say, you're way better looking than he is."



Her cool fingers grazed Austin's skin, making his breath hitch for a split second.



He reached for her hand, but Brinley nimbly dodged.



Her fingers trailedalong his jaw. "Such sharp features -like a sculpted masterpiece! And those red ears are absolutely adorable."


 
Giggling, she gave his earlobe a playful tug. Austin let out a resigned sigh. "Brinley, enough messing around."



"I'm not messing around!" she shot back, slipping her other hand under his shirt, her fingers brushing his toned waist. Her eyes sparkled. "Wow, abs! So solid!"



Austin's body stiffened instantly.



He caught her wandering wrist, his voice turning husky "Brinley, keep this up, and I won't hold back."



"Huh?" She tilted her head, eyes glassy but asly smile spreading. "What wvill you do? Force a kiss on me like a hero from those romantic novels?"



Before he could respond, she slipped free, leaning in so close their noses nearly brushed.



Austin turned his face away, gently stroking her hair."You're too tipsy to know what you're doing."



Brinley froze, a sudden wave of hurt washing over her as her eyes reddened. "Do you think I'm annoying? I know... I'm just a coward. I try to suppress my feelings for you."



Sniffling, her voice trembled. "But you're so handsome and so kind... If I were not terrified of another heartbreaker, I would chase you without a second thought! Even if it's just a fling, it feels... worth it." Her words dripped with drunken sincerity



Tilting her head, she slumped onto Austin's shoulder,her breathing evening out.



Austin glanced down, a soft smile breaking through.



He carefully scooped her up, carrying her upstairs. As he moved, the butler discreetly ushered the staff out,leaving only a faint wall light glowing in the hallway.



Brinley stirred in his arms, seeking a cozy spot.



Her fingers clung to his shirt collar, grazing his collarbone, sending a shiver through him.



In the bedroom, Austin set her on the wide bed. As he started to rise, she gripped his wrist tightly.



"Don't leave, please," she murmured, eyes shut,lashes damp. "When you were in the hospital, I stayed... It's time for you to return the favor now."



Her plea was soft, and it was hard for Austin to turn her down.



He settled by the bed, watching her sleep, his hand gently brushing her flushed cheek.



"Silly girl," he whispered. "This was never a game to me. My feelings for you are real-that's the only reason I treat you this way." Moonlight slipped through the sheer curtains, bathing her face in a soft glow.



Austin sat, listening to her steady breaths until late in the night. Then, he draped a blanket over the sofa.



In the quiet night, Brinley rolled groggily toward the bed's edge, nearly falling-until a strong arm caught her.



She instinctively nestled into the warmth, curling into Austin's arms and drifting off again.



Austin gazed at her, defenseless in his hold, and sighed softly, letting her cling to his waist.



His hand gently patted her back, as if calming a startled creature.



At dawn, a tickle on her neck roused Brinley.



Blinking sleepily, she found Austin's sleeping face inches away-long lashes, sharp nose,lips set in a firm line.



Her hand clutched his pajama collar,her body practically sprawled over him.



As she jolted upright, last night's memories flooded back.



She had playfully pulled Austin's earlobe, grazed his  toned abs, and rambled ridiculous, teasing words.



She covered her face. Had she really done all that to Austin? She couldn't believe it!



Rubbing his eyes, Austin stirred and sat up, spotting her crimson cheeks. His eyes twinkled with mischief."Up already? You said you would chase me last night.Are you still planning to?"



Brinley's face burned, wishing the floor would swallow her.



Grabbing a pillow, she hurled it at him, voice sharp with embarrassment. "Austin, shut up! I said no such thing!"



He caught the pillow easily, chuckling as he smoothed her tousled hair. "Fine, my mistake. I must have dreamed it."



But the gleam in his eyes screamed he had heard every word.



Mortified and fuming, Brinley yanked the blanket over her head,hiding from view.



Austin eyed the blanket lump, his smile widening.



Sunlight spilled through the curtain gaps, dancing in his eyes. He thought, maybe, winning her heart wouldn't take long after all.
###Chapter 90 But | Took Your Words Seriously
 Over the next few days, Brinley's thoughts circled endlessly, replaying every detail of Austin in her mind.


She remembered the elegance of his hands, firm yet graceful, as he passed her a drink; the way his smile tugged at her heart when she playfully pulled at his ear; and the soothing cadence of his heartbeat when he held her close in the stillness of night.



"Oh no," Brinley groaned, burying her face deep into her pillow.



This wasn't some fleeting fancy or silly crush; it was real.



She had fallen for Austin.



Her whole body shuddered at the realization.



The wounds Colin left behind hadn't even begun to heal properly, and yet here she was, letting her heart stumble again.Argh!



Just some tender gestures, a handful of drinks, the brush of solid muscle under her fingertips, and suddenly her heart was fluttering out of control. "Brinley, are you such an idiot?" She gave her forehead a smack in self-reprimand. "You only ever think with your heart. Honestly, there's no saving you."



Determined not to fall any deeper, Brinley hatched an elaborate plan to steer clear of Austin.



In the mornings, she slipped out of the house before he ever came downstairs.



From the upstairs window, Austin once caught sight of her vanishing quickly down the street. It left him puzzled, yet he didn't chase after her.



Her nightly returns to the villa became something like a spy movie-stealthy and calculated.



She would arrive home a little earlier than him, snatch a quick bite from the kitchen, then shut herself up in her room.



On other nights, she lingered outside until late,slipping through the front door under the moonlight,careful not to switch on a single light in the living room.



If their paths crossed, she would offer a brisk exchange before fleeing as if he were a predator.



One evening, as Brinley sank into her bathtub, steam curling around her, a knock sounded at her door. "Brinley?" Austin called, his voice low and slightly hoarse. "There's warm milk waiting for you. It'll help you sleep."



Brinley almost stopped breathing.



How on earth had he noticed her insomnia?



"No, thanks!" she called back, forcing her voice to sound upbeat. "I'm fine, and I'm going to bed now!"



There was a brief pause, followed by Austin's chuckle."I'll leave it by your door. Drink it while it's warm."



When his footsteps faded, Brinley leaned over the edge of the tub, listening to the hammering in her chest, and raked her fingers through her damp hair in frustration.



Why couldn't he simply leave her alone?



Brinley reluctantly finished her bath and stepped out to discover a glass resting at her door.



Leaning against the frame, she sipped the milk in small, careful mouthfuls. The gentle warmth coursed through her,easing the tight coil in her nerves.



Once finished, she thought to return the glass. But as she reached Austin's room, the door stood slightly ajar, a golden glow spilling out Inexplicably, she stopped in her tracks. Then she caught the faint clatter of keys drifting from inside.


Was Austin still working at this late hour?



She was about to retreat when the door swung open.



Austin stood there in casual loungewear, hair still damp from a shower.



He arched an eyebrow when he spotted her. what exactly are you sneaking around for?"



Startled, Brinley nearly dropped the glass. "N-nothing ... just bringing this back," she stammered, thrusting it into his hands before attempting to bolt.



But he pulled her back by the wrist.



The warmth of his touch made Brinley's heart quiver.



"You've been avoiding me for days," Austin said,staring at her."Why?"


Brinley's heartbeat stumbled wildly, and though she tried to yank her hand free, Austin's grip was firm.Cornered into keeping up the act, she snapped, "I've been avoiding you? Come on, you're imaging things.I've just been swamped with work."



"Is that so? And you can't even sit down for a meal?"Austin pressed. "Is it that you regret what you said  that night, wanting to brush it off as drunken talk?"



"I.." Brinley's face burned crimson as he saw right through her. "That was just nonsense after drinking; it doesn't mean anything!"



"Oh?" Austin leaned closer teasingly. "But | took your words seriously."



Her mind went blank, his words striking like a thunderclap. She stared up at him, meeting the amusement in his eyes, her panic written plain across her face.



"You..." Brinley began, but her tongue failed her.



Austin let go of her wrist, his hand rising instead to stroke her hair, the gesture so natural, so intimate.



"Go get some rest," he muttered before retreating into his room and shutting the door softly behind him



Brinley stood rooted in place, fingers brushing the spot on her wrist where his warm palm had been.



Back in her room, she lay flat on her bed, staring at the ceiling.



Was it really so difficult to admit she liked him?



But Colin's face suddenly surfaced in her thoughts, the sting of his lies and betrayal pricking at her like sharp  needles



Brinley squeezed her eyes shut and shook her head hard.



No. She couldn't let history repeat itself. The more perfect Austin seemed, the more she had to keep her distance.



Falling headlong into love again was the last thing she needed.

She scolded herself over and over. Sleep wouldn't come. Instead, Austin's words kept echoing in her mind. "But I took your words seriously."
###Chapter 91 We're Your Family,Right


Recently, Colin had been drowning in a mess of problems, each one tied to the whispers that Milly had sabotaged Brinley's car.

For three nights straight, he hadn't bothered to step foot in the house he shared with Milly.

One night,Milly lingered before her vanity, fingertips brushing over her small but growing belly where a four-month-old life stirred within.

The mirror threw back the image of a woman whose cheeks were pale and a little gaunt, yet beneath her weariness glimmered a faint, secretive satisfaction.

The door swung open, and Colin stumbled into the bedroom. He reeked of liquor, his shoulders tight as if barely containing the anger simmering under his skin.

He flung his suit jacket across the sofa and tugged at his tie, his jaw tight with restrained fury.

"My grandfather just called again, chewing me out," he muttered hoarsely,fatigue lacing every word."Milly,why can't you keep yourself in line? Why do you always stir up trouble?"

Turning around, Milly let her features soften into pitiful sorrow, her reddening eyes glistening with tears."Colin, I promise I didn't mean to. I just... I'm terrified of losing you."

She rose from her seat, moving toward him with hesitant steps, her hand trembling as it reached for his arm.Colin,however, shoved her away with a cold flick of disdain, refusing even the brush of her touch.

His laugh came out low and cutting, his gaze narrowing like a blade at her trembling form."Don't act innocent now. Did you think about the consequences when you sabotaged Brinley's car? Do you even understand how dangerous that was? If she'd really died out there, we wouldn't just be barred from the Palmer family-you and I would be finished."

The moment Brinley's name left his lips, Milly's expression faltered, a flicker of jealousy sparking before she quickly buried it beneath a mask of fragile sorrow. Tears slid down her cheeks as she whispered, voice heavy with trembling fear, "I wasn't thinking straight. You looked at her with so much admiration when she reappeared... It honestly made me feel really insecure. I can't shake the terror that she'll take you from me and that our baby will be born a bastard..."

Her hand smoothed protectively over her belly, her shoulders curling in on themselves as her voice cracked with desperation. "This is your child, Colin. A son... the very blessing your family has been begging heaven for.How could you even think of abandoning both of us?"

Colin's features eased, the hard edge in his eyes softening.

The Palmer family's obsession with a male heir ran deep, and this child stood as his strongest claim to security within the family.

Sensing the shift in him, Milly pressed forward, wrapping her arms tightly around his waist and pressing her damp cheek against his chest. "Colin, I know I crossed the line. Please... just this once, forgive me," she whispered, her words breaking apart with tears."|promise you, I'll never do that again. Please believe me.I only lost control because I love you too much-so much that I can't think straight."

Her trembling confession, carried on a breathless voice, scraped at Colin's defenses. The warmth of her body against his and the haze of alcohol dulled his anger, loosening the tight coil of tension he had been holding inside.

He lowered his gaze to Milly, who was trembling and clinging to him, and finally exhaled a weary sigh. After all, she was carrying his son. His hand lifted stiffly, landing in an awkward pat on her back. "I forgive you,Milly. But promise me... never again."

Milly's chest fluttered with relief, though she kept her expression carefully sorrowful. "I knew you'd understand. Don't worry, I'll take care of myself and the baby. Once he's here, your family wilI accept me."

Rising on her toes, she brushed a soft kiss against his chin, her eyes glimmering with calculated sweetness."Please, don't stay upset with me. I've already drawn your bath. Freshen up, and I'll ease your shoulders with a massage."

Her tear-reddened eyes and submissive tone dulled the sharp edge of his anger.

Colin reminded himself that a son was vital to cement his place in the Palmer family, and Milly still had her "Fine," he muttered, turning toward the bathroom as his resistance slipped away.

Milly's lips curved into the faintest trace of a cold smile once Colin's back disappeared from sight, but she quickly slipped her mask back on, softening her expression as she reached for a fresh towel.

For the moment, she had wriggled out of disaster.

Yet deep down, she knew Colin's affection had already begun to drift beyond her grasp.

If she wanted to tighten her hold on him and marry him, she would have to move with far sharper cunning.

From behind the bathroom door came the steady rush of running water. Milly drifted toward the window,her gaze cutting into the night's shadows.

"Brinley," she whispered, narrowing her eyes with quiet venom. "Our little game has only just begun."

By the time Colin reappeared, steam trailing him from the bath, Milly had slipped into a silk nightgown,her hair gathered loosely at her nape, leaving her slender neck enticingly bare.

She stepped forward with a glass of warm milk, holding it out carefully. "Here, have some. It'll settle your nerves and help you sleep."

Colin accepted it without a word, drained it in a single gulp, and set the empty glass down on the bedside table.

He climbed into bed and rolled onto his side, turning his back on Milly, his silence making it clear he wanted no more conversation.

Unfazed, she slipped in beside him, easing closer inch by inch until she could loop an arm gently around his waist.

"Colin..." Her voice quivered with a soft dependency as she pressed her cheek against his back. "Whatever happens, you'll still have me and the baby. We're your family, right?"

Colin gave no answer, his breathing evening out. It seemed he had drifted off. Milly, though, remained restless, her eyes tracing the shadows on the ceiling as schemes stirred in her mind.

Striking at Brinley again would be reckless for now, but leaving her completely unchallenged wasn't an option either.

Austin posed an even greater danger-too sharp, too calculating. Crossing him could undo everything.

A hushed sigh escaped her as she pressed her cheek against Colin's back, drawing faint comfort from his warmth.

She vowed to grip tightly to all she possessed-for her own survival, and for the fragile life turning within her.

###Chapter 92 Probing Questions


At dawn the day before the international exhibition race, Austin tugged Brinley out of bed.

"Come on. I'm taking you to the hospital." His voice was still husky with sleep, smooth in a way that almost sounded indulgent.

Blinking against the early light, Brinley pushed her tangled hair from her face. "Didn't the doctor already say I'm fine? I can grip the wheel without any problem."

She held up her arm, the bandage wrapped around it thin and unobtrusive, flexing it to prove her point.

Instead of arguing, Austin draped a coat over her shoulders with practiced ease. "I want you to have a check-up to ensure everything is fine," he said, tone low but commanding. "Please, do as I say."

The weight he put on those words made it clear there was no room for refusal.

Knowing she couldn't win this particular battle, Brinley sighed and dragged herself up to freshen up.

She slumped against the seat as the car hummed along the quiet morning roads, her voice tinged with annoyance. "Do we really have to go through all this for such a small injury?"

Austin's fingers stilled briefly on the steering wheel before he cast her a steady glance."Your health comes before everything else."

The evenness of his tone wrapped around her like warmth seeping into chilled skin, silencing the protest on her lips.

When they arrived, the private hospital greeted them with an almost sterile stillness, so hushed it seemed even a breath might echo. A doctor stood ready in the examination room, prepared before they even walked in.

The evaluation was thorough, covering not only the state of her arm but every vital sign and bodily function.

After a careful inspection, the doctor smiled with calm reassurance. "Mrs. Moore is healing remarkably well. The wound has closed nicely, with no tendon or nerve damage. She'll be able to carry out daily activities without issue-and tomorrow's race won't be affected."

Relief slipped from Brinley in a soft exhale. She was just about to say something, when Austin interjected,his voice edged with quiet persistence. "Are you absolutely certain there won't be lingering effects? Any pain when she strains the arm?"

The doctor offered a patient nod. "After the stitches come out, she may feel a slight tightness. That's natural and temporary. A bit of ointment will ease it-nothing lasting, nothing to worry about."①

After the doctor's repeated reassurances, some of the tension in Austin's jaw finally eased.

The drive back passed in near silence, the quiet stretching heavy between them.

Out of nowhere, Austin broke it. "Tomorrow, a few retired champions will be on the track," he said evenly."And don't underestimate the younger racers-some of them are really impressive."

His eyes flicked toward her, then back to the road. "Don't push yourself too hard. Just keep it safe.Even if you don't place, no one will blame you."

Brinley curved her lips into a smile. "Relax, I know my limits. I'm treating it as a bit of fun. As long as I finish,I'll be satisfied. If I manage not to come in last, that's already a win."

Austin gave a soft laugh, letting the matter drop without another word.

Brinley leaned back with.a casual air, her voice light. "By the way, I heard Nightblade's showing up for the exhibition race?"

Austin's grip on the wheel faltered just slightly before he answered with practiced ease, "That's what people are saying."

"Wow, this is huge!" she remarked, her feigned amazement carrying just the right edge of curiosity."lnhis prime, he was a force to reckon with. Too bad he vanished without warning. What do you think brings him back at this point?"

His eyes cut toward her, sharp and searching. "You sound a little too intrigued." "Well, he is a legend, after all." She turned her head to avoid his gaze, looking out the window."And honestly, your knowledge of racing has always felt... more than casual. Do you actually know him?"

A shadow of a smile tugged at Austin's mouth, one that hinted at hidden meanings. "Why don't you take a guess?"

Instead of giving her a straight answer, he deflected smoothly."Tell me this-what do you know about Rosara?"

The sudden shift hit her like a jolt. Brinley's pulse kicked hard, and her fingers clenched around the seatbelt,the strap biting against her palm as her breath quickened.

She slowly faced him, only to find his expression calm-as though mentioning Rosara meant nothing at all.

"Just... heard about her." She forced her voice into a casual rhythm. "Rosara used to be one of the big names-she even went up against Nightblade. It's a shame she slipped away just as suddenly as he did."

After a short hesitation, she added, almost testing him, "Doesn't it strike you as odd? They both retired around the same time, and now they're both stepping back into the spotlight together. Do you think...maybe they've had some kind of connection?"

Austin's fingers idly traced the leather of the steering wheel while his eyes stayed on the traffic light glowing red ahead.

As the car eased to a stop, he finally turned, his gaze steady and searching. "Possibly. Two racers of that caliber might've been close off the track. By the way, I can't help but notice that your racing skills are far from those of a beginner. On the simulator, your lines had the same precision-almost the same style-as Rosara's."

Brinley's pulse gave a startled jump at his words, though she masked it with a light, practiced laugh.h?What a coincidence!"

She reached for the bottle of water on the console, twisting off the cap and taking a measured sip, using the motion to steady her nerves. Her gaze slid back to him, playful yet probing."Come to think of it, you sound awfully familiar with Nightblade. Don't tell me... you're actually him?" The remark fell halfway between jest and suspicion, and she watched his expression with deliberate care.

Austin arched one brow, started the engine, and eased the car into the morning traffic. His voice was maddeningly unreadable."Suppose I said | was?"

Her heartbeat stumbled again, and she leaned forward, ready to push-but then his mouth curved in a sly,teasing smile. "Too bad. I'm not. I don't have that level of talent."

The light turned green, and the sleek Maybach glided seamlessly into the stream of cars.

Whatever tension had sparked between them dissolved into the steady hum of the engine,leaving the cabin deceptively calm.
###Chapter 93 Wishing You A Smooth Race


As Brinley and Austin arrived back at Hillcrest Villa, the butler was overseeing the staff as they packed supplies into the vehicle.

Numerous crates were piled near the doorway, appearing quite weighty.

"What's all this?" Brinley asked, her brow arching curiously.

"Replacement parts and safety. equipment arranged for you," Austin replied casually, loosening his jacket with an easy demeanor. "A mechanic will be on-site to tweak anything necessary."

Brinley's thoughts drifted to that past incident when her brakes had given out-a memory that now made Austin's concern perfectly clear. Still, she couldn't resist teasing him. "So all this fuss is because you're worried about me? Just so you know, I might lose badly. All this gear will be wasted on me."

Austin grinned. "Even if you finish dead last, the equipment has to meet top-tier standards.You're my wife-I would never give you anything less."

His words left Brinley momentarily speechless, and she watched his back as he walked away,humming softly before heading to the kitchen.

That night, after bathing, Brinley sprawled on her bed, the soft glow of her bedside lamp illuminating a detailed racetrack map. Every curve and braking zone was precisely annotated.

Her focus lingered on a tricky sequence of S-curves, her fingers absentmindedly tracing their path on the sheets as a question nagged at her.

Should she ask if Austin would be at the race tomorrow?

She ultimately brushed the thought aside.

Whether he was a casual racer or the elusive Nightblade who had disappeared from the spotlight, it was irrelevant. Her mission for tomorrow's race was clear.

She would finish the challenge and prove her abilities beyond any skepticism.

She flicked off the lamp,letting the room fall into darkness.

Shutting hereyes, Brinley banished the swirling doubts and soon drifted into a deep slumber.

The next morning, her internal clock woke her.

After freshening up and slipping into her gear, she grabbed her bag and stepped out. The living room was quiet. She saw a warm cup of milk on the dining table, with a note tucked beneath it in Austin's handwriting."Don't forget breakfast-and have this before you go."

Brinley took a sip of the milk, and its warmth spread through her, sparking an unexpected comfort.

As she reached the door to change her shoes, her phone buzzed with Austin's message. "You've got this.Wishing youa smooth race."

The brief message grounded her in a way she couldn't quite explain.

Brinley typed back a quick "Thanks" and left.

Unbeknownst to her, Austin watched from a second-floor window, his gaze lingering until her car vanished from the villa grounds.

The international exhibition.race was set at a professional circuit on the city's outskirts.

The entrance's digital display cycled through the names of thirty racers-veterans and rising talents, all prominent in the racing scene.

Brinley parked in a secluded corner of the competitors' lot, donning a plain gray work jacket and tucking her distinctive long hair under a cap to stay unrecognized.

She popped the trunk and slid into the unassuming white racecar Austin had provided.

Devoid of logos, it looked ordinary next to the heavily modified vehicles nearby. "Well, look who's here-Brinley?" a cocky voice called out.

Turning, she saw three men in logo-covered racing suits.

Leading them was Ballard Clayton, a frequent third-place finisher in local circuits, flanked by his regular companions, Dominik Norris and Jaxon Frazier.

Their faces sported sly grins, their approach clearly intentional.

"What's up?" Brinley asked coolly, her hand steady on the car's door handle.

Ballard smirked, his voice loud and mocking. "Just stopping by to see how you're doing. It's rare to see a real estate developer at a racetrack."

Dominik jumped in, "Yeah, I heard you can't even pull off a drift. Tell you what: take a one-minute head start.Maybe then you'll be able to keep up."

The nearby racers erupted in laughter, their sharp stares cutting through her.

Brinley saw through their taunts, suspecting Milly's involvement.

That morning, the PR team had flagged new online rumors accusing her of exploiting the exhibition race for business promotion.

Ignoring them, she swung open the car door and settled into the driver's seat. As she moved to close it,Jaxon leaned on the frame, his tone flippant. "Hold on, Brinley. How about a bet? If you make it through the first lap, I'll eat this car!"

"Step back," she said sharply, her icy glare forcing Jaxon to let go.

The plain white racecar rolled forward, their jeers fading into the background.

Brinley exhaled slowly, redirecting her focus to the track ahead.

This wasn't the moment to get distracted-her mission was to conceal Rosara's skill and accomplish her goal.

As she reached the competitors' staging area, a mob of reporters rushed toward her, their microphones nearly breaching the car window.
###Chapter 94 She'd Prove Them Wrong


Reporters overwhelmed Brinley with relentless questions.

"Mrs. Moore, are you just entering this race to promote your real estate project?"

"Some professional drivers claim you don't even understand the track rules. What's your response to that?"

"It's rumored that you stole a spot that should go to real racers. Care to comment?"

From the sidelines, a few mocking shouts broke through the reporters' questions.

"Go home and enjoy your life of luxury instead!"

"Does Mr. Moore know you're out here embarrassing yourself?"

Brinley clenched the steering wheel tighter.

She lowered the car window, ready to respond, when her eyes drifted toward the shadowy area of the waiting zone.

There, a man stood motionless in a jet-black racing suit, fully covered from head to toe. The matte helmet revealed not a trace of skin, adding to his mystery.

He leaned against the railing with both hands tucked into his pockets, tall and straight, looking so intimidating that no onedared approach.

Even at a distance, Brinley felt a strange, unmistakable sense of familiarity in that posture.

Just then, another driver approached him, dressed in the same style of racing suit, except for a flame emblem painted across his helmet.

It was Nicolas Gomez, Austin's close friend.

Following Austin's line of sight toward Brinley, Nicolas smirked, elbowing him lightly: "Your wife really has guts. Racing isn't child's play. Let's hope she doesn't skid off the track; otherwise, I'll be the one calling a Austin didn't look at him. His voice came through the helmet visor, low and cold. "That won't happen."

Nicolas arched a brow, ready to argue, but the broadcast cut in sharply. "Attention racers, the first round is about to begin. Please prepare."

Brinley pressed down on the accelerator, guiding her white race car as it eased into the line moving toward the registration zone.

The staff kept reporters and hecklers at bay, but their sneering looks and cutting remarks still reached Brinley, tightening around her like an unseen trap.

At the trackside, betting booths were crowded with racers and spectators, all focused on the electronic screens as they placed wagers.

Brinley's eyes flicked to the screen-next to her name were glaring odds of 1 in 100.

Almost everyone had bet she would be knocked out in the first round.

She pulled down her helmet visor, shutting the world out.

Inside, there was only her breathing and the low rumble of her engine warming up.

Once the staff confirmed her details, they signaled for her to move into the starting area.

Brinley shfted gears, eased off the clutch, and guided the white race car seamlessly onto the track.

Inside the starting area, the other drivers were already lined up and waiting.

Just ahead at a diagonal, Ballard-the same one who had mocked her earlier-caught her eye through his window and mouthed,"Last place."

Brinley's grip on the wheel tightened, her eyes locked on the starting line.

The green light was moments away. She inhaled deeply.

She'd make sure they saw what she was truly capable of. When the signal light went dark, she released the clutch, yet instantly, the cars flanking her lunged inward.

Ballard on the left, Dominik on the right. Their cars pressed against her lane, their mirrors nearly grazing her doors, trying to shove her straight off thetrack.

A harsh sound filled the air as tires screeched against asphalt.

The white car jolted half a length back, teetering dangerously close to crossing the boundary line.

The grandstands burst with laughter and jeers. "See? Told you Brinley couldn't handle it!"

"She can't even start straight; what's the point of her being here?"

Brinley's heart skipped, but her instincts from years on the track steadied her nerves.

She deftly twisted the steering wheel, taking advantage of the pressure from both carsto cut sharply and slip through the narrow space between them.

She fell to the back, but her car regained balance.

Surprise flashed across Ballard's and Dominik's faces; they hadn't expected her to break free so cleanly.

Grinding her teeth, Brinley slammed harder on the accelerator.

Up in the stands, the betting screen refreshed, flashing updated odds beneath her name: Brinley Moore-Win Rate: 0.5%.

The betting amounts against her kept climbing; everyone seemed convinced she wouldn't last.

"Miss Russell put money down that she'd crash out in the first round; odds are 1 in 20!"

"I bet she won't even survive the first curve. A rich lady like her can't handle this kind of heat."

A sneer touched Brinley's lips as she read the screen. She could feel everyone's dismissive gazes, all convinced she'd never make it past the first round. Well, she'd prove them wrong.

She remembered the first time she entered a track; the ridicule then was ten times harsher, yet hadn't she still carried home the championship? When the signal light went dark, she released the clutch, yet instantly, the cars flanking her lunged inward.

Ballard on the left, Dominik on the right. Their cars pressed against her lane, their mirrors nearly grazing her doors, trying to shove her straight off thetrack.

She remembered the first time she entered a track; the ridicule then was ten times harsher, yet hadn't she still carried home the championship? The red light vanished, and engines roared like thunder across the arena.

As soon as Brinley let go of the clutch, Ballard on her left and Dominik on her right closed in like sliding walls, forcing her toward the middle.

Their side mirrors came so close they almost scraped her door, and the gravel sprayed up by their tires rattled sharply against her car's body.

"Ha-ha! That's more like it!" someone shouted from the grandstand. "Show her what real racing is!"

Sweat beaded on Brinley's palms, the steering wheel shuddering violently beneath her hands. But in that instant of chaos, she found her opening.

She slammed the brakes, the car jolting downward before she floored the accelerator in the same breath.

The engine growled like a wild beast, and the white car shot forward at a ground-hugging angle,sliding between Ballard and Dominik in a daring move.

Smoke curled from her tires, the acrid smell filling the air. Before the spectators' gasps even faded, Brinley was already surging ahead, catching the moment when the lead car slowed for the curve-and in one breathtaking maneuver, she overtook two cars in quick succession.
###Chapter 95 She's Insane


"No way!" Ballard's eyes went wide, disbelief written all over his face as he jerked the steering wheel to chase after Brinley. But his earlier reckless move had thrown off his line, and he nearly skidded off the track.

Up ahead, the first series of S-curves loomed, yet Brinley showed no hesitation; she didn't even think about slowing down.

From the grandstand, Milly lounged with a glass of champagne, smiling smugly. But she suddenly blinked in shock when the white race car suddenly disappeared into the shadows of the bend.

A split second later, it tore through the corner at an angle that seemed to defy every law of physics.

The car leaned so far it was nearly scraping the asphalt, slipping through the inside lane to overtake in one clean,terrifying move.

The commentator's voice soared in awe. "Unbelievable! She's just pulled off an insane dive bomb! That's a maneuver so dangerous even seasoned pros rarely dare to use it!"

The jeers around the track directed at Brinley fell silent all at once.

The bettors, who had been loudly laughing and waving their slips just moments earlier, now gaped at the streak of white cutting past car after car, forgetting all about the betting slips in their hands.

By halfway through the second lap, Brinley had clawed her way up to third place.

Dominik's eyes burned with anger as he rammed into the back of her car on the straight, determined to throw her off balance.

But Brinley didn't falter. Instead, she used the jolt to her advantage. The moment her car skidded, she hit the accelerator again, swerving sharply and forcing her way past him on the right.

"She's insane! Completely insane!" Dominik shouted, slamming his fist against the steering wheel in frustration. At the last bend, the lead racer had just started into the curve when a flash of white filled his mirror.

Brinley's car skimmed so close to the guardrail that sparks flew from the tires.

And then, in the final breath before the finish line, she surged ahead of all her competitors.

As soon as she crossed the finish line, the timer stopped at 1 minute and 47 seconds. Brinley had beat the track record by a full two seconds.

The engines rumbled into silence, leaving the crowd stunned.

Brinley pulled off her helmet, shaking her damp hair free. She cast one calm glance at the speechless grandstand.

Those who had mocked her earlier could only gaze at her in disbelief.

Without sparing anyone a word, Brinley walked toward the rest area.

As she passed beneath the monitoring room, she lifted her eyes to the closed window.

Through the narrow gap, she could feel a steady pair of eyes locked on her.

Her lips curled into a small, knowing smile before she disappeared into the passageway.

Inside the monitoring room, Austin leaned back, fingers tapping lightly against the screen flashing "1 minute 47 seconds."

Nicolas, cigarette dangling from his mouth, was dumbstruck. "She beat your record by 0.3 seconds? Just how many tricks has she been hiding?"

Austin didn't answer. He picked up the walkie-talkie and spoke in a calm voice. "Have the judges check the track safety before the next round."

The staff immediately went to work on the final inspections.

On the large electronic board by the track, the names of the finalists began to roll. Among the top ten, one name stood out in bold-Nightblade. Nicolas let out a low whistle. "After years away from the racing world, you're returning as Nightblade today.Back in the day, that name used to make even pro racers lose their nerve. And now you're racing your own wife? Brutal. Maybe take it easy on her."

Austin bent over, adjusting the straps of his racing boots without looking up. "She doesn't need me to go easy on her."

"Come on," Nicolas said, elbowing him. "Sure, her warm-up moves carried a little of Rosara's style, but she's still not on your level. This final track is brutal; it takes endurance. Her reckless driving might not last for three laps. Trust me, take it down a notch."

Before he could finish, Austin flicked a light kick to his shin.

Nicolas yelped and hopped back, rubbing at his leg. But when he caught the icy look in Austin's eyes, he backed down quickly, muttering with a sheepish grin, "Fine, fine, l'Il shut up. Oh, by the way, that aggressive dive bomb move she pulled-doesn't it remind you of someone?"

Austin fastened the final strap, then rose to his feet. The black racing suit outlined his tall, straight frame like armor."Racing is about speed."

Without another word, he strode out toward his car.

The sleek black racecar gleamed under the lights, sharp and menacing. It stood in striking contrast to Brinley's simple white vehicle.

At the betting booths, chaos reigned. Lines snaked out the door, ten times thicker than before.

The ones who had mocked Brinley earlier were now frantically shoving money forward, eyes bloodshot. "I'm switching my bet. Brinley's making top three for sure!"

"Put me down for five thousand; she can go head-to-head with Nightblade!"

Among the crowd, new signs reading "Go Brinley!" popped up, ridiculous when compared to the jeering banners from earlier.

In the VIP stand, Milly looked ghostly pale. Her eyes remained fixed on the track entrance. At the sound of approaching footsteps, she turned her head. Upon seeing who it was, she forced a smile.

Colin hurried over. "Sorry, I got delayed. Did I miss the final?"

"It's just about to begin," Milly replied quickly, rising to greet him. She slipped her hand into his arm, her tone soft and coaxing."It's so noisy here. I know a rooftop restaurant nearby; it overlooks the whole track,and it's quiet. Why don't we watch from there?"
###Chapter 96 Brinley Was Rosara


Colin's eyes were fixed on the racetrack, landing right on Brinley as she leaned from the window of the white race car, speaking intently with a technician. The bright lights caught her profile, her expression sharp and focused.

He looked away after a moment, giving a small shake of his head before replying to Milly, "No need. We'll stay here and watch."

Milly stiffened, unease rising inside her.

She knew Colin all too well. Outwardly he carried a gentle demeanor, but deep down he admired strength and daring. If he truly saw Brinley's performance on the track...

Just then, a wave of cheers swept through the stands.

Brinley had already climbed back into her car, securing her helmet and snapping the visor down in one smooth,determined motion.

Colin's eyes remained on the white vehicle, his curiosity clearly piqued.

The sight made Milly's chest tighten with discomfort, her smile freezing, barely holding together.

An announcement boomed over the speakers. "Attention racers, the final is about to begin. Please proceed to the starting grid."

Side by side, the black and white cars rolled into place.

Through the window, Austin's reflective visor caught the light, hidinghis expression.

Brinley gazed straight ahead, her fingertips tapping lightly against the steering wheel, as if measuring timing and angles in her head.

In the stands, the betting frenzy doubled again. Some fans believed Nightblade would win, while others had switched sides, shouting Brinley's name instead.

And then the final began.

A dozen cars exploded off the line like arrowNs from taut strings.

At the very first corner, two cars collided in their fight for the inner lane, sparks flying and drawing gasps from the crowd.

Brinley jerked the wheel sharply, slipping past the wreck with inches to spare.

But Ballard seized the chaos to his advantage, swerving aggressively into her path.

Her white car lurched violently, swaying so close to the safety wall it nearly clipped it.

Colin shot up from his seat, gripping the railing so hard his knuckles whitened. His chest tightened at the sight of Brinley struggling within the chaos.

Never before had he seen her like this-not the quiet, submissive woman who had once stood at his side,but someone fierce, wild, and untamed.

"Why is she forcing herself like this..." he muttered hoarsely, the words dragging out of him unbidden.

Milly heard, and her nails dug deep into her palm, though her face carried feigned concern. "Racing is too dangerous, Colin. Look at this madness. Maybe we should leave before something happens?"

But Colin ignored her completely, his eyes locked on the track.

Memories from the past flooded his mind.

He recalled Brinley once smiling and telling him, "Let's have a baby." And yet, at that very time,he had been wrapped up in Milly's softness, turning cold and dismissive toward Brinley. The sting of that realization cut into him now.

He had pushed away the one-of-a-kind Brinley. Meanwhile,the race raged on. Dominik intentionally blocked Brinley's line on a slow corner, trying to run her wide.

But Brinley downshifted hard, the car skidding at a razor-sharp angle across the asphalt before hugging the inside lane and shooting past him cleanly.

"Beautiful move!" The crowd erupted into their cheers.

Up in the lead pack, Austin's black car held position. In his mirror, he saw the white blur cutting closer and closer.

When Ballard had cut her off earlier, Austin's foot had hovered over the accelerator, ready to break formation and shield her. But then she countered with a flawless rear-wheel drift, fending for herself.

And when Dominik tried to trap her again, he had been about to slow down and intervene, but Brinley's perfectly timed downshift had been smoother than even he'd expected.

Austin's fingers froze on the wheel, his eyes narrowing behind the visor. That fearless cornering angle,that split-second timing on the gear shift, even the precision of her grip...

There was no mistaking it. She moved with the unmistakable flair of Rosara, the racer who had once set the track ablaze.

There was no doubt now-Brinley was Rosara.

With that realization, Austin slammed the accelerator. The black shot ahead-not to win, but to test her limits.

The final entered its last three laps. Only five cars remained on the track.

Brinley had climbed into second, pressing hard at Austin's tail.

Ballard, blinded by rage, veered recklessly on the straight, swiping toward her with the intent of knocking her off.

"Careful!" Colin shouted, his voice hoarse, betraying his concern for Brinley.

Brinley's eyes flew wide, her reaction kicking in almost automatically. She yanked the handbrake, spun the wheel, and sent her car into a perfect sideways drift.

Using the car's inertia, she threaded through the tiny gap between Ballard and the wall.

The movement was so swift it was almost impossible to track. By the time the crowd caught up, Brinley's white car had already slipped past Ballard, now just half a length behind Austin's black car.

"Insane! She's even wilder than Rosara ever was!" Nicolas whooped in the monitoring room, slapping the table with excitement.

Austin felt the pressure mounting from behind and, for the first time that day, smiled faintly.

He pressed harder on the accelerator but deliberately left a sliver of space at the corner.

Not as a mercy, but as a challenge.A chance.

Brinley caught it instantly, seizing the opening without hesitation. Side by side, the black car and the white car tore into the bend together.
###Chapter 97 Brinley Takes First Place


Milly sat in the stands with her gaze locked on Colin, his body pitched forward, every muscle strung tight,his expression carved with raw unease. The sight unsettled her more than she cared to admit.

Her hand drifted protectively to her stomach, brushing over the life inside her-the only card she had left to play.

Losing simply wasn't an option.

On the track, the final lap ignited into a battle of nerves and steel. The black and white cars tore across the asphalt, their engines bellowing like a storm unleashed, the gap between them barely the length of a bumper.

One moment the black car surged ahead, the next the white car reclaimed the lead, their relentless dance whipping the crowd into breathless silence.

Colin's palms grew clammy as the weight of realization settled over him-Brinley had never truly been his

She belonged to the roar of engines, to the wild, untamed freedom of the track.

The finish line loomed ahead, and both Austin and Brinley slammed their accelerators almost in unison, their cars tearing forward in a final burst of speed.

As they crossed the line, Austin's eyes softened, lingering on the white car with quiet affection.

Brinley's glance at the black car beside her carried a storm of emotions.

The precision, the daring edge in that driving-there was no mistaking it. This was Nightblade.

The signal marking the finish echoed through the arena, and the stands erupted in deafening cheers that rattled the walls.

On the massive screen overhead, the names "Nightblade" and "Brinley Moore" flashed side by side at the top, their recorded times identical down to the millisecond. One by one, the remaining cars streaked past the line, but the nearest contender lagged nearly ten seconds behind.

That gulf on the track felt like an unbridgeable canyon, underscoring just how extraordinary the dead heat between the first place truly was.

Brinley unclasped her helmet, pulling it free as the breeze cooled the sweat along her temples. Her eyes immediately found the black car idling just a few paces away.

Austin kept his helmet on, standing still as his gaze lingered on her.

When they reached the podium and paused at the steps, both extended their hands in the ritual of ceremony.

Their palms met, and Brinley's laugh slipped out, light but sure.

"Nightblade?" she asked, lifting her chin to meet the depth of his eyes, her voice edged with certainty.

His thumb traced a deliberate line across her skin, a low chuckle rumbling from his chest. "Looks like we've each been keeping secrets."

In that charged silence, their eyes locked, and words became unnecessary.

Behind the podium, Ballard, Dominik, and the others stood cloaked in shadow, their faces stiff with frustration.

A sea of reporters surged closer, microphones nearly grazing their mouths. "What do you have to say about Brinley's run? Not long ago you claimed she couldn't even drift."

Ballard's lips parted, but no sound came. His throat bobbed as he struggled, sweat glinting at his temples.At last, he forced out in a strangled tone. "She... she just got lucky."

"Lucky?" a reporter pressed, voice sharp, lens zooming in on his flushed face. "Was it luck that let her break through every block you threw at her? Was it luck that put her neck-and-neck with Nightblade at the finish line?"

Dominik opened his mouth to speak, but a sharp tug at his sleeve held him back. The same racers who had mocked Brinley earlier now stared at the ground, their bravado drained,letting the reporters' pointed questions sting like open-handed slaps.

Up in the VIP seats, Milly's knuckles whitened around her phoneas she scrolled through the screen.

The smear campaign she'd orchestrated against Brinley lay exposed-screenshots of burner accounts and comment threads plastered across the live feed.

Watching Brinley's impressive performance, online users who had once mocked her now switched sides.

Even worse, mainstream outlets were blasting real-time headlines that flipped the entire narrative on its head,suffocating Milly with every update.

The headlines that had once taunted Brinley now praised her professional-level racing skills.

Photos captured her in the driver's seat, helmet snug, eyes gleaming with razor-sharp focus.

From the edge of the stage, Colin couldn't tear his gaze away as Brinley and Nightblade lifted the gleaming trophy together.

The spotlight washed across her face, revealing a smile stripped of its usual restraint, shining instead with unshakable confidence.

In that instant, he understood-the woman he'd lost was never a substitute for Milly. What he had let slip through his fingers was Brinley herself, singular and irreplaceable.

When the ceremony drew to a close, reporters surged toward Brinley in a tide of flashing lights and microphones.

"Mrs.Moore, were you and Nightblade acquainted before today?"

"Mrs. Moore, your style behind the wheel resembles that of a retired legend. Did you ever receive formal training?"

Just as Brinley drew breath to respond, Austin appeared, already out of his racing suit, and moved naturally to her side, placing himself between her and the crowd. His voice was calm yet authoritative. "Interviews will be held in the lounge. Please head there." His eyes swept across the gathering before finally resting on Brinley, the corners of his mouth lifting in a private smile that spoke volumes only to her.

She met his look, a faint spark of amusement and understanding passing between them.

Some truths didn't need to be spoken-not yet.

The spotlights fixed on Brinley as she stepped into the conference room. She had traded her racing suit for a crisp white blouse and fitted jeans, her hair casually tied back. Without makeup, she looked effortlessly luminous, more striking than any polished appearance.

"Mrs. Moore, your cornering technique looks professionally trained. Which driver did you study under?" The first reporter leaned so close with the microphone it nearly brushed her lips.

Her smile stayed composed as she answered, voice steady, "I never received professional training. Cars have fascinated me since I was a kid. In my free time, I'd study routes, analyze techniques, and practice where I could. It's always been a personal passion."

Another journalist refused to relent. "But that aggressive dive bomb move you pulled-even professionals hesitate to attempt it. That can't just be chalked up to a personaI passion, can it?"
###Chapter 98 A Dark Horse


Brinley raised her head and gazed at the reporter in front of her. "I think everyone defines passion differently. For me, true joy means throwing myself into something completely."

Her voice was calm and polite, yet there was an unmistakable detachment beneath it. No matter how pointed the reporters' questions became, she navigated them with diplomatic grace.

Not once did she reveal anything about her racing past.

One reporter tried a new approach. "When you and Nightblade stood together for the award earlier, the two of you seemed very comfortable. Do you know him well?"

Brinley took an unhurried sip of water before answering, "Today was the first time we formally met. To be honest, I usually pay more attention to the way cars perform and how tracks change than to people in the industry."

Her subotle reply neither confirmed nor denied anything. It deflected smoothly, leaving no opening for further digging.

Meanwhile, conversations buzzed among the audience.

Someone had pulled up old photos of Brinley from business events and compared them to her performance on the racetrack. "She looks like a completely different person! Off the track she's so gentle, but once she's racing, it's like she transforms."

"She's clearly talented. Still, she's not on par with professionals. Probably because she was lucky enough to be exposed to racing early on, she managed to pick up some unorthodox techniques," another person remarked with a trace of envy.

Online, the hashtag #TalentedRacerBrinley climbed the charts.

No one connected her to Rosara. After all, Rosara was a legend in the world of racing, an international champion with countless awards. Brinley, in contrast, was seen as a dark horse: a real estate developer who exploded onto the scene out of nowhere.

From the lounge window, Austin stood watching as Brinley fielded questions from the press. The cigarette between his fingers remained unlit.

Nicolas walked up beside him, following his line of sight. "She's impressive. How does she even manage to keep it sharp and controlled under that kind of pressure? Most people would have started name-dropping or bragging about minor awards by now."

Austin stayed silent, his mind drifting years back.

When he had been studying abroad, he once stumbled upon a racing video of Rosara.

Those eyes, gleaming with fire behind the helmet, had reminded him of the young Brinley, who had once stood up for him. That was why he had entered the world of racing.

Over time, he had often suspected Brinley and Rosara were one and the same, but he never found proof.

Only today, watching her deliver those flawless techniques on the track, was he certain: Brinley was Rosara.

The woman he had admired since his youth-she was meant to shine, no matter the arena.

"What's got you so deep in thought?" Nicolas nudged him, grinning. "Your eyes haven't left her."

Austin tossed aside the cigarette and started toward the interview area."Nothing."

Just as he reached the doorway, Brinley.wrapped up her inerview and stepped out.

Nicolas's eyes lit up. He rushed forward with an ingratiating smile, his earlier teasing replaced by genuine awe. "Brinley, you have to teach me how to race like that! I'll gladly be your student!"

Brinley blinked in surprise, a laugh tugging at her lips. She was about to respond when Austin appeared,pulling Nicolas back firmly. "Shut up."

"I'm serious!" Nicolas insisted. "Her driving was unbelievable!"

Brinley's eyes softened with amusement at their exchange. Turning to Nicolas, she said warmly, "You're too kind, Mr. Gomez. I was just lucky today."

"Lucky? You think luck is enough to beat him?" Nicolas jabbed a finger toward Austin. "Do you have any idea? He's never been beaten-not once!"

One cold stare from Austin silenced him instantly.

Brinley glanced at Austin then, remembering the look they had shared at the award ceremony, a gentle smile parting her lips.

Suddenly, a broad, warm hand settled firmly on her shoulder.

Austin drew her close, his eyes icy as they locked on Nicolas. "That's enough. Can't you see she's exhausted?"

The menace in his eyes made Nicolas falter. His earlier excitement fizzled under Austin's stare, and he backed down quickly, rubbing the back of his neck. "Fine, fine. I'll stop. You two rest; l'll go check on the cars."

With that, he practically bolted.

Brinley could feel the heat of Austin's palm on her shoulder, and the sense of his possessiveness was impossible to miss.

She turned her head slightly, meeting his eyes.

The aloofness he had shown just minutes ago had melted into a faint smile.

"You kind of just scared your friend there," she muttered, though she couldn't hide her own smile.

Austin only arched a brow, his grip tightening rather than loosening. "Sometimes the direct approach is the only way with insensitive people like him. Or would you rather he keep hovering around?"

His breath was warm against her ear, his voice deliberately close.

Brinley's ears flushed red, and she edged away just slightly. "Stop it."

Seeing the color in her cheeks, Austin grinned. He didn't push further, but he didn't let go either. Side by side, they returned to the lounge.

In the VIP stand, the air was taut and tense.

Colin's eyes stayed locked on the screen, watching the replay of Brinley crossing the finish line.

Her smile shone brighter than anything else in the arena. The precision of her turns, the steadiness she held under pressure, the confidence she carried after victory...

Each image pierced deep into him, striking his heart with overwhelming force.
###Chapter 99 How Could You Be So Heartless


Colin averted his gaze, struck by this unfamiliar side of Brinley-bold and razor-sharp, a spark he had never witnessed when they were together.

"Colin, isn't Mrs. Moore incredible?" Milly purred, pressing close to him with a syrupy voice. "But racing is so risky. Wouldn't it be nicer to live quietly at homne? Well, all I know is how to look after you."

She lingered on "look after you," subtly suggesting she was his true match.

Colin only gave a nod, his eyes locked on the screen.

Milly's nails bit into her palm. Her meticulously laid plans had unraveled-her smear campaign against Brinley backfired.

Damn it! Now Colin couldn't stop thinking about Brinley!

Jealousy seared through Milly, threatening to unravel her composure. She stood abruptly, muttering,"1"m heading to the restroom."

Colin didn't acknowledge her, and Milly stormed off, lips pressed tight, her silhouette radiating contained rage.

Knowing Brinley would likely visit the lounge post-race, Milly loitered in the corridor, checking her reflection on her phone.

Her face projected delicate innocence, but her mind churned with plans to deliver biting words in the softest tone.

In the corridor's dim glow, Brinley stepped out of the lounge, only to find Milly blocking her way.

"Congratulations, Mrs. Moore,"Milly said with a sweet smile. "I couldn't bear to watch your thrilling race earlier. It's so dangerous for a woman to do such things-what if you got hurt?"

Her mocking words barely landed when a group of young fans in school uniforms rounded the corner, shouting,"Brinley!"

A boy, caught up in the excitement, accidentally knocked into Milly as he rushed forward.

Milly stumbled and twisted her ankle, collapsing with a hand on her stomach, her face paling dramatically.

"Someone has fallen!"

"She's pregnant!"

The crowd exploded into chaos.

Milly shivered in pain but fixed a calculating glance on Brinley, quickly overtaken by feigned agony.

Biting her lip, she whispered, "It's fine... it's not Mrs. Moore's fault... just an accident..."

Her words slyly implicated Brinley.

Brinley frowned at Milly.

Four months pregnant was a delicate stage, but the fall seemed too convenient, almost staged.

With no time to dwell, she dialed emergency services, stating clearly, , "City racetrack. A four-mont pregnant woman has abdominal pain after a collision. She needs urgent help."

Onlookers buzzed with murmurs.

"One is Colin's ex, the other is his current girlfriend..."

"A fight over him, maybe?"

Milly caught the murmurs, a faint smirk forming as she played up her distress.

The ambulance screeched in just as Colin arrived, fresh from watching the award ceremony, his chest tigh with frustration. He had wanted to talk to Brinley, but was met with this mess.

Seeing Milly on the ground with a trace of blood beneath her, his pulse raced.

"Milly!" He knelt beside her, his voice shaking. Milly's eyes welled up as she grabbed his hand weakly, shaking her head. "Don't blame Mrs. Moore... it wasn't her fault..."

Colin's gaze snapped to Brinley, brimming with accusation.

Brinley met his stare, unflinching. "The ambulance is almost here. Get her to the hospital."

Stung by her indifference, Colin nearly snapped back, but medics arrived with a stretcher.

As Milly was lifted, she murmured to him, "Colin... don't be upset...

Watching the ambulance speed off, Colin's fists clenched as he turned to Brinley, voice sharp. "How could you be so heartless? I can't believe you'd hurt a pregnant woman."

Brinley's brow lifted, her tone edged with disdain. "Use your head, Colin. Ask the witnesses what actually happened."

Speechless, Colin watched her walk away, a piece of him feeling torn apart.

In the hospital's VIP ward, Milly lay pale on the bed.

The doctor had just left, assuring that the baby was safe but emphasizing Milly's need for rest.

Colin sat beside her, observing her delicate condition, haunted by the doctor's warning. "Ten more minutes,and we might have lost him." The memory of the family's elation upon learning it was a boy intensified the guilt surging through him like a flood.

"Colin..." Milly's eyes fluttered open, her voice barely a whisper. "I'm so sorry... for causing you worry..."

"Don't say anything, just focus on resting," Colin cut in, his voice gentler now.

Yet Milly clung to his hand, tears streaming like shattered pearls. "Don't hold it against Mrs. Moore.It's not her doing... I'm to blame... not careful enough..."

Her voice grew more plaintive, tears flowing unchecked. "I know you still have feelings for her... but I need you, and our baby needs you too."

Her gentle words pierced deeply, tightening Colin's chest with guilt. Gazing at her rounded belly and tear-streaked face, he let out a heavy sigh. "I'm not going anywhere.I'll stay right here."

A glint of cunning triumph flashed in Milly's eyes, swiftly veiled by her practiced frailty as she nodded meekly, resting against his shoulder.

In the end, she had won. Colin chose to stay with her.
###Chapter 100 Give Me Three Days


In the shadowed parking lot, Austin held the car door open for Brinley.

His tone was calm, but the chill in his eyes betrayed him. "Colin looked like he was ready to tear you apart with his glare."

"He's irrelevant to me now. Whatever he feels, it doesn't touch me anymore." Brinley eased into the passenger seat, buckling her belt with brisk, precise motions.

Austin turned the ignition, his eyes flicking sideways to study her.

Her face was serene as she stared out the window, but he reached over suddenly, brushing his hand through her hair with quiet tenderness. "Don't waste your peace on people who don't matter."

The warmth of his palm sank into her scalp, softening the weight inher chest.

She swiveled toward him, catching the playful glimmer in his gaze.

"Why are you staring at me?" she asked, her brows lifting.

"Nothing." His hand slipped back to the wheel, though a faint curve lingered at his mouth. "Just realizing got excellent taste."

Brinley's chest gave a small flutter, and she angled her face toward the window, trying to hide the faint curve of a smile tugging at her lips.

The sleek luxury car slipped effortlessly away from the racetrack, its hum blending with the hush inside the cabin.

Her eyes tracked the guardrails flashing past, her thoughts wandering as silence pressed in.

Austin's voice slid through the quiet, casual but edged with curiosity."What's on your mind?"

She pulled her gaze back, the faintest trace of irony tugging at her mouth. "I was thinking about what just happened.Milly's victim act was embarrassingly unconvincing."

Austin let out a low laugh, steering them onto a narrow,shaded road.

Golden light slipped between the branches, painting the glass with broken patches of brightness.

"Colin isn't stupid-he's just tied to her because she is carrying his son."

Austin cast her a quick look, approval flickering in his eyes. "But you didn't fall into that trap. Smart of you."

Brinley let out a short laugh, tilting her head with disdain. Her smile curved into something sharper as she lifted an eyebrow at him. "You knew I was Rosara from the beginning, didn't you?"

Austin's hand faltered on the wheel before he answered honestly, "That last corner-you handled it exactly the way Rosara did back then."

Brinley narrowed her eyes. "And yet you still played along, acting like you were clueless while testing me?"

"Well, I wanted to give you the chance to admit it yourself," Austin said with a low, amused chuckle. His gaze sharpened. "And you? When did you realize I was Nightblade?"

"When you let me pass those two cars on purpose." Brinley locked eyes with him, her lips curving into a confident smile. "Nightblade's stye is distinct. Back then, I studied his footage over and over."

Her words seemed to hang in the stillness of the car. The only sound between them was the rhythm of their breathing, and in that silence an unspoken connection pulsed, undeniable.

Austin eased the car to the roadside and stopped. With a deliberate motion, he unfastened his seatbelt and leaned toward her. "Now that everything's out in the open... will you let me into your heart, Brinley?"

Her pulse stuttered. Instinct told her to pull back, but his warm palm slid to cradle the backof her neck,grounding her.

"Brinley," he murmured, voice low and resolute. "Stop avoiding me."

Brinley's breath caught, her fingers curling into the leather seat beneath her.

Austin's nearness wrapped around her like heat, leaving her pulse unsteady. She turned her face aside, dodging his piercing gaze, and managed in a trembling voice, "Austin, give me three days."

His hand stilled, easing from the back of her neck with reluctant gentleness.Though expectation dimmed in his eyes, the lingering warmth never faded. "Alright."

Lifting her chin, Brinley met his gaze with quiet resolve. "I need those three days to think it through. Our past lives and present feelings are too tangled. I can't let impulse decide for me." Her lips pressed together before she added softly, "When the three days are up, I'll give you my answer."

Austin's gaze lingered on her, catching the unwavering determination in her eyes. At last, he gave a small nod and reached over, his fingers combing gently through her windswept hair. "Then I'll wait for you," he said softly.

The brush of his fingertips against her ear made Brinley jerk away as if the touch had burned.

Amusement flickered in Austin's eyes, and he let out a low chuckle as he drew his hand back, snapping his seatbelt into place. The engine purred to life, his voice calm and measured once more."Shall I take you back to your office?"

"Okay," Brinley answered softly, her gaze shifting toward the windoW.

The car slipped seamlessly into the flow of traffic, and the fragile spark that had hovered between them faded into silence-yet its aftertaste clung stubbornly, pressing itself into both their hearts.

Brinley's gaze followed the retreating streets, her thoughts tangled in restless knots.

She had finally admitted the truth to herself-she wasn't just used to Austin's presence; she had already fallen for him.

This was nothing like the gentle affection she once felt for Colin. With Austin, it burned fiercer, more intoxicating, Jike fire under her skin.

And that very intensity made her falter at the edge of the next step.

What if she chose wrong again?
