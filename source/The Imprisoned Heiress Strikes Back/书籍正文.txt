###Chapter 1: Freedom's Bitter Taste

"Evelyn, try to make something of yourself out there." The correctional officer's voice was flat as he swung the heavy gate open.

Evelyn Carter barely nodded. Three agonizing years. She'd survived when she wasn't sure she wanted to.

Cold rain needled her skin as she stepped beyond the prison walls. The wind sliced through her thin clothes, and she wrapped her arms around herself, trembling.

Then tires hissed against wet pavement.

A black Porsche 911 glided to a stop beside her.

Her stomach dropped when she recognized the license plate.

The tinted window lowered, revealing Ethan Caldwell's sharp, unreadable expression—the man she'd loved since she was sixteen, her former fiancé.

The same man who'd orchestrated her imprisonment.

"Why are you favoring your left leg?" His voice was like winter.

Evelyn's throat tightened. Did he really not know? From her first night in prison, the other inmates had targeted her. Whispers said Ethan had paid them to break her.

"Get in." He didn’t raise his voice, but the command was absolute. His tailored suit accentuated his broad shoulders, his presence radiating icy authority.

That tone—it reminded her of her parents.

At fourteen, Evelyn had been brought back to the Hayes family. For a brief moment, they’d seemed remorseful, eager to reconnect. But Vanessa, the daughter they’d raised in her absence, had poisoned them against her. Slowly, surely, they’d pushed Evelyn away.

By twenty-one, Vanessa had fabricated a story so vile that even Evelyn’s own parents believed she’d tried to kill her.

"Vanessa may not be our blood, but she’s our daughter in every way that matters. We gave you a home, a life. What more do you want?"

"Evelyn, how could you? Vanessa is refined. You’re nothing like her."

No one had listened. No one had cared.

Not even Ethan.

His gaze remained fixed on her. When she didn’t move, his patience snapped. "I won’t ask again."

His eyes flicked to the jagged scar circling her ankle—a wound from a smuggled razor. A souvenir from hell.

He looked away. "Nathan."

His assistant, Nathan Reeves, stepped out and approached her. "Ms. Carter, Mr. Caldwell expects you in the car."

When she still hesitated, Nathan reached for her arm.

Evelyn flinched violently, dropping into a defensive crouch, arms shielding her head. "Please—don’t—"

Nathan froze. The woman before him was a ghost of the vibrant girl he remembered. Her once-luminous eyes were hollow, her spirit crushed.

Three years had erased her.

He glanced back at Ethan, but his employer’s expression didn’t waver.

"Evelyn," Ethan said coolly, "prison clearly didn’t teach you obedience."

She forced herself up and slid into the car, pressing herself against the far door.

Warm air blasted from the vents, but she couldn’t stop shaking. Her head throbbed, and despite clamping her jaw, a sneeze escaped.

The car jerked over a pothole, sending her sprawling onto the floor.

Ethan’s eyes snapped open at the thud.

He looked down at her, lips curling. "Pathetic."

The leather seat burned beneath her knees. She scrambled back, murmuring, "I’ll—I’ll clean it."

"Don’t bother." His voice was sharp. "It’s trash now."

A bitter realization twisted inside her. Because I touched it. Her hands balled into fists.

To him, she was contamination.

"Only Vanessa is pure enough for you, isn’t she?"

Ethan’s expression darkened. "You lost the right to speak her name." He leaned closer, voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "Cross her again, and prison will seem merciful."
###Chapter 2: The Cruel Revelation

Evelyn's face drained of color, her once-vibrant eyes turning dull. Those three torturous years should have been enough to open her eyes.

She inhaled sharply, struggling to contain the tempest of emotions raging within her, her nails digging into her palms.

As the car glided beneath an overpass, the flickering light painted shifting shadows across Ethan's face, accentuating his unyielding coldness.

Swallowing the bitterness rising in her throat, Evelyn forced out the question burning inside her. "Ethan... Did you pay those inmates to torment me?"

Behind bars, she had shattered countless times, even contemplating ending it all.

But she couldn't bring herself to let go of Ethan. She feared he wouldn’t survive without her.

She never imagined he could be this merciless.

Ethan's reply was ice-cold. "What answer are you hoping for?"

Evelyn stiffened, then let out a hollow laugh.

Was that his way of admitting it?

To him, she was nothing but a jealous woman who had orchestrated Vanessa’s kidnapping, nearly leading to her assault.

The evidence had been overwhelming, leaving Evelyn defenseless.

Vanessa had been ruthless enough to sacrifice her own reputation—and she had won.

Suddenly, Evelyn realized how absurd her seven years of devotion had been.

Her gaze turned vacant as the car halted in front of what used to be their home.

She had poured her heart into this house—every renovation, every piece of furniture, even the placement of the flowerpots. She had painted the walls herself.

She had spent endless nights dreaming of a future here with Ethan.

Now, the house was littered with Vanessa's belongings.

Evelyn’s chest tightened as if pierced by needles. Her lips paled from how hard she bit them, her heart turning to stone.

Ethan ignored her anguish. He turned to the maid and ordered, "She reeks. Clean her up."

The maid nodded and guided Evelyn to the bathroom.

Inside, the maid wrinkled her nose. "Miss, when was the last time you bathed? You should take better care of yourself."

Easy for you to say when you weren’t beaten daily in prison. But Evelyn stayed silent.

Once the maid left, she locked the door and scrubbed her skin raw for an hour.

The scars from prison still clung to her.

For three years, she had endured relentless torment. Though the last month had brought some reprieve, her wounds hadn’t healed.

Some were hidden—bruises, scratches, jagged gashes.

The prison had offered no medical care, leaving injuries to fester. The worst was the deep scar on her left foot, which ached with every storm, a cruel reminder of her suffering.

Whenever the pain flared, Evelyn repeated to herself that it would fade—eventually.

Stepping out of the shower, she slipped into the fresh clothes the maid had left. They fit perfectly.

But the moment she opened the door, she collided with Ethan.

She staggered, nearly falling back.

His hand shot out, gripping her waist to steady her.

The contact sent a jolt through them both.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked as she found herself pressed against his chest, the scent of tobacco clinging to him.

She quickly pulled away, putting distance between them.

Trying to sound composed, she murmured, "I’m sorry, sir. I didn’t mean to—"

Noticing the cigarette in Ethan’s hand, she realized he must have been on his way outside when they crossed paths.

His eyes darkened. "What did you just call me?" His voice was dangerously low. "What game are you playing now, Evelyn?"

She bit her lip, fighting back the sting of tears.

It seemed no matter what she did, he would always see her as deceitful.

Ethan’s jaw tightened as he brought the cigarette to his lips.

He refused to acknowledge how her sudden absence left him feeling hollow.

And those teary eyes of hers—they ignited something primal in him, a violent urge he had to suppress.

Lighting the cigarette with a flick of impatience, he exhaled sharply. "Three years in prison, and all you’ve learned is how to seduce men better?"

A mocking smirk curled his lips. "That desperate?"
###Chapter 3: Silent Whispers

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she clutched the fabric of her sleeves, her knuckles turning white.

Why did Ethan have to reject her so cruelly? Worse, why humiliate her in front of everyone?

After a shaky breath, she lifted her chin and met his gaze, forcing a brittle smile. "Ethan, my feelings for you don’t give you the right to treat me like this."

For a fleeting moment, Ethan faltered. That smile—once so radiant—now looked like a ghost of its former self.

His eyes lingered on her face a second too long before he caught himself. But by then, Evelyn had already turned away.

He loosened his tie with an irritated flick of his wrist and crushed his cigarette underfoot.

Something about her had changed.

Not that he cared, of course. But the woman who used to light up every room she entered now seemed... hollow.

It shouldn’t bother him. Yet an uneasy sensation coiled in his chest.

Ethan shoved the feeling aside and reminded her coldly, "Tonight is Vanessa’s birthday. I’ll take you back to Hawthorne Estate, but don’t embarrass me. Vanessa isn’t like you."

The words cut deeper than she expected.

To him, Vanessa was priceless. She? Not even worth the air she breathed.

An hour later, Nathan ushered Evelyn into a sleek black car.

At Hawthorne Estate, the grand hall glittered with Cresthaven’s elite.

Though Vanessa wasn’t Richard’s biological daughter, her birthdays were always extravagant affairs—a display of the Hayes family’s power and their unwavering support for her.

Every influential name in the city had been invited.

Clusters of socialites murmured behind their champagne flutes, trading the latest gossip.

"Why does Richard dote on Vanessa so much? She’s not even his blood," one woman mused.

"Talent matters more than lineage in our world," another replied smoothly. "I heard she closed three major deals in six months. Richard promoted her to VP—clearly grooming her as his successor."

"But where did she even come from? What about her real parents?"

A third woman lowered her voice. "No one knows. Margaret Hayes was supposed to be her mother, but the DNA test proved otherwise."

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms.

She still didn’t understand. If Vanessa wasn’t Margaret’s child, why had she been swapped in the first place?

No one had answers. Only the result remained: Evelyn was sent back, while Vanessa’s origins stayed shrouded in mystery.

The Hayes family had raised Vanessa for over twenty years, treating her better than their own.

A few socialites glanced in Evelyn’s direction, their stares sharp with curiosity.

Feeling exposed, she ducked her head and slipped out of the hall.

As she disappeared, one woman frowned. "Was that... Evelyn?"

Her companion scoffed. "Evelyn? Please. She used to be stunning. That woman looked like she hadn’t eaten in months."

Once, Evelyn had been unforgettable. Now, she was a shadow.

Unaware of the whispers, Evelyn reached the second floor. She paused outside her old room when voices froze her in place.

"Ethan, is it true? Evelyn’s back?"

"Wait, she was in prison? Since when?"

The Hayes family had buried the scandal. Officially, Evelyn had been "studying abroad"—Richard’s doing.

Ethan shot Trevor a warning glare.

Trevor winced. "My bad. I meant abroad. Obviously."

Another man exhaled a plume of smoke, amused. "Trevor, you’re losing it."

Trevor forced a laugh. "Cut me some slack."

The man turned to Ethan. "So, with Evelyn back, things must be interesting. Weren’t you two engaged three years ago? Planning a wedding?"

Evelyn’s hand hovered over the doorknob.

Inside, the clink of poker chips filled the silence.

Trevor grinned. "Engaged? Please. Marriage is just a leash. Ethan doesn’t do leashes."
###Chapter 4: The Price of Devotion

The other man chuckled, swirling his drink. "But Evelyn's absolutely stunning, isn't she? That face, that body—she'd make any man look good. Having her as an arm candy wouldn't be the worst fate."

He smirked at Ethan, tossing a chip onto the poker table. "Ethan, you're seriously just going to hand her over like that?"

Ethan barely glanced up, his voice dripping with indifference. "Take her if you want. She's yours."

The man blinked, unsure if Ethan was joking or dead serious. He let out an awkward laugh.

"Come on, man. Everyone knows Evelyn's been obsessed with you for years. She followed you like a lost puppy. Guess I'm not that lucky."

Outside the door, Evelyn froze, her fingers tightening around the doorknob. A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

It was no secret she loved Ethan. But hearing him casually discard her like last season's fashion? That cut deeper than any knife.

Humiliation burned through her, hot and suffocating. Her vision blurred with unshed tears as her nails dug into her palms.

She remembered being fourteen—fresh from a small town, thrust into the glittering cruelty of Cresthaven.

Her father, Richard Hayes, had enrolled her in the most prestigious academy, hoping for a fresh start.

But Vanessa Hart had other plans.

One winter night, during a vicious snowstorm, they locked Evelyn in an outdoor bathroom stall.

She screamed until her throat was raw, her fingers numb from clawing at the door. No one came.

Then—he did.

Even now, she could see it perfectly: the blizzard howling behind him, his uniform jacket flapping open, his dark hair plastered to his forehead.

The dim light hid his expression, but she remembered the way he'd ripped off his scarf and tossed it at her without a word.

"Here. Take it."

Then he was gone, leaving her shivering in the snow.

To fourteen-year-old Evelyn, seventeen-year-old Ethan Caldwell had been a god. Her first savior.

For seven years, she'd loved him. Chased him.

Now? She was just another bargaining chip.

Swallowing the lump in her throat, she pulled out her phone and dialed a long-forgotten number.

Before it could connect, a voice cut through the hallway.

"Evelyn? You're back?"

She ended the call and turned.

Her mother, Margaret Hayes, stood there, eyebrows raised. "When did you get out?"

How poetic.

Margaret remembered Vanessa's birthday but forgot her own daughter's release date.

"You look terrible," Margaret said, wrinkling her nose as she eyed Evelyn's gaunt frame. "Prison did you some good, though. Taught you humility. Your father and I have forgiven your... indiscretions. Now hurry—change into something decent. It's your sister's birthday."

Then, as an afterthought: "Oh, right. Your old room is a home theater now. Use Vanessa's. The maid will bring you a dress."

Evelyn was shoved into Vanessa's bedroom. The moment the door closed, the cloying scent of vanilla and roses hit her like a brick.

She barely made it to the ensuite before retching.

Footsteps approached outside. The maid, no doubt, with the obligatory "birthday sister" dress.

Evelyn splashed water on her face, her reflection pale and hollow-eyed in the mirror.

When she emerged, the maid was waiting, gaze flickering to Evelyn's still-heaving stomach.

"I'm not pregnant," Evelyn said flatly. "Tell Vanessa to save the theatrics."

The maid flushed. "I didn't mean—Madam is waiting downstairs. Don't keep her."

Evelyn knew this party wasn't for her. The "happy twins" narrative was just another lie in the Hayes family circus.

Too nauseated to play along, she slipped into the kitchen instead, picking at a fruit platter.

She'd barely taken two bites when the maid reappeared.

"Miss Evelyn! Madam insists you join the guests!"

Evelyn took her time chewing. "I'm not feeling well."

The maid gaped. "But—it would look very bad if you and Ms. Vanessa aren't seen together tonight!"

Evelyn smirked. "Since when have Vanessa and I ever been seen together?"

Before the flustered maid could respond, Evelyn pushed past her—only to freeze at the scene in the grand hall.

Vanessa, resplendent in champagne silk, was raising a glass of wine to her lips—

When a shrill voice cut through the chatter:

"Ms. Vanessa! Don't drink that! It's poisoned!"
###Chapter 5: The Setup Repeats

"What?"

Vanessa Hart looked up, startled. Her delicate fingers trembled around the stem of her wine glass. "What are you talking about?"

The maid cast a nervous glance at Evelyn Carter before whispering, "I saw Ms. Hart slip into the kitchen earlier. She put something in your drink—it looked like some kind of powder."

A chilling silence fell over the room.

The memory of Vanessa’s kidnapping three years ago flashed through everyone’s minds. She had been drugged then too.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. Her grip on her glass faltered, and it slipped from her fingers, shattering on the marble floor.

The sharp sound drew the attention of the party guests. Curious eyes turned toward them.

Vanessa’s lips quivered as she turned to Margaret Hayes, her voice barely above a whisper. "Mom… I’m so scared."

Margaret’s protective instincts flared. She pulled Vanessa close, stroking her hair. "It’s okay, sweetheart. That’s all behind us now."

Then, her gaze hardened as she turned to Evelyn. "Still playing these games?"

Though Margaret didn’t outright accuse Evelyn in front of everyone, the implication was clear.

Vanessa was trying to frame her—again.

Evelyn nearly laughed at the absurdity. "It wasn’t me."

Her eyes flicked to the decanter of white wine—Vanessa’s favorite. Of course, it had been prepared just for her. This whole thing was staged.

"I went to the kitchen, yes, but only to grab something to eat. I didn’t touch her drink."

The maid, however, stood her ground. "I saw you add something to it. I swear on my life!"

Her dramatic declaration sent murmurs rippling through the crowd.

Margaret’s face tightened. Family scandals were meant to stay behind closed doors.

Vanessa, ever the peacemaker, gave a shaky smile. "Mom, I’m sure it’s just a misunderstanding. Evelyn wouldn’t do something like that again. She’s changed."

Her words sent a fresh wave of whispers through the room.

Most guests had believed Evelyn was studying abroad—not serving time in prison.

Vanessa’s eyes widened in feigned horror, as if she’d just realized her slip. "Oh! I—I didn’t mean… I must be drunk. Ignore me."

But the damage was done.

The way she fumbled only made it more obvious—there was truth to her words.

Desperate to shift focus, Vanessa brightened. "Evelyn! Since you just got back, I have a special birthday gift for you. Want to see it?"

Upstairs, Ethan Caldwell heard the commotion and descended, only to find Vanessa looking fragile and Evelyn standing stiffly, surrounded by judgmental stares.

Vanessa’s eyes were red-rimmed, her hands clasped pleadingly.

Evelyn met her gaze.

This was nothing new. Vanessa had always been the perfect victim, no matter how many times she orchestrated these schemes.

But this time, Evelyn was done playing along.

If Vanessa wanted to ruin her life, maybe it was time to drag them all down together.
###Chapter 6: Unearthing Old Wounds

"Yes, I served time." Evelyn's gaze swept across the room before settling on Vanessa.

Vanessa reached for her hand. "Evelyn, stop saying that. I spoke without thinking, okay?"

Evelyn recoiled, pulling her hand away sharply.

Then, Vanessa stumbled on the hem of her dress and crashed to the floor.

The impact was brutal—shattered glass from an earlier accident still littered the ground.

Ethan rushed forward, shoving through the crowd to help Vanessa up.

Her palm was a mess of blood and embedded shards.

Ethan's eyes burned with fury as he glared at Evelyn. "Evelyn, when will you ever change? I warned you—"

Evelyn's heart clenched. She knew Ethan didn’t care about her, but watching him shield another woman still stung.

"What did I do? I just pulled away. She fell on her own."

Seeing their hands entwined, Evelyn felt a bitter irony twist inside her. Her fingers brushed the pendant resting against her chest—a relic from a past she couldn’t forget.

In prison, during those endless nights of despair, that pendant had been her only anchor.

When she lifted her head again, her eyes were ice.

A humorless smile curved her lips. "Yes, I was in prison. But I was framed."

Margaret paled at the admission.

At first, when Vanessa exposed Evelyn’s past, Margaret had suspected it was deliberate.

But watching Vanessa apologize and try to backtrack, she dismissed it as an accident.

She’d known Vanessa since childhood—surely, she wasn’t capable of such cruelty.

Desperate to defuse the situation, Margaret intervened. "Evelyn, you’ve had too much to drink. Let someone take you upstairs."

Evelyn ignored her, her voice steady.

"Three years ago, if I’d really kidnapped Vanessa, I could’ve made her vanish without a trace. Why leave evidence for you to find her?"

A sharp crack echoed through the room.

Richard had emerged from his study, his expression thunderous.

"Enough, Evelyn!" he snapped.

Her cheek burned, but she didn’t flinch.

"Vanessa barely had a scratch. If those men wanted to hurt her, why wait? Why take her to some abandoned warehouse? None of it makes sense."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Whispers spread like wildfire as guests darted glances at Vanessa, who bit her lip, her face ghostly pale.

Richard was livid. This scandal had been buried for years—now Evelyn was dragging it into the light, turning their family into a spectacle.

One daughter in prison, the other nearly assaulted—all because of a sisterly feud. It was the kind of gossip high society thrived on.

Tears streamed down Vanessa’s face, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

Evelyn let out a cold laugh. Too fragile to handle the truth?

Compared to what she’d endured, this was nothing.

Margaret shot Evelyn a warning look, silently pleading for her to stop. Three years ago, they’d sent Evelyn to prison to "teach her a lesson"—she’d refused to admit guilt, and they’d deemed her beyond redemption.

Sometimes, Margaret wondered if they’d gone too far. Evelyn was still her daughter.

But Vanessa had insisted—being a Hayes would protect her in prison. They’d believed it was the only way to straighten her out before she spiraled beyond saving.

Margaret had agreed, reluctantly.

Evelyn had been raised by Camille, who’d also raised a reckless, gambling son.

With that influence, they’d thought drastic measures were necessary.

"Why dredge this up now?" Margaret hissed. "Can’t you see Vanessa is upset?"

Evelyn’s smile turned mocking. "Right. I went to prison for her, and she’s the one crying."

She bent down, lifting her dress to reveal a jagged scar on her ankle. The room erupted in horrified murmurs.

"But who cares if I’m hurting?"

Her fingers traced the raised flesh.

The damp air made it ache, but she was used to the pain.

"I’ve always wondered who paid those inmates to torment me. I have dozens of scars. Want to see them all?"

They’d blamed Ethan, but Evelyn didn’t believe it. Tonight, she’d force the truth into the open.

The sight of her scar sent a ripple of sympathy through the room. These privileged women had never known such suffering.

"Was it you?" Evelyn’s gaze flicked to Richard and Margaret, then to Vanessa. "Or you?"

Finally, her eyes locked onto Ethan.
###Chapter 7: Shattered Illusions

The moment Ethan Caldwell witnessed Evelyn Carter reveal her scar to the crowd, something twisted deep within him.

Her indifference cut like a blade.

For years, Evelyn had loved him unconditionally, devoted every part of herself to him. He had grown accustomed to it—had taken her devotion for granted.

"Evelyn, please stop. If it means so much to you, I'll step aside." Vanessa Hart's voice trembled as she pressed a hand to her forehead. "This is all my fault. I never should have stayed with the Hayes family. I should have died the day I was taken three years ago."

"But your suffering in prison—that wasn't my doing, nor our parents'. Prisons are full of monsters. You were hurt because you ended up there."

Vanessa's eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her composure barely holding.

"Ethan, you shouldn’t have saved me. Death would have been kinder."

With those words, she absolved herself of any responsibility for Evelyn’s torment.

Evelyn's stare was glacial. "People who truly want to die don’t just talk about it."

"Evelyn!"

Ethan’s jaw tightened as he shielded Vanessa, squeezing her hand before turning back to Evelyn. "I warned you to behave. Do you understand the consequences of what you’ve done today?"

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn’s lips.

She had exposed her deepest wound, and to him, it was nothing more than a tantrum.

"Yes, I’m making a scene. But you’re my fiancé. Shouldn’t you stand by me? Ethan, how can you defend another woman in front of me?"

Her words struck like lightning, forcing the crowd to reassess everything.

From the start, Ethan had been Vanessa’s shield.

For three years, whispers had circulated—hints of something improper.

Lately, whenever Horizon Enterprises bid on a project, Hawthorne Estate’s proposals mysteriously appeared, with Vanessa spearheading them.

In business, coincidences happened—but this frequency was no accident.

Since Vanessa and Evelyn were sisters, society dismissed the implications. Appearances mattered more than scandalous truths.

But Evelyn’s accusation made the pieces click.

The idea of Ethan and Vanessa’s betrayal—straight out of a tawdry drama—was exactly the kind of salacious intrigue the elite thrived on.

Among the wealthy, gossip was currency, and this was a rare, priceless scandal.

Evelyn gave Vanessa a mocking smile. "I’m already a Hayes by blood. Do I really need you to gift me the title?"

Her voice cracked, her eyes burning with unshed tears.

Then, something inside her snapped.

She strode to the decanter, snatched it up, and challenged, "So you think I drugged you?"

Tilting it back, she swallowed a harsh gulp, liquor spilling down her chin and staining her dress. "Fine. If I did it, I’ll drink it myself. Happy now?"

The burn seared her throat.

She took another swig before hurling the decanter at Vanessa.

Glass shattered.

Shards scattered like broken promises.

And in that moment—Evelyn shattered too.
###Chapter 8: The Broken Promise

Evelyn's phone vibrated silently in her pocket.

She didn't notice the three missed calls.

Margaret saw and paled instantly.

Watching Evelyn down the drink, she feared poison—feared her daughter might drop dead right there.

Panicked, Margaret ordered someone to call 911.

Then, a kitchen maid rushed forward. "I added something to Ms. Vanessa Hart's drink. She said she felt faint, so I mixed in vitamins."

The maid bore an uncanny resemblance to Evelyn. The misunderstanding became painfully clear.

But the chaos wasn't over.

Evelyn suddenly seized Vanessa's wrist and yanked her toward the grand staircase.

Her movements were wild, unhinged—like madness had taken hold.

Vanessa struggled, but when she saw Ethan Caldwell sprinting after them—

The idea struck her suddenly. Evelyn followed Vanessa up the staircase, her heart pounding.

"What are you doing? Vanessa, if you want to ruin yourself, do it alone! Let go!" Ethan's voice was sharp as he grabbed Vanessa and yanked her back.

His icy stare locked onto Evelyn.

Then, he froze.

Tears streamed down Evelyn's cheeks.

A flicker of unease twisted in his chest before shock swallowed it whole.

At the top of the stairs, as Evelyn and Vanessa struggled, Evelyn suddenly lost her balance.

She was so light—just a small push sent her tumbling backward.

Ethan could have caught her. His hand even twitched forward.

But then Vanessa cried out.

His attention snapped to her, and by the time he turned back—

Too late.

Evelyn's injured ankle gave out completely.

In that split second, as Ethan chose Vanessa over her, something inside Evelyn shattered.

The fall was merciless. Her body slammed against the metal railings, each impact sending waves of pain through her skull.

Yet she bit her lip, refusing to make a sound.

She deserved this.

Loving Ethan had been her mistake. Now, she was paying for it.

As she hit the ground, a cold clarity settled over her.

The crowd erupted into chaos, scrambling to call an ambulance while Evelyn lay motionless.

Margaret rushed forward, panic in her eyes, but Evelyn weakly pushed her away.

After a moment, Evelyn forced herself up.

Her vision swam, but she stayed silent, swallowing the pain.

This was nothing new. Three years in prison had taught her how to suffer quietly.

Her gaze, once warm and tender, now held a chilling detachment—as if Ethan were nothing more than a stranger.

Ethan noticed the shift but dismissed it.

He assumed her coldness was just anger over his failure to—

Evelyn could feel her pulse hammering in her throat as she fought to keep her composure. She had always been the strong one—the one who didn’t need coddling or empty reassurances. But tonight, the weight of betrayal was too heavy to carry alone.

The birthday party had ended abruptly, the guests scattering like startled birds after the confrontation. Now, only the hollow silence of the Hawthorne Estate remained.

As the last car pulled away, Evelyn finally let the tears fall.

"I'm breaking off the engagement."

The words sliced through the quiet like a blade.

Richard and Margaret froze, their expressions twisting in shock.

"What did you just say?" Richard's voice was sharp, edged with disbelief.

Evelyn clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She forced herself to speak again, louder this time. "I'm calling it off. Ethan and Vanessa deserve each other. I won't stand in their way."

Richard's face darkened. "Have you lost your mind, Evelyn? You can't just throw away years of planning like this! Do you honestly think you can walk away unscathed?"

Margaret reached for her daughter, but Evelyn stepped back, her resolve hardening.

"I already have."

The silence that followed was deafening.

Evelyn turned on her heel and strode toward the staircase, her heart pounding. She didn’t look back.

Because if she did, she might crumble.

And Evelyn Carter never crumbled.

Not even when her world was falling apart.
###Chapter 9: Her Decision

Ethan Caldwell's expression turned stormy as his fingers tapped impatiently against the polished mahogany table, each sharp rap reverberating through the tense silence of the room.

He couldn’t fathom how Evelyn Carter, after years of unwavering devotion to him, could so casually discard their engagement.

"Is this because of Vanessa?" His voice was laced with disbelief. "They’ve just been collaborating more on projects lately. Are you really going to throw everything away over something so trivial?"

Margaret Hayes was quick to chime in, her tone dripping with false concern. "Honestly, Evelyn, do you truly think so poorly of Vanessa? She’s never been anything but kind to you. Why would she ever try to come between you and Ethan?"

Evelyn’s gaze swept over her parents before settling on Vanessa.

The irony was almost laughable.

Vanessa didn’t even need to defend herself. Their parents were always the first to leap to her defense.

Yet Evelyn—the one who had sacrificed, the one who had endured—was left standing alone.

A bitter smirk curled Evelyn’s lips.

"This isn’t a joke, and I’m not being petty. I’m ending things with Ethan. It’s done."

Ethan, frustration boiling over, yanked at his tie with rough impatience. "What the hell, Evelyn? What do you want now?"

"What's the meaning of this?"

Evelyn's laugh was brittle, devoid of any real amusement.

"You think this is just some childish outburst?"

Her voice trembled with suppressed emotion.

"Ethan, do you honestly believe that because I love you, I’m somehow beneath you? That my feelings don’t matter?"

Her nails dug into her palms.

"You can’t see my pain, so you dismiss it as drama?"

The words spilled out before she could stop them.

"I’ve wanted to ask you this for so long. When you abandoned your fiancée to protect another woman, did you even consider how I’d feel?"

Her chest tightened.

"And how could you just discard me like I meant nothing?"

The memory of Ethan’s careless words to his friends earlier twisted like a knife in her ribs.

His expression shifted as realization dawned—her anger wasn’t baseless.

She had heard him.

His careless remarks had cut deeper than he’d ever intended.

A humorless chuckle escaped him. "It was just banter between friends. You’re really this upset over a joke?"

Vanessa, sensing the tension escalating, stepped in. "Evelyn, this isn’t the time. Throwing a fit only makes things harder for Mom and Dad. Calling off the engagement like this makes us all look foolish."

Her words were sharp, calculated.

Evelyn’s jaw clenched.

Foolish?

No.

This wasn’t foolishness.

This was survival.

The slap echoed through the grand hall of Hawthorne Estate, sharp and unforgiving.

Evelyn's vision swam, her cheek burning with the force of Richard's strike. The pain was nothing compared to the humiliation twisting in her chest.

"This family is already a laughingstock," Richard snarled, his face flushed with rage. "I've never seen a daughter disgrace her own blood like this. And you're worried about what outsiders think?"

Evelyn swallowed hard, her fingers trembling at her sides. She wouldn't cry. Not here. Not in front of them.

"You think breaking off the engagement leaves you any options?" Richard scoffed. "Who would dare cross the Caldwells for you? No one wants damaged goods, Evelyn. Especially not with your record going public tomorrow."

Her stomach churned.

"You've ruined us!" he spat.

"I was framed!" Evelyn shot back, her voice raw. "Vanessa set me up, and you all just—believed her!"

The words tasted bitter. She had spent years hoping they'd see the truth. But they never would.

Not her father. Not her mother. None of them.

Evelyn straightened, her resolve hardening.

She was done.

Done with their cruelty.

Done with their betrayal.

Without another word, she turned and walked away, leaving the shattered remains of her family behind.

The moment Evelyn turned away, the heavens split open.

Torrential rain crashed down like shattered glass, drenching the streets in seconds.

A maid rushed forward with an umbrella, concern etched on her face, but Evelyn merely shook her head.

She stepped into the downpour without hesitation, her dress clinging to her skin within moments.

For the first time, clarity struck her like lightning.

Her family? A carefully constructed lie.

Her lover? A betrayal wrapped in pretty words.

The cold rain numbed her skin, but inside, something unfamiliar bloomed—freedom.

Each drop felt like it was scrubbing away the years of deception, the weight of their false love dissolving into the gutters.

She didn’t see the sleek black car idling nearby, its windows tinted against the storm.

Inside, Alexander Whitmore took a slow drag from his cigarette, the glow casting shadows across his sharp features.

His eyes never left his phone, though his mind was clearly elsewhere.

Then, the car door opened.

Simon Graves slid into the passenger seat, his suit damp from the rain.

A tense silence stretched between them before Simon finally spoke, his voice low.

Alexander’s posture shifted instantly, his gaze sharpening.

“So, this is how the night unfolded,” Simon murmured, still visibly unsettled by what he’d witnessed.

The storm raged on, but inside that car, something far more dangerous was brewing.

The realization hit him like a thunderbolt—how could the true heiress be treated so cruelly by an imposter, while her own family stood by and did nothing?

A bitter thought crossed his mind. What kind of people are they?

Have they lost all sense of reason?

Simon glanced at Alexander’s unreadable expression, then at Evelyn’s retreating figure, and hesitated. "Should we go after her?"

Alexander’s attention, however, was fixed on his phone as the screen suddenly lit up.

The soft glow highlighted his sharp jawline, and his detached demeanor shifted into something more intrigued as the call connected.

A faint smirk curved his lips as he answered.

"258, is that you?" Evelyn’s uncertain voice echoed through the line.

###Chapter 10: Ethan’s Uncle

The moment Evelyn walked out, the atmosphere in Hawthorne Estate turned suffocating.

She had been the one insisting on the engagement with Ethan, and now, without warning, she was ending it.

The family exchanged bewildered glances, stunned by the abrupt shift. No one could comprehend how Evelyn, usually so compliant, had walked away without so much as a backward glance at Ethan.

Breaking the tense silence, Vanessa attempted to soothe her parents. "Mom, Dad, please don’t be angry. Evelyn’s been through so much in prison. She’s not herself right now. She’s overwhelmed—"

"Overwhelmed? She’s twenty-four!" Richard roared, slamming his palm against the table.

"She’s old enough to understand consequences! Does she think she can just throw away an engagement on a whim? What will society say? That there’s something going on between you and Ethan?"

"Utterly thoughtless!"

Vanessa lowered her head, tears shimmering in her eyes. "If it makes Evelyn happy, I’ll bear the rumors. I don’t care what people say."

Margaret’s heart ached, and she squeezed her daughter’s shoulder gently. "But your reputation matters. If you marry Ethan now, what will—"

Vanessa pressed her lips together, fingers twisting nervously in her lap.

She stole a glance at Ethan, who lounged on the sofa, a cigarette dangling carelessly between his fingers. The smoke curled around him, obscuring his expression, but she didn’t need to see his face to know something was wrong.

The air between them felt charged, dangerous.

Before she could speak, Ethan crushed the cigarette into the ashtray and stood abruptly.

"I'm done here."

Richard and Margaret exchanged alarmed looks before subtly nodding at Vanessa.

She swallowed hard and rushed after him. "It's pouring outside. At least let me get you an umbrella."

The moment the door closed behind them, Richard's voice cracked with worry. "Do you think he'll break off the engagement? Did you see the way he stormed out?"

The Caldwells were one of the most powerful families in Cresthaven. Countless people would sell their souls for a chance to be tied to them.

And Ethan wasn’t just any Caldwell—he was the heir.

Public humiliation? That wasn’t something a man like him would tolerate.

Margaret sighed. "Evelyn has always been stubborn. But she's always come to her senses eventually."

She patted Richard's arm reassuringly. "Don't worry. Young lovers quarrel and reconcile. She'll realize she was wrong and apologize to Ethan soon enough."

Richard considered this and nodded.

Over the years, they had all witnessed the depth of Evelyn's feelings for Ethan.

Even during her time in prison, she had written to him religiously every week.

They had shared a childhood and seven years of memories. Emotions that strong don’t just vanish in an instant.

So, Richard and Margaret convinced themselves this was just a temporary outburst—anger clouding her judgment.

Vanessa walked Ethan to the door, her fingers gently adjusting his tie.

Midway through, her eyes welled up as a painful realization struck her.

"It's all my fault," she whispered, tears spilling down her cheeks.

"I told Evelyn I wouldn’t stand in her way, but she still doesn’t believe me. Why does she keep making things difficult?"

Her voice trembled. "She’s always been so spoiled, so reckless. And now she’s humiliated you in front of everyone—"

Ethan caught her wrist, his expression darkening. "Vanessa, stop."

She flinched at the warning in his tone.

He exhaled sharply, releasing her. "This isn’t about you. Evelyn’s problem is with me."

Vanessa bit her lip, fresh tears threatening to fall.

But before she could respond, the doorbell rang.

A tall, broad-shouldered man stood on the doorstep, his sharp features eerily familiar.

Ethan stiffened. "Uncle Harold?"

The older man smirked, his gaze sweeping over them with cold amusement.

"Well, well. Looks like I’ve arrived just in time for the drama."

Vanessa’s breath hitched.

Harold Aniston wasn’t just Ethan’s uncle.

He was the man who had orchestrated Alexander Whitmore’s downfall five years ago.

And from the gleam in his eyes, he wasn’t here for a family reunion.

The weight of guilt pressed heavily on Vanessa’s shoulders. "This is all my fault," she whispered, her voice trembling. "Everyone’s suffering because of me."

Ethan’s heart ached at the sight of her distress. He reached into his pocket, pulling out a silk handkerchief. With gentle fingers, he dabbed at her tear-streaked cheeks. "Don’t waste your tears on her," he murmured. "She doesn’t deserve them."

Vanessa bit her lip, her eyes darting around nervously. "We shouldn’t—what if someone sees us together like this?"

Her vulnerability only made her more endearing to him. "Ethan," she continued, her voice barely above a whisper, "I’ve told you before—just being able to watch you from afar is enough for me. Someone like me… I don’t belong by your side."

The memory of Evelyn’s cold, cutting words flashed through Ethan’s mind. In contrast, Vanessa’s softness was like a balm to his frayed nerves. His fingers twitched toward his cigarette case, craving the familiar comfort.

But reality crashed down on him. The Whitmores were a family of stature and reputation. They would never accept a woman with a shadowed past like Vanessa’s.

Overcome with emotion, he pressed a tender kiss to her forehead. "Vanessa," he vowed, "I promise I won’t let your suffering be in vain."

A sudden movement caught his eye. His blood ran cold when he recognized the sleek black sedan parked discreetly nearby.

Instinctively, Ethan stepped back from Vanessa, putting distance between them. His pulse pounded in his ears as the car door opened.

Standing there, with an unreadable expression, was his uncle—Alexander Whitmore.
###Chapter 11 The Blow to the Head

The downpour blurred Ethan's vision, the taillights of the fleeing car dissolving into crimson streaks before vanishing completely.

Vanessa rushed to his side, struggling to keep the umbrella steady against the wind. "Ethan! What happened?"

He turned sharply, rainwater dripping from his jawline. Without hesitation, she angled the umbrella toward him, letting the cold droplets soak through her silk blouse.

For a heartbeat, he saw it—that same self-sacrificing instinct Evelyn used to have.

Evelyn would have done exactly that.

His grip tightened on Vanessa's wrist. Why the hell am I comparing her to Evelyn? I don’t care about Evelyn anymore.

Noticing Vanessa’s trembling lips, he shrugged off his coat and wrapped it around her. The scent of his cologne clung to the fabric as she pulled it tighter.

"Do you think Evelyn actually means it this time?" Vanessa whispered, her voice barely audible over the storm. "About breaking the engagement?"

Ethan scoffed, drawing her against his chest. The warmth of her body seeped into his rain-chilled skin.

"Don’t be naive. This is just another one of her games." His thumb traced her collarbone possessively. "She’ll come crawling back. She always does."

The certainty in his voice didn’t quite reach his eyes.

Somewhere in the downpour, a car horn blared—sharp, impatient. Like a warning.

Vanessa chewed her bottom lip nervously. "She looked absolutely furious tonight. Shouldn't you call and check where she went?"

Ethan waved a dismissive hand. "Don't bother. She'll come crawling back with an apology soon enough."

He had never been the type to initiate contact with Evelyn first.

In their relationship, she had always been the one to bridge the gap, regardless of whose fault it was.

She was the one who swallowed her pride, and he had grown accustomed to it.

Outside, the storm raged violently.

Lightning split the sky like jagged cracks in glass, followed by deafening thunder that shook the windows.

Simon stood beside the hospital bed, his voice low. "Ms. Carter has a concussion. The doctors recommend keeping her under observation for at least three more days."

Alexander's gaze remained fixed on Evelyn's bandaged ankle, his jaw clenched.

Simon cleared his throat before continuing. "The porcelain shards cut deep. Treatment was delayed, so scarring is likely permanent. The bone, however, is intact."

Alexander's expression remained unreadable, but the air around him turned glacial.

The tension in the sterile hospital room was suffocating.

Evelyn lay motionless on the bed, her usually vibrant presence reduced to a fragile shadow. Though someone had changed her out of her drenched clothes, the way her slender frame barely made an impression on the mattress was unsettling.

The angry red imprint of a slap stood out starkly against her too-pale cheek.

Alexander's jaw clenched. That must have burned like hell.

He pulled a cigarette from his pocket, rolling it between his fingers before pressing it to his lips. At the last second, he remembered where he was and tucked it away with a frustrated sigh.

"Mr. Whitmore," Simon murmured, checking his watch discreetly. "Lucas is still waiting for you at the venue. If you don't leave now, they'll proceed without you."

"Let them."

Alexander dragged a chair to Evelyn's bedside and sat down heavily. "I'm not going anywhere tonight."

Simon opened his mouth to protest when Alexander's phone vibrated loudly.

Glancing at Evelyn's restless form, he stepped into the hallway before answering.

"Alex, what the hell?" Lucas Bennett's booming voice carried through the receiver. "You vanish without a word in the middle of negotiations? People are starting to think you got kidnapped by some femme fatale."

A humorless smirk twisted Alexander's lips. "Close enough. Jealous?"

"Dream on, pretty boy."

Lucas smirked, nudging Alexander with his elbow. "You honestly believe women will be lining up for you just because you served in the military? Wake up, man."

Alexander didn’t respond, the glow of his cigarette casting shadows across his sharp features.

They had been friends since they were kids, so Lucas knew he could push his buttons without consequence.

"Come on, everyone’s waiting," Lucas pressed. "Oh, and your nephew’s here too."

Alexander’s gaze darkened. "Ethan?"

"Yeah. The whole Hawthorne Estate scandal is all over the news. Your nephew’s got some nerve showing up here for drinks after everything that went down."

A cold, humorless smile curled Alexander’s lips, his expression unreadable.

"Tell them I’ll be there in five."

The tension in the air thickened as he crushed his cigarette beneath his boot.

###Chapter 12 The Unexpected Savior

The moment Alexander stepped out, Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open.

The sharp sting of antiseptic assaulted her senses before she even registered where she was.

White walls. Sterile air. The steady beep of a heart monitor.

Hospital.

Memories rushed back—the storm, the phone call, the sudden darkness swallowing her whole.

She had barely made it out of Hawthorne Estate before the skies opened up. Rain lashed against her skin, cold and relentless.

Then, her phone buzzed. A missed call.

She had dialed back without thinking, her voice barely audible over the downpour.

"I'm near the old bridge—"

That was all she remembered before collapsing.

Now, lying in this hospital bed, one question burned in her mind.

Did he really come for me?

Ten years ago, she had stumbled upon a wounded man in the woods.

She had bandaged his injuries, given him shelter, and in return, he had pressed a pendant into her palm.

"If you ever need me, call this number."

She had scribbled it down, half-convinced it was meaningless.

People forgot. Promises faded.

Yet tonight, when she had dialed that decade-old number, someone had answered.

And now, here she was. Alive.

The door creaked open.

Her breath caught.

Was it him?

Or had she imagined the whole thing?

The memory was hazy, like a dream half-remembered.

She couldn’t picture his face anymore—only the crisp police uniform he’d worn, the bold numbers "258" stitched onto his shoulder. His badge number, most likely.

Just as the past threatened to swallow her whole, the door swung open, jerking her back to the present.

A man strode in—tall, impeccably dressed, his sharp suit accentuating broad shoulders. The sight of him startled her. He was striking in a way that made her pulse skip.

Simon hadn’t anticipated her being awake already. His steps faltered slightly. "Ms. Carter," he said, voice steady but laced with surprise. "You’re up. Let me call the doctor."

Chaos followed.

A flurry of white coats swept in, checking vitals, murmuring medical jargon, then vanishing just as quickly.

Evelyn watched them come and go, the surrealness of it all pressing down on her. Yet, beneath that, warmth spread through her chest. Someone had stayed. Someone cared.

When the room finally emptied, she turned to Simon, studying him with quiet intensity.

"So it was you," she murmured. "258. Thank you… for tonight."

The memory belonged to another life—one where she’d been just a terrified fourteen-year-old girl.

Now, years later, the face of the man who’d saved her had faded into obscurity.

Simon stilled, surprise flickering in his gaze.

He didn’t understand the significance of that number.

But Evelyn did.

And that changed everything.

Evelyn suspected Alexander was involved.

She studied Simon's face carefully, not wanting to make assumptions.

Simon chose his words with care. "Ms. Carter, if you're looking for the man who helped you earlier, he had to leave. I'm Simon Graves. Please let me know if you need anything—I'll take care of it immediately."

So it wasn't him.

Evelyn gave a faint nod. Noticing her exhaustion, Simon quietly excused himself and closed the door behind him.

In the hallway, he quickly pulled out his phone. [Sir, Ms. Carter is awake. The doctors confirm she's stable.]

Alexander's reply came within seconds. [Good.]

Simon hesitated, then added another message. [She seemed... disappointed it wasn't you.]

Rain lashed against the windows of Eclipse Lounge as Alexander strode inside, his coat untouched by the storm.

The dim lighting accentuated the sharp angles of his face as he checked his phone.

Simon's last message made his lips twitch.

Tall and commanding, Alexander moved through the space with effortless confidence.

Amusement flickered in his dark eyes.

The club's shadows only heightened his striking presence.

He didn't reply to Simon's observation.

Instead, he pocketed his phone with deliberate slowness.

The storm outside mirrored the tension coiling in his chest.

He hadn't expected Evelyn to remember anything.

Yet somehow, she'd sensed his involvement.

That complicated things.

Alexander signaled the bartender for a drink he didn't intend to finish.

The ice clinked softly against the glass as he considered his next move.

Across town, Evelyn stared at the hospital ceiling.

Fragmented memories swirled—strong arms lifting her, a deep voice cutting through the haze of pain.

She squeezed her eyes shut.

Why would Alexander Whitmore save her?

And why disappear afterward?

The questions burned brighter than her injuries.

Somewhere between consciousness and sleep, she made a decision.

She would find the truth.

No matter what it cost her.

Alexander took a slow drag from the cigarette dangling between his lips, his fingers flying across the screen. [On my way.]

The moment he sent the message, the smirk vanished from his face.

Inside the private room, the crowd that had been fawning over Ethan Caldwell immediately shifted their attention as Alexander stepped in.

The difference in status was palpable.

Everyone present knew Alexander Whitmore was the true powerhouse behind Titan Capital Group.

Ethan, caught in the act of showing off, rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly and approached. "Hey, Uncle."

The air thickened with unspoken tension.

Alexander's piercing gaze swept over the room before landing on Ethan. "Having fun?"

Ethan swallowed hard. "Just catching up with some friends."

A cold smile tugged at Alexander's lips. "Good. Because we have business to discuss."

The room fell silent.

Ethan's fingers twitched at his side. "Right now?"

Alexander exhaled a thin stream of smoke. "Unless you'd rather keep entertaining your audience."

Ethan's jaw tightened, but he nodded.

As Alexander turned to leave, the crowd instinctively parted for him.

No one dared to speak until the door clicked shut behind him.

Ethan let out a slow breath, his earlier bravado crumbling.

This wasn't going to be a pleasant conversation.
###Chapter 13 Defying His Demand

Alexander ignored him, idly accepting the cocktail Lucas offered. The amber liquid swirled hypnotically in his crystal glass, catching the dim lighting in unsettling fractals.

Ethan, recalling his purpose, stiffened his spine. "Uncle, regarding Horizon Enterprises' proposal—"

Titan Capital Group had been locked in fierce bidding for weeks, with Horizon as their main rival. He'd sworn to Vanessa he'd deliver this contract to her.

Yet the documents had gathered dust in Alexander's office for fifteen days. That's why he'd risked the storm to come here tonight.

Alexander's glacial gaze cut to him. "This is a lounge. Not a boardroom."

Ethan's rehearsed arguments dissolved on his tongue.

Vanessa's expectant face flashed in his mind. He tried again. "Just your signature is all that's needed—"

Glass shattered against the marble floor as Alexander slammed his drink down.

The crystal glass hit the mahogany table with a deafening crash, shards scattering across the polished surface. The room fell into stunned silence.

"Ethan, you've got some nerve," Alexander said, his voice dangerously calm.

Though he didn't raise his voice, the weight of his words pressed down like a storm cloud.

Ethan's stomach twisted. He rarely interacted with Alexander directly, and they'd never had any real conflict—until now. But tonight, Alexander's fury was unmistakable.

"Have you forgotten you represent Titan Capital Group? Did you even bother vetting Horizon Enterprises before bringing this proposal to me?"

"I did. They meet all qualifications," Ethan replied, forcing confidence into his tone.

"Really? Then explain why you'd choose Horizon over a clearly superior alternative?"

Ethan faltered, his mouth going dry.

"Struggling to answer? Let me help," Alexander continued, his gaze sharp as a blade. "It's because someone at Horizon is pulling your strings. Should I announce their name to the entire room?"

Ethan's face drained of color. The room was packed with Titan Capital's elite investors—people whose trust he needed, whose influence he relied on.

With just a few precise words, Alexander had exposed him.

The atmosphere in the room turned icy.

What should have been a professional discussion had spiraled into a spectacle of shame.

Ethan Caldwell could feel his reputation shattering before his eyes. There was no recovering from this humiliation in front of his peers.

Lucas Bennett, swirling his drink lazily, didn’t miss the tension thickening the air.

"So, Ethan," he drawled, amusement lacing his tone. "You’re really here begging your uncle to save your little affair partner? No wonder Evelyn wants out of the engagement. Who would tolerate their fiancé flaunting another woman so shamelessly?"

The mention of the broken engagement made Ethan’s expression twist in fury.

"Vanessa isn’t just some affair!" he snapped, his voice tight with frustration.

Alexander Whitmore let out a derisive laugh, arching a brow. "You’re cheating. Doesn’t that make her exactly that?"

Ethan faltered, his jaw clenching.

It hit him then—Alexander must have heard about the scene at the Hawthorne Estate earlier.

Normally, Alexander stayed out of petty family drama, but this wasn’t just personal. It was about the Whitmore name.

Evelyn’s public announcement ending their engagement would stain the Caldwell family’s reputation.

And Alexander wasn’t about to let that slide.

As the head of the Whitmore family, Alexander had to consider these matters carefully.

Ethan Caldwell quickly realized that direct confrontation with his uncle wouldn't benefit him.

"Evelyn just had an emotional outburst tonight," Ethan said smoothly. "She'll calm down and return in a few days. It's really nothing to worry about."

Alexander took a slow drag from his cigarette, his piercing gaze sharpening. "Is that your assessment?"

His tone carried layers of unspoken meaning, but Ethan remained oblivious.

"Just a minor lovers' quarrel, Uncle. Vanessa will apologize, and everything will return to normal."

The room fell silent as Alexander processed these words.

The comment struck deeper than Ethan realized.

True, Evelyn had ended things tonight - but would she really stay away?

Could seven years of shared history be erased so easily?

After stubbing out his cigarette, Alexander finally broke the silence.

"Bring Vanessa here tomorrow at six sharp."

The command left no room for negotiation.

Ethan Caldwell stiffened, his brow furrowing in confusion. Why would Alexander Whitmore suddenly demand to see Vanessa Hart?

A protective instinct surged through him. He couldn't shake the unease coiling in his chest—what if Alexander intended to corner her?

Lucas Bennett smirked, crossing his arms. "You're defending her like she's innocent, yet you claim she's not involved?" His tone dripped with amusement. "If your uncle orders you to bring her, just obey. You really don’t want to test his patience." He leaned in, voice lowering. "Trust me, you won’t like the consequences."

Ethan’s jaw tightened.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Lucas wasn’t wrong—defying Alexander was dangerous. But Ethan refused to drag Vanessa into this mess.

Not again.

Not ever.

His fingers curled into fists at his sides.

He’d face Alexander’s wrath alone.
###Chapter 14 The Humiliation Game

Ethan Caldwell had come to Eclipse Lounge for Alexander Whitmore's signature, but instead of securing the document, he left looking like a complete fool.

The humiliation was too much. He stormed out, shoulders slumped in defeat.

Lucas Bennett swirled his drink, watching with amusement. "Alexander, you're acting strange tonight."

Alexander smirked. "Am I?"

Lucas leaned in, eyes glinting with mischief. "Don't play dumb. You know exactly what I mean."

With Ethan gone, Alexander suddenly lost interest in staying. "I'm leaving."

Lucas arched a brow. "Since when do you bail early? Who’s the woman that’s got you this distracted?"

"You wouldn’t get it," Alexander said, stubbing out his cigarette. "I’d give her the world if she asked."

Lucas let out a low whistle. "Look at you, turning into a poet."

He leaned closer, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "It’s her, isn’t it? That girl who saved you all those years ago. Evelyn Carter?"

Alexander’s expression darkened, confirming everything.

Lucas grinned. "I knew it."

Without another word, Alexander grabbed his coat and walked out, leaving Lucas shaking his head in amusement.

The game was far from over.

Lucas Bennett waited, but Alexander Whitmore said nothing, only giving him a sharp glare.

Seeing he'd hit a nerve, Lucas smirked and pushed further. "Why torture yourself over her? While you were off playing soldier, she spent seven years with your nephew."

"If Ethan Caldwell had half a brain, they'd probably be married by now."

Lucas couldn't resist playing matchmaker. "Look, if I were you, I'd make my move while she's still pissed at him. Strike while she's emotional—she might just say 'yes' before she realizes what she's doing!"

Alexander didn’t bother responding, turning toward the exit.

But then he paused, glancing back. "Where’s Claire?"

"At home. Why?"

"Tell her to keep Evelyn company at the hospital tomorrow. I’ll send you the address."

And just like that, Alexander walked out, leaving Lucas feeling like an errand boy.

"Seriously? Claire and I are fighting. Why would I go home now? You think I came out in this storm just to sit around alone?"

Lucas had no intention of returning to an empty apartment—that’s why he’d dragged his friends out in the first place.

He took another swig of whiskey, and thoughts of Claire Dawson crept in.

The storm had raged all night, but dawn brought calm, the air crisp with the scent of rain-soaked earth.

Evelyn stirred awake, her mind foggy with remnants of a dream she couldn’t quite grasp.

"You’re up early."

The deep, amused voice sent a jolt through her. She turned sharply to find Alexander sprawled on the other side of the bed.

He lounged against the headboard, watching her with those piercing eyes that always seemed to see too much. His white shirt was rumpled, the top buttons undone, revealing a tantalizing glimpse of sculpted chest.

Evelyn’s brows furrowed as panic flickered in her chest. "What the hell happened?"

Alexander’s lips curved into that infuriating smirk. "You look shocked. Don’t tell me you don’t remember how I ended up here?"

Her fingers clenched the sheets, suspicion coiling tight.

I don’t even know him! How did he get into my bed?

The room spun as fragments of the night before teased at her memory—laughter, too much wine, the warmth of his hand on her waist.

But nothing concrete.

Nothing that explained why Alexander Whitmore, the man she’d sworn to avoid, was now smirking at her like he’d won some unspoken game.

Her pulse hammered.

This was bad.

Really, really bad.

Alexander straightened his shirt with an unreadable expression.

"You clung to me all night, refusing to let go," he said, voice low. "If anyone should be complaining, it's me."

Evelyn's thoughts scattered.

She remembered the doctor's visit, then collapsing into bed—but everything after was a blur.

There were hazy impressions of warmth, of strong arms around her, but no clear details.

Her fingers twisted in the sheets. "Are you absolutely certain I was the one who—?"

Alexander didn’t answer. His attention was fixed on his half-buttoned shirt.

Then his hands stilled.

His gaze dropped pointedly to her right hand.

Following it, Evelyn realized with dawning horror that her fingers were curled tightly around the very button he’d been trying to fasten.

Her stomach lurched. I did this? Oh god. This can’t be happening.

No matter how hard she tried, the memories refused to surface.

The silence stretched, thick with unspoken tension.

Alexander exhaled sharply. "Do you intend to let go?"

Evelyn jerked her hand back as if burned.

Heat flooded her cheeks. This was beyond humiliating.

She opened her mouth—to apologize? Explain?—but no words came.

Alexander finished buttoning his shirt with deliberate slowness.

His eyes locked onto hers. "Next time," he said evenly, "I expect you to remember."

Then he turned and walked out, leaving Evelyn staring after him, pulse racing.

Next time?

What exactly had she done last night?
###Chapter 15 Marry Me

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her teeth sinking into her bottom lip as she stole a nervous glance at him. Her mind raced, trying to make sense of the situation.

Why was he here, in her hospital room?

"Are you 258?" she asked hesitantly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Alexander arched a brow and settled into the chair beside her bed, stretching his long legs out before him. His piercing gaze never left hers, dark and unreadable.

"That's correct."

His tone was smooth, laced with the roughness of someone who hadn't slept.

"Ms. Carter," he continued, tilting his head slightly, "are you intending to cash in on that favor from a decade ago to make up for last night?"

Their eyes locked, and Evelyn felt her breath hitch.

Ten years ago, when she had found him, he had been half-buried in the mud, his chest marred by a gruesome wound. Back then, she hadn't even seen his face clearly.

She never imagined he would look like this.

She had always thought Ethan Caldwell was the most striking man in Cresthaven, but now, faced with Alexander Whitmore, she realized how wrong she had been.

There was no comparison.

Her hands shook slightly as she whispered, "We didn't... do anything more, right?"

Alexander's lips curved with mischief. "What do you think happened?"

Evelyn tightened her grip on the sheets, her pulse racing. Aside from tearing his button off, she couldn’t recall if she had crossed any other lines.

The silence stretched, suffocating. She had to say something.

"Maybe I could... buy you a new shirt?"

His chuckle was low, velvety. "Just the shirt?"

She chewed her bottom lip.

That clearly wasn’t enough.

A man like him—wealthy, commanding—wouldn’t care about a single ruined garment. But what else could she offer? She had nothing. No family, no money, no status.

After a tense pause, she forced out the words, "If there’s anything else I can do—"

"Marry me."

Her breath hitched. "What?"

"Will You Marry Me?"

"What did you just say?"

Alexander leaned back, his gaze lingering on her lips—soft, full, and red as a freshly bloomed rose.

His throat moved slightly as he swallowed.

"I said, marry me. Think about it."

His tone was light, almost conversational, as if he were suggesting where to grab dinner. But Evelyn felt the words like a jolt of electricity through her veins.

"We’ve only met once. I don’t even know your last name!"

Alexander dragged his fingers through his dark hair, exhaling in mild frustration. "Ms. Carter, you might not realize this, but I’m an old-fashioned man. Twenty-nine years, I’ve waited."

His voice dropped lower. "And last night, you took that from me. How do I explain that to my future wife?"

A slow, knowing smile curved his lips as he leaned in. "Besides, we haven’t just met once. I’ve known you for ten years. You saved me. Marrying you is the only logical choice."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

The way he said it made it sound like refusing would be absurd.

"You should know… I’m engaged."

She bit her lip, then hesitated, as if suddenly remembering something painful.

The golden afternoon light streamed through the hospital window, casting long shadows across the sterile white sheets. Evelyn’s fingers twisted nervously in her lap, her gaze fixed on the floor.

"I was supposed to marry Ethan," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. The words tasted bitter on her tongue. "But last night… we called it off."

Alexander stood by the window, the breeze tousling his dark hair. His jaw tightened imperceptibly, his hands curling into fists at his sides. The silence stretched between them, thick and heavy, like the weight of unspoken words.

Then—a sharp knock at the door.

A young nurse slipped inside, clutching a clipboard and a thermometer. "Just need to check your vitals, Miss Carter."

Alexander straightened, adjusting the cuffs of his dress shirt with practiced ease. His expression was unreadable as he turned toward Evelyn. "If you decide," he said, his voice low and measured, "let Simon know."

He moved to the water dispenser, filling a cup with warm water before setting it carefully on the bedside table. His fingers lingered for a moment, as if he wanted to say more.

Instead, he simply met her eyes. "Take care of yourself, Evelyn."

Then he was gone, the door clicking softly behind him.

The room felt emptier without him.

Evelyn exhaled shakily, staring at the untouched cup of water.

Somewhere deep inside, a decision was forming.
###Chapter 16 Nowhere to Go

Evelyn watched Alexander's broad shoulders disappear into the distance, and for the first time in days, she felt a fragile sense of peace settle over her.

But her thoughts inevitably circled back to Ethan.

How had everything unraveled so completely?

Memories surfaced—those early days after she'd been brought back to the Hawthorne Estate. The scent of gasoline made her sick, so Vanessa always rode in the car while Evelyn walked home from school alone.

Sometimes, she'd glance over her shoulder and spot Ethan lingering a few paces behind.

He moved with effortless grace in his tailored uniform, hands tucked casually in his pockets, his expression unreadable.

One afternoon, she stopped abruptly and waited.

Ethan closed the distance between them in just a few long strides.

He loomed over her, his face as cool as ever, but his eyes—those sharp, guarded eyes—betrayed something softer.

Back then, she'd been so sure he cared.

Everything shattered during the school's centennial gala.

Vanessa was supposed to perform a piano duet with Ethan.

Vanessa suddenly clutched her wrist, wincing in pain. Tears streamed down her face as she apologized profusely to Ethan, her expression heartbreakingly fragile.

The elite academy was sponsored by the Caldwell family, so naturally, they attended all major events.

Grace Caldwell had high expectations for her son—this was his chance to shine, to prove the Caldwell legacy.

But their duet was ruined.

Ethan demanded to know what happened. Vanessa's tearful gaze flickered toward Evelyn before she bit her lip and remained silent.

Only after relentless questioning did she finally whisper, "Evelyn... she threw a brick at me."

Eighteen-year-old Evelyn didn’t even have time to defend herself before Ethan’s palm struck her cheek in front of the entire auditorium.

"Ethan, how could you hit Evelyn?" Vanessa rushed forward, shielding her stepsister dramatically. "She’s family! I forgive her!"

Looking back now, Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh bitterly.

There had been countless incidents like this.

For years, she’d numbed herself, blaming Vanessa’s interference for the growing rift between her and Ethan.

But she’d forgotten—it takes two to destroy something.

Three years ago, when she was thrown into prison, it wasn't just Vanessa's scheming or her parents' silent betrayal. Ethan Caldwell's blind devotion to Vanessa had sealed her fate.

He must have loved her.

That night, when he found Vanessa cornered by those men, his bloodshot eyes had burned into Evelyn with pure hatred. "Evelyn," he had spat, voice trembling with rage, "for what you did to Vanessa, you deserve worse than hell."

A sharp knock at the door yanked her back to the present.

Evelyn quickly wiped the dampness from her lashes.

Simon Graves stepped inside, balancing a breakfast tray. His sharp gaze flickered to her red-rimmed eyes, but he said nothing about it.

After setting the tray down, he spoke quietly, "Ms. Carter, if I may—save your tears for someone who actually deserves them."

Evelyn flinched, her already pale face turning ghostly. She nodded stiffly. "I know. Thank you."

"Don't." Simon hesitated, then added, "The doctor cleared you for discharge tomorrow. Do you… have a place to go?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her fork. She focused on her food, chewing slowly.

Going back to the Hayes family wasn't an option. They wouldn't want her anyway.

The realization hit Evelyn like a tidal wave—she truly had nowhere left to turn.

Simon observed her distress, his voice gentle yet firm. "If you're without options, perhaps you should consider marrying my employer."

Evelyn's gaze snapped up, startled. "Your employer?"

Simon gave a slow nod.

"He's twenty-nine, never been in a relationship, and possesses unwavering principles. Marrying him guarantees stability—no infidelity, no housing struggles. He owns multiple properties."

When she remained silent, he pressed on. "I assume you've recently ended things with someone? As they say, when one chapter closes, another begins. A fresh start might heal old wounds. Why not consider it?"

Evelyn's fingers curled into her palms before relaxing.

The reasoning made sense, but the idea of binding herself to a stranger felt reckless.

Then, another knock shattered the tension.

Both turned to find Claire, Evelyn's closest friend, standing in the doorway.

Their eyes locked, and Claire's brimmed with instant tears.

She dashed forward, pulling Evelyn into a crushing embrace. "You absolute fool! How could you let this happen to yourself?"

Claire had heard every detail of what happened the previous night. Furious and restless, she had paced her apartment, torn between rushing to the hospital and giving Evelyn the space she needed to recover.

Now, standing beside Evelyn’s hospital bed, Claire crossed her arms, her voice sharp with disbelief. "Tell me you're not actually considering marrying that snake after everything he's done to you."

###Chapter 17 Seeing the Truth

Evelyn’s fingers curled into the sheets, her gaze dropping. "I won’t."

Once, Ethan had been her lifeline—the one who pulled her from the darkness when she had no one else.

That memory alone had kept her tethered to him all these years.

No matter how many times he betrayed her, the image of him tossing her that scarf outside the bathroom, his expression unreadable but his hands steady, had always softened her anger.

She had made excuses for him, blinded by the past, forgetting that people weren’t static. That light could fade, or worse—shift to someone else entirely.

Claire exhaled, tension leaving her shoulders. "Thank God. You were obsessed with him before."

Her fingers brushed the scar on Evelyn’s ankle, guilt lacing her voice. "I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you when it happened."

Evelyn shook her head.

Back then, the Dawson family had been in shambles, and Claire had been recovering from a fractured leg after a stage accident.

She’d had her own battles. Evelyn understood.

They were so deep in conversation that neither noticed Simon slipping into the room unnoticed.

The door clicked shut behind Simon as he stepped out into the hallway.

His footsteps echoed through the empty corridor as he made his way to the parking lot, where Alexander Whitmore sat in the sleek black car, a cigarette dangling between his fingers.

Simon approached cautiously, noting the way smoke curled lazily from Alexander’s hand.

“Well?” Alexander arched a brow, his voice low and measured.

Simon exhaled. “Ms. Carter was… taken aback. She didn’t seem ready for a sudden proposal.”

A faint smirk tugged at Alexander’s lips as he stretched his legs, leaning back against the leather seat. “I expected as much.”

He knew Evelyn well enough to understand she wouldn’t agree to something so impulsive without a compelling reason.

The thought darkened his expression, his grip tightening slightly on the cigarette.

Simon slid into the driver’s seat, hesitating before speaking again. “Sir… perhaps you should just tell her the truth.”

Alexander tilted his head, his sharp gaze prompting Simon to continue.

“Tell her you’re Ethan Caldwell’s uncle. If she marries you, she’ll have power in Cresthaven.”

Simon swallowed before finishing. “Ethan would have no choice but to respect her. And she’d be protected from—”

Alexander cut him off with a sharp exhale, flicking ash out the window.

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken words.

Simon gripped the steering wheel, waiting.

Finally, Alexander spoke, his voice dangerously quiet.

“She deserves more than just protection.”

His fingers crushed the cigarette, extinguishing it with a single motion.

“She deserves the truth.”

Simon nodded slowly, understanding dawning in his eyes.

Alexander’s gaze hardened as he stared out the window, the city lights of Cresthaven flickering in the distance.

“And she’ll get it.”

His voice was a vow.

A promise.

One that would change everything.

The offer was dangerously alluring. If I were in her position, I might have been tempted.

Simon grew increasingly animated as he spoke, his words nearly slipping beyond what was appropriate.

He caught himself abruptly, pressing his fingers to his lips as if to stop the flow of words.

Alexander smirked faintly. "An intriguing suggestion."

Simon grinned, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly.

But Alexander's expression shifted, his voice turning sharp. "You don’t truly know her."

Simon frowned, confused. "What do you mean?"

Evelyn had endured years of suffocating control from her family. Revealing Alexander’s true identity now might send her running—and he couldn’t risk that.

Alexander flicked open his lighter, the flame casting shadows across his face as thin tendrils of smoke curled upward, obscuring his thoughts.

At eight o'clock sharp, a sleek black car pulled up outside an exclusive members-only club.

Vanessa stepped out first, her fingers twisting nervously in front of her.

Ethan followed, his expression unreadable as he adjusted his cufflinks.

Vanessa's breath hitched. "Do you really think this will work?"

Ethan shot her a cool glance. "It has to."

Her nails dug into her palms. "But what if she refuses?"

A slow, calculating smile curved Ethan's lips. "Then we make sure she doesn’t have a choice."

Inside the club, the air hummed with low conversations and clinking glasses.

Alexander leaned back in his chair, his gaze fixed on the entrance.

Simon cleared his throat. "Should we intervene?"

Alexander exhaled a slow stream of smoke. "Not yet."

His phone buzzed—a message from Evelyn.

"Running late. Be there soon."

His thumb hovered over the screen before typing a single word.

"Waiting."

Vanessa's voice carried from across the room, sharp with forced laughter.

Ethan's hand settled on her lower back, a possessive gesture that made her stiffen.

Alexander's jaw tightened.

Simon leaned in. "They’re making their move."

Alexander crushed his cigarette into the ashtray. "Let them try."

Outside, Evelyn’s car pulled up to the curb.

She hesitated before stepping out, smoothing her dress with unsteady hands.

The game was about to begin.

And Alexander would ensure no one laid a finger on her.

Despite their relationship being kept discreet, the scandal from last night’s gala had thrust Vanessa into the center of attention.

Her stomach twisted with unease.

What if Alexander had summoned her to force her and Ethan apart?

She was nothing but a fraud—a girl with a fabricated pedigree and a past shrouded in shadows. How could she ever measure up to the standards of the illustrious Whitmore family?

Alexander Whitmore was a man of formidable reputation.

A decade in law enforcement had honed his ruthlessness before he took the reins of Titan Capital Group, eliminating rivals and consolidating power with an iron grip.

A man like that didn’t rise to such heights without being merciless.

The Caldwells were an old-money dynasty that prized their pristine image above all else.

If Alexander deemed her a liability, even Ethan wouldn’t dare defy him.

Vanessa’s pulse quickened with every passing second.

She clutched Ethan’s sleeve, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Ethan… what if your uncle tries to separate us?"

Ethan’s fingers brushed against her cheek, his voice a soothing murmur. "Don’t worry, love. He won’t."

But the doubt lingered in her chest like a storm.

Ethan's chest tightened as he saw the fear in Vanessa's eyes.

"Don't worry," he murmured, brushing his thumb over her knuckles. "I'm not going anywhere."

Her lashes fluttered, uncertainty flickering in her gaze. "Really?"

The raw vulnerability in her voice made his pulse stutter.

He squeezed her hand gently, lowering his voice. "Just agree with whatever my uncle says for now. Once he calms down, we'll figure this out."

Last night's disaster had spiraled far beyond what Ethan expected.

He had assumed Alexander would summon them for a sharp reprimand—maybe a heated lecture at worst.

Vanessa gave a stiff nod, though tension still lined her shoulders.

Then it struck him.

"Has Evelyn come back yet?"

In the past, Evelyn would have stormed into his penthouse within hours, demanding reconciliation.

But twenty-four hours had passed.

This time, she was holding her ground—uncharacteristically stubborn.

Vanessa's jaw tightened at the mention of Evelyn. Displeasure flashed across her face before she schooled her expression.

"She hasn't returned."

Her lips pressed into a thin line as she met Ethan's gaze. "Maybe she's still angry with me. Once this settles, I'll go talk to her."

The unspoken tension between them thickened.

Ethan exhaled slowly.

This wasn't just about Evelyn's absence.

It was about the fractures deepening between them all.

The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife.

"You're actually going to fetch her?" Ethan scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain.

Vanessa hid a smirk as she leaned closer, her fingers tracing idle patterns on his arm. "Let her stay away if she wants," she murmured, her voice laced with false sympathy. "It's not like she's contributing anything meaningful anyway."

Ethan let out a derisive snort. "Evelyn's always been too stubborn for her own good. When she finally comes crawling back, don't expect me to go easy on her."

Vanessa's lips curled into a satisfied smile, her eyes gleaming with triumph. "She's overestimating her importance," she said sweetly. "As if she has any real leverage in this situation."

Ethan crossed his arms, his expression darkening. "Let her play her little games. She’s the one who can’t walk away, not me. Evelyn always did think too highly of herself."

He was certain—absolutely certain—that by nightfall, she’d be back, begging for his forgiveness.

The thought alone made his lips twist into a cold, humorless smile.

Vanessa nestled against him, her voice a soft purr. "Just remember, when she does come back… don’t be too harsh."

Ethan barely spared her a glance. "We’ll see."

His phone buzzed in his pocket, but he ignored it.

Evelyn Carter had no idea what she was up against.

And he was going to make sure she learned the hard way.
###Chapter 18 Bitter Cold

The entrance of Eclipse Lounge was guarded by two massive bouncers, their arms crossed like impenetrable walls.

Ethan Caldwell was about to escort Vanessa Hart inside when the men abruptly barred their path with outstretched arms.

Ethan’s expression darkened instantly. His glare was sharp enough to cut glass as he snapped, "Alexander invited us. What’s the problem?"

The bouncers remained unmoved, their voices dripping with frost. "We need clearance first."

Irritation flared in Ethan’s eyes, his temper barely restrained—until Vanessa lightly tugged his sleeve.

She could already sense Alexander’s game. Forcing a polite smile despite the biting wind, she said, "I don’t mind waiting. Just let Ethan through, please?"

The night air was merciless after the earlier downpour, the draft at the club’s entrance making it even worse.

Vanessa, clad in a thin satin dress, shivered visibly, her fingers trembling and her nose turning pink from the cold.

The bouncer didn’t even blink. "No."

Ethan's expression darkened like a gathering storm.

Fuming with no target for his rage, he watched the security guard vanish back into the exclusive club, leaving them stranded in the chilly night air.

After what felt like an eternity—over fifteen agonizing minutes—the guard finally reappeared.

"You may enter now."

Ethan marched forward, shooting the guard a venomous glare, but the man remained stone-faced, eyes fixed straight ahead.

Since the guard answered to Alexander, Ethan swallowed his pride and let it go.

Inside the lavish private room, Alexander was engrossed in a high-stakes poker game with Lucas and a few other elite players. He didn’t bother looking up when Ethan and Vanessa stepped inside.

"Uncle Alexander." Ethan forced his voice to remain steady. "I’ve brought Vanessa."

At that exact moment, Lucas won the round and let out a triumphant roar, his boisterous celebration drowning out Ethan’s words entirely.

Ethan’s temper flared. His already foul mood plummeted further into darkness.

Vanessa tightened her grip on his arm, silently pleading with him to keep his composure.

Another round of cards concluded. Twenty excruciating minutes had passed since their arrival, and still, no acknowledgment.

The tension in the room was thick enough to slice.

Ethan Caldwell finally stepped forward, his voice firm. "Uncle Alexander, if you have a problem, take it up with me. Leave Vanessa out of this."

Before Alexander Whitmore could respond, Lucas Bennett's mocking laughter cut through the air. "Oh, how chivalrous. What's going on between you two? Must be something special."

Vanessa Hart's cheeks burned, but she bit her tongue.

The Bennett family wasn't one she could afford to provoke—especially not with their ties to Alexander.

Alexander stretched lazily on the couch, and Lucas immediately caught the unspoken command. Tossing his cards aside, he slung an arm around Ethan's shoulders.

"Ethan, I heard you've got some rare vintage hidden away. Let's go take a look."

It was obvious Lucas was trying to remove Ethan from the scene.

Ethan hesitated, reluctant to leave Vanessa alone with potential trouble brewing.

"How about this, Mr. Bennett?" he countered smoothly. "I'll have the wine brought here so we can all enjoy it together. Would that work?"

Lucas glanced at Alexander, who gave an almost imperceptible nod.

"Fine," Lucas conceded, dropping back onto the couch.

Then he pointed straight at Vanessa. "Then—"

The unspoken threat hung in the air.

Vanessa's fingers curled into her palms.

She knew this game.

And she wasn't about to lose.

"Let your lover serve the wine."

Ethan's expression turned to stone. "Mind your words!"

The gathered guests leaned forward with undisguised curiosity, their eyes gleaming at the brewing confrontation.

Vanessa's nails bit into her palms, yet she maintained a flawless smile despite the humiliation crawling up her spine.

She had no choice but to endure.

As the air thickened with tension, Alexander's voice cut through like a blade. "If you're thirsty, drink elsewhere. She isn't moving."

Vanessa's lips parted in shock, her wide eyes darting to Ethan in silent plea.

Under Alexander's command, Ethan clenched his jaw but didn't protest—though the sight of Vanessa's glassy eyes made his stomach twist.

"Uncle Alexander," Vanessa interjected softly, "what's this meeting about? May I stay?"

Alexander finally looked up, his gaze sharp enough to flay skin. "We're discussing Horizon Enterprises. Since when do you have a voice in family affairs?"

The room fell deathly still.

Vanessa's breath hitched.

Ethan's fingers twitched toward her before curling into fists.

Alexander turned a page of his contract with deliberate slowness, the sound like a judge's gavel.

Vanessa's knees trembled, but she locked them straight.

She wouldn't crumble.

Not here.

Not yet.

Ethan's throat worked as he swallowed hard.

The grandfather clock ticked like a countdown to disaster.

Then—

A champagne flute shattered against the marble floor.

All eyes snapped to the culprit: a red-faced investor who'd clearly had one too many.

Alexander didn't even blink. "Walter."

His assistant materialized instantly. "The car is ready, sir."

Vanessa's pulse roared in her ears.

This wasn't over.

It never was.

Ethan reached for her elbow—

Alexander's pen froze mid-signature.

A silent warning.

Ethan withdrew his hand as if burned.

Vanessa tasted blood where her teeth had pierced her lip.

Somewhere, a woman laughed too brightly.

The chandelier's crystals threw fractured light across their faces.

Alexander stood, his shadow swallowing them whole.

"Let's continue this... privately."

The doors clicked shut behind him with finality.

Vanessa exhaled.

For now, she'd survived.

But the war had just begun.
###Chapter 19 The Negotiation

Ethan's expression darkened, but he had enough self-control to keep his anger in check.

"Vanessa, don't worry about me. I'll just stay here and have another drink. Come find me when you're finished."

Vanessa nodded, relieved to have a moment alone to handle this delicate situation.

The deal with Alexander had been at a standstill for nearly three weeks, and she was growing desperate for his approval.

Now that he had brought it up himself, she couldn’t afford to let this opportunity slip away.

Fresh out of university, Vanessa had been placed at Horizon Enterprises by Richard as a junior project manager.

Despite his influence, she struggled to command respect from the more seasoned employees.

To prove herself, she needed results—fast.

Vanessa took a careful step toward Alexander, searching for the right words. "Alexander, about the proposal—"

His sharp gaze cut her off. "What did you just call me?"

She froze, realizing her misstep. "I mean… Mr. Whitmore."

Alexander flicked open his silver cigarette case with a practiced motion.

"The Horizon Enterprises deal can be yours," he said, lighting the cigarette with deliberate slowness.

Vanessa's breath hitched.

"But there's one condition." His icy gaze locked onto hers. "You walk away from Ethan. Permanently."

Her nails dug into her palms.

If she abandoned Ethan for this contract, he'd never forgive her.

But losing Horizon Enterprises? Explaining that failure to Titan Capital's board—and to Richard—would be catastrophic.

Trapped between betrayal and ruin, Vanessa's throat tightened.

Alexander exhaled a thin stream of smoke, watching her internal battle with visible amusement.

"Pick a side, Vanessa. You don't get both."

The grandfather clock's ticking grew deafening as she stared at the Persian rug, its intricate patterns blurring.

When Alexander abruptly stood, her pulse spiked. "Mr. Whitmore—surely we can discuss alternatives?"

His laugh was razor-sharp.

"Did you honestly think," he murmured, stepping into her space, "you had any leverage here?"

The citrus-and-tobacco scent of his cologne turned her stomach.

Somewhere in the mansion, a door slammed.

Vanessa realized two terrible truths at once:

First—Alexander had engineered this trap long before today.

Second—she'd already lost, no matter what she chose.

Vanessa's voice trembled. "Mr. Whitmore, but I truly love Ethan! I can't walk away from him!"

Alexander's lips twisted into a mocking smirk. "Then Horizon Enterprises will find another partner."

Her knuckles turned bone-white from how tightly she clenched her fists. The decision was already made.

No matter what, she would choose Ethan over the deal.

She wasn’t foolish like Evelyn.

There would always be other business opportunities, but Ethan was irreplaceable.

Alexander studied her with icy amusement.

"Even if you choose him, it doesn’t mean you’ll get to keep him."

Vanessa stiffened, the words like a knife twisting in her chest.

She stared at him, stunned. "You never mentioned that condition before."

"Didn’t I?" His gaze darkened. "I never promised that sacrificing the deal would grant you permission to stay with him."

Her stomach dropped.

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Alexander Whitmore's office as he leaned back in his leather chair.

"You heard about last night, didn't you?" His voice was smooth, almost amused. "The whole scene was rather dramatic. As the head of the Whitmore family, it's my duty to handle this properly—unless you'd prefer a scandal?"

Vanessa Hart clenched her jaw, her fingers digging into the armrest of the chair. "But I love Ethan. Please, don't do this."

Alexander arched a brow, swirling the amber liquid in his glass. "Do what? If you're so determined to be with him, why not marry him? That would solve quite a few problems for me."

Vanessa's breath hitched.

This was exactly what she wanted.

But the Whitmores were old money, obsessed with lineage and reputation.

Despite being raised in the Hayes household and treated like a princess, high society still saw her as an outsider.

Eleanor Caldwell would never accept her as Ethan's wife.

That was why, even though Evelyn Carter was less polished, she was the one engaged to Ethan—not Vanessa.

Vanessa quickly realized Alexander was cornering her.

"You're playing games," she said, her voice tight. "Mr. Whitmore, you know Eleanor would never allow this marriage. How could I—"

"Possibly marry him?"

Alexander reclined in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips as he crossed his legs. "If you're so determined, shouldn't you be the one to come up with a solution?"

Vanessa blinked, caught off guard. "What solution?"

"You're asking me?"

Alexander's eyes glinted with icy amusement. "Figure it out yourself. I'll give you three days to make Ethan marry you. If you can't pull it off, then you're on your own."

Vanessa's stomach twisted.

This was far more complicated than she’d anticipated.

If she’d had any real leverage, she wouldn’t have spent three years sneaking around with Ethan without sealing the deal.

Just then, Lucas sauntered over, swirling a glass of wine in his hand.

He gestured toward Ethan, who was slumped face-down on the table, utterly wasted. "Alexander, your nephew can't hold his liquor. How did he get this drunk so fast?"

His gaze then flicked to Vanessa.

"You don’t exactly look like you can handle him alone. Want me to call someone?"

Without responding, Vanessa moved to prop Ethan up, letting his dead weight slump against her shoulder.

The challenge was set.

Three days.

And she had no idea how she was going to pull this off.

Alexander was completely unconscious, dead to the world.

Vanessa's thoughts spiraled, Alexander's cruel ultimatum echoing in her mind.

Amid the chaos of her emotions, a reckless idea sparked.

Perhaps there was a way out—if she dared to play a dangerous game.

Fine liquor had a way of loosening even the tightest self-control.

Not long after Vanessa and Ethan departed, Alexander found himself thoroughly drunk.

Simon was about to help his inebriated boss into the car when his phone buzzed—Evelyn was calling.

Her voice was hesitant. "Simon… is he with you?"

Simon froze.

"Ms. Carter… have you made your choice?"

The air in the Eclipse Lounge was thick with the scent of aged whiskey and regret.

Vanessa watched from the shadows as Ethan downed another glass, his expression dark.

She had to act fast.

Alexander’s words still burned in her ears: "You have until midnight."

But she wasn’t the type to surrender.

Not without a fight.

Simon tightened his grip on Alexander’s arm, steadying him as they reached the car.

The call with Evelyn had left him uneasy.

Something was about to break.

And when it did, there would be no turning back.

Vanessa’s fingers trembled as she pulled out her phone.

One text.

That was all it would take.

"Meet me. Now."

She hit send.

The game was on.

Alexander groaned, his head pounding as the world spun around him.

He barely registered Simon’s voice.

"Sir, we need to go."

But his mind was elsewhere—lost in the memory of Evelyn’s defiance.

And the clock was ticking.

Evelyn stood by the window, her reflection pale in the moonlight.

Simon’s question haunted her.

Have you made your choice?

But the truth was, she already had.

She just didn’t know if she could live with it.

Vanessa’s phone buzzed.

A reply.

"Where?"

She smiled.

Checkmate.
###Chapter 20 Breaking Point

Evelyn's grip on her phone turned white-knuckled. "Put him on. Now."

Simon's voice wavered. "Ms. Carter, Mr. Whitmore isn't exactly... coherent right now. Maybe—"

Before he could finish, Alexander, who had been slumped in the backseat, suddenly stirred.

His hand shot out, snatching the phone from Simon with startling precision. "You called for me?"

Simon blinked in disbelief.

Just minutes ago, Alexander had been barely able to stand, his steps unsteady as Simon half-carried him to the car. Now, his gaze was sharp, his voice steady—except for the rough edge of intoxication that clung to his words.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

That voice—low, rough, laced with the lazy confidence of a man who knew exactly what effect he had on her—sent an electric jolt down her spine.

Her skin prickled with awareness.

Even drunk, Alexander Whitmore was dangerously magnetic.

"Evelyn?"

Only when Alexander pronounced her name with deliberate slowness did Evelyn finally snap out of her daze.

She pressed cool fingertips to her flushed cheeks, grounding herself. "Can we meet?"

"Of course," Alexander responded without hesitation, though his words came out slightly slurred, the telltale sign of alcohol loosening his tongue.

"I'll come to the hospital."

"No, don’t rush," Evelyn said, biting her lower lip.

She could practically hear the haze of intoxication in his voice. Serious conversations needed clear heads.

Still, curiosity gnawed at her. What kind of company did he run?

Even in difficult times, a CEO shouldn’t have to personally entertain clients.

Evelyn imagined him as a struggling entrepreneur, forced to swallow his pride for the sake of his business.

Her grip on the phone tightened briefly before she forced herself to relax. "Tomorrow, then. You pick the place."

A beat of silence. Then, she added, "Eleven in the morning?"

The line hummed with quiet anticipation.

The clock struck eleven when Evelyn finally gathered the courage to call. She assumed Alexander would sleep late after last night's drinking, so this hour shouldn't disturb him.

"Eight," Alexander answered, his voice rough as he massaged his temples. The hangover pulsed behind his eyes.

Evelyn blinked. "Eight?"

"Sharp. I'll collect you from the hospital."

He already knew she was being discharged in the morning.

She opened her mouth to protest—he didn’t need to trouble himself—but then remembered their unavoidable meeting. Swallowing her pride, she agreed.

The call ended, leaving Evelyn alone in the sterile hospital room.

Claire had intended to stay, but a last-minute modeling assignment in Milan forced her to catch a red-eye flight. Three years ago, a torn ligament had ended Claire’s ballet career, pushing her into the cutthroat world of fashion. These days, her schedule was relentless.

Not wanting to disrupt Evelyn’s rest, Claire had slipped away at dusk.

Sleep never came that night.

Evelyn stared at the ceiling, her mind racing. The confrontation tomorrow loomed like a storm cloud. Alexander’s cold efficiency on the phone unsettled her. No slurred words, no drunken carelessness—just crisp, sober determination.

She twisted the hospital bracelet around her wrist.

Dawn crept in, pale and uncertain.

By seven, nurses bustled in with discharge papers. Evelyn dressed mechanically, her fingers fumbling with the buttons. Every passing minute tightened the knot in her stomach.

At precisely 7:58, her phone buzzed.

"Outside."

Two syllables. No room for negotiation.

Evelyn took a steadying breath and stepped into the corridor. Whatever awaited her beyond those doors, there was no turning back now.

The automatic doors slid open.

Morning light blinded her momentarily. Then she saw him—Alexander, leaning against a sleek black car, sunglasses shielding his eyes. His crisp white shirt was immaculate, not a trace of last night’s recklessness visible.

"Get in," he said, opening the passenger door. "We have things to discuss."

The engine purred to life.

Evelyn gripped the seatbelt. The real storm was just beginning.

The alarm buzzed at 7:30 AM, pulling Evelyn Carter from sleep.

Her fingers automatically curled around her phone, the screen lighting up with a breaking news notification.

"Caldwell Heir Caught in Midnight Rendezvous—Affair Suspected!"

Evelyn's breath hitched. An Caldwell? That has to be Ethan.

She tapped the alert, and sure enough, Ethan Caldwell's face dominated the screen.

There he was, wrapped around Vanessa Hart, their bodies pressed close as they stumbled out of what looked like a luxury hotel in the dead of night.

Her stomach twisted as she scrolled.

The article detailed how paparazzi had ambushed them at dawn, capturing their exit from the same hotel suite they'd checked into hours earlier.

The implication was undeniable.

Even though Evelyn had known about their complicated history, seeing it splashed across every gossip site still felt like a knife to the ribs.

Her mind spun, a storm of betrayal and disbelief.

The worst part?

Vanessa had the audacity to smile for the cameras.

The photograph showed Ethan desperately shielding Vanessa's face from the flashing cameras.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. There was no denying it now—Vanessa had stolen her fiancé right from under her nose.

Her mind raced to her parents. What would Richard and Margaret think if they saw this?

Would they finally regret choosing Vanessa over her all these years?

The weight of their favoritism pressed down on her chest, making it hard to breathe. The pain was suffocating.

Just then, her bedroom door burst open.

A tall, impeccably dressed man strode in, his expression unreadable.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Evelyn barely had time to react before he spoke, his voice low and deliberate.

"You need to see this."

He tossed a sleek tablet onto the bed beside her.

The screen displayed a breaking news alert—one that would change everything.

Her breath hitched.

This wasn’t just a scandal.

It was war.
###Chapter 21 Let’s Get Married

Alexander's voice was soft, barely above a whisper. "I've handled all the discharge paperwork." His tone carried the warmth of dawn's first light, effortlessly dissolving the lingering fog of uncertainty.

He hesitated, then met Evelyn's gaze. "So…" His fingers brushed against the edge of the hospital bed. "Have you decided?"

He meant the proposal.

Evelyn's eyes flickered to his shirt—the same one he'd worn last time. The third button, the one she'd torn off in frustration, had been carefully reattached.

Her fingers curled into her palm, then relaxed. The tension in her shoulders was unmistakable.

"I'll marry you," she said, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. She reached for her phone. "But I drafted something last night. A prenuptial agreement." She hesitated. "Do you want to read it?"

Alexander went still.

Evelyn watched him closely, searching for any flicker of reaction. His brows drew together, and she frowned. "Did I… say something wrong?"

She hadn't slept. The hours had slipped away as she weighed every possibility, every consequence. She had nothing to offer—nothing but herself.

And yet, here he was, waiting.

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken words.

Then, finally, Alexander exhaled.

"Show me," he said.

Evelyn unlocked her phone, her pulse quickening.

This was it. No turning back.

Alexander was handsome and successful, running his own company. For Evelyn, marrying him seemed like the perfect arrangement.

She considered it carefully before drafting a prenuptial agreement. It wasn’t overly complicated—just a basic outline of their financial arrangements.

The agreement stated they would share living expenses equally after marriage. If they ever divorced, Evelyn would walk away with nothing.

After all, she had nothing to her name right now. She was relying on Alexander to provide her with stability.

“I’ll send you the draft first,” Evelyn said, unlocking her phone.

Just then, Alexander suddenly leaned in, catching her off guard. His fingers wrapped around her wrist. “We don’t need a prenup.”

His scent was crisp—a mix of mint and aftershave, clean and masculine.

The unexpected touch sent a jolt through her. Her gaze dropped to his hand, still holding her wrist, and warmth crept up her cheeks.

“You’ll get half of everything I own,” he murmured, watching as the blush spread to the tips of her ears.

For a moment, he wondered if the sunlight was making her skin flush.

The sunlight streamed through the window, casting golden streaks across the room. Alexander shifted slightly, positioning himself to shield Evelyn from the glare.

"I'll cover all our living expenses," he said, his voice steady.

Evelyn blinked, her lashes fluttering in surprise. "But... what if we divorce? Wouldn't that be unfair to you?"

Alexander's brow arched. "Divorce?"

She inhaled deeply, then nodded.

Her fingers slipped free from his grasp, her voice barely above a whisper. "I have a record. Your family might disapprove. And if things don’t work out between us, or if—"

A shadow flickered across his face, his expression darkening for the briefest moment before clearing.

When Evelyn glanced up, she found him smiling again, the warmth in his eyes undeniable.

"We won’t divorce," he said firmly. "As long as you want this, it’s forever."

Evelyn had never been this close to Alexander before.

A soft breeze drifted in, carrying the scent of blooming flowers. The sunlight played across his features, highlighting the sharp angles of his jaw.

His gaze never wavered from hers, intense and unwavering, filled with a quiet certainty that made her breath catch.

Evelyn froze, her breath catching as she found herself utterly mesmerized by Alexander’s piercing gaze.

The intensity of his eyes held her captive, and when she realized she had been staring for far too long, she quickly looked away, heat rising to her cheeks.

Her pulse raced as she struggled to steady herself. "But I was engaged before," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. "I—"

"Didn’t you say the engagement was broken?" Alexander interrupted smoothly.

She nodded. "It was. But Ethan is powerful. I’m afraid he might—"

"Don’t worry about him," Alexander said, his tone firm and unshaken.

Evelyn’s lips parted in surprise. But he’s Ethan Caldwell, the heir to Cresthaven’s most influential family!

She hesitated before pressing, "What if he tries to hurt you?"

A low chuckle escaped him. "He won’t."

The certainty in his voice made her pause. She searched his expression and found only unwavering confidence.

Alexander’s presence was commanding, his assurance absolute.

Taking a slow breath, Evelyn realized—this was exactly the kind of man she needed by her side.

The crisp morning light streamed through the curtains as Evelyn Carter sat at the edge of her bed, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup.

She had made up her mind.

No more hesitation. No more looking back.

If she wanted a fresh start, she would take it—on her own terms.

Alexander Whitmore had been patient, giving her space, never pushing. But she knew what she wanted now.

Her heart pounded as she lifted her phone, her thumb hovering over his contact.

Then, with a deep breath, she pressed call.

The line connected almost instantly, as if he’d been waiting.

"Evelyn?" His voice was warm, steady.

She didn’t waste time.

"Okay," she said, her voice firm, resolute. "Let’s get married."

Silence stretched for a heartbeat.

Then, she heard the smile in his voice.

"I’ll be there in ten minutes."

The call ended, and Evelyn exhaled, a weight lifting from her shoulders.

She wasn’t running away.

She was choosing.

And she would never regret it.

B

The doorbell rang exactly nine minutes later.

Evelyn opened it to find Alexander standing there, his dark eyes burning with quiet intensity.

No words were needed.

He stepped forward, cupped her face, and kissed her—deep, possessive, sealing the promise between them.

When he pulled back, his thumb brushed her lower lip.

"Pack a bag," he murmured. "We’re eloping."

Evelyn laughed, breathless.

"Right now?"

His grin was sharp, daring.

"Unless you’ve changed your mind?"

She grabbed his collar and kissed him again.

"Not a chance."

The private jet was waiting.

As the engines roared to life, Evelyn stared out the window, her hand entwined with Alexander’s.

No grand ceremony. No family drama.

Just them.

And a future she couldn’t wait to begin.
###Chapter 22 New Beginnings Old Doubts

Alexander gave a quiet nod before stepping out of the hospital room.

When he glanced back and saw Evelyn still rooted in place, he returned to her side and took her hand firmly.

"What's holding you up?" Alexander asked, the corner of his mouth lifting in amusement, his voice warm with suppressed laughter. "Come on. Let's head to City Hall."

"Wait—what?" Evelyn blinked, startled. Before she could protest, she was already following him, her thoughts spinning.

"Right now?" she managed, her voice tinged with disbelief. Everything was happening too quickly.

"Mhm. Problem?" Alexander turned, his gaze locking onto hers with quiet intensity.

She hesitated. "I—I don’t have my documents. I need to go home first."

At the mention of home, Evelyn’s eyes flickered downward, her fingers tightening slightly in his.

The word tasted bitter.

That place wasn’t home anymore.

Not after everything.

Alexander studied her for a long moment before squeezing her hand reassuringly.

"Then we’ll stop by," he said simply, as if it were the easiest thing in the world.

Evelyn swallowed.

She wasn’t ready.

Not for this.

Not for any of it.

But Alexander was already leading her forward, his grip steady, his presence unshakable.

And for once, she let herself be pulled along.

The thought crossed Evelyn's mind like a cold whisper. Two whole days gone, and not a single call from home. I suppose I truly don't matter to them.

But she pushed the bitterness aside. Soon, she'd have a new family—one that might actually care.

"Would tomorrow work for the marriage license instead?" she suggested, her voice tentative.

Alexander paused, considering. "That's fine," he agreed after a beat.

Just then, Evelyn's stomach growled loudly enough to startle them both. She stiffened, pressing a hand to her abdomen as heat flooded her cheeks.

Mortified, she risked a glance at Alexander, terrified he'd find her uncouth.

To her shock, he simply said, "I'm starving too."

His tone was warm as he opened the car door for her. "Your choice—dine out or head straight home?"

Evelyn studied his expression. Not a trace of annoyance. Just quiet patience.

Relief trickled through her, though she hesitated to decide. "Whatever you prefer is fine with me," she murmured, not wanting to overstep.

The evening stretched before them—uncertain, but not unwelcome.

Alexander noticed Evelyn seemed unusually tense. Without comment, he gave a quiet nod and took his place behind the wheel.

The car wound through Cresthaven's bustling downtown before finally pulling up beside a narrow, unmarked alley.

At its end stood a modest eatery—small in footprint but immaculately kept, its polished tables gleaming under warm pendant lights.

After ordering, Alexander excused himself to answer a call. By the time he returned, their dishes had just arrived.

The spread was simple but thoughtfully prepared—delicate flavors ideal for someone still regaining strength like Evelyn.

"You'll like this place. I'm here often," Alexander said, nudging the plates closer to her.

Evelyn eyed the portions. "This is too much for one person."

She slid a steaming bowl of lemongrass-infused soup toward him. "Share with me."

The owner emerged from the kitchen, her face brightening in recognition. "Alexander! Weren't you just here for breakfast?"

Evelyn's fork stilled mid-air as she shot him a questioning look.

Alexander shifted uncomfortably, an uncharacteristic flush creeping up his neck as he avoided the café owner's gaze. "You must be confusing me with someone else," he said smoothly, though his fingers tapped restlessly against the table. "Business must be keeping you busy."

The owner frowned, scratching her temple. "Could've sworn it was you," she muttered. "First customer at dawn, before the birds even started chirping. We had a whole conversation."

She distinctly remembered asking, "Up this early for work?"

And him answering, "Yeah. Got someone important to meet later."

Now, she second-guessed herself. Maybe she had mistaken him. Still, something didn’t sit right.

Beside him, Evelyn’s grip on her fork tightened. She had been about to slide the last bite of her omelet toward Alexander—his claim of hunger a transparent excuse to ease her discomfort.

The realization hit her like a whisper in the dark.

Does he actually… care?

Her fingers twisted the hem of her skirt absently, a strange warmth unfurling in her chest. Maybe—just maybe—this man wasn’t the ice-cold stranger she’d assumed him to be.

Before she could dwell on it, Alexander turned to her, his gaze sharp and deliberate.

"After this," he said, voice low, "let’s go get your documents together."
###Chapter 23 The Scarf and the Past

The spoon in Evelyn's hand froze mid-air at Alexander's question.

Her parents' cold indifference flashed through her mind. She lowered her lashes, hiding the sudden ache in her chest. "No," she murmured. "I can go back alone."

She didn’t want him to know. Didn’t want anyone to know how little she mattered to them.

Alexander studied her for a long moment but said nothing.

Then—

The restaurant's television blared to life with breaking entertainment news. The volume was jarring, and Evelyn instinctively turned toward the screen.

There they were—Ethan Caldwell and Vanessa Hart, swarmed by paparazzi outside a hotel suite.

Vanessa hid behind Ethan, her face buried in her hands as camera flashes exploded around them. The shot panned to reveal the massive bed behind them—rumpled sheets, half-empty champagne glasses.

Security guards struggled to control the chaos.

Evelyn's breath caught when the bold headline flashed across the screen:

"SCANDAL: HEIR ETHAN CALDWELL CAUGHT IN COMPROMISING POSITION WITH STEPSISTER VANESSA HART!"

Her fingers tightened around the spoon.

The past never really stayed buried, did it?

The words "LIVE" flashed in bold red letters on the television screen.

Evelyn blinked in disbelief. Are they seriously still trapped in that hotel?

Alexander followed her gaze to the TV, his expression unreadable.

Just as the news reporter began speaking, his phone buzzed insistently. He snatched it up and strode out of the room, pausing only to flick the television off with a sharp gesture.

Evelyn frowned. "What was that for?"

Alexander tilted his head, phone still pressed to his ear. "Too noisy. Distracting."

She pressed her lips together but said nothing more. Finishing the last bite of her meal, she rose just as he ended the call.

"You sure you don’t want me to come with you?" His voice was low, knowing.

Alexander wasn’t blind—he knew Hawthorne Estate was anything but welcoming for Evelyn. His presence might at least keep the wolves at bay.

She shook her head firmly. "I’ll manage."

He didn’t push. "Fine. I’ve got business to handle. Once you get your things, head straight to my place."

Evelyn nodded, memorizing the address he rattled off. Later, when she pulled it up on her phone, she wasn’t surprised to find it was one of the most exclusive high-rises in Cresthaven.

The kind of place with security that required retinal scans.

The kind of place where people like Alexander Whitmore belonged.

She pocketed her phone, her fingers brushing against the folded scarf in her coat.

The one that still smelled faintly of cedar and regret.

Evelyn had always assumed Alexander was just an ordinary entrepreneur, but the sleek black Mercedes he drove suggested otherwise.

As his car disappeared around the corner, she blinked, realization dawning.

Had she really never asked his full name all this time?

Then again, it hardly mattered now. They were bound by marriage—there would be countless opportunities to ask later.

Hailing a cab, Evelyn directed the driver toward the Hawthorne Estate.

The wrought-iron gates stood firmly closed. She pressed the buzzer twice before a maid cracked the door open just enough to peer out.

Recognition flashed across the woman's face. "Miss Carter? You've returned?"

Evelyn gave a quiet hum of acknowledgment and stepped inside without waiting for invitation.

"Miss Carter..." The maid wrung her hands. "Were you... looking for Mrs. Hayes? She's resting with a migraine. Said she wasn't to be disturbed." Her gaze lingered on Evelyn's thin frame with poorly concealed pity.

Who would've imagined, the maid thought, the true heiress of the Hayes fortune would spend three years behind bars? Look at her—all sharp angles and hollow cheeks. That prison must've been hell.

The grand foyer felt colder than she remembered. Evelyn's fingers brushed against the silk scarf around her neck—Alexander's parting gift that morning. The delicate fabric whispered against her skin, a stark contrast to the heavy memories pressing down on her.

Somewhere upstairs, her stepmother's migraine was undoubtedly real. Margaret Hayes always did develop headaches when inconvenient truths came knocking.

Evelyn's lips curved without humor. Three years changed many things, but some patterns remained stubbornly unchanged.

Evelyn's voice was firm as she spoke. "I didn't come for her. Where are my belongings? Where did they store them?"

The servant hesitated briefly before answering, "In the storage room, ma'am."

Giving a curt nod, Evelyn strode toward the storage room without another word.

Her possessions had been carelessly crammed into a small, battered box tucked away in the darkest corner.

A thick layer of dust coated the lid, sending Evelyn into a brief coughing fit as she lifted it. She waved a hand to clear the air before sifting through the contents.

Her documents were right where she expected them to be.

She had no intention of lingering. After retrieving what she needed, she started to close the box—

Then she saw it.

Tucked beneath a stack of old papers lay a neatly folded men’s scarf.

The gray knitted fabric had dulled with time, its once-soft texture now rough beneath her fingertips.

Her breath caught.

Slowly, she knelt and traced the worn threads, memories flooding back in an unwelcome rush.

The familiarity of it was almost cruel.

Without hesitation, Evelyn pulled it free, draping it over her arm.

She would toss it in the nearest trash bin on her way out.

Some things weren’t worth keeping.

The silk scarf slipped through Evelyn's fingers like a forgotten memory.

She finally understood—it never truly belonged to her. Just like Ethan Caldwell, it was never meant to stay.

With a deep breath, she turned away from the storage room, ready to leave the past behind.

But fate had other plans.

She barely took two steps before colliding with someone in a frantic rush.

Vanessa Hart stumbled back, her face pale, her breath ragged—as if she were running from something unseen.

The impact sent Vanessa sprawling onto the floor with a sharp cry.

When her wide, startled eyes locked onto Evelyn, disbelief flickered across her face.

"You?" Vanessa gasped. "What are you doing here?"

The air between them crackled with tension.

Evelyn's grip tightened around the scarf she still held.

Some things, it seemed, weren't so easy to let go.
###Chapter 24 Showdown at Hawthorne Estate

The icy glare Evelyn Carter shot Vanessa Hart could have frozen lava. "This is my family home. Why wouldn't I be here?"

Vanessa’s smirk died the second she spotted the silk scarf clutched in Evelyn’s fingers.

She recognized it instantly—Ethan Caldwell’s signature navy-blue Burberry. The same one Evelyn had guarded like a sacred relic for a decade.

"Pathetic." Vanessa’s manicured nails dug into her palms. "You think returning that will make him forgive you? That he’d ever take you back?"

Evelyn exhaled through her nose. No games today. "Your imagination is exhausting. I’m not here for him."

"Then you’ve seen the headlines." Vanessa’s lips curled.

Ah. Those.

The "leaked" photos of Evelyn and Ethan’s "secret reunion" at dawn—splashed across every gossip site by noon.

What Vanessa didn’t know? The paparazzi ambush was her own doing. A staged crisis to manipulate Ethan into comforting her when the "scandal" broke.

Too bad Evelyn had already burned the evidence.

The morning sunlight streamed through the curtains, but Vanessa Hart felt no warmth.

She had never intended for things to go this far.

Her carefully orchestrated plan had been simple - stage a compromising situation with Ethan Caldwell, leak a few suggestive photos to the press, and pressure the Caldwell family into switching their engagement to her instead of Evelyn.

Vanessa had expected Ethan to come running home, begging his mother Eleanor to change his fiancée.

She was certain Titan Capital Group would prioritize their reputation over everything else. A quiet engagement swap would be far better than a public scandal that could tank their stock prices.

But fate had other plans.

The paparazzi she'd tipped off weren't gossip columnists - they were investigative journalists from a major news network.

Vanessa's blood ran cold when she stepped out of the hotel this morning.

Dozens of cameras flashed in her face. Microphones were shoved toward her. Reporters shouted questions about stealing her sister's fiancé.

By noon, the story had exploded across every news outlet.

#CorporateHeirAffair was trending nationwide.

Vanessa's phone hadn't stopped buzzing with notifications - most of them vicious comments from outraged netizens.

The morning stock reports showed Titan Capital's shares had plummeted 15% at opening bell.

What should have been a controlled leak had turned into a wildfire.

Vanessa paced her bedroom, nails digging into her palms.

She'd miscalculated. Badly.

The Caldwell family would be furious. Evelyn would never forgive her. And Alexander Whitmore...

A shiver ran down her spine at the thought of Evelyn's powerful husband.

The bedroom door burst open.

Vanessa spun around to face her stepmother Margaret, whose face was pale with fury.

"Get downstairs," Margaret hissed. "Now. The Caldwells are here."

Vanessa's stomach dropped.

The reckoning had come sooner than she expected.

Taking a shaky breath, she smoothed her dress and headed toward the storm waiting downstairs at Hawthorne Estate.

This wasn't how it was supposed to go.

Not at all.

Vanessa's hands trembled with barely contained rage.

She cursed her own recklessness, her mind racing to figure out who had tipped off the media and turned her carefully laid plans into a public spectacle.

"Evelyn, you saw it, didn't you? Ethan shielding me from the cameras like that—he only has eyes for me." Vanessa forced a smirk, her voice dripping with venom as she locked eyes with Evelyn. "Do you honestly think groveling now would make him spare you a second glance?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, done with this charade.

"If digging through trash for men is your hobby, by all means, keep Ethan. He's all yours." She brushed past Vanessa, ready to walk away.

Not a flicker of emotion crossed Evelyn's face at the mention of Ethan.

Vanessa gaped, disbelief twisting her features. "You're seriously giving him up? Then why bother with that scarf? Weren't you planning to use it to manipulate his nostalgia?"

Evelyn glanced at the silk scarf in her hand, then shrugged. "I was just looking for a trash can." With a careless flick of her wrist, she tossed it into the bin beside them.

Vanessa's mouth fell open—

"EVELYN!" A thunderous roar echoed from the staircase. "WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR SISTER? WHY IS SHE ON THE FLOOR?"

The accusation hung in the air like a guillotine's blade.

Evelyn rushed down the grand staircase, her heart pounding as she spotted Vanessa sprawled on the marble floor, her face twisted in exaggerated distress.

"Did you shove your sister?" Margaret demanded, her voice sharp as she helped Vanessa up, shooting Evelyn a glare that could freeze fire. "Honestly, Evelyn, must you stir up chaos the moment you step foot in this house? Are you determined to send me to an early grave?"

Margaret fussed over Vanessa, checking for injuries with trembling hands, only exhaling when she confirmed her precious daughter was unharmed.

Evelyn, however, felt nothing but icy detachment. That fateful night had shattered any lingering illusions about her family. "I didn’t lay a finger on her," she said coolly. "But by all means, ask her yourself."

Margaret turned to Vanessa, who immediately put on a pitiful expression. "It was an accident, Mother. I tripped."

Margaret’s eyes narrowed in disbelief. "Vanessa, darling, you don’t have to protect her. If she hurt you, just say so."

Vanessa shook her head, casting a sidelong glance at Evelyn. "Really, it was my fault. Evelyn, don’t be upset with Mother. She just misunderstood."

A bitter smirk curled Evelyn’s lips as she turned to leave. Then, pausing at the doorway, she tossed over her shoulder, "Tell me, Mother—did you catch the headlines this morning?"

The air thickened with tension.

Margaret’s face paled.

Vanessa’s fingers twitched.

And Evelyn?

She walked away without another word, leaving the question hanging like a guillotine.
###Chapter 25: Shattered Trust

Vanessa's face went rigid the moment Evelyn spoke. A flicker of guilt passed through her eyes before she could mask it.

Just as predicted, Margaret's expression darkened the instant Evelyn mentioned the scandal.

Margaret had always believed her obedient eldest daughter would never stoop to such disgraceful behavior.

But the televised reports had laid out every sordid detail, and she'd spent the entire morning wrestling with the humiliation.

Pressing her lips into a thin line, Margaret demanded, "Vanessa, tell me the truth. Did you and Ethan really—?"

Tears pooled in Vanessa's eyes before spilling over in perfect, practiced drops. "I'm so sorry, Mother. Ethan drank too much last night. He took me to the hotel, and I... I was too frightened to stop him."

Margaret's frown deepened. "That reckless boy! He's already engaged to Evelyn! How dare he force himself on you?"

Vanessa dabbed delicately at her reddened eyes. "He wasn't in his right mind, Mother. It wasn't entirely his fault. And poor Evelyn... she's suffering the most in all this."

Her voice cracked with just the right amount of remorse.

Margaret exhaled sharply, torn between fury and maternal instinct.

Evelyn watched the performance unfold, her fingers tightening around her teacup.

Vanessa had always been skilled at playing the victim.

But this time, Evelyn wouldn't let her get away with it.

The realization hit Evelyn like a cold splash of water—Margaret was still standing there, watching.

She knew how deeply Evelyn loved Ethan. The pain must be unbearable for her now.

But Margaret only scoffed. "If she couldn't even keep her man in check, whose fault is that? If Evelyn hadn't provoked Ethan that night, you wouldn’t have had to beg on her behalf and ruin your own reputation!"

Her sharp gaze then sliced toward Evelyn. "Look at the mess you've caused. Because of you, Vanessa had to sacrifice her dignity to Ethan, and now she’s the one paying the price."

Evelyn froze mid-step, her blood turning to ice. "You’re joking, right? They are the ones who betrayed me, and you’re blaming me?"

Sometimes, she truly questioned who the real daughter was in this family.

Why does everything always circle back to me?

Vanessa was predictable—she had always been desperate to steal Evelyn’s place and her parents' affection.

But her parents?

Were they truly this blind?

Couldn’t they see the truth?

It was humiliating. Disgusting.

And worst of all—it broke her heart all over again.

Vanessa's perfectly manicured eyebrow arched in mockery. "Did I drag them to that hotel room? Your favoritism is showing, Mother. Push me too far, and I'll leak everything to the press—how long they've been sneaking around, how Ethan Caldwell made her get rid of two babies! You want to play dirty? Let's burn it all down!"

Margaret gasped, clutching her chest. "How dare you! You're spouting nonsense!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn turned on her heel, slamming the door so hard the walls trembled. The sound echoed through the Hawthorne Estate, leaving Margaret and Vanessa in stunned silence.

It took Margaret a full minute to find her voice again. Her hands shook as she gripped Vanessa's arm. "Tell me it isn't true. You and Ethan? Abortions?"

Vanessa's face flickered—just for a second—before melting into wounded innocence. "Mother, Evelyn is desperate. She’s lashing out because she’s cornered. I would never betray her like that."

Margaret exhaled, shoulders sagging in relief. "Of course, darling. That girl was raised in chaos—lies come too easily to her. If only she had your grace."

Vanessa’s lips curved into a satisfied smile. "We should be patient with her. She was wronged today, after all."

"Wronged?" Margaret scoffed. "Her reputation is already—"

The words cut deeper than any knife. "This is Evelyn's fault, not Vanessa's. What does she have to complain about? Three years in prison and she's still the same troublemaker."

Margaret Hayes clenched her fists, her anger boiling over. "That girl is beyond redemption!"

Vanessa sniffled dramatically, dabbing at nonexistent tears. "After last night's scandal, I'll never be able to show my face in society again."

A migraine pulsed behind Margaret's temples, but she forced a comforting hand on her stepdaughter's shoulder. "This is entirely Ethan Caldwell's doing. Your father will demand answers from him. He's destroyed your reputation - he'll have to make this right."

Vanessa exhaled in quiet triumph. Ethan had always been putty in her hands. Soon, she'd be Mrs. Caldwell, just as planned.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter stormed out of Hawthorne Estate, her chest heaving. The crisp autumn air did little to cool her fury.

She remembered her naive sixteen-year-old self returning to this gilded cage with stars in her eyes. Now, every brick of the mansion made her skin crawl.

"Enough," Evelyn muttered, flagging down a taxi. The past couldn't chain her forever.

Forty minutes later, the cab pulled up to a sleek high-rise in downtown Cresthaven. Evelyn paid the driver with trembling hands, stepping into the shadow of the building where her new life waited.

The apartment complex stood in one of the most coveted districts, tucked away from the city's chaos yet conveniently close to subway stations and bus stops. Though the buildings weren't brand new—perhaps constructed a decade ago—the grounds were immaculate, and the security gates hummed with quiet efficiency.

Evelyn handed the cab driver a crisp bill and stepped onto the pavement, her heels clicking against the cobblestone walkway. The evening air carried the faint scent of jasmine from the landscaped gardens.

Just as the elevator doors slid open, her phone buzzed violently in her clutch.

She hesitated, fingers tightening around the device. The caller ID flashed—Vanessa Hart.

A cold prickle ran down her spine.

Vanessa never called without an agenda.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and swiped to answer.

"Where are you?" Vanessa's voice was sharp, laced with something brittle.

"Home," Evelyn replied, stepping into the elevator. The mirrored walls reflected her tense expression.

"You need to come to Willowbrook Apartments. Now."

The demand sent a jolt through her. Willowbrook—where Alexander had been staying since their last explosive argument.

"Why?" Evelyn's grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

Vanessa's laugh was humorless. "Because your husband isn't who you think he is."

The elevator dinged, doors opening to her floor.

But Evelyn didn’t move.

Her pulse roared in her ears.

"What does that mean?" she demanded.

Vanessa's voice dropped to a whisper. "Just come. And bring your divorce lawyer."

The line went dead.

Evelyn stood frozen, the phone slipping from her fingers.

The polished marble floor beneath her suddenly felt like quicksand.
###Chapter 26 Our Marriage License

The phone buzzed with Claire's name flashing on the screen. Evelyn swiped to answer without hesitation.

"Sweetheart, I completely lost track of time! Is today your discharge day?"

The distant chatter of a film set hummed through the receiver. Claire must have stolen a moment between takes.

"If you don’t want to return to Hawthorne Estate, you can crash at my place for now. I’ll text you the address and the entry code—"

Evelyn shook her head instinctively. "That’s not necessary. You and Lucas are married. It wouldn’t be right for me to stay there."

Even though Claire and Lucas’s marriage was purely transactional—devoid of any real affection—they were still legally bound.

Staying at their home while Claire was away filming? Absolutely out of the question.

She refused to invite even a whisper of impropriety.

Claire’s voice tightened with concern. "Then where will you go?"

Evelyn exhaled, fingers tracing the edge of her hospital blanket.

"To my fiancé’s place."

Claire's voice erupted through the phone, sharp with disbelief.

"Evelyn Carter, I thought you swore off chasing after toxic men like Ethan Caldwell! What's this nonsense about going back to him? Have you lost your mind? I should fly back right now and shake some sense into you!"

She had seen the scandalous headlines during her layover—Ethan and Vanessa Hart's disgraceful hotel rendezvous splashed across every tabloid. The sheer audacity of those two made her blood boil.

Claire had called to console her best friend, only to hear Evelyn mention an engagement. Her stomach dropped.

"Tell me you're not crawling back to that cheating snake. He humiliated you in front of the entire city, and you're still tolerating it?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

"You've got it all wrong. The man I'm engaged to isn't Ethan."

Silence.

Then—

"Excuse me?" Claire's voice pitched higher. "Since when are you seeing someone else? Who is he? What does he do? How did this even happen?"

Evelyn bit her lip.

She couldn't answer a single one of those questions.

Claire knew just as little about her supposed fiancé as I did.

"I'll explain everything soon," I whispered into the phone. "I just got to his place. Talk later."

The keypad beeped softly as Evelyn entered the code. The house stood silent, empty.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, painting golden stripes across the hardwood floors. The space wasn’t grand, but it felt warm—like a place where laughter should live.

Yet, it lacked personality. No scattered books, no half-drunk coffee mugs.

Does Alexander even live here?

She slipped off her heels and padded through the rooms in borrowed slippers. Just as she reached the kitchen, her phone buzzed.

Groceries are stocked. Cook if you want. If not, order in. The black card is on the shoe rack—no limit. Use it.

A second message followed.

Working late. Don’t wait up. We’ll get the license tomorrow at nine.

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the screen before she turned toward the entryway. The sleek metallic card glinted under the hallway light.

She picked it up, weighing it in her palm.

This wasn’t hers. Not really.

Alexander’s generosity came from obligation—a debt owed for pulling him out of a wrecked car years ago.

And debts, no matter how freely given, weren’t meant to be exploited.

His vow of forever meant nothing to her.

She had learned the hard way that promises were as fleeting as morning dew. Once burned, twice shy.

Meanwhile, Alexander waited. Five minutes passed without a reply from Evelyn. A shadow of disappointment flickered across his face.

His lips pressed into a thin line as he powered off his phone.

"Mr. Whitmore, Titan Capital Group's stocks crashed this morning. Even Mr. Whitmore Sr. has been alerted." Simon placed two documents on the desk. "The media storm is escalating. PR drafted a damage control plan—should we proceed?"

Given the Whitmore name was at stake, the PR team treaded carefully, seeking Alexander’s approval first.

Alexander didn’t bother looking up. His voice was ice. "Tell PR to stand down. Whoever started this mess can clean it up themselves."

Simon nodded and left, shutting the door quietly behind him.

Thirty minutes later, Ethan Caldwell barged in, face flushed with fury. "Alexander, have you lost your mind? This scandal is spiraling, and you’re refusing PR intervention? Do you want the entire Cresthaven laughing at us?"

The silence in the office was suffocating.

Ethan Caldwell stood frozen, his earlier bravado crumbling under the weight of his own recklessness. He had acted without thinking, and now the consequences loomed before him.

Alexander Whitmore remained seated, his gaze fixed on the documents spread across his desk. His fingers moved methodically, flipping through pages as if Ethan hadn’t spoken at all. The indifference was more cutting than any outburst.

Ethan swallowed hard, his pulse hammering in his throat. He had expected anger, a confrontation—anything but this chilling disregard.

He hesitated, then tried again, his voice quieter this time.

"Alexander?"

Still, no response.

The air between them thickened with tension, heavy enough to suffocate. Ethan clenched his fists, frustration warring with unease.

He had crossed a line.

And now, he wasn’t sure how to step back.
###Chapter 27 The Unwanted Spotlight

Ethan Caldwell was fuming. Last night, Lucas Bennett had insisted on dragging him to Eclipse Lounge, and after just two glasses of their strongest whiskey, his memory had completely blacked out.

He had no recollection of how he ended up at the hotel with Vanessa Hart.

This morning, he was ambushed by reporters right outside his suite, their cameras flashing relentlessly. The humiliation burned through him.

"Alexander, don’t you have anything to say?"

Only then did Alexander Whitmore lower the financial report in his hands. His piercing gaze locked onto Ethan.

"Feeling ashamed now, are you? You made this mess. Clean it up yourself."

The ice in his voice sent a shiver down Ethan’s spine.

"Alexander, we’re both Whitmores. This scandal tarnishes the entire family’s reputation. And even if you don’t care about me, are you really going to stand by while Titan Capital Group’s stocks keep crashing?"

Alexander let out a derisive laugh, unmoved. "If Titan Capital can survive this, so can you. After dragging our name through the mud, you still have the nerve to ask for my help? Where do you get that audacity?"

Ethan clenched his fists. The weight of his mistake pressed down on him, but desperation clawed at his throat.

He had underestimated Alexander’s ruthlessness.

And now, he was drowning in the consequences.

Ethan Caldwell thought Alexander Whitmore was being unnecessarily cruel.

Then again, perhaps it was justified. Titan Capital Group had been dragged into this mess because of him, and in a single morning, billions had been wiped from its value. Every shareholder probably loathed him by now.

Just then, Simon Graves knocked and entered. His gaze flickered to Ethan before he spoke. "Vanessa Hart is here to see you, Mr. Whitmore."

Ethan moved to step out, but Alexander's voice cut through the air like ice. "Bring her in."

Vanessa wasted no time. "Ethan, this scandal is spiraling out of control. Horizon Enterprises' stock is taking a hit. If we don’t contain this, the losses will be catastrophic."

The moment Vanessa stepped inside and saw Alexander, her breath hitched. She quickly composed herself. "Mr. Whitmore."

Ethan’s attention snapped to the scarf draped over Vanessa’s arm—the very one he had given Evelyn Carter a decade ago.

His jaw tightened. "That’s—"

"I found it in the trash at Hawthorne Estate this morning. My sister must have thrown it out." Vanessa tilted her head. "I remember this was yours, Ethan. Do you still want it?"

A muscle twitched in Ethan’s temple. His voice dropped dangerously low. "How thoughtful. Evelyn—oh, she’s perfect."

Vanessa's face twisted with guilt and regret. "Perhaps this morning's scandal was too much for Evelyn... Ethan, maybe I should talk to her personally..."

Ethan's voice was icy. "Alexander, I'm breaking off my engagement with Evelyn. Vanessa is the one I'm marrying now!"

His thoughts burned with vengeance. How dare Evelyn discard my belongings like trash? I'll make sure she lives to regret this!

She only had the courage because of our engagement.

Let's see who'll protect her when she's no longer my fiancée!

Alexander's gaze darkened, a storm brewing in his eyes. "Oh?"

Ethan's jaw tightened. "Just announce that Evelyn spent three years in prison—she was never worthy of me. Vanessa has been my choice all along. We simply hadn't made it public yet. That way, the scandal this morning will be justified."

Vanessa's heart soared.

The stage was perfectly set, the drama unfolding exactly as she had envisioned. She had been searching for the right moment to suggest this to Ethan, but he had taken the initiative himself.

In her original plan, things weren’t supposed to escalate this dramatically. Her reputation wasn’t meant to be tarnished so publicly.

But the outcome was the same.

Marrying Ethan was worth every sacrifice. Even her ruined reputation.

The moment those words were spoken, Alexander's cup crashed onto the marble table with a deafening crack.

The air in the room turned thick with tension, making Ethan and Vanessa freeze in their seats.

His voice was dangerously low. "Say that again. She doesn't deserve me?"

The icy fury in Alexander's gaze sent a shiver down their spines.

###Chapter 28 What About Evelyn

The air crackled with tension as Alexander's voice cut through the room like a blade.

"Didn't Evelyn already explain the prison incident? It was Vanessa who set her up, who manipulated everything to get her locked away."

His words were sharp, each one landing with precision.

"You're the one who betrayed Evelyn, and now you're trying to twist the truth? To make her the villain?"

Alexander's glare was icy, his posture rigid with barely contained fury.

"Calling off the engagement? Fine. I don’t care. But don’t you dare drag women into this mess just to save your own skin."

His voice dropped lower, laced with disgust.

"What exactly did Evelyn do wrong? You were the one who changed. She was the one who suffered. And now you want to use your affair to cover your tracks? To blame her for your mistakes?"

A bitter laugh escaped him.

"Ethan, real men don’t act like cowards. What you’re doing is pathetic. You’re not just humiliating yourself—you’re dragging the Caldwell name through the mud."

Ethan’s face paled, then flushed with anger. His fists clenched at his sides, knuckles white.

"Enough!" he snapped, his voice shaking.

"Fine. I’ll take full responsibility. I’ll tell the press it was just a falling out between Evelyn and me."

He turned sharply, already striding toward the door.

"I’m heading to the press conference with Vanessa."

Alexander didn’t move, didn’t stop him.

But his expression darkened, his mind already racing with the consequences of Ethan’s next move.

And what it would mean for Evelyn.

The situation was spiraling out of control.

Ethan Caldwell wanted to settle everything today—the longer this dragged on, the worse it would get.

Alexander Whitmore responded with icy detachment. "Do as you please. But has your mother been informed?"

At the mention of Eleanor, Ethan's face tightened.

Eleanor had never approved of Vanessa Hart, dismissing her as a social climber unworthy of the Caldwell name.

Originally, Ethan had planned to hold a press conference immediately. Once the news broke, Eleanor would have no choice but to accept it, whether she liked Vanessa or not.

Ethan remained silent, but Alexander seemed to read his thoughts.

With a dismissive wave, he signaled for them to leave.

As they stepped out, Vanessa felt a strange mix of relief and unease.

"Ethan, are you sure we shouldn't tell your mother first?" she asked hesitantly. "And what about Evelyn? What if she refuses to let you go?"

That was Vanessa's greatest fear.

Acting without Eleanor's approval meant she was already making an enemy of the family before even officially becoming part of it.

Worse, Evelyn Carter wasn't the type to surrender quietly.

Vanessa knew that better than anyone.

Then there was Evelyn. She couldn't shake the thought that Ethan seemed to favor her now, but deep down, she wondered—had his feelings for Evelyn truly vanished during their seven years together?

A cold dread settled in Vanessa's chest. What if Evelyn regretted everything and begged Ethan to take her back?

Ethan, however, seemed entirely unbothered. He leaned down, pressing a kiss to Vanessa's forehead.

"Why waste time worrying?" His voice was firm. "I’ve already chosen you. She could never compare."

He smirked, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. "And as for my mother? It’s my marriage, not hers."

Before they could walk further, Simon Graves called out from behind them.

"Ms. Hart, a moment, please."

Vanessa turned, brows furrowing. "Mr. Graves? Does Mr. Whitmore need something else?"

Simon’s gaze was heavy with unspoken meaning. "Mr. Whitmore admires your decisiveness. He gave you three days, yet you overturned the entire situation in one."

A pause. Then, his tone sharpened. "However, your methods were… ruthless. Titan Capital’s stocks plummeted because of your move. He’ll let it slide this time, but once you’re part of the Whitmore family, there are certain rules you’ll need to follow."

Vanessa’s expression hardened. The air around her turned icy.

Vanessa held her breath.

She watched Simon carefully, wondering if he was deliberately revealing to Ethan that she had planned everything from last night.

Her fingers tightened around her purse strap as she guiltily glanced at Ethan.

Ethan frowned, his voice sharp. "What three days?"

Simon feigned surprise, hesitating dramatically. "Oh? I must have misspoken. Mr. Whitmore actually asked me to discuss this privately with Ms. Hart." He gave Vanessa an apologetic smile that didn’t reach his eyes. "This seems to be a matter between you and Mr. Caldwell. You should explain it to him yourself."

Without another word, Simon turned and walked away, leaving silence in his wake.

The air between them grew heavy.

Ethan’s expression darkened as realization dawned.

"So," he said slowly, his voice dangerously calm, "the reporters at Titan Capital this morning—you arranged them, didn’t you? This was all your doing?"

Vanessa’s pulse raced.

She had hoped to control the situation, but now it was slipping through her fingers.

Ethan’s gaze bore into her, demanding answers.

She swallowed hard.

The game had just become much more dangerous.
###Chapter 29 The Consequences of My Actions

Vanessa bit her lower lip until she tasted blood.

She knew Ethan better than anyone—once suspicion took root in his mind, it would only grow deeper unless she confessed everything.

"Ethan," she began, her voice trembling slightly. "I only wanted a few paparazzi shots. I never imagined it would attract television crews and spiral out of control like this."

Ethan had always been fond of Vanessa. He had even defied his family's wishes, considering marriage despite their disapproval.

But being forced into a situation against his will? That was something Ethan Caldwell would never tolerate.

Being manipulated only fueled his defiance.

Seeing the storm brewing in Ethan's expression, Vanessa reached for his hand. "Ethan, I just... I want us to be together."

Ethan didn't answer. He kept walking, his strides long and deliberate.

"Ethan?" When he pulled away from her touch, her eyes instantly welled with tears.

Only then did he finally turn to face her, his voice cold.

A wave of helplessness crashed over me. "Wasn't there supposed to be a press conference? The reporters are already waiting. You should dry those tears before facing them!"

At his words, Vanessa finally exhaled in relief.

She rushed forward, throwing her arms around Ethan’s waist, pressing herself against him. Her voice was soft, trembling with desperation.

"Love makes people selfish. I just want to be by your side, Ethan. I’ll take all the blame, but Alexander only gave me three days. If I can’t convince you, he’ll ruin me."

Her fingers tightened around him. "I don’t care about myself, but I can’t bear to lose you. I had no other choice."

Ethan hesitated.

Memories of Vanessa’s silent sacrifices over the years flickered through his mind. A pang of sympathy twisted in his chest.

Love was selfish. Maybe Vanessa had gone too far—but only because she loved him too much.

Unlike Evelyn.

Evelyn had never schemed against him.

His gaze dropped, shadows darkening his eyes.

Meanwhile, sleep eluded Evelyn.

Perhaps it was the unfamiliar surroundings, or perhaps it was the knowledge that tomorrow morning, she and Alexander would sign their marriage license.

Whatever the reason, she tossed restlessly in bed, sheets tangling around her legs.

Then—

The faint click of the door lock echoed through the silent room.

Evelyn glanced at the clock. Midnight had come and gone. Her pulse quickened as she wondered, "Could it be him?"

She slid her feet into the plush slippers and padded toward the hallway. Just as she reached the entrance, the door swung open from the outside.

A tall figure in a tailored suit staggered in, reeking of expensive whiskey. Alexander—her husband—lost his balance the moment he crossed the threshold, collapsing against her with a heavy thud.

Evelyn gasped, unprepared for the sudden weight. His muscular frame pressed against hers, sending a jolt through her body.

Her breath hitched.

The intoxicating scent of his cologne mixed with the sharp tang of alcohol enveloped her. His nose grazed her cheek, the warmth of his skin making her face burn.

Behind them, the door slammed shut, plunging the foyer into darkness.

In the suffocating silence, his ragged breaths filled the space between them. The faint brush of his lips against her temple sent shivers down her spine.

She turned her head slightly—too quickly—and her lips accidentally skimmed the rough stubble along his jaw.

Electricity shot through her veins. Her heart hammered so loudly she was certain he could hear it.

A single, panicked thought raced through her mind:

What had she just done?

Had she—had she really just kissed him?

Her fingers quivered against his chest as Evelyn instinctively tightened her grip on Alexander's shirt, her heart pounding wildly.

She barely managed to steady him before he could collapse.

Her gaze dropped to his face, searching for any sign of awareness.

Thankfully, he was too far gone—his forehead resting heavily against her shoulder, his breathing deep and uneven.

Relief washed over her.

"Are you alright?" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

How much did he drink to end up like this?

Running a company must be exhausting.

Alexander didn’t answer.

But when her lips accidentally brushed against his temple, his lashes fluttered.

In one swift motion, his arms wrapped around her waist, pulling her flush against him.

The scent of whiskey clung to his breath as he murmured, voice rough with sleep and intoxication, "Sweetheart... you're still awake?"

Evelyn froze.

Sweetheart?

Since when did he call her that?

Her pulse spiked.

And then—

She realized something far more dangerous.

What had she just done?
###Chapter 30: Midnight Confessions

Evelyn's breath hitched when Alexander called her "wife." The word struck her like a bolt of lightning.

Wife.

But then again, they were getting their marriage license tomorrow. It wasn’t entirely wrong.

Alexander’s voice was slow, slightly slurred from the alcohol. "Were you waiting up for me?"

She didn’t answer, guiding him to the sofa instead.

The usually composed man seemed different tonight—less sharp, almost… soft. Vulnerable.

Like a puppy.

The absurd thought flickered through her mind before she dismissed it.

"Do you want water?" Evelyn crouched in front of him, tilting her head up to meet his gaze. "Should I get you some?"

His eyes were closed, his breathing steady, as if he might drift off any second.

When he didn’t respond, she started to rise—

A strong hand suddenly wrapped around the back of her neck, yanking her backward.

She gasped, losing balance, and landed with one knee braced against his lap.

Before Evelyn could react, Alexander crushed his forehead against hers.

Their gazes locked, and Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed, hammering so violently she feared her ribs might crack.

The alcohol radiating from him carried an edge of raw dominance.

His exhale, thick with whiskey, ghosted over her lips.

Just as she started to relax—

His mouth crashed onto hers, scorching and insistent.

Evelyn's thoughts scattered like leaves in a storm.

This can't be real.

Otherwise, why am I straddling his lap, his fingers digging into my hips, dragging me flush against him?

Shock paralyzed her. By the time sense returned, her lips were already parted, his shirt crumpled beneath her desperate grip.

Reality snapped back like a whip.

She shoved him away without a glance and bolted to her room.

The door slammed.

On the sofa, Alexander's intoxicated facade dissolved the second the lock clicked.

Alexander blinked awake.

His fingertips brushed against his lips, still tasting the lingering sweetness of that stolen moment.

The phone buzzed beside him. A message from Lucas: [You home yet?]

Alexander typed back: [Yeah.]

Lucas replied instantly: [Answering so fast? You sure you’re not wasted?]

Alexander glanced toward the closed bedroom door.

A slow, satisfied smirk curved his lips as he typed: [Getting married tomorrow.]

Silence.

Then, Lucas’s response came, laced with disbelief: [Seriously? Did the government finally assign you a wife in your drunken delusions?]

Alexander’s reply dripped with smug amusement: [Close. My bride is currently tangled in my sheets.]

A full minute passed before Lucas’s next text: [Evelyn?]

Alexander: [Obviously.]

Lucas: [What the hell were you two doing in there?]

Lucas replied: [A man and a woman alone at night, both tipsy—what do you imagine happened? Should I even spell it out for you?]

Alexander could tell Lucas was being deliberately provocative, saying little but implying everything.

Lucas texted again: [No hidden agenda, just reminding you to pick out a gift for my soon-to-be wife.]

Alexander was stunned.

He had known Lucas wouldn’t text him in the middle of the night without a purpose.

Now he understood—his friend had been angling for a wedding present all along.

Meanwhile, Evelyn shut her bedroom door behind her, her pulse racing uncontrollably.

She collapsed onto her bed, drawing slow, deep breaths, willing her heartbeat to steady.

Who could have predicted her first kiss would be with a man she barely knew?

Stranger still, she was set to marry him tomorrow, yet she wasn’t even certain of his full name.

Evelyn had never experienced such emotions with anyone except Ethan Caldwell—let alone shared such intimacy.

The truth was, her reason for this impulsive marriage wasn’t just—

The weight of exhaustion pressed down on Evelyn like a lead blanket.

She had been through too much—betrayal, heartbreak, the ugliest sides of human nature. Now, all she wanted was stability. A home. Someone to share her life with.

Ethan Caldwell was in the past. She had made her choice. If she was going to marry Alexander, she would commit fully, leaving no room for lingering doubts.

But was this moving too fast?

Their first night together, and they had already kissed?

Heat rushed to her cheeks as the memory replayed in her mind. The way his lips had brushed against hers, tentative yet certain. The way his fingers had tangled in her hair, pulling her closer—

Evelyn buried her face in her pillow, kicking her legs beneath the sheets.

Stop. Thinking. About. It.

She slapped her own cheeks lightly, willing the images away.

Sleep came in restless waves, and when she finally opened her eyes again, sunlight streamed through the curtains.

After washing up, she lingered by the door, twisting her fingers together. Should she go out? Face him?

Then—a knock.

Sharp. Precise.

Her breath hitched.

Alexander.

The silence of my bedroom pressed against me like a suffocating weight.

Moonlight streamed through the half-drawn curtains, casting silver streaks across the duvet. I traced the patterns absently, my thoughts tangled in knots.

Alexander had left hours ago, his parting words still echoing in my mind.

I rolled onto my side, clutching a pillow to my chest. The scent of his cologne lingered faintly on the fabric, a cruel reminder of his absence.

Downstairs, the grandfather clock chimed twice. Two AM.

Sleep remained elusive.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand. A message from Vanessa—another thinly veiled jab disguised as concern. I tossed it aside without replying.

The ceiling fan whirred softly, doing little to dispel the summer heat.

I closed my eyes, but memories flashed behind my lids—Alexander’s smile, the way his fingers had brushed mine at dinner, the unspoken tension between us.

A car engine purred outside. My pulse spiked.

But it passed by, taillights fading into the darkness.

I exhaled sharply.

The house creaked, settling into its foundations. Somewhere, a faucet dripped.

I sat up abruptly, frustration boiling over.

This was ridiculous.

I grabbed my robe and padded to the window, pushing it open. Cool air rushed in, carrying the faint scent of roses from the garden below.

The estate grounds stretched before me, bathed in moonlight. Peaceful. Deceptive.

A shadow moved near the gazebo.

I froze.

Then it was gone—just a trick of the light, perhaps.

But my skin prickled.

Something was coming. I could feel it in my bones.

And when it arrived, nothing would ever be the same.
###Chapter 31 Same Last Name

The silence was shattered by Alexander's rich baritone. "Evelyn, are you awake?"

She hesitated for just a moment, steadying herself before moving to open the door.

When she did, she found herself face-to-face with the striking man standing in the hallway.

Alexander was impeccably dressed in a crisp white shirt and tailored black trousers, the silk bowtie at his throat lending him an air of sophistication that made her breath catch.

He looked like he had walked straight off the cover of a high-end fashion magazine.

Their eyes met, and Alexander swallowed hard, his gaze lingering on Evelyn's crimson-stained lips. "Breakfast is ready," he murmured.

Evelyn quickly averted her eyes, her thoughts racing. He seems completely unaffected.

Does that mean he doesn’t remember… last night?

Then again, how many people actually recall their drunken mistakes?

The tension between them was thick, unspoken words hanging in the air like an invisible barrier.

She followed him down the hall, her pulse quickening with every step.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries filled the grand dining room, but Evelyn barely registered it.

Her mind was still replaying the memory of his lips on hers—soft, insistent, intoxicating.

Had it really meant nothing to him?

Alexander pulled out a chair for her, his movements smooth and practiced.

She sat, careful to keep her expression neutral.

He took the seat across from her, his piercing gaze never leaving her face.

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken questions.

Evelyn picked up her fork, forcing herself to focus on the food rather than the man watching her with unnerving intensity.

But the moment she took a bite, she realized—

She wasn’t hungry at all.

A quiet sense of comfort settled over Evelyn as she trailed behind Alexander into the dining room.

The breakfast spread before them was modest—just a plate of pasta with scrambled eggs—yet the effortless grace with which he ate made it feel like something far more refined.

There’s no staff here, she realized. He must have cooked this himself.

A flicker of guilt pricked at her.

Here she was, sleeping under his roof, waking up later than him, and now he was serving her breakfast. It felt… presumptuous.

"Um…" Evelyn hesitated, lifting her gaze to meet his. "From now on, I'll handle breakfast."

At her words, Alexander set down his fork as if he’d been expecting this exact moment.

"That’s not how things work in our home."

Our home.

Her breath caught.

Those two words sent warmth curling through her chest, soft and unexpected, like sunlight breaking through morning mist.

The thought flickered through her mind like a candle in the wind—Could this truly become my home?


"Eat," Alexander commanded, sliding the plate of rosemary-glazed meatballs toward her. His gesture was effortless, yet carried an undercurrent of authority. "You're practically disappearing before my eyes."

Evelyn pressed her lips together and nodded, still reeling from the surreal turn of events.

At 5'6", her frame was alarmingly slight—barely tipping the scales at a hundred pounds.

When the meal ended, she automatically reached to gather the dishes, but Alexander's fingers closed around her wrist, warm and firm.

"Leave it." His voice was low, amused. "The staff handles that."

"Then what should I do?"

His thumb brushed her protruding wristbone. "Survive long enough to outgrow these birdlike proportions."

Then it hit her—a realization sharp enough to make her breath catch.

"Wait." She swallowed. "I don't even know your full name."

Alexander stilled. His hands, which had been fastening the final button of his charcoal overcoat, paused mid-motion. Slowly, he turned to face her fully.

Their eyes met, his strong fingers encircling her wrist with an intensity that suggested he might pull her into his arms.

Before Evelyn could react, their hands had somehow become intertwined, his touch sending waves of warmth through her.

Startled, she looked up—only to find a knowing smirk playing on his lips.

"Alexander Whitmore. Your husband."

The words hit her like a lightning strike.

Whitmore? The same surname as Ethan.

The name felt familiar, but she couldn’t place it. Just as she was scrambling to connect the dots, Alexander leaned in, his breath brushing against her skin, sending an unexpected thrill down her spine.

"You don’t have to be so tense around me." His voice was low, teasing. "After all, we did kiss last night. Or have you forgotten already, Mrs. Whitmore?"

Evelyn stiffened as if electrified.

Her fingers tightened instinctively.

Wait… Does he actually remember what happened?

How could he act so nonchalant about this?

What an utterly perplexing man!

Evelyn's mind was still reeling as they drove toward City Hall.

Only when the crisp marriage certificate rested in her palms did reality finally sink in.

After what felt like an eternity, it hit her—she was now, legally, Mrs. Whitmore.

Yet, in the most bizarre twist, the groom wasn’t the Ethan Caldwell she had once envisioned, but a man she barely knew, bound to her only by a shared surname.

Alexander’s piercing gaze locked onto her, his eyes dark with unspoken intensity. "You're thinking about someone else."

His voice was low, edged with something dangerous.

Evelyn’s breath caught.

She hadn’t realized her distraction was so obvious.

But how could she explain?

That the name "Whitmore" now tied to hers should have belonged to another man entirely?

That the life she had imagined had been stolen, rewritten, and handed back to her in a way she never saw coming?

Alexander’s fingers brushed against hers, sending an unexpected jolt through her.

"You’re mine now," he murmured, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn swallowed hard.

She had signed the papers.

There was no going back.

And yet—

Why did it feel like she had just stepped into a game where she didn’t know the rules?
###Chapter 32 A Calculated Distance

A strange mixture of emotions swirled in Evelyn's chest, sharp and unexpected.

This wasn't about Ethan—no, it was about her, about the part of her that had foolishly held onto hope for far too long.

Alexander's fingers closed around hers, warm and possessive.

Before she could react, he slipped a diamond ring onto her finger.

The design was elegant, understated—perfectly suited to her taste.

As his grip tightened slightly, Evelyn felt her pulse stutter.

Then he raised his other hand, brushing two fingers lightly against the space between her brows.

His voice was low, intimate, when he murmured, "From now on, this belongs to me."

For a breathless moment, she almost nodded—until reality crashed back in.

Something wasn't right.

"We aren't this close," she said slowly, pulling back just enough to meet his gaze. "Are we?"

The thought crossed Evelyn's mind like a fleeting shadow. We're practically strangers who ended up married by chance. When did it become expected for me to consider him like this?

Alexander's lips curved into that infuriating smirk, his voice a low murmur against her ear. "Sharing a bed, kissing—if that doesn't make us familiar, then what does?"

The noise of the crowded street blurred into the background. Evelyn's pulse spiked, her fingers tightening reflexively.

She met his gaze, inhaling sharply. A flush crept up her neck, her ears burning.

After a moment of charged silence, they headed back to the apartment. Evelyn decided it was time to haul Alexander to the grocery store.

The place was pristine, almost sterile—like a staged home rather than one lived in. She needed to stock up on essentials, to make it feel less like a hotel and more like theirs.

Yet, the thought of tonight twisted her stomach with an unfamiliar tension.

Last night, Alexander had been drunk enough to pass out on the couch.

But tonight?

"We're married now... Shouldn't we be sharing the same bed?"

Evelyn's phone vibrated abruptly.

She looked down to see Claire's message: [Just touched down. Dinner tonight?]

Her teeth sank into her lower lip as her gaze flickered toward the master bedroom.

Alexander emerged, his towering frame commanding attention, freshly changed into a crisp navy suit.

Fingers flying, she replied: [Can't. Got married today.]

Claire's response was instantaneous: [EXCUSE ME?]

Evelyn exhaled sharply: [Long story.]

[You didn't actually marry some stranger, did you?] Claire fired back. [I know Ethan's trash, but don't jump into anything reckless!]

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line as Alexander strode toward the ensuite bathroom.

Her thumbs hovered over the screen before typing: [It's complicated. I—]

The bathroom door clicked shut.

She deleted the half-written message and started over: [Not what you think. It's Alexander Whitmore.]

Three blinking dots appeared immediately. Then disappeared. Then reappeared.

Finally, Claire's reply came through: [AS IN TITAN CAPITAL'S ALEXANDER WHITMORE?!]

Evelyn's pulse jumped as the bathroom faucet turned on.

[Yes.] she typed. [The merger required it.]

Another pause. Then: [Girl. We need cocktails. STAT.]

Evelyn glanced at the closed bathroom door, then at the untouched guest room across the hall.

Her fingers hesitated before sending one final message: [Bring tequila.]

The shower started running as Claire's reply lit up the screen: [Oh honey. I'm bringing the whole damn bar.]

Claire's message popped up instantly: [You're joking, right? This sounds like some cheesy historical drama! Proof or it didn't happen!]

Evelyn bit her lip, typing back: [No proof.]

The only evidence of their union was that hastily taken wedding photo, which Alexander had immediately locked in his private vault upon their return to Whitmore Manor.

Claire wouldn't let up: [At least tell me his name! Don't leave me hanging!]

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the screen as she began typing: [Alex...]

Suddenly, Alexander's sculpted face appeared inches from hers, his cologne wrapping around her like an invisible embrace.

"Who has you so engrossed?" His deep voice sent shivers down her spine.

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed as she shoved her phone between the couch cushions.

"Just Claire."

Alexander arched one perfect eyebrow but didn't press further.

The afternoon sun cast long shadows as they strolled through the boutique-lined streets.

Ethan Caldwell’s phone vibrated against the glass tabletop, the screen flashing with Evelyn Carter’s name.

A slow, knowing smirk curved his lips.

He had just concluded a press conference, publicly declaring his engagement to Vanessa Hart—effectively burying the hotel scandal beneath layers of carefully crafted PR.

"Evelyn calling now? Trying to claw her way back into my life?" Ethan mused, dark amusement threading through his thoughts. "Too late for that, darling."

He let it ring. Once. Twice. Three times.

On the fifth ring, he finally answered—only to be met with dead silence.

She had hung up.

The dial tone hummed mockingly in his ear. His smirk faltered, replaced by a frown.

"Since when does Evelyn hang up on me?"

Even when he ignored her calls, she’d let it ring until the sixth beep cut the line. Then, like clockwork, she’d redial after exactly thirty seconds.

His grip tightened around the phone.

Setting it back down, he waited.

The screen remained dark.

The seconds ticked by in agonizing silence.

Ethan Caldwell stared at his phone, his fingers tightening around the device.

Two full minutes had passed.

The screen remained stubbornly dark.

A sharp click of his tongue echoed in the empty room, his jaw tightening.

Irritation flared behind his eyes, hot and sudden.

So, Evelyn is playing games with me now?

His thumb hovered over the call button again, but he resisted.

If she wanted to ignore him, fine.

But this wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

The air between them had grown colder than he expected.

And Ethan hated losing control.

Especially to her.
###Chapter 33 My Wife

He smirked to himself. So this is her game—playing hard to get? Thinking I'll be intrigued enough to chase after her?

Clever move, I'll give her that.

Meanwhile, Evelyn remained completely oblivious that her phone had accidentally dialed Ethan while she was absorbed in shopping.

There was something almost otherworldly about her new husband, Alexander. He carried himself with an air of detachment, as if he existed on a different plane altogether.

To ground him a little, she decided to put him to work—handing him the shopping cart with a playful grin.

With practiced ease, Evelyn maneuvered through the home goods section, Alexander trailing silently behind her. To any passerby, they looked like the picture of domestic bliss—a couple perfectly in sync.

Then, the vibration of Alexander’s phone shattered the moment.

He hesitated, his gaze flickering toward where Evelyn had wandered off, before answering the call.

The noise from the other end of the line was deafening.

Lucas Bennett's booming laughter cut through the chaos. "Alexander! Didn't you say today was the big day? The whole crew's here waiting—where's your bride?"

Alexander Whitmore's expression darkened, his gaze drifting back to Evelyn Carter, who was stretching on her tiptoes, trying to grab a large bottle of detergent from the top shelf.

The shelf was just out of reach, and she wobbled slightly, her long chestnut hair swaying with the movement.

Phone pressed to his ear, Alexander answered in a low voice, "Too many people. I don’t want to overwhelm her. We’re not coming."

Lucas snorted. "Oh, come on! We don’t bite. You’re acting like she’s some fragile treasure. This is your celebration—you can’t just skip it!"

Alexander remained silent, pushing the shopping cart toward Evelyn.

With effortless ease, he reached up and plucked the detergent from the shelf, dropping it into the cart.

Evelyn turned, surprise flickering across her face before melting into a warm smile.

Alexander smirked back, saying nothing as he guided the cart forward.

The butcher's display case gleamed under the fluorescent lights.

Alexander selected two prime ribeyes and dropped them into the cart with a satisfied thud.

Meanwhile, Lucas's voice crackled through the phone again. "Alex, are you even paying attention? Where the hell are you? It sounds like a zoo over there!"

Alexander rolled his shoulders, his tone nonchalant. "Just running errands with my wife. Have your fun—put everything on my tab."

A stunned silence stretched on the other end before Lucas burst into disbelieving laughter. "You? Grocery shopping? Since when?"

Annoyed by the interrogation, Alexander ended the call without another word.

Evelyn's cheeks warmed at the way he'd said "with my wife."

Who was that? One of his friends?

"Want some soup?" Alexander's question snapped her out of her thoughts.

"What?" She blinked up at him.

"Supposed to be good for women," he said, resting an elbow on the cart as a store clerk handed him a packaged bundle.

The casual way he leaned, the effortless confidence—it made her pulse skip.

She swallowed. "Sure."

He tossed it in without another word, but the corner of his mouth twitched.

Evelyn bit her lip.

This man—her husband—was full of surprises.

Evelyn's delicate brows knitted together. "But isn't preparing chicken quite time-consuming?"

Alexander's intense gaze settled on her.

His eyes lingered a heartbeat too long on the graceful curve of her waist.

A rare softness colored his voice. "If it helps you put on some healthy weight, then every minute is worth it."

Evelyn felt her pulse stutter at his words. When she glanced down at her slender frame, heat rushed to her cheeks.

Alexander's low chuckle vibrated through the space between them. "Let's finish here and go home."

The deep timbre of his voice sent delicious tremors down her spine.

Her thoughts raced. But we're husband and wife now… Surely sharing a bed is inevitable?

After their intimate dinner, Alexander guided her with mysterious purpose to their penthouse balcony.

Perched atop the city, their Willowbrook Apartments offered a private oasis—lush greenery and vibrant blossoms framing the glittering skyline.

The moment Evelyn stepped outside, the night exploded in color.

Fireworks burst across the heavens, painting the darkness with cascading gold and ruby light.

The night sky erupted in a dazzling display of colors, painting the darkness with vibrant hues.

Evelyn gasped, her head tilting upward as the fireworks illuminated her awestruck face. The golden sparks reflected in her wide, shimmering eyes.

Did he arrange this? The thought flickered through her mind, her pulse quickening.

Before she could dwell on it, strong arms encircled her waist from behind.

Alexander pulled her flush against his chest, his warmth seeping into her. His breath brushed against her ear as he murmured, "Happy anniversary, my love."

Her heart stuttered.

She hadn't even realized the date.

Yet he remembered.

The fireworks continued to burst overhead, their brilliance mirrored in the way he looked at her—like she was the only woman in the world.

Evelyn turned in his embrace, her fingers curling into the fabric of his shirt.

Alexander's gaze darkened, his thumb tracing her lower lip.

The world around them faded—the cheers of distant spectators, the crackling explosions above—none of it mattered.

Only this.

Only him.

His mouth claimed hers in a kiss that stole her breath, fierce and possessive.

And in that moment, Evelyn knew—no matter what storms came their way, she would always be his.

###Chapter 34 Next Time

She was so delicate that his fingers could nearly span her waist with ease.

This fragile frame wouldn't last long under his relentless teasing.

Alexander’s warm breath ghosted over the nape of Evelyn’s neck, sending an electric shiver down her spine.

Her pulse stuttered, unprepared for the sudden onslaught of sensation. His voice, rough and low, curled around her ear, blending with the heady musk of his cologne and the faint sweetness of jasmine drifting in from the balcony.

Evelyn’s head spun—whether from the half-finished glass of red wine at dinner or the way his lips shaped words that coiled around her like silk, she couldn’t tell.

"Evelyn," he murmured, the words a velvet caress. "Happy marriage."

Her lashes fluttered. Heat bloomed across her cheeks as the memory of their kiss from the night before surged forward, unbidden and intoxicating.

They had been this close before, too.

Her fingers curled instinctively as she moistened her lips.

"Mr. Whitmore," she murmured, her voice soft but steady. "Same to you."

Her pulse thrummed in time with the fireworks exploding overhead, each burst painting the sky in brilliant hues.

From behind, Alexander’s fingers slid between hers, locking them together.

This embrace was different—heady, intoxicating, dangerous.

Evelyn could feel the steady rhythm of his breathing against her back, his warmth seeping into her skin like sunlight.

"Mr. Whitmore?" Alexander repeated, a note of displeasure threading through his voice.

She turned slightly, meeting his gaze. The intensity in his eyes made her breath hitch.

"Then… Alexander," she corrected.

A slow, satisfied smile curved his lips.

His throat worked as he swallowed, his hand gliding over her shoulder to turn her fully toward him.

"I’d rather you call me something else," he murmured, his voice a low, teasing rumble.

Her heart stuttered.

"Like what?" she dared to ask.

His fingers brushed her jaw, tilting her face up.

"Like 'husband,'" he said, the word a velvet caress.

The night air crackled between them.

She could barely think.

But she knew one thing—this moment was theirs.

And she wasn’t pulling away.

Alexander's words sent Evelyn's cheeks flaming. She caught her lower lip between her teeth, her lashes fluttering downward in sudden shyness.

The sight of her flustered state only deepened the amusement in Alexander's eyes.

The delicate fragrance of wine still lingered around her, intoxicating him further. His fingers brushed against the nape of her neck, tilting her chin up until her gaze met his.

He leaned in, the space between them vanishing—until his phone shattered the moment with its sharp, insistent ring.

A frown darkened his expression as he answered.

Evelyn exhaled, unaware she had been holding her breath. He was going to kiss me.

Her pulse still raced as she squeezed her eyes shut.

Alexander, phone pressed to his ear, seemed engrossed in urgent business. Without another word, he strode into the study, leaving her alone on the balcony.

After a long, cool shower, Evelyn stepped out, wrapping a towel around herself. The bedroom was empty—Alexander hadn’t returned.

Sinking onto the bed, her thoughts drifted back to the conversation she’d had with Claire earlier that day.

Evelyn snatched her phone and dialed Claire's number, but a deep male voice answered instead.

Her fingers tightened around the device. "Who is this? Where's Claire?" she demanded, confusion knitting her brows.

She knew Lucas' voice well—this wasn't him.

Loud music thrummed in the background, laughter and clinking glasses drowning out clarity.

Is Claire at a bar?

The bartender's voice cut through the noise, professional yet concerned. "Ma'am, are you a friend of this woman? She's had a few too many. Someone needs to take her home."

Evelyn's pulse spiked. She yanked a jacket over her shoulders. "Give me the address. Now."

The moment she hung up, she bolted for the door—then froze.

Alexander.

He was still in his study.

She hesitated, torn between urgency and explanation.

The door creaked open behind her. Alexander stood there, his sharp gaze sweeping over her rushed appearance. "Evelyn," he said, voice low. "What's happening?"

The dim lighting of Eclipse Lounge cast long shadows across the polished floor as Evelyn Carter adjusted her silk shawl.

"My best friend's had too much to drink. I need to go get her," she explained, fingers tightening around her clutch.

Alexander Whitmore studied her with those piercing gray eyes, his expression unreadable. "A man?"

"Of course not!" Evelyn huffed, cheeks flushing. "It's Claire. Claire Dawson."

The moment the words left her lips, guilt twisted in her stomach.

Our wedding night. And I'm sneaking out like a thief.

She swallowed hard, pulse racing as she met his gaze. The warmth of his hand still lingered on her waist from their first dance.

With a shaky breath, she stepped back, the satin of her gown whispering against the marble. "Let's... save the rest for next time."

Before he could respond, she turned on her heel and fled, the train of her dress fluttering behind her like a startled dove.

She didn't dare look back.

But Alexander heard. Every syllable. Every hitch in her breath.

Leaning against the grand piano, he watched his bride disappear through the gilded doors, a slow smile curving his lips.

The game had just become infinitely more interesting.

His fingers tightened around the whiskey glass as the realization struck him.

"From her words... she was actually anticipating that moment?"

The ice cubes clinked softly as Alexander set down his drink, his mind replaying Evelyn's flushed cheeks and the way her breath had hitched when he'd leaned in.

He'd assumed her hesitation meant reluctance.

But what if it had been something else entirely?

The memory of her parted lips sent heat coiling through him. That barely-there whisper of his name. The way her fingers had trembled against his chest before curling into his shirt.

Not pushing away.

Pulling closer.

A slow smirk curved his mouth as he reached for his phone. The screen illuminated his sharp features in the dim study.

This changed everything.

Next time, he wouldn't stop at almost.

Next time, he'd claim what she'd so clearly offered.

The whiskey burned his throat as he drained the glass, already imagining the ways he'd make her say his name without restraint.

###Chapter 35 Unexpected Meeting

Evelyn Carter slid into the backseat of a taxi, her pulse quickening with worry for Claire.

The Eclipse Lounge was nothing like the rowdy clubs downtown. Jazz melodies drifted through the space, wrapping the room in a sophisticated calm.

Claire Dawson was still slightly drunk, her cheeks flushed as she propped her chin on her palms.

"What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be with Alexander right now?" Claire squinted at Evelyn, her words slightly slurred.

"Alexander can wait. You're more important," Evelyn replied without hesitation.

She had rushed inside, the warmth of the lounge instantly chasing away the evening chill. Without thinking, she shrugged off her coat.

Beneath it, she wore a fitted crimson dress that hugged her waist before flaring slightly at the hips. Though slender, the cut accentuated her curves perfectly.

Her legs, crossed at the barstool, peeked through the daring slit that ran high on her thigh. The sleek ankle boots she wore only drew more attention to them.

The soft glow of the Eclipse Lounge masked the faint scars on Evelyn's feet, giving her an air of effortless elegance in the dim lighting.

Claire's expression twisted with guilt as she slumped onto the barstool. "God, I'm the worst friend alive. I totally ruined your anniversary night, didn't I?"

Evelyn ignored the teasing remark, her gaze zeroing in on the faint puffiness around Claire's eyes. "Let me guess—another argument with Lucas?"

Claire and Lucas had entered into a marriage of convenience two years ago.

Yet those two years had been defined more by distance than togetherness.

For twelve long months, Claire had been overseas, recovering from a career-threatening dance injury. Meanwhile, Lucas had been buried in his postgraduate studies abroad.

Their schedules never aligned—whenever Claire returned, Lucas was gone, and when Lucas came back, Claire was already on another international tour.

In the end, their marriage had become little more than a series of brief reunions and prolonged separations.

Claire gave a humorless laugh, swirling her cocktail. "How can you fight with someone you only see in passing?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond when a sharp voice sliced through the murmur of the lounge—

The girl spun around, her breath catching in her throat.

"Evelyn!?"

Ethan stood before her, a smirk playing on his lips as he swirled the amber liquid in his glass. His chin lifted with that familiar arrogance, his gaze sharp and mocking.

"Following me now? Regretting your little tantrum?" His voice dripped with condescension. "Too late for second thoughts."

Claire shot up from her seat, swaying slightly from the cocktails but determined as she stepped between them.

"Ethan, back off. You don’t get to corner women in public like some entitled brat."

He barely spared her a glance, unimpressed by her slurred defiance.

"Save the act. I’m not here for drunk theatrics." His attention locked onto Evelyn, cold and calculating.

Evelyn arched a brow, feigning confusion. "Who exactly are you accusing?"

His laugh was low, derisive. "Still pretending? Wasn’t it you who called me earlier? What—upset I didn’t answer?"

The air between them crackled with tension.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her clutch.

Claire bristled, but Evelyn placed a steadying hand on her arm.

Ethan’s smirk deepened. "Cat got your tongue?"

She met his gaze, unflinching. "You’re delusional if you think I’d chase after you."

His eyes darkened. "We’ll see how long that pride lasts."

Before he could retaliate, a familiar voice cut through the noise.

"Evelyn."

Alexander materialized beside her, his presence like a shield. His icy glare locked onto Ethan. "Problem here?"

Ethan’s jaw twitched. "Just catching up."

Alexander’s arm slid around Evelyn’s waist, possessive. "Then you’re done."

The unspoken threat lingered.

Ethan’s lips curled, but he stepped back, raising his glass in mock salute. "Until next time."

As he melted into the crowd, Claire exhaled. "That man is a walking red flag."

Evelyn’s pulse still raced, but Alexander’s grip grounded her.

His voice was a murmur against her ear. "You okay?"

She nodded, but the encounter left a chill.

Ethan wasn’t done.

And neither was she.

"So now you're begging for my attention?"

Ethan's voice was laced with venom.

The murmurs of the surrounding crowd only fueled the tension.

News of the feud between the Caldwell and Carter families had spread like wildfire.

Everyone wanted a front-row seat to the drama—especially knowing Evelyn's past feelings for Ethan and his sudden engagement to her stepsister.

Evelyn tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, lifting her chin in defiance.

When her eyes met Ethan's again, they were glacial, stripped of any lingering warmth.

"Ethan, what makes you think I'd waste my time chasing after you? Do you really believe you're that important?"

Ethan frowned, taken aback. He wasn't used to this version of her—cold, indifferent, unreadable.

"What are you playing at, Evelyn?" His gaze sharpened, searching for cracks in her composure.

The air was thick with tension as Vanessa Hart stepped into the dimly lit corridor of Eclipse Lounge. Her crimson nails tapped impatiently against her champagne flute, her gaze sharp as a blade.

She had been avoiding this moment.

But fate had other plans.

Across the room, Alexander Whitmore stood with his usual effortless elegance, his dark suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His piercing blue eyes locked onto hers, and for a split second, the world around them faded.

Vanessa’s lips curled into a smirk. "Fancy seeing you here, Alex."

His expression remained unreadable. "Vanessa."

The way he said her name—cold, detached—sent a shiver down her spine. She hated how he could still affect her.

She took a deliberate step closer, the scent of her perfume mingling with the faint aroma of whiskey on his breath. "Still pretending you don’t remember what we had?"

His jaw tightened. "We had nothing."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "Liar."

Before she could continue, a familiar voice cut through the tension. "Vanessa, there you are."

Ethan Caldwell appeared beside her, his arm possessively sliding around her waist. His smirk was just as infuriating as ever.

Alexander’s gaze flickered between them, something dark flashing in his eyes.

Vanessa tilted her head, relishing the moment. "Oh, don’t look so surprised, Alex. People move on."

His voice was dangerously low. "Some faster than others."

Ethan’s grip tightened. "Problem, Whitmore?"

The air crackled with unspoken threats.

Then, just as suddenly as it had begun, Alexander turned away. "None at all."

Vanessa watched him disappear into the crowd, her heart pounding.

This wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.
###Chapter 36 The Cast-Off

Ethan Caldwell's face twisted into a scowl at Evelyn Carter's words, his eyes darkening like gathering storm clouds.

With just a few sharp sentences, she had exposed his affair with Vanessa Hart—each word striking him like a stinging slap.

In the past, Evelyn had always been the silent one, swallowing her pride and never daring to challenge him publicly.

But tonight? She was unrecognizable.

A bitter chuckle escaped Ethan's lips as he sneered. "Oh, I see now. This is about my engagement announcement with Vanessa, isn't it? You're shaken up. Who knew you still cared so much, Evelyn?"

"Cared about you?" Evelyn scoffed, her voice laced with icy amusement. "That might be the most delusional thing you've ever said."

Ethan faltered, momentarily stunned by her boldness.

"Let me refresh your memory, Ethan," Evelyn continued, her tone razor-sharp. "I was the one who ended things. I called off the engagement. Vanessa is just picking through my leftovers."

The words hung in the air like a challenge, daring him to deny it.

Ethan's jaw tightened, his earlier arrogance crumbling under the weight of her defiance.

For the first time, he realized—she wasn't the same woman he had once taken for granted.

And that terrified him.

The words cut through the air like a knife. "Picking up the scraps, treating unwanted men like treasures she found in a thrift store."

"Evelyn! Have you lost your mind?" Ethan's voice was a dangerous blend of shock and barely contained rage.

His face cycled through shades of pale and crimson, his chest rising and falling with each labored breath.

Whispers erupted around them, some laced with stifled laughter. Ethan's jaw tightened, his fingers curling into fists at his sides.

As a prominent heir in Cresthaven, he had never been humiliated like this—especially not by a woman.

Evelyn was the first to defy him so boldly.

His next words were laced with venom. "If you get on your knees and beg for forgiveness now, I might let this go."

"Forgiveness for what? I spoke nothing but the truth!" Evelyn shot back, her chin lifted in defiance.

Ethan's temples pulsed with fury.

"So you think I won't retaliate?"

His voice dropped to a lethal whisper.

"Or is this all just another pathetic attempt to get my attention?"

"Enough! You're coming with me!" Ethan's voice cut through the noise like a blade.

He couldn't stand the thought of spectators watching this humiliation unfold.

Before Evelyn could protest, his fingers clamped around her wrist, pulling her forward with rough urgency.

Claire, swaying slightly from the alcohol, lunged forward to stop him—only to freeze under the sheer force of Ethan's glare.

The impact of his presence was suffocating.

Her balance faltered, and she stumbled backward, hitting the floor with a sharp cry.

Evelyn immediately dropped to her knees to help, but Ethan wasn't having it.

With a furious jerk, he hauled her back up, forcing her away from Claire.

Evelyn was no match for his strength—her slender frame nearly lifted off the ground as he dragged her.

Then, without warning, she twisted and sank her teeth into his forearm.

Hard.

A hiss escaped Ethan as pain flared through his arm.

He released her instantly.

The bite mark stood out starkly against his skin, beads of blood welling up from the deep indents.

In the dim, pulsing lights of Eclipse Lounge, Evelyn stood frozen.

Her crimson dress shimmered under the neon glow, but her expression was anything but vibrant.

Evelyn's expression turned glacial, colder than the winter winds howling outside.

A sardonic smile played on her lips as she wiped the crimson stain from her mouth with her thumb.

"Ethan," she said, her voice dripping with disdain, "why don't you take a good, long look and see who's really desperate here?"

His gaze dropped to her left hand, where a brilliant diamond ring caught the light, sending a sharp, blinding glare straight into his eyes.

The sight made his pulse spike—anger and disbelief twisting inside him like a knife.

Evelyn followed his stare, glancing down at the sparkling jewel adorning her finger.

The diamond was exquisite, its facets refracting light so fiercely it nearly burned his retinas.

"Oh, did I forget to mention?" she said, tilting her hand so the ring shimmered mockingly. "I'm married now. So, unless you want a lawsuit for harassment, I suggest you back off."

Ethan froze, his mind reeling.

Married?

Impossible.

She couldn’t have moved on that fast.

She loves me.

She’s always loved me.

There’s no way she could replace me.

His jaw clenched, but Evelyn only smirked, turning away with the confidence of a woman who had already won.

"Do you honestly believe a counterfeit ring could fool me into thinking you're married? Is this some childish game to you?"

The murmurs around them intensified, drawing curious glances from every direction.

The diamond's brilliance was so intense that Ethan Caldwell had to look away.

Evelyn Carter's voice was ice. "Believe what you want, but I am married. Touch me again, Ethan, and you'll regret it."

His jaw clenched. "You've crossed a line."

Without warning, he seized her wrist and dragged her toward the exit.

Evelyn staggered, nearly colliding with him, but at the last second, her fingers closed around a half-empty wine bottle from a nearby table.

###Chapter 37 Reckoning

The bottle shattered against the table's edge with a deafening crack, red liquid splattering like blood across the floor.

Evelyn gripped the jagged neck of the broken glass, her knuckles white as she swung it toward Ethan's outstretched hand.

"Get your filthy hands off me!"

Ethan froze, his expression twisting between disbelief and fury. "Filthy?"

"Did I stutter?" Her voice trembled with seven years of pent-up rage. "I was loyal to you—obsessed—until you betrayed me with Vanessa and sent me to rot in prison. That was the day you lost me forever."

Shards glittered on the ground, mingling with droplets of crimson.

She didn’t care whose blood it was.

The realization hit me like a storm.

"How could I have ever loved you?" My voice was ice, sharper than the broken glass at our feet. "What’s wrong, Ethan? Can’t handle hearing the truth?"

A cruel smirk curled my lips as I raised the jagged bottle again, my grip tightening. His hand was still within reach.

"Congratulations, Ethan! You finally get to marry Vanessa!"

My laugh was bitter, hollow. "And yet here you are, clinging to my hand. Shouldn’t you be worried your precious Vanessa might see?"

With one final, brutal swing, I brought the bottle down.

The glass shattered completely, scattering like diamonds across the floor.

I tossed the broken neck aside, my gaze flickering to the blood seeping from Ethan’s arm.

It should have made me hesitate.

It didn’t.

Just then, Claire rushed forward, her face pale with panic as she grabbed my wrists, checking for injuries.

My skin was streaked with crimson, stark against the porcelain paleness of my arms. The chaos around us only heightened the tension.

But after a quick inspection, Claire exhaled sharply—no wounds on me.

Relief flickered in her eyes—until a new sound cut through the air.

The wail of police sirens shattered the night as officers stormed into Eclipse Lounge.

Someone had tipped them off discreetly.

Ethan Caldwell's affluent friends rushed to his side, their voices laced with panic. "Mr. Caldwell! Are you hurt?"

No one had anticipated the situation would spiral this far.

Ethan remained silent, his face drained of color.

Evelyn Carter's strike had left a deep gash on his arm, crimson staining his sleeve.

One of his friends barked, "The ambulance is outside! Let's get you to the hospital!"

Ethan gave a stiff nod, his gaze lingering on Evelyn with an unreadable expression before he was ushered away.

Evelyn didn't react, her eyes fixed straight ahead, too repulsed to grant him another glance.

At the precinct, Evelyn sat in the interrogation room, her clothes smeared with blood.

Her face was ghostly pale, her slender frame curled inward, silence wrapping around her like a suffocating shroud.

Beside her, Claire Dawson's expression was tight with worry. "Evelyn, are you—"

The door creaked open, cutting her off.

A detective stepped in, his tone clipped. "Miss Carter, we need your statement."

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her fingers trembling slightly before she clenched them into fists.

She wasn't afraid.

She was furious.

And she wasn't backing down.

The night air bit into Evelyn's bare arms as she rushed toward the police station. She'd moved so fast that she'd forgotten her coat, leaving her shivering in just a thin tank dress.

Claire, keeping pace beside her, shot her a worried glance. "You're freezing," she murmured.

Evelyn forced a smile. "I'm fine. Just a little cold."

Claire's eyes widened. She was only in a light blouse herself—if she'd had a jacket, she would have given it to Evelyn in a heartbeat.

"You were incredible back there," Claire said, her voice tinged with awe. "The way you hit Ethan—I've never seen anything like it. He looked like he'd seen a ghost when he left."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She hadn't meant for things to escalate like that.

She hadn't expected Ethan to keep coming at her even after she smashed the bottle.

A bitter thought crossed her mind: What is he playing at now?

Back when she used to trail after him like a lovesick fool, he'd barely spared her a glance. She had been invisible to him.

And yet, just yesterday, he'd held a press conference announcing—

Vanessa Hart as his fiancée.

"We're over—why is he still lurking around?"

The officers approached, their expressions unreadable. "Ms. Hart," one said, "we've reviewed the security footage. It's clear you acted in self-defense, so no charges will be pressed. However, bail must still be posted."

Claire Dawson immediately stepped forward. "Can I do it?"

The officer shook his head. "Only a family member can handle that."

Claire clenched her fists, frustration flashing in her eyes.

Evelyn Carter exhaled sharply.

This wasn't over.
###Chapter 38 Who Is He?

Claire checked the time on her phone—2:47 AM.

Her parents would be deep in sleep by now. The last thing she wanted was to drag them out of bed over something like this.

After a tense moment of hesitation, she dialed Lucas.

The line rang four times before he answered. The background was a cacophony of loud chatter, clinking glasses, and raucous laughter. A woman’s flirtatious giggle cut through the noise.

“Yeah?” His voice was indifferent, almost bored.

Claire didn’t bother with greetings. “I’m at the police station. Come get me.”

A beat of silence. Then Lucas let out a dry chuckle, his tone dripping with mockery.

“Trouble again, Claire? You never disappoint.”

The line went dead before she could retort.

She exhaled sharply, gripping the edge of the cold metal bench beneath her. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows across the sterile room.

A uniformed officer approached, clipboard in hand. “Ma’am, we need the name of the person you were with tonight.”

Claire stiffened.

She had no idea who he was.

The memory flashed—dark eyes, a sharp jawline, the way he’d pulled her out of harm’s path before everything spiraled. A stranger who’d vanished the second the cops arrived.

Her fingers curled into fists.

“I don’t know his name.”

The officer’s pen hovered over the paper. “Then how do you explain the blood on your sleeve?”

Claire’s breath hitched.

That wasn’t hers.

Her teeth sank into her lower lip as she felt his irritation radiating through the phone.

"What am I even doing calling him?" Claire thought, frustration simmering beneath her skin like carbonated bubbles in a shaken soda can.

She was just about to end the call when Lucas's voice cut through the silence once more. "Fine. I'll come get you. But first, you owe me."

Claire's fingers tightened around her phone until her knuckles turned white. "Owe you what?"

"Give me a child."

The words hit her like a physical blow, leaving her momentarily breathless.

"Excuse me? We're literally finalizing our divorce! Why in God's name would I have your baby now? Have you lost your damn mind?"

She could practically hear the smirk in his voice. He was toying with her, as always.

Their marriage had never been more than a corporate merger dressed in white lace - a transaction brokered by their families' intertwined business interests.

For seven hundred and thirty endless days, Claire had waited like a fool for even a flicker of genuine affection from the man who shared her bed but never her heart.

When she'd finally gathered the courage to file for divorce, Lucas had signed the papers without hesitation, proving what she'd always known - she'd never truly been his wife, just another business acquisition.

The arrangements were still being finalized when the realization hit her like a physical blow.

He wants me to have his child now?

The absurdity of it made her throat tighten.

Lucas Bennett had made his stance painfully clear—he wouldn’t be coming to the station.

His voice had been icy through the phone.

"Seriously, Claire? If we're ending this, why should I waste my time bailing you out?"

Before she could even form a response, the sharp beep of the disconnected call echoed in her ear.

Claire stared at her phone, fingers trembling.

The weight of his rejection settled heavily in her chest.

She blinked back the sting of tears before turning to Evelyn, forcing a brittle smile.

"Well, you heard him. Lucas isn’t lifting a finger."

Evelyn’s arm tightened around her shoulders, her expression darkening with protective fury.

"Then we’ll handle this ourselves," she said firmly. "I’ll call Alexander."

Claire exhaled shakily, gripping Evelyn’s hand.

"I’m so sorry to drag you into this."

Evelyn shook her head.

"Don’t apologize. We’re getting you out of here."

The fluorescent lights of the station buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows.

Claire swallowed hard.

She had never felt so alone—and yet, Evelyn’s unwavering support was the only lifeline she needed.

Evelyn chewed her bottom lip, hesitating. "Would Alexander even be awake at this hour?"

It was their wedding night, and here she was calling him to bail her out of jail.

How utterly ridiculous.

What kind of impression would this leave?

After a long pause, she finally dialed his number.

The call connected immediately, startling her.

His rich, velvety voice came through, laced with concern. "Where are you? I've been waiting."

Evelyn quickly explained the bar incident, carefully leaving out Ethan's name but mentioning an encounter with her ex-fiancé that had gotten out of hand.

Now she needed his help.

"Stay right there. I'm coming."

As she hung up, the roar of a powerful engine echoed outside the station.

The sound sent shivers down her spine.

She wasn't sure if it was from relief or apprehension.

Would he be angry? Disappointed?

The fluorescent lights of the police station buzzed overhead, making her headache worse.

Her hands trembled slightly as she clutched her phone.

This wasn't how she'd imagined their first night as husband and wife.

Not at all.

The heavy door creaked open.

Her breath caught in her throat.

There he stood, his tall frame silhouetted against the harsh station lighting.

Alexander Whitmore had arrived.

And the look in his piercing blue eyes was unreadable.

Waiting felt endless, so Evelyn and Claire struck up a conversation to distract themselves.

Evelyn gave a dry chuckle. "Well, this is certainly not how I imagined spending my wedding night. I’m shocked your husband isn’t furious. He sounded so collected on the phone."

Claire nodded. Alexander did seem eerily calm about the whole situation.

Curious, Evelyn tilted her head. "By the way, what’s his full name? I should at least greet him properly when we meet."

"Alexander Whitmore," Claire answered.

Evelyn’s brows shot up. "Wait—Whitmore? As in, the Whitmores?" She paused, then let out a disbelieving laugh. "Did you accidentally desecrate the Whitmore family crypt in a past life or something? Why do you keep crossing paths with people tied to that name?"

Then, realization struck. Evelyn’s eyes widened. "Hold on—did you just say your husband is Alexander Whitmore?"

###Chapter 39 Fortune's Favor

Evelyn nodded, her forehead creasing as she caught the stunned expression frozen on Claire's face. Claire's jaw had dropped so low it could've caught raindrops.

"What's wrong? Do you recognize him?" Evelyn asked, intrigue threading her voice.

Unsure if she was misunderstanding, Claire demanded, "What's his name? Show me!"

Remembering the name she'd seen on the marriage certificate earlier that day, Evelyn took Claire's hand and traced the letters onto her palm.

As each stroke formed, Claire turned to stone, her face a mask of utter shock.

Seconds stretched like hours before she finally snapped out of it, her voice a fragile whisper. "You… you seriously don’t know who Alexander Whitmore is?"

Evelyn shook her head, wide-eyed.

"All I know is his name and that he owns some company. Oh, and that he drinks like a fish at parties."

The breaking news alert on Evelyn's phone flashed: Hezbollah's attack on northern border... Netanyahu threatens Lebanon...

Before Evelyn could respond to Claire, the police station's doors burst open with a resounding crash.

A commanding presence filled the room as Alexander Whitmore strode in, his mere entrance hushing conversations and drawing every eye.

He moved with the confidence of a man who owned the world, his sharp gaze immediately locking onto Evelyn.

When he noticed the blood staining her sleeve, his jaw tightened. "You're injured?"

Evelyn shook her head quickly. "It's not mine."

The tension in Alexander's shoulders eased slightly, but concern still darkened his expression. The late-night chill clung to the air, and Evelyn—dressed too lightly—shivered, her face pale.

Without a word, Alexander shrugged off his tailored suit jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "Button it up," he ordered, his voice low but firm.

Guilt flickered in Evelyn's chest. "I'm sorry for making you come out so late..."

His fingers lingered near her collar, adjusting the jacket before he stepped back. "Don't apologize," he said, his tone softening just enough to reassure her.

The fluorescent lights overhead cast sharp shadows across his face, emphasizing the protective edge in his stance.

Evelyn pulled the jacket tighter, the residual warmth from his body seeping into her skin.

Across the room, Claire watched them with raised eyebrows, clearly reassessing the dynamics between them.

Alexander's attention, however, never wavered from Evelyn. "Tell me what happened."

She exhaled, steeling herself.

This night was far from over.

Alexander's brow furrowed. "We're husband and wife. There's no need for apologies between us."

Just then, an officer strode toward them. "You're here for their release? Follow me to complete the paperwork."

Alexander gave a curt nod, his piercing gaze suddenly locking onto Claire.

Their eyes met, and Claire's stomach knotted with unease. Should I acknowledge him?

It made sense that Evelyn wouldn't recognize Alexander after three years behind bars, but Claire had encountered him multiple times.

Given that Alexander and Lucas were practically inseparable, avoiding him completely had been impossible.

They'd even shared an awkward business dinner once.

Though their conversations had been brief, Alexander had a razor-sharp memory.

But Evelyn's husband? Alexander Whitmore?

The universe had to be playing some cruel joke.

As the officer shuffled documents at the counter, motioning for Alexander to—

Claire couldn't contain herself any longer.

"Alright, out with it. What's really going on between you and Alexander? How did this marriage even happen? Who proposed?"

Evelyn hesitated, the memory of that startling morning flashing through her mind. "I think... it was him."

Claire's expression shifted, her brows knitting together.

She thought, Evelyn suffered so much because of Ethan. Yet Alexander Whitmore—of all people—wants to marry her? That’s... unexpected.

But then, a slow, satisfied smile curled her lips.

Alexander’s position in the Whitmore family was unassailable. If Evelyn became his wife, she’d effectively become Ethan’s aunt.

The mental image of future family gatherings—Ethan and Vanessa forced to raise their glasses to Evelyn—sent a thrill through Claire.

Looping her arm through Evelyn’s, she grinned.

"Darling, you’ve just struck gold."

"Did you hear about Alexander and Ethan—"

Eleanor's words cut off abruptly as the precinct door burst open again.

The sudden noise made everyone turn. A gust of wind swept in, carrying the faint scent of rain.

Vanessa Hart stiffened beside me, her manicured nails digging into her palms.

I held my breath, waiting.

Then I saw him.

Alexander Whitmore stood framed in the doorway, his tailored suit rumpled, his usually perfect hair disheveled. His stormy gray eyes locked onto mine with terrifying intensity.

"Evelyn."

The way he said my name sent shivers down my spine. There was something different about him—something dangerous.

Simon Graves rushed in behind him, looking harried. "Sir, you shouldn't—"

Alexander ignored him, striding forward with single-minded purpose. The officers exchanged uneasy glances but didn't stop him.

Vanessa made a small, choked sound.

I barely noticed. My entire world had narrowed to the man advancing toward me, his expression unreadable.

Then he was right in front of me, close enough that I could see the faint shadow of stubble along his jaw.

His hand came up—

I flinched.

But he only brushed his knuckles lightly against my cheek. "You're hurt."

His voice was deceptively soft.

That's when I realized—the storm in his eyes wasn't directed at me.

It was for whoever had put that bruise on my face.

And judging by the way Vanessa had gone deathly pale, she knew exactly what that meant.

The room seemed to hold its breath.

Then Alexander turned to the nearest officer, his voice dropping to a lethal calm.

"Now. Let's talk about who dared to lay hands on my wife."
###Chapter 40 Two Couples

The door of the police station swung open again, and this time, the scent of whiskey clung heavily to the man who entered.

It was Lucas.

He must have rushed here straight from Eclipse Lounge. His gaze landed on Claire, and he turned to the nearest officer with a lazy smirk. "I'm here to post bail. Where do I sign?"

Before the officer could answer, Claire rose to her feet, her voice frosty. "That won't be necessary, Lucas. Someone else is already handling it. You can leave."

Lucas blinked, then chuckled, shaking his head. "Someone’s bailing you out, and yet you're still sitting here? Come on, Claire, we’re married. You begged for my help, and here I am. Why the attitude?"

The word begged stung like a slap. Claire felt her throat tighten, her composure threatening to shatter.

"I never begged for anything!" she snapped. "You can walk right back out that door if you want."

The tension between them crackled in the air. Sensing the storm brewing, Evelyn quickly—

The tension in the police station was suffocating.

Lucas Bennett clenched his jaw, his knuckles white from gripping the edge of the counter. His dark eyes burned with frustration as he glared at Claire Dawson, who stood trembling a few feet away.

Nathan Reeves stepped between them, his voice calm but firm. "Let's all just take a moment to breathe, okay?"

Lucas didn’t respond. Instead, he turned sharply and stormed out of the station, slamming the door behind him. Outside, he collapsed into the backseat of his car, pulling out a cigarette with shaking hands.

The driver glanced at him through the rearview mirror. "Mr. Bennett, should we go?"

Lucas exhaled a slow stream of smoke, rolling down the window to let the cold night air in. His gaze flickered back toward the station, where he could just make out Claire’s silhouette through the glass.

She was crying.

His chest tightened, but he forced himself to look away. "Not yet."

Inside, Evelyn Carter gently wiped the tears from Claire’s cheeks.

She didn’t need words to understand. Claire still loved Lucas. Why else would she break down the moment he walked in?

The silence between them was heavy.

Evelyn sighed, deciding to break it. "Claire, he came here as soon as he heard. That has to mean something."

Claire shook her head, her voice barely above a whisper. "It doesn’t matter. We’re getting a divorce."

"What’s the point of discussing this now?"

Lucas had already agreed to the divorce. All that remained was signing the papers.

But lately, he hadn’t stepped foot in their home.

Claire had searched every high-end club Lucas frequented, desperate to confront him.

Yet he was nowhere to be found.

The whole situation left her unsettled.

Evelyn couldn’t shake the nagging suspicion that there was more to this than met the eye. Somewhere beneath the surface, a misunderstanding festered between Claire and Lucas.

She exhaled softly, sympathy tightening her chest. "Maybe you should reconsider. If Lucas is avoiding you, it might mean he isn’t ready to let go. If you still care for him, shouldn’t you at least try talking?"

Claire remained silent, her gaze distant.

At that moment, Alexander emerged from the back office.

The three of them stepped outside together.

Lucas, having just crushed his cigarette underfoot, leaned lazily against his car with a mocking grin. "Well, well. Looks like someone did come to your rescue. But let’s be honest—Evelyn’s the one who actually saved you."

The tension in the air thickened.

Claire’s fingers curled into fists at her sides.

Alexander’s expression darkened, his protective instincts flaring.

Evelyn glanced between them, sensing the storm brewing.

Lucas pushed off the car, his smirk fading into something colder. "Funny how things work out, isn’t it?"

No one answered.

The silence stretched, heavy with unspoken words.

Then, with a scoff, Lucas turned and walked away.

Claire watched him go, her heart pounding.

Evelyn reached for her hand, squeezing gently.

Alexander’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing.

The evening sun cast long shadows across the pavement.

And just like that, the fragile peace shattered.

Evelyn was speechless.

Lucas strode to the backseat and yanked the door open, shooting her a challenging look. "Get in. Or are you planning to third-wheel us all night?"

Evelyn threw a glance at Alexander before responding icily, "Lucas, the only thing intimidating about you is that filthy mouth of yours."

Without hesitation, she slid into the car.

Lucas smirked, his voice dripping with mischief. "Just my mouth? You're welcome to test that theory anytime, Evelyn."

Her face burned with indignation. She glared at him. "You're insufferable!"

Lucas merely chuckled, settling into his seat as the engine roared to life. He gave Alexander a lazy wave before the car pulled away.

Outside the police station, only Alexander and Evelyn remained.

The crude joke had caught Evelyn off guard, leaving her flustered.

She lifted her gaze to Alexander, her cheeks still warm.

The night air was crisp as Alexander, ever composed, reached for Evelyn's trembling fingers. "You're ice cold," he murmured, his voice laced with quiet concern.

Without another word, he slipped her hand into the warmth of his coat pocket, his own fingers curling protectively around hers.

By the time they arrived home, Evelyn made a beeline for the bathroom, scrubbing furiously at the dark stains splattered across her sleeves. The water ran pink, then clear, but the memory clung like a shadow.

When she emerged, the clock read half past three.

A single amber lamp cast a soft glow across the bedroom. Alexander lounged against the headboard, the silk of his pajama top slipping open just enough to reveal the sharp line of his collarbone.

He didn’t press her about the blood. Didn’t ask what had happened at the Eclipse Lounge.

Instead, he simply lifted the duvet beside him in silent invitation. "Come here," he said, his voice low and steady.

###Chapter 41 Letting Go

Evelyn gave a small nod before slipping beneath the silken sheets, her body melting into the plush mattress.

The exhaustion must have claimed her completely—the instant her head touched the pillow, she was gone, lost in deep slumber.

Alexander, who had been leaning in closer, stilled abruptly.

His brows knitted together as his gaze flickered to the nightstand, where an unopened velvet box sat untouched. Then his eyes drifted back to Evelyn, her peaceful expression bathed in the dim glow of the bedside lamp.

A quiet sigh escaped him as he reluctantly lowered himself onto the bed beside her.

But Evelyn’s sleeping habits were far from innocent.

The moment her body instinctively curled toward his warmth, his muscles locked tight.

Her delicate scent—soft vanilla and something uniquely her—wrapped around him, sending his pulse into a frantic rhythm.

She was like a siren, utterly unaware of the storm she stirred within him.

A restless energy pulsed through Alexander.

Heat flooded his veins, and no amount of measured breathing could suppress the growing hunger inside him.

Desperate for relief, he snatched a cigarette and stepped onto the balcony, letting the cool night air wash over him. He took one drag after another, the ember glowing like a warning in the dark.

His phone buzzed shortly after a brief call. A video notification appeared.

It showed Evelyn striking Ethan at the Eclipse Lounge.

Alexander tapped play. The footage was sharp—every word, every movement captured in perfect clarity.

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Damn, Evelyn. That’s one hell of a hit. Seems like she’s really over him."

His earlier concerns about potential future encounters with Ethan now felt unnecessary.

"I worried for nothing."

By morning, news of Ethan’s hospital visit had spread like wildfire across Cresthaven. It was all anyone could talk about.

After all, this was the same Evelyn who had once chased after Ethan relentlessly—now she was the one who put him in the emergency room.

She was the one who slapped Ethan.

The media scandal had only made things worse, leaving the public buzzing with speculation.

Ethan’s betrayal with Vanessa was still fresh in everyone’s memory, and Evelyn’s explosive reaction seemed completely justified.

Yet, the aftermath suggested that the engagement between Ethan and Evelyn hadn’t truly ended—their families were merely trying to salvage their reputations after the headlines exposed Ethan getting too close to Vanessa.

Vanessa’s reputation was utterly ruined.

When Evelyn woke up, the other side of the bed was already empty.

She faintly remembered being held in strong arms all night, wrapped in warmth.

She had always been sensitive to the cold. Alexander, on the other hand, was like a living furnace, radiating heat that she couldn’t resist curling into.

Now, buried under the blankets, the memory made her cheeks burn.

She groaned inwardly. Did I really do that without—

The thought lingered in Evelyn's mind like an uninvited guest. Should I just crawl into bed with Alexander?

Her fingers twisted the edge of the blanket nervously.

What if he notices? What if he thinks I’m being too bold?

Then again, they were legally married now. Sharing a bed wasn’t exactly a crime.

A quiet exhale escaped her lips.

At least Alexander wasn’t here to witness her internal debate. Facing him right now would’ve been unbearable.

Just as she sank deeper into her thoughts, her phone vibrated sharply against the nightstand.

Richard Hayes.

Evelyn had nearly forgotten she even had a father.

She swiped to answer, bracing herself.

His voice crackled through the line, thick with irritation.

"Evelyn! What in the world possessed you to hit Ethan? Do you have any idea who the Caldwells are? You’re begging for trouble!"

Her grip on the phone tightened.

"He wouldn’t let go," she snapped. "If he got punched, he deserved it. I’m not like Vanessa, clinging to some guy I’m supposed to be over!"

Silence.

Richard clearly hadn’t expected that.

Evelyn had never spoken to him like this before—never dared.

The tension in the room was suffocating.

Evelyn could practically taste the bitterness in the air. Richard's words dripped with condescension, as if she were some petulant child throwing a tantrum.

"Listen, Evelyn," he said, his voice laced with impatience. "No matter how much this stings, Ethan and Vanessa's engagement is final. You need to accept that."

As if she cared about their sham of a relationship.

She let out a sharp laugh, refusing to dignify his assumptions with an explanation.

Richard's expression darkened, his tone turning icy. "You will go to the hospital and apologize to Ethan. Once he marries Vanessa, we can all move forward as a family. Don't make this messier than it already is."

The audacity.

Evelyn clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.

She wasn’t the one who needed to apologize.

But Richard wouldn’t understand. None of them ever did.

The weight of their expectations pressed down on her, but she refused to bend.

Not this time.

Not ever again.
###Chapter 42 The Unyielding Stand

Evelyn crossed her arms defiantly. "Why on earth should I apologize to Ethan? I did nothing wrong!"

Richard's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "You physically assaulted him, Evelyn! That's entirely on you. You owe him an apology!" His words were laced with exasperation, his patience clearly worn thin.

After everything she had endured, Evelyn had reached a breaking point. She realized that swallowing her pride and staying silent only emboldened those who sought to trample over her.

Her thoughts burned with resentment. All these years, I've sacrificed everything for the Hayes family. And what did it get me?

A prison sentence.

How utterly absurd.

I was never in the wrong. So why should I keep retreating? Why let them treat me like dirt?

If the Hayes family refuses to see reason, then I'm done playing the obedient daughter.

In their eyes, no matter how perfectly I behave, Vanessa will always be the golden child.

Her jaw set with determination. She wouldn't back down—not this time.

The morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as I crossed my arms defiantly. "You really think Ethan wants an apology from me? The man got knocked out by a woman—he's the joke of the entire social circle now. If I go groveling to him, it'll just rub salt in his wounded pride!"

Richard's face darkened. "Evelyn, enough with the excuses! Do I need to drag you there myself?"

I sank deeper into the couch cushions, my voice dripping with frost. "Fine. I'll apologize to Ethan—on one condition. Vanessa apologizes to me first."

His nostrils flared. "What kind of ridiculous demand is that?"

A bitter laugh escaped me. "Oh, so we're just pretending the press conference never happened? Vanessa slept with my fiancé, and you and Mom love playing the impartial judges, don’t you?" I tilted my head. "So tell me, does she owe me an apology or not?"

Richard opened his mouth, then snapped it shut, his face turning an interesting shade of red.

"And about last night," I continued smoothly, "even the police ruled it self-defense. If you disagree, why not call them and have me arrested again?"

Silence.

Richard could only gape at me, completely at a loss for words.

I smirked, twirling a strand of hair around my finger. "Thought so."

The tension in the room thickened, but I refused to back down. Not this time.

Let them try to force me. I wasn’t the same pushover they remembered.

Not anymore.

The call ended abruptly as his temper flared.

Within moments, Evelyn's phone buzzed again—Margaret calling back.

It was obvious. Margaret and Richard were tag-teaming her, one playing the enforcer, the other the sympathizer.

"Did you actually declare yourself married in front of everyone last night? You can't just drop bombshells like that! And where have you been hiding these past few days?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I am married. Why do you think I went back to Hawthorne Estate that morning? I needed my ID."

A stunned silence followed.

"I know what you're assuming. That I grabbed some stranger off the street. Well, you're right. He's broke, average-looking, and we've been squatting under a bridge. Want to visit?"

"Are you trying to give me a heart attack?" Margaret's voice trembled with shock.

"It's the truth, Mom! Ethan left me, so I stopped caring. Isn't this exactly what you and Dad expected?"

Margaret's face drained of color, fury tightening her features.

"You're absolutely insufferable!"

At that exact moment, Alexander Whitmore, who had just pulled up the home security feed to check if Evelyn Carter was awake yet, arched a brow in amusement.

Living under a bridge? He smirked. Now that's creative.

"Mr. Whitmore, the car is prepared. Shall we depart now?" Simon Graves rapped lightly on the study door.

Alexander shut his laptop with a decisive click. "How many of them have already descended upon the hospital?"

"Nearly the entire Whitmore clan, including Sir Whitmore himself. We're the last to arrive."

Ethan Caldwell had suffered minor bleeding the previous night, though his injuries weren't life-threatening.

After being examined, he'd opted to stay in the hospital's luxury suite—partly due to the late hour, and partly to avoid unnecessary complications.

The Whitmores, notorious for their theatrics, had turned the visit into a spectacle.

With the family gathered, Ethan couldn't exactly downplay his condition. So, he leaned into it, playing the role of the wounded heir to perfection.

The hospital corridors buzzed with hushed whispers and dramatic sighs.

Grace Caldwell dabbed at nonexistent tears while Harold Whitmore maintained his usual stern demeanor, though his gaze kept flickering toward the door—waiting.

Alexander arrived last, as expected.

His presence alone shifted the atmosphere, tension coiling tight in the air.

Ethan's jaw clenched when their eyes met.

No words were exchanged.

None were needed.

The game was far from over.

And Alexander?

He was just getting started.

The weekend getaway had been perfect.

Alexander arched a brow as he poured himself a drink. "What about Vanessa? She didn't join you?"

The ice cubes clinked against the crystal glass.

Evelyn curled her fingers around her teacup, the warmth seeping into her skin. "She claimed she had prior commitments."

A knowing smirk played on Alexander's lips. "How convenient."

The grandfather clock in the corner ticked loudly in the sudden silence.

Evelyn set her cup down with deliberate care. "I didn't press the matter. Honestly, I preferred the peace."

Alexander's gaze darkened as he swirled his whiskey. "After everything she's done, she owes you more than an apology."

Outside, the first drops of rain began pattering against the windows.

Evelyn traced the rim of her cup. "Some wounds don't heal with words."

The storm clouds mirrored the tension thickening between them.

Alexander drained his glass in one swift motion. "Then perhaps actions would suffice."

Lightning flashed, illuminating the determined set of his jaw.

Evelyn's breath caught. "What are you planning?"

Thunder rumbled as Alexander leaned forward, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Something long overdue."

The power flickered, plunging them into momentary darkness.

When the lights returned, Evelyn found Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto hers.

"Trust me," he murmured.

Her pulse quickened. After everything, she did.

Completely.

The storm raged on outside, but for the first time in months, Evelyn felt strangely at peace.

Whatever came next, they'd face it together.
###Chapter 43 The Hospital Visit

Simon shook his head. "She didn't come."

Alexander arched a brow, his voice dripping with implication. "With all the chaos at the hospital, and given that she's Ethan's fiancée, her absence would raise eyebrows!"

Especially since Eleanor, Ethan's mother, was also present.

Eleanor had never approved of Vanessa, deeming her unfit for her son.

Yet Ethan had publicly declared Vanessa as his fiancée right in front of the press.

It was a direct challenge to Eleanor's authority.

Ethan had never openly defied his mother before. This was the first time he had disregarded her wishes.

One could only imagine the fury simmering beneath Eleanor's composed exterior.

Now, the entire Caldwell family had gathered at the hospital—

Grace, Ethan's sister, stood stiffly by the window, her expression unreadable.

Harold, the family patriarch, sat in silence, his sharp gaze flickering between his son and his wife.

And then there was Vanessa, who had yet to show her face.

Alexander smirked.

This was going to be interesting.

The stage was set. Without Vanessa, this performance would be incomplete.

Alexander wanted Vanessa to understand that becoming part of the Whitmore family wasn’t some fairy-tale ending. Even if she clawed her way in, she’d only be stepping into her own personal nightmare.

After all, Evelyn had suffered three years of wrongful imprisonment because of Vanessa’s schemes.

Vanessa believed marrying into the Whitmore family would grant her everything she desired. But in truth, it would mark the beginning of her torment.

Simon nodded, immediately grasping Alexander’s meaning. "I’ll handle it."

Meanwhile, Vanessa was restless.

From the moment she walked into the office that morning, the air felt thick with judgment.

As she headed to the break room for coffee, hushed whispers reached her ears.

"Can you believe it? Vanessa stole her sister’s fiancé just to climb the social ladder. How heartless!"

"Who wouldn’t want to marry into the Whitmore family? It’s practically a goldmine."

The words stung, but she forced a smile.

She had worked too hard to let gossip ruin her plans.

Yet, beneath her composed exterior, doubt gnawed at her.

What if Alexander had something worse in store for her?

The thought sent a chill down her spine.

She gripped her coffee cup tighter, her knuckles turning white.

This wasn’t just about securing her future anymore.

It was about survival.

The scalding coffee burned Vanessa's tongue as she overheard the whispered conversation.

"You honestly think Ethan would willingly marry her? That man deserves better than a gold-digging social climber."

"Marrying Vanessa would be career suicide. Can you imagine the jokes at the country club?"

A third voice chimed in, dripping with fake sympathy. "Poor Ethan. If I were him, I'd fake my own death to escape that train wreck."

The ceramic mug shattered against the tiled floor before Vanessa registered throwing it.

Silence.

Three horrified faces turned toward her, their gossip-smeared lips parting in unison.

Vanessa didn't speak. Didn't blink. The tremors in her hands had nothing to do with spilled coffee.

The coworkers scrambled like cockroaches under light, muttering excuses as they fled the breakroom.

Her assistant found her twenty minutes later, pressing ice cubes to her throbbing temples. A replacement latte appeared on the desk without comment.

The phone's vibration startled them both.

Nathan Reeves - Executive Assistant flashed across the screen.

Ethan's right-hand man never called without purpose.

Vanessa stared at the buzzing device, the unspoken question louder than any gossip: How much worse could today get?

The answer arrived with the next ring.

The morning sun filtered through the hospital windows as Nathan Reeves stood in the stairwell, his voice low but urgent.

"Mr. Ethan Caldwell woke up asking why you didn’t come to see him," he said. "The entire Caldwell family is here. He thinks this is your chance to make an impression."

Vanessa Hart’s eyes gleamed at his words.

This is it.

No matter how vicious the rumors were, no matter how absurd they sounded—none of it mattered.

The only thing that mattered was securing her place in the Caldwell family.

Once she was officially Ethan’s wife, no one would dare whisper behind her back.

She remembered how, just days ago, Ethan had publicly introduced her as his fiancée.

But she wasn’t naive.

Evelyn Carter had been engaged to him for three years, and look how easily he had discarded her.

Vanessa pressed her lips together.

"I need to be seen," she murmured. "The Caldwells need to acknowledge me. Only then will my position be secure."

She straightened her dress, smoothing out invisible wrinkles.

This was her moment.

And she wouldn’t waste it.

The morning sun streamed through the kitchen window as Evelyn Carter stood by the stove, flipping pancakes with practiced ease.

She glanced at her reflection in the stainless steel fridge and frowned.

I need to gain some weight.

Her fingers brushed over her collarbones, too prominent for her liking.

Looking like a ghost won’t do.

She poured maple syrup over her stack of pancakes, determined.

Losing my family was painful. Losing Alexander hurt worse. But losing myself? Unacceptable.

The fork clinked against the plate as she took a bite.

I’ll rise from this. Stronger. More radiant.

A smirk curled her lips.

Let them see me shine. Let them choke on their regret.

That was the best revenge—success wrapped in elegance.

Just as she finished washing the dishes, her phone buzzed.

Claire Dawson’s name flashed on the screen.

"Hey," Claire’s voice was strained. "Can you come to the hospital with me?"

Evelyn’s grip tightened on the phone.

"Of course. What’s wrong?"

Claire exhaled shakily.

"I’ll explain when you get here."

Evelyn grabbed her keys.

Whatever it was, she wouldn’t let Claire face it alone.

Evelyn didn't press for details. Instead, she quickly sent Claire her current location.

Thirty minutes later, Claire's car pulled up to the curb. Evelyn slid into the passenger seat, studying her friend's tense expression.

"Why the hospital visit? Are you sick?" Evelyn asked, concern lacing her voice.

Claire bit her lip, hesitating before giving a slow nod—then shaking her head just as quickly, as if conflicted.

A heavy silence stretched between them before Claire finally blurted out, "Last night... I slept with Lucas."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "Wait—weren't you two about to sign divorce papers? Is this some kind of reconciliation?"

Claire exhaled sharply, running a hand through her hair. She wasn't entirely sure how things had escalated the way they did.

Just last night, she had placed the divorce documents right in front of Lucas, fully expecting him to sign them so she could file the paperwork first thing in the morning.

But then—

One heated argument led to another.

And before she knew it, they were tangled in sheets instead of legal battles.

Now, sitting in the car with Evelyn, Claire couldn't decide if she regretted it or not.

The air between them grew thick with unspoken questions.

Evelyn waited, sensing there was more to the story.

Claire finally met her gaze, her voice barely above a whisper.

"What if I'm pregnant?"

The words hung in the air like a storm cloud.

Evelyn's breath caught.

This changed everything.
###Chapter 44 The Unexpected Demand

The documents lay scattered across the table, but Lucas had only skimmed through them before that infuriating smirk appeared.

Claire had been impatient. "Just sign it already. Don’t drag this out like some coward."

But Lucas had laughed, his dark eyes gleaming with mischief. "Oh, you want my signature? Ever heard of a farewell fling?"

Her breath hitched.

Seriously? They were on the verge of divorce, and this was what he wanted?

The realization stung—Lucas was exactly that kind of man. He had taken advantage of her vulnerability, leaving her frustrated and empty-handed, the papers still unsigned.

Rage simmered beneath her skin.

In two years of marriage, they had barely touched. Yet now, at the brink of separation, he couldn’t resist one last claim.

Just two weeks ago, after a similar encounter, he had leaned in, voice dripping with arrogance. "Claire, until that divorce is final, you’re still mine. Get used to it."

Her palm had met his cheek before she could stop herself.

And since then—silence. A cold war between them, neither willing to bend.

Claire watched Evelyn's face flush crimson as she listened to the explanation.

"So you're saying you had some spotting this morning, but it's not your cycle? You really should get that checked out," Claire said, her voice dropping to a concerned whisper.

Evelyn bit her lip and nodded. This wasn't something she could ignore.

The car ride stretched longer than expected through Cresthaven's midday traffic. Claire drummed her fingers on the steering wheel before breaking the silence.

"By the way, everyone's talking about you punching Ethan Caldwell. Rumor has it he's still hospitalized."

A quick glance confirmed Evelyn showed no remorse. After last night's confrontation, it was clear any affection for her ex-fiancé had evaporated.

Claire continued as they stopped at a red light. "The entire Caldwell clan descended on Willowbrook Medical Center at dawn."

She hesitated before adding, "Your husband, Alexander... he's probably there too."

Evelyn's breath caught. Her fingers tightened around the seatbelt as possibilities raced through her mind.

The light turned green. The car lurched forward, mirroring Evelyn's churning thoughts. What fresh chaos awaited at the hospital? And why would Alexander be there with the Caldwells after everything that had happened?

A dull ache pulsed in her abdomen, a physical echo of her growing unease. This wasn't just a routine checkup anymore. Something far more complicated was unfolding.

"Alexander went to see Ethan?"

Claire noticed the confusion in Evelyn's eyes and realized she probably didn't know about the connection between Alexander and Ethan.

It made sense.

Alexander had always been a mystery, only stepping into the public eye in the last year.

Before that, very few knew anything about him.

Besides, Evelyn had spent the past three years locked away in a remote prison, completely cut off from the outside world.

The traffic light turned green, and Claire pressed the accelerator gently. The car moved forward smoothly.

She kept her voice low. "Alexander is Ethan's uncle. He never told you?"

Evelyn's face went pale.

Her mind raced. Am I hearing this right, or is Claire playing some kind of cruel joke on me?

She turned to Claire, swallowing hard. "You're kidding, right?"

Claire's expression turned grave as she met Evelyn's gaze. "Do I seem like I'm playing games with you?"

Her next words struck like lightning.

"Alexander is Ethan's uncle—his blood relative. And Titan Capital Group? That belongs entirely to Alexander."

She added, "Alexander and Lucas are practically inseparable. I've even shared meals with Alexander before."

Evelyn's mind spun.

All this time, she had dismissed Alexander as just another insignificant businessman!

Questions erupted in her thoughts like wildfire.

"If that's true, why would he ever choose to marry me?"

The logic refused to align.

She had clung desperately to Ethan for seven years, only for Alexander—his own uncle—to claim her as his wife.

Wouldn't that make him the subject of ridicule?

Alexander was a titan of industry, a man who commanded respect. Surely, reputation mattered to him.

Did he truly not care about becoming the punchline of high society's jokes?

Her fingers tightened around her glass, the chill of condensation seeping into her skin.

The pieces didn't fit.

Unless...

Unless there was something she was missing.

Claire had pondered this very question all night.

Surely Alexander couldn’t be ignorant of the tangled past between Evelyn and Ethan.

If he knew and still chose to marry her, there was only one plausible explanation…

"Does he truly intend to repay you for saving his life?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, silent.

But there was another possibility—one that sent a shiver down Claire’s spine.

What if Alexander had fallen for Evelyn?

Not just a fleeting attraction, but something deeper, fiercer.

Something that made him willing to defy everything—even the ghosts of the past—just to claim her as his own.

The thought lingered, heavy and unspoken between them.

And in that silence, Claire realized the truth might be far more dangerous than she had imagined.
###Chapter 45 Ticket to Security

Evelyn swiftly pushed aside the absurd idea that had just surfaced in her mind.

Claire's enthusiasm was contagious as she steered their conversation in a new direction.

"But seriously, Alexander is quite the prize!"

"Just imagine! Once you and Alexander are married, you'll officially become Ethan's aunt! Could there be a more perfect revenge?"

"Picture this—every family gathering, you and Ethan crossing paths at the Whitmore estate. Ethan and Vanessa would have no choice but to toast to you, addressing you as 'Aunt Evelyn.' The irony would be absolutely delicious."

"Vanessa, who's spent years scheming to marry into the Whitmore family, would be left seething in the background. Can you even fathom how furious she'd be?"

Claire laughed, clearly relishing the mental image.

"And here's the best part—Alexander isn't just some ordinary guy. He's the CEO of Titan Capital Group! You have no idea—"

The numbers spoke for themselves.

Nearly half of Titan Capital Group's revenue came from Alexander Whitmore's personal investments.

Countless corporations depended on his financial backing to stay operational.

"Just imagine your father's reaction," Claire said excitedly, her eyes sparkling. "When Richard Hayes finds out you're marrying Alexander Whitmore, he'll practically crown you heir apparent overnight! A single deal from Alexander could fund Horizon Enterprises for an entire fiscal year."

Claire was unstoppable, her words tumbling out in an enthusiastic rush.

Evelyn, however, was laser-focused on the implications.

Her mind raced. Alexander is my golden ticket. If I secure this marriage, no one will dare challenge me again.

Whether Alexander's proposal stemmed from gratitude or some other motive didn't matter. Right now, he represented safety, power, and unshakable security.

Then Claire dropped the question that shattered Evelyn's composure.

"So... did you two... you know... last night?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched. Heat flooded her cheeks.

After a weighted pause, she shook her head. "No. We didn't."

The unspoken tension hung thick between them.

Claire's eyebrows shot up. "Seriously? Not even a kiss?"

Evelyn's grip tightened around her coffee cup. "It's... complicated."

Complicated didn't begin to cover it.

Alexander Whitmore might be her fiancé on paper, but the distance between them felt insurmountable.

And Evelyn had no idea how to bridge it.

Claire arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "You mean you slept in the same bed and nothing happened?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her purse strap as she recalled the previous night. "Not... exactly."

"Wait—hold on." Claire's grip on the steering wheel slackened in shock. "You shared a bed, and Alexander didn't even try anything?"

Her excitement got the better of her, and she accidentally slammed her palm against the horn, sending a sharp blast through the quiet hospital parking lot.

They had just pulled into the underground garage, the dim fluorescent lights casting long shadows as Claire expertly navigated the tight spaces.

"Damn." Claire exhaled sharply, her expression shifting from disbelief to something more calculating. "He really married you out of obligation."

A thought flickered through her mind: At first, I thought Alexander might have been drawn to Evelyn's beauty—enough to risk becoming Cresthaven's biggest joke by tying himself to her. Because let's face it, Evelyn is stunning.

But now? Sharing a bed without so much as a glance?

Either Alexander has zero interest in women... or he has zero interest in Evelyn specifically.

This changes everything.

The sterile white walls of the private hospital room seemed to amplify Ethan Caldwell's exhaustion.

Propped against the pillows, his usually immaculate appearance was replaced by a weary shadow of himself. The stitches along his forearm ached dully, a stark reminder of the previous night's chaos.

Dark circles bruised beneath his eyes, evidence of a sleepless night spent replaying every misstep. His right arm, wrapped tightly in bandages, rested stiffly at his side.

With a frustrated sigh, he dug into his pocket, only to toss an empty cigarette case onto the bedside table with a clatter.

Trevor Moss, who hadn’t left his side since the incident, wordlessly produced a fresh cigarette from his own jacket.

He had been the one to arrange Ethan’s discreet admission to the hospital, standing vigil through the long hours until dawn.

Ethan’s gaze flickered up, taking in Trevor’s unshaven jaw and rumpled clothes. "Go home," he muttered. "I don’t need a babysitter."

Trevor exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. "You’d be dead in a ditch if I left you alone right now."

The silence between them was heavy, punctuated only by the distant hum of hospital machinery.

Ethan flexed his injured hand, wincing. "This isn’t over."

Trevor’s expression darkened. "It better be. Unless you’re planning to get yourself killed next time."

A bitter smirk twisted Ethan’s lips. "Wouldn’t that solve everyone’s problems?"

Trevor didn’t answer.

The morning light filtering through the blinds did nothing to soften the tension in the room.

Somewhere beyond these walls, the consequences of last night were still unfolding.

And Ethan Caldwell was far from done.

Nathan flicked open his silver lighter with practiced ease, the flame dancing as he lit Ethan's cigarette.

"Easy does it," Nathan murmured, snapping the lighter shut with a metallic click. "I'll check on you later."

Just as Trevor turned to leave, the door swung open with force.

Alexander strode in, his presence commanding immediate attention. Behind him trailed a small crowd of associates, their polished shoes clicking against the marble floor.

The air shifted instantly—charged, tense.

Ethan exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his gaze locking onto Alexander's. A silent challenge passed between them.

Nathan stepped back, sensing the brewing storm.

Trevor hesitated near the exit, caught between leaving and staying to witness what came next.

The room held its breath.
###Chapter 46 The Accusation

The morning sun had barely risen when Eleanor Caldwell received the devastating call. Her son Ethan had been brutally assaulted at Eclipse Lounge the previous night.

Her perfectly manicured hands trembled as she grabbed her coat and rushed out the door.

The car ride to the hospital was a blur of frantic phone calls. With each new detail, her pulse spiked—fury and fear warring inside her chest.

For days now, Eleanor had been locked in a silent battle with Ethan.

The reason for her rage was simple. At that press conference, he had shamelessly announced his engagement switch—from Evelyn Carter to Vanessa Hart—without so much as consulting her.

The mere thought of Vanessa taking Evelyn’s place made Eleanor’s stomach churn.

Evelyn, at least, had been devoted to Ethan. She had been predictable, malleable.

But Vanessa? A woman with no pedigree, no connections, no discernible past?

Eleanor’s lips curled in disgust.

This wasn’t just about the engagement. It was about respect. Control.

And now, with Ethan lying in a hospital bed, she had every intention of making her displeasure known.

Eleanor had been pushed aside as if Ethan no longer valued her input.

Her blood boiled with fury. She was prepared to confront Ethan and demand an apology for his blatant disrespect.

But before she could unleash her anger, devastating news reached her—Ethan had been attacked.

Without a second thought, she rushed to the hospital, her heart pounding with dread.

Yet, as whispers spread, the second and third branches of the family caught wind of the incident. Soon, the hospital room was crowded with relatives, their expressions ranging from concern to thinly veiled judgment.

Ethan lay in the hospital bed, his jaw tight as he surveyed the sudden gathering.

Eleanor’s face was stormy, her patience worn thin.

"Ethan! What in the world happened? You let a woman beat you up?" Her voice was sharp with disbelief. "And what about Evelyn? Wasn’t she the one who used to follow you around like a lovesick puppy? Now she’s turned into some kind of vengeful demon?"

Ethan didn’t respond. Instead, he reached for a cigarette, his fingers trembling slightly.

The memory of Evelyn’s cold, unflinching glare as she hurled the bottle at him replayed in his mind.

Her eyes had burned with a fury he’d never seen before.

And for the first time, Ethan Caldwell felt something unfamiliar—fear.

The air between them had turned icy, though Evelyn had always carried herself with effortless grace. Now, there was an invisible barrier, separating her from the rest.

Sophia Ellis, Alexander’s sister-in-law, seized the moment to intervene. "Eleanor, let’s not forget—Ethan was the one who betrayed Evelyn first. You can’t pin all the blame on her."

Sophia had never gotten along with Eleanor, and it was clear she was enjoying this opportunity to twist the knife.

Eleanor’s glare could have melted steel, but Sophia remained unbothered. "Just last week, Ethan was photographed leaving a hotel with another woman. Can you honestly blame Evelyn for reacting the way she did?"

She shrugged, feigning neutrality. "I’m not picking sides. I’m just stating facts."

"If you want someone to blame, look at your own son’s actions. Evelyn isn’t the villain here."

Eleanor’s face flushed with anger as she turned on Sophia. "Are you saying my son deserved what happened to him?"

Grace Caldwell, Ethan’s sister, stepped forward, her expression furious. "Of course not! I’m going to find Evelyn and make her answer for this!"

Just as Evelyn spun on her heel to leave, Ethan's voice cut through the tension. "Wait!"

"Ethan?" Grace turned, eyebrows raised in surprise.

"You want me to humiliate myself further?" Ethan snapped.

The scandal surrounding his messy breakup with Vanessa had already turned him into Cresthaven's favorite punchline.

After last night's disaster, the rumors were undeniable—Ethan had been caught red-handed.

If his family went after Vanessa now, it would only make things worse.

He'd go from a pitiful ex to a full-blown villain—not just a cheater, but a man who couldn't let go.

Grace's interference would ruin whatever dignity he had left.

The air in the room thickened.

Audrey Mills, Alexander's sister-in-law, tilted her head. "Ethan, where's Vanessa? Shouldn't she be here? You look like you've been dragged through hell, and your fiancée hasn't even bothered to check on you?"

Every head in the room turned toward the door.

The person who bore the most responsibility for Ethan's current situation was undoubtedly Vanessa.

Hadn't he distanced himself from Evelyn solely for her sake?

Wasn't this the very reason he now lay in such a pitiful state?

Just then, Vanessa stepped into the room, clutching a bouquet of white lilies. "Ethan, I came to check on you—ah!"

Before she could finish, Eleanor's hand lashed out, striking Vanessa hard across the cheek.

The flowers tumbled to the ground, petals scattering like broken promises.

The sharp edge of Eleanor’s diamond ring left a thin crimson line on Vanessa’s porcelain skin.

Staggering back from the force of the blow, Vanessa barely had time to register the pain before Eleanor struck again—this time with even greater fury.

"How dare you show your face here!" Eleanor snarled, her voice trembling with barely contained rage. "You scheming little witch! You’re the reason my son is in this state!"

Vanessa’s eyes widened in shock, her hand flying to her stinging cheek.

Eleanor wasn’t finished. "If it weren’t for you, Ethan would never have turned his back on Evelyn! Look at what you’ve done!"

The accusation hung heavy in the air, thick with blame.

Vanessa’s lips parted, but no words came out—only silence, and the faint metallic taste of blood where her teeth had cut into her lip.

Eleanor’s chest heaved with each furious breath, her manicured nails digging into her palms. "Get out," she hissed. "Before I make sure you regret ever crossing paths with my family."

Vanessa’s gaze flickered to Ethan—still unconscious, still oblivious to the storm raging around him.

Then, without another word, she turned and fled, leaving behind only the crushed petals and the weight of her guilt.
###Chapter 47 A Storm of Blows

The slap echoed through the room like a gunshot.

"Not only have you humiliated him, but you've also torn us apart!"

Eleanor's voice was razor-sharp, her eyes blazing with fury.

Vanessa barely had time to register the words before the second strike landed, sending her stumbling back.

Her cheek burned, the skin already swelling beneath Eleanor's perfectly manicured fingers.

Vanessa had always known Eleanor despised her.

The woman was the epitome of old-money elegance—cold, poised, and utterly untouchable.

She had expected disdain, perhaps a cutting remark or two.

But this?

This was raw, unfiltered rage.

Eleanor's chest heaved, her breath coming in short, furious bursts.

The sight of Vanessa—her perfectly styled hair, her designer dress—only fueled the fire.

How dare she?

Eleanor's thoughts were a whirlwind of indignation.

Who does she think she is, standing there as if she belongs?

Vanessa pressed a trembling hand to her stinging cheek, her mind racing.

This wasn't just anger.

This was war.

Vanessa's pathetic little schemes were laughably obvious to Eleanor.

She'd spent decades fending off gold-diggers like Vanessa who circled around her husband Vincent like vultures.

Eleanor had clawed her way to the top of high society, shielding Vincent from opportunistic women with razor-sharp precision.

Just when she thought the battle was won, here came another social climber—this time targeting her son Ethan.

Eleanor Whitmore wasn't one to tolerate disrespect.

The sight of Vanessa's smug face triggered memories of Ethan's recent defiance.

For years, Ethan had been the perfect son—obedient, respectful, malleable. Until this red-haired schemer slithered into their lives.

Without consulting her, he'd broken off his engagement to Evelyn and publicly claimed Vanessa instead.

Worse—she'd learned about it through society gossip like some common bystander.

The thought of this manipulative tart stealing her son ignited white-hot fury in Eleanor's veins.

Her manicured fingers twitched with the urge to wipe that fake innocence off Vanessa's face. Permanently.

The sunlight streaming through the windows did nothing to soften the tension in the room.

Eleanor Whitmore wasn’t fooled. She had lived long enough to recognize ambition disguised as love.

Was Vanessa Hart truly devoted to Ethan, or was it the Caldwell name she coveted?

The cold calculation in Vanessa’s eyes was unmistakable—nothing like Evelyn Carter’s sincerity when she looked at Alexander.

"Gold-digging tramp!" Eleanor’s voice cut through the air like a whip. "You think you deserve my son? You’re not even worthy to polish his shoes!"

Ignoring the shocked gasps from the Whitmore relatives, Eleanor lunged forward.

Her palm connected with Vanessa’s cheek in a sharp crack.

"You think you can just waltz in here and become a Caldwell? Who the hell do you think you are?"

Before anyone could intervene, Eleanor had Vanessa pinned to the ground, raining down blows.

Vanessa hadn’t seen this coming.

She had arrived at Whitmore Manor confident, ready to charm the family and secure her engagement to Ethan.

But now, under Eleanor’s assault, she couldn’t fight back—not against the matriarch.

Grace Caldwell joined in, her manicured nails scratching at Vanessa’s arms.

Vanessa writhed, pain radiating through her body, but there was no escape.

Her lips parted in a silent scream.

Vanessa's scream for help pierced through the hospital room.

Ethan's eyes snapped open at the commotion. He lunged from the bed, pulling Grace and Eleanor away from Vanessa with desperate strength.

"Stop this! Enough!"

His sudden movement sent Eleanor staggering back, nearly toppling over. Grace caught her just in time, steadying her mother.

"Vanessa didn’t do anything wrong!" Ethan's voice was sharp, his jaw clenched. "Mom, look at yourself—this isn’t you!"

Eleanor’s face twisted in fury as she saw her son shielding Vanessa. "You’re defending her?"

Ethan’s pulse pounded in his temples. He motioned for Vanessa to step behind him. "My injuries have nothing to do with Vanessa. I was the one who announced the engagement."

Vanessa’s hair was disheveled, her cheeks streaked with angry red marks. A thin trail of blood trickled from her lip.

She looked broken.

But in front of the Caldwells, she refused to let a single tear fall. Crying would only make things worse. So she kept her head down, trying to disappear into the shadows.

The air crackled with tension as Eleanor's laughter turned sharp and bitter. "So you're defending her now?" Her voice trembled with barely contained rage. "Ethan, do I even exist to you anymore?"

Before anyone could react, Eleanor lunged forward, her fingers twisting into Vanessa's hair with vicious intent. She yanked hard, dragging her toward the door.

Vanessa gasped, her hands flying up instinctively to protect her scalp. The pain was sharp, immediate.

Ethan moved like lightning, his body blocking Eleanor's path. "Mother, stop!" His voice was firm, but his eyes betrayed his conflict.

Eleanor's grip only tightened. "You think you can shield her from this?" Her words were laced with venom. "After everything she's done?"

Vanessa stumbled, her balance lost as Eleanor pulled again. The room spun—faces blurred—anger and humiliation burned through her.

Then, without warning, Eleanor's free hand swung.

A sharp crack echoed.

Vanessa's cheek stung, the force snapping her head to the side.

Silence fell.

Ethan's breath hitched. His mother had never been violent—not like this.

Eleanor's chest heaved, her fingers still tangled in Vanessa's hair. "This isn't over," she hissed.

Vanessa lifted her chin, defiance flashing in her eyes despite the throbbing pain. "Then finish it."

The challenge hung in the air, heavy and dangerous.

Eleanor's lips curled.

And she raised her hand again.
###Chapter 48 The Storm Arrives

Ethan Caldwell's injured arm throbbed as he struggled to shield Vanessa Hart.

The situation worsened when Grace Caldwell openly sided with Eleanor, turning the confrontation into a three-way battle. The women's drama left Ethan feeling utterly helpless.

His stomach twisted as he watched Vanessa being pulled away by Eleanor's grip. Direct confrontation wasn't an option—not with his mother's temper flaring.

Instead, he turned to his sister, voice sharp with urgency. "Grace! Stop this madness. Get Mom off Vanessa now!"

Grace didn’t budge.

Her resentment toward Vanessa had festered ever since Ethan’s failed engagement turned her into the school’s latest gossip topic.

"Ethan, Mom’s right!" Grace snapped. "Vanessa isn’t good enough for you!"

Chaos erupted.

Relatives from the secondary branches hovered at the edges, eyes wide, unwilling to get involved. The air crackled with tension, the room dividing into invisible battle lines.

Ethan’s jaw clenched.

He had to act—fast.

The door swung open abruptly.

An elderly man in a wheelchair rolled into the room, his presence commanding immediate attention.

The sight of the chaos before him made his grip falter—the porcelain cup slipped from his fingers and shattered against the marble floor.

The sharp sound cut through the tension like a knife.

Everyone froze.

The four figures locked in their heated confrontation turned as one, their expressions shifting from fury to shock.

"Father."

"Grandfather."

"Uncle Alexander...?"

It was Harold Aniston, patriarch of the Whitmore family, with Ethan Caldwell trailing behind him—and Alexander Whitmore himself, his expression as unreadable as ever.

Alexander took in the scene with a single glance, his lips thinning slightly. If he was surprised, he didn’t show it.

Amid the sudden silence, Ethan felt warmth spreading across his forearm.

Fresh blood seeped through his bandages, staining the crisp white fabric.

Eleanor noticed but deliberately looked away, her jaw clenched. She was still seething over how Ethan had shielded Vanessa earlier.

Harold’s voice, deep and authoritative, filled the room.

"What in God’s name is happening here?"

Creating a spectacle in a hospital? You're practically handing out free entertainment!

Though the VIP ward on the top floor was designed for privacy, it wasn’t exclusive to the Whitmore family. The commotion had drawn a crowd—curious bystanders lingered outside, some even recording the chaos on their phones.

Harold Whitmore, now in his golden years, had long distanced himself from family drama, preferring the quiet pleasures of chess and afternoon tea.

But lately, murmurs of discord had reached his ears, impossible to ignore.

He turned to Alexander. "You’re the head of the family now. Handle this."

Harold had already stepped back, leaving Alexander in charge. His word was final, and no one dared defy it.

Simon swiftly brought over a chair for Alexander to sit.

The air thickened with tension.

Evelyn stood frozen, her fingers curling into fists at her sides. The last thing she wanted was to be the center of another Whitmore family scandal.

Vanessa, however, seemed to thrive on the attention, her lips twisting into a smirk. "Oh, please. As if anyone here cares about your opinion, Evelyn."

Alexander’s gaze darkened. "Enough."

The single word cut through the room like a blade.

Simon stepped forward, his voice firm. "Miss Hart, I suggest you reconsider your tone."

Vanessa scoffed, but the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes betrayed her bravado.

Outside, the whispers grew louder.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. This was spiraling out of control.

Then, a new voice cut through the tension.

"Really, Vanessa? Must you always turn everything into a circus?"

Claire strode in, her sharp heels clicking against the floor, her expression unimpressed.

Vanessa’s smirk faltered. "This doesn’t concern you."

Claire arched a brow. "Funny, because it looks like you’re making it everyone’s problem."

Alexander’s jaw tightened. "Simon, clear the hallway."

With a nod, Simon moved to disperse the onlookers.

Evelyn finally found her voice. "We should take this somewhere private."

Alexander’s eyes met hers, and for a brief moment, the storm in them softened.

Then, just as quickly, it returned.

"Agreed."

Vanessa opened her mouth to protest, but one look from Alexander silenced her.

The game had changed.

And Evelyn wasn’t sure if she was ready for what came next.

Alexander's icy stare cut through the tension in the room. "Someone explain. Now."

Sophia, never one to miss an opportunity to provoke, smirked. "Isn't it obvious? Eleanor’s lost her mind over her son’s choice of fiancée!"

Eleanor’s voice was sharp as shattered glass. "Fiancée? That woman is nothing to this family! I will never accept her!"

Sophia let out a mocking laugh. "Oh, please. Your son just publicly announced his engagement to Vanessa. Denying it now just makes you look desperate."

Eleanor’s glare burned into Vanessa, her fury barely contained.

She and Sophia had always been at odds. Every clash between them had ended with Sophia walking away unscathed.

But this time—being humiliated because of Vanessa—it was unbearable. It pushed Eleanor to the edge.

The Whitmore family’s dysfunction was no secret.

Harold, in his prime, had been a notorious charmer, leaving behind a trail of broken hearts and bitter rivalries.

Now, history seemed to be repeating itself.

Vanessa stood frozen, the weight of their hostility pressing down on her.

Alexander’s jaw tightened. "Enough." His voice was low, dangerous. "Vanessa stays. That’s final."

Eleanor’s face twisted in outrage. "You would choose her over your own family?"

Sophia crossed her arms, watching the scene unfold with amusement. "Oh, this is getting good."

Alexander didn’t flinch. "I choose who I want. And if you can’t accept that, then you are the one who doesn’t belong here."

The room fell silent.

Eleanor’s hands trembled.

Then—

The doors burst open.

Harold strode in, his presence commanding immediate attention.

His sharp eyes swept over the room before landing on Alexander. "What the hell is going on?"

Sophia grinned. "Just your usual family drama. Nothing new."

Harold’s expression darkened. "This ends now."

Vanessa held her breath.

Because she knew—

The real storm had only just begun.

Harold Whitmore had taken four different women as his wives.

His first marriage barely survived five years. After their eldest son Vincent was born, the relationship between Harold and his first wife crumbled beyond repair.

Within a year, he remarried—this time to a woman who bore him his second son, Patrick Whitmore.

But that marriage, too, was short-lived. It had been a transaction from the start, a calculated alliance. Once their mutual interests dissolved, so did their union. Their separation was cold, devoid of any lingering affection.

His third child, Theodore, was the unexpected result of a reckless night with a dancer from the wrong side of the tracks.

She never stepped foot in Whitmore Manor as a recognized wife, leaving Theodore to grow up as Harold’s only illegitimate son.

Alexander, the youngest, was the sole child from Harold’s final and only stable marriage.

Four sons. Four mothers. The fractures within the Whitmore dynasty were impossible to ignore.

Each branch of the family operated in shadows, wearing masks of civility while sharpening knives behind closed doors.

Eleanor, her fury barely contained, swore through gritted teeth, "As long as I draw breath—"

"That wedding will never happen!" Eleanor's voice cut through the tense silence like a knife.

Alexander turned to Ethan, his piercing gaze demanding an answer. "Your mother is completely against your engagement to Vanessa. Do you have anything to say about that?"

The air in the room grew heavier, thick with unspoken tension.

Ethan's jaw clenched, his fingers tightening around the edge of the polished mahogany table. His mother's disapproval wasn't unexpected, but hearing it voiced so bluntly in front of Alexander still stung.

Vanessa stood frozen near the window, her delicate fingers gripping the silk drapes. The golden afternoon light cast long shadows across her face, highlighting the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes.

Eleanor crossed her arms, her expression unyielding. "I won't stand by and watch my son make such a reckless decision."

Ethan finally spoke, his voice low but firm. "Mother, this isn't your choice to make."

Alexander's lips curled into a cold smile. "Interesting. So you're willing to defy your own family for her?"

Vanessa inhaled sharply, her chest tightening. She had known this moment would come—the moment where loyalty and love would be tested.

But she hadn't expected it to hurt this much.

Eleanor's gaze flickered between them, her disapproval radiating like an icy wind. "Mark my words, Ethan. If you go through with this, there will be consequences."

The threat hung in the air, heavy and suffocating.

Ethan's eyes darkened with defiance. "Then so be it."

Vanessa's breath caught.

Was he really choosing her over everything else?

Or was this just another game?

Alexander watched them both, his expression unreadable.

The battle lines had been drawn.

And the war was only beginning.

###Chapter 49 The Final Act

Ethan Caldwell was completely drained.

The chaos from earlier had left him restless all night, and now his head throbbed relentlessly.

At the center of it all was his engagement to Vanessa Hart—a situation that had spiraled far beyond his control.

He had to admit, he had severely misjudged the circumstances.

Ever since the grand birthday celebration, everything had taken a sharp, unpredictable turn.

Evelyn Carter, who had once been utterly devoted to him, had abruptly called off their engagement. From that moment, Ethan felt as if he were trapped in a relentless storm.

What he hadn’t expected was Vanessa getting dragged into this mess as well.

If it hadn’t been for that intrusive reporter capturing their compromising photo, things might not have escalated to this point.

Ethan genuinely wanted to marry Vanessa, but after such a public scandal, who wouldn’t question their choices?

Especially now, as a man of high standing in Cresthaven.

The weight of expectations pressed down on him.

His reputation was at stake.

His family’s name was on the line.

And worst of all—he had no idea how to fix it.

The engagement had been meant to secure alliances, to strengthen his position.

Instead, it had become a liability.

Vanessa’s involvement complicated things further.

She wasn’t just some random woman—she was Evelyn’s stepsister.

The media had already spun the story into a sordid love triangle.

Ethan clenched his fists, frustration boiling inside him.

He needed a solution.

Fast.

But every path he considered only led to more complications.

His phone buzzed—another message from his mother, Eleanor.

The family was demanding answers.

The board of Horizon Enterprises was growing restless.

And Alexander Whitmore—Evelyn’s new husband—was watching everything unfold with cold amusement.

Ethan exhaled sharply.

This wasn’t just a personal disaster.

It was a battle for power.

And if he didn’t act soon, he would lose everything.

Ethan Caldwell felt like the universe was laughing at him.

The weight of humiliation pressed down on his shoulders as Vanessa Hart's eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

"It's all my fault..." Vanessa whispered, her fingers trembling as they brushed against his. Her voice cracked, and two crystalline tears escaped, landing softly on his skin like shattered glass.

"I... I'll walk away. Just tell them I was the one who came onto you. I'll bear the blame—I just need you to be okay."

Before he could respond, she pulled away, turning to leave. But her heel caught on a discarded bouquet, sending her stumbling forward.

Instinct took over. Ethan's arms shot out, catching her before she could fall, pulling her tight against his chest.

Vanessa's head bowed as if the world had collapsed around her, silent sobs wracking her frame.

The sight tore at Ethan's heart.

What the hell am I doing?

Vanessa was the one suffering. She was willing to sacrifice everything for him, and here he was, drowning in his own self-pity.

As a man, what kind of coward was he?

Ethan's jaw tightened with resolve as he turned to Alexander. "Uncle Alexander, I want to marry Vanessa. Please stand with us."

The sharp crack of Eleanor's palm striking Ethan's face shattered the tense silence.

"Oh, so you've grown bold, have you?" Eleanor's voice dripped with venom. "You dare defy me for some woman?"

Her fury was palpable.

No one had anticipated she would strike her own son.

The room plunged into suffocating silence, every occupant frozen in shock.

Just as the tension became unbearable, Alexander spoke, his voice calm but firm. "Eleanor, if Ethan is this determined to marry Vanessa, perhaps you should let them."

"And why should I?" Eleanor snapped, her eyes blazing.

Alexander remained composed. "Look at the situation. Refusing won't change anything. Your son has already made his choice public. He's willing to face the consequences for her."

"If you keep fighting this, you'll only turn the Caldwell name into Cresthaven's biggest joke."

Eleanor's fists trembled at her sides, her nails digging into her palms. She couldn't bring herself to face Alexander directly. Instead, she turned to Harold, her voice sharp with desperation.

"Father, are you really going to stay silent? Will you just let Ethan disgrace our family like this?"

Harold, seated in his wheelchair, exhaled heavily, the weight of years pressing down on him. His voice was weary but firm. "I've made my decision. Alexander leads this family now."

With that, he gestured to Harrison Wells, the family butler. "Harrison, take me back to my room."

The dismissal in his tone was unmistakable. He had no interest in the unfolding drama.

Alexander seized the moment, his gaze icy as it locked onto Eleanor. "If you want to salvage what little dignity Ethan has left, you'll accept this. He's already humiliated himself. Do you really want the Whitmore name dragged through the mud with him?"

His words were a blade, sharp and unyielding. A subtle tension coiled in the air as his eyes narrowed, the warning clear.

Eleanor's lips pressed into a thin line, resentment burning in her chest. She shot Vanessa a venomous glare but couldn't bring herself to utter the words that would bind Ethan to her.

All she managed was a bitter, "I'm done with this," before turning on her heel and storming out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

As the final act concluded, the remaining relatives exchanged uneasy glances before slipping away, one by one, leaving only silence in their wake.

Vanessa's fingers quivered, not with terror but with exhilaration.

After all the chaos, she had finally breached the Whitmore family's inner circle!

Overcome with emotion, she turned to Alexander, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "Alexander," she breathed, voice thick with gratitude, "I can't thank you enough for believing in me."

The grand hall of Whitmore Manor hummed with hushed whispers, the weight of the moment pressing down on them.

Vanessa straightened her spine, her crimson gown pooling around her like spilled wine. This was her moment—her triumph.

Alexander gave her a measured nod, his piercing gaze unreadable. "You earned your place," he said simply.

A thrill shot through her.

She had done it.

The years of scheming, the careful manipulation—all of it had led to this.

Across the room, Evelyn Carter stood frozen, her expression a mask of quiet devastation.

Vanessa allowed herself a small, victorious smile.

The curtain had fallen.

And she was no longer in the shadows.
###Chapter 50 Pregnant

Alexander barely spared her a glance, his expression unreadable. "Stand up for you? I'm merely protecting the Whitmore family's honor."

His cold gaze then shifted to Ethan. "So, when exactly are you planning to announce the wedding date?"

Ethan seemed lost in his own thoughts, barely registering the question.

His mind was numb. He was supposed to be the groom, yet there was no excitement, no anticipation—just a heavy, suffocating exhaustion.

Vanessa gently tugged at his sleeve. "Ethan, Uncle Alexander is speaking to you. He wants to know when we should set the date so preparations can begin..."

A sharp surge of irritation shot through him. He snatched a cigarette from Nathan and clenched it between his teeth.

"You decide. I need air."

Before Vanessa could protest, he was already striding away, the weight of the world pressing down on his shoulders.

The hospital corridors buzzed with activity as Evelyn Carter guided Claire Dawson toward the gynecologist's office.

Claire's grip on Evelyn's arm tightened as they stepped inside.

When they emerged, Claire's face had lost all color.

Evelyn frowned. "What's wrong? What did the doctor say?"

Claire exhaled shakily. "I'm pregnant. Less than a month."

Meanwhile, Vanessa Hart floated through the Whitmore Manor, her heart light with triumph.

Today was not a day for doubts.

Alexander Whitmore's distant demeanor would have wounded her on any other occasion, but not today.

Not when she was about to become a Whitmore.

Men never cared for wedding details anyway. She understood that.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen, checking dates.

"Alexander," she said brightly, "how about the eighth of next month? It's an auspicious day."

For a family like the Whitmores, a month was more than enough to arrange a grand wedding.

Her future was set.

Nothing could ruin this moment.

Not even the shadow of uncertainty in Alexander's eyes.

Evelyn gasped in shock.

Claire's emotions erupted as she sank to the floor in the corridor, fingers tangling in her hair. "I'm filing for divorce from Lucas, and now this? Pregnant? This has to be some cruel joke."

In their two years of marriage, Lucas had rarely shared her bed.

Yet now, just as she was ready to cut all ties, fate decided to drop this bombshell.

Evelyn hesitated before murmuring, "Maybe... this baby could change things. It might give you and Lucas a second chance."

Claire's eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "But his heart belongs to someone else. What kind of life would this child have? Using a baby to trap a man—would that ever lead to real happiness?"

Evelyn fell silent, absorbing Claire's words.

After a heavy pause, she whispered, "So... what are you going to do about the baby?"

Claire pushed herself up, jaw set. "I'm not keeping it. I'll schedule the procedure immediately. The sooner, the better."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "You're not even going to tell Lucas?"

Evelyn hesitated, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap.

The weight of her decision pressed heavily on her chest.

"Claire, he's still the father," Evelyn said gently, her voice laced with concern. "Don’t you think Lucas has a right to know?"

She understood the turmoil in Claire’s heart—the lingering feelings for Lucas, the fear of regret.

"Even if you choose not to keep it, you shouldn’t carry this alone while he walks away untouched," Evelyn continued, her tone firm.

"How can you be okay with this? You’re sacrificing everything for them, and he doesn’t even know this child exists?" Her voice cracked with frustration. "This isn’t fair."

"In the end, you’re the one who will suffer—physically, emotionally. Claire, is this really what you want?"

Evelyn’s words hung in the air, sharp and unrelenting.

"What about the two years you gave him?"

"And now he’s with someone else, yet he still came to you? That doesn’t mean he’s serious about her."

Claire’s breath hitched, her vision blurring with unshed tears.

Evelyn’s words had only tangled her thoughts further.

Her hands trembled as she pressed them to her face.

"What do I do now?" Claire whispered, her voice breaking.

Vanessa's voice was firm as she spoke. "First, go home tonight. Find the right moment to tell Lucas about the pregnancy."

She leaned closer, her eyes sharp with determination. "If he agrees to terminate it, then he needs to take full responsibility—the medical appointments, the procedure, and your recovery. That’s the bare minimum a man should do."

Her lips curled in disdain. "Did he think he could just walk away after having his fun? As if he’s untouchable?"

Vanessa’s grip on Evelyn’s wrist tightened. "Make sure he never forgets. He had a child, and because of him, it’s gone. That guilt should haunt him for the rest of his life. Every time he closes his eyes, he should remember what he took from you."

The words hung heavy in the air, laced with bitterness.

Evelyn swallowed hard, her fingers trembling.

Vanessa wasn’t finished. "And if he hesitates? If he tries to convince you to keep it?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Then you make him regret that too."

A cold shiver ran down Evelyn’s spine.

This wasn’t just advice.

It was a warning.
###Chapter 51 The Truth Unveiled

Ethan Caldwell stood in the dimly lit hospital corridor, the weight of the day pressing heavily on his shoulders.

He took a slow drag from his cigarette, the smoke curling around him like a shroud.

The chaos from Evelyn’s hospital room had drawn far too much attention. Now, every passing nurse, patient, and visitor seemed to recognize him, their whispers sharp as knives.

Their judgmental stares made his skin crawl.

With a frustrated sigh, he flicked the cigarette butt to the ground, grinding it beneath his polished shoe.

This place suffocated him.

Needing space, he descended the stairs, seeking refuge in the quieter, less crowded lobby below.

As he settled into a shadowed corner, the elevator doors slid open with a soft chime.

Evelyn stepped out, her phone pressed to her ear, her expression tense.

Ethan’s lips curled into a cold smirk.

Just hours ago, Richard Hayes had assured him she would come crawling back, begging for forgiveness.

Yet here she was, still defiant.

His fingers twitched, itching to remind her of her place.

But he forced himself to stay still, watching as she strode past, oblivious to his presence.

The game wasn’t over yet.

And he had no intention of losing.

Ethan Caldwell smirked to himself. "After yesterday's showdown, I was sure she'd never speak to me again."

His fingers tapped impatiently against his thigh as he watched the elevator doors.

"But here she comes crawling back to apologize?"

The thought made his jaw tighten. "She's trying too damn hard. Pathetic."

Vanessa Hart's heels clicked across the marble floor as she approached. Ethan immediately straightened his tie and schooled his features into icy indifference.

He crossed his arms, ready to deliver a scathing remark.

Then she stopped dead.

Her phone buzzed insistently in her manicured hand.

Ethan's eyebrow twitched as she answered with a breathy, "Yes, I'm on my way now."

Without so much as a glance in his direction, Vanessa pivoted on her stilettos and strode toward the exit.

His mouth fell open slightly.

"Did she just—"

The glass doors swung shut behind her.

Ethan's grip on his briefcase turned white-knuckled. A dark chuckle escaped him.

"Unbelievable."

The elevator dinged behind him. His smirk returned, sharper now.

"This isn't over, sweetheart."

Alexander's lips curled slightly as he observed from the shadows. "Interesting. She's grown sharper."

His piercing gaze tracked every movement across the ballroom.

Ethan Caldwell stiffened when the familiar chill of Alexander's presence crept up his spine. Turning abruptly, he found himself face-to-face with his formidable uncle.

"Uncle Alexander."

Alexander's eyes narrowed, his voice deceptively light. "Find something captivating?"

Ethan shrugged with practiced nonchalance. "Just passing time."

"Is that so?" Alexander's tone turned glacial. "Your fiancée is growing impatient upstairs."

Silence stretched between them.

"Congratulations are in order," Alexander continued flatly. "A perfect match."

"Thank you, Uncle."

As Ethan moved to leave, a glint of silver caught his eye—a unfamiliar signet ring adorning Alexander's finger.

The unfamiliar jewelry made Ethan pause. He'd never seen his uncle wear anything so personal before.

The ring's intricate design seemed to whisper secrets.

Ethan's fingers twitched with the urge to ask.

But Alexander's warning glare stopped him cold.

Some questions were better left unanswered.

Alexander paused mid-sentence, his curiosity instantly ignited.

That's peculiar, he thought.

Since when does Uncle Nathan wear something like that?

The dining table was lavishly set with five exquisite dishes and a steaming soup. Alexander arrived home precisely at six o'clock.

As soon as he crossed the threshold, the rich aroma of the meal enveloped him, and a flicker of surprise lit up his eyes.

Evelyn stepped out of the kitchen, balancing the final dish in her hands. "Go wash up—dinner's ready!"

Alexander arched a brow, amusement dancing in his gaze. "This looks rather extravagant."

Evelyn beamed, nodding eagerly. "I made it especially for you."

His eyes lingered on her face, her words stirring something unexpected within him.

After dinner, Evelyn curled up on the sofa, hugging a throw pillow to her chest. "Alexander, we need to talk."

He frowned slightly as he hung his suit jacket on the coat rack. "What's on your mind?"

Tucking her legs beneath her, Evelyn looked up, her eyes shimmering with emotion. "Why are you marrying me?"

Alexander's throat tightened, his composure slipping for the first time.

"I spent seven years chasing after your nephew, Ethan. How could I possibly be the right woman for you?"

His piercing gaze locked onto mine, unreadable yet intense.

"You already know?"

The air between us grew heavy with unspoken words.

My fingers trembled slightly as I clutched the edge of my dress. The weight of my past with Ethan pressed down on me like an invisible chain.

Alexander remained motionless, his expression carefully guarded. Yet the tension in his jaw betrayed him.

I had never seen him like this—so still, so controlled, yet radiating quiet turmoil.

The silence stretched between us, thick with questions neither of us dared to voice.

Then, his voice came low, barely above a whisper.

"Tell me everything."

My breath hitched.

This was it—the moment I had been avoiding. The truth I had buried for so long was about to surface.

And once it did, nothing would ever be the same.
###Chapter 52 Hold Your Head High

Evelyn nodded slowly, her fingers tracing the rim of her teacup. "You're Ethan's uncle, the head of the Whitmore family. Claire told me everything."

Her voice was steady, but her pulse betrayed her.

"Ethan practically trembles in your presence."

She exhaled sharply, meeting Alexander's gaze. "And yet, you married me. How will it feel sitting across from him at family dinners without it being unbearably awkward?"

The question had haunted her all day.

If this went wrong, Alexander could become the subject of ridicule—something a man of his standing didn’t need.

Yes, one could argue it was a favor, but debts could be repaid in countless ways.

When Alexander remained silent, Evelyn tilted her head. "So? Help me understand."

Instead of answering, Alexander leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable. The dim light caught the sharp angles of his face, making him look even more formidable.

"Mrs. Whitmore," he said, his voice low and deliberate, "since you know I'm Ethan's uncle, you must realize what marrying me means."

A pause. Then, the faintest curve of his lips.

"You'll never have to lower your head in the Hart family again. No more whispers. No more judgment."

His words settled between them, heavy with promise.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

For the first time in years, she allowed herself to imagine it—walking into a room without fear, without shame.

Because she would be untouchable.

And all it had cost her was her name.

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across Cresthaven as Alexander Whitmore leaned closer, his voice dripping with amusement.

"From this moment forward, whenever Ethan Caldwell sees you, he'll have to address you as 'Aunt Evelyn.'" His lips curved into a smirk. "You'll stroll through Cresthaven like you own it—because with me by your side, you practically do."

His fingers brushed against hers, sending an unexpected shiver down her spine.

"So, after everything I've just said, Evelyn… do you finally understand what I'm getting at?" His gaze darkened, intense and unreadable.

"You should be thinking about how to hold onto me for dear life."

A slow, dangerous smile played on his lips.

"While I still remember that you saved me, you'd better figure out how to make me yours completely."

Evelyn Carter blinked, her mind racing.

Why does Alexander sound exactly like Claire?

Earlier that day, after leaving the hospital, Claire Dawson had been relentless, whispering in her ear like a determined matchmaker.

"You have to find a way to make Alexander fall for you," she had insisted, her eyes gleaming with mischief. "That’s the only way you’ll secure your place as Mrs. Whitmore and take control of your own future."

Evelyn had nearly laughed out loud.

Make Alexander Whitmore fall for me? Seriously? We barely know each other!

But Claire had been adamant, dragging her into an upscale boutique and shoving two sets of scandalously expensive lingerie into her hands.

"If words fail, just seduce him," Claire had said with a wink. "Men are simple creatures—trust me, it works."

Evelyn's cheeks burned at the memory.

Now, standing so close to Alexander, she could feel the weight of his expectations—and the ridiculousness of Claire’s plan.

Yet, as his fingers lingered against hers, she couldn’t help but wonder…

What if it actually could work?

The more he can't live without you, the stronger your position becomes.

"And remember, you two are legally married! Abstaining? That's just ridiculous!"

"Look at Alexander—that face, that body. You'd be gaining everything by being with him!"

Evelyn had been completely stunned, clutching the scandalous lingerie Claire had picked out for her as she made her way home.

Now, hearing Alexander's words, an odd sense of familiarity washed over her.

She thought, But Claire was speaking as a friend. What about Alexander?

Evelyn found herself studying him, taking in the way he sprawled across the couch with effortless grace.

His tailored white shirt clung to his frame, the top buttons undone just enough to reveal a tempting glimpse of his collarbone.

Heat rushed to her cheeks, and she quickly looked away.

From the corner of her eye, she caught him adjusting his wristwatch—a simple motion, yet it carried an air of refined confidence.

Evelyn instinctively shut her eyes for a heartbeat, her pulse quickening.

Alexander noticed her distracted state and flicked her forehead lightly with his finger. "What's running through that brilliant mind of yours?"

"Nothing…" Evelyn nibbled her lower lip, fingers absently brushing the spot he'd touched.

"We'll arrange a proper introduction to my family at Whitmore Manor."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Whitmore Manor?"

That meant confronting Ethan Caldwell directly—as Alexander's wife.

Alexander gave a slow nod, his expression unreadable. "Our marriage may be private, but there's no reason to hide it from my family. Don’t you want to see Ethan’s face when he realizes you’re mine?"

"But I was the one who chased after him before. Won’t this be… uncomfortable for you?"

Alexander tilted his chin up, a smirk playing at his lips. "Why would it be? You did nothing wrong."

His voice dropped, firm and warm. "You’re stunning, intelligent, and more than enough. Hold your head high."

The unexpected praise sent warmth flooding through Evelyn’s chest.

She had always believed her history with Ethan Caldwell meant something profound. But to Alexander Whitmore, it was merely a passing footnote—something utterly insignificant.

A strange wave of tranquility washed over Evelyn Carter as she finally grasped how truly remarkable Alexander was.

Her thoughts raced. As a husband, he's emotionally grounded, radiating that irresistible aura of a seasoned man. His status gives me stability, making him appear flawless. It's almost surreal.

Yet the weight of reality pressed down on her. If I return home with him, everything will become impossibly tangled.

The realization left her breathless.

###Chapter 53 Midnight Confessions

The evening air was thick with tension as Evelyn leaned against the balcony railing. "Ethan and Vanessa are sleeping together," she confessed, her voice barely above a whisper. "The whole world believes they've betrayed me. But if I return to Whitmore Manor with you now, it'll only complicate things. They'll spin the narrative, claim we've been together all along to justify their actions. That would be catastrophic."

Alexander studied her carefully, his piercing gaze never leaving her face. "What do you propose, then?"

She exhaled slowly, her fingers tightening around the railing. "We wait. At least until after their wedding. Once Vanessa and Ethan are officially married, we can reveal the truth. By then, no one will be able to deny it."

The wedding was scheduled for the eighth of next month—barely four weeks away.

The thought of standing beside Alexander as his wife while they watched the fallout sent a thrill through her.

He considered her words, then gave a slow nod. "Clever. I agree."

Relief washed over her. "So, for now, we keep this between us. Understood… Mr. Whitmore?"

A smirk tugged at his lips as he stepped closer, his voice dropping to a husky murmur. "In public, you can call me that. But when we're alone? I expect something far more intimate, darling."

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson. "Well..."

As their conversation faded, a warm silence enveloped the room.

Their gazes held, the air thickening with unspoken tension.

Suddenly flustered, Evelyn snatched the nearest garment and bolted toward the bathroom.

"I—I need a shower. You can... make yourself comfortable."

She practically slammed the door behind her.

Alexander watched her retreat with an amused smirk.

The way she practically fled—

He'd bet his fortune she was blushing.

Under the spray of hot water, Evelyn's thoughts spiraled.

How was she supposed to survive this night with Alexander?

They were legally married. What was holding her back?

Claire's voice rang in her memory, urging her forward.

"Listen, Evie! Men are simple creatures—show initiative, and they'll worship the ground you walk on!"

"And Alexander? Twenty-nine years without a single scandal! You've hit the jackpot, darling!"

"Lucas says he's sculpted from years of intense training. Just picture how incredible his body must feel under your fingertips! You absolutely need to experience it firsthand!"

The moment these thoughts flooded her mind, Evelyn felt a wave of heat rush to her cheeks. The bathroom seemed to grow unbearably warm, the steam clinging to her skin.

She twisted the faucet, letting icy water pool in her palms before splashing it onto her flushed face. The cold shock helped—barely.

Then, her phone vibrated against the marble countertop.

Glancing down, she saw Claire's name lighting up the screen: [So, babe, need a crash course?]

Evelyn dried her damp fingers on the plush towel, hesitating before typing back: [Clueless.]

Claire's reply came instantly: [Hang tight. Sending you some educational material.]

Evelyn's breath hitched. Her entire face burned.

Leave it to Claire to go straight for the nuclear option.

The air in the bathroom thickened. Evelyn shut off the shower, wrapping herself in a fresh towel as if it could shield her from her own racing thoughts.

As she reached for her silk pajamas, her gaze drifted toward—

The delicate lace lingerie lay in Evelyn's hands—Claire's scandalous purchase from their shopping trip earlier.

There was absolutely no way she could step out wearing that.

Hesitating, Evelyn cracked the bathroom door open just enough to peek through.

"Alexander?" she called softly.

A moment later, she heard the muffled sound of his slippers against the hardwood floor.

His dark hair was still damp from his shower, tousled in a way that made him look effortlessly handsome. A towel hung loosely around his neck as he rubbed at his hair absently.

Alexander raised a brow, lips quirking in that infuriatingly amused way of his. "Need something?"

The way his gaze flickered toward the barely open door made her pulse jump.

She swallowed.

This was going to be a long night.
###Chapter 54 Sculpted Perfection

Alexander stood motionless, his bare torso gleaming under the soft bathroom light. A single towel hung precariously low on his hips, water droplets trailing down the ridges of his abs before vanishing beneath the fabric. The defined V-line leading downward made Evelyn’s breath hitch.

"Uh…" She swallowed hard, forcing her gaze away.

Her cheeks burned. "Could you pass me my pajamas? The white set?"

Instead of answering, Alexander smirked, clearly entertained by her reaction.

He strode toward the bedroom, returning moments later with the requested sleepwear in hand.

The bathroom door remained slightly open. Evelyn reached out, fingers brushing against the fabric, but Alexander didn’t let go. A silent tug-of-war ensued, the material caught between them.

Confused, she peeked through the gap.

Steam curled around them, wrapping the space in a hazy, intimate glow. The air thickened, charged with something unspoken.

His grip loosened just enough for her to pull the pajamas free, but not before his fingers grazed hers—deliberately, teasingly.

Evelyn’s pulse jumped.

The corner of his mouth lifted. "In a hurry?"

She yanked the door shut with more force than necessary.

Behind it, she could’ve sworn she heard him chuckle.

"What's happening?" Evelyn whispered, her voice trembling slightly.

"Mrs. Whitmore, you do enjoy playing games," Alexander murmured, his gaze lingering on the delicate curve of her ankle before he finally withdrew his hand.

Evelyn finally managed to grab the sleepwear. She hastily shut the bathroom door, his teasing words fading from her mind as she unfolded the fabric—only to freeze in shock.

This wasn’t the modest white nightgown she had expected.

Instead, it was one of the scandalous lace pieces Claire had pressured her into trying on.

The design was daring, with strategic cutouts that revealed far more than they concealed.

Heat flooded Evelyn’s cheeks as she stood there, mortified.

This can’t be real.

Frustration surged through her. She dragged her fingers through her damp hair, trying to steady herself. Enough was enough. Wrapping the towel securely around herself, she marched out.

Alexander’s eyes locked onto her the moment she stepped out. His gaze traveled over her bare shoulders, and she caught something dark flickering in his expression—desire?—deepening the flush on her skin.

Heart pounding, Evelyn spun around and bolted back into the room, slamming the door behind her.

My fingers trembled as I pulled on the silk nightgown, the fabric whispering against my skin.

Just as I let out a shaky breath, Alexander appeared in the doorway, his broad shoulders filling the frame. The intensity in his gaze made my pulse skip.

Desperate for distraction, I grabbed my phone—only for Claire’s voice to blare through the speaker, loud and unapologetic.

"Sorry, darling! Couldn’t find those educational videos I promised. But honestly? Just go for it. Alexander’s new to this too—take your time, explore, enjoy!"

Heat flooded my cheeks. I bit my lip hard enough to sting, unable to look up.

The next message played automatically. "And sweetheart? A man built like that? Pure. Natural. Disaster. Have fun!"

Dead silence.

My phone might as well have been a live grenade.

I swiped frantically to stop the playback, but my damp fingers betrayed me. The screen glitched, trapping me in this nightmare.

Claire’s shameless commentary was one thing.

Having Alexander hear every word?

An entirely different kind of torture.

The air between them crackled with tension as Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed.

"I—I was just getting water," she stammered, already pivoting toward the door, desperate to escape Alexander's smoldering presence.

Before she could take another step, his fingers closed around her wrist, spinning her back toward him.

He stood impossibly close, the heat of his bare torso radiating against her. The towel hung precariously low on his hips, every sculpted line of his abdomen demanding her attention.

Her breath hitched.

"Did I hear you correctly, Mrs. Whitmore?" Alexander's voice was a velvet rumble, laced with amusement. "You have a preference for a particular kind of physique?"

The scent of his shower gel—clean, masculine, intoxicating—wrapped around her. His gaze held hers, dark and knowing, and suddenly the room felt ten degrees hotter.

He captured her hands in his, his grip firm and unyielding.

She could feel the raw power in his touch, the strength coiled beneath his skin. A flush crept up her neck, burning her cheeks.

Evelyn tried to tug free, but Alexander didn’t relent.

His lips curved into a slow, devastating smile as he leaned in, his breath brushing her ear. "Well? Does my masculine perfection meet your standards, Mrs. Whitmore?"

Her knees nearly buckled.
###Chapter 55 The Perfect Distraction

Evelyn's words tumbled out in a rush. "Claire was only teasing, you mustn't—"

Her voice trailed off, swallowed by the tension thickening the air between them.

Without warning, Alexander closed the distance, his lips claiming hers in a searing kiss.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

His strong fingers tangled in her hair, tilting her head back as if she weighed nothing. The bustling world around them dissolved into silence—only the whisper of fabric and their ragged breaths remained.

The faintest hint of whiskey lingered on Alexander's tongue, intoxicating her senses.

A bolt of lightning shot through Evelyn's veins, making her fingers tremble.

His calloused palms slid down her waist, settling possessively against the small of her back. The contact sent delicious tremors racing along her spine.

Pressed against his solid frame, she felt fragile. Powerless.

Drowning in the heat of his touch, she didn’t dare breathe.

Just as the kiss deepened—

Alexander's phone buzzed violently between them.

The sharp ring of the phone shattered the moment like glass.

Alexander pulled back reluctantly, his forehead still pressed against Evelyn's. Their ragged breaths mingled in the charged silence, pulses thundering in sync.

After a long beat, he released her with obvious reluctance and strode to the table to answer the call.

Evelyn remained rooted in place, her lips tingling from the kiss. Her mind reeled, replaying every electrifying second while her heart refused to slow its frantic rhythm.

When Alexander returned, he was already shrugging into his dress shirt, his playful smirk replaced by a businesslike frown.

"Last-minute trip to Singapore. I'll be gone at least three days."

Evelyn's breath caught. She nodded quickly, springing into action as she hurried to their walk-in closet.

Her fingers flew through his wardrobe, selecting two Tom Ford suits for formal meetings and a Brioni for investor dinners. She paired each with silk ties in complementary hues.

Remembering his preference for comfort during flights, she added cashmere sweaters and tailored joggers, folding everything with military precision.

Alexander's eyebrows lifted when he saw the meticulously packed suitcase.

His expression softened as he caught her wrist, pulling her against his chest. "You're incredible," he murmured against her hair.

The scent of his cologne enveloped her as his fingers traced her jawline. "I'll miss this," he said hoarsely.

Evelyn's breath hitched when his thumb brushed her kiss-swollen lips. "The plane leaves in ninety minutes."

A wicked gleam returned to his eyes. "Then we'd better make these count."

His mouth crashed down on hers with renewed urgency as he backed her toward the bed—

The doorbell's chime froze them both mid-step.

Alexander growled in frustration while Evelyn bit back a laugh. "Your timing is impeccable," she told the unseen visitor.

He gave her one last searing kiss before releasing her. "This isn't over," he promised darkly.

As Evelyn straightened her blouse, she noticed the unfamiliar number flashing on Alexander's phone screen. Singapore's country code.

Her stomach dropped.

Business trips never started with midnight calls.

Alexander nuzzled into Evelyn's fragrant hair, his voice dropping to a husky whisper. "No browsing those steamy romance novels while I'm away, understood?"

Evelyn pressed closer to his chest, her reply barely audible. "I wasn't even considering it..."

A smirk played on Alexander's lips as his throat moved visibly. "If curiosity gets the better of you, just wait for me. We'll... investigate those scenes together."

Evelyn's pulse spiked at his implication.

Did he mean what I think he meant?

Investigating together?

Before she could process it further, his phone buzzed again—sharp, insistent.

She watched him stride out, the door clicking shut behind him, leaving her torn between anticipation and flustered embarrassment.

The moment she was alone, she hurried back to her bedroom on tiptoe.

The second her head hit the pillow, memories of their kiss consumed her—the heat of his mouth, the way his body had pinned hers. She yanked the blanket over her head, cheeks burning, and let out a muffled groan.

Her fingers twitched with the urge to smack her own face.

Why did he have to say it like that?

Now I can’t stop imagining it.

Her mind raced. "If that call hadn't interrupted us... what would have happened next?"

And the way his body had felt against hers... that low, teasing question—Was I satisfied?

Seriously?

This was the same Alexander Whitmore people whispered about—cold, controlled, untouchable? Since when had he become so... dangerously flirtatious?

Was it just with her? Or had he always been like this beneath that polished exterior?

Sleep refused to come. Evelyn twisted in her sheets, phantom touches burning across her skin until exhaustion dragged her under near dawn.

Meanwhile, thirty thousand feet in the air, Alexander stared blankly at the business magazine in his lap. The same page had been open for fifty-three minutes.

He reclined his seat, shutting his eyes. The memory of Lucas's voice echoed from last night's whiskey-fueled conversation.

"For God's sake, man, just take what's yours!" Lucas had slammed his glass down, ice clinking. "You're legally bound to her now—what's holding you back?"

A smirk curled Alexander's lips.

"That body of yours is a weapon. Flex it. Let her see what she's been missing." Lucas had gestured wildly. "And that face? Christ. Use it."

The plane hummed around him.

Alexander's fingers tapped against the armrest.

Oh, he intended to.

Alexander could charm a dozen women like Evelyn without even trying!

"Wait, Alex, don't leave yet!"

Ignoring Lucas, Alexander casually picked up his suit jacket from the couch and shrugged it on.

Lucas, undeterred, kept up his relentless persuasion.

"Alex, believe me! I'm betting our twenty-five years of friendship on this!"

"Just walk by her in nothing but a towel, and Evelyn won’t know what hit her. I guarantee it!"

Alexander said nothing, merely adjusting his jacket before stepping out of the lounge.

The memory of Evelyn’s reaction tonight played in his mind, and his lips curved into a smirk.

A wicked grin spread across his face as he thought, Looks like Lucas’s ridiculous plan actually worked.
###Chapter 56 Who Do You Think You Are?

Evelyn had stayed up late the previous night and was catching up on sleep in the early hours of the morning.

Her phone buzzed insistently, shattering the quiet of her rest.

With a groan, she reached for it, squinting against the harsh light of the screen.

Margaret's voice was sharp on the other end. "Where have you been disappearing to lately?"

Evelyn exhaled, her voice thick with sleep. "Since I'm married now, obviously I'm living with my husband."

The Hayes family had never taken her claims seriously.

Margaret scoffed. "Evelyn is obsessed with Ethan. She wouldn't just marry someone else. I need to make sure she doesn’t cause a scene when she hears about Ethan and Vanessa’s wedding. The date’s already set. If she starts another fight, it’ll ruin everything. I have to talk some sense into her."

She didn’t have the patience to argue. "Come home. I bought you some new outfits."

Evelyn blinked, momentarily stunned. Margaret never buys me clothes.

A beat of silence stretched between them.

Then, suspicion crept in.

What’s her angle this time?

She sat up slowly, the sheets pooling around her waist. "Why?"

Margaret’s tone shifted, suddenly lighter. "Can’t a mother do something nice for her daughter?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the phone.

Nice? Since when?

She knew better.

There was always a catch.

Her lips curved into a humorless smile. "Fine. I’ll come by later."

She hung up before Margaret could say more.

The room felt colder now, the weight of unspoken schemes pressing down on her.

She exhaled sharply.

Whatever it is, I’m not playing along.

Not this time.

Not ever again.

The morning sun filtered through the curtains as Evelyn sat at the dining table, picking at her breakfast. She couldn’t shake the lingering warmth of last night from her mind.

Just as she stepped out, her phone buzzed. Claire’s voice crackled through the line, playful and teasing. "So? How was it? Did Alexander live up to his reputation? Or were you too exhausted to move this morning?"

Evelyn’s cheeks burned. She twirled a strand of hair around her finger, hesitating before answering. "We didn’t… sleep. He left for a business trip. Won’t be back for a week."

Claire groaned dramatically. "You should’ve booked a flight and gone with him! What’s wrong with you? A man like Alexander Whitmore doesn’t come around often. You can’t just let him walk away like that!"

Evelyn’s fingers tingled at the memory—the way his muscles had tensed under her touch, the heat of his skin beneath her fingertips. She swallowed hard, forcing herself to focus.

"What about you?" she asked, steering the conversation away. "Have you told Lucas about the baby yet?"

Claire’s tone darkened. "No. He’s ignoring my calls. Again." She exhaled sharply. "But it’s fine. I still have time."

Evelyn murmured in agreement, though worry gnawed at her. Before she could say more, the car rolled to a stop in front of Hawthorne Estate.

The grand gates loomed ahead, but Evelyn’s thoughts were still tangled in the past night—and the man who had left her wanting more.

Evelyn ended the call and stepped out of the car.

The Hawthorne Estate was unusually crowded today. The grand living room buzzed with relatives, their voices filling the air until the moment Evelyn walked in.

A servant had just set down a tray of fresh fruit when the conversations abruptly ceased. The cheerful atmosphere turned icy in an instant.

Vanessa had been preoccupied with wedding preparations lately, having taken leave from work. Nothing mattered more than securing her place in the Caldwell family.

Beneath her expertly applied makeup, faint traces of Eleanor’s slap still lingered. But Vanessa had made sure no one in the family knew about the hospital incident—some secrets were best kept buried.

Spotting Evelyn, Vanessa forced a smile. "You're back."

Evelyn barely spared her a glance before turning away.

She settled onto the sofa and picked up a slice of fruit from the tray, ignoring the tension thickening the room.

Margaret’s lips pursed in disapproval. "What’s wrong with you? Vanessa was speaking to you, and you didn’t even acknowledge her. No greeting, no respect—who do you think you are?"

Margaret Hayes frowned, watching her daughter with growing irritation. Ethan and Vanessa are about to marry. I expected Evelyn to be upset. Even though she wasn’t raised by me, she’s still my flesh and blood. I even bought her two designer dresses to make up for it. But she’s so stubborn—nothing like Vanessa.

"I am the eldest daughter of the Hayes family," Evelyn said coolly, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "Got a problem with that?"

Margaret’s temper flared. "You—!"

Vanessa, ever the peacemaker, stepped between them with practiced ease. "Evelyn, Mom’s been exhausted lately. Don’t upset her further. She picked these out just for you—why don’t you try them on?"

She slid a glossy shopping bag across the table toward Evelyn.

Inside were two dresses from Radiant’s latest collection—elegant, expensive, the kind of luxury the Hayes family never hesitated to indulge in.

Evelyn barely spared them a glance before pushing the bag back. "Return them. I don’t want anything from you."

Her voice was ice.

Margaret’s hands clenched.

Vanessa sighed.

And Evelyn?

She turned and walked away without another word.

###Chapter 57 My Visit to Titan Capital Group

Evelyn frowned at the pile of dresses. "These won't fit me. I used to wear a size S, but I've lost weight since then. A size M would drown me. And since Margaret bought these for Vanessa, they'll probably hang off me like oversized nightgowns."

Margaret's face twisted in outrage. "Ungrateful brat!" she snapped, snatching the shopping bag and hurling it into the trash with unnecessary force.

Evelyn barely flinched. She settled onto the sofa, picking at a bowl of fresh fruit with deliberate calm. Margaret's tantrums didn't faze her anymore.

Vanessa sighed, shaking her head in exaggerated disappointment. "Evelyn, if you have issues with me, take it up with me directly. No need to upset Mom. Why don’t you stay for lunch? Maybe you two can finally talk things out."

She gestured to the staff, ordering an extra place setting with the practiced ease of someone who considered herself the lady of the house.

Margaret, remembering the real reason they'd summoned Evelyn today, forced a tight smile.

The words came out cold and calculated. "Vanessa and Ethan are getting married next month." Margaret Hayes tapped her manicured nails against the armrest. "The invitations have already been sent. There’s no changing this. Stop embarrassing yourself over Ethan Caldwell."

To her surprise, Evelyn Carter simply nodded. "Fine."

Margaret blinked, caught off guard by the immediate agreement.

A smug satisfaction curled her lips. "Good. We’ll find you another match, of course. It won’t be as prestigious as the Caldwells, but—"

"Don’t bother." Evelyn cut her off.

Let them keep believing I’m single. A secret thrill ran through her. When Alexander and I reveal the truth, it’ll be so much sweeter.

"I’m focusing on my career," Evelyn stated.

Margaret’s expression froze. "Career?"

Originally, the Hayes family had planned for Evelyn to train at Horizon Enterprises after graduation.

But after that incident three years ago, Vanessa had climbed the corporate ladder effortlessly—now on the verge of becoming deputy manager of the project division.

Evelyn had been left behind.

Yet here she was, calm, composed.

Margaret narrowed her eyes. "And where exactly do you plan to work?"

Evelyn met her gaze evenly. "Titan Capital Group."

Silence.

Then, a disbelieving laugh. "You? At Titan?" Margaret scoffed. "Do you even know who runs that company?"

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Oh, I know."

Very, very well.

The sun cast long shadows across the hardwood floor as Evelyn Carter sat at the dining table, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup. With no prior work experience, finding a respectable job seemed nearly impossible.

Richard Hayes folded his newspaper and set it aside. "You majored in Business Administration," he said, his voice calm but firm. "Since you're eager to start working, you can join Horizon Enterprises. Vanessa is being promoted soon and will need an assistant. You can support her."

Horizon Enterprises was Richard’s company. Years ago, when Evelyn’s grandfather, William Hayes, passed away, his will had transferred half of his shares to her. Now, Evelyn was one of the three largest shareholders.

Vanessa Hart crossed her legs elegantly as she settled onto the sofa, smoothing her skirt. "In that case, I’ll have HR take down the job posting," she said, her tone light but edged with something sharper. "Originally, I required at least a master’s degree for the position. But since we’re sisters, Evelyn, I won’t hold you to that standard."

Richard sighed, rubbing his temple. "Evelyn does have a double degree in Business and Design, but her undergraduate qualification is… limiting."

Evelyn wiped her fingers with a napkin, her voice steady but quiet. "I’m not joining Horizon Enterprises."

Vanessa’s perfectly arched brows lifted. "Why not?" she asked, feigning surprise. "Horizon is one of the top firms in the industry. People fight tooth and nail just to get an interview. Are you… embarrassed because of your education?"

The air in the room thickened. Evelyn met Vanessa’s gaze evenly. "No," she said. "I have other plans."

Vanessa leaned forward slightly, her smile tight. "Oh? And what would those be?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of her coffee before answering. "I plan to go to Titan Capital Group."

Silence.

Richard frowned. "Titan Capital? That’s—"

"Alexander Whitmore’s company," Vanessa finished, her voice icy.

Evelyn set her cup down with deliberate calm. "Exactly."

Vanessa’s lips pressed into a thin line. Richard exhaled heavily, his expression unreadable.

The tension was palpable.

Evelyn stood, smoothing her blouse. "I’ll handle my own career path. Thank you for the offer."

Without another word, she walked out, leaving them in stunned silence.

Vanessa’s fingers curled into the fabric of the sofa.

This wasn’t over.

The sun cast long shadows across the hardwood floors of Hawthorne Estate as Evelyn Carter stood by the window, her fingers tracing the edge of the admission letter she had received three years ago. A master’s degree—her dream, shattered by one cruel twist of fate.

Vanessa Hart blinked, her perfectly manicured nails tapping against her teacup. "I don’t understand," she murmured, tilting her head. "Why would you refuse Horizon Enterprises? It’s the best opportunity you’ll ever get."

Margaret Hayes let out an exasperated sigh, her sharp gaze cutting through the tension in the room. "Is the assistant position beneath you?" she snapped. "You have no experience, Evelyn. You can’t afford to be this picky."

Vanessa pressed her lips together, then added in a saccharine whisper, "I had a master’s degree when I started at Horizon, and I still had to work my way up. Maybe Evelyn expects to waltz in as CEO."

Richard Hayes’ expression darkened instantly. His voice was ice. "Evelyn, I’m not handing this company over to you. If I did, it would collapse within a week. Stop dreaming beyond your station."

Evelyn didn’t flinch. She lowered her lashes, her voice steady. "I only have a bachelor’s degree. My qualifications aren’t enough for Horizon Enterprises." She paused, then met their stares head-on. "So I’ve decided to join Titan Capital Group instead."

Silence.

Vanessa’s teacup clattered against its saucer. Margaret’s mouth parted in disbelief. Richard’s jaw tightened.

Titan Capital Group—Alexander Whitmore’s empire.

And just like that, the game had changed.

###Chapter 58 See You Tomorrow

Vanessa's words instantly silenced the room.

Titan Capital Group was legendary in the corporate world—not just for its competitive salaries, but for its unparalleled employee benefits. While other companies exploited their staff with endless overtime, Titan Capital Group valued work-life balance. Their reputation attracted top-tier talent, with PhDs and Ivy League graduates fighting tooth and nail for a chance to join.

No wonder they were skeptical when Evelyn, a mere undergraduate, claimed she was headed there.

Margaret scoffed. "Did I not just warn you about unrealistic dreams? Titan Capital Group? Do you honestly think they'd hire someone like you?"

Evelyn lowered her lashes, shadowing her determined gaze. "Their hiring process doesn’t prioritize degrees. It’s about skill. And I already have the offer."

Richard frowned. He knew better than anyone how rigorous Titan Capital’s recruitment was. Horizon Enterprises had been a stretch—how could she possibly land a position at the industry’s most elite firm?

Vanessa clearly shared his disbelief. She stifled a laugh behind her hand. "Evelyn, darling, you can’t seriously expect us to believe Titan Capital offered you—"

The doorbell rang.

A courier stood outside, holding an embossed envelope. "Delivery for Ms. Evelyn Carter."

Evelyn accepted it, her fingers steady as she unfolded the crisp letterhead.

TITAN CAPITAL GROUP
OFFICIAL EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

Vanessa’s smile froze.

Richard’s jaw tightened.

Margaret’s breath hitched.

Evelyn met their stunned silence with a quiet smile. "See you tomorrow."

She turned and walked out, leaving them gaping in her wake.

Titan Capital Group? How did you get this?"

Margaret Hayes frowned. Evelyn had only been released from prison days ago. With her criminal record, she wouldn't pass Titan Capital's rigorous background check. Their HR department was notoriously strict—no way they'd hire an ex-convict.

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

The fruit she'd eaten earlier had been too sweet, leaving her parched. A servant handed her a steaming cup of coffee.

She took a slow sip before answering, "Titan Capital's HR department gave it to me directly."

"Ridiculous!" Margaret scoffed, unable to contain her disbelief. "Three years in prison, and you still haven't learned honesty? Look at yourself. Horizon Enterprises wouldn’t touch you—why would Titan Capital?"

Vanessa Hart, standing nearby, quickly passed Margaret another cup. "Mother, don’t upset yourself. Maybe Evelyn begged Ethan for help. Or perhaps she’s trying to worm her way back into his life through the company."

Everyone in Cresthaven knew Titan Capital belonged to the Caldwell family.

Each member held key positions there.

Alexander Whitmore was CEO. Ethan Caldwell headed marketing.

If Evelyn truly sought Ethan's assistance, he might actually create a position for her out of lingering sentiment for their past relationship.

Margaret scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "I know exactly why she wants to join Titan Capital Group—she still hasn't let go of Ethan. Evelyn, I warned you to stop causing trouble. Ethan is about to become Vanessa's husband. Why can't you just move on?"

Evelyn remained composed, her expression unreadable. "Yes, he will be Vanessa's husband soon."

Internally, she rolled her eyes. Ethan means nothing to me now. Alexander is my husband.

Not a single member of the Hayes family believed Evelyn had any real intention of joining Titan Capital Group.

Lunch continued in tense silence, each person lost in their own thoughts. Midway through the meal, Evelyn's phone buzzed sharply against the table.

An unknown number flashed on the screen. Without hesitation, she declined the call.

Thirty seconds later, the phone rang again.

Vanessa arched a brow, her tone laced with false concern. "Aren't you going to answer? Or is it something you'd rather keep private?"

Evelyn didn't glance up, her gloved hands deftly peeling a shrimp. She had been meticulously watching her diet lately, determined to regain her strength—and her confidence.

The phone vibrated once more, insistent.

This time, she wiped her fingers clean and swiped to answer, her voice cool. "Hello?"

A deep, unfamiliar voice responded. "Ms. Carter? This is Daniel Pierce from Titan Capital Group. Regarding your application—"

Evelyn's pulse stuttered.

Vanessa's fork clattered against her plate, her eyes narrowing.

Margaret froze mid-bite.

The room seemed to hold its breath.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her grip tightening on the phone.

So it begins.

The golden afternoon light streamed through the windows of the Hawthorne Estate, casting long shadows across the marble floors. Evelyn Carter stood by the full-length mirror, adjusting the belt of her dress to accentuate her waist. She wanted to look impeccable—every detail mattered now.

Before Vanessa Hart could utter a word, Margaret Hayes snatched the ringing phone from the coffee table and tapped the speaker button without hesitation.

A deep, velvety voice resonated through the room. "Hello, is this Ms. Hart?"

Evelyn’s fingers stilled on the fabric of her dress. Margaret’s lips pursed in disapproval, her sharp gaze flickering toward Evelyn as if she had already drawn her own conclusions.

"Yes, this is she," Vanessa answered smoothly, though her fingers tightened around the phone.

"I’m Gregory Shaw, HR Director at Titan Capital Group. Did you receive the offer we sent via email?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "I did."

"Any concerns about the compensation package?"

"None."

"Then we’ll expect you tomorrow at nine sharp?"

"I’ll be there."

"Perfect. See you then."

The call ended, leaving a heavy silence in its wake. The air thickened with unspoken questions. Margaret’s eyes narrowed, Vanessa’s fingers drummed against the armrest, and Evelyn simply stood there—her reflection in the mirror now holding the faintest trace of a smile.

Tomorrow couldn’t come soon enough.
###Chapter 59 Corporate Deception

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Vanessa, where did you dig up some random guy to pretend for you? Do you seriously think Titan Capital Group would want you? This is ridiculous."

She remained silent, popping a freshly peeled shrimp into her mouth and chewing slowly.

Richard looked stunned. He hadn’t expected such an elaborate act. "You actually hired someone to play along? How much did that cost you?"

Still, Evelyn said nothing, methodically working through her plate of seafood.

Vanessa was scrolling through the call log on Evelyn’s phone when her expression abruptly shifted.

The number displayed was a landline with the prefix 888—a sequence exclusively used by Titan Capital Group in Cresthaven.

She recognized it instantly. Ethan had called her from that very number before.

"This is Titan Capital’s direct line." Vanessa’s grip on her fork tightened, knuckles whitening. "Did you actually go to Ethan for help? Evelyn, we’re engaged. Why can’t you leave him alone?"

Vanessa's words ended in a choked sob.

She didn't even wait to finish her meal. Covering her face with trembling hands, she fled to her room and slammed the door shut behind her.

Margaret immediately rushed after her, concern etching deep lines across her forehead. But after a few steps, she paused, turning back to glare at Evelyn with barely contained fury. "You made Vanessa cry. Didn't you swear to me you'd stay away from Ethan?"

Evelyn peeled off her gloves with deliberate slowness, her expression unreadable. She dabbed her fingers with a damp cloth before responding, her voice cool. "I'm simply going to work. Who told you I'm joining Titan Capital Group for Ethan?"

There was something in Evelyn's tone—a sharp, unflinching honesty—that made Margaret hesitate. After a tense silence, she finally turned away, following Vanessa upstairs.

Now, only Evelyn and Richard remained in the dining room.

Of everyone, Richard had taken the news of Evelyn's employment at Titan Capital Group the most calmly.

The truth was, Titan Capital was an industry titan. He'd spent years trying to forge connections with them, to no avail. Even with Vanessa and Ethan's engagement, no business opportunities had materialized.

The reason was simple: Alexander Whitmore, Titan Capital's CEO, was notoriously uncompromising. He didn’t play favorites—not even for family.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her gaze drifting toward the window. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the polished floor, mirroring the tension in the room.

Richard finally spoke, his voice measured. "You're sure about this?"

Evelyn met his eyes, unflinching. "I don’t have a choice."

A beat passed. Then Richard nodded, as if he understood more than she’d said.

Neither of them mentioned the unspoken truth—that this decision would change everything.

Richard Hayes set down his wine glass with deliberate slowness. His cold gaze fixed on Evelyn Carter across the table. "Now that you're inside Titan Capital Group, things might finally change."

He didn’t bother with pleasantries. "Evelyn, I don’t care how you managed to get into Titan Capital. But remember—you’re still a Hayes, and a shareholder of Horizon Enterprises. Your loyalty should lie with our company first."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her fork. "What exactly are you implying?"

Ever since Richard had struck her on her birthday, she had stopped calling him "Father." The word tasted bitter now.

Richard’s expression darkened. "Vanessa has a project that Titan Capital rejected. You will find a way to access their internal files and secure it for us. Once it’s done, you’ll be compensated. You’ve held shares in Horizon for years without seeing a single dividend. Get this project, and that changes—starting this quarter."

A humorless laugh escaped Evelyn’s lips.

She thought bitterly, Grandfather William left those shares to Oliver and me—equal parts, no stake for Richard, Margaret, or Vanessa. Because of that, I’m one of the top three shareholders in Horizon. Richard may hold 10%, but Oliver and I match him.

The irony wasn’t lost on her. They wanted her to betray her new employer while dangling the dividends she was already owed.

Her silence stretched. Richard’s patience thinned. "Well?"

Evelyn met his gaze. "And if I refuse?"

His smile was razor-sharp. "Then you’ll learn exactly how powerless those shares make you."

The unspoken threat hung between them.

Evelyn pushed her plate away, appetite gone.

She had walked into Titan Capital for her own reasons.

But Richard Hayes had just drawn the battle lines.

The sun cast long shadows across the polished conference table as Evelyn Carter clenched her fists beneath it.

Horizon Enterprises had thrived in recent years. Shareholders received their quarterly dividends like clockwork—everyone except her.

Richard Hayes had made sure of that.

"Three years," Evelyn said, her voice dangerously calm. "Three years of my dividends, handed to Vanessa Hart. Because you think I owe her for what happened."

Richard didn’t flinch. His expression remained unreadable, but the tension in the room thickened.

Then came the proposition.

Evelyn turned sharply, her gaze locking onto his. "Let me get this straight. You want me to infiltrate Titan Capital Group? To spy for you?" A bitter laugh escaped her. "That’s not just unethical—it’s corporate espionage. Do you honestly expect me to risk prison for this?"

Silence stretched between them.

Richard finally leaned forward, his voice low. "It’s not just about the money, Evelyn. It’s about leverage. And you’re the only one who can get close enough."

Her pulse spiked.

The unspoken threat hung in the air—if she refused, what else would he take from her?

But if she agreed…

She’d be playing a dangerous game. One wrong move, and Alexander Whitmore would see right through her.

And then?

There would be no coming back.
###Chapter 60 The Unwanted Daughter

Nathan frowned. "This is mutually beneficial."

"If there are so many advantages, why doesn’t Titan Capital Group sign the contract with Horizon Enterprises directly? Why resort to using me as a pawn?" Evelyn countered sharply.

Her lips curled in mockery. "Isn’t Vanessa engaged to Ethan? He’s the marketing director of Titan Capital. You could’ve asked Vanessa to convince him. It’s just one contract. If she can’t even secure that for you, what’s the point of raising her? She’s not even your real daughter."

Nathan thought bitterly, If Vanessa could handle this, I wouldn’t be begging Evelyn for help. Alexander had rejected the proposal without explanation. Vanessa claimed Ethan had approached Alexander multiple times, only to be turned down every single instance.

Nathan exhaled in frustration. "Forget it. If Ethan failed, I doubt you’d succeed either. I’ll find another way."

The conversation died there. But Evelyn’s mind lingered on the quarterly dividends that always ended up in Vanessa’s account.

She studied Nathan with feigned indifference. "Starting this quarter, Horizon Enterprises’ dividends should be deposited—"

The documents slid across the polished mahogany desk. "Transfer all my dividends into my account."

Richard Hayes stiffened. His brows knitted together in displeasure. "You owe Vanessa. How dare you demand this?"

Evelyn Carter let out a bitter laugh. "You keep insisting I owe Vanessa, but tell me—what exactly do I owe her? Three years ago, she set me up. I made the truth clear at the birthday gala. You chose not to believe me. Three years of my life, wasted behind bars. You, Mother, Vanessa—you all owe me!" Her voice sharpened. "Even if I had been guilty of what happened back then, Vanessa walked away without a scratch. Not a single hair harmed. What compensation does she deserve?"

Richard fell silent, caught off guard by her words. His tone turned icy. "Vanessa has dedicated herself to this company. She's earned those dividends. You? You've contributed nothing. Yet you have the audacity to demand them."

Evelyn's lips curled in disdain. "You're right. I haven't contributed—but those shares are mine. Vanessa holds none. If she's so deserving, why don't you hand over your own profits to her?" Her eyes flashed with accusation. "Instead, you want to take from me. How hypocritical."

Richard's jaw tightened. "Vanessa needs the funds. She's about to be promoted to Vice President of the project division. There are social obligations—networking, events—all requiring financial backing. You barely spend a dime. And we're family. Why must you be so petty about this?"

Evelyn threw her head back and laughed, the sound hollow. "Family? You call this family?" Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "When have any of you ever treated me as such?"

The air between them crackled with tension, the weight of years of neglect pressing down.

Richard's expression darkened, but Evelyn didn't flinch. She had nothing left to lose.

And this time, she wouldn't back down.

The moment the words left my lips, Richard's face turned crimson with rage.

"You think you can dictate terms to me?" His fist crashed against the mahogany desk, making the crystal paperweight tremble. "After everything I've done for you?"

I smoothed the wrinkles from my designer dress, my voice icy calm. "Starting this fiscal quarter, every cent of my Horizon Enterprises dividends goes directly to my account. No exceptions."

The air between us crackled with tension.

Vanessa's shadow loomed large in this conversation, as always. My so-called father would sooner bankrupt himself than see his precious stepdaughter go without her monthly allowances.

"As a principal shareholder," I continued, "I'll be auditing the company books personally. If I discover even a dollar missing..." My smile didn't reach my eyes. "Well, let's just say the business journals will have a field day with 'Haynes vs. Horizon Enterprises.'"

Richard's nostrils flared. "How dare you threaten me? I'm your father!"

The word tasted like ash in my mouth.

"Tell me, Richard," I challenged, "when have you ever acted like one?"

The memory surfaced unbidden - that sweltering summer at Malibu, the riptide pulling us under. Vanessa, secure in her inflatable ring, shrieking theatrically while I swallowed mouthfuls of saltwater.

I could still see them - Richard and Margaret - sprinting past my flailing arms without hesitation. The lifeguard's strong grip hauling me to safety while my "family" fussed over Vanessa's nonexistent injuries.

Vanessa, who'd been laughing underwater the whole time.

The office walls seemed to press closer, the framed diplomas and awards mocking me. All the accolades in the world couldn't buy a parent's love.

"Sign the transfer documents by Friday," I said, turning toward the door. "Or my lawyers will be in touch."

The heavy oak door slammed behind me with finality. Some relationships weren't worth salvaging.

The ocean tasted bitter that day.

As the waves swallowed me whole, I felt nature's raw power coursing through my veins. The salt burned my throat, the current dragged me under, and in that moment, I understood—I was insignificant.

After that, I never stepped foot on a beach again.

Even swimming pools made my breath hitch.

When danger strikes, people reveal their true selves.

And that day, I learned the truth.

I was the unwanted one.

The memory flickered behind my eyes, sharp as shattered glass.

Evelyn's lips curled into a humorless smile.

The kind that held no warmth.

Only resignation.

###Chapter 61 Sweet Poison

Nathan and Margaret were locked in a heated debate over the company's profit distribution.

Upstairs, Evelyn had just managed to calm Vanessa after an emotional breakdown.

Vanessa twisted her fingers nervously, her voice barely above a whisper. "Mom... do you think Evelyn took that position at Titan Capital Group just to get close to Ethan?"

Margaret hesitated, choosing her words carefully. She reached out to smooth Vanessa's hair. "Darling, you and Ethan are engaged. Evelyn can't possibly come between you now."

Truthfully, Margaret believed Evelyn had brought this mess upon herself.

"You've suffered enough because of this situation," Margaret murmured, her heart aching for her daughter.

Her thoughts raced. Vanessa grew up sheltered, so trusting. Not only was her reputation tarnished by this scandal, but she also had to bear the consequences of Evelyn's mistakes. She could have had a perfect engagement, but instead, she's paying for her stepsister's poor choices. Ethan is exceptional in every way, but he was Evelyn's first. And yet Vanessa never complains—she endures everything for this family's sake.

Vanessa sniffled, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. "I just... I don’t understand why she had to come back now."

Margaret pulled her into a tight embrace. "Some people can't let go of the past, sweetheart. But you? You’re stronger than that."

Downstairs, the argument grew louder.

Vanessa flinched at the raised voices. "Do you think Dad will side with her again?"

Margaret’s grip tightened slightly. "Not this time."

A tense silence settled between them, broken only by the distant sound of shattering glass—likely Nathan slamming something in frustration.

Vanessa exhaled shakily. "I just want this to be over."

Margaret kissed her forehead. "It will be. And when it is, you’ll have everything you deserve."

Somewhere in the house, a door slammed shut.

The storm was far from over.

Margaret sighed softly, running her fingers through Vanessa's hair. "Don't worry, darling. I'll arrange a match for Evelyn so she can move on from Ethan. You just focus on your wedding preparations. Right now, that’s what matters most."

After leaving Hawthorne Estate, Evelyn checked the offer from Titan Capital Group.

The email had arrived that morning. She had been job hunting for days, submitting countless resumes online.

But before she could even attend the interview, the offer had landed in her inbox.

Evelyn suspected Alexander’s hand in this.

With that thought, she pulled out her phone and sent him a quick message.

Meanwhile, in a sleek corporate skyscraper overseas, the boardroom hummed with quiet intensity.

Executives in tailored suits lined both sides of the long conference table, pens poised over notepads.

A foreign executive stood at the front, gesturing toward the projection screen as he spoke.

Every word was absorbed in silence, broken only by the occasional scratch of pens against paper.

The conference room was filled with tension as executives stole furtive glances at Alexander Whitmore's expression. He occupied the front row, his presence commanding the space effortlessly.

Dressed in a charcoal-gray suit tailored to perfection, Alexander exuded an air of quiet dominance. The fine fabric accentuated his broad shoulders and lean frame, every stitch a testament to luxury. A sleek silver pen twirled absently between his long fingers.

Leaning back slightly in the plush leather chair, he radiated authority without uttering a word. His posture was relaxed yet poised, every movement deliberate—like a predator at ease, yet always aware.

The room held its breath. His sharp features were unreadable, his piercing gaze fixed ahead. To the onlookers, he was an enigma wrapped in power—cold, untouchable.

Rumors swirled about him. For over two decades, Alexander had moved through high society like a shadow, his name whispered but rarely seen.

Then, a year ago, he emerged from obscurity to seize control of Titan Capital Group with ruthless precision. His rise was meteoric, his methods flawless.

Yet now, the man who commanded boardrooms with a single glance was distracted. His attention had shifted to the phone resting on the polished mahogany table.

Nineteen hours, forty-eight minutes, and thirty-two seconds.

That was how long it had been since he last saw Evelyn.

What was she doing right now?

The thought made his jaw tighten imperceptibly.

The executive presenting froze mid-sentence, noticing the subtle shift in Alexander's expression. A flicker of unease passed through the room.

Had they said something wrong?

But Alexander wasn’t listening.

His mind was elsewhere—with her.

The air in the boardroom was thick with tension.

Ethan Caldwell frowned at his presentation, convinced something was off. His fingers hovered over the keyboard, hesitating.

A bead of cold sweat trickled down his temple. He wiped it away discreetly, forcing himself to focus.

Then, Alexander Whitmore’s phone buzzed.

The moment he glanced at the screen, an uncharacteristic smile curved his lips.

All eyes turned toward him.

Without missing a beat, Alexander gestured for the meeting to continue. His expression smoothed back into its usual indifference as he unlocked his phone.

A message from Evelyn Carter lit up the screen:

[Mr. Whitmore, when will you be back?]

Alexander’s brow arched. His fingers moved swiftly.

[Mr. Whitmore?]

On the other end, Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Her pulse quickened.

Did I upset him? Claire warned me—I have to keep him happy.

She swallowed hard, then pressed the voice message button.

Back in the boardroom, Alexander tapped the audio file.

Evelyn’s voice, soft and honeyed, filled the silent room:

[Sweetheart.]
###Chapter 62 Say My Name 100 Times

Evelyn's voice dripped with honeyed sweetness. It reminded Alexander of a pampered Persian cat stretching lazily on a sunlit windowsill, purring contentedly without a care in the world.

A simple greeting, yet it carried an intoxicating allure.

Every executive in the boardroom froze, their eyes widening in shock.

Though this meeting took place overseas with mostly international attendees, several high-ranking officials had been dispatched from Horizon Enterprises' global headquarters.

Their gazes snapped toward Alexander in disbelief. To them, he was the epitome of professionalism—unyielding, composed, and utterly unapproachable.

What in the world? Mr. Whitmore has a lover? And she just called him 'honey'?

Everyone knew Alexander was a man of discipline, one who had maintained an impenetrable distance from women for years. Even at high-society galas, he never entertained flirtations or drank with female companions.

Yet here he was—his usual icy demeanor melting into a rare, indulgent smile simply because of that one word whispered through the phone.

Is Mr. Whitmore... smirking?

The executives exchanged stunned glances.

Alexander, completely unfazed by their reactions, leaned back in his chair, his voice dropping to a velvety murmur.

"Say it again."

A beat of silence.

Then, Evelyn's playful laughter trickled through the speaker, light and teasing.

"Make me."

The air in the room grew heavier.

Alexander's fingers tightened imperceptibly around his phone. His gaze darkened, a dangerous edge creeping into his tone.

"Careful, darling. You're playing with fire."

A soft gasp.

Then—

"Alexander..."

His name rolled off her tongue like a sinful confession, sending a jolt of electricity down his spine.

The executives collectively held their breath.

This was not the Alexander Whitmore they knew.

This man—his voice rough with barely restrained desire, his eyes burning with possessive intensity—was someone entirely different.

Someone utterly, irrevocably claimed.

The air in the conference room turned electric.

Evelyn's honeyed voice had just echoed through the speakers, dripping with playful affection. "Call me honey 100 times like in the honeymoon period."

Every head in the room swiveled toward Alexander Whitmore.

He didn’t flinch.

Alexander hadn’t anticipated his phone connecting to the conference room’s Bluetooth. Nor had he expected Evelyn’s message to broadcast so clearly.

But he was a man who thrived under scrutiny.

Maintaining his composure, he typed a reply: [Mrs. Whitmore, you’ve just shattered my professional reputation.]

Evelyn’s response was immediate. [What?]

His fingers moved swiftly. [Your voice just serenaded the entire boardroom.]

Her cheeks burned.

She hadn’t thought he’d check his messages during a meeting.

Pressing a hand to her face, she groaned. I only called him Alexander. No one would guess we’re married. This shouldn’t ruin my plans.

But the damage was done.

The room buzzed with unspoken questions.

Alexander merely leaned back in his chair, the ghost of a smirk playing on his lips.

Let them wonder.

Evelyn took two steadying breaths before typing her reply: [Alexander, I'm truly sorry for causing you any inconvenience.]

The moment Alexander read the message, his lips curved into a satisfied smirk.

His fingers moved deliberately across the screen: [Inconvenience is an understatement. When I return, your punishment will be saying "my love" one hundred times.]

Exhausted from the day, Evelyn had just stepped out of the shower when his text lit up her phone.

Her hands shook slightly as she read his words.

"God help me," she muttered, pressing her palms to her flushed cheeks. Every time she closed her eyes, vivid memories of Alexander's possessive kisses flooded her mind.

Was this really just about pet names?

The images grew more intense—Alexander's hands tangled in her hair, his body pressing hers against the wall—until she splashed cold water on her face to shock herself back to reality.

At dawn, Evelyn arrived at Titan Capital Group's HR department.

Gregory Shaw, the bespectacled HR manager, was already at his desk when—

The man was in his early forties, slightly plump with a warm baritone voice. He had called Evelyn just yesterday.

Gregory Shaw had dedicated over a decade to Titan Capital Group. As the HR manager, he interacted with countless employees daily. Yet, Evelyn Carter puzzled him.

Her resume wasn’t particularly impressive by Titan’s standards—the company was brimming with top-tier talent.

Gregory frowned. Three years unaccounted for after college. A double degree, yes, but zero professional experience. And she bypassed the interview process entirely—an exception hire.

Still, he kept his thoughts to himself. His direct superior had personally vouched for her.

Gregory gestured to the receptionist. "Coffee for Ms. Carter, please." Moments later, a sharp-eyed woman in her twenties entered. "Mr. Shaw?"

He nodded toward Evelyn. "Victoria, this is the new addition to the president’s office. Show her the ropes."

Victoria Sloan froze. Her gaze swept over Evelyn, assessing, guarded.

A silent tension crackled between them.

###Chapter 63 Joining Division Two

The first thing Victoria noticed about Evelyn was her delicate porcelain skin and striking features.

As the head of Division One in the Project Department under Titan Capital Group’s CEO, Victoria Sloan held immense authority. She was Alexander Whitmore’s most trusted confidante, a woman whose sharp instincts and ruthless efficiency had earned her reputation.

Victoria plucked the resume from Gregory Shaw’s desk, her sharp eyes skimming the document before narrowing slightly.

“Only a bachelor’s degree?” Her tone dripped with skepticism. “That hardly suggests an impressive academic background.”

As she continued reading, her expression darkened. “No work experience at all? And a three-year employment gap after graduation?” She scoffed. “In my experience, that usually means either failed postgraduate applications or someone who settled into domestic life too early.” She shot Gregory a pointed look. “This is the candidate you’re handing me? How exactly am I supposed to train her?”

Gregory stiffened, clearly caught off guard by her immediate dismissal.

His gaze flickered toward Evelyn, who sat quietly on the sofa, sipping her coffee with her head slightly bowed. She showed no reaction to their conversation, as if completely unaware she was the topic of debate.

The tension in the room was palpable.

Gregory Shaw exhaled quietly, relieved that the conversation hadn’t escalated further.

"But she’s from the President’s office. If you refuse her…" Gregory began cautiously.

Victoria Sloan cut him off sharply, her tone leaving no room for debate. "The President’s Office isn’t just Division One. Someone like her will only slow us down. With the year-end evaluations coming up, I won’t risk the entire department’s bonus because of one person."

Gregory hesitated, about to respond, when the door swung open.

A man stepped in, his presence commanding immediate attention.

"Then let her join Division Two," he suggested smoothly.

Dressed in a tailored navy suit, his gold-rimmed glasses catching the light, he exuded effortless sophistication. His calm demeanor contrasted sharply with Victoria’s sharp edges.

This was Daniel Pierce, the leader of Division Two in the Project Department. Refined, composed, and every bit the corporate elite.

Alexander Whitmore was swamped with responsibilities, as was the rest of the President’s Office.

To manage the workload efficiently, the Project Department had been split into two divisions—Division One and Division Two. Their primary role was to streamline coordination between the company’s various departments, ensuring seamless operations.

Victoria’s lips thinned, but she said nothing.

Daniel’s gaze flickered toward Gregory. "Unless there’s an objection?"

Gregory shook his head quickly. "No, none at all."

Victoria crossed her arms. "Fine. But don’t come complaining to me when she drags your team down."

Daniel merely smiled. "We’ll manage."

The air between them crackled with unspoken rivalry.

Gregory cleared his throat. "Then it’s settled. She’ll transfer to Division Two."

Daniel nodded. "Perfect."

As he turned to leave, Victoria’s voice stopped him.

"Don’t think this means you’ve won anything."

Daniel paused, glancing back over his shoulder. "This isn’t a competition, Victoria."

Her eyes narrowed. "Everything’s a competition."

With that, he walked out, leaving the tension unresolved.

Gregory sighed.

Another day at Titan Capital Group.

The conference room buzzed with tension as Victoria Sloan spun on her heels to face Daniel Pierce. "Mr. Pierce, you can't seriously be considering someone like her for your team?" Her manicured nails tapped impatiently against her tablet. "That second-rate university? And only a bachelor's degree? How embarrassing for Titan Capital."

Daniel's jaw tightened. "Ms. Sloan, at Titan Capital, we value competence over credentials. Or have you forgotten our core hiring principles?" His voice carried the quiet authority of someone who wouldn't tolerate interference.

Victoria's lips curled in disdain. She flipped her blonde hair over one shoulder. "Three years unemployed speaks volumes about her so-called competence. But by all means, sabotage your own division." Her stilettoes clicked sharply against the marble floor as she exited. "No wonder Division Two's performance trails behind ours."

Alone now, Daniel studied Evelyn Carter's resume with fresh eyes. Academic honors jumped off the page - Dean's List every semester, the prestigious Horizon Scholarship, multiple case competition victories. Only that glaring three-year gap marred an otherwise stellar record.

Something about it intrigued him. Most candidates with gaps made excuses. Evelyn's resume stated the bare facts without apology. That took either arrogance or remarkable self-assurance. He suspected the latter.

The door creaked open as Evelyn entered, her posture straight but not stiff. No nervous fidgeting like most interviewees. Just quiet readiness.

Daniel extended his hand. "Evelyn Carter? Daniel Pierce. Welcome to Titan Capital." Her handshake was firm, her gaze steady. Good signs. "Tell me about this three-year period."

A shadow crossed Evelyn's face, gone so fast he might have imagined it. "Personal circumstances required my full attention." Not defensive. Not evasive. Just final.

Daniel leaned back in his chair. He'd worked with enough talented people to recognize potential when he saw it. Whatever those three years held, they'd forged someone with the steel Titan Capital needed.

"Starting Monday, you'll report to Division Two." He slid a security badge across the table. "Don't be late."

The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Titan Capital Group, casting a golden glow across the polished marble floors.

Daniel Pierce smiled warmly at Evelyn Carter. "Starting today, you'll be part of Division Two. Are you comfortable with that?"

Evelyn rose gracefully from the plush sofa, smoothing her skirt. "Absolutely, Mr. Pierce."

"If you ever need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out." Leading the way, Daniel gestured for her to follow. "Let me show you around first."

Their footsteps echoed softly as they walked through the sleek, modern corridors of Titan Capital.

Meanwhile, in the Marketing Department, Ethan Caldwell leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples.

The air in the office had grown stifling after hours of reviewing reports.

Needing a break, he stepped into the hallway, one hand absently reaching into his pocket for a cigarette.

Just as he flicked open his lighter, a familiar silhouette caught his eye.

His fingers froze mid-motion.

Evelyn.

There she was—walking past, her presence like a sudden gust of wind that knocked the breath from his lungs.

The cigarette slipped from his grasp, forgotten.

His pulse roared in his ears as he watched her disappear around the corner with Daniel.

Ethan remained rooted in place, his mind racing.

What was she doing here?

She was trailing behind a man, their hushed whispers carrying through the empty hallway. Their body language suggested a private conversation, one they didn’t want overheard.

Ethan Caldwell recognized the man instantly—Daniel Pierce from Titan Capital Group’s President’s Office.

Given how often employees from the President’s Office interacted with different departments, Ethan had formed a vague impression of Daniel.

What were these two doing together?

His brows knitted in suspicion. Something felt off.

After watching for a few seconds, he realized they were heading straight toward him. Without thinking, Ethan stepped out from the stairwell.

The corridor was nearly deserted, leaving him directly in Evelyn Carter’s path.

A collision was inevitable.

Daniel stopped just a few feet away, offering a polite nod. "Mr. Caldwell."

Ethan barely spared him a glance, his tone dismissive. "Yeah."

Used to Ethan’s arrogance, Daniel didn’t react. Instead, he gestured for Evelyn to follow him as they continued forward.

Evelyn’s gaze flickered toward Ethan—just for a second—before she walked past without a word.

But that brief glance was enough to unsettle him.

Why did she look at me like that?

His jaw tightened as he watched them disappear around the corner.

Something wasn’t right.

And he intended to find out what.

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the polished marble floors of Titan Capital Group.

Evelyn Carter followed Alexander Whitmore in silence, her heels clicking softly against the gleaming surface.

She hadn’t spoken a single word since they arrived.

Her gaze remained fixed ahead, deliberately avoiding the man standing near the elevators.

Ethan Caldwell.

His presence was like an unwelcome ghost from her past.

She didn’t glance his way.

Didn’t acknowledge him.

But then—

His voice cut through the quiet like a blade.

"I’m getting married."

The words hung in the air, heavy and unexpected.

Evelyn’s steps faltered for just a second before she regained her composure.

She didn’t turn.

Didn’t react.

But the declaration settled like ice in her chest.

Alexander, walking ahead, paused and glanced back at Ethan with an unreadable expression.

The tension between them was palpable.

Evelyn exhaled slowly.

She had moved on.

She had Alexander now.

So why did those words still sting?

The elevator doors slid open.

Without another word, she stepped inside, leaving Ethan and his announcement behind.

But the echo of his voice lingered.

I’m getting married.

And for the first time in months, Evelyn wondered—

Who was the unlucky woman?
###Chapter 64 Alexander's Unexpected Announcement

Daniel, who had already approached, froze in his tracks.

He turned to stare at Ethan with bewilderment.

Mr. Ethan Caldwell is getting married?

Why is he telling me this?

Is he expecting a wedding gift?

Just as Daniel hesitated over whether to respond, Ethan spoke again, his voice low and rough.

"Evelyn," he said, swallowing hard, as if the words were stuck in his throat.

"I'm getting married. Did you hear me?"

An inexplicable emptiness settled in his chest.

"Evelyn, wait!" Ethan called out, his gaze locked onto her retreating figure.

His voice rose, sharp with urgency.

"I said I'm getting married! Are you listening?"

Evelyn finally turned, her expression cool and detached.

Her eyes met his, devoid of any reaction.

The air between them grew heavy.

Ethan clenched his fists, waiting—hoping—for something, anything.

But Evelyn merely studied him for a brief moment before turning away again, leaving him standing there, hollow.

Daniel watched the exchange, unease prickling at him.

This wasn't just about a wedding announcement.

Something deeper, something unresolved, lingered beneath Ethan's words.

And Evelyn's indifference only made it more unsettling.

"Fine, congratulations," Evelyn replied, her voice steady and devoid of emotion.

Ethan Caldwell froze, unprepared for her indifferent response.

His brows furrowed in irritation. Her reaction was absurd. "What did you just say?" he demanded.

In Ethan's mind, Evelyn had always been obsessed with him. She should have been devastated, begging him to reconsider.

Didn't she love him? Could she really let him go so easily?

Congratulations?

She actually had the nerve to congratulate him?

"If you regret this later, I might still be willing to give you another chance," Ethan murmured, his tone laced with condescension.

But when his gaze met hers—cold and unyielding—he was suddenly reminded of that night at Eclipse Lounge, when she had shattered a bottle against the wall just inches from his head.

In the past, Evelyn would fret over the slightest cough he had. Now, she looked at him as if he were nothing.

A bitter frustration twisted inside him. "You don’t even want this opportunity?" he pressed, his voice tight.

Evelyn didn’t flinch. A mocking smile curved her lips. "No."

Without another word, she turned and pressed the elevator button.

Daniel didn't anticipate stumbling upon such explosive information. He pressed himself against the elevator wall, wishing he could disappear.

When Evelyn stepped inside, he quickly followed, barely making it before the doors slid shut.

Ethan Caldwell stood frozen, his outstretched hand grasping at empty air as the elevator descended without him. His jaw clenched, eyes darkening with barely contained fury.

A junior marketing associate rounded the corner just then, clutching a pile of contracts. "Mr. Caldwell! These need your—"

"Out of my sight," Ethan snarled, swatting the papers from her hands. Documents exploded into the air like confetti, fluttering to the marble floor.

The girl recoiled, her back hitting the wall as if struck. She'd never witnessed the usually composed CEO in such a state—his rage was a living thing, crackling in the space between them.

Trevor Moss emerged from a neighboring elevator, took one look at the scene, and immediately fell into step behind Ethan.

The marketing intern remained statue-still, not daring to breathe until both men disappeared down the corridor. Only then did she sink to her knees, trembling fingers gathering the scattered pages.

Upstairs, Evelyn's knuckles whitened around her purse straps. The elevator's mirrored walls reflected her stormy expression—lips pressed into a bloodless line, eyes glittering with something dangerous.

Daniel cleared his throat. "So... that happened."

Evelyn's answering smile could have cut glass. "Indeed it did."

The numbers above the door continued climbing. Somewhere beneath them, Ethan Caldwell was undoubtedly plotting his next move. But Evelyn Carter-Whitmore had stopped running long ago.

Let him come.

She had an empire to protect.

"Ethan, what's going on? You look furious. Let's hit the Eclipse Lounge after work."

Silence.

Ethan strode toward his office, his expression icy.

Trevor followed, but before he could step inside, the door slammed in his face.

"That's… unusual," Trevor muttered, rubbing his nose.

He frowned, wondering who could have possibly angered Ethan this much.

At Horizon Enterprises, it was tradition for the President’s Office to host a welcome dinner for new hires.

Tonight’s venue? The illustrious Cresthaven Grand Hotel—a seven-star luxury establishment dominating the city’s most vibrant district.

The hotel was a masterpiece, its towering architecture gleaming under the night sky.

Rumors claimed its interiors rivaled royal palaces, dripping with opulence.

But prestige came at a price.

Everyone knew the Cresthaven Grand was exclusive.

Its private rooms were reserved for elite guests only.

And the minimum spend? A staggering six figures.

In the break room of Titan Capital Group's executive floor, Cassandra was preparing coffee when she casually remarked, "Ms. Sloan, I heard Mr. Whitmore reserved the entire Cresthaven Hotel for our team dinner. And he's covering all expenses—is that true?"

Victoria's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Mr. Whitmore has always been exceptionally generous with us. Even while on his business trip to Ostraoland, he made sure to arrange this. Since he can't attend, this is likely his way of compensating."

Cassandra stirred a sugar cube into her coffee thoughtfully. "Speaking of which, what's the name of that new hire in Division Two? We should probably thank her. Rumor has it Mr. Whitmore's sudden generosity might be connected to her."

Victoria's brow furrowed slightly. "Some forgettable name. I don’t even recall it." She waved a dismissive hand. "Thank her? Hardly necessary. She’s just another fresh face. Do you really think someone like her could have that kind of influence?"

The unspoken tension lingered between them, neither willing to voice the quiet suspicion that perhaps the newcomer wasn’t as insignificant as she seemed.

Outside the break room, the office buzzed with excitement over the upcoming dinner—unaware of the subtle power shifts already at play.
###Chapter 65 Unexpected Reunion

Cassandra noticed Victoria's indifferent reaction to the new hire and chimed in, "Perhaps Mr. Whitmore simply wants to celebrate our team's efforts. Come on, Ms. Sloan. We shouldn't keep everyone waiting."

As the car glided toward the luxury hotel, Evelyn pulled out her phone and typed a quick message to Alexander: [Did you book this dinner? The place is extravagant.]

The restaurant required a minimum spend in the high five figures, and Evelyn couldn't help but wince at the thought.

Alexander responded almost instantly: [Mrs. Whitmore, congratulations on joining Titan Capital Group’s executive office. Consider this my welcome gift. Enjoy yourself—you’ve earned it.]

Evelyn exhaled softly, setting her phone down.

To Alexander, the cost was negligible, but to her, the gesture carried weight. No one had ever gone to such lengths for her before. She understood his intention—to help her bond with her new colleagues, integrate smoothly, and thrive in her role.

The restaurant’s grand entrance glittered under crystal chandeliers. The group was escorted to a private dining room where champagne flutes already sparkled with chilled Dom Pérignon.

Victoria leaned toward Cassandra, murmuring, "I’ve never seen the company splurge like this for new hires."

Cassandra smirked. "Maybe Mr. Whitmore has special reasons."

Evelyn pretended not to hear, smoothing her dress as she took her seat.

Then, the door swung open.

A familiar figure strode in—tall, impeccably dressed, with a smile that once made her heart race.

Ethan Caldwell.

Her ex-fiancé.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

His gaze locked onto hers, and his smirk deepened. "Well, this is a surprise."

The room fell silent.

Alexander’s gift had just taken an unexpected turn.

Evelyn Carter sat quietly in the passenger seat, her gaze fixed on her phone. Beside her, Natalie Brooks—her colleague of the same age—studied her with open curiosity.

"You've been glued to that screen since we got in the car," Natalie remarked, tilting her head. "Evelyn, tell me—do you have a boyfriend?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Daniel Pierce cleared his throat pointedly.

Oh, she definitely had a boyfriend. Or rather, an ex-boyfriend—one who happened to be a high-profile figure in Cresthaven. And if rumors were true, their breakup hadn’t been peaceful.

Daniel had learned Evelyn’s true identity earlier that morning, but he kept it to himself. The President’s Office valued discretion, and so did he.

Still, he couldn’t help but marvel at the fact that someone from such a privileged background was now working under him. It only strengthened his resolve to mentor her properly.

"Natalie," Daniel cut in smoothly, "let’s not pry into personal matters."

The three of them made up Division Two at Titan Capital Group, and their dynamic was relaxed—almost familial.

Natalie blinked innocently, feigning ignorance. "What? I’m just making conversation!"

Evelyn finally looked up, her expression unreadable. A faint smile played on her lips, but her eyes held something darker—something that hinted at memories best left buried.

Daniel suppressed a sigh.

Some questions were better left unanswered.

Work had kept her busy all day, leaving no opportunity to properly welcome Evelyn to Titan Capital Group. Now, she scrambled for any topic to break the ice.

Realizing how abrupt her question sounded, Natalie felt a flush of embarrassment. She absently tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, already planning to make it up to Evelyn with drinks later.

The moment they stepped out of the car, Evelyn’s phone buzzed.

With a quick gesture, she signaled for them to go ahead while she lingered at the hotel entrance to take the call.

It was Margaret. "Evelyn, you must attend the blind date tomorrow at 7 PM at Maple Leaf Café. I handpicked this man myself—handsome, kind, everything you need. And don’t fool yourself into thinking Ethan will suddenly care just because you joined Titan Capital. He’s moved on."

Meanwhile, at Cresthaven Hotel’s parking lot—

Vanessa and Ethan stepped out of the car.

Ethan had been distant the entire ride, lost in thought. Vanessa had no idea what occupied his mind.

According to Nathan, his mood had been foul all day. Several employees had already been on the receiving end of his temper, dismissed from his office with sharp words.

Vanessa had meant to ask why Ethan had gone out of his way to get Evelyn into Titan Capital. Did he still have feelings for her?

The question burned on her tongue, but one glance at his stormy expression kept it locked inside.

As they approached the entrance, Evelyn’s voice carried over from where she stood, phone pressed to her ear.

Ethan froze mid-step.

Vanessa followed his gaze—and there she was.

Evelyn Carter.

Her ex.

Her presence was like a spark to dry tinder.

Evelyn turned, her eyes widening when they landed on Ethan.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Vanessa’s nails dug into her palm.

This was not how tonight was supposed to go.

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the pavement as Vanessa hesitated, her fingers twitching at her sides. She wanted to ask Ethan what was bothering him, but the fear of his reaction held her back.

What if he snapped at her? What if he shut her out completely?

Swallowing her unease, she looped her arm through his and murmured, "Ethan, let's go inside."

Just as he took a step forward, his entire body tensed. His sharp gaze locked onto a figure standing near the entrance of Cresthaven Hotel.

Vanessa followed his line of sight—and froze.

Evelyn.

There she was, phone pressed to her ear, her expression unreadable from this distance.

Vanessa's grip tightened unconsciously, the fabric of Ethan's sleeve wrinkling under her fingers. He glanced down, a frown creasing his brow.

Realizing what she'd done, she immediately released him and forced a light laugh. "Looks like Evelyn still can't stay away from you, Ethan. Can't blame her—you are irresistible."

Her tone was teasing, but beneath the playful words lingered a sliver of possessiveness.

Ethan said nothing, but the tension in his shoulders eased slightly.

For the first time that day, the storm in his eyes quieted.

The crisp autumn air carried whispers of the past as Evelyn moved through the crowded café.

She didn’t expect to see him here.

Alexander had noticed her presence long before she realized he was watching.

He knew.

Evelyn still cared for him.

Why else would she keep appearing in places he frequented?

She was different now—subtler, more calculated.

No longer the desperate woman who had once clung to him.

This new approach was clever.

And it worked.

He noticed.

A prickle of awareness ran down Evelyn’s spine.

She turned.

Two familiar faces stared back at her.

Vanessa’s lips curled in displeasure.

"Evelyn," she said, voice sharp. "Are you following us?"

The accusation hung in the air, heavy with unspoken tension.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her coffee cup.

She hadn’t expected this.

Not today.

Not here.

But fate had a way of throwing them together.

Again.
###Chapter 66 The Humiliation of Vanessa

Evelyn slipped her phone into her designer handbag with deliberate calm. "Don't flatter yourself," she said coolly. "I'm here for dinner, not to stalk you."

Vanessa's perfectly sculpted brows arched in disbelief. "The minimum spend at this restaurant is six figures. Where would you get that kind of money?" She shook her head, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "We're sisters, Evelyn. If you wanted to join us, you could've just asked. I wouldn't have judged you."

A sharp laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "Join you? Vanessa, your delusions never cease to amaze me." She took a step closer, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Every dollar you're spending tonight came from Horizon Enterprises—my inheritance. But don't worry. My lawyers are already preparing the paperwork. You'll be repaying every cent Richard funneled into your account over the last three years."

Vanessa's flawless complexion paled.

Suing me? Has Evelyn lost her mind?

But then, realization dawned.

Vanessa smirked, crossing her arms. "Oh, please. You're just trying to distract from the fact that you followed us here like some pathetic stalker." She tilted her head, feigning sympathy. "If you wanted dinner, Evelyn, all you had to do was ask. I—"

Evelyn cut her off with a raised hand. "Save your theatrics. I have no interest in your company or your lies." She turned on her heel, her tone icy. "Enjoy your meal while you can. The bill is coming due soon."

Vanessa's smile faltered as Evelyn walked away, leaving her standing in the opulent restaurant lobby, the weight of the threat settling uncomfortably in her chest.

"There's no need to escort us," Vanessa said, her tone dripping with false consideration.

She flashed her VIP card for Cresthaven Hotel at the security guard.

Cresthaven Hotel had notoriously high standards—entry was strictly reserved for cardholders.

Rumors claimed its clientele consisted only of the elite—billionaires, aristocrats, and even A-list celebrities. Naturally, security was airtight. Ordinary people couldn't even dream of stepping inside.

The guard's expression shifted instantly upon seeing Vanessa's card. He stepped aside with a deferential bow, granting her passage.

"Evelyn, Ethan and I have an appointment with the wedding planners tonight to finalize our arrangements. If you'd like, you could join us—maybe offer some valuable input," Vanessa said sweetly.

Her invitation was anything but genuine.

It was a thinly veiled taunt, a calculated move to push Evelyn into surrendering any lingering claim on Ethan.

Vanessa was certain Evelyn wouldn’t be able to stomach it. She’d crumble and flee.

Standing there with a saccharine smile, Vanessa pretended there was some deep sisterly bond between them—as if she truly wanted Evelyn’s opinion.

But to her shock, Evelyn didn’t react the way she expected.

Not at all.

Panic flashed across Vanessa's face.

Evelyn reached into her designer handbag and produced a black titanium card embossed with the Cresthaven insignia. She handed it to the security guard with effortless grace.

The guard's eyes widened. He immediately pressed his earpiece, murmuring urgent words.

Within seconds, the grand gates of Cresthaven Hotel swung open. A dozen staff members in crisp uniforms lined the red carpet, bowing in perfect unison.

The general manager himself rushed forward, his polished shoes clicking against the marble. "Ms. Carter!" he exclaimed, beaming. "Your penthouse suite is ready. This way, please."

Ethan and Vanessa stood frozen, their mouths agape.

They watched as Evelyn glided past the welcoming committee, her chin lifted with quiet confidence. The manager hovered at her elbow like an attendant to royalty.

Vanessa's manicured nails dug into her palms.

She had visited Cresthaven countless times—had even hosted charity galas here—yet never received this level of deference.

A poisonous thought slithered into her mind: How?

Had Evelyn somehow ensnared a billionaire?

The possibility made her stomach churn.

Ethan's shocked whisper broke the silence. "What the hell just happened?"

Vanessa had no answers. Only the bitter taste of humiliation.

Inside, the manager was already presenting Evelyn with a crystal flute of vintage champagne. "Compliments of the house, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn accepted it with a small, knowing smile.

The game had changed.

And Vanessa wasn't prepared to lose.

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the penthouse balcony.

Vanessa studied Ethan's tense profile, her manicured nails tapping against her champagne flute.

Even Alexander Whitmore hadn't received such preferential treatment.

"Ethan," Vanessa finally broke the silence, tilting her head, "care to explain what's happening?"

Ethan remained motionless, his jaw clenched.

Across the room, Evelyn Carter moved with effortless grace, never once glancing in their direction.

A muscle twitched in Ethan's temple.

There was a time when Evelyn's gaze would seek him out in any crowded room. Now? She acted as if he were invisible.

The realization settled like a lead weight in his chest.

Vanessa noticed the subtle shift in his demeanor. Her grip tightened around her glass.

"Tell me you're not still hung up on her," she whispered sharply.

Ethan's eyes darkened. "Don't be ridiculous."

"Then why pull strings to get her into Titan Capital?" The question burst from Vanessa's lips before she could stop it.

Ethan froze.

Surprise flickered across his features before he schooled them back into indifference.

Vanessa held her breath as she watched his reaction.

The truth was far more complicated than she realized.

###Chapter 67 The CEO's Hidden Obsession
Vanessa gave a slow nod. "Wasn't this your doing? Don't tell me you didn't know she's now working at Titan Capital Group?"

Ethan's expression darkened. "I had nothing to do with it."

Now it made sense—why he had spotted Vanessa in the office earlier that morning.

A cold smirk curled at the corner of Ethan's lips.

Titan Capital Group had notoriously strict hiring standards. He was certain Evelyn had pulled strings just to get in, all to stay close to him.

At first, he had almost admired her resilience.

Now, he realized he had given her far too much credit.

Evelyn had downed glass after glass of wine.

Given how often the Executive Office team attended business dinners with Alexander, they were all seasoned drinkers.

Natalie, however, turned into a chatterbox when drunk. Slumped over the table, she blinked blearily at Evelyn.

The clinking of glasses filled the private dining room as laughter bubbled through the air.

"It's too bad Mr. Whitmore and Simon aren't here!" Natalie sighed dramatically, twirling her wine glass. "They're easily the most gorgeous men in Titan Capital—especially Mr. Whitmore. Evelyn, you haven't met him yet, right?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her fork.

Oh, she had met him. Kissed him. Woken up tangled in his sheets.

Natalie hiccuped, leaning forward with a conspiratorial grin. "Honestly, how has Mr. Whitmore stayed single for thirty years? No scandals, no public relationships—do you think there's something... wrong with him?"

Daniel moved lightning-fast, clamping a hand over her mouth. Even among their trusted colleagues from the executive floor, such reckless gossip was dangerous—especially with Evelyn's complicated history tied to Alexander's family.

But it was too late.

Cassandra from Division One sauntered over, her smirk sharp. "Who said Mr. Whitmore doesn’t have a woman?" She lowered her voice. "Just last week, during the Horizon Enterprises merger meeting, someone heard a voice message from a woman calling him 'Darling' in the sweetest tone."

A beat of stunned silence.

Then chaos erupted.

"No way! We’re around him constantly—when would he even have time to date?"

"Was it some socialite? A model?"

Evelyn kept her gaze fixed on her plate, the ghost of Alexander's lips against her ear making her skin prickle.

If only they knew.

"Honestly, I always assumed Mr. Whitmore was into men."

"Absolutely not. Have you seen the way he carries himself? That man radiates pure, undiluted masculinity. Trust me, after binge-watching every romance drama out there, I can confirm—he's definitely straight."

"But what was his reaction? I’m dying to know how he acts around his girlfriend!"

"Probably clueless. I bet he doesn’t even know how to initiate a kiss. He’s probably awkward as hell."

"Damn, that woman must be something else. To melt the ice around a man like Mr. Whitmore? I need to know who she is!"

Despite the President’s Office housing only seven employees, the energy in the room made it feel like a packed auditorium.

Gossip was human nature, after all. Yet amidst the chatter, Victoria Sloan stood silent, her fingers tightening around her wineglass as Cassandra Reed dropped the name Alexander’s mystery woman.

The moment the excitement peaked, Victoria’s cold voice sliced through the air. "Mr. Whitmore doesn’t have a girlfriend. That woman probably threw herself at him. It’s nothing serious."

Cassandra scoffed. "Threw herself at him? Please. You really think—"

The moment the words left Natalie's lips, Evelyn's fingers tightened around her wineglass.

"I don't think so," Victoria chimed in, swirling her cocktail. "But rumor has it when Mr. Caldwell heard the woman's voice, he actually smiled."

Evelyn, who had been resting her forehead against the cool table to steady herself, jerked upright.

"Smiled?" Her voice came out slightly too loud. "Mr. Caldwell? The man who looks like he was carved from ice? Suddenly I'm invested in this mystery woman."

Across from her, Cassandra snorted into her drink.

None of them noticed how Evelyn's knuckles had gone white around her clutch.

She was drowning in secondhand embarrassment.

This is surreal.

The woman they were gossiping about was literally sitting right beside them, nursing a martini and praying the ground would swallow her whole.

The dinner ended with more speculative chatter about Alexander Whitmore's love life.

Evelyn stumbled out of Cresthaven's grand entrance, the night air doing little to clear the champagne haze. She leaned heavily against a marble column, willing the world to stop spinning.

Then she remembered.

Alexander asked me to text him.

Fumbling with her phone, she typed out a clumsy message with uncooperative fingers.

Just as she hit send, two familiar figures emerged from the hotel's golden-lit lobby—Ethan Caldwell and Vanessa Hart, their arms linked like some twisted power couple.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

Vanessa's laugh cut through the night, sharp as broken glass. "Honestly, darling, I don't know why you even bother with—"

Her words died when she spotted Evelyn.

A slow, venomous smile spread across her face.

"Well. If it isn't my dear stepsister."

Ethan's gaze locked onto Evelyn with the intensity of a predator sighting wounded prey.

The column was the only thing keeping Evelyn upright as the world tilted dangerously.

Somewhere behind her, Natalie gasped.

Oh God.

This was not how tonight was supposed to go.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the hotel lobby, her breath caught in her throat.

Vanessa stood frozen, her eyes widening in shock. "Evelyn? What happened? You're completely wasted!"

Concern etched across her face, Vanessa rushed forward. She turned to Ethan with urgency. "Ethan, she can barely stand. A drunk woman alone at night is a disaster waiting to happen. We should take her home."

Ethan's brows furrowed as he strode toward Evelyn, reaching out to steady her. "Since when do you drink like this? What the hell were you thinking?" His voice was sharp, laced with irritation—but beneath it simmered a protectiveness he didn’t even recognize.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Evelyn swayed slightly, her vision blurring. She opened her mouth to speak, but the words dissolved into a soft, incoherent murmur.

Vanessa exchanged a glance with Ethan. "We can't just leave her like this."

Ethan exhaled sharply, his jaw tightening. Without another word, he slid an arm around Evelyn’s waist, pulling her firmly against his side.

Her warmth seeped into him, stirring something deep and unsettling.

A dangerous thought flickered through his mind—one he immediately crushed.

But the way her body molded against his?

That was a problem.

A big problem.
###Chapter 68 An Unforeseen Guest

Evelyn had her first taste of alcohol during her eighteenth birthday celebration.

That fateful day was supposed to be magical - sharing the same birthday as Vanessa meant they were to have a joint coming-of-age ball. The highlight was meant to be Evelyn's first waltz with Ethan.

But destiny had other plans.

The night before the ceremony, while taking an evening stroll through the rose gardens, Evelyn was suddenly attacked by Vanessa's beloved spaniel.

That dog had always been gentle, following Evelyn around like a shadow. No one could explain its sudden aggression.

Instead of dancing under crystal chandeliers, Evelyn spent her milestone birthday in a sterile hospital room, battling infection from the deep bite wounds.

While she lay feverish in bed, Ethan ended up leading Vanessa across the ballroom floor. When Claire showed Evelyn the video footage, the pain cut deeper than any dog bite ever could.

Claire smuggled in two bottles of cabernet that night. By dawn, both young women were giggling drunkenly about how absurd life could be. The expensive silk gown meant for Evelyn's debut remained untouched in its box.

The alcohol blurred Evelyn's judgment as she dialed Ethan's number, her voice trembling with intoxication. "Why?" she demanded, the single word heavy with accusation.

Ethan's response came cool and calculated. "Vanessa was the center of attention at the party. She needed a dance partner. Was I supposed to leave her standing alone?"

His tone turned mocking. "You're just jealous, Evelyn. If you hadn't gotten yourself bitten by that dog, you would've been the one in my arms tonight."

The truth was, the signs had been there for months—lingering glances, whispered conversations, sudden business trips. Evelyn had ignored them all, clinging to denial.

Now, hearing his belated concern, she let out a bitter laugh.

Suddenly, he remembered she couldn't handle liquor?

Yet he conveniently forgot all the times she'd drowned her sorrows in alcohol because of him.

Evelyn's lips curled into a faint, humorless smile. "What I drink isn't your concern anymore."

Her words were sharp. "We're over. Stop showing up where you don't belong."

The scent of whiskey clung to her, making Ethan's nose wrinkle in distaste. He exhaled sharply, deciding reasoning with a drunk was pointless.

"Vanessa," he called over his shoulder, voice clipped. "Bring the car around."

His dismissal stung, but Evelyn refused to let it show. She straightened, gripping the edge of the bar for balance.

The night air was cold against her flushed skin as she stumbled outside, determined to leave before he could see her break.

But fate had other plans.

Headlights cut through the darkness as a sleek black car pulled up—not Vanessa's, but one she recognized instantly.

Her breath hitched.

Alexander Whitmore stepped out, his gaze locking onto hers with an intensity that made her pulse race.

Evelyn's world tilted—not from the alcohol, but from the storm brewing in his eyes.

What was he doing here?

Ethan tossed the car keys toward Vanessa with careless ease.

Vanessa caught them reflexively, the cold metal pressing into her palm. A flicker of discomfort crossed her mind—why was she automatically the designated driver among them?

Something about this situation felt off.

Ethan's impatient voice cut through her thoughts. "What are you waiting for? Move."

Her lips pressed together, fingers curling around the keys so tightly she barely registered the sting of her nails biting into her skin.

Across from them, Evelyn shook her head firmly. "I don't need a ride."

"You drank," Ethan argued, frustration edging his tone. "How else are you getting home?"

Vanessa forced a smile, though it didn't reach her eyes. "It's late, Evelyn. Taxis are impossible to find right now. Just let us take you."

"I said no." Evelyn's voice was sharp, laced with irritation. "Is that not clear enough?"

Ethan reached for her wrist, but Evelyn sidestepped him with practiced ease.

Then, in a deliberate motion, she pulled a tissue from her purse and wiped the spot where his fingers had nearly brushed her skin—as if scrubbing away contamination.

Ethan's face darkened, his jaw clenching. "Evelyn!"

The air between them crackled with tension.

Vanessa watched, silent, the keys in her hand suddenly feeling heavier than before.

Evelyn paid him no attention. After cleaning her hands, she tossed the tissue into Vanessa's palm with deliberate precision. "Here, you can have this. Isn't this what you specialize in—collecting garbage?"

Vanessa's expression darkened instantly, her lips pressed into a bloodless line.

"Evelyn, that's enough!" Ethan growled, his voice rough with warning.

Just as tension crackled between the three of them, the roar of an engine cut through the air. A sleek, vintage luxury car rolled to a smooth stop in front of them.

Cresthaven was no stranger to expensive vehicles, but this one was different—a rare classic, one of only five in existence worldwide.

The door swung open, and a sharply dressed man stepped out. The sheer opulence of the car made all three of them pause, their gazes locking onto the newcomer.

The man approached them with practiced ease. "Ms. Hart?"

Vanessa blinked, a flicker of confusion crossing her face. "Are you... looking for me?"

It was obvious this man served someone important. Vanessa couldn’t imagine Evelyn having connections to anyone of real influence.

She stepped forward, chin lifting with practiced arrogance. "And you are?"

The man remained unfazed, his polite smile unwavering. "I’ve been sent to escort you."

Vanessa’s eyes gleamed with sudden interest. "By whom?"

Before he could answer, Evelyn crossed her arms, her voice dripping with skepticism. "Must be a mistake. No one with taste would invite her anywhere."

Ethan shot Evelyn a warning glare, but the driver merely inclined his head. "No mistake, ma'am. The invitation is specifically for Ms. Hart."

Vanessa’s lips curled in triumph. "See? Some people do recognize quality."

Evelyn scoffed, but before she could retort, the driver gestured toward the car. "Shall we?"

Vanessa didn’t hesitate. With one last smug glance at Evelyn, she sauntered toward the vehicle, leaving the other two standing in stunned silence.

Ethan turned to Evelyn, his expression unreadable. "What the hell was that?"

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed as she watched the car disappear down the street. "I don’t know... but something tells me we’re about to find out."
###Chapter 69 Not Good Enough for You

Vanessa's posture gave her away instantly, revealing to the man that she wasn't the person he had come for.

With a smooth pivot, he turned to Evelyn instead, offering a polite smile as he opened the rear door of the vintage car. "Ms. Carter, I'll escort you home."

Ethan and Vanessa stood frozen, their expressions twisting in disbelief.

What in the world is happening with Evelyn?

First, the general manager of Cresthaven Hotel had personally greeted her at the entrance. Now, this rare, meticulously restored car had arrived just for her.

Were these just hired actors? Some elaborate performance?

Unlike their shock, Evelyn remained composed.

Earlier, when she had texted Alexander her location outside the hotel, he had assured her a car would be sent.

But she hadn’t expected this—a vintage luxury vehicle that turned heads effortlessly.

The polished chrome gleamed under the afternoon sun, its deep burgundy paint flawless.

Ethan’s grip on Vanessa’s arm tightened as he watched Evelyn step inside with effortless grace.

The door shut with a soft click, sealing her away from their stunned silence.

The engine purred to life, smooth and powerful, as the car pulled away from the curb.

Vanessa’s lips parted, but no words came out.

Ethan’s jaw clenched.

This wasn’t part of the script.

Evelyn wasn’t supposed to have this kind of presence.

Not after everything.

Yet there she was—vanishing down the street in a car worth more than his entire year’s salary.

And he had no idea how to process it.

Inside the car, Evelyn exhaled slowly, her fingers tracing the supple leather seat.

Alexander had a flair for the dramatic.

But then again, so did she.

And this?

This was just the beginning.

This was far too extravagant.

Evelyn slid into the sleek black car without hesitation. Ethan instinctively reached out to stop her, but the driver smoothly maneuvered to block him, his movements effortless.

Under the stunned gazes of Ethan and Vanessa, the vintage car’s headlights flickered to life, illuminating the night before speeding away.

The vehicle vanished into the darkness within seconds. Ethan stood frozen, his eyes locked on the empty street long after the taillights had disappeared.

The glow of passing streetlights cast shifting shadows across his face. It took him several moments to finally look away.

Something about the driver nagged at him—a flicker of recognition he couldn’t quite place.

Surrounded by wealth his entire life, Ethan rarely bothered memorizing the faces of chauffeurs. Yet he was certain he’d seen that man before.

Vanessa scoffed beside him, her voice dripping with disdain. "Evelyn? With someone like that? Please. She must’ve latched onto him the second you two broke up. Pathetic."

Ethan turned sharply, his brow furrowing. "What did you just say?"

"A man, obviously. How else would she get picked up in a car like that?" Vanessa sighed dramatically, feigning sympathy. "Honestly, Ethan, you dodged a bullet."

Her words hung in the air, bitter and sharp.

Ethan clenched his jaw, his mind racing.

Something wasn’t adding up.

She didn’t know, but Evelyn had been absent from home these past few days. I have a strong suspicion she’s being hidden away by someone.

Ethan’s expression darkened instantly, his hands curling into tight fists. The air around him grew heavy with barely contained fury.

Unaware of the storm brewing within him, Vanessa continued, her voice dripping with disdain. "The Hayes family is one of the most respected in Cresthaven. How could she disgrace us like this?"

"Who knows how long this affair has been going on? They’ve probably been laughing behind our backs this whole time."

"Now it makes sense—why those reporters ambushed us outside the hotel that day. She planned it all. She wanted to pin the scandal on us while she sneaked around with her secret lover."

With every word, Ethan’s rage intensified. His jaw clenched so tightly it looked painful.

A visible vein throbbed at his temple, his eyes burning with resentment.

Without warning, he lashed out, his fist slamming into the marble pillar beside them with a sickening crack.

The force of the blow sent a sharp gust of wind past Vanessa’s face. She gasped, stumbling back in shock, her face draining of color.

By the time she regained her composure, Ethan was already storming away, his broad shoulders rigid with fury.

Vanessa hurried after him in her stilettos, nearly stumbling as she reached for his hand.

"Ethan, please don't take your anger out on yourself. Evelyn doesn’t deserve this."

His knuckles were raw, the skin split, crimson droplets welling up from the wounds.

Her lips pressed into a thin line, her chest tightening at the sight.

Then, abruptly, he halted.

Vanessa, unable to stop in time, collided with his broad back.

The parking lot was eerily still.

After a heartbeat of hesitation, she wrapped her arms around his waist from behind, pressing herself against him.

"Ethan, I’m the only one who truly cares about you. Evelyn was never worthy of you," she murmured, her cheek resting against the fabric of his shirt.

When he didn’t pull away, a knowing smile curved her lips.
###Chapter 70 You Don't Know Men

The weekend arrived, and Evelyn slept in until noon.

Sunlight streamed through the curtains as she finally stirred awake.

Her phone buzzed with a notification—a message from Alexander sent late last night.

[Mrs. Whitmore, you should have told me you were home.]

The timestamp read midnight, right when she had been drifting off.

Her fingers hovered over the screen, ready to reply, but then she remembered the time difference in Ostraoland.

Dawn would just be breaking there.

Unsure if he was awake yet, she hesitated. The last thing she wanted was to disturb him.

Before she could decide, her phone rang.

Claire’s name flashed on the screen.

"Meet me for drinks," Claire demanded, her voice rough.

Evelyn frowned. "You’re pregnant. No alcohol. Did you tell Lucas?"

A bitter laugh crackled through the line. "He’s dead. Who am I supposed to confess to now?"

Claire’s words dripped with venom, followed by a string of curses.

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone.

Something was very wrong.

Lucas Bennett was a complete bastard.

He'd slept with Claire and vanished without a trace, leaving her unable to reach him ever since.

Evelyn Carter frowned, sensing Claire's dark mood, and immediately arranged to meet her.

They chose Maple Leaf Café, where Claire ordered two bottles of red wine.

Just as she poured a glass, Evelyn snatched it away and replaced it with sparkling water.

"I'm not planning on kids, so what's the harm in a drink?" Claire muttered, but in the end, she didn’t touch the alcohol.

Evelyn sighed. "Give me Lucas’s number. I’ll call him myself."

"Pointless," Claire said with a bitter laugh. "He changed it. He won’t sign the divorce papers, and now he’s disappeared. What kind of game is he playing? Does he get off on making me wait?"

Evelyn shook her head—she had no answers.

If she truly understood men, she wouldn’t have wasted seven years of her life on Ethan Caldwell.

Looking back now, those years felt like—

Evelyn wanted to slap herself.

"I've decided," Claire said, swirling the ice in her glass. "I'll give him one more month. If I still can't reach Lucas by then, I'll book the appointment."

A month-old pregnancy was still early enough. The procedure wouldn’t take much of a toll on her body.

This was Claire’s ultimatum—for Lucas, and for herself.

Thirty days. Enough time to untangle her emotions and close this chapter for good.

The bottle of wine sat open between them, but Evelyn had lost her appetite for it.

Not wanting to waste good alcohol, Vanessa ended up drinking two glasses instead.

Midway through dinner, the alcohol hit Vanessa harder than expected. She excused herself to step outside for air.

As she passed a private room, movement caught her eye.

The door was slightly ajar. A waiter slipped in with a tray, the smoky haze inside parting just enough for Vanessa to catch a glimpse of a familiar figure lounging on the sofa.

She hesitated, then leaned closer for a better look.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. Without another thought, she pushed the door open and strode inside.

The door burst open with a sharp crack, drawing every eye in the room toward her.

Lucas Bennett lounged on the plush sofa, a deck of cards fanned carelessly in one hand, a cigarette perched between his lips. His eyebrows shot up when Evelyn Carter stormed in, her presence like a sudden storm disrupting the calm.

With a lazy flick of his wrist, he tossed his cards onto the table. His gaze slid past Evelyn, searching for the one person he expected to follow her—Alexander Whitmore. But then he remembered. Their marriage was still a secret.

Evelyn’s attention zeroed in on the woman beside Lucas.

She was quiet, unassuming, dressed in simple clothes that didn’t demand attention. Not as striking as Claire Dawson, but there was something about her eyes—something eerily familiar.

A memory flashed in Evelyn’s mind.

"Lucas always has a true love."

Her lips pressed into a thin line.

So this is her?

That’s why he agreed to marry Claire so easily—because she was just a stand-in?

What a bastard.

The realization settled like ice in her chest.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the private lounge, whispers erupted.

With so many scandalous rumors swirling around her, it was impossible for the elite crowd not to gossip when she appeared in person.

The social circle was tight-knit, and those who could share a private space with Lucas Bennett were all from influential families. Their curiosity burned—what was Evelyn Carter doing here?

Evelyn locked eyes with Lucas, her voice sharp. "Do you realize Claire has been searching for you?"

Beside Lucas, the woman clinging to his arm stiffened, her fingers tightening around his sleeve.

Lucas pulled his arm free and lounged deeper into the plush sofa. "I'm aware."

"Then why are you avoiding her?" Evelyn demanded.

She wasn’t one to meddle in other people’s affairs.

But Claire was her closest friend, and seeing her heartbroken while Lucas entertained another woman in a VIP room was too much to ignore.

Too many prying eyes surrounded them. Some conversations weren’t meant for an audience.

Evelyn shot Lucas a pointed look and turned toward the door, expecting him to follow.

The hallway was dimly lit as Evelyn confronted Lucas directly. "If you don't love Claire, just set her free. She's already prepared the divorce papers. Why drag this out?"

Lucas flicked open his lighter, the flame casting shadows across his sharp features. He took a slow drag of his cigarette before exhaling a cloud of smoke. "Women never truly understand how men think."

Evelyn clenched her fists. Why did men always speak in riddles instead of just saying what they meant?

"Stop being cryptic. Do you even know that Claire is—"

"Lucas."

Before she could finish, the woman from earlier reappeared, her heels clicking against the marble floor as she approached them.

The interruption made Evelyn's blood boil. She had been so close to revealing the truth—the one thing that might finally make Lucas see reason.

But now, with this woman hovering nearby, the moment was lost.

Evelyn shot Lucas a glare. "You're making a mistake."

He merely smirked, tapping ash into a nearby tray. "Or maybe you just don't know men as well as you think."

The tension between them crackled like static.

Evelyn turned on her heel, frustration burning in her chest. If Lucas wanted to play games, fine. But Claire deserved better.

And she would make sure her best friend got it—no matter what.
###Chapter 71 Just Friends

The woman appeared visibly frightened of Evelyn. She stole a nervous glance in her direction before ducking behind Lucas.

Lucas froze. "Isabella, what are you doing here?"

Isabella Rhodes bit her lip, her wary eyes flickering toward Evelyn again. "I was worried about you. Who is she?"

"She's a friend of Claire's," Lucas answered, then turned his attention back to Evelyn. "What were you saying? What happened to Claire?"

Evelyn's expression darkened.

The moment she saw Isabella, any desire to continue the conversation evaporated.

"You stayed out all night for her?" Evelyn asked, her voice dripping with icy contempt as she raked her gaze over Isabella. "Lucas, your taste is truly appalling."

As expected, Isabella's face drained of color.

Lucas stiffened, immediately defensive. "Don't jump to conclusions. There's nothing going on between Isabella and me."

Evelyn opened her mouth to retort—but then Claire appeared out of nowhere.

"Nothing?" Claire's voice was sharp with disbelief. "Lucas, how can you lie so shamelessly?"

Claire's eyes burned with fury as she flung her designer purse straight at Lucas. "You disgusting pig!"

Isabella moved swiftly, positioning herself as a human shield in front of Lucas.

"Claire, it's not what it looks like. Don't take this out on Lucas. If you're angry, hit me instead!" Isabella pleaded, her voice trembling.

Before she could finish, the purse struck Isabella square in the face. She let out a dramatic gasp, collapsing onto the floor as if struck by a bullet. Her hands flew to her face, tears cascading down her cheeks in perfect, glistening streams.

Lucas's expression darkened instantly. He dropped to his knees beside her, his hands hovering over her as if she might shatter. "Isabella!" His voice cracked with concern.

Even Evelyn found the theatrics unbearable, let alone Claire.

The purse was made of buttery-soft lambskin and contained nothing heavier than a phone and a lipstick. It wouldn't have hurt a fly.

Claire's eyes were bloodshot, her fingers ice-cold. Evelyn reached for her hand, squeezing it gently.

"Divorce him," Evelyn murmured. "I'm with you."

Claire nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. "Come with me to the procedure next week."

"Of course."

They hadn't spoken loudly, but Lucas heard every word.

The moment Lucas heard Claire needed surgery, he instantly let Isabella go.

Lucas narrowed his eyes, studying Claire intently. "What surgery? Where does it hurt?"

"That's none of your concern," Claire shot back.

Without hesitation, she brought her stiletto heel down hard on Lucas's foot, grinding it in before walking away as if nothing had happened.

Lucas caught her wrist, his grip firm. "Did your old leg injury flare up again?"

Three years ago, Claire had been in an accident that left her leg severely damaged.

She had once been a rising star in ballet, but the injury had forced her to abandon the stage entirely. She'd even spent two long years overseas, recovering in solitude.

In the end, she'd had no choice but to pivot to modeling.

A bitter laugh escaped Claire. "Lucas, are you seriously pretending to care now?"

"You're still my wife. Of course I care."

Claire yanked her arm free. "Ex-wife."

"Ex nothing. I never signed those papers," Lucas retorted before sweeping her off her feet and tossing her over his shoulder.

"Put me down!" Claire shrieked, pounding his back with her fists.

Lucas's arms tightened around me as I struggled. "Claire, stop squirming!"

My injured leg throbbed, but pride burned hotter. "Put me down, Lucas!"

He ignored my protests, his grip unyielding. "Your leg is acting up again. Just let me carry you."

Frustrated, I dug my nails into his back, but he didn't even flinch.

Gasps and whispers followed us as he strode through the crowd, uncaring of the spectacle we made.

Evelyn stood frozen, her eyes wide.

She had never seen Lucas like this—so stubborn, so protective.

For a moment, she hesitated, then stopped herself. It was clear—whatever was between Lucas and me, it wasn't just friendship.

Turning, Evelyn's gaze landed on Isabella, who lingered nearby.

"Ms. Rhodes," Evelyn said coolly, "you saw that, didn't you? Chasing after a man who clearly cares for someone else won't end well for you."

Lucas's reaction spoke volumes. The way he had swept me up the second he heard about my surgery, the way he refused to let me walk—this wasn't indifference.

Evelyn knew Alexander's friends well enough. Lucas wasn't the type to play games.

Isabella's lips pressed into a thin line, but she said nothing.

Evelyn walked away, leaving her standing there, alone.

The realization hit her like a lightning strike. The issue had to be with Isabella.

Her cheeks burned crimson as she lowered her gaze. "I... I'm not involved with him like that," Isabella stammered, twisting her fingers together. "Mr. Bennett and I—we're only friends."

The words hung in the air, fragile as glass.

A beat of silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken tension.

Isabella's pulse raced beneath her skin. She could feel the weight of the other woman's scrutiny, the unasked questions pressing against her like a physical force.

The truth was more complicated than simple friendship, but she couldn't bring herself to say it. Not yet.

Some secrets were meant to stay buried.

For now.

###Chapter 72 The Unexpected Encounter

Evelyn found the whole situation absurd and let out a derisive laugh.

"Since you claim to be just a friend, you should understand boundaries." She crossed her arms, her tone sharp. "Throwing yourself at him like this is inappropriate. He's married—or does that not matter to you?"

Isabella bit her lip, her eyes glistening with feigned hurt.

Evelyn had no interest in continuing this conversation. She had said what needed to be said.

She turned and walked back toward Lucas's private room, intending to retrieve the unfinished bottle of wine they had left behind.

What she didn’t notice was the pair of watchful eyes that had been tracking her every move since she stepped inside.

Ethan had always thought of Evelyn as dull, someone who responded to everything with a passive "okay."

But lately, she kept surprising him.

The way she carried herself now—confident, vibrant, alive—was nothing like the woman he had once dismissed.

Just as Evelyn reentered the private room, her phone buzzed.

It was Margaret.

My phone buzzed violently in my pocket.

Margaret's shrill voice pierced through before I could even greet her. "You promised to be at Maple Leaf Café by seven for your blind date! It's already ten past! Where the hell are you?"

I winced.

Completely slipped my mind.

"You only set this up because you're terrified I'll sabotage Vanessa and Ethan's wedding," I snapped, slinging my purse over my shoulder as I turned toward the café.

"Such a pity! I hope they tie the knot quickly. And spare me the matchmaking—I’m not interested. Push me too far, and I swear I’ll turn their wedding into a circus. The whole of Cresthaven will laugh at you."

Her gasp was sharp. "I’m your mother! Of course I care about your future! You wouldn’t dare ruin Vanessa’s big day—it’s too late for jealousy now."

I hung up before she could spew more nonsense.

But fate had a cruel sense of humor.

The moment I stepped out, Margaret barreled into me, her eyes lighting up like I’d just won the lottery.

"The matchmaker swears this man is Ethan’s equal," she gushed, gripping my arm. "At least meet him!"

With a determined grip, Margaret dragged Evelyn inside the restaurant.

Evelyn struggled against her mother's hold, shaking her head vigorously.

This was ridiculous.

She was a married woman. What was she doing at a blind date setup?

The wine from earlier clouded her judgment slightly, and Margaret's iron grip made it impossible to break free.

Just as Evelyn considered making a scene, two familiar figures turned the corner of the hallway.

Ethan and Vanessa.

Of all the cursed timing.

Spotting them before they noticed her, Evelyn whipped her head toward Margaret.

"Which room?" she demanded sharply.

Margaret blinked at her daughter's sudden urgency.

"Right here," she answered, gesturing to the private dining room beside them.

Without hesitation, Evelyn shoved the door open and yanked Margaret inside, slamming it shut just as Ethan and Vanessa passed by.

From the hallway, Vanessa's confused voice carried through the wood.

"Mom? What were you and Evelyn doing just now—"

The rest was cut off as Evelyn pressed her back against the door, heart pounding.

This was not how she'd imagined her evening going.

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air as Evelyn stepped into the Maple Leaf Café.

She had no idea Vanessa would be here tonight.

Originally, Ethan had planned to take Vanessa to the Eclipse Lounge.

But Vanessa wanted Ethan to witness Evelyn's blind date firsthand, so she'd changed their meeting spot to this very café.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor—Vanessa hadn't expected to literally bump into Evelyn at the entrance.

Margaret, unaware of Vanessa's scheming, answered honestly when questioned. "I arranged this blind date for Evelyn."

Ethan's eyes darkened instantly. "A blind date?"

Margaret nodded. "With your wedding approaching, I thought it best to keep Evelyn... occupied."

His jaw tightened. "She agreed to this?"

Margaret glanced at the closed private room door, sensing the dangerous edge in Ethan's voice.

Inside, Evelyn heard every word.

It wasn't cowardice keeping her hidden—she simply refused to waste energy on pointless confrontations. The plush booth and steaming chamomile tea offered far better company.

The clinking of silverware outside the door grew louder as the hostess seated Ethan's party at an adjacent table.

Vanessa's laughter rang false as she deliberately raised her voice. "Darling, doesn't this café remind you of our first date?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her teacup. The liquid trembled, casting ripples across the surface like her unsettled thoughts.

A waiter approached with two menus. "Your blind date should be arriving shortly, Miss Carter. Shall I bring another pot of tea?"

Before Evelyn could respond, the café door chimed again.

All conversation ceased as a familiar silhouette filled the doorway—tall, broad-shouldered, with that unmistakable aura of command.

Alexander Whitmore stood frozen on the threshold, his stormy gaze locking onto Evelyn's startled one.

The teacup slipped from her fingers, shattering against the saucer in a discordant symphony.

Vanessa's triumphant smirk faltered as Alexander strode past their table without a glance.

He stopped before Evelyn, his voice dangerously soft. "Tell me this is some terrible joke."

The entire café held its breath.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "I could say the same about your presence here."

Alexander's lips curved into that infuriating smirk she knew so well. "Oh sweetheart, you have no idea what game you've just walked into."

Outside, thunder rumbled—a perfect mirror to the tempest brewing between them.

Vanessa's manicured nails dug into Ethan's arm as understanding dawned. This wasn't just any blind date.

This was war.

Seeing the empty room, Evelyn exhaled in relief.

She moved toward the plush sofa, sinking into its cushions. The plan was simple—wait until the voices outside faded before making her exit.

Then came the unmistakable sound of running water.

Her breath hitched.

Before she could react, the bathroom door swung open.

A tall figure emerged, dressed in a fitted black shirt that accentuated his broad shoulders. He was drying his hands with a tissue, his movements precise.

Evelyn's pulse spiked.

This wasn't part of the plan.

The man lifted his gaze, and their eyes locked.

Recognition flickered in his expression.

Her stomach twisted.

Of all people, why did it have to be him?

The air between them thickened with unspoken tension.

She should leave. Now.

But her legs refused to move.

His lips curved into a slow, knowing smile.

"Fancy meeting you here, Evelyn."

Her fingers tightened around the armrest.

This wasn't just bad luck.

This was a disaster.
###Chapter 73 Not Meant To Be

Evelyn couldn't help but notice his elegant hands as they rested on the table. The way his fingers tapped lightly against the polished wood surface caught her attention.

"Those look like a musician's hands," she mused silently.

When Ryan Fletcher's gaze landed on Evelyn, his eyes widened slightly in recognition. "You're early," he remarked, his voice laced with surprise.

Evelyn averted her eyes, maintaining her composure. "Wrong room. I'll just stay for a few minutes before I go."

A knowing smile played on Ryan's lips. He recognized her excuse for what it was but chose not to challenge it.

Taking the seat opposite her, he extended his hand in greeting. "Evelyn Carter, I presume? Ryan Fletcher. Your arranged date for this evening."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her eyes flickering to his outstretched hand before deliberately ignoring it. "Do we know each other?"

Ryan remained unfazed by her coldness.

Reaching for the crystal decanter, he poured two glasses of rich burgundy wine. He slid one gracefully toward Evelyn, the deep red liquid catching the candlelight.

The silence between them grew heavy as Evelyn made no move to accept the drink. Ryan studied her carefully, noting the tension in her shoulders and the way her fingers clenched around her clutch.

"Not a fan of merlot?" he asked lightly, swirling his own glass.

Evelyn finally met his gaze. "Not a fan of being set up," she countered.

Ryan chuckled, the sound warm and unoffended. "Fair enough. Though I must say, this is the most interesting blind date I've ever had."

Evelyn's lips twitched despite herself. There was something undeniably charming about his persistence. Still, she remained guarded, her walls firmly in place.

The soft jazz music from the restaurant's speakers filled the space between them as they sized each other up. Ryan's confident demeanor never wavered, while Evelyn's skepticism remained evident in her stiff posture.

"Tell me, Evelyn," Ryan began, leaning forward slightly. "What would make this evening more bearable for you?"

Evelyn considered the question, her fingers tracing the stem of her untouched wine glass. "Honesty would be a start," she said finally. "Why are you really here?"

Ryan's smile turned rueful. "Because my aunt is very persuasive when she wants to be. And because," he added with a meaningful look, "I was curious about the woman who turned down my cousin."

Evelyn's breath caught at the mention of Alexander. So this was another Whitmore family test. Her expression hardened instantly.

"I see," she said coldly. "Well, you can tell your family their little investigation is over. I'm not interested in playing their games."

She stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. Ryan rose as well, his expression turning serious.

"Evelyn, wait—"

But she was already striding toward the exit, leaving Ryan standing alone with two full glasses of untouched wine and a growing realization that this match was doomed from the start.

The golden afternoon light streamed through the windows of Eclipse Lounge as Ryan Fletcher leaned back in his chair, studying Evelyn Carter with amused curiosity.

"Your recent... adventures have made quite the splash in Cresthaven," he remarked, swirling his whiskey. "Did you really think I wouldn't recognize you?"

Evelyn didn’t reach for the wine glass he had poured for her. Instead, she tilted her head slightly, her expression cool. "And yet, here you are, sitting across from me on a blind date arranged by my mother."

Ryan chuckled, setting the glass down in front of her. "Call it professional curiosity. I wanted to meet the woman who sent Ethan Caldwell to the hospital."

Her fingers tapped lightly against the table. "Do you have a problem with Ethan?"

"Let’s just say we have history."

"What kind of history?"

Ryan smirked. "When we were five, he wet the bed and blamed it on me."

Evelyn blinked.

Then it clicked.

Ethan’s aunt had married into the Fletcher family. That made Ryan his cousin.

Margaret Hayes had truly outdone herself this time.

She had set her up on a blind date with Ethan’s own relative.

Did she not care about the storm this would stir?

The Aniston family was already in chaos.

Technically speaking, now that Evelyn was married to Alexander, Ethan should have been addressing her as aunt.

Dealing with one Caldwell was troublesome enough. Evelyn didn’t need any more complications.

Assuming the people outside had left, she pushed the door open to exit.

To her shock, the moment she stepped out, three pairs of eyes immediately locked onto her.

Margaret shot Evelyn a sharp, warning glare.

Vanessa tilted her head, trying to peer behind Evelyn. "That was fast. Was he not your type?"

Ethan spoke up, his tone indifferent. "If it's not a match, don’t force it. No one’s making you stay."

Evelyn stared at them, inhaled deeply, rolled her eyes, and slammed the door shut with a resounding bang.

She stormed back to the couch and drained an entire glass of wine in one go.

These people were like persistent shadows—always lurking where she least wanted them.

"Mom, who was that man inside?" Vanessa asked, her curiosity piqued.

Margaret shook her head. "I'm not sure. The matchmaker insisted he was perfect, so I didn't question it further."

Ethan Caldwell let out a derisive laugh. "Perfect? Her standards are impossible. Who could possibly meet them besides me?"

He fumbled with a cigarette, finally lighting it after multiple attempts.

Taking a long drag, his expression darkened.

Vanessa Hart caught the bitter edge in Ethan's voice.

It irritated her how his attention always circled back to Evelyn.

What terrified her more was the possibility of Ethan interfering with Evelyn's dates.

Clenching her jaw, Vanessa tugged lightly at Ethan's sleeve. "Ethan, didn't you mention wanting to go to Eclipse Lounge earlier? I could use a drink too. Let's go."

"I think Ethan still has feelings for you."

Ryan Fletcher leaned forward eagerly. "The way he looked at you—it was full of longing."

Evelyn Carter said nothing, swirling her glass of sweet red wine before refilling it.

The silence stretched, heavy with unspoken thoughts.

She took another slow sip, savoring the rich flavor.

Ryan watched her, waiting for a reaction that never came.

The dim lighting of the restaurant cast shadows across Evelyn's composed face.

Outside, the city lights of Cresthaven glittered like scattered stars.

But Evelyn's gaze remained distant, lost in memories she wouldn't share.

"I swear Alexander is jealous," Ryan declared, his boots clicking against the hardwood as he paced.

He stopped abruptly, snapping his fingers. "What if we fake a relationship to mess with him?"

The idea seemed to electrify him. "Just picturing Alexander's face turning red is already worth it."

"Imagine it," Ryan continued, grinning. "The woman who used to chase him suddenly dating his cousin? He'd lose it completely."

Their rivalry ran deep.

Born in the same year, they were constantly compared.

Alexander was the golden boy—top of his class, recruited straight into Titan Capital Group, living up to every expectation set for him.

Ryan, however, had chosen a different path. Instead of corporate ladders, he'd built a name in esports.

In most families, gaming might be respected. But in theirs? It was practically rebellion.

Evelyn swirled her wine, considering.

Ryan's plan aligned perfectly with what she'd been thinking.

But still…

"Why would I choose you over Alexander?" My fingers tapped lightly against the glass in my hand, the ice cubes clinking softly. "Alexander is Ethan’s uncle, after all. Wouldn’t it be far more satisfying to make Ethan call me aunt?"

A slow smirk curled at my lips as I watched his expression shift.

The thought alone sent a thrill through me.

Ethan Caldwell had once been everything to me—until he wasn’t.

Now, standing here in the dim glow of the Eclipse Lounge, the idea of twisting the knife deeper was too tempting to resist.

Alexander Whitmore was powerful, dangerous, and entirely unpredictable.

But so was I.

And if there was one thing I had learned, it was that revenge tasted sweeter when served with patience.

The corner of his mouth lifted in a knowing smile.

"Careful, Evelyn," he murmured, his voice low and edged with amusement. "Playing with fire has consequences."

I took a slow sip of my drink, meeting his gaze without flinching.

"Good thing I’ve always liked the heat."
###Chapter 74 The Bold Proposal

Ryan froze for a heartbeat before slamming his palm against the table, his eyes widening in alarm. "Good lord, you've completely lost your mind!"

He dragged a chair closer, sitting down beside Evelyn with exaggerated urgency.

"Are you serious right now? Or did that champagne go straight to your head? Alexander? That's my uncle! Do you have any idea what kind of man he is? In all my years, I've never seen him with a woman! And you want him to play your pretend boyfriend?"

Ryan gave her an incredulous look before breaking into a grin. "But hey, if you actually pull this off, I'll eat my hat. No—I'll walk barefoot across hot coals."

Evelyn merely smirked, saying nothing.

She had a feeling Ryan would regret that promise.

The wine had been deceptively smooth, but the buzz hit her hard. Leaning back against the couch, she closed her eyes to steady herself while Ryan went to check the door.

The visitors had already left by the time he returned.

"Seriously, reconsider my offer. I’m not exactly lacking in admirers. Being my fake girlfriend wouldn’t be the worst deal for you."

Alexander glanced up, realizing Evelyn had her eyes closed and wasn't responding. He studied her for a long moment.

Her cheeks were flushed pink, her body limp against the armrest of the sofa. Clearly, she had indulged too much.

Stray strands of hair fell across her forehead, one curling against her long lashes.

A soft breeze drifted through the open door. She swiped at the strands clumsily, missing entirely. Frustrated, she propped herself up on one elbow.

Just as Alexander wondered what she was doing, Evelyn cupped her face in both hands and shook her head vigorously.

She didn’t stop until the stubborn strand finally slipped free.

Alexander blinked, stunned.

He had never seen this side of Evelyn before.

Before he could speak, she flopped back down with a sigh.

A chuckle escaped him.

She was definitely drunk.

Yet even like this, he found her infinitely more endearing than Vanessa.

How could Ryan Fletcher be so blind?

A subtle warmth had begun to settle in Alexander's chest without him realizing it.

His arms were loosely folded, the posture deceptively casual, yet carrying an air of effortless indifference.

"Where do you live? Should I escort you home?"

Evelyn remained silent on the couch, her breathing slow and uneven—clearly far too intoxicated to respond.

Alexander glanced down at his hands—hands that had signed deals worth hundreds of millions.

Just as he reached to help her up, a sharply dressed man stepped into the room, positioning himself firmly between them.

Alexander stilled, caught off guard.

His brows lifted in surprise as he recognized the newcomer. "Nathan? What are you doing here?"

Nathan didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he bent down, sliding one arm beneath Evelyn’s knees and the other around her back, lifting her effortlessly into his arms.

He looked travel-worn, as if he’d come straight from the airport without stopping.

Nathan’s gaze lingered briefly on Evelyn’s flushed cheeks before flicking up to meet Alexander’s eyes—a silent challenge in that brief glance.

"Collecting my employee," he said coolly.

Alexander's eyes widened in shock, his brows knitting together in confusion. "Your woman? Alex, you... You two..."

He wondered if Alexander had lost his mind too, seeing things that weren't there.

What am I witnessing?

Alexander is actually carrying Evelyn?

And he's calling her his employee—or worse, his woman?

Ryan was utterly baffled. He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself, his expression still stunned. "Are you two... together?"

Alexander nearly said yes.

But the word caught in his throat as he realized—if their relationship became public, it could destroy Evelyn's career.

So instead, he answered coolly, "She works in my executive office. If she's not my employee, then what is she?"

Hearing that, Ryan exhaled in relief.

That had nearly given him a heart attack.

Thank God I didn't make a move on her.

Alexander's voice was laced with icy detachment. "I heard you two were here for a matchmaking session tonight?"
###Chapter 75 A Dangerous Misstep

Ethan gave a hesitant nod. "Yeah, that's right. I even suggested she pretend to be my girlfriend—"

He cut himself off abruptly, sensing the sudden shift in Alexander's expression. The air between them turned icy, sending an involuntary shiver down Ethan's spine. A cold sweat prickled at the back of his neck.

Did I just make a huge mistake?

Alexander's sharp brows drew together, his voice dropping to a dangerous low. "Employees of Titan Capital Group's executive office are strictly prohibited from romantic entanglements."

His tone was clipped, leaving no room for argument. "No exceptions. No arrangements."

Without another word, Alexander scooped Evelyn into his arms and strode out of the private room, leaving Ethan standing there in stunned silence.

It took Ethan several long moments to process what had just happened.

What the hell?

Titan Capital Group was known for its progressive policies—employee benefits were the envy of the industry. Since when did they enforce such an archaic rule?

He had never heard of anything like this before.

Was this some kind of personal vendetta?

Or had he unknowingly crossed a line he shouldn’t have?

"No dating, no matchmaking—isn't that a bit extreme?"

Alexander tightened his grip around Evelyn as they slid into the backseat of the car. His expression darkened the entire ride home.

Two days.

That was all it had taken.

Two days away on business, and his newlywed wife had already sneaked off to meet his nephew for a blind date.

And not just any blind date—one that ended with her drunk in front of a man she barely knew.

His jaw clenched.

She was getting reckless.

What if it hadn’t been Ryan? What if it had been someone dangerous?

Evelyn, oblivious to the storm brewing inside him, curled deeper into his chest with a soft sigh. Her breathing evened out, her lashes fluttering against her cheeks.

Alexander exhaled sharply, fingers tracing the dip of her waist before giving a sharp pinch.

"Evelyn," he ground out, voice low. "You will explain this."

She only nuzzled closer, lips parting slightly in sleep.

Up front, Simon pressed the accelerator harder, the speedometer climbing past 180.

The sooner they got home, the better.

Before Alexander decided to really lose his temper.

The thought echoed in his mind like a desperate plea. Help me.

Simon Graves felt like an unwelcome intruder in this tense moment.

Even though Alexander Whitmore's anger was palpable, Simon couldn't shake the feeling that he was nothing more than an unnecessary presence.

Evelyn Carter’s lashes trembled faintly, her breathing steady—no indication she would wake anytime soon.

Then, without warning, Alexander leaned down.

His face hovered dangerously close to hers, his breath ghosting over her lips.

They were soft, slightly parted, glistening under the dim car light.

Alexander’s throat moved as he swallowed hard, his fingers tightening around her chin.

Just as the tension thickened, the car rolled to a smooth stop in the garage.

Simon didn’t dare turn around. He wished he could dissolve into the seat.

"Mr. Whitmore," he murmured, voice barely above a whisper. "We've arrived."

A low hum of acknowledgment was all Alexander gave before stepping out, Evelyn cradled securely in his arms.

Then—unexpectedly—her eyes fluttered open.

Evelyn blinked, disoriented, her gaze drifting until it landed on Alexander’s face.

A beat of silence.

Then, with a soft sigh, she melted into his embrace, her arms looping around his neck.

Her voice was honeyed, laced with the drowsy warmth of intoxication.

"Alexander..."

The way she said his name sent a shiver down his spine.

She nuzzled closer, her breath warm against his skin.

Simon wisely pretended not to exist.

"Darling! You're finally home!"

Alexander stood frozen, his breath catching in his throat.

Simon watched, utterly stunned.

Evelyn nestled her head against Alexander's chest, her voice soft, almost teasing.

"Why did you keep me waiting so long?"

She swayed slightly, her steps unsteady, her balance faltering.

Yet her flushed cheeks remained pressed against him, her eyes glazed with a hazy sweetness.

Alexander's entire body tensed.

The bitter jealousy and fury that had burned inside him moments ago evaporated like mist.

All he could think of was the way she had looked up at him, calling him darling in that breathless voice.

She was warm, pliant—utterly irresistible. He wanted nothing more than to crush her against him and claim her right there.

He should be furious with her.

But she had called him darling.

And just like that, his resolve shattered.
###Chapter 76 Wait Here

Evelyn, intoxicated and stubborn, finally made it home with Alexander's assistance.

She swayed slightly as she stepped inside, her movements uncoordinated.

Turning around, Alexander caught sight of Evelyn tugging at the hem of her dress.

She was already dressed lightly, and as she fumbled with the fabric, only a form-fitting knit dress remained on her slender frame.

Alexander's jaw tightened as he swiftly grabbed her wrist, halting her from undressing further. "What do you think you're doing?"

Evelyn flashed him a mischievous grin, her eyes glazed with alcohol, and pointed toward the bathroom. "I'm going to shower."

Alexander exhaled sharply, resisting the urge to roll his eyes.

Before he could respond, she crouched down, attempting to slip her arms out of the sleeves.

"Drunk people shouldn't shower," Alexander insisted firmly, stepping in front of her.

He moved quickly, positioning his tall frame in front of the bathroom door, blocking her path.

"Why not?" Evelyn blinked up at him, her expression clouded with confusion.

Alexander frowned, his voice stern as he fabricated an excuse. "It's dangerous. You could slip."

She pouted, her lower lip jutting out in defiance. "But I feel sticky."

"Then wait until you're sober," he countered, crossing his arms.

Evelyn huffed, clearly displeased, but her energy seemed to wane as she leaned against the wall for support.

Alexander watched her carefully, making sure she didn’t attempt anything reckless again.

Her cheeks were flushed, her breathing uneven, and her eyelids drooped with exhaustion.

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Just sit down before you hurt yourself."

Evelyn mumbled something incoherent but complied, sinking onto the edge of the bed.

Alexander kept his gaze fixed on her, ensuring she stayed put.

The room was silent except for her soft, uneven breaths.

After a moment, she tilted her head, studying him with half-lidded eyes. "You're bossy."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "And you're drunk."

She giggled, the sound light and carefree, before her expression turned serious again. "But I really need to shower."

Alexander exhaled, his patience thinning. "Not happening."

Evelyn groaned dramatically, flopping backward onto the bed. "Fine. But I'm not happy about it."

He shook his head, amused despite himself. "I can live with that."

She turned her head to glare at him, though the effect was ruined by her drowsy state.

Alexander folded his arms, unmoved. "Stay there. I'll get you some water."

Evelyn mumbled something under her breath but didn’t argue further.

As he turned toward the kitchen, he heard the rustling of fabric behind him.

He spun back just in time to see her attempting to sit up again.

"Evelyn," he warned.

She froze, then sighed dramatically. "Okay, okay. I'll wait."

Alexander narrowed his eyes, making sure she stayed put before finally walking away.

He returned moments later with a glass of water, only to find her curled up on the bed, already half-asleep.

Shaking his head, he set the glass on the nightstand and pulled the blanket over her.

She murmured something unintelligible but didn’t wake.

Alexander watched her for a moment longer before turning off the lights and quietly leaving the room.

He had a feeling the morning would be interesting.

"Too much can make you drown in the bath, you know."

Evelyn blinked slowly, processing Alexander's words. For a moment, she almost believed him. "Really?"

Alexander nodded solemnly. "Absolutely true."

"But..." Her cheeks flushed pink as she frowned. "Aren't I a fish?"

Then, without warning, she crouched down.

She curled her fingers into tiny claws beside her face, bared her teeth, and let out a playful growl.

"Piranha. Rawr."

It was anything but intimidating—adorable, if anything.

Alexander chuckled, tapping the tip of her nose lightly. "Even fish can drown. Didn’t you know that?"

Evelyn’s confusion deepened.

Before she could protest further, Alexander took her hand and tugged her toward the bedroom. "Forget the bath. Just sleep."

The moment her body hit the mattress, she melted into it like liquid, boneless and pliant.

Behind her, Alexander exhaled heavily in relief.

A bath?

Not happening tonight.

She was far too intoxicated for this.

What if she needed assistance while bathing? The thought alone was enough to drive Alexander mad.

On the bed, Evelyn stirred, rolling over in a dazed stupor, her movements sluggish and uncoordinated—like a caterpillar struggling to find its footing.

A sudden burning sensation flared in her stomach, forcing her upright.

"What's wrong?" Alexander asked, his voice laced with concern.

"Piranhas need rain to thrive," she mumbled, her words slurred.

"Wait. I'll get you water."

But before he could move, Evelyn began tugging at her knit dress again, her fingers clumsy.

"Piranha shedding its skin," she declared, as if it made perfect sense.

Alexander exhaled sharply, torn between exasperation and amusement.

Just as the smooth expanse of her thighs threatened to be exposed, he swiftly bundled her up in the quilt, cocooning her tightly.

Turning away with rigid restraint, he tossed a sleep shirt onto the bed beside her, his voice gruff with forced patience.

"Change into this. I'll get your water."

Without another word, he strode out to the living room, leaving the door slightly ajar behind him.

Alexander waited exactly four minutes, calculating Evelyn should be decent by now before reentering with a glass of water.

The borrowed sleep shirt drowned her petite frame, the oversized collar slipping off one shoulder. Though it reached mid-thigh, the way she sat curled on the edge of the bed exposed far too much bare skin.

Her legs—smooth, toned, and endlessly distracting—were tucked beneath her in a pose that screamed casual intimacy.

Alexander's grip tightened around the glass. He yanked his silk tie loose with one sharp tug.

Snatching the throw blanket from the armchair, he practically threw it over her lap, covering every inch of exposed flesh.

The moment his fingers left the fabric, Evelyn lunged for the water. The sudden movement sent her tumbling against his chest.

Ice-cold liquid splashed across his tailored trousers, soaking through to his skin.

"Oh no—" Evelyn's fingers fluttered over the dark stain spreading across his thigh. Her palm pressed against the damp fabric, rubbing absently.

Electricity shot through Alexander's veins.

His hand clamped around her wrist. "Evelyn." The warning in his voice should have been unmistakable.

She blinked up at him with those wide, innocent eyes.

Then slowly, deliberately, she traced the lines of his palm before threading their fingers together.

Her whisper was a challenge. "I want more."

Alexander's pulse pounded at his temples. "What's insufficient?"

"The water."

Evelyn's gaze, wide and imploring, locked with his.

That innocent look combined with her delicate frame made resistance impossible. "Could you... pour me just a bit more?"

Her fingers were tiny, silk-smooth against his skin.

The contact sent electricity up his arm.

Alexander clenched his jaw, clinging to rationality.

He wrenched his hand free. "Stay put!"

Moments later, he returned with a fresh glass.

As he brought it to her lips, Evelyn suddenly twisted away.

Drunk and disoriented, she tangled in the sheets—

One more roll would send her tumbling off the mattress—

Alexander lunged forward.

His knee hit the floorboards. Water sloshed across his dress shirt, dripping down his forearms.

Evelyn blinked at the spillage. Her nose scrunched in disapproval.

A slow, knowing smile curved Evelyn's lips as she gazed at Alexander. Without warning, she seized his collar and yanked him upright from the ground.

Alexander blinked, momentarily disoriented by her sudden movement. His breath hitched as Evelyn leaned in, her lips brushing against the damp fabric over his pounding heart.

The world seemed to pause around them.

Evelyn could feel the rapid thud of his pulse beneath her mouth, steady and strong. She lingered there for a heartbeat longer than necessary before pulling back just enough to meet his stunned gaze.

Alexander's throat worked as he swallowed hard. "Evelyn—"

But she silenced him with a single, lingering look.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Then, with deliberate slowness, she released his collar and stepped back, leaving him standing there, breathless and utterly off-balance.

Her smile deepened.

"Wait here," she murmured, before turning away.

Alexander could only watch as she walked off, his chest still burning where her lips had been.

###Chapter 77 Playing With Fire

The sudden loss of balance sent Evelyn and Alexander tumbling onto the plush bed.

Evelyn’s silky hair fanned across his face and shoulders like spilled ink.

Her flushed cheek pressed firmly against his bare chest, trapping him beneath her weight.

Before Alexander could react, he felt the warm, teasing flick of her tongue against his damp skin, lapping up the lingering droplets of water.

His entire body locked in shock.

A shiver raced up his spine, starting from where her lips brushed his collarbone, leaving him rigid as marble.

"Evelyn!"

His pulse hammered violently, his voice rough with barely restrained hunger.

"Do you have any idea what you're doing?"

He clenched his jaw, fighting the wildfire threatening to consume him.

Evelyn blinked up at him, her drowsy gaze innocent. "Just tasting the water. Didn’t you notice?"

Her lips curved into a slow, teasing smile that made his control snap.

Alexander was utterly speechless.

Her voice came out in a breathy whisper, the places her lips had grazed blooming with heat.

His jaw clenched, throat working as he swallowed hard.

Without warning, he seized her wrist and flipped her beneath him.

Their gazes collided—his dark with hunger, restless and consuming. "In moments like these," he murmured, voice rough, "don’t you think it’s better if the man leads?"

She didn’t get a chance to answer.

His mouth crashed into hers.

A slow, teasing nip at her lower lip.

Then deeper, hotter—a claiming.

The air between them thickened, Alexander’s breaths turning ragged.

Evelyn felt like she was burning alive, every gasp of oxygen thinner than the last.

A soft whimper escaped her as she tried to turn away.

But Alexander cradled the back of her head, fingers tangling in her hair, and dragged her back into the kiss.

Their breaths fused.

His other hand traced the curve of her waist, possessive and deliberate.

Alexander's fingers tightened around Evelyn's slender waist, his body thrumming with anticipation as he leaned in for what should have been their next intimate moment.

Then he froze.

Beneath him, Evelyn lay perfectly still, her chest rising and falling in the steady rhythm of deep sleep. Her long lashes cast delicate shadows on her cheeks in the dim lamplight.

Alexander blinked.

The warm glow from the bedside lamp painted golden highlights across Evelyn's peaceful expression. She looked serene. Untroubled.

Completely unaware of his frustration.

His jaw clenched.

Desire burned through him, hot and relentless. He stared down at her sleeping form, his fingers flexing against the sheets for what felt like an eternity.

She actually fell asleep?

Just like that?

While I'm—

His gaze dropped lower.

A heavy sigh escaped him.

Then another.

The alcohol had clearly claimed her completely. Evelyn shifted slightly in her slumber, murmuring something unintelligible before settling again.

Alexander exhaled sharply through his nose.

The night had taken an unexpected turn.

To Evelyn's surprise, Alexander suddenly cupped her face and drew her into his embrace.

The entire night, whenever she attempted to shift away, he would press a soft kiss to her temple, pulling her back against his chest.

His heartbeat was steady and strong beneath her ear, his warmth enveloping her as if he were silently expressing his displeasure.

By morning, Evelyn woke with a stiff neck—so stiff that even the slightest movement sent sharp pain radiating through her shoulders.

She sat up, her throat parched, and immediately reached for the glass of water on the nightstand, gulping it down without a second thought.

Then realization struck.

Her oversized shirt barely covered her thighs, and beneath it—nothing.

Wait… is this Alexander’s?

Her foggy mind struggled to piece together the night before.

She remembered drinking too much at the private lounge, slumping onto the sofa to clear her head… and then Alexander had arrived.

Had he carried her back?

Dressed her?

Her cheeks burned at the thought.

She glanced around the room, but Alexander was nowhere in sight.

Had he left without a word?

A strange ache settled in her chest—one that had nothing to do with her stiff neck.

Her heart skipped a beat. Alexander is back?

And these clothes—did he change me into them?

Heat rushed to her cheeks. Though they were married, they hadn’t crossed that line yet…

Evelyn swallowed hard, suddenly self-conscious.

The muffled sounds from the living room snapped her back to reality. She hurriedly dressed, fingers fumbling with the buttons, then stepped out—still flushed, pulse unsteady.

###Chapter 78 Hold Your Liquor

The dining table was lavishly spread with an array of Evelyn’s favorite dishes, each one meticulously prepared.

Evelyn hesitated, her brows knitting in confusion. She and Alexander had shared only a handful of meals together. How could he possibly know her preferences so well?

Was this mere coincidence?

Taking her seat, she noticed Alexander’s attire—a crisp Mandarin collar shirt that concealed his neck. Less formal than his usual suits, yet it lent him an air of restrained elegance.

Biting her lower lip, Evelyn finally voiced the question burning in her mind. "Why didn’t you tell me you were returning?"

Alexander calmly ladled a bowl of fragrant soup and set it before her. "If I had, how would I have discovered you dining with another man?" His voice was deceptively smooth. "Mrs. Whitmore, have I been too indulgent with you?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She had been careless.

At the time, she’d only wanted to avoid Ryan Fletcher and Vanessa Hart—she hadn’t considered how it might look.

"It wasn’t a date," she murmured, her fingers tightening around the edge of the table. "Ryan is your nephew. Think of it as… a mentor treating a junior to dinner."

Alexander’s gaze darkened, the unspoken tension thickening between them.

Evelyn swallowed.

She had a feeling this conversation was far from over.

Evelyn's voice trailed off, the weight of her guilt pressing heavily on her chest.

The dinner last night… She hadn’t even been the one to pay for it.

A wave of confusion washed over her, but she could see things from Alexander’s perspective.

"Coming home to find his new wife drunk on a date with his nephew… It must have felt like some twisted drama."

"I’m sorry," Evelyn murmured, lowering her gaze. She was grateful Alexander had brought her home safely instead of unleashing his anger right then and there.

Given everything he had sacrificed by marrying her, the last thing she wanted was to cause him more trouble.

"Mr. Whitmore, I was wrong. I—"

Before she could finish, Alexander’s brow furrowed.

He speared a piece of meat with his fork and held it to her lips.

Evelyn instinctively parted her lips, swallowing both the food and her unfinished apology.

A flicker of exasperation crossed Alexander’s face as he noticed her untouched plate. He nudged it toward her, silently urging her to eat.

"There’s no need to apologize. I’m not upset with you."

Evelyn blinked, stunned. It took her a moment to process his words.

Hold Your Liquor

Evelyn’s thoughts raced. Not blaming me?
Then why does he look so upset?

"You can’t handle alcohol well," Alexander said, his voice firm. "Don’t drink unless I’m with you."

Evelyn nodded quickly.

"Especially not around other men," he added, his gaze sharp.

She nodded again, more earnestly this time.

Absolutely!
Drinking is nothing but trouble!
I never expected to get so drunk last night.
That cocktail was way too strong!

A sudden worry struck her. "I didn’t… throw up on the way home, did I?"

"No," Alexander answered flatly.

Relief washed over her—until another thought hit. "I didn’t do anything… embarrassing, right?"

Alexander’s brows furrowed. He studied her for a long moment, his expression unreadable.

Then, without a word, he lowered his gaze and resumed eating, leaving the question hanging in the air.

The silence unnerved her.

Why won’t he answer?
What exactly happened last night?

Her stomach twisted with unease.

Evelyn picked at her food nervously, each bite tasting like sawdust in her mouth. The silence between her and Alexander was suffocating.

What did I do wrong last night?

The question burned in her mind. She considered asking if he had changed her out of her dress.

But the thought of him undressing her while she was unconscious made her cheeks flame.

Better to pretend it never happened.

When the meal ended, she mechanically began gathering the dishes. As she stood, her gaze accidentally caught on the open collar of Alexander's shirt.

Dark love bites marred his neck and collarbones—undeniable evidence of a passionate encounter.

Her hands stilled.

He has someone else.

The realization hit like a punch to the gut. She lowered her eyes, the weight of betrayal pressing down on her.

Who is she?

She'd always known a man like Alexander would have admirers. But seeing proof of his infidelity—

The plate slipped from her fingers, shattering on the floor.

The sight of that woman clinging to Alexander made Evelyn's skin crawl.

Her nails dug into her palms as a single thought burned through her mind: Absolutely not.

This is my chance—right here, right now. I won't let some opportunistic vulture swoop in and steal what's mine.

After hastily stacking the last of the dishes, Evelyn spun on her heel and marched straight back into the room.

Without hesitation, she threw herself into Alexander's arms, pressing flush against him.

His startled inhale was music to her ears.

She tilted her head up, meeting his gaze with deliberate intensity.

Let her try to compete with this.
###Chapter 79 Help You Recall It

Alexander froze mid-motion.

He had just finished dinner and was reaching for his laptop on the coffee table when Evelyn’s sudden movement startled him.

Her slender arms wound around his neck, pulling him close. The warmth of her body pressed against his, her breath soft against his skin.

His throat tightened as he met her glassy, red-rimmed eyes.

A deep crease formed between his brows. "Evelyn," he said, voice low with concern. "What’s wrong? Who hurt you?"

Instead of answering, she tilted her face up, mimicking the way he had kissed her before. Her lashes fluttered shut as she leaned in.

Alexander turned his head at the last second, avoiding the contact.

Something was very, very wrong.

His pulse hammered unevenly as he gripped her shoulders. "Tell me," he demanded, voice rough. "Did Ethan do something to you? Look at me. I’ll handle it."

Evelyn stiffened when he evaded her kiss.

Her lips trembled.

A single tear slipped free.

Alexander’s chest constricted.

Whatever had happened—it was bad.

A sudden chill ran down Evelyn's spine, as if someone had thrown ice water over her.

Her heart clenched. "It's over," she thought. "The other woman must be extraordinary if Alexander is willing to remain devoted to her."

Defiant, she lifted her chin, wrapped her arms around Alexander's neck, and settled onto his lap.

"Alexander, I'm your wife," she whispered, her voice trembling slightly. "If you have needs, you can come to me."

Her delicate fingers tightened around his collar, pulling him closer until their breaths mingled.

"But if you're being unfaithful, how are you any better than that despicable Ethan Caldwell?" Her voice cracked. "If you don't want me anymore, just say it. I'll step aside so you can be with her."

Evelyn had never been the one to initiate intimacy before.

During her seven years with Ethan, she had always been the one chasing after him.

Ethan had never truly cared for her, and naturally, their relationship had never progressed physically.

It wasn't until she married Alexander that she learned what it meant to kiss a man.

But she was still inexperienced—her lips brushed against his clumsily, retreating and returning without finesse.

That clumsy, inexperienced kiss ignited something primal in Alexander, awakening a dangerous hunger that coiled low in his gut.

Evelyn's pulse spiked in alarm.

After being discarded once and finally tasting stability, the mere thought of someone else laying claim to Alexander sent her spiraling into possessive calculations.

She had grown accustomed to this comfortable rhythm of their lives.

But she never anticipated that a simple business trip could fracture their peace—that Alexander might already have found another woman's company. The possibility clawed at her composure.

Claire had warned her once: men were different. Their needs were more visceral, more urgent.

So Evelyn traced the problem back to that.

She remained utterly unaware of how dangerously close they were, how his body caged hers against the wall.

Alexander's gaze turned molten. In one swift motion, he seized the back of her neck, slanting his mouth over hers in a searing, possessive kiss that left her breathless.

When he finally pulled away, his lips brushed the shell of her ear as he murmured, "Unfaithful, Mrs. Whitmore? Where the hell did you get that idea?"

Evelyn fisted his collar—then tore his shirt open with a single, decisive yank.

Buttons scattered across the floor as his shirt ripped open, revealing sculpted abs and a chest that could make any woman weak in the knees.

From his collarbone down, an intricate map of love bites—some rosy pink, others deep violet—told a story of passion unrestrained.

Evelyn’s brows knitted together. "Then what the hell is this?"

"Mrs. Whitmore," Alexander chuckled, glancing at his ruined shirt, "you have quite the appetite when you're drunk, don’t you?"

Her breath hitched as her gaze traced the evidence of last night’s escapades across his bare skin.

Alexander had assumed she was merely playing coy. After all, waking up to find himself thoroughly ravaged by his wife wasn’t exactly something he could brag about.

So he’d stayed silent, letting her believe he remembered nothing.

But now, seeing the genuine confusion in her eyes, realization struck—she truly didn’t recall a single second of it.

And worse, she thought another woman had marked him.

His lips curved into a devilish smirk. "You really don’t remember?"

Leaning in, his voice dropped to a husky whisper. "These are your handiwork, Evelyn. Every last one of them."

Her eyes widened in horror.

"You had me pinned beneath you, biting, scratching—"

Her face burned crimson.

"—and trust me, Mrs. Whitmore, you were very thorough."

The world tilted beneath her feet.

She had done what?

Alexander's fingers tightened around Evelyn's chin, tilting her face upward until their eyes locked.

The intensity in his gaze sent a shiver down her spine.

"Perhaps I should refresh your memory," he murmured, his voice dangerously low.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Evelyn's breath hitched as his thumb brushed lightly over her bottom lip.

His expression darkened, promising both punishment and pleasure.

"Unless you'd prefer to remember on your own?"

The challenge in his words made her pulse quicken.

She knew this game—one she wasn't sure she could win.

But the fire in his eyes told her she wouldn't escape unscathed.

Not this time.

Not when he looked at her like that.

A slow, predatory smile curved his lips.

"Let's begin."
###Chapter 80 Off Limits

Evelyn jerked away from Alexander's embrace, scrambling off him in a flurry of movement.

But before she could put distance between them, his arm shot out, yanking her back against his chest with effortless strength.

"Where's that boldness from earlier?" His voice was a low, teasing murmur against her ear. "Losing your nerve now?"

Her cheek pressed against the exposed planes of his chest, skin to skin where she'd torn his shirt open in her earlier desperation. The heat of him seared through her.

Alexander's grip tightened around her waist—right where she was most sensitive.

A shiver raced down her spine, and she instinctively squirmed, her soft skin rubbing against the hard contours of his torso.

He let out a rough sound, fingers digging in possessively. "Call me honey," he demanded, voice thick with amusement. "Do it right, and maybe I'll let you go."

Evelyn's lips parted in disbelief.

Silence stretched between them until he nudged her again, the words a velvet challenge. "Go on. Say it."

Trapped against him like this—her body molded to his, his arms an unyielding cage—she had no leverage to fight.

She shifted carefully, trying to ease away without aggravating the tension coiled in her neck.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension, every breath a reminder of how little space separated them now.

And how much she suddenly wanted to close it again.

Evelyn felt utterly trapped. She called out Alexander's name several times, but his grip only tightened.

Frustration bubbled inside her. Without thinking, she sank her teeth into his shoulder—hard.

Alexander's eyes darkened with amusement. This little wildcat actually bites?

A sharp jolt of pain shot through him, igniting twin flames of irritation and desire.

Her resistance only amused him further. A wicked chuckle rumbled in his chest.

"Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured, voice dripping with dark promise, "you do remember you still owe me a wedding night, don’t you?"

Evelyn didn’t release him. Alexander didn’t force her to, simply sitting there on the couch, letting her teeth dig in.

But her resolve wavered. His words left her torn—should she keep fighting, or surrender?

In that moment of hesitation, his hand slid lower, tracing a deliberate path down her waist.

His heated gaze locked onto hers before he turned his head, lips brushing her earlobe. His breath hitched, rougher now.

This wasn’t like before.

This time, he wasn’t playing.

A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine, making her thoughts scatter like leaves in the wind.

Alexander's lips curved into a knowing smirk as he leaned in closer, his breath warm against her skin.

Lost in the heat of the moment, Evelyn barely registered her phone buzzing insistently in her pocket.

She reached for it instinctively, but Alexander's grip on her waist tightened, pulling her back against him.

Maybe it's nothing important, she thought hazily, surrendering to the dizzying sensation of his touch.

The ringing stopped, only to start again—sharp, persistent, shattering the fragile tension between them.

Nothing killed the mood faster than an untimely interruption.

What had been an electric connection moments ago now felt fractured, the spell broken.

With a reluctant sigh, Alexander released her.

He could always tell when her mind wasn't fully present.

Evelyn's attention had shifted to the call, and he wouldn't push her when she wasn't completely his.

She answered the phone, and Alexander stepped away, running a hand through his hair in frustration.

The bathroom door slammed shut behind Evelyn.

Margaret's sharp voice cut through the air like a knife. "Evelyn Carter! Do you have any idea how much effort I put into arranging this match for you? And this is how you repay me?" Her tone turned accusatory. "I checked with Ethan myself. Titan Capital Group has no policy against workplace relationships!"

Evelyn froze, water dripping from her fingertips. "What are you talking about? Who said Titan Capital employees can't date?"

"Isn't that the excuse you gave last night?" Margaret's voice rose dangerously. "That ridiculous rule about coworkers not dating? Were you lying to me?"

The accusation hung between them like a guillotine.

Margaret's next words came out in a venomous whisper. "Or is this still about Alexander Whitmore? Are you clinging to some pathetic fantasy of marrying him?"

The mirror reflected Evelyn's pale face as the truth settled in her stomach like lead.

###Chapter 81 Love Bites

Evelyn pieced everything together instantly.

Alexander must have come to the private room to fetch her last night and crossed paths with Ryan.

That meant it was Alexander who had declared that employees of Titan Capital Group were forbidden from dating.

"I have zero interest in marrying Ethan, so you can stop scheming on my behalf. Save your energy."

She was about to end the call when Margaret's voice turned sharp.

"If that's the case, then why aren't you dating anyone? Evelyn, I know exactly what game you're playing."

Her mother scoffed. "Playing hard to get? How predictable. You're just trying to reel Ethan back in, but he belongs to Vanessa now."

Evelyn's patience snapped. "Ethan this, Ethan that—honestly, Margaret, you sound more obsessed with him than Vanessa is."

"How dare you!" Margaret hissed.

"I already have someone in mind. Relax. After Vanessa's wedding, I'll shove my marriage certificate in your face if that's what it takes!"

Margaret raised a skeptical brow. "You're crushing on someone? Seriously? Who is this mysterious man?"

"Alexander."

Margaret burst into laughter, treating Evelyn's confession about liking Alexander as pure absurdity.

They moved in entirely different circles—had likely never even exchanged a glance before. Yet here Evelyn was, declaring her feelings for him? Preposterous!

Margaret dismissed it as one of Evelyn's dramatic whims, too ridiculous to entertain.

Of course, she didn’t take it seriously.

When Alexander returned that evening, he had a social event to attend.

At Maple Leaf Café, Lucas lounged on the plush sofa, a cigarette dangling lazily between his fingers.

"Judging by Evelyn’s expression in that private room yesterday, if she had decided to punch me in public, I wouldn’t have been surprised," Lucas teased, swirling his wine.

"You two really are a match. The intensity you both radiate is almost terrifying."

Alexander shot him a look but said nothing.

Lucas smirked, his fingers tracing the rim of his wine glass. "Truth be told, I was a nervous wreck inside. But for your sake, I had to play it cool. Anyone else, and I would’ve walked away without a second glance."

He passed the glass to Alexander, his gaze inadvertently landing on the vivid marks trailing down his neck.

His breath hitched.

"Damn, what kind of wild night did you two have?" Lucas whistled low, eyes gleaming with amusement. "Did Evelyn take charge? Those bites look… possessive."

Lucas was no stranger to passion, but Alexander—

The thought of him being pinned down, kissed senseless, and thoroughly claimed by Evelyn sent a thrill through him.

From experience, Lucas could guess exactly how it went down.

His eyes flicked to Alexander’s waist.

The man had always been disciplined with his workouts, built like a damn statue.

Yet, if Evelyn had been the one calling the shots…

Was there something Alexander wasn’t telling him?

A flicker of shock, then sympathy, crossed Lucas’s face.

Some men were all strength on the outside but—

Alexander's gaze darkened as he studied Lucas.

He crooked his finger, beckoning him closer.

Lucas frowned. "What?"

Alexander's voice was dangerously calm. "Lucas, are you impotent?"

Lucas blinked, momentarily stunned.

"If there's an issue, address it now," Alexander continued, his tone laced with quiet menace. "Don't let it ruin your marriage. You've just begun—there's a lifetime ahead. In intimacy, a man should never let his woman take control."

With every word, Lucas felt the air grow heavier.

Unaware of the storm brewing, Lucas puffed his chest. "Listen, I know a remedy—guaranteed to make you unstoppable. One dose, and you'll be insatiable. Multiple rounds, no fatigue. You'll thank me later!"

No man tolerated such an insult.

Alexander's eyes narrowed, sharp as a blade. The moment their gazes locked, Lucas's bravado faltered. A cold sweat prickled down his spine.

He swallowed hard but forced a laugh. "Hey, don’t take it personally. Every man has off nights—"

Before he could finish, Alexander’s glare silenced him.

Lucas suddenly fell silent.

Alexander snatched the wine glass, drained the deep crimson liquid in one swift motion, and grabbed his coat from the sofa.

The tension in the room was suffocating.

Without another word, he strode toward the door, his jaw clenched tight.

Lucas watched him go, his expression unreadable.

The heavy oak door slammed shut behind Alexander, the sound echoing through the penthouse like a gunshot.

Silence settled over the space, thick and uneasy.

Lucas exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair.

This wasn’t how the evening was supposed to go.

Downstairs, the city lights glittered like scattered diamonds, indifferent to the storm brewing inside.

Alexander stepped into the elevator, his mind racing.

He needed air.

Needed space.

Needed to get away before he said—or did—something he’d regret.

The elevator doors slid open to the lobby.

Cool night air hit his face as he pushed through the glass doors, his coat billowing behind him.

His phone buzzed in his pocket.

He ignored it.

Right now, there was only one place he wanted to be.

And it wasn’t here.

Not when every breath felt like fire in his lungs.

Not when the memory of her—Evelyn—was a ghost he couldn’t escape.

He quickened his pace, disappearing into the shadows of the city.

Somewhere, a clock struck midnight.

But time no longer mattered.

Not when love had teeth.

And tonight, it was biting hard.
###Chapter 82 The Unexpected Guest

Seeing Alexander was about to leave, Lucas shot up from his seat. "Hey, what's going on? You barely touched your drink. Leaving already?"

His stomach twisted with guilt—had he accidentally insulted Alexander's pride?

Alexander smirked, running his tongue over his bottom lip. "Drinking with you is dull."

Lucas slammed his glass down, amber liquid sloshing over the rim. "We swore we'd get wasted tonight!"

Frustration burned in his chest.

After carrying Claire home yesterday, she'd stunned him by shoving divorce papers in his face without warning.

Then came the sharp click of the lock. No explanations. No arguments. Just cold, silent rejection.

He'd spent the night on the couch, staring at the ceiling.

But the humiliation didn't end there.

Somehow, while he was dead asleep, Claire had the entire sofa—with him still on it—dragged outside like discarded furniture.

She'd literally thrown him out of their home.

Lucas Bennett finally stirred awake when mosquitoes swarmed him on the lawn outside the door, leaving angry red welts all over his skin.

He still couldn’t comprehend why Claire Dawson wanted a divorce.

The memory was hazy, but he recalled that night a month ago—returning home drunk, stripping off his shirt, and stumbling into the shower. Then Isabella Rhodes had called.

His phone had been left on the counter. Claire answered it.

By the time he stepped out, dripping wet, she was already packing her things, her voice ice-cold as she demanded a separation.

It made no sense to him.

All he did was forget his coat at Maple Leaf Café while networking with clients. Isabella had simply called to remind him about it.

Yet Claire was ready to throw away their marriage over something so insignificant.

The thumping bass from the private room snapped Lucas back to reality. He watched Alexander Whitmore stride toward the exit and scoffed. "Alex, you're seriously leaving? What’s the point? It’s not like you can even perform."

Alexander froze.

Alexander spun around, his piercing gaze locking onto Lucas. His jaw clenched so tightly the muscles visibly twitched. "Eighteen and one-eighty. How dare you imply I'm inadequate?"

Lucas blinked, momentarily speechless, before breaking into an impressed grin. "Those numbers—length and stamina? Damn, Alex! You've been holding out on us."

Without another word, Alexander turned away, his silence louder than any retort.

That night, Evelyn stayed over at Claire's apartment.

Earlier, Claire had raved about her new high-definition projector, insisting Evelyn join her for a movie marathon. By the time the credits rolled on the last film, the clock had long passed midnight. Too exhausted to commute, Evelyn texted Alexander and crashed in Claire's guest room.

They stayed up whispering under the covers like teenagers, exchanging confessions until their eyelids grew heavy.

Monday morning arrived with cruel haste.

Evelyn nearly face-planted into her office door.

She sprinted through Titan Capital's lobby, heels clacking against marble, just as Ethan Caldwell exited the opposite revolving door.

Her momentum carried her forward like a gust of wind—

Ethan Caldwell turned abruptly, sensing movement behind him.

His gaze only captured the fleeting silhouette of a woman slipping through the glass doors and into the elevator.

When he didn’t follow, Nathan Reeves glanced back, confused. "What is it?"

But the hallway was empty.

"We need to leave now," Nathan urged, checking his watch. "Morning traffic is brutal. If we don’t hurry, we’ll miss our flight to the investor meeting."

Ethan exhaled sharply before turning away.

His fingers curled around his silent phone.

Not a single message from Evelyn Carter in days.

He shoved it back into his pocket.

"Did you find out who her blind date was?" he demanded suddenly.

Nathan hesitated, then nodded. "It’s Ryan Fletcher."

Ethan stiffened. Disbelief twisted his expression.

"Ryan? My own cousin?" His voice dropped dangerously. "She went on a date with him?"

He paced the polished floor, agitation radiating off him.

The betrayal stung sharper than he expected.

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Titan Capital Group, casting long shadows across my office.

Nathan Reeves stood by my desk, his expression unreadable as he handed me a file.

"Alexander, I think you should see this," he said quietly.

I flipped open the folder, my eyes scanning the contents. Photos of Evelyn Carter—my wife—meeting with Ryan Fletcher at Maple Leaf Café.

My grip tightened on the papers.

Ryan wasn't just anyone. He was Ethan Caldwell's cousin, and Ethan had made it clear he wasn’t done with Evelyn.

Nathan cleared his throat. "Do you think she's trying to send you a message?"

I exhaled sharply, tossing the file onto my desk.

Evelyn had been distant lately, but this? Meeting with Ryan behind my back?

"Or," I said slowly, "is someone trying to manipulate the situation?"

Nathan frowned. "You think Ryan has his own agenda?"

I leaned back in my chair, my mind racing.

The game was far from over. And if Ryan thought he could play me, he was about to learn how wrong he was.

Because when it came to Evelyn, I didn’t share.

And I certainly didn’t lose.
###Chapter 83 First Time Meeting?

Evelyn hadn't reached out to Ethan in days.

Her silence, however, sparked the wrong assumption.

Ethan found himself struggling to decipher her actions.

His brow furrowed as he turned to Nathan. "Cancel the trip."

Without another word, he strode back into the Titan Capital Group building.

Nathan blinked in shock. "But we've spent weeks negotiating this deal. If we back out now, all that effort goes to waste."

Ethan wasn’t impulsive—he was calculated, driven.

Ever since Alexander took over Titan Capital, Ethan’s influence had been slipping.

Losing this contract now would be a strategic misstep.

He exhaled sharply, forcing himself to think.

Ryan had a tournament coming up.

In the world of competitive gaming, players went into isolation for days before a match.

Ethan’s fingers tapped against his thigh.

Maybe Evelyn’s distance had nothing to do with him.

Or maybe it had everything to do with him.

He couldn’t decide which possibility unsettled him more.

Nathan hesitated. "Should I still cancel the arrangements?"

Ethan’s jaw tightened.

Then, just as suddenly, he relaxed.

"No," he said. "We proceed as planned."

But his mind was already elsewhere.

If Evelyn wanted space, he’d give it to her.

For now.

He probably wouldn't dare show his face around Evelyn again.

After all, they'd only had that awkward blind date. Ethan Caldwell wasn't the type to dwell on meaningless encounters.

He couldn’t care less about Evelyn Carter.

Titan Capital Group lived up to its reputation as a corporate giant, its vast operations enough to intimidate even the most ambitious newcomer.

Luckily, Daniel Pierce was efficient. His meticulous organization of files made Evelyn’s first day slightly less overwhelming.

She was skimming through a stack of reports when Natalie Brooks from the adjacent desk leaned over. "Did you grab breakfast?"

"Not yet."

Natalie slid a yogurt cup toward her with a shy smile. "Here. You’ll need the energy."

Evelyn thanked her and took a few quick sips before Daniel called the team to the conference room.

Everything in the CEO’s orbit revolved around Alexander Whitmore.

The meeting focused on finalizing his agenda for the week, with tasks delegated to specific team members.

The conference room buzzed with energy as project assignments were handed out. Everyone except Evelyn received substantial work.

Victoria Sloan's manicured finger tapped against the mahogany table. "From today onward, your sole responsibility will be fetching Mr. Whitmore's coffee and lunch orders." Her crimson lips curled. "Consider yourself lucky to even have that much."

Daniel Pierce's grip tightened around his pen. This wasn't how Titan Capital operated - junior analysts rotated support duties, and certainly weren't permanently relegated to glorified catering staff.

He caught Evelyn's eye across the glass-walled room. The new recruit sat perfectly still, her expression unreadable beneath those thick lashes.

When Victoria turned to address another team member, Daniel leaned closer. "I've got three projects needing extra hands if you're interested," he murmured.

Victoria's head snapped around. "Problem, Mr. Pierce?" Her stiletto tapped an impatient rhythm. "Ms. Carter barely has an associate's degree from some community college. Until she proves otherwise, the breakroom is her domain."

Daniel adjusted his tie. "We all started somewhere, Victoria. I see potential."

The temperature in the room dropped several degrees.

Evelyn's fingers twitched against her notebook. The leather-bound planner bore fresh indentations where her nails had dug in moments earlier.

Across thirty-two floors of steel and glass, Alexander Whitmore's private elevator descended toward the executive dining room. His phone buzzed with a security alert - movement detected in his otherwise empty penthouse.

The game was afoot.

Victoria Sloan and Daniel Pierce led Division One and Division Two respectively. In all their years of collaboration, they had never clashed—until now.

The source of their first disagreement? The new recruit, Evelyn Carter.

But since Evelyn was under Daniel's direct supervision, Victoria couldn't voice her objections too strongly.

The meeting adjourned, and employees filed out of the conference room.

Evelyn and Natalie Brooks lingered behind, exiting just as Alexander Whitmore stepped out of the elevator.

Natalie discreetly tugged Evelyn's sleeve. "That's the CEO—Mr. Whitmore. Follow my lead," she whispered urgently.

Evelyn had started at Titan Capital Group while Alexander was away on business, so this was likely their first meeting.

Natalie didn’t want her to appear disrespectful, so she nudged her again, signaling her to greet him properly.

Evelyn lowered her gaze, staring at the polished marble floor. The soft click of leather shoes approaching made her fingers curl instinctively.

Alexander paused.

Startled, she looked up—and found herself trapped in his piercing gaze.

His voice, smooth yet commanding, drifted down to her. "Are you new here?"

The crisp autumn air carried the faint scent of burning leaves as I stepped into the bustling lobby of Titan Capital Group. My heels clicked against the marble floor, drawing curious glances from employees rushing to their morning meetings.

A young woman with fiery red hair approached me, her clipboard clutched tightly against her chest. "Excuse me, ma'am," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "Are you... new here?"

I arched an eyebrow, recognizing the nervous energy of someone fresh out of college. The name tag on her blazer read 'Natalie Brooks' - one of the junior analysts from the finance department.

Before I could respond, a familiar deep voice cut through the chatter. "She's with me."

Alexander Whitmore emerged from the elevator bank, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. The entire lobby seemed to hold its breath as he strode toward us, his presence commanding immediate attention.

Natalie's eyes widened. "Mr. Whitmore! I-I didn't realize—"

"Evelyn Carter," Alexander said smoothly, placing a possessive hand on the small of my back. "My wife."

The temperature in the room seemed to spike several degrees as whispers erupted around us. I could practically see the gossip spreading like wildfire through the corporate grapevine.

Natalie's face turned scarlet. "Oh my God! Mrs. Whitmore, I'm so sorry—"

"Relax," I said with an amused smile, adjusting the strap of my designer bag. "It's my first time visiting since the merger. Though I must say," I cast a meaningful glance at Alexander, "someone should have warned your staff."

Alexander's lips quirked into that infuriatingly handsome smirk I knew too well. "Where would be the fun in that?"

As we walked toward the private elevators, I noticed Vanessa Hart lurking near the reception desk, her perfectly manicured nails digging into her leather portfolio. The hatred in her gaze could have melted steel.

"Trouble in paradise?" I murmured to Alexander as the elevator doors closed.

He pulled me flush against him, his breath warm against my ear. "Let her watch."

The elevator began its ascent, and I knew this was only the beginning of the storm brewing on the horizon. Somewhere in this very building, Ethan Caldwell was waiting, and this time, I wouldn't be the one left broken.
###Chapter 84 Talent Will Out

The moment left Evelyn speechless.

Having worked in the CEO's office for over six months, she knew Alexander Whitmore was notoriously distant.

He rarely acknowledged greetings from employees, let alone engaged with them. Yet here he was, inquiring about a new hire—something unprecedented.

Vanessa lifted her gaze, meeting Alexander's lowered eyes.

Her expression remained composed, unwavering. "Mr. Whitmore, my name is Evelyn Carter."

A faint smirk touched his lips before he looked away. "Make me a coffee and bring it to my office. Thank you."

With that, he strode off without another word.

Natalie stood frozen for several seconds before snapping out of her daze.

She grabbed Evelyn's arm, eyes wide. "He asked you to make coffee? And thanked you? That’s our job—what’s gotten into him today?"

Evelyn didn’t respond.

Instead, she headed straight for the break room.

The morning sunlight streamed through the windows of Titan Capital Group, casting a golden glow over Evelyn Carter’s desk.

Natalie Brooks leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Mr. Whitmore prefers his coffee with just one sugar cube. He doesn’t like it too sweet."

Evelyn nodded, carefully measuring the sugar before stirring.

"But did you see those marks on Mr. Whitmore’s neck earlier?" Natalie’s eyes sparkled with gossip-fueled excitement.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the coffee cup.

"Cassandra mentioned that during the Horizon Enterprises meeting in Cresthaven, some woman texted him calling him 'darling.' I thought it was just a rumor, but now—" Natalie fanned herself dramatically. "Those love bites don’t lie! Who knew our reserved Mr. Whitmore could be so... passionate?"

Evelyn’s cheeks burned.

It had been two days. Why hadn’t the marks faded yet?

She should never have touched that champagne.

With a deep breath, Evelyn carried the coffee into Alexander Whitmore’s office—only to find Simon Graves already there.

The moment Evelyn stepped in, Simon gave her a respectful nod and took the coffee cup from her hands. "Mrs. Whitmore."

He was the sole person in the entire company aware of her marriage to Alexander.

With practiced discretion, he shut the door behind him, granting them privacy.

Alexander barely glanced up from the mountain of paperwork before him. "Did you rest well at Claire’s last night?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Well enough."

Alexander crooked a finger. "Come here."

She hesitated, then moved closer.

Her gaze snagged on the vivid love bites trailing down his neck.

They were impossible to miss. Yesterday, he’d concealed them beneath a high-collared shirt. Today, he hadn’t bothered.

Heat flooded Evelyn’s cheeks.

"Review this file." He slid a document toward her.

She reached for it. When he immediately returned to his work, she turned to leave.

Then paused.

Spinning back, she blurted, "Thank you."

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Titan Capital Group, casting golden streaks across the polished marble floors.

Evelyn Carter clutched the documents tighter against her chest, her pulse quickening as she met Alexander Whitmore’s piercing gaze.

"You," she said softly.

His brow arched. "What?"

"I know you pulled strings to get me into Titan Capital Group."

The firm was notorious for its ruthless hiring standards—most applicants never made it past the first screening. Yet Evelyn had been fast-tracked in as an exception. She had no doubt Alexander had orchestrated it.

His lips curved into that infuriatingly confident smirk. "Do you really think you’re here just because you’re my wife?"

"Isn’t that the case?"

Alexander stepped closer, his voice dropping to a low, deliberate timbre. "Have some faith in yourself. Talent always rises to the top, Evelyn. You’re exceptional."

Her breath hitched. The words settled over her like sunlight after a storm, warm and undeniable.

She turned on her heel and strode out of his office, immediately drawing the attention of every executive assistant in the vicinity.

Natalie Brooks practically materialized at her side, eyes alight with curiosity. "Evelyn! What were you and Mr. Whitmore discussing in there? Simon got banished!"

Simon Graves, Alexander’s right-hand man and the most powerful figure in the company after the CEO himself, had been unceremoniously dismissed from the room.

Evelyn kept walking, but the ghost of a smile played on her lips.

Talent would out, indeed.

The bond between them had always been unbreakable, yet when Evelyn stepped into Alexander's office, even Simon made himself scarce.

This was unexpected.

Evelyn tapped the folder in her hand lightly. "Mr. Caldwell requested I review this."

At the sight of the document, Cassandra froze, her instincts kicking in.

The air thickened with tension.

Evelyn's gaze remained steady, though a flicker of unease crossed her features.

Cassandra hesitated before reaching for the file.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she flipped open the first page.

What she saw made her breath catch.

This wasn't just any report—it was a revelation.

And it changed everything.
###Chapter 85 The Violin

The Horizon Enterprises merger was Titan Capital Group's most crucial undertaking this quarter. Before Evelyn Carter joined the company, whispers had circulated about who Alexander Whitmore would assign to lead it.

Successfully executing this deal would cement one's reputation as an industry powerhouse.

Victoria Sloan had openly campaigned for the role multiple times, but Alexander remained unmoved. To everyone's shock, the responsibility landed in Evelyn's lap—a newcomer with no prior corporate mergers experience.

"What does she know about high-stakes negotiations? This involves multiple international stakeholders. One misstep, and she'll be drowning in liabilities for the rest of her life," Victoria muttered bitterly.

Daniel Pierce's brow furrowed. "Mr. Whitmore chose Evelyn for a reason. Our team will support her. If anything goes wrong, accountability falls on all of us."

Victoria scoffed but held her tongue.

Daniel turned to Evelyn, his tone softening. "Review the files first. If anything's unclear, come to me. No question is too small."

Natalie Brooks nodded enthusiastically. "Absolutely. Mr. Pierce is the best mentor you could ask for."

Evelyn's fingers brushed the contract's edge, the weight of expectation pressing against her ribs. Across the glass-walled conference room, Alexander's silhouette moved past, his attention never straying toward her.

She exhaled.

This was her chance to prove herself—or crash spectacularly.

Evelyn nodded absently as she worked, her fingers flying across the keyboard. Time slipped away unnoticed. She circled a few confusing sections in the document, making a mental note to research them later.

Before lunch, Alexander and Simon left Titan Capital Group. Some urgent project negotiations required their presence outside the office—likely keeping them occupied for the rest of the day.

When the clock struck noon, Natalie appeared at Evelyn’s desk. "Hungry?" she asked with a smile.

They headed to the cafeteria together.

After eating, Natalie excused herself for a quick nap upstairs.

Left to her own devices, Evelyn wandered through the sleek corridors of the company.

She remembered Daniel mentioning something about a music room in the leisure area during her first day.

Somehow, her feet led her there without conscious thought.

The music room was tucked away in a quiet corner—a private, soundproofed sanctuary.

At this hour, it stood empty.

Her gaze immediately locked onto the cello resting at the far end.

It had been so long since she last played.

Not since… that night.

At that exact moment, Ethan stepped out of the Human Resources Department.

"According to the manager, Ms. Hart was hired through standard procedures and is now assigned to the President’s Office," Nathan reported, trailing behind him.

Ethan strode forward, his expression icy and unreadable.

He had assumed Vanessa came to work at Titan Capital Group just to get his attention.

But days had passed, and she hadn’t made a single move to approach him.

The realization irritated him.

Instead of joining the Marketing Department—where he was stationed—she had gone straight to the President’s Office.

With every passing moment, Vanessa became more of an enigma to him.

As they passed the leisure area, the rich, melancholic notes of a cello drifted from the music room.

Ethan froze.

For a heartbeat, he stood completely still. Then, without warning, he turned sharply and strode toward the source of the music, his pace quickening with urgency.

Nathan barely had time to react before rushing after him.

The rich, mournful notes of the cello resonated through the air, deep and haunting. Ethan Caldwell stood frozen, his chest tightening at the familiar melody. Nathan Reeves watched him, puzzled by the intensity of his reaction.

The corporate lounge was spacious, divided into cozy sections with glass partitions. At this hour, only a handful of employees lingered over coffee.

When Ethan bolted toward the music room, the cello's song cut off abruptly.

His pulse raced as he flung the door open, hope surging through him.

But the room was empty.

A cold dread settled in his stomach. He rushed to the polished cello, fingers brushing its smooth surface, then scanned every corner—behind the piano, near the soundproof panels.

Nothing. No one.

"Did you hear it too?" Ethan turned to Nathan, voice strained. "Or am I losing my mind?"

Nathan nodded. "Clear as day. Whoever it was must've left through the other exit."

The music room had two doors—one leading back into Titan Capital Group, the other to the private courtyard.

Ethan's jaw clenched. That melody...

He hadn't heard it in over a decade.

###Chapter 86 The Melody

At eighteen, Ethan Caldwell's life changed forever.

A horrific car crash left him paralyzed from the waist down.

For seven agonizing days, he battled a relentless fever before slipping into unconsciousness.

The Caldwells pulled every string, calling in specialists from across the globe.

Yet even the finest doctors could only deliver a grim prognosis.

Then, in the depths of his coma, a sound pierced the darkness.

A cello's mournful cry.

Music had been Ethan's refuge since childhood—his fingers knew piano keys like old friends.

Now, those same instincts recognized the sorrow woven into each vibrating note.

The melody became his lifeline, pulling him back from oblivion.

When his eyelids finally fluttered open, blurred vision cleared to reveal Vanessa Hart.

She sat slumped in the visitor's chair, cello resting against her knees.

Tear tracks glistened on her cheeks in the sterile hospital light.

Back then, they'd been nothing more than casual acquaintances.

But in that heartbeat between life and death, everything shifted.

Ethan's gaze lingered on the instrument's polished wood, still humming with residual vibrations.

For the first time, he truly saw her.

Not just another face in the crowd.

But the girl whose music had defied death itself.

The soft strains of a cello drifted through the sterile hospital room.

Ethan Caldwell stirred, his lashes fluttering open. The haunting melody wrapped around him like a familiar embrace.

"During my coma...I heard that music." His voice was rough with disuse. "Was it you?"

Vanessa Hart's eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she nodded. Without a word, she lifted her cello and played the very piece that had anchored him to consciousness.

The notes flowed effortlessly beneath her skilled fingers.

Ethan recognized it instantly—the same composition, yet something felt...different.

Vanessa had always been technically flawless. Her rhythm was impeccable, her execution precise. But today, hearing it again, Ethan noticed the stark absence of raw emotion in her playing.

It was technically perfect.

Yet emotionally hollow.

A masterful performance devoid of soul left listeners with an unsettling emptiness.

Ethan's jaw tightened. His gaze dropped to his hands, lost in thought for a long moment before snapping back to Nathan Reeves.

"Pull the security footage," he ordered. "I want to know who was in the music room earlier."

Nathan gave a curt nod and turned to leave—just as Vanessa stepped through the doorway, her cheeks flushed from the cold.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

"You don't need to verify anything. That was me playing the cello just now."

Ethan spun around, his expression flickering with surprise as Vanessa stepped into his office unannounced.

She glided toward him, slipping her arm through his with practiced ease. "Darling, don’t you recognize my playing anymore?"

Silence stretched between them.

"This is our song," she murmured, her voice soft with feigned nostalgia. "I was saving it for our wedding—a surprise for you."

Ethan stiffened. "You were going to perform this at the ceremony?"

Vanessa nodded, her smile sweet but calculated.

His suspicion dissolved.

Back then, Vanessa had been young, her skills raw. Years of practice could have refined her talent.

When Ethan didn’t press further, she exhaled quietly in relief.

Yet beneath her sleeves, her fingers trembled.

As evening approached, Evelyn’s phone buzzed with a message from Alexander.

[I won’t be home for dinner tonight—networking event.]

Alexander had just flown back from a business trip, and his schedule was packed with back-to-back client meetings. The entire executive floor of Horizon Enterprises buzzed with activity.

Yet, thanks to the company’s strict no-overtime policy, everyone clocked out right on time.

Exhausted after a grueling day, Evelyn had no intention of cooking. Instead, she decided to indulge in a nice meal at a restaurant near the office.

She had just placed her order when the door chimed.

In walked Ethan Caldwell, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, flanked by two associates from Titan Capital Group.

Of all the places...

Evelyn refused to let Ethan ruin her evening. She averted her gaze and focused on her phone, scrolling absently.

His sharp eyes landed on her from across the room. Noticing her deliberate avoidance, his lips thinned.

Guilty conscience?

He paused by her table, tilting his chin slightly toward his subordinates—a silent command. His demeanor was ice-cold. "Go ahead without me."

The team moved ahead without hesitation. "We'll be waiting in the VIP lounge," one of them called over their shoulder.

Ethan Caldwell lingered behind, his expression unreadable. With deliberate movements, he dragged a chair across the polished floor, the screech of wood against marble cutting through the ambient jazz music. He settled directly across from Evelyn Carter, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Ethan leaned forward, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "What exactly are you playing at, Evelyn?"

The dim lighting cast sharp shadows across his angular features, emphasizing the intensity in his stormy gray eyes. His fingers tapped an impatient rhythm against the tabletop, each tap echoing like a countdown.

Evelyn maintained her composure, though her pulse quickened. She met his stare without flinching, her own fingers curling around the stem of her wineglass. The deep red liquid shimmered under the low-hanging chandelier, mirroring the rising tempest between them.

Around them, the upscale restaurant hummed with oblivious diners, their laughter and clinking silverware a stark contrast to the silent battle unfolding at this secluded table.

Ethan's jaw tightened. "You can't keep dodging the question."

A slow, knowing smile curved Evelyn's lips as she took a deliberate sip of her wine. The taste was rich and bold—much like the game they were playing.

She set the glass down with deliberate care. "Can't I?"

His eyes darkened at her evasion. Before he could respond, a server approached with their appetizers, forcing a temporary ceasefire.

The interruption was brief but significant.

As the server retreated, Ethan exhaled sharply through his nose. "This isn't over."

Evelyn picked up her fork, her movements graceful and unhurried. "I wouldn't dream of it."

The unspoken challenge hung heavy between them, thickening the air like the scent of the truffle-infused dish before them.

Somewhere in the background, the live pianist transitioned into a haunting melody—a perfect soundtrack to their dangerous dance.
###Chapter 87 A Tangled Web

Evelyn lifted her gaze slowly, confusion clouding her features.

Ethan reclined in his leather chair, a smug smile playing on his lips. "Don't be ridiculous. I know you joined Titan Capital Group because of me. The President’s Office is my uncle’s domain. I won’t have you stirring up trouble there. Transfer to the Marketing Department—you’ll be my personal assistant."

Evelyn arched a brow. "And why would I give up my position in the President’s Office to work under you?"

His expression darkened. "At least this way, you’ll see me every day. Isn’t that what you’ve always wanted?"

A dry laugh escaped her.

Had Ethan always been this delusional?

"I know you’re upset about my engagement to Vanessa," he continued, waving a hand dismissively. "But the wedding is happening. The invitations are already sent. There’s no changing that. If you become my assistant, at least you’ll still have me during office hours."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "How thoughtful. Does Vanessa know you’re offering me this generous arrangement? Or will she throw another tantrum when she finds out?"

Ethan scoffed. "Vanessa isn’t like you. She’s gentle, understanding—she wouldn’t get jealous over something so trivial."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile.

Of course.

Vanessa, the perfect, docile fiancée.

And here she was, the inconvenient ex who just wouldn’t disappear.

Ethan leaned forward, his voice dropping. "Be reasonable, Evelyn. This is the best I can offer you."

She met his gaze evenly.

"Funny. I don’t recall asking for anything from you."

His jaw tightened.

Before he could respond, the office door swung open—and in walked Alexander Whitmore, his presence instantly shifting the air in the room.

Ethan stiffened.

Alexander’s sharp eyes flicked between them.

"Am I interrupting?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly.

Perfect timing.

Because this conversation was over.

"You're my assistant, and our interactions should remain strictly professional," Alexander stated firmly, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Vanessa let out a soft, knowing laugh. "I joined Titan Capital Group for my career, nothing more."

"Then explain the blind date with Ryan," Alexander countered, his voice edged with irritation. "Was that just a coincidence, or were you trying to get under my skin?"

Evelyn stiffened. "Am I not allowed to move on after our breakup?"

"Of course you can," he snapped. "But Ryan is my cousin. You couldn’t have picked anyone else? Or is there something going on between you two?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Ryan appeared, his presence calm but deliberate. He stepped closer, subtly guiding Evelyn to stand beside him.

Alexander’s jaw tightened as he watched them, an unfamiliar heat flaring in his chest.

Ryan met his gaze evenly. "Alexander, Evelyn and I went on that date because I pursued her. Surely you understand what that means."

Alexander’s expression darkened. "Explain."

A faint smile touched Ryan’s lips. "I intend to be Evelyn’s boyfriend."

The words barely registered before Alexander’s fist shot out, striking Ryan square across the face.

The punch came out of nowhere, sending Alexander reeling backward from the unexpected blow.

Ryan didn't hesitate—he swung back immediately, fists flying.

Evelyn stood frozen, her mind struggling to process the sudden violence unfolding before her.

By the time she snapped out of her shock, Alexander and Ryan were already locked in a brutal brawl.

Their knuckles connected with sickening thuds, leaving angry red marks and swelling on both their faces.

The hotel manager rushed forward, shouting for security to intervene, but neither man backed down.

One of Ryan's expensive loafers went flying, and Alexander retaliated by yanking his tie loose, nearly choking him.

"What the hell did you just say? Say it again!" Alexander snarled.

"I said I want Evelyn. If that pisses you off, then hit me! Come on, you coward!"

Ryan's smirk was pure provocation, his words deliberately calculated to enrage Alexander further.

Evelyn finally understood—Ryan had been right all along. These two men were never going to coexist peacefully.

The whispers and sideways glances from the growing crowd burned against her skin.

The tension between the two men was palpable, their fists clenched as they circled each other.

"Is this about a woman?" someone in the crowd whispered.

"Definitely. He wants her, but she's clearly into someone else. That's why they're at each other's throats."

"Trouble follows beauty, doesn't it?"

The hotel manager, flustered, reached for his phone to call security.

Evelyn snatched a plate from the table and smashed it onto the marble floor with a sharp crack. "Enough! Have you both lost your minds?"

She had simply come here for dinner—not to be dragged into some ridiculous spectacle.

How dare they use her as the reason for their brawl?

Her gaze swept over the murmuring onlookers. "This isn't some petty love triangle! They're the ones in a relationship—and they're ending it!"

The air thickened with tension as Alexander and Ethan glared at each other, neither willing to back down.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her patience wearing thin. "If you two want to destroy each other, do it somewhere else."

The crowd erupted into hushed whispers.

A server nervously inched forward to clean up the shattered porcelain.

Evelyn turned on her heel, ready to leave the chaos behind.

But then—

A hand caught her wrist.

Alexander's voice was low, rough with emotion. "You don't get to walk away from this."

Her pulse spiked.

Ethan scoffed. "She doesn’t owe you anything."

The standoff reignited, fiercer than before.

Evelyn yanked her arm free. "I’m not your prize to fight over."

The words hung in the air, sharp and final.

Then—

A glass shattered somewhere in the distance.

The manager finally arrived with security.

"Gentlemen," he said firmly, "take this outside, or I’ll have you removed."

For a heartbeat, no one moved.

Then Alexander stepped back, jaw tight.

Ethan smirked, victorious.

Evelyn didn’t wait to see what happened next.

She walked out, the weight of their stares burning into her back.

But one thought echoed in her mind—

This wasn’t over.

Not even close.
###Chapter 88 Look at Me

The entire restaurant froze in shock.

What an explosive revelation!

Ryan Fletcher and Ethan Caldwell, who had been brawling moments ago, suddenly went still.

Vanessa Hart watched the stunned hotel manager with narrowed eyes. "Call the police. Make sure they pay for the damages. These idiots deserve to rot in jail!"

She snatched up her purse, adding coldly, "And the bill for my meal? Charge it to them."

Without another word, Vanessa turned on her heel and strode out of the restaurant, leaving behind a room full of bewildered spectators.

The two men finally broke apart, breathing heavily.

Ryan wiped his split lip, glaring at Ethan. "What the hell are you doing?"

Ethan smirked, despite his bruised face. "You dumped her. You don’t get to decide who pursues her now."

His gaze flickered toward the exit where Vanessa had disappeared, and he moved to follow.

Ryan’s hand shot out, gripping Ethan’s arm. "Stay away from her."

Ethan yanked free, his grin widening. "Or what?"

The tension crackled between them, the air thick with unspoken threats.

Vanessa was long gone—but the battle for her attention had only just begun.

"Ethan, do you regret it? But you already have a fiancée!"

"How vibrant and captivating Evelyn is! Even if I don't pursue her, there are countless men fighting for her attention. Just swallow your pride!"

Ryan stormed out of the restaurant without another word.

Ethan scoffed, his grip tightening around his glass. "Damn it! Who does he think he is?"

By the time Ryan reached the street, Evelyn had already vanished.

Dark clouds gathered overhead, threatening to unleash a storm.

Not wanting to get caught in the rain, Evelyn quickly hailed a cab and headed home.

The moment she stepped inside, a deafening crack of thunder split the sky.

Meanwhile, Alexander, who had been deep in conversation with a prominent investor, suddenly turned his gaze toward the window.

Heavy raindrops pelted against the glass, sliding down like shimmering beads. The relentless thunder rumbled, pulling his attention away from the discussion.

"Mr. Whitmore, is everything alright?"

The middle-aged businessman swirled his wine glass, eyeing Alexander curiously.

Alexander barely registered the question. His mind was elsewhere—on Evelyn.

Had she made it home safely?

The storm outside mirrored the turmoil in his chest.

He needed to see her. Now.

Without another word, Alexander excused himself and strode toward the exit, leaving his bewildered companion behind.

The downpour intensified as he stepped outside, but he barely noticed.

All he could think about was her.

And the fact that Ryan had dared to speak to her at all.

His jaw clenched.

This wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

The rain pattered against the windows as Alexander tried calling Evelyn again. Still no answer.

Something felt off.

He grabbed his coat from the chair and strode out without another word.

"Mr. Whitmore, we can reschedule the rest for tomorrow," Simon said, glancing at the storm outside. "It's getting late, and my dog hates thunderstorms."

When Alexander arrived home, the scent of garlic and herbs greeted him.

Evelyn stood in the kitchen, balancing on one foot while stirring a pot of spaghetti. Steam curled around her as she lifted a spoon to her lips, testing the sauce.

Fresh from the shower, she wore a thin white nightgown, her damp hair tumbling over her shoulders.

The moment she turned and saw him, she startled, nearly dropping the spoon.

"You're back already?" Her eyes flicked to the clock. "I only made enough for one."

"I ate earlier." He shrugged off his coat, gaze briefly dropping to her wrapped ankle before settling on the pasta. "This is your dinner?"

Evelyn nodded, stirring the noodles with a proud little smile. "Carbs, veggies, and protein. Perfect balance, right?"

The storm outside rumbled, but the kitchen felt strangely warm.

Alexander didn’t move.

Neither did she.

Evelyn settled at the table with her plate of spaghetti, twirling the noodles around her fork.

Alexander's gaze lingered on her slender frame, his brow furrowing slightly.

"Have you been eating more sweets lately?"

She lifted her chin with a proud smile. "Actually, I gained nearly a pound this week!"

"That'll disappear after one trip to the bathroom."

Without another word, he strode to the refrigerator, pulled out a carton of milk, and peeled off the plastic seal. He poured it into a small saucepan, turning on the stove to warm it.

Evelyn nearly choked on her food, staring at him in disbelief.

"What?" he asked, glancing over his shoulder.

She swallowed hard, then set her fork down. "Mr. Whitmore, I didn’t expect someone like you to say something so... blunt."

His dark eyes locked onto hers. "Someone like me? What exactly do you think I am?"

She tilted her head, studying him. "Untouchable. Like some distant, unapproachable deity who doesn’t bother with mundane things."

A low chuckle escaped him as he stirred the milk. "That’s just your imagination. I eat, sleep, and use the toilet like everyone else. I’m just a man."

The milk in the saucepan began to froth, tiny bubbles breaking the surface.

With practiced ease, Alexander turned off the burner before it could boil over.

He poured the steaming liquid into a porcelain mug, the rich aroma filling the kitchen.

The drink was perfectly warmed—not scalding, just soothing heat radiating through the ceramic. A delicate swirl of vapor curled upward as he carried it to Evelyn.

"I'm not some unfeeling machine, Evelyn. I have needs. Desires." His voice was low, measured.

He settled beside her at the breakfast nook, his forearm resting casually on the marble countertop. The sunlight streaming through the windows caught the gold in his wedding band.

When he leaned in suddenly, his cologne—something expensive with sandalwood notes—wrapped around her. Evelyn's fingers tightened around the mug.

"That distance you sense?" His gaze pinned her in place. "It's because you're still learning who I really am."

A beat of silence. Then, with deliberate emphasis:

"As my wife, you should be attuned to me. To us."

He tilted his head, studying her reaction. "Ask yourself—do we truly belong in the same world?"

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting those piercing eyes over the rim of her mug. The reflection in his dark irises showed her own uncertain expression staring back.

###Chapter 89 What Are You Planning?

Perhaps it was the warmth of the spiced cocoa or Alexander's deep voice, but Evelyn's face flushed crimson.

He stood just outside the lamplight's glow, his broad chest rising and falling with each steady breath.

The space between them was intimate—close enough for her to trace the outline of his toned muscles beneath the fabric of his shirt.

Lightning cracked across the sky once more.

Without warning, his arms encircled her, pulling her against him.

Evelyn melted into Alexander's embrace, her senses overwhelmed.

The faint aroma of aged whiskey clung to his dark sweater, intoxicating her.

His lips grazed her temple in a featherlight kiss, sending her pulse into a frenzy.

The storm raged beyond the windows, sealing them in their own private world.

In the dimly lit room, Alexander cradled the back of her head, guiding her onto his lap as their lips met in a searing kiss.

The mingling scents of whiskey and cinnamon filled the air as their breathing grew uneven.

His expert fingers traced patterns that made her knees buckle. The sensations were intoxicating, threatening to unravel her completely.

Her pulse raced wildly. She clung to Alexander like a drowning woman, with no hope of escape.

Occasionally, she caught glimpses of herself in the mirrored surface of the liquor cabinet.

The reflection startled her—she barely recognized the woman staring back.

But this was her husband. This was allowed. This was right.

Alexander guided her backward, his mouth never leaving hers, hands firm on her waist.

The soft mattress met her back as he lowered her gently onto the bed.

In the darkness, Evelyn heard the sharp click of a belt buckle. The sound jolted her upright like an electric shock.

The bedroom was swallowed in shadows, only a sliver of golden light creeping through the doorway from the living room.

Alexander's voice was rough with desire. "Nervous?"

She met his gaze but said nothing. Instead, she swung her legs over the edge of the bed, her bare feet hitting the cool hardwood.

Alexander arched an eyebrow, watching with amused curiosity as Evelyn dashed toward the liquor cabinet.

She snatched up a half-empty bottle of bourbon, uncorked it, and took a deep swig.

Her cheeks flushed instantly.

She was still untouched, after all. If she wanted this night to be unforgettable, liquid courage was her best ally.

"You have to stand out," Claire had whispered during their midnight call. "Countless women have thrown themselves at Alexander. Be different. Make sure he never forgets you."

Evelyn had hesitated, gripping her phone tighter. "How?"

Claire’s laughter had been mischievous. "Trust me. Just follow your instincts."

The memory alone made Evelyn bury her face in her hands, heat creeping up her neck.

Now, with the alcohol burning through her veins, she turned back toward the bedroom.

Alexander lounged against the headboard, one arm bent behind his head, his gaze dark and assessing.

The bourbon hit fast.

Her pulse thundered, but her mind stayed sharp.

She took a deliberate step forward.

Then another.

Her fingers curled into the hem of her shirt.

Alexander’s lips curved.

"Evelyn," he murmured, voice low. "What do you want to do?"

She exhaled shakily.

"Something unforgettable."

Her fingers curled around the silk tie, yanking it free with a sharp tug.

Alexander's lips curved into an amused smirk as Evelyn wound the fabric twice around his wrist, securing it with deliberate precision. The knot tightened, rendering his hands immobile—and she had the audacity to finish it with a neat bow.

"Mrs. Whitmore?" His voice held a mix of surprise and dark amusement.

The tip of his tongue pressed against his cheek, that infuriatingly knowing smile never fading.

"So this is your game?" His voice dropped to a husky murmur. "I never took you for the type to enjoy restraints."

Without the tie, his shirt gaped open, revealing the sharp lines of his collarbones. The sight of him—bound, sprawled across the bed with deceptive submission—shouldn’t have been so arresting.

Yet it was.

Evelyn’s pulse thrummed wildly, but there was no retreating now.

Her chilled fingertips traced the curve of his lips, her gaze clouded with something reckless.

Then she leaned in, her breath mingling with his.

"Hush."

The word was a whisper, a command, a plea—all at once.

The alcohol made Evelyn's head spin. She meant to press her lips against Alexander's, but her aim was off—her kiss landed on the strong curve of his throat instead.

She felt the hard swallow beneath her mouth, heard his ragged breath above her. When she lifted her gaze, his darkened eyes held hers with an intensity that made her pulse stutter.

"Now," she murmured, her words slow and deliberate from the champagne, "I can do anything I want to you."

Alexander's brow arched, a smirk playing at his lips. "Is that so, Mrs. Whitmore?" His voice dropped to a rough whisper. "Then tell me—exactly what are your intentions?"

The challenge in his tone sent a thrill down her spine.

###Chapter 90 Passionate Storm

The night erupted with a deafening crack of thunder, shaking the windows. Rain lashed against the glass, tracing winding paths before pooling on the hardwood floor.

Inside, the atmosphere was anything but calm.

Alexander Whitmore found himself pressed into the mattress, the weight of Evelyn Carter above him. The dim glow from the living room spilled across the bed, casting long shadows that danced with the storm outside.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into the fabric of his shirt, her grip surprisingly strong for someone so delicate. She exhaled shakily, her dark lashes fluttering as she leaned in.

Her lips met his—soft, hesitant, tasting faintly of wine.

It wasn’t so much a kiss as it was an exploration. Each press of her mouth was punctuated by a quiet, almost comical mwah, like a child learning how affection worked.

Alexander should have laughed.

Instead, his fingers twitched against the sheets, his pulse roaring louder than the storm outside.

Her innocence was maddening.

And yet, with every clumsy attempt, the fire in his gaze burned hotter.

They were right—the most innocent teasing could be the most dangerous.

Evelyn had been playfully nipping at Alexander like a curious kitten, completely unaware of the fire she was stoking.

After what felt like an eternity of her hesitant, teasing bites, Alexander finally snapped.

His restraint shattered in an instant.

With one swift motion, he freed his wrists from her grasp, flipped her beneath him, and caged her body with his own.

The sudden reversal drew a startled gasp from Evelyn. "Ah!"

Alexander had indulged in a few drinks that evening—not enough to be drunk, but just enough to lower his inhibitions.

Now, his gaze burned with the predatory intensity of a man who had reached his limit.

He dipped his head, catching her lower lip between his teeth in a slow, deliberate bite before murmuring, "You're still a little clumsy at this, Mrs. Whitmore. Allow me to demonstrate."

His voice was rough, laced with dark promise.

Then he shifted, bracing himself above her, their fingers tangling together as he pinned her hands beside her head.

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed, her heart hammering so violently she was certain he could feel it.

She had never been good at this—never been bold, never been in control.

And now, with Alexander's warm breath ghosting over her skin as he traced the shell of her ear with his tongue, she was utterly at his mercy.

A shiver tore through her, electric and overwhelming, her fingers tightening reflexively around his.

She was drowning in sensation, every nerve alight.

And Alexander had only just begun.

The kiss was electrifying, sending waves of heat through her body. Evelyn's pulse quickened, her breaths turning shallow and uneven.

"Alexander." The alcohol had softened her voice, making it velvety and warm, like a contented feline. Yet there was an undeniable allure in her tone.

Her arms wound around his neck, fingers tangling in his hair as she let out a soft, satisfied sigh.

Alexander glanced down at her flushed face, his lips curving into a knowing smirk. "Mrs. Whitmore, wasn't it you who said you'd do whatever you wanted with me?"

He dipped his head, brushing his lips against the sensitive skin of her throat. His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Already overwhelmed? How do you plan to take charge later?"

Evelyn bit her lower lip, her fingers tightening slightly against his shoulders. A deep blush spread across her cheeks.

The room was thick with tension, their mingled breaths creating an intoxicating rhythm. It was as if two flames had merged, burning brighter and fiercer together.

Outside, the rain fell in a steady rhythm, harmonizing with the sounds of their passion.

Evelyn sank deeper into the plush mattress, her body arching with every movement. Her toes curled against the sheets, her breath hitching.

Alexander was relentless, his stamina seemingly endless.

Every brush of Alexander's lips against Evelyn's skin left a trail of pink blossoms across her flawless body.

He adored the way her back arched instinctively, each movement fueling the wildfire of his desire until it burned uncontrollably.

Tears shimmered in Evelyn's eyes as she surrendered to him, blooming like a rare flower beneath his relentless devotion throughout the endless night.

Dawn crept in before Alexander finally released her, though his reluctance was palpable in every lingering touch.

The hours blurred together—Evelyn lost track of how many times he claimed her. When she finally collapsed onto the sheets, every muscle trembled with delicious exhaustion.

Her eyelids fluttered shut, mind reeling. She had never imagined passion could be explored in so many intoxicating ways.

The bedposts, the marble counter in the bathroom, the velvet chaise lounge—those were merely the beginning. There had been... more.

Once Evelyn drifted into sleep, Alexander stepped onto the balcony, lighting a cigarette with a slow, satisfied drag.

Smoke curled from his lips as his gaze lingered on her peaceful form tangled in the sheets. A smug smile tugged at his mouth.

Then his expression darkened with a sudden thought. Stubbing out the cigarette, he returned to the bedroom and retrieved a small tube from the nightstand—

The first aid kit lay open beside them.

In the darkness of the room, Alexander carefully cradled Evelyn's ankle, his fingers brushing over the jagged scar that marred her delicate skin. His gaze lingered there, heavy with unspoken emotions.

A shadow of pain flickered across Alexander's face, followed by something softer—something tender.

He had known about the scar, but he hadn't realized how deeply it still affected her. Every time the rain fell, the old wound ached, a cruel reminder of the past.

With slow, deliberate movements, Alexander smoothed the ointment over her skin, his touch feather-light.

He treated her like something fragile, something irreplaceable.

Every stroke of his fingers was a silent vow—a promise to protect her, to cherish her.

The storm outside raged on, but in this quiet moment, there was only warmth.

Only them.
###Chapter 91 No Freaking Way!

Dawn barely touched the horizon when Evelyn Carter jolted awake, her body aching from last night's passion.

The digital clock mocked her—only three hours of restless sleep.

The other side of the bed was cold. Alexander had slipped out unnoticed, leaving nothing but the memory of his touch.

Rain had painted the city all night, and now the crisp scent of petrichor drifted through the half-open window.

Her gaze dropped to the floor.

Shredded fabric—his shirt, her dress—lay in tangled heaps, silent witnesses to their reckless abandon.

Heat flooded her cheeks as flashes of skin, whispered promises, and desperate kisses replayed in her mind.

God, Alexander...

She scrambled for her phone.

9:47 AM.

Her stomach dropped.

"Are you kidding me?" she hissed, snatching her scattered clothes.

He couldn’t have shaken her awake before leaving? Two hours late. The entire morning—gone.

She bolted out the door, her heels clicking furiously against marble.

By the time she slid into her office chair, her pulse still hadn’t steadied.

Natalie Brooks leaned in, eyes gleaming with mischief. "So. You know Simon Graves?"

Evelyn froze.

Oh no.

“Hmm?” Evelyn blinked in confusion.

Natalie leaned closer, lowering her voice. “The moment I arrived this morning, Simon mentioned you weren’t feeling well and had requested leave through him. Do you two… talk outside of work?”

Evelyn’s cheeks warmed. She knew Alexander was behind this but only offered a vague nod.

Natalie arched a brow but didn’t press further, leaving Evelyn to focus on her work.

By lunchtime, the office had emptied as colleagues headed to the cafeteria. Evelyn, having arrived late, was still wrapping up her tasks.

The moment she finished, she looked up to find Simon standing at her desk, his expression unreadable. “Mr. Whitmore would like to see you, Mrs. Whitmore.”

Alexander’s office was as expansive as ever, but the rich aroma of food immediately enveloped her the second she stepped inside.

Their eyes met, and Evelyn’s pulse fluttered.

Alexander, however, was the picture of calm. He ladled steaming soup into her bowl, his voice smooth. “Eat. You’ve lost weight.”

He motioned for her to sit, effortlessly rearranging the dishes so the most nutritious ones were within her reach.

Evelyn’s gaze swept over the table, and her breath caught. Every single dish—every flavor—was something she adored.

Her heart swelled.

The sun streamed through the windows of Titan Capital Group’s office, casting a warm glow over the stacks of documents spread across Evelyn Carter’s desk.

She couldn’t shake the thought—was Alexander Whitmore’s taste really this aligned with hers?

“Did you review the files I sent you yesterday?” His deep voice cut through her musings.

Evelyn nodded, flipping open the folder. “Horizon Enterprises wants this acquisition because of one particular game in their portfolio. The potential is undeniable.”

Alexander leaned back in his chair, his piercing gaze fixed on her. “And your take?”

She exhaled. “We shouldn’t move too fast. Their financials are a mess—three straight years of losses. If Titan Capital dives in without caution, we’ll be the ones left cleaning up the wreckage.”

A slow smirk curved his lips. “So, what’s your next step?”

“First, we analyze the game’s projected revenue. If the numbers justify it, we proceed. If not…” She trailed off, tapping her pen against the desk.

Alexander cut in smoothly. “Their losses stem from legal payouts, not the game itself. Strip that away, and it’s profitable. Not to mention, three other firms are already circling.”

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She’d missed that detail entirely.

And there he was, handing her the missing piece—without a single I told you so.

Her fingers tightened around the pen.

Damn him.

Evelyn set her fork down, already reaching for the documents. "Since Titan Capital Group has competitors, we should move fast before another company snatches the opportunity."

Alexander caught her wrist, his grip firm but gentle. "Slow down. Finish your meal first."

"But—" She hesitated, meeting his piercing gaze.

His dark eyes trailed over her before he remarked, "Look at you, practically disappearing. Weren't you the one insisting on clinging to me?"

A smirk played on his lips. "I prefer a woman with curves, Mrs. Whitmore."

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks, but determination flared in her chest. She picked up her fork again and polished off two full plates this time.

As she ate, her thoughts raced. I’m not letting anyone else get close to Alexander.

Absolutely not!

###Chapter 92 The Unexpected Assignment

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across Evelyn's desk when she returned to find an email notification blinking insistently. The subject line read: Annual Gala – Department Participation Required.

A wave of excitement should have followed—after all, the annual gala was one of Titan Capital Group’s most anticipated events. But instead, an odd tension hung thick in the executive suite.

Frowning, Evelyn glanced around. "Why does everyone look like they’ve just been handed a death sentence?"

Natalie exhaled dramatically, leaning back in her chair. "Because every year, each department has to perform something at the gala. And every year, we humiliate ourselves."

Daniel nodded grimly. "We don’t exactly have a talent pool here."

Evelyn blinked. "What did you guys do last year?"

Cassandra groaned, burying her face in her hands. "Oh god, don’t remind me."

Natalie shuddered. "We drew straws."

Evelyn’s brows shot up. "And?"

Cassandra peeked through her fingers. "And let’s just say Simon’s rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody still haunts my nightmares."

A beat of silence. Then—

Evelyn burst out laughing.

Natalie shot her a glare. "It’s not funny! The marketing department had a full jazz band. HR did a Hamilton medley. And we? We had Simon screeching Galileo while Daniel attempted air guitar."

Daniel winced. "I still have flashbacks."

Evelyn wiped her eyes, still grinning. "Okay, but what’s the plan this year?"

Natalie sighed. "That’s the problem. We don’t have one."

Cassandra groaned again. "We could always just skip it."

Daniel shook his head. "Mr. Whitmore already said no. He wants all departments represented."

Evelyn tapped her chin. "What if we do something simple? Like… a skit?"

Natalie perked up. "A skit?"

Evelyn nodded. "Something short, funny. No singing required."

Cassandra hesitated. "But who’s writing it?"

Silence.

Then, slowly, all eyes turned to Evelyn.

She froze. "Oh no. No, no, no—"

Natalie grinned. "You are the newest hire."

Daniel nodded solemnly. "It’s tradition."

Evelyn groaned. "I walked right into this, didn’t I?"

Cassandra patted her shoulder. "Welcome to the team."

Evelyn sighed, defeated. "Fine. But if this backfires, I’m blaming all of you."

Natalie smirked. "Deal."

As Evelyn opened a blank document, one thought echoed in her mind:

What have I gotten myself into?

The office buzzed with nervous energy as the annual company talent show loomed closer.

"I still can't believe we got last place last year," Natalie groaned, slumping in her chair. "And I was the poor soul who had to recite poetry. It felt like a kindergarten recital."

Victoria blinked, momentarily at a loss for words.

Evelyn bit her lip, guilt flashing across her face. "This is all my fault. I embarrassed our entire department!"

Meanwhile, Cassandra had already torn sheets of paper into strips, scribbling names. "Enough whining. Let's draw lots again this year."

"Wait!" Evelyn suddenly turned to Victoria, eyes bright with hope. "Do you have any hidden talents?"

"Me?" Victoria froze.

A memory surfaced—her fingers gliding over cello strings, music swelling around her. But that was before...before everything.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, Cassandra cut in with a smirk. "No need for drawing. Victoria will represent us this year. She plays the cello."

Victoria's head snapped up, shock rippling through her. How did Cassandra know? She hadn't touched her instrument in years.

Natalie whooped, clapping her hands. "No way! You play cello? This changes everything! We might actually place this year!"

Victoria's shoulders hunched as her fingers curled into her palms. "I...I don't play anymore." The lie tasted bitter.

Victoria's face darkened instantly. "Don't play dumb with me. I saw you leaving the music room with my own eyes. This isn't just about you—it's about our department's reputation. Are you really going to let everyone down?"

Her voice was sharp, laced with accusation. She had been on her coffee break when she'd spotted Evelyn exiting the room, cello case in hand.

Just then, the office door swung open.

Alexander stepped out, followed closely by Simon, who carried a sleek briefcase and a laptop. They looked ready for an off-site meeting.

As they walked away, Evelyn's phone buzzed.

A message from Alexander: [I'd give anything to hear you play the cello again.]

Her breath hitched. Did he overhear us?

As the workday neared its end, Victoria dropped a thick stack of files onto Evelyn's desk. "Deliver these to the Marketing Department's manager. Immediately."

Evelyn frowned. Marketing Department manager? That's Ethan.

Daniel knew exactly who she was—and more importantly, the tangled history between her and Alexander.

The moment Evelyn saw the stack of documents, she knew exactly what was coming.

Daniel, ever the gentleman, immediately stepped forward. "I'm heading that way anyway. I can drop them off."

Victoria shook her head. "They specifically requested Evelyn to deliver these."

Evelyn clenched her jaw but took the files without protest. As she walked toward the Marketing Department, her heels echoed sharply against the marble floors.

She dropped the documents on the reception desk, already turning to leave.

The receptionist cleared her throat. "Mr. Ethan Caldwell asked that you bring them directly to his office."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Of course he did.

She knocked once before pushing the door open—only to freeze at the sight before her.

Vanessa was perched on Ethan’s lap, her arms looped around his neck. Their lips were locked in a heated kiss, completely oblivious—or perhaps deliberately ignoring—her presence.

Evelyn stood there, watching them for a long, silent moment.

Then, as if sensing her gaze, Ethan deepened the kiss, pulling Vanessa closer with a low, mocking groan.

The sound snapped Evelyn out of her shock.

She strode forward, slamming the documents onto his desk with enough force to make them both jolt apart.

"Is this all you wanted?" she asked, voice dripping with disdain. "A cheap show? If you're going to put on a performance, at least make it worth watching. Or are you two too scared to take it further?"

Her words hung in the air, sharp as a blade.

Vanessa’s cheeks flushed crimson, but Ethan only smirked, his fingers tightening around her waist.

Evelyn didn’t wait for a response. She turned on her heel and walked out, leaving them in stunned silence.

The door clicked shut behind her.

She didn’t look back.
###Chapter 93 An Unexpected Turn

The moment Evelyn finished speaking, she yanked out the chair across from Vanessa and Ethan and dropped into it with deliberate nonchalance.

One elbow propped on the table, chin resting in her palm, she tapped her fingers rhythmically against the wood—like an audience settling in for prime entertainment.

"Vanessa," she drawled, tilting her head, "that's not how you do it."

Her lips curled into a smirk. "Honestly, pressing your barely-there A-cups against Ethan isn't exactly persuasive. Ask him yourself if you don’t believe me."

A theatrical pause. "It’s like watching a haunted house actor trying too hard to be scary. Just... awkward."

Vanessa’s face flushed crimson as she practically launched herself off Ethan’s lap. "Evelyn, you vile witch! What the hell are you implying?!"

The truth was, she had done it on purpose.

Vanessa had come to Titan Capital Group under the pretense of inviting Ethan to dinner. But the second she reached the lobby, she spotted Evelyn stepping out of the elevator.

Her stomach had twisted instantly.

Ever since Evelyn joined Titan Capital, Vanessa hadn’t slept properly—paranoid they’d cross paths, that secrets would unravel.

And now here they were.

Evelyn, lounging like a queen, while Vanessa’s carefully constructed act crumbled.

The air between them crackled.

Ethan, caught in the middle, merely sighed and rubbed his temples.

The show, it seemed, was just beginning.

The memory still haunted her—that day when Vanessa heard Evelyn playing the cello in the music room. The very same piece Ethan had listened to during his coma after the accident.

Vanessa knew exactly what this meant.

It was Evelyn's desperate attempt to reclaim Ethan's heart.

Fear gripped Vanessa tighter than ever before. No one understood better than her that her entire relationship with Ethan had been built upon that haunting melody.

What if he discovered the truth? That it had been Evelyn playing all those years ago? The thought sent chills down her spine.

Paranoid that disaster might strike before the wedding, Vanessa had been visiting more frequently, watching Evelyn like a hawk.

Now, Evelyn met Vanessa's furious glare with icy calm. "Done pretending?" she asked, her voice sharp. "Careful with your words, Vanessa. Your sweet little act is crumbling."

Vanessa froze, her gaze flickering instinctively toward Ethan.

His expression darkened with suspicion.

Panic flared in her chest. Her eyes welled up instantly, and she clutched Ethan's sleeve with trembling fingers, her voice softening to a whisper. "Ethan… don’t listen to her. She’s lying."

But Ethan had already seen through her.

And this time, he wasn’t playing along.

Lately, Ethan couldn't shake the feeling that Evelyn had transformed into someone unrecognizable. The way she brushed him off so casually unsettled him deeply.

That was precisely why he'd asked her to deliver those documents—though he never anticipated Vanessa tagging along.

The moment Vanessa stepped into his office, she draped herself over him like a second skin. Ethan had been buried in work, in no mood for her antics.

Yet, curiosity gnawed at him. What would Evelyn do if she saw them like this?

The old Evelyn would have erupted—he was certain of it.

But the explosion never came. Instead, he caught the flicker of amusement in Evelyn's gaze, as if she found the whole scene laughable.

A strange, hollow sensation settled in his chest.

It struck him then—Evelyn had truly moved on.

His mind reeled. How? The woman who'd written him letters from prison, who'd loved him with such fierce devotion—how could she just... stop?

Evelyn checked her phone, lips curving into a smile. "Don't mind me," she said, waving a hand. "By all means, continue."

Then she turned and walked away—no hesitation, no backward glance.

Ethan Caldwell's expression darkened. "Don't you dare walk away, Evelyn! Did I give you permission to leave?"

Evelyn halted mid-step and turned slowly, her gaze icy. "The documents are already in your hands. Or do you actually intend to put on a performance for me right here?"

"Who told you they were delivered?" Ethan snatched the files from the desk and flung them into the nearby trash bin without hesitation. "I decide when they're delivered. Evelyn, do you realize the consequences if these files go missing?"

Instead of arguing, Evelyn calmly retrieved her phone.

She activated the camera, panning across Ethan's office before zooming in on the discarded documents in the bin.

"They were delivered the moment I handed them to you," she said coolly, waving her phone. "And now I have proof."

With that, she turned on her heel, her stilettos clicking decisively against the marble floor as she strode toward the exit.

Ethan lunged forward, intent on stopping her—

But just then—
###Chapter 94 Trying to Impress Me?

The moment Evelyn saw what was happening, her blood boiled. Without hesitation, she grabbed the bouquet of thorny roses and hurled them straight at Alexander's head.

The flowers flew through the air with a whoosh, petals scattering everywhere as they collided with Alexander's perfectly styled hair. Crimson petals rained down like drops of blood onto the marble floor.

Several leaves got tangled in Alexander's dark locks, making the usually composed businessman look utterly ridiculous. A single thorn even left a faint scratch on his forehead.

Outside the partially open office door, curious employees pressed their ears against the glass, their excited whispers filling the hallway.

"Alexander, have you no shame?" Evelyn crossed her arms, her emerald eyes flashing with fury. "Harassing a woman in her own office? Some CEO of Horizon Enterprises you are."

The public humiliation made Alexander's face darken like a thundercloud. His jaw clenched so tight she could see the muscle twitching.

"Who invited you here, Evelyn?" he spat through gritted teeth. "Get out before I call security."

Evelyn merely smirked, tilting her head. "Oh sweetheart, since when do I take orders from you?"

Enraged, Alexander swung his fist toward her face. But Evelyn was quicker - she dodged with practiced ease, her ponytail whipping through the air.

"Is this how you treat all your business partners?" she taunted, circling him like a predator. "No wonder Titan Capital's stocks are plummeting."

The insult hit its mark. Alexander's nostrils flared as he advanced toward her, his expensive shoes crushing the fallen rose petals beneath them.

Evelyn braced herself, ready for whatever came next. This wasn't over - not by a long shot.

The air crackled with tension as Ryan Fletcher cracked his knuckles. "Still sore from yesterday's beating? Bring it on, cousin! I'm ready for round two!"

Chaos erupted instantly in the office space. Vanessa Hart fluttered around them like a distressed butterfly, her shrill voice cutting through the noise.

Outside, curious colleagues pressed against the glass but dared not intervene. Everyone knew Ryan's temper - and his family connections. The Fletcher-Whitmore feuds were legendary, dating back to their boarding school days.

Vanessa, failing to separate the brawling men, whirled on Evelyn with venom in her eyes. "Satisfied now, Evelyn? Two men destroying the office over you? The tabloids will have a field day with this! How will you show your face at Titan Capital tomorrow?"

Evelyn didn't flinch. With deliberate calm, she strode to the door and slammed it shut with such force that the glass panes rattled. The disappointed audience outside scattered like startled pigeons.

Returning to the scene, she scooped up the ruined bouquet from the floor - its petals now scattered like battlefield casualties. Without hesitation, she swung the battered flowers, smacking both men squarely on their backsides.

"If you're determined to act like animals," she said icily, "take it to the zoo. Every time you pull this stunt, people assume you're competing for my attention." The crushed roses dripped from her grip like bloodied evidence. "And gentlemen? You lost that privilege long ago."

The tension between Ethan Caldwell and Ryan Fletcher dissipated instantly.

Ethan scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain. "Win you over? In your dreams."

Ryan shot him a sharp glare. "If you're not trying, then I will."

Without hesitation, Ryan leaned in closer to Evelyn Carter, his injured face inches from hers. The bruise on his cheekbone stood out starkly against his tanned skin, and a faint trace of blood lingered at the corner of his lips.

"Would you mind accompanying me to the hospital?" His voice was smooth, almost teasing. "I could use some medical attention—and your company."

Evelyn didn’t even entertain the thought. "Not a chance."

The brawl between Ethan and Ryan in the office had been swiftly buried under strict orders.

No one in the Marketing Department dared to breathe a word—not with Ethan’s ironclad authority looming over them. The incident vanished into silence.

Later, as Evelyn finished her work and stepped into the elevator, she spotted Ryan’s obnoxiously bright yellow Lamborghini parked right at the building’s entrance.

It was peak rush hour, employees streaming out in waves.

Yet there he was, leaning dramatically against the car door, drawing every eye in the vicinity. The gash on his cheekbone was impossible to miss, the faint crimson at his mouth only adding to his reckless charm.

He might as well have been holding a neon sign.

Evelyn rolled her eyes and quickened her pace, determined to slip past unnoticed.

But Ryan, ever persistent, caught sight of her immediately. His lips curved into that infuriating smirk.

"Running away, Evelyn?" he called out, loud enough for half the lobby to hear. "Or are you just afraid of what might happen if you stay?"

She didn’t dignify that with a response.

But the challenge in his voice sent a flicker of irritation through her.

This wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.

Ryan Fletcher stood outside Titan Capital Group's headquarters like a striking statue, impossible to miss. His tailored navy suit hugged his broad shoulders perfectly, drawing curious glances from every passerby.

Yet Ryan appeared completely unaware of the attention. The moment Evelyn Carter stepped out of the glass doors, he moved swiftly, intercepting her path.

His voice dropped to a low, velvety murmur. "I'm injured. Think you could take me to the hospital?"

Before Evelyn could protest, he pressed his car keys into her palm, his fingers brushing hers just enough to send an unexpected jolt through her.

She tried to shove them back, but Ryan had already slid into the passenger seat, buckling up with an infuriating smirk.

Heat crept up her neck as she noticed their audience—colleagues from the executive floor emerging from the building, their gazes flickering between them.

Flustered, Evelyn practically leaped into the driver's seat. The second she spotted Victoria Sloan and Natalie Brooks whispering near the entrance, she slammed her foot on the accelerator, peeling away from the curb with a screech of tires.

The car hadn't even merged into traffic when Ryan's chuckle filled the space between them. "Didn't realize you were in such a hurry to be alone with me."

Evelyn's grip on the steering wheel tightened. This man would be the death of her.
###Chapter 95 Your Uncle’s Wife

Ryan was being insufferable, complaining endlessly about a minor scrape.

By the time they stepped out of the hospital, the clock had already struck eight in the evening.

Ryan suggested taking Evelyn out for dinner, but she declined with a polite smile, citing the late hour.

As he drove her home, the city lights streaked past the windows like golden ribbons. The cool night air rushed in, tangling her loose strands of hair with the seatbelt draped across her chest.

Ryan’s usually sharp features softened under the dim glow of the dashboard lights, his tousled hair giving him an unexpectedly tender appearance.

"You know," he said, flashing her a mischievous grin, "if you pretended to be my girlfriend, we could drive Alexander absolutely insane. Doesn’t that sound fun?"

Evelyn remained silent, her gaze fixed on the passing scenery outside.

Finally, she turned to him, her expression unreadable. "I believe I already told you—I’d rather team up with Alexander than play along with your little scheme. Not only would it infuriate him, but I’d also get the pleasure of becoming your elder."

Ryan laughed, but there was a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes.

The car slowed to a stop in front of her apartment building.

Evelyn unbuckled her seatbelt and reached for the door handle.

"Think about it," Ryan called after her as she stepped out. "The look on his face would be priceless."

She didn’t look back as she walked away, but the ghost of a smirk tugged at her lips.

Ryan Fletcher frowned, his expression skeptical. "I'll admit you're attractive, but Alexander Whitmore has a reputation for keeping women at arm's length."

Evelyn Carter arched a brow, amusement flickering in her eyes. "Not into women? Then who kept me awake until dawn last night?"

The memory sent a shiver down her spine, her knees weakening slightly as a delicate flush crept up her neck. She absently touched her lips, still tingling from the phantom sensation of his kiss.

As the car neared her apartment complex, she reached for the seatbelt buckle, fingers deftly releasing the clasp.

Ryan leaned forward, curiosity sharpening his tone. "Even if you're serious about Alexander, how do you plan to get close to him? The man is practically carved from ice."

Evelyn smirked, stepping out of the car with effortless grace. "I'm his employee now. We share the same office, the same meetings. Opportunities have a way of presenting themselves." She shot him a knowing glance over her shoulder. "So be ready to play your part when the time comes."

Ryan watched her retreating figure, an unexpected chuckle escaping him. "Evelyn, if this doesn’t work out, you might want to reconsider me."

She didn’t bother turning around. The idea was laughable. Dealing with Ethan Caldwell was exhausting enough—she had no intention of inviting another complication into her life.

Besides, Ryan’s sudden interest in her felt calculated. It wasn’t just about rivalry with Ethan. There was something else beneath his charming facade.

Evelyn shook her head, dismissing the thought. Some doors were better left unopened.

The words hung in the air between them, sharp and deliberate.

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning innocence as she met Ryan’s gaze with a practiced smile. "Get ready to see me become your uncle’s wife."

Ryan’s eyes widened briefly before a slow, knowing chuckle escaped him. "I thought you were just using him for his influence. But you’re actually serious about this?"

She didn’t answer. Instead, she turned on her heel and strode into the building, leaving him standing there.

The night was unusually still, the neighborhood wrapped in silence. The elevator doors slid open, empty and waiting.

Evelyn stepped inside, pressing the button for her floor.

Just as the doors began to close, a figure slipped in behind her.

She startled, her breath catching as she recognized the man now standing too close. "Ethan?" Her voice was edged with suspicion. "Are you following me?"

The moment the elevator sealed shut, his hand clamped around her wrist.

He moved fast, crowding her against the wall, his body blocking any escape.

The scent of alcohol clung to him, sharp and suffocating. His eyes, usually so controlled, burned with something reckless—something dangerous.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

This wasn’t the Ethan she knew.

This was something else entirely.

Before Evelyn could react, a strong arm suddenly encircled her waist.

Ethan pulled her against his chest with unexpected force, trapping her in an unyielding embrace.

Her breath hitched as shock coursed through her. "Let me go!"

Instinct took over. She twisted, fingers scrambling toward the elevator's emergency panel.

But Ethan was faster. His hand clamped around her wrist, pinning it against the cold metal wall.

The contrast was dizzying—the chill of steel beneath her palm, the scorching heat of his skin searing into her.

He leaned in closer.

His lips grazed her temple as his breath ghosted across her hair.

The elevator hummed around them, sealing them in this suffocating moment.

Evelyn's pulse roared in her ears.

She had to get out. Now.

But Ethan's grip only tightened, his body caging her in.

The numbers above the door continued their slow ascent.

It felt like an eternity.

Her mind raced for an escape.

Any second now, the doors would open.

Would anyone see them like this?

Would Alexander?

The thought sent a fresh wave of panic through her.

Ethan's voice was a dark whisper against her ear. "You can't run forever, Evelyn."

Her nails dug into her palms.

The elevator dinged.

Salvation or damnation—she didn't know which awaited her when those doors slid apart.
###Chapter 96 You Mean Nothing to Me

Ethan Caldwell had aimed for Evelyn Carter's lips, but she twisted away with surprising agility.

Her heel came down hard on his polished leather shoe, followed by a sharp knee aimed where it would hurt most.

Instinct made him block, forcing him to loosen his grip on her.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate—her palm cracked against his cheek with enough force to leave a sting.

She spun toward the elevator panel, fingers outstretched.

But Ethan was faster. His arms locked around her waist, hauling her back against him.

His breath was hot against her ear as he snarled, "Was the hospital visit with Ryan Fletcher just to provoke me?"

"And he drove you home?" His grip tightened. "Evelyn, you’re playing a dangerous game."

He had seen them from the office window.

Watched her slide into Ryan’s sleek Lamborghini, watched her take the wheel—

His jaw clenched.

She had never driven his car.

Never smiled at him like that.

Evelyn twisted in his hold, her voice icy. "Let. Me. Go."

Ethan didn’t.

Instead, he turned her to face him, his gaze burning. "You think Fletcher can protect you?"

Her laugh was sharp. "From you? I don’t need protection."

His fingers dug into her arms. "You belong to me."

Evelyn met his stare without flinching. "I belong to no one."

The elevator doors slid open.

Alexander Whitmore stood there, his expression darkening as he took in the scene.

Ethan didn’t release her.

Not until Alexander stepped forward, his voice lethally calm.

"Remove your hands. Now."

For a heartbeat, no one moved.

Then, with a scoff, Ethan shoved Evelyn away.

She stumbled—right into Alexander’s waiting arms.

Ethan smirked. "Enjoy your leftovers, Whitmore."

Alexander’s grip on Evelyn tightened, but she placed a hand on his chest before he could react.

Her eyes never left Ethan’s.

"You’re nothing to me," she said softly. "Not even a memory."

The elevator doors closed between them, cutting off Ethan’s furious glare.

Inside, Evelyn exhaled shakily.

Alexander’s thumb brushed her wrist. "You okay?"

She nodded, but her fingers curled into fists.

Ethan had crossed a line.

And this time—she wouldn’t let it slide.

The sleek black car sped down the road, carrying Evelyn and Ryan inside. Their laughter filled the air, carefree and bright.

From his own car, Ethan watched, his grip tightening on the steering wheel.

A bitter taste rose in his throat.

Evelyn—the woman who had chased him for seven years—was now smiling at someone else. And not just anyone. His own cousin.

The thought twisted inside him like a knife.

He barely registered Vanessa’s voice beside him, making some excuse about needing to leave. He dismissed her with a curt nod, his focus entirely on the car ahead.

He followed them, his pulse erratic, until finally, he saw Evelyn step out alone.

That was when he snapped.

Ethan strode forward, his dark eyes locking onto hers. "Is this some kind of game?" His voice was low, edged with something sharp. "You spent years chasing me, and now, suddenly, you're with him? Did you drag my cousin into this just to get back at me?"

Evelyn scoffed, crossing her arms. "You really think this is about you?" Her tone was ice. "News flash, Ethan—you stopped mattering to me a long time ago. This isn’t some petty revenge plot. I just don’t care anymore."

His jaw clenched. "Bullshit. You don’t just stop loving someone overnight."

She arched a brow. "Oh, I did. And honestly? It’s pathetic that you’re even here, acting like this means something." A dry laugh escaped her. "What, did you suddenly realize you have feelings for me?"

Ethan’s expression darkened.

But Evelyn didn’t wait for a response. She turned on her heel, leaving him standing there—stunned, furious, and utterly dismissed.

The elevator chimed softly as the doors slid open. Evelyn seized the opportunity to wrench herself free from Ethan's grasp and stepped out into the hallway.

A smirk curled her lips as she thought, "Ethan's already unraveling? Just wait until he finds out I'm marrying Alexander. He'll lose his damn mind."

Before she could take another step, Ethan lunged forward and caught her wrist again, his grip bruising. "Even if this isn't about me, you can't seriously go on a date with Ryan! You know he and I despise each other!"

Evelyn twisted her arm, trying to break free.

Their scuffle had grown too loud. The motion-activated lights flickered to life, flooding the corridor with sudden brightness.

Then—a door swung open behind them.

A warm glow spilled into the dim hallway, casting sharp shadows across Evelyn's face.

Alexander stood in the doorway, dressed in sleek silk pajamas, the top two buttons undone. The fabric draped loosely over his frame, revealing the sharp line of his collarbone and the tantalizing dip of his throat.

The light from inside illuminated faint red marks peeking beneath his collar—marks that unmistakably belonged to a woman.

Evelyn froze, her breath hitching.

"Alexander's home?"

Her mind spun.

"Ethan and Vanessa haven't even had their wedding yet. If word gets out that Alexander and I are together—living together—"

The thought sent a thrill down her spine.

The moment the door swung open, Evelyn's breath hitched.

She hadn’t expected Alexander to be standing there, his expression darkening as his gaze landed on Ethan’s grip around her wrist.

Ethan, equally stunned, blinked at his uncle. His mind raced. Evelyn was supposed to be going home… so why was Alexander here?

Then it clicked.

His eyes widened in disbelief as he looked between them. "You—you two—what the hell is going on?"

Alexander’s jaw clenched, his voice dangerously low. "That’s my line. What are you doing with my wife?"

The air thickened with tension.

Evelyn yanked her wrist free, but the damage was done.

Alexander’s fingers twitched at his sides, his knuckles white. The vein at his temple pulsed visibly.

Ethan took a step back, realization dawning. "Wait… you two are—"

"None of your business," Alexander cut in, his voice like ice.

Evelyn swallowed hard. This wasn’t how she wanted him to find out.

But the way Alexander was looking at Ethan—like he wanted to tear him apart—sent a shiver down her spine.

Ethan, still processing, shook his head. "Uncle, you can’t be serious. After everything—"

"I said," Alexander stepped forward, his presence suffocating, "it’s none of your concern."

Evelyn’s pulse pounded in her ears.

One wrong move, and this would explode.

And she wasn’t sure she could stop it.
###Chapter 97 Why Do You Live Here?

Evelyn jerked her hand free from Ethan's grip.

Her pulse raced as she feared Alexander might reveal everything. Thinking fast, she reached into her bag and pulled out a file.

"Mr. Whitmore, here's the report you requested."

She was grateful for her position at Horizon Enterprises—work was the perfect excuse.

Moving closer, she subtly widened her eyes at him, silently pleading for cooperation.

Alexander's expression darkened.

The way Ethan had grabbed Evelyn's wrist, the way her hair was tousled—it didn't take a genius to piece together what had just happened.

Rage simmered beneath his composed exterior. But seeing her silent plea, he forced himself to swallow the jealousy burning in his chest.

"Understood."

His voice was ice-cold as he gave a curt nod, turning slightly to play along.

With the same detached professionalism he displayed at the office, he ordered, "Leave it on my study desk."

Evelyn exhaled in relief.

She could still feel Ethan's gaze boring into her back, but for now, the charade had worked.

Alexander didn't spare Ethan another glance as he strode toward the study, his posture rigid with barely contained fury.

Evelyn hurried after him, clutching the file like a lifeline.

The tension in the air was suffocating.

She had no idea how long this act could hold.

But for now, it was all she had.

Ethan stepped into the apartment, his gaze immediately locking onto Alexander.

He had intended to say something, but the stormy expression on Alexander's face made him reconsider.

"Uncle Alexander, why do you live here?"

The apartment complex was far from luxurious—certainly not the kind of place suited for a man of Alexander's standing.

Alexander pulled a cigarette from his pocket, lighting it with deliberate slowness. Smoke curled around him as he leveled Ethan with an indifferent stare.

"Because I want to."

Ethan’s eyes flickered, catching sight of the faint marks trailing along Alexander’s neck—love bites, unmistakable in their origin.

His gaze swept over the apartment, noting the subtle feminine touches scattered throughout.

A realization struck him.

"Uncle Alexander… do you have a girlfriend?"

Alexander leaned casually against the doorframe, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips.

He neither confirmed nor denied it.

But that was enough.

Ethan’s mind raced.

Alexander Whitmore—untouchable, ruthless, and famously detached—was seeing someone.

What an unexpected twist!

Ethan's curiosity was piqued. "Uncle Alexander, who is this woman that's stolen your heart? Why not bring her home and introduce her to the family?"

"Patience," Alexander replied coolly, his gaze sharp.

His lips curved into an enigmatic smile. "You'll meet her soon enough."

Ethan nodded, not pressing further.

Alexander's eyes darkened dangerously. "Why are you still lingering here?"

Ethan tilted his head, trying to peer past him into the apartment.

Evelyn hadn't emerged yet.

After a brief hesitation, he lowered his voice. "Uncle Alexander, I want Evelyn transferred to the Marketing Department."

Instantly, Alexander's expression turned icy.

A mocking smirk played on his lips.

Ethan blinked. "What?"

Alexander studied him with undisguised disdain. "Are you seriously trying to take what's mine?"

His voice dripped with contempt. "You're not worthy."

Without waiting for a response, he slammed the door shut with such force that the walls trembled.

The abruptness of his action spoke volumes—his temper was barely restrained.

The message was clear: crossing him would be a grave mistake.

Ethan Caldwell stood frozen outside the door, his knuckles still stinging from the unanswered knock.

The heavy oak door remained firmly shut, sealing Evelyn Carter's silent rejection.

He counted exactly 237 seconds before accepting she wouldn't emerge. The realization tasted like burnt coffee—bitter and unnecessary.

Of course she was avoiding him. That warning from Alexander Whitmore still echoed in his skull like a gong.

Did she think he'd beg?

His polished Oxfords pivoted sharply on the marble tiles. He'd only come to deliver a message: stay away from Ryan Fletcher.

The thought of his cousin entangled with Evelyn made his stomach churn. Disgusting. Absolutely unacceptable.

Upstairs, Evelyn's pen hovered over a legal document as cold realization struck.

Ethan had tracked her here.

If she kept living under Alexander's roof, their arrangement would become public before Vanessa Hart's wedding.

And that couldn't happen. Not yet. The society pages weren't ready for this bombshell.

Her gold-plated pen snapped in half. Ink bled across the contract like a warning.
###Chapter 98 Green-Eyed Monster

Lately, vicious rumors had been circulating that Vanessa Hart stole Grace Caldwell's fiancé. Everywhere Evelyn Carter went, she faced harsh whispers and judgmental stares.

If the truth came out that Grace had already married another man, she would be the one at fault.

With that thought, Evelyn simply pulled a few outfits from the closet and tossed them into her suitcase.

Just as she zipped it shut, Alexander Whitmore walked in, his expression unreadable.

"I'm moving out for a while."

Claire Dawson was away on another business trip, so Evelyn planned to rent an apartment closer to Titan Capital Group.

Alexander's tall frame stiffened. "Because of Ethan?"

Evelyn nodded. "If he finds out about us, it'll complicate things. We should be careful."

Silence stretched between them as Alexander moved to the sofa and sat down. His mind replayed the moment Ethan Caldwell had grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

Their hands had touched.

The memory burned.

The security footage from the elevator had just been delivered to Alexander by the building management.

His grip tightened around his phone as he watched Evelyn embrace Ethan in that confined space.

A muscle twitched in Alexander's jaw. His usually composed demeanor shattered, replaced by a chilling frost in his piercing gaze.

He strode to the mahogany wine cabinet, yanked open the door, and seized the nearest bottle.

Without bothering with a glass, he tipped the bottle back, the rich red liquid spilling past his lips.

His throat worked with each harsh swallow, droplets escaping to trace a sinful path down his neck.

The more he drank, the more the fire in his chest raged—unquenchable, consuming.

The front door clicked open.

Evelyn wheeled her suitcase inside, oblivious to the storm brewing in the man standing mere feet away.

"I'll return to Whitmore Manor after their wedding in a few days," she announced, her voice detached.

It was the logical choice. She had played her part this far—why break character now?

Alexander said nothing. His burning stare pinned her in place, dissecting every microexpression.

Her eyes met his, cool and indifferent. No warmth. No affection.

But when she looked at Ethan?

Her gaze had been a tempest—raw, scorching, alive with fury.

The realization struck like a blade.

To Evelyn, he was nothing more than a shadow compared to Ethan Caldwell.

The wine bottle shattered against the marble floor.

The intimacy they shared last night meant nothing to her. To Evelyn, he was just another business associate.

Alexander's shoulders slumped as the bitter truth settled in his chest. No matter how much he wished otherwise, he was merely a means to an end.

His lips twisted into a sardonic smile. "Weren't you the one begging for my support all this time? Now that you're walking away, you don't need my backing anymore?"

"Of course I do!"

His fingers tightened around the half-empty wine glass, crimson liquid sloshing over the rim and staining his crisp white shirt.

"Can't you tell I'm furious?" His voice was rough. "Aren't you going to say anything?"

Evelyn blinked, genuinely perplexed. "You're angry? Why?"

In one fluid motion, Alexander rose to his feet, looming over her. The low timbre of his voice vibrated through the space between them.

"What do you think?"

A beat of silence.

Then—

"Because I'm jealous."

The admission hung in the air, sharp and undeniable.

Evelyn's breath caught.

Alexander Whitmore—ruthless tycoon, untouchable heir—was jealous.

And he'd just laid it bare.

"Why are you acting like this? Who's got you so worked up?"

Alexander remained silent, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn.

He was nothing more than a pawn in her game.

His jealousy meant nothing to her.

Without another word, Alexander grabbed his coat and stormed out of the penthouse.

She didn’t even understand why he was upset—or who had triggered it.

Was she truly oblivious, or did she just not care about his feelings at all?

From that moment on, Alexander refused to acknowledge Evelyn’s existence.

At Titan Capital Group, he walked past her as if she were a stranger, his expression cold and unreadable.

It kept their relationship hidden, yes—but there was something else beneath the surface.

A simmering resentment.

A silent fury.

And Evelyn couldn’t shake the feeling that she had crossed a line she couldn’t uncross.

###Chapter 99 Running After Shadows

The office felt cavernous with just the two of them inside, yet Alexander didn’t spare Evelyn so much as a glance.

Her stomach twisted.

This was worse than she’d thought.

She’d truly crossed a line this time.

When Claire returned from her business trip, she immediately scheduled dinner with Evelyn.

At the bistro, Claire studied her with unnerving intensity.

"You’re Alexander’s wife now, yet you were caught in a compromising position with Ethan in an elevator—then moved out? Of course he’s furious!"

Evelyn’s lashes fluttered. "There’s nothing between Ethan and me."

"Doesn’t matter. He’s your ex!"

Claire leaned forward, voice dropping. "Do you have any idea how toxic exes are to marriages? Every man loses his mind knowing his wife once chased another man for seven years. It’s like swallowing broken glass—just the memory cuts deep."

Despite her history with Ethan, Evelyn was startlingly naive about relationships.

The complexities of male psychology were foreign to her. Evelyn had never navigated the treacherous waters of romance before.

"If what you're saying is true, then there's no way out," she murmured, pushing her barely touched plate away. The morning sickness had stolen her appetite.

Resting her chin on her palm, she considered Claire's words carefully.

"A solution?" Claire's eyes sparkled with sudden inspiration. "There is one! From now on, you need to shower Alexander with affection—publicly."

Evelyn frowned. "What do you mean?"

"You have to be even more relentless than you were when you pursued Ethan," Claire explained. "It'll stroke Alexander's ego as a man and smooth the path for your marriage announcement in two weeks."

A lightbulb went off in Evelyn's mind. Of course! Why didn't I think of that?

Vanessa and Ethan's wedding was less than a week away.

Once her relationship with Alexander was out in the open, they'd share holiday dinners with his family. But as his wife, she had once thrown herself at his nephew. That had to sting, no matter how understanding he was.

Even if Alexander was tolerant enough to overlook it, the whispers would follow them.

The thought made her stomach churn.

She needed to act fast.

Evelyn straightened in her seat, determination hardening her features. "You're right. I'll make sure everyone sees how much I adore him."

Claire grinned. "That's the spirit. Now, let's plan your grand romantic gestures."

Evelyn nodded, already mentally drafting a list.

She would chase Alexander Whitmore with the same fervor she once wasted on Ethan Caldwell.

This time, she wouldn't fail.

The consequences would be catastrophic.

How would the elite circles and Alexander's business associates view him?

Why should such an extraordinary man endure whispered insults because of me?

He might dismiss it once or twice, but what about when it becomes relentless?

Wasn't this essentially planting a ticking time bomb in our marriage?

I had to act before the situation spiraled out of control.

I needed to make one thing crystal clear—I would marry no one but Alexander Whitmore.

This served two purposes.

First, it would please him.

Second, even if gossip persisted, the narrative would shift.

People would focus on my relentless pursuit of him, not the fact that his wife was a woman Ethan Caldwell had discarded.

There was a world of difference between those two versions of the story.

But a new dilemma emerged.

How could Evelyn Carter convincingly fall for Alexander and launch her passionate campaign to win him?

The stakes were higher than ever.

Every move had to be calculated, every step deliberate.

Because this wasn’t just about love—it was about rewriting our future.

Rushing after him now would be a terrible idea. It would seem too sudden, too desperate. No one would buy it.

Evelyn needed to think this through carefully.

She was still a short distance from her apartment at Willowbrook, but the narrow street forced her to get out of the car.

Claire pulled over to the curb.

Then the sky opened up.

Without an umbrella, Evelyn was drenched within seconds. By the time she reached her building, her clothes clung to her skin, her hair plastered to her face.

She paused outside the door, shaking water from her sleeves.

Once Claire saw her safely inside, she turned the car around and drove off.

Across the street, a vintage car sat idling by the curb.

Alexander remained motionless behind the wheel, his gaze fixed on the spot where Evelyn had vanished.

Chasing after him out of the blue would never work. It was too sudden—no one would buy it.

Evelyn needed to think this through carefully.

She was still a short distance from her apartment, but the narrow street couldn’t accommodate cars. Claire pulled over, and Evelyn had no choice but to walk the rest of the way.

The moment she stepped out of the car, the sky opened up.

Rain poured down in heavy sheets. Without an umbrella, Evelyn was drenched within seconds. By the time she reached her building, her clothes clung to her skin, her hair plastered to her face.

She paused outside the entrance, shaking the excess water from her sleeves.

Claire waited just long enough to see her safely inside before driving off.

Across the street, a vintage car sat parked beneath the dim glow of a streetlamp.

Alexander remained inside, his gaze fixed on the spot where Evelyn had vanished into the rain.
###Chapter 100 Burning Up

Lucas Bennett stood beside Alexander Whitmore.

Alexander's intense gaze was fixed on something outside the window. Lucas followed his line of sight and smirked. "Alexander, did you have another argument with Evelyn?"

Lately, Alexander had been practically living at Maple Leaf Café when he wasn’t working.

Any man with a wife who refused to come home was clearly in trouble.

They had been having a great time at the café earlier, but then the sky had darkened without warning. Thunder cracked, and rain poured down in sheets.

Alexander, drunk and half-asleep on the sofa, jolted upright at the sound. Lucas, who had been in the middle of a card game, nearly jumped out of his seat.

Without a word, Alexander stood and walked out. Simon Graves, ever perceptive, immediately brought the car around.

Worried, Lucas followed.

To his surprise, he spotted Claire Dawson pulling over to the side of the road. And there was Evelyn, limping back alone.

It looked like things between Alexander and Evelyn had escalated. The tension was palpable.

Lucas stretched out lazily on the leather couch, amusement dancing in his eyes as he taunted Alexander. "Married barely a month and already fighting like cats and dogs? Pathetic."

Alexander shot him a glacial look that could freeze hell over. "At least I'm not the one refusing to sign divorce papers like some lovesick puppy." His voice dripped with contempt. "Claire changed the locks weeks ago. Have some dignity and put your signature on those documents."

The barb hit its mark. Lucas's smirk faltered, realizing he'd picked a fight with the wrong man. When it came to verbal sparring, Alexander always had the last word - sharp as a razor and twice as cutting.

Back at Willowbrook Apartments, Evelyn stood under the scalding shower until her skin turned pink, washing away the storm and her ruined clothes. But as midnight crept in, the room began spinning violently.

Her fingers trembled against her forehead. Burning up. She burrowed deeper into the duvet, hoping sweat would break the fever's grip. Instead, the heat intensified until her bones ached.

Dawn came too soon. Evelyn woke to limbs heavier than lead, her throat raw as sandpaper. Every movement sent fresh waves of nausea rolling through her. She needed... something. Medicine. Water. Help.

But the apartment echoed with emptiness. Just like her marriage.

The morning sunlight filtered through the curtains, but Evelyn Carter barely noticed. Her head throbbed, her body ached, and her throat burned. She should have stayed home.

But the Horizon Enterprises project deadline loomed. Any delay now could derail months of work.

Gritting her teeth, she called a cab.

The Titan Capital Group lobby buzzed with employees waiting for elevators. Chatter filled the air—office gossip, weekend plans, complaints about Monday mornings.

Evelyn moved toward the private elevator reserved for Alexander Whitmore’s office. No lines, no crowds.

Then the world tilted.

A sharp wave of dizziness hit her. Someone jostled past, their shoulder clipping hers. Her knees buckled.

She reached blindly for the wall—

A strong hand caught hers.

Alexander.

Before she could react, he pulled her back. She stumbled against his chest, the scent of his cologne enveloping her.

Silence fell across the lobby. Every eye locked on them.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. His grip tightened.

"You're burning up," he murmured, his voice low.

She swallowed. "I'm fine."

His jaw tensed. "Liar."

The elevator doors slid open. Without another word, he steered her inside, leaving the stunned crowd behind.

The doors closed.

Alone with him, Evelyn swayed.

Alexander caught her waist. "You're not going to your desk."

She opened her mouth to argue—

Then darkness swallowed her.

Silence fell over the crowd.

When they realized it was Alexander who had caught Evelyn, their jaws dropped in disbelief.

Everyone knew he was famously cold toward women.

Whispers claimed he hadn’t dated anyone in years.

Yet here he was, holding a woman in his arms—right in the middle of the office.

All eyes strained to see which lucky employee had earned his attention.

Evelyn hadn’t bothered with makeup today. Her cheeks were flushed, her breathing shallow.

She barely managed to crack her eyes open, her body limp against Alexander’s chest.

She looked fragile—like she might collapse at any second.

“You’re burning up.”

Alexander’s frown deepened. Even through layers of fabric, he could feel the heat radiating off her skin.

She hadn’t expected him to be the one to catch her.

A slow, feverish thought formed in her hazy mind.

This… could work to her advantage.
###Chapter 101 A Bold Declaration

This was Evelyn's moment to embrace her role as a woman hopelessly smitten with Alexander.

Her fingers had crumpled the crisp fabric of his dress shirt, her gaze lingering on him for what felt like an eternity.

Then, without warning, she yanked him forward, arms looping around his neck as she pressed her lips to his.

He stiffened, shock rendering him motionless.

The room fell into stunned silence, every pair of eyes wide with disbelief.

Before anyone could process what had happened, Evelyn's knees buckled, and she collapsed against Alexander's chest.

When she came to, she found herself in the sterile quiet of Titan Capital Group's infirmary.

An IV needle was taped to the back of her hand, and a young nurse with soft features was adjusting the drip bag above her.

"You're awake!"

Natalie set aside her phone and leaned closer. "How are you feeling? Your fever spiked to nearly 104. You just—well, you passed out in Mr. Whitmore's arms."

The company's infirmary was well-equipped, more like a small clinic than a basic first-aid station.

Evelyn blinked slowly, her voice hoarse. "Did... Alexander bring me here?"

Natalie's eyes sparkled with barely contained excitement. "Oh, he did! And—do you remember what you did before you fainted? You kissed him! Right in front of everyone! I've never seen Mr. Whitmore look so shocked in my life. That had to be his first public kiss!"

Just as the words left her lips, the door swung open.

Alexander strode in, his expression unreadable.

Natalie immediately clamped her mouth shut, though her grin remained.

Evelyn lifted a hand to her throbbing temple, then turned her dazed gaze to Alexander. Her lips curved into a slow, delirious smile.

"Alexander," she murmured, voice rough but deliberate, "now that I've kissed you, I suppose I'll have to marry you."

Silence.

The infirmary was unusually full today—colleagues from various departments recovering from the seasonal flu outbreak.

All of them froze.

Had Evelyn lost her mind?

Since when did she speak with such audacity?

Even Alexander studied her with narrowed eyes. Something was off about her today.

Was it the fever—or something else entirely?

His gaze lingered on her face, searching for any hint of what might be going through her mind.

But Evelyn appeared perfectly composed—nothing unusual in her expression.

Except for one thing.

From the moment Alexander stepped into the room, Evelyn’s eyes had been locked onto him.

She wasn’t just looking at him—she was studying him, her gaze intense, almost reverent. As if he were the only person in the world.

The way she watched him—it was the look of a woman utterly, hopelessly in love.

Alexander moved toward her, instinctively raising his hand to check her temperature, but stopped short when he noticed the curious glances from their colleagues. He hesitated, then started to slide his hand into his pocket instead.

"Are you feeling alright? Should I call Dr. Wells again?"

Before he could finish, Evelyn caught his wrist.

Her fingers curled around his, warm and firm. As she tilted her head down, a few loose strands of her dark hair brushed against his palm, sending an unexpected shiver through him.

Then she spoke—softly, but with absolute conviction.

"Alexander, I want to be yours."

A stunned silence fell over the room.

Whispers erupted almost instantly.

Everyone had already heard about what happened in the elevator lobby—how Evelyn had kissed Alexander without warning.

But this?

This was something else entirely.

She wasn’t just bold—she was declaring herself in front of everyone.

No one had ever dared to do something like this before.

It was unheard of.

Unthinkable.

And yet—here she was, holding his hand, her eyes burning with determination.

The entire office held its breath, waiting for his response.

Evelyn's lips curved into a radiant smile, her eyes sparkling like stars.

A gentle breeze drifted through the open window, caressing her flushed cheeks and tousling the loose strands of hair framing her face.

The fever had left her skin slightly warm, painting her complexion with a delicate pink hue. Unfazed by the whispers and curious glances around them, her attention remained solely fixed on Alexander.

This wasn’t some careless jest.

"I’m completely serious, Alexander," she declared, her voice steady yet soft. "From the moment I saw you, I knew. My heart is yours."

Their gazes locked—his piercing, searching hers as if trying to unravel the truth behind her words.

A secret marriage bound them, one hidden from prying eyes.

So why had she chosen now to lay her feelings bare?

###Chapter 102 Are You Out of Your Mind?

The silence stretched between them like a taut wire. Alexander couldn't decipher Evelyn's intentions, so he chose to remain quiet for now.

Her bold words sent an unexpected jolt through his chest.

To the onlookers, he appeared as nothing more than an icy, unapproachable executive. His rigid posture and stormy expression suggested a man pushed beyond patience by an irritating woman.

The medical bay became a tomb of silence. No one dared breathe too loudly, let alone speak.

They were all convinced Evelyn had signed her own termination papers by daring to flirt with Alexander Whitmore.

The Titan Capital Group had never witnessed any scandal involving him. Female employees maintained a careful three-foot radius at all times.

There were even whispers that he and Simon Graves were more than just business partners. Their constant companionship and shared hotel rooms during conferences fueled endless speculation.

Then his phone vibrated.

Alexander shot Evelyn one last inscrutable look before striding out, the device pressed to his ear.

The moment the door clicked shut, the room erupted into frenzied chatter.

The office erupted into chaos.

Natalie Brooks stood frozen nearby, her eyes wide with shock and admiration as she stared at Evelyn Carter.

"I thought we were just coworkers, but you're aiming to become the boss's wife!"

"When you marry Mr. Whitmore, can you put in a good word for me? A promotion and a raise would be nice!"

Within minutes, messages flooded the company’s group chats across every department.

[Evelyn has lost it. She stole Alexander Whitmore’s first kiss and announced her feelings for him in front of everyone, declaring she wants to be his woman.]

Some scoffed, saying she was delusional—thinking she could win his heart just by fainting in his arms.

Others sneered that she was shameless, using tricks to seduce her way into wealth.

Most of the comments were scathing.

Evelyn didn’t care.

Her fever still burned, so she spent the entire day resting in the infirmary.

The gossip spread like wildfire. The Hayes household descended into chaos, bombarding Evelyn's phone with half a dozen frantic calls in rapid succession.

She ignored every single one.

Just as the workday ended, Ethan Caldwell - supposedly away on business - materialized in the hospital room unannounced.

Flanking him were Vanessa Hart and Ryan Fletcher, their expressions dripping with malicious curiosity.

"What the hell is this? The moment I'm gone, you set your sights on Alexander Whitmore?" Ethan's voice cracked with barely contained rage.

He'd seen the damning evidence in the company group chat during lunch - the images burning into his retinas.

"Ethan, you're being ridiculous! I'm standing right here," Ryan snapped, dragging a chair across the floor with unnecessary force.

But Ethan wasn't listening.

The mental image consumed him - Evelyn gripping Alexander's collar, pressing her lips to his in front of everyone. That bold declaration of marriage. The way she'd initiated it all without hesitation.

The photos circulating through Horizon Enterprises' internal channels left no room for doubt. His former fiancée had made the first move.

It was unfathomable.

Absolutely insane.

For months after Ethan and Vanessa announced their engagement, Evelyn remained silent.

The entire social circle assumed she had finally accepted defeat.

But then, just days before the wedding, Evelyn shocked everyone by publicly confessing her feelings for Alexander.

Ethan was livid. The whispers and mocking glances from their peers burned his pride.

As Evelyn rose from the bed, he grabbed her wrist. "Have you lost your mind? This is between us. Why drag Alexander into it?"

Her cold stare cut through him. "It's not your concern. He saved me. I fell for him the moment I saw him. Do I need your permission to love someone?"

"Love at first sight?" His grip tightened. "I get that you're bitter about Vanessa and me, but humiliating yourself like this? Have you no shame?"

Evelyn yanked her arm free. "The only one humiliated here is you. What we had is over. I don’t care who you marry, and who I choose is none of your business."

"Do you even hear what they’re saying about you?" His voice dropped to a furious whisper. "They call you a gold-digger, a disgrace. Does that not bother you? You didn’t have to go this far just to spite me. Why drag an innocent man like Alexander into your mess?"

"Alexander?"

Vanessa chimed in sharply, "Exactly, Evelyn. Have you lost all sense of dignity? Mom and Dad just called. They're mortified and demand you come home tonight."

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh.

"Mortified? All I did was confess my feelings to Alexander, and suddenly everyone acts like I’ve committed a crime. I haven’t even done anything yet."

Her gaze hardened as she turned to Vanessa.

"And you dare call me shameful? Weren’t you the one who stole your own sister’s fiancé?"

The tension in the room thickened, the air crackling with unspoken accusations. Vanessa’s face flushed crimson, her fingers tightening around her clutch.

Evelyn didn’t back down.

She tilted her chin up, defiance burning in her eyes.

"If anyone should be ashamed, Vanessa, it’s you."

A sharp inhale.

Then silence.

Vanessa’s lips pressed into a thin line, her usual composure slipping.

Evelyn turned away, her heart pounding.

She had crossed a line.

But she didn’t regret it.

Not one bit.

###Chapter 103 The Car Accident

Evelyn felt her cheeks burn with humiliation. Alexander noticed everything.

"Evelyn Carter," Ethan Caldwell sneered, his voice dripping with contempt. "You're doing this just to spite me, aren't you? And now you're shamelessly chasing after Uncle Alexander? Have you no dignity?"

Ryan Fletcher, who had remained quiet until now, suddenly let out a low chuckle.

"Ethan, you're mistaken," Ryan said, amusement lacing his words. "A woman pursuing a man isn't shameless—it's bold. Didn't you hear her? She's done with you. Who she chooses now is none of your concern."

Ethan's eyes narrowed dangerously.

"Ryan, you went on a blind date with her too," he snapped. "She rejected you and is now after my uncle. And yet, here you are, stirring the pot like it doesn't embarrass you."

Ryan smirked. "Why should I be embarrassed? You're the one who cheated, not me. Besides, hardly anyone knows about our blind date."

His grin widened. "Or are you just scared she’ll actually end up with Alexander and become your aunt?"

The tension between them crackled like live wires.

Fists clenched, they squared off, ready to throw punches.

Unfazed, Evelyn grabbed her bag and strode out of the infirmary without a backward glance.

Vanessa Hart hurried after her.

"It was you playing the cello in the music room that day, wasn’t it?" Vanessa called out.

Evelyn didn’t stop walking.

The question hung in the air, unanswered.

Evelyn kept walking, ignoring the voice calling after her.

"I recognize you!" The words cut through the chilly evening air. "After what happened, you swore you'd never touch a cello again. Evelyn, you lied!"

The plaza outside Titan Capital Group was nearly empty at this hour.

Darkness had settled over Cresthaven.

Eighteen-year-old Ethan Caldwell had been in a horrific accident.

The impact had left him clinging to life, unconscious for days. His mother Eleanor had flown in specialists from across the globe, pulling him back from death's door through sheer willpower.

Almost no one knew the truth—that Evelyn was the reason he'd been behind the wheel that night.

Rain had been pouring in sheets when she'd finished her late-night rehearsal. Stranded without a taxi, he'd insisted on picking her up himself.

She remembered standing beneath the theater's awning, her cello case clutched tightly, watching in horror as his car skidded across the slick pavement and slammed into a lamppost.

During those endless days when Ethan lay motionless in the hospital, Evelyn had drowned in guilt. She believed with absolute certainty that she'd destroyed his life.

Back then, she'd been too naive to recognize the signs.

He had loved her.

The evening air was crisp as Evelyn found herself drawn to the hospital garden. Seeking solace, she settled by the flower beds, her fingers trembling as they hovered over the strings of her cello.

The melody she played was hauntingly tender, wrapping around her like a shroud of memories she couldn’t shake. Each note carried the weight of her grief, pulling her deeper into the fog of her thoughts.

Then Eleanor stormed in, her face twisted with fury. Without a word, she snatched the cello from Evelyn’s grasp and smashed it against the ground. The sound of splintering wood echoed in the silence.

Evelyn didn’t protest.

She’s right, she thought numbly. Ethan nearly died because of me. What right do I have to play?

From that moment on, she abandoned the cello, locking away that part of herself—until now.

“Back then, I stopped playing out of guilt for Ethan,” Evelyn said, turning to face Vanessa with a faint, defiant smile. “But he’s dead to me now. Why shouldn’t I play again?”

She had sacrificed her passion for Ethan once.

But Alexander’s quiet request—his longing to hear her play—had reignited something in her.

After a quick dinner near Titan Capital Group, she returned to finish her IV treatment. The fever had broken, leaving only the last of the anti-inflammatory medication dripping steadily into her veins.

Ethan and the others were long gone.

The room was silent.

Alexander returned to the hospital after a late-night business dinner, his tie slightly loosened from the evening's formalities.

The sterile white walls of the infusion room greeted him, but his attention was immediately drawn to the lone figure slumped in one of the chairs.

Evelyn.

An IV needle was taped to the back of her slender hand, her head tilted to the side in restless sleep. The harsh fluorescent light above cast shadows beneath her eyes, making her look even more fragile than usual.

His jaw tightened.

Without hesitation, he shrugged off his tailored suit jacket and draped it carefully over her shoulders, the fabric swallowing her petite frame.

The moment the warmth settled over her, Evelyn stirred, her lashes fluttering open.

Blinking up at him in confusion, her voice came out hoarse from sleep. "Alex? What are you doing here?"

The surprise in her tired eyes made something in his chest twist.

He hadn't planned on seeing her like this—vulnerable, exhausted, and completely unaware of how much it affected him.

But here they were.
###Chapter 104 You Don't Have to Do This

A loose curl clung to Evelyn's damp forehead, brushing against her parted lips in a way that made her look deliciously undone.

Her fever-bright eyes held a childlike vulnerability that contrasted sharply with the memory now burning through Alexander's mind.

His gaze involuntarily dropped to where her skirt had ridden up, revealing milky thighs that had once locked around his hips with desperate urgency.

He swallowed hard, forcing his attention to the sterile infirmary walls.

"That public declaration of yours," he said, voice rougher than intended. "Claiming love at first sight. Yet you look like I've brought you bad news instead of flowers."

Evelyn's lips curved, though the smile didn't reach her eyes. "I'm thrilled, really. Just... surprised you came."

After days of radio silence, his sudden appearance felt like stumbling upon an oasis after crossing a desert. Had her relentless pursuit finally cracked that marble exterior?

Alexander studied her for three heartbeats—long enough to notice how her pulse fluttered at her throat—before turning toward the window. The afternoon light gilded his profile as he spoke to the glass rather than to her.

"You should know something about me, Evelyn." A muscle jumped in his jaw. "When I give my word, I keep it. Even when it's inconvenient."

The unspoken especially when it's inconvenient hung between them like a challenge.

Outside, a gust of wind sent crimson maple leaves swirling past the window—a fleeting storm of color against the crisp blue sky. Inside, the heart monitor beeped an erratic counterpoint to the sudden tension thickening the air.

Evelyn's fingers twisted in the starched hospital sheets. "Is that what this is? A matter of honor?"

Instead of answering, Alexander reached into his jacket pocket. The rustle of paper sounded unnaturally loud as he placed a folded document beside her untouched water glass.

"Read it when you're discharged," he said, already moving toward the door. "We'll discuss terms tomorrow."

The door clicked shut with finality, leaving Evelyn alone with the envelope and a hundred unanswered questions. The crisp white paper felt heavier than it should have when she finally worked up the courage to lift it.

Her name stared back at her in bold black ink, followed by two words that made her breath catch:

Marriage Contract.

The air between them grew heavy with unspoken words.

"You made quite the spectacle today," Alexander murmured, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Were you planning to shoulder all the gossip alone?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. She hadn't anticipated him seeing through her so effortlessly.

Since he had already unraveled her intentions, she saw no point in denial.

"I did it so that when we go public, no one would hold my past with Ethan against you."

Her voice was steady, though her fingers curled slightly at her sides.

"Let them say I pursued you. Let them whisper that you had no choice but to accept me. That way, the blame falls on me—not you."

She met his eyes, unwavering.

"Your reputation stays untarnished."

Evelyn believed Alexander was a good man.

She refused to let him be dragged down because of her.

What did it matter if people called her desperate? If they labeled her shameless?

But Alexander was different.

He was the CEO of Titan Capital Group, a man constantly under the scrutiny of powerful circles.

His name carried weight. His image mattered.

Alexander studied her for a long moment, his expression unreadable.

Then, quietly, he said, "You don't have to do this."

His voice was firm.

"No one would dare question me. Not even—"

The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken promise.

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

She had expected gratitude.

Not this quiet, fierce defiance.

Not this refusal to let her bear the burden alone.

The realization sent warmth flooding through her chest.

Perhaps she had underestimated him.

Perhaps he was far more than just a good man.

The golden afternoon light filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Carter stood before Alexander Whitmore, her fingers twisting nervously in the fabric of her dress.

"You don't have to do this," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "If we marry, I won't let you shoulder this burden alone just to protect my reputation."

Alexander's jaw tightened, his dark eyes burning with quiet intensity. "If I can't even stand by the woman I love without needing her to shield me, what kind of man does that make me?"

Evelyn shook her head, a soft, sad smile touching her lips. "This is the easiest path for you. Please... just trust me on this."

For a long moment, Alexander said nothing. Then, with a slow exhale, he gave a single nod.

Relief flooded through Evelyn, her shoulders relaxing slightly.

But then Alexander's voice dropped, rougher now, laced with something unreadable. "So everything today—the way you looked at me, the things you said—it was all an act. You were just pretending to want me."

Evelyn froze.

The way his gaze bore into her, sharp and knowing, told her he already had his answer. A quiet sigh escaped him, edged with something dangerously close to hurt. "I thought so."

Love at first sight? Fell for me?

The irony of it twisted in his chest. She had played the role so perfectly—her laughter, her lingering touches, the way her eyes had softened when she looked at him—that for one fleeting, foolish moment, he had believed her.

He had let himself believe she truly cared.

Now, all that remained was the bitter taste of reality.

And the quiet ache of a heart that had dared to hope.

A bitter smile twisted Alexander's lips as his dark eyes turned glacial. The warmth that had been there moments ago vanished completely.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Had she said something wrong again?

Her mind raced, replaying their conversation frantically.

"Wait!"

She lurched forward instinctively, only for the IV line to pull taut, the tube flushing crimson. Wincing, she collapsed back onto the hospital bed.

But it was too late.

Alexander was already striding out of the infusion room, his broad shoulders rigid with tension.

Evelyn's chest tightened as she watched him leave. Her desperate shout had startled the dozing nurse awake.

Blinking sleepily, the nurse took in the scene—Evelyn's longing gaze fixed on the retreating figure, the way her fingers clutched at the sheets as if physically restraining herself from running after him.

The nurse sighed inwardly.

Another failed confession, huh?

The door clicked shut behind Alexander without so much as a backward glance.
###Chapter 105 His Past

By the time Evelyn had the IV removed and arrived at the company entrance, Alexander was already gone.

A flicker of loneliness passed through her gaze, but just then, a sleek vintage car rolled to a stop in front of her.

Evelyn’s eyes lit up again.

Simon stepped out, his voice calm. "Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Whitmore instructed me to take you home."

Her gaze instinctively darted to the back seat, but Alexander wasn’t there.

He’s angry… yet he still sent Simon for me?

She slid into the car without another word.

As they drove, Evelyn realized they weren’t heading toward Whitmore Manor—but to the apartment she’d been staying in these past few days.

So he had been keeping tabs on her.

A warmth spread through her chest.

Alexander… what kind of man are you, really?

She knew he was principled. Unyielding. A man who didn’t tolerate deceit.

Yet here he was, silently ensuring her safety despite his anger.

The contradiction made her pulse quicken.

What else didn’t she know about him?

The name Alexander Whitmore carried weight in Cresthaven.

As the head of the Whitmore family, his influence was undeniable.

But beyond that, Evelyn Carter knew little about him—except for that fateful encounter ten years ago when she had saved his life.

Back then, he had been drenched in blood, a deep wound carved into his chest, hidden in an unassuming haystack in the countryside.

If she hadn’t known acupuncture, if she hadn’t stopped the bleeding in time—he wouldn’t be alive today.

"Mrs. Whitmore, are you thinking about Mr. Whitmore?" Simon Graves glanced at her through the rearview mirror.

The flickering streetlights outside painted shifting shadows across Evelyn’s face as she leaned against the seat, her voice soft. "I think I hurt him."

"You flirted with him like that in front of everyone. He thought it was real, but you were just acting." Simon’s tone was blunt. "Of course he’s upset."

His words struck her like cold water.

So that was the problem.

Simon exhaled. "Mr. Whitmore... he’s someone who’s never really known love."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone. "What do you mean?"

Simon's voice grew heavy with emotion.

"At just three months old, he was sent away to live with a farmer's family. But when they had children of their own, they shoved him into the woodshed. Leftovers were all he ate, and in winter, he barely had enough clothes to survive. For fifteen years, the Whitmore family acted like he didn't exist."

Evelyn's chest tightened painfully.

She had never imagined Alexander endured such cruelty. How could anyone treat a child like that? she thought, anger simmering beneath her shock. The Whitmores are one of the most influential families in Cresthaven. How could they abandon a three-month-old baby and then cast him out like trash?

"And after he turned fifteen?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"At fifteen, he got lucky—the police academy took him in. But it wasn’t until last year, when Titan Capital Group was bleeding money and the Whitmores needed an heir, that they finally remembered him. Sir Whitmore dragged him out of retirement. Alexander clawed his way back into the family on his own strength."

Evelyn clenched her fists. They ignored him for over two decades, only to summon him when they needed a savior? The hypocrisy made her sick.

Then she remembered—the jagged scar across Alexander’s chest. It must have been from one of his missions.

All this time, he had been fighting for survival. Alone.

And now, the very family that discarded him expected him to save them.

Her heart ached for him.

Evelyn's delicate brows knitted together.

"Mrs. Whitmore, people call Mr. Whitmore heartless and unfeeling. But from childhood, kindness was a foreign concept to him."

"While other children basked in parental love and family warmth, his world consisted of a freezing tool shed and backbreaking farm labor."

"I see." Evelyn nodded slowly.

Alexander's formative years were marred by psychological scars.

At the police academy, brutal training regimens and dangerous missions pushed his body to its limits.

No wonder he'd clung to that memory of her saving him for ten long years.

That single act of compassion might have been the only genuine kindness Alexander had known in his twenty-nine years of existence.

The realization settled heavily in Evelyn's chest.

She pictured a small, dark-haired boy shivering in that shed, his small hands raw from chores.

The image made her throat tighten.

Simon's voice grew quieter. "The first time I saw him smile was after meeting you, Mrs. Whitmore."

Evelyn's fingers curled into her palms.

She'd known Alexander had a difficult past, but hearing the details carved fresh wounds in her heart.

The man who now commanded boardrooms with icy precision had once been that lonely child.

The man who protected her with fierce intensity had known no protection himself.

Evelyn blinked away unexpected moisture in her eyes.

She suddenly understood why Alexander reacted so violently to betrayal.

Trust didn't come easily when your earliest memories were of abandonment.

Love was a risk when you'd never been shown any.

Evelyn made a silent vow then.

She would fill Alexander's life with so much light, it would eclipse all those years of darkness.

Starting tonight.

###Chapter 106 Whispers in the Wind

The truth struck Evelyn like lightning.

Now she understood why Alexander had stormed off that day.

When she had declared her feelings for him in front of everyone, he had believed her—wholeheartedly.

The realization that it had all been an act must have shattered him.

Not just anger.

Betrayal.

Disappointment so deep it left wounds.

Evelyn never expected fairy-tale love with Alexander. Their marriage had been a transaction, not a romance.

She had agreed to it for survival—a way to bury her past and find stability.

Alexander had simply been the right man at the right time.

She wanted peace between them.

But now?

She had to rethink everything.

At the very least, she refused to become another person who hurt him—like the Caldwells had.

Days passed.

Then the rumors began.

Whispers slithered through social circles, painting her as the desperate woman who had confessed her love—only to be coldly rejected by Alexander Whitmore.

The most popular version of the tale spread like wildfire: On a night when thunder roared and rain poured, Evelyn, feverish and trembling, orchestrated a "chance" meeting with Alexander. But the ruthless CEO didn’t spare her a single glance, striding past her without hesitation.

Rumor had it she collapsed onto the pavement afterward, sobbing uncontrollably, her heartbreak visible to anyone who dared look.

When Evelyn accidentally overheard Cassandra and Victoria gossiping about it in the break room, she nearly choked on her coffee.

Since when did I crumple to the ground in tears?

All she’d done was kneel to fix her damn shoelace!

Absurd.

Still… maybe this wasn’t entirely bad.

At least it reinforced the narrative that she was desperately chasing Alexander.

"Alexander, what the hell is going on between you and Evelyn?"

As the clock ticked toward the end of the workday, Lucas’s call came through. "I heard she publicly confessed to you—swore she’d be your woman? Aren’t you two already married? What kind of twisted game is this?"

The story had exploded across Titan Capital Group, turning into the juiciest office scandal in weeks.

The entire social elite was buzzing with anticipation.

All eyes were on Evelyn Carter, waiting for her inevitable humiliation. Wagers were being placed in hushed tones across high society gatherings.

The bets varied - how long would Evelyn maintain this charade? Would she last a week? A month?

Everyone agreed her public confession to Alexander was nothing but a desperate performance.

With Ethan Caldwell and Vanessa Hart's wedding looming, this was clearly Evelyn's pathetic attempt to salvage her dignity after being publicly scorned.

Yet no one believed this scheme would succeed. The odds of Alexander Whitmore accepting her advances? Absolute zero.

Alexander's stormy gaze drifted to the floor-to-ceiling windows as he mechanically twisted the cap onto his Montblanc pen.

"Still giving each other the silent treatment?" Lucas Bennett leaned against the mahogany desk, counting on his fingers. "It's been, what? Ten days now?"

Alexander's broad shoulders tensed as he swiveled his chair. "Last I checked, your argument with Claire lasted three weeks." His voice carried the chill of a winter storm.

Lucas muttered a colorful curse under his breath.

"Fine, fine," he conceded, raising his hands. "I get it - bad mood. But tonight's your birthday bash at Eclipse Lounge. No excuses - you're coming."

The grandfather clock in the corner ticked ominously as tension crackled between the two men.

Across town, Evelyn stared at her phone screen, Alexander's contact information glowing tauntingly. The weight of society's judgment pressed down on her shoulders like a physical force.

Somewhere in Kingsdom, a bookmaker adjusted the odds again. The numbers flashed cruelly on the digital display: 1000-1 against reconciliation.

The moment Alexander ended the call, he stepped out of his office, his gaze instinctively drifting toward Evelyn's workstation.

Empty.

Lately, Evelyn had been relentless in her attempts to win his favor. Some mornings, she'd surprise him with freshly brewed coffee and pastries. Other times, she'd casually drop by with a neatly packed lunch, always finding excuses to linger near him.

The entire Titan Capital Group knew about her infatuation.

Yet today, of all days, she was nowhere in sight.

Did she forget? Alexander frowned. It's my birthday. The perfect chance to make a grand gesture, and she's missing it.

He strode toward her desk and rapped his knuckles against the surface. "Where is she?"

The entire executive floor froze.

For weeks, Alexander had treated Evelyn like a ghost—ignoring her presence, avoiding eye contact, making it painfully clear he wanted nothing to do with her.

But now?

Now he was asking about her.

Every pair of eyes in the office widened in stunned disbelief.

###Chapter 107 Don't Even Think About It

Natalie was the first to respond. "Evelyn had personal matters to handle, so she left early this afternoon."

Alexander's expression remained unreadable as he hummed in acknowledgment. His fingers brushed over a file on Evelyn's desk before casually picking it up and walking away without another word.

The tension in the room eased slightly once he was gone.

The others assumed he had only come for work-related reasons.

The moment the door clicked shut, Victoria set her coffee down with a sharp clink. "Personal matters?" She scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "More like playing games. Mr. Whitmore clearly couldn’t care less about her, yet she keeps throwing herself at him. How desperate can you get?"

Natalie’s lips pressed into a thin line. "Ms. Sloan, that’s unnecessarily cruel. There’s nothing wrong with pursuing someone you admire."

"Pursuing?" Victoria let out a derisive laugh.

"She’s making a spectacle of herself, and dragging the rest of us down with her. People will start assuming we’re all just here to seduce our way up the corporate ladder—"

Her words were cut off as the door swung open again.

Alexander stood there, his icy gaze sweeping over them. The room fell silent.

He didn’t speak. He didn’t need to.

The weight of his presence alone was enough to make Victoria’s smirk vanish.

Without breaking eye contact, he stepped forward and dropped the file back onto Evelyn’s desk.

Then, in a voice so low it sent chills down their spines, he said, "If I hear another word about my wife, you won’t just lose your job. You’ll lose any chance of working in this industry again."

Victoria paled.

Natalie barely suppressed a satisfied smile.

Alexander turned on his heel and left, the door closing with finality behind him.

This time, no one dared to speak.

Victoria's voice dripped with disdain. "She's setting a disastrous precedent for all of us."

Daniel cut in sharply. "Even if people are gossiping, it's only about her. No one’s mentioning the rest of us in the executive office. You're blowing this out of proportion, Victoria."

Victoria’s expression soured. "Oh, so now Division Two is teaming up against me, is that it?"

Daniel and Natalie exchanged exasperated looks. Victoria had been in the executive office the longest and often wielded her seniority like a weapon. They usually chose to tread carefully around her.

Cassandra stepped forward, her tone soothing. "Alright, let’s all take a breath. Less talking, more wrapping up. The day’s almost over anyway."

Meanwhile, Evelyn had taken the afternoon off to return to Hawthorne Estate.

Her bold public confession to Alexander had ignited a firestorm of gossip, and now their entire social circle was buzzing with speculation.

With Vanessa’s wedding just days away, Margaret had been buried in preparations.

But Evelyn’s sudden pursuit of Alexander had turned them into the laughingstock of high society.

Now, whenever Margaret stepped out, she was met with hushed whispers and judgmental stares.

Just as whispers about Vanessa stealing her sister's fiancé had begun to die down, Evelyn's bold move reignited the scandal with full force.

The gossip mill was churning again—people called Vanessa disgraceful and claimed Evelyn had lost her mind from heartbreak.

"What possessed you to provoke Alexander? Do you seriously think you can handle the consequences?" Margaret stood rigid in the living room, her expression icy as Evelyn walked in. "You're not just humiliating yourself—you're dragging our entire family through the mud. Have you heard the things people are saying?"

Evelyn barely crossed the threshold before Margaret's sharp words cut through the air.

She strode to the sofa and sank into the cushions. "I'm starving. Didn't you summon me back for dinner? Where is it?"

"You can still think about food at a time like this?" Margaret nearly choked on her fury, her fingers tightening around the edge of the coffee table. Evelyn's indifference was infuriating—as if none of this mattered.

"Why wouldn't I?" Evelyn tilted her head, unfazed. "Look at you, panicking over nothing. I confessed my feelings to Alexander, and you're so rattled you’ve lost your appetite? If I actually marry him, will you be too terrified to function?"

The instant Margaret spoke those words, Evelyn's face darkened.

"You think you can marry Alexander? Keep dreaming, sweetheart."

Margaret scoffed inwardly. Evelyn has truly lost her mind. Alexander Whitmore isn’t some ordinary man you can just claim.

A man of his stature—powerful, untouchable, with a presence that commanded both fear and admiration. His reputation was impeccable, his wealth unimaginable, and his looks could make any woman’s heart race.

He was the kind of man empires were built around.

And Evelyn thought she could land him?

Vanessa, who had been idly peeling an apple nearby, lifted her gaze with a saccharine smile.

"Evelyn, darling, even if you're upset, you shouldn’t joke about Alexander. Just yesterday, I told Ethan you’d be my bridesmaid at our wedding. Imagine—walking down the aisle with him, finally making our dreams come true. After that, do us all a favor and stop making a scene. It’s getting embarrassing."

Evelyn nearly choked on her laughter.

"Excuse me? You want me to stand there and watch you marry that snake?" Her voice dripped with mock sweetness. "Vanessa, aren’t you worried your wedding might turn into a disaster?"

The air between them crackled with tension.

Vanessa’s smile faltered for just a second before she recovered, her fingers tightening around the apple.

"Jealousy doesn’t suit you, Evelyn."

Evelyn leaned in, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper.

"Oh, I’m not jealous. I’m just curious—how long do you think Ethan will stay faithful once he realizes what kind of woman you really are?"

Margaret gasped. "Evelyn!"

But Evelyn was already turning away, her smirk sharp enough to cut glass.

Vanessa’s face paled.

The game was far from over.
###Chapter 108 The Wager

The audacity of Vanessa's request made Evelyn's blood boil.

"Me? A bridesmaid? When I'm already Alexander's wife?"

The sheer absurdity of it all nearly made her laugh out loud.

Across the room, Richard finally lowered his newspaper with deliberate slowness.

His jaw tightened as he studied his daughter.

He had practically groveled to get her back into this house, yet she carried herself like she owned the place.

As if that wasn't enough, Horizon Enterprises had just suffered devastating contract losses.

The timing was too perfect to be coincidence.

Titan Capital Group's fingerprints were all over this corporate sabotage.

Richard's fingers curled into fists against the mahogany desk.

"That public spectacle of yours," he hissed, "confessing your feelings like some lovesick schoolgirl—you've made us a laughingstock!"

The contracts had vanished within days of Evelyn's emotional outburst.

Alexander Whitmore wasn't just displeased—he was dismantling Richard's empire brick by brick.

"You're a liability," Richard spat, his voice dripping with venom. "Useless. Worse than useless—you're actively destroying this family!"

Evelyn met his glare without flinching.

The air between them crackled with unspoken threats.

Richard's next words came out in a dangerous whisper.

"When, Evelyn, will you stop being the architect of your own ruin?"

Somewhere in the house, a clock chimed ominously.

The game had changed.

And Evelyn wasn't about to lose.

The housekeeper emerged with a silver tray of steaming dishes just as the tension between them thickened. Evelyn casually strolled to the dining table and settled into her chair with deliberate grace.

"I've made myself perfectly clear," she said, lifting her chin. "I intend to be Alexander's wife. He's the only man I'll ever love, and I refuse to settle for anyone else."

Richard scoffed, his lips curling in derision. "Alexander? Marry you? Have you lost your mind? The man wouldn’t stoop so low—not when even his own nephew discarded you."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her fork, but her voice remained steady. "Let me correct you. I ended things with Ethan. I called off the engagement. He didn’t reject me—I walked away."

She set her fork down with a quiet clink. "And secondly, don’t measure Alexander by your own petty standards. You’ve never seen my worth, but he does. He knows exactly what I bring to the table."

Richard rolled his eyes, unimpressed. "Still delusional, I see. You really believe a man like him would ever marry you?"

Evelyn leaned forward, her gaze sharpening. "What if he does?"

The challenge hung in the air.

Richard barked out a laugh. "Then I’ll cut off my own head and let you kick it down the street like a damned soccer ball!"

Evelyn wrinkled her nose. "Ugh. What would I want with your head? It’s hardly a prize. Pick something else."

Evelyn casually spooned some broth into her porcelain bowl and took a delicate sip, her expression unreadable.

The rich flavor warmed her from within, comforting yet deceptive in its simplicity.

Across the table, Richard exchanged a knowing glance with Margaret. "Would you look at that? Our little girl's grown quite bold," he muttered under his breath.

Evelyn's silver spoon clinked against the fine china as she set it down. "What's the matter? Suddenly too cowardly to take my wager?"

Her frosty gaze swept across the dining room, lingering on each family member's face. "Hawthorne Estate belongs to me. When I marry Alexander, you'll all vacate the premises immediately."

The ancestral home had stood for generations, its walls whispering stories of the Hayes family legacy.

On his deathbed, William Hayes had divided his empire - half his shares to Evelyn, the remainder to her brother Oliver.

The estate itself was meant to be jointly inherited, but fate intervened before the paperwork could be finalized.

Vanessa, having been excluded from the will entirely, had manipulated Richard into transferring the deed to her name out of some twisted sense of compensation.

The irony wasn't lost on Evelyn. Eight hundred million dollars worth of family history, now belonging to a woman with no Hayes blood in her veins.

It equaled nearly her entire inheritance.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her napkin. "Well? Do we have a deal?" Her voice cut through the tension like shards of ice. "Or are you all as spineless as I remember?"

Richard's expression turned stormy at Evelyn's bold demand. "You're overreaching, aren't you? The audacity to claim the entire Hawthorne Estate and think you can cast us out? After everything we've done for you!"

"This estate was our birthright from Grandfather William," Evelyn countered coldly. "Yet you handed it to Vanessa without a second thought. If anyone should fear a ghostly reckoning, it's you—betraying your own blood for an outsider."

His jaw clenched. "Even if you have a claim, it's only to half! Or do you intend to steal your brother Oliver's inheritance too?"

The air between them crackled with tension, the weight of generations pressing down. Evelyn didn't flinch. "Justice isn't measured in halves, Father. And I won't settle for less than what's owed."

Richard's grip tightened on the armrest, veins standing out like cords. "You'll regret this."

A humorless smile touched her lips. "No. But you will."

###Chapter 109 A Fateful Meeting at Eclipse Lounge

"I'll give Oliver his share when the time comes," Evelyn answered calmly.

In Hawthorne Estate, Oliver had been the only one who truly cared for her. Though he'd left to study overseas years ago and hadn't returned since finishing high school.

Richard clenched his jaw, his voice tight with frustration. "Fine, I'll take that wager. If you don't marry Alexander, you forfeit your 8% stake in Horizon Enterprises!"

His greed was obvious—he wanted the inheritance William had left to protect her, the last lifeline her grandfather had secured for her.

Evelyn's lips curved into a cold smile. "Deal."

The unwavering confidence in her eyes unsettled Richard.

For a moment, he felt like he'd stepped right into a trap she had meticulously laid.

But he dismissed the thought just as quickly. There was no way a man like Alexander Whitmore would ever marry someone like her.

Halfway through dinner, Evelyn received an urgent call and had to excuse herself.

As she turned to leave, Vanessa watched her retreating figure, biting her lip before speaking. "I'm getting married in two days, and Evelyn can't even stay for a full meal. Mom, does she hate me?"

Before Margaret could answer, Evelyn, slipping on her heels by the door, smirked. "You think highly of yourself, don't you? Are you Alexander Whitmore or something? Why would I care about you?"

Without waiting for Vanessa's reaction, she strode out, the door clicking shut behind her.

Ethan's wedding was approaching, and his friends had arranged a wild bachelor party for him at Eclipse Lounge tonight.

The lounge pulsed with energy, packed with heirs of wealthy families, each surrounded by women in barely-there outfits. As the night wore on, inhibitions vanished—couples tangled on velvet couches, lost in heated embraces.

Coincidentally, it was also Alexander's birthday. Lucas had organized a more refined gathering for him at the same venue.

Unlike Ethan's raucous celebration, Alexander's party was subdued—mostly close friends, a few with their partners in tow.

Claire, having tracked Lucas down, dragged Evelyn along.

The moment Evelyn stepped inside, the contrasting atmospheres hit her. One side was pure decadence; the other, controlled elegance.

Her gaze flickered across the room—until it landed on Alexander.

He sat in a dimly lit corner, a glass of whiskey in hand, his sharp features illuminated by the soft glow. Their eyes met.

A beat of silence.

Then, chaos erupted on Ethan's side—a glass shattered, followed by drunken laughter.

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

Of all nights to run into him.

And of all places.

Claire had come prepared with divorce papers, intending to shove them in Lucas's face in front of all his friends and demand his signature.

But the moment they stepped into the dimly lit Eclipse Lounge, hesitation crept in.

"Why should men be the only ones enjoying themselves?" she muttered under her breath.

Spotting the most visible VIP booth, Claire tugged Evelyn down beside her.

"Did you hear? This place just hired some elite dancers—tall, sculpted, and ridiculously good-looking. Should we invite a couple over?" Claire suggested, mischief glinting in her eyes.

Before Evelyn could respond, Claire had already signaled the manager with an elegant flick of her wrist.

Leaning back like a queen holding court, Claire made her desires unmistakably clear.

The manager, sharp as ever, caught on immediately and disappeared with a knowing smirk.

Less than thirty seconds later, he returned with two stunning men in crisp white shirts and fitted black trousers.

Both towered well over six feet, their chiseled abs visible beneath the fabric, faces sculpted like Greek gods.

"Ladies, will these gentlemen suffice?" the manager asked smoothly.

Claire's lips curled into a satisfied smile as she studied them.

Evelyn, however, stiffened beside her, her gaze darting toward a shadowed corner of the lounge.

Because there, seated with his usual arrogant ease, was Lucas Bennett—watching them with dark, unreadable eyes.

Claire's gaze swept across the dimly lit room before suddenly reaching out to tilt a dancer's chin upward. The young man's cheeks flushed crimson instantly, his long lashes fluttering as he shyly averted his eyes.

He had that boy-next-door charm—sweet, innocent, and utterly endearing.

"He's perfect," Claire declared with a satisfied smirk. Without hesitation, the dancer slid onto the plush velvet seat beside her, his body pressing close enough that she could feel the warmth radiating from him.

The manager turned to Evelyn with a raised brow. "And for you, miss?"

Evelyn cleared her throat, shifting uncomfortably. "I'm good, thanks."

While Lucas Bennett and Claire were embroiled in a bitter divorce, and the crowded lounge made it impossible for Claire to search for him table by table, her bold move was clearly meant to provoke him into revealing himself.

But Evelyn's situation was entirely different.

She had just bared her heart to Alexander, confessing feelings that had simmered for far too long. The mere thought of being seen with a lounge dancer now felt like betrayal—like she was dancing on the edge of a precipice she had no intention of falling from.

###Chapter 110 I Won’t Allow It!

The second dancer, exuding a far more commanding presence, scowled when Evelyn rejected him.

Before the tension could escalate, Claire smoothly intervened. "No problem, stay right here. Let me get a feel of those muscles."

Evelyn had to look away, the scene becoming a little too intense for her comfort.

Then, out of nowhere, she sensed a pair of eyes burning into her from across the room. Instinctively, she turned—but saw no one.

The dancer poured drinks for Claire and, almost as an afterthought, slid one toward Evelyn as well.

As he lifted the glass to Claire’s lips, Evelyn leaned in, voice low. "Claire, don’t overdo it."

Her fingers brushed discreetly against Claire’s stomach, a silent reminder of the pregnancy she shouldn’t risk.

A short distance away, Ethan’s jaw tightened.

He had spotted Evelyn the second she walked in. She had deliberately chosen the most visible spot in Eclipse Lounge, sitting with perfect posture, as if challenging him to ignore her.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Evelyn sipped her drink, feigning indifference, but her fingers tapped restlessly against the glass.

Claire, oblivious to the undercurrents, laughed as the dancer whispered something in her ear.

Ethan’s grip on his own glass tightened.

He had told himself he wouldn’t interfere. That she could do whatever she wanted.

But seeing her here, surrounded by strangers, with that reckless glint in her eyes—

No.

He wouldn’t allow it.

Not like this.

Not when he knew exactly what she was trying to prove.

His chair scraped back as he stood.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

She didn’t turn.

But she knew.

He was coming.

Ethan's mouth twisted into a mocking smirk.

Evelyn's recent public declaration of love for Alexander had sent shockwaves through their social circle, and as her former fiancé, Ethan couldn't escape the humiliation.

The whispers were everywhere—people assumed Evelyn had acted out of spite, that she had shamelessly thrown herself at Alexander just to wound Ethan's pride.

In Ethan's mind, it was nothing but a classic case of love turned to bitter resentment.

"Is Evelyn really here, in this exact place, because she knew my bachelor party would be tonight? Is this some pathetic attempt to get my attention?"

"Has she finally cracked?"

His gaze darkened as he watched Evelyn flirt shamelessly with the club's lead dancer, who was eyeing her with unmistakable hunger, his hands drifting dangerously close to her waist.

"She wants a reaction? Fine. But this is crossing a line."

A surge of irritation prickled under his skin. He couldn't just sit there and watch this spectacle.

Trevor, who had been thoroughly distracted by the bunny girl in his lap, barely registered Ethan standing abruptly, drink in hand, until he was already halfway across the room.

"Ethan! Where the hell are you going?"

The Eclipse Lounge was packed with Cresthaven's elite tonight.

Several guests had already noticed Ethan Caldwell standing before Evelyn Carter.

Perhaps it was the weight of their collective stares or the rising whispers that finally caught Lucas Bennett's attention.

His gaze followed the crowd's focus, then his eyes darkened dangerously.

"Bloody hell! What's she doing now?"

Claire Dawson sat sandwiched between two male dancers, her hands shamelessly exploring their sculpted torsos.

A violent wave of possessiveness crashed through Lucas.

Yet most eyes remained fixed on Evelyn and Ethan. Their explosive history had become public spectacle, and everyone craved the next act. Few noticed Claire's scandalous behavior.

Lucas instinctively checked Alexander Whitmore's seat—empty.

Then he remembered. Alexander had excused himself to the restroom fifteen minutes ago. He'd be oblivious to this unfolding disaster.

Lucas fired off a frantic text before storming toward Claire with lethal intent.

At the lounge's center, Ethan glowered at Evelyn, his displeasure radiating like heat waves.

The moment Evelyn lifted her gaze, she found herself staring directly into Ethan's stormy eyes.

"Evelyn! You're here with some club dancer?" His voice dripped with disbelief.

Evelyn hadn't anticipated running into Ethan at the Eclipse Lounge, but she refused to let it rattle her. "What business is it of yours?"

The dancers had been Claire's idea, but she wasn't above using them to her advantage.

Ethan's jaw clenched, his expression darkening with barely restrained fury.

Before she could react, his hand shot out, gripping her wrist and yanking her away from the dancer. "I won't allow this!"

Evelyn stumbled, her balance faltering as she nearly collided with his chest.

She caught herself at the last second, wrenching her arm back. "Ethan, you're crossing a line. What I do is none of your concern! Have you lost your mind?"

Her words were sharp, but he didn’t release her.

Frustration boiled over. Without hesitation, Evelyn raised her hand and struck him—hard.

The sharp crack of the slap echoed through the lounge.

Ethan's head snapped to the side, but when his gaze returned to hers, the fire in his eyes only burned hotter.

Evelyn didn’t wait for his reaction. She turned on her heel and strode away, her pulse roaring in her ears.

She wouldn’t let him control her—not again.

Not ever.

###Chapter 111 Exposed

Ethan seized Evelyn's wrist, his grip tightening. "Evelyn, are you done yet? Don’t you feel ashamed?"

Her laugh was sharp, mocking. "Ashamed? Of what?"

"Of making a spectacle of yourself. Let’s go. I’m taking you home." He tugged her toward the exit, his jaw clenched.

Trevor blinked, stunned. Did I hear that right?

Ethan never bothered with Evelyn before. Since when did he care where she went?

Evelyn yanked her arm free. "What’s your problem? Who do you think you are, dragging me around? I don’t want anything to do with Vanessa’s man. Stay away from me."

The words Vanessa’s man hit Ethan like a slap.

For seven years, Evelyn had been the one trailing after him, earning the nickname "his shadow" from their friends.

Now, in her eyes, he was just Vanessa’s man—an object, a possession.

The shift was jarring.

Ethan’s expression darkened. "You’re drunk."

"Not drunk enough to forget who you belong to," she shot back, stepping away.

Trevor whistled under his breath. Damn.

This wasn’t the Evelyn he knew.

The Evelyn who used to hang on Ethan’s every word, who never dared to defy him, was gone.

In her place stood a woman with fire in her eyes and steel in her voice.

Ethan reached for her again. "I said we’re leaving."

Evelyn dodged his grasp. "Touch me again, and I’ll make sure Vanessa hears all about how hands-on you’ve been tonight."

A threat.

A real one.

Ethan froze.

Trevor choked on his drink. Holy hell.

Since when did Evelyn play dirty?

The tension crackled between them, thick enough to cut.

Then, from the shadows, a smooth voice cut in.

"Problem here?"

Alexander Whitmore stepped into the light, his gaze flicking between them.

Evelyn’s breath caught.

Ethan’s jaw tightened.

And Trevor?

He just grinned.

This just got interesting.

From this moment forward, it would only be Vanessa.

Evelyn shoved him away, putting deliberate distance between them.

A sharp shriek pierced the air—Claire’s voice.

Evelyn’s head snapped toward the sound. When she turned, her eyes widened. Lucas had somehow managed to grab Claire and hoist her effortlessly onto his shoulders.

Claire hadn’t even noticed him approaching. One second, she was standing, the next, her feet left the ground in a dizzying lurch.

With practiced ease, Lucas adjusted his grip, carrying her as if she weighed nothing more than a sack of flour.

Claire’s expression darkened instantly. “You absolute jerk! Put me down right now! I was in the middle of drinking with those gorgeous guys!”

“Gorgeous?” Lucas scoffed. “Those are paid escorts. Dozens of women have had their hands all over them. You really want to risk catching something?”

“So what? I don’t care!” Claire shot back, struggling against his hold. “At least they’re way hotter than you!”

She had always been quick with her words, never backing down from an argument. “And we weren’t just drinking—we were going to get a room after!”

“Hotter than me?” Lucas’s lips curled into a dangerous smirk. He turned his head slightly, casting a cold glance at the two frozen male escorts standing nearby.

The dim lights of Eclipse Lounge pulsed with energy as Lucas Bennett tightened his grip around Claire Dawson's waist.

"You're seriously choosing them over me?" His voice dripped with mock offense, lips curling into that infuriating smirk she knew too well.

Claire rolled her eyes, but the heat creeping up her neck betrayed her.

"Lucas, don't be ridiculous. They're just—"

"Just what?" He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "If you have needs, sweetheart, all you had to do was ask. As your husband, it's my privilege to satisfy you." His fingers traced the curve of her hip. "But since you initiated this, don’t come crying to me later when you can’t walk straight."

Before she could retort, he swept her off her feet.

"Put me down, you arrogant—!" Claire thrashed, fists pounding against his chest, but Lucas didn’t so much as flinch. His arms were steel bands, unyielding as he carried her past the gawking crowd.

The moment they disappeared through the exit, the two gigolos exchanged glances before slinking toward Evelyn Carter.

One of them, a blond with a practiced smile, sidled up to her. "Miss, you look like you could use some company." His fingers brushed her arm.

Evelyn recoiled, shooting a venomous glare at Ethan Caldwell.

The other gigolo snorted. "Dude, her man’s right there."

"He is not my man!" Evelyn snapped, dropping back onto the velvet couch with enough force to make the ice in her glass clink.

The blond, undeterred, leaned closer—until Ethan’s knuckles cracked audibly.

Evelyn bolted upright, nearly knocking over her drink. "Touch me again, and I’ll break your fingers."

The gigolos exchanged another look.

This wasn’t worth the paycheck.

"You...you should leave now," she stammered.

The two male escorts exchanged glances before nodding. "Then settle the bill, please."

Evelyn froze. Claire hadn’t paid earlier?

"How much?" she asked, her voice tight.

"Sixty thousand dollars."

Her breath hitched. "Excuse me?"

"Sixty thousand dollars," one repeated, his tone indifferent.

They had barely spent twenty minutes with them. Sixty thousand?

Her fingers trembled as she reached for her phone.

This couldn’t be happening.

###Chapter 112 The Mask Slips Off

"Sweetheart, we don't work for free. This is our standard rate," the male escort said with a practiced smile.

Ethan Caldwell scoffed, crossing his arms. "So, Evelyn, you were putting on airs, hiring escorts to keep you company, but forgot to check your bank balance first?"

Amusement danced in Ethan's eyes. He had noticed immediately that it was Claire who had called these men over—Evelyn had been keeping her distance the entire time.

The thought that she might still be pining for him sent a rush of satisfaction through his veins.

"Since you're clearly broke, why don't you beg me nicely? I might take pity on you." Ethan lounged back in his seat, swirling his whiskey with deliberate arrogance.

He was offering her an out. A humiliating one, but an out nonetheless.

Evelyn didn’t flinch. Instead, she reached into her clutch with deliberate calm and produced a sleek black card. "Save your charity. I can handle my own bills."

The truth was, Evelyn had only just started her new position at Titan Capital Group. Her first paycheck hadn’t even cleared yet.

This card was the one Alexander Whitmore had given her on their wedding day. Unlimited spending, he’d said. She’d never tested it before tonight, but she was certain at least sixty grand was available.

The escorts exchanged glances. One of them discreetly pulled out a card reader.

Evelyn’s fingers didn’t tremble as she tapped the card against the machine.

A beat of silence.

Then—

Declined.

Ethan’s laughter was sharp enough to cut glass. "Oh, this is priceless."

Claire gasped. "Evie, what’s going on?"

Evelyn’s throat went dry. No. That’s impossible.

She tried again.

Declined.

The second escort’s smile turned icy. "Miss Carter, we don’t appreciate being played."

Ethan leaned forward, his voice dripping with mock concern. "Looks like your rich husband’s credit line isn’t as unlimited as you thought."

Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A notification lit up the screen:

Account Frozen – Pending Investigation.

Her stomach dropped.

Alexander had cut her off.

And he hadn’t even warned her.

The sun had barely set when Evelyn found herself in this predicament.

She never planned to use this card—not like this. But sixty thousand dollars was no small sum, and desperation had clawed its way into her chest.

Just a temporary solution, she told herself. I’ll pay it back the moment I can.

Across the table, the gigolo’s smirk widened as he swiped the black card through the reader. His eyes gleamed with greed.

Ethan Caldwell watched, his fingers tightening around his glass.

That wasn’t just any card.

It was a Horizon Enterprises VIP—the kind reserved for clients with nine-figure net worths. A secondary card, yes, but still…

Where the hell had Evelyn gotten this?

And more importantly—who held the primary?

Alexander Whitmore’s phone buzzed the second he stepped out of the restroom.

The notification made his blood freeze.

[Secondary Card ••••1224: $60,000 charged at Eclipse Lounge. Memo: Entertainment Services.]

His jaw locked.

That was his card.

The one he’d given Evelyn on their wedding day.

She’d never touched it. Not once.

Until tonight.

And of all places—a lounge known for its escorts.

His knuckles whitened around his phone.

This wasn’t just a transaction.

It was a declaration.

And he would get answers.

The crisp sound of bills being counted filled the private booth.

Evelyn had just spent a small fortune.

But not on anything respectable - she'd paid for the company of male escorts.

Alexander's piercing gaze darkened as he strode toward the Eclipse Lounge's main hall.

The moment he stepped inside, his attention zeroed in on Evelyn and Ethan Caldwell occupying the VIP section.

The paid companions were leaving, pockets heavier, after Evelyn settled their fees.

Suddenly, Evelyn's neck prickled with unease.

An icy sensation crawled down her spine like frozen fingertips.

She whipped around, but only saw the pulsating crowd on the dance floor.

"Must be imagining things," she muttered, shaking off the feeling.

Her wandering eyes then caught Ethan and his entourage nearby.

Each wealthy playboy had a scantily-clad woman draped over them.

Some were locked in passionate embraces while others explored beneath clothing.

"Is this your bachelor party?" Evelyn called out, voice laced with sarcasm. "Does Vanessa know about this little celebration?"

The air grew thick with tension as Ethan's friends froze mid-action.

Evelyn recognized them all - spoiled heirs from Cresthaven's elite families.

Her fingers tightened around her champagne flute.

The bitter liquid burned her throat as she drained the glass.

Across the room, Alexander's jaw clenched.

His knuckles turned white against the whiskey tumbler.

The game was about to change.

And Evelyn Carter had no idea what was coming.

The dim lighting of Eclipse Lounge cast long shadows across the velvet couches. Two scantily clad women draped themselves over Ethan's thighs, their laughter thick with artificial sweetness. The air smelled of expensive whiskey and cheap perfume—a nauseating combination that made my skin crawl.

Spotting Ethan sitting alone, Evelyn let out a derisive chuckle. "Now that you're here, drop the act. Where's your little shadow?"

Ethan's expression remained impassive. "I don't have one."

This whole mess was Trevor's idea—a last-minute bachelor party before Ethan's upcoming wedding.

Not that Ethan cared for these kinds of gatherings. His so-called friends had arranged the entertainment, but he hadn't so much as glanced at the women. To him, the whole scene was distasteful.

As Evelyn and Ethan exchanged words, a tall, imposing figure strode past them, his presence commanding the room without effort.

The air shifted.

Something was about to change.

###Chapter 113 Indifference

The afternoon light filtered through the tall windows, casting long shadows across the polished floor.

Alexander moved with deliberate grace, his strides measured, his expression unreadable. A crisp white tissue rested between his fingers, its edges pristine.

He lifted his hand, the motion smooth and controlled, and brushed the tissue over his palm, wiping away the faint traces of moisture. His hands were broad, the veins tracing subtle lines beneath his skin—hands that commanded, hands that never faltered.

The air around him was cool, detached, as if he existed in a space separate from the rest of the world.

Evelyn’s breath caught in her throat.

She hadn’t expected to see him here.

Her pulse quickened, her fingers tightening around the edge of her seat.

Of course he’s here.

Lucas and Alexander were close. If Lucas had been invited, it was only natural that Alexander would be too.

She couldn’t tear her gaze away.

There was something magnetic about the way he carried himself—untouchable, yet impossible to ignore.

Before she could stop herself, she rose from her chair, her body moving on instinct.

"Evelyn!"

Ethan’s voice cut through her thoughts, sharp with warning.

He stood abruptly, his grip tightening around his glass, his knuckles whitening.

The ice in his drink clinked softly, the sound jarring in the sudden silence.

Evelyn hesitated, her eyes still fixed on Alexander.

But he didn’t look back.

Not once.

The moment Alexander Whitmore entered the room, Ethan Caldwell noticed the immediate shift in Evelyn Carter's attention.

Even seated right beside her, Ethan might as well have been invisible. Evelyn's gaze locked onto Alexander as if under a spell.

A shadow crossed Ethan's face. He had always dismissed Evelyn's public confession of love for Alexander as nothing more than a calculated performance.

But now, the way she barely registered his presence sent an unsettling realization creeping into his mind—Evelyn truly no longer cared for him.

As she walked past, Ethan's hand twitched with the instinct to grab her wrist, to force her to acknowledge him. But his fingers closed around empty air.

Evelyn didn't spare him so much as a glance.

The sting of rejection twisted inside him, darkening his expression.

Without hesitation, Evelyn took the seat beside Alexander in full view of everyone.

Subtle glances were exchanged across the room.

So it's true, they thought. She really did kiss him in public without hesitation. And now she's bold enough to claim the spot right next to him.

The whispers were inevitable.

But Evelyn didn't seem to care.

And that indifference cut deeper than any insult ever could.

Alexander showed no reaction to Evelyn's presence.

His eyes remained shut, fingers pressed lightly against his temple as though nursing a headache—or perhaps simply uninterested. The air between them might as well have been frozen.

Evelyn's gaze flickered to the table. A half-finished birthday cake sat there, smudged with fingerprints where someone had dragged a careless hand through the frosting.

"Whose birthday is it?" she wondered.

Before she could dwell on it, Sebastian approached, wineglass raised. "Happy birthday, Alex," he said, nudging Alexander's shoulder.

Alexander cracked one eye open, lifted his own glass in a half-hearted salute, but didn't drink.

Sebastian downed his wine in a single gulp, then turned the empty glass upside down with a grin. "Your turn."

Evelyn blinked. Alexander's birthday?

Sebastian, still hovering, smirked at her before addressing Alexander again. "Come on, man. She's right here beside you. Talk to her. Twenty-nine years single, and the first woman brave enough to approach you gets the ice king treatment?" He winked at Evelyn. "Don’t mind him. He’s allergic to charm."

Alexander exhaled through his nose but otherwise didn’t move.

Evelyn clenched her fingers around her clutch, the beaded surface biting into her palm. The music thrummed around them, laughter and clinking glasses a stark contrast to the glacial silence between her and the birthday man.

Sebastian rolled his eyes. "See? This is why you’re still—"

"Sebastian." Alexander’s voice was low, a warning.

Sebastian held up his hands in surrender but shot Evelyn an apologetic look. "Good luck," he mouthed before sauntering off.

Evelyn swallowed. The cake, the indifference, the way Alexander hadn’t so much as glanced at her—it all coiled into a knot in her stomach.

She should leave.

But something—maybe stubbornness, maybe the champagne—made her stay.

Alexander turned his head slightly, his icy gaze sweeping over Evelyn before looking away without a word.

Just then, Ethan approached.

Noticing how close Evelyn was sitting to Alexander, Ethan hesitated for a split second. But when he saw the complete lack of acknowledgment from Alexander, a smug satisfaction flickered in his eyes.

"Uncle Alexander, I heard today's your birthday?" Ethan tore his gaze away, picking up a glass of wine and pouring himself a generous amount. "I've been so caught up with wedding preparations lately that I completely forgot. I'll make sure to get you a proper gift later."

Alexander barely spared him a glance. "Hmm."

Instead of leaving, Ethan smirked at Evelyn, his tone dripping with mockery. "What’s this? Tired of chasing after gigolos and now bothering my uncle instead?"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her glass, but she kept her expression neutral.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Alexander remained silent, his indifference cutting deeper than any words.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, refusing to let Ethan’s taunts get to her.

But inside, her heart twisted.

She had hoped for even a flicker of warmth from Alexander.

Instead, all she got was frost.
###Chapter 114 Go to Hell

The moment Ethan spoke, Alexander's piercing gaze shifted from him to Evelyn’s face.

A bone-chilling coldness flickered in Alexander’s eyes.

Evelyn’s breath hitched when she recognized that look—he had misunderstood everything.

Her pulse raced as she blurted, "What nonsense are you spouting? This has nothing to do with me. My heart belongs only to Alexander."

Alexander had been in the restroom earlier and missed the moment when she and Claire had playfully ordered male escorts.

Given that Claire was still technically married to Lucas, Evelyn couldn’t throw her best friend under the bus, no matter how desperate she was to clear her own name.

So she denied it outright.

Ethan let out a derisive laugh, his lips curling in scorn. "Brave enough to do it, but too cowardly to own up?"

Alexander’s fingers tightened around his glass at Evelyn’s declaration of devotion.

His expression darkened as his attention locked onto her face.

The tension in the room was palpable.

Evelyn could feel Ethan's piercing gaze burning into her, his expression dark with disapproval.

Realizing Alexander might have gotten the wrong idea, Evelyn quickly spoke up. "The rumors about the escorts—it's not what he's implying. Don't believe him."

Ethan scoffed, his irritation flaring as he watched Evelyn rush to explain herself to Alexander.

His jaw tightened. "You have the nerve to show up here empty-handed? Did you even bring a gift for Uncle Alexander?"

Evelyn had arrived with nothing in her hands, and Ethan was determined to expose her. He had always questioned her sincerity, and now, with his friends watching, he wanted to strip away her facade.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, then lifted her gaze—only to meet Alexander's deep, unreadable eyes.

A small smile curved her lips before she reached up, fingers brushing against the delicate chain around her neck.

Slowly, deliberately, she pulled the thin red cord free, revealing a pendant that had been hidden beneath her collar.

The moment the pendant came into view, Ethan's face drained of color.

His breath hitched.

Because he recognized it.

And so did Alexander.

The realization struck Ethan like lightning.

That delicate pendant had adorned Evelyn's neck since their fateful first encounter, a constant presence he'd grown accustomed to seeing. Though he'd never inquired about its origins, its perpetual presence spoke volumes about its significance to her.

Yet here she stood, prepared to gift this cherished heirloom to Alexander for his birthday?

A pang of regret twisted in Ethan's gut. He never should have suggested the birthday gift idea.

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she unfastened the silver chain.

The pendant caught the dim lighting of Eclipse Lounge, its intricate carvings casting delicate shadows across her palms. The polished surface gleamed with an ethereal glow, like moonlight captured in amber.

Cradling it with reverence, she extended it toward Alexander.

"This has been my talisman for ten years," she murmured, voice thick with emotion. "My constant companion through every storm." Her lashes fluttered as she met his gaze. "Happy birthday, Alexander."

Alexander's breath hitched.

He recognized this piece instantly—the very token Ethan had given her all those years ago in gratitude.

The fact she'd worn it daily for a decade sent an unexpected ache through his chest. The weight of that loyalty, that constancy, settled over him like a physical force.

Eclipse Lounge's ambient jazz faded into white noise as the pendant swung gently between them, catching fractured light like scattered memories.

Alexander hesitated, realizing the pendant now belonged to Evelyn since he had gifted it to her. Taking it back would be unreasonable.

Besides, this particular pendant held...

Just then, a drunken man staggered toward them in the dimly lit Eclipse Lounge.

Concealed within his sleeve was a sharp blade, while his other hand clumsily gripped a nearly empty wine bottle—a poor disguise for his true intentions.

When Evelyn turned, her eyes widened as the man suddenly brandished the dagger, slurring, "Alexander Whitmore, go to hell!"

The assailant feigned intoxication as he closed the distance between them.

Amidst the chaotic noise and shadowy corners of the bar, no one noticed the glint of steel in the drunk’s hand—least of all Alexander, whose back was turned.

The attacker seized the advantage of Alexander’s blind spot, raising the dagger high, poised to strike.

###Chapter 115 The Hidden Threat

Evelyn's entire body went rigid. Without thinking, she threw her arms around Alexander's waist and shoved him backward, trying to shield him from the sudden attack.

Alexander stumbled from the force of her push, landing hard on the sofa behind him.

As Evelyn pressed against his chest, she could feel the solid warmth of his body beneath her, his muscles tense with readiness.

The drunken assailant missed his first strike but recovered quickly, raising the dagger again with a snarl.

Alexander's gaze locked with Evelyn's for a split second before he abruptly pushed her aside and stepped in front of her.

Before anyone could react, Alexander's foot lashed out in a sharp kick, striking the man's wrist with brutal precision.

The dagger clattered to the floor, its silver blade glinting ominously under the dim lights of Eclipse Lounge.

The attacker's expression twisted in rage. Undeterred, he swung the bottle in his other hand straight at Alexander's head.

Alexander saw the drunk's lunge coming before it happened. His body moved instinctively, his polished leather shoe connecting with the man's temple in a perfect arc. The bottle slipped from the drunk's fingers, shattering against the floor in a spray of glass.

For a brief, suspended moment, the man swayed.

His arms flailed wildly, grasping at nothing but air. Then, with a heavy thud, he crashed onto the hardwood, his body sprawled out in an ungainly heap. A groan escaped him, his face twisted in pain and fury. That had to hurt.

The entire bar froze.

Whispers about Alexander's decade-long training at the police academy had always floated around, but no one expected him to move like that.

Even with the drunk wielding a weapon, Alexander had taken him down effortlessly. His composure never wavered—not a single hair out of place, not a single breath too quick.

That kick had been straight out of an action movie. Flawless.

And he had done it in a tailored suit and dress shoes.

If he had been in something looser, something meant for movement—just how much more dangerous would he be?

The music cut off abruptly as the commotion registered. The manager of Eclipse Lounge rushed over, flanked by security, ready to haul the drunk away before things escalated further.

Alexander advanced, his polished shoe pressing down on the drunkard's face with deliberate force. "Who paid you to come here?" His voice was ice.

The man beneath him trembled, eyes squeezed shut in terror. Under the crushing weight, drool and mucus smeared across the floor. "Alexander Whitmore," he choked out, "you'll burn for this!"

With chilling calm, Alexander crouched lower, fingers closing around the man's throat.

"I may or may not burn," he murmured, lips curling into a smile that held no warmth. "But I can guarantee you'll get there first."

He released him with a flick of disgust, wiping his hand clean with a handkerchief as if touching filth.

"Restrain him," Alexander ordered without turning. "Deliver him to the authorities."

Evelyn had never witnessed this side of him before. By the time she processed what had happened, the staff had already erased all traces of the altercation.

Music swelled again, the scene seamlessly restored as though nothing had occurred.

Alexander lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around his sharp features as his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

"Ms. Carter," he drawled, exhaling slowly. "You saved me. Tell me—what do you desire in return?"

Alexander's fingers drummed lightly against the leather armrest, the rhythmic tapping barely audible over the crackle of burning tobacco. A haze of smoke curled around him, veiling his sharp features in a mist of gray. Yet, despite the obscurity, Evelyn couldn't shake the magnetic pull of his presence.

She hadn’t saved him.

It had been pure instinct—a reflexive shove, nothing more.

His survival had been his own doing—quick reflexes, honed instincts.

Still, her mind raced. Who would dare target Alexander Whitmore?

Had he crossed someone powerful without realizing it?

But this wasn’t just a warning. The drunk had moved with lethal intent.

Alexander exhaled slowly, the smoke swirling between them. His gaze flickered to her, a silent question lingering in the depths of his piercing eyes. He didn’t press, didn’t speak. Instead, he took another deliberate drag, waiting.

The silence stretched, thick with unspoken tension.

Evelyn swallowed.

What did he want from her?

###Chapter 116 The Coward's Retreat

The air crackled with tension as Ethan Caldwell let out a derisive laugh. "Evelyn, did you pay off that drunk? Clever move!" His voice dripped with venom. "Alexander, don't let her manipulate you."

Unease coiled in Ethan’s gut.

Alexander Whitmore never wasted words on women, yet his tone with Evelyn had shifted—subtle but undeniable.

Ethan feared what she might demand.

Tonight’s crowd was hungry for drama, and he refused to be their entertainment.

Alexander’s gaze sharpened, slicing through Ethan like ice. "Since when do I take orders from you?"

Ethan’s mouth snapped shut.

He wouldn’t dare challenge Alexander. Instead, he shot Evelyn a warning glare—Don’t push your luck.

The room held its breath.

All eyes locked onto Evelyn, anticipation thick in the air.

Then—

She simply shook her head.

A silent refusal.

The crowd murmured, disappointment flickering through them.

Ethan’s pulse spiked. What game is she playing now?

Alexander studied her, something unreadable in his expression.

Evelyn met his gaze, calm. Unyielding.

The standoff stretched, tension winding tighter.

Then—

A slow smirk curved Alexander’s lips.

Ethan’s stomach dropped.

This isn’t over.

The ambient lighting of Eclipse Lounge cast long shadows across Alexander Whitmore's sharp features as Evelyn Carter rose from her seat.

"I only came to wish you a happy birthday, Alexander," she said softly, fingers brushing against the edge of the table. "Please don't drink too much—it's not good for you."

Her gaze flickered toward the exit. "It's late. I should go."

Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked away, the click of her heels echoing in the sudden silence.

Alexander's piercing stare followed her retreating figure, lingering on the delicate curve of her wrist before his expression darkened.

Sebastian Cole scoffed, swirling his whiskey. "Seriously? Alexander actually gave her an opening, and she just... left?" He shook his head in disbelief. "After all that bold chasing, I expected her to demand something outrageous—like marriage."

Ethan Caldwell's jaw tightened. "Sebastian, shut up. There's no way Uncle Alexander would ever marry someone like her."

The words dripped with disdain, but Sebastian merely smirked.

Evelyn had been relentless in her pursuit of Alexander lately—so much so that many speculated she was only doing it to provoke Ethan.

Yet now, when presented with an opportunity, she had backed down.

Coward.

Sebastian leaned back, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Funny how the bravado disappears when it counts, isn't it?"

Ethan shot him a warning glare, but Sebastian only shrugged, unbothered.

Alexander remained silent, his fingers tightening around his glass.

The air thickened with unspoken tension.

Evelyn had walked away.

And for the first time, Alexander found himself wondering—why?

Alexander Whitmore had always been fearless. Coming from one of the wealthiest families in Cresthaven, he never hesitated to face any challenge head-on.

"You're not Alexander. How could you possibly know what he's thinking?" Lucas Bennett scoffed, crossing his arms. "What if he actually marries her? Right, Alex?"

Silence followed.

Lucas frowned. "Huh? Where did he go?"

The group turned, only to realize Alexander had slipped away unnoticed.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter found herself in the emergency room in the dead of night.

The chaos at Eclipse Lounge had ended with a shattered bottle, and a sharp fragment had sliced across her wrist.

At first, the adrenaline had numbed the pain. But as the night wore on, the throbbing intensified.

Two deep gashes marred her skin, still glistening with traces of blood.

She had tried to bandage it herself, but the awkward angle made it impossible.

The doctor examined the wound carefully. "You made the right call coming in," he said, adjusting his glasses. "There's a shard embedded in the tissue. If left untreated, it could cause complications later."

Evelyn exhaled, relieved she hadn’t ignored it.

But as the nurse prepped the anesthetic, her thoughts drifted back to Alexander’s sudden disappearance.

Had he really walked out on them?

Or was there something else going on?

The antiseptic stung as Dr. Wells cleaned Evelyn's wound, his tweezers meticulously extracting each tiny shard of glass.

She bit her lip, refusing to make a sound.

An hour later, her wrist was neatly wrapped in sterile gauze, the throbbing pain dulled but persistent.

Evelyn checked her phone—1:17 AM.

Exhaustion weighed on her shoulders as she stepped out of the emergency room. The streets were quiet, the usual bustle of Cresthaven subdued at this hour.

She hesitated, thumb hovering over the ride-hailing app.

Then she looked up—and froze.

Alexander stood there, his coat draped over one arm, his expression unreadable in the dim glow of the hospital lights.

Her breath caught.

What was he doing here?

Had he followed her?

Or had he been waiting all along?

The questions tangled in her mind, but before she could voice any of them, he stepped forward, his voice low.

"Let's go home."

Two words.

Simple.

Yet they unraveled something inside her.

She didn't argue.

She didn't ask how he knew where she was.

She just nodded.

And for the first time that night, she didn't feel alone.

###Chapter 117 Always Be There for Her

Alexander leaned against the sleek hood of his car, a cigarette dangling between his fingers. The night air was cool, his crisp white shirt unbuttoned at the top. His piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn the moment she stepped out of the hospital doors.

Is he here for me? Evelyn wondered.

Midnight had settled over the city, casting the hospital corridors in muted shadows. The ember at the tip of Alexander’s cigarette flickered like a tiny beacon in the dark.

She walked toward him, her steps measured.

Lately, they had perfected the art of discretion in public. But now, with the streets nearly empty, there was no need for pretense.

Alexander’s expression was unreadable—until his eyes landed on the stark white bandage wrapped around Evelyn’s wrist. His jaw tightened.

“You’re hurt,” he stated, voice low.

Evelyn shrugged, feigning indifference. “It’s nothing. Just a scratch. It’ll heal soon.”

“Let me see,” he demanded, stepping closer.

His fingers brushed against her skin as he carefully examined the injury. The warmth of his touch sent an unexpected shiver down her spine.

She swallowed.

The silence between them stretched, heavy with unspoken words.

Then, without warning, Alexander pulled her into his arms.

Evelyn stiffened for a second before melting into his embrace. His heartbeat thudded steadily against her ear, a silent reassurance.

“You should’ve called me,” he murmured into her hair.

She exhaled, tension seeping out of her. “I didn’t want to bother you.”

Alexander pulled back just enough to look into her eyes. His thumb traced her cheek.

“You’ll never be a bother,” he said firmly. “Not to me.”

Evelyn’s breath caught.

The streetlights flickered overhead, casting their entwined shadows onto the pavement.

For the first time in weeks, she allowed herself to lean on him—fully, completely.

And he held her like he’d never let go.

Evelyn lifted her hand, her elbow bending slightly as she reached toward Alexander.

His fingers closed around hers, their hands locking together in an instant.

Before Evelyn could react, Alexander's strong arms encircled her, pulling her firmly against his chest.

His palm settled at the small of her back, drawing her closer until the warmth of his body seeped into hers. The rich, intoxicating scent of sandalwood and aged whiskey clung to him, making her head spin.

"Why did you push me away instead of moving yourself?" Alexander murmured, his voice rough with concern. "If that drunk had been faster, you could've been hurt. Do you realize that?"

The truth was, though the man had been aiming for Alexander, Evelyn had been standing close enough to be caught in the chaos.

Yet her first instinct had been to shove Alexander out of harm's way—putting herself at risk instead.

Alexander exhaled sharply, pressing his lips to the crown of her hair.

Evelyn listened to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat beneath her ear before whispering, "Because I couldn’t stand the thought of you getting hurt."

For a heartbeat, Alexander froze. Then his arms tightened around her, holding her as if he never intended to let go.

The thought haunted him.

"She'd rather push me away, even if it means getting hurt. Is she doing this... for me?" Alexander's chest tightened.

The silence between them had stretched too long.

"When are you coming home?" he finally asked, voice rough with unspoken longing.

He missed Evelyn—missed her warmth, her scent, the way her laughter filled their home.

Lately, to maintain their act at Titan Capital Group, he'd forced himself to ignore her. Every glance, every accidental brush of their hands, sent fire through his veins.

It was torture.

More than once, he'd nearly broken. Nearly pulled her into his arms right there in the office, consequences be damned.

The house felt hollow without her.

Her presence lingered—in the sheets they'd shared, in the kitchen where she'd hummed while making coffee, in every damn corner.

Just stepping through the front door flooded his mind with memories. Evelyn beneath him, gasping his name, her nails scoring his back—

Alexander exhaled sharply, dragging a hand through his hair.

"After Vanessa and Ethan's wedding," Evelyn said suddenly, pulling him from the heated recollection. "Take me to the Whitmore family."

Tradition demanded the bride pay respects to the elders.

And Evelyn intended to make sure Vanessa knelt before her.

Alexander’s gaze never wavered as he gave her a slow, deliberate nod.

Two days.

After waiting an entire decade, two days felt like nothing.

His eyes remained fixed ahead, his voice steady and resolute. "Do whatever you need to do. If you want to destroy Ethan Caldwell, then do it. From now on, you can act as recklessly as you please. Just remember—no matter what happens, I’ll handle the fallout."

Evelyn’s breath caught. She hadn’t expected Alexander to give her this much freedom, this much power.

They climbed into the car. After a brief hesitation, Evelyn finally voiced the question lingering in her mind. "What was that about the drunk guy tonight?"

Alexander's piercing gaze darkened. "The investigation is still ongoing."

"Do they have any leads?" Evelyn shuddered at the memory. She had merely been enjoying a drink at Eclipse Lounge when death nearly claimed her.

Thankfully, Alexander had been sober that night. Had he been intoxicated, the outcome would have been catastrophic.

He exhaled sharply, clearly reluctant to elaborate. "Some grudges from my police academy days might have resurfaced."

Evelyn nodded slowly. That explanation made sense.

"I recall you used to practice acupuncture." Alexander's voice grew quieter, his mind drifting to that fateful night years ago.

Had Evelyn not intervened with her precise needlework to stem his bleeding, he wouldn't have survived the decade-old injury.

Yet after weeks of living together, he'd never once seen her medical kit in their home.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the seatbelt.

"That... was a lifetime ago," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. The dashboard lights cast shadows across her downcast face. "I haven't touched a needle in years."

The unspoken question hung heavily between them as the car sped through the neon-lit streets of Cresthaven. Somewhere in the distance, a siren wailed.
###Chapter 118 Drove Her Home

The silence stretched between them like an unspoken agreement.

Noticing Evelyn's reluctance to elaborate, Alexander chose not to press further.

If she wasn't ready to share tonight, he could wait. He had all the time in the world for her.

The city lights of Cresthaven blurred past as the car glided through the streets. Neon signs flickered against the dark sky, casting fleeting shadows across Alexander's sharp profile.

At a red light, his fingers tapped idly against the steering wheel before he finally broke the quiet.

"So," he began, voice deceptively casual, "how was the experience of drinking with male escorts?"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Her head snapped toward him, eyes wide with disbelief. He knew?

The traffic light turned green.

A horn blared impatiently behind them before Alexander finally accelerated.

Evelyn twisted her fingers together in her lap. "It wasn't me," she said quickly. "Claire arranged it."

Alexander arched a brow. "She booked them and charged it to your card?" His tone made it clear he wasn't buying it.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Lucas took her away before things got out of hand, so I—"

The Willowbrook Apartments came into view.

Alexander braked smoothly, bringing the car to a stop at the alley entrance. The engine hummed softly in the sudden stillness.

Outside, the city pulsed with life—cars rushing past, distant laughter floating through the air. But inside the car, the air was thick with unspoken words.

Evelyn hesitated, her hand hovering over the door handle.

Alexander turned to face her fully, his gaze intense. "We'll talk about this later."

It wasn't a request.

Evelyn swallowed hard and nodded before stepping out into the night.

The car door clicked shut behind her, sealing the tension inside.

The apartment building had strict women-only access, leaving Alexander no choice but to remain in the car.

With a swift motion, he wrapped an arm around Evelyn's slender waist, pulling her effortlessly toward him.

Evelyn gasped as she suddenly found herself straddling Alexander's lap, her hands instinctively bracing against his broad shoulders.

Alexander reclined the seat slightly. The car's tinted windows ensured complete privacy from prying eyes outside.

His fingers tangled in her hair, guiding her face closer until their lips hovered mere inches apart. Evelyn's breath hitched, her pulse racing.

But as she shifted, a sharp pain shot through her injured wrist. She winced, biting back a cry.

Alexander's expression darkened. In one fluid movement, he flipped their positions, pinning Evelyn beneath him, his body caging her in.

Their eyes locked. Moonlight spilled through the windows, casting shadows across Alexander's striking features—his jawline sharp, his gaze smoldering.

Evelyn's cheeks burned under his intense scrutiny.

Lowering his head, Alexander traced a slow, teasing path along the delicate curve of her neck with his tongue. His breath was hot against her skin, sending shivers down her spine.

She arched involuntarily, her fingers tightening in his shirt.

The air between them crackled with tension, thick and unspoken.

Outside, the world faded away.

Inside the car, there was only them.

His warm breath caressed the delicate shell of her ear.

Alexander's lips brushed against Evelyn's skin as he murmured, "Darling, I thought you wanted me to take action."

A shiver raced down Evelyn's spine at his words. She swallowed hard, her voice barely above a whisper. "That's not... what I meant."

"Is that so?" Alexander's voice was rough with desire, the low timbre vibrating through the confined space of the car.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered shut as her pulse skyrocketed. The hard planes of Alexander's body pressed insistently against hers, leaving no doubt about his current state of arousal. The heat between them was palpable, thickening the air until each breath felt like fire in her lungs.

Her fingers curled into the leather seats as she fought to maintain control. But with Alexander's intoxicating scent surrounding her and his muscular frame caging her in, resistance was becoming increasingly difficult.

The streetlights flickered outside, casting fleeting shadows across his sharp features. In that moment, Evelyn realized there would be no escaping what came next.

###Chapter 119 A Passionate Moment in the Car

"Really," Evelyn murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

"But I want more." Alexander's lips grazed the delicate skin of Evelyn's neck, sending shivers down her spine.

The teasing touch made her tremble, her breath hitching.

Then, his rough voice, thick with desire, whispered against her ear, "Evelyn, how do you plan to make this up to me?"

Her pulse raced.

Trapped beneath him, her cheeks burned with heat, her entire body acutely aware of his presence.

Alexander knew exactly how to unravel her. His warm breath fanned across her flushed skin, and her heart pounded wildly, beyond her control.

They were so close, their breaths mingling, heavy and uneven.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered before she squeezed her eyes shut.

She expected his kiss, her lips parting slightly in anticipation.

Instead, Alexander smirked, tracing the curve of her swollen lips with his cool fingertips before trailing down to the sensitive column of her throat.

Alexander's fingers brushed against the delicate chain of her necklace, his touch lingering on the pendant resting against her collarbone.

"Birthday gift?" His eyebrow arched slightly, his voice laced with a hint of displeasure. "I'm not particularly impressed."

He had expected Evelyn to return the pendant to him as his birthday present.

Instead of kissing her, Alexander pulled back slightly, making Evelyn open her eyes in confusion.

She hadn’t known today was his birthday—hadn’t prepared anything for him.

This pendant had been given on impulse, a moment of recklessness fueled by Ethan’s taunting words in the dim lights of Eclipse Lounge.

"I’ll get you something else," she murmured.

Alexander tucked the pendant back against her skin, his cool fingertips grazing her neck, sending a shiver down her spine.

Then, without warning, he captured her lips in a searing kiss. His fingers traced the delicate curve of her collarbone, his touch igniting sparks beneath her skin.

"Evelyn," he murmured against her lips, his voice rough with desire. "Do you want me?"

Her breath hitched as she gazed up at him, dazed. "What?"

The moment the word left her lips, she regretted it.

The hunger in Alexander’s dark eyes was unmistakable.

How could she not know exactly what he meant?

Evelyn found herself pinned beneath Alexander in the backseat of the luxury car.

His lips crashed onto hers with possessive hunger.

Alexander was an expert at this—every brush of his mouth sent electric shocks through Evelyn’s body, making her pulse race and her thoughts scatter.

Dazed, she could only grip the leather seat beneath her, surrendering to his touch.

The air inside the car grew thick with desire, their breaths mingling in heated gasps. Without thinking, Evelyn wound her arms around Alexander’s neck, pulling him closer.

Just as his hands began to wander, a sharp rap on the window shattered the moment.

Reality rushed back in, and Evelyn blinked, her cheeks burning.

Alexander didn’t move. His darkened eyes held hers, raw need burning in their depths.

Flustered, she shoved at his chest. With a frustrated growl, he finally relented.

Shrugging off his tailored jacket, Alexander draped it over Evelyn’s head before cracking the window open just enough to glare at the intruder.

A bored security guard stood outside, barely glancing in. "Sir, this isn’t a parking zone."

Alexander’s voice was clipped. "Noted."

The window rolled back up, sealing them in silence once more.

The sudden knock on the window made Evelyn jump.

Her fingers fumbled with the hem of her blouse as she tried to compose herself. The rapid beating of her heart echoed in her ears like a drum.

She felt like a teenager caught in a compromising position.

"Security's gone now. It's late—I should head back inside." Evelyn reached for the door handle, her voice barely above a whisper.

Alexander's hand closed around her wrist before she could escape.

She turned to find his piercing gaze locked onto her.

The warmth of his touch sent shivers down her spine.

Her cheeks burned crimson, the flush spreading to the tips of her ears. Even the exposed skin at her collarbone had turned a delicate shade of pink.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Evelyn's breath hitched as Alexander leaned closer.

The dim glow of the parking lot lights cast shadows across his sharp features.

Her pulse raced as his thumb traced slow circles on her inner wrist.

"Not yet," he murmured, his voice rough with restrained emotion.

The scent of his cologne—spicy and intoxicating—filled the confined space.

Evelyn's lips parted slightly, anticipation coiling tight in her stomach.

The security guard's flashlight beam swept across the far end of the lot.

A reminder of how exposed they were.

How dangerous this moment had become.

Yet neither of them moved to break the spell.

Alexander's other hand came up to cup her jaw.

His touch was electric against her heated skin.

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered closed instinctively.

The world outside the car ceased to exist.

There was only this.

Only him.

Only the unbearable tension stretching between them.

When his lips finally claimed hers, Evelyn forgot how to breathe.

The kiss was everything—desperate, possessive, overwhelming.

And when they finally broke apart, gasping for air, Evelyn realized one terrifying truth.

She never wanted this moment to end.
###Chapter 120 Seduced Her

The night breeze tousled Evelyn's disheveled locks, her neck still tingling from Alexander's possessive marks.

"Come home with me." His voice was low, commanding, leaving no room for misunderstanding.

Evelyn's pulse stuttered. She knew exactly what awaited her if she stepped into that penthouse again.

Alexander reached into his coat, pulling out a cigarette. The flame flickered as he lit it, casting shadows across his sharp features. In the dim glow, he looked effortlessly alluring—dangerous in the most intoxicating way.

The scent of tobacco mingled with his signature sandalwood cologne, carried by the wind straight to her. Evelyn's breath hitched.

God, he was breathtaking.

One glance at him, and her resolve wavered.

He’s too damn tempting.

But Evelyn wasn’t reckless.

She shut her eyes briefly, forcing her racing thoughts into submission. Then, with deliberate slowness, she slid her hand free from his grasp.

Taking a measured step back, she arched a brow, her lips curving into a teasing smile.

"Tomorrow, Alexander."

Her refusal was clear, but the challenge in her gaze?

That was an invitation all on its own.

Alexander let out a low chuckle, his fingers deliberately working on the top buttons of his dress shirt. The fabric parted to reveal the sharp lines of his collarbones.

He lounged against the car door with effortless grace—one knee braced against the frame, the other leg stretched out onto the pavement. His right arm rested lazily on the steering wheel, a cigarette dangling between his fingers, while his left hand hooked at his waist, pulling the shirt just enough to expose a tantalizing strip of toned skin.

The dim streetlights cast shadows across his face as his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Evelyn bit her lower lip, her eyes flickering downward for the briefest moment.

Then, without warning, she closed the distance between them. Her hands flew up to clasp behind Alexander's neck as she crushed her mouth against his.

Alexander stiffened in surprise. His dark eyes flared with intensity as his arms instinctively wrapped around her waist, pulling her closer to deepen the kiss—

But Evelyn was already pushing away.

She stepped back, her breath uneven, and without a single glance over her shoulder, she turned and hurried toward the apartment complex.

Her silhouette disappeared into the night.

Alexander remained motionless, watching the empty space where she had been.

Only when he was certain she wouldn't return did a slow, knowing smirk curve his lips.

Alexander traced his fingers over his lips where Evelyn had kissed him moments ago. The lingering taste of her sweetness still danced on his tongue.

He smirked to himself. "Playing coy, Evelyn? How amusing."

A single strand of her hair had caught on his coat. He carefully wound it around his finger, studying it with a dark fascination.

Time flew by swiftly, and before long, the day of Ethan and Vanessa’s wedding arrived.

Evelyn woke up far earlier than she intended.

It was supposed to be her day off—she had planned to sleep in. But just as dawn broke, her phone rang.

Margaret’s voice was urgent. "Vanessa’s bridesmaid got into an accident on the way here. She can’t make it. Evelyn, you need to step in."

Still half-asleep, Evelyn jolted upright at the words.

She pushed back the covers and walked to the window, pulling open the curtains. The morning light spilled in.

"Are you sure you want me there?" she murmured, her voice laced with quiet amusement. "Or are you hoping the wedding turns into a funeral?"

The line went silent for a beat before Margaret scoffed. "Just get here. Now."

Evelyn smirked as she hung up.

This was going to be interesting.
###Chapter 121 The Humiliating Ceremony

Today was Vanessa's wedding day. Let her bask in her moment of glory. The higher she soared today, the harder she'd crash tomorrow.

Margaret wasn't surprised when Evelyn hung up on her.

Vanessa, already dressed in her lavish wedding gown, waited impatiently for the bridal car to arrive.

"Well? What did Evelyn say?" Vanessa demanded, tapping her manicured nails against the vanity. "Is she too cowardly to show her face?"

Vanessa tilted her chin up arrogantly. The makeup artist had spent hours perfecting her look—each lash meticulously applied, every contour flawlessly blended.

"Hmm." Margaret hadn't expected Evelyn to agree anyway.

At dawn, Vanessa had dramatically announced that her bridesmaid got into an accident. "Find me a replacement!" she'd insisted. Reluctantly, Margaret had called Evelyn.

Only now did the realization strike Margaret.

Evelyn had pursued Ethan Caldwell for seven painful years. And here was Vanessa, demanding she stand beside them as a bridesmaid?

This wasn't a request—it was a calculated humiliation.

The cruelty of it made Margaret's stomach twist. But she said nothing. Vanessa always got what she wanted.

Outside, car doors slammed. The procession had arrived.

Vanessa's lips curled into a vicious smile as she adjusted her diamond tiara. "Perfect timing."

Margaret forced a smile, but her hands trembled. Today would be unforgettable—for all the wrong reasons.

Vanessa had always been sweet and considerate. So why was she making such outrageous demands now?

Margaret studied her stepdaughter's face, a knot forming in her stomach. Something about Vanessa felt... off.

Outside, the rain hammered against the windows in relentless sheets. The storm showed no signs of letting up.

Vanessa's original bridesmaid had been in a fender bender, forcing them to draft one of the Hawthorne Estate maids as a last-minute replacement.

By the time Ethan Caldwell arrived at the estate, he was running an hour and a half behind schedule.

Cresthaven was a bustling international city where rain inevitably meant gridlock. Add to that the torrential downpour and the lengthy wedding procession, and it was no surprise the cars got separated in the chaos.

The lead vehicle carrying Ethan made it to the estate, but the trailing cars with guests and family were still stuck somewhere in the flooded streets.

With the reception timeline collapsing, Ethan rushed through the pickup. There was no fanfare, no traditional ceremonies—just a frazzled groom bundling his bride into the car.

But the real disaster awaited them at the venue.

The wedding hotel scene was beyond awkward.

Ethan Caldwell had reserved the entire Grand Emerald Hotel, yet the vast ballroom stood nearly deserted.

The torrential downpour outside was partly to blame - few dared brave the storm. But everyone knew the real reason: the Caldwell family's obvious disapproval of this union.

Though Ethan had made a name for himself in Cresthaven's elite circles, without the Caldwell dynasty's backing, he was just another businessman.

Most guests had chosen wisely - better to slight Ethan than risk the Caldwells' displeasure. Only a handful of Vanessa Hart's relatives occupied the gilded chairs.

Vanessa's triumphant march down the aisle quickly faltered when she saw the cavernous emptiness. Her meticulously planned wedding - every floral arrangement, every crystal centerpiece approved after countless consultations - now mocked her.

The storm had seemed romantic this morning. Now it felt like divine judgment.

Her father Richard Hayes had deliberately kept the guest list short, unwilling to parade this awkward alliance before society. Thirty people sat scattered across a venue meant for three hundred.

Vanessa's manicured nails dug into her bouquet. This wasn't the fairytale she'd envisioned when scheming to become Mrs. Caldwell. The empty chairs whispered what everyone knew - she might have won the ring, but she'd never truly belong.

Across the room, Grace Caldwell sipped champagne with icy detachment, her smirk saying what propriety forbade. Vanessa's victory tasted as hollow as the echoing hall.

The organist began playing, the music swelling to fill the painful silence. Vanessa forced her lips into the perfect bride's smile and took her first step toward a marriage already drowning in quiet humiliation.

The weather had been perfect all morning. Vanessa had specifically chosen an indoor venue to avoid any complications from unexpected rain.

Yet nothing could have prepared her for this crushing blow.

Not a single member of the Caldwell family showed up. The empty seats reserved for them screamed louder than any insult.

Vanessa knew exactly who was behind this humiliation.

Eleanor Whitmore despised her. That simple fact gave the entire Caldwell clan permission to snub her on what should have been the most important day of her life.

Her palms burned where her nails dug deep crescent marks. The sharp pain barely registered through the white-hot shame coursing through her veins.

###Chapter 122 A Discordant Note
The wedding ceremony commenced with all its grandeur.

After the traditional vows were exchanged, it was Vanessa's moment to shine with her cello performance.

A single spotlight illuminated her as she took her seat gracefully.

Vanessa positioned the cello between her knees, her fingers poised above the strings.

Ever since she had boldly promised Ethan she would perform at the wedding, she had practiced relentlessly, determined to prove herself.

Though she had formal training in music, and Evelyn had once played this very piece years ago, Vanessa had memorized the composition effortlessly.

Ethan stood at the altar, his gaze fixed on Vanessa, who was framed by cascading white roses.

Perhaps nerves got the better of her—the first note she struck was jarringly off-key.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

To her credit, Vanessa recovered swiftly, her fingers gliding over the strings with practiced ease. Yet, as the melody continued, Ethan's frown only deepened.

By the time she reached the crescendo, his attention had already drifted elsewhere.

Some guests might have been impressed by Vanessa's technical proficiency.

But something about the performance felt... wrong.

The notes flowed perfectly from Vanessa's cello, technically flawless. Yet Ethan Caldwell stood frozen by the window, his champagne flute forgotten.

Something vital was missing.

Technique meant nothing without soul. This was the same composition from years ago, yet the emotions it evoked now were hollow. The haunting melody that had once seeped into his bones during his coma was gone.

Could this truly be the same woman who played in the music room last winter? The dissonance between then and now was staggering. His fingers tightened around the glass.

Memories of the accident resurfaced - eighteen years old, trapped in darkness, with only the cello's lament pulling him back to consciousness. That raw, grieving sound bore no resemblance to Vanessa's polished performance today.

The final note faded. Polite applause rippled through the wedding guests. Vanessa rose with a practiced smile, oblivious to Ethan's scrutiny.

As she exited for the dressing room, Ethan found himself in the marble corridor. The engraved lighter flipped open in his palm with a metallic click. The flame trembled as he inhaled.

That melody from his coma... Had he imagined it? Or had there been another cellist all those years ago?

The lighter snapped shut. Somewhere in Kingsdom, a truth waited to be uncovered.

Something was off.

Ethan Caldwell's expression was a turbulent storm of conflicting emotions.

Nathan Reeves approached cautiously. "Mr. Caldwell?"

"Pull up the surveillance footage from Titan Capital Group," Ethan ordered, his voice clipped. "I need to know if anyone played the cello there."

Nathan hesitated. "For what time period?"

"A month ago," Ethan said sharply. "Around the time Evelyn first joined Titan Capital."

Nathan's brows knitted together. "Sir, you know Titan Capital's system only retains footage for thirty days. Anything older would have been automatically purged."

Ethan's gaze darkened, his jaw tightening. The air around him turned icy.

Nathan immediately dropped his eyes, swallowing hard. Even after years of working for Ethan, he knew better than to challenge him when he was in this mood.

And today, of all days, Ethan was in a particularly foul state.

It made no sense.

This was supposed to be his wedding day.

Yet during the ceremony, Ethan had been distracted—his attention repeatedly drifting toward the entrance, as if expecting someone who never arrived.

The air between them turned icy.

"Find a way to restore it," Ethan demanded, his voice sharp. "It's just surveillance footage from a month ago. That shouldn't be impossible, right?"

Trevor approached, sensing the tension. His gaze flickered between Ethan and Nathan.

"What's going on?" he murmured, keeping his voice low.

Ethan took a slow drag from his cigarette, ignoring the question.

Nathan hesitated, then caught Trevor's subtle nod. Without another word, he slipped away.

Two nights ago, at the bachelor party, Evelyn had left early.

Ethan had drowned himself in alcohol afterward.

Trevor had been the one to take him home.

That night, in the dim silence of the car, Ethan had muttered a name—just once, barely audible.

"Evelyn..."

The memory lingered like smoke.

Trevor was utterly stunned. His breath caught in his throat.

Evelyn had chased after Ethan for years. How could she possibly cross his mind when he was drunk?

Trevor had known Ethan for over a decade, yet he had never seen him like this—raw, vulnerable, his usual composure shattered.

Moments ago, Trevor had accidentally overheard Ethan’s conversation with Nathan. The mention of surveillance footage had piqued his interest, especially since he suspected it involved Evelyn.

He hesitated, debating whether to speak up.

After a long silence, he chose his words carefully. "Ethan… do you still have feelings for Evelyn?"

It was the only explanation.

Evelyn had been impossible to ignore lately.

Using Alexander to provoke Ethan—it had clearly worked. If Trevor were in Ethan’s shoes, he wouldn’t have been able to brush her off either.

The way Ethan’s jaw clenched at the mention of her name said everything.

Trevor exhaled slowly. This wedding was going to be far more complicated than anyone had anticipated.

He had to give Evelyn credit—she was downright diabolical.

Ethan crushed the cigarette beneath his heel, the embers dying instantly.

Without a word, he turned on his heel and stormed out of the hotel, his expression thunderous.

Trevor scrambled after him. "Ethan! What the hell are you doing? You can't just bail like this! The reception isn't over, and half the guests are still here!"

True, the guest list had been small, but that didn’t make this any less of a scandal.

He was the groom, for God’s sake.

When Vanessa emerged from changing into her second gown, she was met with whispers and sideways glances. The moment she realized Ethan was gone, her smile turned brittle, forced.

She had no choice but to play the gracious bride alone, circulating through the crowd with practiced charm.

Her calls went straight to voicemail.

As murmurs grew louder, she lied through her teeth—He’s exhausted from the preparations. Resting in the lounge.

But when the last guest finally left, there was still no sign of him.

Now, the wedding suite stood empty.

Vanessa sat on the edge of the bed, still in her lace gown, staring at the storm clouds gathering outside the window.

Their wedding night.

And she was completely alone.

The sky split open with jagged streaks of lightning, casting eerie shadows across what should have been the most romantic venue. The once-elegant wedding hall now resembled something out of a gothic horror story.

Evelyn had personally overseen every detail of the design. As a professional, her vision had been flawless—until now.

Vanessa's fingers trembled as she dialed Ethan's number for what felt like the hundredth time. When he still didn’t answer, she finally gave up and called Trevor instead.

Trevor and Ethan had been inseparable since college. If anyone knew where he was, it would be him.

"Have you seen Ethan?" Vanessa demanded, her voice tight with barely restrained panic. "He never came back."

Trevor froze. Wait—Ethan never returned?

He remembered watching Ethan storm out of the reception at noon. He’d tried to follow, but the rain had been torrential, and Ethan’s car had vanished into the storm.

But Trevor wasn’t about to tell Vanessa that.

"We’re just celebrating," he lied smoothly. "It’s his wedding day—let the man enjoy himself. What’s the rush?"

Vanessa exhaled in relief. If Ethan was with Trevor, at least he was safe.

She forced a light laugh, careful to maintain her poised image in front of Ethan’s friends. "Fine, but don’t let him drink too much. I’ll be waiting."

The line went dead.

Trevor stared at his phone, unease coiling in his gut.

Because the truth was—he had no idea where Ethan had gone.

The call ended abruptly, leaving Trevor Moss with a deep furrow between his brows.

Rain lashed against the windows in relentless sheets, the storm raging with unnatural fury.

"Where the hell did Ethan go in this weather?" Trevor muttered, fingers tightening around his phone.

Darkness had swallowed the city whole, broken only by occasional flashes of lightning.

A cold dread crept up Trevor's spine.

"Something's wrong," he whispered to the empty room.

The wedding venue stood deserted now, its grand halls echoing with ghostly silence.

Trevor's mind raced through worst-case scenarios.

Ethan Caldwell wasn't the type to vanish without warning. Not tonight. Not like this.

Thunder growled overhead as Trevor grabbed his coat.

He had to find him. Now.

The storm outside mirrored the tempest in his chest.

Where are you, Ethan?

###Chapter 124 Strange Behavior

The rain poured down in sheets, drumming against the pavement like an unrelenting storm.

Ethan Caldwell stood outside the entrance of the alley, his car parked haphazardly near the curb. He didn’t bother with an umbrella—his mind was too preoccupied with one thought.

Evelyn Carter.

An hour ago, he had tried calling her. The call didn’t go through.

Then he sent a message, only to realize—she had blocked him.

Blocked.

The word echoed in his mind like a taunt. Evelyn, the woman who had once chased after him relentlessly, who had always been at his beck and call—she had blocked him?

It didn’t make sense.

His jaw clenched as he strode forward, ignoring the security guard who stepped in his path.

"Sir, this is a women-only residence. You can’t enter."

Ethan barely spared him a glance. He knew Evelyn lived here. And he wasn’t leaving until he got answers.

"Evelyn!" His voice cut through the rain, sharp and demanding. "Enough with the games! If this is your way of getting my attention, it’s working. Now come out!"

The security guard’s grip tightened on his arm. "Sir, if you don’t lower your voice, I will escort you out."

Ethan barely registered the warning. His mind was still stuck on one thing—

Why had she cut him off?

And more importantly—

Why did it bother him so much?

Ethan appeared completely oblivious to the security guard's words. "Evelyn! I know you're in there!" His voice cracked with desperation.

The guards exchanged glances before firmly escorting him toward the exit.

"Get your hands off me!" Ethan thrashed against their grip. "I'm Ethan Caldwell of Horizon Enterprises! I could purchase this entire building by morning and have every one of you unemployed!"

The security team regarded him with undisguised amusement, their professional demeanor slipping.

"Check this guy out," one muttered to his partner. "Dressed in designer clothes but clearly off his rocker."

"Probably some rich kid having a meltdown," the other replied, shaking his head. "Should we call the cops?"

"Claims to be Ethan Caldwell. Ever heard of him?"

While Ethan's name carried weight among Cresthaven's elite, it meant nothing to the working-class guards.

They unceremoniously shoved him into the torrential downpour outside Willowbrook Apartments. Icy rain immediately plastered his hair to his forehead, his expensive suit transforming into a second skin.

Trevor's call came through moments later. After getting Ethan's slurred location, he sped through the storm-slicked streets without hesitation.

The windshield wipers fought a losing battle against the deluge as Trevor spotted his friend - a soaked, shivering mess standing beneath the apartment complex's awning, still screaming Evelyn's name into the night.

The rain poured relentlessly, drenching Ethan Caldwell completely. His clothes clung to his skin, his hair plastered to his forehead.

"Ethan, what the hell are you doing?" Trevor Moss gasped, rushing forward with an umbrella. He held it over Ethan's head, though it was pointless now.

Ethan barely noticed. His gaze remained fixed on the apartment building ahead. "Evelyn lives here," he murmured, his voice rough.

Night had fallen, and the scattered glow of apartment lights made the building look warm, inviting—everything he wasn’t.

Trevor stiffened. "You… what?" He couldn’t believe his ears. Ethan had come here, in this storm, for Evelyn?

It was absurd.

"Ethan," Trevor said carefully, "today is your wedding day. With Vanessa. Why are you looking for Evelyn?"

Ethan exhaled sharply. "She blocked me."

Trevor stared at him, incredulous.

That was his reason?

Pathetic.

Trevor clenched his jaw. This wasn’t just an excuse—it was desperation. And it made no sense.

Not after everything.

Not after the choices Ethan had made.

Ethan couldn't wrap his head around the fact that Evelyn hadn’t shown up at the wedding to cause a scene. It gnawed at him so much that he sought out Trevor.

"Could Evelyn be ill?" Ethan studied Trevor’s expression as he spoke. "Maybe she’s bedridden—too weak to even confront me. That’s why she didn’t come, right?"

Trevor was at a loss for words.

Ethan actually expected Evelyn to storm in and reclaim him?

The absurdity of the thought sent a chill down Trevor’s spine. "Ethan, what the hell are you talking about?"

He gripped Ethan’s shoulder firmly. "You married Vanessa today. Why are you still hoping Evelyn would crash your wedding and make a spectacle? Wasn’t Vanessa the one you always wanted?"

Trevor shook his head in disbelief. "You got what you wished for. Shouldn’t you be celebrating instead of obsessing over Evelyn?"

Ethan’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t respond.

Because deep down, he wasn’t sure what he truly wanted anymore.

###Chapter 125 The Wayward Heir

Ethan Caldwell stood frozen, words failing him.

He should have been overjoyed, yet the expected elation never came.

At first, Vanessa Hart had intrigued him—her charm undeniable—but their relationship felt less like fate and more like a carefully staged play.

That night, drunk beyond reason, she had ushered him into a hotel room. By dawn, paparazzi swarmed them, their "scandalous affair" splashed across every tabloid.

Vanessa had orchestrated it all. The realization struck him like ice water—she wasn’t the innocent he’d believed her to be.

No man wanted his future dictated by manipulation, and Ethan was no exception.

What unsettled him more was Evelyn Carter’s recent behavior. First, she joined Titan Capital Group, appearing everywhere he turned. Then, she openly pursued Alexander Whitmore.

Evelyn had masterfully stoked his competitive instincts, pulling his strings with effortless precision.

It was undeniable—she knew him too well. And now, he was dancing to her tune without even realizing it.

These were Ethan's most private thoughts, ones he could never voice aloud.

The memory surfaced unexpectedly—Evelyn used to play the cello too.

That haunting melody he'd heard while unconscious had first drawn him to Vanessa.

But now, doubt gnawed at him. What if it wasn't Vanessa playing that day?

The possibility twisted his gut. Had everything been built on a lie?

He needed answers. Needed to hear the truth from Evelyn herself.

Trevor, oblivious to Ethan's turmoil, gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "You're overworked, man. Let's hit Eclipse Lounge—nothing a few drinks can't fix."

After last night's storm, dawn broke clear and golden.

Evelyn slept peacefully, exhaustion finally claiming her.

With Claire's shoot canceled due to the weather, she'd crashed at Willowbrook Apartments, keeping Evelyn company through the tempest.

They'd spent the day marathoning dramas, wrapped in blankets with takeout containers littering the coffee table.

The storm had passed. But for Ethan, the turbulence was just beginning.

The afternoon sun streamed through the café windows as Evelyn stirred her iced tea absently. Across from her, Claire toyed with the rim of her glass, her expression unreadable.

"Have you and Lucas sorted things out yet?" Evelyn asked carefully.

Claire’s lips twisted into a bitter smile. She remembered that night at Eclipse Lounge all too well—how she’d flirted shamelessly with a model, how Lucas had stormed in, his jaw clenched, before hauling her out like a misbehaving child.

"Make up?" Claire scoffed. "Absolutely not. I want a divorce. There’s no making up after this."

Evelyn leaned forward. "What happened after he took you home?"

Claire rolled her eyes. "He tried to talk. Said he wanted to fix things. Then he had the audacity to suggest we sleep together." Her fingers tightened around her glass. "I told him I was pregnant. That I was getting rid of it and then signing the papers."

Evelyn’s brows lifted. "And?"

"He refused." Claire’s laugh was sharp. "Suddenly, he’s all about keeping the baby, promising to be better, swearing Isabella Rhodes means nothing. Like I’d believe that."

Evelyn studied her. "Do you think he’s telling the truth?"

"Men lie," Claire said flatly. "Especially when they’re cornered."

As if on cue, Claire’s phone buzzed—Lucas’s name flashing on the screen. She didn’t hesitate before swiping to decline.

Evelyn smirked. "He’s persistent."

"Pathetic," Claire corrected. "It used to be me chasing him. Now he’s the one panicking." She tossed her phone into her bag with a satisfied smirk. "Let him sweat. I’m not answering for a week."

Evelyn sipped her tea, hiding a smile. "You’re ruthless."

Claire’s grin was all teeth. "And he deserves every second of it."

Claire switched off her phone with trembling fingers. Outside, thunder rumbled ominously.

Lucas, desperate, dialed Evelyn's number.

"It's pouring out there. Is Claire with you?" His voice was tight with worry.

Evelyn smirked and put him on speaker. "She is."

Lucas exhaled sharply. "She's early in her pregnancy and still dealing with morning sickness. Make sure she's comfortable."

Evelyn couldn't resist teasing. "Lucas Bennett, has the wayward son finally come home?"

"I was never wayward," Lucas snapped, irritation lacing his words.

Some things Claire couldn't bring herself to ask, but Evelyn had no such reservations.

"Weren't you hung up on some mystery woman? Now that Claire's carrying your child, does that girl even matter anymore?"

Silence.

Claire's grip on her coffee cup tightened, her knuckles turning white. The ceramic felt like it might shatter under the pressure.

The quiet stretched, heavy and suffocating.

Then—

Nothing.

Lucas had hung up.

Claire's breath hitched.

Evelyn's playful expression faltered. "Well. That was... telling."

Claire set the cup down before she dropped it. The liquid inside had gone cold.

Outside, the storm raged on.
###Chapter 126 Center Stage

Evelyn sensed Claire's unease and tilted her head. "So this sudden concern for Claire... is it because she's carrying your child?"

Her questions grew sharper with each word, like a knife peeling back layers of deception. She needed to force the truth out—for Claire's sake.

Pregnancy changed everything. If Lucas could truly reform, that would be ideal.

But if he only saw Claire as a vessel for his heir? Then she'd walk away now, before the damage became irreversible.

Women always bore the heavier burden when it came to childbirth. Evelyn wouldn't let her best friend become collateral damage.

"Claire isn't just some incubator to me," Lucas finally said after a weighted pause.

Evelyn glanced at Claire, who exhaled shakily, shoulders relaxing.

The call ended. A quiet smile bloomed on Claire's face, bright enough to rival the morning sun.

That lightness carried her through the night and into dawn.

Claire had always been gifted with cosmetics. Today, her fingers worked deftly through Evelyn's hair, weaving an elegant updo.

They were preparing for Evelyn's visit to Whitmore Manor—a meeting with the family that would decide everything.

The sun cast golden rays through the windows as Claire meticulously styled Evelyn’s cascading hair into soft, elegant waves.

"Every angle has to be perfect," Claire murmured, stepping back to admire her work.

Evelyn studied her reflection—her cheeks slightly fuller now, her beauty radiant.

"I wish I could go with you," Claire sighed, mischief dancing in her eyes. "Just imagining Vanessa’s expression when she sees you—priceless."

Evelyn smirked. "You’re terrible."

"Have one of the maids record it secretly," Claire suggested, grinning. "I’ll share it in the group chat. Everyone deserves to witness this moment."

Evelyn laughed before pulling out her phone to call Alexander.

He answered after the second ring, his voice tense. "I’m dealing with something urgent. I might be late. Can you take a cab to Whitmore Manor first?"

"Of course," Evelyn replied, about to hang up when he suddenly asked, "Did you pack your bags?"

She paused. "What?"

"Mrs. Whitmore," Alexander said, his tone shifting into something deliberate, "if we’re making our relationship public now, we should do it properly."

The words sent a thrill through her.

She hadn’t expected this.

But she was ready.

"Are you finally considering moving out of that tiny studio apartment of yours?" Alexander's voice carried through the speakerphone, laced with amusement.

Evelyn glanced around her cozy space, defensive. "My place is perfectly fine. Not tiny at all!"

Since Evelyn had the call on speaker, Claire caught every word. She collapsed onto the bed in peals of laughter, clutching her stomach.

After ending the call, Claire wiped tears from her eyes. "Alexander just discovered paradise, and you've been making him wait for days. You're being cruel on purpose, aren't you?"

"Am I?"

A flush crept up Evelyn's neck as she remembered how close they'd come to losing control in his car that night.

Her pulse quickened at the memory.

"Oh stop blushing," Claire teased, springing up. "Let's get you packed. You're moving into Whitmore Manor tonight. Someone needs to keep our poor Alexander properly fed, hmm?"

Evelyn covered her burning cheeks with her hands.

Whitmore Manor stood in Cresthaven's most exclusive gated community, where hundred-million-dollar estates sprawled across manicured hills.

The deeper into the compound one went, the more serene the atmosphere became - a silent testament to the residents' status.

The winding driveway alone felt like a journey into another world, with ancient oaks forming a cathedral-like canopy overhead. Security gates discreetly tucked between hedgerows marked each property boundary.

Claire whistled as they pulled up to the main house. "Damn, Evelyn. You hit the jackpot with this one."

The contemporary mansion rose before them, all glass and steel, yet softened by cascading gardens. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered glimpses of curated modern art pieces inside.

Evelyn's fingers trembled on her luggage handle. This wasn't just moving in with Alexander. This was stepping into his world - a world of power, privilege, and expectations.

A shadow moved behind the glass doors. Then they swung open, revealing Alexander leaning against the frame, his hungry gaze locking onto Evelyn.

"Took you long enough," he murmured, the heat in his voice making her knees weak.

Claire gave Evelyn a not-so-subtle push forward. "Go feed your man, sweetheart. Before he starves to death."

The door clicked shut behind Evelyn with finality. There would be no escaping tonight.

The gated community had layers of security, with armed guards checking every vehicle that passed through its wrought-iron gates. Only those with exclusive access permits could enter.

Among the parade of sleek Bentleys and polished Rolls-Royces, Evelyn’s yellow taxi stuck out like a sore thumb.

Yet, to everyone’s shock, the cab breezed through without so much as a second glance from security.

Whispers erupted among the onlookers.

How?

Who was she?

The sight of that ordinary taxi gliding past the elite sent ripples of disbelief through the crowd.

###Chapter 127 Ethan's Illusion

The taxi driver couldn't help stealing glances at Evelyn through the rearview mirror.

Her luminous eyes were fixed on the passing scenery outside the window. She carried herself like a Hollywood starlet, her flawless skin glowing like polished porcelain.

Her cascading hair shimmered like liquid silk, dancing lightly in the breeze. Every movement exuded elegance—she was undeniably a woman of refined grace.

The driver had only ever heard rumors about this exclusive gated community but had never set foot inside. This was Cresthaven’s most elite enclave, home to the city’s wealthiest and most powerful.

Security was notoriously tight. Ordinary people like him rarely got this close, let alone drove through its pristine streets.

This will make one hell of a story for the guys back at the depot, he thought smugly.

The deeper they ventured, the more breathtaking the surroundings became.

Lush, manicured gardens stretched endlessly, every hedge and tree sculpted to perfection. Even the leaves seemed hand-polished, glistening under the golden sunlight filtering through the canopy.

Yesterday’s rain had left the air crisp and fresh, the emerald foliage shimmering under the soft glow of dawn. The entire estate felt like a living painting—serene, untouchable, and impossibly luxurious.

Evelyn remained silent, her fingers absently tracing the edge of the car window.

The driver cleared his throat. "First time visiting, miss?"

She didn’t answer.

He swallowed, suddenly feeling out of place. The weight of the unspoken divide between them settled heavily in the car.

Up ahead, the iron gates of Whitmore Manor loomed into view.

The air carried a refined elegance through the manicured grounds of Whitmore Manor.

Evelyn's taxi pulled up to the gated entrance.

Security guards immediately recognized her and swung open the wrought iron gates.

As she paid the driver and stepped onto the cobblestone driveway, tires screeched behind her.

Ethan Caldwell emerged from the black sedan, his usually impeccable appearance disheveled.

He and Vanessa Hart were newlyweds who should have arrived together. But a last-minute crisis at Titan Capital Group had delayed him.

Vanessa, painfully aware of the Whitmore family's disdain for her, had insisted on arriving a full hour early.

When Ethan's bloodshot eyes landed on Evelyn, his breath caught.

Last night's whiskey and unexpected downpour had left him feverish. He'd stumbled home past midnight, barely sleeping before rushing to the office at dawn.

Now, seeing Evelyn's familiar silhouette against the afternoon sun, he wondered if his fever had spiked into hallucinations.

"What are you doing here?" His voice came out rougher than intended, cracking with exhaustion.

The breeze carried the faint scent of Evelyn's perfume—something floral and achingly familiar. It made his chest constrict.

Vanessa's shrill voice cut through the moment from the terrace above. "Ethan! You're finally here!"

Ethan didn't turn. His gaze remained locked on Evelyn, searching her face for... something. An explanation? A reaction?

Evelyn merely adjusted her clutch bag, her expression unreadable. "I was invited," she said simply before walking toward the house.

Her heels clicked against the stone path with finality. Each step took her further away—just like she'd walked away from their failed engagement.

Ethan's fingers twitched at his sides. For one irrational second, he considered chasing after her.

Then Vanessa's manicured hand gripped his arm, her nails digging in possessively. "Everyone's waiting inside," she hissed.

The spell broke. Ethan blinked, suddenly aware of how many Whitmore staff members had witnessed the exchange.

He allowed Vanessa to drag him toward the grand entrance, but his head turned for one last look at Evelyn's retreating figure.

Somewhere in his whiskey-addled, feverish mind, a dangerous thought took root: What if things had been different?

The heavy oak doors closed behind them with a thud that sounded suspiciously like a ###Chapter ending.

Ethan Caldwell's voice sounded thick and nasal. Evelyn Carter suspected he might be coming down with something.

He moved closer, narrowing his eyes as if confirming her identity.

A flurry of thoughts raced through Ethan's mind.

"Evelyn must be full of regret."

"She didn’t show up at the wedding to sabotage it, and now she regrets it. That’s why she followed me to Whitmore Manor—she wants me back."

His fingers closed around Evelyn’s wrist, his grip tight as he glanced around nervously. He dragged her into a secluded alcove, away from prying eyes.

"Even if you wanted to reconcile, did you really think coming here was a good idea?" His voice was low, laced with condescension. "Do you have any idea what kind of event this is? You’re just setting yourself up for humiliation."

The sight of Evelyn seemed to lift the dark cloud that had hung over him all night. His headache even dulled slightly.

"Despite how irrational she’s been lately, deep down, she still cares."

"All that defiance was just an act—a desperate attempt to get my attention, to make me look at her."

His lips curled into a smug smile.

Evelyn remained silent, her expression unreadable.

Ethan leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "If you wanted me back, you could have just said so. Was all this drama really necessary?"

She met his gaze, her eyes cool. "You’re mistaken."

His smirk faltered.

Before he could respond, a familiar voice cut through the tension.

"Evelyn?"

Alexander Whitmore stood a few feet away, his piercing gaze locked onto Ethan’s hand, still gripping Evelyn’s wrist.

Ethan stiffened.

Alexander’s presence was like a sudden storm—dark, commanding, impossible to ignore.

Evelyn pulled free, stepping toward Alexander.

Ethan’s chest tightened.

"No. She’s not leaving with him."

He reached for her again, but Alexander was faster. His arm slid around Evelyn’s waist, pulling her close.

"Problem?" Alexander’s voice was deceptively calm.

Ethan’s jaw clenched.

The air between them crackled with unspoken threats.

Evelyn exhaled softly.

This wasn’t the reunion Ethan had imagined.

Not at all.

She truly craved my affection.

Ethan Caldwell found himself undeniably drawn to Evelyn Carter. Over time, he realized his feelings for Vanessa Hart weren't as deep as he'd believed—his thoughts kept circling back to Evelyn, her every move commanding his attention.

A gentle breeze swept through, lifting the hem of Evelyn's dress. The sunlight caught the delicate embroidery of her pale yellow gown, making her glow like a vision.

Ethan's breath hitched.

She stood there, serene and poised, her calm demeanor turning everything around her into mere background noise. His gaze lingered, unable to pull away.

A memory flickered—the first time he'd seen her.

###Chapter 128 My Good Nephew

The winter air was biting cold, the kind that seeped into your bones. Snowflakes drifted lazily from the sky, blanketing the world in white.

Ethan Caldwell had intended to slip away for a quick smoke, craving the burn of nicotine in his lungs. But as he rounded the corner of the school building, a sound stopped him in his tracks—soft, muffled sobs coming from the locked stall of the girls' restroom.

Teenagers were cruel. He knew that better than most. Bullying was practically a rite of passage in high school.

Yet, as he exhaled the last drag of his cigarette, the quiet weeping grew louder, tugging at something deep inside him. Normally, he wouldn’t have cared. But today, his feet moved on their own, as if pulled by an invisible force.

With one sharp kick, the stall door flew open.

There, huddled in the corner, was Evelyn Carter. Small. Shivering. Her thin sweater did nothing against the winter chill.

Even now, years later, Ethan could still picture her face perfectly—those wide, tear-filled eyes, so clear they seemed to hold the entire universe.

His heart stuttered.

That one look. That single moment of connection.

It was as if something dormant inside him had suddenly awakened.

The sight of Evelyn Carter struck Ethan Caldwell like a bolt of lightning to his soul. Her presence was magnetic, impossible to ignore.

His pulse raced wildly. He could feel heat creeping up his neck, grateful for the dim bathroom lighting and the way he stood silhouetted against it. Surely, she hadn’t noticed.

To mask his unease, he forced an air of indifference, turning away before tossing his charcoal-gray scarf toward her.

Evelyn stood there in nothing but a soft butter-yellow sweater, her lips tinged blue from the cold. He knew she must be freezing.

That scarf had been the first thread binding them together—a silent promise.

Ethan had assumed she cherished it. Yet, just a month ago, she had tossed it aside without hesitation.

After nearly a decade of keeping it, she had discarded it like it meant nothing.

The memory cut off abruptly. Staring at Evelyn now, he felt as though he were looking at a stranger.

She still wore pale yellow, but everything else about her had changed—especially the way her gaze held his, cool and detached.

"I wasn’t looking for you," Evelyn said flatly, taking two deliberate steps back to widen the distance between them.

His jaw tightened. "Really? Then who? Vanessa?"

Ethan's brows furrowed as he tilted his head, studying her with suspicion. "You can't seriously be here to see Alexander, can you?"

His expression darkened, lips curling into a mocking smirk. "Still haven't given up? Still trying to use him to get under my skin?"

Evelyn didn't bother answering. She brushed past him, her heels clicking against the marble pathway as she strode toward the grand entrance of Hawthorne Estate.

Ethan's hand shot out, gripping her wrist. "Evelyn, enough games. What the hell are you playing at?"

She met his gaze with icy defiance, unwilling to waste another second.

With deliberate slowness, she lifted her hand, the sunlight catching the dazzling diamond on her finger. "I'm Alexander's wife now. So from this moment on, you’ll address me as 'aunt.' Understood, nephew?"

Ethan froze, his grip slackening as if struck by lightning.

He had noticed the ring days ago, but dismissed it as just another piece of jewelry. Young women wear rings all the time—it doesn’t mean anything.

The sheer absurdity of her claim made him scoff. He quickened his steps to catch up, his voice dripping with derision. "Did you pick that up from some street vendor? Honestly, Evelyn, this is pathetic even for you."

Evelyn's fingers curled around the velvet box in her pocket, the weight of it burning against her thigh. She didn't flinch when Ethan's voice cracked through the air like a whip.

"An engagement ring? Really, Evelyn?" His laugh was sharp, mocking. "What kind of pathetic lie is that? Do you even hear yourself?"

She kept walking, her spine straight, her gaze fixed ahead. The grand doors of Whitmore Manor swung open before her, the polished wood gleaming under the chandelier's glow.

Ethan grabbed her wrist. "Stop this nonsense!"

The air in the foyer hummed with tension. Every branch of the Whitmore family had gathered tonight—faces Evelyn recognized from society pages and whispered warnings.

Alexander might have been absent, buried in work as usual, but the rest of them were there. Watching.

Ethan's grip tightened. "You're making a scene."

She yanked her arm free just as the murmur of voices in the drawing room cut off.

All eyes turned toward them.

Silence.

Then—

"Evelyn?" Grace Caldwell's voice, sweet as poisoned honey, rang out first. "What a... surprise."

Evelyn smiled. It wasn't the brittle, practiced one she'd worn for years. This one was different.

Dangerous.

She reached into her pocket.

The velvet box snapped open with a click that echoed through the room.

A collective inhale.

The diamond caught the light, scattering prisms across the shocked faces of the Whitmore dynasty.

Ethan paled.

"Surprise," Evelyn said softly.

And the chaos began.

###Chapter 129 I'm His Wife

Outside the door, Ethan Caldwell gripped Evelyn Carter's sleeve, his expression tense and helpless under the weight of the onlookers' stares.

Lowering his voice to a whisper meant only for her ears, he pleaded, "Let's discuss this later. Can I have Nathan take you home first?"

His tone was uncharacteristically conciliatory—a stark contrast to his usual arrogance. Ethan wasn't the type to negotiate, yet here he was, swallowing his pride, hoping she would relent.

But Evelyn didn’t budge.

She tilted her head slightly, feigning confusion. "You're sending me back? But I'm Alexander's wife. Shouldn't I leave with him?"

The words struck like lightning.

Ethan froze.

So did everyone else.

Evelyn’s relentless pursuit of Alexander Whitmore had already made waves—first with that scandalous public kiss, then her bold confession in front of half of Cresthaven’s elite.

The Whitmore family couldn’t ignore it.

And Sophia Ellis, ever the gossip, had wasted no time spreading the news. Over afternoon tea with the city’s wealthiest socialites, she’d painted every detail in vivid color.

Now, the entire room was watching.

Evelyn stood her ground, her gaze steady.

She wasn’t backing down.

Not this time.

The news spread like wildfire.

Within five minutes of Evelyn stepping through the door, even the family dog seemed to know.

When Evelyn boldly declared herself as Alexander Whitmore's wife, the room erupted in disbelief.

She must have lost her mind, they whispered among themselves.

The humiliation from yesterday's failed wedding must have driven her to this desperate act.

Vanessa Hart arrived at Whitmore Manor unusually early.

Her last encounter with Eleanor at the hospital had been disastrous—publicly slapped and dismissed like a common servant. The memory still burned.

Vanessa would never have come alone under normal circumstances.

If Eleanor dared strike her in front of Ethan, what would stop her when he wasn't around?

But Ethan had urgent business today.

And failure to appear would bring consequences far worse than a bruised ego.

The Whitmores weren't a family one simply ignored.

Though married to Ethan, tradition demanded more.

According to Whitmore family customs, formal recognition required a ceremonial visit—complete with gifts and blessings from the elders.

Only then would she truly be considered one of them.

So Vanessa arrived at dawn, determined to serve the family matriarch with perfect obedience.

If she played her cards right, perhaps they'd go easier on her during the official acceptance later.

The thought made her fingers tremble as she poured tea.

One misstep, and everything could unravel.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's shocking declaration still hung in the air, unanswered.

The clock ticked louder with each passing second.

Vanessa had spent a fortune on the lavish gifts—nearly fifty million.

She presented them to the elders with a practiced smile, but their reception was icy. Eleanor, in particular, barely spared her a glance.

From the moment Vanessa stepped into Whitmore Manor, Eleanor had treated her like hired help, barking orders without so much as a greeting.

Then Evelyn arrived—a perfect target for Vanessa’s pent-up frustration.

Vanessa strode forward, her voice dripping with disdain. "Evelyn, enough with your delusions! This is Whitmore Manor. I might tolerate your insolence elsewhere, but do you really think Alexander would waste his time on you? He has no reason to chauffeur an outsider."

Evelyn blinked, her expression serene. "I'm his wife. That makes me family, not an outsider."

The contrast between them was striking.

Evelyn, radiant in her pale gold gown, commanded every gaze in the room. Vanessa’s pink dress, usually flattering, now looked garish beside her—like a cheap imitation next to royalty.

Vanessa seethed. Today was supposed to be her moment.

But Evelyn had stolen it without even trying.

The room fell silent as all eyes turned to Evelyn.

Vanessa's face twisted in disbelief. "What nonsense are you spouting, Evelyn? Have you lost your mind? Alexander would never marry you!"

Evelyn sighed, her expression calm but resolute. "Yet here we are. I am his wife."

Ethan moved forward abruptly, reaching for Evelyn's wrist. "Enough of this. I'm taking you home."

Vanessa's breath hitched.

Today was supposed to be her formal introduction to the Whitmore family elders.

But now Ethan was leaving—with her.

What did that make her?

What was she to him?

The air thickened with tension as unspoken questions burned in Vanessa's eyes.
###Chapter 130 Enough with the Drama!

Evelyn dodged Ethan's outstretched hand, her voice laced with warning. "Keep your hands to yourself, cousin. Unless you want Alexander to deal with you later."

Ethan's patience snapped. "Evelyn, cut the act!"

Vanessa seized the opportunity to clutch Ethan's arm. "It's my fault for causing this scene," she said with practiced meekness. "My parents will make sure Evelyn learns her place."

Turning to Evelyn with a venomous smile, Vanessa added, "Three years in prison didn't teach you any manners, did it?"

The word "prison" made Evelyn's expression darken. Those three stolen years of her youth, wasted behind bars.

The Caldwells exchanged glances, realization dawning. "Of course," their expressions seemed to say. "How could we forget she's an ex-con? No wonder she's so shameless."

At that moment, Ryan finally looked up from his phone.

He'd been immersed in a ranked match - playing on his professional esports account no less - but the escalating argument had become impossible to ignore. With a frustrated sigh, he abandoned the game mid-match.

"Isn't it disgraceful for all of you to gang up on one woman?"

The tension in the room thickened.

"We're supposed to be celebrating today, aren't we? Let's get on with it. I brought her here."

Ethan Caldwell shot Evelyn Carter a sharp look. "She's my friend. What’s wrong with her attending the ceremony?"

Evelyn lifted her chin. "I'm not just your friend." Her voice was firm. "I'm your aunt."

Ethan suppressed a groan. I just saved her from humiliation, and she still won’t back down? Unbelievable.

Vanessa Hart stepped forward, her expression the perfect blend of apology and distress.

"Respected elders," she began, her voice soft but carrying, "please forgive my sister. I’m Evelyn’s sister, and I beg for your understanding. I’ll take her away immediately."

Her words were honeyed, but the underlying message was clear—Evelyn is causing a scene, embarrassing us all.

Vanessa turned to Evelyn, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "I know you despise me. You came here today just to humiliate me, didn’t you?" She raised her voice slightly, ensuring everyone heard. "Please, stop this. Do you want to make my life in the Whitmore family unbearable?"

The room buzzed with whispers.

Vanessa played the victim flawlessly, painting Evelyn as the reckless troublemaker who would sabotage her sister’s happiness without a second thought.

Evelyn clenched her fists. She’s twisting everything.

But the damage was done. The crowd’s judgmental stares burned into her.

Ethan sighed. This is spiraling out of control.

And then—

A deep, commanding voice cut through the murmurs.

"Enough."

All heads turned.

Alexander Whitmore stood at the entrance, his presence silencing the room instantly.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn.

And then—

He smirked.

"Did you really think I wouldn’t show up?"

Ethan Caldwell noticed the tears glistening in Vanessa Hart's eyes, her delicate frame trembling with suppressed emotion. His stern expression softened as he drew her closer, wrapping a protective arm around her slender shoulders.

Last night should have been their perfect wedding night. Instead, Ethan had stumbled home drunk, reeking of alcohol. Yet Vanessa hadn’t uttered a single word of reproach.

Even when he’d spiked a fever in the dead of night, she had rushed out into the storm to fetch medicine herself. She could have easily sent a maid, but she’d chosen to go personally—proof of her unwavering devotion.

Ethan’s jaw tightened. Evelyn Carter’s sudden appearance today is clearly meant to humiliate Vanessa in front of the Caldwells later. She’s always been cunning like this.

Since Evelyn was technically family, his mother would undoubtedly take her frustrations out on Vanessa. The Caldwells prized their reputation above all else, and Evelyn’s scandalous behavior would make them the laughingstock of their social circle.

His mother couldn’t punish Evelyn, so Vanessa would bear the brunt of her anger instead.

"One last chance," Ethan growled, his voice dangerously low. "Leave. Now."

He was already showing more patience than Evelyn deserved.

Evelyn merely sighed, shaking her head. "I can’t. I haven’t even congratulated your bride properly yet."

Alexander had secured their marriage certificate in a vault.

Evelyn wished she could retrieve it now and shove it in their faces to end this exhausting charade. No more explanations. No more lies.

Vanessa's eyes lit up suddenly. "Wait! There's a digital version of the marriage certificate online!"

Without hesitation, she snatched her phone from her purse, fingers flying across the screen.

"Vanessa, stop this nonsense!" Ethan's voice was sharp, his expression darkening. A strange, unsettling dread coiled in his chest as he watched her pull up the records.

The fear was irrational but undeniable.

He couldn't let this go any further.

###Chapter 131 Alexander’s Dominant Aura

Ethan Caldwell knew deep down that Evelyn Carter and Alexander Whitmore could never be together. Yet, watching Evelyn casually scroll through her phone with her back turned to him, a seed of doubt took root in his mind.

The fear that Evelyn might actually present some damning evidence gnawed at him. Gritting his teeth, he barked, "Someone, remove Evelyn from this room!"

He needed her gone—immediately. Sure, forcibly ejecting her might humiliate her, but at this point, he couldn’t care less about her dignity.

But the moment the command left his lips, the expected flurry of bodyguards didn’t materialize.

Confused murmurs rippled through the room as heads turned toward the doorway.

There stood Alexander, one hand in his pocket, the other holding a cigarette he’d just lit. His gaze was fixed on the floor, his expression unreadable.

The crisp white shirt he wore was half-tucked into dark jeans, the top buttons undone, revealing a hint of collarbone. A tailored black blazer hung carelessly over one shoulder, giving him an effortlessly dangerous edge—like a predator lounging in plain sight.

When he finally lifted his eyes to meet the room’s stunned silence, the air turned glacial.

No one dared move.

Not even Ethan.

"You want to banish my wife? Did anyone seek my approval?"

Alexander's icy declaration froze the entire ballroom into stunned silence.

The guests exchanged bewildered glances. First Evelyn loses her mind, and now Alexander?

He just called her his wife. Are they actually married?

The revelation hit like a thunderbolt, leaving everyone speechless.

To them, the idea of Alexander Whitmore and Evelyn Carter being married was as absurd as Titan Capital Group collapsing overnight—utterly unfathomable.

Disbelief hung thick in the air.

Alexander took a slow drag from his cigarette, exhaling tendrils of smoke that curled lazily before his piercing gaze.

Without breaking eye contact with the crowd, he crooked a finger at Evelyn.

She moved toward him without hesitation, her steps measured.

He caught her hand, his fingers interlacing with hers in a possessive grip.

Then, with deliberate slowness, Alexander led Evelyn deeper into the grand hall.

Each step they took echoed like a resounding slap across Ethan Caldwell’s face.

"This can't be happening! How could Evelyn marry Alexander? I refuse to believe this!"

Ethan Caldwell stormed forward, his voice shaking with rage as he shouted at their retreating figures. "It's impossible! Alexander, why would you marry her? Evelyn is just using you to get back at me!"

His desperate question hung in the air, sparking murmurs among the gathered crowd. "What does Alexander even see in her?" someone whispered.

"I married her because I wanted to. Do I need your permission?" Alexander turned slightly, his lips curling into a cold smirk that didn't reach his eyes.

The sheer disdain in his gaze sent a shiver down Ethan's spine, like an approaching storm darkening the horizon.

Ethan's fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white, veins protruding along the backs of his hands.

There was no denying it—Alexander had just confirmed their marriage outright.

The realization hit Ethan like a physical blow, leaving him reeling as if trapped in a waking nightmare.

Noticing Ethan's ashen face, Grace stepped forward hesitantly. "Alexander, did Evelyn force you into this? Is she blackmailing you? She was always obsessed with—"

Alexander's sharp glare cut her off mid-sentence, the unspoken warning in his eyes making Grace swallow her words.

The tension in the room thickened, suffocating.

Evelyn remained silent beside him, her expression unreadable, but the way Alexander's arm tightened around her waist spoke volumes.

This wasn't a game.

This was a declaration.

And Ethan had just lost.

Grace barely managed to utter half her sentence when Alexander’s icy stare silenced her. Her face drained of color, lips trembling as she swallowed the rest of her words.

Alexander’s voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Watch how you speak. You don’t get to call her Evelyn."

A stunned hush fell over the room.

Everyone exchanged glances, thoughts racing.

Since when does Alexander defend Evelyn? This isn’t like him at all.

The air thickened with unspoken questions.

Grace clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

Alexander’s protectiveness was unexpected—unnerving, even.

And no one dared to challenge it.

###Chapter 132 The Unexpected Union

Only Eleanor maintained her composure, discreetly sending for Harold to join them.

The revelation that Evelyn had married Alexander left both Ethan and Eleanor visibly unsettled.

Eleanor's thoughts churned. Evelyn was meant to be my son's wife. Now she stands as my equal? How revolting!

Harold had seldom involved himself in the affairs of the younger generation.

But Alexander was his youngest son.

Marriage was no trivial matter. The fact that Alexander had kept this hidden only confirmed Eleanor's suspicion—Harold would never approve!

Moments later, Harold was wheeled into the room by an attendant.

On his way, the servant had briefed him on the situation.

Eleanor spoke first. "Harold, Alexander and Evelyn are married. Does this make any sense to you?"

Harold ignored her, his sharp gaze locking onto Alexander instead. "Is this true?"

The air thickened with tension.

Alexander met his father's stare unflinchingly. "It is."

A heavy silence followed.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around Alexander's arm, her pulse racing.

Harold's expression darkened. "You kept this from your own family?"

Alexander remained composed. "There were reasons."

Eleanor scoffed. "Reasons? Or shame?"

Evelyn stiffened, but before she could speak, Harold raised a hand, silencing the room.

His voice was low, dangerous. "Explain."

Alexander exhaled. "It wasn't meant to be permanent at first."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Harold's knuckles whitened on the armrests of his wheelchair. "You toyed with marriage?"

Alexander shook his head. "No. It became real."

Eleanor's lips curled in disgust. "Convenient."

Harold studied them both, his gaze unreadable. Then, without warning, he turned to Evelyn.

"And you? What do you have to say?"

Evelyn lifted her chin. "I stand by my choice."

A beat passed.

Then Harold did something no one expected.

He laughed.

A dry, humorless sound that sent chills down Eleanor's spine.

"Well then," he said, his voice dripping with irony. "Welcome to the family, Evelyn."

The words hung in the air like a guillotine's blade.

No one moved.

No one breathed.

Because everyone knew—this wasn't acceptance.

It was a declaration of war.

Alexander responded with a detached "Indeed."

Harold's piercing gaze shifted as he commanded, "Bring your wife to me."

Evelyn froze, her eyes widening at the family patriarch.

Her mind raced with the scandalous rumors - three marriages, a notorious mistress, four sons each born to different women. The entire Whitmore dynasty's dysfunction stemmed from this one man's reckless past.

If not for Harold's philandering ways and the fractured family it created, the Whitmores wouldn't be this divided now.

Steeling herself, Evelyn approached the imposing figure. "Hello... Harold," she murmured hesitantly.

The room collectively gasped at her audacity.

Eleanor's perfectly sculpted brows knitted together in displeasure.

Vanessa looked like she'd been slapped, while Ethan's hands balled into white-knuckled fists.

The disrespect was staggering. They all addressed him as "Grandfather," yet this newcomer dared use his given name so casually.

Vanessa's face flushed crimson with barely contained fury.

She burned with indignation, yet knew her position granted her no right to object. The power dynamics had shifted in that single moment, and everyone felt it.

The grand hall fell into stunned silence.

Eleanor Caldwell's fingers dug into her clutch purse, her manicured nails leaving crescent marks on the leather. She wanted to protest—needed to protest—but the weight of tradition stifled her voice.

Ethan Caldwell stood rigid beside her, his jaw clenched so tight it ached. Evelyn Carter? Alexander Whitmore's wife? The thought was absurd. Unacceptable.

All eyes turned to Harold Aniston, the family patriarch, waiting for his reaction.

Then—

A chuckle broke the tension.

Harold's weathered face crinkled with amusement as he leaned forward in his wheelchair. "What was that you called me, dear? Say it again."

Evelyn blinked, uncertain. She glanced at Alexander, who gave an almost imperceptible nod.

"Harold?" she repeated carefully.

The old man's smile deepened. With deliberate slowness, he retrieved a velvet box from beneath his lap blanket. The emerald-green case glittered under the chandeliers, its diamond-encrusted edges throwing prismatic sparks across the marble floor.

"Come here, child," he said, beckoning. "This belongs to you now."

A collective inhale swept through the Aniston relatives. Grace Caldwell's wineglass slipped from her fingers, shattering on the floor.

Evelyn hesitated, but Alexander's hand at the small of her back urged her forward. As she accepted the box, she caught the flicker of something dark in Vanessa Hart's eyes—something that looked dangerously like recognition.

The box clicked open.

Inside lay not jewelry, but a tarnished silver key atop aged parchment. The moment Evelyn's fingers brushed it, Harold's grip tightened around her wrist.

"Welcome to the family," he murmured, too low for others to hear. "Let's see if you survive it."

Grace's voice cut through the room like a knife. "Grandfather, is that really the Whitmore family's pearl heirloom? You're giving it to Evelyn?"

Her mind reeled. Have they all lost their senses?

Evelyn acting entitled was one thing. But Alexander following her lead? And now Grandfather Harold was casually handing over a priceless family treasure?

Every single woman in the Whitmore family is more deserving than Evelyn!

Harold's sharp gaze pinned Grace in place. "Did you just call her Evelyn?" His voice was dangerously low. "You will address her as Mrs. Whitmore."

The air in the room turned frigid.

Grace clenched her fists, her nails biting into her palms.

Across from her, Evelyn sat perfectly composed, her fingers lightly tracing the pearls now resting around her wrist. A small, knowing smile played at the corners of her lips.

Alexander's arm draped protectively over Evelyn's shoulders as he shot Grace a warning look.

The message was clear—challenge Evelyn again, and there would be consequences.

Grace swallowed hard, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.

This wasn't just about a bracelet.

It was about power.

And Evelyn had just been handed far too much of it.

###Chapter 133 A Stunning Revelation

Eleanor couldn't contain her shock any longer. "Harold, that pearl bracelet—"

Sophia and Eleanor had never seen eye to eye. But when Sophia witnessed Harold retrieving the heirloom, she suddenly found herself in rare agreement. "Harold, you can't just hand over something so precious without consideration. Even if you favor Alexander, surely you—"

"It belongs to me. Do I need your permission to decide who receives it?"

Harold's icy gaze swept across the room, radiating undeniable authority.

Eleanor refused to back down. "Even so, Evelyn has only just married into the family. How can she possibly be worthy of the Whitmore heirloom?"

"Alexander is the head of this family. Is there any question that his wife should inherit its treasures?" Harold scoffed. "If you're dissatisfied, blame your own husband's incompetence."

Eleanor's face darkened instantly.

Vincent had single-handedly cost Titan Capital Group billions within mere months of taking control.

The weight of his failure hung heavy in the air.

Evelyn stood frozen, the delicate bracelet resting in her palm like a silent declaration.

She had expected resistance, but not this level of open hostility.

Alexander's fingers brushed against hers, warm and reassuring.

"Keep it," he murmured, his voice low enough for only her to hear. "You've earned it."

The words sent a shiver down her spine.

Because she knew—this wasn't just about jewelry.

This was power.

And the game had only just begun.

Then, Harold had urgently summoned Alexander back to handle the crisis.

The first thing Alexander did upon taking charge was fire Vincent from Titan Capital Group, exposing all his wrongdoings to the entire company.

Humiliated, Vincent fled overseas without even consulting Eleanor.

He'd been gone for over six months with no sign of returning.

Every time Eleanor clashed with Sophia these past months, Sophia would sneer about her unreliable husband.

Theodore was merely Harold's illegitimate son. How dare his wife mock Eleanor?

Yet Eleanor had no rebuttal. Her husband had indeed abandoned her.

Now, hearing Harold mention Vincent, Eleanor could only lower her head in silence.

Harold turned to Evelyn, his voice firm. "Take it. This is what everyone covets. I'm giving it to you—do you really need to hesitate?"

Evelyn's gaze instinctively flickered toward Alexander. When she saw—

I gave a small nod as Evelyn accepted the velvet jewelry box.

"Thank you, Harold."

Harold exhaled deeply, his shoulders sagging with exhaustion. He waved a dismissive hand. "Enough. I'm too old for this. I need to rest. You two carry on."

"Harold!" Eleanor protested.

"Grandfather!"

But Harold didn't turn back. His posture was rigid, indifferent—as if none of this concerned him anymore.

He hadn't even questioned Alexander about why he'd married Evelyn. He had simply acknowledged her as Alexander's wife without hesitation.

If the family patriarch accepted it, Eleanor and Sophia had no choice but to swallow their objections.

Eleanor seethed. She didn’t care who Alexander married. What infuriated her was the heirloom pearl bracelet now clasped around Evelyn’s wrist.

She had called Harold down, hoping he would put Alexander in his place. Instead, he had handed the family treasure to Evelyn without a second thought.

With Harold gone, Eleanor had no reason to stay. She clutched her temple dramatically. "I have a headache. I'm going to lie down."

Today was supposed to be Vanessa’s moment to shine. But Evelyn—

The moment Evelyn walked in, the entire atmosphere shifted. All eyes turned to her, and Vanessa felt her blood boil.

Vanessa clenched her fists. "I woke up at dawn and spent hours pretending to be sweet in front of Eleanor. And now she's gone. What was the point?"

Humiliation burned through her. The memory of Horizon Enterprises' absence from yesterday's wedding banquet only stoked her rage.

Her nails dug into her palms. "Evelyn is Alexander's wife now. Does that mean I have to call her Aunt Evelyn?"

"Ethan…" Vanessa whispered, tugging lightly at his sleeve.

Ethan didn’t respond. His expression was vacant, as if his soul had been ripped away. He stood frozen, lost in a daze.

###Chapter 134 Despising Aunt Evelyn

Even when Vanessa called out to him, Ethan remained completely unresponsive.

Nathan had never seen Ethan in such a state before. With a smirk, he gave Ethan a playful smack on the back.

"Didn't you bring your wife here today to pay respects to the elders? Go on! Uncle Alexander and Aunt Evelyn are right there!"

Ethan didn’t budge.

Nathan's expression turned smug. "I was planning to slap myself earlier—thought I was pitiful enough. But seeing you like this suddenly made my day."

Nathan had once promised Evelyn that if she married Alexander, he would slap himself in front of everyone.

Now, watching Ethan so visibly miserable, the idea of humiliating himself didn’t seem so bad after all.

Provoked, Ethan swung and punched Nathan square in the eye.

Nathan hissed in pain. "You coward, only picking on someone weaker! Don’t think I’ll go easy on you at Whitmore Manor!"

With that, Nathan lunged at him, fists flying.

The confrontation escalated quickly, turning the elegant parlor into a battleground.

Ethan Caldwell wasn't holding back this time. His fists connected with Ryan Fletcher's jaw in rapid succession, the sickening crunch of bone against flesh echoing through the room.

"Ethan, have you lost your damn mind?" Ryan spat blood, struggling beneath his cousin's weight.

Grace Caldwell rushed forward. "Stop this instant!"

Vanessa Hart reached out to intervene, but Ethan shoved her aside with unexpected force.

Her body collided with the mahogany side table. A sharp pain exploded across her temple as warm blood trickled down her cheek.

Sophia Ellis gasped. "She's bleeding!"

Audrey Mills immediately pulled out her phone. "I'm calling an ambulance!"

Vanessa pressed a trembling hand to her wound. "No... I'm fine."

The thought terrified her more than the injury. Being carried out of Whitmore Manor bleeding would fuel Cresthaven's gossip mills for months.

The Whitmores hadn't even attended her wedding. If rumors spread about them assaulting her...

Her social standing would never recover.

"If I hate Evelyn, then I'll become the biggest laughingstock of them all!" Vanessa snapped, her voice trembling with barely contained fury.

Audrey Mills sighed, shaking her head. "Vanessa, darling, you really should calm down."

Vanessa forced a tight smile. "Aunt Audrey, I'm perfectly fine!"

Audrey's lips thinned. If Vanessa refused to listen, then she wouldn't waste her breath.

Across the room, Ethan Caldwell and Ryan Fletcher had finally stopped their brawl.

Ryan looked utterly disheveled, collapsing into a chair in front of Alexander Whitmore. "Uncle Alexander, look what your nephew did to me!" His voice was thick with indignation.

"You saw it yourself. I was only reminding his wife to pay her respects to you, and he attacked me like a wild animal!"

Normally, their petty squabbles happened outside the family gatherings, and Alexander could pretend not to notice.

But today was different.

Alexander arched a brow, his gaze icy. "Ethan, do you understand the consequences of starting a fight here?"

Ethan stood rigid, unmoving, as if the words weren’t directed at him at all.

Grace Caldwell rushed forward, panic lacing her voice. "Ethan, apologize to Uncle Alexander now! Do you want to face the family’s punishment?"

"What?" Ethan finally responded, his tone flat.

The tension in the room thickened, every breath held in anticipation of what would come next.

Vanessa had a shallow cut on her forehead, though it wasn’t deep. She blinked at Grace in confusion. "What do you mean by family rules?"

"Fifty lashes!"

Vanessa nearly collapsed.

Her mind raced. Ethan Caldwell is one of the most respected men in Cresthaven. If he’s publicly whipped, the humiliation will be unbearable. How will the staff at Whitmore Manor ever look at him the same way again?

Without hesitation, Vanessa stepped forward. "Alexander, Ethan was just in a terrible mood when he fought Ryan! Let me apologize on his behalf! Ryan, I’m so sorry!"

Ryan tilted his chin up, his expression cold. "My injuries don’t matter. But the way you two are carrying on, anyone would think you despise Aunt Evelyn."

The air in the room turned icy.

Grace crossed her arms, her sharp gaze flickering between them. "Funny how you’re suddenly so concerned about appearances, Vanessa. Where was this consideration when Ethan threw the first punch?"

Vanessa’s fingers curled into fists.

Alexander’s voice cut through the tension like steel. "Enough. The rules are clear. Ethan, you know the consequences."

Ethan’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t argue.

Vanessa’s heart pounded. This can’t be happening.

Then, from the doorway, a soft but firm voice spoke.

"Wait."

Everyone turned.

Evelyn stood there, her expression unreadable.

The room held its breath.

What would she say?

What would she do?

The answer would change everything.
###Chapter 135 Steaming Tensions

Vanessa stared at Evelyn.

Evelyn occupied the head seat, her gaze cool and composed.

While Vanessa and Ethan Caldwell squirmed in discomfort, Evelyn appeared regal—untouchable, as if observing a play from the royal box.

How dare she? Vanessa seethed internally. She orchestrated this entire humiliation, yet sits there like some untouchable queen. Just because she tricked Alexander Whitmore into marriage?

But pride wouldn’t serve her now. Not when the stakes were this high.

Vanessa’s eyes glistened with unshed tears. "We don’t resent you, Aunt Evelyn."

Ryan Fletcher scoffed. "Is that so? Then show some respect! Don’t just stand there gawking."

A sharp-eyed maid materialized beside them, balancing a silver tray with two porcelain cups of freshly brewed coffee.

Swallowing her fury, Vanessa bowed slightly. "Uncle Alexander, Aunt Evelyn… please enjoy your coffee."

Every syllable tasted like ash.

The weight of her own words pressed down on her, a branding iron of submission.

And Evelyn?

She didn’t even blink.

Vanessa's eyes were bloodshot, her lips nearly white from how hard she'd been biting them. She looked utterly broken, like a fragile doll that had been tossed aside. Her fingers trembled around the coffee cup, barely keeping it steady.

"Poor thing," Evelyn murmured, reaching out to pat Vanessa's head as if soothing a frightened kitten.

Just as her fingers brushed Vanessa's, the cup tilted—too sudden, too careless. Scalding liquid splashed across Vanessa's delicate hands, searing her skin. A sharp cry tore from her throat as she jerked back, tears springing to her eyes.

"Vanessa!" Ethan's voice turned sharp with alarm as he rushed forward.

Her hands were already an angry red, the pain making her whimper. Yet she bit down on her lip, stifling her sobs, as if afraid to make too much noise. The sight of her—shaking, wounded, trying so hard to endure—was heartbreaking.

Evelyn, however, didn’t move. She simply watched, her expression cool and detached, as if this entire scene had nothing to do with her.

Ethan’s jaw tightened. "You’re married to Alexander now. Is it really so hard to show her a little kindness? Look at what you’ve done!" His voice was thick with accusation.

Vanessa flinched, curling in on herself, while Evelyn merely tilted her head, her gaze unreadable. The air between them crackled with tension, thick enough to choke on.

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "How is her clumsiness my responsibility? If she can't handle a simple coffee cup, that's hardly my fault." She gestured dismissively. "As her elder, I've shown remarkable patience already."

Her tone dripped with false magnanimity as she signaled for a servant to clean the shattered porcelain.

Ethan opened his mouth to protest, but Vanessa's fingers curled around his sleeve in a feather-light grip.

"It's alright, Ethan," she murmured, her voice trembling just enough to be noticeable. "The burn isn't serious. I only wish Aunt Evelyn wouldn't stay angry with me."

Her words were honey-coated poison, expertly reigniting Ethan's simmering rage. "Angry? What exactly did you do to warrant her anger?"

Vanessa bit her plump lower lip, eyes downcast. A single tear traced her cheek—a masterpiece of calculated vulnerability.

After a weighted pause, she whispered, "It's natural for Aunt Evelyn to...startle me sometimes."

Evelyn's laugh was ice cracking underfoot.

The implication hung thick—that Evelyn had caused the accident when her hands never touched the cup.

Ethan's jaw clenched. The injustice burned hotter than the coffee on Vanessa's skin.

His fury was a living thing now, coiled tight in his chest.

The air crackled with tension after Vanessa's calculated provocation.

"You belong to me. She wouldn't dare threaten you unless she thought I was weak!"

Ethan's gaze burned into Evelyn with barely contained fury. "How dare you humiliate Vanessa like this?"

Alexander's expression darkened. "Ethan, mind your tone."

"Uncle Alexander, you saw what happened!" Ethan gestured to Vanessa's reddened hands. "You can't favor Evelyn just because she's your wife!"

Alexander opened his mouth to respond, but Evelyn subtly caught his sleeve.

This was her battle to fight.

"Even if I swore I didn't spill that coffee, you'd never believe me."

With deliberate calm, Evelyn lifted the fresh cup a servant had just placed beside her. "An apology, was it? Fine."

Before anyone could react, she flung the scalding liquid straight at Vanessa's smug face.

Gasps erupted as Vanessa shrieked, coffee dripping from her chin onto her designer blouse. The perfect revenge served piping hot.

###Chapter 136 Still Drawn to Her
Vanessa's perfectly styled hair was now drenched, her mascara running in dark streaks down her cheeks.

"See clearly now? It's definitely me this time."

Ethan Caldwell's jaw dropped. "You—how dare you!"

Evelyn casually snatched two napkins from the table and tossed them toward Vanessa with a mocking smile.

"I despise being framed. Vanessa, surely you remember that?"

The room had been silent, merely observing—no one expected Evelyn to retaliate so boldly.

Her audacity left Vanessa speechless, frozen in shock.

All eyes flickered toward Alexander Whitmore, but his expression remained unreadable, showing no sign of reprimanding Evelyn.

Ryan Fletcher clapped slowly, a smirk playing on his lips. "Save your theatrics, Vanessa. Aunt Evelyn doesn’t bother with underhanded tricks. If she wanted to humiliate you, she’d do it openly. Why resort to such pettiness? Besides, this is Whitmore Manor. Did you really think your childish act would fool anyone?"

Vanessa’s face twisted in fury.

The room was filled with elegance and poise—except for her. Vanessa stood out like a ridiculous clown, the center of everyone's mocking gazes.

Audrey and Sophia observed from the sidelines, barely concealing their amusement. Even Grace couldn't hide her disdain.

"Ethan, your wife is utterly humiliating!"

Ethan's expression darkened. Seeing Vanessa biting her lip, her eyes shimmering with helplessness, a pang of pity twisted in his chest.

He turned sharply toward Grace. "Watch how you speak to her."

"I despise women who rely on cheap tricks to manipulate men."

As a Caldwell, Grace had been indulged since childhood. She had no patience for women who played the victim, using calculated vulnerability to win sympathy.

"No wonder Mother dislikes her. She’s an embarrassment."

Grace strode toward the door. "This is tedious. I’m leaving."

The air in the room thickened with tension. Vanessa had become the evening’s joke.

Humiliation burned through her. She wanted nothing more than to flee, but the elders hadn’t dismissed her yet. Leaving now would only make things worse.

Instead, she retreated to her room, desperate to fix her ruined makeup and change into something less... laughable.

But no matter what she did, the whispers followed her.

And the worst part?

Ethan still looked at her like she was worth saving.

She hated that most of all.

The silk blouse slipped from Vanessa's trembling fingers as she turned to face Ethan.

He stepped into the room, his expression unreadable. "Tell me the truth—did you deliberately spill that coffee earlier?"

Vanessa's breath hitched. Her wide eyes glistened with unshed tears. "You're doubting me now?"

Ethan rubbed his temple, his voice low. "Knowing Evelyn's character, she'd never humiliate you publicly like that."

A bitter laugh escaped Vanessa's lips. "Of course. Saint Evelyn is always perfect, isn't she?" Her nails dug into her palms. "Meanwhile, I burned myself just to frame her. Is that what you think?"

Her voice cracked. "You're my husband, Ethan. How can you defend her instead of me?"

Vanessa swayed on her feet, the weight of betrayal crushing her chest. "Tell me honestly—do you still have feelings for her? Regret marrying me?" Her lips twisted. "Too late. She's Alexander's wife now. Your aunt, remember?"

Ethan's jaw clenched. "That's ridiculous."

"Ridiculous?" Vanessa's laughter turned hysterical. "Last night, during your fever, you called out her name. Not mine—hers."

She'd sworn to bury that painful memory, but the dam had broken.

Tears streamed down her cheeks. "If you don't still love her, why would you—"

Ethan's phone buzzed, cutting her off. The screen flashed with a name that made Vanessa's blood run cold: Evelyn Carter.

His hesitation told her everything.

The accusation hung heavy in the air between us.

"Evelyn?" My voice was barely above a whisper, my heart pounding against my ribs.

Vanessa's eyes burned with fury as she stepped closer, her hands clenched into fists. "You called her name in your sleep last night, Ethan! How could you?"

I froze.

Had I really?

Memories of the previous night were hazy, blurred by exhaustion and the weight of everything left unsaid between us. But the thought that I might have murmured Evelyn's name—her name—sent a cold wave of dread through me.

Vanessa's voice cracked. "After everything, you still think about her? What am I to you, then?"

I swallowed hard, my throat tight.

This wasn't supposed to happen.

Not now.

Not when Vanessa and I had just begun our life together.

She turned away, her shoulders trembling. "I deserve better than this, Ethan. I deserve someone who doesn’t still love another woman."

The words struck like a blade.

Did I?

Did I still love Evelyn?

The question twisted inside me, sharp and unrelenting.

Vanessa didn’t wait for an answer. She stormed out, the door slamming behind her with finality.

I sank onto the edge of the bed, my head in my hands.

What had I done?

And more importantly—what was I going to do now?

###Chapter 137 Just Friends, Nothing More

The silence in the room was suffocating.

I stared at the closed door, my mind racing.

Nathan would know what to do. He always did.

But before I could reach for my phone, it buzzed on the nightstand.

A message from Alexander.

"We need to talk."

My stomach dropped.

This couldn’t be a coincidence.

Not now.

Not after last night.

I exhaled sharply, my fingers tightening around the phone.

Whatever was coming—I wasn’t ready for it.

But I had no choice.

I had to face this.

Even if it destroyed everything.

Ethan didn't even realize it himself.

Seeing the conflicted expression on his face, Vanessa's heart shattered into pieces.

She lunged forward, fists clenched, gripping his shirt tightly before pounding against his chest. "I won't accept this! You can't still have feelings for her. Ethan, you're mine! How dare you love someone else?"

It was the first time Ethan had ever seen Vanessa like this—wild, desperate, completely unhinged.

She had always been soft-spoken, sweet, and understanding around him. But now? She was clawing at him, screaming, acting like some jealous, scorned woman.

At first, Ethan had wanted to comfort her, to tell her she was overreacting. But now? Any sympathy he'd felt vanished.

His gaze turned cold. Without a word, he shoved her away and walked off.

Vanessa collapsed onto the floor, watching his retreating figure until he disappeared completely.

Her mind screamed. It's over. Everything is ruined.

This wasn’t how things were supposed to go.

No one from the Hayes family had shown up at the wedding yesterday. And today, Eleanor had singled her out.

All of it was a warning—one she couldn’t ignore.

No one noticed her crumbling.

Vanessa Hart stood frozen, her carefully constructed world shattering around her. She had believed becoming part of the Whitmore family would secure her future, but she never anticipated Alexander Whitmore and Evelyn Carter’s sudden marriage.

The weight of betrayal pressed down on her chest.

By the time Vanessa composed herself and stepped out of the grand hall, Whitmore Manor was eerily silent.

Evelyn had already left.

Outside, a rare vintage car gleamed under the afternoon sun. Alexander held the door open for her, his expression unreadable.

Ryan Fletcher, trailing behind them, whistled in admiration. "That’s a collector’s edition! Uncle Alexander, this is incredible. Mind giving me a ride?"

Alexander didn’t respond, but the cold dismissal in his eyes was answer enough.

Ryan chuckled awkwardly before sidling closer to Evelyn, lowering his voice. "You two already got the marriage license, didn’t you? All that chasing you did before—was it just an act?"

The pieces clicked together in his mind. That disastrous blind date, Alexander’s abrupt interruption—it all made sense now.

Today’s events had only confirmed his suspicions.

Something deeper was at play.

No wonder Alexander had given me that warning look back then, emphasizing that employees of Titan Capital Group were strictly forbidden from romantic entanglements.

It wasn’t about restrictions—it was because they were already together. They just couldn’t make it public.

Evelyn nodded. "Exactly."

Ryan’s jaw dropped. "You’ve got to be kidding me! Then why did you let me humiliate myself like that? No way, I’m not doing it!"

Alexander flicked open his silver lighter, the flame igniting with a sharp click. A cold, dangerous aura radiated from him.

Ryan froze when he met Alexander’s piercing gaze.

Alexander clapped a heavy hand on Ryan’s shoulder, the weight of his presence suffocating. "Ryan, I heard you’ve been trying to win over Evelyn. Care to explain?"

Ryan stiffened. "That’s not true, Mr. Whitmore."

Alexander’s lips curved into a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. "Are you sure?"

The unspoken threat in his tone sent a chill down Ryan’s spine.

Lying would only make things worse. Ryan swallowed hard. "Okay, fine! I only did it to mess with Ethan. But—"

"Uncle Alexander, with you here, I wouldn't dare."

It was common knowledge that Ryan and Ethan had been at odds since childhood.

Seeing Alexander's displeasure, Ryan quickly backtracked, his words spilling out in a nervous rush.

"Don't worry, Uncle Alexander! I swear, I have no inappropriate intentions toward Aunt Evelyn. At most, we're just friends!"

He flashed a charming smile, adding, "You know what they say—the enemy of my enemy is my ally."

The ice in Alexander's gaze thawed slightly.

Just then, Ethan stepped out of Whitmore Manor.

###Chapter 138 Get Out of Bed

Ryan smirked, crossing his arms as he blocked Ethan's path. "Ethan, where's your better half? Leaving all by yourself? Trouble in paradise?"

"Mind your own damn business." Ethan's jaw clenched, his mood darker than the storm clouds overhead.

Seeing Evelyn and Alexander together had twisted something inside him, a bitter taste lingering in his mouth.

But Ryan wasn't done. He leaned in, grinning. "Come on, give me the scoop. How do you feel about Uncle Alexander marrying Evelyn? Any regrets?"

"I said shut your mouth!"

Ethan's head pounded—last night's whiskey, the relentless rain, and now this fever burning through him. Humiliation coiled tight in his chest, a snake ready to strike.

All he wanted was to collapse somewhere quiet and make sense of the wreckage.

None of this felt real. It couldn’t be.

Evelyn turned away, her fingers brushing Alexander's. "Where should we go for dinner?"

Secret Longing: A Love Reclaimed

Ryan smirked, crossing his arms as he blocked Ethan's path. "Ethan, where's your wife? Leaving alone? Trouble in paradise?"

"Mind your own damn business." Ethan's jaw clenched, his mood darker than the storm clouds overhead.

Seeing Evelyn and Alexander together had twisted something inside him, a bitter taste lingering in his mouth.

But Ryan wasn't done. He leaned in, voice dripping with mock concern. "Tell me, how does it feel knowing Uncle Alexander is marrying Evelyn? Regret stings, doesn't it?"

"I said shut your mouth!"

Ethan's head throbbed—a brutal combination of last night's whiskey, the relentless downpour, and the fever burning through him. And now this humiliation? It was too much.

His vision blurred at the edges. All he wanted was to collapse somewhere quiet and process the wreckage of his life.

None of this felt real. It couldn't be.

Across the room, Evelyn turned away, her fingers intertwining with Alexander's. "Where should we go for dinner?" she murmured, her voice soft, deliberate.

Alexander's thumb brushed over her knuckles. "Anywhere you want, darling."

The words sliced through Ethan like a blade.

Realizing that Alexander and Evelyn were only marrying for a business arrangement, Ethan suddenly felt a weight lift off his shoulders.

Ethan convinced himself, "Evelyn doesn’t love Uncle Alexander. She only married him to prove something today."

"Yes, that has to be it."

"Hey! Have you lost your mind?"

Ryan stood beside him, watching Ethan’s expression shift from confusion to relief. He waved a hand in front of Ethan’s face, but got no reaction.

After calling his name several times with no response, Ryan sighed in frustration.

Without a word, Ethan abruptly got into his car and sped off in the direction Alexander and Evelyn had gone.

Dinner had been a quiet affair.

Alexander drove Evelyn back to her apartment, his grip on the steering wheel tight.

Parking outside her building, he turned to study her face. "You’re moving back tonight. Go pack your things. I’ll pick you up after I finish at the office."

The unspoken meaning behind his words made Evelyn’s cheeks flush.

She nodded, stepping out of the car.

As she watched his sleek black sedan disappear down the street, her phone buzzed.

Claire’s name flashed on the screen.

"So? How did it go?"

Evelyn quickly filled Claire in on everything that had happened at Whitmore Manor earlier that day.

Claire burst into laughter on the other end of the call. "That’s brilliant! She actually respected you? If Vanessa dares to mess with you again, just throw this in her face. She’ll be absolutely humiliated. This will haunt her forever."

Vanessa was the type who thrived on pride. What had transpired today would undoubtedly shatter her confidence for quite some time.

"Alright, I should go. I need to head upstairs and pack. Alexander wants me to move back home tonight."

Claire’s voice turned teasing. "Sounds like someone’s eager for some quality time."

Evelyn’s cheeks burned. "Stop it."

"Take it slow tonight. You’ve got all the time in the world. Don’t overdo it—unless you want to be stuck in bed tomorrow."

Flustered, Evelyn ended the call—only to freeze when she spotted a figure standing a short distance away.
###Chapter 139 A Silent Farewell

Evelyn turned away without a word, her heels clicking against the pavement as she headed toward Willowbrook Apartments.

Suddenly, Ethan Caldwell lunged from his car, his fingers closing around her wrist like a vice.

He dragged her into the shadowed alley beside the building. "You and Alexander have a marriage contract, don't you?"

Her pulse spiked. "That's none of your concern! Whatever arrangement we have doesn't involve you!"

His grip tightened. "The hell it doesn't. You're mine, Evelyn. If I say it matters, then it does."

She scoffed, wrenching free. "Are you delusional? You're married. I'm married. Since when am I yours?"

Her palm cracked against his cheek. "And let’s get one thing straight—you will address me as Mrs. Whitmore, you insolent little fool."

Ethan’s audacity left her breathless.

Had he been tailing them since they left the Whitmore Manor gathering?

Now that Alexander wasn’t here to shield her, he thought he could corner her like this?

The alley walls seemed to press closer, the air thick with tension.

Evelyn squared her shoulders, meeting his stormy gaze head-on. "Walk away, Ethan. Before this gets ugly."

A slow, dangerous smirk curled his lips. "Oh, sweetheart… it already is."

Was that all Ethan could do? Why couldn't he face Alexander directly? Evelyn thought bitterly.

She attempted to brush past him, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

There was nothing left to say between them.

Yet his grip on her wrist remained unyielding. Her words had cracked his carefully maintained facade.

His stormy blue eyes darkened, the veins in his neck standing out as he stared at her in disbelief.

"You married Alexander? That's impossible—it can't be real!" His voice was rough with desperation. "This has to be some kind of arrangement."

Yes, he convinced himself. It had to be a marriage of convenience.

No love, no passion—just another cold alliance between powerful families, bound by mutual gain and destined to dissolve when the benefits ran dry.

His jaw tightened as he studied her, his mind made up.

"You're doing this because I married Vanessa," he accused, his tone hardening. "You want me to regret it."

Before she could respond, he yanked out his phone, shoving it toward her.

"Unblock me, Evelyn. Add me back—now."

His demand hung in the air, sharp and unrelenting.

Evelyn stared at Ethan Caldwell, and suddenly, she found him…utterly absurd.

The truth was staring him right in the face, yet Ethan stubbornly refused to accept it. He kept demanding answers—whether her marriage to Alexander was merely a business arrangement rather than a union of love.

But what did it matter now? Even if he got his confirmation, could they ever turn back time?

Their issues had never been about Alexander.

"You're married. So am I." Evelyn's voice was calm, detached. "Let's just leave things as they are."

She slipped her wrist free from his grasp. "Let's end this civilly."

"Evelyn, don't you dare walk away!" Ethan's voice cracked like a whip. "Did I say you could leave? You’re not going anywhere!"

He lunged forward, closing the distance between them. "End this civilly? You chased me for seven years, and now you think you can just walk away with a single sentence?"

"Then what do you want?" Her gaze was steady, unflinching.

"You were the one who pursued me first." His jaw tightened. "So, the ending should be mine to decide."

Evelyn almost laughed. She studied him, her expression cool and unreadable.

The rain had started to fall, a soft drizzle that blurred the edges of the world.

Ethan Caldwell stood there, his chest tight, his breath coming in shallow gasps. The words still echoed in his mind, sharp as knives.

"Ethan, are you insane? Let me make this clear—you will call me Aunt Evelyn now. I am Alexander Whitmore's wife."

Her voice had been ice. Unyielding.

"You think this isn't over? Go ask Alexander if he agrees!"

With that, Evelyn had turned away, her heels clicking against the marble floor as she ascended the stairs without a backward glance.

Ethan reached out, as if to stop her, but a wave of dizziness crashed over him. His vision swam. He pressed a hand against the wall, sliding down until he crouched on the floor, his lungs burning.

She didn’t look back. Not even when his knees hit the ground. Not even when his breath hitched.

The realization struck him like a physical blow.

This coldness… this finality…

The woman who had once chased after him, who had always been there when he turned around—she was gone.

Not just from this moment. Not just from the second she had declared her love for Alexander in front of everyone.

No.

She had let him go long before that.

###Chapter 140 Lingering Affection

The weight in Ethan’s chest was unbearable, like a boulder pressing down on his ribs. His thoughts were a tangled mess, stretched thin like a wire about to snap.

This feeling—this suffocating, clawing emotion—was foreign to him. In all his twenty-eight years, he had never known anything like it.

It terrified him.

Why?

Why did it hurt like this?

He didn’t love Evelyn. He couldn’t.

He was just… adjusting. That was all.

Just unused to her absence.

Just needed time.

Then everything would go back to normal.

Upstairs, Evelyn pushed open the window, letting the cool night air wash over her. Her gaze drifted downward, and there he was—still there.

From the tenth floor, even a man like Ethan Caldwell looked small. Insignificant.

He sat on the pavement, his expensive suit rumpled, his pride discarded like yesterday’s news.

She turned away.

Outside, the drizzle turned to rain.

The rain pattered against the windowpane, threatening to seep inside. Evelyn hurried to shut it tight.

But when she glanced down again, her breath caught. Ethan was still there.

He hadn’t moved an inch, frozen in place like a statue carved from grief.

From her vantage point, Evelyn realized it wasn’t by choice. Ethan couldn’t move.

He swayed slightly, his hands braced against the pavement as he struggled to rise—and failed. The rain had turned into a downpour, soaking him to the bone.

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms. After a heartbeat of hesitation, she grabbed her phone and dialed Trevor.

Ten minutes later, headlights cut through the storm as Trevor’s car screeched to a halt at the alley’s entrance.

"Ethan, what the hell?"

Trevor sprinted forward, umbrella in hand, his shoes splashing through puddles.

"Weren’t you supposed to be with Vanessa at Whitmore Manor today? How did you end up like this?"

Only when he crouched beside Ethan did Trevor notice the unnatural pallor of his skin. He gripped Ethan’s arm—burning with fever—and hauled him up with a grunt.

"You're burning up! We need to get you to a doctor now."

Ethan stumbled into the car, his mind foggy. Trevor's voice sounded distant, like an echo underwater.

No matter how much Trevor rambled beside him, Ethan barely registered a word.

The hospital came into view quickly. A physician rushed over the moment they arrived.

Lying on the sterile white bed, Ethan felt the cool sting of the IV needle piercing his skin.

Trevor frowned. "Ethan, what's going on with you?"

Ethan's gaze remained fixed on the ceiling for a long, silent moment before he finally spoke. "Evelyn married Alexander."

"What?"

Trevor's jaw dropped. "You can't be serious. That's impossible."

"You think she did it to hurt me, don't you?" Ethan suddenly gripped Trevor's arm, his fingers digging in.

"Because I married Vanessa, she wanted revenge. So she married Alexander out of spite."

Trevor was stunned. He couldn't believe Evelyn would go that far just to—

Trevor scoffed internally. What kind of woman would be reckless enough to weaponize marriage just to spite an ex?

But seeing Ethan’s disheveled state, he bit back the remark.

Ethan’s grip tightened as he demanded, "How did you even know I was in that alley?"

"Vanessa called me," Trevor admitted, wincing as he pried Ethan’s fingers off his arm.

Ethan froze. "What did you just say?"

"Ow—easy!" Trevor yanked his wrist free, rubbing the sore spot.

Without hesitation, Ethan snatched Trevor’s phone, scanning the call history.

There it was—Vanessa’s number, clear as day.

She actually reached out to Trevor for me.

His pulse spiked, a wild rush of hope and disbelief flooding him.

A slow, triumphant grin spread across his face. "I knew it. She still cares. Why else would she contact you to find me?"

The realization sent a reckless thrill through him.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.
###Chapter 141 The Silent Epiphany

A wave of unexpected clarity washed over Ethan Caldwell.

"So it was all true. Evelyn Carter and Alexander Whitmore never had romantic feelings for each other. Their marriage was purely transactional."

Evelyn had married Alexander to spite him—that much was obvious.

But why had Alexander agreed?

A man like Alexander Whitmore, who had shown zero interest in women for nearly three decades, suddenly tying the knot with Evelyn? Love was out of the question.

There had to be another reason.

Was he pressured into it by William Hayes?

Yes, that had to be it.

At twenty-nine, Alexander must have grown tired of the constant nagging about settling down. Marrying Evelyn was simply the path of least resistance.

A marriage of convenience. Mutual benefit, nothing more.

Trevor Moss frowned, sensing something wasn’t adding up.

Trevor's mind raced as he pieced together recent events.

Ethan had once treated Evelyn with complete indifference, as if she didn't exist. Now, he was obsessed with her every move.

He had even abandoned Vanessa, his newlywed wife, without a second thought.

Something was very wrong.

A daring thought struck Trevor. Ethan cares for Evelyn—maybe even loves her without realizing it.

Earlier, when Evelyn had called, her tone had been chilling.

What had she repeated?

"Trevor, Ethan's about to die."

Those words had sent a jolt of terror through him. He'd demanded an explanation, but Evelyn's voice had been glacial. Even through the phone, he could picture her blank expression.

"You'll see when you get here," she'd said.

Then, she'd hung up and sent the address.

Her message was clear. Evelyn wanted Ethan gone—like he was nothing more than a persistent pest.

Trevor doubted Evelyn held any lingering affection for Ethan.

But now, watching Ethan's desperate state, he wasn't sure if revealing the truth was wise.

If he did, Ethan would undoubtedly shatter.

By dusk, Alexander's car arrived at the apartment.

Evelyn had already packed everything.

Alexander effortlessly lifted her suitcase into the trunk.

As they drove, Evelyn realized they weren't heading to their usual home.

She turned to Alexander, puzzled. "Where are we going?"

"Somewhere bigger."

He had clearly planned this. Evelyn simply nodded.

Thirty minutes later, they arrived at an opulent villa.

A sprawling garden welcomed them, meticulously tended by gardeners. The scent of blooming flowers carried on the breeze.

The mansion was vast, every corner reflecting Alexander's impeccable taste. Evelyn suspected he had lived here long before their marriage.

Yet, apart from the security at the gate, the place felt eerily empty.

"Did he really live in this enormous house alone?"

Her mind wandered to his past, and an unexpected pang of sympathy struck her.

"Cast aside by his family as a child, surviving in a rundown shack for years."

"The housekeeping staff comes weekly. You won’t need to lift a finger."

Alexander’s voice pulled her from her thoughts. "I’ve stocked up on essentials. If anything’s missing, we’ll get it."

Evelyn nodded, slipping into the slippers by the door before stepping further inside.

The unfamiliarity of the space made her hesitate. Her gaze swept over the grand interiors, searching for something familiar.

"The bedrooms are upstairs. Feel free to look around."

Alexander filled two glasses from the water dispenser. He drained one in a single gulp before turning to hand the other to Evelyn.

His fingers brushed against hers, sending an unexpected jolt through her.

She took the glass, her pulse quickening.

The silence between them stretched, heavy with unspoken words.

Evelyn sipped the water, her eyes darting away.

The house might have been his for years, but now, it was theirs.

And that realization settled between them, quiet but undeniable.

The moment Evelyn disappeared up the staircase, Alexander couldn't suppress the grin tugging at his lips.

He took the steps two at a time, following her.

The second floor held three rooms—one of them a study, its door slightly ajar.

But Evelyn didn’t stop there.

She pushed open another door—and froze.

The room was bathed in the soft glow of countless candles, their flickering light casting dancing shadows across walls adorned with cascading roses.

Her breath caught.

###Chapter 142 A Kiss to Prove It

"We didn't celebrate properly when we got married, so I wanted to make it special," Alexander murmured, his voice low and intimate.

Evelyn had insisted on keeping things simple—no grand ceremony, no extravagant reception. He had respected her wishes, but tonight was different. Tonight, he wanted her to remember.

She pushed open the door and froze.

The room was bathed in the warm glow of candlelight, casting flickering shadows across the king-sized bed strewn with deep crimson roses. Their petals shimmered like rubies against the ivory sheets, the rich scent enveloping her.

Before she could speak, she heard the door click shut behind her.

Alexander was already there, his presence overwhelming the space between them.

In one swift motion, he closed the distance, his arms encircling her waist, pulling her flush against him. The heat of his body seared through the thin fabric of her dress as he pinned her against the door.

His lips claimed hers with a hunger that stole her breath.

The intoxicating blend of his cologne and the faint hint of whiskey on his tongue made her head spin. The cool wood pressed into her back, a stark contrast to the fire coursing through her veins.

His fingers tangled with hers, lifting her arms above her head, trapping her in place. The position sent a flush creeping up her neck, her pulse hammering wildly.

Outside, night had fallen completely, the room illuminated only by the flickering candles.

Evelyn swallowed hard, meeting Alexander’s gaze. His eyes burned with raw intensity, dark with need.

"Mrs. Whitmore." His thumb traced the delicate curve of her jaw before drifting lower, skimming the hollow of her throat. "Has anyone ever told you how breathtaking you look in that dress?"

Her breath hitched. Compliments from him were rare—so rare that they always caught her off guard.

She ducked her head, but he caught her chin, tilting her face back up.

This time, his kiss was rougher, more demanding. When she instinctively turned away, he chuckled darkly.

"Running from me now?" His voice was a velvet growl. "You weren’t so shy when you teased me in the car earlier."

His fingers tangled in her hair, angling her head back as his lips trailed down her neck, nipping and tasting.

Evelyn gasped, her knees giving way beneath her.

The world spun as Evelyn's knees gave way, only to be caught against Alexander's solid chest.

His strong arm encircled her waist effortlessly, guiding her backward until the mattress met her legs.

Before she could protest, his weight pressed her into the sheets, the shift in position igniting a new intensity between them.

Her thoughts blurred, the air thick with unspoken desire.

Their breaths tangled as her fingers suddenly wrapped around his wrist, halting his descent. "Wait—Alexander, we haven't eaten yet."

He lifted his head, his darkened gaze pinning her beneath him. "Dinner?"

She couldn't hold his stare, her focus dropping to the tantalizing curve of his throat. "Yes, dinner. I'm hungry."

A low chuckle rumbled from his chest. The hunger in his eyes wasn't just for food. "Is this your way of teasing me?"

"I—I'm not!" Her teeth sank into her lower lip.

Alexander braced himself above her, studying her with unnerving focus. "No? Then prove it." His voice dropped to a whisper. "Kiss me."

Evelyn's pulse stuttered. "You can't be serious."

Her pulse stuttered. The sudden realization that she'd stepped into a carefully laid snare made her breath catch.

But retreating now would only confirm his suspicions. She'd already taken the bait—there was no turning back.

Evelyn's heartbeat thundered in her ears.

After a weighted pause, she curled her fingers into Alexander's tie, tugging him down with deliberate slowness.

Her lashes dipped as she brushed her lips against the vulnerable hollow of his throat—a featherlight press that sent electricity crackling between them.

Alexander's entire body tensed. "Who," he rasped, fingers digging into her waist, "taught you to aim there?"

###Chapter 143 Let’s Do It First

Alexander’s gaze burned into her, his body radiating heat like a furnace. His voice was rough with barely restrained hunger.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She had been too distracted by the way his throat moved, the sharp line of his Adam’s apple tempting her lips. Why is he looking at me like that? Did I do something wrong?

He closed the distance between them, his touch sending sparks skittering across her skin. Instinctively, she tangled her fingers in his hair as he pressed closer, impatient.

A gasp escaped her when his mouth crashed against hers, wild and demanding. His kiss was relentless, stealing her breath, leaving her dizzy.

Alexander knew exactly what he was doing. Within moments, Evelyn was liquid in his arms, her body yielding completely.

They were adults. The tension between them was undeniable, electric.

She sank back onto the silk sheets, her eyes dark with desire, cheeks flushed as she stared up at him.

Just as their breathing turned ragged, his hand slid down her waist—only for his phone to vibrate insistently in his pocket.

The moment was electric, charged with unspoken desire. Then the shrill ring of a phone shattered the silence.

Alexander had no patience for interruptions. With a frustrated growl, he silenced the device and flung it onto the nearby couch.

But then, Evelyn's phone buzzed to life.

As she reached for it, Alexander caught her wrist, his grip firm. The air between them crackled with tension, thick with need.

Evelyn's voice came out breathless, husky. "What if it's urgent?"

Alexander's restraint shattered. He pulled her onto his lap, his arms locking around her waist. "Nothing is more urgent than this."

His kiss was relentless, stealing her breath, her thoughts—everything.

In the dim light, Evelyn heard the soft click of a belt being undone.

Alexander's voice was low, rough with desire. "Let's do this first. Just once," he murmured against her lips.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. She buried her face against his chest, but Alexander wouldn't allow it. He tipped her chin up, forcing her to meet his darkened gaze.

Evelyn stared at him, her breath hitching as Alexander claimed her with a single, powerful thrust.

His dominance was absolute, leaving no room for hesitation.

Her pulse raced, every nerve alight with sensation.

That night, they surrendered completely to each other, insatiable, lost in the storm of their passion.

Later, Alexander finally turned his phone back on.

Beside him, Evelyn lay curled on her side, utterly spent, her long lashes brushing her flushed cheeks.

Her dark hair fanned across the pillow, one silken strand draped over his chest, right above his heart.

He absently twirled the strand around his fingers, his other hand bringing the phone to his ear as Lucas’s call connected.

“Dinner tonight. You in?” Lucas’s voice was muffled, the clatter of cards in the background. “I’ve been waiting for ages. Why the hell did you take so long to call back?”

Alexander smirked, his thumb tracing idle circles on Evelyn’s bare shoulder.

“I was busy with my wife.”

Lucas groaned. “Spare me the details, you bastard. Not all of us are—”

Alexander let out a low chuckle. "Fair point. Technically married still counts."

"Cut me some slack, will you?" Lucas snapped, his voice rising. "Who said anything about divorce? Claire's pregnant—I'm going to be a father! We're staying together!"

Isabella, who'd been lingering nearby, immediately turned her head at his outburst.

Watching Lucas end the call, she approached with a wine glass in hand and settled beside him. "Lucas... Claire's pregnant?"

"Yeah." He nodded absently, tossing his poker cards onto the table before checking his watch.

8:03 PM.

He stood abruptly, smoothing his dress shirt. "I'm out. Heading home."

His poker buddies gaped at him. "Bailing already?"

"Yep." Lucas slung his jacket over one shoulder. "You guys have families too. Should wrap it up early. What's the point of gambling when you could be home with your wives?"

One of them burst out laughing. "Look at Mr. Domestic over here. Claire gives you two weeks of peace and suddenly you're the poster boy for marital bliss."

"Absolutely! Wasn’t it you who got thrown out by your wife and came crawling to us every night for poker?"

Lucas Bennett let out a rough laugh before snapping, "All of you, scram!"

As he turned to leave, Isabella Rhodes rose gracefully from her seat.

Her wide, shimmering eyes held an air of innocence, masking something far more calculated. "Lucas," she said sweetly, "I’ll walk you out. I’m heading home too."

The two stepped out of the private room, one after the other.

Then—

Isabella’s heel caught on the edge of the carpet.

She stumbled, her ankle twisting sharply beneath her.

A gasp escaped her lips as she reached out instinctively—

Her fingers brushed against Lucas’s sleeve.

His reflexes were quick.

A strong hand shot out, steadying her before she could fall.

For a heartbeat, they stood there, frozen.

Her breath hitched.

His grip tightened.

Then, just as suddenly, he released her.

"Careful," Lucas muttered, his voice gruff.

Isabella smoothed her dress, her smile returning as if nothing had happened.

But beneath that flawless exterior, her mind was already racing.

This was exactly the opportunity she needed.

And she wasn’t about to waste it.

To be continued...
###Chapter 144 Unexpected Pain

Isabella gasped sharply, clutching her stomach. Lucas frowned, his grip tightening on her arm. "What happened?"

"A sudden pain..." she whispered, her face paling.

They stood on the uneven gravel path, the dim streetlights casting long shadows. A shallow ditch ran alongside the walkway, barely noticeable in the fading daylight.

Lucas's gaze dropped to her feet, then snapped back to her face, his expression hardening. "Can you stand?"

She was a dancer—her legs were her livelihood. An injury now could ruin everything.

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes as she tried to shift her weight. A sharp inhale escaped her. "It's bad," she admitted, voice trembling. "My recital is in three days. What if—?"

"Lean on me." Lucas slid an arm around her waist, steadying her. "We're going to the hospital."

She nodded weakly, fingers digging into his sleeve for balance.

By the time he helped her into the passenger seat, silent tears streaked her cheeks. She looked fragile, her usual confidence shattered.

The engine roared to life. Only then did she speak, hesitant. "Claire won't like this. Maybe you should just call me a cab instead."

The car pulled over abruptly at the curb.

"I'll get out here," Isabella Rhodes said, her voice tight. "Just drop me at the roadside. I'll take a cab to the hospital."

Lucas Bennett's brows furrowed. "Claire isn't like that."

"Is that so?" Isabella's long, tangled hair spilled over her shoulders as she stared blankly out the window. Her lips trembled slightly, her thoughts distant, silent tears rolling down onto her tightly clenched hands.

Lucas reached for his phone, intending to call Claire, but the screen remained dark—dead. He exhaled sharply and gave up.

Evelyn Carter stirred awake half an hour later, blinking against the darkness.

The space beside her was empty. Hunger gnawed at her stomach, but the memory of the missed call jolted her fully awake. She snatched her phone and dialed back immediately. "Claire? What's wrong?"

Claire's voice was faint, strained. "Evelyn... my stomach... it hurts."

Evelyn bolted upright. "Where's Lucas? Didn't he take you to the hospital?"

"I couldn't reach him."

"Hold on. I'm coming now." Evelyn yanked on her clothes as she rushed toward the door.

The commotion drew Alexander Whitmore from the kitchen. "What happened?"

"Claire's in pain, and Lucas isn't answering. I have to get her to the hospital," Evelyn explained, shoving her feet into her shoes.

Alexander grabbed his keys. "I'll drive."

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn guided Claire into the obstetrics ward.

Alexander lingered in the car, unwilling to risk an uncomfortable encounter.

The doctor's diagnosis came swiftly—overexertion, early signs of a potential miscarriage. Bed rest was non-negotiable.

Claire's face crumpled. "A model with a baby... I'm destroying my career, aren't I?" Her voice cracked. "All that work... Why does everything have to be so hard?"

She had clawed her way to principal dancer, only for a shattered leg to steal it all away.

Now, just as modeling began to take off—pregnancy.

Evelyn murmured reassurances, helping Claire settle in the lobby before heading to the billing counter.

But when she returned—Claire was gone.

The seat was empty. No answer on her phone.

Evelyn's pulse spiked. The hospital was eerily quiet at this hour. Where the hell had she gone?

Claire wouldn’t just leave without saying anything.

Thinking she might have gone to the restroom, Evelyn took a few steps in that direction.

Just then, someone emerged from the men’s restroom, colliding with her.

It was Ethan.

A cooling patch clung to his forehead, and his usually immaculate hair was disheveled, strands falling across his brow. The effect was startling—softer, almost vulnerable.

Evelyn froze.

His eyes, usually sharp and calculating, were clouded with exhaustion.

She hadn’t expected to see him here.

Not like this.

Not when she was already on edge.

A tense silence stretched between them.

Then, his lips parted.

"Evelyn."

Her name on his tongue sent an unwanted shiver down her spine.

She took a step back.

But before she could speak, a sharp cry echoed from down the hall.

Claire’s voice.

Panicked.

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Something was wrong.

Horribly wrong.

She turned and ran.

Ethan’s footsteps followed.

Neither of them was prepared for what they would find.
###Chapter 145 You Have Feelings for Me

Ethan's eyes widened slightly when he spotted Evelyn.

His first instinct was that she had come because she cared—that she was worried about him and wanted to make sure he was okay.

"Even if you're desperate to see me, following me to the restroom is a little extreme," Ethan murmured, tilting his head to meet her gaze.

His fever still hadn't broken, and the doctor had strongly recommended he stay overnight for observation.

Evelyn, however, looked utterly bewildered.

"You're imagining things. I'm here for Claire," she said flatly, brushing past him as she headed toward the women's restroom across the hall.

She checked every stall, but Claire was nowhere to be found. With a frustrated sigh, she stepped back into the hallway.

Ethan was still there, leaning lazily against the doorframe, arms crossed. As if he had been waiting for her.

Evelyn shot him a quick, unreadable glance before looking away. Without a word, she walked past him, her steps brisk.

Ethan's fingers wrapped around Evelyn's wrist with unexpected force. "If you wanted to see me, you could've just said so. No need for these childish games."

Evelyn jerked her hand free, glaring at him. "Where do you even get this arrogance from? Do you own this entire hospital?" Her voice dripped with disdain. "My being here has nothing to do with you. Get over yourself."

A smirk played on Ethan's lips as he studied her retreating figure. "I know the truth, Evelyn. Your marriage to Alexander is nothing but a business arrangement. No love, just cold calculations." His voice lowered. "Admit it—you still have feelings for me."

Evelyn clenched her fists, resisting the urge to smack that smug look off his face.

Was he seriously this delusional?

She had considered a prenup, but Alexander refused outright. "Everything I have is yours," he'd said. "There’s no need for contracts between us."

She wasn’t about to waste another second entertaining Ethan’s nonsense. Claire was missing, and that was all that mattered.

But before she could walk away, his hand shot out again, gripping her arm. "You married him just to spite me, didn’t you?" His voice was rough, almost desperate. "Well, congratulations. You won. So what now, Evelyn? What do you really want?"

Evelyn's expression darkened as Ethan's fingers clamped around her wrist like unyielding iron shackles, trapping her in place.

She struggled against his grip, frustration bubbling up inside her, when a dangerously low voice cut through the air behind them.

"Ethan, do you have a death wish?"

At the sound, Ethan whipped his head around, his gaze colliding with Alexander's icy stare from just a few feet away.

"Evelyn came with him?" The realization struck Ethan like a physical blow—she wasn’t here for him at all.

Before he could react, Alexander had already closed the distance between them. The moment their eyes met, Ethan’s confidence shattered, his grip slackening instinctively.

Evelyn yanked her hand free, rubbing her wrist as she quickly stepped behind Alexander, putting distance between herself and Ethan.

Seeing them standing together sent a sharp, suffocating pressure through Ethan’s chest.

"Uncle Alexander," he muttered, voice tight.

Alexander didn’t acknowledge the greeting. His tone was razor-sharp. "And what about Evelyn?"

Ethan stayed silent.

A slow, humorless smile curved Alexander’s lips as he pressed his tongue against the inside of his cheek, radiating dominance. He lifted a hand—

His gaze flickered toward him with an amused smirk. "Cat got your tongue? Or are you sulking? Did Uncle Alexander steal your girl?"

The crushing weight pressed down on Ethan like an avalanche, paralyzing every muscle in his body.

A heavy silence stretched between them before Ethan abruptly lifted his head, locking eyes with Alexander. "You knew about Evelyn and me... So why marry her?"

The air crackled with unspoken accusations.

Ethan's jaw clenched as he waited for the answer that could shatter whatever remained between them.

Alexander merely arched a brow, the ghost of a knowing smile playing on his lips. "Isn't it obvious?"

The challenge hung in the air like a blade.

Ethan's fists tightened at his sides. This wasn't just about stolen love—it was about betrayal from the one person he'd never expected to cross him.

Somewhere in the mansion, a clock chimed midnight.

The sound echoed through the tense silence like a verdict.
###Chapter 146 Regret

This was utterly incomprehensible.

At the family dinner, Alexander had offered no explanation for why he married her.

"Was it because Grandfather pressured you into marriage?" Ethan turned the question over in his mind repeatedly. It was the only logical conclusion he could reach.

"So, you simply grew tired of resisting, and when Evelyn pursued you to spite me, you decided to marry her just to settle the matter?"

Evelyn's gaze flickered to Alexander. Truthfully, Ethan's confusion mirrored her own.

She had sought protection in him—but what had he gained from this arrangement?

Alexander's lips curved into a faint, enigmatic smile as he lowered his eyes. "She saved my life. Isn't it only natural that I dedicate myself to repaying her?"

"Saved your life?" Ethan's brow furrowed.

Alexander's gaze lingered on Evelyn's delicate features. "Ten years ago. She was the one who pulled me from death's grasp."

A wave of realization washed over Ethan. "So that's why..."

"Repaying a life-saving debt."

Alexander only saw Evelyn as someone he owed—nothing more.

"But—" His fingers absently traced the faint bite mark on his throat, barely visible beneath his loosened collar.

The dark red mark stood out starkly against his skin, impossible for Ethan to miss.

Ethan froze, his breath hitching, before Alexander's voice dropped low beside his ear. "That's not all."

Alexander tilted his chin toward Evelyn, his expression unreadable. "She kissed me first. In public. As a man, I have obligations."

A ghost of a smirk played at his lips. "And there's another reason. I like her. Since the feeling is mutual, marriage is the logical next step."

"That's impossible." Ethan stumbled back, his face draining of color.

Alexander Whitmore—interested in Evelyn? The thought was absurd.

"Why impossible?" Alexander remained relaxed, one hand tucked in his pocket as he studied Ethan with detached amusement.

"I've been single for twenty-nine years." His voice was smooth, deliberate. "Don't I deserve to choose?"

The words hung in the air like an unshakable truth.

Alexander Whitmore, the man who had never shown interest in anyone, had just declared his feelings for Evelyn Carter.

Ethan Caldwell stood frozen, his mind reeling.

His mouth opened, but no sound came out.

Shock. Disbelief. A creeping dread settled in his chest.

Then his gaze landed on the faint bite mark on Alexander’s throat.

His blood ran cold.

Evelyn had done that.

The realization hit him like a physical blow.

Alexander—cold, untouchable Alexander—had allowed her to leave her mark on him.

How far had things gone between them?

Vanessa Hart, standing nearby, barely suppressed a scoff.

She knew better.

Alexander wasn’t some lovestruck fool.

This was calculated.

A year ago, he had taken control of Titan Capital Group with ruthless precision.

Now, he was playing a different game.

And Evelyn was at the center of it.

Ethan finally found his voice.

"You—you can’t be serious."

Alexander arched a brow.

"Why not? Do you think I’m incapable of falling for someone?"

His tone was light, almost amused.

But his eyes were sharp.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, shooting him a sideways glance.

He was too good at this.

Too convincing.

If she didn’t know better, she might have believed him herself.

Ethan’s hands clenched at his sides.

He had lost.

Not just Evelyn.

But to him.

Alexander Whitmore.

The man who never lost.

And now, he had taken the one thing Ethan thought was still his.

The silence stretched, thick with tension.

Then Alexander reached out, his fingers brushing Evelyn’s wrist.

A silent claim.

Ethan’s jaw tightened.

He had no words left.

Only regret.

Ethan Caldwell's chest tightened as if an invisible boulder was crushing him.

Alexander Whitmore casually twined his fingers with Evelyn Carter's, hesitating briefly before speaking. "Leave Evelyn alone," he warned, his voice deceptively calm. "Touch her again, and I might just relieve you of those hands permanently."

With that, Alexander guided Evelyn away, leaving Ethan rooted in place. His vision blurred as he watched them disappear, his eyes burning with unshed emotion.

Vanessa Hart stood frozen on the staircase.

Her knuckles whitened around the railing. Every word exchanged between the three had reached her ears with painful clarity.

"Evelyn's luck is sickening," she muttered under her breath. "But Ethan—why does he look like that? Those red eyes... Is he actually regretting his choices?"

She wouldn’t allow it.

Ethan would not slip back into old feelings for Evelyn. Not while she was still breathing.

###Chapter 147 Silent Treatment

The sterile hospital lights reflected off the white tiles as Vanessa stepped out of the stairwell, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of her sleeve.

"Ethan, why did you take so long in the bathroom?" Her voice was soft, deliberately fragile.

The bandage wrapped around her forehead stood out starkly against her pale skin, a visible reminder of her "accident." The back of her hand, still red from the scalding water, peeked out from beneath her sleeve as she reached for him.

Ethan didn’t turn. His jaw was tight, his gaze distant, lost in thoughts she couldn’t decipher.

"Ethan, I know I messed up." A single tear slipped down her cheek—just enough to be convincing, not enough to ruin her makeup. "Please don’t shut me out like this."

She let her voice tremble, the perfect balance of regret and vulnerability.

"I shouldn’t have argued with you at Whitmore Manor. I’m sorry." Her lashes fluttered downward, another tear following the first.

Too much crying would make her look desperate. Too little, and it wouldn’t seem sincere. This was the exact right amount—just enough to tug at his guilt.

Vanessa counted silently in her head.

One… two… three…

On the fourth second, Ethan finally moved.

His fingers brushed against her damp cheeks, wiping away the tears.

Vanessa exhaled silently in relief before wrapping her arms around Ethan.

The way she embraced him was deliberate. She pressed her ear against his chest, close enough to hear the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, then tilted her head just enough for her silken hair to graze the vulnerable curve of his throat—a spot she knew made him shiver.

"I never wanted to fight with you," she murmured. "It's Evelyn. She swore she loved you, yet she married Alexander."

Vanessa studied Ethan's expression carefully. When his jaw tightened, she pressed on.

"I know it hurts you. It hurts me too. Everything between us fell apart because of her. This whole mess? She orchestrated it just to drive us apart."

Ethan's gaze flickered, restless. Seizing the moment, Vanessa slid her hands up to clasp behind his neck.

"If you pull away from me now, she wins, Ethan. We chose each other for a reason, didn't we?"

Silence stretched between them as Ethan absorbed her words.

Lately, Evelyn had dominated his thoughts, pulling his focus entirely toward her.

But Vanessa was his wife. The woman whose cello playing had pulled him back from the edge of darkness when he lay unconscious.

The evening air was thick with unspoken tension as Ethan Caldwell studied his wife carefully.

"At our wedding," he began, his voice measured, "your cello performance felt... different."

Vanessa Hart's fingers tightened imperceptibly around her wine glass before she forced a laugh. "Different how? It was the same piece I always play."

Ethan tilted his head, considering. "Technically flawless, yes. But it lacked the emotion you usually pour into it."

A practiced smile curved Vanessa's lips as she leaned closer. "Darling, it was our wedding day. Of course I was nervous!" She playfully nudged his shoulder. "You can't expect me to perform perfectly when my hands were shaking the entire time."

The explanation seemed to satisfy him. Ethan pulled her into a loose embrace, his doubts momentarily soothed.

But beneath her composed exterior, Vanessa's mind raced.

How did Evelyn Carter play it?

No matter how many hours she practiced, something always felt... wrong. Like she was chasing a ghost in the music.

When Evelyn finally found Claire Dawson, her best friend was sitting alone on a marble bench in the dimly lit corridor.

Claire's usually vibrant eyes were hollow, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap. She looked up as Evelyn approached, her expression shattering further.

"I don't know what to do," Claire whispered, her voice breaking.

Evelyn sat beside her, reaching for her friend's ice-cold hands. The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken fears.

"Where have you been? I've been searching everywhere for you." Evelyn's voice trembled with worry as she finally spotted Claire near the hospital corridor.

Claire's face was ghostly pale, her fingers clutching the strap of her bag so tightly her knuckles turned white. "I saw Lucas," she whispered. "He was carrying Isabella. They went into the doctor's office together."

Evelyn's expression darkened instantly, her grip tightening around her phone. "Where are they now?"

The fluorescent lights above flickered, casting long shadows across the sterile white walls. The distant hum of hospital machinery filled the silence between them, heavy with unspoken tension.

Claire swallowed hard, her voice barely audible. "I don't know. They disappeared down the hall. But Evelyn—" She hesitated, her eyes wide with dread. "Isabella looked... sick."

A cold knot formed in Evelyn's stomach. She had known Lucas for years—had trusted him. If he was hiding something, if he had lied to them...

She took a sharp breath. "We need to find them. Now."

Without another word, she turned on her heel, her heels clicking sharply against the tiled floor. Claire hurried after her, her heart pounding in her chest.

Something was wrong.

And Evelyn wasn't about to let it slide.
###Chapter 148 The Scheming Seductress

Claire gestured absently toward the hallway, and Evelyn immediately followed her direction.

Peering through the slightly ajar door, she saw exactly what Claire had described—Lucas and Isabella locked in an intimate embrace.

Isabella clung to Lucas’s waist, her shoulders shaking with dramatic sobs as she buried her face against his chest.

Lucas stood motionless, his hand stroking her back in slow, soothing circles while murmuring words of comfort.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. Even with the hospital staff bustling nearby, the scene felt painfully private.

Her stomach twisted. If she felt this sick watching, how must Claire be feeling?

Lucas had gone too far this time.

Evelyn turned away, her heels clicking sharply against the tile as she returned to the waiting area.

Claire sat curled in a chair, her face hidden against her knees. "He won’t answer my calls," she whispered, voice raw. "But he has time for her. I actually believed he was different now. How stupid am I?"

Her quiet devastation shattered Evelyn’s restraint.

She pulled Claire into a fierce hug, swallowing her own fury. "Don’t cry," she ordered gently, thumb brushing away a tear. "You’ll upset the baby."

The unspoken truth lingered between them—some betrayals cut deeper than others.

The slap came too fast for anyone to react.

Isabella gasped, her palm flying to her stinging cheek. Tears sprang to her eyes instantly, reddening them with practiced ease.

"Claire."

A vivid handprint bloomed across Isabella's delicate skin, the swelling already visible.

"Claire, have you lost your mind?" Lucas roared, shoving himself between them. His face twisted in disbelief. "Since when do you assault people like some deranged woman?"

Claire said nothing. Her fingers flexed, itching to strike again.

Actions speak louder than words.

Had she made a mistake? No. This deceitful viper deserved far worse.

Lucas seized her wrist in an iron grip. Claire struggled, but his hold was unbreakable.

Fury burned through her veins. She turned on Lucas instead, raining blows against his chest. "Filthy bastard! I gave you a chance! You threw it away! We're done—no arguments!"

"Claire, stop this hysterical nonsense!" Lucas snarled, his expression darkening.

Though the hospital corridor was nearly empty at this hour, the commotion drew curious stares from nearby visitors. Whispers spread like wildfire, painting the scene in humiliating shades.

Lucas's jaw tightened as he tried to explain. "Isabella twisted her ankle. I was just assisting her to the hospital. What's gotten into you? There's nothing going on between us!"

Claire crossed her arms, her eyes flashing with disbelief. "She needed your help for a twisted ankle? What are you, her personal knight in shining armor? Couldn't she just call an Uber?"

"How was she supposed to get into a car by herself if she could barely walk?" Lucas shot back, frustration creeping into his voice.

Claire scoffed. "Oh, please. I saw the way you two were clinging to each other. Don't tell me that was just 'helping.' You had your arms wrapped around her like she was about to collapse!"

"That's called supporting someone, not embracing them," Lucas snapped.

"Right," Claire drawled, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "And when your lips were practically glued to hers, was that just you helping her breathe too?"

Lucas's face darkened. "What the hell are you even saying? Claire Dawson, you're being completely irrational!"

The air between them crackled with tension, neither willing to back down.

What will happen next? Will Lucas manage to convince Claire of his innocence, or has Isabella's scheming already driven a wedge between them?

###Chapter 149 The Weight of Blame

Isabella rushed forward, her delicate hands cradling Claire's face. Tears welled up in her doe-like eyes.

"Claire, darling, this is entirely my doing," she whispered, voice trembling. "If only I hadn't twisted my ankle, Lucas would never have argued with you over me. I'm begging you - don't hold this against him."

Lucas yanked Isabella backward with sudden force, making her stumble against his chest. His jaw was set in that stubborn way Claire knew all too well.

"Stop blaming yourself," he snapped. "Accidents happen. You've got nothing to apologize for."

Claire felt the heat rise in her face until her vision blurred crimson. Her entire body trembled violently, fingers clutching at the hospital sheets.

Evelyn's strong grip anchored her before she could topple over. The concern in her best friend's eyes only made the humiliation worse.

"I can't..." Claire gasped, her voice barely audible. "Evelyn, get me out of here. Now."

Her complexion had turned ghostly pale, lips bloodless. Evelyn hesitated, torn between defending her friend and addressing the medical emergency.

"Let's get you to your room first," Evelyn decided, slipping an arm around Claire's waist. "You're in no state for this."

The moment they reached the private ward, Evelyn hit the call button. "Just breathe. I'm getting the doctor."

When the physician arrived, his expression darkened immediately after checking Claire's vitals. The deep frown lines between his brows spoke volumes.

The doctor's stern voice cut through the sterile hospital air. "We made it very clear—your emotions need to remain stable. Given your condition, you'll need to stay overnight for observation. No arguments."

Evelyn nodded in silent agreement, but Claire's voice was firm. "No. I don’t want to keep it. Doctor, I want to terminate the pregnancy. Schedule the procedure."

The doctor blinked in surprise. "Are you absolutely certain?"

Though it was a threatened miscarriage, the pregnancy wasn’t beyond saving. With proper rest, the situation could stabilize within a week or two.

Claire didn’t hesitate. "Yes. Can we do it tonight?"

"That’s not possible. The surgical wing is closed. If you’re resolute, I can arrange it for tomorrow morning."

"Fine. The sooner, the better."

As the doctor exited, the room fell into heavy silence.

Evelyn didn’t speak, but Claire knew the question hanging between them. "Don’t try to change my mind. After this, I’m filing for divorce. If Lucas refuses, I’ll take him to court."

"I wasn’t going to persuade you." Evelyn sat beside the bed, gently taking Claire’s hand. "I just… understand the pain."

Her heart ached for Claire and Lucas. Their turmoil mirrored what she and Alexander had endured—love twisted into something unrecognizable.

Claire’s fingers trembled slightly in hers. "I can’t bring a child into this mess. Not when the father is someone who—" Her voice cracked.

Evelyn squeezed her hand. "You don’t have to explain."

The weight of Claire’s decision pressed down on them both. Tomorrow would bring finality. And after that?

A new battle would begin.

The only difference was that Evelyn had walked away in time, while Claire and Lucas had not only married but brought a child into this mess.

Her chest tightened.

Now, the responsibility of terminating the pregnancy fell entirely on Claire’s shoulders. Why should she bear this pain alone?

Alexander called, his voice laced with impatience. "Why haven’t you left yet?"

The memory of Alexander’s friendship with Lucas flared Evelyn’s anger hotter.

"He’s outside the hospital, isn’t he?" she snapped. "Too busy tending to another woman while his wife suffers."

The words had barely left her lips when Alexander’s sharp inhale crackled through the phone.

"I see them."

Clutching her phone, Evelyn stormed to the window. Rage burned through her veins. "I won’t stand by and watch Claire drown in this alone."

Through the glass, Alexander’s distant figure blurred below.

"Alexander," she hissed, "Lucas may be your friend, but Claire is mine. If you dare stop me from putting my hands on him, consider our marriage over."

Silence.

Then, footsteps.

Lucas had reached Alexander.

The moment Alexander appeared, Lucas immediately abandoned Isabella and strode toward him.

"Alex, what a surprise seeing you here," Lucas remarked casually, already reaching into his pocket for his cigarette case.

Without warning, Alexander's fist connected with Lucas's face in a brutal punch.

From her vantage point, Evelyn couldn't make out the details clearly, but the sharp crack of impact echoed through the phone line. Lucas's enraged shout followed instantly.

"Goddamn it! You broke my nose!" Lucas roared, clutching his face as blood streamed between his fingers. "What the hell, Whitmore? That fucking hurts!"

His voice was thick with pain and fury, the metallic scent of blood sharp in the air.

Alexander remained silent, his expression unreadable, but the tension in his shoulders spoke volumes.

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

She had never seen Alexander lose control like this before.

Something was terribly wrong.

And somehow, she knew—this was all because of her.
###Chapter 150 What a Jerk

Alexander had spent more than ten years at the police academy, never missing a single day of combat training.

His punch sent Lucas reeling, vision blurring as he stumbled back.

Shaking out his fist, Alexander casually rested one hand on his hip and turned his back on Lucas.

Facing Evelyn, he said coolly, "I'm not stopping you. In fact, I'll help you beat him up. Come here. I'll pin him down, and you can hit him until you're satisfied."

Lucas was baffled.

What the hell? Alexander is hitting me to make Evelyn happy?

Evelyn blinked in shock. "Seriously?"

"As long as it makes you feel better, breaking his legs is fine by me," Alexander growled, shooting Lucas a murderous glare.

This bastard! His fight with Claire nearly cost me my marriage.

What a complete jerk!

He wasn’t about to let his hard-earned marriage—or the woman he treasured—walk away because of this idiot.

I couldn't believe Alexander would drag me into this mess because of that scoundrel!

Seeing Lucas was genuinely hurt, Evelyn immediately sent Isabella away.

Isabella had been sobbing, refusing to leave at first. But when she saw Evelyn actually grabbing something to storm downstairs, she finally listened to Lucas and bolted.

By the time Evelyn reached the lobby, Isabella was hobbling toward the hospital entrance.

But an injured woman couldn’t outrun someone at full strength.

Evelyn caught up in mere strides, yanking Isabella back by the arm.

Claire had followed Evelyn down.

Since she had no intention of keeping the baby anyway, she figured she might as well unleash her fury first.

"Where do you think you're running?" Evelyn snapped, shoving Isabella hard enough to send her crashing to the floor. "Didn’t I warn you? Playing the mistress never ends well."

Isabella turned teary eyes toward Lucas, pleading. "I’m not the other woman. Lucas knows that!"

Lucas wiped his nose with the back of his hand, his fingers coming away smeared with blood.

Alexander’s punch had been brutal. The bleeding just wouldn’t stop.

Lucas gave a stiff nod. "Right, she isn't the other woman."

"Bullshit!" Claire whipped out her phone, her fingers trembling with fury as she pulled up a photo. "If she's not the other woman, then explain this!"

The image showed Lucas fast asleep, his eyes shut, while Isabella lay draped across his chest.

The angle was deliberate—only their faces visible against what looked like rumpled sheets, the rest swallowed by darkness, leaving too much to the imagination.

Lucas's breath hitched. "What the hell is this? We never did this! This has to be fake!"

"Your little mistress sent it to me herself," Claire spat, her voice dripping with venom. "You think she'd fake that?"

She hurled the phone at him, and Lucas scrambled to catch it, his pulse roaring in his ears.

The timestamp read two months ago—right in the middle of their ugliest fight.

And the sender? Isabella’s number. His gaze snapped to her, suspicion darkening his expression.

Isabella paled, her hands fluttering nervously. "This—this is a misunderstanding! My phone was hacked around that time!"

Evelyn arched a brow, her lips curling into a cold smirk. "So you expect us to believe," she drawled, "that your conveniently hacked phone just happened to send that?"

The tension in the air was suffocating.

Evelyn crossed her arms, her gaze sharp as a blade. "Let me get this straight, Isabella. Your phone was hacked, and it just happened to photoshop intimate pictures of you and Lucas, then conveniently sent them to Claire?"

Isabella's face drained of color. "I—"

Evelyn scoffed, tilting her head. "What kind of phone is this? It’s practically sentient. Maybe I should get one too."

The truth was glaringly obvious.

Lucas had pieced it together—Isabella had set him up. His jaw tightened, anger simmering beneath the surface.

But despite everything, the memories of their past held him back from lashing out.

His eyes flickered toward Claire, but she refused to even glance his way.

As Claire stepped forward, Isabella flinched, throwing her hands over her head. "Claire, don’t hit me! Please, don’t!"

Her panic seemed genuine—until she suddenly lurched forward, crashing straight into Claire.

Behind Claire stood a stone bollard.

The force of the impact sent Claire stumbling back—

Her heel caught on the edge.

She was falling.

###Chapter 151 The Unexpected Rescue

The chaos unfolded in mere seconds, leaving no time for hesitation.

Vanessa stood closest to Claire when Isabella made her sudden, reckless charge. Every muscle in Vanessa's body tensed, her gaze locked onto Claire with protective intensity.

Just as Isabella was about to slam into Claire, instinct took over. Without a second thought, Vanessa threw herself toward the stone bollard.

Claire hadn’t even registered the obstacle behind her when Vanessa reached it first.

Vanessa’s arms shot out, wrapping around Claire from behind in a firm embrace. But the force sent her crashing backward, her lower back striking the unyielding stone with a sharp, jarring impact.

A gasp of pain escaped her lips as a cold sweat prickled across her skin.

She ignored the throbbing ache, her focus solely on Claire.

"Claire, are you hurt?"

Claire hadn’t fallen, thanks to Vanessa’s quick reflexes, but her face was ghostly pale, her breathing uneven.

"I—I’m okay," Claire managed, still trembling as she glanced at the bollard behind her.

Vanessa exhaled sharply, relief mingling with the lingering sting in her back.

Isabella, meanwhile, staggered back, her face twisted in shock—as if she hadn’t expected anyone to intervene.

The tension in the air was thick enough to cut.

Vanessa tightened her grip on Claire’s arm, her voice low but firm. "Let’s get you out of here."

Claire nodded shakily, her fingers curling around Vanessa’s sleeve like a lifeline.

But before they could move, Isabella’s voice cut through the silence, sharp and defiant.

"You think that’s enough to stop me?"

Vanessa’s jaw clenched.

She turned slowly, her eyes locking onto Isabella’s with a challenge.

"Try it again," she dared, her voice icy. "I dare you."

The consequences could have been catastrophic if she had fallen backward while looking up.

She had already made up her mind—she wasn’t keeping the baby. The surgery was scheduled.

But losing it due to an accident? That was an entirely different scenario.

If Evelyn hadn’t acted quickly, the fall—combined with her delicate condition—could have left her with lasting complications.

Claire, shaking with fury, locked eyes with Isabella. "You did that on purpose. How dare you?"

Isabella’s face paled, her voice trembling. "I—I didn’t mean to! I thought you were going to hit me! I just—"

Before she could finish, Evelyn’s hand struck her cheek with a sharp crack.

She lunged forward, gripping Isabella’s hair, her voice a venomous hiss. "If anything had happened to Claire, I would have destroyed you."

Claire couldn’t risk intervening—not in her condition.

And with Lucas standing right there, if she had retaliated and he had defended Isabella? The humiliation would have been unbearable.

So Evelyn took matters into her own hands.

This was her duty—to deal with the mistress on Claire’s behalf.

The sharp crack of the slap echoed through the room. Isabella clutched her stinging cheek, her eyes blazing with fury as she glared at Evelyn. "What the hell was that for? I told you it was an accident!"

"An accident?" Evelyn's voice dripped with disdain. "You expect anyone to believe that? You knew exactly what you were doing, Isabella."

Isabella's temper flared. "Claire is perfectly fine! How dare you hit me? I’m reporting this!"

"Go ahead. I dare you." Evelyn crossed her arms, her gaze unflinching. "With your pathetic acting skills, do you really think the police will fall for your lies? They’ll see right through you."

"Lucas," Isabella whimpered, turning to him with pleading eyes. "They’re bullying me again."

Evelyn had yanked her hair, forcing her into a humiliating bow in front of everyone. The shame burned hotter than the slap.

Lucas opened his mouth to speak, but then he caught Alexander’s icy glare—a silent warning. His words died in his throat.

He knew the truth. Isabella had deliberately shoved Claire. The realization sent a chill down his spine.

Thankfully, Claire was unharmed, and so was the baby.

"Just apologize, Isabella," Lucas said tightly. "Let’s end this now."

Claire’s breath hitched as she stared at Lucas in disbelief.

“An apology and that’s it? Since when do you decide what’s enough for me?”

His brows knitted together. “You’re unharmed, and Evelyn took the hit for you. Do you really want to escalate this? Claire, you’re smarter than this.”

A bitter laugh escaped her lips, her eyes glistening. “Unharmed? Only because Evelyn stepped in. What if she hadn’t been there?”

Her voice cracked. “You’re using logic to manipulate me into backing down. Or have you forgotten—I’m carrying your child, Lucas.”

The air between them thickened with unspoken accusations.

Claire’s fingers trembled as she wrapped her arms around herself, the weight of his indifference crushing her.

Lucas exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. “This isn’t about picking sides. It’s about not making things worse.”

“Worse?” She scoffed. “Funny how my pain is just an inconvenience to you.”

Isabella’s smug smirk from across the room burned in Claire’s periphery. The injustice of it all coiled tight in her chest.

Lucas reached for her, but she stepped back, her voice a whisper. “Don’t.”

The gala’s chandeliers blurred above them as silence stretched, brittle and suffocating.

Then, with deliberate calm, Claire lifted her chin. “Tell me, Lucas—if it were Evelyn in my place, would you still ask her to be sensible?”

His hesitation was all the answer she needed.

###Chapter 152 Make It Right With Claire

Claire stared at him, her heart sinking.

Lucas ran a hand through his hair in frustration. "Speculating like this won't solve anything. The baby is unharmed. You're unharmed. Dwelling on it only makes things worse. And Isabella—"

"Lucas, think before you speak!" Evelyn cut in sharply, her voice laced with warning.

She clenched her fists, thinking, This man is infuriating with his words.

"Claire is your wife," Evelyn continued, her tone icy. "Whose side are you even on? That woman doctored those photos to manipulate you and sabotage your marriage, yet you're still defending her. Have you lost your mind?"

She scoffed. "I thought anyone who could be friends with Alexander must have some sense. Clearly, I was wrong."

Her voice softened slightly, but the edge remained. "Have you even considered how Claire feels? She’s the one who was hurt, and instead of standing up for her, you're asking her to just get over it."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Do you think you're some kind of king who can have everything his way?"

Her eyes flashed with anger. "Why should she have to be the bigger person to excuse your hypocrisy? Claire owes you nothing."

Lucas Bennett, a well-known figure in Cresthaven, felt his cheeks flush with embarrassment as Evelyn Carter delivered her scathing remarks.

His eyes darted toward Alexander Whitmore. "Your wife is insulting me, and you're just going to stand there?"

Alexander met his gaze with icy indifference. "I agree with every word she said. If you can't even manage your own household, you have no business calling yourself my friend."

Lucas was stunned into silence.

Evelyn hadn't expected Alexander to openly back her up. Given the delicate nature of the situation, she thought he might remain neutral—but he had taken a firm stance without hesitation.

"You have two options," Alexander said, his piercing stare leaving no room for argument.

"Either make Isabella apologize, as Evelyn suggested, or consider our friendship over."

"Wait, Alexander, you can't be serious—"

Lucas tried to protest, but the dark look on Alexander's face silenced him instantly.

He knew their years of friendship weren't something Alexander would discard lightly.

More importantly, Lucas was fully aware that Claire Dawson had been deeply hurt by this entire ordeal.

The night air was thick with tension.

Claire's fury stemmed purely from her concern for their unborn child. Lucas wasn't truly defending Isabella—he simply wanted to avoid a public spectacle that would humiliate everyone involved.

"Isabella, apologize to Claire." Lucas's voice was firm, leaving no room for argument.

Isabella hesitated, her lower lip trembling. Evelyn finally released her grip, stepping back with visible disgust.

The damage was clear—two bright red handprints marred Isabella's cheeks, accompanied by thin, angry scratches. Her usually perfect blonde hair was tangled, strands sticking to her tear-streaked face.

With a shaky breath, Isabella flicked her gaze toward Lucas before muttering, "Claire... whether you believe me or not, I didn’t mean it. But I’ll apologize because I don’t want Lucas stuck in the middle of this! I’m sorry!"

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. Even now, she’s still trying to twist her words?

Without hesitation, Evelyn delivered a sharp kick to the back of Isabella’s knees, sending her crashing to the floor.

"Think very carefully about what you say next," Evelyn hissed, looming over her. "‘Don’t want Lucas stuck in the middle’? Who the hell do you think you are?"

"Mind your own business, you scheming little witch!"

Evelyn's sharp words cut through the air like a blade.

Isabella's face drained of color before flushing crimson with humiliation.

She hadn’t expected Evelyn to be so ruthless, not even bothering to maintain her composure in front of Lucas.

Doesn’t she care about how he sees her? Isabella thought bitterly. She’s acting like a wild animal!

But when Lucas made no move to defend her, Isabella’s stomach twisted with shame.

She clenched her fists, forcing the words out through gritted teeth. "Claire… I’m sorry."

Claire didn’t even glance her way, her expression icy.

Evelyn wasn’t finished.

"And those photos—you doctored them, didn’t you?" Her voice was dangerously calm. "You thought you could manipulate the situation, worm your way into his life while they were fighting?"

Isabella’s breath hitched.

She knows.

The realization sent a chill down her spine.

Evelyn leaned in, her gaze unrelenting.

"Did you really think no one would figure it out?"

Isabella swallowed hard, her pulse roaring in her ears.

She had no answer.

The silence stretched, thick with tension.

Then—

Lucas finally spoke.

His voice was quiet, but the disappointment in it cut deeper than any shout.

"Isabella."

Her stomach dropped.

This wasn’t how things were supposed to go.

Not at all.
###Chapter 153 Severed Bonds

Lucas shot Isabella a doubtful look.

The photo was clearly manipulated. He remembered dozing off on the private lounge's sofa after an exhausting poker game.

Someone must have snapped the picture then, but the room had been full of people. There was absolutely nothing between him and Isabella.

Noticing Lucas's hesitation, Isabella rushed to explain, "My phone was hacked! I swear I didn't know about this photo—"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Do you think Lucas is stupid? Or do you take the rest of us for fools?"

Isabella bit her lip and stayed silent.

Evelyn turned to Lucas, arms crossed. "The proof is right here. Every problem between you and Claire traces back to her. How are you going to fix this?"

Lucas glanced at Claire, then stepped toward her, reaching for her hand.

She recoiled as if burned.

"Don't touch me!" Claire spat, her voice trembling with disgust. "Just looking at you makes me sick!"

Claire's vision blurred with unshed tears, her chest tight with anguish and resolve. Lucas had crossed a line this time—one she couldn't overlook.

She brushed past him without a word, her heels clicking sharply against the hospital floor as she marched toward the ward. Lucas moved to follow, then halted, his gaze flickering to Isabella still lingering nearby.

Isabella clutched her leg, her voice trembling. "It hurts so much, Lucas. You can't just leave me here!"

Lucas didn't even look at her. "Call a cab."

Her lips quivered. "But my performance is in two days! You promised you'd be there!"

His expression hardened. "We're done."

Isabella's breath hitched. "What?"

The finality in his tone was unmistakable. He was cutting her off—completely.

Tears spilled down her cheeks. "After everything I did for you? How can you—"

Lucas lit a cigarette, the flame briefly illuminating his cold eyes. "Drop the act. You're the troupe's lead now. You've rubbed shoulders with half the industry because of me. Consider your debt paid."

The words hung between them, heavy and final. Isabella's sobs echoed down the hallway, but Lucas was already walking away, his silhouette swallowed by the sterile hospital lights.

Isabella's face drained of all color.

Nathan exhaled a cloud of smoke, his gaze icy. "You orchestrated this entire charade, chasing after something that was never yours to begin with. My mistake was letting you believe there was a chance—and hurting Claire in the process. It's time you accepted reality."

His words extinguished the last flicker of hope in Isabella's eyes.

With a curt nod toward Alexander and Evelyn, Nathan turned on his heel and strode back toward the hospital entrance.

Evelyn moved to follow, but Alexander caught her wrist.

"Give them space," he murmured.

She hesitated, worry gnawing at her. Claire had been through enough—what if Nathan made things worse?

Alexander squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Trust me. He might be stubborn, but he's not stupid."

Evelyn exhaled slowly. He was right. If Nathan were truly blind to his mistakes, he wouldn't have just cut ties with Isabella so decisively.

A bittersweet ache settled in Evelyn's chest as memories of their tangled past resurfaced.

Five years ago, Claire Dawson was the prima ballerina, the shining star of the dance company.

Isabella Rhodes had been nothing more than an understudy—a nameless newcomer with no hope of ever taking the spotlight.

That night, Claire had planned to confess her love to Lucas Bennett.

But fate had other plans.

Moments before her performance, she collapsed backstage, struck by a sudden, debilitating illness.

Her confession was left unspoken, and Isabella was thrust onto the stage in her place.

Then, disaster struck.

A rigging malfunction sent heavy stage equipment crashing toward Lucas.

Isabella didn’t hesitate.

She shoved him out of the way, taking the full impact herself.

The injury left her hospitalized for weeks.

From that day forward, Lucas treated her differently—softer, gentler, indebted.

The cruel irony?

Two years later, history repeated itself.

During a solo performance, Claire fell from a great height, shattering her leg.

She and Lucas had just married.

Doctors insisted she recover overseas, far from the pressures of the stage.

But the damage was permanent.

Claire would never dance again.

And Isabella?

She stepped into Claire’s role—and never let it go.
###Chapter 154 Reckless Passion

Evelyn often caught herself thinking, If only Claire hadn't come down with that fever five years ago—the day she was supposed to confess to Lucas—maybe Isabella would never have slipped into her place.

But life was a cruel architect of almosts and could-have-beens.

Some souls were destined to drift apart from the very beginning.

Just like her and Ethan. Seven years of chasing, seven years of heartache—and what did she have to show for it?

"Mrs. Whitmore."

Alexander's voice sliced through her thoughts, sharp as a blade. His jaw tightened. "Are you thinking about him again?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to reply, but Alexander was already gripping her wrist, pulling her into the sleek black car.

The door slammed shut, sealing them in the dim, intimate space.

Her breath hitched as Alexander's hands moved with purpose, his fingers working at the buttons of her blouse.

The leather seat pressed cold against her back as he leaned in, his gaze dark with possession.

Her pulse roared in her ears.

There was no hesitation, no gentleness—only raw, reckless need.

And Evelyn?

She didn’t dare stop him.

Evelyn's breath hitched as Alexander's imposing figure loomed over her.

"What... what are you doing?" she stammered, instinctively pressing back against the car door.

The cold metal met her spine, leaving no room for escape.

"Take off your pants," Alexander ordered, his voice rough with restrained urgency.

Her pulse skyrocketed.

Is he seriously considering this right here?

Heat flooded her cheeks as her muscles locked in shock.

The parking lot might be nearly empty, but it's still public! This is insane!

Before she could voice her protest, strong arms pulled her flush against his chest.

Her lungs burned with each shallow breath.

Noticing her tension, Alexander's lips curved into a knowing smirk. His fingers traced slow circles along her hipbone, igniting sparks beneath her skin.

He tightened his hold, his gaze darkening with something deeper than desire.

"Why didn't you tell me you were hurt?"

The raw concern in his voice shattered her defenses.

Evelyn blinked.

Injury?

Then she remembered—the stumble during tonight's gala, the sharp pain she'd hidden beneath her gown.

Alexander's palm slid down her thigh with deliberate gentleness, stopping just above the concealed bruise.

"You think I wouldn't notice?" His thumb brushed the tender spot, making her gasp. "Every flinch. Every hesitation."

Her lips parted, but no words came.

The domineering CEO who commanded boardrooms with an iron will now cradled her like fragile glass.

The contradiction stole her breath.

"Always so stubborn," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her temple. "My reckless wife."

The parking lot's fluorescent lights haloed his sharp features as he reached into the glove compartment.

A first-aid kit landed in his palm with a soft thud.

Evelyn's embarrassment flared anew.

He just wanted to treat my injury?

Alexander arched a brow at her crimson face. "What did you think I meant, Evelyn?"

The wicked glint in his eyes said he knew exactly what she'd assumed.

Her mortified groan echoed through the Bentley as he peeled back her stocking with surgeon-like precision.

"Next time," his breath warmed her inner knee, "scream if you're in pain."

The double entendre hung between them.

Somewhere beyond the tinted windows, a car alarm blared.

But in this suspended moment, there was only his touch, his scent, and the terrifying realization—

No locked door or crowded room could shield her from this man.

Not when he could unravel her with a glance.

Not when every wound, seen or unseen, called him like a beacon.

The antiseptic stung as he dabbed at her scrape.

Evelyn barely felt it.

Not with Alexander's other hand splayed possessively across her bare thigh.

Not with the promise in his whisper—

"We'll continue this at home."

Evelyn gasped in surprise.

Her mind raced. Is Alexander undressing me to examine my injury?

How does he know I'm hurt? I didn't even realize it myself.

Alexander pulled her gently against his chest.

A dark bruise stretched across her lower back where she had slammed into the curb. His fingers traced the tender skin with featherlight touches, his worry evident.

"Let me take you to a doctor," he murmured, voice soft but insistent.

Evelyn shook her head. "It's just a bruise. Nothing serious. Some ointment will do. No need for a doctor."

A teasing smirk curled his lips. "Why are you blushing so hard?"

Did you think I had other intentions?

Heat flooded her cheeks. Ugh, even if you know, don't say it out loud!

"I wasn't planning anything... but now..." His throat worked as he swallowed hard, his gaze darkening with unmistakable hunger.

The car was swallowed by shadows, the only light the silver glow of the moon illuminating their faces.

Alexander's unfinished words hung between them, thick with unspoken promise.

What on earth is he planning? Evelyn's thoughts raced as Alexander's warm breath fanned across her face, his intense gaze locking onto hers.

She found herself sprawled across his lap, her neck cradled in the crook of his arm. The position sent a shiver down her spine, her pulse quickening.

With deliberate slowness, Alexander lifted the hem of her blouse, his fingers tracing the tender skin of her injured waist. His touch was bold yet impossibly gentle, igniting a fiery tingle that spread through her lower back.

Evelyn's breath hitched, her mind flashing back to earlier that evening—when Alexander had pinned her to the bed, their bodies tangled in a fierce, desperate embrace. The memory alone made her skin flush.

His thumb brushed over a particularly sensitive spot, and she bit her lip to stifle a gasp.

This man…

He knew exactly what he was doing.

And she was utterly at his mercy.
###Chapter 155 Too Eager

Her knees trembled slightly, betraying the sudden rush of nerves coursing through her.

The air between them crackled with tension, thick and undeniable.

Evelyn swallowed hard, pressing her palms against Alexander’s chest as she whispered, “Alexander… do you want to kiss me?”

A slow, knowing smile curved his lips, his eyes glinting with mischief.

Before he could respond, she squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable.

Her thoughts raced. Tonight, Alexander surprised me. Not only did he rush Claire to the hospital, but he also put Lucas in his place.

A kiss isn’t too much to ask, right?

She waited, heart pounding—but nothing happened.

Confused, she blinked her eyes open. “Is something wrong?”

Alexander arched a brow, his smirk deepening. “Mrs. Whitmore, aren’t you being a little impatient?”

Evelyn’s cheeks burned crimson, the heat of her embarrassment impossible to hide.

Alexander didn’t miss the opportunity. He leaned in, his lips grazing the delicate shell of her ear, his warm breath sending shivers down her spine.

"Hold on, darling," he murmured, voice thick with promise. "We’ll save this for home. If I kiss you now, I won’t stop… and I’d hate to have you moaning my name in the backseat before we even get there."

Her pulse skyrocketed, her skin tingling at the sinful suggestion in his words.

Seriously? Again?

Hadn’t they just—hours ago?

And now he was already hungry for more?

Later, as Alexander drove, Evelyn stole glances at him from the passenger seat.

His fingers curled lazily around the steering wheel as the car took a smooth turn. The golden glow of the setting sun painted his sharp jawline, making his already devastating features even more striking.

When his gaze flicked to hers, there was a slow, knowing smirk playing on his lips—a look so effortlessly seductive it made her breath catch.

She couldn’t look away.

Not when he looked at her like that.

The car pulled out of the hospital parking lot, tires crunching over gravel. A sharp gust of wind sliced through the air, catching Ethan Caldwell’s attention.

He had been pacing in the shadows, restless after a sleepless night.

Then he saw them.

Alexander Whitmore guided Evelyn Carter into the back seat with a possessive hand at her waist. Ethan stiffened, his breath hitching.

But he didn’t move.

He watched, jaw clenched, as Alexander settled Evelyn onto his lap. Their bodies pressed close, fingers tangling, a quiet murmur passing between them.

Ethan’s pulse spiked when Alexander leaned in, tilting Evelyn’s chin up—only for her to duck away, her cheeks flushing.

A slow, relieved exhale escaped him.

She’s not into him.

Evelyn was just clinging to Alexander for security. Otherwise, why would she shy from his kiss?

It made perfect sense. Alexander was nearly thirty—practically ancient compared to Evelyn’s youth.

And she had always preferred him.

The tension in Ethan’s chest unraveled.

The tension in Evelyn's shoulders melted away like morning mist.

She exhaled deeply, feeling lighter than she had in weeks.

Alexander's words echoed in her mind, sharp and bitter. "Their marriage is a farce. Uncle Nathan's deluding himself!"

The sleek black sedan pulled up outside a 24-hour pharmacy near Memorial Hospital.

Alexander stepped out, his polished shoes clicking against the pavement. "Wait here," he murmured before disappearing behind the automatic doors.

Evelyn leaned back against the buttery leather seats, watching pedestrians hurry past.

A sudden screech of tires shattered the afternoon calm.

Her head snapped toward the commotion three blocks down. Flashing lights painted the buildings red and blue, but the distance obscured details.

Probably another fender bender, she thought absently.

When Alexander returned with a paper bag of medical supplies, they took the long way around the accident scene.

Through the tinted windows, Evelyn caught glimpses of paramedics working over a figure on the asphalt. The crowd swallowed the view before she could process it.

Whitmore Manor welcomed them with its usual quiet grandeur.

Alexander's hands were surprisingly gentle as he helped her with the ointment. The burn stretched across her shoulder blades where her fingers couldn't reach.

"I may not have a medical degree," he said, his breath warm against her neck, "but I've patched up enough rugby injuries to know what I'm doing."

His touch was methodical, almost clinical, yet something in his voice made her pulse stutter.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

For the first time since the gala, she allowed herself to hope.
###Chapter 156 Beneath His Control

A sudden memory flashed through Evelyn's mind—Simon's earlier revelation about Alexander's past.

Alexander had been cast out by the Whitmore family mere months after his birth. For years, he had survived in a run-down shed, enduring relentless torment and scorn.

Her chest tightened at the thought.

Even after joining the police academy, he must have suffered so much.

How else would he have mastered such precise methods for treating injuries?

A surge of emotion overwhelmed her.

Alexander had shown her nothing but kindness, and she had no way to repay him.

The moment the ointment was applied, she turned and threw her arms around him.

Evelyn tangled her fingers in his dark hair, pulling him closer as she pressed her lips to his in a kiss that was both hesitant and desperate.

His breath hitched, his grip tightening on her waist.

"Evelyn," he growled, voice rough with restraint. "Do you have any idea what you're doing?"

She nodded, her pulse racing as she deepened the kiss.

Alexander's control was unraveling—and she didn't care.

Her mind raced with panic. What am I doing?

I'm practically throwing myself at him!

He wanted this in the car, didn't he? I saw it in his eyes.

Her uncertain kisses only fueled his desire, and Alexander's restraint shattered.

He hadn't intended to take Evelyn tonight.

For one, she was still recovering from her injuries—hardly in any condition for this. And two, they hadn’t even eaten after everything that had happened.

But with her pressed against him, warm and willing, resistance was impossible.

Alexander leaned in, his kiss deep and commanding as he claimed her lips, guiding her back onto the plush sofa.

"Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured against her mouth, "since you're so eager… forgive me."

It didn’t take long for Evelyn to understand why he had apologized.

She had expected something quick, something straightforward.

Instead, he was agonizingly patient.

By the time he was finished, regret had already settled in.

She had wanted to give herself to him—not be utterly wrecked by him.

Her knees nearly gave way as she pushed herself up from the couch, every muscle quivering.

Alexander didn't allow her a moment's respite. In one swift motion, he lifted her and carried her back to the bed for another intense session.

Evelyn's skin burned with a rosy flush, her body shimmering with perspiration.

The former police academy instructor seemed to possess inexhaustible energy.

Alexander was particularly obsessed with the delicate arch of her waist. With a firm grip, he flipped her over, pinning her beneath him.

This time, he showed no mercy whatsoever.

His lips trailed down her spine like wildfire, and Evelyn's fingers twisted into the sheets, her knuckles turning white.

Pleasure crashed over her in relentless waves, forcing her to arch against him, gasping.

She lost count of how many times he took her. By the time he finally released her, the first light of dawn was creeping through the curtains.

Alexander was ruthless—domineering, possessive, and utterly insatiable.

Her throat was raw, every swallow like swallowing embers.

Exhausted, she lay with her eyes closed, vowing silently to never let herself fall into such reckless passion again.

This was overwhelming.

Evelyn's thoughts raced. I need to find a way to sleep separately from Alexander. How does anyone endure this every single night?

If he hadn’t stopped when she pleaded, she was certain he would’ve continued until sunrise.

It’s already morning, for heaven’s sake. I feel like I’ve been run over by a truck.

The next morning, the shrill beep of her alarm jolted Evelyn awake.

She had barely managed two hours of sleep, and now the clock taunted her—9:00 AM.

Alexander had already left for work while she was still lost in exhaustion.

Before slipping out, he had brushed his lips against her cheek, murmuring, "Take two days off. I’ll approve your leave."

Evelyn groaned into her pillow. This man is relentless.

How did he have the energy to function after last night? Let alone stride into the office without a second thought?

At the time, she had been too dazed to form a coherent response.

Now, as she lay tangled in the sheets, frustration warred with reluctant amusement.

I’m an executive in the CEO’s office. And yet...

Her thoughts trailed off as she buried her face deeper into the pillow, willing sleep to reclaim her.

But the memory of Alexander’s possessive grip and the way he had whispered her name sent a shiver down her spine.

She exhaled sharply.

This is going to be a problem.
###Chapter 157 Keep the Baby

The message had come in the dead of night—Claire needed her.

Evelyn barely slept, tossing until dawn. The moment sunlight crept through her curtains, she dressed in a hurry and hailed the first cab she saw.

Lucas Bennett looked like he'd been through hell when she arrived.

Dark shadows bruised his eyes. His jaw was rough with stubble, his clothes wrinkled from hours in that stiff hospital chair.

Claire wasn't faring much better. Though she'd slept, the imprint of the stiff hospital pillow still creased her cheek.

Lucas hadn't left her side all night.

The doctors had admitted her for complications—her pregnancy was unstable, the threat of miscarriage looming.

He'd only learned the truth when he rushed here. Guilt gnawed at him, vicious and relentless. While she'd been in pain, he'd been out playing poker like some careless fool.

So even though Claire refused to speak to him, even though her silence was sharper than any words, he stayed.

She'd managed a few restless hours of sleep near dawn.

But Lucas hadn't closed his eyes once.

The night had been long, but Lucas hadn't slept a wink.

When Evelyn arrived, Lucas stepped back to give her room.

"Claire, are you hungry? I'll grab you something to eat." With that, Lucas walked out.

As he left, Evelyn took Claire's hand gently. "How are you holding up?"

Claire forced a weak smile. "It's almost funny. Last night, he sat by my bed, pouring out his regrets. The irony isn't lost on me. All I can picture is how fiercely he used to defend Isabella."

Her smile faltered as tears pooled in her eyes.

Evelyn handed her a tissue, dabbing at her cheeks softly. "After you left last night, Lucas swore he'd never see Isabella again."

Claire shook her head. "It doesn't matter to me anymore."

Evelyn's eyes dropped to Claire's stomach. "Still going through with it? If Lucas finds out, he'll try to stop you."

If Evelyn remembered correctly, Claire's termination procedure was set for ten o'clock.

Lucas likely had no idea, assuming Claire was only here to monitor the pregnancy.

Evelyn glanced at the wall clock—less than twenty minutes remained.

The surgery was scheduled in fifteen minutes, which meant Lucas had only five minutes left to change Claire's mind.

As they spoke, Lucas returned with takeout.

"The hospital cafeteria options are limited. Eat something now, and once you're discharged, tell me what you're craving. I'll have it prepared for you."

He set the containers in front of Claire.

The moment she caught sight of the food, her stomach turned violently.

Lucas tensed, immediately pulling the food away and rubbing her back in concern.

"There's something I need to tell you," Claire blurted out.

Evelyn hesitated, sensing the gravity of the conversation. She quietly excused herself, shutting the door behind her.

"Go on," Lucas urged, his focus entirely on Claire.

"I've decided to—"

His phone rang abruptly.

He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening before silencing the call. "Ignore that. Continue."

Claire inhaled deeply. "I'm going to—"

The phone rang again, cutting through the tense silence. Lucas Bennett's jaw tightened visibly, his fingers gripping the device with barely concealed frustration.

Noticing the unfamiliar number flashing across the screen, he exhaled sharply. "One moment," he muttered, stepping away without another glance.

Claire Dawson settled deeper into the pillows, her gaze steady as she tracked his retreating figure. The door clicked shut behind him, sealing her in quiet solitude.

Outside, Lucas braced one hand against the corridor wall, his posture rigid. The phone pressed to his ear, his other hand resting on his hip in clear agitation.

Evelyn Carter lingered nearby, close enough to catch fragments of the conversation—thanks to the speaker's volume.

Her fingers curled into the fabric of her dress as she strained to listen.

###Chapter 158 Retribution

Evelyn's mind raced as she processed the fragmented words—"Isabella," "car crash," "broken bones," "operation," "consent."

It clicked instantly. Isabella had been in an accident, suffered fractures, and now required emergency surgery. Somehow, the call had reached Lucas.

Lucas's jaw tightened, his expression darkening with concern.

Evelyn caught his gaze just as he ended the call.

"I need to go to orthopedics," Lucas said, already moving. "I'll be back soon. Stay with Claire."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Last night, you swore you'd never see her again."

"That was the plan," he admitted, frustration lacing his voice. "But Isabella's alone in Cresthaven. She saved my life once. I can't just abandon her now when she needs someone to sign those forms."

His reasoning was solid, leaving Evelyn no room to argue.

She nodded. "Fine. Go."

Lucas hesitated, glancing toward the breakfast tray. "I got food for Claire. Make sure she eats. I'll be back within the hour."

"Please take good care of her until then."

Lucas Bennett's words lingered in the air as Evelyn Carter watched him stride away.

Half an hour.

Claire Dawson's surgery would likely be finished by then.

Evelyn remained silent, her gaze fixed on Lucas until he vanished around the corner. Only then did she push open the hospital room door.

Claire seemed to have expected this.

When Lucas didn’t follow after the call, she didn’t ask questions. Her eyes held a quiet understanding, a resigned calm that made Evelyn’s chest tighten.

Just then, a nurse entered. "Miss Dawson, it’s time to prepare for surgery."

Evelyn bit her lip, helping Claire to her feet. Her heart ached as she studied her best friend’s pale face.

Claire doesn’t deserve this.

Lucas, that bastard. I wish I could tear him apart with my bare hands.

Claire reached up, brushing away a tear from the corner of Evelyn’s eye. "It’s my abortion," she murmured. "Why are you crying?"

She forced a weak smile. "I checked with the doctor. The procedure is quick—just five minutes. No recovery time needed. I’ll be able to leave right after."

Her voice softened. "Once it’s over, I’m taking you out. We’re having a night on the town."

Evelyn swallowed hard, squeezing Claire’s hand.

Five minutes.

Five minutes to erase something that should have been precious.

And Lucas—where was he? Off somewhere, pretending this wasn’t his responsibility.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists.

Retribution would come.

But not today.

Today, she would be strong for Claire.

The sun was setting over Cresthaven, casting long shadows across the hospital corridor.

Claire Dawson laughed, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she squeezed Evelyn Carter's hand.

"Once the divorce is finalized and I get my share of Alexander's fortune, we're throwing the wildest party this town has ever seen!" she declared, tossing her hair over her shoulder. "We'll hire twenty male models, line them up by the pool, and make sure Alexander hears every detail. I'll put it all on his black card!"

Evelyn grinned, shaking her head. "You're terrible."

Claire winked. "No, darling. I'm just getting started. With that kind of money, I'll buy the penthouse above his and throw rooftop parties every weekend. Let's see how he likes the noise."

With that, Claire strode confidently into the operating room, still laughing.

Evelyn lingered outside, arms crossed, when Lucas Bennett reappeared, pushing Isabella Rhodes in a wheelchair.

An IV drip hung from the stand beside her, and Lucas clutched a stack of medical forms, signing them hastily.

The doctor adjusted his glasses. "If rehabilitation goes well, she may walk again in six weeks. But given Ms. Rhodes' profession…" He hesitated. "I'm afraid her dancing career is over."

Evelyn's lips curled.

Karma.

Isabella burst into sobs.

"Three years!" she cried, her voice breaking. "Three years of training, of fighting for the lead role—and now it's gone. What am I supposed to do now?"

In the ruthless world of dance, youth was currency. And hers had just been stolen.

The entertainment industry was ruthless.

New stars emerged every season, sprouting like wildflowers in spring.

In an agency with hundreds of aspiring talents, only a handful ever rose to the top.

Isabella's entire family had pinned their hopes on her success. She had clawed her way up, using Lucas Bennett's connections to secure her position.

But fate had other plans.

A single car crash last night had shattered her dreams.

Now, her career hung by a thread.

Isabella clutched at Lucas' sleeve, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "Lucas," she whispered, voice trembling. "I heard there are specialists overseas—world-class surgeons who can fix this. Will you... will you come with me?"

Her fingers tightened around the fabric of his jacket, desperate.

She couldn't lose everything. Not like this.

###Chapter 159 Come Out!

Isabella's face was a portrait of sheer terror. Her lips quivered violently, and her fingers twisted together in a white-knuckled grip. It was as if she was being swallowed whole by an abyss of paralyzing dread.

Lucas's eyes drifted from Isabella's anguished expression to some distant point behind her, his gaze piercing through her like she was made of glass.

His mind raced with thoughts.

"Was Claire this terrified when she shattered her leg in that horrific crash years ago?

How did she even manage to navigate conversations while recovering alone in a foreign country?

She’s nothing like Isabella.

Claire is the kind who swallows her pain in silence rather than drawing attention to it.

Did she ever lock herself away and weep? Did she ever feel utterly abandoned?

I wasn’t there for her when she needed me most.

She must despise me for that."

Just then, Isabella suddenly clutched her head between her hands and broke into desperate, choking sobs.

"Isabella, stop this. We need to talk." Lucas's voice was firm yet distant. "Will you consider getting treatment overseas? If you push me away now, what future do you have left?"

Her grip on his sleeve tightened. "Please, don't shut me out. Just... give me this one chance."

The medical expenses were astronomical. Without Lucas's support, Isabella knew she stood no chance.

His silence stretched until her desperate plea finally broke through.

Lucas exhaled sharply, his expression hardening. "Focus on the surgery first. We'll figure out the rest after."

Relief flooded her.

After. That meant he hadn't completely given up on her.

The accident had been devastating, but if it bought her Lucas's sympathy, perhaps it wasn’t a total loss.

Losing the lead dancer role paled in comparison to losing him.

As long as she could keep him close, nothing else mattered.

Then Lucas froze.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn, sitting quietly on a bench nearby.

Surprise flickered in his eyes before he strode toward her.

"What are you doing here?" His voice was rough with disbelief. "Shouldn't you be with Claire?"

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Evelyn gestured toward the sealed operating room doors. "Claire's in there."

Lucas froze, his breath catching. "Inside the OR? What the hell is she doing in there?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, refusing to answer.

Beside them, Isabella tilted her head, feigning concern. "Could it be... something's wrong with the baby?"

The words struck Lucas like a physical blow. His pulse skyrocketed, and suddenly, he couldn't stand still. He raked a hand through his hair, pacing like a caged animal.

"Something's wrong? Why wouldn't she tell me?"

Then—it hit him.

His face drained of color. His hands shook violently.

Before anyone could stop him, he lunged for the doors, slamming his palms against them with enough force to rattle the frame. "Claire! Get out here right now! Don't you dare—don't you dare touch our baby! Open this door! NOW!"

His outburst drew shocked stares from nearby patients and staff.

A nurse rushed over, her voice sharp with authority. "Sir, this is a restricted area! Lower your voice immediately, or I will have security escort you out."

Lucas didn’t respond. His crimson eyes burned with desperation, his entire body trembling.

"Claire, please! Open the door! We can fix this!" His voice broke, raw with emotion. "I know you're furious. I messed up—I know I did! Just let me explain!"

The thought of Claire going through with the termination made his chest tighten unbearably.

He understood what it meant.

It meant she had given up on him. On them. Their marriage, their future—all of it, gone in an instant.

The realization hit him like a sledgehammer, crushing the air from his lungs. An invisible weight pressed down on him, making it impossible to breathe.

Lucas slammed his fists against the operating room door, his knuckles turning white. Silence answered him.

"Claire, I'm begging you!" His voice echoed through the sterile hallway, drawing shocked glances from nurses and patients alike. He ignored them all, his focus solely on the woman behind that door.

"One more chance. That's all I ask!"

His words hung in the air, unanswered.

The seconds stretched into eternity.

Then—nothing.

Lucas's entire world narrowed to that single door.

###Chapter 160

Every fiber of his being screamed to break it down, to snatch Claire from that sterile room and crush her against his chest.

How could she even contemplate this?

Their child—their flesh and blood—how could she consider ending its life?

His mind reeled.

Doesn't she love me?

If she does, how could she destroy what we made together?

"Claire!" His voice shattered the clinic's quiet. "Don't do this! The baby hasn't done anything wrong! You can't be this cruel—stop the procedure!"

Nearby, Isabella trembled in her wheelchair, her face ashen.

Her thoughts spiraled.

Claire wants an abortion?

Is she insane?

This isn't how you keep a man—this is how you lose him forever.

Then, ice flooded her veins.

What if Lucas blames me?

Panic clawed at her throat.

The sterile hospital lights burned Isabella Rhodes' eyes as she lifted her gaze to meet Dr. Harrison Wells'. Her voice trembled with desperation.

"Dr. Wells, please—just take me to the operating room now."

Harrison hesitated, his brow furrowing.

"But your boyfriend hasn't signed the consent forms."

When Isabella had arrived at the hospital, she had been alone. Harrison had asked about family, and she had assured him Lucas Bennett would come.

And he had.

But now, Harrison watched in confusion as Lucas stood outside, begging another woman not to terminate her pregnancy.

What kind of twisted relationship is this?

Isabella's panic surged. "Harrison, I can sign the forms myself! Just get me in there!"

Evelyn Carter saw the fear in Isabella's eyes—the way she clutched the armrests of the wheelchair, ready to bolt.

With a cold smirk, Evelyn stepped forward and kicked the wheelchair.

The impact sent Isabella crashing to the floor. Her body, already weakened from recent fractures, couldn't break her fall. She hit the ground hard, pain lancing through her.

She couldn't move.

Terror clawed at her throat as Evelyn loomed over her, heels clicking against the tile.

"You're not going anywhere," Evelyn murmured.

Isabella's breath came in shallow gasps.

She was trapped.

"What... what do you want?" Isabella Rhodes choked out, her voice trembling with fear.

The terror she felt for Evelyn Carter ran bone-deep. Just last night, Evelyn had dragged her by the hair and struck her so viciously that the bruises still throbbed across her face.

Evelyn stared down at her with eyes like ice.

"Claire lost her baby. Don’t you think it’s time you paid for that?"

Isabella scrambled for excuses, her words frantic. "She chose to get rid of it—that wasn’t my fault! You can’t pin this on me!"

A cruel smirk curled Evelyn’s lips as she stepped closer.

Without warning, she brought her foot down on Isabella’s injured legs—hard.

A scream ripped through the hospital hallway, raw and piercing. Isabella writhed, her body convulsing in agony.

Sweat beaded on her forehead, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

Blood bloomed through the bandages, staining them crimson before dripping onto the sterile white floor.

In that moment, Isabella was certain she’d been dragged into hell itself.

Evelyn is a monster.
###Chapter 161 Vanished

Lucas jolted awake with a gasp. His body tensed as his gaze dropped to Claire’s abdomen, his hand instinctively reaching out.

"Claire, the baby—"

She was barely five weeks along. Her stomach showed no signs yet, still perfectly flat.

There was no way to tell just by looking.

Claire didn’t spare him a glance. She walked past him, cold and detached, as if he were nothing more than a stranger.

Lucas stood frozen for a heartbeat before whirling around, his voice rough. "Claire?"

Silence.

At that moment, Evelyn spotted her.

She immediately abandoned Isabella, who was barely clinging to consciousness, and rushed to Claire’s side.

"What do you want to eat? I’ll get you anything."

Claire hadn’t eaten since last night. The nausea had been relentless, and now—

The surgery had taken hours, and Evelyn knew Claire must be starving by now.

After a brief hesitation, Claire grinned. "If you're paying, let's go all out! Your husband's loaded anyway!"

Since switching to modeling, Claire had been surviving on salads and protein shakes.

But today was special.

A fresh start deserved a proper celebration.

Evelyn linked arms with her. "Perfect. Let's head out now—should beat the dinner rush."

Just as they turned to leave, Lucas suddenly stepped in front of them.

His eyes were bloodshot, his voice raw. "Why are you avoiding me, Claire? What about our baby?"

Claire's reply was ice. "Gone."

Lucas staggered back as if struck. Tears welled in his eyes, spilling over.

"You—how could you?" His voice cracked. "That was our child. How could you just—"

Claire cut him off. "Because I chose to. My body, my choice. What's it to you?"

The words sliced through him like a blade.

The thought struck him like a physical blow—How did we end up here?

"Claire, how could you do this?"

His voice cracked. "How could you just—without even telling me—"

Claire's finger trembled as she pointed at Isabella, still crumpled on the floor, her face twisted in pain. "I was going to tell you. But you left. The moment she called, you walked away."

Lucas froze. "So that's what you wanted to say? That you were going to—" His throat closed around the word.

"Yes." Her stare was glacial, cutting through him like winter wind. "I gave you a chance, Lucas."

A cold sweat prickled down his spine. The realization hit him like a tidal wave—drowning him in regret.

She had given him a chance.

If he had stayed. If he had listened instead of rushing off at Isabella's beck and call—

He could have stopped this.

But he hadn't.

He'd chosen her over Claire.

Now, the consequences wrapped around him like chains—pain, confusion, helplessness, all twisting tighter until he couldn't breathe.

Lucas's vision blurred, his arms hanging uselessly by his sides. He couldn’t bring himself to meet Claire’s gaze again.

The realization crashed over him like a tidal wave.

This is all my fault. Every single bit of it.

The doctor wasn’t responsible. The machines weren’t to blame.

I was.

His endless wavering, his failure to set boundaries with other women—that was what had destroyed everything.

Claire watched him with icy detachment.

Once, she had loved him with every fiber of her being. Now, there was nothing left.

"Are you finished?" Her voice was steady, devoid of emotion. "If you are, step aside."

No matter how thick the operating room doors were, they couldn’t muffle Lucas’s desperate cries.

As Claire lay on the table, she could hear his fists pounding against the door, his voice breaking as he begged.

The surgeon hesitated, glancing at her. "Your husband is outside. Are you certain about this? Marriage is complicated. Have you two tried talking it through properly?"

Claire almost laughed.

Reconsider?

She had given him chance after chance.

Lucas had squandered every single one.

That was the breaking point.

Some people refuse to wake up, no matter how hard you shake them.

When they choose to stay blind, the only thing left to do is walk away.

###Chapter 162  Lose Her

The air was thick with tension, suffocating.

Evelyn Carter stood frozen in the doorway, her fingers tightening around the strap of her bag.

She had given everything—her heart, her trust, her loyalty.

And still, it wasn’t enough.

Alexander Whitmore’s voice echoed in her mind, sharp and final.

"If you can't wake someone who's pretending to be asleep, you have to learn to cut your losses."

Her chest ached, but she refused to let the tears fall.

Not here.

Not now.

She turned on her heel and walked out, the door clicking shut behind her like a death sentence.

The hallway stretched endlessly before her, cold and empty.

Just like her future.

But she wouldn’t look back.

Not this time.

Because some battles weren’t worth fighting.

And some people weren’t worth saving.

The baby was gone.

Was she heartbroken?

Of course she was. That tiny life had been part of her, growing inside her. How could she not feel like her soul had been torn apart?

But she also knew—this was the consequence of her choices. That child might never have wanted to be born into this mess.

And more than anything, she refused to let Lucas Bennett be its father.

Claire’s grief ran deeper than sorrow. It was a quiet, consuming devastation. Without another word, she stepped around Lucas, ready to walk away.

He lunged forward, fingers closing around her wrist like a drowning man clutching at driftwood.

"Claire, wait—please. We need to talk about this."

"Let go." Her voice was ice. She tried to wrench free, but his grip was desperate.

"You just had surgery. You shouldn’t be alone. Let me take care of you. I know I messed up, but I can fix this—just don’t walk away."

He knew. The moment she left, she wouldn’t come back.

And the thought of losing her was unbearable.

Claire turned, her gaze colder than he’d ever seen it. "Lucas, the divorce papers will be at your door by tomorrow."

The documents are on your desk in the office this afternoon. If you refuse to sign them, expect a court summons within a week."

With that, Claire wrenched her arm free from Lucas's grip and turned away. She walked off without hesitation, her steps firm and resolute.

This time, there was no hesitation, no lingering affection.

Lucas stood frozen, his body rigid, his mind numb.

The crowd that had gathered to watch the spectacle began to disperse. Whispers faded, footsteps retreated, but Lucas remained motionless, his tall frame stark against the emptying space.

He looked like a man severed from the world—a statue of desolation, directionless and hollow.

"Lucas..."

Isabella wheeled herself toward him, wincing through the pain. She saw her opportunity and seized it.

"Even without Claire, you still have me. I'll never leave your side."

Boldly, she reached out and wrapped her arms around his waist, pressing her cheek against him.

"Lucas, I've loved you for so long. It doesn't matter that Claire ended the pregnancy. I can give you children. Let me be the one who stays with you."

Her voice was soft, pleading, but Lucas didn't move. His hands remained limp at his sides, his gaze fixed on the spot where Claire had disappeared.

The air around them felt heavy, suffocating.

Isabella tightened her hold, desperate for a reaction. But Lucas was lost—somewhere far beyond her reach.

And for the first time, she wondered if she had already lost him too.

The sterile hospital lights glared down as Lucas Bennett stood frozen in the hallway. His knuckles were white from gripping the armrest of Isabella Rhodes' wheelchair too tightly.

"I'll be with you from now on," Isabella murmured, her voice trembling with false sweetness. "We can forget everything and start fresh. Doesn't that sound perfect?"

Nearby, Harrison Wells, the surgeon waiting for Isabella's procedure, nearly choked on his coffee.

So she’s the one who broke them up? His grip tightened around the disposable cup. And now she’s swooping in the second they fight? Shameless.

Isabella, mistaking Lucas' silence for hesitation, reached for his hand.

The moment her fingers brushed his, he recoiled violently. The force sent her wheelchair careening backward, wheels spinning wildly.

Isabella gasped as the world tilted around her. Lucas was already walking away, his broad shoulders rigid with disgust.

"Lucas! Wait—!"

Panicked, she fumbled with the wheelchair’s controls. But in her haste, she misjudged the turn.

The back wheels caught on the stair’s edge.

Her stomach lurched as the chair tipped.

"LUCAS!"

Her scream tore through the hallway as gravity took over. The wheelchair flipped, sending her crashing down the steps in a tangle of limbs and metal.

The last thing she saw was Lucas’ retreating figure—never once looking back.

The deafening sound of her body hitting the ground didn't even make Lucas Bennett pause. He kept walking away without a backward glance.

Isabella Rhodes lay sprawled on the icy marble floor, the shock of betrayal freezing her more than the cold surface beneath her. Her wide, disbelieving eyes stared at Lucas's retreating figure as the pain of her shattered illusions radiated through her entire being.

###Chapter 163 Hefty Meal

The impact sent Isabella Rhodes flying from her wheelchair, the metal contraption careening down the staircase without her.

She landed hard on the landing, her body twisted at an unnatural angle, legs dangling precariously over the railing.

Pain exploded through her like wildfire, sharp and unrelenting, searing through every nerve until her vision blurred.

Her screams tore through the air—raw, guttural, the kind that made bystanders flinch as if they’d been struck themselves.

She couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. It felt like a freight train had plowed straight through her, leaving nothing but wreckage in its wake.

For a long, horrifying moment, no one moved. No one dared. She lay there, discarded in the corner like broken furniture, forgotten by the world.

Meanwhile, in an upscale restaurant, two perfectly seared steaks arrived at a private table.

The meat glistened under the soft lighting, its crust caramelized to a rich, golden-brown, promising decadence with every bite.

The sound of sizzling filled the air, the aroma rich and intoxicating—crisp on the outside, but beneath that perfect sear lay tender, buttery perfection.

The sun was setting over Cresthaven, painting the sky in hues of gold and crimson.

Claire Dawson raised her hand with dramatic flourish, signaling the waiter. "Two more of your most expensive dishes," she declared, her voice carrying across the elegant dining room. "And let everyone know—tonight’s feast is on me!"

The upscale restaurant erupted in cheers.

This wasn’t just any restaurant—it was La Perle, where a single glass of wine could cost more than most people’s monthly rent. A full-course meal here? Easily a small fortune.

But Claire didn’t care.

Freshly discharged from the hospital, she and Evelyn Carter had made a pact: they were going to drain Lucas Bennett’s credit card dry.

"We’re divorcing anyway," Claire thought, swirling her champagne with a smirk. "Why leave him with a single penny? Let him suffer. Consider this my parting gift—charity in the form of fine dining."

Soon, well-dressed patrons began approaching their table, glasses raised in gratitude.

In a place like this, filled with Cresthaven’s elite, social niceties were expected.

One woman, recognizing Claire, leaned in with a polite smile. "What’s the occasion, darling?"

Claire grinned, raising her glass high. "Celebrating my divorce from Lucas Bennett!"

The woman’s smile faltered.

Lucas Bennett wasn’t just any name—the Bennett family was second only to the Whitmores in Cresthaven’s high society.

Silence rippled through the nearby tables.

Evelyn stifled a laugh, lifting her own glass. "To freedom!"

Claire clinked hers against it, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "And to bankrupting ex-husbands!"

The tension shattered as laughter filled the air.

But across the room, whispers had already begun.

"Did she just say Lucas Bennett?"

"The Bennett heir? That’s a scandal waiting to explode."

Claire didn’t care.

Tonight was about indulgence.

Revenge.

And making sure Lucas felt every single dollar vanishing from his account.

The guest couldn't help but wonder, Why is Claire so delighted about a divorce when most people would kill to be part of high society?

Noticing the unspoken question, Claire smirked. "You think being tied to a wealthy family is some kind of blessing? Not for me. I'm free now—shouldn't you be congratulating me instead?"

The guest let out an awkward chuckle before hastily offering some half-hearted compliments.

Soon enough, everyone who approached to toast had no choice but to join in the celebration.

What should have been a somber occasion turned into something resembling a victory party.

To keep Claire's mood lifted, guests were subtly encouraged to take playful jabs at Lucas Bennett.

After all, few actually knew who he was—men like him didn’t exactly mingle with the average crowd.

A few mocking remarks thrown his way seemed like a fair trade for staying in the hostess’s good graces.

Evelyn kept a watchful eye on Claire, ensuring she didn’t overindulge.

Even though Claire had been discharged the same day as her procedure, recovery wasn’t something to take lightly.

The last thing they needed was a setback because of reckless celebration.

Evelyn discreetly swapped Claire’s champagne for sparkling water, earning herself an exaggerated eye roll.

But Claire didn’t protest—deep down, she appreciated the concern.

Around them, laughter and chatter filled the room, the energy infectious.

For the first time in a long while, Claire felt light.

No more suffocating expectations.

No more walking on eggshells.

Just pure, unfiltered freedom.

And she intended to savor every second of it.

The final bill tallied a staggering $52.3 million. Claire didn’t even blink.

Across town, Lucas’s phone buzzed violently with the notification. His eyes widened at the amount.

"Fifty-two million?" he muttered under his breath. "Did they dine on solid gold caviar?"

By the time Lucas sped to the restaurant, the table had long been cleared. Claire had vanished without a trace.

###Chapter 164 Vanished

The moment they stepped out of the restaurant, someone chuckled. "Claire's really something, isn't she? I ordered a bottle of wine—thirty grand! I'd never spend that much on a drink in my life."

Another voice chimed in. "And what about Lucas? How is she this happy about the divorce?"

"Honestly, treating the entire restaurant to celebrate? Only the ultra-rich live like this. Even divorce is a grand event for them."

Their laughter faded as they walked away.

Lucas, who had heard every word, froze in place.

The pain hit him like a tidal wave, crushing his chest until he could barely breathe. He stumbled through the streets, desperate to find Claire, only to discover she was throwing a party to celebrate their separation.

It was unbearable.

The agony was suffocating, as if he'd been thrown into a frozen abyss with no escape. No light. No hope.

Claire's celebration was a knife twisting in his heart.

"I don’t want this divorce!" The words screamed in his mind.

He couldn't accept it.

Not like this.

Not when he still loved her.

Three days. That was all he could take.

Alexander Whitmore sat on the edge of the bed, clad in black silk pajamas. His gaze lingered on the empty space beside him.

A single strand of Evelyn’s hair still rested on the pillow—left behind from three nights ago.

Since she had walked out, this was all he had left of her. He had twisted it between his fingers so many times it had lost its sheen.

Now, he wound it around his index finger, phone pressed to his ear, his voice rough with exhaustion.

"Darling, when are you coming home?"

The silence on the other end was deafening.

Alexander exhaled sharply. Evelyn could skip work—fine. But why wasn’t she even coming home?

Three days. No calls. No texts.

This wasn’t how a wife behaved.

They had barely been married a month. Weren’t they supposed to be in the honeymoon phase?

It was driving him insane.

His mind refused to focus. Not during meetings. Not during calls.

Every second was consumed by one thought—Where the hell was she?

The office was unusually quiet.

Alexander Whitmore sat at his desk, staring blankly at the documents in front of him. His fingers tapped restlessly against the mahogany surface, his mind elsewhere.

For the past three days, his phone had been silent.

No calls.

No messages.

Nothing from Evelyn.

It was as if she had disappeared into thin air.

Lucas Bennett had dragged him out to Eclipse Lounge two nights in a row, drowning his sorrows in whiskey.

"Can't believe I was such an idiot," Lucas slurred, his glass half-empty. "Claire's gone, and I don't even know where to start looking."

Alexander barely listened.

His own thoughts were a storm of frustration and regret.

Why hadn’t Evelyn reached out?

Had she really just walked away?

Lucas groaned, slumping forward. "She’s vanished. Like a ghost."

Alexander exhaled sharply.

He knew the feeling.

Every time he unlocked his phone, he half-expected to see her name flash across the screen.

But there was nothing.

Just silence.

And it was driving him mad.
###Chapter 165 A Secret

Alexander's thoughts darkened as he stared at his phone.

"At least Lucas can't track down Claire since she's deliberately hiding from him after their divorce. But what about me?"

His fingers tightened around the device.

"Evelyn and I were perfect—no, better than perfect. Three nights ago, we were tangled in silk sheets, lost in each other. Every touch, every whisper, every gasp was electric."

He could still feel the warmth of her skin beneath his palms.

"I held her close, murmuring her name as she arched against me, breathless and wanting. We didn’t just make love—we burned together."

His jaw clenched.

"Then she vanished. Three days. No calls. No texts. Just silence."

The bitter taste of rejection coated his tongue.

"Was I just a distraction? Something to use and discard?"

The phone vibrated in Evelyn's hand, casting a pale glow across the darkened bedroom.

She glanced at Claire, asleep beside her, before slipping onto the balcony. The night air was cool against her skin.

For three days, she hadn’t left Claire’s side.

There were reasons she hadn’t contacted Alexander.

First—he and Lucas were close. One careless word, and Lucas might storm into Claire’s sanctuary, demanding answers she wasn’t ready to give.

Second—

Her thumb hovered over the screen.

She wasn’t sure what to say.

The intensity of that night still lingered in Evelyn's mind, making her pulse quicken just thinking about it. Their passion had been overwhelming, and she needed space to sort through the whirlwind of emotions.

"I... um, can I come home tomorrow?" Evelyn murmured into the phone, her fingers twisting the edge of her sweater.

On the other end, Alexander exhaled softly, the sound sending a shiver down her spine.

Tomorrow meant an entire day apart—hours of meetings, decisions, and forced patience before he could see her again.

After a pause, Evelyn bit her lip, then smiled. "Actually, I was thinking of returning to work at Titan Capital Group tomorrow."

A low chuckle vibrated through the line. "Okay."

Realizing how late it was, Evelyn lowered her voice. "Well, goodnight."

"See you tomorrow," Alexander replied, his tone warm with promise.

The next morning, the moment Evelyn stepped into the office, Natalie Brooks dragged her into a secluded corner, her eyes wide with exaggerated distress.

"You have no idea what it's been like," Natalie hissed. "With you gone these past few days, Mr. Caldwell has been unbearable. The entire floor has been walking on eggshells."

Evelyn frowned, heading to the pantry to rinse out a mug. "What happened?"

Natalie shuddered. "He's always intense, but this week? It's like he's been possessed by some kind of corporate demon. Even the coffee machine seems afraid of him."

Evelyn hid a smile behind her cup.

If only Natalie knew the real reason behind Alexander's mood.

"Mr. Whitmore has been in a terrible mood lately—half the board got chewed out in yesterday's meeting."

Though the Whitmore family knew about their marriage, Titan Capital remained oblivious.

Evelyn had never planned to reveal it. From the beginning, she intended to keep their relationship strictly private.

Alexander Whitmore was the CEO of Titan Capital. She? Just a junior assistant in the finance department.

If word got out, the office gossip would be unbearable. The whispers, the judgmental stares—she couldn’t handle that.

Natalie leaned closer, voice hushed. "Just giving you a heads-up. Stay clear of Mr. Whitmore’s office this week. He’s not in the mood for distractions."

To their coworkers, Evelyn was still the girl foolishly chasing after the unattainable CEO. Approaching him now would only confirm their suspicions.

Natalie meant well.

Then Victoria’s sharp voice cut through the air behind them.

"Evelyn Carter, what’s your secret? Barely a month here, and you’ve already taken more days off than some do in a year." Her laugh was cold. "Do you think this is your family business?"

Evelyn turned slowly, meeting Victoria’s mocking gaze.

Evelyn stayed quiet, the weight of her frequent absences pressing down on her. She knew it had been too much.

Victoria Sloan smirked, crossing her arms. "I heard Mr. Whitmore is married. Evelyn, you’re not still clinging to some fantasy of becoming Mrs. Whitmore, are you?" She tilted her head, her voice dripping with mock concern. "Some women these days think they can just skip the hard work and land a rich husband. Pathetic, really."

Cassandra Reed, ever the office gossip, gasped dramatically. "Ms. Sloan, Mr. Whitmore is married? Who told you that? I haven’t heard a thing!"

Evelyn clenched her fists under the table, her nails digging into her palms. The whispers around her grew louder, each word a tiny dagger.

Victoria leaned in, her voice low but sharp enough to cut. "Oh, it’s common knowledge among the right circles. But then again, not everyone moves in those circles, do they?"

The room buzzed with speculation. Evelyn could feel their eyes on her, judging, dissecting.

She exhaled slowly, forcing her expression to remain neutral. But inside, the storm raged.

###Chapter 166 Personal Issues

The coffee machine hummed softly as Victoria placed her cup beneath it. "My cousin married into one of Cresthaven's elite families," she said casually. "We had dinner last night, and she mentioned something interesting."

Cassandra's eyes lit up with curiosity. "What did she say? Who's Alexander Whitmore's wife?"

Victoria's lips curled into a sly smile. "Apparently, it was a whirlwind wedding. The entire Whitmore family knows, and even high society is buzzing about it. As for who the lucky woman is..."

Her gaze slid pointedly toward Evelyn, laced with mocking amusement. "Definitely not someone from our world. Probably some socialite with old money and connections."

Natalie and Cassandra both turned to look at Evelyn.

Leaning closer, Natalie lowered her voice. "Evelyn, if Mr. Whitmore is already married, maybe it's time to... let go. Chasing a taken man isn’t exactly respectable."

If Alexander were single, pursuing him would be one thing. But now? It would just look desperate.

Evelyn felt like she had walked straight into a trap of her own making.

A sharp realization struck Evelyn like lightning—the news of Alexander's impromptu wedding had already electrified the entire office.

She couldn't keep up this charade anymore, chasing after a man who was now undeniably taken.

It wasn’t just about pride—it was about self-respect.

Evelyn straightened her shoulders, her voice steady as she addressed her colleagues. "I took some time off to clear my head. And I’ve realized… my feelings for Mr. Whitmore were nothing more than professional admiration. Like a devoted fan idolizing a star."

She paused, gauging their reactions. Seeing their skeptical expressions soften, she added, "So, no more misunderstandings. I’ll maintain a strictly professional relationship from now on."

At that exact moment, Alexander strode past the break room, catching every word.

His steps faltered. His jaw clenched, and his usually composed expression darkened into something unreadable—yet undeniably icy.

Simon, trailing behind him, nearly stumbled in surprise.

No wonder Mr. Whitmore’s been in such a foul mood lately. Did he and Mrs. Whitmore have a fight?

"Evelyn." Alexander’s voice cut through the room like a blade, cold and authoritative. "My office. Now."

Every head turned. The air thickened as he walked away, leaving behind a trail of tension so palpable it sent shivers down their spines.

He had the aura of a man who commanded respect—and fear.

The entire office seemed to shrink back, remembering how Alexander Whitmore had been particularly ruthless these past few days.

Natalie Brooks shot Evelyn Carter a sympathetic glance, thinking, She’s about to face the storm.

In his office, Alexander sat behind his desk, his focus entirely on the documents in front of him. When Evelyn entered, he didn’t so much as glance up, as if she were nothing more than a shadow.

Three days without seeing him had sharpened his features, his jawline more pronounced, his presence even more imposing.

His grip on the pen was tight, the strokes deliberate and heavy against the paper.

Remembering Natalie’s warning about Alexander’s recent temper, Evelyn approached with caution.

“Mr. Whitmore, you asked to see me?”

Finally, his gaze lifted, locking onto hers with an intensity that made her pulse stutter. “Come closer.”

Evelyn took a step forward, stopping just before his desk.

His brow furrowed, and he gestured impatiently. “Closer.”

Swallowing her unease, she rounded the desk until she stood directly in front of him.

Before Evelyn could regain her balance, Alexander yanked her onto his lap.

His strong arms locked around her waist like steel bands. The warmth of his breath sent shivers down her neck as he leaned in close.

Alexander's voice was laced with dark amusement as he whispered, "So you're just admiring me like some starstruck fan?"

His grip tightened. "You don't like me?"

"Is that why you want to keep your distance from now on?"

A dangerous edge crept into his tone. "Mrs. Whitmore, don't you think you owe me an explanation?"

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed. He'd heard everything—every careless word she'd said in the break room.

This wasn't a business meeting. It was an ambush. A reckoning for their so-called personal issues.

"Alexander, please—let me explain!" she gasped, desperation clawing at her throat.

###Chapter 167 Agreement

Alexander's lips curled into an amused smirk. "Go on, say it."

Evelyn let out a quiet sigh, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her blazer. "The entire office is buzzing about your marriage. I guess that means I should stop chasing after you now."

Restless, Alexander loosened his tie with a sharp tug. "Then why don’t you just announce that you're the one I married?"

"Absolutely not!" Evelyn's eyes widened in alarm. "If people find out I'm the CEO's wife, my career is over. I’d be buried under fake smiles and forced small talk. No one would take my work seriously."

"So, what? We keep pretending we're not married at work?"

She nodded firmly.

Alexander's gaze darkened, his displeasure evident.

Internally, he weighed the situation. We kept it quiet at first to avoid the backlash.

But now that Ethan and Vanessa are married, they’ve taken the spotlight off us.

The thought didn’t sit well with him.

He wanted the world to know Evelyn was his.

Yet, he understood her fears.

The office politics, the whispers, the opportunists—she wasn’t wrong.

Still, the secrecy chafed at him.

Evelyn studied his expression, her voice softening. "Just for a little longer?"

Alexander exhaled sharply.

Then, reluctantly, he gave a single nod.

For now, he’d play along.

But not forever.

The sun dipped below the skyline of Cresthaven, casting long shadows across the penthouse. Evelyn Carter exhaled slowly, her fingers tightening around the edge of the sofa.

"Besides," she murmured, "everyone in Cresthaven’s elite already knows we’re married. Gossip spreads like wildfire. It won’t be long before Titan Capital finds out."

Alexander Whitmore leaned in, his breath warm against the curve of her neck as he inhaled the delicate floral scent of her hair. The intimacy sent a shiver down Evelyn’s spine, her pulse quickening.

But she didn’t miss the shift in his demeanor—the way his jaw had tensed the moment she suggested keeping their marriage hidden at work.

She bit her lip, then ventured softly, "Is that… alright with you?"

Alexander’s lips curled into a slow, dangerous smile. "First, kiss me. Then I’ll consider it."

Evelyn’s throat went dry.

Her lashes fluttered as she hesitantly gripped the lapels of his tailored suit, pulling him closer. The brush of her lips against his was featherlight, barely there—a fleeting touch before she withdrew.

Alexander’s fingers grazed his mouth, his gaze darkening with hunger. "That’s all you’re giving me?"

His voice was low, rough with restraint.

Evelyn swallowed.

The air between them thickened, charged with something deeper—something unspoken.

Before Evelyn could process his words, Alexander's strong arm already encircled her waist.

His breath was scorching against her skin, sending her pulse into a frantic rhythm.

His fingers tangled in her hair, tilting her face upward. The moment her lips parted, his tongue claimed hers in a searing, possessive kiss.

Alexander didn’t just kiss her—he devoured her. Each brush of his lips stole her breath, pulling her deeper into him until she could barely think.

Her mind emptied under the sheer intensity of his desire.

He refused to let her shut her eyes, forcing her to watch as their mouths moved together in heated synchronization.

Heat flooded Evelyn’s cheeks as a sudden memory resurfaced—his husky whisper that night, dark with need.

"Evelyn, yes, just like this. Look at me."

"Alright, I surrender! I'm almost there!"

The recollection made her squirm in his hold.

Then—sharp clicks of heels echoed outside the door.

Flustered, Evelyn tried to push away, but Alexander’s grip only tightened, refusing to let her escape.

Alexander's gaze dropped, his fingers tightening around Evelyn's waist. "Come home early tonight?"

The unspoken request hung heavy between them.

Perched on Alexander's lap, Evelyn could feel every inch of his arousal pressing against her.

She bit her lip, whispering, "I can't. Claire needs me for a few more days."

A shadow crossed Alexander's face, his expression turning icy. "You promised you'd be back tonight."

Evelyn shifted, her voice soft but firm. "She's alone. I can't leave her like this."

At least for the next two weeks, she had to stay with Claire.

A sharp knock interrupted them. Natalie's voice filtered through the door.

"Mr. Whitmore, there's an urgent document requiring your signature."

Evelyn tried to slip free, but Alexander's grip remained unyielding.

Her pulse quickened. If someone walked in now, explanations would be impossible.

She met his darkened gaze, pleading. "We agreed to keep this private. Please, let me go."

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows of Eclipse Lounge, casting golden patterns across Alexander Whitmore's sharp features.

He leaned back in the leather booth, swirling his whiskey with deliberate slowness. That familiar smirk played at his lips—the one that always made Evelyn Carter's pulse quicken.

"Go?" Alexander arched a brow, amusement dancing in his piercing blue eyes. "Did we?"

Evelyn crossed her arms, her dark hair cascading over one shoulder. The scent of vanilla and citrus from her perfume mingled with the smoky aroma of aged oak.

A beat passed.

Then another.

Alexander's grin widened, revealing that infuriatingly perfect dimple. "I seem to recall," he drawled, tilting his glass toward her, "that I never actually agreed."

The ice cubes clinked mockingly.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. That man could turn a simple conversation into a battlefield with just a look.

Outside, the city of Cresthaven buzzed with life, unaware of the silent war waging between them in the dimly lit corner of the upscale lounge.

Somewhere in the distance, a clock tower chimed.

Alexander's gaze never wavered.

The game was on.

###Chapter 168 Unexpected Fall

Evelyn exhaled sharply through her nose.

Of course he would do this.

Alexander Whitmore lived for these moments—the verbal sparring, the unspoken challenges, the way her cheeks flushed when he cornered her with that silver tongue of his.

She reached for her cosmopolitan, the condensation cool against her fingertips. The pink liquid shimmered under the low lighting as she took a deliberate sip.

"Typical," she finally said, meeting his gaze head-on. "You'd argue semantics while the world burns."

Alexander's chuckle was rich and velvety, the sound wrapping around her like expensive silk. "Darling," he purred, "the world's been burning long before us."

His phone vibrated on the table. A glance at the screen showed a message from Simon Graves.

Evelyn noted the way his jaw tightened momentarily before the mask of amusement slipped back into place.

Interesting.

She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. "Problem at Horizon Enterprises?"

Alexander's fingers stilled on his glass. The briefest flicker of surprise crossed his face before he schooled his features.

"Now, Evelyn," he murmured, reaching across to tuck a stray lock of hair behind her ear, his touch lingering just a heartbeat too long. "Where would the fun be if I told you everything?"

The air between them crackled.

Somewhere in the lounge, a glass shattered.

Neither of them flinched.

The game, it seemed, had only just begun.

Evelyn pressed her forehead against the polished oak door, her voice barely above a whisper. "Mr. Whitmore, are you in there?"

Her mind raced. This doesn’t add up. Natalie went into his office and hasn’t come out yet.

Worry gnawed at her. If Alexander was reprimanding Natalie, she needed to intervene.

But silence greeted her.

Alexander’s gaze flickered to Natalie’s pale face, and a wicked smirk curled his lips. The urge to toy with her was irresistible.

"The door isn’t locked," he drawled, watching as Natalie stiffened.

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the handle. "Should I just… open it?"

Natalie’s pulse skyrocketed.

Every sound amplified—the faint creak of the door, the whisper of Evelyn’s sleeve brushing against it.

Alexander’s grip on Natalie’s waist tightened, his lips grazing the curve of her neck. He reveled in the chaos he’d ignited within her.

The door swung open as Natalie stepped inside, and Evelyn's thoughts raced. Without hesitation, she seized the chair behind Alexander and shoved it backward with all her might.

Alexander, caught completely off guard, tumbled sideways with the chair.

Realizing he was about to hit the ground, he instinctively released Evelyn.

"Mr. Whitmore, what happened? Did the chair just collapse?"

As Alexander landed hard on the floor, a pang of guilt shot through Evelyn.

But she quickly schooled her expression, dropping to her knees beside him with feigned concern.

Her heart pounded wildly.

He won’t be too mad, right? I had no choice—he wouldn’t let go.

Alexander lay sprawled on the floor, one knee bent, his hand propping up his head. His gaze locked onto Evelyn’s, a dangerous glint of amusement mixed with irritation in his eyes.

His voice was deceptively light. "Strange, isn’t it? The chair just happened to tip over. Ms. Carter, aren’t you going to help me up?"

Evelyn swallowed hard under his scrutiny but forced herself to reach for his arm.

The moment her fingers brushed his sleeve, Alexander leaned in close, his voice dropping to a whisper.

The air in the office turned dangerously charged. "Darling, you've really done it this time," Alexander murmured, his voice dripping with dark amusement.

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

Natalie, who had just stepped inside, froze in shock.

Mr. Whitmore—always so impeccably composed, the unshakable CEO who commanded respect with a single glance—just tumbled from his chair like a clumsy intern.

This can never leave this room.

Relieved to see Evelyn wasn't being reprimanded, Natalie quickly set down the files and slipped out, closing the door behind her.

The moment they were alone, Alexander rose with deliberate slowness, his presence overwhelming as he stalked toward Evelyn.

She retreated instinctively, her back hitting the wall. "Alexander, I—I didn’t mean to—"

His smirk deepened, eyes glinting with predatory intent.

One hand braced against the wall beside her head, the other snaking around her waist, he yanked her flush against him.

Evelyn gasped as his mouth crashed onto hers in a searing, possessive kiss.

He kissed her with bruising intensity, stealing her breath, leaving her dizzy.

Over his shoulder, the reflection in his glass liquor cabinet caught her eye—a fleeting glimpse of their entangled figures before Alexander’s grip tightened, pulling her deeper into the storm.

The reflection in the mirror showed Alexander's lips tracing fiery patterns along Evelyn's neck, each touch sending electric currents through her body. Her muscles tensed instinctively, responding to the intoxicating sensations.

"Mrs. Whitmore," Alexander murmured, his voice dripping with dark promise, "allow me to demonstrate the proper way to make amends."

Evelyn gasped as his calloused fingers skimmed down the delicate curve of her spine, leaving a trail of goosebumps in their wake.

###Chapter 169 Forbidden Desires

The air between us was electric.

Alexander's gaze was heavy with unspoken hunger, his sculpted features darkened by desire. That lazy smirk of his sent shivers down my spine.

Evelyn froze. Her pulse raced wildly, threatening to escape the confines of her chest.

She knew exactly what that look meant.

With trembling fingers, Evelyn caught Alexander's wandering hand. "We can't," she whispered, voice unsteady. "This is your office."

A low chuckle rumbled from his chest. "My office, my rules."

The space between them grew hotter, charged with something dangerous. Their breaths tangled, heavy and uneven. Need burned in both their eyes, undeniable.

Then—

The door swung open without warning.

"Alex, I heard Evelyn was back at work today. What about Claire—"

Lucas Bennett stopped mid-sentence, freezing under Alexander's glacial stare.

The moment Lucas Bennett pushed open the door, Alexander Whitmore's murderous glare made him freeze mid-step.

Alexander had a woman pressed against him.

Though both were fully clothed, Alexander's chest rose and fell rapidly. The woman in his arms—Evelyn Carter—had flushed cheeks, her lips slightly swollen.

It didn't take a genius to figure out what had been interrupted.

Lucas stiffened, suddenly realizing his terrible timing. The door had already clicked shut behind him. Now he was trapped in an awkward limbo—stay or leave?

He decided to barrel forward.

"Evelyn," he blurted, "where's Claire? I haven't been able to find her for days! Her phone goes straight to voicemail!"

The warmth in Evelyn's chest evaporated.

Her expression darkened as she shoved Alexander away.

"Lucas," she hissed, "how dare you come looking for Claire after what you did? She never wants to see you again."

"Just tell me where she is," Lucas demanded, desperation creeping into his voice. "I need to talk to her!"

Lucas Bennett looked like a ghost of his former self. His skin had taken on an unhealthy pallor, and the deep shadows beneath his bloodshot eyes betrayed days without proper rest. Stubble darkened his jawline, and the expensive suit he wore was wrinkled—clearly the same one he’d had on for the past three days. The sharp scent of whiskey clung to him, noticeable even from several feet away.

Evelyn Carter crossed her arms, her expression unyielding. "If you have even an ounce of remorse for what you did to Claire, then sign the damn papers and stop prolonging this."

Lucas’s jaw tightened. "No. I won’t divorce her."

"Do you really think refusing makes a difference now?" Evelyn scoffed. "Claire has made up her mind. If you don’t sign willingly, she’ll take you to court. You’re a public figure—do you really want this dragged through the media?"

A hollow laugh escaped him.

"Didn’t she already expose everything at that dinner?" His voice was rough, laced with bitterness. "The whole world knows I’m the villain in her story. What’s left to ruin?"

Evelyn’s frown deepened.

"I don’t care about my reputation anymore," Lucas rasped, desperation creeping into his tone. "I’d give up everything—anything—just to have her back."

He took a step forward, his movements unsteady. "Please… help me. Just tell me where she is. Every second without her feels like torture."

As he drew closer, Evelyn caught sight of the spiderweb of red veins in his eyes, the wild, haunted look in them. It sent a chill down her spine.

He looked like a man on the edge of breaking.

In Evelyn's memory, Lucas had always been obsessed with his appearance. Every single piece of clothing he owned was sent to the finest dry cleaners in Cresthaven.

Whether it was a tailored suit for business meetings or casual weekend wear, he never stepped out looking anything less than impeccable.

Evelyn felt a pang of guilt, but she didn’t let it weaken her resolve.

Claire was still recovering from childbirth. The last thing Evelyn needed was Lucas barging in and disrupting her peace.

"I won’t tell you a thing," Evelyn said coolly, striding out of the office.

Lucas moved to follow her, but Alexander was already blocking his path with a warning glare.

###Chapter 170 Wrong Password

Alexander's piercing gaze turned glacial. "Lucas, you've gone too far!" His voice cut through the air like a blade.

It was the middle of a workday. What would the staff think if they saw Lucas barging into Evelyn's office like this?

Lucas's face was ashen. "Alexander, what am I supposed to do? You know how I feel about Claire. I love her—so why would she terminate the pregnancy and file for divorce?" His words trembled with raw anguish.

Why?

Because you took her for granted when she was yours.

Now that she's gone, the pain is unbearable. Only in losing her do you realize what you've lost.

Alexander bit back the words. As a friend, he wouldn't twist the knife deeper.

He pulled out a cigarette, the flame flickering as he lit it. Smoke curled around him, sharpening the hard lines of his jaw. "How's Isabella handling this?"

Lucas exhaled shakily. "I don't know."

The days passed without another glimpse of Isabella.

Lucas used to cross paths with her frequently, but only because she had once saved his life.

Isabella came from humble beginnings. Her parents struggled to raise four children, with her being the third daughter.

In a family like that, she had learned early not to expect handouts. Survival meant carving her own path.

Cresthaven was a city where connections meant everything.

Back then, he had asked her, "You saved me. What do you want in return?"

Lucas had assumed she would name a price—money, a favor, something tangible. But instead, she had simply smiled and said, "Lucas, if I demand something, doesn’t that make me just another opportunist? How about this—just let me tag along when you go out with your friends. I’d like to see more of the world."

At the time, it had seemed like such a small request.

Now, looking back, he realized how calculated it had been. His circle was the most exclusive in Cresthaven.

Over the years, Isabella had undoubtedly used her proximity to him to climb higher.

Take her position as lead dancer, for example. Lucas had seen her perform. She wasn’t bad—but she was nowhere near as talented as Claire.

There were far more talented dancers in the company, yet Isabella had maintained her lead role for years. How?

The realization hit him like a slap. How had he been so blind?

Alexander exhaled sharply, smoke curling from his lips. "As your friend, I'm telling you—let her go. Clean break."

"Let her go?" Lucas's voice cracked. "After everything I've done to Claire? She just lost our child. If I divorce her now, what does that make me?"

"So what's your plan? Dragging this out indefinitely?"

"I need to see her. I'll do anything—take care of her, beg for forgiveness. I'll help her recover, even if it means groveling."

Evelyn, who'd been lingering by the doorway, stepped inside.

"Willowbrook Apartments, Penthouse A. That's where she is," she said flatly.

Lucas didn’t rush to Claire immediately.

First, he went home. He showered, changed into fresh clothes, meticulously shaved.

He scrutinized his reflection, adjusting his collar until satisfied. Only then did he drive to Willowbrook, knuckles white on the steering wheel.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing the penthouse floor. Lucas Bennett hesitated before stepping out, his fingers hovering over the doorbell.

Then he saw it—a handwritten note taped to the door.

"Sleeping. Do Not Disturb."

Claire’s neat script was unmistakable.

Lucas withdrew his hand, shoving it into his pocket instead. He moved to the floor-to-ceiling window, pulling out a cigarette. The lighter flickered to life, casting a brief glow over his sharp features.

Minutes stretched into hours. The ashtray beside him filled with crushed cigarette butts.

Three hours.

Silence.

No movement from inside.

A frown creased his brow. Was this even her place?

His gaze shifted to the keypad lock. A memory surfaced—Claire always used his birthday for everything. Her terrible memory made it the only way she could remember.

His fingers moved automatically, inputting the numbers.

Beep.

Incorrect Password.

Lucas froze.

His chest tightened.

Something cold settled in his stomach.

###Chapter 171 The Waiting Game

Lucas Bennett hesitated at the door, his knuckles hovering just inches from the wood. He didn’t want to disturb her, so he stayed rooted in place, leaning against the wall.

Hours ticked by.

By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, Evelyn Carter finally stepped out of the elevator, arms laden with grocery bags. She froze when she spotted Lucas still lingering in the hallway.

Still here?

She exhaled sharply but said nothing, scanning her fingerprint to unlock the door. As she stepped inside, Lucas moved to follow.

Evelyn turned, blocking the entrance with her body. "I just realized I forgot the salad dressing," she said smoothly, her voice deceptively light. "Would you mind grabbing a bottle? I’m cooking for Claire tonight."

At the mention of Claire Dawson, Lucas nodded without protest, turning back toward the elevator.

The moment the doors slid shut, Evelyn slammed the door with a satisfying thud.

As if I’d let him waltz in here.

Inside, Claire was sprawled on the couch, flipping through a reality show. She glanced up as Evelyn dumped the groceries on the counter. "Back so soon?"

Evelyn smirked. "Obviously."

"Any dinner preferences? I'll whip something up," Evelyn offered, slipping off her heels by the entrance.

Claire tapped her chin, considering. The thought of Evelyn cooking after a grueling workday didn't sit right. "Let's dine out tonight," she countered brightly.

Neither brought up Lucas.

The security feed by the door had captured everything—including the shadow lingering outside their penthouse all afternoon. Impossible to miss, really.

Evelyn disappeared into her walk-in closet, calling over her shoulder, "Your pick. Where to?"

"The Eclipse Lounge!" Claire declared without hesitation.

"Dinner at a nightclub?" Evelyn's skeptical voice floated through the half-open door.

The Eclipse Lounge was the city's most exclusive playground. Last time they'd visited, Claire had shamelessly ordered a male escort—top-shelf, naturally.

But when her best friend set her heart on something, Evelyn never refused.

The matte-black Rolls-Royce Cullinan in their private garage was Claire's latest impulse buy. A seven-figure beast meant for off-roading, now sporting custom neon-pink racing stripes and—absurdly—diamond-encrusted hood ornaments shaped like kitten ears.

As if the roaring V12 engine wasn't announcement enough that this monstrosity belonged to a woman who played by no one's rules.

Claire revved the engine, grinning at Evelyn's eye roll. "Buckle up, darling. Tonight's going to be legendary."

The city lights blurred past as they merged onto the boulevard, two queens in their armored chariot. Somewhere behind them, a certain unwanted shadow finally gave up his vigil.

Good riddance.

When Lucas returned with the salad dressing, he spotted a sleek car pulling out of the gated community.

The ridiculous bunny ears on the dashboard were impossible to miss, making him do a double take.

That was when he saw Claire sitting in the passenger seat, her expression unreadable behind tinted windows.

Lucas's heart lurched. Without thinking, he sprinted forward, planting himself directly in the car's path.

"Claire! Where are you going?" His voice was tight with panic. The thought of her slipping away again made his chest constrict.

The window rolled down halfway, revealing Claire's icy, aristocratic profile.

Her makeup was flawless—smoky eyeshadow, sharp contour, and those blood-red lips that always made her look like she was seconds away from either kissing someone or destroying them.

"Eclipse Lounge. Dinner plans," she said coolly.

Lucas scowled. "A nightclub for dinner?"

"I enjoy the ambiance. Now move."

Before he could argue, the window slid back up, and the Rolls-Royce purred away.

Cursing under his breath, Lucas chucked the salad dressing onto the nearest bench. He bolted to his car, tires screeching as he tore after them.

Eclipse Lounge was pulsing with energy, the bass thumping through the dimly lit space.

Evelyn and Claire lounged in a velvet-upholstered booth, sipping cocktails when the manager appeared, all smarmy smiles.

Recognizing them from last time—especially remembering their preferences—he quickly ushered over two fresh-faced young men.

Both looked barely legal, their nervous energy palpable.

The manager leaned in conspiratorially. "Ladies, these two just started tonight. Untouched. You’re their first."

Evelyn arched a brow, studying them. They fidgeted, eyes darting everywhere but at her.

Claire didn’t even glance up. She lazily pointed at the one with tousled blond hair and an awkwardly endearing smile.

"Him."

The other boy looked like he might faint from relief.

###Chapter 172 Julian Mercer

The handsome model poured Claire a drink, but Evelyn swiftly intercepted the glass before it could reach her lips.

"Alcohol is so predictable," Evelyn declared with a mischievous glint in her eye. "Let's order spaghetti instead."

Claire blinked in stunned silence.

Determined to look after her friend, Evelyn flagged down a waiter and demanded their finest pasta dish.

Eclipse Lounge specialized in cocktails and bar bites, but money talked. After some negotiation and an outrageous tip, the manager reluctantly sent their chef to whip up a plate of spaghetti carbonara.

When the steaming dish arrived at their VIP booth, heads turned throughout the dimly lit establishment.

Who ordered Italian cuisine at a high-end cocktail bar?

The absurdity of the situation made their table the center of attention. Even their accompanying male model froze mid-sip, cocktail forgotten.

Claire rested her elbows on the black marble table, staring at the twirling pasta with a mixture of amusement and secondhand embarrassment. The rich aroma of garlic and parmesan clashed violently with the bar's signature lavender mist.

Julian Mercer, the dancer who'd been flirting with Claire all evening, looked genuinely concerned for their sanity. "Is this... normal for you two?"

Evelyn twirled a forkful of pasta with theatrical flair. "Darling, we invented abnormal."

Claire buried her face in her hands as nearby patrons whispered behind their drinks. The spaghetti incident would undoubtedly become tomorrow's hottest gossip among Kingsdom's elite.

Somewhere across the bar, a champagne flute shattered as someone dropped their glass in shock. Evelyn merely smirked and took another bite, thoroughly enjoying the chaos she'd created.

Claire couldn't resist reaching out to boop Evelyn's nose playfully.

"Darling, where on earth do you come up with these wild thoughts? But I adore how protective you are of me," Claire chuckled, her eyes sparkling with amusement.

Evelyn grinned mischievously before turning to the male model beside them. "Claire's craving spaghetti. Why don't you feed her?"

Claire burst into laughter, leaning forward with a teasing glint in her eyes. "Absolutely! I've never been pampered by someone this gorgeous before. Impress me, and maybe I'll keep you around longer."

"Seriously?" the guy asked, his voice a mix of surprise and hope.

He was a university student from the nearby campus, with a physique sculpted like a Greek god—the kind that made hearts race.

Yet his face held an innocent, boyish charm, creating a delicious contrast.

Every movement he made was endearingly awkward. When Claire traced her fingers over his well-defined knuckles, he ducked his head shyly, a faint blush dusting his sculpted cheekbones.

With movie-star looks like his, Claire couldn't help but prop her chin on her hand, studying him with open admiration.

"Of course I'm serious. I never lie to beautiful men. By the way, what's your name?" Claire purred.

"Julian," he answered softly.

Claire's lips curved into a slow, suggestive smile. "How about coming home with me tonight?"

Lucas Bennett had been scanning the room when a familiar laugh made him freeze.

His gaze snapped toward the sound, landing on Claire Dawson being fed spaghetti by Julian Mercer.

A sharp pang twisted in his chest. Lucas's fingers curled into fists, his jaw tightening.

Claire parted her lips, accepting the bite with a playful smirk.

Julian leaned closer, murmuring something that made Claire burst into soft laughter.

Before he could stop himself, Lucas stormed over and loomed over their table. "Claire," he bit out, voice low and dangerous. "Care to explain?"

She tilted her head up, meeting his glare with an unbothered smile.

Then, as if dismissing him, she turned back to her plate.

"Eating like this is so dull," Claire sighed dramatically, stretching back against the plush booth.

Julian's eyes flicked to Lucas before he asked, "What would make it more exciting for you, Claire?"

Her lashes fluttered as she studied Julian's lips, pretending to consider. "Hmm, what do you think?" she teased.

Julian's cheeks flushed pink. He cleared his throat, suddenly fascinated by his wineglass.

Alexander pulled Claire closer, his arms wrapping around her slender frame. His lips hovered just inches from hers, teasing the promise of a kiss.

Evelyn watched from the sidelines, her pulse quickening.

Claire was playing this game masterfully.

The tension was electrifying.

Lucas's expression darkened as he observed the scene, his jaw tightening.

###Chapter 173 Unhinged

The sight was unbearable. Lucas shoved Julian aside and yanked Claire into his embrace.

"Claire, stop this." His voice cracked with raw emotion. "You're tearing me apart."

The woman who used to adore him—how could she kiss another man right before his eyes?

A bitter taste flooded Lucas's mouth, more potent than any alcohol he'd consumed tonight.

Claire hadn't anticipated Lucas's sudden move.

His scent—whiskey and expensive cologne—clung to him.

She pressed a hand to her lips. "Ugh!"

Lucas stiffened, staring at her in disbelief.

Claire swallowed hard, forcing down the bile rising in her throat. "Lucas, you make me sick."

The words struck like a blade.

He recoiled as if physically wounded.

Claire wrenched free and slid back into the booth.

Julian picked up the abandoned spoon, his gaze never leaving her face. "Ready for another bite?"

The tension in the air was suffocating.

Lucas's fists clenched at his sides.

He couldn't accept this.

Not her.

Not with him.

The music pulsed around them, a cruel contrast to the storm inside Lucas's chest.

Claire deliberately turned away, leaning into Julian's space.

It was a silent declaration.

One that shattered whatever remained of Lucas's self-control.

Lucas seized the moment, his voice strained. "Claire, we need to talk!"

Claire's gaze was glacial, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "Can't you see I'm busy charming a gorgeous man?" Her tone dripped with disdain.

"I'm your husband!" Lucas's jaw tightened. "And you're shamelessly flirting with another man right in front of me. You—"

"If it bothers you so much, just sign the damn divorce papers," Claire snapped, cutting him off.

Lucas faltered, his words dying in his throat.

Without hesitation, Claire laced her fingers with Julian's, resting her head against his shoulder. Her fingertips traced the line of his throat, lingering on his Adam's apple. "Sweetheart," she purred, "why don't you come home with me tonight?"

The featherlight touch sent a shudder through Julian's body.

This was the first time he'd ever been this close to a woman. His pulse raced, heat creeping up his neck.

His face burned crimson as he instinctively glanced at Lucas. "But... your husband—"

"Him?" Claire laughed, cold and dismissive. "Don't waste your breath. He'll be my ex soon enough. Just a pathetic lapdog, nothing more."

Lucas's expression twisted in pain, his hands clenching at his sides.

Unable to bear seeing her degrade herself like this, he reached out abruptly, gripping her wrist. He tried to pull her away, his voice rough. "Enough."

This time, Claire was ready.

Claire swung her leg with precision, aiming straight for Lucas's vulnerable spot.

Lucas barely managed to dodge, stumbling back with a sharp inhale.

"Claire, can't we discuss this like adults?" Lucas gritted out, his voice strained.

Claire rose to her feet, closing the distance between them in three measured steps. She tilted her head, her finger curling beneath his chin with deliberate slowness.

A smirk played on her lips, but her eyes were glacial.

"Lucas, it's done. You should've gotten the papers by now. I filed for divorce," she stated coolly.

His jaw clenched. "And what if I refuse? The court won't grant it without my consent."

Claire shrugged, feigning indifference. "Fine. Stay married, then."

For a fleeting second, hope flickered in Lucas's gaze—until she turned, her fingers intertwining with Julian's.

"I'll keep him," she declared, her voice dripping with challenge. "Soon, all of Cresthaven will know I've taken a lover."

She leaned in, her breath ghosting over Lucas's ear.

"While still being your wife."

A pause. Then, softer, sharper:

"I'm going to humiliate you, Lucas. Tell me—can you handle that?"

Lucas's fists trembled at his sides. He recognized the game.

She was cornering him.

Pushing him to break first.

And damn her—it was working.

But!

How could he possibly agree?

If he gave in now, it would mean letting Claire walk away. And knowing her stubborn nature, she'd vanish from his life forever.

"Fine," Lucas bit out, his voice icy.

No one saw it coming when Lucas suddenly yanked at his tie, then dropped heavily into the booth beside her.

He snatched an untouched whiskey glass from the table and downed it in one burning gulp.

"Keep your little toy boy. I'll just sit right here and enjoy the show," Lucas drawled, his knuckles whitening around the glass.

"Lucas, have you lost your damn mind?"

"Absolutely!" Lucas slammed the glass down hard enough to crack the table. "You've driven me to insanity, Claire! Every damn thought in my head is about you!"

His outburst sent shocked silence rippling through the Eclipse Lounge.

Claire's breath caught.

She'd never seen Lucas like this—unhinged, raw, dangerous.

And the worst part?

It terrified her how much she liked seeing him come undone.


###Chapter 174 Speechless

Lucas tore off his tie with such force that the silk ripped. He flung it onto the glass table, where it slithered to the floor like a discarded serpent.

"You want the whole world to mock me, don't you?" His voice was raw, stripped of its usual composure. "Ruin my name? Fine. Have it your way."

A bitter laugh escaped him.

"From this moment on, let them whisper behind my back—'Look at that pathetic fool who lets his wife parade her lover in front of him.'"

His knuckles whitened as he gripped the edge of the table.

"I'll play the role perfectly. Smile when you flaunt him. Hell, I'll even hand you the damn condom myself if it makes you happy."

The words hung in the air, sharp as shattered glass.

"Just don’t leave me." His voice cracked. "Is that what you needed to hear?"

Claire said nothing.

She couldn’t.

This wasn’t the reaction she’d anticipated—not the cold fury, the slammed door, the immediate signing of divorce papers.

Instead, Lucas had unraveled before her eyes, revealing a desperation she’d never imagined.

And he wasn’t done.

For thirty agonizing minutes, he sat there.

Watching.

Silent as a storm gathering strength.

His gaze never wavered from Claire and Julian.

The dim lighting of the Eclipse Lounge cast flickering shadows across the table as Claire took another bite from the fork Julian held out to her. Lucas watched them with narrowed eyes, his fingers tightening around his wineglass before he drained it in one swift motion.

When Claire's fingers brushed over Julian's toned stomach, Lucas couldn't hold back a scoff. "That lanky frame of yours—do you even have abs worth touching?"

Julian's cheeks flushed pink, but he didn't back down. With a shy smile, he lifted the hem of his shirt just enough to reveal sculpted ridges of muscle, barely visible in the low light.

An unmistakable eight-pack.

"I adore you, Julian," Claire murmured, her voice dripping with affection.

She shot Lucas a triumphant smirk. "For abs like those, I'm adding an extra two hundred grand to your monthly allowance."

Julian ducked his head, feigning modesty. "Two hundred thousand? That's... excessive, don't you think?"

"Not at all," Claire purred, looping an arm around his neck. "My husband is filthy rich. He'll cover it."

Lucas was rendered utterly speechless.

Paying to fund his wife's boy toy—had any man in Cresthaven ever sunk this low?

Around them, amused whispers rippled through the crowd. After all, just days ago, Claire had hosted an extravagant party at—

The Eclipse Lounge was a magnet for the city's elite, where wealth dripped from every corner like liquid gold.

Evelyn Carter shifted uncomfortably in her seat, her fingers tightening around her glass as she watched the scene unfold. The tension was suffocating.

She excused herself, murmuring something about needing the restroom.

But fate had other plans.

The moment she stepped out, she collided with a familiar presence—Ethan Caldwell.

He emerged from the men’s restroom across from her, a cigarette perched lazily between his lips, the faint scent of whiskey clinging to him.

Their eyes met briefly before Evelyn averted her gaze, her pulse betraying her.

Ethan had noticed her the second she left the booth.

He’d been nursing his drink in the shadows, watching from afar, unwilling to intrude.

The confrontation between Lucas Bennett and Claire Dawson had been impossible to miss.

The entitled heirs around them sneered, relishing the spectacle—a man of Lucas’s standing, humiliated in front of his wife, yet refusing to retaliate.

But Ethan couldn’t bring himself to laugh.

For the first time, he understood Lucas’s silence.

When Evelyn slipped away, something primal tugged at him, urging him to follow.

And now here they were.

The air between them crackled with unspoken words.

He had stooped so low as to orchestrate a fake run-in with her.

At this point, he realized he might be just as unhinged as Lucas.


When Evelyn completely disregarded him and walked past, Ethan instinctively called out.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice sharp.

She halted mid-step. Turning slowly, she walked back toward him with deliberate calm.

Without warning, she reached up and delivered a firm smack to the top of his head. "Mind your manners. I'm your aunt," she said coolly.

The sidewalk was crowded, making her action a blatant public humiliation.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly, his jaw tightening with barely contained fury.

###Chapter 175 Insolence

The bathroom door swung open, and Nathan stepped out, his gaze lazily drifting toward Ethan.

"Aunt Evelyn, he's being insolent," Nathan drawled, a smirk playing on his lips. "He dares to address you so casually. Unlike me—I know my manners."

Evelyn gave a slow, approving nod, as if bestowing wisdom upon a child. "I’ll reward your politeness with a gift this Christmas."

Nathan shot Ethan a triumphant look. "Hear that? Aunt Evelyn’s getting me something special."

Ethan’s expression darkened, his eyes sharp with disdain. "Are you seriously bragging about a Christmas gift like a child? Who’s the elder here—you or her?"

Nathan scoffed, unfazed. "I’m a grown man. What’s wrong with appreciating a thoughtful gesture? Respect isn’t about age—it’s about courtesy."

He leaned in slightly, his smirk widening. "Besides, with that attitude, even if you begged, she wouldn’t give you a thing. Face it—you’re just jealous."

Ethan let out a derisive laugh. "Jealous? Of you? Don’t flatter yourself."

But Nathan had a way of needling under people’s skin. The tension between them thickened, Ethan’s glare turning stormier by the second.

"If you're not jealous, then why are you still arguing with me?" Alexander challenged, his lips curling into that infuriating smirk.

Even Evelyn, who had been silently observing, had to admit—the man was insufferably good at verbal sparring. He never lost.

Vanessa's voice cut through the tension as she approached. "What's going on here?"

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. "And here comes the second person with zero respect for her elders," she muttered under her breath.

She turned to leave, but Vanessa called after her.

"Mom and Dad want you home. They're expecting you for dinner tomorrow," Vanessa announced.

Ever since the news broke about Evelyn and Alexander's marriage registration, Richard and Margaret had been relentless. Calls. Texts.

Evelyn had ignored them all, but the messages kept coming.

[You married Alexander Whitmore? When are you bringing him home?]

Variations of that same demand flooded her inbox daily.

She didn’t need to be a genius to guess their motives.

Alexander Whitmore was the formidable CEO of Titan Capital Group, a man whose influence could move mountains. Now that he was Evelyn Carter's husband, Richard Hayes saw an opportunity he couldn't ignore.

Under normal circumstances, securing a meeting with Alexander required scheduling weeks in advance through his assistant. Even then, approval wasn't guaranteed.

But now?

Richard could barely contain his glee.

All he had to do was frame it as a simple family dinner, and Evelyn would bring Alexander without the usual corporate formalities.

Evelyn, however, had long since seen through their schemes.

She blocked both Richard and Vanessa Hart’s numbers without hesitation.

Just as she began enjoying a few peaceful days, Vanessa reappeared as their messenger.

"Fine," Evelyn said coldly. "You want me to come home? Have you prepared the paperwork to transfer Hawthorne Estate into my name?"

Vanessa’s expression froze at the mention of the estate.

That day, Evelyn had made a bet with Richard.

If she married Alexander Whitmore, Richard would sign over the Hawthorne Estate—their grandfather’s prized property—from Vanessa’s name to hers.

Vanessa hadn’t expected Evelyn to still be holding onto that demand.

Her eyes darkened with irritation.

Vanessa's face flushed crimson.

"You and Oliver both hold 8% shares in Horizon Enterprises. I have this house, and you still want to take it from me?" Her voice shook with barely contained fury.

Evelyn didn't even dignify Vanessa's theatrics with a response.

"If it were yours, taking it would be theft."

Her tone was ice-cold, sharp enough to cut through steel.

"But since it's rightfully mine, reclaiming it is simply justice. Do you understand now?"

The mocking lilt in Evelyn's words made Vanessa's fists clench at her sides.

Without another word, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode away, leaving Vanessa standing there, trembling with rage.

The air between them crackled with unspoken threats.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms.

This wasn't over.

Not by a long shot.

###Chapter 176 Hawthorne Estate

Vanessa gripped Ethan's sleeve with trembling fingers. Her gaze followed Evelyn's retreating figure, tears spilling down her flushed cheeks.

"Ethan, look at her," Vanessa whispered hoarsely. "Evelyn's determined to strip me of everything. Even Grandfather's estate—she wants to take it from me."

Ethan gave her hand a reassuring squeeze but remained silent, his jaw tight.

Swiping at her tears, Vanessa turned to him with desperate eyes. "If I have to fight Evelyn for the house... whose side will you take?"

His frown deepened. "Vanessa, how could you even ask? You know I stand with you."

The words eased the tightness in her chest—just a fraction.

Ryan's mocking voice cut through the moment. "Face it, Vanessa. You're the outsider here. That estate was always meant for Evelyn, and you stole it."

A flash of guilt crossed Vanessa's face before she snapped, "I am not an outsider! My name is Hart—I belong in this family!" Her nails dug into her palms. "The house was given to me. By my father."

For years, the label outsider had haunted her.

Not knowing her birth parents, she had clawed her way into the Hayes family's favor—

The fact that Evelyn was born into nobility made her far more favored by the Hayes family than Vanessa.

"Tsk, tsk! Wasn't the estate your grandfather's? What does it have to do with your father?"

Ryan shook his head, unwilling to waste another breath arguing with her.

The louder she protested, the more obvious her guilt became.

Ryan saw right through it.

Meanwhile, Claire had finished enjoying herself and was preparing to leave.

Vanessa had initially assumed Claire’s comment about keeping Julian was just a petty jab meant to irritate Lucas.

But after the event, Claire actually took Julian home—right under Lucas’s nose.

Vanessa drove, with Claire in the passenger seat and Julian in the back.

A quick glance in the rearview mirror confirmed Lucas’s Lamborghini tailing them closely.

Two luxury cars moved in tandem down the road, other vehicles instinctively giving them a wide berth.

In the darkness, the Lamborghini’s headlights burned like Lucas’s furious glare. Vanessa could practically picture him slamming his fist against the steering wheel in frustration.

Evelyn stole a glance at Claire in the passenger seat.

Claire suddenly pressed a hand to her mouth, her face paling as she dry-heaved.

"I might have overeaten," Claire murmured, forcing an apologetic smile. She rolled down the window slightly, letting the crisp air soothe the queasiness twisting in her stomach.

Her gaze flickered to the backseat, where Julian sat stiffly, his hands folded neatly in his lap. His eyes remained fixed straight ahead, as if afraid to let them wander.

He was the picture of perfect manners.

Curious, Claire tilted her head. "How did you end up modeling? You don’t strike me as the type to dive into that world. Those women can be ruthless."

Julian didn’t seem like someone who coasted by on charm alone.

What stood out most was his refined demeanor. Earlier, when he had fed her, Claire noticed how meticulous he was—almost fastidious.

After every sip she took, he had gently dabbed the corners of her mouth with a napkin, careful not to smudge her lipstick. His movements were patient, deliberate, without a trace of irritation.

At her question, Julian stiffened. His head dipped slightly, a shadow of discomfort flickering across his face, as if she had touched a nerve.

His lips pressed into a thin line. His fingers, resting on his knees, curled faintly into fists.

His bloodshot eyes lifted to meet hers, glistening with unshed tears that tugged at the heartstrings of anyone who saw him.

The sight of Julian Mercer like this made Claire Dawson feel an unexpected pang of guilt, as though she had committed some unforgivable sin.

His face was achingly pure, the kind of beauty that belonged in Renaissance paintings. The tears clinging to his lashes only amplified his delicate, almost fragile aura—like a porcelain doll on the verge of shattering.

###Chapter 177 Financial Struggles

Claire suddenly realized why men couldn’t resist women’s tears.

It wasn’t about gender at all!

She had zero resistance to Julian’s tears either!

The real issue was his face!

"Hey, don’t cry. If you need money, I’ll give it to you. I can’t handle seeing gorgeous guys upset," Claire said, her voice softening.

She quickly grabbed a tissue from her purse and offered it to Julian.

Julian tilted his head slightly, his jaw tightening as he fought back tears. "Thanks, but I’m a man. I don’t need tissues," he muttered stubbornly.

Why did that make him even more endearing?

Evelyn leaned in, her voice gentle. "Julian, do you have younger siblings?"

Julian blinked in surprise, his gaze flickering to her. "How did you guess?"

"You were so patient feeding Claire earlier. It felt like you’ve done that before," Evelyn observed.

Julian exhaled, his shoulders relaxing slightly. "Yeah. I’m the oldest. Two little sisters and a brother."

His voice carried the weight of responsibility, and Claire’s heart squeezed.

She hadn’t expected this side of him—vulnerable yet proud.

Evelyn exchanged a knowing glance with Claire before speaking again. "That explains a lot."

Julian wiped at his eyes with the back of his hand, refusing the tissue again. "I don’t usually ask for help," he admitted quietly.

Claire reached out, hesitating before resting a hand on his arm. "Sometimes, you have to."

Julian’s lips quirked into a half-smile, though his eyes still shimmered. "Guess so."

The air between them shifted, something unspoken passing between them.

Claire made a decision.

"Tell me how much you need," she said firmly.

Julian hesitated, then sighed. "It’s not just about the money. It’s… complicated."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Try us."

Julian looked between them, conflict flashing in his gaze.

Then, finally, he spoke.

The car's air conditioning hummed softly as Evelyn studied Julian's tense profile. "Why do you need so much money?" she pressed.

His fingers tightened around his knees. "My father... He's deep in gambling debts." A bitter laugh escaped him. "If we don't pay, he's going to sell my sisters."

Claire stiffened beside Evelyn. "Sell them?"

Julian's throat worked as he nodded. "They're fourteen and fifteen. He's arranged marriages for them—some middle-aged farmers in the countryside who'll treat them like breeding stock." His voice cracked. "They haven't even finished school."

Evelyn's stomach turned. This wasn't just tragic—it was archaic.

"You expect us to believe that?" Claire's skepticism sliced through the silence.

Evelyn understood the doubt. In their world, sob stories were currency. But the raw shame flashing across Julian's face felt too visceral to fake.

His head snapped up, eyes blazing. "You think I'd invent something like this?" He wrenched at his seatbelt, hands shaking. "Forget it. I'll find another way."

The click of the buckle releasing punctuated his words. His pride was a living thing, coiled tight in the set of his jaw, the way his teeth sank into his bottom lip.

Evelyn caught his wrist. "Wait."

Julian froze. Up close, she could see the faint scar above his eyebrow, the way his pulse jumped under her fingers. Not a seasoned manipulator—just a desperate kid out of options.

Claire exhaled sharply. "Even if it's true, how much are we talking?"

Julian swallowed. "Enough to buy their freedom." His whisper was barely audible. "And mine."

The unspoken truth hung between them: once his father got his hands on that money, Julian would be next on the auction block.

The words tumbled out before he could stop them. "Why are you making such a big deal? How much do you actually need?"

Julian's voice was barely above a whisper. "Th-thirty thousand dollars..."

Claire's eyebrows shot up in disbelief. "You're selling yourself for that?"

In their elite world, thirty grand was pocket change—a single designer handbag, a night out at Eclipse Lounge, the monthly maintenance fee for Willowbrook Apartments.

Yet here it was, the sum that could save two innocent girls and break Julian.

For the first time, Claire understood money's true weight—not as a status symbol, but as a lifeline.

Julian flinched. When Claire called it "that amount," his shoulders hunched further. Was thirty thousand really insignificant?

His fingers twisted the cheap fabric of his shirt. Ragged nails left crescent marks in the material. Shame burned through him like acid.

Evelyn stepped closer. "Claire can cover it. She'll settle your debt later..."

She recognized that hollow look in Julian's eyes.

It reminded her of Richard Hayes' adopted son—the one who'd gamble away his paycheck then come screaming for more. When her adoptive mother Cassandra couldn't pay, he'd left bruises shaped like poker chips on her wrists.

The car hummed softly as the city lights blurred past the windows. Shadows danced across Julian's face, his expression unreadable.

Claire kept her eyes on the road, but she could feel the weight of his silence.

Julian had grown up in hell. His mother, unable to vent her rage on the man who abandoned her, had taken it all out on him instead.

Bruises had been his childhood companions. Broken skin, broken bones—until the Hayes family finally intervened.

Richard and Margaret Hayes weren’t exactly warm, but at least they didn’t leave him bleeding.

Claire smiled, her grip tightening on the steering wheel. "Yes, Julian. I'll keep you. You won’t have to worry about money anymore."

Julian exhaled slowly, his fingers tapping restlessly against his knee.

The neon glow of passing signs flickered over his sharp features. He studied Claire’s profile, hesitation warring with something darker in his gaze.

Then, voice low, he asked the question burning between them.

"Claire… if you keep me, does that mean you’re going to sleep with me?"

###Chapter 178 Tension

Evelyn was stunned.

Her fingers trembled on the steering wheel, nearly sending the car careening into the guardrail.

Thankfully, she hadn’t been speeding. With a sharp inhale, she steadied the wheel just in time.

"This boy… is hopelessly naive."

Claire laughed, her striking eyes locked onto Julian’s face. "Well?" she prompted.

Julian lowered his gaze, silent. But the flush creeping up his neck betrayed him.

No one could guess what images were playing in his mind.

The car rolled into the garage, and they all stepped out.

The trio entered the elevator. Just as the doors began to slide shut, a hand shot out, stopping them. Lucas slipped inside.

At that exact moment, Claire and Julian’s fingers were tightly intertwined.

Lucas’s gaze dropped to their joined hands, his eyes narrowing dangerously.

Without a word, he seized Claire’s other hand.

Now, three grown adults stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the cramped space.

The air crackled with unspoken tension as Evelyn hesitated near the staircase. Part of her wanted to flee upstairs, pack her things, and bid Claire a quiet farewell.

But Claire, sharp as ever, seemed to read her thoughts. "I'm still recovering," she snapped, her voice laced with warning. "Don't even think about leaving!"

Evelyn wasn't the only one feeling the weight of the moment. Even Claire, usually unshakable, found the situation unbearably charged.

Having Evelyn by her side gave her strength. Without her, facing two men at once would have been downright unbearable.

They all filed into the apartment, Lucas lingering at the back.

Claire moved to shut him out, but Lucas shoved past her, his expression unreadable.

The apartment had two bedrooms. The second Lucas stepped inside, Claire grabbed Julian's arm and tugged him toward the master suite.

"From now on, you're staying with me in here," she declared.

Julian, overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, hesitated. His movements were stiff, his usual confidence replaced by wariness.

Before he could respond, Lucas seized Claire's wrist.

Without a word, he dragged her into the master bedroom and slammed the door shut behind them, locking it with a decisive click.

Claire's temper flared. "Lucas, have you lost your damn mind?" she hissed.

Lucas pulled Claire closer, his arms locking around her waist like iron bands.

His usually vibrant eyes were dull, drowning in despair. A heavy sorrow clung to him, suffocating the air between them.

"Claire, I messed up. Don't walk away from me…" His voice cracked, raw with regret.

He had assumed this was just another one of her games—another attempt to provoke him.

But seeing her with another man in their home shattered his composure completely.

Claire tilted her head up. A hot tear from Lucas splashed against her cheek, tracing a burning path down her skin.

She wiped it away with an irritated flick of her fingers and shoved against his chest. "It's over, Lucas. You think crying like this will make me—"

His mouth crashed onto hers, swallowing the rest of her words.

The kiss was desperate, possessive. He kissed her like he wanted to erase every inch of space between them, like he could fuse them together if he just held on tight enough.

Claire struggled, fury igniting in her veins. With a sharp snap of her teeth, she bit down on his tongue.

Lucas flinched but didn’t pull away. Instead, he deepened the kiss, his grip tightening. The metallic tang of blood bloomed between them.

A broken, muffled sob escaped him, vibrating against her lips.

"If you hate me, then hurt me. But why did you have to—"

"You. How could you be so heartless?" Lucas Bennett's voice cracked, his words thick with unshed tears.

Tears streaked down his face, glistening under the dim light.

Claire Dawson had never witnessed him break like this before.

The moment his tears touched her skin, a wave of irritation surged through her.

She pushed him away roughly, scrubbing at her face and lips where he had kissed her moments ago.

"Now you regret it? Lucas, I gave you every chance!"

"Heartless? Look in the mirror! How dare you question why I ended the pregnancy?"

"Do you honestly believe you deserve to be a father? It wasn’t me who destroyed our baby, Lucas. It was you! You killed our child!"

Her words hung in the air like a blade, sharp and final.

The silence between them was deafening.

Lucas staggered back as if struck, his face twisting in agony.

Claire turned away, her chest heaving with fury and grief.

She wouldn’t let him see her cry.

Not again.

Not ever.

The past was dead.

And so was any future they might have had.

###Chapter 179 Psychological Scars

"How dare you even think about kissing me? Do you think you have the right?" Claire's voice trembled with fury. "Your hands are drenched in our child's blood. Every time I look at you, I want to rip you apart! Just get out of here!"

Her emotions spiraled out of control. The moment the words left her lips, she doubled over, clutching her stomach as if the pain were physical. She curled into herself, her body shaking.

Tears streamed down her face, leaving glistening trails. It was impossible to tell whether her agony stemmed from grief or pure, unbridled rage toward Lucas. But one thing was certain—her expression was twisted in torment.

Lucas's breath hitched at the sight. He dropped to his knees, reaching for her.

"What's wrong? Are you in pain? I'm taking you to the hospital!" His voice was frantic.

Claire's teeth sank into his arm with brutal force, as if she wanted to tear through muscle and bone.

Lucas hissed, his body tensing from the sharp sting.

A thin line of crimson trickled from the corner of Claire's lips—his blood.

The red droplets smeared across her cheek, mixing with her tears. Her hair was tangled, her face streaked with grief and fury.

The air between them thickened with sorrow, heavy and suffocating.

Her knuckles turned bone-white from the crushing grip on the sheets.

Fragile as glass, she looked ready to splinter apart any second.

Lucas's chest constricted with a visceral ache. Words lodged in his throat, useless and suffocating.

Claire's lips parted, the faintest whisper escaping.

"Go."

Beyond the door, Evelyn's frantic knocking shattered the silence.

"Lucas, stop this! Can't you see she's in no state for this?" Evelyn's voice trembled with urgency. "Whatever you have to say, it can wait."

She knew.

These past nights, Evelyn had watched Claire jolt awake, drenched in silent tears.

The nightmares came relentlessly.

No amount of forced smiles could hide the truth—the real wounds weren't visible.

They festered beneath the surface, deep where no bandage could reach.

That's why Evelyn refused to leave.

Not until the storm inside her best friend finally stilled.

Lucas stepped out. His crimson eyes burned with unspoken fury.

Blood trickled down his forearm, staining his sleeve. Claire had sunk her teeth deep, leaving a vicious mark that still throbbed.

Evelyn barely spared him a glance before darting past to reach her friend. "Claire, are you okay?"

Claire gave a weak shake of her head. "Just exhausted. Need to sleep," she murmured.

"Then rest. I'll take care of you."

"But my makeup—"

"I'll remove it for you," Evelyn assured her.

She hurried into the bathroom, grabbing a pack of cleansing wipes. Gently, she began wiping away the smudged mascara and foundation from Claire's pale face.

"You're too good to me," Claire mumbled, her voice thick with drowsiness. "Ditch Alexander. Move in with me instead."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Giving up on your boy toy already?"

Claire blinked, suddenly alert. "Wait—where is Julian?"

"Sent him to grab snacks. Figured you'd want something later."

A sharp click echoed through the apartment. The front door shut with finality. Lucas was gone.

The silence in the room was suffocating.

Claire’s lashes trembled before she finally shut her eyes. She sank deeper into the mattress, pressing the back of her hand against her eyelids.

After everything that had happened today, Lucas would surely leave her alone now.

There was nothing left to say. He should walk away for good.

Yet, her chest ached as if a boulder had settled over her heart. She should have felt free—so why did relief refuse to come?

A sharp sting burned behind her eyes. Two scalding tears slipped free, tracing hot paths down her temples.

She despised this weakness. What right did she have to cry? It was just a divorce.

A new beginning. She should be celebrating.

"You’re free now," she reminded herself.

Claire forced her lips to curve, but the smile twisted into something brittle—uglier than the tears she fought.

###Chapter 180 The Healing Touch

Evelyn's gaze softened with concern. "You don't have to pretend with me, Claire. Not here."

She didn’t want Claire spiraling into dark thoughts, so she quickly shifted the subject. "You seemed pale earlier. Are you certain you don’t need medical attention?"

"I’m fine," Claire insisted.

Seeing her stubbornness, Evelyn didn’t push further. After carefully removing Claire’s makeup, she gently pressed her fingers against Claire’s wrist.

Claire’s brows lifted in surprise. "Wait—you can read pulses?"

Evelyn nodded. "Before the Hayes family took me in, I apprenticed under a village healer. Pulse diagnosis isn’t my strongest skill, but my medical acupuncture? That, I mastered."

Her knowledge of acupuncture had saved Alexander once. She’d stabilized the bleeding from his artery just in time—a miracle that kept him alive.

Claire blinked. "If you’re skilled in acupuncture, why haven’t you used it all these years?"

At the question, Evelyn’s expression darkened. Her gaze dropped to her hands.

Claire noticed the shift in Evelyn's expression and leaned forward, her voice laced with concern. "Did something terrible happen?"

Evelyn swallowed hard before answering. "I took a life with my own hands."

Claire's breath hitched.

Ten years ago, on a quiet evening walk home, Evelyn had stumbled upon a young boy collapsed by the roadside, gasping for air in the throes of an asthma attack.

With no time to wait for an ambulance, she had acted on instinct—using her knowledge of medical acupuncture to stabilize him.

But when she called the hospital later that night, the news shattered her.

The boy hadn’t survived.

The guilt carved itself deep into her soul, an unhealed wound that never truly scabbed over.

She had replayed that moment endlessly, agonizing over what she could have done differently.

The Hayes family had known.

Rumors whispered that the boy’s mother had wanted justice, but Richard had intervened—silencing the outcry with a hefty payout.

Evelyn’s return to the Hawthorne Estate should have been a celebration.

Instead, it became a funeral for her reputation.

Richard and Margaret saw her as a curse—a bad omen who had bled the family dry on her very first day back.

Vanessa, ever the opportunist, had sneered, "Evelyn, I told you not to play doctor without a license. Now look what you’ve done."

Vanessa had never mentioned this before.

In truth, when Evelyn performed the acupuncture, Vanessa had been right beside her, clutching the needle case.

Evelyn didn’t hold a medical license. But in their village, healers were as common as wildflowers.

Every villager had their own remedies, and the physician who taught Evelyn was the most respected for leagues. She had mastered nearly all of his techniques.

So, when that little boy collapsed from an asthma attack, Evelyn hadn’t hesitated. She reached for her needles with steady hands.

After the tragedy, Margaret snatched the acupuncture kit and hurled it into the fire. Her voice was steel. "Never again."

From that moment, Evelyn abandoned the craft she had loved for over a decade.

Claire listened, her expression softening with pity. "Could it be... the boy died from something else entirely? Not your needles?"

"That’s what I believed—until his mother shoved the autopsy report in my face," Evelyn whispered.

Claire leaned forward. "What did it say?"

"It stated there’s a forbidden point for asthma patients. And the mark was there." Evelyn’s hands trembled. "But I didn’t touch it. It was chaos—maybe I—"

She broke off, a chilling realization dawning.

Claire’s eyes widened. "Wait. Vanessa was holding your kit that day."

Evelyn went very still. "You think... she planted that mark?"

The air between them turned icy.

###Chapter 181 Malicious Girl

Claire nodded sharply. "Consider this. You trained under master practitioners for years. A rookie mistake like that? Impossible. And Vanessa was standing right beside you that day. If she didn't sabotage you, who else could have?"

Evelyn stayed quiet. All these years, she'd refused to believe the worst in people.

First, she'd just been welcomed back into the Hayes family. She and Vanessa had no history, no prior clashes. That gala was their first real interaction.

Second, Vanessa had been barely fifteen then. To plot something so vile—to take a life just to ruin hers? The idea seemed too monstrous to entertain.

Evelyn had always assumed their rivalry was petty, surface-level. She never imagined Vanessa could harbor such darkness.

"She framed you for a crime you didn’t commit and landed you in prison for three years," Claire pointed out, voice hardening. "Tell me, Evelyn, what lines wouldn’t she cross?"

Claire’s lips thinned. "You’re too decent to fathom how twisted her mind is. But for someone like Vanessa? There are no limits. Only your inability to imagine them."

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms.

Was it really Vanessa?

The doubt coiled like a serpent in her chest.

Memories resurfaced—Vanessa’s sweet smile that night, the way she’d "comforted" Evelyn afterward, whispering false sympathy while the police dragged her away.

A chill slithered down Evelyn’s spine.

Claire leaned in. "You need to face the truth. That girl? She’s poison."

Evelyn exhaled slowly.

For the first time, she let herself consider the unthinkable.

What if Claire was right?

What if Vanessa had always been this cruel?

"Perhaps we should leave now," Evelyn murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

Claire reached out, her fingers gently encircling Evelyn's wrist. "With your exceptional acupuncture skills, it would be such a waste not to use them," she encouraged with a warm smile.

Evelyn's lips curved upward as she repositioned her fingers against Claire's pulse point. Suddenly, her eyes widened in shock.

"Claire, you..." Evelyn's voice trailed off, her expression unreadable.

"What is it?" Claire teased, her smile playful. "Did you discover something interesting?"

Evelyn's gaze slowly dropped to Claire's abdomen. Following her friend's line of sight, Claire looked down at her own stomach.

A heavy silence settled between them, thick with unspoken realization.

The quiet was abruptly shattered by the sound of the front door opening.

Julian had returned.

That evening, Julian was given the guest bedroom. When morning light filtered through the curtains, Evelyn awoke to find an elaborate breakfast spread across the dining table.

Julian emerged from the kitchen, an apron tied around his waist. His slender fingers carefully balanced the edge of a porcelain plate.

Hearing Evelyn's footsteps, he turned his head instinctively. The morning sunlight caught the sharp angles of his face, highlighting the faint traces of exhaustion around his eyes.

"Sleep well?" he asked, his voice still rough from sleep. Without waiting for an answer, he gestured toward the table. "I thought you might be hungry."

Evelyn's eyes scanned the assortment of dishes - freshly baked croissants, a bowl of mixed berries, and what appeared to be homemade granola. The scent of freshly brewed coffee filled the air.

"You didn't have to do all this," Evelyn said, though her stomach betrayed her with an audible growl.

Julian merely shrugged, a small smile playing at his lips. "Consider it repayment for letting me crash here." He paused, then added, "Besides, cooking helps me think."

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond when Claire's bedroom door creaked open. Both turned to see her standing in the doorway, one hand resting protectively over her stomach.

The unspoken tension from the previous night returned, heavier than before. Julian's gaze flickered between the two women, sensing the shift in atmosphere but saying nothing.

Claire approached the table with deliberate slowness. "Something smells amazing," she commented, though her voice lacked its usual energy.

Julian pulled out a chair for her. "Sit. You look like you could use a proper meal."

As Claire settled into the seat, Evelyn noticed the slight tremor in her friend's hands. The morning light revealed dark circles beneath Claire's eyes that hadn't been there yesterday.

The three of them sat in uneasy silence, the clinking of silverware against porcelain the only sound in the room. Outside, a bird began its morning song, oblivious to the tension thickening the air inside.

Evelyn opened her mouth to speak, but the words died on her lips when Claire suddenly pushed back her chair with a sharp scrape.

"I think I'm going to be sick," Claire gasped, one hand flying to her mouth as she bolted for the bathroom.

The remaining two exchanged a loaded glance. Julian's eyebrows drew together in concern. "Should I...?"

Evelyn was already on her feet. "I've got this," she said, though her voice lacked conviction.

As she hurried after her friend, Evelyn couldn't shake the growing sense that their lives were about to change in ways none of them were prepared for.

"Is Claire still asleep?" Lucas asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Evelyn nodded, stirring her coffee absentmindedly. "She rarely wakes up early. You really don’t have to go through so much trouble with breakfast every morning."

Julian merely smiled in response before disappearing into the kitchen to grab two sets of utensils.

Last night, when Claire had suggested letting Julian stay, everyone knew it was just to get under Lucas’s skin. Evelyn hadn’t thought much of it at the time.

But now, watching Julian move quietly around the kitchen, she realized it might actually be good for Claire to have someone like him around.

Evelyn glanced at the clock. It was a weekday. She remembered Julian mentioning he was a student.

Curious, she tilted her head. "Don’t you have classes today?"

Julian’s hands stilled for a moment before he lowered his gaze. "I… took a leave of absence," he admitted softly.

Evelyn didn’t press further, but the pieces clicked into place.

With his father’s gambling debts hanging over him, Julian had no choice but to put his education on hold.

"What were you studying?" she asked instead.

"Medicine," Julian answered, his voice steady despite the weight of the word.

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Were you good at it?"

The corner of Julian’s mouth lifted slightly, but his eyes remained shadowed. "Top of my class."

Evelyn exhaled slowly, struck by the unfairness of it all.

She took another sip of her coffee, watching as Julian set the table with quiet precision.

Maybe fate had brought him here for a reason.

"They're... managing," Julian murmured, his voice laced with hesitation.

Evelyn gave a slow nod. "I'll speak to Claire later and arrange for her to send you an advance." Her tone softened, though her gaze remained firm. "But don't hand it all over to your father at once."

Money given too easily loses its worth. And for a gambler? It only feeds the addiction, making the future bleeder.

She knew this truth intimately. She'd witnessed it play out before.

Julian dipped his head in agreement. "I won't."

In a hurry, Evelyn finished the last few bites of her breakfast before snatching up her bag and heading out.

As she walked, her thoughts lingered on Julian. It would be such a waste for him to abandon his studies now, especially when he was so close to graduating.

But since Claire was the one funding his education and looking after him, it was only right that she be the one to ensure he stayed on track.

The morning air was crisp as Evelyn stepped into the bustling streets of Cresthaven. The city hummed with energy, but her mind was elsewhere.

She couldn't shake the unease coiling in her stomach.

Something about Julian’s situation felt too familiar—like history threatening to repeat itself.

She quickened her pace.

First, work. Then, she’d deal with the rest.

But the thought nagged at her.

Would Claire really be enough to keep Julian from falling into the same trap?

Or was this just the beginning of another downward spiral?
###Chapter 182 The Performance

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the office, she quickly texted Claire with the latest update.

Claire responded with a simple thumbs-up emoji.

Natalie approached Evelyn’s desk with a warm smile. "Evelyn, the annual gala is just around the corner. Have you been keeping up with your cello practice?"

She tilted her head slightly. "Have you picked a piece yet? I think there’s a cello in the music room downstairs. Want to practice together during lunch?"

Evelyn blinked, momentarily stunned.

She had nearly forgotten about her performance at the company event.

Her own cello wasn’t at her apartment—she’d have to borrow the one at Titan Capital.

Then again, if memory served, her old cello was still tucked away at Hawthorne Estate.

Just as she was lost in thought, her phone buzzed.

It was Margaret, calling from the housekeeper’s line.

"I went to the farmer’s market at dawn and made all your favorites," Margaret said warmly. "Darling, why don’t you bring Alexander home for lunch today?"

Margaret Hayes had once treated Evelyn like a sworn enemy. But now that Evelyn was married to Alexander Whitmore, Margaret couldn't wait to butter her up.

Evelyn found it laughable. Her fingers hovered over the "end call" button—until she remembered she still needed to retrieve her cello from Hawthorne Estate.

"Fine. Around noon, then? I'll stop by," Evelyn said flatly.

Margaret nearly squealed with delight when Evelyn agreed. "Perfect! We'll be waiting. And don’t forget to bring Alexander with you!"

The moment the call ended, Margaret was already dialing Richard Hayes in a frenzy.

"Drop everything and come home! Who cares about signing contracts? Evelyn is bringing Alexander for lunch—"

"Yes, together. A single word from him could make us millions. Why waste time on paperwork? Hurry back before they arrive!"

Hanging up, Margaret tapped her chin. This was Alexander’s first visit. They had to put on a convincing performance.

She sank into the couch and dialed Vanessa Hart next. "Vanessa, bring Ethan home for lunch today."

A brief silence. Then—

"Is Evelyn coming?" Vanessa asked, voice sharp.

"Yes," Margaret said, satisfaction dripping from her tone. "And she’s bringing Alexander."

Vanessa's fingers tightened around her teacup, her knuckles turning white.

"Evelyn clearly has it out for me," she said, her voice trembling with barely concealed anger. "Last night, I invited her, but she refused outright. She even had the nerve to claim the house we live in is hers—threatening to throw us all out!"

"How dare she!"

Margaret's face darkened instantly, her lips pressing into a thin line. "If that ungrateful girl dares bring this up when she arrives, I'll make sure she never shows her face in front of Alexander again!"

In Margaret's eyes, Evelyn's marriage to Alexander was nothing but a shameless ploy. She should be groveling, not making demands.

By noon, the Hayes family had gathered in the grand living room, waiting in tense silence.

The clock struck 12:30. Still, no sign of Evelyn or Alexander.

Richard's expression soured. "What's the meaning of this? Where are they?"

Margaret pursed her lips. "I'll call them. Maybe they're stuck in traffic."

Vanessa leaned closer to Ethan, her voice dripping with false concern. "I'm so sorry, Ethan. I know you're busy with that important deal. I hate that we're wasting your time waiting for Evelyn."

Ethan had been swamped lately, barely able to spare a moment for her.

Her fingers brushed his sleeve, lingering just a second too long.

His jaw tightened, but he didn’t pull away.

The air in the room grew heavier with each passing minute.

Where were they?

Vanessa's words hung in the air as she turned to Richard with calculated innocence. "Father, Ethan rushed here straight from Titan Capital Group after my call. The roads were clear—strange, isn't it? Unless Evelyn hasn't left yet?"

The implication struck like a blade. Richard's face darkened, his grip tightening on the armrest.

Did his daughter truly believe Alexander Whitmore's name was a shield for her defiance?

###Chapter 183 Fury

Evelyn's phone call had ended, and Margaret returned to the dining room with a frown. "She claims she's occupied this afternoon and can only visit after work."

"This is unacceptable!" Richard's palm struck the table with a sharp crack. "She keeps inventing reasons to avoid coming home. If she has no intention of returning, then she shouldn't bother at all!"

Vanessa didn’t hesitate to add fuel to the fire. "Is Evelyn truly busier than Ethan? He managed to make time for us. The least she could have done was call in advance. Now we’ve wasted our afternoon waiting for nothing. Let’s just eat."

With that, Vanessa reached for the serving spoon, her attention fixed on Ethan as she prepared to dish out his portion.

But Ethan caught her wrist gently. "Since they won’t arrive until evening, I should return to the office. There’s still work to be done."

Vanessa blinked in surprise. "Ethan, at least stay for lunch first."

"No need." He shrugged on his suit jacket, which had been draped over the chair.

After a polite nod to Richard and Margaret, he turned on his heel and strode toward the door.

Vanessa followed him out, watching as his car disappeared down the driveway before returning to the table in silence.

Margaret studied her stepdaughter’s expression, sensing something amiss. "Vanessa, did you and Ethan—"

Ethan's demeanor toward Vanessa was noticeably distant.

Vanessa shook her head quickly. "We didn't argue, Mom. Haven't you realized? Evelyn stood him up—made him come all this way for nothing. He's irritated because his schedule is packed, yet she couldn’t even bother to show up."

Margaret's annoyance toward Evelyn deepened at those words.

Keeping everyone waiting for hours without so much as a call?

Alexander hadn’t stepped foot in the office all day.

But Simon did appear around noon.

He strode straight into Alexander’s office, gathered two files, and slid them into a leather briefcase before handing it to Evelyn.

"Mrs. Whitmore, these are the documents Mr. Whitmore requested. Would you mind delivering them to him at home?" Simon asked politely.

The office was nearly empty, most employees having left for lunch.

Hearing that Alexander was still at home, Evelyn frowned. "Is something wrong? Did he skip work because he wasn’t feeling well?"

"Nothing serious. He just overindulged last night with Mr. Bennett," Simon explained.

"Lucas Bennett?" Evelyn repeated.

Simon nodded.

After being thrown out by Claire last night, Lucas had clearly been in a foul mood. He'd dragged Alexander out drinking until dawn.

Evelyn clutched the files tightly as she hurried home.

The house was eerily silent when she arrived. She placed the documents carefully on Alexander's desk in the study.

He was still asleep.

She didn't disturb him. Closing the door without a sound, she moved to the kitchen and began preparing lunch.

Simon had mentioned Alexander had been drinking heavily. She worried his stomach might be unsettled.

She whipped up a light pasta dish with two simple but flavorful sides.

As she finished plating, she turned—and froze.

Alexander was already on the couch. The documents she'd just delivered were in his hands.

He hadn't changed yet, still in sleep-rumpled pajamas. His usually perfect hair was adorably mussed, softening his sharp features.

"Lunch is ready," Evelyn said, arranging the table with a smile.

Alexander approached. Then, without warning, his arms circled her waist from behind.

He buried his face in her hair near her left ear, his stubble grazing her skin.

"Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured, voice rough with sleep. "Thank you for taking care of me."

The unexpected embrace made Evelyn's breath hitch.

The moment Evelyn caught the familiar scent of his aftershave, her pulse quickened. Alexander must have just stepped out of the shower. His dark hair was still slightly damp, and a few stray strands brushed against her lips as he leaned in.

It sent a shiver down her spine.

Evelyn instinctively pressed her fingers to her tingling lips. Before she could react, Alexander settled into the chair behind them, his arms still securely wrapped around her waist.

His legs parted slightly as he sat, pulling her down until she was half-seated on his lap.

Heat flooded her cheeks. Evelyn clenched her fists, squirming in his hold. "Alexander—"

His grip only tightened, his breath warm against her ear. "Stay."

A thrill shot through her, but she forced herself to push against his chest. "We can't—not here."

His low chuckle vibrated through her. "Then where?"

Her heart hammered. This man would be the death of her.

###Chapter 184 Stormy Emotions

"Stop playing with your food and eat properly."

Alexander's gaze softened with amusement. He didn't press her further.

Evelyn studied him. "How much did you drink last night?"

Even after showering and with the morning nearly gone, the faint scent of alcohol still clung to him.

Alexander raised two fingers.

"Two glasses?" Evelyn guessed.

"Multiply that by ten," he corrected.

Evelyn blinked.

"Lucas was in a terrible state," Alexander explained.

She understood exactly why Lucas Bennett was upset.

After last night's events, it would have been more surprising if he hadn't been drowning his sorrows.

Alexander had known Lucas for years, but he had never seen him break down like that before.

Drunk and despondent, Lucas had gripped Alexander's sleeve like a lifeline. "Alex," he'd slurred, "tell me how to fix this. How do I make Claire forgive me? She left teeth marks on my arm—"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, cutting off the memory.

She didn’t need to hear the rest.

Claire Dawson wasn’t the type to lash out without reason. Whatever Lucas had done, he’d clearly earned that bite.

Alexander toyed with his fork, his expression unreadable. "He kept saying he didn’t mean to hurt her."

Evelyn arched a brow. "And you believe him?"

A pause. Then, a quiet sigh.

"I believe he thinks he didn’t."

That was the problem with Lucas—he never realized the damage until it was too late.

Evelyn pushed her plate aside. "Where is he now?"

"Passed out in the guest room." Alexander rubbed his temple. "I should check on him soon."

She nodded, but her mind was elsewhere.

Last night had been messy. Explosive.

And Claire…

Claire had looked devastated.

Evelyn clenched her fists under the table.

If Lucas thought a few drunken tears would fix things, he was in for a rude awakening.

Some wounds didn’t heal with apologies.

Some required blood.

The sight before me made my blood boil. There she was, cozying up to that handsome stranger without a care in the world. I clenched my fists, but she didn’t even glance my way.

"What am I supposed to do? Do you think they'll end up in bed together tonight? I swear, if that pretty boy lays a finger on Claire, I'll make sure he never fathers children! Then I'll march straight to the police station and turn myself in," Lucas ranted, his voice thick with despair.

Lucas buried his face in his hands, tears and snot smearing across his alcohol-flushed skin.

Alexander sat beside him, grimacing as he yanked his arm away from Lucas's drunken grasp. He grabbed a handful of tissues from the table and shoved them into Lucas's trembling hands.

Sniffling, Lucas wiped his face before downing another shot, his misery pouring out with every ragged breath.

Alexander wasn’t in the best mood either. Tonight was supposed to be perfect—wrapped in Evelyn’s warmth, tasting her lips, losing himself in her.

Instead, he hadn’t even seen her. Instead, he was stuck here, playing therapist to a sobbing mess at two in the morning.

"Evelyn is still with Claire. What could they possibly be doing?" Alexander muttered, more to himself than to Lucas.

Lucas exhaled sharply, some of the tension leaving his shoulders.

But then Alexander added coldly, "Though she should be back soon. Now that Claire has her new distraction, why would Evelyn stick around like an unwanted guest?"

The words hung in the air, sharp and bitter.

Lucas’s face twisted in fresh agony.

Alexander sighed, rubbing his temples.

This night couldn’t get any worse.

"Send Evelyn to Claire's side!" Lucas begged, his voice thick with desperation.

Alexander shot him a withering look. "If Evelyn leaves, that charming model will be alone with Claire. Do you really think that's appropriate?"

The mere thought of it made Lucas's blood boil.

Alexander crossed his arms. "What's your problem? You and Claire are divorced. Now you're trying to ruin my marriage too?"

His tone was sharp. "We've only been married a month. This is supposed to be our honeymoon phase."

"I didn't punch you out of courtesy, and now you want my wife to play babysitter?"

"Stuck at Claire's place? If anyone should be stuck, it's you. Don't drag us into your mess."

The words were harsh but true. They only deepened Lucas's misery.

He drowned himself in whiskey, but the alcohol did nothing to numb the pain. Instead, it amplified everything.

Clutching Alexander's arm, he drank until the Eclipse Lounge finally closed at sunrise.

Outside, Lucas doubled over, retching violently onto the pavement.

His body trembled, his mind too shattered to form coherent words.

Defeat weighed him down like an anchor.

Out of the twenty bottles they emptied, Alexander only had five. Lucas Bennett single-handedly finished the remaining fifteen.

Simon Graves tried to intervene, but it was useless. All he could do was watch as Lucas drowned himself in alcohol.

Alexander ordered Simon to take Lucas home. But before they could even get him into the car, Lucas wrapped his arms around Simon’s waist and refused to let go.

He was completely wasted. His words were thick and slurred.

"No, I won’t go back. That place is haunted by Claire’s ghost. What’s the point of returning to an empty house?"

His voice cracked. "Do you have any idea what it’s like? Waiting, night after night, for someone who’s never coming back? Since Claire left, I’ve been stuck in that hell."

Simon pulled the car around, but Lucas planted his feet stubbornly. With a frustrated sigh, Alexander lifted his leg and shoved him inside.

"Pathetic," Alexander snapped. "Real men don’t drown in self-pity. If you don’t want this divorce, then fight for her! Wallowing in misery won’t bring her back. Grow a spine, Lucas."

The car door slammed shut.

Simon hesitated before driving off, leaving Alexander standing there, his expression unreadable under the dim streetlights.

The night air was heavy with unspoken regrets.
###Chapter 185 A Healthier Glow

The evening air was still warm from dinner when Alexander retreated to his study to attend to some pressing matters.

Evelyn caught snippets of Simon's voice through the door, reminding him of an upcoming late-night meeting.

Her office attire clung uncomfortably after hours of wear, now infused with lingering traces of garlic and herbs. A quick shower later, she slipped into a flowing maxi dress, the soft fabric a welcome change.

The mirror reflected subtle changes—gentler curves where sharp angles used to be. Two weeks of consistent meals had softened her frame, replacing the gauntness with something healthier.

She smiled, pleased. The effort was paying off.

Dark clouds gathered outside, the weather app warning of an approaching storm.

Better retrieve her cello now before the downpour began.

Evelyn snatched her phone and typed:
[Heading back to Hawthorne Estate.]

Alexander's phone chimed with her distinct notification tone. Work forgotten, he strode out just in time to hear the front door click shut below.

The engagement party would have to wait. His response was brief: [I'll come get you when I'm finished.]

[Don't bother,] she typed back.

Evelyn wasn’t the type to make a scene. A taxi would do just fine. There was no reason to drag Alexander back and forth across the city.

At six-fifteen, Evelyn arrived at Hawthorne Estate.

The sky had darkened, heavy clouds gathering ominously in the distance.

The housekeeper greeted her at the door. "Miss Carter, you're home."

Hearing the noise, Richard and Margaret emerged, their smiles strained.

When they saw Evelyn standing alone in the doorway, their eyes immediately flickered behind her.

No Alexander.

Their expressions hardened instantly.

Richard scoffed, turning on his heel without a word. Margaret, however, didn’t hold back.

"What is this? Where’s Alexander? You promised you’d bring him for dinner! He hasn’t even properly introduced himself to us. Isn’t that basic courtesy?"

Evelyn’s voice was cool. "Rules are rules, but people aren’t bound by them. He’s swamped with work and barely has time to breathe. Expecting him to drop everything for dinner is unrealistic."

Her eyes flickered to the doorway, and Evelyn froze in surprise. Vanessa wasn't alone—Ethan sat beside her, his presence like an unexpected storm cloud.

Evelyn's gaze lingered for only a heartbeat before she sharply looked away.

Just her luck.

Across the room, Ethan's attention remained fixed on her.

Vanessa noticed the way his eyes tracked Evelyn and felt irritation prickle under her skin.

With deliberate sweetness, she peeled a grape and pressed it to Ethan's lips.

When he turned to her, Vanessa offered a demure smile. She laced her fingers through his, her grip possessive.

"I don't buy that Alexander's too busy to see us," Richard snapped, his glare boring into Evelyn.

"Let's be real—if you meant anything to him, would he treat you this way? Look at Vanessa. Every time she comes home, doesn't Ethan drop everything to be with her?" His lip curled. "You're sisters. Why are you such a disappointment?"

Evelyn's face went cold.

Her finger jabbed toward Vanessa. "That's right, I'm not like her—no talent for stealing men and playing the perfect little puppet." Her voice turned razor-sharp. "Maybe you should explain how you raised such a masterpiece of manipulation instead."

"You—!"

The air crackled with tension.

Evelyn's chest burned. She wouldn't let them twist the knife deeper. Not this time.

Vanessa's grip on Ethan tightened, her smile never wavering. But her eyes—those betrayed the fury simmering beneath.

Evelyn met her stare head-on.

Game on.

Richard's face drained of color, his fury palpable. Evelyn's sharp words had struck a nerve, offending everyone present.

Vanessa's eyes welled up with tears. Her fingers quivered as they intertwined with Ethan's.

"Evelyn, if you're upset, direct it at me," Vanessa pleaded, her voice trembling. "Why involve Mom, Dad, and Ethan? What have they done to deserve this?"

"Spare me the theatrics," Evelyn snapped.

Her icy gaze swept over Vanessa before she turned on her heel and strode toward the storage room without another word.

###Chapter 186 The Stinging Blow

The vintage cello case felt heavy in Evelyn's hands as she pulled it from the dusty storage closet. Strapping it across her back, she turned toward the exit without hesitation.

Not a single moment longer would she endure this suffocating prison called Hawthorne Estate. A family that had never treated her as one didn't deserve her presence.

"Evelyn Carter, don't you dare take another step!"

Margaret's sharp command sliced through the air as Evelyn crossed the grand living room.

"Look what you've done! Vanessa is in tears because of your cruel words!" Margaret's voice trembled with outrage. "You will apologize this instant!"

Vanessa clung to Ethan Caldwell's arm, her delicate sobs pausing abruptly when she spotted the cello case. A flicker of unease crossed her face.

Evelyn hadn't touched that instrument in years. Why now?

Was she planning to return to music?

Vanessa's carefully constructed mask slipped for just a second before she buried her face back into Ethan's shoulder.

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile as her gaze swept over the room's occupants. "Apologize?" Her voice was glacial. "For what? Speaking the truth?"

Richard Hayes slammed his fist onto the marble coffee table. "Walk out that door, and consider yourself disowned! You're no daughter of mine!"

Evelyn carefully placed her cello aside and sank into the plush sofa cushions.

"Richard," she began, her voice steady. "Do you recall our little wager? You swore that if I married Alexander, Vanessa would surrender the deed to Hawthorne Estate."

A cold smile played on her lips. "I know you're a man of your word. When should I expect the transfer?"

Her gaze sharpened. "In fact, you might want to begin packing. It's time for you to leave."

At the mention of their bet, Richard's expression flickered with unease.

When they'd made that agreement, he'd been certain she would never secure Alexander's hand in marriage—certain enough to gamble Vanessa's home for Evelyn's company shares.

Margaret's shrill voice cut through the tension. "How dare you speak to your father like this! Are you truly throwing us out?"

Evelyn didn't even glance her way. "This was between Richard and me. Stay out of it."

"You—"

"I have the entire conversation recorded." Evelyn's fingers brushed her phone. "Unless you'd like to hear it?"

Vanessa's knuckles whitened around the fabric of her dress. "Evelyn," she whispered, her face ashen. "How can you be so cruel? The shares weren't enough? Now you're stealing my home?"

The air thickened with unspoken threats.

Evelyn leaned forward, her eyes glacial. "No one stole anything. This was a fair game—and I won."

A heavy silence fell.

Then—

Crack.

The sound of skin meeting skin echoed through the room.

Vanessa's palm stung from the force of her slap across Evelyn's cheek.

Evelyn didn't flinch.

She simply turned her face back slowly, a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth.

Her smile was terrifying.

"Now we're even."

Vanessa stumbled back, suddenly uncertain.

Because Evelyn wasn't just claiming a house.

She was dismantling their entire world—one calculated move at a time.

And this?

This was only the beginning.

Evelyn's icy stare burned into Vanessa's face. "Addressing your elder so disrespectfully? Is this how the Harts raised you? Let me make this clear—I'm your Aunt Evelyn! As for the estate, just because your name is on the deed doesn't mean it's yours. Grandfather William's will explicitly states it belongs to me and Oliver," she declared, her voice sharp with authority.

Vanessa lowered her gaze, guilt twisting in her stomach.

Richard's glare darkened. "Aunt Evelyn? This is the Hayes family, not the Caldwells! You and Vanessa are both my daughters. Why should she call you that?"

He scoffed, crossing his arms. "And that bet about the house? A joke, nothing more. I'm still alive, which means I decide who inherits what. Not you."

His words dripped with defiance, making it clear he had no intention of honoring their agreement.

Evelyn let out a cold laugh. "Richard, you're spitting on your own father's dying wishes. Aren't you afraid he'll rise from his grave to curse you for your betrayal?"

Ethan stood nearby, and the venom in Evelyn's words made Richard's face flush with humiliation.

Before anyone could react, Richard's hand shot out, aiming for Evelyn's cheek.

She barely had time to register the movement before the slap was already descending—too fast, too brutal.

But the stinging impact never came.

Ethan's grip clamped around Richard's wrist, stopping the blow mid-air.

The sound echoed through the grand hall of Whitmore Manor, sharp and unforgiving.

Vanessa Hart staggered back, her hand flying to her cheek where Evelyn Carter’s palm had struck. The force of it sent her stumbling into a nearby table, knocking over a crystal vase.

Silence followed.

Evelyn’s chest rose and fell rapidly, her fingers still tingling from the impact. She hadn’t planned this. But the moment Vanessa had sneered, whispering those vile words about Alexander, something inside her snapped.

Vanessa’s eyes burned with fury. "You—"

"You deserved it," Evelyn cut in, her voice low but steady. "You crossed a line."

Alexander Whitmore stepped forward, his presence commanding. His gaze flickered between the two women, lingering on Evelyn with something akin to pride.

Vanessa’s lips curled. "This isn’t over."

Evelyn met her glare without flinching. "It never was."

The tension thickened, suffocating.

Then, from the doorway, Grace Caldwell gasped. "What on earth is happening here?"

Vanessa’s expression twisted into something wounded, her fingers still pressed to her reddening cheek. "Your sister-in-law just assaulted me."

Grace’s eyes widened, darting to Evelyn.

Evelyn didn’t deny it. She lifted her chin. "She had it coming."

Alexander’s lips twitched, though he schooled his features into neutrality.

Grace hesitated, then sighed. "Vanessa, perhaps you should leave."

Vanessa’s face darkened. "You’re taking her side?"

Grace folded her arms. "I’m taking the side of peace."

With a final scathing look, Vanessa stormed out, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

The moment the door slammed, Evelyn exhaled, her shoulders sagging slightly.

Alexander moved closer, his fingers brushing hers. "You okay?"

She nodded, though her pulse still raced. "Better than I expected."

Grace shook her head, but there was a hint of amusement in her eyes. "Well, that’s one way to handle things."

Evelyn smirked. "Effective, wasn’t it?"

Alexander chuckled, pulling her into his side. "Remind me never to make you angry."

She leaned into him, the adrenaline fading. But beneath the lightness, a thought lingered.

Vanessa wouldn’t let this go.

And neither would she.
###Chapter 187 Dignified Restraint

Ethan Caldwell found himself seated beside Richard Hayes when the confrontation erupted. Stopping the older man's impulsive action was pure reflex.

He could have remained uninvolved. Yet seeing Richard's hand rise against Evelyn Carter, his body moved before his mind could process the consequences.

"Let's handle this with words. We're all civilized people here," Ethan interjected, his voice steady despite the tension.

Richard's lips twisted into an awkward grimace as he withdrew his hand.

The realization struck him—losing control in front of Ethan was beneath him. Striking Evelyn in anger would only make him appear weak, incapable of managing his emotions like the patriarch he claimed to be.

Vanessa Hart stood frozen, shock rendering her speechless.

Ethan defending Evelyn? The thought sent an acidic wave through her chest. Her gaze darted between them, fingers tightening around her clutch.

That protective instinct should have been reserved for her.

"Ethan," she forced out, voice brittle, "I never expected you to shield Aunt Evelyn like this." The unspoken accusation hung heavy—Why her?

Evelyn remained still, observing the dynamics with quiet calculation. Ethan's intervention changed nothing. But the flicker of surprise in his eyes when their gazes met? That was interesting.

Richard cleared his throat, adjusting his tie. "You're right. This isn't the place for theatrics." The words were meant to salvage his dignity, but the tremor in his hands betrayed him.

Vanessa's manicured nails dug into her palms.

First Alexander Whitmore, now Ethan. Everyone kept choosing Evelyn over her.

The game wasn't over yet.

The words "Auntie Evelyn" slipped from Vanessa's lips with deliberate precision, a sharp reminder of the unbridgeable gap between Ethan and Evelyn now.

It was a calculated strike—proof that Evelyn belonged to Alexander now.

As expected, Ethan froze at the title. His gaze dropped, shoulders tensing as silence swallowed him whole. His thoughts were a storm no one could decipher.

Margaret rushed forward, her voice honeyed with diplomacy. "Evelyn, sweetheart, apologize to your father. Look how hurt he is."

For Richard's pride, an apology would smooth things over. They were family, after all. Grudges didn't linger where blood ran thick.

It was also the perfect way to make Evelyn retreat from her claim on the estate.

"I did nothing wrong," Evelyn stated, her voice steel wrapped in velvet.

Her conviction didn't waver as she continued, "I'm only reclaiming what was always meant to be mine. Where is the crime in that?"

Margaret's brows pinched. "What are you talking about? The shares, the estate—they belong to the Hayes family."

"Exactly. Hayes family property. Yet it's Vanessa who holds it now. She's an outsider—no blood, no right!"

Her voice cracked like a whip. "You all coddle her, handing over what Grandfather William left for me.

"I know Dad only made that bet to force me to surrender my inheritance."

The air turned brittle.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. "But I won't back down. Not this time."

Richard's face darkened, but before he could speak, Alexander stepped forward, his presence a silent shield.

His voice, when it came, was deceptively calm. "Perhaps it's time we settled this legally."

Vanessa paled.

Ethan finally looked up, his eyes burning with something unreadable. "Evelyn—"

She cut him off. "Respect is earned, not demanded. And right now, none of you deserve mine."

The room held its breath.

Then—

The front doors burst open.

A figure stood silhouetted against the afternoon light, his arrival ripping through the tension like a blade.

Everyone turned.

And froze.

Because standing there, his expression unreadable, was the last person any of them expected to see.

Oliver Hayes.

Evelyn's younger brother—back from the dead.

The storm outside mirrored the tempest in Evelyn's heart.

"But don't you think that's excessive?" Her voice trembled with suppressed fury. "That cello was Grandfather William's last gift to me. If none of you care, why shouldn't he?"

Vanessa had stolen everything—her fiancé, her home. For years, Richard had secretly funneled company dividends to Vanessa without Evelyn's knowledge. And now? They demanded an apology, labeling her ungrateful and disrespectful.

"How exactly have I failed you?" Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. "If I'm such a disappointment, why summon me back? We both know I'm nothing but an inconvenience. Vanessa—your precious imposter—is the only daughter you acknowledge."

Lightning split the sky, illuminating the frozen shock on Margaret's face.

The silence was deafening.

A sharp pain radiated from Evelyn's twisted ankle, but it paled against the raw agony in her chest.

She'd been a fool to hope.

Tonight wasn't just about retrieving her cello. It was Margaret's birthday. Despite everything, Evelyn had clung to the childish belief that shared blood meant something. That showing up for dinner might bridge the chasm between them.

After all, Margaret's chronic back pain stemmed from Evelyn's birth. Didn't that warrant basic decency?

Now, watching her mother's icy indifference, Evelyn finally understood.

Some wounds never heal.

Some families never love.

Thunder growled as she turned toward the door, her resolve hardening with each step. This time, she wouldn't look back.

The morning sun filtered through the sheer curtains of the penthouse, casting a golden glow over the polished marble floors. Evelyn Carter stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, her reflection a perfect silhouette against the glittering skyline of Cresthaven.

She took a slow sip of her coffee, the rich aroma grounding her.

Behind her, Alexander Whitmore adjusted his cufflinks, his sharp gaze meeting hers in the glass. "You're quiet this morning," he remarked, his voice low and smooth.

Evelyn exhaled, setting her cup down. "Just thinking."

"About?"

She turned to face him fully, crossing her arms. "About how far we've come."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "And yet, you still look like you're preparing for war."

"Because I am."

The air between them shifted, charged with unspoken tension.

Alexander stepped closer, his presence overwhelming. "You don’t have to fight alone anymore."

She held his gaze, her own unwavering. "I know."

A knock at the door interrupted them.

Nathan Reeves entered, his expression carefully neutral. "Mr. Whitmore, the board is waiting."

Alexander gave a curt nod. "Give us a minute."

Once the door closed again, Evelyn arched a brow. "Trouble?"

"Always." He sighed, running a hand through his dark hair. "But nothing I can't handle."

She smirked. "I’d expect nothing less."

He leaned in, pressing a quick kiss to her forehead. "Stay out of trouble."

"Make me."

His chuckle was dark as he pulled away. "Later."

The moment he left, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. A message from Vanessa Hart.

"We need to talk."

Her grip tightened on the device.

Vanessa never reached out unless it was serious.

Evelyn typed a quick reply. "Where?"

The response was immediate.

"Eclipse Lounge. Noon."

She exhaled sharply.

Whatever this was, it wouldn’t be good.

But then again, when had anything involving Vanessa ever been?

Evelyn grabbed her coat, her mind already racing.

The game was far from over.

And she was ready to play.
###Chapter 188 Shame

Three years ago, Evelyn Carter still clung to the fragile hope that her family might care.

When Vanessa Hart framed her and sent her to prison, she waited.

Day after day, she stared at the cold prison walls, expecting—praying—that someone would come for her.

No one ever did.

Not her mother, Margaret Hayes. Not her father, Richard Hayes. Not even her younger brother, Oliver Hayes.

She had spent years overestimating her worth in their eyes.

Never again.

Now, standing in the opulent dining room of Hawthorne Estate, Evelyn met each of their gazes with icy calm.

She reached into her pocket and withdrew a small velvet box.

"Mother," she said, her voice steady. "Happy birthday."

The box clicked open, revealing a simple string of wooden beads.

Working at Titan Capital Group paid well, but Evelyn refused to touch Alexander Whitmore’s money for this.

She had bought these beads with her own earnings—symbols of peace and fortune, carved by hand.

Margaret Hayes blinked, stunned.

Was it really her birthday today?

The realization flickered across her face, followed by something darker—something like shame.

Evelyn didn’t wait for a reaction.

She turned and walked away, her steps light, her heart finally free.

Of course, no one had remembered.

Now that Evelyn mentioned it, Margaret realized it was actually her birthday.

Vanessa froze. Evelyn had brought a gift, while she had come empty-handed—an oversight that made her cheeks burn with embarrassment.

Her eyes darted to the simple bracelet in Evelyn's hand, and she blurted, "Mom, I was in such a rush today that I left the diamond choker I bought for you at the office. I'll bring it next time. It cost nearly three million."

Margaret adored diamonds. Vanessa knew that would soften her.

But Margaret wasn’t fooled. She saw right through Vanessa’s hasty excuse—a transparent attempt not to be overshadowed by Evelyn.

In all these years, Vanessa had never once bothered with gifts.

As Margaret accepted the bracelet, Evelyn turned away.

She reached down, gripped the hem of her gown, and tore it clean off. The fabric fluttered to the floor like a fallen petal.

"From this moment on, I am no longer a Hayes." Her voice was steady, but her fingers trembled. "Mom, Dad… thank you for raising me all these years. If we meet again, let’s pretend we don’t know each other."

She swallowed hard.

"I’m sorry for all the trouble I caused. I won’t disappoint you anymore."

The air in the room was thick with tension.

"Take care of yourselves," Evelyn said, her voice steady but laced with quiet fury. "Pretend I never existed. If I'd known this was how you'd treat me, I would've stayed away forever."

Her fingers curled into fists at her sides.

"I don’t want anything from the Hayes family anymore. I’ll return every share Grandfather left me. Give them to Vanessa—she’s clearly the daughter you wanted."

The words hung heavy in the silence.

Evelyn’s gaze was unyielding, her decision final. This wasn’t just about walking away—it was about severing ties completely.

She had fought for those shares, not out of greed, but to prove a point. To force Richard and Margaret to see their own cruelty.

But she had been naive. Parents who favored one child would never admit their own injustice.

With a slow exhale, she reached for the cello resting on the table.

The room seemed to freeze.

When they had first brought their long-lost daughter home, Richard and Margaret had been overjoyed.

No one could have predicted that, after all these years, things would crumble like this.

Despite everything, she was still their blood. Even if they had never treated her right, cutting ties with their own flesh and blood would be a scandal.

Evelyn was still legally a Hayes. She was still the rightful—

But now she wanted to cut all ties and return the shares?

The elite circles would mock the Hayes family mercilessly.

Even Richard’s own brothers would never stand for this!

People would assume they had schemed to take Evelyn’s inheritance and then cast her out.

Richard’s chest burned with fury. His face turned ashen, his expression darkening like a storm.

"Cutting ties? Who put such ridiculous ideas in your head? Have you lost your mind? Are you abandoning your family now?" Richard snapped.

Today, he had been utterly humiliated in front of Ethan.

The weight of disgrace pressed down on him, suffocating.

His fingers clenched into fists, nails biting into his palms.

Evelyn’s defiance was a slap to his pride, a public spectacle he couldn’t endure.

The whispers would spread—how the Hayes patriarch couldn’t even control his own daughter.

Worse, they’d suspect greed had driven them to this.

Richard’s jaw tightened.

This wasn’t just about shares.

It was about reputation. Power.

And Evelyn had just threatened to shatter it all.

###Chapter 189 The Violin

Margaret's voice trembled with frustration. "Why must you be so dramatic? A few simple words and you're ready to abandon your family!"

Evelyn didn't respond. She adjusted the violin case on her shoulder, her fingers tightening around the strap.

The throbbing in her ankle matched the relentless drumming of rain against the windows. Each step sent sharp needles of pain up her leg.

"Go then!" Richard's shout echoed through the foyer. "But remember—walk out that door and don't you dare come crawling back!" His face flushed with anger. "After everything we've done for you, this is how you repay us? With threats and tantrums?"

Margaret tugged at her husband's sleeve. "Richard, that's enough."

A strange ache twisted in Margaret's chest as she watched Evelyn reach for the doorknob. Fifteen years of memories flashed before her—birthday parties, school recitals, that time Evelyn stayed up all night making her a handmade card when she was sick.

The realization struck her like lightning. Of everyone in the household, only Evelyn had remembered her birthday last month.

Perhaps her daughter wasn't the ice queen she'd always assumed.

Across the room, Vanessa hid a smirk behind her champagne flute. The game was progressing exactly as she'd planned.

The rain hammered against the windows as Evelyn stood frozen in the doorway, her fingers tightening around the strap of her cello case.

Vanessa’s smirk was sharp enough to cut glass.

She had already envisioned it—how she would charm Alexander into transferring those shares Margaret had surrendered straight into her name.

Once that was done, she wouldn’t just hold 8% of Horizon Enterprises. She’d also have the deed to the Hawthorne Estate.

More than Oliver ever had.

The thought sent a thrill down her spine.

But there was still one tiny obstacle.

"Evelyn," Vanessa drawled, tilting her head. "You’re really going to abandon Mom and Dad just like that? You claim you’re cutting ties with the Hayes family, but can you?"

Her gaze flickered to the cello case.

"Isn’t that thing on your back from them?"

Evelyn’s hand stilled.

The rain outside roared louder, the wind howling through the open door, spraying droplets across the floor.

Slowly, Evelyn turned.

Her eyes were ice.

Vanessa faltered under that stare. "W-What? I’m not wrong, am I?"

In one swift motion, Evelyn wrenched the cello case off her shoulder and hurled it to the ground.

The impact cracked like thunder.

The case split open, the polished wood of the cello skidding across the wet tiles. A jagged scar split down its body, the strings snapping with a discordant wail.

Vanessa gasped.

Evelyn didn’t blink.

The storm raged on.

Without hesitation, Evelyn vanished into the stormy night.

Margaret stood frozen, her gaze fixed on the shattered remains of the cello lying on the marble floor. A pang of nostalgia twisted her heart.

If her memory served right, that very instrument had been Evelyn's sixteenth birthday present—the year she was officially welcomed into the Hayes family.

Evelyn had adored it at first, playing for hours until her fingers ached. Then one day, without explanation, the music stopped. The cello was abandoned, collecting dust in the corner.

Now it lay in pieces, its polished wood splintered beyond repair.

What a waste.

This wasn't how things were supposed to go.

Evelyn hadn't planned this disaster, but at least she was finally escaping.

Icy raindrops slid down Evelyn's face like tears, soaking through her thin blouse. The cold seeped into her bones, making her shiver violently.

Her injured ankle throbbed with every limping step, the pain sharp as broken glass. She bit back a whimper.

The Hawthorne Estate's gated driveway stretched endlessly before her. She needed to reach the main road before anyone noticed she was gone.

Then headlights sliced through the darkness, blinding her.

The engine's growl vibrated through the rain.

Too late.

They'd found her.

A sleek black Bentley glided out from the Hawthorne Estate, its polished surface reflecting the afternoon sun. Ethan Caldwell's hands gripped the steering wheel with controlled tension.

Evelyn Carter limped painfully along the tree-lined driveway, her injured leg making each step an ordeal. She'd barely covered a hundred meters when the purr of an engine approached from behind.

The luxury vehicle came to a smooth stop beside her.

"Get in."

The tinted window descended with a quiet hum, revealing Ethan's sharp profile. The dim interior shadows accentuated the hard lines of his jaw, but his gaze burned with unmistakable intensity as it locked onto her.

Evelyn's eyes darted instinctively to the passenger seat.

Vanessa wasn't there.

The leather seats smelled faintly of sandalwood and something distinctly masculine. The silence between them stretched like a taut wire as Evelyn hesitated at the open door, her fingers brushing against the cool metal frame.

Somewhere in the distance, a violin's mournful notes drifted through the autumn air, the melody strangely fitting for this unexpected reunion.

Evelyn took a shallow breath and made her decision.
###Chapter 190 The Scar That Never Fades

A mocking smile played on her lips as she tilted her head. "Ethan, what's this? You abandoned your precious Vanessa to come after me? Don't you worry she'll throw a tantrum when you return?"

His voice was low, almost tender. "Vanessa wouldn't act out with me."

Evelyn's smile turned sharper, bitter.

So, was she the only one who had ever dared to challenge him?

Ethan didn't understand himself.

Watching Evelyn cut all ties with the Hayes family, seeing her drop her beloved cello and stride into the downpour without hesitation—something inside him twisted painfully.

Each uneven step she took sent a jolt through his chest.

When she winced, he felt it too.

A memory surfaced—two months ago, when he had picked her up from prison.

It had been raining that day too.

She had limped the same way.

His gaze dropped to the jagged scar marring her ankle.

Had it left her with lasting damage?

Before her imprisonment, she had been flawless.

Who had dared to lay a hand on her behind those bars?

Ethan Caldwell was chasing after her.

He couldn't believe what he was doing.

At the Hawthorne Estate, Richard and Margaret Hayes were still processing Evelyn Carter's decision to cut ties with the family. The shock hadn't faded.

Vanessa Hart stood frozen.

She hadn’t expected this.

Less than five minutes after Evelyn walked out, Ethan had gone after her.

Panic clawed at Vanessa’s chest. Her hands shook uncontrollably.

She was losing control.

She had been so sure—as long as Ethan never discovered it was Evelyn who played the cello that woke him from his coma years ago, they would never reconcile.

That’s why she had forced Evelyn to leave the instrument behind.

But now, even without knowing the truth, Ethan was running after her.

Vanessa’s nails dug into her palms. She couldn’t just stand there.

She needed a plan.

Then it hit her—Alexander Whitmore!

Her mind raced. If she could get to him first, she could still turn this around.

Her lips curled into a sharp smile.

This wasn’t over yet.

The downpour intensified as Evelyn stood frozen on the sidewalk, her clothes clinging to her like a second skin.

Ethan Caldwell's jaw tightened as he watched her shiver. His grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles white.

"Get in the damn car," he growled.

Evelyn wiped the rain from her face, her glare unwavering. "And give Vanessa another reason to spread rumors? No thanks."

She took another step back, her heels sinking into the wet pavement. The cold seeped into her bones, but she refused to show weakness.

Ethan exhaled sharply, his patience wearing thin. "You're being ridiculous."

"Am I?" Evelyn scoffed. "Your precious stepsister has a habit of twisting every interaction between us. I won't give her the satisfaction."

A muscle in Ethan's jaw twitched. He hated that she had a point.

Vanessa Hart had a way of turning innocent situations into scandals.

But seeing Evelyn drenched and trembling ignited something primal in him.

Before he could stop himself, he shoved the car door open and stepped into the rain.

Evelyn's eyes widened as he closed the distance between them.

"What are you—"

He didn't let her finish.

In one swift motion, he scooped her into his arms.

She gasped, her hands instinctively gripping his shoulders. "Put me down!"

"Not a chance." His voice was rough, his breath warm against her ear.

Evelyn squirmed, but his hold was unbreakable.

The rain blurred her vision, but she could still see the dark intensity in his gaze.

"You're impossible," she muttered.

Ethan smirked. "And you're stubborn."

He carried her to the car, ignoring her protests.

As he deposited her into the passenger seat, their eyes locked.

A dangerous tension crackled between them.

Evelyn's pulse raced.

This was a mistake.

But as Ethan slammed the door shut, she knew—

There was no turning back now.

"Go away," Evelyn said sharply.

When she refused to budge, Ethan's face darkened.

He shrugged off his tailored jacket and draped it over her shoulders without ceremony. His gaze lingered for a split second on her exposed collarbone. "At least have some decency," he muttered.

Evelyn stiffened, suddenly hyperaware of her soaked dress clinging to every curve. The thin fabric left little to imagination, amplifying her discomfort.

Footsteps splashed through puddles as Vanessa came rushing toward them.

"Ethan! You promised we'd leave together!" she cried.

Vanessa's designer dress was splattered with mud, suggesting she'd taken a tumble. Standing there drenched and shivering, she looked like a fragile doll about to collapse in the storm.
###Chapter 191 Playing the Victim

Vanessa's smile froze when she witnessed Ethan draping his jacket over Evelyn's shoulders.

The heavy rain and dim streetlights masked her momentary slip of composure. No one caught the flicker of irritation in her eyes.

Vanessa approached the car, tilting her head up with practiced grace. She offered Evelyn a saccharine smile.

"Evelyn, darling, it's impossible to get a taxi in this storm. Let Ethan drive you home," she cooed, her voice dripping with false concern.

Without waiting for a response, she reached for the passenger door, positioning herself to slide in first.

When Evelyn didn't move, Vanessa grabbed her wrist and tugged sharply.

"Don't be shy! We're practically sisters now," she insisted, her grip tightening.

Evelyn's injured ankle screamed in protest. The sudden yank sent her stumbling forward, her palm slamming against the car door to steady herself.

She shoved Vanessa away—only for the woman to dramatically collapse into a muddy puddle with a theatrical gasp.

The splash echoed through the night.

Vanessa's designer dress was ruined. Her perfectly styled hair now clung to her face in wet strands.

And yet—her lips curled into a smirk only Evelyn could see.

Checkmate.

Vanessa's eyes widened in shock as she stared at Evelyn. "Evelyn, I was only trying to help by having Ethan drive you home. Why did you shove me?"

Rain streaked down her face, making her already pale complexion appear ghostly.

The moment Vanessa hit the ground, Ethan flung open the car door and rushed to her side, pulling her up.

His gaze darkened as it landed on Evelyn. "You haven't changed at all… Give me back my jacket."

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. She hadn't even bothered to put it on.

Her frosty eyes flickered between them before she let out a sharp, humorless laugh.

"Vanessa, it's just a jacket. Did you really need to throw yourself into a puddle over it?" Evelyn's voice dripped with disdain. "The things you're so desperate to steal from me? They're worthless."

With that, she tossed the jacket at them.

Vanessa's teeth sank into her bottom lip. "What are you talking about? You're the one who pushed me! Stop twisting the truth. Why would I deliberately fall into a puddle in this downpour? Do I look insane to you?"

Evelyn took two swift steps forward.

Before either could react, she seized Vanessa's wrist and yanked her out of Ethan's grasp.

Then—

She kicked Vanessa straight into the—

The sharp pain shot through Vanessa's leg like lightning.

She let out a piercing scream, her body crumpling as she collapsed onto the wet pavement.

"Since you love acting like the victim, I'll give you a real performance," Evelyn sneered.

Without hesitation, she swung her foot again, this time striking Vanessa squarely in the lower back.

The impact sent Vanessa sprawling face-first into a murky puddle.

Dirty water splashed everywhere, streaking her carefully applied makeup, leaving her porcelain skin smeared with grime. Her designer dress was ruined, her hair a tangled mess.

Evelyn loomed over her, lips curled in disgust. "Need an encore? I've got plenty more where that came from."

Each kick had been delivered with brutal precision. Vanessa lay dazed, struggling to process what had just happened.

Her teeth sank into her bottom lip hard enough to draw blood. This wasn't how things were supposed to go. Evelyn never played by the rules.

Rage burned in her chest, but with Ethan watching, she couldn't fight back. Not here. Not now.

"Stop this madness!" Ethan roared, stepping between them. "Evelyn, have you completely lost your mind? Your family issues have nothing to do with Vanessa! Why take it out on her?"

Evelyn didn't even glance his way. "I despise fakes," she said coldly. "She wanted a scene? I gave her one. Now the performance can be convincing."

The words hung in the air like a challenge.

Vanessa remained motionless on the ground, her trembling fingers curling into fists beneath the muddy water. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.

"You..." Ethan's face twisted with rage, his complexion turning ghostly pale. "This is beyond ridiculous!" he spat out.

Tears welled up in Vanessa's eyes as she clung to him. "Let it go, Ethan. She's not worth it. If anyone has to endure this, it should be me..."

Their icy glares bore into Evelyn, Vanessa pressing herself weakly against Ethan's chest as if seeking protection.

The biting wind made Evelyn's solitary figure seem even more delicate, like a lone leaf trembling in a storm.

Just then, the sleek silhouette of a rare vintage car emerged from the distance, its polished chrome glinting under the dim streetlights.

The tension in the air thickened, the sudden arrival slicing through the suffocating atmosphere.

Evelyn didn’t turn to look, but her fingers curled tighter around the edges of her coat.

Vanessa’s breath hitched, her grip on Ethan tightening.

The car slowed to a stop, its engine purring ominously.

A door clicked open.

Then—silence.
###Chapter 192 Alexander's Arrival

The headlights cut through the darkness like twin blades. Evelyn instinctively lifted her hand, shielding her eyes from the blinding glare.

A sliver of golden light slipped between her fingers, painting her slender silhouette in an ethereal glow.

Through the rain-streaked windshield, Evelyn caught sight of Alexander's chiseled features—those sharp cheekbones and piercing eyes that always made her breath hitch.

The luxury sedan came to an abrupt halt mere inches from where she stood, tires hissing against the wet pavement.

Alexander emerged instantly, black umbrella snapping open with military precision.

His polished Oxfords splashed through puddles as he strode toward her with that unmistakable air of authority.

The hollow ache in Evelyn's chest vanished the moment his shadow fell over her. Her fingers twitched at her sides, nails digging into her palms.

"Wasn't he attending the gala at Cresthaven Grand?"

"How did he get here so fast?"

Alexander's gaze swept over Evelyn with laser focus.

His eyes zeroed in on the torn chiffon at her hemline first—the fabric fluttering like wounded butterfly wings.

There she stood in the storm's embrace, drenched yet defiant, radiating a quiet strength that never failed to undo him.

A sharp pang of anguish pierced through Alexander's chest.

The mere thought of Evelyn suffering any injustice made his dark eyes turn glacial.

Noticing how the cold had drained the color from her face, he swiftly removed his tailored suit jacket and wrapped it around her slender shoulders.

His fingers lingered lightly on her arm as he murmured, "Forgive me for keeping you waiting."

"You're right on time," Evelyn replied, tilting her face up to meet his gaze with a fragile smile that didn't reach her eyes.

Alexander's jaw tightened. He knew that smile—the one she wore like armor when she was hurting.

Something had happened tonight. Something that wounded her.

Vanessa seized the moment, her voice dripping with false concern. "Uncle Alexander, you should know—Aunt Evelyn just disowned Mom and Dad at Hawthorne Estate."

"Disowned?" His brow furrowed sharply.

Vanessa nodded eagerly, scenting blood in the water. "After everything they've done for her these past twelve years, she repays them like this. Doesn't that seem heartless to you?"

When Alexander remained silent, his expression unreadable, she pressed on. "She even demanded the deed to Hawthorne Estate. When Mom and Dad tried to reason with her, she threatened to sever all family ties!"

The night air grew heavier with each accusation. Alexander's gaze never left Evelyn, searching for the truth beneath her carefully constructed calm.

Vanessa wasn't finished. "She's changed, Uncle Alexander. The Evelyn you knew wouldn't—"

"Enough."

The single word, spoken softly yet with lethal precision, silenced her instantly. Alexander's attention remained fixed on Evelyn as he reached for her hand, his thumb brushing over her knuckles in a silent question.

Evelyn's breath hitched. That simple touch threatened to unravel her composure.

"Let's go home," he said, not as a suggestion but a promise—one that held the unspoken vow that whatever storm had raged here tonight, they would weather it together.

Vanessa's mouth opened in protest, but the icy glare Alexander shot her way froze the words in her throat.

As they turned to leave, Evelyn's fingers tightened around his. For the first time that evening, her smile reached her eyes.

"Look at me." Vanessa gestured dramatically at her mud-stained clothes. "I only wanted to reason with her, but she shoved me into that puddle in a fit of rage. Now I'm drenched—all because of her."

She painted the scene with exaggerated flair, her voice dripping with false innocence.

"Uncle Alexander, how could you marry someone like Evelyn? She's vile."

Vanessa tilted her head, feigning curiosity. "Did she trap you? Chase you until you had no choice?"

Her gaze flickered to Evelyn, smug satisfaction curling her lips.

Today was the day she'd rip off Evelyn's mask in front of Alexander. Once he saw the truth, Evelyn would never recover her dignity.

Did she really think clinging to Alexander made her invincible?

A man like him would never tolerate such disgraceful behavior.

An unfilial wife? That alone would ruin her.

Alexander smiled.

But it was ice-cold.

"Oh?" His voice was deceptively light. "Is that how it happened?"

Evelyn sensed his presence and lifted her gaze to meet his.

Alexander's profile was breathtakingly perfect. His piercing blue eyes, aristocratic nose, and chiseled jawline could make any woman's pulse quicken with just a glance.

The moment their eyes locked, electricity crackled between them.

In the muted glow of the streetlights, Alexander noticed Evelyn's lips quivering.

Realizing she was freezing, he immediately pulled her close, shielding her from the rain as he guided her toward the waiting car.

"Get in," he murmured, his voice low and urgent. "There's a wool throw in the back. Wrap yourself in it."

Evelyn gave a small nod. Though she wore Alexander's tailored jacket, her clothes were drenched, offering no warmth against the autumn chill.

The moment she slid into the heated leather seats, warmth began seeping back into her bones.

Alexander didn't join her. Instead, he turned back toward the downpour, the black umbrella in his grip trembling under the assault of wind and rain.

His silhouette against the storm was both protective and dangerous—a knight standing guard against the tempest.

Evelyn watched through the rain-streaked window as he barked orders into his phone, his commanding presence undiminished by the weather.

The blanket smelled faintly of his cologne—sandalwood and something uniquely Alexander. She pulled it tighter around her shoulders, her fingers brushing against something hard in the pocket.

A small velvet box.

Her breath caught.

Outside, the storm raged on. But inside the car, Evelyn's world had just tilted on its axis.

What game was Alexander Whitmore playing now?

###Chapter 193 Reckless

Alexander slipped one hand into his pocket, his expression unreadable. "What should I do?" he murmured, more to himself than to the others.

Vanessa and Ethan exchanged confused glances.

With deliberate slowness, Alexander plucked a cigarette from his coat and placed it between his lips.

The flick of his lighter cast a ghostly blue glow across his sharp features. The flame illuminated the cool detachment in his eyes.

"From what you're saying, Evelyn's character does seem... questionable," Alexander remarked, exhaling a slow stream of smoke.

The tip of the cigarette burned crimson in the dim light. Shadows curled around him, making his expression impossible to decipher.

Vanessa's lips curled into a triumphant smile at his words.

"Exactly, Uncle Alexander! A woman who abandons her own family is heartless. She’ll only bring you misery in the long run," she declared, her voice dripping with false concern.

Ethan shot her a sideways glance.

Tonight, he hadn’t agreed with many of Evelyn’s choices. But Vanessa’s relentless attacks left a bitter taste in his mouth.

Besides, he had watched Evelyn closely all evening. There were moments—fleeting, but undeniable—when her composure cracked.

The luxury sedan's soundproofing was impeccable. Evelyn could only observe the tense exchange unfolding below through the tinted windows, the voices muffled into silence.

Alexander's piercing blue eyes locked onto Vanessa with glacial intensity. The air around him seemed to freeze, his expression colder than the depths of winter.

"Heartless and ungrateful? Perhaps." His voice was dangerously calm. "But that’s exactly why I love her."

Ethan and Vanessa both stiffened, shock flashing across their faces.

What the hell?
Has Alexander completely lost his mind? What kind of twisted logic is that?

A humorless smirk curled Alexander’s lips as he plucked the cigarette from between them. He flicked it to the pavement, grinding it beneath the heel of his polished shoe.

"Uncle Alexander?" Vanessa’s voice wavered, her wide eyes darting between him and Ethan.

Ethan’s confusion was palpable, his brow furrowing as he tried to process Alexander’s words.

Then—without warning—Alexander’s fist collided with Ethan’s jaw.

The impact was brutal. Ethan staggered back, his head snapping to the side. A split second later, blood welled from his split lip, the metallic tang flooding his mouth.

Vanessa gasped, her hands flying to cover her mouth.

Ethan barely had time to register the pain before Alexander grabbed him by the collar, yanking him forward until they were nose to nose.

"You think you can touch what’s mine?" Alexander’s voice was a lethal whisper. "You’re even more delusional than I thought."

Ethan’s pulse roared in his ears. He opened his mouth to retort—

But Alexander wasn’t done.

His knee drove upward, slamming into Ethan’s gut with enough force to knock the air from his lungs. Ethan doubled over, coughing violently.

Vanessa shrieked, stumbling back. "Stop! You’re insane!"

Alexander didn’t spare her a glance. His focus remained solely on Ethan, his expression devoid of mercy.

Inside the car, Evelyn’s fingers dug into the leather seat. Her breath hitched as she watched the scene unfold, her heart pounding against her ribs.

She had never seen Alexander like this.

Unhinged.

Reckless.

Dangerous.

And it terrified her—because part of her thrilled at the sight.

The rain poured relentlessly, painting the night in shades of silver and shadow.

"Uncle Alexander! Why did you hit him?" Vanessa's voice trembled with disbelief, her eyes wide as she clutched Ethan's arm.

Alexander flexed his knuckles, a dark smirk playing on his lips. "She's cruel and ungrateful, and I'm impulsive. Don't we make the perfect pair?" His laughter was low, almost mocking.

Then he turned, his expression softening as his gaze landed on Evelyn inside the car. The warmth in his eyes was unmistakable.

Evelyn couldn't hear their conversation through the storm, but when she saw Alexander's smile, she instinctively returned it, her heart fluttering despite the tension outside.

Ethan's jaw clenched, his face throbbing where Alexander's fist had connected. Beside him, Vanessa's fingers dug into his sleeve, her lips pressed into a thin line.

The sight of Alexander looking at Evelyn with such tenderness sent a sharp pang of frustration through Ethan. He barely registered the pain in his cheek anymore.

Alexander's voice cut through the rain, cold and unyielding. "Ethan, consider this your only warning. Control your woman. Spinning lies won’t work on me."

His meaning was clear—he didn’t believe a single word Vanessa had said.

Not one.

Vanessa paled, her grip on Ethan tightening. She knew the truth—Alexander had wanted to strike her, but he’d settled for Ethan instead.

Because Alexander Whitmore didn’t hit women.

Even ones who deserved it.

She had pulled Ethan into this mess.

Alexander's piercing gaze bore into her with an intensity that made the air feel thick.

Vanessa had just stumbled into a freezing puddle, her clothes soaked through. But the chill in her bones was nothing compared to the icy dread creeping through her under Alexander's unrelenting stare.

"U-Uncle Alex... why are you looking at me like that?" Vanessa stammered, her voice trembling.

The silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating.

Her fingers curled into fists, nails digging into her palms.

She had miscalculated. Badly.

Alexander took a slow step forward, his expression unreadable.

Vanessa instinctively took a step back, her breath hitching.

The tension crackled like static in the air.

She had thought she could manipulate the situation.

She had been wrong.

And now, she was trapped.

Her pulse pounded in her ears.

One wrong move, and everything would shatter.

Alexander's lips parted—

Just as a sharp knock echoed through the room.

Vanessa flinched.

The door swung open.

Nathan stood there, his expression grim.

"Sir," he said, his voice tight. "We have a problem."

Alexander didn't look away from Vanessa.

But the corner of his mouth twitched.

And that small movement sent a fresh wave of terror through her.

Because she knew—

Whatever came next would be far worse than she had imagined.

###Chapter 194 Confrontation

Vanessa bit her lips until they lost all color, her fingers clutching Ethan's sleeve as she hid behind him with visible unease.

Alexander's lips curved into a deceptively gentle smile. "Of course, I'm insisting you apologize to Evelyn."

Though his tone was light, the weight behind his words sent a ripple of tension through the room. Everyone around them stiffened, sensing the unspoken threat.

Vanessa shuddered. When Ethan remained silent, she had no choice but to step forward, her legs unsteady.

Under Alexander's unrelenting gaze, she had to comply. If she refused, he might not direct his wrath at her—but he would undoubtedly take it out on Ethan.

She couldn’t afford to let resentment fester in him.

"Aunt Evelyn… I'm sorry!" Vanessa bent at the waist, her head dipping low in a stiff ninety-degree bow. The moment she straightened, her eyes burned with unshed tears.

Humiliation scorched through her.

Her jaw clenched so tightly her teeth ached.

Her fingers curled into fists, nails digging into her palms until they turned bone-white. A flicker of fury twisted her expression, but with her head still lowered, no one noticed.

Inside, she seethed.

This wasn’t over.

The rain fell in heavy sheets, soaking Vanessa to the bone. Her shoulders shook, though whether from the cold or suppressed emotion was unclear.

Inside the car, Evelyn watched silently. Her expression remained unreadable, her gaze distant.

She knew Vanessa’s apology was hollow. But it didn’t matter anymore.

Evelyn had long since stopped caring about the Harts and their twisted version of family.

Alexander studied the quiet sorrow in Evelyn’s eyes.

From the moment he arrived, she hadn’t reacted—not to Vanessa’s accusations, not even to the cruel ultimatum of being disowned.

There was no anger. No pleading. Just resignation.

It told him everything.

The Harts had broken her. Tonight was merely the final blow.

She had endured their cruelty alone for too long.

How much pain must she have suffered to reach this point? To walk away without looking back?

His grip tightened on the steering wheel.

She deserved so much better.

The evening had been packed with business commitments, delaying his arrival. Had he come just a fraction earlier, perhaps she wouldn’t have endured everything alone.

Alexander’s fingers brushed against Evelyn’s cheek, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear before drawing her into his embrace. His voice was low, laced with concern. "Did they hurt you?"

Evelyn gave a small shake of her head.

"Anywhere else? Does your ankle still ache?" His gaze flickered downward, assessing.

"It’s fine," she murmured. "It always flares up when it rains. I’m used to it by now."

She exhaled, forcing a casual shrug. "Did coming to get me interfere with your meeting?"

"Not at all." His grip loosened gently. "Wait here for me. I won’t be long."

With that, Alexander pushed open the car door again. A sleek black umbrella snapped open in his hand as he strode toward the entrance of Hawthorne Estate.

Evelyn’s mind was sluggish, weighed down by exhaustion. By the time she registered his departure, he was already gone.

Ethan and Vanessa still lingered outside the car.

When Alexander had passed them moments ago, the air around him had turned glacial. His jaw was set, his expression unreadable—yet the storm beneath the surface was unmistakable.

The moment he stormed into the Hawthorne Estate, it was clear—Alexander was about to face Richard and Margaret head-on.

His grip on the black umbrella tightened, knuckles turning white. The calm in his eyes was terrifying, a storm barely restrained.

As the grand doors of the estate swung open, harsh light spilled out, illuminating his sharp features.

The eerie stillness of his expression only made him look more ruthless.

###Chapter 195 Three Years Project

The moment Richard Hayes spotted Alexander Whitmore's arrival, he rushed forward to personally welcome him.

This was the man who normally required weeks of scheduled appointments just for a five-minute meeting. Now he stood right at Richard's doorstep.

Richard's hands trembled with barely contained excitement. "Alexander, please come inside," he urged, gesturing toward the grand foyer.

With a sharp flick of his wrist, Alexander snapped his black umbrella shut.

Cold rainwater sprayed across Richard's face.

His custom-made suit was instantly speckled with droplets.

Before Richard could even reach for his handkerchief, Alexander pressed the sharp tip of the umbrella handle against his throat.

The polished leather of Alexander's shoes clicked ominously against the marble floor as he advanced. Each measured step echoed like a death knell through the cavernous hallway.

The predatory glint in Alexander's steel-gray eyes made Richard's blood run cold.

He stumbled backward, his polished loafers squeaking against the wet floor.

For all his decades as a ruthless business tycoon, Richard found himself completely disarmed before Alexander's terrifying presence.

The man who had built an empire through intimidation now found himself at the mercy of someone far more dangerous.

The tension in the air was palpable as Evelyn realized Alexander had come with one purpose—to make them pay.

"Alexander, let's discuss this rationally. We're still family," she said, forcing calm into her voice.

"Family?" His laugh was icy, devoid of any warmth. "Evelyn has already severed ties with you. What family are you talking about?"

The moment those words left his lips, Richard and Margaret stiffened in shock.

How does Alexander know what happened?

And since when did Evelyn matter this much to him?

Richard recovered first, carefully pushing aside the tip of the umbrella pointed at him.

Realizing Alexander was here for Evelyn’s sake, he quickly backtracked. "Sever ties? That’s absurd! Evelyn is still a Hayes! She’s my daughter—that will never change!"

A public disownment would be a scandal among high society. Richard would never admit to it.

Besides, if Alexander truly valued Evelyn now, Richard would do everything to keep her close. Cutting ties was the last thing he wanted.

Alexander’s lips curled into a cold smirk. His piercing gaze held no mercy.

Then his eyes landed on the torn dress scattered across the floor. The temperature in the room seemed to drop instantly.

"She’s your daughter, yet this is how you treat her?" His voice was dangerously low.

Richard's face froze. He hadn't anticipated Alexander would decipher his scheme this fast.

"Evelyn is my wife. If she asks, naturally I'd assist her family." Alexander's voice was smooth as silk yet carried an unshakable authority. "A handful of projects? I'd contemplate handing Horizon Enterprises every Titan Capital Group contract for the next three years."

Richard's pupils dilated at the declaration.

"Three years' worth?" His mind reeled.

He recalled a nearly insolvent firm that landed one Titan Capital deal—it skyrocketed to industry dominance overnight, elevating all its subsidiaries.

But three years of projects?

This wasn't just prosperity. This was dynastic wealth.

Richard's fingers trembled against his champagne flute as visions of Horizon Enterprises eclipsing competitors consumed him.

Alexander observed the avarice darkening Richard's gaze with icy amusement.

Then, like a guillotine dropping, his tone shifted.

"Yet today, you wounded her." Alexander's knuckles whitened around his glass. "How shall we address that?"

The temperature in the room plummeted.

His fingers drummed impatiently against the polished mahogany desk.

Vanessa's expression darkened as she read the report in her hands.

"Horizon Enterprises has completely vanished from the market. Alexander must have lost his mind!"

Her voice was sharp, laced with disbelief and simmering anger.

Across the room, Ethan Caldwell leaned back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips.

"Or," he drawled, "he's playing a game we don't understand yet."

Vanessa shot him a glare.

"You think this is some kind of strategy? Wiping out an entire billion-dollar venture overnight?"

Ethan shrugged, his gaze drifting to the city skyline beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Alexander Whitmore doesn't make moves without reason. If he erased Horizon, he has a plan."

Silence settled between them, heavy with tension.

Vanessa exhaled sharply, tossing the report onto the desk.

"Then we find out what it is."

Ethan's smirk widened.

"Good luck with that."

Her eyes narrowed.

"You're not helping?"

He stood, straightening his suit jacket with deliberate ease.

"Oh, I will. But not for free."

Vanessa crossed her arms.

"What do you want?"

Ethan's gaze flickered with something unreadable.

"Let's just say... I have my own interests in this."

Before she could respond, he strode out of the office, leaving her alone with her thoughts.

And the unsettling realization that Alexander Whitmore was always three steps ahead.

###Chapter 196 The Reckoning

Alexander's words struck Richard like a bolt of lightning.

He knew these weren't empty threats.

With Titan Capital's influence, Alexander could dismantle Horizon Enterprises effortlessly.

He didn't even need to erase the company entirely. A single strategic move would cripple their operations beyond repair.

What shocked Richard most was Alexander's motivation—this was all for Evelyn.

Just how deeply had she ensnared him?

Richard's mind raced as he reassessed his daughter's position.

She was no longer the powerless girl he could manipulate.

Not with Alexander standing behind her like an unshakable fortress.

His expression shifted as realization dawned.

"Alexander, let's not be hasty!" Richard raised his hands in surrender. "This is all a misunderstanding. Evelyn still holds shares in Horizon Enterprises—she's family!"

His voice turned pleading. "The villa? Of course it's hers. I'll speak to Vanessa immediately. Everything will be transferred to Evelyn's name by tomorrow."

Sweat beaded on his forehead as he waited for Alexander's response.

The air crackled with tension.

One wrong move, and his empire would crumble.

All because he'd underestimated his own daughter.

Alexander's words struck Vanessa like a physical blow. Her breath caught in her throat as she stared at him in disbelief. Just moments ago, he'd said something entirely different!

Her nails dug into her palms as she fought to keep silent. A subtle shake of Alexander's head warned her to hold her tongue.

Now wasn't the time for objections. Not when everything hung in the balance.

"Furthermore," Alexander continued smoothly, "I'll be transferring all future dividends from Horizon Enterprises to Evelyn as well."

Richard Hayes remained stone-faced, so Alexander pressed on. "We've withheld financial support these past years because Evelyn never required extravagant sums. And frankly, I worried she might squander it recklessly."

A derisive snort escaped Richard.

"Evelyn has no interest in material possessions or your money, Mr. Hayes," Richard countered coldly. "She's severed all ties with you. There's no reason for her to accept anything from you now."

Alexander stiffened visibly.

Richard leaned forward, his voice dropping to a dangerous timbre. "Let me make one thing perfectly clear. My sole purpose today was to deliver a warning."

His next words sent chills down Alexander's spine.

"Horizon Enterprises has caught my attention."

The blood drained from Alexander's face.

Before he could formulate a response, Richard delivered his final blow. "And I always get what I want."

Alexander's expression darkened into something truly terrifying. His lips parted to speak—

The rain poured relentlessly as Alexander Whitmore opened his black umbrella and disappeared into the stormy night.

Vanessa Hart stepped back inside, her voice trembling. "Father, are you seriously giving the estate to Evelyn? And the dividends—"

Richard Hayes clenched his jaw, frustration simmering beneath the surface. Alexander's final words had struck like a blade.

A chilling realization settled over him—his treatment of Evelyn might very well dictate the future of Horizon Enterprises.

"What you should be worrying about," Richard snapped, "is what happens if Alexander decides to dismantle Horizon Enterprises!"

Vanessa paled, the gravity of the situation finally dawning on her. She turned to Ethan Caldwell, desperation in her eyes.

"Ethan, do you think Uncle Alexander would actually destroy Horizon Enterprises?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ethan hesitated, his thoughts tangled.

He didn’t want to believe Alexander would go to such lengths—all for Evelyn.

"Uncle Alexander has always kept business and personal matters separate," Ethan said slowly. "He wouldn’t."

A collective exhale filled the room.

Meanwhile, Alexander slid into the backseat of his car, where Evelyn Carter sat waiting, her expression unreadable in the dim light.

Her bare feet, smooth and delicate, curled against the black leather seat. A half-empty bottle of wine dangled precariously from her fingertips. Her eyes, usually sharp and alert, were now swollen and tinged with red.

Confusion swam in her gaze, mixing with an almost childlike innocence.

The wine had been a parting gift from a business associate at tonight's engagement party. Alexander had intended to add it to his prized collection in the cellar.

But Evelyn had other plans.

She’d already downed half the bottle before he could even start the car.

Rain had soaked her to the bone. Though the car’s heater hummed softly, she’d heard alcohol could warm a person faster. Besides, her mood was foul, her ankle throbbed, and the world felt like it was spinning.

When Alexander slid into the driver’s seat, Evelyn shook her head, trying to clear the fog.

The face before her wavered, splitting into two.

She blinked slowly, lips parting in drunken wonder. "Why... are there two Alexanders?"

###Chapter 197 Hazy Moments

Alexander's voice was laced with concern. "Have you been drinking too much?"

Evelyn blinked slowly. "No... I'm perfectly sober."

Her vision swam slightly. Every movement felt delayed, her words thick like honey.

1/4

Alexander sighed, brushing a stray curl from her flushed cheek. "If you're hurting, let it out. Drowning in alcohol won't heal anything."

Evelyn remained silent, as if processing his words through fog. She mumbled again, "I told you... I'm not drunk."

A smirk tugged at Alexander's lips. "Prove it then. Kiss me."

Evelyn froze.

His gaze burned into hers, intense and unwavering. "If you're truly sober, this should be easy."

"Really?"

She pressed her palms to her overheated cheeks, tilting her head in consideration.

Her eyes dropped to his mouth—that sharp, tempting curve. With a soft exhale, she leaned forward.

Rain drummed against the car roof in a rhythmic tattoo.

2/4

Water cascaded down the windows, cocooning them in their own private world. The storm erased everything beyond this intimate space.

The air between them grew thick, charged.

Their breaths tangled as Evelyn lifted trembling hands to frame Alexander's face.

When their eyes locked, his throat moved visibly.

Just as their lips were about to meet—

Evelyn swayed.

Her mouth grazed past his, landing clumsily against his collarbone instead.

Alexander shuddered.

His pulse roared in his ears. Tendons stood stark along his clenched hands.

Then Evelyn melted against him, boneless and warm. Her entire body molded to his chest.

One heartbeat.

Two.

Alexander's ribs threatened to crack from the force of his pounding heart.

The woman in his arms was undeniably, devastatingly intoxicated.

Every touch was accidental, yet it set his blood ablaze.

She was warm and pliant against him, completely unaware as she nestled into his chest. Deep in slumber, her breathing was soft and even.

Her delicate fingers curled around his waist, sending an electric jolt through his body. Alexander stiffened instantly, every muscle taut with tension.

His Adam's apple moved visibly as he swallowed hard, fighting to keep his control in check.

His palm traced slow circles along her back, his voice rough with barely restrained desire when he finally spoke.

"Evelyn," he murmured, his breath hot against her ear. "Wake up. Kiss me again."

She didn’t stir.

Frustration coiled inside him. He tilted her chin up, forcing her to face him.

Then, with deliberate intent, he pressed her back against the seat, caging her beneath him.

Alexander leaned in, his thumb brushing her cheek before his lips captured hers in a searing kiss.

Heat surged through him, his mouth demanding, possessive.

Still asleep, Evelyn turned her face away, a faint whimper escaping her as she tried to evade him.

But he wouldn’t let her.

His fingers laced through hers, pinning her hand beside her head as he deepened the kiss.

Their breaths tangled, their bodies flush.

And still, she didn’t wake.

Her hands trembled as she was forced into submission.

The man’s throat worked, his Adam’s apple bobbing with a rough swallow. A dark, humorless laugh slipped past his lips.

"Evelyn, even if you're drunk now, it doesn’t matter. You’ll be mine eventually. Just wait."

Outside, the sleek black Bentley rolled past, its headlights cutting through the dimly lit street.

Ethan Caldwell gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles whitening.

Spotting Alexander Whitmore’s vintage car parked haphazardly by the curb, his instincts screamed at him to stop.

The driver’s seat was empty.

As his high beams swept across the interior, the scene froze him in place.

Evelyn was pressed into the backseat, her face flushed, eyes tightly shut. Alexander had her pinned, his mouth trailing down her neck.

Their bodies were tangled, lost in a heated embrace that left no room for misinterpretation.

Ethan’s jaw clenched so hard his teeth ached.

The rain-slicked road blurred before him.

His mind went blank, his grip on reality slipping.

The car had barely traveled two hundred meters when—

Crash.

The impact was deafening as the Bentley plowed straight into a flower bed, metal crunching against concrete.
###Chapter 198 Outburst

The airbags exploded with a deafening pop.

Vanessa, seated beside Ethan, gasped as her phone flew up and struck her cheekbone. A sharp pain shot through her face.

She turned to Ethan, trembling. "W-what just happened?"

She had been scrolling mindlessly, oblivious to the chaos outside.

The impact left an angry red mark blooming across her forehead.

The violent jerk of the airbag snapped Ethan back to awareness.

Without hesitation, he ripped off his seatbelt and threw open the car door, plunging into the storm.

Rain lashed at his face as he sprinted toward the empty parking space where Alexander's car had been moments before.

Vanessa, bewildered, stumbled after him, her heels slipping on the wet pavement.

Ethan reached the spot, panting.

Nothing.

Alexander was gone.

The downpour soaked through his clothes as he stood there, fists clenched, staring at the vacant space where his rival had vanished.

Vanessa stepped forward and wrapped her arms around Ethan's waist from behind. "Ethan, what's going on?" she murmured against his back.

His voice was rough when he spoke. "Do you think they've been intimate?"

Vanessa stiffened, realization dawning.

So, this was about Evelyn.

Had he been so consumed by thoughts of her that he'd crashed into the flowerbed?

A sharp pang of jealousy twisted inside her as she bit down on her lower lip.

"Of course they have," she said, her tone dripping with venom. "Didn't you see how Alexander defended her tonight? He's never been with a woman before. She must have... satisfied him in ways that made him protective of her."

Each word was a blade, carving deeper into Ethan's chest.

"She doesn't even love him," he muttered, more to himself than to her. "How could she give herself to him?"

Vanessa tightened her embrace, pressing herself against him. "That's just who she is. She'll use anything—even her body—to get what she wants."

Rising onto her toes, she brushed her lips against his.

"Ethan, I'm the only one who truly loves you. I'm your wife. Please... just look at me."

Since their wedding night, Ethan had barely touched her.

At first, he'd been ill, feverish—she hadn't pushed him. But even after he recovered, he always had excuses. Late-night meetings. Business dinners.

They were married, yet he felt miles away.

Tonight, she refused to let him pull away again.

Rainwater slicked their skin as she pressed closer, her body molding against his.

Ethan's expression was hollow—until the memory of Alexander kissing Evelyn flashed through his mind.

His breath turned ragged.

Anger surged, hot and uncontrollable.

He seized Vanessa's lips in a punishing kiss, teeth scraping flesh as if he could purge his fury through the contact.

Vanessa gasped, pulling back. "Ethan—!"

His eyes burned with something dark, dangerous.

Without a word, he grabbed her wrist and dragged her toward the car.

The back door flew open.

He shoved her inside.

The impact left her dazed, her vision swimming as the door slammed shut behind them.

His belt clattered to the floor.

Vanessa's breath hitched. "Ethan, please—not like this."

The wreckage of the Bentley surrounded them—glass shards glittering like fallen stars, the headlights smashed beyond recognition.

The deployed airbags sagged limply in the front seats.

This was supposed to be their first time since the wedding.

But this?

This wasn't love.

Vanessa fought back, her nails digging into the leather seats, but Ethan overpowered her effortlessly.

No tenderness. No warning.

Just the brutal press of his body against hers as rain hammered the ruined car.

She cried out, but the storm swallowed her voice.

Ethan was relentless, his movements sharp and punishing.

He wasn't making love to his wife.

He was punishing her.

Tears blurred her vision, but the worst came at the very end.

As he shuddered against her, one name tore from his lips—

"Evelyn."

The humiliation burned deeper than any pain.

To be continued...
###Chapter 199 The Shadow of Another

The instant Ethan murmured Evelyn's name, Vanessa's carefully constructed facade crumbled.

Her fingers dug into his arms like claws. "Ethan, am I just her replacement?" Her voice trembled with barely suppressed fury. "I'm your wife. How could you humiliate me like this?"

Tears streamed down Vanessa's cheeks, her delicate face drained of color. The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth from how hard she was biting her lip.

The betrayal cut deeper than any blade.

After everything—after finally becoming Mrs. Caldwell—he had the audacity to whisper another woman's name in their most intimate moment.

Ethan snapped back to reality as if doused in ice water.

He released her immediately, watching helplessly as Vanessa's shoulders shook with silent sobs. Straightening his disheveled shirt, he retreated to the driver's seat without explanation.

A restless energy thrummed beneath his skin.

Seeing Alexander claim Evelyn so possessively had ignited something primal in him—something he couldn't rationalize. He wasn't a man ruled by impulse, yet when Vanessa had initiated—

His mind was consumed by her.

Every time Ethan Caldwell closed his eyes, Evelyn Carter's face appeared before him.

When he regained his senses and saw Vanessa Hart beneath him, disappointment crashed over him like a wave.

A dark, shameful thought slithered through his mind—he wished it had been Evelyn instead.

He imagined kissing her, wondered how she would react. Would her cheeks flush? Would her lips tremble beneath his?

The urge to pull her into his arms, to claim her, was unbearable.

"Why?" His fingers tightened around the bedsheets.

Ethan was furious—not at Vanessa, but at himself. He couldn't deny it anymore. He wanted Evelyn. Desperately.

With a sharp inhale, he lit a cigarette, the ember glowing in the dim room. One after another, he smoked, as if the nicotine could burn away his thoughts.

For seven years, Evelyn had chased him. Seven years, and yet he had never touched her.

But he had loved her.

No one knew—not even her. The day he had found her cornered outside the school bathroom, her eyes wide with fear, something inside him had shifted.

That was the moment he fell.

Otherwise, why would Ethan Caldwell, heir to the Aniston fortune, have spent three years watching over her?

Why would he have cared at all?

The cigarette burned between Ethan's fingers, its ember glowing in the dim light.

Instead of calming him, the smoke only deepened his irritation.

Vanessa sat silently in the backseat, her mind racing.

She had no idea what Ethan was thinking, but she was certain it wasn’t about her.

The possibility that he might be dwelling on Evelyn made her blood boil.

"Ethan," she said coldly, "have you forgotten what she did three years ago?"

His entire body tensed.

"Three years ago, to get those men to kidnap me, she offered herself to them. She bargained with her own body."

Vanessa's lips curled in disgust. "And now? She’s marrying your uncle for money. What part of her is even worth remembering?"

Ethan’s silence was heavy, his breathing ragged.

She was right.

He had almost let himself forget.

Evelyn had been tainted long ago.

While they were engaged, he had never touched her—yet she had given herself so easily to those worthless thugs.

The thought made his stomach churn.

How could he still feel anything for someone like that?

Sunlight streamed through the curtains as Evelyn Carter blinked awake.

The plush mattress beneath her felt foreign yet comforting. She glanced down at her silk pajamas, perfectly intact.

Memories of last night came flooding back in fragments.

She recalled waiting in Alexander's car, the leather seats cold against her skin. The dashboard clock had ticked past midnight when she'd reached for the whiskey bottle.

Halfway through her third glass, headlights had cut through the darkness. Alexander's silhouette appeared at the driver's door.

Then everything went hazy.

Her fingers trembled as they traced the constellation of love bites along her collarbone. The purple marks stood out starkly against her pale skin.

A sudden flash of memory - her arms wrapped around Alexander's neck in the foyer, begging him to join her in the shower. The scent of his cologne mixed with whiskey as he carried her upstairs.

Her phone buzzed on the nightstand.

200 missed calls from Daniel Pierce.

The screen displayed a breaking news alert: Titan Capital Group CEO Alexander Whitmore spotted leaving Eclipse Lounge with mystery woman.

Beneath the headline, a blurred photo showed Alexander carrying a woman whose face was buried in his chest.

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

The woman's Louboutins were unmistakably hers.
###Chapter 200 The Telltale Bite

Oh heavens, this was beyond mortifying!

Last night, Evelyn hadn't taken that bath after all, but Alexander had indeed helped her change into her silk pajamas.

Just recalling it made her cheeks burn scarlet.

What else had transpired?

She strained her memory...

Propping herself up on one elbow, Evelyn glanced toward the ensuite bathroom—then suddenly clutched her face with both hands, emitting a muffled shriek into her palms!

It came flooding back.

Alexander, believing her asleep, had gathered his sleepwear and stepped into the shower.

But midway through his bathing ritual...

She'd awoken in a wine-hazed daze, pushed open the steamed glass door, and stumbled inside!

"Sweet merciful skies!"

Evelyn collapsed backward onto the king-sized bed, burying her flaming face in the duvet as if she could smother the memory.

The worst part?

She distinctly remembered pausing to admire the water cascading over Alexander's sculpted shoulders before he'd spun around with that startled expression.

And the bite mark.

Dear lord, the unmistakable crescent-shaped imprint she'd left on his collarbone when he'd carried her back to bed.

The evidence would still be there at breakfast.

Evelyn groaned into the Egyptian cotton sheets, her toes curling in humiliation. How would she ever face him across the breakfast table now?

Somewhere beneath the pillows, her phone buzzed with an incoming message—probably Claire demanding details about last night's charity gala.

As if anything could distract her from this fresh hell.

The ensuite door clicked open.

Evelyn froze.

Alexander's rich baritone cut through her panic: "Darling, are you planning to suffocate yourself before coffee?"

She clutched the duvet tighter. Maybe if she pretended to be asleep...

The mattress dipped beside her. Warm fingers brushed her tangled auburn hair aside. "I believe this belongs to you."

Against her bare shoulder, he placed something cool and metallic—her missing diamond earring from last night.

Evelyn peeked one emerald eye open.

And there it was—that faint, perfect bite mark visible above his unbuttoned shirt collar.

Alexander's lips quirked. "Sleepwalking again, sweetheart?"

She yanked the covers over her head with another strangled whimper.

This wasn't happening.

It absolutely wasn't happening.

"Did I really see all that? How am I supposed to look Alexander in the eye now?"

After such an embarrassing moment, maybe she should just feign temporary amnesia.

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson. Even now, with her eyes closed, the memory played vividly in her mind.

In that confined, steamy space, she had been pinned against the tiled wall by a dripping-wet Alexander.

His sculpted muscles were mere inches from her face. When she dared to glance up, his smoldering gaze locked onto hers—more unsettling than the raw hunger he'd shown when he'd kissed her without warning.

The shower spray cascaded over them both, the water running in rivulets down their heated skin.

His breathing was ragged, his stare unapologetically intense as he loomed over her, casting her in shadow.

Evelyn's pulse roared in her ears.

Alexander braced one arm against the wall, leaning in until his lips nearly brushed her ear. "Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured, voice rough, "did you barge in here because you wanted to join me?"

A strangled noise escaped her throat.

God, that couldn’t have been her. That couldn’t have been her response.

But it was.

Her memory was frustratingly blank.

Evelyn pressed her palms against her flushed cheeks, desperately trying to recall if things had escalated beyond what she could remember.

Every muscle in her body ached when she woke up, as if she had run a marathon in her sleep.

The alarm blared on schedule. She slapped her cheeks lightly, forcing herself to focus, then rushed out the door toward Titan Capital Group.

During the commute, her fingers hovered over her phone screen. She typed out a message to Alexander—then immediately deleted it.

Too awkward.

The moment she stepped into the office, hushed whispers reached her ears. Cassandra and Natalie were huddled together, eyes gleaming with scandalous excitement.

"Absolutely! No doubt he’s a beast in bed!"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Who is?"

"Mr. Whitmore! You missed it—when he walked in this morning, everyone saw it!" Natalie gushed. "A fresh, deep bite mark right on his throat! Bright red! His wife must’ve gone wild last night!"

Cassandra nodded eagerly. "Can you believe it? Alexander Whitmore—the man who never loses control—finally snapped! Who is this mystery woman who managed to bring him to his knees?"

Then, noticing Evelyn’s frozen expression, Cassandra abruptly cut herself off.

A sharp realization dawned on her.

Oh no.

"So... I bit Alexander last night?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she stared at her reflection in the office window.

How could she not remember a single thing?

Just then, Simon approached and lightly tapped on her desk. "Mr. Whitmore didn't sleep well. Make him his usual coffee and bring it in."

Her stomach twisted.

She hadn't sorted through the mess of emotions from last night. She wasn't ready to face him—not after whatever had happened.

Evelyn swallowed hard, already forming the words to ask if someone else could deliver it instead.

But Simon, as if reading her mind, gave her a knowing look.

"Mr. Whitmore was very specific," he said smoothly. "He only wants the coffee you make."

Her pulse jumped.

Why did that sound like a challenge?
###Chapter 201 The Violin

The moment those words were spoken, every assistant in the office turned their attention toward Evelyn.

"Mr. Whitmore seems to have a special preference for the coffee you brew."

"Go on, don't keep him waiting!"

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn carried the coffee into his office, where Alexander sat behind his desk.

His shirt was slightly undone, the top two buttons unfastened.

The fresh… bite marks on his throat stood out vividly against his skin, still flushed red.

Evelyn quickly looked away, her pulse quickening. The sight brought back the memory of last night—the dim lighting, the confined space of the restroom, the heat between them.

She lowered her gaze, her cheeks warming. "Mr. Whitmore, your coffee."

Alexander’s fingers brushed lightly over the marks, his lips curving into a knowing smirk. "About last night—"

"I don’t remember anything from last night!" Evelyn blurted out, her voice laced with flustered guilt.

A knowing glint flickered in Alexander's gaze, but he chose not to call her out on the obvious lie.

"Come here."

Evelyn remained silent, her fingers twisting nervously in the fabric of her dress.

"Weren’t you bold enough to barge into the bathroom while I was showering?" His voice was low, teasing. "Why so shy now? Can’t even stand next to me?"

Her nails dug lightly into her palm.

Of all the things to remind her of—last night’s impulsive decision was already mortifying enough. Did he have to bring it up?

Alexander relented, amusement still lacing his tone. "Come look at this."

Finally lifting her gaze, Evelyn’s breath caught at the sight of the cello resting beside his desk.

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

The rich mahogany wood gleamed under the light, its polished curves radiating elegance. She recognized it instantly—the same instrument that had been featured in headlines just weeks ago.

A 20-million-dollar masterpiece, displayed in a prestigious museum.

Rumored to have belonged to a world-renowned cellist whose concerts sold out within minutes, tickets reselling for obscene amounts.

And now, impossibly, it was here. In Alexander’s study.

Such treasures were rare to find.

Yet Alexander had somehow acquired the violinist's most prized possession.

Evelyn approached the instrument with reverence, her fingers tracing its polished curves. "This... is for me?"

Alexander gave a single nod.

The previous evening at Hawthorne Estate, the moment he stepped inside, his eyes had fallen upon the shattered remains of her violin scattered across the floor.

Understanding struck him instantly. Without hesitation, he'd arranged for its replacement.

By dawn, he was already at the airport, personally retrieving the priceless instrument before bringing it straight to her.

Evelyn didn't know the lengths Alexander had gone to—the negotiations, the favors called in—but one glance at the violin told her everything. Convincing the renowned musician to part with it must have been nearly impossible.

Her chest tightened with emotion.

"Would you play something?" Alexander moved aside, giving her space.

Evelyn hesitated. "Now? But we're at work."

He smirked. "The annual gala isn't for days. Everyone in the executive office is loyal to us. No one will mind." His voice softened. "Besides... I've been wanting to hear you play."

The way he looked at her—expectant, almost eager—made resistance impossible.

Evelyn lifted the violin to her shoulder, the weight familiar and comforting.

As the first note resonated through the office, Alexander's expression shifted into something unreadable.

But Evelyn didn't notice.

She was already lost in the music.

Alexander had never witnessed Evelyn play the cello before.

She gave a quiet nod, settling gracefully onto the chair. Her fingers, delicate yet sure, curled around the neck of the instrument as she positioned the bow.

Though Alexander knew nothing of music, the way Evelyn lost herself in the rhythm was mesmerizing. The bow glided effortlessly, pulling forth a rich, melancholic sound that filled the room.

The notes were deep and resonant, weaving a tale of longing and quiet sorrow.

His gaze lingered on her, unwavering, completely entranced by the way the dim light caught the curve of her lashes, the faint press of her lips as she concentrated.

A thought struck him—if she weren’t dressed in her usual sharp blazer, but something softer, something flowing, she would look like a masterpiece brought to life.

He made a silent vow.

He would find her the most exquisite gown, something that would make her shine brighter than any star at the annual gala.

Let the others watch in envy.

Let them see what he already knew.

###Chapter 202 The Melody

The final note of the cello lingered in the air before dissolving into silence. Evelyn ran her fingers along the smooth wood, her heart swelling with affection.

She adored it more than words could express.

Alexander smirked, leaning against the doorframe. "Waking up at 4 AM to retrieve it from the airport was worth it, then."

Evelyn's breath caught.

That explained why his side of the bed had been empty when she woke.

He had gone himself—despite his relentless schedule—just to bring her the instrument.

Her cheeks warmed as she met his gaze. "Alexander... thank you."

His eyes darkened, tracing the flush on her skin. "Thank me?" His voice dropped, rough with promise. "I'll collect my gratitude properly tonight."

Her pulse stuttered.

The way he looked at her—like he could already taste her surrender—sent heat spiraling through her veins.

"You claimed you forgot last night," he murmured, stepping closer. "But I remember every detail." His thumb brushed her lower lip. "And I intend to remind you."

"I wouldn't mind helping you remember every detail."

Evelyn wasn't foolish—she caught Alexander's meaning instantly.

He wanted to jog her memory, but she...her face burned with embarrassment.

Just then, Simon's knock interrupted them. "Mr. Whitmore, your board meeting starts in five minutes."

Alexander hummed in acknowledgment before pulling Evelyn onto his lap, his lips brushing the sensitive skin of her neck as he inhaled her familiar lavender scent.

Her pulse skyrocketed.

A tremble ran through her when his teeth grazed that spot below her ear—the one that always made her knees weak.

"I have business to attend to, Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured against her flushed skin. "Don't forget to miss me."

Evelyn sprang up, her heart pounding wildly.

She fanned her heated cheeks and trailed after him, exiting the office in his shadow.

The moment Alexander disappeared around the corner, Natalie pounced.

"Was that you playing violin earlier? It was breathtaking! Titan Capital won't be dead last at this year's gala after all!"

Natalie's eyes sparkled with excitement as she linked arms with Evelyn. "You've been holding out on us! When did you learn to play like that?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond when Victoria appeared, balancing three coffee cups. "Here—I brought reinforcements." She handed one to Evelyn with a knowing smile. "You'll need this after whatever just happened in there. The whole floor heard that concerto."

Cassandra joined them, fanning herself dramatically. "If I didn't know better, I'd say Mr. Whitmore was composing his own symphony with you as the lead instrument."

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee as heat flooded her face again.

Natalie gasped, clutching Evelyn's arm. "Wait—does this mean you two finally—"

"Not another word," Evelyn warned, though her lips twitched.

The women dissolved into laughter just as Gregory rounded the corner, looking harried. "Ladies, unless you want me to report this little gathering to HR—"

"We're going!" they chorused, scattering back to their desks.

But Evelyn's fingers still tingled where Alexander had held them, and her neck still burned from his lips.

She touched the spot absently, a secret smile playing on her lips as she remembered his parting words.

As if she could ever forget to miss him.

Evelyn's fingers hesitated over the cello strings, producing a few off-key notes that made her wince.

Years had dulled her technique, but to an untrained ear, it still sounded passable.

With the annual gala just days away, she had enough time to polish her skills into something presentable.

Cassandra grinned, waving her phone. "I told my team we'd steal the show this year. My boyfriend didn't believe me—just sent him proof."

Last year, Natalie's painfully earnest poetry recitation had branded the CEO's office staff as talentless workaholics.

A betting pool had even sprung up in Titan Capital's internal chat, speculating whether this year's performance would be worse.

In the marketing department's lounge, Dominic Reeves absently stirred his coffee while tapping the video Cassandra had sent.

The rich, melancholic strains of a cello spilled from his speakers.

Near the hallway window, Ethan Caldwell froze mid-drag on his cigarette, the music snaring his attention like a hook.

"That tune... wasn't this what I heard when I was unconscious after his accident?" The realization struck him like lightning.

The haunting melody, the raw emotion—it clawed at a buried memory in the depths of his soul.

Ethan Caldwell stubbed out his cigarette so forcefully the ashtray rattled. He stormed into the lounge without hesitation.

Dominic Reeves nearly spilled his freshly poured coffee. "Mr. Caldwell?"

Without explanation, Ethan seized the younger man's phone. His knuckles turned white around the device.

"Where did you get this?" The demand came out sharper than intended.

"My girlfriend sent it. Said it's a performance piece for Titan Capital's annual gala—some junior executive in her department is playing it."

Ethan's gaze turned glacial. "Which department?"

"The Chairman's Office at Titan Capital."

A muscle twitched in Ethan's jaw. The pieces were falling into place with terrifying clarity.

###Chapter 203 Stomach Perforation

Evelyn had indulged in too much wine last night and hadn’t gone to Claire’s place to keep her company. A sudden worry gnawed at her—was Claire alright alone?

During her lunch break, assuming Claire would be awake by then, Evelyn dialed her number.

"Claire? Are you okay? Are you at home?"

Claire’s voice came through, groggy and irritated as she rubbed her temples. "I’m at the hospital."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

"What happened? Are you sick? I’m coming right now."

She jabbed the elevator button, racing through the lobby to flag down a cab.

"It’s not me. It’s Lucas. He’s hospitalized."

Evelyn’s expression twisted into something unreadable. "You two…"

In the backseat of the taxi, Evelyn pieced together the story.

Last night, Lucas had downed fifteen bottles of liquor. After Simon dropped him off, he collapsed onto his bed and passed out cold.

That night's sleep nearly cost him everything.

Lucas Bennett awoke in the pitch-black hours, his body wracked with excruciating pain. His trembling fingers fumbled for his phone, dialing Claire Dawson's number with desperate urgency.

Silence.

Gritting his teeth, he summoned the last of his strength to call emergency services instead.

"Gastric perforation," the surgeon Harrison Wells announced gravely. "Another hour and we might've lost you." The doctor's stern gaze met Lucas's. "You'll need family present for post-op care."

But Lucas's parents were vacationing overseas as usual. His only emergency contact? Claire.

Still no response.

It was the hospital staff who finally tracked her down.

When Evelyn Carter arrived at Cresthaven Medical Center, Claire had already been keeping vigil since dawn.

Lucas drifted in and out of consciousness, only fully surfacing moments before Evelyn's arrival.

Noticing Claire's pallor, Evelyn's eyes dropped to her friend's midsection. "You should rest."

"I'm fine," Claire murmured, though dark circles shadowed her eyes.

On the bed, Lucas lay frighteningly still, his complexion ashen against the stark white sheets. The emergency surgery had left him fragile, every shallow breath a visible effort.

The moment Lucas Bennett laid eyes on Claire Dawson, his vision blurred with unshed tears. "Claire..."

Claire studied him with an unreadable expression.

She had just learned from the doctor that Lucas had consumed fifteen bottles of alcohol in a single sitting.

"Don't ever do that again," she murmured.

Noticing the sheen of cold sweat on his forehead, she reached for a tissue and dabbed it gently across his skin.

"You got lucky this time. The doctor said if it happens again, you might not wake up."

Lucas seized her wrist. "Does this mean you still care? Claire, tell me you still feel something for me."

Claire remained silent, her gaze steady and unflinching.

Though weak from his ordeal, Lucas's emotions surged violently. "Let's not go through with the divorce. Please, Claire. Give me one more chance."

"But I've given you too many chances already." Her voice was barely above a whisper, fragile as a breath.

"This time is different!" His grip tightened desperately. "Isabella and I are over. There's nothing left between us! If you just say yes, nothing will stand in our way!"

The conversation was interrupted by a soft knock at the door.

Julian Mercer stood there, holding a plush lumbar pillow.

Lucas Bennett’s expression darkened the moment he saw him. "Why did you bring him here, Claire? What are you trying to prove?"

Ignoring Lucas, Julian stepped forward and carefully placed the pillow behind Claire’s back, ensuring she was comfortable.

Seeing Lucas’s obvious irritation, Julian lowered his gaze. "I’ll go prepare some fruit."

Claire shook her head. "No need. He can’t eat anything right now. Just stay here with me."

Lucas’s jaw tightened.

His eyes burned with frustration. "Claire, is this some kind of sick joke? You bring him here while I’m like this? Are you trying to give me a heart attack? Do you want me to die from anger?"

Julian hesitated, his voice barely above a whisper. "Claire, maybe I should go."

"No." She reached out and grasped his hand firmly. "You’re staying."

Lucas looked like he was about to explode.

###Chapter 204 The Ultimatum

Lucas's fist crashed onto the hospital bed with such force that the IV line jerked violently, crimson liquid snaking backward through the tube.

"Claire, you're heartless!" His voice was raw, eyes burning with a mix of fury and anguish. The usually composed man looked shattered, his jaw clenched so tight it trembled. "After everything… You were the one who loved me. How could you do this?"

"The woman who loved you died the day you betrayed her." Claire's voice was ice, her fingers tightening around the folder in her hands. "And I will keep Julian. Sign the papers, Lucas."

She dropped the divorce agreement in front of him, the crisp white pages stark against the sterile hospital sheets.

Lucas didn’t even glance at it. With a snarl, he seized the documents and shredded them in one brutal motion, scattering the pieces like confetti across the floor.

His chest heaved as he leaned forward, his voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "You’re mine, Claire. Until the day I die, you stay mine. Divorce? Never. And you sure as hell won’t be with another man."

Claire didn’t flinch. "I’m keeping Julian."

A dark, humorless laugh escaped him. "Then I’ll have him ruined."

"Have you lost your mind? What did he ever do to deserve this?"

"Exactly. He's done nothing wrong. So why drag him into our mess?"

As the words hung in the air, the sound of a wheelchair rolling across the floor echoed from the doorway.

It was Isabella.

After her fall down the stairs, she had suffered a severe concussion and multiple fractures.

Now, despite her injuries, she had insisted on coming, supported by her caregiver.

Her limbs were wrapped in bandages, her usually pristine appearance now disheveled and frail.

"Lucas! How did you end up with a perforated stomach? Claire, he chose you. Why didn’t you protect him?"

Evelyn’s fists clenched the moment she saw Isabella.

"How dare you question Claire? Who do you think you are?"

A flicker of guilt crossed Isabella’s face. "I’m Lucas’s friend. Don’t I have the right to care about him?"

"Enough!"

Lucas’s sharp voice cut through the tension.

He noticed immediately how Claire’s expression darkened at Isabella’s words.

The tension between Lucas and Claire had reached an all-time low. Just when things couldn't get worse, Isabella decided to barge in uninvited.

Hadn't he made himself perfectly clear the other day?

Realizing Isabella was deliberately stirring trouble, Lucas's expression darkened. His voice was icy as he snapped, "Isabella, get out before I make you regret it."

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes as she stared at him. "Lucas, I just want to take care of you. That's all..."

Before Lucas could respond, Claire rose from her seat.

"Then come in. You can take better care of him from up close." She turned to Lucas, her tone deceptively light. "Since you have company, I'll leave you to it."

With that, she casually looped her arm through Julian's.

"Didn't you promise last night you'd show me around your campus?" Her lips curved into a faint smile. "Let's go stargazing on the field tonight. Just like old times."

Julian froze.

He had never mentioned taking her to school. In fact, he hadn't stepped foot on campus all semester—he'd taken an extended leave.

The air thickened with unspoken tension as Claire's words hung between them, sharp as a blade.

Claire's fingers curled around Julian's arm, her touch feather-light yet possessive. The pressure of her grip bordered on painful, though she appeared completely at ease.

Julian noticed. His lips pressed together, the tips of his ears flushing pink as he gave a small nod.

"Behind the playground," he murmured, voice low and smooth, "there's an open field. In summer, people sprawl across the grass just to escape the heat."

His words wrapped around her like a spell. Claire found herself captivated, drawn in by the warmth in his gaze as he spoke, his attention never wavering from her face.

"We could camp there, actually." A faint smile tugged at his lips. "The university is famous for its night skies—so many stars, it feels like you could reach up and pluck them from the heavens."

Romantic. That was the unspoken implication.

Countless couples had whispered promises beneath that very sky, sealing their fate among the constellations.

But Julian couldn’t bring himself to say it aloud.

Claire had only pulled him along as part of her charade, yet his suggestion sparked something real in her. A flicker of genuine interest.

"You study at the Medical College?" she asked.

Perched on the hillside, the campus was legendary for its celestial views.

Rumors swirled about an upcoming meteor shower—the Geminids, streaking across the December sky in a dazzling display.

But access was restricted. Only enrolled students could pass through those gates.

###Chapter 205 Divorce

"Claire, are you seriously going to pretend I don't exist?" Lucas's voice was strained, barely above a whisper. "I'm still your husband. I nearly died, and yet you—"

His thoughts burned with betrayal. How could she arrange a date with another man right in front of me?

Claire finally turned to face him, her expression unreadable.

"I've already settled your medical bills. I tried calling your parents, but they didn’t answer."

She glanced at Isabella, who stood stiffly by the bed. "She’s here, isn’t she? You don’t need me."

Without another word, Claire looped her arm through Julian’s and strode toward the exit.

Lucas lurched forward, desperate to stop her, but the IV needle tore from his skin. A thin trail of blood snaked down his wrist.

"Claire! Don’t leave!"

His voice cracked, raw with panic, but the door clicked shut behind her.

Claire froze, her gaze locking onto the crimson streaks marring the pristine hospital sheets.

Isabella gasped, "Lucas! You're bleeding! Stay still—let the nurse handle this!"

The scene unfolded right before Claire's eyes, drawing a bitter chuckle from her lips.

Panic surged through Lucas's veins.

But his body betrayed him. He'd barely managed to stand before his knees buckled.

Isabella lunged forward to steady him, only to wince as the motion aggravated her fractured ribs.

"Look at you two," Claire murmured, fingers curling into her palms. "One barely standing, the other barely breathing. A perfect match."

She inhaled sharply.

"Take care of yourself, Lucas. I'm done."

Without another word, she turned on her heel.

"Claire! Wait!"

His voice cracked as he called after her.

Silence.

Claire didn’t look back.

She made it out of the hospital in one breathless stride, but—

Her knees buckled without warning.

Julian's face darkened as his arm shot out to steady her. "Claire?"

She blinked rapidly, shaking her head.

Only then did she notice the crescent-shaped marks her nails had left on his forearm, angry red against his tanned skin.

A wave of shame crashed over her.

"You're hurt," she whispered. "Why didn't you tell me?"

Julian flexed his arm with a careless shrug. "Just surface scratches. Doesn't even sting."

He understood. These past hours at the hospital, Claire had been using him as her anchor.

The pain meant nothing. Real men didn't flinch at such trivial wounds.

Tears welled in Claire's eyes without permission. One escaped, tracing a hot path down her cheek.

Julian swore under his breath, patting his pockets frantically before yanking off his jacket. "Here, use this—"

"You idiot!" Her voice cracked. "Why do you always pretend? Why won't you ever admit when something hurts?"

Her fingers twisted in the fabric of his sleeve. "He's not worth this. None of it was worth your pain!"

The jacket fell forgotten between them as another sob tore from her throat. Julian stood frozen, his usual confidence shattered by her outburst.

Claire's chest heaved. "I can't—I won't let you—"

Julian caught her wrist as she reached for his injured arm. Their eyes locked, the unspoken truth hanging heavy between them.

Some wounds ran deeper than skin.

Claire sobbed uncontrollably, her shoulders shaking violently before she suddenly collapsed onto her knees, burying her face in her hands.

The late afternoon sun cast a sharp, unforgiving glow over her, illuminating her hunched figure in stark contrast to the shadows around her.

The golden light caught the edges of her dark hair, turning them into a shimmering halo, yet her expression remained shattered, her pain raw and uncontained.

Julian lifted his hand, shielding her eyes from the direct glare of the sun.

He didn’t speak. He simply waited, watching her with quiet understanding, offering nothing but his presence until her tears finally subsided.

Only then did he extend the sleeve of his pristine white coat toward her.

“Dry your eyes.”

Julian knew—better than anyone—that she must have loved Lucas Bennett with every fiber of her being.

This devastation, this complete unraveling of her composure, was because of him.

But he wouldn’t voice it.

He would pretend ignorance, as if he hadn’t pieced together the truth. Instead, he would be the steady presence she needed, the silent support she could lean on.

Once Claire had calmed, she realized Evelyn hadn’t followed her outside.

A frown creased her forehead.

“It’s been too long. Why hasn’t Evelyn come down yet?”
###Chapter 206 Accident

Isabella's wheelchair blocked Lucas's path. "Lucas, the doctor insisted you need complete rest and shouldn't experience any emotional distress. Claire is occupied with her date, so I'll be looking after you these next few days."

Lucas's gaze turned icy. "My life is none of your concern! What gives you the right to take care of me?"

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes. "Have you forgotten already? I saved your life! How can you say it's none of my concern?"

"Yes, you saved me. Are you planning to hold that over my head forever? Haven't I repaid that debt a hundred times over? Isabella, I don’t want to resort to force—just leave."

The hatred Lucas felt toward Isabella was so intense, his fingers twitched with the urge to wrap around her throat.

Claire must have misunderstood… That was why she wanted to leave him.

Isabella's tears streamed down her face, but Lucas refused to acknowledge them.

Then, Evelyn, who had been silent until now, spoke up sharply. "Isabella, was it because of you that Claire injured her leg in that stage accident? The one that ended her dancing career?"

At those words, Isabella froze, her tears halting mid-fall.

The accusation hung heavy in the air.

Isabella Rhodes recoiled as if struck. "What are you implying? That I would hurt Claire? Why would I ever—?"

Evelyn Carter didn’t blink. Her gaze was sharp enough to cut through lies.

"Because with Claire out of the way, you’d finally get what you wanted," Evelyn said coldly. "No longer just a backup dancer waiting in the wings. You’d take her spot on stage."

The logic was undeniable. Isabella had the most to gain from Claire’s accident.

"Ridiculous!" Isabella’s voice cracked.

She turned desperately to Lucas Bennett, who was watching her with growing suspicion.

"Lucas, don’t listen to her! She has no proof! This is just a twisted accusation!"

Evelyn’s lips curled. "No proof?" She pulled out her phone. "Then explain why the security footage shows you tampering with the harness wires that day."

The memory of the incident was still fresh.

Claire had been rehearsing an aerial routine, suspended high above the stage. The harness was supposed to keep her safe.

Until it didn’t.

One moment, Claire was soaring gracefully. The next, the wires snapped.

She plummeted.

Two stories. Straight down.

The sound of her body hitting the floor still echoed in Evelyn’s nightmares.

Claire had screamed.

Then silence.

Evelyn’s hands clenched into fists. "You knew exactly what you were doing."

Isabella’s face drained of color.

The truth was undeniable now.

Isabella Rhodes had been panicking at first, but the moment Evelyn Carter mentioned having surveillance footage, her nerves steadied instantly.

That was impossible.

When the "accident" had occurred, they had thoroughly checked every camera in the vicinity.

The system had conveniently malfunctioned that day—nothing had been recorded.

Because Isabella had been the one to pour scalding water onto the surveillance chip, frying it beyond repair.

That was why, in the end, the incident had been dismissed as an unfortunate accident, left unresolved with no further investigation.

Evelyn didn’t actually have the footage.

She was bluffing.

Testing Isabella.

And when she caught that split-second flicker of fear in Isabella’s eyes, Evelyn had her answer.

All these years, no one had ever suspected Isabella.

Not even Claire Dawson, the victim herself, who had believed it was just a tragic mishap.

Kind-hearted people didn’t assume malice where there might be none.

But now it was clear—Isabella hadn’t just tampered with the harness.

She had destroyed the evidence long ago.

That was why she was so calm now.

Lucas Bennett had no idea Evelyn was playing mind games.

He—

Lucas Bennett froze, his face paling at Evelyn Carter's revelation about Claire Dawson's injury being linked to Isabella Rhodes. His hands trembled slightly as he gripped the edge of the table.

"That wasn't an accident?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Where's the security footage? I need to see it now."

Isabella's nails dug into her palms. She knew Evelyn couldn't possibly have the evidence, so she forced a wounded expression. "Lucas, don't listen to her lies! She's setting me up. I would never hurt anyone!"

Lucas's jaw tightened. "She's Alexander Whitmore's wife. What possible reason would she have to frame you?"

Evelyn remained calm, pulling out her phone with deliberate slowness. Her fingers danced across the screen before she extended it toward Lucas.

"The original footage was corrupted," she said evenly. "But fortunately, I have connections at Horizon Enterprises. Their lead forensic technician happens to be an old friend."

The air grew thick with tension as Isabella's breath hitched.

###Chapter 207 Behind Bars

Evelyn turned to Isabella, her voice icy. "Every second of your attack was captured and stored on their server's cloud backup. Isabella, do you realize what intentional assault means? Get ready to face the consequences."

Lucas immediately snatched the phone to verify.

Isabella's face drained of color at Evelyn's words.

"How is this possible? A surveillance expert?"

Her mind raced—had the footage from that night automatically uploaded to the security company's database?

She bit down on her lip so hard she tasted blood, fear wrapping around her like chains.

Lucas's expression darkened with every second of the video playing on Evelyn's phone. The tendons in his hand stood out sharply, his grip tightening as if fighting to keep control.

Isabella's pulse hammered in her ears.

Sweat beaded along her hairline, her lips trembling as she watched Lucas's reaction.

The silence stretched, suffocating.

She couldn't breathe.

The weight of what she'd done pressed down on her chest like a vise.

A shiver coursed through Isabella's body as Lucas finally handed the phone back to Evelyn, his expression dark and unreadable.

"Lucas, please—just let me explain!" Isabella frantically rolled her wheelchair in front of him, clutching at his sleeve with trembling fingers.

"I can't go to prison. Please, for everything we once meant to each other—just let this go!"

Her voice cracked with desperation.

"It was just a moment of madness, that's all!"

She swallowed hard before continuing, her words rushed.

"Claire can't dance anymore, but she can still walk perfectly fine. And modeling pays better anyway—she should be thanking me! This might have been the best thing that ever happened to her!"

Lucas's gaze was glacial, his eyes devoid of any warmth as they bore into her.

"It was you." His voice was dangerously low. "All this time. How could you be so cruel? Claire never did a single thing to hurt you!"

His chest rose and fell with barely contained fury while Isabella dissolved into hysterical sobs.

"Call the police," Lucas said sharply, turning to Evelyn. "I'll testify. She just confessed—I heard every word."

Evelyn gave a cold smile, pulling a small recorder from her pocket. "No need. I have everything right here."

Isabella's breath hitched.

Her face drained of color as realization struck.

She had just sealed her own fate.

"What's happening?"

Evelyn stared at her with icy detachment. "There never was any chip specialist. No surveillance footage either. That device has been defective for ages—completely offline. No one even remembers where it ended up."

Isabella froze. "You... You set me up? This was all a trap to get me to confess?"

"Bingo."

Evelyn had assumed Isabella was sharper than this. Yet here she was, crumbling under the slightest pressure, her true nature exposed with minimal effort.

Isabella's face twisted in shock.

She turned desperately to Lucas. "Lucas, I saved your life! You owe me this much—just let me go. Please. I can't go to prison."

"Saved me?" Lucas scoffed, his voice laced with disgust. "That heroic act of yours was nothing but a staged performance—scripted and acted out by you alone. Did you really think I'd never find out?"

What Evelyn had just revealed to Lucas was the unedited recording of the incident years ago—the moment Isabella had supposedly rescued him.

Back then, Lucas had been seated in the front row of a theater when a heavy prop nearly crushed him from above.

Except now he knew—the danger had never been real.

It was all her doing.

Isabella, without hesitation, threw herself in front of him, shielding Lucas from the falling stage prop.

Her quick reflexes saved him from what could have been a fatal accident.

But Lucas saw right through her act.

Because during her performance, she had glanced upward at the rigging above his head—not once, not twice, but at least five times.

No one would keep looking in that direction unless they knew something was about to happen.

It was undeniable proof.

Isabella had known the prop was unstable. She had been waiting for the perfect moment to play the hero.

This wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment rescue.

It was a carefully orchestrated trap.

Her face drained of color as she collapsed into her wheelchair, her body limp like a marionette with its strings cut.

The realization hit her—she had been exposed.

###Chapter 208 A Gift

Tears pooled in Isabella's eyes, but Lucas turned away without hesitation.

His kindness toward her had always stemmed from gratitude—for saving his life. Now that the truth was exposed, that fragile bond shattered like glass.

The look he gave her burned with pure loathing.

If not for Isabella's deception, he and Claire would never have been torn apart.

"To think someone as vile as you exists in this world."

"Lucas... What's so wrong about loving you?"

"Love?" His lips curled in disgust. "Your version of love makes me sick."

With swift movements, Lucas pulled out his phone and dialed 911. "I'm going to watch you rot behind bars, Isabella."

"No! Please don't!" She clawed at his sleeve desperately. "I'll explain everything to Claire! I'll make her understand!"

Isabella knew the game was over. The moment her lies unraveled, any remaining connection between them vanished like smoke.

The only bargaining chip left was self-preservation.

"Don't you want Claire back?" Isabella's voice trembled with desperation. "I can help you! She won't believe you, but she'll believe me. Let me go, and I'll confess everything to her!"

Lucas's lips curled into a cold smirk. "I don't negotiate with snakes like you. Winning her back is my responsibility—my debt to Claire."

Within minutes, the police arrived. Isabella was dragged away, her pleas fading into the sterile hospital corridor.

As Evelyn turned to leave, Lucas's voice stopped her.

"Thank you."

If not for her intervention, he would have remained blind to Isabella's manipulations.

Evelyn didn't look back. "This isn't for you. It's about justice—for Claire."

"Wait." Lucas hesitated. "Don’t tell her it was Isabella who ruined her dancing career."

Evelyn finally faced him, her gaze sharp.

"Dancing was her life. She thinks it was an accident. If she learns the truth, that hatred will consume her." His voice cracked. "I won’t let her live like that."

The silence between them was heavy.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Fine. But this mercy isn’t for you."

She walked away, leaving Lucas alone with his regrets.

The hospital corridor felt unnaturally quiet as Evelyn descended the stairs, her thoughts still tangled from the conversation upstairs.

Claire and Julian were waiting for her near the entrance, their expressions shifting from concern to relief when they spotted her.

"What took you so long?" Claire asked, stepping forward.

A police car rolled past them just then, its red and blue lights casting fleeting shadows across the pavement.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on the vehicle long after it disappeared around the corner. She knew Isabella was inside.

"I had some things to settle," Evelyn murmured, forcing her attention back to them.

Upstairs, Lucas had pleaded with her—begged her, really—not to tell Claire the full truth about her injuries.

Evelyn understood his fear. If Claire learned that Lucas bore partial responsibility for what happened, their already fragile relationship might shatter completely.

But Evelyn had refused to comply.

After a tense silence, Lucas had finally relented—on one condition.

If Claire must know, then I’ll be the one to tell her.

This is between us.

In the end, Evelyn had agreed.

Now, standing under the pale glow of the hospital lights, she wondered if she’d made the right choice.

Claire deserved the truth.

But would it destroy her?

She set a firm deadline—he had to confess to Claire within a week of Lucas's hospital discharge. Lucas agreed without hesitation.

Just as the conversation ended, Evelyn's phone buzzed. It was Natalie. "Someone sent a massive gift to the office. You need to see this."

Evelyn blinked. "For me?"

"Obviously!"

Glancing at her watch, Evelyn realized she'd be late if she didn't hurry. She hailed a cab and sped toward Titan Capital Group.

The moment she stepped into the CEO's office, her breath caught. An extravagant bouquet of white lilies dominated her desk, their fragrance filling the air. Natalie had already signed for it.

###Chapter 209 Disgusting

Evelyn Carter's brows knitted together in irritation. "What is this? Who sent these?"

Natalie Brooks giggled. "Must be another admirer of yours. Do you know how much these must have cost? A courier dropped them off."

The bouquet was enormous—so large that it took both arms to hold it properly. When the delivery man had arrived at Titan Capital Group’s executive floor, whispers had spread instantly.

Even the company’s private chat groups were buzzing with speculation.

Evelyn snatched the small card tucked between the stems.

Her expression darkened the moment she read it.

Without a word, she shredded the card into tiny pieces.

Then, she marched straight to the stairwell, lifted the heavy bouquet, and dumped the lilies unceremoniously into the trash bin.

Just as she turned away, her phone vibrated.

"Evelyn, did you get the lilies I sent?" Richard Hayes' voice was sickeningly cheerful. "Your mother mentioned they were your favorite, so I handpicked the most extravagant arrangement I could find. I even supervised the wrapping myself."

Evelyn stood in the stairwell, the cold wind whipping through her hair like invisible fingers.

Her lips curled into a sneer.

How could Richard think of something so ridiculous? she thought bitterly. What kind of father sends flowers to his estranged daughter like some desperate suitor?

The call had come from Richard’s office line. Evelyn’s voice was icy. "Mr. Hayes, what exactly are you trying to pull?"

Richard’s tone dripped with false warmth. "Sweetheart, I just wanted to make you happy."

He maintained his sickeningly sweet act, undeterred by her sharp words. "Do you like them?"

"Save it," Evelyn snapped. "I hate lilies. And your little performance is pathetic. I’ve already cut ties with the Hayes family. Stop trying to disgust me with this nonsense."

She hung up before he could respond.

On the other end, Richard’s face darkened. He slammed the phone down with enough force to make Margaret flinch.

"Well?" Margaret asked, her voice tight. "What did she say?"

Richard’s jaw clenched. "What do you think? She had the nerve to talk back to me—"

"Disgusting? She actually hung up on me!"

Richard Hayes' chest rose and fell rapidly, his face flushed with anger.

"I'm a powerful man—people grovel at my feet just to get my attention. But her? A nobody junior dares to call me disgusting? For sending her flowers? What the hell is wrong with her?"

Humiliation burned through him. He paced the length of his office like a caged animal, his polished shoes clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"Does she think she’s untouchable just because Alexander Whitmore is backing her? Who does she think she is?"

The memory of Alexander’s chilling words at the Hawthorne Estate dinner still haunted him. Richard had barely slept that night, his mind racing with the terrifying possibility that Alexander might actually move against Horizon Enterprises.

With Alexander’s influence, a single command could bring an empire crashing down. And there would be no shortage of people eager to carry out his orders.

Richard had tried to convince himself he was overreacting—until this morning.

The moment the stock market opened, Horizon Enterprises’ shares plummeted straight to the lower limit. No warning. No explanation.

His gut told him Alexander was behind it.

But despite sending his best investigators to dig into the matter, they found nothing. No trace. No proof.

Just silence.

And that silence was far more terrifying than any direct threat.

To ensure he didn’t make a mistake, Richard sought Margaret’s advice. The suggestion to send flowers had come from her.

It was Margaret who had proposed the floral arrangement.

Margaret revealed that Evelyn had adored gardening as a child, with lilies being her absolute favorite.

The year Evelyn returned to the Hawthorne Estate, her room had a private balcony where she cultivated an entire garden. Every afternoon after school, she would spend hours nurturing them as if they were priceless jewels.

But one evening, Vanessa suddenly broke out in a violent rash, her skin covered in angry red welts. She began babbling incoherently, her breathing labored.

Margaret was horrified when she discovered Vanessa had a severe pollen allergy.

Terrified, Margaret demanded Evelyn remove every single flower from her balcony.

Evelyn’s response was ice-cold. "As long as Vanessa stays out of my room, she won’t have a problem."

###Chapter 210 The Garden

Vanessa swore she had never stepped foot in Evelyn's room.

The two sisters stood their ground, their disagreement creating an unspoken tension in the house. Worried for Vanessa's safety, Margaret took action the next morning while Evelyn was at school—she tore out every single flower Evelyn had painstakingly nurtured, roots and all, and discarded them along with the soil.

She expected Evelyn to throw a fit when she returned.

To soften the blow, Margaret visited a high-end music store and splurged fifty thousand dollars on a cello, intending it as a peace offering for Evelyn's upcoming birthday.

But when Evelyn came home to find her beloved garden destroyed, she didn’t scream. She didn’t cry.

She simply withdrew into silence—a silence that stretched for two weeks, during which she refused to speak a single word to any of them.

Margaret still remembered it vividly. The guilt had gnawed at her then, and even now, the memory weighed on her.

Evelyn had been despondent when she first returned home, perhaps because Margaret had thrown out her acupuncture bag on the very first night.

But what choice did she have? Evelyn had caused a death! As her mother, how could Margaret stand by and let her continue down such a dangerous path?

Margaret watched Evelyn perform acupuncture on the asthmatic boy in the backseat of the car.

Her chest swelled with pride as she witnessed her daughter saving a life. Despite Evelyn's unconventional upbringing—raised by a village woman after years of wandering—she had at least mastered something useful.

But that night, the boy’s family called in panic. His condition had worsened drastically.

Fear gripped Margaret’s heart. Without hesitation, she disposed of the acupuncture kit—the first time she had ever thrown away Evelyn’s belongings.

Now, removing those flowers from the terrace marked the second time.

She had no choice. Those lilies could be lethal to Vanessa.

“What about the bouquet?” Margaret demanded. “What did she do with it?”

Richard sighed, rubbing his temples in frustration. “What do you think? She tossed it in the trash. That girl has always been too emotional.”

He shot her a sharp look. “Stop obsessing over flowers. We have bigger problems. If our shares keep plummeting, how are we going to face the board?”

Margaret clenched her fists.

The lilies were gone, but the consequences were just beginning.

Margaret traced the smooth beads encircling her wrist. Unlike Richard, who had tossed and turned all night, she'd slept like a baby.

Perhaps the bracelet's magic had finally cured her chronic insomnia.

She shrugged it off. "Horizon Enterprises is a corporate giant. What's a temporary stock dip? Though I wonder... have we truly been fair to Evelyn all these years?"

Richard blinked at his wife's unexpected introspection.

"Evelyn lacks Vanessa's obedience, let alone her accomplishments," he countered. "Vanessa was raised under our direct guidance - flawless in every way. Evelyn? She never learned to please us properly."

Comparisons between siblings were inevitable. Naturally, parents favored the child who danced to their tune.

But Margaret's thoughts took a different turn. "Blood runs thicker than water. No matter what, Evelyn remains our flesh and blood. Vanessa can never replace that."

Vanessa had boasted about gifting her a diamond bracelet, yet Margaret knew the truth - no present existed.

The realization stung.

After years of doting on Vanessa, this betrayal cut deep. The golden child's facade was cracking, revealing hollow promises beneath.

Margaret's fingers tightened around the beads. For the first time, she questioned everything.

The garden outside bloomed violently, petals scattering like confetti at a funeral nobody had planned to attend.

The date had slipped his mind again.

Richard's voice cut through the tense silence. "But let's not overlook the fact that Evelyn was raised by Sophia. Sophia is a woman of simple origins, and Evelyn's character was tainted by her influence. She's been back with us for years, yet she hasn't improved. Or have you already forgotten what happened three years ago?"

The mention of that incident made Margaret Hayes stiffen, her lips pressing into a thin line.

###Chapter 211 Three Years Ago

Yes… Margaret had agreed to Richard’s proposal three years ago—to send Evelyn to prison for rehabilitation after her unforgivable actions.

Even now, recalling that moment sent a chill down Margaret’s spine.

What if Alexander ever found out?

Would he look at Evelyn with the same disgust she had felt back then?

Outside the office, Vanessa stood frozen, her fingers curling into tight fists.

Her nails dug into her palms, leaving crescent-shaped marks that turned ghostly white.

After everything Vanessa had sacrificed for the Hayes family, how could Margaret still treat her like an outsider? Blood meant nothing when loyalty had been proven time and again.

"Ms. Vanessa Hart, are you waiting to go in?" The secretary’s voice cut through the silence, sharp and curious.

The sudden interruption startled those inside. The door swung open, revealing Richard’s surprised expression. "Vanessa? How long have you been standing there?"

"I just came to get your signature on this document." Vanessa stepped forward, her smile flawless, her voice steady.

But beneath the surface, resentment simmered.

Three years ago, Evelyn had been sent away.

And yet, she was still the one who haunted this family.

"Mom, there you are."

Margaret gave a slight nod.

Vanessa quickly spoke up. "I didn't realize you were here. The diamond bracelet is still on my desk—I’ll bring it to you later."

"No need," Margaret replied gently. "Keep it for yourself. You’ve just married Ethan, so you should wear more beautiful jewelry."

Vanessa tilted her head, her voice softening into a playful tone. "But I bought it especially for you."

"You’re my daughter. There’s no need for formalities between us."

Margaret refused to accept it. Her birthday had already passed, making the gift feel unnecessary.

Vanessa was taken aback. A strange tension had formed between them over something as simple as a bracelet.

To Margaret, nothing had changed—she still saw Vanessa the same way. But Vanessa couldn’t shake the inexplicable awkwardness settling between them.

Richard finished reviewing the document and set it down. "Vanessa, the paperwork is fine. But regarding the project with Titan Capital Group from before…"

"They rejected it outright this morning," Vanessa admitted. "They said they won’t be working with us."

Richard's expression darkened instantly. "What do you mean? There are only three competing firms, and Horizon Enterprises ranks second in overall strength! We should absolutely be on their shortlist! Why would Titan Capital Group refuse to work with us?"

Vanessa blinked innocently. "Father, I don’t understand either. Do you think Uncle Alexander removed us because Evelyn said something to him?"

Richard clenched his fists, his voice dripping with frustration. "That ungrateful brat!"

Margaret scoffed. "Have you forgotten Alexander’s warning? How we treat Evelyn directly affects his opinion of Horizon Enterprises. This isn’t just about Evelyn—it’s about Alexander’s influence."

"So what do we do now?"

Margaret’s lips curled into a calculated smile. "If Evelyn is upset, then we need to make amends."

Both Richard and Margaret turned their expectant gazes toward Vanessa.

Richard cleared his throat. "Vanessa, what if you transferred the deed of Hawthorne Estate to Evelyn?"

Vanessa stiffened. That estate had been a gift from Richard—her prized possession.

But refusing her father’s request would only earn his displeasure.

Her fingers tightened around her glass as she forced a smile. "Of course, Father. If that’s what it takes."

Inside, resentment simmered.

Evelyn would pay for this.

Vanessa had a problem with her now, so she couldn’t afford to lose Richard’s favor.

"Dad, as long as Evelyn is happy and stops targeting our company, I don’t mind sacrificing some of my personal interests."

Richard remained silent. After Margaret left, he turned to Vanessa with a troubled expression.

"Vanessa, I’m sorry about this. I’ll compensate you with additional shares."

Vanessa gave a gentle shake of her head. "Dad, money isn’t that important to me. I’m married to Ethan now, so my future is secure. You don’t need to worry about me."

"Vanessa, you’re always so understanding…"

A practiced smile curved Vanessa’s lips.

She glanced toward the door, making sure Margaret wouldn’t return before lowering her voice. "Dad, the woman from Peace Street contacted me. She wants to see you."

Richard froze, guilt flickering across his face.

###Chapter 212 The Estate

"Margaret has been keeping a close eye on me recently, and the company just lost a major contract. I'm swamped right now. Let's discuss it when I have time."

Vanessa nodded. "Understood. I'll relay that to her."

Richard studied Vanessa with a conflicted expression. "Vanessa, you must keep this between us."

Vanessa flashed a sweet, innocent smile. "Don't worry, Father. I know exactly what to say."

After Evelyn threw away the flowers Richard sent, he persisted—delivering fresh bouquets for three consecutive days.

Within a week, the entire office was buzzing.

The rumors spiraled out of control. Some whispered that Evelyn had caught the eye of a wealthy executive who was relentlessly pursuing her. Others speculated she was being courted by a married man looking for a mistress.

Evelyn ignored the gossip, but Richard’s relentless antics finally forced her to reach out.

The call came just as Richard was recovering from the loss of two key partnerships. Furious, he hurled his coffee cup across the office.

Nothing had been going right lately. The frustration was eating at him.

He pushed his plate away, the food untouched.

"Richard, you're not exactly young anymore. Why resort to such tasteless gestures? Shouldn't men your age have moved past sending flowers like some lovesick teenager?"

Richard knew exactly why his recent contracts had fallen through—Alexander Whitmore was tightening the noose around Horizon Enterprises.

"Evelyn, sweetheart," he pleaded, voice strained. "If you could just ask Alexander to ease up on my company, I swear I'll stop sending those flowers. Starting tomorrow."

Evelyn scoffed. "Sweetheart? We cut ties years ago. Stop harassing me, or I’ll make sure the IRS knows exactly how you’ve been dodging taxes."

Panic flashed in his voice. "Wait—listen! Vanessa and I agreed—she’ll take you to finalize the paperwork this Friday. The Hawthorne Estate can be yours by the end of the day."

"I already told you. I don’t want it." Her grip tightened on the phone. "I’m done with the Hayes family. Don’t call me again."

"Evelyn, please!" Richard rushed out the words before she could hang up. "Even if you hate me, don’t turn down the estate. I know I messed up. Just take it—Friday, it’s settled!"

Her laugh was ice. "Who said I agreed? Titan Capital’s annual gala is this Friday. The entire company is flying to Griffore. I won’t even be in Cresthaven."

She ended the call before he could protest.

Evelyn's demeanor toward Richard was icy and unyielding.

Though stung by her rejection, Richard understood her coldness stemmed from deep-seated anger.

He had hoped to sway her with material offerings—luxury, security, a grand estate. But Evelyn, pride unshaken, dismissed it all with a scoff.

Richard clenched his jaw. Who in their right mind refused wealth?

Acceptance would have signaled forgiveness. A chance to negotiate, to plead for Alexander’s mercy regarding Horizon Enterprises’ recent setbacks.

But Evelyn’s refusal left him stranded, his leverage crumbling.

No proof tied Alexander to the sudden losses, yet who else would dare strike at them now?

After the call ended, Evelyn lingered in the hallway, exhaling slowly.

Beside her, the trash bin held the freshly discarded lilies—once vibrant, now unwanted.

The janitor arrived, pausing at the sight. Such a waste, he thought, shaking his head as he lifted the bag. The flowers deserved better.

So did she.

"You've been discarding fresh bouquets for three straight days. My office looks like a florist shop exploded in here. Did you and your boyfriend have a falling out?"

The janitor fished another bundle of roses from the trash bin, shaking her head in disapproval.

Evelyn shrugged, examining her manicure. "Not a boyfriend. My biological father."

The older woman's eyebrows shot up. "Now that's odd. What kind of father sends his daughter flowers at work?"

A humorless laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "The kind who's eccentric and legally blind."

The janitor gasped. "Oh dear, does he have glaucoma?"

"Worse," Evelyn deadpanned. "Complete darkness."

"Well...bless his heart."

###Chapter 213 Dream

The janitor hesitated before speaking again. "You know, Miss Carter, flowers are expensive these days. Maybe you should—"

"I'd rather set them on fire," Evelyn interrupted, straightening her blazer. "But HR has a strict no-arson policy."

The older woman sighed, arranging the salvaged blooms in a water pitcher. "Seems like you two have quite the story."

Evelyn's phone buzzed with another notification - undoubtedly another floral delivery confirmation. "Oh, you have no idea."

She strode toward the elevator, the scent of roses clinging to her like an unwanted memory.

Evelyn pushed open the stairwell door and slipped back into the office just as the janitor descended the steps, clutching a bouquet of fresh flowers in one hand and a broom in the other.

One floor below, the janitor nearly collided with Ethan Caldwell, who stood shrouded in a haze of cigarette smoke.

He leaned heavily against the concrete wall, the floor around him littered with crushed cigarette butts. The smoke curled around his sharp features, softening the usual harshness in his expression.

The janitor hesitated, her gaze lingering on him a beat too long.

She couldn’t help but notice she’d been running into this man far too often lately.

But if memory served, this floor only housed the executive conference rooms—hardly a place for lingering.

Naturally warm and chatty, she couldn’t resist speaking up.

“Young man, whatever’s weighing on you, it’s not worth ruining your health over. You shouldn’t smoke like this.”

Ethan exhaled slowly, his voice quiet. “I know.”

His eyes flickered upward, scanning the empty stairwell where Evelyn had vanished. The light in his gaze dimmed.

The janitor followed his line of sight, then suddenly—

"You're into the girl upstairs, aren't you?"

Ethan Caldwell froze mid-breath, his fingers tightening around his cigarette. "Excuse me?"

The janitor chuckled knowingly. "Oh, don’t play dumb. I’ve seen that look before. You’ve got it bad for her."

"I just came out here to smoke," Ethan snapped, crushing the cigarette against the railing with more force than necessary.

The older woman smirked. "A handsome man like you shouldn’t be lurking in stairwells, staring at her window like some lovesick teenager. If you like her, go tell her!"

"I don’t—" His voice turned sharp, echoing through the empty corridor.

His jaw clenched, and without another word, he shoved the fire door open and stormed off, leaving it swinging violently behind him.

The janitor sighed, shaking her head as she watched him disappear.

"Such a temper," she muttered under her breath. "What’s the big deal? She’s a lovely girl. If you don’t act soon, someone else will."

She glanced up at the window where Evelyn Carter often sat by the sill, lost in thought.

"Better hurry, young man."

"You'll regret this!"

Evelyn remained oblivious to the commotion downstairs.

She had no clue that Ethan's frequent appearances near the stairwell were fueled by his suspicion that someone was stalking her.

Through office gossip, Ethan had learned about the mysterious bouquet delivered to Evelyn, and he was determined to uncover the sender's identity.

Overhearing Evelyn's phone conversation in the stairwell, he finally pieced it together—Richard was behind the flowers.

A wave of relief washed over him.

No wonder Alexander had allowed those rumors to circulate without interference.

Back in his office, Ethan massaged his temples, exhaling sharply.

The janitor's parting words echoed in his mind.

He liked Evelyn?

Ethan wasn’t sure.

But lately, sleep had become elusive.

Every night, bizarre dreams plagued him.

Ever since returning from Hawthorne Estate, he’d been waking in the dead of night, consumed by an inexplicable emptiness.

It felt like something vital had been ripped away—something he couldn’t name.

The frustration gnawed at him, worsening his insomnia.

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows when Nathan Reeves knocked and entered. "Mr. Ethan Caldwell, the annual Titan Capital Group retreat is scheduled for Cresthaven in two days. Mrs. Vanessa Hart mentioned she's never been and would love to join."

The company's lavish year-end celebration was always held in a luxury coastal resort, with the entire five-star hotel booked exclusively for employees.

With the weekend extending the trip to three days, many staff brought their families, turning it into a mini-vacation.

Ethan barely glanced up from his documents. "If she wants to go, arrange her flight."

Nathan nodded and turned to leave.

Then Ethan paused, his pen hovering over the contract. "How many rooms were reserved for the executive team?"

Nathan froze, clearly unprepared for the question. He rubbed his temple. "I... should probably check."

Ten minutes later, he returned.

"The executive floor has eight suites. You'll be in the penthouse, while the others have standard king rooms."

A flicker of something unreadable passed through Ethan's eyes before he dismissed Nathan with a wave.

The retreat was always a spectacle—one he usually tolerated. But this year, with Vanessa unexpectedly inserting herself, the dynamics would shift.

And he wasn't entirely sure how he felt about that.

###Chapter 214 Cresthaven

The evening before their trip to Cresthaven, Evelyn Carter meticulously packed her belongings at home.

This would be a multi-day business trip, so she filled her suitcase to the brim—even tossing in her favorite swimsuit, just in case.

At dawn on the day of departure, Alexander Whitmore helped her load the luggage into the car.

But something nagged at Evelyn.

She tilted her head. "Wait, you're flying to Cresthaven, right?"

Alexander nodded.

Evelyn frowned. "But I'm just a regular employee. I'm supposed to take the high-speed train with the rest of the team!"

Only executives were flying for this trip due to the sheer number of staff, while everyone else traveled by rail.

Alexander smirked. "I booked you a first-class ticket. And you'd rather squeeze into a train?"

For the past two evenings, Evelyn had been practicing the cello at home after work—determined not to embarrass the president's office during the upcoming corporate event.

She bit her lip. "But what will the others think?"

Alexander shrugged. "Let them think whatever they want."

Evelyn exhaled, shaking her head.

She wasn't used to special treatment, even now.

Still, she couldn't deny the thrill of flying first-class.

As they drove toward the airport, she glanced at her reflection in the window.

This trip would be different.

She could feel it.

They lived in a charming garden cottage, where Evelyn could play her cello without worrying about disturbing the neighbors. Yet, she still insisted on kicking Alexander out.

She crossed her arms stubbornly. "It's cruel to subject your poor ears to my practice sessions. The scales and drills are unbearable."

Alexander frowned. "Your playing is beautiful. I don’t mind listening."

Evelyn shook her head. "No, you don’t understand. I need to repeat the same exercises for hours. It’s not music—it’s torture."

Despite his protests, she was adamant. Within minutes, Alexander found himself standing outside their front door, suitcase in hand.

Now, he was stuck in a luxury hotel suite, scowling at the city skyline.

It made no sense to him. They were married. Why did she keep pushing him away?

Work had been chaotic lately, with year-end reports piling up at Titan Capital Group. Even at the office, they barely had a moment alone.

The annual gala was this weekend—a rare chance for them to escape the corporate frenzy.

But Evelyn hesitated. "If we arrive together, people will start asking questions."

Alexander smirked. "Let them."

She bit her lip. "You know we agreed to keep this quiet."

He stepped closer, his voice low. "I’m tired of pretending, Evelyn."

Her breath hitched.

The tension between them crackled like static in the air.

Alexander was being deliberately reckless. "So what if they find out? We'll just announce it to the world. Did you really think we could hide our marriage forever?"

Evelyn bit her lip, still uneasy about the situation.

"Then tell them you're here to discuss work with me!" Alexander suddenly pulled her close, his arm snaking around her waist. "Stop overthinking it. Or should I just carry you upstairs instead?"

His teasing words sent an immediate flush across Evelyn's cheeks.

Simon, standing nearby, pretended not to notice and turned away pointedly.

But Evelyn caught his reaction anyway, mortified. Without another word, she quickly slipped into the car.

Only then did Alexander smirk, satisfied.

The car door closed automatically, and Simon took his place in the driver's seat.

His expression remained stoic, his gaze fixed ahead as he started the engine, driving toward the airport like an emotionless chauffeur.

An hour later, they arrived.

Alexander motioned for Evelyn to check in her cello, but she clutched it tighter, refusing to let go.

Alexander's lips curved in amusement. "What's the matter?"

Evelyn's expression turned solemn. "It's too precious. What if something happens to it during the flight? I can't just check it in—I need to keep it with me!"

Alexander exhaled, running a hand through his hair. "You seriously want to carry a full-sized cello onto the plane?"

She nodded without hesitation.

The instrument was worth twenty million dollars—a masterpiece, a treasure. The thought of it being tossed into the cargo hold made her stomach twist.

Alexander fell silent for a moment before turning to Simon. He murmured something under his breath.

Simon blinked, his face a mix of disbelief and resignation. Then, with a slow nod, he strode toward the check-in counter.

Evelyn frowned. "What did you just say to him?"

The look Simon had given her was loaded—like he had a thousand thoughts trapped behind his clenched jaw. It lingered in her mind, unsettling.

Alexander arched a brow, though his tone remained deadpan. "Told him to book another seat. Once we board, he’ll sit with the cello and keep an eye on it for you."

Evelyn opened her mouth, then closed it.

Speechless.

###Chapter 215 Melody

Ethan and Vanessa sat directly behind them.

The moment Alexander and Evelyn approached, Ethan and Vanessa froze in shock.

Ever since Vanessa married into the Caldwell family, the Whitmores had treated her with cold indifference. Eleanor, Ethan’s mother, made no effort to hide her disdain.

As the patriarch of the Whitmore family, Alexander commanded respect. Vanessa immediately tugged at Ethan’s sleeve, urging him to stand. "Uncle Alexander," she greeted with forced politeness, then nodded at Evelyn. "Evelyn."

Alexander acknowledged them with nothing more than a curt hum before taking his seat in the front row.

First class had six seats. Four were now occupied.

The remaining two belonged to Simon Graves—and the cello.

Later passengers boarding the plane did double-takes at the sight of a musical instrument occupying a premium seat. Their judgmental stares burned into Simon’s back as if he were some kind of eccentric fool.

Even after they moved past, their hushed whispers carried.

"That man looks well-dressed, but what kind of idiot buys a ticket for a cello?"

"Must be one of those spoiled rich types with more money than sense."

Simon ignored them, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn suppressed a smirk. Only Alexander would arrange something so deliberately outrageous.

The cello wasn’t just an instrument.

It was a statement.

Simon was rendered speechless.

The cello Simon carried was impossible to miss, leaving Vanessa utterly stunned. "That instrument..."

"Alexander gifted it to me," Evelyn replied smoothly.

Vanessa's eyes widened in shock. "Evelyn, you're traveling for business—and you're bringing a cello along?"

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Yes. I'll be performing at the annual gala."

Vanessa's breath hitched, her voice rising in alarm. "You're playing at the gala?"

Evelyn turned, her gaze steady. "That's right. Is there an issue?"

Vanessa's pulse spiked, panic clawing at her chest.

Evelyn was going to perform at the gala—which meant Ethan would hear her play.

No.

This was disastrous.

What if Ethan recognized Evelyn's playing?

What if he realized the truth?

Her carefully constructed lies would crumble.

And then—she'd lose everything.

Vanessa's fingers curled into tight fists as her gaze flickered toward the cello case resting behind her.

The instrument was securely zipped in its black leather bag, yet Simon's piercing stare seemed to burn through the fabric.

No. She couldn’t let Evelyn play.

If she did, everything would unravel.

If Ethan ever discovered he had mistaken her identity from the start—

Vanessa’s stomach twisted at the thought.

Ethan’s mind was elsewhere.

That haunting melody he’d heard on his colleague’s phone… had Evelyn been the one playing it?

How?

The composition was obscure, something Vanessa had claimed as her own. It was this very piece that had pulled him from the brink of death after the accident.

But Evelyn shouldn’t know it.

She hadn’t touched a cello in years.

Unless…

Had she overheard Vanessa practicing and memorized it?

Or was there something else?

A darker possibility slithered into Vanessa’s thoughts.

What if Evelyn remembered more than she let on?

The air thickened with tension.

Simon’s voice cut through the silence. "Miss Carter, would you play for us?"

Evelyn hesitated, her fingers hovering over the case.

Vanessa’s pulse spiked.

She had to act—now.

Before the truth shattered everything.

No, that couldn't be right.

Evelyn had always been more skilled at the cello than Vanessa.

Despite the static in the phone recording, her emotional interpretation surpassed Vanessa's by miles.

And it matched exactly the haunting melody he'd heard during his coma.

Ethan Caldwell's fingers tightened around his phone until the edges bit into his palm.

That cello piece had been the reason he first noticed Vanessa.

The truth was, his heart had always belonged to Evelyn. But everything changed after that car crash when he was eighteen.

When he woke up, he'd asked Evelyn why she suddenly quit playing.

She'd shrugged and called it "a childish phase."

He'd begged to hear her play just once more, but Evelyn never touched the cello again in his presence.

Ethan assumed she'd simply lost interest. He never pushed.

Vanessa, however, never refused when he asked. She played on demand, always eager to please.

Unlike Evelyn, who made no excuses - she just quietly walked away.

Their musical connection drew Ethan closer to Vanessa.

Vanessa mastered both the cello and piano with equal brilliance.

For the school's centennial gala, Ethan and Vanessa had planned a piano duet.

But fate intervened—Vanessa's hand injury forced her to withdraw.

That night, Ethan's fury toward Evelyn erupted like a storm.

He never imagined Evelyn's jealousy could wound Vanessa, and for the first time, he saw her as cruel.

Ethan remained lost in thought long after the plane landed.

Vanessa's repeated calls failed to break his trance.

"Ethan!" Vanessa's voice sharpened with irritation. "What's wrong with you? We need to disembark."

Her gaze flicked to the empty seats ahead—Alexander and Evelyn had already left.

Ethan remained motionless, his eyes locking onto hers. "Vanessa," he said slowly, "are you keeping secrets from me?"

The cabin's hum filled the silence between them.

Vanessa's fingers tightened around her designer handbag. "That's ridiculous," she scoffed, but her knuckles turned white.

Ethan noticed. He always noticed.

Outside the window, airport lights blurred as memories of Evelyn's tear-streaked face surfaced unbidden.

Vanessa stood abruptly, her perfume—too sweet, too strong—overwhelming the recycled air. "Enough games, Ethan. Let's go."

But Ethan remained seated, the truth dawning like sunrise over Cresthaven's skyline.

Some melodies, once played, could never be unheard.

Vanessa gasped, her pulse quickening with sudden dread. "What are you implying?"

Ethan's piercing gaze locked onto hers. "If you're keeping secrets from me, this is your last chance to confess. I despise liars."

Her lips stretched into a strained smile as realization struck—he might already know!

But Evelyn hadn't touched her cello in Ethan's presence since that night. There was no way he could have discovered the truth.

Vanessa exhaled in quiet relief.

One thing was certain—she must prevent Evelyn from performing at the annual gala at all costs.

Alexander Whitmore would never slip through her fingers again.

The tension thickened as Ethan stepped closer, his tailored suit brushing against Vanessa's trembling arm. "You look pale," he remarked coldly. "Guilty conscience?"

She clutched her champagne flute tighter, the crystal threatening to shatter in her grip. Around them, Horizon Enterprises' elite mingled beneath crystal chandeliers, oblivious to the silent storm between them.

Across the ballroom, Evelyn laughed at something Alexander whispered in her ear, the diamond pendant at her throat catching the light—a wedding gift Vanessa had coveted for years.

"Don't be absurd," Vanessa forced a laugh, but her manicured nails bit into her palm. "Just a headache from the orchestra's tuning."

Ethan's smirk didn't reach his eyes. "Funny you should mention music. I've been thinking about commissioning a cello piece for Mother's birthday. Who better than my future sister-in-law?"

Vanessa's blood ran cold. The annual gala was in three days—Ethan's sudden interest couldn't be coincidence.

As if sensing her panic, Evelyn glanced their way. Their eyes met, and for a heartbeat, Vanessa saw the ghost of their childhood—two girls practicing scales together before the lies began.

Then Alexander curved a protective arm around Evelyn's waist, and the moment shattered.

Vanessa turned back to Ethan with renewed determination. She'd burn every cello in Cresthaven before letting that memory resurface.
###Chapter 216 Whispering Her Name

The Horizon Enterprises annual gala was scheduled for tomorrow night, granting everyone a free day to unwind today.

The ocean air carried its distinctive salty tang, invigorating Evelyn the moment she stepped onto the resort grounds. Without wasting time, she changed out of her travel attire into a flowing sundress the instant she checked into her suite.

The rest of the team was arriving via the afternoon express train, leaving the beach blissfully uncrowded for now. Evelyn seized the opportunity to explore the shoreline in peaceful solitude.

But as she reached for the door handle, it swung open to reveal Alexander standing there.

Gone was his usual sharp business attire. Instead, he wore a simple white tee that clung to his frame, radiating effortless charm. His hand was raised mid-knock when their eyes met.

Evelyn's gaze darted down the hallway instinctively, relieved to find it empty.

She grabbed his wrist to pull him inside, but he resisted.

A frown creased his brow as he murmured, "Are we husband and wife or secret lovers sneaking around?"

The low timbre of his voice sent an unexpected shiver down her spine.

Evelyn released his wrist with a huff. "You know why we have to be careful," she countered, crossing her arms.

Alexander stepped closer, the warmth of his body radiating against her. "I'm tired of pretending," he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Especially when no one's watching."

Before she could protest, his fingers brushed against hers, sending sparks through her veins.

The distant sound of laughter from the beach snapped her back to reality. She stepped back, putting space between them.

"Later," she promised, her voice barely audible.

Alexander's lips curved into that infuriatingly knowing smile. "I'll hold you to that, Mrs. Whitmore."

With that, he turned and strolled down the hallway, leaving Evelyn clutching the doorframe, her heart racing.

The ocean breeze suddenly felt much warmer than before.

To maintain professional appearances, they'd reserved separate suites for this business trip—a decision Alexander had protested with relentless complaints.

Noticing his frustration, Evelyn quickly clarified, "I just thought it'd be better if our coworkers didn't know we're married yet. It could create unnecessary complications at Titan Capital..."

Alexander drew her near, intertwining their fingers with possessive warmth. "How long do you intend to keep us hidden, darling?"

His thumb brushed her temple affectionately. "Everyone at Cresthaven already knows Alexander Whitmore married Evelyn Carter. The truth will surface eventually."

He wasn't wrong.

Evelyn hesitated only momentarily before conceding with a soft exhale. "Fine. We'll let it unfold organically."

A victorious smirk played on Alexander's lips as he pulled her flush against him. "So tell me, sweetheart—shall I visit your suite tonight, or will you grace mine?"

The heat behind his words sent tremors through Evelyn's fingers, painting her cheeks rose-gold.

The crisp aroma of his shower gel clung to him—cool peppermint with underlying warmth.

Evelyn inhaled deeply, committing the scent to memory.

"I'll... come to your room," Evelyn murmured, her voice barely audible.

Alexander's grin deepened, making her feel like a doe wandering into a hunter's trap.

His gaze never wavered. "When?"

"Ten?"

"Fine. If you're late, I'm coming to get you."

Evelyn's face burned crimson, the heat creeping all the way to the edges of her ears.

When the elevator doors slid open in the lobby, Alexander pulled her close, guiding her toward the beach.

As they passed a floor-to-ceiling window, Ethan Caldwell froze, his fork hovering mid-air.

His eyes tracked them until they disappeared from view.

Beside him, Vanessa Hart noticed his distraction, her fingers tightening around her wineglass.

She tugged at his sleeve. "Ethan, look—Alexander and Evelyn seem... close. Maybe we should take a walk later too?"

Ethan's jaw clenched.

He shoved the last bite of pasta into his mouth and slammed his fork down.

The golden afternoon light filtered through the curtains, but Ethan Caldwell felt none of its warmth.

Work had been relentless, and sleepless nights had left him drained.

"I need to lie down," he murmured, rubbing his tired eyes.

Vanessa Hart followed him into their bedroom, her fingers curling into the fabric of his shirt as she pressed herself against his back.

"Ethan…"

Her voice was soft, pleading.

He knew what she wanted. But exhaustion weighed too heavily on him tonight.

Gently, he untangled her arms and turned to face her. "Not now, Vanessa. I just need to sleep."

Her lips trembled. "Do you even want me anymore?"

His brow furrowed. "What are you talking about?"

Tears welled in her eyes. "The other night—you said her name. You called out for Evelyn in your sleep."

The accusation hung between them, sharp as a blade.

Ethan froze.

He hadn’t realized.

Hadn’t meant to.

But the truth was undeniable.

Somewhere in the dark, between dreams and waking, Evelyn Carter’s name had slipped past his lips.

And Vanessa had heard it.

###Chapter 217 Exposed in the Act

The moment Vanessa spoke those words, humiliation burned through her like wildfire. This was beyond embarrassment—it was soul-crushing.

She had waited an entire month after their wedding for Ethan to finally touch her, only for him to whisper another woman’s name in the heat of passion.

Ethan’s jaw clenched, a visible vein pulsing at his temple as if ready to snap.

Without a single word, he shrugged off his suit jacket, snatched his sleepwear, and stalked into the bathroom.

The shower lasted barely five minutes.

Vanessa had hoped—no, expected—some kind of explanation when he emerged. Instead, he just yanked the covers back, cranked up the AC, and dropped onto the mattress, eyes shut.

Her breath hitched. Was he seriously dismissing her like this?

"Ethan, wake up. We’re not done talking!"

Tears welled, hot and furious. Normally, he’d pull her close, murmur apologies. Tonight? He didn’t even open his eyes, just draped an arm over his forehead like she was background noise.

"Later. I need sleep."

His voice was rough, final.

Vanessa’s nails dug into her palms. Later? Later?

Oh, no. This wasn’t ending here.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms as hot tears spilled down her cheeks.

When it became clear he wouldn't speak, she whirled around and marched to the elevators, slamming the button for the lobby.

The marble-floored reception area was nearly empty when she approached the desk, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

"Hi," she forced out between clenched teeth. "I'm in suite 808 and locked myself out. I need someone to let me in."

The clerk's gaze turned assessing. "Name on the reservation?"

"Evelyn Carter."

Keys clattered as the receptionist typed. After a tense moment, she nodded.

"We'll need photo identification before granting access."

Vanessa's pulse jumped. "It's inside. I'll show you once—"

The clerk was already reaching for the phone.

Vanessa expected a manager. Instead, within minutes, Simon Graves appeared like a specter from the staff hallway.

"That's her," the clerk indicated.

Vanessa turned—and froze.

Simon's expression darkened as recognition flashed across his face.

Vanessa plastered on a fake smile. "Oh, it's you."

Simon studied her with narrowed eyes before his lips curled into a mocking smirk.

"Ms. Vanessa Hart, care to explain why you're sneaking into Mrs. Evelyn Carter's room?"

Vanessa quickly composed herself, flipping her hair over her shoulder. "Don't be ridiculous. Evelyn is my sister. I just wanted to leave her a little present."

"But didn't Mrs. Carter publicly sever ties with the Hart family?" Simon countered, his voice laced with amusement.

Heat rushed to Vanessa's cheeks.

How dare this lowly assistant embarrass her like this?

Before she could retort, Simon pulled out his phone and dialed Evelyn right in front of her.

"Mrs. Carter, Vanessa is here at the front desk attempting to access your room. She claims she has a surprise for you."

After a brief pause, Simon nodded and ended the call.

He turned back to Vanessa with a cold smile. "Mrs. Carter asked me to relay a message."

Vanessa clenched her fists. "And what would that be?"

Simon's grin widened.

"Get the hell out."

The evening air was crisp as Evelyn enjoyed a hotpot dinner with her colleagues from the executive floor.

Laughter and chatter filled the private dining room, but her mind kept drifting elsewhere.

By the time she returned to her suite, the clock was ticking dangerously close to the hour Alexander had set.

She rushed through her shower, the warm water doing little to ease the nervous flutter in her chest.

Stepping out, she glanced at the clock—9:55 PM.

Alexander’s warning echoed in her mind: "Be in my suite by ten, or I’ll come get you."

That wasn’t an option.

With Titan Capital’s executives scattered across the same floor—some even playing cards with their doors wide open—she couldn’t risk a scene.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she slipped into a fresh dress, one that hugged her curves just enough to be noticed.

Taking a steadying breath, she stepped into the hallway, timing her steps precisely.

The elevator ride up felt endless, each second stretching like taffy.

When she reached his door, she hesitated, her knuckles hovering just above the wood.

Then, before she could second-guess herself, she knocked.

The door swung open in three seconds flat.

Alexander stood there, his dark eyes gleaming with something dangerous.

###Chapter 218 Seaside Sunrise

Alexander had just stepped out of the shower, water droplets still glistening on his skin.

A single white towel hung low on his hips, revealing the hard planes of his sculpted abdomen.

Evelyn froze in the doorway, her breath catching in her throat.

Her gaze involuntarily trailed down before she snapped her eyes shut, pressing a hand over them.

But temptation was too strong. She peeked through her fingers, heat rising to her cheeks.

Every inch of him was carved to perfection—broad shoulders, defined chest, the kind of body that made her pulse quicken.

Noticing her stolen glances, Alexander leaned lazily against the doorframe, water still dripping from his hair.

A slow, knowing smirk curved his lips, his voice a low, teasing rumble.

"Don’t just stand there. Come closer."

Before she could protest, his fingers wrapped around her wrist, pulling her inside.

In one fluid motion, he spun her around, pressing her flush against him as the door clicked shut behind them.

The presidential suite stretched before them, its grandeur making the standard rooms seem like closets in comparison.

In the gilded entryway mirror, their reflection burned with passion—Alexander's strong arms wrapped possessively around Evelyn as his mouth claimed hers in a searing kiss.

His fingers tangled in her silken hair, twisting a dark strand around his index finger while his other hand tilted her chin up, demanding more.

God, he was intoxicating. Every touch set her nerves on fire.

Evelyn's skin burned beneath his fingertips. When she tried to turn away, his lips only trailed lower, brushing featherlight kisses along her collarbone.

Her knees buckled. If not for his iron grip, she would have melted to the floor.

"Did you have fondue with them tonight?" His voice was rough against her skin.

"Yes."

Earlier, in the executive group chat, Natalie had suggested the team dinner.

Nearly everyone had agreed—except Alexander and Simon.

With an international conference overlapping, Alexander had ended up with a takeout box Simon delivered.

Now Evelyn understood why rumors swirled about Alexander and Simon being more than just business partners...

The salty ocean breeze drifted through the open balcony doors as Evelyn stretched lazily in bed.

"I was really craving fondue tonight," she murmured, tracing idle patterns on Alexander's chest.

His lips curved into that knowing smirk she adored. "After tomorrow's annual meeting, I'll take you to that new steakhouse by the pier."

Alexander suddenly rolled over, burying his face in the crook of her neck. His lips trailed featherlight kisses along her sensitive skin, each touch sending electric sparks down her spine.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

She could feel the heat rising to her cheeks as her body instinctively arched toward him. The way his mouth explored her neck with such deliberate tenderness made her pulse race wildly.

Noticing her reaction, Alexander chuckled darkly against her skin.

"If just this makes you tremble," he whispered, his voice dripping with sinful promise, "how will you handle what comes next?"

Evelyn's entire face burned crimson at his implication.

"Alexander—"

"Hmm?"

"You're impossible," she breathed, her fingers tangling in his hair.

His answering laugh was rich and warm before he effortlessly scooped her into his arms. In three strides, they reached the king-sized bed where he laid her down with reverent care, his golden eyes burning with undisguised desire.

The first light of dawn painted the room in hues of coral and gold as waves crashed rhythmically against the shore below.

The world narrowed to just the two of them as Alexander took his time, his lips tracing slow, deliberate paths over Evelyn’s skin. She clutched the silk sheets beneath her, her body arching into his touch, every nerve alight with sensation.

Her breath hitched, lashes fluttering as unshed tears glistened in the dim light. The flush of pleasure painted her cheeks, her lips parted in silent surrender.

Before she could form a coherent thought, Alexander captured her mouth again, swallowing her gasp as his hands mapped the curves he knew so well.

Desire crested between them like a wave, and Evelyn’s fingers twisted into his dark hair, anchoring herself as pleasure threatened to sweep her away.

Alexander, ever the relentless strategist, spent the night reclaiming every stolen moment, every second Evelyn had been absent from his arms. He was thorough, exacting—leaving no inch of her untouched, no whisper of longing unanswered.

By the time dawn crept over the horizon, painting the sky in soft hues of gold and pink, Evelyn lay boneless against the sheets, her body humming with exhaustion.

True to his nature, Alexander had already prepared for this. The bathwater steamed invitingly, the scent of lavender and vanilla curling through the air. He tested the temperature with his wrist before lifting her effortlessly, cradling her against his chest as he lowered her into the warmth.

When they emerged, the floor-to-ceiling windows framed a breathtaking view—the first light of morning spilling over the ocean, turning the waves to liquid gold. Evelyn’s breath caught.

Alexander’s arms wrapped around her from behind, his lips brushing her shoulder. "Worth staying awake for?"

She leaned back into him, too spent to answer. But the way her fingers laced with his said everything.

The first light of dawn painted the horizon in molten gold, setting the ocean ablaze with shimmering reflections.

Waves lapped gently against the shore, their rhythmic whispers blending with the crisp morning air.

Evelyn stood motionless, her breath catching at the breathtaking display before her.

The sky transformed from indigo to soft pastels, clouds edged with fire as the sun climbed higher.

She had never imagined the seaside could look like this—so alive, so radiant, as if the world had been reborn in this single moment.

The salt-kissed breeze tousled her hair, carrying with it the faint scent of seaweed and distant adventures.

She wrapped her arms around herself, not from cold, but from the sheer overwhelming beauty of it all.

It felt like a secret, stolen moment—one meant only for her.

A seagull cried overhead, its wings outstretched as it rode the morning currents.

Evelyn smiled, her heart lighter than it had been in weeks.

For the first time in what felt like forever, she allowed herself to simply be.

No past regrets. No future uncertainties.

Just this—the sun, the sea, and the quiet joy of witnessing something so pure.

She closed her eyes, imprinting the scene into memory.

When she opened them again, the world seemed brighter.

More hopeful.

###Chapter 219 Holding a Meeting

Alexander’s arms encircled Evelyn from behind without warning.

His lips brushed the delicate skin of her neck, sending shivers down her spine.

Gently, he lifted her wrists and pressed her against the floor-to-ceiling windows, the city lights twinkling below them.

Before she could react, he captured her lips in a searing kiss that left her dizzy.

Evelyn’s pulse skyrocketed as their mouths moved together, his touch both possessive and tender.

Alexander kissed like a man starved—fiery, demanding, yet achingly sweet.

His breath was warm against her skin as he murmured in that deep, intoxicating voice, "Mrs. Whitmore, shall we continue with the sunrise as our audience?"

He didn’t wait for an answer.

Evelyn gasped as his hands roamed, his touch igniting trails of fire across her body.

She had never expected such relentless passion from him.

By the time dawn painted the sky in hues of gold and pink, she was breathless, her limbs heavy with exhaustion.

Alexander finally relented, letting her collapse onto the plush bed.

Utterly spent, Evelyn curled into the sheets, craving nothing but the sweet oblivion of sleep.

The exhaustion finally released its grip around 4 PM, letting her slip into a shallow sleep.

When Evelyn's eyes fluttered open, the bedroom stood eerily silent.

Bare feet touched cold marble as she rose, scanning for her clothes. Her gaze landed on the ruined fabric scattered across the floor—the remnants of last night's emerald evening gown.

A flush crept up her neck as she recalled Alexander's impatience. The memory of his fingers fumbling with the stubborn zipper before giving up and tearing the delicate material sent shivers down her spine.

The plush bathrobe draped over the armchair tempted her, but the thin silk offered little modesty.

Her suitcase yielded better options. Fingers brushed against crisp cotton—one of Alexander's tailored dress shirts.

The fabric swallowed her frame, the hem barely skimming mid-thigh. Not ideal, but it would suffice until she found proper attire.

The full-length mirror revealed more leg than she'd prefer, but the buttons secured everything essential.

Taking a steadying breath, she turned the doorknob—

—and froze.

The expansive living room buzzed with activity. A dozen sharply dressed executives sat frozen mid-conversation, their expressions ranging from shock to poorly concealed amusement.

At the center of it all, Alexander barely glanced up from his financial reports, his pen continuing its steady scratch across paper.

Evelyn's fingers instinctively clutched the shirt's hem, her cheeks burning.

This wasn't how she'd imagined facing Titan Capital's board members.

Alexander was conducting a meeting in the penthouse suite?

The luxury hotel's soundproof walls had completely muffled the voices, leaving Evelyn oblivious to the gathering.

The senior executives of Titan Capital Group stared at her, their expressions shifting from professional composure to visible shock.

Rumors about Alexander's marriage had circulated through the corporate world, but none of them expected to find a woman in his private quarters.

While workplace affairs weren't uncommon among high-powered executives, Alexander had always been the exception—a man known for his unshakable discipline and zero tolerance for scandal.

Yet here she was.

The executives exchanged glances, their curiosity burning. What was it about Evelyn Carter that had breached Alexander Whitmore's famously impenetrable walls?

Given the recent whispers about her bold pursuit of him, it was clear she had left an undeniable impression.

Most men wouldn't refuse an attractive, determined woman who made her interest known—and apparently, even Alexander wasn't immune.

In mere seconds, the executives pieced together the implications of this unexpected scene.

Silently, they pitied Alexander's enigmatic wife.

Ethan Caldwell froze mid-sentence when Evelyn Carter walked in.

His face paled visibly, shock flashing across his features.

He knew Alexander Whitmore and Evelyn had separate suites for this business trip.

Yet here she stood, wearing one of Alexander's crisp dress shirts—clear evidence they'd shared more than just a meeting last night.

Ethan's jaw clenched so tight his teeth ached.

"So she actually stayed in his room all night?" The thought burned through him like acid.

A bitter taste filled his mouth as he wondered, "What kind of spell has she cast to make someone as controlled as Alexander Whitmore lose all restraint?"

His fingers curled into fists at his sides, the documents in his hand crumpling unnoticed.

Across the room, Evelyn adjusted the oversized cufflinks—Alexander's signature silver monogram glinting in the morning light.

The silent declaration made Ethan's stomach twist.

He'd underestimated her. Again.

And now Alexander Whitmore—the man even boardroom sharks feared—had clearly fallen under her influence.

Ethan forced his breathing to steady.

But the damage was done.

Everyone in the conference room had noticed.

The whispers had already begun.
###Chapter 220 The Revelation

Alexander sat with his back to the entrance, but when Ethan's pen clattered onto the marble floor, his brow arched in silent question.

Simon, spotting Evelyn's sudden appearance, immediately bent to murmur in Alexander's ear. Only then did the CEO turn.

Their eyes locked.

The temperature in the room plummeted.

Evelyn stood frozen in the doorway, drowning in Alexander's oversized shirt, her bare legs glistening under the chandelier's glow.

A dozen executives gaped.

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Return to our suite." His voice was Arctic frost.

Evelyn's pulse stuttered.

She hadn't anticipated Titan Capital's entire board would be gathered here at midnight.

Heat scorched her cheeks as she slammed the oak door with enough force to rattle the Picasso.

Her thoughts spiraled. They all know. They all saw. God, I could die right now.

As Evelyn fled down the corridor, Alexander gave Simon a clipped nod. The unspoken command hung between them—handle this.

The penthouse elevator doors slid shut just as the first champagne flute shattered against the wall.

Simon nodded and left, closing the door with a soft click.

The living room was thick with tension. Every breath, every rustle of fabric seemed deafening in the heavy silence.

The executives shifted uncomfortably, their eyes darting to Alexander’s frosty expression.

They had walked into something private—something they weren’t meant to witness. The weight of their intrusion pressed down on them.

No one dared to speak first. No one wanted to make the situation worse.

The silence stretched until Alexander suddenly slammed the file in his hand onto the table. The sharp sound made everyone flinch.

His anger was unmistakable, sharpening the unease in the room.

The executives exchanged nervous glances. They knew this wasn’t just about business anymore.

One of them, beads of sweat forming on his forehead, swallowed hard before speaking. "Mr. Whitmore," he stammered, "we—we won’t mention what we saw. You have our discretion."

Alexander studied the man before him, his eyebrow arching in silent challenge. "Is that so? And what precisely do you think warrants this conversation?"

The executive floundered, his mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead as he wiped it nervously for the third time.

It was obvious—Alexander’s question was a trap. No one dared speculate about his relationship with Evelyn now, not when their careers hung in the balance.

Leaning back against the plush sofa, Alexander took a slow, deliberate drag from his cigarette, savoring the tension thickening the air. The discomfort radiating from the room was almost palpable.

Then, the door clicked open.

Simon stepped inside, a sleek leather tote in hand. He moved with quiet efficiency, stopping just outside the study before knocking lightly.

"Mrs. Whitmore," he announced, his voice carrying just enough to be heard clearly in the living room. "Mr. Whitmore has something for you."

The executives froze.

Eyes widened. Jaws slackened.

Mrs. Whitmore?

The realization struck like lightning—Evelyn Carter was Alexander Whitmore’s wife. The woman they had dismissed, underestimated, was the very one who held his heart.

Alexander smirked, watching their stunned expressions with dark amusement. "What’s with the looks? Did someone forget how to breathe?"

The executive who had spoken earlier snapped his mouth shut so fast his teeth clicked.

The air in the room grew thick with tension as realization dawned on the executives.

"Mr. Whitmore… is Ms. Carter truly your wife?"

Alexander exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his lips curling into a knowing smirk. "Or would you prefer she was yours?"

Just then, Evelyn stepped out of her bedroom, dressed in the outfit Simon had delivered.

Unaware of the scene unfolding, she walked into the living room only to freeze at the sight before her.

The usually composed executives stood rigid, their expressions a mix of shock and deference.

Her breath hitched.

To her astonishment, the proud, unapproachable men suddenly bowed in perfect unison.

"Mrs. Whitmore!"

"Mrs. Whitmore!"

Their voices rang out, filling the space with an unspoken acknowledgment of her status.

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

The weight of their respect settled over her, undeniable and absolute.

Alexander's gaze never left her, dark with possession and pride.

The game had just changed.

And she was at the center of it all.
###Chapter 221 Sleepless Nights

Evelyn instinctively turned to look at Alexander.

He lounged against the sofa, that infuriatingly confident smirk curving his lips.

The realization struck her like lightning.

Just last night, she had insisted they take things slow.

Yet here he was, announcing their relationship to the world without hesitation.

Why was he in such a hurry?

Across the room, Ethan's face went rigid.

His chest tightened painfully as the truth settled in.

The pen in his grip snapped with a sharp crack.

As a man, Ethan recognized Alexander's game immediately.

By making their relationship public, Alexander had effectively claimed her—openly and irrevocably.

The air thickened with tension.

Evelyn's pulse raced.

She hadn't expected this.

Not so soon.

Not like this.

Alexander's gaze never wavered from hers, daring her to challenge him.

Evelyn swallowed hard.

This wasn't just a declaration.

It was a power play.

And she was caught right in the middle.

Since their wedding, any whispers about them only served to showcase their unbreakable bond.

Ethan Caldwell felt an uncomfortable twist in his chest.

After a brief respite in her private room, Evelyn Carter picked up her cello and made her way toward the backstage area.

Titan Capital Group’s annual gala was nothing short of spectacular—complete with celebrity hosts and a live broadcast for the entire company.

In the hotel hallway, Evelyn nearly collided with Natalie Brooks.

Spotting the cello in Evelyn’s hands, Natalie gasped dramatically, pressing her hands to her cheeks. “Now that’s a statement! Oh my god, my poetry reading last year… what was I even thinking?”

She pumped her fists excitedly. “The executive office is finally going to shine! That thing looks heavy—need a hand?”

Evelyn shook her head with a soft smile. “I’ve got it.”

Natalie nodded knowingly. “Figured. That cello probably costs more than my car…”

Just as Evelyn stepped out of the elevator, heading toward the backstage entrance, she was abruptly cornered by Ethan in a dimly lit alcove.

His eyes were bloodshot, his face gaunt—as if he hadn’t slept in days.

The moment was deliberate. He had positioned himself here, waiting for her with purpose burning in his chest.

Lately, Ethan Caldwell hadn’t slept. Not truly.

His nights stretched endlessly, dawn creeping in before exhaustion finally dragged him under for an hour or two. And when he did sleep, she haunted him.

Evelyn Carter—just as she had been years ago, her heart and gaze fixed solely on him.

In his dreams, they were students again.

Back when she had first returned to the Hawthorne Estate, motion sickness made the car rides unbearable, so she walked home instead.

He had followed her. Every day.

Not out of obligation, but fear—fear that someone might hurt her, might take her away.

One afternoon, she turned. Caught him.

His pulse had hammered so hard he thought she’d hear it.

Before she could speak, he spun on his heel and fled like a thief.

Cowardice. It was the first time he’d ever felt it.

Tonight, Evelyn would perform at the annual gala.

The knowledge clawed at him.

He had never heard her play the cello. Not once.

She had studied it for years, then abruptly stopped.

But Vanessa Hart?

Vanessa had suddenly taken an interest in—

The instrument.

A haunting melody echoed in Ethan Caldwell’s mind—the same one he’d heard on a colleague’s phone that day. His gaze locked onto Evelyn Carter’s, intense and searching.

"Was it you?" he demanded.

Evelyn blinked, confusion flickering across her face.

Ethan’s grip on her wrist tightened, his voice rough with urgency. "Years ago, after the accident—when I was in a coma—I heard a cello. Was it you playing?"

She stiffened, thrown by the sudden question.

"You’re being ridiculous," she muttered, trying to pull away.

But Ethan didn’t let go. Desperation darkened his eyes. "It was you, wasn’t it? Tell me!"

Evelyn’s pulse raced. Why was he fixated on this now?

She yanked her arm free. "I don’t know what you’re talking about."

His jaw clenched. "Don’t lie to me."

She scoffed. "You’re delusional."

Ethan’s expression twisted—part frustration, part something deeper. Something raw.

Evelyn didn’t wait for another accusation. She turned on her heel and walked away, leaving him standing there, haunted by a memory he couldn’t shake.

###Chapter 222 The Truth

Years ago, Ethan Caldwell had been in a car accident while on his way to pick her up. The guilt had haunted Evelyn Carter ever since. To numb the pain, she started playing the cello outside the hospital, letting the music drown out her sorrow.

She never wanted to relive those memories with Ethan. And she definitely didn’t want to discuss them now.

Without a word, Evelyn pulled her arm free from his grasp and turned to leave.

Ethan watched her walk away, his chest tightening with regret.

He didn’t follow her. He didn’t call out.

Because deep down, he already knew.

Anyone could learn to play an instrument. But the way someone poured their soul into the music—that was unmistakable.

The moment Ethan heard that short recording on his colleague’s phone, something inside him shattered. The melody, the emotion—it was the same as the one he had heard years ago. The one that had stayed with him all this time.

The only thing stopping him from fully accepting it was the desperate hope that Vanessa Hart hadn’t lied to him.

But hope was a fragile thing. And the truth was staring him in the face.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the backstage area, the air was thick with tension and hurried whispers.

Alexander had arranged for her to have a secluded dressing room, away from the chaos.

After carefully setting her cello down on the polished table, a staff member handed her a glass of water with a polite smile.

Evelyn murmured her thanks, but as she brought the glass to her lips, an unsettling prickle ran down her spine.

There was something off—a faint, bitter undertone in the water’s scent.

Years of training under a master herbalist had sharpened her senses to detect even the subtlest traces of foreign substances.

Her stomach twisted in realization.

Croton oil—a powerful purgative that could incapacitate her within minutes.

Lowering the glass without drinking, she swiftly moved toward the door, intent on confronting the staff member who had delivered it.

But fate had other plans.

The door swung open before she could reach it, revealing Vanessa standing there, her expression unreadable.

Vanessa’s sharp eyes darted past Evelyn, landing on the untouched glass still sitting on the table.

A flicker of frustration darkened her gaze.

In that heartbeat, the pieces fell into place.

Evelyn’s voice was steady, but ice laced every word.

“It was you.”

Vanessa didn’t flinch.

Evelyn stepped closer, her tone dropping to a dangerous whisper.

“What exactly were you hoping to achieve, Vanessa?”

Vanessa's vision blurred with unshed tears.

She had been shadowing Ethan's every move, watching as he intercepted Evelyn, demanding to know if she was the mysterious cellist from years ago.

A cold dread settled in her chest. She could see the suspicion darkening Ethan's gaze.

Evelyn was moments away from taking the stage. With Ethan's sharp musical ear, he would recognize her playing instantly.

That long-lost cellist had haunted him for years. Vanessa had only secured his affection by slipping into that role, weaving lies into the spaces between truth.

Now, the fear of exposure was suffocating. She had never known terror like this.

That was why she had tried to stop Evelyn from performing—but her desperate attempt had failed.

Vanessa seized Evelyn's wrist, her voice breaking. "Evelyn, please. Just this once. Walk away."

Evelyn frowned, pulling her hand free. "What is wrong with you and Ethan? Why are you both acting like this? What exactly am I supposed to be letting go of?"

"After Ethan's accident, you promised never to play again," Vanessa whispered, desperation clawing at her throat. "So why now? Why tonight?"

"Evelyn, please, I'm begging you—don't go on stage tonight. If you agree, I'll sign over the Hawthorne Estate to you right now!"

Vanessa's desperate plea fell on deaf ears. Evelyn merely arched a brow, her lips curling into a cold, mocking smile.

"You don’t want me to perform? And why is that?"

Vanessa bit her lip, her fingers twisting together. The truth burned in her throat, but she couldn’t bring herself to say it.

Evelyn’s laughter was sharp, devoid of warmth. "You're being ridiculous."

She turned, reaching for the door handle to shut it in Vanessa’s face.

But before she could, Vanessa squeezed her eyes shut, tears spilling down her cheeks. "It was me!" she blurted. "I was the one who took your place all those years ago!"

The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating.

Evelyn froze, her grip tightening on the door.

Then, slowly, she turned back, her expression unreadable.

"Explain."

Vanessa swallowed hard, her voice barely a whisper.

"I stole your audition. I pretended to be you. And I—I got everything that should have been yours."

Silence.

Then Evelyn’s smile returned, darker this time.

"Oh, Vanessa," she murmured. "You have no idea what you’ve just done."

The door clicked shut.

Vanessa was left standing alone in the hallway, her confession echoing in her ears.

And for the first time, she realized—she had just signed her own ruin.
###Chapter 223 Living in a Lie

Evelyn hesitated, her fingers lingering on the door handle as she turned back to Vanessa, confusion flickering in her gaze. "What do you mean? What position did you steal from me?"

Vanessa's voice trembled as the truth spilled out. "When Ethan was in a coma after the accident, it was your cello playing that woke him. When he came to, he was desperate to find the musician. I... I told him it was me."

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

"After that, he started paying attention to me—checking in, showing concern. We exchanged numbers, and eventually... we fell in love."

Vanessa had sworn to take this secret to her grave, but now, with Evelyn about to perform, the truth threatened to unravel everything.

If Ethan ever discovered their entire relationship was built on deception, she knew it would destroy him.

"Evelyn, you're married to Alexander now. Anyone can see how much he adores you. You have everything you could ever want."

Her voice cracked with desperation. "Please. Just this once. Don't play the cello in front of Ethan."

Vanessa had been living on borrowed time, sensing Ethan’s growing distance.

The truth was slipping through her fingers like sand.

If Ethan ever uncovered her deception, their marriage would shatter instantly.

Without a legitimate place in the Caldwell family, Vanessa clung to Ethan as her only lifeline.

As long as Evelyn remained silent, she still had a chance to reclaim him.

Tears streaked Vanessa’s face, smudging her meticulously applied makeup. "Evelyn, I’m begging you. Please, just let me have this."

Everything suddenly clicked into place for Evelyn.

No wonder Ethan had withdrawn so abruptly after the accident.

The answer was painfully obvious.

He had been idolizing the memory of his savior, elevating her to the status of his perfect love.

But what he didn’t realize was that his savior had been replaced.

All these years, he had been trapped in the lie Vanessa had woven.

Evelyn stared at her stepsister, her expression icy and unyielding.

"What’s the point of this charade? If Ethan truly loved you, it wouldn’t matter who played the cello that night. He would still—"

Her voice cut off as the weight of the deception settled between them.

Vanessa’s desperation was palpable, but Evelyn refused to be swayed.

The truth was a ticking time bomb, and when it exploded, nothing would remain the same.

Vanessa's fingers trembled as she clutched the edge of the table. "He loves me!" she blurted out, her voice cracking.

Evelyn arched a brow, unimpressed. "Then why are you here? Why beg me not to play?"

The words struck like a slap.

Vanessa's chest tightened. She was terrified—terrified that Ethan's love had always been an illusion, that she had never truly held his heart.

That fear had driven her to this moment, to grovel before the woman she had wronged.

Because if Evelyn played, if Ethan heard that melody… everything would unravel.

"You’re only pretending to be helpless because you need me to clean up your mess," Evelyn said coldly. "Does Ethan know your entire relationship is built on a lie? If you had the nerve to deceive him, you should face the consequences."

Vanessa's composure shattered. "Please, Evelyn! Just this once—"

"Why should I?" Evelyn cut in, her voice sharp. "You stole what was mine. Now you want me to protect you?"

A tear slipped down Vanessa's cheek.

Then another.

The truth was a blade, and Evelyn wielded it without mercy.

In a last-ditch effort, Vanessa Hart clutched the fabric of Evelyn Carter’s gown and collapsed onto the cold marble floor.

The backstage area buzzed with activity, and the sudden commotion instantly drew a crowd of onlookers.

Whispers spread like wildfire.

No one recognized Vanessa, but everyone knew Evelyn.

“What’s happening? Who is that woman?”

“Isn’t she Ethan Caldwell’s wife?”

The murmurs grew louder, filling the air with tension.

Evelyn stood frozen, her expression unreadable.

Vanessa’s fingers trembled as she tightened her grip, desperation burning in her eyes.

She had nothing left to lose.

The audience held their breath, waiting for the next explosive moment.

The truth was about to unravel.
###Chapter 224 The Chaos

A woman from the marketing team gasped when she recognized Vanessa. "What's going on here? Is Evelyn bullying her? But Evelyn's always been so sweet!"

"I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have stolen our parents' affection all these years! Evelyn, please, just let me leave!"

Vanessa's voice trembled as she clutched her hands together. "You want me gone from the family, don't you? I'll go—just promise me you'll stop this!"

Tears streamed down her cheeks. "Evelyn, I know you have a good heart. Please, show me some mercy!"

The crowd around them fell into stunned silence, absorbing the weight of her words.

It was obvious now—Evelyn was forcing her out. That explained Vanessa's desperate pleas.

Murmurs spread like wildfire. People who had once admired Evelyn now eyed her with suspicion.

"How could she be so cruel to her own sister?" someone whispered.

Evelyn stood motionless, her expression unreadable.

She watched Vanessa's performance with icy detachment.

"Really, Vanessa?" Her voice cut through the whispers like a blade. "You're going to pull this act here?"

The tension between them crackled in the air.

Vanessa flinched but didn't back down. "I just want to make things right," she whimpered.

Evelyn's lips curled into a humorless smile.

The crowd held its breath, waiting for her next move.

No one dared to interrupt.

This wasn't just a family dispute anymore—it was a public spectacle.

And Vanessa had just turned the audience against Evelyn.

Without batting an eyelid, Evelyn pulled out her phone. "Go on, say it again. I'll record every word and send it straight to Alexander. Let him see how pathetically desperate you are to stop my performance."

Vanessa froze, her lips parting soundlessly.

Seeing her hesitation, Evelyn smirked and gave her a light, mocking tap on the shoulder. "What’s wrong? Cat got your tongue? The whole room’s watching—don’t waste this spotlight you created for yourself."

Vanessa’s bravado shattered.

She had expected public humiliation to force Evelyn into retreat, but Evelyn wasn’t playing by her rules.

Defeated, Vanessa scrambled to her feet and fled without another word.

She needed a new plan—fast.

The grand hall hummed with anticipation as Evelyn adjusted the strap of her gown, minutes away from her final performance.

Then, her phone buzzed.

A single message flashed on the screen:

[You won’t step on that stage tonight.]

The message came from an unlisted number, but Evelyn Carter’s instincts screamed it was Vanessa Hart behind it.

What twisted game was she playing now?

Refusing to give her the satisfaction of a reaction, Evelyn ignored it and tightened the strings of her cello.

A sharp knock at the door interrupted her thoughts. A staff member gestured—it was time.

She lifted her instrument and followed.

By now, the audience had sat through most of the evening’s performances. The initial buzz had dulled into restless murmurs. Small clusters of guests whispered among themselves while the emcee’s forced enthusiasm fell flat.

Then, without warning, the stage plunged into darkness. The heavy velvet curtains swept shut.

Evelyn rushed to her position, heart pounding as she settled onto the stool.

Her bow hovered above the strings—

The spotlight above her sputtered. Died.

Silence.

Even the emcee’s microphone cut out, the entire venue swallowed by an eerie blackout.

A ripple of confusion spread through the crowd.

Shapes shifted in the dark. Someone gasped.

Then—

A single, jarring note screeched from Evelyn’s cello, the sound warped and unnatural.

Her blood ran cold.

She hadn’t touched the strings.

The grand venue stretched endlessly before me, swallowing voices in its vastness. Without microphones, the air buzzed with disjointed murmurs, a symphony of confusion.

Flickering emergency lights cast eerie shadows across the space. The low hum of anxious whispers filled the dimly lit hall.

In the front row, Alexander Whitmore arched a brow, unimpressed. Beside him, Simon Graves lifted his phone, its harsh beam cutting through the darkness as he edged toward the exit.

Despite the blackout, the live stream persisted, powered by backup generators. Thousands of viewers remained glued to their screens, their disbelief pouring into the chat.

[Is this for real? A gala hosted by Titan Capital Group, and they can’t even keep the lights on?]

[Honestly, it’s the last performance anyway. Maybe the universe is telling us to log off.]

[Wasn’t Evelyn Carter supposed to play the cello? After last year’s cringe poetry reading, I had some hope. Now? Total train wreck.]

[Bet she only touched a cello for the first time yesterday.]

The comments flooded in, mocking the prestigious firm’s spectacular failure.

To make matters worse, the act before Evelyn had been a wildly popular comedian—the crowd’s energy had peaked, only to crash into darkness.

Now, all eyes (or what little they could see) were on her.

And the chaos was just beginning.

Vanessa Hart lingered near the grand staircase, her crimson lips curling into a satisfied smirk as she surveyed the pandemonium unfolding before her.

The once-elegant ballroom of Whitmore Manor had descended into utter bedlam. Crystal glasses shattered against marble floors. Shrill accusations cut through the air like knives.

Alexander Whitmore stood frozen near the terrace doors, his usually composed features twisted in shock. His grip on Evelyn Carter's wrist had gone bone-white.

Across the room, Ethan Caldwell deliberately knocked over a champagne tower, sending golden liquid cascading over horrified guests. His cousin Ryan Fletcher cheered drunkenly from the sidelines.

Eleanor Caldwell clutched her pearls, her face ashen as she whispered urgently to her husband Vincent Black. Nearby, Grace Caldwell had tears streaming down her carefully contoured cheeks.

Vanessa's manicured fingers traced the stem of her wine glass.

Every carefully laid domino was falling exactly as planned.

The grand clock struck midnight just as Evelyn tore free from Alexander's grasp. Her emerald gown swirled like stormy seas as she turned toward the exit.

Vanessa took a slow sip of merlot, savoring the bitter notes.

The real show was about to begin.

###Chapter 225 Spellbinding Performance

The curtains parted, but Evelyn missed the flash of panic on Vanessa's face. A heavy wave of disappointment settled in her chest.

Already, some guests were rising to leave. Evelyn clutched Ethan's arm, her voice trembling. "Ethan, how could a prestigious hotel like this lose power? I can't stand the dark—let's go!"

Ethan's brow furrowed as he surveyed the chaos.

The abrupt blackout, the murmurs of confusion—it was obvious the gala was effectively over.

He adjusted his suit jacket, preparing to escort her out, when suddenly, a rich, resonant cello note sliced through the tension.

Evelyn froze, her expression darkening.

How is Vanessa still playing without amplification?

In the disarray, the crowd stilled as if under a spell. The music—raw, unfiltered—wrapped around them, commanding silence.

Without microphones, every whisper would drown out the performance.

One by one, guests pulled out their phones, illuminating the stage with scattered beams of light.

Slowly, the glow converged on Vanessa, seated gracefully in the makeshift spotlight.

She looked ethereal, untouched by the surrounding turmoil. Cradling her cello, she leaned into the instrument, drawing out a melody that filled the room with aching beauty.

Vanessa had only played for two years—barely a blink in the world of classical music.

In that time, she'd mastered only the fundamentals.

After Ethan's accident, she'd abandoned the cello entirely. It wasn't until these past few weeks that she'd dared to pick it up again.

Her playing wasn't about technical perfection. It was raw emotion, pure and unfiltered.

Two years wasn't enough to master the instrument, but her innate talent was undeniable.

Even her former teacher had lamented her departure.

He'd visited her personally, urging her not to waste her gift. With time, he insisted, she could command her own stage, her own audience—

The thought hung unfinished as the music swelled, holding everyone captive.

The spotlight dimmed to a single beam, illuminating Evelyn Carter's slender fingers as they danced across the cello strings.

She had once rejected an invitation to perform at Carnegie Hall.

The memory still haunted her.

If only she hadn't struggled to hail a cab with her instrument that day, Alexander wouldn't have driven through the storm to fetch her. The accident that followed had shattered their world.

After playing Chopin's "Nocturne" at his hospital bedside, she'd sworn never to touch the cello again.

Yet here she was.

The mournful notes of Elgar's "Cello Concerto" flowed like liquid emotion, each vibration resonating through the hushed auditorium. The darkness amplified every whisper of sound, wrapping the audience in velvet sorrow.

Not a single cough disturbed the performance.

Even the live-stream comments froze mid-sentence.

Evelyn's bowed head cast shadows across her face, her lashes trembling against pale cheeks. The lone spotlight transformed her into a porcelain figurine - fragile yet radiating quiet strength.

She wasn't just playing music.

She was weaving a tapestry of loss and redemption, pulling every listener into her private universe. The strings trembled with unshed tears, the bow trembling like a wounded bird taking flight.

Music professors held their breath beside tone-deaf teenagers.

Businessmen forgot their stock portfolios.

Housewives clutched damp tissues.

In this suspended moment, Evelyn Carter didn't just perform.

She resurrected souls.

As the final note lingered in the air, Evelyn rose gracefully from the piano bench and bowed deeply.

A hushed silence had fallen over the auditorium, the audience still spellbound by her musical spell.

Then, like a dam breaking, the room exploded into deafening applause that seemed to shake the very walls. The standing ovation continued long after the music had faded, a powerful tribute to the emotional journey she'd taken them on.

On the live stream, comments scrolled at lightning speed:

"I've never heard anything so moving!"
"That crescendo literally gave me chills!"
"How is this even humanly possible?"

Alexander watched from the wings, his chest swelling with pride as he saw tears glistening on several audience members' faces. Even the sternest critics in the front row were dabbing at their eyes.

Backstage, Claire clutched Vanessa's arm. "She's done it," she whispered. "She's actually surpassed everyone's expectations."

Vanessa could only nod mutely, her usual sharp tongue silenced by the sheer brilliance of what they'd just witnessed.

The moderator approached the microphone, visibly emotional. "Ladies and gentlemen... Evelyn Carter."

Another wave of applause crashed over the stage as camera flashes lit up Evelyn's radiant smile. This wasn't just a performance - it was a moment that would be talked about for years to come.

###Chapter 226 Prejudice

[No way! This can't be real!]

The live chat exploded with disbelief, every comment reflecting the audience's stunned reactions.

[Is this actually Titan Capital's annual gala? That cellist sounds like a world-class musician!]

[Camera crew, do your job! Show us her face! I need to see this mystery woman!]

[Wait—that instrument! Isn't that the legendary cello owned by maestro Lucas Bennett? How is it here?!]

[Someone tell us who she is!]

Just then, the venue lights flickered back to life.

After sitting in darkness for so long, the audience blinked against the sudden brightness.

When they turned toward the stage again, Evelyn had already vanished with her cello—no one had even noticed her leave.

Natalie squeezed Cassandra's wrist, her voice trembling with excitement. "That was unbelievable! Our department just made history!"

Cassandra nodded enthusiastically. "I assumed she was just fooling around, but damn, she's got serious skills! My cousin is watching the livestream and just messaged me asking for Evelyn's contact!"

Natalie clasped her hands together, grinning. "Give it to him! Who knows, maybe you'll be family one day!"

"Absolutely! I'm texting him right now!"

Meanwhile, Daniel cleared his throat.

The others in the executive office remained clueless about Evelyn's true identity, but he knew better.

In fact, he had overheard whispers about it earlier that morning.

"Cassandra, wait. Evelyn… is actually Mr. Whitmore's wife."

"What?!" Cassandra's jaw dropped. "You're joking! How did I miss something this massive?"

She prided herself on being the queen of office gossip, yet no one had breathed a word about Evelyn being Alexander's wife.

Victoria, who had stayed quiet until now, scoffed. "Daniel, where did you hear such nonsense? Mr. Whitmore would never marry someone like her."

Natalie immediately bristled. "What's that supposed to mean? Evelyn is amazing—why wouldn't she be good enough for Mr. Whitmore?"

Victoria shook her head dismissively. "She's just another pretty face in the office! Let's be honest - she's decorative at best. Mr. Whitmore is CEO of Titan Capital. Do you honestly believe Evelyn has the poise and breeding of a proper society woman?"

In Victoria's shallow worldview, elegance meant dripping in designer labels and flaunting the latest Birkin bag. Evelyn's minimalist wardrobe and understated jewelry clearly didn't meet her superficial standards.

Daniel spoke up quietly but firmly. "Evelyn carries herself with more grace than most society women I've met. Have you heard of the Hayes family? They founded Horizon Enterprises. She's William Hayes' granddaughter."

Horizon Enterprises was a name that carried weight. Once a dominant force in Cresthaven's business scene, it had ranked among the top conglomerates during its heyday.

Though the company had faced recent struggles, its legacy still commanded more respect than most fledgling startups could dream of.

Victoria's lips twisted in disbelief. "That's just coincidence! Mr. Whitmore clearly isn't interested in her. Remember when she made those headlines chasing after him? He didn't even acknowledge her existence!"

Meanwhile backstage, Evelyn remained blissfully unaware she'd become the center of office gossip.

The internet was ablaze with chatter, viral clips of her cello performance spreading like wildfire across every platform.

Meanwhile, Simon leaned in close, murmuring something into Alexander’s ear.

A dangerous glint flashed in Alexander’s eyes as they narrowed sharply.

This wasn’t just a random power outage—it was deliberate.

His gaze swept the room like a predator, locking onto Ethan Caldwell’s section with chilling precision.

###Chapter 227 An Eye for an Eye

Ethan stood frozen, his gaze vacant as the murmurs about the cello performance swirled around him.

He seemed miles away, detached from reality.

Vanessa's pulse quickened with unease.

She stole a glance at his expression before whispering, "Ethan…"

No response. He was trapped in his own thoughts.

Then Simon appeared. "Ms. Vanessa Hart, Mr. Whitmore requests your presence."

Her breath hitched. Instinctively, she looked toward Alexander, meeting his piercing, icy stare.

Her stomach twisted. Something was very wrong.

Guilt gnawed at her. She tugged lightly at Ethan’s sleeve, hoping he’d intervene.

But he remained motionless, lost in whatever storm raged inside him.

With a quiet exhale, Vanessa followed Simon to Alexander.

They stepped into a shadowed hallway, the air thick with tension.

Alexander tossed a small vial onto the floor in front of her, his expression unreadable. "Drink it."

A shiver raced down her spine. "Alexander, what is this?"

His lips curled in cold amusement as he took a slow drag from his cigarette. "You don’t recognize it? This is what you intended for Evelyn."

Simon watched with open disgust, his jaw tight.

Vanessa’s legs trembled. Her lips parted, her voice barely audible. "Please…"

Moonlight cut through the window, sharp and unforgiving, casting his sharp features in stark relief.

He exhaled smoke, refusing to meet her pleading gaze.

Tears blurred her vision.

When she didn’t move, Simon spoke, his tone clipped. "Ms. Hart, I’d rather not force this. My girlfriend would never forgive me if she found out."

A single tear traced down Vanessa's flushed cheek. "Alexander, Evelyn didn't touch it. Just... let me go this once, please?"

The cocktail contained a potent mix guaranteed to wreak havoc on anyone's digestive system for seventy-two hours straight.

Alexander's icy gaze barely flickered in her direction. "She didn't drink it because she was saving it for you. Did you truly believe there'd be no repercussions for pulling this stunt at Horizon Enterprises' gala?"

A humorless chuckle escaped him as he ground his cigarette into the marble floor, his patience visibly evaporating. "Unless you'd prefer Ethan to drink it in your stead?"

Vanessa's blood ran cold at the suggestion.

If Ethan ever discovered this, whatever fragile trust remained between them would shatter beyond repair.

Her manicured nails dug into her palms. "Fine. I'll drink it."

Alexander observed with detached amusement as she gulped down the tainted liquid.

Within seconds, an audible gurgle erupted from her abdomen.

Doubling over, she clutched her stomach as a wave of nausea hit her like a freight train.

She barely managed three steps toward the exit when a familiar figure materialized before her.

Ethan leaned against the corridor wall, his expression unreadable.

Ethan's piercing gaze was glacial, sending shivers down Vanessa's spine. The air between them crackled with tension, thick enough to slice through.

Her pulse hammered in her throat.

Swallowing hard, she forced herself to speak. "Ethan... what's going on?"

His expression remained unreadable, his eyes dark and distant—as if she were nothing more than a stranger standing before him.

"I gave you every chance," he said, his voice dangerously low. "Yet you chose to lie to me."

Vanessa stiffened.

"You betrayed me." The accusation cut through the silence like a blade. "All these years, you let me believe it was you. But it wasn't. The one who played the cello while I was in that coma—it was never you. Why would you deceive me like this?"

No one could possibly understand just how much that mysterious cellist had meant to him back then.

The weight of his words crushed her.

###Chapter 228 Was This Feeling Love?

Darkness swallowed Ethan whole, pulling him into its endless void. Then came the music - a haunting cello melody that became his lifeline, tugging him back from death's doorstep.

Though his eyes remained shut, his ears became his only tether to the world. Each time those soulful notes reached him, scattered fragments of his consciousness stitched themselves together.

The melody was his lighthouse in the abyss.

During those hazy moments between life and death, Ethan became convinced he'd stepped inside the musician's soul. Their connection felt transcendental - as if their spirits had been forged from the same celestial fire.

The moment he regained consciousness, finding the mystery cellist became his obsession.

Vanessa claimed the honor. With her ability to flawlessly recreate the composition, he saw no reason to doubt her.

His heart softened toward her ever since.

Only now did the devastating truth reveal itself. Vanessa's deception ran deeper than he'd imagined. What began as a single lie had snowballed into years of manipulation.

The realization struck like a physical blow. That sacred connection he'd cherished? A carefully constructed illusion. The soulmate bond he'd felt? Nothing but smoke and mirrors.

Somewhere out there, the true musician waited. And Ethan would move heaven and earth to find them.

His heart shattered into pieces, leaving him feeling like the world's biggest fool.

He had mistaken the wrong woman all along.

Vanessa's tears spilled over as she clutched his sleeve. "Ethan, I've loved you for years. I know it was selfish, but I just wanted you to notice me."

Now that Ethan knew everything, there was no point in hiding anymore.

Her fingers trembled against his wrist. "It was my only chance to be close to you. Every day, I thought about telling you the truth, but I was terrified of losing you. Ethan, I love you. Is that so wrong?"

Her voice cracked. "Please, forgive me. Yes, I lied, but everything between us was real. You still care for me, don’t you?"

Ethan's expression wavered.

Vanessa had always been gentle, attentive—the perfect partner. She doted on him, admired him, made him feel like he was everything.

Her devotion had been unwavering.

But was this love?

Or just the illusion of it?

Perhaps he was merely addicted to the comfort Vanessa provided.

But Evelyn...

Just thinking about her made Ethan's blood boil with frustration.

She had been his first love, and lately, her face haunted his thoughts relentlessly.

Especially when he witnessed Alexander kissing her—something primal inside him snapped awake.

He desired Evelyn physically, yet even lying beside Vanessa, he felt an emptiness he couldn't ignore.

He didn’t want her. Not even when she initiated. Not even when she tried.

Was it her body? No. Vanessa had curves that turned heads, a face men admired.

Then what was it?

Ethan didn’t know. Or maybe he did—but admitting it terrified him.

He couldn’t face the truth: that Evelyn had always been the one he truly loved.

His fist slammed into the wall, knuckles splitting.

Would begging even work? Would Evelyn ever look at him again?

The thought clawed at him, sharp and unrelenting.

Vanessa's breath hitched as Ethan's sudden aggression sent chills down her spine.

She couldn't tell if he truly believed her fabricated story or if his temper had merely settled into something more dangerous.

But right now, none of that mattered.

The coffee laced with croton seeds churned violently in her stomach, sending sharp waves of pain through her abdomen.

She needed to get to the bathroom—now.

Spinning on her heel, she tried to bolt, but Ethan's fingers clamped around her wrist like a steel trap.

Before she could react, he shoved her against the wall, his lips crashing onto hers with bruising force.

It was a test—a desperate attempt to prove his desire wasn't solely reserved for Evelyn.

Under different circumstances, Vanessa would have melted into the kiss, savoring every second of his attention.

But not today.

Not when her body was screaming in protest.

She shoved him back with surprising strength, her face contorted in distress.

Ethan frowned, mistaking her resistance for some twisted game.

His grip tightened, and he yanked her closer, his mouth descending on hers again—harsher this time.

Vanessa's stomach twisted.

She was out of time.

The moment hung suspended between them, electric and fragile. Evelyn could feel Alexander's breath warm against her lips, her heart pounding so loudly she was certain he could hear it. The world had narrowed to just the two of them, the rest of the room fading into a blur.

Then—

A sharp, crackling sound shattered the silence, like fireworks exploding too close.

Evelyn jerked back, her pulse leaping into her throat. Alexander's grip on her waist tightened instinctively, his gaze snapping toward the source of the noise.

"What the hell—?"

Before he could finish, another series of pops erupted, followed by the distant sound of laughter and clinking glasses.

Evelyn exhaled shakily, pressing a hand to her chest. "Someone must have set off champagne corks."

Alexander's expression darkened, frustration flashing in his eyes. "Of all the damn timing."

She bit her lip, torn between amusement and lingering disappointment. The moment had been perfect—until it wasn't.

Then his thumb brushed her cheek, his voice lowering to a rough murmur. "We could always try again."

Her breath hitched.

But before she could respond, another round of cheers erupted from downstairs, followed by the unmistakable sound of footsteps approaching.

The door burst open.

"Alex! There you—oh." Lucas Bennett froze in the doorway, his grin faltering as he took in the scene. "Uh. Am I interrupting something?"

Alexander exhaled through his teeth, his grip on Evelyn loosening just enough to let her step back. "Yes."

Lucas winced. "Right. Sorry. But, uh—your mother's looking for you. Something about the investors arriving early?"

Evelyn smoothed her dress, willing her heartbeat to steady. The spell was well and truly broken.

Alexander shot Lucas a glare before turning back to her, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Later."

It wasn't a question.

She nodded, her lips curving despite herself.

Later.

But as she followed him out, she couldn't shake the thought—was this fluttering in her chest just nerves, or something far more dangerous?

Something like love.
###Chapter 229 An Unexpected Incident

Ethan froze, his piercing gaze locked onto Vanessa in utter shock.

She had always maintained perfect poise around him, every movement calculated to preserve her flawless image.

His dark eyes narrowed slightly, a storm of thoughts brewing behind them.

Vanessa stood paralyzed, her face draining of color. Before she could process what happened, the initial horror gave way to an unsettling relief.

She had just soiled herself.

Ethan's expression turned icy.

He was notorious for his obsessive cleanliness. The way he looked at her now was nothing short of disgust.

Never in her life had she felt such humiliation—especially not in front of the man she adored.

She wanted the ground to swallow her whole.

Face burning, she clutched her skirt and hobbled away without another word.

Ethan remained rooted in place, struggling to reconcile this moment with the pristine image he'd always held of her.

To him, Vanessa had been untouchable—elegant, composed, immaculate.

Now, that illusion lay shattered at his feet.

But now, his perception of her shattered completely.

She had soiled herself right in front of him.

Ethan Caldwell exhaled sharply, pulling a cigarette from his pocket and lighting it with a flick of his lighter. The bitter taste did nothing to soothe his irritation.

He couldn’t forgive Vanessa Hart.

Not just for the humiliation—but for the deception.

She had never been the cellist from all those years ago. That woman had been his soulmate, the one he had bared his heart to. Every moment of vulnerability, every shared secret—it had all been built on a lie.

His attention, his affection—none of it had ever belonged to Vanessa.

It should have been Evelyn Carter.

The realization struck him like a physical blow.

For years, he had poured his emotions into the wrong woman.

His jaw clenched as frustration coiled tight in his chest. The cigarette burned between his fingers, but the smoke did nothing to ease the storm inside him.

The woman he had loved didn’t exist.

Vanessa had crafted an illusion, and he had fallen for it.

Now, all that remained was the bitter taste of betrayal.

In his mind, she had always been innocent and pure.

But she had been lying to him all along.

He felt like a fool, manipulated by her carefully crafted deception.

Ethan suddenly recalled how he and Vanessa had gotten married. That night, he had drunk too much, and she had taken him to a hotel.

When they woke up the next morning, reporters swarmed the entrance, cameras flashing. To protect their reputations, they announced their marriage publicly.

Now, he realized it had all been her plan. She had orchestrated everything, pulling strings to become his wife.

She wasn’t the naive woman he had believed her to be.

What else had she hidden from him?

Three years ago, his relationship with Evelyn had ended abruptly.

At the time, Vanessa had been kidnapped by a group of criminals. When he rushed to the abandoned warehouse where she was being held, he found her tied up, trembling.

Her eyes were red from crying, her wrists raw from the ropes.

The men surrounding her had leered, their intentions clear.

Had that been staged too?

A cold realization settled in his chest.

If she had faked her own kidnapping, what else was she capable of?

Ethan's protective instincts surged like wildfire.

He dashed forward without hesitation, wrapping Vanessa in his arms just in time.

Vanessa tearfully accused Evelyn of conspiring with the thugs, claiming she had paid them to assault her.

Blinded by rage, Ethan struck Evelyn across the face.

How could the woman he once trusted stoop so low?

Was this all because of petty jealousy?

Evelyn sobbed, insisting she was innocent—that Vanessa had staged the entire scene.

A flicker of doubt crossed Ethan’s mind.

But then Vanessa dropped the bombshell—Evelyn had slept with the gang leader to guarantee their cooperation.

Ethan’s world shattered.

She was his fiancée. How could she betray him like this?

The memory became an open wound, one Vanessa alone had whispered to him.

Determined to uncover the truth, he launched a private investigation.

The results left him reeling.

The crime boss openly confessed to sleeping with Evelyn and taking her virginity.

Ethan Caldwell stubbed out his cigarette with a sharp twist of his wrist, the memory gnawing at him.

Evelyn had given herself to a criminal, while he—her former fiancé—had never even tasted her lips.

Bitterness had driven him into Vanessa Hart's arms, using her as a weapon against Evelyn's betrayal.

But now, a chilling possibility struck him like lightning.

What if Evelyn had been set up all along?

###Chapter 230 Where's Alexander?

Evelyn had never conspired with those criminals, nor had she ever been intimate with them. The entire scenario had been meticulously orchestrated by Vanessa herself.

A chill ran down Ethan's spine.

If this was true, Vanessa was far more cunning than he'd ever imagined.

1/5

Having deceived him once, it wouldn't be difficult for her to do it again—especially given how skilled she was at manipulation and disguise.

At that moment, only one thought consumed Ethan's mind.

He needed to see Evelyn. Now.

He wanted to hear her recount the events of that night, to confirm whether his suspicions were correct.

Ethan moved swiftly toward the hotel elevators, knowing Evelyn was staying in Room 808.

When he reached the eighth floor, he stood outside her door and pressed the doorbell repeatedly.

No answer.

His frown deepened. A sudden realization struck him.

Was Evelyn with Alexander?

His pulse quickened.

If she was, then everything was about to become infinitely more complicated.

Ethan Caldwell stormed up the grand staircase, his footsteps echoing with barely contained fury.

His mind replayed the events of last night—Evelyn Carter and Alexander Whitmore tangled in the sheets of the presidential suite.

The thought sent a sharp, twisting pain through his chest.

He had been Evelyn’s first love, yet he had never dared to claim her so completely. But Alexander? He had taken everything in a single night.

Ethan reached the door of Alexander’s suite and jabbed the doorbell with a trembling finger.

He knew this was reckless. Undignified. But he didn’t care.

Even if Alexander tore into him with that cold, cutting voice, even if it cost him everything—he had to see her.

No answer.

His fist pounded against the door, the sound reverberating down the hall.

Simon Graves, Alexander’s ever-watchful assistant, emerged from the neighboring suite, his sharp eyes widening at Ethan’s disheveled state.

“What the hell is going on?” Simon demanded, his voice laced with irritation.

Ethan whirled on him, gripping his shoulders with bruising force.

“Where is he?” Ethan’s voice was raw, desperate. “Where’s Alexander? He’s with Evelyn, isn’t he?”

Simon gave a curt nod. "They're probably enjoying chocolate fondue right now."

Ethan's expression darkened as he turned on his heel. As he strode down the hallway, a door suddenly swung open.

Vanessa emerged, her hair still damp from the shower. "Ethan! Where are you going?" Her voice trembled with barely concealed panic.

The conversation with Ethan had left her unsettled. She couldn't tell how much of her story he actually believed.

Though he'd surprised her with that unexpected kiss, his eyes had remained chillingly distant.

"Ethan, wait up!"

When he stepped into the elevator without responding, Vanessa didn't hesitate. She sprinted after him, her bare feet slapping against the marble floor.

Even from several feet away, she could feel the icy aura surrounding him.

This version of Ethan was unfamiliar territory for her.

The elevator doors began closing when Vanessa slipped inside. Instead of pressing the lobby button, Ethan's finger jabbed the penthouse level.

As they ascended, Vanessa's pulse quickened. The rooftop access was always locked - except today, when the door stood slightly ajar.

The moment the elevator chimed, Ethan seized Vanessa's wrist with bruising force. Without a word, he dragged her onto the windswept rooftop.

The skyscraper loomed ominously over the coastline, its height offering a panoramic view that only emphasized the endless darkness of the sea below.

The waves crashed violently against the shore, their inky blackness swallowing any trace of light.

Without warning, Ethan swung his legs over the rooftop railing and perched precariously on the edge.

Vanessa's breath caught in her throat.

Thirty stories up—a nightmare for anyone with even the slightest fear of heights. The railing offered no protection, and one wrong move would send him plummeting into the abyss.

Her pulse spiked. "Ethan, get down! It's not safe!"

He didn’t even glance her way.

His gaze remained fixed on the starless sky, empty and suffocating.

A sharp gust of wind tugged at his shirt, making him look even smaller against the vast, unforgiving night.

What was going through his mind?

No one could tell.

###Chapter 231 Love's Deception

Ethan stood motionless, his gaze fixed on the horizon. Though he wasn’t one to dwell on emotions, an unbearable ache twisted inside him, as if an unseen force were crushing his heart.

Vanessa’s voice trembled as she spoke. "Ethan, do you still resent me? I know deceiving you was wrong, but I did it because I love you. Everything I’ve done was out of love for you."

She took a hesitant step closer. "Can’t we just move past this and start fresh? Are you really going to punish me forever over one lie?"

Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her expression fragile and pleading—just like the day he had rescued her three years ago from those ruthless criminals.

But now, the memory only filled him with bitter irony.

She was a master of masks.

Ethan turned abruptly, vaulting down from the railing before closing the distance between them in three swift strides.

Vanessa’s red-rimmed eyes met his, wide with hope.

Yet all he felt was disgust.

Did she truly believe love could excuse betrayal?

Ethan felt the bitter taste of betrayal coating his tongue.

She had played him for a fool all this time.

His jaw tightened as he studied Vanessa’s tear-streaked face, wondering if those glistening drops were just another calculated performance. A desperate act to manipulate his sympathy.

"Vanessa," he said, voice dangerously low. "Tell me the truth. Did Evelyn really sleep with that criminal three years ago?"

Her breath hitched at the sudden mention of the past.

Her gaze flickered away before she forced herself to meet his piercing stare.

Vanessa’s nails dug into her palms as she bit down on her lower lip.

She exhaled sharply before answering with forced conviction. "I swear I didn’t lie about this! Evelyn slept with him! Don’t you remember? You heard the man confess it yourself!"

Ethan’s eyes darkened. "And you didn’t orchestrate the kidnapping, did you?"

Her lips parted in shock. "You think I would stage something like that? Risk my own reputation just to frame her?" Her voice trembled. "Ethan, just because I lied once doesn’t mean everything I say is a lie."

When his expression remained unreadable, a tear slipped down her cheek.

She lifted her chin, voice breaking as she whispered, "I swear on my life—if I lied about the kidnapping, let me die a wretched death."

The silence between them was suffocating.

Ethan didn’t move.

Didn’t speak.

Just watched her, searching for any flicker of deceit in her desperate eyes.

Her solemn promise carried undeniable sincerity.

Yet for reasons he couldn't explain, Ethan found himself unable to trust her words.

He needed to see Evelyn—to hear the truth from her lips himself.

Ethan pulled away from Vanessa's grasp and turned toward the staircase without a word.

"Ethan, wait!" she called after him, stumbling slightly in her heels. "I can't keep up!"

She reached for his hand, desperate to stop him.

But he didn't slow down. Instead, he jerked his arm away, refusing to even glance back.

Vanessa froze, stunned by the coldness in his voice.

"Let's take some time apart," he said flatly.

Her breath hitched. "What?"

Tears welled in her eyes as she rushed after him, but he was already moving faster, his figure nearly vanishing down the hall.

Panic set in. She pushed forward, her heels clicking against the marble—until one caught in a crack.

A sharp gasp escaped her as she lurched forward, barely catching herself.

By the time she steadied herself, Ethan was gone.

Evelyn leaned forward, her balance faltering as her knees hit the hardwood floor with a sharp crack.

A gasp escaped her lips.

Pain shot through her legs, sharp and sudden.

She winced, clutching at the edge of the nearby table for support.

Alexander was beside her in an instant, his hands gripping her shoulders.

"Evelyn!" His voice was laced with alarm.

She bit her lip, blinking back the sting in her eyes.

"I'm fine," she lied, forcing a weak smile.

His fingers brushed against her cheek, warm and reassuring.

"You're not," he murmured, his gaze searching hers.

A heartbeat passed between them, heavy with unspoken words.

Then, without warning, he pulled her into his arms.

Her breath hitched as his lips found hers, soft yet insistent.

When they finally parted, his voice was rough with emotion.

"I love you."

The words wrapped around her like a promise.

Evelyn's heart raced, her earlier pain forgotten.

She opened her mouth to respond—

But a sudden knock at the door shattered the moment.

Alexander tensed, his grip tightening protectively around her.

The knocking came again, louder this time.

Urgent.

Demanding.

Evelyn swallowed hard, a chill creeping down her spine.

Something was wrong.

###Chapter 232 Won't You Stay With Me?

Vanessa let out a sharp cry as searing pain shot through her knees. The rough pavement had torn her palms, leaving angry red scratches dotted with tiny pebbles.

Up ahead, Ethan halted abruptly at the sound. His broad shoulders tensed beneath his tailored suit before he slowly turned.

His cold gaze swept over her crumpled form on the ground. For a long moment, he simply watched her struggle to rise. Then, with deliberate steps, he retraced his path.

A shadow fell across Vanessa as Ethan loomed over her. His extended hand hovered between them, an unspoken offer that made her heart leap.

He came back for me. The realization sent warmth flooding through her chest. Even through his fury, he couldn't bear to leave her hurt.

Tears welled in her eyes as she looked up at him. The streetlights caught the tracks of moisture on her cheeks, emphasizing her delicate features. She knew exactly how vulnerable she appeared - how it would tug at any man's protective instincts.

"Ethan..."

His fingers closed around her wrist with surprising gentleness, pulling her upright. But when she met his eyes, they held only glacial detachment. The warmth she'd hoped to find had frozen solid.

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the curtains as Vanessa sat on the floor, her delicate frame trembling. The pain in her knees was nothing compared to the ache in her heart when she thought about the love they'd once shared.

"Are you hurt?" Ethan's voice was softer than she'd expected.

Vanessa bit her lower lip, letting crystalline tears roll down her cheeks. "It's excruciating. My knees are bleeding, and my hands..." Her voice trailed off into a fragile whisper.

No man could resist such vulnerability.

Ethan reached out, his thumb brushing away her tears with surprising tenderness. "Let's get you back to the suite."

Vanessa stole cautious glances at him as they walked, relief flooding her when she saw no trace of irritation in his expression.

Back in the luxurious sitting room, she perched on the velvet sofa. When Ethan turned toward the door, her breath caught in her throat.

"Ethan," she called out, her voice trembling, "won't you stay with me?"

"I believe I mentioned we needed some time apart."

Vanessa's mind raced. Time apart? Absolutely not. She'd seen too many relationships crumble after temporary separations.

"Ethan! Please don't go!" Fresh tears spilled over as she reached for him.

The sight of her distress shattered Ethan's resolve. After all, she was still his wife.

The foundation of this marriage had been built on lies, yet for so long, she hadn't committed any grave mistakes.

Ethan's voice was ice-cold as he stated, "I'll have the medical team tend to your injuries."

Vanessa's heart raced with panic. "But what about you?"

"I need space."

With those clipped words, Ethan turned on his heel.

Her fingers twitched, instinctively reaching for him, but all they grasped was the fleeting brush of his sleeve fabric.

He wouldn't be coming home tonight.

The realization hit Vanessa like a physical blow.

The door's sharp slam echoed through the room, severing her last glimpse of him.

Minutes crawled by before knuckles rapped against wood.

Hope flared - had he returned? She practically flew to the entrance, only to find medical personnel holding sterile supplies.

The light in her eyes died instantly, replaced by smoldering frustration.

Her nails dug into her palms as she contemplated her next move. How could she possibly reel Ethan back in?

This was bad. Really bad. He wouldn't even speak to her now!

Ethan stormed downstairs and barreled straight into the first hotpot place he saw.

The restaurant was packed to the brim. He weaved through crowded tables, nearly colliding with servers carrying steaming pots multiple times.

His eyes darted everywhere, searching desperately for Evelyn.

Simon had mentioned she was having hotpot with Alexander. This was the only decent hotpot joint in the area - she had to be here!

Yet after three frantic laps around the dining area, he still couldn't spot her. His pulse pounded in his ears.

"Sir, we're at full capacity. Do you have a reservation?" A nervous waiter intercepted him, eyeing his agitated movements.

"I'm looking for someone. Is Evelyn Carter dining here?"

The waiter checked the reservation list and shook his head. "No Evelyn Carter in our system today."

"What about Alexander Whitmore?" Ethan blurted out, forgetting formalities in his panic.

The waiter's eyes widened slightly at the recognizable name. "Let me check again, sir."

Ethan's fingers drummed impatiently against his thigh as he waited. The spicy aroma of simmering broths suddenly felt suffocating.

"I'm sorry, sir. No reservation under that name either."

Ethan's stomach dropped. Where else could she be? He pulled out his phone with trembling hands, ready to call every restaurant in the district if necessary.

Just then, through the steamed-up front window, he caught a glimpse of familiar chestnut hair walking past outside. His breath hitched.

Without another word to the confused staff, Ethan shoved through the exit, nearly knocking over a departing couple in his haste.

"Evelyn!" His voice cracked as he burst onto the sidewalk.

But when he reached the spot where he'd seen her, the sidewalk stood empty. Just the distant echo of heels clicking around the corner.

He ran a hand through his disheveled hair, chest heaving. Was he imagining things now?

The sinking realization hit him like a physical blow - he might have truly lost her this time.
###Chapter 233 The Fireworks

The waiter tapped on the keyboard, scanning the reservation list once more. "There was a guest registered under Caldwell, but they've already left about twenty minutes ago." His brow furrowed slightly. "Sir, you must have just missed them."

Ethan froze. Had Evelyn really been here?

Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode out of the restaurant.

The night stretched before him—endless and disorienting. The city lights blurred into the distance, roads branching in every direction. He wanted to chase after her, but where?

His fingers clenched around his phone as he dialed her number. The call didn’t even ring. Just silence.

Blocked. Again.

Jaw tight, he stormed into the nearest convenience store, grabbed two bottles of whiskey, and twisted the caps off with a sharp crack. He drank them fast, the burn doing nothing to dull the ache in his chest.

They said alcohol numbed the pain. Lies.

Meanwhile, on the opposite shore, Evelyn walked barefoot along the wet sand, the ocean lapping at her toes.

She bent down, fingers brushing against a large conch half-buried in the sand. Lifting it to her ear, she closed her eyes.

The distant roar of the waves echoed faintly—like a memory just out of reach.

Evelyn found everything utterly enchanting. Having spent her entire life inland, this was her first encounter with the ocean's majesty.

She dashed toward Alexander with childlike enthusiasm, clutching a delicate seashell in her palm.

He tilted his head slightly, his gaze smoldering as it locked onto hers. "Is this for me?"

His fingers traced feather-light circles against her skin, sending shivers down her spine.

The teasing touch made her instinctively curl her fingers inward.

Seizing the opportunity, Alexander captured her hand and pulled her flush against him.

Evelyn gasped as she collided with his solid chest, the impact knocking the breath from her lungs.

Wrapped in his embrace, she inhaled his intoxicating scent—sandalwood and something uniquely him.

Her pulse stuttered when his thumb began stroking slow, deliberate patterns across her wrist. She was utterly spellbound.

He nuzzled against her neck, his voice a velvet rumble. "Mrs. Whitmore, I'm placing this in our vault. My first gift from you."

The proximity was overwhelming. His warm breath fanned over her sensitive skin, making her heart race wildly.

"It's just a seashell, nothing special. You don't need to lock it away like some priceless treasure."

"You couldn't be more mistaken." Alexander's gaze held a quiet intensity as he studied her. "Anything my wife gives me is priceless."

Evelyn froze.

She had always viewed their marriage as a transaction—a practical arrangement.

She needed security, and he had provided it.

Love had never been part of the equation.

So why did her pulse suddenly quicken under his unwavering attention?

He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Since you've given me something so precious, Mrs. Whitmore, it's only fair I return the favor."

Before she could process his words—

The night sky exploded in color.

The beach was dark, the moon hidden behind clouds.

But now, fireworks painted the heavens in dazzling hues, each burst brighter than the last, transforming the quiet shore into a spectacle of light.

The reflections danced across Alexander's face as he watched her, his expression unreadable.

And for the first time, Evelyn wondered if she had misunderstood everything.

The brilliant explosion of colors in the night sky drew every gaze along the shoreline, including Ethan Caldwell's from across the beach.

His feet moved on their own, carrying him toward the dazzling spectacle.

Then he saw them.

Alexander Whitmore stood tall and commanding, his stormy eyes burning with intensity as they remained fixed on Evelyn Carter's face. She was his entire universe in that moment.

Evelyn looked breathtaking in her shimmering emerald gown, loose curls cascading around her shoulders as the ocean breeze played with them. The way she gazed up at Alexander with such raw emotion made Ethan's chest tighten painfully.

They were perfection together.

A sharp pang of jealousy shot through Ethan's heart. Hot tears pricked at his eyes.

Every fiber of his being screamed at him to charge forward, to tear them apart.

But he remained frozen, watching the scene unfold like a nightmare he couldn't escape.

The fireworks continued to paint the sky, their bursts of light illuminating the couple's embrace in fleeting moments of gold and crimson.

Ethan's hands clenched into fists at his sides.

This wasn't how things were supposed to be.

She was supposed to be his.

###Chapter 234 Confession

The brilliant fireworks display created an invisible barrier, separating Alexander and Evelyn from the bustling crowd. It kept Ethan at a distance, unable to reach them.

His throat tightened. His hands curled into fists, nails digging into his palms.

Just a few yards away, Alexander held Evelyn close, his arms wrapped protectively around her.

Lost in the moment, Alexander cradled her face and kissed her deeply, the golden glow of the fireworks illuminating their silhouettes.

Ethan's vision blurred with rage. The veins in his hands stood out starkly against his skin.

He dropped to his knees, clutching his head as a guttural cry tore from his throat.

But the deafening explosions overhead swallowed his anguish. No one turned. No one noticed.

The more tender Alexander and Evelyn were, the deeper the knife twisted in Ethan's chest.

For a terrifying moment, he thought he might suffocate. The pain was unbearable, crushing him from the inside out.

Every burst of color in the sky felt like another slash across his heart, leaving it raw and bleeding.

Alexander loved Evelyn—that much was undeniable. His gaze never strayed from her, full of devotion.

And that was what destroyed Ethan the most.

A man of Alexander Whitmore's stature investing his precious time and energy in her could only mean one thing—his feelings ran deep.

Ethan Caldwell had never witnessed Alexander show this level of devotion to any woman before.

The fireworks over the ocean blazed for a glorious thirty minutes.

Alexander had spared no expense, ensuring everyone present witnessed the breathtaking spectacle.

At the peak of the display, Evelyn Carter's name suddenly illuminated the night sky, framed by a blazing crimson heart.

This was a declaration.

Classic, perhaps even predictable.

But Evelyn adored it.

No woman could resist romance, and she was no different.

The brilliant explosions transformed into cascading blossoms, painting the heavens in shifting hues of gold and scarlet. They pulsed like living embers, now dazzling, now soft, weaving a dreamscape that stole her breath away.

In Evelyn's eyes, Alexander had always carried himself with icy detachment. Given his decade in law enforcement, she'd assumed words like "romantic" would never apply to him.

Yet here he was, rewriting every expectation.

The crowd gasped as the finale erupted—a shower of silver sparks forming two interlocked rings above them.

Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs.

This wasn't just affection.

This was a promise.

She never expected him to orchestrate such an elaborate fireworks display just for her.

Evelyn's eyes shimmered with the reflection of the bursting colors above, her voice soft with wonder. "This is breathtaking."

Alexander watched her with undisguised tenderness, his arm slipping around her waist. "Do you enjoy it?"

She nodded without hesitation. "More than anything."

His lips curved knowingly. "Do you love the fireworks, Evelyn... or do you love me?"

The question caught her off guard.

Alexander didn't let her look away, his gaze intense beneath the flickering sky. "I thought the meaning would be clear when you saw them. This wasn't just a display."

Evelyn's breath hitched as realization dawned.

Against the backdrop of cascading sparks, his eyes burned brighter than any flame.

"Every single one of these," he murmured, "is for you. To tell you what words never could."

Her pulse stuttered at the raw emotion in his voice.

Alexander cradled her face, his touch devastatingly gentle. "You're my wife. Our beginning wasn't conventional, but that doesn't matter now. I need more than your trust, Evelyn. I need your heart."

The last firework exploded overhead in a shower of gold, illuminating the vulnerability in his expression—a sight reserved only for her.

The golden lights of the tropical resort shimmered around them, casting a dreamlike glow over the private beach.

Alexander’s fingers brushed through Evelyn’s hair, his touch featherlight yet electric.

"Evelyn," he murmured, his voice a velvet caress. "I want to build a life with you—one filled with happiness, passion, and love. Every moment without you feels incomplete."

Her breath hitched.

Was Alexander… confessing to her?

The end of the year had been brutal for Titan Capital Group, with Alexander buried under mountains of work. A trip abroad with Evelyn had seemed impossible.

But he couldn’t ignore the guilt gnawing at him.

They had married in haste, without the grand romance she deserved. He owed her more—a proper courtship, a declaration, a memory worth cherishing.

So he had chosen this paradise as the venue for the company’s annual retreat.

Three days. That was all he could spare.

But every second had been meticulously planned.

The confession he had postponed for too long could wait no longer.

His lips grazed her ear, sending shivers down her spine.

"Evelyn," he whispered, his voice rough with emotion. "Will you love me?"

Her heart stuttered.

The world around them faded, leaving only his piercing gaze and the weight of his question.

###Chapter 235 Ethan's Jealousy

Evelyn was completely taken aback by Alexander's words.

It was astonishing—a man of his caliber, with unmatched brilliance and prestige, would willingly humble himself in matters of the heart.

He wanted her to see him as her lover from now on.

When she met his intense, adoring gaze, an unfamiliar warmth spread through her chest.

Even after marrying Alexander, Evelyn had never truly considered him her husband.

To her, he had always been a powerful ally, a safety net—nothing more. Love had never factored into it.

Alexander must have sensed this. That was why he had orchestrated this grand confession.

Was this his way of courting a woman?

Given his tragic upbringing, he likely had no concept of what love truly meant.

From the moment he was born, the Whitmore family had cast him aside, forcing him to grow up in a dilapidated shack in the countryside.

The thought made her chest tighten.

Yet here he was, baring his heart to her with a vulnerability she had never expected.

Evelyn swallowed hard, her fingers curling into the fabric of her dress.

What was she supposed to say?

How could she respond to something so raw, so unexpected?

Alexander waited, his expression unreadable.

The silence between them stretched, heavy with unspoken emotions.

Then, just as she opened her mouth to speak—

A sharp knock shattered the moment.

Evelyn flinched.

Alexander's jaw tightened, his eyes flashing with irritation.

"Who is it?" he demanded, his voice low and dangerous.

The door swung open.

Ethan Caldwell stood there, his cold gaze flickering between them.

His lips curled into a mocking smile.

"Am I interrupting something?"

Evelyn's breath caught.

Alexander's hand subtly shifted, his fingers brushing against hers in a silent warning.

Ethan's eyes darkened.

The air crackled with tension.

Evelyn knew—this wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the penthouse.

Alexander Whitmore had survived on scraps for years, treated like an afterthought by the very family that should have cherished him.

For over two decades, they had turned their backs on him, as if he were nothing more than a ghost haunting their gilded halls.

Now, with the rest of the Whitmore family proving utterly incompetent, Harold Aniston had come crawling back, desperate for Alexander's return.

The world whispered about how ruthlessly Alexander had seized control of Titan Capital Group in just twelve months.

But no one spoke of the years of suffering that had forged him.

Scars, both old and new, marked his body—each one a testament to battles fought alone.

Evelyn Carter's heart ached at the thought.

Twenty-nine years of hardship.

All he had ever wanted was a family who loved him and a woman who saw him for who he truly was.

Yet, deceit surrounded him at every turn.

Evelyn pressed her cheek against Alexander's chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.

He had given her so much—far more than she could ever repay, even for saving his life that fateful night.

All he asked in return was her love.

How could she deny him something so simple?

Her fingers curled into the fabric of his shirt as she held him tighter.

"Mr. Whitmore," she murmured, her voice soft but certain, "my heart has always been yours to take."

The words hung between them, a promise sealed in the quiet of the evening.

A mischievous grin played on his lips.

The seven years Evelyn had spent with Ethan proved she was a woman of unwavering loyalty.

She just needed time—time to open her heart to love again.

As the fireworks faded, the crowd began to disperse.

Ethan, standing at a distance, looked as if his soul had been ripped from him. His gaze remained locked on Evelyn and Alexander, still wrapped in each other's arms.

He watched as she leaned up, whispering something against Alexander's ear.

The effect was immediate—Alexander visibly tensed, his grip tightening around her waist.

Even from where he stood, Ethan could practically feel the raw, possessive energy radiating off Alexander.

If not for the lingering spectators, he had no doubt Alexander would have done something reckless—just like that night in the car.

A sharp, bitter jealousy clawed at Ethan's chest.

Only now did he truly understand the depth of his own feelings.

He couldn’t stand it.

The way Alexander touched her.

The way she responded.

It was unbearable.

The sight of Evelyn in Alexander's arms sent a wave of conflicting emotions crashing through Ethan. It was as if someone had overturned a spice rack inside him—bitterness, anger, and something far more unsettling.

His chest tightened.

His hands clenched into fists at his sides.

This wasn't just irritation.

This was jealousy.

A sharp, relentless ache twisted inside him, like a blade carving deeper with every second. Evelyn should have been his. She was supposed to be in his arms, not Alexander's.

The thought was unbearable.

Before he could stop himself, he was striding toward them, his pulse roaring in his ears.

###Chapter 236 Are You Certain?

Ethan Caldwell had been played by Vanessa Hart all this time. Now, he was desperate to clear the air with Evelyn.

He had confused Vanessa for the cellist.

But as he stood behind Evelyn and Alexander, Ethan found himself frozen, unable to take that final step forward.

Fear gripped him—no, it was more than fear. It was sheer terror. What would he even say to Evelyn after revealing the truth?

Evelyn was married to Alexander now, and he was bound to Vanessa.

Over the years, he had hurt Evelyn in ways he couldn’t undo.

Even if he stood before her, nothing could be fixed.

Frustration surged through him, and he kicked at the sand beneath his feet, the weight of his helplessness crushing him.

He was the one who had pushed Evelyn away.

He had no one to blame but himself.

Alexander, walking ahead with Evelyn, suddenly turned, his sharp gaze locking onto Ethan’s.

A silent warning flashed in Alexander’s eyes before he leaned in closer to Evelyn, shielding her from view.

Alexander whispered something into Evelyn's ear as he held her close.

Her cheeks instantly flushed crimson, and she hurried away, pressing both hands to her face.

She didn’t notice Ethan trailing not far behind her.

His heart lurched, and he immediately moved to follow—only for Nathan to step directly into his path.

"Uncle Nathan." Ethan’s gaze remained fixed on Evelyn.

The ocean breeze lifted the hem of her sundress, the vibrant fabric dancing like petals in the wind. She was radiant, mesmerizing, and Ethan couldn’t tear his eyes away. It was as if she had stolen his very soul.

Nathan’s expression darkened. He followed Ethan’s line of sight, then deliberately shifted to block his view.

"Do you like what she’s wearing?"

"Yes."

"I bought it for her." Nathan’s voice was smooth, laced with quiet possessiveness. "The moment I married Evelyn, I made it my mission to fill her wardrobe with every beautiful dress imaginable. She’s my wife. Spoiling her is my privilege."

Ethan stiffened. The words struck like a blade, twisting deep in his chest until he could barely breathe.

But pride refused to let his mask slip.

"Step aside."

Nathan let out a low, mocking laugh. "Did you just order me to move? Ethan, you’ve grown bold."

Under normal circumstances, Ethan would never dare challenge him.

Yet tonight, something reckless surged within him.

"Uncle Nathan," he said, lifting his chin, "are you afraid? Is that why you’re keeping me from her? Do you worry she still loves me? That you might lose?"

The night air carried a biting chill.

As the crowd thinned, the beach grew quiet, the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore the only sound. Foam hissed over wet sand, swallowing jagged rocks in its path—a breathtaking, untamed force.

Nathan didn’t flinch. His gaze remained steady, unreadable.

"Lose to you?" His lips curved, but his eyes were ice. "Ethan, you overestimate yourself. You’re nothing but a man my wife walked away from. What makes you think you stand a chance?"

Ethan met his stare head-on. "There’s a misunderstanding between us. Once it’s cleared, she’ll forgive me. We shared seven years, Nathan. Childhood sweethearts. That history doesn’t just vanish."

The tension between them was palpable, thick enough to slice through.

Ethan's smirk faltered as Alexander's cold gaze bore into him.

"We've shared every milestone together," Ethan insisted, his voice laced with arrogance. "The entire city of Cresthaven knows how much Evelyn adores me!"

Alexander's lips curled into a humorless smile, his fingers flexing slightly at his sides.

"Seven years," he mused, his tone deceptively calm. "And yet, you married Vanessa. Tell me, Ethan—do I need to remind you of all the ways you've wronged Evelyn over the years?"

He stepped closer, the weight of his presence pressing down on Ethan like an invisible force.

With deliberate slowness, Alexander placed a hand on Ethan's shoulder, his grip just shy of painful.

"Everyone in Cresthaven knows Evelyn is my wife," he murmured, his voice low and dangerous. "Not long ago, she was the one chasing me relentlessly. She loves you?"

A dark chuckle escaped him as he leaned in, his breath ghosting over Ethan's ear.

"Are you certain?"

The words hung between them, sharp as a blade.

Ethan's confidence wavered, his throat bobbing as he swallowed hard.

Alexander didn’t wait for an answer.

With one last dismissive glance, he turned and walked away, leaving Ethan standing there—his pride crumbling in the wake of undeniable truth.

###Chapter 237 You're Irresistible

Alexander chuckled darkly.

A memory surfaced—how Evelyn had boldly confessed her pursuit of him publicly, all to shield his reputation from whispers that he paled in comparison to Ethan.

Ironically, that very act now became his sharpest weapon against Ethan.

"Ethan, wake up." Alexander's voice dripped with icy amusement. "A decent ex knows when to vanish. Or are you planning to cling to my wife like a pathetic shadow, ethics be damned? Even if you lack dignity, do you really think the Caldwells would tolerate such disgrace?"

Ethan's knuckles whitened, fists trembling.

Every word struck like a blade, leaving him gutted. Speechless.

Alexander wasn’t wrong. The Caldwell name carried weight—scandals like this would never be permitted.

It was over.

Ethan had backed himself into a corner, stripped of any right to challenge Alexander again.

The realization tasted like ash.

Why did Alexander marry Evelyn? How could this possibly happen?

Alexander shot Ethan a piercing look, his eyes like shards of glacial ice.

"Ethan, this is your final warning. Cross me again, and I won't hesitate to destroy you."

The ocean wind cut through the night, sharp and biting.

Ethan felt his breath leave him, as if an unseen force had wrapped around his throat.

He stood frozen on the shore, watching Alexander stride away without a backward glance.

It took him too long to regain his composure.

When he finally moved, his steps were leaden.

Grief and fury twisted inside him.

He despised the ocean.

He vowed never to set foot near the sea again.

That same night, he booked a flight back to Cresthaven.

The Eclipse Lounge swallowed him whole, where he drowned himself in liquor like a hollow shell.

Meanwhile, Alexander returned to the penthouse suite.

The sound of the door stirred Evelyn awake.

She padded toward the entrance in her silk pajamas, rubbing sleep from her eyes.

At the grand entrance, Alexander suddenly pulled Evelyn close, his strong arms encircling her slender waist. Without warning, he captured her lips in a searing kiss that left her breathless.

Her eyes widened in shock.

Alexander deepened the embrace, one hand cradling the back of her head possessively. The intensity in his gaze burned like fire, as if he wanted to merge her very soul with his.

Evelyn's pulse raced. She tilted her head up, searching his face. "Alexander... what's gotten into you?" she whispered, her voice trembling.

A dangerous smile curved his lips as he leaned in closer.

His warm breath ghosted over her ear when he murmured, "You're utterly irresistible tonight, Mrs. Whitmore."

A shiver ran down her spine at his words, her heart fluttering wildly like a trapped bird.

With deliberate slowness, Alexander tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. The tender gesture contrasted sharply with the steel in his voice. "My nephew actually had the audacity to challenge me over you."

Evelyn froze.

Ethan?

So she hadn't imagined it earlier.

On the crowded beach, amidst the dazzling fireworks...

The world around Evelyn Carter blurred as Alexander Whitmore’s voice cut through the haze of her thoughts.

She could hear Ethan Caldwell’s distant cries.

Was he in distress?

Alexander’s hands burned against her skin, trailing down her spine with deliberate slowness, snapping her back to reality.

He turned, pressing his lips to the curve of her neck in a teasing kiss. His voice was rough, laced with possessive amusement. "Mrs. Whitmore, how dare you let your mind wander to another man when I’m right here?"

As if to punish her, his tongue flicked over the sensitive spot beneath her ear, drawing a shudder from her.

Evelyn trembled, overwhelmed by the intensity of his touch.

Cradling her face in his hands, he pressed his forehead to hers, his gaze dark with unspoken demand. "Can’t you tell I’m jealous?" His thumb brushed her lower lip. "Don’t I deserve your full attention?"

###Chapter 238 Alexander’s Call

Evelyn hesitated, her fingers curling slightly in confusion.

After a brief pause, she wrapped her arms around Alexander’s toned waist, rose onto her toes, and pressed a soft kiss to his lips.

He stiffened in surprise. Before he could deepen the contact, she had already pulled away.

Her wide, innocent eyes met his, shimmering with curiosity. "Did that help?"

Alexander’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. He caught Evelyn’s wrist and guided her back against the doorframe.

Closing the distance between them, he caged her in, tilting her chin up with one hand.

She bit her lower lip, her pulse fluttering wildly.

The raw, masculine energy radiating from Alexander sent her heart into a frenzy, pounding so hard she feared it might escape her chest.

"That was a good start," he murmured, his voice rough with desire. "But you can do better."

The moment his mouth claimed hers, Evelyn was lost.

He took her right there—against the door, on the sofa, in the—

The moon cast silver reflections across the ocean waves outside the floor-to-ceiling window.

Sleep was impossible tonight.

Alexander's possessive energy knew no bounds.

Evelyn had just stepped out of the shower, yet within hours she was drenched again as if she'd never left the steaming water.

Their final night at the coastal resort burned into her memory.

Alexander took her relentlessly, moving between the bed, the balcony, and finally the marble bathroom counter until dawn's first light painted the horizon.

On the private jet returning to Cresthaven, Evelyn slept like the dead.

Alexander watched her peaceful expression with undisguised adoration. He signaled the flight attendant for a cashmere blanket and carefully tucked it around her shoulders.

Vanessa sat several rows back, her manicured nails digging into the armrests.

Ethan hadn't returned to their suite last night. When his phone went straight to voicemail, she'd discovered he'd chartered a helicopter back to the city at midnight.

With nothing keeping her at the resort, Vanessa had booked the first available flight.

Her blood ran cold when she recognized Alexander's distinctive profile boarding the same aircraft.

Vanessa couldn't stand watching Alexander fuss over Evelyn like that!

Ethan had abandoned her without a second thought. How could the woman he'd married so casually now become her elder? It made her blood boil.

The injustice burned in Vanessa's chest. Why did Evelyn always get everything? Why did everyone's attention gravitate toward her?

First Richard kept pressuring her to transfer the ancestral home to Evelyn. Now even Ethan barely glanced her way.

This was unacceptable!

Alexander had returned to Cresthaven ahead of schedule for a crucial client meeting. The moment they landed, he'd rushed off to his appointment.

Their driver dropped Evelyn at Willowbrook Apartments. She'd barely settled in when her phone vibrated with an incoming call.

"Evelyn, you're back from your trip?" Richard's voice carried forced cheerfulness. "The paperwork for Hawthorne Estate is ready. When can you come sign the transfer documents?"

Evelyn's lips twisted into a bitter smile.

How ironic. When she'd begged for what was rightfully hers, he'd refused. Now that she'd stopped caring, he couldn't wait to hand it over.

The phone grew heavy in her hand as Richard continued listing the documents she needed to review. Each word dripped with the desperation of a man who'd realized too late which daughter actually mattered.

Outside her window, twilight painted the city in hues of violet and gold. The same colors that once reminded her of hope now only emphasized how much had changed.

She interrupted his rambling. "I'll think about it."

The stunned silence on the other end was more satisfying than any agreement could ever be.

Let him wait.

After everything, he deserved to taste uncertainty for once.

The offer meant nothing to me now. He was trying to buy my compliance with empty gestures.

Vanessa's voice was icy. "I only wanted the ancestral home because I was a Hayes. But I'm not part of this family anymore. Keep it for yourself."

"Don't be ridiculous!" Richard's voice cracked with desperation. "You will always be my daughter. How can you say you're not a Hayes? Evelyn, enough of this stubbornness. Must I beg you?"

At his age, he shouldn’t have been groveling to a woman half his years.

Yet here he was, swallowing his pride, pleading with me as if I held his fate in my hands.

"Your mother misses you," he added softly, a calculated move. "She hasn’t stopped talking about you."

Horizon Enterprises was crumbling.

The end of the year should have been their most profitable season. Instead, their sales had plummeted to a ten-year low.

The shareholders were restless, their dissatisfaction a noose tightening around Richard’s neck.

If this continued, Horizon wouldn’t survive the new year.

The market was ruthless.

And so was I.

Alexander executed everything with precision, leaving no evidence behind.

Yet Richard knew.

The anomalies this year—they all pointed back to him.

There was no doubt in Richard’s mind.

The timing, the patterns, the subtle disruptions—they all bore Alexander’s signature.

Too calculated.

Too deliberate.

Richard picked up his phone, his grip tightening.

He needed answers.

And he would get them—one way or another.

The call connected after two rings.

Alexander’s voice was smooth, controlled.

"Richard. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

Richard didn’t waste time.

"Cut the pleasantries. We need to talk."

A pause.

Then, amusement laced Alexander’s tone.

"About?"

Richard’s jaw clenched.

"You know exactly what."

Silence stretched between them.

Then Alexander exhaled, the sound almost weary.

"Fine. But not over the phone."

Richard’s lips thinned.

"Name the place."

Alexander’s answer came without hesitation.

"Eclipse Lounge. Midnight."

Richard ended the call.

Midnight.

Where secrets thrived.

And truths unraveled.

He would be there.

And this time, Alexander wouldn’t walk away without giving him the answers he demanded.
###Chapter 239 Gifts

Though Evelyn didn't know the full story, she could guess why Richard was suddenly being so attentive. It was probably because of the pressure Alexander had put on him.

His voice was soft, almost ingratiating.

"Did you get all the presents I sent? I had no idea you were such a talented cellist."

Last night, Evelyn had stunned everyone at the annual gala with her cello performance.

Richard had watched the livestream, and now the entire internet was buzzing about the mysterious musician.

He had even commissioned an edited clip of her performance and posted it on Instagram with a caption:

[My daughter is a gifted cellist. All the years of dedication from her mother and me have finally borne fruit.]

When Richard woke up this morning, he was shocked to see over 300 likes and comments flooding his post. Reading through the praise made his chest swell with pride.

Even an old classmate—someone he hadn’t spoken to in years—had reached out.

This classmate was a legend in elite circles.

He only performed for the most powerful figures in Cresthaven. His concerts were strictly invitation-only, reserved for heads of state and royalty. Tickets were never sold to the public.

Yet, he had personally contacted Richard, expressing interest in taking Evelyn under his wing as his protégé.

Richard was so thrilled he agreed on the spot.

If he could secure a connection with this man, it would mean gaining entry into the highest echelons of Cresthaven’s elite—a world most people could only dream of.

Richard was just a businessman. This was his golden ticket.

So, he called Evelyn to discuss it.

When he mentioned the gifts, she glanced at the stack of boxes at her feet—delivered by the security guard when she arrived. She hadn’t had time to open them yet.

She hadn’t ordered anything recently and assumed they were from Alexander.

To her surprise, they were from Richard.

Evelyn picked one at random and opened it.

Her breath caught.

Inside was a limited-edition designer bag worth over three million dollars—fresh from the latest collection.

The sleek black box sat on my desk, its designer logo gleaming under the office lights. Richard had clearly splurged this time—this limited edition piece from the luxury brand probably cost a fortune.

I tapped my fingers against the mahogany surface, eyeing the other unopened packages scattered around. "Let me guess," I said into the phone, my voice dripping with sarcasm. "You want to see me? Or is this another attempt to butter up Alexander?"

Silence. Then, a cough.

Richard Hayes, ever the smooth talker, recovered quickly. "Evelyn, darling, you wound me. You’re my precious daughter. Alexander is just your husband—he doesn’t compare."

I smirked, swiveling in my chair. "Oh? That’s interesting. I just recorded that. Should I forward it to him?"

Another pause. I could practically hear him grinding his teeth.

But Richard, ever the actor, sighed dramatically. "Go ahead. My conscience is clear. You’ll always be my priority."

I rolled my eyes and ended the call without another word.

The remaining gifts were just as extravagant—diamond necklaces, platinum bracelets, all from collections that screamed exclusive. A quick mental tally put the total well over thirty million.

Typical Richard.

Years of blatant favoritism, and now? A sudden flood of expensive apologies.

I leaned back, arms crossed.

As if money could fix everything.

Vanessa had been showering her with countless extravagant presents behind the scenes.

She was his biological daughter, yet why did Evelyn receive nothing?

So Evelyn accepted them all without hesitation.

This was merely the compensation she was owed.

Later, Evelyn messaged Richard on WhatsApp.

The moment she abruptly ended the call, she could practically hear his teeth grinding in frustration on the other end.

4/5

When he noticed her message, his irritation instantly melted into delight, and he responded eagerly.

[Evelyn, are you coming home for dinner? Your mother is preparing your favorite filet mignons. We’re all waiting for you.]

Evelyn despised filet mignon—Vanessa was the one who loved it.

But instead of calling him out, she sent him a link.

Richard replied: [What’s this?]

[A cello bow. I’ve been short on funds lately. Don’t you enjoy spoiling me? Buy it.]

Richard clicked the link—and his jaw dropped.

###Chapter 240 A Night of Extravagance

Richard Hayes stared at his phone screen in disbelief.

What kind of violin bow costs fifty million?

This has to be a scam.

There’s no way it’s worth that much.

Yet he didn’t reject the request outright. Instead, he hesitated before typing back:

[Evelyn, are you absolutely certain about this? Isn’t this bow used?]

Her reply came swiftly.

[You don’t get it. Used bows are better—they’re already broken in.]

Richard scoffed under his breath.

Bullshit. She thinks I don’t know anything about instruments and is trying to play me.

Before he could respond, another message popped up.

[You’re not backing out because of the price, are you?]

His fingers froze.

She had seen right through him.

For days, Evelyn had barely acknowledged him. Now that she was finally engaging, he couldn’t afford to ruin this chance to win her favor.

His fingers flew across the screen as he dialed his financial advisor. "Purchase this immediately from my personal account."

The advisor clicked the link, hesitation lacing his voice. "Mr. Hayes, are you certain this isn't a scam? Fraudsters these days are sophisticated—they often target high-net-worth individuals."

Richard's patience was razor-thin. Fifty million wasn't pocket change, and every second wasted risked losing what Evelyn desired.

"This is for my daughter. Just complete the transaction. No more questions."

A tense silence followed before the advisor spoke again. "Sir, your personal account doesn't have sufficient funds for this amount..."

"Then use Vanessa's account."

This year's dividends had just been deposited into Vanessa's account. Knowing his stepdaughter, she likely hadn't even checked the balance yet.

Minutes later, Evelyn's phone chimed. The notification flashed—$50,000,000.00 received. A slow, satisfied smile curved her lips.

Almost instantly, Richard's message appeared:

[Evelyn, the bow is yours. Come home. Dinner is waiting.]

The screen darkened, reflecting her triumphant gaze.

Nathan waited impatiently, his fingers tapping against his phone screen. When Evelyn still didn’t respond, he sent another message: [Evelyn?]

A red exclamation mark flashed mockingly on his screen.

Evelyn had taken the money and blocked him without hesitation.

Nathan’s temper flared. He kicked the nearest chair, sending it skidding across the floor with a loud scrape.

Meanwhile, Alexander returned home late, well past ten, after wrapping up a business dinner with a client.

The moment he stepped inside, the scent of whiskey clung to him as he pulled Evelyn into his arms.

Before she could protest, his lips found the sensitive curve of her neck, his touch rough with intoxication.

Evelyn shivered, her body instinctively curling inward.

That night, Alexander was relentless.

Drunk and unrestrained, he was more demanding than usual, his hands possessive, his movements primal.

He showed no sign of fatigue, as if fueled by some unquenchable fire.

By the time he finally stilled, Evelyn’s legs trembled uncontrollably.

Exhaustion dragged her into a deep sleep, and she didn’t wake until well past nine the next morning.

Evelyn was late.

Alexander had already left at dawn, and Evelyn cursed under her breath as she kicked off the tangled sheets.

"That man always slips out without waking me."

Though Titan Capital Group had flexible policies, punctuality still affected bonuses.

She wouldn’t put it past Alexander to sabotage her attendance just to pinch pennies.

"Unbelievable."

The moment her feet touched the floor, a sharp gasp escaped her lips.

Days of reckless passion had left her muscles weak, her legs trembling like leaves in the wind.

Yet Alexander? He strode out every morning like a man reborn, vitality practically radiating off him.

It made no sense.

He was the one doing all the work. He should be the exhausted one.

But no—somehow, she was the one left wrecked.

After a quick shower and a fresh outfit, Evelyn rushed to the office. The moment she stepped in, the president’s office staff turned—

The air grew thick with tension as they closed in around her.

Vanessa Hart stood at the center, her lips curling into a smirk that didn’t quite reach her cold, calculating eyes.

Evelyn Carter felt the weight of their stares—some curious, some mocking, others outright hostile.

She lifted her chin, refusing to let them see her unease.

Nathan Reeves shifted uncomfortably beside her, his usually composed demeanor slipping for just a second.

"You really thought you could just walk back in here like nothing happened?" Vanessa drawled, twirling a strand of her perfectly styled hair.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists at her sides.

Alexander Whitmore’s absence was a gaping wound in the room, his protective presence sorely missed.

Grace Caldwell let out a soft, derisive laugh from the corner, her arms crossed.

"Honestly, Evelyn," she said, voice dripping with false sweetness, "you always did have a flair for the dramatic."

The crowd murmured, their whispers sharp as knives.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, forcing her voice steady.

"If you have something to say, say it to my face."

Vanessa’s smirk widened.

"Oh, we will."

The threat hung in the air, heavy and suffocating.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened, but she didn’t back down.

Not this time.

Not ever again.
###Chapter 241 Don't Tempt Me

Evelyn hesitated.

If I admit that Alexander is my husband and confess he orchestrated those beach fireworks, wouldn't that shatter his carefully cultivated image?

Alexander had always been perceived as stoic, unyielding—not the type for grand romantic gestures.

Just then, Victoria Sloan emerged from Alexander’s office, arms laden with files.

"Enough gossip," she announced coolly. "Back to work unless you want your bonuses revoked."

Natalie and Cassandra scattered instantly.

Victoria’s sharp gaze landed on Daniel. "Mr. Pierce, control your team. The president’s office values discretion. We can’t have attention-seekers disrupting our professionalism."

Daniel’s jaw tightened. The insinuation was obvious—and aimed squarely at Evelyn.

He shot Evelyn a reassuring glance before countering, "Attention-seeking? From what I heard, everyone adored the fireworks that night. Hardly a crime."

Victoria smirked. "Funny, though. Evelyn was with Mr. Caldwell that evening. A married man. Her persistence around him… well, we can all guess her motives."

Her words weren’t baseless.

The air thickened with tension.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into her palms.

This isn’t over.

Someone had snapped pictures of Evelyn and Alexander together that evening and anonymously sent them to Victoria's phone.

Victoria immediately jumped to conclusions - she was convinced Evelyn was playing games, stringing along some wealthy admirer while secretly involved with married Alexander.

Evelyn nearly choked on her coffee when she heard the rumors. "So now I'm the other woman?" she muttered under her breath.

She'd kept her relationship with Alexander private primarily to avoid workplace bias, never imagining it would backfire like this.

Just then, Alexander and Simon emerged from the executive office.

The lively office chatter died instantly.

Simon carried a sleek laptop case and leather portfolio, clearly preparing to accompany Alexander to an important client meeting.

Nobody dared gossip within earshot of Alexander Whitmore - not even bold Victoria.

When Evelyn's eyes met Alexander's, her gaze involuntarily dropped to his neck, heat rising in her cheeks.

Last night had been... intense. Alexander had lost all restraint, begging her to leave marks during their most intimate moment.

She'd refused, of course. But that only made Alexander more creative in his persuasion techniques.

The memory alone made her pulse quicken.

Simon cleared his throat pointedly, breaking the tension. "The car's waiting downstairs, sir."

Alexander's lips quirked in that infuriatingly knowing smile as he adjusted his tie, deliberately drawing attention to the faint love bite peeking above his collar.

Evelyn's face burned hotter. That arrogant, impossible man.

Victoria's eyes darted between them, suspicion darkening her expression.

This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.

She was pushed beyond her limits.

As Alexander claimed her completely, Evelyn raked her nails down his back and sank her teeth into the base of his throat.

The mark stood out vividly. Even with Alexander's high-collared shirt, half of it remained visible.

When his dark gaze locked onto hers, Evelyn realized he'd caught her staring.

The others kept their heads bowed awkwardly, too intimidated to meet Alexander's eyes. None noticed the charged tension between them.

Amusement glinted in Alexander's eyes as Evelyn's phone buzzed.

Alexander: [Mrs. Whitmore, if you're feeling neglected, you need only say so. No need to tempt me with that look—I might not be able to control myself.]

Evelyn fought back both exasperation and laughter.

###Chapter 242 The Truth Unveiled

Evelyn couldn't help but roll her eyes internally. When had she ever stared at him so shamelessly? Alexander had a talent for distorting reality. His employees probably never imagined their composed CEO could be so... playful behind closed doors.

The moment Alexander left, Victoria was about to resume their earlier conversation when Simon reappeared.

Victoria blinked in surprise. "Mr. Graves? Did you forget something?"

Simon barely spared her a glance, his expression unreadable.

Instead, he strode straight to Evelyn’s desk and set down a small, elegant box.

"Mrs. Whitmore," he said smoothly, "Mr. Whitmore thought you might have skipped breakfast. He asked me to deliver this."

Inside was Evelyn’s favorite—creamy, delicate cheese pudding, the same kind she used to savor every morning during her time at Horizon Enterprises.

Alexander had remembered.

The office fell into stunned silence.

Victoria’s jaw dropped. "Mr. Graves, did you just call her—?"

"She's Mr. Whitmore's wife—you didn't know?"

Simon Graves feigned shock, his eyes widening dramatically as he turned to Evelyn. "Mrs. Whitmore, you've been keeping this a secret! Why haven't you told anyone?"

Evelyn nearly rolled her eyes. If Simon ever quit his job, he could easily win an Oscar with that performance.

She knew exactly what was happening.

Alexander had orchestrated this.

He must have overheard Victoria Sloan spreading rumors about her being a mistress.

This was his way of setting the record straight—publicly declaring her as his wife, silencing the whispers once and for all.

The realization sent warmth flooding through her chest, like sunlight breaking through winter clouds.

The moment Simon left, the office erupted.

"Evelyn, you're married to Alexander Whitmore? Why didn’t you say anything?"

"So that’s why there were fireworks over Titan Capital that night—they were for you?"

The questions came rapid-fire, but Evelyn only smiled, her fingers brushing against the wedding band she usually kept hidden.

Alexander had just made sure the world knew exactly who she was.

And she loved him all the more for it.

Natalie pressed her hands to her flushed cheeks, gazing at Evelyn with undisguised envy. "Goodness, is Mr. Whitmore really that romantic? He set off a fireworks display just to confess to you in public?"

The revelation sent shockwaves through the room.

Alexander Whitmore had always been the epitome of professionalism—reserved, composed, and almost untouchable at Titan Capital Group.

Yet here he was, orchestrating a grand romantic gesture for his wife.

The collective thought among the employees was clear: So Mr. Whitmore is utterly smitten with Evelyn?

Cassandra practically vibrated with excitement. "Wait, so it worked? He just agreed to your pursuit like that? You kissed him in front of everyone, and then he married you?"

Evelyn’s bold pursuit of Alexander had been the talk of the office for weeks. The moment she’d kissed him had sparked endless gossip, with many speculating that the elusive "Mrs. Whitmore" would eventually confront her.

Instead, they were all staring at the woman who was Mrs. Whitmore.

"So, was that kiss the turning point?" Victoria asked, leaning forward.

"Was he ignoring you on purpose before? Had you two already secretly tied the knot?"

Evelyn wasn’t surprised by their stunned reactions.

She had, after all, just rewritten the entire office’s understanding of Alexander Whitmore.

What troubled Evelyn most now was whether exposing her true identity would jeopardize her future at Titan Capital Group.

Natalie smirked knowingly. "No wonder Mr. Whitmore always requests your coffee..." Her voice dripped with playful accusation. "Those 'coffee deliveries' take suspiciously long. Should we be concerned about what really happens in his office?"

The teasing glint in Natalie's eyes made Evelyn's cheeks burn.

She opened her mouth to protest, but the elevator dinged—saving her from further interrogation.

Yet as the doors slid open, Evelyn realized the real challenge wasn't Natalie's gossip. It was the storm about to hit when Alexander's entire world discovered who she truly was.

###Chapter 243 Be Nobody

The office hummed with whispered excitement as Natalie leaned in closer, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "So tell us, Evelyn," she purred, "was Mr. Whitmore as incredible in bed as he looks? Ten years of military training must have given him quite the stamina."

Cassandra gasped dramatically before bursting into giggles, clutching Natalie's arm. "Oh my God, I knew it!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, heat creeping up her neck.

Across the room, Daniel took a slow sip of his coffee. The conversation was veering into dangerous territory. Clearing his throat, he stood abruptly. "I think I'll... give you ladies some privacy."

The moment the door clicked shut, Natalie pounced. "That bite mark on his throat—that was you, wasn't it?" She fanned herself. "Damn, girl, you marked him?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched toward her collar. She hadn't realized the evidence of last night's... enthusiasm was so visible.

Only Victoria remained silent, her manicured nails tapping against her desk. She hadn't forgiven Evelyn for outshining her since joining Titan Capital. The memory of her sneering "Community college, really?" still stung.

Now, watching the others fawn, Victoria's smile was razor-thin.

Evelyn Carter had now become the lady of Titan Capital Group.

Victoria Sloan could hardly believe her eyes.

"Did Evelyn actually win Alexander Whitmore's heart?
What could possibly make a man like him fall for her?
Or is there more to her than meets the eye?"

The truth revealed itself soon enough.

That afternoon, a courier arrived with an unexpected delivery—a property deed.
It was hand-delivered by the chairman's assistant from Horizon Enterprises, who addressed Evelyn with utmost respect as "Lady Carter."

The office buzzed with the revelation.
Evelyn wasn't just an ordinary employee anymore.
She was a Hart heiress, a fact that sent shockwaves through Titan Capital.

By sunset, whispers of Evelyn being Alexander's wife had spread like wildfire.

Just yesterday, she had been an unremarkable assistant in the executive office.
Now, even a simple trip to the restroom drew attention.

"Mrs. Whitmore," a colleague asked hesitantly near the sinks, "would you like me to fetch you some hand towels?"

The marble counters reflected Evelyn's faint smile as she declined politely.
Every interaction now carried weight she hadn't anticipated.

Across the glass partitions, Victoria watched the exchange with narrowed eyes.
Her manicured fingers tightened around her coffee cup.
The game had changed, and she needed to understand the new rules.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's phone buzzed with Alexander's distinctive ringtone.
The screen flashed with a preview of his message:
"Dinner at eight. Wear the emerald necklace."

Her reflection in the darkening office windows showed the subtle transformation.
No longer invisible.
No longer just Evelyn.

Now, she was Alexander Whitmore's wife.

This situation left Evelyn deeply unsettled.

She never expected Alexander to send his assistant to deliver the deed.

When she checked, she discovered the transfer had already been finalized—no signatures required, no paperwork left undone. The Hawthorne Estate now belonged solely to her.

Evelyn could practically hear Vanessa’s furious muttering from miles away.

But even if Vanessa seethed with resentment, there was nothing she could do.

The Hayes family legacy had never been hers to claim in the first place. Evelyn was simply reclaiming what was rightfully hers.

At the end of the workday, Evelyn deliberately waited until the office emptied before leaving.

The moment she stepped into Titan Capital Group’s lobby, the receptionist called out to her.

"Ms. Carter? Someone’s here to see you."

"Me? Who?"

"She’s waiting in the stairwell."

Evelyn walked over and found Vanessa standing there, her eyes red and puffy from crying.

"Evelyn," Vanessa spat, voice trembling. "Are you happy now? Watching me become nothing?"

"We were sisters for over a decade. Is this how you repay me?"

Vanessa's voice trembled with barely contained fury as she stood in Evelyn's office, her manicured nails digging into her palms. The scent of expensive perfume mixed with the sharp tang of betrayal in the air.

Evelyn remained composed, her gaze steady. She had anticipated this confrontation ever since the property transfer documents were signed.

What she hadn't expected was Vanessa's audacity to storm into Titan Capital Group during business hours.

"Grandfather William made his wishes clear before he passed," Evelyn said coolly, leaning back in her leather chair. "Hawthorne Estate was to be divided equally between Oliver and me. You were never part of that equation."

She watched as Vanessa's carefully constructed mask cracked, revealing the raw hurt beneath. "You lived there out of courtesy, Vanessa. Not because it was ever yours."

Vanessa's crimson lips twisted. "You think this is about the house?"

Her hands slammed onto the polished mahogany desk, sending a paperweight skittering. "Ethan hasn't come home in four days! Not since you transferred those shares!"

The unspoken accusation hung between them like a guillotine blade.

Evelyn's fingers stilled on the contract she'd been reviewing. So that was the real issue. Not the property. Not the inheritance.

Him.

Always him.

Vanessa's chest heaved, her designer blouse straining with each ragged breath. "He won't answer my calls. Won't respond to texts. It's like I never existed!"

The office windows reflected the storm brewing in Vanessa's kohl-rimmed eyes - the same tempest that had destroyed their sisterhood years ago.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, pushing the legal documents aside. "Then perhaps," she said with deliberate calm, "you should ask yourself why the man you stole from me can't stand to be in the same room with you."

The words landed like a slap.

Vanessa recoiled, her perfectly highlighted hair catching the afternoon light as she stumbled back. For the first time since bursting in, she looked less like the victorious other woman and more like the insecure girl Evelyn remembered.

Somewhere in the building, an elevator dinged.

Footsteps approached down the marble corridor.

Evelyn didn't need to look at her Rolex to know who would be walking through that door. The universe had impeccable timing when it came to twisting the knife.

Vanessa must have sensed it too. Her head whipped toward the entrance, hope and dread warring in her expression.

The door handle turned.

###Chapter 244 The Desperation Play

Vanessa dialed Ethan's number repeatedly, but each attempt ended the same way—three hollow rings before cutting to voicemail. Her fingers trembled against the screen.

By noon, his phone had gone completely dead.

She had rushed to Horizon Enterprises earlier, only to be told he hadn’t shown up for work.

Desperate, she reached out to his usual circle—Sebastian, Ryan, even Vincent. None of them had seen him.

It was clear now. Ethan was ghosting her.

A cold dread slithered down her spine. In all their years together, he had never shut her out like this. Even after their worst fights, a single apology from her would smooth things over.

But not this time.

The cello incident had changed everything.

Tears blurred her vision as she clutched Evelyn’s sleeve. "You’ve got Alexander now. Just—just give Ethan back to me, okay?"

Evelyn blinked, bewildered. "Since when did I ever—"

Vanessa’s breath hitched. The words tasted like ash. She had played the pity card too many times.

This time, it might not work.

"From you? Don't be ridiculous!"

"I married Alexander. Competing with you over a man—are you out of your mind?"

"Let me guess. You and Ethan had a fight, and now he's done with you, isn't that right? Serves you right."

"Your whole relationship was built on lies. Now that the truth is out, you're facing the consequences."

"Vanessa, this is called karma. You brought this on yourself."

Tears streamed down Vanessa’s face, her complexion turning ghostly pale, the picture of misery.

"Why did you have to come back from prison? Why did you return home? If it weren’t for you, I’d still be the only daughter, and Ethan would still be mine."

Evelyn met her gaze with a cold, mocking smile. "You’re just an adopted stray. The only reason you’re still here is because of my parents’ kindness. Vanessa, did you really start believing you were special after stealing my place for all these years?"

A storm of emotions flickered in Vanessa’s eyes.

As an adopted daughter, she was never truly accepted as part of the elite family in the eyes of society.

Eleanor had always despised Evelyn for her questionable background.

Vanessa felt trapped, as if she'd stumbled into a maze with no exit.

Just as she opened her mouth to speak, she spotted Ethan stepping out of his car and striding toward them.

A sudden realization struck Vanessa. There’s one way to turn this around—to shatter this suffocating stalemate.

"Evelyn, Ethan is mine. Mom and Dad’s love belongs to me. Did you really think you’d won? No. I won’t let you steal what’s rightfully mine."

Before Evelyn could process the venom in Vanessa’s words, her stepsister suddenly screamed—

"Evelyn, even if you hate me, please don’t—AH!"

Vanessa’s body lurched backward, tumbling down the stone steps in a dramatic spiral.

Evelyn froze.

She’d known Vanessa was ruthless, but this? Hurting herself?

Then she saw Ethan rushing forward—and understood.

The same old game.

The same twisted performance.

Three years had passed since Vanessa Hart's elaborate scheme.

She had orchestrated her own assault back then, hiring thugs to attack herself just to frame Evelyn Carter. The cruel plot successfully turned Ethan Caldwell and the entire Hart family against Evelyn.

But this time was different.

Vanessa didn't need outside help to stage her latest performance. She was determined to trap Evelyn in another inescapable situation.

Last time, her scheme sent Evelyn straight to prison.

Ethan happened to be standing behind a marble pillar, his view partially obstructed.

A cold smile played on Evelyn's lips as realization dawned. "If she can play the victim, so can I."

Evelyn despised being the center of public scorn - that familiar feeling of standing alone against accusing fingers and judgmental whispers.

Drawing a sharp breath, Evelyn deliberately stepped forward. With calculated precision, she "lost" her footing at the exact moment Vanessa tumbled.

Their bodies collided as they both went crashing down the grand staircase.

"Now we'll both be victims," Evelyn thought as the world spun around her. "Her little act won't work this time."

###Chapter 245 Unconscious Evelyn

Ethan was wasted.

Completely and utterly smashed.

For days, he had been drowning himself in liquor at the Eclipse Lounge, not caring about anything or anyone.

It was a reckless way to live, but he didn’t care.

When he drank enough, his mind went blissfully blank. No thoughts. No pain. Just the sweet escape of closing his eyes and drifting away.

Alcohol was the only thing that dulled the ache. Without it, his mind would torture him with memories—every laugh, every touch, every moment he had shared with Evelyn.

Not long ago, he had watched Lucas Bennett stumbling drunk at the bar and pitied him.

Now, he was no better.

He arrived at Titan Capital Group for a business meeting.

The moment he stepped out of the car, two sharp thuds echoed through the air.

The sound came from the stairwell. Then, a panicked voice called out—

"Evelyn!"

His blood ran cold.

Evelyn was here?

The sound of rustling fabric and faint breathing led Ethan Caldwell straight to them.

His steps quickened as he turned the corner, his heart pounding against his ribs.

There they were—two women collapsed on the cold pavement, unmoving.

Nathan Reeves' face darkened. "They're unconscious."

Ethan didn't hesitate.

He scooped Evelyn Carter into his arms, his fingers tightening instinctively around her slender frame.

"Get her to the hospital. Now."

Though the alcohol still blurred his senses, his hold on Evelyn was unshakable.

She felt weightless, as if she might vanish if he loosened his grip even slightly.

It had been years since he'd held her this close.

Nathan frowned, glancing at Vanessa Hart still sprawled on the ground.

After a tense pause, he cleared his throat. "Mr. Caldwell, Vanessa is your wife."

Ethan stiffened, his gaze flickering toward Vanessa.

His fingers twitched.

His jaw clenched.

In that moment, he had forgotten her entirely—hadn't even spared her a second thought.

Nathan crouched down, gesturing for Ethan to transfer Evelyn to him.

The night air grew heavier with unspoken tension.

Ethan Caldwell gazed down at Evelyn Carter, his expression a mix of tenderness and wariness as he carefully transferred her into someone else's arms.

Evelyn stirred awake to find sunlight streaming through the hospital window—it was already nine in the morning.

She had planned everything meticulously, shadowing Vanessa Hart's every move before their tumble down the stairs.

Vanessa had ended up cushioning Evelyn's fall, leaving Evelyn completely unharmed.

Her faint had been deliberate—the moment she saw Vanessa collapse, she had forced her own eyes shut, feigning unconsciousness.

Evelyn had been acutely aware when Ethan scooped her up.

His touch made her skin crawl, but she had no choice but to play dead, her body limp in his arms.

Thankfully, within seconds, Nathan Reeves had taken her from him.

The rhythmic motion of the car had lulled her into a genuine slumber, exhaustion from the previous night finally claiming her.

When she opened her eyes again, she found a small crowd gathered around her hospital bed—all watching her with red-rimmed eyes.

The sight shocked Evelyn to her core. For a terrifying moment, she believed she might be standing at death's door, with this solemn gathering assembled to pay their final respects.

Her fingers flew to her face instinctively, pinching the soft skin of her cheek. The sharp pain confirmed she was very much alive, sending a wave of relief through her entire body.

Claire was the first face she recognized.

Dark smudges marred the delicate skin beneath Claire's eyes, telling Evelyn her best friend had likely spent most of the night keeping vigil at her bedside.

A pang of guilt twisted in Evelyn's stomach.

She wondered silently, "If I confess that I'm completely fine and my fainting spell was just an act, would Claire try to strangle me with her bare hands?"

After all, everyone knew Claire treated her nightly skincare ritual with religious devotion, never sacrificing it for anything - not even her best friend's fake medical emergency.

The thought made Evelyn suppress a nervous giggle.
###Chapter 246 The Poisonous Scheme

"Thank goodness! You're finally awake." Claire gasped in relief when Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open, immediately pulling her into a tight embrace.

The doctors had run countless tests but remained baffled by Evelyn's prolonged unconsciousness. No physical trauma explained it—just an unnatural, stubborn sleep that terrified them all.

Vanessa, who had tumbled down the stairs with Evelyn, had regained consciousness hours earlier.

"It was Vanessa, wasn't it?" Claire squeezed Evelyn's hand, her voice trembling with fury. "That viper had the audacity to claim you pushed her."

Evelyn's gaze drifted past Claire, landing on Richard and Margaret standing near the doorway.

Of course they're here. Her lips pressed into a thin line. They probably came to check on their precious Vanessa and decided to stop by since Alexander is present. Another opportunity to curry favor.

Just then, the door creaked open. Ethan strode in with Vanessa clinging to his arm like a possessive vine.

Claire whirled around, her face flushing crimson. "How dare you show your faces here? Vanessa, nobody believes your lies!"

"Believe what you want, Claire," Vanessa sniffed, dabbing fake tears. "But the truth is—"

Evelyn's fingers dug into the sheets. The real battle was just beginning.

Vanessa's tearful voice trembled as she spoke. "She pushed me."

Claire's eyes flashed with fury. "Is that so? If Evelyn pushed you, then how did she end up falling down the stairs with you?"

Vanessa bit her lower lip, her mind scrambling for an excuse.

Her plan had been flawless—or so she thought.

She would pretend Evelyn had shoved her, and when she woke up, she'd insist her stepsister was to blame.

Once they see my injuries, they'll pity me. No one would doubt a victim's word.

Even if Alexander still favored Evelyn, the evidence would be undeniable.

As the head of the household, he couldn't ignore the truth.

Evelyn would be forced to take responsibility.

Her parents would shower her with love again.

Ethan would dote on her as he once did.

And Evelyn? She'd be branded the villain—just like before.

Three years ago, they all turned against her. History will repeat itself.

But when Vanessa regained consciousness, reality shattered her carefully laid scheme.

Evelyn had fallen with her.

When Vanessa woke yesterday, Ethan was already by her side—

Ethan stood by her hospital bed, his expression unreadable.

"What happened?" His voice was sharp, cutting through the sterile silence of the room.

Vanessa clutched the sheets, her fingers trembling. "It was Evelyn. She pushed me."

But Ethan's gaze darkened with skepticism. His jaw tightened as he studied her.

"Really?" His tone was icy, demanding. "I want the truth."

"I am telling the truth!" Vanessa insisted, desperation creeping into her voice. She hadn’t expected this—not after everything. Not after she was the one lying injured.

Yet Ethan remained unmoved.

"You claim Evelyn pushed you," he said slowly, "but then why did she fall too?"

Vanessa froze.

She didn’t know.

The moment she’d tumbled down the stairs, her head had struck the edge, and darkness had swallowed her whole. She had no memory of what happened after.

The silence stretched between them.

And with each passing second, Ethan’s suspicion deepened.

"Vanessa," he said, his voice heavy with disappointment, "are you lying to me?"

Her chest tightened.

"I don’t know how Evelyn fell," she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. "But I swear—she’s the one who pushed me."

The bandages around her head felt suffocating.

And Ethan’s doubt?

Even worse.

My thoughts were clouded, swirling in confusion.

Vanessa's words echoed in my mind, sharp as broken glass.

"I did lie before," she admitted, her voice trembling with false sincerity. "But you can't dismiss everything I say just because of one mistake."

Her eyes glistened with calculated tears as she continued, "What if... what if after pushing me, Evelyn panicked? What if she threw herself down those stairs to make it look like an accident?"

The accusation hung heavy in the air, poisonous and deliberate.

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms.

Vanessa had always been skilled at twisting the truth, but this was a new low.

The memory of Evelyn's pale face, the way she had collapsed at the bottom of the staircase—it still haunted me.

But now, Vanessa was weaving a new narrative, one where Evelyn was the villain.

My pulse pounded in my ears.

If I let her manipulate this situation, everything would unravel.

I had to find the truth before it was too late.

The game had changed.

And this time, I wouldn’t let Vanessa win.

###Chapter 247 Assault from Claire

Vanessa's cheek bore angry red scratches. Tears streamed down her face, each drop stinging the fresh wounds. The pain twisted her delicate features into a grimace, making her look utterly broken.

This wasn’t an act. The agony was real. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have collapsed unconscious from the sheer intensity of it.

Ethan’s stern expression faltered.

He didn’t know the full story yet. Accusing Vanessa without proof felt unjust, especially when she was clearly suffering.

When news came that Evelyn had regained consciousness, they rushed over from the adjacent room.

Ethan needed answers. But more than that, he was desperate to see Evelyn.

Yet Alexander stood like an immovable fortress outside Evelyn’s door, refusing to let them through.

The moment Claire spotted Ethan and Vanessa, her eyes flashed with fury.

"Are you deaf? Get out. Now."

Vanessa’s lower lip trembled. "Claire, you’re her best friend, but I’m her sister. I care about her too. Why won’t you let me—"

Claire cut her off with a sharp gesture. "Don’t you dare play the family card. After everything you’ve done?"

Ethan stepped forward, his voice low but firm. "We just want to see her."

"Over my dead body," Claire hissed.

Vanessa flinched, fresh tears welling up. "Please… I need to know she’s okay."

A bitter laugh escaped Claire. "Oh, now you care? How convenient."

Ethan’s jaw tightened. "This isn’t helping anyone. We need to talk to Evelyn."

"You lost that right," Claire shot back. "The second you chose to believe lies over her."

Silence fell, heavy and suffocating.

Then, from behind the door, a weak but clear voice called out—

"Let them in."

Claire stiffened. "Evelyn, no—"

"Now."

The command, though quiet, left no room for argument.

Claire exhaled sharply before stepping aside, her glare promising retribution.

Ethan hesitated, then pushed the door open.

Inside, Evelyn lay propped against the pillows, her face pale but her gaze steady.

The moment their eyes met, Ethan’s breath caught.

Because the warmth that had once lived in those depths was gone.

Replaced by something cold.

Something final.

Vanessa's crocodile tears only fueled Claire's rage.

Her nails dug into her palms as she thought, "I'm not blind to your games, Vanessa. I know exactly what kind of viper you are."

Claire's glare could have melted steel. "Evelyn's injuries are far worse than your superficial scratches. She regained consciousness hours after you did. How dare you accuse her of pushing you? These fake concern act makes me sick. Vanessa, doesn't your conscience burn with all these lies?"

Vanessa's lips trembled as she manufactured another round of sobs.

Richard chose that moment to intervene. "Someone explain what truly happened last night. Evelyn, did you physically harm Vanessa?"

The room already knew Vanessa's carefully crafted narrative.

She'd spun a tale of heated words exchanged in the stairwell, claiming Evelyn had shoved her in a fit of rage over financial disputes.

According to Vanessa, the argument stemmed from property transfers - how Evelyn had seized the Hawthorne Estate while demanding repayment of years' worth of stock dividends. When Vanessa refused, Evelyn allegedly pushed her.

Claire wouldn't swallow that poison.

Before Evelyn could draw breath to respond, Claire stepped forward, cutting Richard off mid-sentence.

The hospital room was thick with tension.

"Mr. Hayes," Claire said sharply, crossing her arms. "Evelyn just regained consciousness. As her father, shouldn’t your first concern be her well-being? Instead, you’re interrogating her like she’s on trial."

She turned her piercing gaze to Vanessa. "She claims Evelyn pushed her, but where’s the proof? Even in court, the burden of proof lies with the accuser."

Richard Hayes stiffened, caught off guard by Claire’s boldness. He wasn’t used to being challenged—especially not by someone younger than him.

Yet, he couldn’t argue. Her logic was airtight.

Margaret Hayes nudged him, forcing a smile. "Evelyn, darling, how are you feeling? Do you need anything?"

Claire scoffed. "Mrs. Hayes, she’s been awake for nearly twenty minutes, and this is the first time you’ve asked about her condition? Where were you earlier?"

Margaret pressed her lips together. Claire was on a warpath today, dismantling every argument with precision.

Better to stay silent.

Claire’s specialty was dance, but right now, she was wielding words like weapons.

Back when she was just a teenager dreaming of getting into a prestigious dance academy, everyone around her had unwavering faith in her abilities.

Her family, her friends—they all believed in her without question, convinced that her natural talent and rigorous training would guarantee her success.

"You’re a born dancer, Claire," they’d say, their voices filled with admiration. "With skills like yours, the academy won’t even hesitate."

Some even joked, half-seriously, "What hope do the rest of us have when you’re this good?"

But Claire knew the truth better than anyone.

It wasn’t talent that carried her—it was sheer, relentless effort.

While others rested, she practiced. While they slept, she rehearsed. Every bruise, every drop of sweat, every late-night session in the studio—those were the real reasons she stood out.

Among all the voices cheering her on, only Evelyn saw through the illusion.

Only Evelyn understood the weight behind her so-called "gift."

###Chapter 248 The Most Special Person

The morning sun filtered through the studio windows as Claire balanced on one foot, her stomach growling from skipping breakfast.

Evelyn lounged on the yoga mat beside her, twirling a water bottle between her fingers. "You're killing me with this starvation act," she teased. "Let's grab acai bowls after this. Extra granola, just for you."

Claire wobbled but maintained her pose. "Three more pounds," she panted. "The audition panel notices every ounce."

"You could show up in sweatpants and still outshine everyone." Evelyn reached up to pinch Claire's now-sharp cheekbone. "Seriously, where's my chipmunk-cheeked best friend? I want her back."

Their laughter echoed off the mirrored walls.

No one cheered louder at Claire's performances than Evelyn. No one brought homemade cookies to Claire's grueling rehearsals. They were each other's compass—Evelyn's boldness balancing Claire's perfectionism.

So when Claire spotted the snickering interns crowding Evelyn's workstation that afternoon, she didn't hesitate.

Just like Evelyn had stood between Claire and Isabella's venom years ago, Claire now planted herself beside her best friend. Some bonds demanded unconditional shields.

The Hayes family never treated Evelyn Carter well, so they wouldn't give much weight to her words.

But Claire Dawson was different.

As an outsider, her opinion held more credibility.

Just as expected, after Claire confronted Richard and Margaret Hayes, they fell into an uncomfortable silence.

Yet Claire wasn’t finished.

She fixed them with a sharp gaze. "Any decent parents would treasure their own child above all else. But you two? You're the exception."

"You're blind and foolish, letting Vanessa Hart—an adopted daughter—bully Evelyn, your own flesh and blood. Anyone looking in would think there’s something seriously wrong with your parenting."

No more subtlety. Claire’s words struck directly at their hypocrisy.

Richard and Margaret stood frozen, their faces burning with shame.

Vanessa’s eyes brimmed with tears.

Her voice trembled. "Claire, don’t blame my parents. They just love me. Love isn’t about fairness. Even if you’re defending Evelyn, you can’t attack them like this. They’re—"

"At least show some respect to your elders."

"Get lost. I won't waste my breath on trash like you."

Claire regarded Vanessa with such disdain that she couldn’t even muster the effort to insult her properly.

Vanessa’s face twisted through a series of expressions. Being called trash in public left her momentarily speechless, her anger boiling beneath the surface.

After a tense pause, Vanessa clutched Ethan’s arm. "Ethan, Claire is so vicious. How could Lucas have ever married someone like her?"

Ethan was well aware of the history between Claire and Evelyn, but hearing Claire openly label Vanessa as trash still ignited his fury.

Vanessa was still his wife, after all, and he held a prominent position in Cresthaven.

He leveled a cold stare at Claire. "Mind your language."

Claire scoffed. "Feeling protective now? Spare me the hypocrisy. You and Vanessa deserve each other—both equally rotten."

No matter how composed Ethan usually was, this was too much.

"Claire, know your place. You’re divorcing Lucas. Do you still think you’re some unique exception? How dare you speak to me like that?"

His voice dripped with contempt, but Claire didn’t flinch.

She tilted her head, a mocking smile playing on her lips. "Oh, I’m definitely unique—unique enough to see right through both of you."

Vanessa’s grip on Ethan tightened, her nails digging in. "Ethan, she’s gone too far!"

Claire merely rolled her eyes. "Save the theatrics. I don’t have time for this."

She turned on her heel, leaving them standing there, fuming.

But before she could take more than two steps, Ethan’s voice cut through the air.

"You’ll regret this, Claire."

She paused, glancing back over her shoulder. "Doubt it."

Then she walked away, her steps light, as if she hadn’t just shattered their fragile egos.

Vanessa seethed. "We can’t let her get away with this!"

Ethan’s jaw clenched. "She won’t."

But Claire was already gone, leaving behind only the echo of her defiance.

And the unspoken truth—that she was, in fact, the most unique one among them.

Claire let out a careless chuckle. "Whatever exists between Lucas and me doesn't strip me of my right to speak. Ethan, did I strike a nerve? That guilty conscience of yours showing?"

"No wonder Lucas strayed. With that sharp tongue of yours, what man could endure you?"

For a brief moment, Claire faltered, the words sinking in. Is that really how it is?

Just then, the door swung open, and footsteps echoed into the room.

The air thickened with tension as Claire met Ethan's cold stare.

She tilted her chin up, refusing to back down. "Funny how you're suddenly so concerned about my relationship when yours is built on lies."

Ethan's jaw clenched. "You always did love twisting words."

"Only when the truth needs untangling," she shot back.

A bitter laugh escaped him. "You think you're so clever, don't you?"

Before she could retort, the sound of approaching footsteps cut through their exchange.

Claire exhaled sharply, her fingers curling into her palms.

Ethan's words stung more than she cared to admit. Was she really that unbearable?

She forced a smirk. "If I'm so difficult, why do you keep provoking me?"

"Because someone needs to remind you of your place," he sneered.

Her pulse spiked. "My place? Last I checked, you lost any right to dictate that."

The tension shattered as the door creaked open behind them.

Claire's laughter was light, but her eyes burned with defiance.

"Relationship or not, I still get a say. Or does the truth scare you, Ethan?"

His expression darkened. "You always did love playing the victim."

"Funny," she mused. "I thought that was Vanessa's specialty."

Ethan took a step closer, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Careful, Claire."

Just then, the sharp click of heels on marble announced an arrival.

Claire arched a brow, unfazed.

"Struck a nerve, did I? Or are you just mad Lucas sees through you?"

Ethan's lip curled. "He'll tire of you soon enough."

Her smile didn't waver. "At least he chose me first."

The jab landed hard. Ethan's knuckles whitened at his sides.

Before he could retaliate, the door swung open, interrupting their standoff.

Claire crossed her arms, meeting Ethan's glare head-on.

"Still bitter he picked me over Vanessa?"

Ethan's laugh was hollow. "Enjoy it while it lasts."

"Oh, I will," she purred. "Every single second."

The charged silence between them shattered as someone entered the room.

Claire's grin was razor-sharp.

"Worried Lucas might actually respect me? How novel."

Ethan's eyes flashed. "Delusional to the end."

"Better than being a coward," she countered.

His retort died on his lips as the door clicked open behind them.

Claire didn't flinch under Ethan's icy stare.

"Truth hurts, doesn't it?"

His smirk was venomous. "You'll learn what real pain feels like soon."

Before she could fire back, the sound of approaching footsteps filled the room.

Claire tilted her head, feigning innocence.

"Aw, did I ruin your perfect little narrative?"

Ethan's voice dripped with disdain. "You ruin everything you touch."

"Funny," she mused. "Lucas seems to disagree."

The tension snapped as the door creaked open.

Claire exhaled sharply, squaring her shoulders.

Ethan's words hung between them like a challenge.

She opened her mouth to retaliate—

Just as the door swung wide, revealing an unexpected figure.

###Chapter 249 The Stage Is Yours

Lucas Bennett cut an imposing figure as he entered, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders.

His stormy expression sent a chill through the air—clearly, he'd heard every word of the heated exchange.

His icy gaze locked onto Ethan Caldwell. "First," he bit out, "I didn't cheat. Unlike you, who's been sleeping with Vanessa Hart for months. So spare me the hypocrisy."

"Second," he continued, voice dropping to a dangerous timbre, "until the divorce papers are signed, Claire Dawson remains my wife. If you have an issue, you deal with me. Attacking her? Pathetic."

Claire's breath caught. She hadn't anticipated Lucas's sudden appearance.

The way he defended her so fiercely in front of everyone sent conflicting emotions swirling through her chest.

Ethan's jaw tightened, humiliation and rage warring in his expression as the crowd's murmurs grew.

Then, a delicate hand tugged at his sleeve.

Vanessa offered a fragile smile. "Ethan, it's alright. My concussion was just an accident. I don't blame anyone." Her fingers trembled against his arm. "Let's not make a scene."

The unspoken plea in her eyes only deepened Ethan's scowl.

Lucas didn't miss the exchange. A sardonic smirk twisted his lips. "How touching. The mistress playing peacemaker."

Claire flinched at his harsh words, but Lucas stepped closer, deliberately shielding her from view.

The tension crackled like live wires.

Ethan finally snapped. "You arrogant bastard—"

"Save it." Lucas cut him off with a dismissive wave. "If you want a fight, name the time and place. But harassing my wife?" His smile turned razor-sharp. "That ends now."

A stunned silence fell over the onlookers.

Claire stared at Lucas's profile, her pulse erratic. This wasn't the detached husband she knew.

Something had changed.

And judging by the dark promise in Lucas's eyes, the real performance was just beginning.

The sun streamed through the hospital windows, casting long shadows across the sterile floor.

Evelyn exhaled softly, her fingers brushing against the crisp sheets. "It's over now. Vanessa is still my sister, no matter what. What's done is done—no use crying over spilled milk."

The situation had spiraled completely out of Vanessa's grasp.

And Claire? She was fighting like a lioness today. With Lucas backing her every word, Vanessa knew pushing further would only backfire.

She already looked more pitiful than Evelyn. That was enough.

Vanessa pressed a trembling hand to her temple. "Ethan… could you take me to my room? My head is pounding."

Ethan studied her for a moment. The pallor of her skin wasn't faked this time. He offered his arm without a word.

The doctor had ordered bed rest, after all.

Just then, Alexander, who had been silent as a shadow, finally spoke. "Leaving so soon?"

His voice was cool, detached. He moved past the others without sparing them a glance, stopping only when he reached Evelyn's side.

Leaning down, his lips brushed her ear as he whispered, "Had enough rest, darling? The stage is yours now."

The words were meant for her alone.

Evelyn's eyes widened.

He knew.

He knew she had been awake this whole time.

And now—it was her turn to perform.

Did You Actually Sleep Last Night?

How did he know?

Had I given myself away?

Did anyone else notice?

Their whispered conversation made Ethan's knuckles turn white. His emerald eyes darkened with barely contained fury, jaw clenched so tight I could see the muscle twitching.

Evelyn blinked slowly, her voice deliberately weak. "I'm sorry, everyone. I hit my head last night and felt terrible. I just regained consciousness."

Vanessa studied Evelyn with narrowed eyes.

Lying on the hospital bed, Evelyn looked every bit the groggy patient who'd just woken up. But Vanessa's mind raced. Not a single bruise on her perfect face. How convenient.

She claims she fainted? More like took a nap.

If it weren't for Ethan and Nathan insisting Evelyn fell with me yesterday, I'd swear she never touched the ground.

Why do I have a splitting headache and cuts while she's completely untouched? Life's not fair.

"Vanessa," Evelyn's voice cut through her thoughts, "are you still accusing me of pushing you? Don't you think it's time to tell the truth?"

The heart monitor beeped steadily in the tense silence.

Vanessa gasped, her fingers tightening around her champagne flute. "It was you... Never mind, Evelyn. I said I wouldn't dwell on the past."

The forced generosity in her voice only exposed the tremor of guilt beneath.

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile before she exhaled dramatically. "Very well. Since you insist on playing the martyr, I'll confess—I did give you that little push."

A collective gasp rippled through the gathered guests.

Every eye in the ballroom widened. They'd expected fiery denials, legal threats, anything but this casual admission.

Even Vanessa staggered back half a step, her perfectly contoured face slack with shock.

The crystal chandeliers overhead seemed to dim as tension crackled through Horizon Enterprises' annual gala.

Champagne bubbles burst against Vanessa's trembling lips as she struggled to regain composure. Across from her, Evelyn adjusted an emerald bracelet—Alexander's latest gift—with deliberate calm.

"Though I must ask," Evelyn continued, tilting her head, "why were you standing so close to the balcony edge that night?"

Murmurs erupted among the socialites. A server nearly dropped his silver tray.

Vanessa's manicured nails dug into her palms. "That's—that's irrelevant!"

Evelyn's laugh tinkled like the ice in her glass. "Is it?"

Near the grand piano, Nathan Reeves discreetly signaled security. This charity event was about to become front-page news.

The scent of gardenias from centerpieces grew cloying as Vanessa's breathing turned shallow. She'd orchestrated this confrontation to humiliate Evelyn, not... this.

Alexander Whitmore appeared in the arched doorway, his Armani suit cutting through the crowd like a blade. His gaze locked onto his wife with predatory intensity.

"Darling," Evelyn purred, extending a hand, "you're just in time for the main act."
###Chapter 250 Unrepentant Vanessa

Ethan’s piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Don’t you have anything to say for yourself?"

Evelyn met his stare without flinching. "Would you even believe me if I did? Every time something like this happened before, I tried explaining. Did any of you ever listen?"

Her eyes flickered briefly to Richard and Margaret before settling back on Ethan.

Perhaps her expression was too sharp, or maybe the three of them were suddenly reminded of their past mistakes. They all looked away, unable to hold her gaze.

A heavy silence filled the air, thick with unspoken guilt.

Evelyn’s voice was calm, almost detached. "Vanessa is right. We’re sisters, after all. What’s a little injustice between family? So what if I tumbled down the stairs? At least I didn’t break anything vital. I won’t make a fuss over it. What’s done is done. Dwelling on it won’t change anything."

Vanessa stiffened.

She’s mocking me!

Since when did she become so cunning?

Vanessa responded without hesitation, "Evelyn, what are you implying? It was obviously you who pushed me. How dare you play the victim?"

The stairwell had no surveillance cameras. Only the two of them knew the truth of what had transpired.

Vanessa was smug, certain Evelyn couldn’t prove anything. That was why she spun her lies so boldly.

Claire watched Evelyn with sympathy, knowing her friend had endured too much doubt in the past.

"Tell us what really happened, Evelyn," Claire urged. "Alexander will defend you, and I won’t let you suffer unjustly."

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "The truth is, Vanessa fabricated everything. I never pushed her. This was all her doing."

Vanessa cut in sharply, "That’s a lie! Evelyn is the one who attacked me. We argued in the stairwell, and in her rage, she shoved me down. She even said she wished I were dead so she could be our parents’ only daughter!"

Vanessa was a master manipulator, weaving her false narrative with practiced ease.

Tears streamed down her face as she pointed an accusing finger at Evelyn, painting herself as the wounded victim.

She twisted the story to make Evelyn seem jealous, vindictive, and cruel.

Vanessa was lost in her performance, her expression a perfect mask of sorrow.

But Evelyn stood firm, her gaze unwavering. She wouldn’t let Vanessa’s lies destroy her again.

Not this time.

The tension in the room was palpable as Richard and Margaret exchanged uneasy glances.

Vanessa's tear-filled eyes locked onto them, her voice trembling. "Dad, Mom, I've told you before—I should leave the Hawthorne Estate so Evelyn wouldn’t despise me like this. It's all my fault! Why don’t you just disown me?"

Her tears spilled over, and Richard immediately rushed to her side, his face etched with concern. He gently wiped her cheeks. "Vanessa, don’t cry. I won’t let anyone blame you unfairly. I’ll handle this."

His protective gaze then shifted to Evelyn, his tone sharpening. "Look what you’ve done to Vanessa, Evelyn. Apologize now."

Claire crossed her arms, her expression darkening. "Didn’t Evelyn get hurt too?"

Richard scoffed. "Vanessa is covered in bruises, while Evelyn doesn’t have a scratch on her. Who do you think suffered more?"

Men always had a soft spot for the one who appeared more fragile.

Claire’s lips curled into a cold smile. "That just proves Vanessa’s injuries are superficial—they’ll fade in days. But Evelyn’s wounds run deeper. So tell me, who’s truly worse off?"

Alexander’s eyes narrowed dangerously as he fixed Richard with a silent, warning glare.

Perhaps sensing the weight of that stare, Richard hesitated.

The realization of his recent business failures crept into his mind.

Richard forced a tight-lipped smile at Alexander and said, "Evelyn has always been stubborn. As her father, it's my duty to correct her behavior."

Alexander let out a derisive laugh. "Father? If I recall correctly, she publicly disowned you months ago. What gives you the right to lecture her now?"

His voice dripped with contempt as he took a step forward, his towering frame casting a shadow over Richard. "You lost any claim to fatherhood the moment you chose your new family over her."

Richard's jaw clenched, his fingers twitching at his sides. "Blood ties can't be erased that easily, Alexander. She'll always be my daughter."

"Funny," Alexander countered coldly, "because the way I remember it, you were the one who erased her first."

The air between them crackled with tension.

Evelyn watched from the doorway, her arms crossed. She had no intention of intervening—not when Alexander was dismantling Richard's hypocrisy so effortlessly.

Richard's face darkened. "You don't understand family obligations."

"And you don't understand loyalty," Alexander shot back. "If you had, Evelyn wouldn't have had to suffer because of your choices."

A heavy silence settled between them.

Richard opened his mouth to retort, but Alexander cut him off with a dismissive wave. "Save your excuses. The only reason you're here now is because you need something from her. Again."

Evelyn's lips curved into a bitter smile.

Some things never changed.

###Chapter 251 The Recorder

Richard's hands trembled visibly as the accusation hung in the air.

Claire smirked, her voice dripping with disdain. "Age doesn’t grant wisdom, especially to those who’ve never earned the title they claim. A father? You’ve never acted like one—not for a single day."

Her gaze sharpened. "Mr. Hayes, every time Vanessa sheds a tear, you immediately lash out at Evelyn. Tell me, which one is actually your daughter? Or is Vanessa something more… intimate? The way you coddle her certainly raises questions."

Richard's face twisted in fury. "How dare you—"

Lucas cut him off with a warning glance. "Mind your tone."

Richard swallowed hard, realizing his mistake. These weren’t people he could afford to anger.

Margaret, her patience wearing thin, stepped in. "Enough. Vanessa, stop clinging to your father like a child. You’re a grown woman—act like it. This behavior is inappropriate and invites rumors."

Claire’s words had struck a chord.

Margaret’s thoughts darkened. I may have watched Vanessa grow up, but she shares no blood with Richard.

The tension in the room thickened, the unspoken truth hovering like a storm about to break.

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the Hawthorne Estate.

Even a biological daughter naturally grows distant from her father with time—how much more so an adopted one?

Richard's affection for Vanessa had always been excessive. Too tender. Too indulgent.

Margaret had caught them whispering in corners more times than she could count, their hushed voices cutting off the moment she approached.

Once doubt took root, it spread like wildfire through her mind.

Before, she had simply assumed they shared an unusually close bond. Now, every glance, every touch between them seemed laced with something darker.

Vanessa froze, her mind racing. Was it wrong for Richard to wipe my tears?

Her gaze flickered nervously toward Ethan, terrified of what he might think.

But Ethan stood motionless, his expression unreadable, lost in some private turmoil.

Evelyn watched the scene unfold with icy detachment. "Vanessa," she said, her voice sharp as glass, "why would I push you?"

Vanessa's lips trembled as she spun her web of lies, each word carefully crafted to paint Evelyn as the villain.

"You married Alexander," she whispered, voice thick with false hurt, "but you still can't let go of Ethan."

The air grew heavy with tension, thick enough to choke on.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists at her sides, her patience wearing dangerously thin.

Margaret's eyes darted between them, suspicion hardening into something uglier.

And Ethan—Ethan said nothing at all.

"You believe my presence near Ethan is ruining your schemes. And worse—you think I stole our parents' affection. That's why you want me dead."

The moment Evelyn spoke those words, the air in the room turned icy.

Vanessa's accusations had crossed a line, offending everyone who stood by Evelyn's side.

"Absolute rubbish."

With deliberate calm, Evelyn reached into her pocket and retrieved a sleek black recorder.

Her voice was steady. "I recorded everything that happened yesterday."

Vanessa froze, her gaze locked onto the device.

How did Evelyn even have a recorder on her?

Modern recorders could capture video too. If that were the case, every damning detail of the incident would be preserved.

"Vanessa, you look terrified."

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smile. "Beg me now, and I might just—"

Before she could finish, Ethan, who had been silent until then, stepped forward and snatched the recorder from her hand.

Alexander's eyes narrowed dangerously, certain Ethan meant to crush the damning evidence beneath his heel.

His fingers twitched, ready to seize the device back—but then Ethan's thumb pressed play instead.

The recorder crackled to life with Vanessa's venomous voice:

"Evelyn, you stole Alexander from me. Now give Ethan back. He was always meant to be mine."

A sharp inhale echoed through the room.

"Why did you have to return from prison? Why ruin everything? Without you, I'd be their only daughter. Ethan would've chosen me."

The recording captured every hissed syllable, every unstable tremor in her tone.

"Evelyn, he belongs to me. Our parents' love was always mine first. You think you've won?" A brittle laugh. "I'll never let you keep what's rightfully mine."

Last night's confrontation in the stairwell unfolded anew through the speakers.

The high-definition footage played simultaneously—Vanessa's calculated glance toward the security camera.

The deliberate way she flung herself backward, screaming as if Evelyn had shoved her.

Except Evelyn's hands never made contact.

The truth unraveled in brutal clarity: Evelyn had actually been reaching to pull Vanessa back when momentum dragged them both down.

Alexander's jaw tightened. The recorder clattered onto the table, its damning testimony echoing in the sudden silence.

Vanessa's breath hitched, her fingers turning ice-cold.

"You vile creature." Claire's voice dripped with venom as she stepped forward, her glare sharp enough to cut glass. "After everything Evelyn did to protect you, this is how you repay her? Spreading filth about the one person who still showed you mercy?" She scoffed, shaking her head in disgust. "You're not just shameless—you're poison."

The weight of the accusation hung thick in the air.

Vanessa opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

Claire wasn't finished. "Did you really think no one would find out? That your lies would just disappear?" She pulled out her phone, thumb hovering over the screen. "Guess what? The truth always surfaces."

A cold dread slithered down Vanessa's spine.

What had they uncovered?

###Chapter 252 The Twisted Truth

Evelyn was viewing the security footage for the first time.

To her astonishment, the angle made it seem as though she had attempted to save Vanessa, only to be unintentionally pulled down with her.

What an unexpected twist.

This conveniently eliminated the need for further explanations.

The evidence was undeniable—Evelyn was innocent, and Vanessa had orchestrated the entire scene.

Vanessa had deliberately thrown herself down the stairs, then shamelessly accused Evelyn of pushing her.

But the truth was, Evelyn hadn’t laid a finger on her. In fact, her first instinct had been to reach out and help.

Richard, who had once trusted Vanessa implicitly, now stared at her with a mix of betrayal and disbelief.

Margaret, too, seemed unable to recognize the daughter she had raised.

She couldn’t reconcile the sweet, gentle girl she knew with the scheming woman standing before her.

Margaret’s thoughts raced. "Vanessa threw herself down those stairs without hesitation—

The plan had been flawless—or so Vanessa thought. It should have crushed Evelyn just like it did three years ago. How could everything unravel because of a stupid recording?

Fury burned through her veins.

Ethan remained silent, his expression unreadable. That silence gave Vanessa a flicker of hope.

Maybe he still trusts me. Maybe he’s waiting for an explanation. If I can just make him understand…

Her voice shook with desperation. "That video is fake! It’s been edited—Evelyn did push me! She must have cut that part out!"

Claire stared at her like she was insane. "Evelyn’s been unconscious in the hospital since yesterday. I’ve been by her side the whole time. How exactly could she have done that?"

Vanessa’s panic made her reckless. "You’re her best friend! Of course you’d lie for her! Maybe you tampered with it to set me up!"

Now she was dragging Claire into her mess.

Lucas’s expression darkened. "Claire would never do something like that. Keep her name out of your mouth."

Claire shot him an icy look. "While I appreciate the defense, Mr. Bennett, I don’t need you speaking for me. Stay out of it."

The tension in the room thickened. Vanessa’s lies were unraveling, and she had nowhere left to run.

Lucas's grip tightened around his glass.

The way Claire had addressed him as "Mr. Bennett" in front of everyone stung more than he expected.

Was she deliberately putting distance between them?

His jaw clenched as he watched her laugh with Alexander across the room.

She hadn't even glanced his way since arriving.

The formal title echoed in his mind, sharp as a blade.

They had shared too much for such coldness.

Yet here she was, treating him like a stranger.

His fingers tapped impatiently against the crystal surface.

Was this her way of sending a message?

Or was there something else he was missing?

The champagne in his glass remained untouched.

He couldn't shake the unease coiling in his chest.

Alexander leaned closer to whisper something in Claire's ear.

Lucas's knuckles turned white.

The scene before him twisted into something he refused to name.

###Chapter 253 Partiality

Lucas merely averted his gaze, remaining silent.

Alexander turned his piercing eyes toward Vanessa and drawled, "I was present here all night as well, Vanessa. Are you implying I assisted my wife in doctoring the footage?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. Alexander stayed with me the entire night? With his relentless schedule…

Her gaze flickered over him. He still wore yesterday's attire, and though he masked it well, the faint shadows beneath his eyes betrayed his exhaustion.

A rush of warmth flooded her chest.

Alexander's offhand remark struck Vanessa like a physical blow.

Her face drained of color, lips parting soundlessly.

The Whitmores have always despised me. Alexander, as the family patriarch, wields unquestionable authority. Even Eleanor treads carefully around him—what chance do I have?

Crossing him would be catastrophic.

With the confrontation escalating to this point, there was—

There was nothing Vanessa could say to alter the circumstances.

Alexander narrowed his piercing gaze and turned to Richard. "Will the Hart family handle this disgrace themselves, or shall I intervene?"

Though deeply disappointed in Vanessa, Richard hesitated to let Alexander take control. He knew it would only inflame the situation further.

"Both my daughters acted out of line," he said quickly. "I assure you, I'll deal with them appropriately."

"Acted out of line?"

Alexander's laugh was cold, laced with biting mockery.

"Out of line enough to nearly cause irreversible damage. Mr. Hayes, your talent for deflection is impressive. No wonder Horizon Enterprises has been floundering lately. With leadership like yours, its downfall is inevitable."

Richard stiffened.

Is Alexander threatening Horizon Enterprises?

If he wanted to, he could cripple the company overnight. And if he truly decided to press the issue…

As a businessman, Richard calculated the risks swiftly. The realization settled heavily upon him.

Not a single word from Vanessa could alter the circumstances now.

Alexander's piercing gaze shifted to Richard. "Will the Hart family handle this disgrace themselves, or shall I intervene?"

Though deeply disappointed in Vanessa, Richard hesitated to let Alexander take control. He knew it would only worsen the situation.

"Both my daughters acted out of line," he said quickly. "I assure you, I'll deal with them appropriately."

"Acted out of line?"

Alexander's laugh was sharp, laced with derision. "Out of line enough to nearly cause irreversible damage. Mr. Hart, your talent for downplaying things is impressive. No wonder Horizon Enterprises has been struggling lately. With leadership like yours, it's only a matter of time before the company crumbles."

Richard stiffened.

His mind raced. Is Alexander threatening Horizon Enterprises?

If he wanted to, he could cripple the company's standing overnight. And if he truly pushes…

As a businessman, Richard assessed the risks. The realization struck him hard—

Vanessa’s defiance was a risk not worth taking against Alexander.

Besides, she was clearly in the wrong.

Richard’s glare burned into Vanessa. "Vanessa! What has gotten into you? You were always so compliant. Why are you acting out like this? Apologize to Evelyn immediately!"

Vanessa bit down on her lip until it nearly bled, her eyes blazing with unshed tears.

Though she appeared delicate, Richard knew how fiercely she guarded her pride.

Forcing her to apologize publicly was like demanding the impossible.

Richard seized Vanessa’s arm and yanked her toward Evelyn. "Evelyn, your sister was out of line. You don’t seem too hurt—please, for my sake, let this go. You’re sisters, and I want harmony between you."

He sighed, rubbing his temple. "Of course, I was too hasty in blaming you. But we’re family, and family shouldn’t hold grudges."

Evelyn stared at them, torn between disbelief and bitter amusement. Even now, Richard twisted his apology to shield Vanessa’s pride.

Margaret watched, her unease deepening. Something about this entire situation felt… off.

Vanessa's voice was icy and firm. "Richard, I can't take any more of this morning's drama. Just go."

Richard froze, his expression crumbling into shock. "Vanessa, why won't you call me Father?"

She didn’t answer. Instead, she turned away, slipping back under the sheets and pulling them tight around her shoulders.

Richard’s voice cracked. "I’m your father. Why are you refusing to say it?"

The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Vanessa didn’t move.

She didn’t speak.

She just shut him out completely.

Richard’s hands clenched at his sides, his chest tight with frustration.

This wasn’t how things were supposed to be.

Not after everything.

Not after all he’d done for her.

But Vanessa had made her choice.

And it didn’t include him.

###Chapter 254 The Perfect Performance

Evelyn's thoughts burned with contempt. Call you "Dad"? After everything you've done?

Alexander cleared the room under the pretense of Evelyn needing rest.

Richard opened his mouth to protest but clamped it shut at the glacial look in Alexander's eyes. Ethan, lost in his scheming thoughts, had to be physically pulled away by Vanessa.

Remembering how exhausted Alexander and Claire had been, Evelyn quickly insisted, "Go rest. I'll be fine here."

Thirty minutes later, Alexander had no choice but to leave for Horizon Enterprises' annual board meeting.

"I'll return this afternoon," he murmured, smoothing her blanket with uncharacteristic tenderness.

As he turned, his gaze landed on Lucas lingering near the door. Alexander's jaw tightened. "You—"

Lucas raised his hands. "Just stepping out for a smoke. Claire, we need to talk. Hallway."

The door clicked shut behind them, sealing Evelyn in deceptive quiet.

The moment Lucas Bennett's name was mentioned, Evelyn Carter's expression turned to stone. "So he actually tracked me down to the hospital!"

Realizing Claire Dawson might still be in the dark about Isabella Rhodes's situation, Evelyn lowered her voice. "Perhaps Lucas has urgent matters to discuss. You two should clear the air."

Her gaze drifted to Claire's abdomen. "And the baby... you haven't gone through with the procedure, have you? You're keeping it because... you still care."

Claire's fingers brushed lightly over her stomach.

In that sterile operating room, she'd been fully prepared to end the pregnancy.

Yet when the doctor reached for the instruments, something primal surged through her. She'd bolted upright, hands instinctively shielding her womb.

The realization had struck like lightning—this life inside her deserved a chance.

Financially independent and emotionally resolved, Claire knew she could raise this child alone.

This innocent life shouldn't pay the price for her failed marriage to Lucas.

After a weighted silence, Claire met Evelyn's gaze. "I chose to keep my baby. But make no mistake—this decision has nothing to do with Lucas Bennett. There are no lingering attachments."

The heart monitor beeped steadily as sunlight streamed through the blinds, casting striped shadows across Claire's determined face. Outside, hospital staff wheeled carts down the hallway, their muffled voices a stark contrast to the tension thickening the air.

Evelyn studied her friend's profile—the tightness around Claire's mouth, the way her fingers kept returning to her abdomen in unconscious circles. A telltale sign even the most convincing words couldn't disguise.

Some wounds ran too deep for declarations to heal.

The physician's words still echoed in Claire's mind - high-risk pregnancy, unstable fetus.

Stepping out of the surgical suite, she'd made her decision. Nature would take its course.

If this child was meant to survive, it would. If not... well, some things weren't meant to be.

Evelyn squeezed Claire's trembling fingers. "Whatever you choose, I'm with you. If you still want the divorce, I'll be the best godmother this city's ever seen."

Claire managed a weak chuckle, tapping Evelyn's cheek. "Looking for motherhood without the stretch marks? Nice try."

"But your bump will show eventually," Evelyn countered. "With Lucas's possessive nature, he'll never release you if he discovers you're still carrying his child."

A dangerous spark lit Claire's eyes. "What if we let Julian take credit? Can you imagine Lucas tolerating his wife pregnant with another man's baby?"

Evelyn's breath caught.

Lucas Bennett's legendary pride would never survive such humiliation.

Claire's lips curved into a calculated smile. "Julian as my secret lover, father of my child. Plausible, don't you think?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed as realization struck - Claire wasn't just leaving. She was orchestrating the perfect exit strategy.

The game had changed.

Her gaze flickered toward the door. "Lucas is probably still waiting outside. You should go talk to him properly."

Claire hesitated, studying her friend’s face. "But what about you…? Are you really alright?"

Evelyn’s lips curved into a small, knowing smile. "Honestly? I was faking it." She leaned in slightly, lowering her voice. "I didn’t actually fall last night, and I certainly didn’t save Vanessa. I followed her deliberately and took that fall—just to ruin whatever scheme she was planning."

A beat of silence passed between them.

Claire’s eyes widened. "You what?"

Evelyn exhaled, her fingers absently tracing the edge of the hospital blanket. "She was up to something. I could feel it. So I made sure she wouldn’t get away with it."

The revelation hung in the air, sharp and unexpected.

Claire swallowed hard. "Does Alexander know?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Not yet. But he will."

A knock at the door interrupted them.

Claire shot her a look. "Guess that’s your cue."

Evelyn smirked. "Guess so."

###Chapter 255 I Love You

Evelyn remained silent for a long moment.

She had just watched the footage showing Vanessa being rescued by Claire, and it didn’t make sense to her.

Her mind raced. Vanessa has been nothing but trouble. Claire should be relieved if Vanessa ended up hurt—so why would she save her?

Evelyn finally spoke. "So, you were unconscious for that long?"

The question only deepened Claire’s guilt. "Actually, I wasn’t unconscious. I just... fell asleep and didn’t wake up for hours. I had no idea you stayed here all night. I’m so sorry."

"You’re kidding, right? I barely slept worrying about you!"

Evelyn reached out, cupping Claire’s face between her palms, and gave her cheeks a playful, affectionate squeeze.

"Okay, fine—I didn’t stay all night. I left around eleven. Alexander was the one who kept watch over you."

She sighed, her expression softening. "Claire, he’s a good man. I know he’s friends with Lucas, but he’s nothing like that arrogant jerk. Seeing you with someone who actually treats you right... as your best friend, it makes me happy."

Claire blinked, her lips parting slightly.

Evelyn smirked. "Don’t look so shocked. I can be supportive when I want to be."

A small laugh escaped Claire. "I never doubted that."

Evelyn leaned back, crossing her arms. "Good. Because if you ever let a man like Alexander slip away, I will disown you."

Claire rolled her eyes, but the warmth in them was unmistakable. "Noted."

Evelyn grinned. "Now, tell me everything. How did he confess? Was it romantic? Or did he just blurt it out like the emotionally constipated rich boy he is?"

Claire groaned, but the smile tugging at her lips gave her away.

Evelyn’s eyes gleamed. "Oh, this is going to be good."

Claire understood all too well the struggles Evelyn had endured with the Hayes family and their unfair treatment. But there was little she could do to change the past.

Ethan Caldwell had been particularly cruel, crushing Evelyn's sincere affections beneath his heel.

Claire spoke these words hoping Evelyn wouldn't shut herself off completely because of her painful history.

At the very least, in Claire's eyes, Alexander Whitmore was a good man.

Evelyn grasped Claire's meaning.

She needed to redirect her focus toward Alexander.

From the corner of her eye, Evelyn noticed Lucas Bennett watching from the doorway. She gave Claire a subtle nudge.

Claire turned and met Lucas's gaze, her expression carefully neutral.

She closed the door behind her and stepped into the hallway.

Lucas hadn't seen Claire in over a week.

After he'd been hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer from excessive drinking, Claire had only signed his admission forms on the first day. She hadn't visited him once since.

A dull ache settled in Lucas's chest. He knew Claire—

Claire had been determined to sever all ties with Lucas for good, but he refused to let her go.

The bitter truth gnawed at him—the chasm between them had been carefully crafted by Isabella.

That woman’s deceit had cost them everything.

They’d lost their unborn child.

The hospital corridor stretched empty as Lucas finally spoke, his voice thick with remorse. "Claire, Isabella’s behind bars now. She orchestrated both incidents during your performances. We were all pawns in her game."

His hands trembled as he continued. "She staged that rescue, played the hero—all part of her twisted plan. And your accident? The one that stole your dancing career? That was her too. She wanted your spotlight, your life."

A ragged breath escaped him. "I know how much dance means to you. I’ve hired the best lawyers to sue her for every penny of compensation you deserve."

Then his voice broke. "Please. Give us another chance. I can’t—I won’t—sign those divorce papers. This isn’t how our story ends." His fingers brushed her tear-streaked cheek. "Don’t you see? You’re the only woman I’ve ever loved. The only one I’ll ever love."

In one swift motion, Lucas enveloped her in an embrace so tight it stole her breath, as if he could fuse their broken pieces back together through sheer will.

###Chapter 256 Remorse

The unexpected embrace froze Claire in place.

Lucas's familiar cologne wrapped around her, triggering a flood of memories.

It took her a moment to recognize the scent—the same one she had gifted him a year ago for his birthday.

Back then, their marriage hadn’t yet crumbled. She had spent weeks selecting that bottle, carefully tying the ribbon herself.

But when she never saw him wear it, she assumed he had discarded it.

Until one day, while organizing his closet, she found it—untouched, the ribbon still perfectly intact.

The discovery had cut deeper than any argument.

Now, as Lucas whispered words she had once longed to hear, Claire felt nothing but exhaustion.

She had poured her heart into loving him, only to be met with indifference.

The ache of those memories had long since faded into numbness.

Claire no longer had the energy to fight for a love that had never truly been hers.

The love she had given him was deep, yet it had never been reciprocated. That devotion had slowly faded, like embers dying in the cold.

Now, Claire understood—loving herself came first.

Letting go was necessary, no matter how much it hurt. The pain was temporary, but freedom was worth it.

She pulled away from Lucas’s arms, her gaze distant, tinged with sorrow.

“I know about Isabella. The police visited me days ago. They confirmed my injury wasn’t an accident—it was orchestrated by her. So, I’ll be handling the lawsuit myself.”

Lucas froze, his expression flickering with shock. He hadn’t expected such calmness from her.

It was as if she were discussing a stranger’s misfortune.

“As for your love… I’m sorry. Once, I loved you desperately. I waited for you to love me back. But now? I don’t.” She met his eyes steadily. “Lucas, for the sake of what we once had, just let me go.”

His face twisted in anguish. “How can you stop loving me? Claire, I won’t accept that! You have to love me—you belong to me!”

Before she could react, Lucas ignored their surroundings—the sterile hospital hallway, the passing nurses—and crushed his lips against hers in a desperate, possessive kiss.

Claire instinctively tried to pull back, but Lucas's hands were like iron shackles around her.

He pressed her firmly against the wall, his fingers digging into her shoulders with desperate intensity.

When their lips crashed together, she gasped in surprise, giving him the opening he needed. His tongue swept into her mouth with a hunger that stole her breath.

The kiss was all-consuming, as if he wanted to brand her with his passion.

She pushed against his chest, but he didn't budge. His body was an immovable force, his need overwhelming.

The realization of how far he'd gone made her snap. Her palm connected sharply with his cheek in a stinging slap.

"I told you I don't love you anymore!" Her voice trembled with anger. "Where was this passion when we were married? The great Lucas Bennett, reduced to begging for scraps of affection - how the mighty have fallen."

She laughed bitterly. "The Bennett heir shouldn't have to chase after any woman. Don't you have your precious Isabella waiting for you?"

The memories of those empty nights haunted her.

Three years of marriage. Three years of waiting alone in their cold bed. Every time she called, he was either with his business associates or whispering sweet nothings to Isabella on the phone.

It was worse than being widowed. She could have handled occasional neglect, but three years of it had broken something inside her.

Isabella was part of the problem, but was Lucas truly innocent?

He's constantly by Isabella's side, while I, his lawful wife, am left forgotten in the shadows.

What happened to his duty as a married man?

Lucas was stunned when Claire slapped him in front of everyone.

His voice was raw with desperation and defiance. "Yes, the Bennett heir can have any woman he desires. Maybe you're right! But Claire, I only want you!"

With his pride already shattered, Lucas had nothing left to lose.

He abandoned all restraint and seized Claire's wrist, pressing her palm against his cheek.

"Claire, go ahead. Hit me if it makes you feel better. Strike me as many times as you need. Just—please, if it brings you back to me, I'm begging you—love me again!"

The crowd around them gasped.

Claire's fingers trembled against his skin, her anger warring with something deeper.

Lucas's eyes burned with unshed tears. "I don't care about dignity anymore. I only care about you."

She wrenched her hand free, her voice icy. "You should have thought of that before."

Then she turned and walked away, leaving him standing there, broken.

The whispers followed her, but she didn’t look back.

Because some regrets cut too deep to forgive.

###Chapter 257 Return to Me

Lucas Bennett never thought he'd sink to such depths of despair.

His crimson-rimmed eyes held the last flicker of hope, like a dying flame refusing to be extinguished.

Claire Dawson was equally stunned.

She could scarcely believe that a man as arrogant as Lucas would discard his pride so completely.

Now, he was ready to give up everything—just to keep her.

As Claire tried to pull away, a familiar voice sliced through the tension.

"Claire."

Julian Mercer's smooth tone was like sunlight breaking through storm clouds.

The golden rays streaming through the window illuminated his sharp features, turning his dark hair into molten bronze.

Claire blinked in surprise. "Julian? What are you doing here? I thought you had rehearsals today."

His gaze softened with worry as it settled on her. "I finished early." His eyes flickered toward Lucas, then back to her. "Are you okay?"

The air between them thickened, charged with unspoken tension.

Lucas's grip on Claire's wrist tightened imperceptibly. His voice was rough, raw with emotion. "We're not done here."

Julian took a step forward, his posture protective. "She said no."

Claire's pulse raced.

She had never seen Lucas like this—broken, desperate.

And Julian—calm, steady, but with an edge she rarely witnessed.

The two men locked eyes, a silent battle raging between them.

Claire exhaled sharply.

This wasn't how she imagined her afternoon would go.

Not at all.

The first light of dawn filtered through the curtains when Claire finally stepped inside.

Julian Mercer stood by the doorway, his usually bright eyes shadowed with exhaustion. "You didn’t come home last night," he murmured, voice rough with fatigue. "I was worried."

Claire’s fingers tightened around her bag strap as she took in the dark circles beneath his eyes. "You waited up all night for me?"

A slow nod was his only answer.

Her chest tightened.

Then, with a tired but warm smile, Julian reached into his pocket. His fingers curled around something small before he stepped closer.

"I got this for you on my way back," he said, unwrapping a lollipop with careful precision. "Strawberry—your favorite. Last one on the shelf. Lucky, right?"

"Very lucky," Claire whispered.

She parted her lips just as he pressed the candy into her mouth. The sweetness burst across her tongue, familiar and comforting, thawing the lingering chill in her bones.

Across the room, Lucas Bennett’s grip on the doorframe turned white-knuckled.

His bloodshot eyes burned as he watched them—watched how easily Julian touched her, how naturally Claire accepted it.

They’ve only known each other a few weeks.

The thought twisted like a knife.

"Waited up all night?"

His jaw clenched.

Are they living together now?

Claire couldn’t possibly be alone with another man. She was still his wife!

Lucas’s frustration surged, an invisible vise tightening around his heart. His gaze burned into Claire with raw desperation. "Claire… come back to me."

She acted as if he weren’t even there, slipping her arm through Julian’s instead. "Shouldn’t you be in class right now?"

Julian’s voice was warm, laced with playful defiance. "I ditched it. Just to see you."

"That’s irresponsible," Claire chided, though her tone held no real bite. As his sponsor, she felt obligated to steer him toward better choices. A glance at her watch confirmed he could still make his afternoon lectures if they left now.

"Come on. My car’s parked downstairs. I’ll take you back to campus."

Julian arched a brow, mischief dancing in his eyes. "Does that mean you’ll sit in on my class with me?"

Claire hesitated, caught off guard.

"Only if you’re free," he added quickly, not pushing.

She exhaled, threading her fingers through his. "Actually, it sounds perfect. We can grab lunch at that bistro near your university afterward."

The dismissal in her voice was clear—Lucas might as well have been air.

Julian’s face brightened with a radiant, sincere smile. "That sounds perfect."

Lucas stood frozen, disbelief etching his features as Claire and Julian turned to leave. "Claire, you're seriously walking away from me like this?"

She glanced over her shoulder, lips curving into a teasing smirk. "Isn’t it obvious? I have a date with my gorgeous young companion."

Lucas’s temper ignited. "I’m still your husband! What is he, if not some opportunistic pretty boy? You throw money at him, and he gives you charming smiles. Do you honestly believe he cares about you?"

The insult in his words made Julian’s jaw tighten. He lowered his gaze, a flicker of wounded pride crossing his expression.

"Claire, snap out of it! Don’t humiliate yourself like this! If you come back to me, I’ll give you everything—my love, my devotion! I can offer you more than he ever could!" Lucas’s voice cracked with raw desperation.

Claire merely arched a brow, unfazed. "He enjoys my wealth, and I enjoy his beauty. A fair exchange, don’t you think? Far better than giving my all and receiving betrayal in return. As for your love… keep it. I’ve lost interest."

She laced her fingers with Julian’s and strode away, leaving Lucas rooted in place as if struck by a curse.

A crushing weight settled over his chest, suffocating him. His hands trembled violently, his vision blurring with unchecked fury and despair.

The pain in Lucas Bennett's eyes was unbearable.

His fingers trembled as they hovered over the phone screen, rereading Claire Dawson's last message for the hundredth time.

The words cut deeper with each glance.

"I can't do this anymore."

A cold emptiness settled in his chest.

The penthouse was too quiet, the city lights outside too bright.

Memories of her laughter, her warmth, haunted him.

He clenched his jaw, fighting the sting behind his eyelids.

"Claire..."

His voice cracked in the silence.

He had been so sure—so damn sure—that she would stay.

But she had walked away without looking back.

His phone buzzed.

A message from Alexander Whitmore.

"You okay?"

Lucas scoffed.

No. He wasn’t okay.

He tossed the phone onto the couch and ran a hand through his disheveled hair.

The truth was a blade twisting in his ribs.

He had pushed her too far.

And now she was gone.

His breath shuddered as he stared at the empty space beside him.

The space where she should have been.

Where she would have been, if he hadn’t been such a fool.

A bitter laugh escaped him.

Pride had cost him everything.

And now?

Now he had nothing.

Nothing but regret.

Lucas closed his eyes, his mind screaming the same desperate plea.

"Claire... what will it take for you to come back to me?"
###Chapter 258 The Fallout

The hospital room door clicked shut behind us, sealing us in suffocating silence. Richard Hayes and Margaret Hayes both turned their furious gazes on Vanessa Hart, their expressions dripping with contempt.

"Vanessa, what in God's name were you thinking?" Richard's voice was a low, dangerous growl. "You and Evelyn are sisters. Do you realize the humiliation you've brought upon our family today? This is unforgivable."

The irony burned. Richard had once defended Vanessa with blind loyalty, shielding her from every consequence. Now, his words felt like a blade twisting in her back.

We had just been unceremoniously ejected from Alexander Whitmore’s private ward.

Vanessa’s expulsion was expected—she had orchestrated this disaster.

But for Alexander to dismiss Richard as well? That was a blow to his pride he hadn’t seen coming.

Richard’s jaw clenched, his face flushed with barely contained rage. Horizon Enterprises had been counting on Alexander’s influence. Now, that hope was ashes.

Vanessa’s eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her lower lip trembling.

"Dad, I—I don’t know what came over me," she whispered, pressing a hand to her chest. "It was like something took control of me. I swear, I never meant for any of this to happen."

Her voice cracked, the perfect picture of remorse.

But the damage was done.

Margaret's brows knitted together in frustration. "Excuse me? You were still arguing your case in front of everyone moments ago! If you had just owned up to it from the start, we wouldn’t be in this humiliating situation."

Vanessa chewed her lower lip, her carefully constructed lies crumbling around her. "I… I don’t know what came over me…"

Margaret’s eyes darkened with disillusionment. She had raised Vanessa for years, only to watch her deceit grow bolder with time.

Richard’s voice cut through the tension. "That’s enough. Vanessa is injured—let’s not make this worse. She needs rest, and we shouldn’t keep her here any longer. Let’s go."

A sharp pang of unease twisted in Margaret’s chest.

"Why is it that every time Vanessa makes a mistake, you’re the first to shield her?" Her voice trembled with suppressed emotion. "Do I not have the right to hold her accountable?"

Richard’s blatant favoritism had always lingered beneath the surface, but now, it was impossible to ignore.

His patience snapped. "I’m not shielding anyone! Are you trying to start a fight with me now?"

The air between them crackled with hostility. Sensing the storm brewing, Vanessa quickly interjected. "Mom, Dad, please—"

But the damage was already done. The cracks in their family had deepened, and this time, they might not be so easily repaired.

Ethan stood outside, cigarette smoke curling around his tense frame. The nicotine did little to calm his racing thoughts.

Inside, Richard and Margaret exchanged venomous looks before reluctantly retreating down the sterile hospital corridor. Their footsteps echoed like distant thunder.

Meanwhile, Ethan remained slumped against the cold concrete wall of the stairwell. The glow of his third cigarette cast flickering shadows across his hollowed cheeks.

The hospital's nighttime hush amplified every sound. Through the partially open fire door, Lucas and Claire's heated argument carried clearly.

Ethan hadn't meant to overhear. He'd been there first, seeking solitude in the stairwell's dim isolation. Their arrival had been unexpected.

The raw emotion in Lucas's voice startled Ethan. This wasn't the arrogant, untouchable businessman he knew. This was a man stripped bare by love and regret.

Fifteen agonizing minutes passed before the tension finally broke. The silence that followed felt heavier than the shouting.

Ethan exhaled sharply, watching the smoke dissipate. He'd never imagined witnessing Lucas Bennett - of all people - begging for forgiveness.

A strange ache settled in Ethan's chest. Not sympathy exactly, but recognition. The kind that comes from seeing your own reflection in another's pain.

The cigarette burned down to his fingers. He barely noticed.

Somewhere beyond the fire door, a single, broken sob echoed through the empty hallway. Ethan wasn't sure which of them it came from.

He lit another cigarette with trembling hands.

The smoke tasted like ashes.
###Chapter 259 The Unspoken Truth

The silence outside was unsettling, making Ethan certain they had finally gone.

Then Vanessa's call flashed on his screen.

Ethan took one look and rejected it without hesitation.

He shoved open the fire exit, only to find Lucas still there, slumped against the wall.

Their gazes locked, and Ethan didn’t miss the raw anguish in Lucas’s bloodshot eyes.

"Lucas."

"Yeah?"

Ethan gave a curt nod and turned to leave, but something tugged at him.

He hesitated, then glanced back. "If you ever need someone to drink with, call me."

Lucas let out a hollow laugh. "You heard everything, didn’t you?"

"Not by choice."

The weight of those words hung between them, heavy and unspoken.

Lucas's eyes darkened with anguish. "Even if you knew, it wouldn't change anything."

"If humiliating myself could bring Claire back to me, I'd do it without hesitation."

Ethan felt a sharp sting of recognition. Seeing Lucas like this made his own emptiness ache deeper.

As a man who had loved and lost, he realized he wasn’t any better.

Ethan thought bitterly, Lucas wants Claire. He’s brave enough to admit it openly. But me? What right do I have?

A self-deprecating smirk twisted his lips.

Inside the hospital room, Vanessa noticed Ethan’s arrival and immediately rose from the bed, her movements careful but eager.

"You’ve been smoking too much."

The scent of tobacco clung to Ethan as he stepped inside, sharp and suffocating.

Vanessa poured him a glass of water, her fingers trembling slightly as she held it out. "Ethan, would you like some?"

He didn’t take it. His gaze, icy and detached, skimmed over her face. "Keep it."

Her breath hitched at the frost in his voice.

Ethan had been acting strangely all morning.

He'd taken the recording device from Evelyn and listened to it himself.

Now that the truth was out and everyone was pointing fingers at Vanessa, Ethan remained unsettlingly quiet.

The silence was deafening, like the eerie stillness before a hurricane.

Vanessa wasn’t foolish enough to bring it up herself.

If Ethan wasn’t asking questions, she certainly wasn’t going to volunteer answers.

Digging her own grave was the last thing she wanted.

With everything exposed, playing dumb was her only option.

The tension in the room was suffocating.

Desperate to shift the focus, Vanessa forced a smile. "Christmas is just around the corner. I’ve already picked out gifts for everyone at the manor."

Every year, the Caldwell family gathered at Whitmore Manor for Christmas Eve.

This year would be no different.

It was always a competition—who had the most lavish presents, the most impressive achievements.

Even though Harold had retired from running Horizon Enterprises, he was still the patriarch.

His approval mattered more than anything.

Vanessa needed to make sure she stayed in his good graces.

Especially now.

Especially after today.

The weight of Ethan’s silence pressed down on her.

She could feel the storm brewing.

And she wasn’t ready for it.

The sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Whitmore Manor as guests arrived for the family gathering.

Ethan Caldwell stood near the grand staircase, his expression unreadable.

As the heir to Titan Capital Group, his presence commanded attention.

Every relative in attendance sought to impress him, offering smiles and carefully crafted compliments.

Ethan remained indifferent, his gaze distant.

Vanessa Hart adjusted the diamond bracelet on her wrist before approaching him.

"I purchased a rare masterpiece for your grandfather," she said, lowering her voice. "A 19th-century landscape from a private auction. It cost me nearly twelve million."

She had married into the Caldwell family only months ago, and Eleanor Whitmore's disapproval was palpable.

Vanessa couldn't afford missteps.

"For your mother, I secured a sapphire necklace from the royal collection," she continued. "And for the others, custom-tailored gifts—each valued over a million."

Her bank account had suffered, but this was necessary.

The Caldwells were elites who recognized true worth.

Anything less would be an insult.

She needed their acceptance.

Desperately.

###Chapter 260: The Unseen Scale

Ethan finally turned his head, his cold eyes meeting hers.

Vanessa held her breath.

"Will it be enough?" she pressed.

His silence was heavier than any answer.

The weight of her spending pressed against her ribs—thirty million gone in a single week.

But what choice did she have?

The Caldwells measured respect in zeros.

And Vanessa refused to be found lacking.

"Ethan, please listen to me! It's not what you think!" Vanessa's voice trembled as she reached out, desperation lacing her words.

Ethan's expression darkened, his jaw tightening. "Not what I think?" He let out a bitter laugh. "Vanessa, I never thought you could be this heartless. To frame Evelyn, you'd throw yourself down the stairs? If you're willing to hurt yourself like this, what else are you capable of?"

His words cut through her like a blade.

"You're trying to make everyone turn against her," he continued, his voice low and dangerous. "She's your sister. You grew up together. How could you be so cruel?"

For a fleeting moment, Vanessa's mind flashed back—three years ago, in this very house.

Ethan had stood just like this, his fury directed at Evelyn when he'd learned about Vanessa's kidnapping.

"Evelyn, you snake!" His voice had been raw with anger. "Vanessa is your sister, and she’s always protected you. How could you send those men after her?"

"Evelyn, I’m disgusted by you. Someone like you doesn’t deserve to breathe the same air as us!"

Back then, she had been the one crying in Ethan’s arms while he raged at Evelyn.

But now, three years later, the tables had turned.

Ethan saw her as the villain.

And Evelyn—Evelyn was the one he believed.

Vanessa’s hands clenched into fists, her nails digging into her palms.

She had played this game before.

But this time, she wasn’t sure she could win.

The realization hit Vanessa like a bucket of ice water.

She was the antagonist now—the scheming woman everyone despised.

Her fingers dug into Ethan's sleeve with desperate strength. "Ethan, please! Just let me explain!"

Maybe it was the pain from her injuries that made her appear so fragile.

Without a trace of makeup, her face was pale, her eyes glistening with unshed tears as she looked up at him.

"Ever since you returned from Cresthaven, you've been avoiding me. You ignore my calls, and it's tearing me apart."

Her voice cracked, raw with emotion.

"Ethan, I'm terrified of losing you. Do you have any idea how it feels? Sitting alone in that empty house, waiting for you to come home, only to spend days without a single word?"

Her words spilled out in a frantic rush, her body trembling as tears streaked down her cheeks.

"I did all of this because I love you. I was afraid Evelyn would steal you away from me. The thought of you two reconnecting—it made me lose my mind. That's why I tried to sabotage her."

Her grip tightened.

"I just wanted you to look at me, Ethan. Only me."

A shaky breath escaped her.

"I know I crossed a line. I regret it. But please believe me—everything I did was out of love. I've never gone this far before."

Her voice dropped to a whisper.

"Don't leave me."

The words tasted bitter on my tongue. "I've never done this before. This is my first time, and it's tearing me apart inside."

"Enough!" Ethan's voice cut through the air like a blade, sharp and unyielding.

He wasn't interested in Vanessa's justifications. She had shamelessly shifted all the blame onto Evelyn, painting herself as the wounded party.

But Ethan wasn't blind anymore. The illusion had shattered.

The way she had thrown herself down those stairs—without hesitation, without fear—spoke volumes. This wasn't an accident. This was calculated.

His voice dripped with disdain. "Love me, love me—is that your excuse for everything?

"Vanessa, you lied about playing the cello, claiming it was for love. Now, you're using that same pathetic excuse again.

"If loving me turns you into this kind of monster, then stop. I don't want it."

Each word was colder than the last, his anger building until it erupted in a near roar.

The moment his voice rose, Vanessa's tears stopped mid-fall, frozen in shock.

Her voice trembled. "Ethan, I already apologized to Evelyn! Why can't you let this go?

"If that's not enough, I'll apologize again. I'll beg—"

But he wasn't listening.

The mask had slipped.

And he finally saw the truth.

"Is this really what you want?"

Her fingers trembled as they clutched at Ethan’s waist, her sobs raw and desperate.

The quiet, broken sounds escaping her lips were like shadows creeping in, her entire body shaking with the weight of her grief.

Under different circumstances, Ethan would have felt his chest tighten at the sight of her like this.

But today?

He simply pulled a tissue from his pocket and handed it to her.

"You’re still recovering," he said, his voice steady. "The doctor said you need rest. Dry your tears and stop crying, Vanessa."

With that, he gently pried her hands away and turned to leave.

###Chapter 261 Unfinished Business

Vanessa's sobs echoed through the sterile hospital room, raw and pleading. "Ethan, don't walk away!"

Her fingers clutched at the sheets, knuckles white. "Is one mistake enough to make you give up on us?"

Ethan exhaled sharply, his voice low. "I just need air."

The door clicked shut behind him, sealing away her hysteria. Relief washed over him—he couldn’t stand another second in that suffocating space.

The hospital corridor was quiet, the fluorescent lights humming overhead. He leaned against the cool wall, lighting a cigarette. The smoke curled around him, dissipating like his patience.

His feet moved on their own, drawn by an invisible force. Before he realized it, he was standing outside Evelyn’s room.

He needed to see her.

There were words clawing at his throat, things he had to say.

Inside, Evelyn slept peacefully, barely a ripple under the thin hospital blanket.

A bitter laugh escaped him. She ruins everything, then sleeps like nothing happened.

The injustice of it burned.

He wanted to shake her awake, demand answers.

But he didn’t.

Instead, he watched her, the rise and fall of her chest, the way her lashes fluttered slightly.

And hated himself for still caring.

His lips parted slightly as he carefully shut the door behind him, the soft click barely audible.

Ethan Caldwell's pulse hammered in his ears, each beat louder than the last.

The room was silent—so silent he could hear the faint rustle of fabric as he moved closer.

Standing over Evelyn Carter’s sleeping form, he studied her delicate features, mesmerized by the way the moonlight traced the curve of her cheek.

His chest tightened, his breath hitching as if his lungs refused to cooperate.

Why does she still affect me like this?

He swallowed hard, his gaze locked onto her face, unwilling—or unable—to look away.

An invisible force pulled him forward, his body moving of its own accord.

Flashes of her laughter, the way her eyes crinkled when she smiled, played behind his eyelids like an old film reel.

A deep ache settled in his chest, one he had buried for years.

The truth hit him with brutal clarity—he had never stopped loving her.

All this time, he had been lying to himself.

It was Vanessa Hart who had twisted his perception, who had made him believe his heart belonged elsewhere.

But now, with Evelyn so close, he couldn’t deny it any longer.

He wanted more.

More than stolen glances.

More than memories.

More than this unbearable distance between them.

Ethan's gaze lingered on Evelyn's soft, inviting lips, but the memory of Alexander having kissed them sent an unexpected pang through him.

A wave of irritation crashed over him. Before he could stop himself, he leaned in, his hands gripping her shoulders firmly.

His eyes fluttered shut as he moved closer, his lips just inches from hers.

At that exact moment, Evelyn's eyes snapped open.

She hadn't been in deep sleep—just a light doze after a peaceful night. She had sensed someone entering but hadn’t bothered to look.

But the warmth of another’s breath so close to her skin sent alarm bells ringing.

When she saw Ethan hovering over her, about to kiss her, instinct took over. Her palm connected sharply with his cheek.

It wasn’t a brutal strike, but it was enough to snap Ethan out of whatever haze had taken hold of him.

Their eyes met, and the disgust in Evelyn’s glare was unmistakable.

That look alone made Ethan’s stomach twist with shame.

Evelyn shoved him back and sat up abruptly. “Ethan, have you lost your damn mind? What the hell do you think you’re doing?”

Ethan Caldwell froze, his pulse hammering in his throat.

Guilt coiled tight in his chest, sharp and undeniable.

He couldn’t understand it—why Evelyn Carter had this power over him, why she pulled him in like gravity itself.

Right now, all he could think about was closing the distance between them.

But it wasn’t just a kiss he craved.

No.

The truth was far more dangerous.

Ethan wanted everything.

###Chapter 262 Your Own Fault

Ethan Caldwell's ears burned with embarrassment, though he'd never confess it aloud.

His fingers fidgeted as he avoided Evelyn Carter's piercing gaze. "Your blanket was slipping off," he muttered, voice strained. "I was just fixing it. Don't flatter yourself thinking I had other intentions."

Evelyn's brows arched in disbelief. "Fixing my blanket? Since when are we on those terms?" She crossed her arms, lips thinning. "Sneaking into my hospital room while I'm asleep? That's not just inappropriate—it's creepy, Ethan."

Before he could retort, the door swung open.

Ryan Fletcher leaned against the frame, phone raised triumphantly. "Oh, this is gold," he drawled, grinning. "Caught red-handed trying to make a move on Evelyn while she's unconscious. Pathetic, even for you."

The frosted glass door had betrayed him—every movement inside clear as day from the hallway.

Ethan's jaw clenched. "Delete that. Now."

Ryan smirked, tucking the phone into his pocket. "Not a chance. Why should I? Because the great Ethan Caldwell demands it?" He tilted his head mockingly. "Maybe I'll send it to Alexander. Bet he'd love to see how you treat his wife."

Evelyn's eyes flashed. "Ryan, don't—"

But Ethan was already lunging forward, fingers curling into fists.

The tension crackled like live wire.

Ethan Caldwell lunged for the phone, but Ryan Fletcher, who had been scrapping with him since they were kids, knew all his moves.

Their fights had always been deadlocked—neither could ever truly overpower the other.

Then, Ryan got an idea.

In one swift motion, he yanked off his belt, threaded it back through his jeans, and shoved the phone down the front of his pants without hesitation.

Evelyn Carter watched, utterly speechless. This is beyond ridiculous.

Ethan’s face flushed crimson with fury.

Ryan smirked, taunting, "Go on, try to take it now. I dare you."

He even rocked his hips slightly, as if egging Ethan on.

Ethan’s jaw clenched, his expression icy.

Ryan had always been shameless, and Ethan knew better than to escalate things further.

Still, frustration burned in his chest. He smacked Ryan upside the head.

Just as the two looked ready to throw down again, Evelyn’s voice cut through like frost.

"If you two want to brawl, take it outside."

The moment Ryan Fletcher stepped into the room, his sharp eyes caught the compromising scene.

"Aunt Evelyn, I came to see how you were feeling after hearing about your illness," he said, placing a tray of fresh fruits on the bedside table. His voice dripped with mock concern.

"Instead, I walk in on this."

His gaze flicked to Ethan Caldwell, who had been leaning far too close to Evelyn Carter.

Ryan smirked.

"And Ethan, if Uncle Alexander ever finds out about this little moment, he’d probably skin you alive."

Ethan’s jaw tightened. Of all people, it had to be Ryan who witnessed this.

Their rivalry was no secret.

Ryan wasn’t about to let this go.

"Ethan, seeing Aunt Evelyn and Uncle Alexander so happy together—does it sting?"

He tilted his head, feigning sympathy.

"Regretting your choices now? Wishing you hadn’t taken her for granted when she was yours?"

A pause.

"Or maybe you still think she should have been yours?"

Ryan’s grin widened.

"But what’s the point? She’s family now, Ethan. Your aunt."

He leaned in slightly, voice lowering.

"Unrequited love? Pathetic. And honestly? You’ve got no one to blame but yourself."

Every word was a calculated strike, aimed precisely where it would hurt most.

Ryan knew Ethan well.

And he loved watching him squirm.

###Chapter 263 The Final Ultimatum

Ryan's mocking words left Ethan utterly defenseless.

For the first time in their lifelong rivalry, Ethan found himself without a comeback.

His fingers clenched into fists at his sides, nails digging into his palms. The truth in Ryan's taunts burned like acid.

He did deserve this.

A desperate longing twisted inside him—if only Evelyn would look at him differently, just once.

So many words had been left unspoken between them. But Ryan's sudden interference had stolen his chance. Now, those confessions would have to wait.

Ethan stormed out of the hospital room, frustration and bitter resignation warring within him.

Evelyn, having sustained only minor injuries, was discharged the next morning.

Vanessa wasn't as fortunate.

A concussion and deep facial bruising kept her hospitalized for seven agonizing days.

Ethan didn't stay by her side.

He arranged for a private nurse to attend to Vanessa's needs before disappearing without another word.

The hospital discharge papers felt heavy in Vanessa's hands.

Despite the doctor's reassurances, unease coiled in her stomach like a restless serpent.

She dialed Ethan's number again—still no answer. The robotic voicemail greeting mocked her growing panic.

Has he blocked me? The thought slithered through her mind. But we just exchanged vows. This can't be happening.

Her designer heels clicked frantically across the marble floors of Willowbrook Apartments. The penthouse smelled stale, untouched.

His Italian leather loafers sat precisely where she'd last seen them seven days ago. Untouched. Unworn.

A chill ran down her spine.

"Where the hell have you been sleeping?" she whispered to the empty living room. The silence swallowed her words whole.

Her trembling fingers scrolled to Grace's contact. The phone rang three times before Ethan's sister answered with audible disinterest.

"Grace, have you seen your brother? He's not picking up."

A derisive snort traveled through the receiver. "Check his office like a normal wife would. Or are you too busy playing damsel in distress?"

The call disconnected before Vanessa could respond.

Eleanor's daughter had never hidden her contempt. Now, with Ethan missing, Vanessa stood alone in their marital home—a gilded cage with no bird in sight.

The grandfather clock in the hallway struck midnight.

Vanessa stared at her wedding ring, its diamonds catching the moonlight. Seven days. Seven days since her husband vanished into thin air.

Vanessa wasn't about to admit that Ethan hadn't stepped foot in their home for weeks.

"With Christmas just around the corner, Grace, I picked out something special for you," Vanessa said, forcing a smile. She needed all the allies she could get.

Grace, still young and sheltered compared to the rest of the Caldwell family, brightened at the mention of a present.

"Please tell me it's not another boring piece of jewelry," she said with a dramatic sigh. "I swear, if I see one more diamond necklace, I’ll scream."

As a Caldwell, Grace had been spoiled with luxury since birth—rare jewels, designer wardrobes, extravagant vacations.

Ordinary gifts barely earned a second glance.

Vanessa’s fingers twitched toward the velvet box in her purse. The custom pearl necklace had cost a fortune, but now it felt inadequate.

She swallowed her frustration. "It’s a one-of-a-kind piece from a designer in Paris. I thought you’d appreciate something unique."

Grace barely looked up from her phone. "Fine. Just bring it to Whitmore Manor on Christmas Eve. No need for a big production."

Vanessa opened her mouth to argue, but the front door slammed open.

Ethan staggered inside, reeking of alcohol, his tie loose and his expression dark.

Vanessa's expression softened with relief as she rushed toward him.

"Ethan, you're completely wasted!"

He brushed past her without a word, staggering toward the bedroom before collapsing onto the mattress.

This had been his routine for the past seven days—drowning himself in alcohol, barely functioning.

Vanessa quickly fetched a glass of water and set it on the nightstand beside him.

When his eyes fluttered open, their gazes met—hers filled with concern, his hollow and distant.

She studied the face she had missed so desperately. "What's wrong, Ethan? Why are you looking at me like that?"

His voice was devoid of emotion. "Vanessa, it's over. I want a divorce."

The words hit her like a physical blow, freezing her in place.

Her lips trembled. "W-What?"

Ethan turned away, shutting his eyes as if he couldn't bear to see her reaction. "I mean it. I can't do this anymore."

Vanessa's hands clenched into fists, her nails digging into her palms. "After everything we've been through, you're just giving up?"

He didn't respond.

The silence between them was deafening.

Her chest tightened, a sharp pain spreading through her. "Tell me why."

Ethan exhaled slowly, still refusing to look at her. "It's better this way."

"Better for who?" Her voice cracked.

"For both of us."

Vanessa swallowed hard, fighting back the tears threatening to spill. "You don't get to decide that for me."

His jaw tensed. "It's already decided."

She wanted to scream, to shake him, to demand answers—but the finality in his tone told her it was pointless.

The man she loved was already gone.

And he wasn't coming back.

###Chapter 264 The Hidden Agenda

The crisp winter air carried the scent of pine as Vanessa Hart arrived at Whitmore Manor before dawn on Christmas Eve.

Her arms were laden with exquisitely wrapped presents, each carefully selected to impress. She moved through the grand halls with practiced ease, distributing gifts to every member of the Whitmore family.

Vanessa had spent weeks planning this moment.

She wanted everything perfect—the decorations, the dinner, even the way she smiled when handing Eleanor her gift.

Sophia Ellis accepted the velvet box with delight, her eyes gleaming. "Grace, your brother has found himself a gem. Vanessa is so thoughtful—arriving at sunrise to oversee preparations, assisting the staff, and remembering every single family member."

Eleanor's lips thinned.

The Whitmores were no ordinary family. As Ethan Caldwell's wife, Vanessa shouldn't be lifting a finger. With one word, she could command an entire household staff.

Ethan was the heir to the Whitmore legacy.

Yet here was his wife, behaving like a glorified maid?

Something wasn’t right.

Eleanor watched as Vanessa laughed too brightly at a servant’s joke, her fingers nervously adjusting the ribbon on another gift.

Why was she trying so hard?

And what was she really after?

Eleanor's nails dug into her palms as she watched the scene unfold. "She's tarnishing our family reputation!" The bitter thought twisted in her mind. "That illegitimate wretch. Even Ethan's status is suffering because of her."

When Sophia carefully unwrapped the velvet box to reveal an exquisite set of handcrafted sapphire jewelry, Eleanor's lips thinned into a razor-sharp line.

"Theodore is Harold's bastard," she seethed silently. "Why waste such luxury on them? Do they even deserve it? Does Vanessa think money falls from the sky? The Caldwells may be affluent, but wealth isn't infinite!"

Her glare could have melted steel as she snapped at Vanessa. "A word. Now."

The moment the study door closed, Eleanor unleashed her fury. "Exactly how much does Ethan allocate for your monthly expenses?"

Vanessa stiffened, then understood. "I purchased the gift myself," she said quietly. "It was meant as a gesture of respect. Not a single penny came from Ethan."

Eleanor's eyes turned glacial. "And what is that supposed to imply? That the Caldwells are miserly? That my son is cheap?"

Vanessa's lower lip trembled, her vision blurring with unshed tears. "I never said—"

Eleanor had always scrutinized her like a flawed specimen. Every visit to Whitmore Manor left Vanessa feeling like an intruder in her own supposed home. The walls seemed to whisper judgments, the chandeliers casting shadows that mocked her efforts.

She swallowed the lump in her throat. No matter what she did, it was never enough.

Eleanor's voice dripped with disdain. "You think throwing money around will make them accept you? That’s not how this family works."

Vanessa's fingers curled into fists. The sapphires had cost her months of savings, but she'd hoped—

A knock interrupted them.

Grace's cheerful voice floated through the door. "Mother? Harold wants everyone for the toast."

Eleanor smoothed her expression, but the venom remained in her eyes as she hissed one last warning. "Know your place."

Vanessa blinked rapidly, forcing her tears back.

As she followed Eleanor out, the weight of the jewelry box in her clutch felt heavier than lead.

What had she been thinking?

No gift could ever buy their approval.

And deep down, she’d always known that.

The rare warmth from Eleanor should have comforted Vanessa.

Yet... Eleanor remained as sharp as ever, a master at uncovering hidden agendas.

"Don't pretend with me," Eleanor scoffed. "I was young once too. I know all the tricks."

"Tears at the slightest provocation. Do you really think I'm as gullible as Ethan? Vanessa, don't assume marriage into the Caldwell family guarantees you anything."

"My son is the heir to the Caldwell fortune. With your background, you're not fit to stand in his shadow. You should be thanking your stars he even married you!"

Eleanor's cutting words left Vanessa speechless—should she defend herself or stay silent?

The old saying about good intentions backfiring had never felt truer.

She was crushed. All she wanted was to find the perfect gifts for the Caldwells, and somehow, she'd managed to anger her mother-in-law instead.

The weight on Vanessa's shoulders had grown unbearable lately, especially since Ethan had mentioned divorce.

How long had they even been married? How had everything unraveled so quickly?

Tears streamed down Vanessa's face as she clutched Ethan's sleeve, her voice breaking with desperation.

"Please," she begged, her words barely audible between sobs. "Don't go. I'll change—I swear it. Just tell me what to do."

Her chest heaved with ragged breaths, the humiliation burning through her like fire. Never in her life had she felt so utterly shattered.

Perhaps it was the raw devastation in her expression that made Ethan hesitate. His jaw tightened, but he didn't speak.

Instead, he gently—yet firmly—pulled his arm free.

Without another word, he turned away, his footsteps echoing in the heavy silence between them.

Vanessa sank to her knees, the weight of her mistakes crushing her.

But why?

Why had it come to this?

###Chapter 265 Unjust

The following two days passed without a trace of Ethan.

Today, Vanessa arrived at Whitmore Manor early. Partly, she wanted to impress the Whitmores. But more than anything, she was desperate to catch a glimpse of Ethan.

It was Christmas Eve, and the Whitmore family was gathering for their annual celebration. There was no way Ethan would miss it.

Just seeing him would ease the restless ache in her chest.

By evening, Evelyn and Alexander had arrived.

Evelyn glowed with contentment, clearly thriving in her new life.

Unlike Vanessa, who had brought carefully selected gifts, Evelyn walked in empty-handed.

The moment they settled on the sofa, a servant appeared with steaming cups of coffee.

Not long after, Harrison approached Evelyn with an elegantly wrapped box. "Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Whitmore asked me to give this to you."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "What is it?"

Her fingers hesitated over the ribbon before she finally untied it.

Inside lay a velvet jewelry box.

Her breath caught as she lifted the lid.

A dazzling emerald necklace sparkled under the chandelier's light, its intricate design unmistakably expensive.

Vanessa's grip tightened around her own untouched coffee cup.

The Whitmores had always favored Evelyn, but this was too much.

Why did she always get everything?

Even now, when Vanessa had gone out of her way to please them, they still only had eyes for Evelyn.

It wasn’t fair.

Not at all.

The winter sun cast long shadows across the marble floors of Whitmore Manor as the family gathered in the grand hall.

"Mr. Harold specially arranged these as Christmas gifts for you," the butler announced, presenting an ornate velvet box to Evelyn. "He mentioned that since it's your first year as part of the Whitmore family, he wanted to express his appreciation as the patriarch. Please accept them."

Sophia couldn’t resist peeking over Evelyn’s shoulder. Her eyes widened in shock. "Oh my God!"

Harold’s generosity knew no bounds—he had gifted Evelyn a sprawling penthouse in the heart of Cresthaven’s most prestigious district.

That single property alone was worth a fortune!

Sophia clutched the edge of the box, her fingers trembling with envy.

Audrey leaned in, her voice laced with amusement. "Alexander, your grandfather clearly adores your wife. We certainly didn’t receive anything this extravagant when we married into the family."

With Harold setting such a lavish precedent, the rest of the Whitmores felt compelled to match his gesture.

The Whitmores were nothing if not competitive, especially under the watchful eyes of their peers. No one wanted to appear stingy.

Audrey swiftly produced a limited-edition designer clutch, its diamond-encrusted clasp glinting under the chandelier light.

Not to be outdone, Sophia presented an heirloom jewelry set—sapphires surrounded by flawless diamonds, passed down through generations.

Audrey’s lips thinned. Without hesitation, she added the keys to a sleek, custom sports car to her gift.

The tension in the room was palpable.

Evelyn stood frozen, her hands full of unimaginable wealth, while the women around her silently waged war through their generosity.

Alexander merely watched, his lips curling into a knowing smirk.

This was the Whitmore way—love, expressed through ruthless competition.

Sophia Ellis, never one to be overshadowed, took things a step further by presenting a rare painting she had just acquired at a prestigious auction.

Evelyn Carter made a quick trip back to Whitmore Manor, and somehow, she returned looking like she had just won the lottery.

In her left hand, she gripped the deed to a luxurious penthouse. Her right hand held the keys to a sleek sports car, along with an assortment of dazzling jewelry. Whatever she couldn’t carry herself, she handed off to Alexander Whitmore.

Even Eleanor, the matriarch of the family, couldn’t stay indifferent after witnessing Audrey Mills and Sophia showering Evelyn with extravagant gifts.

Eleanor had always harbored some discomfort around Evelyn, especially given her complicated history with Ethan Caldwell.

As the leading lady of the Whitmore family, with Audrey and Sophia already displaying their generosity, she knew that if she didn’t contribute, rumors would spread—accusing her of being stingy or hiding ulterior motives.

After a brief hesitation, Eleanor decisively instructed someone to retrieve the million-dollar diamond set Vanessa Hart had gifted her that very morning and deliver it straight to Evelyn.

Vanessa watched in silent fury as the gift she had painstakingly chosen to win Eleanor’s favor was immediately handed over to Evelyn, her face paling with barely contained rage.

Both women had married into the Whitmore family, yet Vanessa had spent years bending over backward to please everyone—only to walk away empty-handed.

Meanwhile, Evelyn strolled in without lifting a finger, empty-handed, yet walked away with a mansion, a luxury car, and everyone fawning over her with extravagant gifts.

How was that just?

Ethan only returned to Whitmore Manor in time for dinner.

He had been holed up in a hotel these past few days.

The moment he demanded a divorce from Vanessa, she had shattered into uncontrollable sobs. He had never witnessed her break down like that before.

In the past, her tears would have twisted his heart into knots. But this time? Nothing. Not a single flicker of emotion.

That was when it hit him—perhaps what he'd felt for her had never been love at all.

The realization settled like ice in his veins.

He had given her everything—years of devotion, wealth, status—only for her to scheme and manipulate behind his back.

And Evelyn? She had done nothing but exist, yet the world handed her everything on a silver platter.

His jaw clenched as he stared out the window, the twilight sky mirroring the storm inside him.

Life had never played fair.

But neither would he.

###Chapter 266 Stop Texting Me

Christmas Eve had arrived, and the entire family was gathered at Whitmore Manor, planning to stay the night.

Ethan Caldwell, knowing full well that Alexander Whitmore and Evelyn Carter would be there, deliberately delayed his arrival until late in the evening.

The thought of seeing them together twisted something inside him, a dull ache settling deep in his chest.

Thankfully, after dinner, Harold Whitmore called Alexander into the study, leaving Evelyn alone.

Fresh out of the shower, Evelyn towel-dried her hair and reached for her phone. A new message blinked on the screen.

[I’m waiting for you in the garden downstairs. We need to talk.]

She recognized the number instantly. Even though she had deleted Ethan’s contact long ago, the digits were seared into her memory.

Evelyn ignored it. Given everything that had happened, meeting him in private—especially here at Whitmore Manor—was reckless. Too many eyes watched, too many ears listened.

Ten minutes later, another message buzzed through.

[Are you coming? It’s cold out here. Bring a coat.]

Her fingers hovered over the screen, torn between irritation and an old, stubborn pull she refused to acknowledge.

But she didn’t reply.

Instead, she set the phone down and walked to the window, peering into the darkness below.

Somewhere in the shadows, Ethan was waiting.

And she had no intention of going to him.

Evelyn frowned, her fingers tightening around her phone.

She moved to the window, pushing aside the sheer curtains just enough to peek outside.

There he was—Ethan Caldwell, standing beneath the moonlight, his gaze fixed on her window.

Their eyes locked for a brief, charged moment before Evelyn snapped the curtains shut.

Her heart pounded as she quickly turned off the lights, plunging the room into darkness.

She typed out a reply with sharp taps: [Go home. I'm going to bed.]

It was only 9:30 PM, but she climbed under the covers anyway, her mind too restless to sleep.

Scrolling through Twitter, she barely registered the holiday trends flooding her feed.

Then her phone buzzed again.

[If you don’t come out, I’ll stay here all night. Evelyn, would you really let me freeze out here until dawn?]

She exhaled sharply, irritation flaring.

Emotional manipulation. Classic Ethan.

She and Alexander were supposed to be enjoying a quiet evening in their cozy guest cottage.

But instead, there was Ethan, lurking outside like some tragic romantic hero.

Unbelievable.

###Chapter 267 The Mistake

The weight of realization crushed Ethan Caldwell.

He felt like the biggest fool alive. All this time, he had been chasing the wrong woman.

Ethan pressed his palms against his face, his fingers trembling as tears escaped. Regret consumed him.

For years, he had drowned himself in reckless indulgence, numbing the pain with alcohol and empty distractions. But in those rare moments of clarity, the void inside him only grew deeper.

He loved Evelyn Carter. He couldn’t let her go.

No amount of liquor could erase that truth.

That was why tonight—with Alexander Whitmore summoned away by his grandfather—Ethan had seized his chance to confront her.

Before arriving, he had downed enough whiskey to blur his inhibitions. There were words he’d never dare speak sober.

But drunk? Nothing held him back.

"Evelyn, come back to me!" The plea tore from his throat, raw and desperate.

Evelyn froze.

Her mind reeled. What did he just say?

"Ethan?" She took a step back, her voice laced with disbelief. "Snap out of it. Look at me—really look. You’ve got the wrong person, haven’t you?"

Confusion twisted her features.

Ethan’s breath hitched. His vision swam, but his heart refused to accept the truth.

He had lost her.

And it was all his fault.

"I recognize you perfectly well! Evelyn! Return to me! Leave Alexander, and I swear I can offer you a far superior life!"

Evelyn stood frozen, her lips parted in shock.

This was insane.

Had the entire universe lost its mind?

The same Ethan Caldwell who once treated her with contempt was now on his knees, pleading for her affection.

"For God's sake, I'm your uncle's wife. Are you listening to yourself? Is this how you address me? What in the world is wrong with you? Did Vanessa betray you?" Evelyn demanded.

After a moment of consideration, this was the only logical conclusion she could reach.

Ethan shook his head violently. "I'm ending things with Vanessa. She's a liar—she manipulated me from the start."

Evelyn was rendered speechless once more.

Ethan and Vanessa had never legally married. Their union had only been ceremonial.

Eleanor had vehemently opposed Vanessa from the beginning. When Ethan stubbornly insisted on marrying her, Eleanor had confiscated his identification documents, refusing to release them.

In families like theirs, it was customary to settle all financial and inheritance matters before formalizing any marriage.

Ethan Caldwell wasn't just any man—he was the heir to the Aniston fortune, with wealth that stretched beyond imagination.

Sorting through his vast assets took time, pushing back their marriage plans even further.

But none of that mattered now—because Ethan no longer wanted Vanessa Hart.

"Vanessa pretended to be you, knowing exactly how much the cellist means to me."

As he spoke, Ethan suddenly seized Evelyn Carter's hand and pressed it against his forehead.

"Evelyn, have you forgotten? That car accident—it was because of you. The head injury, this scar—it's all because of you. Do you remember?"

Beneath her fingertips, Evelyn felt the raised ridge of the scar, and her breath caught.

The accident had left Ethan comatose for weeks, the traumatic brain injury nearly taking his life.

He had driven through a storm to reach her, rain slashing against the windshield. Then, in one terrible moment, he lost control.

The car skidded, slamming into a utility pole. The impact shattered the window, sending a shard of glass flying straight into his skull.

Doctors had removed it, but the wound remained—a permanent reminder of that night.

The jagged scar on my wrist still ached sometimes, a cruel reminder of that night.

Before the accident, Ethan had adored me. His eyes would light up whenever I entered the room. His hands, warm and steady, would always find mine.

But after the crash—everything shattered.

When he woke from the coma, it was as if I no longer existed. His gaze slid past me, landing only on Vanessa. His voice, once so tender when speaking to me, now dripped with devotion for her.

I should have seen it sooner.

The way Vanessa's lips would curl into a smug smile whenever Ethan praised her. The way she'd subtly shift closer to him, her fingers brushing his arm. The way she'd whisper in his ear, her words dripping like poison.

It wasn't love.

It was theft.

Every glance, every touch, every promise that should have been mine—she stole them all.

And I let her.

The realization hit me like a physical blow. My breath caught, my hands trembling.

Vanessa didn't win Ethan's heart.

She stole it.

And I would take it back.

###Chapter 268 No Going Back

The hospital room was too bright, too sterile.

Ethan lay in the bed, his dark lashes casting shadows on his pale cheeks. The machines beeped steadily, a cruel mockery of the chaos inside me.

Vanessa sat beside him, her delicate fingers wrapped around his. She looked up at me, her blue eyes wide with fake concern.

"You should rest, Evelyn," she said softly. "You look exhausted."

I clenched my fists, my nails biting into my palms.

How dare she?

How dare she sit there, playing the devoted lover, when she was the reason for all of this?

I forced a smile. "I'm fine."

But I wasn't.

Because I finally understood—this wasn't just about Ethan.

This was war.

And I wouldn't lose.

No wonder Ethan wanted to divorce Vanessa.

His pride would never allow such deception.

Ethan's voice was ice. "Evelyn, I'll ask you one final time. Three years ago—did you pay those criminals to kidnap Vanessa? Or was it all her own doing, some twisted plan she concocted herself?"

The moment he brought up the past, Evelyn's blood ran cold.

A jagged pain tore through her chest.

That night had haunted her every waking moment.

Those three years in prison had been hell. Some days, the despair was so suffocating, she had considered swallowing the sharp edge of her dinner tray just to make it stop.

Her youth had been stolen from her.

The moldy bread, the bruises from cellmates, the jagged scar on her ankle—they were permanent reminders of a life she could never reclaim.

Evelyn didn't answer. Instead, she met his gaze. "What exactly did Vanessa tell you that night?"

For years, Evelyn had carried this gnawing suspicion in her heart.

After the car accident, Ethan had turned cold, withdrawing from her completely.

The distance between them grew, but she never imagined it would lead to this—him wanting her behind bars.

It was as if, overnight, his gaze had darkened with disgust whenever he looked at her.

She was certain Vanessa had whispered poison in his ear.

Ethan's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Vanessa told me you slept with their leader to control those men."

"So that's it." The realization hit Evelyn like a physical blow.

Back then, they had just been engaged. A man like Ethan, proud and possessive, would never tolerate such a betrayal.

In his eyes, she had orchestrated Vanessa's kidnapping and then betrayed him in the worst way.

The thought must have destroyed him.

"And you believed her?" Evelyn's voice was barely above a whisper.

Ethan's jaw tightened as he gave a slow, heavy nod.

Vanessa had been hysterical, nearly violated by those men. How could he not believe her?

The tension between us was palpable, thick enough to cut with a knife.

Ethan's grip on my shoulders tightened, his fingers digging into my skin. "You never slept with those men, did you? The kidnapping—it was all Vanessa's doing. She set you up. She sent you to prison."

A bitter laugh escaped my lips. "What does it matter now? The truth won't change anything."

His jaw clenched, his dark eyes burning with fury. The realization was crashing over him like a tidal wave, unraveling every lie he had believed for years.

How had he been so blind?

Vanessa had played him like a fool.

"I'll make this right," he growled, his voice rough with emotion.

"Right?" I scoffed, shaking my head. "Three years of my life—gone. The humiliation, the pain—do you really think an apology can erase that?" I met his gaze, my own sharp and unyielding. "And tell me, Ethan, what exactly is your role in all this? Why should I believe you now?"

His expression twisted, torn between guilt and frustration.

But I had already turned away.

Some wounds ran too deep to heal.

Ethan froze at Evelyn’s words.

The moonlight cast long shadows across the quiet garden, painting his silhouette against the stone pathway.

Evelyn met his gaze steadily, her voice calm yet final. "I'm married now, Ethan. There's no going back. You need to accept that."

Without another word, she turned to leave, her heels clicking softly against the cobblestones.

A desperate urgency surged through him.

Before she could take another step, Ethan moved swiftly, blocking her path. His breath came unevenly, his chest rising and falling with unspoken emotions.

Standing against the dim glow of the garden lights, he seemed to dissolve into the night—his shadow stretching long and lonely across the ground.

The silence between them was deafening.

###Chapter 269 What Are You Trying to Prove?

Ethan's voice cracked with emotion, his eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "We had something real, Evelyn. You can't deny what we shared."

"I was a fool back then, blinded by my own naivety. But I've changed. Give me another chance."

His fingers trembled as he reached for her. "I know you still care—"

Evelyn stepped back, her expression unreadable. "You're drunk, Ethan. I'll pretend tonight never happened."

"I'm not drunk!" His voice rose, raw with desperation. "I've never been more clear-headed in my life!"

The wind howled between them, but Evelyn's resolve didn't waver.

Once, she might have fallen for his words. Not anymore.

When he grabbed her wrist, she twisted free and delivered a sharp slap across his cheek. "If you want to self-destruct, do it alone!"

The sound echoed in the silence.

Ethan staggered, his breath hitching.

Evelyn didn't wait for a response. She turned and ran, her heels clicking against the pavement as she disappeared into the night.

Evelyn froze when she felt Ethan's persistent footsteps behind her.

"This is Whitmore Manor. Release me this instant!" She shot him a venomous glare, her entire body trembling with barely contained fury.

Just then, a familiar voice cut through the tension. "Ethan? Evelyn? What's happening here?"

Grace emerged from the garden path, her designer heels clicking against the cobblestones.

Truth be told, she'd been observing their heated exchange from behind the rose bushes for several minutes.

She'd deliberately held back, eavesdropping on every word of their private confrontation.

Never in her life had Grace witnessed her proud brother Ethan grovel like this before any woman.

The same brother who'd always treated women as disposable accessories was now literally begging Evelyn for forgiveness!

While Grace had never particularly liked Evelyn, she despised Vanessa Hart even more.

As a woman herself, Grace found Vanessa's nouveau riche pretentiousness unbearable - that tacky gold-digger aura made her skin crawl.

But hearing how Evelyn had been wronged all those years ago? That revelation hit Grace like a thunderbolt.

Her perfectly manicured fingers tightened around her clutch as she processed this bombshell.

The afternoon sunlight cast long shadows across the manicured lawn, making the scene feel strangely theatrical.

Evelyn took advantage of Ethan's momentary distraction to wrench her wrist free, putting several feet between them.

Grace's sharp eyes darted between them, reassessing everything she thought she knew.

A flock of birds scattered from the nearby oak tree, their startled cries punctuating the heavy silence.

Evelyn straightened her blouse with jerky movements, her breathing still uneven from the confrontation.

Ethan's usually impeccable appearance looked disheveled for the first time Grace could remember.

The entire situation felt surreal - like watching a carefully constructed house of cards collapsing in slow motion.

Grace suddenly wondered if she'd severely misjudged the woman standing before her.

The realization settled in her stomach like a stone.

Perhaps the real villain in this story wasn't who she'd always assumed.

Shock didn't equate to approval.

Ethan Caldwell was spiraling out of control, and Grace couldn't stand by any longer. She stepped between them, her voice sharp with warning. "Ethan, Evelyn is Alexander’s wife now. Are you seriously begging her to take you back? If Alexander finds out, do you even care what happens to you?"

In the Whitmore family, Alexander’s word was law.

His authority was absolute. If he discovered Ethan was trying to claim what was his, the consequences wouldn’t just fall on Ethan—the entire Caldwell branch would pay the price.

Ethan’s expression twisted with conflicting emotions. Seizing the moment, Evelyn yanked her wrist free from his grasp.

"Grace, get your brother out of here," she said coldly.

"Evelyn, please!" Grace grabbed Ethan’s arm, positioning herself as a barrier between them. "Don’t tell Alexander about this. Ethan’s drunk—he’s not thinking straight. If Alexander finds out… you know what he’ll do. He’s already been destroyed by someone like Vanessa. He’s suffered enough. He’s a victim too."

Evelyn’s gaze darkened.

Grace’s plea hung in the air, desperate and raw. But Evelyn had heard enough excuses.

She turned away, her heart hardening.

Some wounds never healed.

And some mistakes couldn’t be forgiven.

Grace's voice trembled as she clutched Evelyn's arm.

"For the sake of what you once meant to Ethan, please let him go. I'm begging you, Evelyn! If Alexander finds him like this, he won't hesitate to break his legs!"

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line, her gaze drifting toward Ethan's face.

His eyes were hollow, his expression blank—like a man who had lost everything.

She had never seen him like this before. The alcohol had dulled his senses, leaving him disoriented and barely coherent.

With a quiet sigh, Evelyn relented. Arguing with a drunk was pointless.

She turned away without another word and retreated inside the house, unaware of the shadowed figure watching from the darkness.

Alexander stood beneath the sprawling oak tree, its thick branches casting him in shifting patterns of moonlight.

Tall and imposing, his sharp eyes narrowed slightly in surprise.

Only when Grace finally managed to pull Ethan away did Alexander step forward, his footsteps silent as he approached the attic.

Inside, Evelyn had just settled onto the bed.

Then—the door creaked open.

Alexander stepped inside, his presence filling the room instantly.

The moment Alexander stepped inside, a cold aura surrounded him. Without uttering a single word, he loomed over Evelyn, pressing her down into the mattress.

His fingers slipped beneath the delicate fabric of her nightgown, gripping the collar tightly before tearing it apart in one sharp motion.

The sudden exposure of her bare skin made Evelyn gasp sharply. Instinctively, she crossed her arms over her chest, her wide eyes locking onto his. "Alexander, what's happening?"

Her voice trembled, laced with confusion and a flicker of fear.

The air between them crackled with tension, heavy and unspoken. His darkened gaze bore into hers, unreadable yet intense.

She swallowed hard, her pulse racing beneath his unrelenting stare.

What had gotten into him?

And why did his touch send both panic and heat coursing through her veins?

###Chapter 270 Handle With Care

Alexander's mouth curved into a smirk, that dangerous half-smile that always preceded something intense, before he crushed his lips against Evelyn's.

The unexpected ferocity of his kiss sent her thoughts scattering.

Though Alexander had always been passionate, this was different—he'd barely stepped through the door before shoving her onto the mattress, his grip unrelenting.

His palms framed her face as he devoured her, teeth scraping her bottom lip just hard enough to sting.

Evelyn gasped, her fingers twisting in the sheets. "Alexander—you're being too rough!"

But he didn't slow.

His mouth trailed down her throat, each searing kiss leaving her skin tingling. Heat pooled low in her stomach, her entire body thrumming with it.

She couldn't think. Couldn't breathe.

This wasn't like him. Alexander was always commanding, yes, but never careless. Normally, he watched her every reaction, adjusting his touch to draw out her pleasure like a musician tuning an instrument.

Tonight, though?

Tonight felt like possession.

Alexander's muscles tensed as he positioned himself for the third thrust. Evelyn cradled his face, her voice breaking as she whispered,

"Alexander... darling, please... be careful with me?"

Her plea came out in a breathy whimper, delicate as morning dew on rose petals.

Beneath him, Evelyn trembled, her fingers curling into his hair.

Alexander's jaw clenched, his restraint visibly fraying.

Normally, the sight of her like this would melt his resolve.

But tonight? Tonight, he needed her to feel him—every inch, every second, until she couldn't think straight.

Evelyn bit her lower lip, her brows knitting in confusion.

Did something happen in Sir Ethan's study earlier? Is he taking it out on me?

No. That didn't fit. Alexander was disciplined, methodical—he never blurred lines like this.

So why did it feel like she'd crossed some invisible line?

Her eyes burned, tears threatening to spill.

The moment Alexander noticed the glassy sheen in her gaze, his grip softened.

He pressed a kiss to the corner of her eye, tasting salt.

"Shh," he murmured against her skin.

His voice was rough, but his touch?

Suddenly, unbearably gentle.

The sight of her tears caught him off guard.

Alexander had believed himself to be the wounded party, so why was Evelyn the one crying first?

He had been delayed, arriving later than intended.

The exact words exchanged between Ethan and Evelyn remained a mystery to him.

But seeing Ethan being hauled away by Grace, looking utterly broken, Alexander could piece together enough—Ethan had drowned himself in liquor tonight and lashed out at Evelyn in his drunken stupor.

A bitter wave of possessiveness crashed over Alexander, threatening to pull him under.

He had overheard Grace whispering to Evelyn, urging her to keep tonight’s events from him.

The exclusion stung.

It was as if the three of them shared a secret, and he was the outsider left in the dark.

So the moment he stepped through the door, he had pulled Evelyn into a fierce, claiming kiss.

He needed to remind her—to remind himself—that she was his.

But now, with her tears spilling beneath him, Alexander’s resolve shattered.

His grip loosened.

The anger drained from him, replaced by something far more painful—regret.

"Evelyn," he murmured, voice rough.

Her name was both an apology and a plea.

He couldn’t bear this.

Not her pain.

Not when he was the cause of it.

"I promise to be gentle, my love. No more tears." Alexander's voice was husky as he cradled Evelyn's face, his lips brushing away the damp trails at the corners of her eyes with aching tenderness.

The next two times, he moved with deliberate care, his touch reverent, as if determined to erase every trace of discomfort.

Evelyn's lashes still glistened with lingering moisture, but soon, the tears were forgotten—replaced by shivers of pleasure that coiled deep within her, building until she trembled beneath him.

Her fingers dug into his shoulders, nails biting lightly into his skin as she gasped, her body arching. She collapsed against Alexander's chest, her cheeks flushed, her breathing uneven.

Night deepened around Whitmore Manor, the grand estate swallowed by silence.

In the dimly lit attic, the air between them grew thick with heat, their mingled breaths the only sound.

Alexander was unusually unrestrained tonight—perhaps the whiskey from the earlier dinner still hummed in his veins.

After what felt like endless waves of pleasure, Evelyn curled into him, boneless and spent.

Alexander nipped at her earlobe, his voice rough with satisfaction. "Tell me, Evelyn. Is there anything you wish to say?"

His question hung in the air, heavy with unspoken meaning.

###Chapter 271 Back to Sleep

The kiss left Evelyn's mind reeling, her thoughts scattered like leaves in the wind. She couldn't quite decipher what Alexander was hinting at.

Pulling him closer, she murmured against his lips, "Darling, you're too intense. Does that answer your question?"

Alexander exhaled sharply. That wasn't what I meant, but she's not entirely wrong.

His gaze darkened. "Anything else you'd like to confess?"

Evelyn nibbled her lower lip, her lashes fluttering. "Could you... maybe let me rest tonight? Please?"

If she counted correctly, this was already the fifth round.

Her body ached in ways she hadn't known possible.

Alexander cupped her chin, tilting her face up until their eyes locked. "Tell me, Evelyn. Who did you see tonight?"

Her breath hitched.

So that was why he'd been acting so possessive all evening.

He already knew.

"Ethan had too much to drink," she admitted softly. "He got a little reckless, but it's nothing to worry about."

The air between them thickened with unspoken tension.

Alexander's grip tightened imperceptibly. "Is that all?"

Evelyn hesitated.

She could feel the storm brewing behind his calm facade.

And she wasn't sure she was ready to weather it.

The rosy flush still lingered on Evelyn's cheeks when she suddenly recalled Grace's warning—that when Alexander lost his temper, he might just snap Ethan's legs in half.

Out of sheer pity, Evelyn murmured, "Please...don't actually break his legs, alright?"

Alexander's gaze darkened instantly, simmering with something dangerous. "Mrs. Whitmore," he said, voice low and rough, "are you begging me for my nephew?"

In a surge of possessiveness, he sank his teeth into the delicate curve of her collarbone, drawing a sharp gasp from her.

The night stretched on, wild and relentless, until Alexander was finally sated. They had pushed each other to the edge, lost in the heat of the moment.

Now curled against his chest, Evelyn traced idle patterns on his skin, whispering soft words until the tension in his body eased.

She wasn’t pleading for Ethan’s sake. No, she just didn’t want to deal with the aftermath—Ethan limping around, using his injuries as an excuse to cling to them like a shadow.

Dawn had barely broken when the shrill ring of her phone shattered the quiet.

Still tangled in Alexander’s arms, Evelyn fumbled for her phone, half-asleep.

"Evelyn," came Vanessa’s voice, thick with tears. "Ethan wants a divorce. Did you put him up to this?"

The last thing Evelyn wanted was to handle Vanessa's drama at this ungodly hour.

She ended the call without another word and burrowed deeper into the warmth of the sheets.

Beside her, Alexander stirred, his voice thick with sleep. "Who was that?"

"Nothing important," Evelyn murmured, pressing closer to him.

No one made her feel as safe as Alexander did. As her husband, he was perfection—flawless in every way.

Evelyn nuzzled against his chest. "Should we get up?"

It was Christmas morning, after all. Sleeping in at Whitmore Manor felt a little indulgent.

Alexander cracked one eye open. "Do you want to get up?"

Evelyn could barely lift her eyelids. She hadn't gotten nearly enough rest.

As if sensing her thoughts, Alexander gazed down at her with that tender, knowing smile of his. "Go back to sleep."

Evelyn hesitated. "But—"

He leaned in, brushing a kiss against the corner of her lips. "Even if the world falls apart, I'll be the one holding it up for you. What's the harm in sleeping a little longer?" His arms tightened around her. "I'm not going anywhere."

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Whitmore Manor as the Caldwell family gathered to exchange Christmas greetings with Harold Aniston before breakfast.

Yet in the quiet attic bedroom, not a single movement disturbed the peaceful silence.

It was nearly midday when Evelyn Carter finally descended the stairs, her dark circles betraying her restless night.

Sophia Ellis opened her mouth to comment, but one sharp glance from Alexander Whitmore silenced her instantly.

Even Eleanor, usually so vocal about propriety, chose to study her teacup rather than challenge her son's unspoken command.

Vanessa Hart had spent the entire night staring at those damning divorce papers, her fingers trembling against the crisp legal documents.

Eleanor had dragged her from bed at dawn, insisting proper ladies rise with the sun on Christmas morning.

Yet no one dared disturb Alexander's sleeping wife.

The double standard burned in Vanessa's throat like bitter coffee.

272

The grandfather clock chimed twelve times as Evelyn shuffled into the parlor, her silk robe whispering against her ankles.

Alexander's gaze softened when he saw her. Without a word, he poured steaming cocoa into her favorite porcelain cup - the one with tiny forget-me-nots painted along the rim.

Across the room, Grace Caldwell's manicured nails dug into her palms.

Harold Aniston cleared his throat. "Shall we exchange gifts now that everyone's... present?"

A log crackled in the fireplace.

Evelyn's fingers brushed Alexander's as she accepted the mug.

Vanessa's champagne flute shattered against the marble floor.
###Chapter 272 Sparkling Night

Ethan had been whisked away by Grace in the dead of night and never returned to his room.

Vanessa had assumed that once they arrived at Whitmore Manor, she would finally get a chance to speak with Ethan properly.

But after dinner, while she helped the staff clear the table, Ethan had vanished without a trace.

Her calls went unanswered. Since stepping foot in Whitmore Manor that evening, Ethan hadn’t uttered a single word to her.

The Whitmore family members were as sharp-eyed as ever, their gazes making Vanessa’s skin prickle with unease.

She couldn’t risk anyone noticing the tension between her and Ethan, so she excused herself early, skipping the Christmas Eve festivities.

At midnight, the sky outside erupted in a dazzling display of fireworks.

While the rest of the household cheered for Christmas, Vanessa paced her room, restless.

The bursts of light were too bright, too intrusive. She moved to the window, staring blankly at the spectacle.

The colors painted the night—gold, sapphire, ruby—each explosion a fleeting brilliance against the dark.

Her reflection in the glass looked hollow.

Where was he?

Grace had taken him hours ago. What could possibly be keeping him away this long?

Vanessa’s fingers tightened around her phone. Still no response.

The fireworks roared, their echoes vibrating through the manor’s old walls.

She should have been downstairs, laughing with the others, pretending everything was fine.

But the act was getting harder to maintain.

A particularly loud burst made her flinch.

For a split second, the room flashed white, illuminating the untouched bed, the packed suitcase, the half-written note on the desk.

Then darkness swallowed it all again.

Vanessa exhaled sharply.

She needed answers.

And if Ethan wouldn’t give them to her, she’d find another way.

The night sky erupted in a kaleidoscope of colors, as if celestial painters had dipped their brushes in liquid gold and silver. Cascading sparks formed intricate patterns overhead, transforming the velvet darkness into a shimmering canvas of light.

A soft rapping sound barely registered against the booming echoes of the fireworks display. Vanessa stood mesmerized by the spectacle, her fingers tracing invisible patterns against the windowpane.

As the final burst of light faded into smoke, she turned - and froze. Ethan stood silhouetted in the doorway, his piercing gaze sending chills down her spine. Vanessa's breath hitched before she forced her lips into a practiced smile.

"There you are, darling. I've been searching everywhere for you." Her voice dripped with honeyed concern as she stepped forward. "Where have you been hiding all evening?"

Every romance novel promised that lovers' quarrels were but temporary storms.

Vanessa had prepared meticulously for this moment. The silk nightgown clung to her curves like a second skin, its neckline dipping dangerously low. The bath oils still lingered on her skin, their floral notes mingling with something more primal.

She knew Ethan would return to Whitmore Manor tonight.

On the dresser sat the unlit candle - her secret weapon. Its exotic fragrance promised to lower inhibitions, to blur the lines between resentment and desire. One spark was all it would take to rewrite their story.

Vanessa understood the depth of Ethan's distrust. This was her last, desperate play.

When his shadow fell across the threshold, her fingers twitched toward the matches. The game had begun.

Her fingers trembled slightly, the lighter clicking uselessly several times before finally sparking to life.

"Leave it if it won't work," Ethan muttered, his voice icy.

Vanessa ignored him, stubbornly flicking it again until a small flame flared up.

In a heartbeat, she threw herself against him. "Ethan, you've been gone for so long. I thought... I thought you didn't want me anymore."

She pressed her face into his chest, her movements delicate, like a fragile bird seeking warmth.

Her hands clutched at his waist, fingers tracing idle patterns against the fabric of his shirt.

"Don't be angry with me, please?" She tilted her head up, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears, emotions threatening to spill over at any second.

The sight of her—vulnerable, pleading—could have softened the hardest heart.

A single tear escaped, trailing down her cheek before landing on his chest, darkening the fabric beneath.

The moment was perfectly crafted.

Scented candles burned softly nearby, their rich fragrance wrapping around them like an invisible embrace.

The air thickened with an exotic, seductive fragrance that sent hormones raging through everyone's veins like wildfire.

Ethan Caldwell's pupils contracted sharply as Vanessa Hart's fingers began working on his shirt buttons. A dark realization dawned in his whiskey-colored eyes.

His attention snapped to the scented candle Vanessa had lit in haste moments ago. With a violent swipe of his hand, the candle clattered to the marble floor, wax splattering like blood.

"Ethan—" Vanessa gasped, her breath hitching.

The scent of expensive cigars clung to Ethan's tailored suit, mingling dangerously with the sharp tang of bourbon—evidence of his earlier drinking.

He seized her jaw with bruising force, his lips curling in a venomous smirk. "Vanessa Hart," he growled, each word dripping with contempt. "Did you really think you could play this cheap whore's trick on me?"

The atmosphere crackled with unspoken threats as the intoxicating perfume continued its relentless assault on their senses.

###Chapter 273 Divorce
Ethan finally saw her for who she truly was, his gaze heavy with disillusionment.

Vanessa smirked, unashamed. "Dirty? We're married, Ethan. Isn't this exactly what you want? Or are you telling me you don’t enjoy it?"

Without hesitation, she rose onto her toes.

Her lips crashed against his, pouring every ounce of desperation into the kiss, as if she could ignite a fire within him through sheer willpower.

Though the candle had long been extinguished, its scent still clung to the air, sweet and suffocating.

Her fingers tangled in his shirt, tugging at the buttons with reckless urgency.

With a sharp shove, she forced him onto the bed, her body pressing flush against his.

Yet no matter how fiercely she tried to provoke him, Ethan remained unmoved.

Vanessa froze.

She bit down on her lip, frustration burning in her chest as she searched his face. "Tell me, Ethan—do I really mean nothing to you?"

Grace had to physically drag Ethan away from the bar. By the time he stumbled back home, he'd drowned himself in three more bottles of whiskey, his vision blurred and steps unsteady.

Now, Ethan lay motionless across the king-sized bed, his sculpted torso bare under the dim bedroom lights. Every defined muscle of his abdomen flexed as he shifted, exuding an intoxicating aura of primal masculinity.

Vanessa bit her lip, her gaze tracing the sweat-slicked contours of his body. Yet despite her deliberate attempts to arouse him—fingers skimming his collarbone, nails grazing his hip—Ethan remained cold as marble beneath her touch.

Frustration bubbled up her throat like bile.

"You're right, Vanessa. There's nothing between us anymore." Ethan's voice was razor-sharp as he sat up abruptly, shrugging into his discarded dress shirt with practiced ease. "We're done."

From his jacket pocket, he produced crisp legal documents still warm from the printer. The divorce agreement landed on the silk sheets with a damning finality.

"I've signed. Now it's your turn." His tone held the clinical detachment of a CEO finalizing a business deal. "Take whatever you want—the penthouse, the stocks, the offshore accounts. Consider it severance pay."

Vanessa's hands shook as she flipped through the pages. The numbers blurred—generous to the point of absurdity. Enough to fund a dozen lifetimes of luxury.

But not a single line about reconciliation.

Ethan was already buttoning his cuffs, his reflection in the floor-to-ceiling windows showing a man utterly devoid of hesitation. The gold-plated pen he offered glinted like an executioner's blade.

Vanessa would never have to worry about her future again.

But with such an extraordinary man standing before her, how could Vanessa simply walk away?

"I refuse to separate! Ethan, I won't sign those papers!" Vanessa screamed, her voice trembling with desperation.

Ethan's lips curled into a mocking smile. "There's nothing to sign. We were never legally married—just a ceremony, and ceremonies don't hold up in court."

His words hit her like a physical blow.

Vanessa went rigid, ice flooding her veins.

Ethan's cold, detached gaze swept over her, devoid of any warmth. "If I truly wanted to be cruel, you'd leave with nothing. Vanessa, accept the truth—when a man stops loving you, that's when he becomes merciless."

She stared at him, shock rendering her speechless. Her mind reeled. "Why? Ethan, are you seriously ending things? Do you feel nothing for me? Not even a little love? How can you say you don't love me?"

His decision had been made. For weeks, he had deliberately distanced himself, needing clarity.

Now, he was certain.

His voice was quiet but final. "Our relationship was built on your lies. Now that the truth is out, so are my feelings for you."

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms as her entire body began to shake, her thoughts scattering like leaves in a storm. "This isn't true!" Her voice cracked, raw with desperation. "Ethan, I refuse to believe you don't love me!"

She stepped forward, her eyes burning with unshed tears. "Have you erased it from your memory? That night—when those monsters took me, and you charged in without hesitation. You bled for me!" Her breath hitched. "If that wasn't love, then tell me—what in hell's name was it?"

The silence between them grew heavier, suffocating.

###Chapter 274 The Night She Spent With a Criminal

Vanessa's mention of the kidnapping from three years ago made Ethan's expression turn to stone.

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Vanessa, that kidnapping—wasn't it all your doing?"

Vanessa recoiled, her eyes widening in feigned shock. "How could you say that? Ethan, did Evelyn poison your mind? Of course she'd deny everything! Have you forgotten? You confronted Damian yourself—he admitted he slept with her!"

At the mention of Damian Cross, Ethan's jaw clenched.

Seizing his hesitation, Vanessa pressed closer, wrapping her arms around him. "Ethan, I know you still love me. After everything we've endured to be together, you can't just throw us away. You're only angry because I lied. I swear, I'll never deceive you again. Please... give us another chance."

Ethan exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. "Vanessa, just sign the papers. This is better for both of us."

Instead of complying, Vanessa snatched the divorce agreement and shredded it with trembling hands.

Ethan didn't react. His gaze remained icy. "Vanessa, this is the second time I've asked for a divorce. By now, you should have accepted the inevitable."

The air between them thickened with tension.

Vanessa's lips quivered. "You can't do this to me. Not after everything I've sacrificed for you."

Ethan's voice was merciless. "It's over."

Her breath hitched. "You'll regret this."

He turned away, his silhouette rigid. "I already do."

The door clicked shut behind him, leaving Vanessa standing amidst the torn remnants of their marriage.

Her fingers curled into fists.

If he thought this was the end, he was sorely mistaken.

"Ethan, please don't go..." My voice cracked as I clutched his sleeve. "Haven't I been a good wife? I've done everything right—respected your family, endured your mother's demands. What else do you want from me?"

Ethan's expression remained cold as he pried my fingers loose. "This isn't about what you've done. It's about what you are." He stepped back, his tone final. "I'll have the papers drawn up by the end of the week."

That night, the Whitmore Manor felt emptier than ever. The echo of the front door closing still rang in my ears as I curled into bed, tears soaking the silk sheets until dawn.

Before sunrise, Eleanor's maid rapped sharply on my door. "Madam says respectable women don't sleep past six during the holidays."

I dragged myself downstairs like a ghost, my reflection in the hallway mirrors pale and hollow-eyed.

Eleanor's lip curled when she saw me. "Vanessa, must you ruin Christmas with that miserable face? Smile, for heaven's sake."

Her ignorance was a small mercy—she didn't know about the divorce yet.

I forced my lips upward, the expression brittle as antique porcelain. "Of course, Mother Eleanor. Shall I check on the breakfast arrangements?"

The words tasted like ash, but I'd play my part until the final curtain fell.

The clock had nearly struck noon when Evelyn and Alexander finally made their appearance.

Both of them looked radiant, their energy restored after a peaceful night's rest.

Though unspoken, the group had their private judgments about Evelyn's tardiness. Yet no one dared voice a single complaint.

Vanessa, however, felt the sting of injustice even more sharply as she compared herself to Evelyn's effortless confidence.

After lunch, preparations were made to leave.

Before heading out, Alexander asked Evelyn to wait in the car while he made a quick stop at the restroom.

This was Vanessa's moment.

Her eyes locked onto Alexander with predatory focus, like a viper poised to strike.

The second he stepped out, she moved swiftly toward him. "Alexander."

He barely spared her a glance, responding with only a dismissive hum.

As he attempted to walk past her, Vanessa dropped her bombshell.

"Did you know Evelyn slept with another man?"

Alexander froze.

His expression darkened instantly.

A sly smile curled Vanessa's lips. She understood men's pride all too well—especially when it concerned their wives.

"You barely know Evelyn," she purred, tilting her head. "Otherwise, you'd realize exactly what she's capable of."

Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper.

"Three years ago, she crawled into bed with a criminal—just to destroy me."

The words hung in the air like poison.

Vanessa watched Alexander's expression carefully, savoring the flicker of doubt crossing his features. She had planted the seed. Now, she only needed to watch it grow.

###Chapter 275 She's Not Virgin

Alexander's lips curled into a chilling smirk at Vanessa's words. "Trying to manipulate me, Vanessa? Do you really think I'm as gullible as Ethan?"

Vanessa had expected his reaction. She tilted her head, feigning indifference. "Believe me or not, it doesn't change the truth. Evelyn has fooled everyone—even someone as sharp as you." Her voice dripped with mock pity. "You can't seriously believe you were her first."

She hesitated for effect, then delivered the final blow. "Evelyn had her hymen surgically restored."

Alexander's expression darkened, his gaze turning unreadable.

Vanessa couldn't tell how much he believed, but the flicker of doubt in his eyes was enough. "The man who slept with her is named Damian Cross. They were in on my kidnapping together." She leaned in, lowering her voice. "Look into it if you don’t believe me. You’ll see—she was never innocent."

Her words were sharp, deliberate, laced with just enough detail to sound convincing.

To her surprise, Alexander suddenly laughed. He adjusted his watch with deliberate slowness. "And?" His tone was dangerously calm. "What exactly are you trying to accomplish?"

Vanessa froze in shock.

"I have her present and her future. Her past doesn't concern me—I wasn't part of it, so I won't interfere."

His voice was calm, unwavering.

"What does innocence even prove? Loyalty? To me, all that matters is that she's mine now. Nothing else."

Vanessa bit her lip, desperation creeping into her tone. "Evelyn approached you deliberately! She's using you for your influence! She just wants you to crush Ethan. How could a man like you tolerate being her pawn?"

Who was Alexander Whitmore?

A man like him would never accept being manipulated.

Vanessa couldn’t stand seeing Evelyn happy with him—not when Ethan had discarded her.

If she had to suffer, then Evelyn should too.

She wanted Alexander to despise Evelyn just as Ethan despised her. That way, they’d both be equally humiliated.

"Evelyn is cunning. Even if you don’t care about her past, her motives are impure. I can’t bear to watch her play you for a fool."

"Enough." Alexander lifted a hand, cutting her off. His gaze turned icy. "Vanessa, did you not hear a word I just said?"

Vanessa froze, her breath catching as Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto her.

"I'm nothing like Ethan Caldwell." His voice was ice-cold, dripping with disdain. "Your words mean nothing to me. And besides—" His lips curled into a mocking smile. "What makes you think I mind being Evelyn's pawn?"

Vanessa's entire body went rigid, her blood running cold.

Alexander regarded her with detached amusement, as if she were nothing more than an insignificant speck.

For a fleeting moment, something softened in his expression. A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. "Someone like you could never understand the privilege of being used by the woman you love."

His voice was thick with devotion, his eyes glazed with adoration—completely, hopelessly consumed by thoughts of Evelyn.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms. Has Alexander Whitmore lost his mind?

Without another word, he turned and walked away, leaving her standing there, forgotten.

Vanessa bit down on her lip so hard she tasted blood. Her face paled, the bitter realization settling in like poison.

###Chapter 276 Perilous Game

"Why? Why does Evelyn get everything handed to her without even trying?" Vanessa seethed under her breath, her manicured nails digging into her palms. "Ethan wants to divorce me for that country bumpkin, and now Alexander is completely obsessed with her! What does she have that I don't?"

The bitterness in Vanessa's chest burned like acid. "She doesn't deserve any of this!"

As Alexander turned to leave, Vanessa rushed after him, her designer heels clicking urgently against the marble floor.

"You claim her past doesn't matter," she called out, voice dripping with false concern. "But what if she continues her... indiscretions after marriage? Evelyn has been seeing someone else. Did you know that?"

Alexander froze, his broad shoulders tensing visibly. Slowly, he turned, his icy gaze making Vanessa's breath hitch.

Vanessa was certain Ethan's sudden divorce demand stemmed from Evelyn's manipulation. The scheming little gold-digger wanted both men wrapped around her finger. "Disgusting," she thought.

A dark chuckle escaped Alexander's lips. "Interesting. And who might this... lover be?"

Vanessa wasn't stupid enough to name Ethan directly. That would be like setting her own house on fire. Instead, she offered a calculated smile. "Wouldn't you like to know?"

If Ethan faced Alexander's wrath, Vanessa knew she'd be caught in the crossfire.

A calculating gleam flashed in Vanessa's eyes within seconds. "Have you heard of Damian Cross? He's the criminal who abducted me. Evelyn still keeps in touch with him! Don't take my word for it—investigate! I promise you'll uncover something explosive!"

"Damian Cross?"

An arctic chill radiated from Alexander, colder than the deepest winter storm.

Even standing beside him, Vanessa could feel the icy tendrils of his fury.

But as his expression darkened, a thrill of satisfaction coursed through her.

The thought of Evelyn's impending downfall curled Vanessa's lips into a smirk. "That's right! Damian Cross! He's Evelyn's secret lover!"

Alexander took a slow, deliberate step forward, his gaze like a predator emerging from the shadows—ruthless, unfeeling, and utterly terrifying.

Vanessa's blood turned to ice.

"Do you have a death wish?" Alexander's voice was lethally soft. "Do you even comprehend who Evelyn is, yet you dare spread such filth about her?"

Alexander's dominating aura made Vanessa retreat until her spine met the unyielding wall.

"I gave Evelyn my full trust the moment I married her. Secretly investigating her?" His voice dripped with disdain. "Do you think everyone operates like you—skulking in the shadows, weaving poison with that twisted mind of yours? I couldn’t care less who Damian Cross is!"

"Vanessa, you’ve only just married into the Whitmore family, so you might not understand how I operate." His smile was razor-sharp. "Ask Eleanor how I erased her husband from this family in mere days."

"And someone like you?" A dark amusement flickered in his gaze. "Crushing you would be easier than stepping on an insect. Test me again, and I’ll carve out that lying tongue myself."

A wave of primal terror crashed over Vanessa, her skin prickling with cold sweat.

Alexander, usually the epitome of controlled elegance, now resembled something carved from nightmares.

When he said "carve out her tongue," Vanessa caught the glint of something feral in his eyes—a predator savoring the hunt.

She knew the Whitmores feared him, but she’d never understood why—until now.

What had he done during those years at the border police academy to make them tremble at his name?

He was clearly no stranger to dealing with dangerous men.

A man like Alexander Whitmore had faced countless adversaries.

His methods were ruthless, his strategies flawless.

Vanessa Hart knew she was playing with fire.

One wrong move, and she'd be burned.

The thought sent a chill down her spine.

She had underestimated him before—never again.

His reputation wasn't built on empty threats.

Every rumor she'd heard about him was true.

He didn't just win battles—he destroyed his enemies.

And now, she had made herself his target.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched her phone.

She needed a plan.

A way out.

But escape wasn't an option anymore.

Not when he had already set his sights on her.

The game had changed.

And she was no longer the hunter.

She was the prey.

###Chapter 277 Jealous

The air grew thick with tension as Alexander's imposing presence filled the room. Vanessa could barely breathe under his crushing glare. Her knees trembled violently, threatening to give out beneath her.

She knew without a doubt—Alexander wasn’t bluffing.

He would tear out her tongue without a second thought.

Vanessa was stunned by the sheer intensity of his protectiveness over Evelyn. He wouldn’t tolerate even the slightest insult directed at her.

Alexander didn’t waste another second. The moment he turned away, Vanessa collapsed onto the cold marble floor, her body weak with fear.

She had never experienced such suffocating terror before.

Biting her lip hard enough to draw blood, she refused to accept defeat.

"Absolutely not." Vanessa dragged herself to her room, locking the door behind her. With shaking hands, she dialed a number. "Hello, Damian?"

Meanwhile, Evelyn watched as Alexander strode out of Whitmore Manor, a flicker of confusion crossing her gaze.

"Why were you gone so long?" Evelyn questioned, her voice laced with concern.

Alexander's jaw tightened, his stormy gaze darkening.

Without a word, he yanked her into the car, pulling her roughly onto his lap. His grip was ironclad, trapping her against him.

The atmosphere turned electric with tension, thick enough to choke on.

Before Evelyn could process his actions, his mouth claimed hers in a bruising, desperate kiss. It was wild, untamed—a storm of hunger and barely restrained fury.

Her thoughts scattered, her body stiffening in shock.

What the hell is wrong with Alexander?

"Mm—Alex—!" she gasped against his lips.

"Don’t speak," he growled, his voice rough. "Right now, I just need to feel you."

Normally, Alexander was the epitome of control—cold, composed, unshakable.

But not tonight.

Vanessa’s games shouldn’t have gotten to him. Yet beneath the surface, something primal had snapped.

Possessiveness. Jealousy. A fire he couldn’t extinguish.

The kiss deepened, turning savage. He devoured her like a man starved, as if he could erase every trace of anyone else who dared to linger in her thoughts.

Evelyn’s pulse hammered, her breath stolen by the sheer intensity of him.

She had never seen him like this—unhinged, desperate, needing.

And it terrified her.

Because for the first time, she realized just how deep his obsession ran.

Evelyn's lips were kiss-swollen, a deep crimson that matched the flush spreading across her cheeks.

The air inside the car grew thick, charged with tension. Just as Evelyn felt lightheaded from lack of oxygen, Alexander finally pulled away.

He pressed his forehead against hers, his jaw clenched so tight she could see the muscle twitching. "Who the hell is Damian?" His voice was low, dangerous. "First Ethan, now him? Mrs. Whitmore, you seem to have quite the fan club."

Evelyn blinked up at him, feigning innocence.

Alexander exhaled sharply. "Are you trying to drive me insane with jealousy?"

"Damian is like family to Sophia," Evelyn explained quickly. "There’s nothing between us."

"Ten minutes ago, Vanessa told me you and Damian had history."

"And you believed her?"

"Of course not."

"Then why are you—"

"Because hearing another man’s name next to yours makes me want to punch something." His hands framed her face, tilting her chin up before claiming her mouth again in a searing kiss.

His tongue swept in, possessive and demanding, leaving no space for argument—only heat.

Evelyn's pulse raced wildly, beyond her control. The kiss was electrifying, so intense it threatened to steal her breath away.

When their lips finally parted, Alexander pulled her flush against him, his grip firm and possessive.

"You belong to me," he whispered, his voice rough with emotion.

Pressed against his chest, Evelyn listened to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. A warmth spread through her, softening her defenses.

He seemed to crave these moments of closeness as much as she did.

"Could it be… he actually cares for me?" The thought sent a flutter through her stomach.

Embarrassed by her own hopefulness, she buried her face deeper into his embrace.

For the first time in her life, Evelyn felt truly wanted—cherished in a way she'd never known before.

There was something undeniably magnetic about Alexander. Whenever he was near, an unshakable sense of safety wrapped around her like a shield.

Yet the question lingered in the back of her mind—who was Alexander Whitmore, really?

###Chapter 278 A Call From Richard

The sheets still held his warmth when he left. Alexander could be scorching between silk sheets yet ice-cold in boardrooms. The same hands that traced constellations on Evelyn's bare back signed corporate death warrants without blinking.

How did this man—who whispered poetry into her hair at dawn—command such terror from the entire Whitmore dynasty? Evelyn's fingers tightened around her coffee cup. She knew the charming facade hid depths even she hadn't plumbed.

Her phone shattered the silence.

"Evelyn." Richard Hayes' voice carried the weight of decades-old disappointment. "Christmas Eve dinner. Your mother's making crown roast." A calculated pause. "Oliver flew in from Geneva."

The mention of her brother stayed Evelyn's finger over the 'end call' button. Oliver was four years younger, the only Hayes who'd smuggled birthday cakes into her attic bedroom.

Maple syrup sunlight pooled across the kitchen island as memories surfaced—Oliver's thirteen-year-old hands bandaging her scraped knees after Vanessa "accidentally" pushed her down the marble stairs.

"Tell Mom..." Evelyn watched Alexander's tailored silhouette through the glass doors as he barked orders into his headset. "...I'll bring dessert."

The lie tasted bitter. She wouldn't step foot in Hawthorne Estate without Alexander's security detail. Not after last Thanksgiving's "knife incident" with Vanessa.

Her phone buzzed again—a Geneva area code. Oliver's text glowed: Bring that husband of yours. I want to see if he flinches when I test the silverware for poison.

Evelyn's laugh startled the passing housekeeper. Some bonds even Richard's manipulations couldn't tarnish.

The phone screen lit up with an all-too-familiar name.

Evelyn hesitated before answering, her fingers hovering over the call button.

Richard Hayes.

Her father.

The man who had once turned his back on her when she needed him most.

She exhaled sharply and swiped to accept the call.

"Evelyn, darling," Richard's voice oozed false warmth. "It's been too long."

She clenched her jaw.

Three years.

Three years since she had walked away from the Hayes family.

Three years since they had chosen reputation over her.

"Mr. Hayes," she said coolly. "What do you want?"

Richard chuckled, undeterred by her tone. "Now, now, is that any way to speak to your father? It's Christmas. The family misses you. Oliver especially."

Oliver.

Her younger brother.

The only person in that house who had ever truly cared for her.

But Oliver had been abroad when everything happened.

If the Hayes family had kept him in the dark, he might not even know the truth of what she had endured.

Not that it mattered.

She had no intention of returning to Hawthorne Estate.

If she wanted to see Oliver, they could meet anywhere—a café, a park, anywhere but that gilded cage.

She knew Richard's real motive.

This wasn’t about family.

This was about Alexander Whitmore.

Her husband.

And the power and connections he represented.

"Mr. Hayes," Evelyn repeated, her voice steady. "I cut ties with the Hayes family a long time ago. Oliver is no longer my brother. Whatever business you have with me—or with Alexander—ends here. Don’t call me again."

Richard sighed dramatically. "Sweetheart, I’ve already apologized. How long are you going to hold onto the past? It’s been years. You need to move forward, not dwell on petty grudges."

Petty.

As if betrayal could ever be petty.

"Come home," Richard pressed. "We’re family. Blood binds us, no matter what. It’s Christmas. We should be together. Besides—" His voice dropped, laced with false sincerity. "There’s something important I need to discuss with you."

Evelyn’s grip tightened around the phone.

She knew that tone.

It was the same one he had used before dropping life-altering "news" on her in the past.

"Goodbye, Mr. Hayes," she said flatly.

Then she ended the call.

Evelyn didn't bother responding. She ended the call with a sharp tap of her finger.

What was the point of this hollow, staged family reunion?

On the other end, Margaret studied Richard's stormy expression. "So, Evelyn still refuses to come home?"

Richard clenched his jaw. "That girl! She's always been stubborn. Oliver was the only one she ever listened to, and now even with him back, she won’t set foot in this house. Ungrateful!"

The young man lounging on the sofa stiffened at the words. His dark brows drew together. "Ungrateful?" Oliver's voice was dangerously soft. "After everything you’ve done to her, you dare call her ungrateful?"

Oliver Hayes had the kind of striking features that commanded attention—thick, tousled hair, a blade-sharp nose, and eyes that glittered like frost under moonlight. Right now, those eyes were locked onto Richard with icy disdain.

Richard swallowed hard, wisely choosing silence. The last thing he needed was his volatile son storming out.

Just then, Vanessa swept into the room, clutching a gaudy gift box. "Oliver, darling! I heard you were back. I picked this out just for you!"

Oliver didn’t even look at her. "Did I just hear you call yourself my sister?"

Without another word, he shoved to his feet and strode out, leaving Vanessa clutching her unopened gift, her smile frozen in place.

Vanessa's cheeks burned with humiliation.

Richard attempted to diffuse the tension, saying, "He's still young and doesn't understand. Vanessa, give him a break."

"Young?" Vanessa nearly scoffed aloud.

Oliver was already twenty-one—far from a child.

The audacity of his behavior made her blood boil.

She clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

Richard’s dismissive tone only added fuel to the fire.

Vanessa exhaled sharply, forcing herself to remain composed.

She wouldn’t let Oliver’s immaturity get under her skin.

Not again.

Not when she had far more important matters to deal with.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket, a welcome distraction.

She pulled it out, glancing at the screen.

A message from Alexander.

Her pulse quickened.

Whatever he had to say, it had to be better than this pointless argument.

She turned away without another word, leaving Richard and Oliver behind.

The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife.

But she refused to be the one to break first.

Not this time.

Not ever again.

Vanessa's blood boiled with rage, but she kept her expression carefully neutral.

Richard had always preferred sons over daughters. Over the years, Vanessa had only dared to bully Evelyn, never Oliver.

Oddly enough, it was as if they were destined to clash. Even before Evelyn was brought back into the family, Oliver had never gotten along with Vanessa.

Margaret glanced behind Vanessa and raised an eyebrow. "Vanessa, it's Christmas. Why didn't Ethan come back with you?"

At the mention of Ethan, Vanessa's face tightened.

She forced a smile. "The Caldwells have so many relatives. Ethan couldn’t get away right now. He promised to visit in a few days."

Margaret let out a soft, mocking laugh. "Couldn’t get away? We’re his in-laws! And this is your first Christmas as a married couple. Has he already forgotten about you?"

Vanessa’s irritation flared. How could she possibly admit that Ethan was in the middle of divorcing her?

Just then, something hard pressed uncomfortably against her back.
###Chapter 279 Kidnapped Once More

Vanessa's gaze dropped subtly, then her eyes sparkled with sudden recognition.

"Isn't this Oliver's phone?" she murmured under her breath.

A wicked idea flashed through her mind, igniting a dangerous glint in her eyes.

That evening, Evelyn received a text from Oliver, requesting to meet.

Of course, she didn’t refuse.

The following day, Evelyn arrived at the designated café, only to find Vanessa waiting instead of her brother.

"Vanessa," Evelyn's voice turned icy in an instant. "You stole Oliver’s phone to lure me here?"

Realizing the trap, Evelyn spun on her heel to leave.

But before she could reach the exit, Vanessa seized her wrist and yanked her into the shadowed alley behind the café.

"Evelyn!" Vanessa’s voice was shrill with hysteria. "You’re already married to Alexander! Why are you still stealing Ethan from me? He wants a divorce—because of you!"

Evelyn met her frenzied stare calmly. "You dug this grave yourself, Vanessa. Did you really think Ethan would forgive betrayal?"

Vanessa's eyes burned crimson. The terror she'd endured these past days flooded back, igniting a firestorm of rage. "That night I begged you not to play," she seethed, fingers curling into fists, "why did you defy me?"

Evelyn stared, baffled. "You're shifting blame because your lies collapsed? Why fabricate such a story at all?"

A venomous laugh escaped Vanessa. "Spare me the debate. Do you know why you're here?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Remember Damian?"

The name struck Evelyn like ice water.

Vanessa lunged, nails biting into Evelyn's shoulders. "Three years ago, I told Ethan you slept with Damian to control him." Her lips twisted. "Guess how he reacted?"

She leaned closer, breath hot. "No man forgives betrayal, Evelyn. Now imagine—if Alexander and Ethan saw you defiled today, would they both snap?"

Her grip tightened. "Would Alexander discard you? Relive that hell—when everyone called you a monster. When no one believed you."

The warehouse walls seemed to pulse with her words. Somewhere, a pipe dripped like a ticking clock.

Vanessa's smile was all teeth. "Let's find out."

Vanessa's sudden shift into madness sent a shiver down Evelyn's spine.

Her fingers trembled as she took an instinctive step back. "What are you planning?"

Only then did Evelyn notice the alley entrance had been sealed off—blocked by a wall of burly men with cold, calculating eyes.

The realization struck her like ice water.

This wasn’t like three years ago, when Vanessa had orchestrated her own staged abduction.

This time, Evelyn was the one being taken.

And there was no escape.

###Chapter 280 Both Kidnapped

The narrow alleyway was shadowed by tall buildings, casting long dark shapes across the cracked pavement. At the far end, a group of men stood waiting, their figures silhouetted against the dim streetlight.

As Evelyn Carter and Vanessa Hart approached, the men shifted, their attention locking onto them.

"Which one's Evelyn?" one of them muttered, squinting.

"How the hell should I know?" another snapped.

Vanessa's eyes darted toward Evelyn, then she quickly pointed. "That's her! That's Evelyn!"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. She turned sharply, disbelief twisting her features. "Are you insane? I'm not Evelyn! She is!"

The men advanced, their heavy boots scraping against the pavement. Evelyn's pulse spiked. This was spiraling out of control.

Idiots. How could they mistake me for her?

"I'm not Evelyn!" she shouted, desperation sharpening her voice.

A sudden, brutal impact struck the back of her skull. Darkness swallowed her before she could even gasp.

Relief flickered through Vanessa—until one of the men grunted, "Take her too. Just in case we grabbed the wrong one. One of them has to be the right one."

Vanessa barely had time to think of running before rough hands seized her. The world went black.

Darkness swallowed Evelyn's vision as a rough hood was yanked over her head. Strong arms shoved her into the back of a van, the door slamming shut with a metallic clang.

The vehicle lurched forward, jolting her body with every turn. After what felt like hours, the hood was finally torn away, revealing the dim interior of a decaying factory.

Rusted machinery and broken crates littered the space, the air thick with dust and the scent of mildew.

Evelyn's pulse spiked.

She knew this place.

Three years ago, Ethan had found Vanessa here.

A sharp gasp drew her attention.

Vanessa sat beside her, wrists bound, eyes blazing with fury.

"Are you all blind?" she shrieked, thrashing against her restraints. "I'm not Evelyn! She is!"

Her voice bounced off the crumbling walls, drawing irritated glances from the men playing cards nearby.

One of them, a burly figure with a scarred cheek, stood abruptly and backhanded her.

"Shut your mouth," he growled. "You're ruining my luck."

Vanessa recoiled, stunned.

Her mind raced.

Damian hired absolute morons. How could they mistake me for her?

"Bring Damian here!" she demanded, voice trembling with rage. "He'll make you regret this!"

The men ignored her, returning to their game as if she hadn't spoken.

Evelyn stayed silent, scanning the room for any sign of weakness.

But Vanessa wasn't done.

"Listen to me, you fools!" she spat. "Do you even know who you're working for?"

Another man, this one with a cigarette dangling from his lips, sighed and flicked ash onto the floor.

"Boss said to grab the blonde. That's what we did."

Vanessa's face twisted in disbelief.

Unbelievable.

She was going to kill Damian for this.

"Damian, huh?"

The brute sneered, his lips curling into a cruel smirk. "Who the hell is Damian? That loser owes our boss a mountain of debt. He crawls at our feet—wouldn’t even qualify to lick our boots clean."

Vanessa’s breath hitched, her pulse roaring in her ears. The realization struck her like a physical blow.

"You—you’re not Damian’s men?"

"Not a chance in hell."

The leader stepped forward, the jagged scar across his cheekbone catching the dim light. The cobra inked on his forearm seemed to coil tighter as he flexed his muscles.

Vanessa’s stomach twisted.

This isn’t about Damian at all.

They had mistaken her for Evelyn.

"Then who are you?"

A phone was shoved into her trembling hands.

"Unlock it. Call your man. Tell him to gather twenty million in cash—untraceable bills. No tricks."

The pieces clicked into place.

She wasn’t just taken—she’d been sold.

Damian had traded her like collateral, and now these vultures saw a golden opportunity.

Evelyn’s name was the key to a fortune.

And Vanessa?

She was the unlucky bait.

Vanessa was genuinely terrified now—this wasn't some staged drama. She had never been in real danger before.

All she had wanted was to teach Evelyn a lesson, to make her suffer just a little. But now, she was trapped in this nightmare alongside her.

The sting of the slap still burned on her cheek, and the uncertainty of what came next made her hands tremble. Without hesitation, she snatched up the phone and dialed Ethan.

Evelyn watched, her expression icy and detached.

This is perfect, Evelyn thought. Vanessa finally bit off more than she could chew. These aren’t Damian’s men—this situation has spiraled beyond her control. At least she’s the one losing her mind right now, not me.

Outside, the sky darkened unnaturally fast. It was barely five, but winter nights swallowed daylight whole. Shadows stretched long and ominous, creeping closer with every passing second.

###Chapter 281 Silent Treatment

The Eclipse Lounge was bathed in moody amber lighting, the low murmur of patrons blending with the occasional clink of ice against glass. Ethan Caldwell sprawled lazily in the leather booth while Trevor Moss studied him from across the table.

Trevor tapped his cigarette against the ashtray before taking a slow drag. The smoke curled around his face as he exhaled. "So, Ethan. You're really ending things with Vanessa?"

He leaned forward, voice dropping. "Let's be honest—you never should've married her. The whole of Cresthaven watched Evelyn chase you for seven years. You were engaged, for God's sake. Then suddenly, Vanessa waltzes in and—"

A bitter chuckle escaped him. "Your marriage was a farce from day one. She was just a glorified mistress, and now the entire city's whispering about it."

His expression turned serious. "But if you divorce now? It'll be a scandal. The great Ethan Caldwell, reduced to Cresthaven's favorite punchline."

Ethan remained silent, the smoke from his cigarette weaving a hazy barrier between them.

Trevor wasn't wrong.

Let them talk.

He didn’t care.

Not when his life was already in shambles.

The smoke curled around Ethan Caldwell's fingers as he took another slow drag. His expression remained unreadable, the dim light casting shadows across his sharp features.

Trevor Moss, sitting across from him, exhaled sharply. "You really don't care what people think, do you?"

Ethan didn't respond immediately. His gaze was distant, fixed on some unseen point beyond the haze of smoke.

Trevor lit another cigarette for him, the flame flickering briefly before he leaned back in his chair. "So, Ethan," he pressed, "what's the real reason you're divorcing Vanessa? Did you just… fall out of love?"

A beat of silence.

Then, so quiet it was almost lost beneath the hum of the bar, Ethan murmured, "The woman I love is Evelyn."

Trevor froze. His cigarette nearly slipped from his fingers.

Ethan just admitted he loves Evelyn?

His mind reeled. She chased him for years, and he barely glanced her way. And now—what? Pride? Or is this some twisted realization after losing her?

Trevor had suspected Ethan's feelings for a while, but hearing it aloud still sent a jolt through him. "So, she's married to Alexander now, and you're divorcing Vanessa just for her?" He hesitated, then added carefully, "Isn't that a little…"

You did this to yourself.

He didn't finish the sentence. The icy glint in Ethan's eyes warned him not to push further.

Trevor exhaled, shaking his head. Some truths were better left unspoken.

"Fine, but what about Vanessa? She won't agree to sign, will she?"

Ethan gave a careless shrug. "We were never legally married to begin with."

Trevor's eyes widened in shock.

As darkness settled in, Ethan's phone buzzed to life.

Vanessa's name flashed across the screen.

He barely spared it a glance before swiping to reject the call.

Victor Kane, the man with the jagged scar running down his cheek, watched the call get dismissed with a sneer.

"Your so-called husband isn't exactly husband of the year material, huh? You call, and he can't even be bothered to answer?"

Vanessa's teeth sank into her lower lip hard enough to draw blood, her vision blurring with unshed tears.

She had expected Ethan to ignore her—had braced herself for it—but a tiny, foolish part of her had still hoped for something different.

Victor unbuckled his belt with deliberate slowness. "Money makes the world go round, sweetheart. But without it..."

Vanessa's face drained of color. "I'll call again! Just—don't come any closer!"

Vanessa's trembling fingers dialed Ethan's number again, only for him to reject the call immediately.

Tears blurred her vision as she tried a third time, but Victor had reached his limit. He snatched the phone from her grasp and flung it across the room.

"Enough of this!" Victor barked. "I'm not wasting another second!"

He jerked his chin at the men behind him. "I go first. The rest of you can wait your turn."

Vanessa's blood ran cold at his words.

Panic clawed at her throat as the men advanced. In desperation, she pointed toward Evelyn, who sat frozen in the corner.

"Take her instead!" Vanessa shrieked. "She's untouched! She's never been with anyone!"

Victor's eyes gleamed with sudden interest. He turned slowly, a wolfish grin spreading across his face.

"A virgin?" He licked his lips. "Now that's something new. Let's see what all the fuss is about."

###Chapter 282 Which One Is Your Wife?

Victor Kane gripped Evelyn Carter's chin, his dark eyes widening with sudden fascination as he studied her delicate features. "Well now, aren't you a sight? That porcelain skin... so flawless..."

Seeing Victor's growing interest in Evelyn, Vanessa Hart exhaled in quiet relief.

At least things are still going according to plan, she thought. Even if everything else is falling apart.

Victor began unbuckling his belt, and in those fleeting seconds, Evelyn's mind spun with desperate calculations.

Begging would be useless—men like Victor thrived on submission. It would only make him hungrier.

Instead, she kept her voice steady, cold. "You want money, don't you? Touch me, and you'll lose it all."

Victor paused, intrigued. "Oh?"

"Think carefully. A fleeting moment of pleasure... or a fortune that could change your life?"

The offer sparked something in him. "How much are we talking?"

Evelyn didn't blink. "Enough to make this the best decision you've ever made."

Victor tilted his head, considering.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms. No. This wasn't part of the deal.

Evelyn pressed on, her gaze unyielding. "Or you could be stupid. Your choice."

A slow grin spread across Victor's face.

"Now that," he murmured, "is interesting."

Vanessa felt a chill run down her spine as Evelyn's piercing gaze landed on her.

Something wasn't right.

Evelyn's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "The price depends entirely on how much her husband values her."

Victor frowned, scratching his stubbled chin. "What kind of game are you playing?"

"Just take my phone and redial the last number she called," Evelyn commanded, her voice laced with steel.

Victor hesitated, sensing the shift in atmosphere. "Why your phone? Will her husband answer? What's your relationship with him?"

Evelyn's laugh was cold. "Our relationship doesn't matter. What matters is that her so-called husband is the crown prince of Cresthaven."

At the mention of the Cresthaven prince, Victor's eyes gleamed with sudden interest. His thick fingers fumbled with the phone as he hastily dialed.

The line connected after just one ring.

Alexander's warm voice filled the abandoned warehouse, laced with hopeful surprise. "Evelyn? You're calling me?"

Vanessa's blood ran cold. She'd recognize that voice anywhere.

A sharp pang of humiliation twisted inside her.

Evelyn is doing this on purpose! She’s making a fool of me in front of everyone!

Ethan answered Evelyn’s call instantly.

"Evelyn? What’s going on? Why aren’t you saying anything?" His voice was laced with concern when only silence greeted him.

Victor smirked, his grip tightening on the phone. "Your Highness, which of these lovely ladies is your wife?"

Ethan’s jaw clenched. Hearing the unfamiliar, mocking voice, his tone turned icy. "Who the hell is this?"

"Your granddaddy!" Victor sneered, relishing the moment.

His men erupted into cruel laughter around him.

In that instant, Ethan realized the gravity of the situation.

Evelyn’s in danger.

His mind raced.

"How much do you want?" Ethan demanded, already striding toward the door, his pulse hammering.

"Twenty million. Not a cent less," Victor drawled, his fingers trailing along Evelyn’s cheek with a revolting possessiveness.

Evelyn jerked her head away, her voice sharp as a blade. "Don't you dare touch me!"

The sound of her voice sent a tremor through Ethan Caldwell.

His mind raced with horrifying images of what those men might be doing to her. His chest tightened, and he began pacing like a caged animal, his hands clenched into fists.

Every second felt like an eternity.

The thought of losing her—of failing her—was unbearable.

His phone buzzed in his pocket, but he ignored it. Nothing mattered except getting her back.

Safe.

Unharmed.

His.

###Chapter 283 Gunshots

"Twenty million is acceptable, but you keep your hands off her!" Ethan's voice was urgent, laced with desperation.

Victor smirked, his gaze flickering between Evelyn and Vanessa, a wicked glint in his eyes. "Problem is, there are two lovely ladies here. Which one is your wife, Your Highness?"

He reached out, tracing a finger along each woman's cheek with deliberate slowness.

Vanessa burst into dramatic sobs. "Ethan, please! Save me! I'm terrified—this is all Evelyn's fault! If she hadn't run like a fool, we wouldn't be in this mess!"

Her voice trembled with exaggerated distress, as if she were the sole victim of circumstance.

Victor's patience snapped. He backhanded Vanessa sharply. "Enough! Save the theatrics for someone who cares. I haven't even touched you, and you're already wailing like a banshee. How did the prince of Cresthaven end up with someone so useless?"

Vanessa immediately fell silent, reduced to pitiful sniffles.

Ethan's jaw tightened. Only now did he fully register that Vanessa was also a hostage.

He had planned to end their marriage, but watching her in danger, his instincts took over.

"Name your price for both of them."

Victor Kane let out a dark chuckle. "One's your wife, the other's your mistress? Lucky man. Fine, I'll be generous—fifty million. You have two hours."

Alexander Whitmore was already in his car, speeding toward the bank.

Victor's voice crackled through the phone. "No cops, or I put bullets in their skulls."

"Don’t you dare lay a finger on Evelyn!"

A sinister pause. "Your wife stays untouched. But the other one…"

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles white. His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Harm either of them, and I'll hunt you down. No prison, no trial. Just you and me."

Every word was a promise, sharp as a blade.

Victor swallowed hard. He'd underestimated Alexander's reach. The man controlled empires with a snap of his fingers.

If he'd known the woman in the trunk was Alexander Whitmore's wife, he'd have picked a different target.

But now?

Now there was no going back.

Ethan Caldwell arrived at the abandoned warehouse just as dusk settled over the city.

The trunk of his car was packed to the brim with stacks of crisp banknotes. He stepped out, his voice sharp as he demanded, "Release them. Now."

Victor Kane stood outside the rusted factory doors, smirking as he motioned for his men to inspect the payment.

When the trunk flew open, the sheer volume of cash nearly blinded them—neat bundles, meticulously arranged, gleaming under the dim overhead lights.

"Impressive," Victor drawled, his fingers twitching with greed. "Fifty million in less than twenty-four hours. You don’t disappoint."

Ethan’s jaw tightened. "I held up my end. Let them go."

With a lazy wave of Victor’s hand, two of his thugs disappeared into the factory.

Then—gunfire.

Sharp, rapid bursts echoed from inside.

Victor’s smirk vanished. "What the hell was that?"

One of his men came sprinting back, panic in his eyes. "Boss! Our guys are down—and the woman’s gone!"

Victor whirled on Ethan, fury twisting his features. "You double-crossing—"

But Ethan was already moving.

Victor Kane's face darkened as he turned to glare at Ethan Caldwell. "I specifically told you not to involve the authorities! What the hell is this?"

Ethan's jaw tightened, his expression stormy. "I didn't call the police!"

Victor snapped, "Then who's shooting?"

Before anyone could respond, Vanessa Hart came stumbling out of the warehouse, her face streaked with tears. The moment she spotted Ethan, she rushed into his arms, trembling violently.

"It was horrible!" she choked out between sobs. "Men—armed men—just stormed in. They executed the guards watching us and took Evelyn! They were asking for her by name. I barely escaped by hiding behind the crates!"

Victor's entire demeanor turned glacial. "Describe them. Now."

Vanessa swallowed hard, her voice shaking. "They were... worse than you. More brutal. More ruthless. One of them nearly shot me—I saw the muzzle flash before I ducked away."

The air grew thick with tension as the distant echo of gunfire still lingered.

###Chapter 284 Disappointed

Ethan's gaze turned icy as he glared at Victor. "The money's here, but where are the hostages? You'd better have a damn good explanation."

In their world, there were unspoken rules. Payment meant immediate release.

Yet now, with Evelyn gone, Victor felt his pride crumbling.

"Son of a bitch!" He spat, storming back into the warehouse to interrogate his wounded men. "Find out who the hell dared to cross me!"

As Ethan moved to follow, Vanessa clutched his arm, trembling. "Ethan, please—I can't stay here. It's freezing, and we don't even know who took Evelyn. Let's just go home and regroup!"

His expression darkened. "Go home?"

"I'm hurt," she whimpered, pressing a hand to her bruised cheek. "My stomach—it's killing me..."

"Then leave."

He didn’t look at her again.

Disappointment hardened his eyes like steel.

The thought burned through Ethan's mind like acid.

Evelyn was gone. Vanished without a trace. And Vanessa wanted to just abandon her and walk away?

They had been taken together. Yet here she was, cowering behind a crate while Evelyn was dragged off by armed strangers.

Now she was clinging to him, begging him to turn back.

His jaw clenched.

This was his chance. His moment to save Evelyn, just like he had all those years ago in that bathroom. That fateful rescue had been the beginning of everything between them.

The memory ignited something fierce inside him.

This time, he wouldn't fail her.

Vanessa's nails dug into his arm. "Ethan, listen to me! I'm your wife! Those men have guns—this could get ugly! Someone of your status can't go running into danger like this. Let's go back and call the police. Let them handle it!"

Her voice grated on his nerves.

The desperation in her tone only made him more determined.

He shook her off, his patience snapping like a frayed wire.

Vanessa stumbled back, her eyes wide with disbelief. "You're really choosing her over me? After everything?"

Ethan didn't answer.

His gaze was already fixed ahead, scanning the shadows for any sign of Evelyn.

Vanessa's voice turned shrill. "She's Alexander's problem now! Not yours!"

The words barely registered.

All he could think about was Evelyn—her fear, her helplessness.

And the fact that he was the only one who could reach her in time.

Vanessa grabbed his sleeve again. "Ethan, please—"

He wrenched his arm free, his voice low and final. "Enough."

Her face crumpled.

But he was already moving, stepping into the darkness where Evelyn had disappeared.

He wouldn't let history repeat itself.

Not this time.

Any lingering affection he might have held for her vanished the moment he witnessed her callous disregard for Evelyn's safety.

Her only concern had been her own escape.

The depth of her selfishness was staggering.

If she could abandon a sister she'd grown up with so easily, what did that reveal about the darkness in her heart?

Ethan's voice dripped with contempt. "Without a marriage certificate, what delusion makes you believe you're my wife?"

Vanessa's face drained of color, her eyes widening in shock. "Ethan—"

He shoved her aside and strode into the warehouse.

Two of Victor's men lay motionless on the concrete floor, bullet wounds precise—one shot, one kill.

Nathan studied the bodies with a grim expression. "Bastards. Not only did they take someone from us, but they executed my men without hesitation."

His jaw clenched in fury.

Whoever had orchestrated this was no ordinary criminal.

They moved with military precision—calculated, ruthless, and terrifyingly efficient.

This wasn’t a reckless ambush.

It was a meticulously planned strike.

The ambush had been perfectly timed—striking when their defenses were at their lowest.

Ethan Caldwell's blood ran cold as he assessed the situation. These weren't ordinary mercenaries. They moved with precision, their presence suffocating.

Victor Kane's grip on his gun tightened. "Hand them over," he demanded, voice like gravel.

Ethan exhaled sharply. "I can't." His jaw clenched. "Two of my men are dead because of this mess. Take the thirty million instead—it's still in the car, untouched. Consider the deal void. Find her yourself."

The air crackled with tension.

Victor's eyes darkened. "You're making a mistake."

Ethan didn't flinch. "No. I'm cutting my losses."

Silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken threats.

Then, with a sharp gesture, Victor signaled his men to fall back.

But Ethan knew—this wasn't over.

Not by a long shot.

###Chapter 285 Special Greeting

Ethan's lips curled into a mocking sneer as the words reached his ears.

"Do I look like some puppet you can manipulate at will?" His voice dripped with icy disdain.

The cold fury in his piercing gaze pinned Victor Kane in place. The air around them thickened with tension, suffocating and unyielding.

Victor's breath hitched, his throat tightening under the weight of Ethan's wrath. It was no wonder Ethan Caldwell was known as the uncrowned king of Cresthaven—his mere presence could make even the most ruthless criminals falter.

Without another word, Ethan turned on his heel and strode toward his car.

Panic flashed across Victor's face. He barked an order, and his men scrambled to block the vehicle.

"Let's make one thing clear," Victor said, forcing a smirk. "You're here for your wife, right? And she's unharmed."

Ethan paused, casting a chilling glance over his shoulder. "Get to the point."

Victor held up two fingers, his confidence wavering. "Leave twenty million behind, and you walk away."

The money was still in Ethan's car, untouched. The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken threats.

Ethan's lips curled into a dangerous smirk. "You actually believe you can extort money from me? What makes you think you're entitled?"

His foot slammed on the accelerator, and the engine roared like a beast unleashed.

The rugged off-road vehicle he drove was a monster of steel and power, its aggressive frame barely contained by the dim streetlights.

In a heartbeat, the car surged forward, scattering the thugs like leaves in a storm.

Panicked shouts filled the air as they scrambled to avoid being crushed beneath the tires.

Beside Ethan, Vanessa clutched the seat, her pulse hammering in her throat.

She had always known Ethan as cold, controlled—untouchable. But this? This was raw, reckless fury, and it stole her breath.

He hadn’t hesitated. Hadn’t flinched. Just plowed through without a second thought.

Vanessa stared at him, awed. The way he commanded fear was terrifyingly magnetic.

As they sped away from the factory, the night erupted with the wail of police sirens.

Vanessa exhaled sharply. Of course. Ethan had planned for this. He always had a backup.

The night air was thick with tension as Ethan Caldwell stepped out of his car.

As a powerful figure in Cresthaven, Ethan wasn't the type to be manipulated by some low-level criminal.

He approached the lead officer, his voice low but commanding. Whatever words he exchanged made the officer’s expression shift instantly, his posture stiffening.

Moments later, Ethan returned to the vehicle, his jaw set.

"Get out," he ordered, his tone icy. "They’ll escort you to the city."

Vanessa Hart gripped the seat, desperation creeping into her voice. "Ethan, are you going after Evelyn? Do these officers know where she is?"

Silence.

Her fingers dug into the leather. "I’m her sister! I care about her safety just as much as you do. If you’re going to save her, take me with you! I didn’t mean what I said earlier—fear makes people say stupid things. I regret it. We’ve been through too much together."

Ethan barely registered her words, genuine or not.

Every second wasted was another second Evelyn remained in danger.

Across town, Alexander Whitmore’s phone buzzed in the darkness.

A chilling message lit up the screen:

[258, your woman is in our hands. Want to see her blown to pieces?]

Alexander's grip tightened, his knuckles turning white.

The air around him grew heavy with barely contained fury.

His dark eyes burned with a dangerous intensity.

[I'll deliver her remains to your doorstep as a special greeting.]

The message lingered in the silence, its threat unmistakable.

A cold smile curled at the corner of his lips.

This wasn't just a warning—it was a promise.

And Alexander Whitmore always kept his promises.

286

The weight of those words settled over him like a storm cloud.

His mind raced, calculating every possible move.

Whoever had sent this would regret it.

Deeply.

His phone buzzed again, but he ignored it.

Right now, only one thing mattered.

Finding Evelyn.

Before it was too late.
###Chapter 286 Explosive Revelation

Ethan Caldwell's off-road vehicle came to a halt outside the skeletal remains of an abandoned construction site.

The moment he shifted into park, Vanessa Hart's fingers dug into his forearm like talons.

"Is Evelyn really here? It's...it's too dark. I can't see anything." Her whisper carried an edge of hysteria.

The night swallowed everything in inky blackness, the wind screaming through the steel beams like a wounded animal.

Vanessa trembled violently, pressing herself against Ethan's side as if he were a human shield against the darkness.

"Why...where are the police? Shouldn't they be right behind us?" Her voice cracked.

To maintain operational secrecy, only two undercover officers had been deployed in Ethan's vehicle instead of a full tactical team.

Ethan had no patience for Vanessa's theatrics.

Every fiber of his being was laser-focused on finding Evelyn. He wrenched his arm free with a sharp movement. "Stay. Put. Don't make a sound."

Just as he reached for the door handle, twin headlights materialized beside them like ghostly eyes in the night.

The new arrival's engine cut with an ominous finality.

Ethan's hand hovered over his concealed weapon.

The car door creaked open.

A silhouette emerged from the darkness.

Vanessa gasped.

The figure stepped into the dim glow of their headlights—

It was Alexander Whitmore.

His expression was carved from granite, eyes burning with lethal intensity. "Let's move. We're running out of time."

Ethan gave a curt nod.

Somewhere in the decaying structure, Evelyn was waiting.

And the clock was ticking.

Ethan Caldwell froze at the sight of the black SUV. "Alexander?"

Alexander Whitmore barely spared Ethan a glance before focusing on the plainclothes officers in Ethan's car. His voice was clipped. "There might be explosives planted here."

The officers paled instantly. One immediately reached for his radio. "We need EOD here now!"

Alexander didn’t wait for their response. "No time. Find Evelyn first. Split up." With that, he vanished into the shadows, leaving no room for argument.

The officers exchanged grim looks. One stayed to call for backup while the other two sprinted toward the derelict building.

Ethan moved to follow, but Vanessa Hart grabbed his arm, her fingers trembling. "Ethan, don’t! What if it’s rigged to blow? If it detonates—"

The industrial zone was a maze of half-constructed buildings, each a potential death trap.

"Then stay here," Ethan snapped, shaking her off. "I didn’t ask you to tag along."

Vanessa’s breath hitched. "You’ll get yourself killed!"

Ethan didn’t look back. "Better than doing nothing."

The wind howled through the skeletal structures, carrying the scent of rust and damp concrete. Somewhere in the darkness, time was running out.

Ethan didn't wait for a reply.

He turned and vanished into the shadows, leaving Vanessa standing there, her frustration boiling over.

Her hands clenched at her sides.

She knew her concern had irritated him, but all she wanted was to keep him from danger.

Why can't he understand how much I care?

The abandoned structures around her stood like skeletal remains, their crumbling facades amplifying the eerie silence.

A dark thought slithered into Vanessa's mind.

If only the explosives detonated right now.

Then Evelyn would be gone, and my place would finally be secure.

The team had scattered, each member disappearing into different directions.

Left alone in the car, Vanessa tapped her fingers restlessly against the steering wheel.

The waiting was unbearable.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

Somewhere in the darkness, Evelyn stirred.

Her head pounded as if split open.

A faint, rhythmic sound reached her ears—an alarm? A phone?

She forced her eyes open, but the world remained pitch black.

No light.

No escape.

Just suffocating darkness.

Her mind reeled. What just happened?

Gunfire cracked through the abandoned warehouse—two sharp, precise shots. The men guarding Evelyn and Vanessa crumpled to the ground without a sound.

This was Evelyn’s first time witnessing death up close. The sheer fragility of life struck her like a physical blow.

Then, through her dazed shock, a figure vaulted through the broken window.

He landed effortlessly on the sill, one knee bent, his grip steady on the gun now trained at her and Vanessa. His voice was calm but edged with urgency.

"Which one of you is Evelyn Carter?"

###Chapter 287 Unmasked

Vanessa pushed Evelyn out with desperate force.

A sharp pain exploded in Evelyn's head as something hard connected with her skull. Darkness swallowed her consciousness instantly.

Her awareness returned in fragments—the roar of a motorcycle engine, the wind whipping past her face, the rough hands dragging her into an unknown location.

Now, her wrists burned from the coarse ropes binding them. No matter how fiercely she twisted, the knots held firm.

Then—cold steel kissed her throat.

A shudder wracked her body as the blade's edge pressed deeper.

"Stop squirming," a gravelly voice warned. "Those ropes aren't coming loose."

The man's face was swallowed by shadows, only the cruel curve of his mouth visible in the dim light.

Evelyn forced her voice steady. "Who are you? What do you want?"

Moonlight sliced through the room, painting jagged silver lines across the concrete floor.

It illuminated just enough to reveal the madness glittering in his eyes.

His grin widened. "You'll find out soon enough."

The knife trailed lower, hovering above her racing pulse.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Somewhere in the darkness, a second set of footsteps approached.

The blade didn't waver.

But the new arrival made the man stiffen.

Evelyn's captor turned his head slightly. "You're early."

A familiar female voice answered. "Change of plans."

Recognition struck Evelyn like lightning.

She knew that voice.

And if its owner was here—

This wasn't a random kidnapping.

This was revenge.

His cold gaze pierced through me.

"You're asking the wrong question, sweetheart. The real question is—how many breaths do you have left?"

As he spoke, Evelyn followed his smirk to the blinking red numbers counting down in the shadows.

"That's...an explosive device?"

Her blood turned to ice.

The man's grin widened, revealing perfect white teeth. "Happy holidays, gorgeous. You've got eight minutes and forty-two seconds before this building becomes your funeral pyre. I'd say my goodbyes now."

He tilted his head, the knife glinting as he withdrew it from her throat. "Though honestly? Watching lovers die together is my favorite Christmas tradition. Enjoy the fireworks."

With that, he vanished into the crumbling hallway, his laughter echoing off the rusted pipes.

Alone.

The word hammered against Evelyn's ribs as the timer's electronic pulse filled the derelict warehouse. Each tick vibrated through the cracked concrete beneath her knees.

Her pulse roared in her ears.

Then—

A metallic clang from the upper catwalk.

Evelyn's head snapped up.

The timer read 07:15.

"Think," she hissed through clenched teeth. Her bound wrists burned against the zip ties. "Alexander would never—"

Another sound. Closer this time.

Not just the building settling.

Someone was still here.

The realization hit like a bucket of gasoline—this wasn't just an execution.

It was a show.

And she was the main act.

07:02.

Evelyn Carter had six minutes to rewrite the ending.


"I need to get out of here."

Evelyn's pulse hammered in her throat as the man's footsteps retreated.

She didn’t waste a second.

With a sharp inhale, she twisted her body and rolled toward the building’s edge, her muscles screaming in protest.

"Help! Someone—please!" Her voice tore through the air, raw and desperate.

The wind whipped around her, the dizzying height making her stomach lurch.

But she had no choice.

Alexander had to be close.

Why else would the man taunt her with words like "death match" and "lover"?

She needed him to hear her. To find her before it was too late.

Then—

Footsteps.

Her breath hitched as the man reappeared, his expression darkening.

Annoyance flickered in his gaze, followed by something almost like pity.

Before she could scream again, he shoved a cloth into her mouth, silencing her.

"Save your strength, sweetheart," he murmured, tightening the gag. "A quiet death is more dignified, don’t you think?"

Satisfied she couldn’t make another sound, he turned and vanished.

Leaving her alone.

With nothing but the relentless ticking of time.

The interior of the car fell into a heavy silence as Vanessa froze.

Her pulse spiked.

Was that Evelyn's voice? It had sounded so close—too close.

Her sharp eyes darted toward a towering high-rise, scanning the darkened windows. Then she saw it—a flash of white fabric fluttering wildly against the night sky.

The wind carried it like a ghostly whisper.

Vanessa's breath hitched.

That scarf—she recognized it instantly. Evelyn had been wearing it earlier.

Without another thought, Vanessa shoved the car door open and stepped out, her movements deliberate but cautious as she approached the building.

Then she heard it.

A rhythmic, mechanical ticking.

Her lips curled into a slow, satisfied smirk.

A bomb.

A thrill shot through her.

She might not even need to lift a finger. If Evelyn was trapped inside with no one coming to save her... well, fate would take care of the rest.

Vanessa pulled out her radio, her voice urgent but controlled.

"Ethan," she hissed, "I just saw Alexander rescue Evelyn! You need to get back here—now. The whole place is rigged to blow! We have to move!"

A sharp noise cut through the darkness.

Vanessa stiffened.

"Who's there?"

Footsteps echoed from the upper floors—the man who had taken Evelyn was descending. At the sound of the radio crackling to life, his body stiffened, fingers tightening around the gun in his grip.

Vanessa nearly leapt out of her skin at the sharp command that followed.

That voice.

It was him—the same man who had dragged Evelyn away.

A cold wave of terror crashed over her, prickling her skin like a thousand needles. Every instinct screamed at her to run, but she forced herself to stay still, pressing deeper into the shadows of the corner.

She held her breath, willing herself invisible.

Then, the radio spat out Ethan’s reply. "Understood. Returning now."

Vanessa’s stomach dropped.

They knew.

She’d been found.

###Chapter 288 The Brink of Destruction

Vanessa's breath hitched as an icy dread crept down her spine.

The realization that the very weapon which had claimed two lives in that abandoned warehouse was now trained on her sent a violent tremor through her body. Tears blurred her vision.

Her voice cracked, raw with terror. "I—I swear, I'm not involved! Please, don't—"

The words dissolved into ragged sobs as panic seized her.

The man's lips curled into a cruel smirk. Impatience flashed in his eyes as he steadied his aim.

Vanessa's knees buckled. She collapsed to the ground just as the gunshot shattered the silence.

The bullet whizzed past her ear, embedding itself into the concrete wall with a sickening thud.

"Goddamn it!"

His furious snarl echoed through the darkness—a man thwarted by nothing more than a trembling woman.

The chaotic footsteps from downstairs grew louder.

"Here! They're up here!"

"Move faster! We need to get to them now!"

The gunshots had given away their location.

The kidnapper knew his time was up. He spun around, ready to bolt.

But before he could take another step, a fist slammed into his ribs with brutal precision.

The impact knocked the breath from his lungs. Before he could recover, a sharp twist of his wrist forced the gun from his grip.

His opponent moved like lightning—efficient, ruthless.

Alexander Whitmore's eyes darkened.

In one fluid motion, he flipped the gun, pressing the barrel against the man's temple.

The entire fight had lasted mere seconds. One squeeze, and it would be over.

Vanessa Hart exhaled in relief at the sight of her rescuer.

".64 caliber pistol, 7.62 rounds—police issue." Alexander's voice was icy. "Who the hell are you working for?"

Alexander's gaze turned glacial, his voice dripping with venom. "Speak. Where is she?"

The man clenched his jaw, frustration twisting his features. "The bomb's timer is almost up. Even if you run now, it's pointless!"

A dark smirk curved Alexander's lips. "Good. Then you'll make a convenient scapegoat. Fitting."

The kidnapper scoffed, resignation settling in. "My life's worthless anyway. If I die, so be it. But you’re not alone, are you?"

Every second wasted meant disaster.

Vanessa's voice cut through the tension. "Alexander, Evelyn's upstairs!"

Right on cue, backup agents stormed in. Without hesitation, Alexander delivered a brutal kick to the man's ribs, signaling the agents to restrain him.

Just as they moved in, the kidnapper's hand flashed—a blade glinting as he thrust it toward Alexander's side.

Bound and gagged, Evelyn could only watch the timer tick down.

Four minutes left.

Her stomach twisted.

The icy wind sliced through the abandoned building like a blade, stealing the warmth from Evelyn Carter's body.

Her fingers had long gone numb.

"Is this really the end?" The thought echoed in her mind, sharp and unrelenting.

She clenched her teeth.

"I refuse to die here. Not like this."

Struggling against the weight of her thick winter coat, Evelyn dragged herself toward the stairwell. Every movement was agony, her muscles screaming in protest.

She barely made it three steps before collapsing.

Hopelessness threatened to swallow her whole—until the faintest sound reached her ears.

Footsteps.

Someone was downstairs.

Her heart lurched.

"Mmm—!" She tried to call out, but the gag muffled her voice.

The timer on the wall ticked mercilessly.

01:59.

Even if she broke free now, escape was impossible.

Defeated, Evelyn slumped against the cold concrete floor. A bitter laugh escaped her lips as tears welled in her eyes.

"Would anyone even miss me?"

She shut her eyes, bracing for the inevitable—

Then, the footsteps grew louder.

Closer.

###Chapter 289 Salvation

The sound of footsteps echoed louder, and Evelyn's eyes snapped open in shock.

Alexander appeared at the top of the stairs, his movements swift and purposeful as he rushed toward her.

She blinked rapidly, half-convinced she was hallucinating.

His form was a blur, moving with such speed that it stole her breath.

It's really him!

Alexander! He came for me!

Tears pooled in her eyes as if she were witnessing a miracle.

With a sharp tug, Alexander pulled the gag from her mouth, his gaze flicking briefly to the bomb beside them.

"Don't be afraid. I've got you," he murmured, his voice steady, grounding her.

Evelyn had fought uselessly against the restraints, but Alexander worked with practiced efficiency, freeing her wrists in seconds.

Her pulse raced as she remembered—Alexander had spent years in the force.

His hands were sure, his movements precise.

She gasped as the last of the ropes fell away.

Then, the world exploded.

The explosion's timer ticked mercilessly in the background.

Alexander moved with military precision, his movements honed from years at the academy. This was second nature to him.

"We're out of time. Move. Now."

His voice was clipped, urgent.

Gently, he assessed Evelyn. "Can you stand? If not, wrap your arms around me. I'll carry you."

Before she could answer, he lifted her effortlessly against his chest.

Evelyn's skin was ice-cold, but Alexander radiated heat like a furnace. The contrast made her shiver—then melt into him.

Her fingers curled into his shirt. "There's a bomb," she whispered. "Aren't you terrified?"

His grip tightened. "Terrified? Yes. But leaving you here alone would've destroyed me."

He sprinted down the staircase, each step fluid and sure, as if the crumbling building was nothing. Evelyn clung to him, refusing to slow him down.

"Fool," she breathed against his neck. "If we don't make it—"

"We will."

His certainty was a blade cutting through fear.

The exit loomed ahead. Shadows swallowed them whole.

"It doesn't matter. This worthless life of mine—you saved it once already."

Evelyn felt her throat tighten.

She had rescued him ten years ago, a split-second choice, something she would have done for anyone in danger.

Yet Alexander had remembered it all this time.

With the bomb threat, the building had been evacuated. Everyone downstairs had already fled. Alexander and Evelyn were the last ones left.

Just as they cleared the collapsing structure, a rapid succession of pops echoed from the upper floors.

Dark smoke rolled out in thick waves.

Evelyn blinked, confused.

Is this the explosion?

It sounds more like fireworks.

This is… anticlimactic.

Alexander guided Evelyn into the waiting car, then glanced back at the scene with a smirk.

His gaze landed on the handcuffed kidnappers being wrestled to the ground by police.

The corner of his mouth lifted in satisfaction.

"Bloody hell! We've been tricked!" The kidnappers, now handcuffed and shoved into the back of a police cruiser, were seething with rage.

"You conniving bastards! This is a complete rip-off!"

The so-called "explosive device" they had shelled out a small fortune for turned out to be nothing more than a glorified firework—utterly useless.

Alexander leaned over to fasten Evelyn's seatbelt. His fingers brushed against hers, and he immediately noticed how icy they were. Without hesitation, he grabbed a thick woolen blanket from the backseat and draped it around her shoulders, tucking it securely to ward off the chill.

"Better?" he murmured, his voice low with concern.

Evelyn gave a small nod, though her hands still trembled slightly beneath the fabric.

Alexander's jaw tightened as he glanced back at the police cars pulling away. Those idiots had no idea who they were dealing with.

But they would soon find out.

###Chapter 290 Vendetta

Ethan's and Alexander's cars stood parallel, engines humming softly in the evening air.

From Ethan's vantage point, Evelyn's delicate profile was perfectly visible through the passenger window of Alexander's vintage car.

Yet she remained utterly unaware of his presence.

Determined, Ethan lowered his window with a sharp click.

A frigid gust rushed inside, making Vanessa shudder violently. "Ethan, it's late. Can we leave? I'm freezing—please close the window."

He didn't acknowledge her, his eyes locked onto Alexander's retreating vehicle.

The classic car roared to life, tires spitting gravel into the air. Dust swirled, choking Vanessa as she coughed into her sleeve.

Finally, with a stiff motion, Ethan raised the window again.

Just as he shifted gears to follow, Vanessa seized his wrist, her nails digging in.

"Ethan, I feel terrible. Take me to the hospital. Now."

Earlier, during the chaotic standoff, one of the kidnappers had fired—

Vanessa's legs gave way beneath her, the terror too overwhelming to bear.

She crumpled to the ground, her breath coming in short, panicked gasps.

The impact left her dizzy, a dull ache spreading through her body.

A sharp, unfamiliar pain twisted low in her abdomen, and her fingers instinctively pressed against it.

Her once pristine cream-colored dress was now smeared with dirt, the fabric clinging to her skin.

Then she saw it—the dark crimson seeping through her tights, staining them a horrifying shade of burgundy.

Ethan’s gaze followed hers, his expression hardening as he took in the sight.

Vanessa’s blood ran cold.

Her hands trembled violently as she whispered, her voice barely audible.

“I… I haven’t had my period in almost two months.”

Her throat tightened.

“Ethan… I might be pregnant.”

The realization struck her like lightning.

If she was carrying his child, everything could change.

He’s been pushing for a divorce… but what if—

Her thoughts were cut short by another wave of pain.

“Ethan!” she cried, desperation clawing at her chest. “Please, take me to the hospital! Now!”

Her mind raced back to that single night—the only time they had been together since their marriage.

Could fate be this cruel?

Or was this her last chance to hold onto him?

The car ride had been tense. Ethan Caldwell had been possessive, repeatedly calling out Evelyn Carter's name.

Vanessa Hart clenched her fists. "It was degrading, but if it meant conceiving his child, perhaps it was worth the humiliation."

Yet the blood terrified her. "Is the baby still alive?"

Her panic intensified with every passing second.

By the time Evelyn arrived home, the clock had long struck midnight.

She was still shaken from the night’s horrors.

The moment they stepped inside, Alexander Whitmore’s phone rang.

The silence of the house made the conversation painfully clear.

"The kidnappers escaped. They had backup. Stay alert."

"Understood," Alexander replied curtly before ending the call.

Evelyn froze. "How is that possible? There were officers everywhere. How did they just vanish?"

Alexander’s voice carried a trace of remorse. "They had help. No one abandons their own."

Then, quieter, he added, "I was their real target."

Evelyn’s breath caught in her throat.

Alexander's voice was low but steady as he spoke. "Back during my time at the academy, I crossed paths with some dangerous people while working undercover. This... this is their way of settling the score."

Everything clicked into place for Evelyn.

Her mind flashed back to that chaotic night at Eclipse Lounge—the glint of steel, Alexander dodging the blade at the last second.

Had that attack been part of this same vendetta?

Turning toward him, she noticed the exhaustion etched into Alexander's features. His usually immaculate appearance was rumpled, his jaw tight with unspoken tension.

The air between them grew heavy with unasked questions.

###Chapter 291 Your Kisses

Alexander slumped against the foyer wall, the sudden illumination revealing his forehead glistening with cold sweat.

His usually vibrant features had drained of color, those famously sensual lips now pale as parchment, giving him the appearance of someone who'd suffered severe blood loss.

Evelyn's heart lurched as she dashed forward, fingers digging into his forearm with desperate urgency. "Alex! What happened? Are you injured?"

The moment her hand made contact with his black tailored suit, she recoiled at the unexpected dampness.

Her palm came away crimson.

Horror gripped her as she realized his entire jacket was saturated with blood.

"Show me where you're hurt!" she demanded, already working to unbutton his shirt with trembling fingers.

Alexander watched her frantic movements, those stormy eyes darkening with something primal. Without warning, he seized the nape of her neck and pinned her against the wall, claiming her mouth in a searing kiss that stole her breath.

No one had ever looked at him with such raw concern.

Through years of navigating danger and violence, he'd grown accustomed to bloodstained shirts and untreated wounds. But Evelyn's reaction shattered his defenses.

His kiss spoke volumes - gratitude, desperation, and something deeper neither dared name. The metallic tang of blood mingled with their shared breath as his fingers tangled in her hair, anchoring her to him as if she might disappear.

Evelyn could feel his racing heartbeat through the blood-soaked fabric, each frantic thud mirroring her own. The coppery scent filled her nostrils, yet she couldn't bring herself to pull away. Not when he clung to her like a drowning man to driftwood.

When they finally broke apart, Alexander rested his forehead against hers, his breathing ragged. "I'm fine," he murmured, though the tremor in his voice betrayed him.

Evelyn's hands framed his face, forcing him to meet her gaze. "Like hell you are," she whispered fiercely.

A ghost of a smile touched his lips before his knees buckled. Evelyn barely caught him as his full weight collapsed against her, the wall the only thing keeping them both upright.

"Alexander!"

His eyelids fluttered as he fought to stay conscious. "Just... need a minute," he slurred, his body betraying his words as he slid down the wall.

Evelyn's pulse pounded in her ears as she finally got his jacket open, revealing the crimson blossom spreading across his white dress shirt.

The sight stole her breath.

There was so much blood. Too much.

Her fingers flew to her phone even as she pressed her free hand against the wound, applying pressure. "Stay with me," she ordered, voice cracking. "That's an order, Alexander Whitmore."

His weak chuckle turned into a cough that speckled his lips with red. "Yes, ma'am."

As she shouted their address into the phone, Evelyn realized with terrifying clarity that the man who'd built an empire through sheer willpower was now fighting for his life in her arms.

And she'd be damned if she let him lose this battle.

The sensation of someone genuinely caring for him was foreign, yet it melted the icy walls around his heart.

Alexander shut his eyes, surrendering to the kiss, craving to become one with Evelyn in that moment.

But she jerked her head away, golden eyes blazing with frustration. "Alexander Whitmore, have you lost your mind?"

She couldn't fathom how he could even think of kissing her right now.

Her palms pressed firmly against his chest as she shoved him back. "You're bleeding everywhere!"

"I'm aware," he murmured, his lips quirking. "But my mouth works just fine."

Evelyn gaped at him. How could he be so infuriatingly calm while drenched in his own blood?

"It's not life-threatening. You're worrying too much," Alexander said, his voice low and teasing.

Before she could protest, he yanked her against him, burying his face in the curve of her neck. The familiar scent of her shampoo grounded him.

His weight sagged against her, his breathing uneven. Whether from exhaustion or injury, she couldn’t tell.

"Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured, his breath warm against her skin, "back at the academy..."

The crimson stain spread across Alexander's shirt like spilled wine.

Evelyn's hands trembled as they hovered over the wound.

"Stop saying it's nothing!" Her voice cracked. "You're bleeding everywhere!"

Alexander chuckled, wincing as he caught her wrist. "Sweetheart, in my line of work? Papercuts hurt worse."

She couldn't believe his nonchalance. The metallic tang of blood filled the air, making her stomach churn.

His thumb brushed her cheek where tears had carved paths. "Your tears hurt me more than this scratch ever could."

Then he kissed her—slow, deliberate presses against her damp skin. Each one whispered promises against her jawline.

"See? Best medicine." His grin was wolfish despite the pallor of his face.

Evelyn recoiled. "Are you insane? We need an ambulance!"

Alexander caught her waist before she could stand. "Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured against her lips, "I've survived worse with just whiskey and stitches."

Her fingers dug into his shoulders. "What kind of life did you live before me?"

The question hung between them like shattered glass.

Alexander's smile faded. He pressed his forehead to hers. "One where pain was background noise."

Evelyn's breath hitched. She grabbed the first aid kit with newfound determination.

"No more kisses until you're stitched up," she declared, tearing open antiseptic wipes. "And if you bleed out? I'll kill you myself."

Alexander's laughter echoed through the room—rich, warm, and utterly infuriating.

"Promise?" he teased, watching her shaky hands work.

Evelyn swatted his uninjured arm. "Try me."

Outside, sirens wailed in the distance. Neither of them moved to call for help.

Some battles were meant to be fought alone.

But this? This wound she'd dress herself.

Because Alexander Whitmore might be used to suffering in silence—but Evelyn Carter refused to let him.

Not anymore.

###Chapter 292 You've Got This

His breath was warm against her ear, the low timbre of his voice sending electric currents through her veins.

Evelyn shivered, her pulse quickening at the sensation.

Why does Alexander, even wounded, still have this effect on me?

Her heart stuttered, fluttering like a trapped bird in her chest.

"I—I don't know how to dress wounds," Evelyn admitted, her wide doe eyes flickering with uncertainty.

That vulnerable look was his undoing. Alexander caught her wrist, guiding her toward the ensuite. "Then I'll teach you."

His fingers worked at the buttons of his shirt, but after the second one, his strength faltered.

He pressed her palm flat against the hard planes of his chest, his gaze softening with an uncharacteristic plea. "Help me."

Seeing the indomitable Alexander Whitmore—the man who commanded boardrooms with a glance—struggle with something as simple as undressing made her throat tighten.

"Don't," he murmured, catching the sheen in her eyes before a tear could fall.

The raw emotion in his voice made her breath hitch.

His heart pounded as he pulled Evelyn into a crushing embrace.

The tenderness in her touch was something he cherished deeply.

If Alexander had known his confession would bring tears to her eyes, he would have swallowed those words whole.

"When I was critically wounded before, you saved me," he murmured. "This is just a scratch compared to that."

Her voice trembled. "But back then, you were just a stranger. If you had died, it would have been tragic, but I wouldn't have lost you. Now you're my husband. It's not the same."

Her reasoning was sound, yet each word cut deeper than any blade.

Evelyn rushed to grab the first aid kit, her fingers fumbling with the buttons of Alexander's bloodstained shirt.

When the wound came into view, she sucked in a sharp breath.

A deep gash marred his lower back, clearly from something razor-sharp. She couldn't even tell how far it went.

Her teeth sank into her lower lip as her hands shook.

"Alexander, please—let's just go to the hospital."

His voice was steady. "You're trained in medical acupuncture, aren't you? You can handle this. I trust you."

"But..."

"Open the medical kit and see what's inside."

Evelyn swallowed hard, blinking back tears as she obeyed.

Her breath caught when she spotted the gleaming acupuncture needles.

Alexander carefully arranged them in a neat row before meeting her gaze with unwavering confidence.

"You saved me with these ten years ago," he reminded her, voice steady despite the pain. "I don't know why you stopped practicing, but let me be your patient today."

He gave her a small, encouraging smile. "First, stop the bleeding. You can do this, Evelyn. I believe in you."

She shook her head violently, hands trembling.

"A child died under my care years ago, Alexander. I can't—I'll only make it worse! We need to get you to a hospital!"

Understanding flickered in his eyes.

So that was why she hesitated.

"That was an accident," he insisted firmly. "Remember how skilled you were at sixteen? You saved me without hesitation. Trust yourself now like you did then."

Evelyn bit down on her lip hard enough to taste blood, her wide, fearful eyes locked onto his.

The needles glinted between them—a silent challenge. A second chance.

Her fingers twitched.

Alexander held his breath.

The realization struck Evelyn like lightning.

Alexander wasn't just testing her skills—he was pushing her to face her deepest fears. To step out of the darkness that had held her captive for so long.

Her hands trembled slightly around the acupuncture needles.

But then she remembered.

Ten years ago, she had saved him.

She had stopped the bleeding when no one else could. When death had been seconds away from claiming him.

If she could do that then, she could do this now.

Her grip steadied.

She inhaled deeply, the scent of antiseptic sharp in her lungs.

This wound was nothing compared to what he had survived before.

She could do this.

She would do this.

The first needle glinted under the harsh clinic lights as she positioned it.

Her hands didn’t shake anymore.

###Chapter 293 Pregnant

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she grasped the acupuncture needles. Taking a steadying breath, she carefully probed Alexander's body, searching for the precise points before inserting them.

Each insertion was deliberate, her gaze locked onto his face for any sign of discomfort. Only when she was certain he felt no pain did she allow herself to relax.

To her astonishment, the bleeding from Alexander's wound began to slow.

"You see?" Alexander murmured, his dark eyes fixed on her. "You're doing perfectly. The bleeding is stopping."

Evelyn exhaled shakily and nodded. With gentle hands, she cleaned the blood from his skin, disinfecting the wound with meticulous care. Once satisfied the bleeding had ceased, she carefully withdrew the needles.

"We should wrap it now," Alexander said softly.

Evelyn hesitated, clutching the roll of bandages, her fingers hovering uncertainly near his waist.

A faint, amused smile tugged at Alexander's lips.

Without a word, he took the bandages from her and began winding them around his torso himself.

Tears shimmered in Evelyn's eyes once more.

Alexander’s hands moved with practiced precision, a clear sign he was no stranger to tending wounds.

When he finished, Evelyn immediately seized his hand and buried herself against his chest.

"Alexander, I swear I'll never let you down again..."

A soft chuckle escaped him as he carded his fingers through her hair. "What brought this on? Feeling guilty?"

She nodded, her heart aching.

This man has endured so much cruelty from the world. How could the Whitmore family abandon him as an infant in that desolate village and never look back?

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Vanessa sat frozen on the examination bed, her face drained of color.

The doctor’s words echoed in her mind like a thunderclap—she was pregnant.

When she first married Ethan, Vanessa had desperately wanted a child to secure her place in the Caldwell family.

Eleanor despised her. The Whitmores barely acknowledged her existence. But a baby could change everything.

Yet now, the timing couldn’t be worse.

Her fingers trembled as they pressed against her stomach.

What am I going to do?

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the hospital window, casting golden patterns on the sterile white sheets. Vanessa Hart lay perfectly still, her fingers trembling as they brushed over her still-flat abdomen.

A boy.

If she carried a son, he would be the firstborn grandson of the Caldwell lineage—a position of undeniable prestige.

Harold Caldwell would finally look at her with approval. Even Eleanor, with her sharp tongue and colder demeanor, would have no choice but to acknowledge her.

This child could change everything.

Vanessa exhaled shakily, her mind racing.

Ethan Caldwell had been distant since their rushed marriage, barely touching her. That night in the car had been impulsive, fueled by frustration and desperation.

She had been furious when he whispered Evelyn's name instead of hers.

Now?

Now she could almost laugh at the irony. That moment of humiliation had given her the one thing she needed most.

The doctor’s words echoed in her mind. "The embryo's implantation is unstable. You need complete bed rest for observation."

She had bled so much she’d been terrified.

But now?

Now she cradled the knowledge like a secret weapon.

The door creaked open, and the doctor stepped in, clipboard in hand. His expression was unreadable.

"The situation isn’t ideal," he said carefully. "We’ll have to see how—"

Vanessa’s grip tightened on the sheets.

She wouldn’t lose this.

Not when it was her only chance.
###Chapter 294 Locate Damian

Vanessa rested in the hospital bed, the IV drip slowly feeding into her veins.

She stole a nervous glance at Ethan's expression before mustering the courage to ask, "Ethan... I'm pregnant. We're going to have a baby. Aren't you happy?"

Ethan's voice was ice. "Just focus on recovering."

When he turned to leave, panic surged through her.

Her fingers tightened around his wrist. "Ethan, you're not really leaving me, are you? I'm carrying your child. Can't you stay just a little longer? After everything—the kidnapping, the terror—don't you care at all?"

Silence.

He loosened his tie with one hand and pulled free from her grip.

His expression remained unreadable as he retrieved a cigarette from his pocket, his gaze distant. "I'm stepping out for a smoke. I'll be back. I'm not going anywhere tonight."

Given the circumstances, he had no choice but to stay.

Vanessa exhaled in quiet relief as Ethan walked away.

Her hand drifted to her stomach, fingers pressing lightly against the fabric of her hospital gown.

Vanessa smirked to herself.

Having a baby really does change everything.

Even Ethan isn't exempt from its power.

She made a silent vow—she would find a way to give Ethan more heirs, solidifying her position as his wife.

In the dimly lit stairwell, Ethan took a long drag from his cigarette, the ember glowing faintly in the shadows.

His mind raced.

How did this even happen?

That one time—under those circumstances—and now she’s pregnant?

Just when I’m about to file for divorce, Vanessa drops this bombshell.

What the hell am I supposed to do now?

He exhaled sharply, the smoke curling into the air before dissipating.

One cigarette wasn’t enough.

He lit another.

And another.

Ethan had no intention of continuing this farce with Vanessa.

This kid couldn’t have come at a worse time.

His thoughts flickered to Evelyn.

After everything that happened tonight… is she okay?

The weight of his choices pressed down on him, heavier than the nicotine in his lungs.

"Why didn't she come to the hospital?"

The doctor had said Vanessa's condition was critical, but with enough rest, there was still hope for the baby.

Ethan Caldwell crushed another cigarette under his heel, the ashtray already overflowing. His fingers trembled slightly as he dialed Nathan Reeves.

"Did you track down who orchestrated the kidnapping? Who's pulling the strings?"

"Victor Kane confessed. He was paid to abduct Evelyn Carter. Vanessa Hart was just collateral damage—he didn’t even know who she was when he took her."

Nathan hesitated before adding, "As for the second attempt, the suspect vanished. All we know is Alexander Whitmore was the real target. Evelyn got caught in the middle."

Ethan’s grip tightened around his phone.

Alexander had enemies. Too many, from his days at the academy. Someone was clearly going after him through the people he loved.

"Who tipped Victor off about the payout for kidnapping Evelyn?"

"Damian Cross," Nathan answered.

The name sent a sharp spike of fury through Ethan’s veins.

Three years had passed since Damian confessed to his affair with Evelyn.

"Track down Damian. I need to know what he's been doing!"

Ethan remained by Vanessa's side throughout the night at the hospital—an unusual gesture from him.

When Vanessa stirred awake and spotted Ethan slumped on the couch, a mix of surprise and quiet delight flickered through her.

The doctor entered just then for morning rounds.

After a careful examination, the physician reassured her, "No further bleeding occurred overnight, which means we've moved past the critical phase."

"Still, caution is necessary. You're exhibiting symptoms of a threatened miscarriage. Strict bed rest for at least two more weeks is mandatory to protect the baby."

The words settled heavily in the room.

Vanessa's fingers curled into the sheets.

Ethan's gaze darkened, his jaw tightening imperceptibly.

Outside the window, dawn crept over Cresthaven, painting the sky in muted gold.

Somewhere in the city, Damian Cross was hiding.

And Alexander Whitmore would make sure he was found.
###Chapter 295 The Unthinkable Demand

Vanessa's hatred for Evelyn burned like acid in her veins.

"If only Evelyn hadn't been kidnapped," she seethed silently, "my baby wouldn't be suffering like this."

The moment the doctor stepped out, Ethan's voice cut through the sterile hospital air.

"Vanessa," he said, his tone chillingly detached, "you need to terminate the pregnancy."

Her breath hitched.

For a heartbeat, she wondered if she'd misheard.

"What... did you just say?"

"I'll arrange the finest specialists. No complications. No risks." His expression remained unreadable. "And I'll add another hundred million to your account—enough to secure your future."

He might as well have been discussing stock options.

When she didn't respond, his voice sharpened. "End this, and we'll finalize the divorce."

"No!"

Tears blurred her vision as she clutched her stomach.

"Ethan, I refuse! This child is ours—it's proof of what we shared!"

Her voice cracked on the last word, raw with desperation.

The heart monitor beeped faster, matching her racing pulse.

Ethan didn't flinch.

His next words landed like a guillotine.

"It's not a request."

Ethan's lips curled into a bitter smirk. Love? The word tasted like ash in his mouth. Is that what Vanessa and I ever shared?

Before he could voice his thoughts, Eleanor swept into the room.

The Caldwell name carried weight—enough that Vanessa's kidnapping had made headlines across Cresthaven.

Though Eleanor had never warmed to her daughter-in-law, the text she'd received at dawn had shaken her: I'm pregnant.

Her sharp eyes zeroed in on Vanessa's stomach. "Tell me everything. Is the child unharmed?"

Vanessa clutched Eleanor's arm like a drowning woman. "The baby's fine. But Ethan—he wants me to end it."

Eleanor whirled on her son, horrified. "Ethan! This could be your heir! How could you even consider—"

"Because he's leaving me!" Vanessa sobbed, her voice breaking. "He's choosing Evelyn! That scheming witch has him under her spell!"

Ethan's expression darkened, his glare sharp enough to draw blood.

Vanessa flinched but held her ground. She was out of options.

Eleanor's face paled. "Evelyn? But she's married to—"

The unspoken name hung between them like a guillotine. Alexander Whitmore.

Ethan's jaw tightened. This conversation was spiraling out of control.

Vanessa pressed her advantage, tears glistening. "He won't listen to reason. You have to make him see—this baby is a Caldwell!"

Eleanor's gaze flickered between them, calculating. A grandchild—or a scandal?

Ethan exhaled sharply. "This isn't about Evelyn."

"Liar!" Vanessa shot back.

Eleanor raised a hand, silencing them. "Enough." Her voice turned icy. "We'll discuss this privately, Ethan. After the doctor confirms the pregnancy."

Vanessa's breath hitched. Confirms?

Ethan's silence was answer enough.

Eleanor's heels clicked against the marble as she strode out, leaving the tension thick enough to choke on.

Vanessa's fingers trembled against her abdomen. She'd played her card.

Now, she could only wait to see if it would save her—or destroy them all.

"Ethan Caldwell, tell me the truth—did that woman actually seduce you?" Eleanor's voice was sharp with accusation.

Ethan ran a hand through his hair, frustration evident. "No, Mother. My decision to divorce Vanessa has nothing to do with Evelyn."

Vanessa's hands trembled as she clutched Eleanor's arm. "Eleanor, did you hear that? He said her name like she means something to him!"

Her voice cracked. "He's so obsessed with her that he's willing to abandon his own child! Please, make him see reason!"

Eleanor's expression darkened. "Evelyn Carter is shameless! After marrying Alexander Whitmore, she still dares to meddle in your life?"

She gripped Ethan's arm. "Have you forgotten how Alexander humiliated your father at Titan Capital? Don't provoke him again!"

Ethan had reached his limit.

"Vanessa!" His voice was ice. "Are you done with this ridiculous act? Stop dragging my mother into your delusions!"

He had tried to be civil, but this was the final straw.

Vanessa had always twisted the truth.

Evelyn had done nothing wrong.

Yet, Vanessa blamed her for everything.

Had she always been this manipulative?

The hospital room was silent except for the steady beeping of monitors.

Alexander's skin burned beneath Evelyn's fingertips as she pressed a cool cloth to his forehead. His fever had spiked dangerously high.

"You need to rest," she murmured, dabbing at the sweat along his jawline.

But the moment her fingers brushed his bare chest, everything changed.

In one swift motion, Alexander's hand shot out, gripping her wrist. Before Evelyn could react, he yanked her forward, flipping their positions with surprising strength for someone so ill.

"Alexander!" she gasped as his weight pinned her to the mattress.

His lips crashed against hers, hot and demanding. The taste of medicine mixed with something distinctly him—dark, intoxicating.

Evelyn turned her face away. "You're delirious with fever—"

His teeth grazed her earlobe, sending shivers down her spine. "I'm perfectly aware of what I'm doing."

The raw hunger in his half-lidded gaze made her breath catch. Even sick, Alexander Whitmore radiated dangerous magnetism.

She pressed her palms against his shoulders. "This isn't—"

"Tell me you don't want this," he challenged, his voice rough with fever and desire. His fingers traced the rapid pulse at her throat.

Evelyn's protest died in her throat. The hospital sheets tangled between them as Alexander's mouth found hers again, his kiss burning hotter than his fever.

Somewhere in the back of her mind, a warning bell rang—he was injured, they were in a hospital, this was madness.

But when his hand slid beneath her blouse, all rational thought evaporated.

The heart monitor's beeping grew erratic.

Just like her pulse.
###Chapter 296 Hospital Visit

"Me? I'll show you," Alexander murmured, his voice husky and dangerously alluring.

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson.

She wasn't the type to settle conflicts through intimate encounters—or whatever he was implying.

Yet Alexander was relentless, his lips claiming hers again and again with a feverish intensity that left her breathless.

As his kiss stole the air from her lungs, he whispered against her mouth, "Mrs. Whitmore, if I want relief, this is the best remedy."

Evelyn was speechless.

Did he really see her as some kind of human painkiller?

She wanted to scold him for misbehaving while he was ill, but he was determined, his hands roaming with purpose, his touch igniting sparks wherever they lingered.

Alexander, who always appeared so composed in public, was shockingly unrestrained in private.

Two words described him perfectly—deceptively wild.

Before she knew it, Evelyn found herself surrendering, his fevered skin making every caress feel electric, every moment charged with urgency.

Every slight movement drew a pained gasp from him, making Evelyn unsure whether it came from his injury or something far more primal.

His rough whisper against her ear sent dangerous shivers down her spine.

The worst part? The wound was dangerously close to his lower back.

Yet when he pulled her against him, his hands were unexpectedly tender.

That night, Evelyn discovered a side of Alexander she'd never known—raw, relentless, and utterly intoxicating.

Exhaustion finally claimed her, dragging her into sleep. When she woke, Alexander's skin still burned beneath her fingertips.

Fear coiled in her stomach—infection was a real risk. She forced fever reducers between his lips, praying they'd work.

Hours later, his temperature dropped, but unease still gnawed at her.

At dawn, she made the decision—they were going to the hospital.

The outpatient department provided a wheelchair, and she pushed Alexander inside, her grip tight on the handles.

He refused to let her exhaust herself running between departments. "Stay here," he ordered, before Simon wheeled him away for tests.

Alone in the sterile waiting room, Evelyn finally had time to think—and the memories from last night crashed over her like a wave.

The memory of yesterday's abduction still burned fresh in Evelyn's mind.

Her fingers clenched around the hospital bed sheets as she pieced together the clues.

Vanessa Hart was undoubtedly behind it.

And that brute Damian Cross from her foster family days was likely involved too.

Evelyn Carter wasn't the type to let injustice slide.

When she discovered Vanessa was also hospitalized, a cold determination settled over her.

After obtaining Vanessa's room number from the nurse's station, Evelyn strode down the sterile hallway without hesitation.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as she turned the corner.

Her heels clicked against the linoleum floor with purposeful rhythm.

Vanessa would answer for what she'd done.

And Evelyn would make sure of it.

297

The door to Vanessa's private room loomed ahead.

Evelyn's hand hovered over the handle.

She took a steadying breath.

This confrontation was long overdue.

With a sharp push, the door swung open.

Vanessa sat up abruptly in bed, her face paling.

"Surprised to see me?" Evelyn's voice dripped with icy calm.

The heart monitor beside Vanessa's bed began beeping faster.

Evelyn stepped inside and let the door click shut behind her.

The game had just changed.
###Chapter 297 She's Attempting to Charm Ethan!

The hospital room was quiet, with only Ethan keeping watch over Vanessa.

He lounged on the sofa, a cigarette between his fingers, exhaling a slow stream of smoke. His sharp eyes flickered with surprise when Evelyn stepped inside.

"After everything that happened last night, are you injured?" Ethan asked, his voice laced with something unreadable.

Evelyn hesitated.

Was Ethan actually worried about her?

Then it struck her.

When Alexander had carried her out of that abandoned warehouse, she had caught a glimpse of Ethan’s sleek black car parked nearby.

Her pulse quickened.

So, he had been there too?

But Vanessa had already been rescued by then.

Why had Ethan still been at the scene?

The world believed he had rushed there with fifty million dollars to save Vanessa.

But Evelyn knew the truth.

No one understood better than Ethan himself—his real concern had never been for Vanessa.

It had always been for her.

Ethan's unusual behavior sent a chill down Evelyn's spine. Instinctively, she took a step back, desperate to put distance between them.

Her heel caught on the leg of a chair behind her, throwing her off balance.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly. In one swift motion, he lunged forward and seized her wrist.

Just then, the door swung open.

Vanessa was wheeled in, fresh from her ultrasound. The doctor had insisted on a thorough examination—she hadn’t had a single proper prenatal checkup since becoming pregnant.

Eleanor had accompanied her, concerned about the baby’s development.

The sight before them made Eleanor freeze.

Vanessa’s eyes shimmered with unshed tears, as if she had finally caught Evelyn red-handed.

"Eleanor! See? I told you! She’s trying to seduce Ethan!"

Pale and fragile after a sleepless night, Vanessa looked like a wilting flower, her condition made worse by the baby’s complications.

Evelyn hadn’t expected Ethan to grab her like this.

The timing couldn’t have been worse.

The stumble had been barely noticeable—she wouldn’t have fallen.

Evelyn jerked her hand free from Ethan’s grip, her voice icy. "Me? Seduce him? Vanessa, what kind of nonsense are you spouting?"

Vanessa’s voice rose shrilly, as if volume alone could make her accusations true. "I saw it with my own eyes! Don’t even try to deny it!"

"Alexander has no idea what kind of woman you really are! Eleanor, you saw it too, didn’t you? It’s Evelyn—she’s shamelessly throwing herself at Ethan!"

Eleanor’s brow furrowed.

Lying on the stretcher, Vanessa might not have had a clear view, but Eleanor had seen everything standing up.

Ethan had been the one to approach Evelyn first. There had been space between them before.

Eleanor had no interest in fueling this drama—it wouldn’t benefit her son.

Besides, she had never liked Vanessa. Pregnancy didn’t grant her any special privileges in Eleanor’s eyes.

"Enough of your ridiculous accusations!" Eleanor snapped. "Just lie still and calm down."

Vanessa's eyes widened in shock as she stared at Eleanor.

Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably, her body trembling from the unexpected scolding.

The more Vanessa cried, the more Eleanor's irritation grew.

How could a woman like her ever be worthy of my son?

Ethan wanted a divorce, and now, of all times, Vanessa turns up pregnant.

Vincent had been sent abroad by Alexander, leaving Eleanor with nothing but Audrey and Sophia's relentless taunts.

Especially Sophia.

She never missed an opportunity to remind Eleanor how Vincent, as the eldest son, had failed to secure Titan Capital Group, allowing Alexander—raised outside the family—to push him out so effortlessly.

And Eleanor had no defense.

But a grandson… that could change everything.

If the baby was born, could Vincent use it as leverage to return?

Their family might finally be whole again.

That was why Eleanor was so desperate for this child.

Otherwise, if Ethan wanted a divorce, she would have gladly encouraged it.

###Chapter 298 The Night with Damian

There was a time when Vanessa's tears would shatter Ethan's heart, making him whisper sweet nothings until she calmed down.

But now, as she stood before him weeping yet again, all he felt was exhaustion.

No man had patience for a woman who cried at every little thing.

Ethan's gaze turned icy as he snapped, "Stop it. You're getting on my nerves."

Between his sharp words and Eleanor's scolding, Vanessa's tears halted mid-fall.

Not wanting Evelyn to witness the cracks in her relationship, Vanessa hastily wiped her face, forcing her emotions back under control.

"Perhaps I overreacted. Ethan would never betray me. No one could ever take him from me," Vanessa said, her eyes locked onto Evelyn with venom.

The hidden meaning in her words was obvious to everyone present.

Evelyn, however, found the entire display laughable.

Does Vanessa seriously see me as competition? she thought, amused.

The idea was ridiculous.

Evelyn had no interest in Ethan—not now, not ever.

Yet Vanessa clung to her delusions, desperate to paint her as the villain.

It was pathetic.

Evelyn turned away, unwilling to entertain the drama any longer.

But Vanessa wasn't done.

"You think you've won?" she hissed under her breath, just loud enough for Evelyn to hear.

Evelyn paused, then smirked.

Oh, sweetheart. You have no idea what winning even looks like.

The tension thickened, heavy with unspoken threats.

Ethan watched them both, his expression unreadable.

Something had shifted—irrevocably.

And deep down, Vanessa knew it.

Her grip on Ethan was slipping.

And she would do anything to get it back.

Even if it meant playing dirty.

Her gaze flickered toward the door, where a shadow lingered—Damian Cross, watching silently.

A plan was already forming in her mind.

One that would ruin Evelyn Carter for good.

I'd left that toxic relationship behind years ago, yet Ethan and Vanessa remained trapped in their endless cycle of bitterness.

The realization hit Evelyn like a cold splash of water—they had grown worlds apart.

She pulled out a chair and sat across from Vanessa, her voice steady. "Vanessa, let's be honest. Give me Damian's number. I need to contact him about something important."

Vanessa's face drained of color instantly.

"What kind of twisted joke is this? I don't have Damian's number!" Her voice rose sharply. "But you—you slept with him three years ago. You even had him kidnap me! Shouldn't you know how to reach him better than I do?"

Ethan's expression darkened at the accusation, and Eleanor stood frozen, her lips parted in shock.

Though she didn’t know who Damian was, the revelation that Evelyn had been with him long before marrying Alexander made her gaze turn icy with judgment.

So Evelyn wasn’t as pristine as she pretended to be.

Poor Alexander. He probably has no idea his wife has such a past.

"Mom," Ethan said abruptly, turning to Eleanor. His tone left no room for argument. "You should go. This isn’t your concern."

The tension in the room had thickened unbearably, and Eleanor’s presence only made it worse.

Eleanor was already preparing to depart. She couldn't wait to return and rub the news of her future grandchild in Harold, Audrey, and Sophia’s faces.

Before leaving, Eleanor gave Vanessa a few stern reminders—mostly about staying in bed—and then turned to go.

As she stepped into the hallway, she nearly collided with Simon, who was maneuvering a wheelchair out of the doctor’s office.

Alexander sat in it, his expression unreadable.

Eleanor’s lips curled slightly as she recalled the whispers she’d overheard earlier in the ward. She hadn’t intended to say anything, but the opportunity was too tempting to resist.

After all, Alexander had been the one to push her husband, Vincent, out of Titan Capital Group. The humiliation still stung.

Now, seeing him like this, she couldn’t help but feel a flicker of satisfaction.

"Alexander," she began, her tone dripping with false concern, "you should really be more careful about the company you keep. A man who’s never been in love is easy prey for scheming women."

Alexander’s gaze sharpened. "What are you implying?"

"Evelyn, before she married you… well…"

Eleanor let the words hang, her smile widening.

Simon stiffened beside the wheelchair, his grip tightening on the handles.

But Alexander merely tilted his head, his voice dangerously calm. "Finish your sentence, Eleanor."

She hesitated, sensing the shift in the air.

Then, with a dismissive flick of her wrist, she turned away. "Oh, never mind. Some things are better left unsaid."

She walked off, her heels clicking sharply against the tiles.

Alexander watched her go, his jaw tightening.

Simon exhaled slowly. "Sir, should I—?"

"Find out what she knows," Alexander cut in, his voice low. "Now."

Simon nodded and pulled out his phone.

Meanwhile, Eleanor rounded the corner, her smirk fading as she dialed a number.

"Grace?" she murmured into the phone. "We need to talk. It’s about Evelyn."

The line crackled with silence before Grace’s voice came through, sharp with curiosity. "What about her?"

Eleanor glanced over her shoulder, then lowered her voice.

"Let’s just say… our little problem might solve itself sooner than we thought."

The words hit Eleanor like a physical blow.

"Evelyn slept with her foster brother, Damian. Didn’t you know that?"

Recognition flashed in Eleanor’s eyes. That name—she’d heard it before.

Alexander’s expression darkened, his voice dangerously low. "Who told you that?"

Their gazes locked, and Eleanor felt the air between them grow heavy with tension.

299

The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Eleanor’s pulse raced. She had stumbled onto something far bigger than she realized.

Alexander’s jaw tightened. "Answer me."

She swallowed hard.

Who had revealed this secret?

And why now?

###Chapter 299 Wildfire Children

Alexander had spent a decade training at the FBI academy, and when his temper ignited, it was like staring into the eye of a storm. Even the slightest crease between his brows radiated enough intensity to make grown men flinch. Eleanor, usually unshakable, found herself momentarily frozen under that glare.

Eleanor, of course, assumed his fury stemmed from Evelyn’s tarnished reputation.

A smug smirk curled her lips as she tossed the blame. "Vanessa was the one who said it."

Alexander’s laugh was ice-cold. "Gossip is a poison best left to petty minds, Eleanor."

His voice dropped, sharp as a blade. "Spreading rumors is beneath a woman of your standing. Or have you decided to trade dignity for cheap entertainment?"

Before she could retort, Simon wheeled him away, leaving Eleanor standing rigid in the hallway.

Only when their figures vanished around the corner did the insult fully register.

Her nails dug into her palms. Did he just compare me to a common busybody?

Fury burned through her veins, her teeth clenched so tight her jaw ached.

Meanwhile, inside the hospital room, Evelyn’s gaze remained locked on Vanessa.

"Vanessa, you know whether our kidnapping was accidental or if you orchestrated it."

Vanessa blinked innocently. "What are you implying? If I had planned this, why would I let them take me too? And I'm carrying a child—why would I endanger myself and my baby?"

Evelyn's sharp gaze dropped to Vanessa's abdomen.

Pregnant?

Now it made sense why Eleanor had been so insistent on Vanessa staying in bed before their departure. It wasn’t just about Vanessa—it was about protecting the Caldwell heir.

Noticing Evelyn's stare, Vanessa smirked. "Evelyn, we both married into powerful families. I'm already expecting, while you still haven't managed to conceive. Is there... a problem?"

Her tone oozed such smug satisfaction that even Ethan shifted uncomfortably beside her.

Since when did Vanessa become this petty?

Evelyn arched a brow. "Vanessa, are you seriously treating pregnancy like some kind of competition? I don’t need a child to secure my husband’s loyalty—unlike you."

Vanessa’s triumphant expression shattered instantly.

Vanessa's mind reeled.

I thought only Ethan and I knew about the divorce papers. But from Evelyn's tone... she's been aware this whole time?

Her nails dug into her palms as she shot Ethan a venomous glare.

They must have met in secret. How dare he?

The humiliation burned through her.

Is he already moving on before the ink is even dry on our divorce?

Just then, Simon wheeled Alexander back into the room.

Alexander's sharp voice cut through the tension. "Since when does a woman's worth depend on bearing children?"

Evelyn seized the opportunity, flashing a saccharine smile. "Exactly. My husband is more than capable. When we're ready for a family, it'll happen naturally."

Ethan's jaw clenched.

His gaze involuntarily dropped to Alexander's lap, questions spiraling.

Is Evelyn truly satisfied with him? How often do they—

What if they've already—

In different—

The unspoken thoughts choked him.

Vanessa noticed his distraction, her lips curling into a bitter smirk.

Pathetic.

The air thickened with unspoken accusations.

Evelyn casually adjusted Alexander's blanket, her fingers lingering just a second too long on his thigh.

A silent challenge.

A declaration.

Mine.

Ethan looked away first.

Vanessa exhaled sharply through her nose.

This isn't over.

Not by a long shot.

###Chapter 300 The Missing Piece

Evelyn Carter had always possessed an enviable figure—her slender waist and graceful posture were the results of years spent accompanying her best friend Claire Dawson to ballet classes during their school days.

Though she never pursued dance professionally, those lessons gifted her with remarkable flexibility and poise that made her stand out effortlessly in any crowd.

Ethan Caldwell first noticed Evelyn during her late teens.

Back then, during study sessions at the library, hushed conversations among the boys often drifted toward the girls in their year.

Discussions about who was the most beautiful, who had the sweetest smile, or who carried themselves with the most elegance always circled back to one name—Evelyn Carter.

The boys couldn’t help but marvel at her long, toned legs, the kind that seemed sculpted rather than born.

Her proportions were the kind most guys secretly admired—slim yet undeniably feminine, with curves in all the right places.

At the time, Ethan didn’t know her name.

He hadn’t yet become the man who would one day save her.

But he remembered her—the girl with legs that seemed to go on forever, and eyes so clear they could strip away every lie with a single glance.

That fateful night in the restroom, when Ethan Caldwell rescued Evelyn Carter, was the moment her name finally clicked with her face in his mind.

It was a connection that seared itself into his memory, impossible to forget.

From then on, Evelyn invaded Ethan’s dreams relentlessly for an entire month.

The fantasies were vivid, intoxicating—and left him burning with shame every morning when he woke to find the sheets damp with proof of his desires.

Ethan had to admit it—he had wanted Evelyn for a long time.

Yet, during the seven years she pursued him, he never acted on those feelings.

Partly because her gaze was so innocent, so pure, that touching her felt like defiling something sacred.

And partly because he simply couldn’t bring himself to do it.

He was unwilling.

It was that simple.

But with Vanessa Hart, he never hesitated.

Their first time happened just a month after Evelyn was imprisoned.

That night, Vanessa called him, her voice trembling with tears as she whispered into the phone...

The memories haunted her.

Every time Evelyn closed her eyes, she saw those men—their rough hands, their cruel laughter—and the question that had shattered her: Would he still want you now?

Ethan Caldwell stayed with her that night, offering comfort in the only way he knew how.

They drank.

Ethan could usually hold his liquor, but that evening, barely half a glass in, the world blurred.

When he woke, the first thing he noticed was the unfamiliar ceiling of a hotel room.

The second was Vanessa Hart beside him.

Her first words cut through the fog of his confusion.

"Ethan, I knew you felt the same way about me. Last night… we…"

His gaze dropped to the sheets.

A dark stain stood out against the white fabric.

"It was my first time," Vanessa whispered.

It had been his too—though he remembered none of it.

The entire night was a blank, as if someone had taken an eraser to his mind.

But the proof was undeniable.

He couldn’t pretend it hadn’t happened just because his memory failed him.

Before that night, Ethan had never thought of Vanessa as anything more than his stepsister.

Everything changed after.

Now, hearing Evelyn say she was satisfied with Alexander in bed—

It carved something out of him.

Left him hollow.

The silence between them was suffocating.

Ethan Caldwell clenched his fists, his pride wounded. He wanted to snap back, to prove he wasn’t inadequate—but the words died in his throat.

Because he realized the bitter truth.

He didn’t even have the right to argue with Evelyn Carter anymore.

Not after everything.

The weight of that realization settled heavily in his chest, leaving him hollow.

Evelyn’s gaze was distant, as if she had already moved beyond him.

And maybe she had.

The thought twisted inside him, sharp and unrelenting.

He had lost her.

Not just her love.

But the right to stand before her as anything at all.
###Chapter 301 A Fatal Revelation

As Evelyn and Alexander walked away together, Ethan instinctively moved to follow. Vanessa immediately seized his arm.

"Ethan, even if you despise me, what about our baby? He's innocent. Don't you care about him at all?"

Her voice trembled with desperation.

She gestured around the room. "Look at all the doctors, nurses—even your mother. Everyone is fighting to save him. How can you, his father, be so cruel?"

Ethan gently brushed her hand away.

He settled back into his chair, his expression hardening. "Earlier, Evelyn asked you for Damian’s contact. You claimed you didn’t have it. Was that the truth?"

A flicker of unease crossed Vanessa’s face, but she masked it quickly.

Ethan didn’t catch it.

"Why would I have Damian’s number? Or have you forgotten? Three years ago, Evelyn paid him to kidnap me. He’s my enemy. I loathe him," she said, her tone steady.

Ethan drummed his fingers lightly against the table. "But last night, while you were asleep, I received a call. Guess who it was?"

His gaze locked onto hers, sharp and probing.

Vanessa’s breath hitched.

The air between them thickened with tension.

Ethan leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "He introduced himself as Damian Cross."

Vanessa’s fingers twitched.

She forced a laugh. "That’s impossible. He wouldn’t dare contact you."

Ethan’s lips curved into a cold smile. "Oh, he did. And he had quite a story to tell."

Her pulse spiked.

She swallowed hard. "What… did he say?"

Ethan’s eyes darkened. "Enough to make me question everything."

Vanessa’s grip on the edge of the table tightened.

She had miscalculated.

Badly.

Vanessa's expression darkened instantly.

Her voice was barely above a whisper. "Who told you?"

Ethan smirked, but his eyes remained icy. He studied Vanessa with a piercing gaze. "What do you think?"

Silence stretched between them.

"Vanessa, so you've been secretly communicating with Damian all this time?" His tone sharpened. "Wasn't he the one who tried to abduct you three years ago? Why would you keep in touch with someone like that? Don’t I deserve an explanation?"

Her pulse raced. Lies formed effortlessly on her tongue. "Ethan, it’s not what it looks like! Damian has been harassing me for years. He wouldn’t stop calling!"

Ethan let out a cold laugh.

"Then why didn’t you tell Evelyn when she asked for his number?"

Some truths were better left buried. The more you dug, the uglier they became.

At this point, Ethan couldn’t tell which of Vanessa’s words were real and which were fabricated.

Without another word, he gave her one last disappointed look before turning away.

Vanessa froze, a cold shiver racing down her spine.

Her fingers trembled as she snatched her phone from the nightstand, frantically scrolling through her call logs.

No trace of Damian’s call.

Heart pounding, she dialed his number without hesitation.

The line rang endlessly before a rough, sleep-heavy voice finally answered. "What?"

"Damian, did you call me last night?"

"Hell no."

The words hit her like ice water.

Her stomach twisted. Ethan was testing me.

He had set a trap—checking if she was still in contact with Damian.

Her face paled as the realization sank in. She had played right into his hands.

Despite her claims that Damian had been harassing her, Ethan’s cold, knowing stare when he left told her everything. He didn’t believe a word.

"Seriously? You woke me up at dawn for this?" Damian grumbled before hanging up.

Vanessa’s grip on the phone tightened.

She had just given herself away.

The memory of her near-miscarriage still burned in Vanessa's mind, a searing pain that refused to fade. She turned her fury toward Damian, her voice sharp with accusation.

"What the hell happened last night? The kidnapping was supposed to go smoothly, yet somehow, I ended up being dragged into it too!" Her fingers clenched into fists. "You took my money and failed. Pathetic."

She paced the dimly lit room, her heels clicking against the hardwood floor. Every step echoed her frustration.

"Did you think I wouldn’t notice your incompetence? Or did you just decide to double-cross me?" Her glare could have cut glass.

Damian remained silent, his jaw tight.

Vanessa scoffed. "If you can’t handle a simple job, then you’re useless to me." She leaned in, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "And useless men don’t get paid."

The air between them crackled with tension.

She wasn’t just angry—she was humiliated. The plan had been flawless. Or so she’d thought.

Now, everything was falling apart.

And she refused to be the one left holding the pieces.

###Chapter 302 Turn a Blind Eye to Your Brother's Outburst

Damian Cross seethed with humiliation.

Being berated by a woman was a first for him.

And patience had never been his strong suit.

"Vanessa, who the hell do you think you are?" His voice dripped with venom. "Just some worthless trash I've already tossed aside, and now you dare raise your voice at me? You’ve got some nerve!"

Vanessa’s face paled instantly at his crude words.

Her grip on the phone tightened. "Shut your mouth! Don’t you dare spew that filth!"

"Filth?" Damian scoffed. "Oh, but you didn’t seem to mind when you were—"

The door swung open.

Richard Hayes and Margaret stepped into the room, their presence cutting through the tension.

Richard’s sharp gaze landed on Vanessa, who was clutching her phone like a lifeline. "Vanessa, who are you shouting at?"

Her breath hitched. "N-No one. It’s nothing."

With trembling fingers, she ended the call before he could press further.

Richard studied her for a moment but said nothing more.

The silence that followed was deafening.

His gaze instantly dropped to Vanessa's rounded abdomen. "You're expecting?"

Vanessa gave a small nod.

The Harts had rushed over at dawn after hearing about the kidnapping incident.

Richard's face lit up with genuine joy. "This is wonderful news!"

"Make sure to rest properly. Once this baby arrives, you'll command real respect in the Whitmore family."

Vanessa chewed her lower lip, the weight of her secrets pressing down on her.

She hadn't breathed a word to her family about the divorce turmoil with Ethan.

How could she possibly tell Richard that Ethan had shown no excitement about the pregnancy? That he'd even coldly suggested termination?

Margaret, ever the observant woman, noticed what her husband missed.

Her sharp eyes scanned the conspicuously empty space beside Vanessa. "You're carrying Ethan's child. Why is this place so deathly quiet? Where is he? Shouldn't he be here with you?"

Vanessa tilted her head downward. "He... had urgent business to attend to."

Richard's brows knitted together. "What could possibly be more urgent than being with his pregnant wife?"

"Even if he's tied up, where's the rest of the Whitmore clan?"

The unspoken question hung heavily in the air - why wasn't Alexander here either?

Vanessa's fingers twisted the edge of her blouse, the fabric stretching taut under her nervous grip. The grandfather clock in the hallway ticked ominously, each second amplifying her discomfort.

Margaret reached out, placing a comforting hand over her daughter's trembling ones. The warmth did little to melt the ice forming in Vanessa's chest.

Outside, a car door slammed.

Vanessa's head jerked up, hope flashing across her face before she could school her features.

But the footsteps approaching weren't the confident stride she'd recognize anywhere.

The disappointment tasted bitter on her tongue.

Richard exchanged a loaded glance with his wife. Something was very wrong here.

Vanessa swallowed hard, her throat suddenly dry.

How much longer could she keep up this charade?

The baby kicked sharply, as if sensing her distress.

She placed a protective hand over her belly, making a silent vow.

No matter what, she would protect this child.

Even if it meant standing alone against the entire Whitmore dynasty.

Margaret's sharp eyes scanned the empty hallway. "Where's your mother-in-law? And why haven't I seen a single servant in this entire mansion?"

Vanessa nervously chewed her bottom lip. "I... I enjoy solitude. I dismissed all the staff."

The explanation didn't convince Margaret for a second.
Her maternal instincts screamed that her daughter was concealing something painful.

"Vanessa," Margaret's voice softened with concern, "are the Caldwells mistreating you?"

Tears immediately pooled in Vanessa's hazel eyes, confirming Margaret's worst fears.

Richard needed no further explanation.
His face darkened with paternal fury.
"This is unacceptable! The Caldwells dare treat my daughter this way? Do they think the Hayes family is beneath them?"

Richard turned on his heel, ready to storm Whitmore Manor and demand answers.

A lazy drawl stopped him mid-stride.
Oliver leaned casually against the ornate doorframe, his smirk dripping with disdain.
"Vanessa's just the side piece. What exactly did you expect from a family like the Caldwells? They'd have to be insane to give her any real status."

"Don't you dare speak about your sister that way!" Richard's voice shook with rage.

Oliver barked a humorless laugh.
"Sister? That gold-digging social climber is no sister of mine. The Hayes bloodline doesn't mix with kept women."

Richard recoiled as if struck.
"You—"

Oliver Hayes, with his usual arrogance, curled his lip in a sneer and flipped Vanessa Hart off.

Richard Hayes clenched his jaw, irritation simmering beneath the surface, but he couldn’t bring himself to snap at his son.

Surprisingly, Oliver’s crude remark had a strange effect—it cooled Richard’s temper slightly.

He knew better than to provoke the Caldwell family right now.

"Vanessa, don’t mind your brother’s foul mood," Richard said, forcing a calm tone. "He’s just being an idiot. Don’t take it to heart."

Vanessa’s face twisted with fury and frustration, her stomach knotting painfully from the tension.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love After Betrayal (Evelyn)

###Chapter 303 Karma's Bite

"Everyone out. I need to rest!"

Vanessa Hart's sharp command sliced through the tension.

A month ago, she might have faked politeness. But now? With her world collapsing and stress gnawing at her sanity, she couldn't spare even a shred of patience for the Hayes family.

The moment the hospital door clicked shut, Margaret Hayes bit her lip. Her thoughts spiraled to Evelyn Carter—caught in last night's storm too. "I hope Evelyn's alright."

Richard Hayes scoffed. "It's Christmas Eve, and she couldn't even send a text. Why waste concern on her?"

Margaret stayed silent, but Oliver Hayes' fingers twitched. His gaze flickered with unease.

"Mom, can I use your phone?"

Margaret handed it over, frowning. "Where's yours?"

"Gone." Oliver shrugged, jaw tight.

Strange. His phone had vanished two days prior. No trace. No explanation.

Margaret's eyes narrowed. "Calling your sister, aren't you?"

The call went straight to voicemail again. Margaret sighed, shaking her head. "You're wasting your time. Evelyn blocked both me and Richard months ago."

Oliver's voice was icy. "Feeling guilty now? You and Dad did more than enough to earn this."

Richard's brows furrowed. "Watch your mouth. What exactly did I do wrong?"

"You really don’t know?" Oliver snapped. "While I was studying overseas, you sent my sister to prison and lied to me, telling me she was deployed with no access to phones. Sound familiar?"

Richard scoffed. "She brought it on herself by crossing Vanessa!"

Oliver let out a bitter laugh. "Vanessa sheds a single tear, and you jump to her defense every time. Do you even remember who your real daughter is? Choosing an adopted child over your own flesh and blood? No wonder Horizon Enterprises is always one step away from collapse."

Richard's face darkened with rage. "Oliver! How dare you speak to me like that!"

"Unless you fix things with Evelyn, you're not my father. If you keep letting her suffer, you mean nothing to me."

Margaret quickly stepped between them, her voice strained. "Both of you, stop this. Let’s just take a breath."

Richard turned his fury on her. "Look what you've done—spoiled him rotten until he thinks he can talk back to me!"

Richard's rage burned hot, but he couldn't bring himself to discipline Oliver. Instead, he redirected his fury toward Margaret.

Margaret recoiled, the injustice of it slicing through her.

"Spoiled him?" Her voice trembled with indignation. "I raised a son who earned a full scholarship to an Ivy League school. That’s my unforgivable sin?"

The mention of Oliver’s academic achievement momentarily cooled Richard’s temper.

Only a handful of students received such an honor each year. Richard had basked in the pride, his chest swelling as word spread through their social circles.

It was one of the reasons he’d always indulged Oliver.

Oliver’s gaze was icy as it flickered between his parents.

"I’m bringing Evelyn home myself." His tone left no room for argument. "You will apologize to her—properly. This is your last chance. If you waste it, neither of us will ever step foot in this house again."

The silence that followed was thick with tension, the weight of his ultimatum settling over them like a storm cloud.

###Chapter 304 First Encounter

The following morning, Alexander arranged to meet Evelyn at an exclusive private dining suite in Cresthaven's most luxurious hotel.

He insisted on driving to pick her up personally.

When Evelyn caught sight of her younger brother after all these years, her breath hitched.

Has Oliver really grown this much? He stood well over six feet now, his boyish features replaced by the sharp angles of adulthood.

Five years. It had been five long years since they'd last seen each other.

"Evelyn."

The moment she stepped out, Alexander's gaze locked onto her, scanning for any sign of injury. Only when he confirmed she was unharmed did the tension leave his shoulders.

Rumors of Evelyn's harsh treatment in prison had haunted him. The guilt twisted like a knife in his chest.

"I should've—"

Evelyn silenced him with a gentle squeeze to his arm. Some wounds didn't need reopening.

None of this was Oliver's fault. The Hayes family had made sure he remained oblivious.

He was completely in the dark.

“This is my husband, Alexander Whitmore,” Evelyn announced.

Oliver’s gaze immediately locked onto the man standing beside her.

In the days leading up to this meeting, Oliver had discreetly reached out to old contacts to gather information about Alexander.

The consensus was clear—Alexander was a man of integrity, untarnished by scandal.

Yet, despite the glowing reports, Oliver couldn’t resist sizing him up with a critical stare.

He needed to judge for himself.

Oliver offered a curt nod, his youthful pride barely concealed.

Noticing his attitude, Evelyn flicked his forehead lightly. “This is my husband. Stop acting like you’re inspecting merchandise! Show some manners and greet him properly.”

Caught off guard by her scolding, Oliver bristled with irritation.

I’m not a child anymore! Why does she still treat me like one?

His eyes flicked to Alexander, who seemed to be suppressing an amused smile, and his embarrassment flared hotter.

“Alexander,” Oliver muttered grudgingly.

Nathan patted him on the shoulder. "Good job."

Oliver thought, What the hell? Is he treating me like a child? I'm Evelyn's brother!

Biting back his irritation, Oliver forced himself to stay composed in front of Evelyn.

I even opened the front passenger door for him, and Evelyn pulled Alexander into the back seat. Do they see me as nothing more than a chauffeur now?

Gritting his teeth, Oliver drove with a scowl, his grip tight on the steering wheel.

When they arrived, Alexander deliberately lingered behind.

"What do you think of the limited-edition Ferrari that launched last week?" Alexander asked casually.

Oliver blinked. "Huh?"

Alexander tossed him a set of keys.

Oliver caught them instinctively. The moment he saw the prancing horse emblem, his mind short-circuited for a solid three seconds.

Alexander smirked. "Consider it a welcome gift."

"The keys are in the ignition. It's parked in the underground garage of Maple Leaf Mall."

With those clipped words, Alexander strode into Cresthaven Hotel without a backward glance.

Oliver stood frozen on the sidewalk, the valet ticket dangling from his fingers.

His mind reeled.

Alexander Whitmore was gifting him a car?

Not just any car—but that obsidian black Lamborghini Aventador SVJ they'd seen at last month's auto show?

"Alexander! Hold on!"

Oliver's shout echoed across the marble plaza as he sprinted after the retreating figure. His dress shoes slipped on the polished stone, but he barely noticed.

The valet's startled expression mirrored his own disbelief.

This couldn't be real.

Yet the weight of the key fob in his palm felt dangerously tangible.

Oliver's pulse hammered against his ribs.

What game was Alexander playing now?

The revolving doors swallowed Alexander's broad shoulders before Oliver could catch up.

Through the glass, Oliver saw the concierge bowing deeply to his brother-in-law.

Typical.

He clenched the keys until the ridges bit into his skin.

The Lamborghini's alarm chirped in response from three levels below.

Oliver exhaled sharply.

First time indeed.

###Chapter 305 Empty Words

The private room door swung open, revealing Richard and Margaret already standing to greet them. Alexander's unexpected presence earned only a fleeting glance from Evelyn.

She'd anticipated this.

Tonight's dinner was nothing but a carefully orchestrated peace offering—Richard and Margaret using Oliver as their golden ticket to mend bridges.

"Evelyn! There you are." Margaret's smile was all practiced warmth as she waved for menus. "Let's order immediately, shall we?"

Evelyn scanned the selections with deliberate slowness, choosing three dishes before sliding the menu toward Alexander without meeting his eyes. Her indifference toward her parents was palpable, her attention laser-focused on Oliver instead.

She grilled him about university, his latest flings, his terrible taste in music. Alexander observed in silence, the ghost of amusement playing on his lips whenever Evelyn made Oliver groan with her teasing.

On Oliver's third desperate glance toward Richard, the older man finally elbowed Margaret with visible reluctance.

"Evelyn," Margaret began, fingers twisting her napkin. "We...wanted to apologize. Properly. We realize now how unfairly we treated you." A strained pause. "Can we just...pretend tonight is normal? Like a real family dinner?"

Evelyn appeared not to hear Margaret's plea, turning instead to Oliver. "You lost your phone? Are you sure it wasn’t taken from home?"

"Home?" Oliver's brows knitted together. "I’ve turned the entire house upside down. Who would take it?"

Then, realization flashed across his face. "Vanessa?"

"Evelyn, please," Margaret begged, her voice trembling. "I’m trying to fix things between us. Won’t you at least acknowledge me?"

Evelyn remained indifferent, swiping through her phone before thrusting it toward Oliver.

"Three days ago, I received a text from your number," she said coldly. "It asked me to meet at the Maple Leaf Café on the west side. When I arrived, Vanessa was the one waiting inside."

Oliver took the phone, his eyes scanning the screen.

It was undeniably his number.

"But why would Vanessa steal my phone?" he muttered, confusion lacing his words.

Even Margaret had gone quiet now, her earlier apology abandoned.

"When I walked into that café, I was ambushed," Evelyn continued, her voice sharp. "What do you think she wanted with your phone? She used it to set a trap—to get me alone so her hired thugs could grab me."

The air in the room grew thick with tension, every face reflecting a different emotion.

Richard's brows knitted together in disapproval. "Evelyn, enough with these baseless claims. This isn't a joking matter! Why would Vanessa ever do such a thing? What possible motive could she have?"

"Every time I speak up, you dismiss me as spouting nonsense. Fine. If you refuse to listen, there's no point in me staying for this dinner!" Evelyn retorted sharply, grabbing Alexander's arm as she made to storm out.

Margaret swiftly blocked her path. "Evelyn, wait! Let's discuss this properly."

She shot Richard a chastising glare. "Will you let your daughter explain herself?"

Margaret had long suspected Richard favored Vanessa over his own family, but now she was certain—his protectiveness toward Vanessa surpassed even his concern for his own wife.

"Evelyn, if Vanessa planned the kidnapping, why was she taken too?" Margaret asked, confusion lacing her voice.

"Because the kidnappers couldn’t tell us apart, so they took both of us to be safe," Evelyn clarified.

Richard scoffed, his expression dripping with derision.

"Listen to this—she claims Vanessa masterminded the abduction, yet insists the kidnappers didn’t recognize her. How does that even—"

His words were cut off as Alexander's phone buzzed loudly on the table. The screen lit up with an unknown number. A heavy silence descended as Evelyn's breath hitched.

Margaret's grip on Evelyn's shoulder tightened. "Answer it."

Alexander swiped to accept the call, putting it on speaker. A distorted voice crackled through:

"Still doubting her story, Mr. Hayes? Maybe this will convince you."

A blood-curdling scream pierced the air—Vanessa's voice, raw with terror. Then, the line went dead.

Evelyn's face drained of color. Richard staggered back as if struck.

The grandfather clock in the hallway ticked ominously, each second stretching into eternity.

Margaret was the first to break the silence. "Now do you believe her?"

Richard opened his mouth, but no words came out. His hands trembled visibly.

Alexander's jaw clenched. "We need to call the police. Now."

Evelyn shook her head violently. "No! They said they'd kill her if we involved authorities."

A porcelain vase shattered in the hallway—Vanessa's favorite, the one she'd brought back from Italy last summer. The sound seemed to snap Richard out of his daze.

His voice was barely a whisper when he finally spoke:

"What have I done?"

Outside, thunder rumbled in the distance. The storm was coming.

"Contradictory? If Vanessa hired the kidnappers, how could they not recognize her and end up kidnapping her too?"

Evelyn scoffed, her fingers tightening around her glass. "The men Vanessa hired were Damian’s crew. Damian gave the orders, but his thugs carried out the abduction. They wouldn’t have known us apart. Isn’t that obvious?"

Richard’s expression darkened. "That makes even less sense. How could Vanessa possibly be connected to Damian?"

His voice dripped with skepticism. "Three years ago, you and Damian worked together to kidnap Vanessa. If there’s any connection, it should be between you and him."

Evelyn’s patience snapped. The glass in her hand shattered against the marble floor, shards scattering like broken trust.

"I’ve told you a thousand times—that entire incident was Vanessa’s setup!" Her voice trembled with frustration. "Richard, are you deliberately misunderstanding me? Whether you believe me or not doesn’t matter. I’ll find the evidence myself and clear my name."

She pushed back her chair, the legs scraping sharply against the floor. But before she could storm out, Margaret’s hand shot out, gripping her wrist with surprising strength.

"Evelyn," her mother said firmly, "the food hasn’t even been served. Sit down. You’re not leaving this table."

The tension in the room thickened, heavy as the silence before a storm.

Secret Longing: A Love Reborn After Betrayal (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 306 Why Should I Forgive You?

The waiter arrived just then, setting down their meals with practiced elegance.

Margaret picked up the silver spoon, her hands trembling slightly as she ladled a generous portion of clam chowder into Evelyn’s bowl. She pushed it toward her daughter with a hesitant smile.

"I remember how obsessed you were with this soup as a child," Margaret murmured, nostalgia softening her voice. "You’d finish an entire bowl every single day after school."

Cresthaven Hotel was known for its exclusivity, serving only the rarest ingredients to its elite clientele.

The menu boasted delicacies from around the world, yet something as humble as clam chowder wasn’t listed.

Evelyn hadn’t seen it when she ordered.

But now, the familiar scent wafted toward her, stirring memories she’d tried to bury. She met Margaret’s hopeful gaze, hesitated, then finally sank back into her seat.

Margaret exhaled in quiet relief, her shoulders relaxing just a fraction.

For a fleeting moment, regret flickered in her chest.

Three years ago, Evelyn’s words still haunted her: "It was all Vanessa’s doing. She set me up."

But back then, Margaret hadn’t listened.

Now, she wondered if it was too late to make amends.

"Whether you believe me or not doesn't matter. I'll find the proof to clear my name," Evelyn had declared through tears back then.

At the time, no one had trusted her. No one had given her the chance to prove her innocence before they locked her away.

Three years had passed since that night, yet doubts still gnawed at Margaret's conscience.

Vanessa's recent erratic behavior made Margaret wonder—had she been wrong all along?

The thought chilled her. If so, how broken must Evelyn have been during those three years?

Surrounded by those who should have stood by her, yet abandoned by everyone. Suffering alone behind bars.

Dinner passed in tense silence. Margaret's emotions churned so violently she couldn't even meet Evelyn's eyes by the meal's end.

Richard attempted several times to engage Alexander in business talk. But after their earlier confrontation with Evelyn, approaching the younger man now felt beneath his dignity.

The patriarch hated playing supplicant. He kept shooting Margaret meaningful glances, willing her to bridge the awkward gap between them. But Margaret—

Evelyn seemed lost in thought, paying Richard no attention.

Oliver kicked Richard under the table—a clear signal for him to apologize to Evelyn for his earlier behavior.

Richard stayed silent. His polished black shoes now bore scuff marks from Oliver’s kick, yet his expression remained stubbornly unrepentant.

Oliver wanted to snap at him, but he held back. He couldn’t risk Alexander thinking the Hayes family lacked manners, that their children were disrespectful to their elders. That would reflect poorly on Evelyn.

After dinner, Alexander excused himself to greet a business associate, disappearing into a private room for drinks.

Richard and Oliver headed toward the restrooms.

Margaret, seeing her chance, approached Evelyn immediately.

“Evelyn, can we talk?” Margaret’s eyes were red-rimmed, her fingers clutching the bracelet Evelyn had gifted her years ago.

At the sight of it, Evelyn finally looked up. “About what?”

Margaret swallowed hard, her voice barely above a whisper. “When I spoke to you before…” Her words trailed off, heavy with regret.

The words hung heavy in the air between them. Margaret Hayes studied her daughter, Evelyn Carter, searching for any sign of softening.

Earlier, it hadn’t just been an act. She truly wanted to repair what had been broken between them.

But Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable, her gaze as cold as winter frost.

A knot of unease twisted in Margaret’s stomach. There were too many unknowns—too many secrets between Richard and Vanessa Hart that she didn’t understand.

With no one else to turn to, she had come to Evelyn. Her own daughter.

Perhaps only Evelyn could truly grasp the depth of her regret.

"Evelyn," Margaret began, her voice trembling slightly. "I’ll do anything to earn your forgiveness. Anything." She hesitated, then plunged forward. "I think… I think there might be something going on between your father and Vanessa."

Evelyn’s lips curled into a bitter smile.

"Now you want to fix things?" Her voice was sharp, cutting through the silence like a blade. "After all this time? After everything you’ve done?"

She crossed her arms, her posture rigid with defiance.

"Do you really think one apology is enough to erase the past?"

Margaret flinched, but Evelyn wasn’t finished.

"Why should I forgive you?"

The question lingered, heavy and unanswered.

###Chapter 307 That Reckless Brat!

Margaret exhaled sharply, her chest tightening with regret.

Evelyn withdrew her hand from Margaret’s grasp, stepping back with an unreadable expression before turning and striding out of the private room without another word.

Tears welled in Margaret’s eyes, her throat burning as she suddenly crumpled forward, burying her face in her hands. Her shoulders shook with silent sobs against the polished table.

What have I done? The thought clawed at her. Evelyn won’t even spare me a single word of comfort now.

When Richard and Oliver returned from the restroom, they froze at the sight of Margaret weeping uncontrollably.

Richard arched a brow, his tone dry. "It’s a holiday, and you’re drowning in tears? What’s this melodrama about?"

Margaret lifted her head, her gaze sharp with betrayal.

How can he be so cold? Her mind seethed. If it were Vanessa crying, he’d be on his knees begging to soothe her.

The injustice of it only stoked her fury hotter.

She slammed her palms on the table, her voice cracking with accusation. "Why did you secretly give Vanessa money behind my back? Why is thirty million dollars suddenly missing from my account?"

Richard Hayes' face contorted with guilt.

Nathan Reeves' expression turned glacial.

His voice was sharp as ice. "Richard, you gave Vanessa Hart thirty million dollars? Evelyn only received ten million! Have you completely lost your mind?"

Richard hadn't expected Margaret to expose this in front of Nathan.

He stammered, "Vanessa needs the funds—she's with the Caldwell family now. What's wrong with giving her a little extra?"

"Vanessa needs it, but so does Evelyn! She's an elder in the Whitmore family—she needs more to distribute among the juniors! Why didn’t you give her anything?"

Nathan didn’t hesitate. He reached over and began rifling through Richard’s pockets, pulling out a sleek black unlimited card.

"What the hell are you doing?" Richard lunged for it, but Nathan, taller and stronger, held it just out of reach.

Richard jumped, but his fingers barely grazed the edge.

"Either transfer fifty million to Evelyn right now, or I’m keeping this. Your choice."

Richard’s face darkened with fury. "Fifty million? What has Evelyn ever done for me?"

"Because Evelyn is family! And you owe her! Not a single cent stays with you!"

Within minutes, Evelyn, idly scrolling through her phone, noticed an unexpected deposit—$50 million—appearing in her account. Her brows furrowed in confusion.

Why would Richard suddenly transfer this much? Does he really think money can fix everything?

The transaction note read: [My dearest daughter, a small Christmas gift. Don’t refuse it—just accept it with love.]

Evelyn scoffed. Since when did Richard become this sentimental?

Still, she accepted the money, though suspicion lingered. With a smirk, she typed back: [If you know it’s small, why not make it bigger?]

On the other end, Oliver, holding Richard’s phone, didn’t hesitate.

Another $50 million was transferred instantly, followed by a message: [You’re absolutely right, sweetheart.]

Richard’s face twisted in horror.

That reckless brat!

His carefully hidden savings—years of secret stashes—were disappearing before his eyes.

And there was nothing he could do about it.

###Chapter 308 The Unseen Observer

Evelyn hesitated in the corridor as Alexander stepped out from his business associate's private suite. A distinguished-looking man, clearly the head of the company, followed him out to bid farewell. Alexander gave him a polite nod. "There's no need to escort me, Mr. Cole."

Benjamin Cole's sharp gaze immediately landed on Evelyn standing nearby. Adjusting his glasses with a refined gesture, he inquired, "Is this Mrs. Whitmore?"

Alexander confirmed with a brief, "Yes."

Instantly, Benjamin's demeanor shifted into warm hospitality. He stepped forward, extending his hand. "Mrs. Whitmore, it's an absolute pleasure. I'm Benjamin Cole from Horizon Enterprises. I’ve heard nothing but praise about you."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. She glanced at Alexander, who gave her an encouraging nod, prompting her to respond, "The pleasure is mine." She recognized Horizon Enterprises—Titan Capital Group had recently partnered with them on a major venture. No doubt, Benjamin’s courtesy stemmed from Alexander’s influence.

Benjamin smiled warmly. "You performed a breathtaking cello piece at Titan Capital’s gala. My wife hasn’t stopped talking about it—she’s been desperate to meet you. In fact, her birthday is coming up soon. Would you do us the honor of attending as our special guest?"

Evelyn’s breath caught. She hadn’t expected anyone to remember—

The applause still echoed in Evelyn Carter's ears as she stepped away from her cello performance. The wealthy elite often mingled at such events, so when Benjamin Cole approached with an invitation, she didn't hesitate.

"Your playing was exquisite," Benjamin said warmly. "My wife and I would love to host you at our estate next week for a private gathering."

Evelyn glanced at Alexander Whitmore beside her before responding. "That sounds lovely. I'd be honored."

"Perfect! Expect an invitation soon," Benjamin replied before excusing himself to rejoin his guests.

The moment he was gone, Alexander's fingers brushed lightly against her shoulder. "You usually avoid these kinds of affairs."

She tilted her head up at him. "Since you're collaborating with Mr. Cole, refusing would be impolite."

His jaw tightened slightly. "You don’t have to force yourself for my sake."

A small smile curved her lips. "Consider it networking. A little social practice never hurts."

Alexander's expression darkened as he changed the subject. "Earlier, you mentioned Vanessa Hart orchestrated your kidnapping?"

That night had been chaos—betrayal, pursuit, and the remnants of a criminal group he'd failed to dismantle during his police academy days. They had taken Evelyn to that abandoned building, but he hadn’t accounted for the second set of kidnappers.

He never expected Vanessa to be bold enough to target someone under his protection.

Alexander's deep voice broke the silence. "Do you need my assistance?"

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "I'll deal with this alone. This is between Vanessa and me. You shouldn't involve yourself." It would be overkill—like bringing a sword to a fistfight.

In Evelyn's eyes, a man of Alexander's stature was far too formidable for someone as petty as Vanessa. Besides, this was a woman's battle. His interference would only tarnish his dignity.

Recognizing her determination, Alexander didn't press further. They were husband and wife, and he respected her choices.

Moreover, when it came to settling debts, true satisfaction came from delivering the blow yourself. If he stepped in, he'd rob her of that sweet, personal victory.

They exited the Cresthaven Hotel side by side, too absorbed in their conversation to notice the shadow lurking nearby.

Ethan had been watching them for a while.

Ever since Oliver brought them to Cresthaven, Ethan had followed at a careful distance. He witnessed Alexander gifting Oliver a sleek sports car. He observed them dining privately with the Hayes family.

While they feasted behind closed doors, Ethan remained outside, his gaze fixed on the entrance. He couldn't hear their words, but he saw the way Alexander stood beside Evelyn—protective, possessive.

The sight burned in his chest.

Ethan clenched his fists. He had underestimated Alexander Whitmore. The man wasn’t just wealthy—he was powerful, connected. And worst of all, he had Evelyn.

But Ethan wasn’t done yet.

He stepped forward, his footsteps silent against the polished marble floor. The game wasn’t over. Not even close.

Evelyn Carter would regret choosing Alexander over him.

And Ethan would make sure of it.

It should have been him standing there.

Ethan Caldwell's grip tightened around his glass until his knuckles turned white. The crystal threatened to shatter beneath the pressure of his frustration.

Across the room, Evelyn Carter laughed at something Alexander Whitmore whispered in her ear. The sound was like music—soft, enchanting, and utterly devastating.

Ethan's chest ached.

He was nothing more than a spectator now, forced to watch from the shadows as the woman he loved belonged to someone else. The irony was cruel. Once, she had looked at him with those same sparkling eyes, her lips curved in that same breathtaking smile.

Now, she didn’t even glance his way.

The bitterness rose like bile in his throat. He was invisible to her, a ghost of the past she had long since buried.

Every fiber of his being screamed for her attention.

Just one look.

One fleeting moment where her gaze would find his again, where she would remember what they once had.

He would give anything for it.

Anything.

The glass trembled in his hand.

He was losing himself in this torment, drowning in the weight of his own regrets.

And yet, he couldn’t turn away.

Because even this pain—this unbearable, suffocating agony—was better than the emptiness of a world where she no longer existed in his life.

So he stayed.

Watching.

Waiting.

Hoping.

Like a man condemned to purgatory, forever trapped between what was and what could have been.

###Chapter 309 Shadowed Steps

The moment the 100 million dollar transfer from Richard cleared, Evelyn Carter made a beeline for the luxury boutiques. She had her eyes set on a rare designer clutch—this year's most coveted Christmas gift for Claire Dawson.

Claire had first heard about Evelyn's abduction through breaking news alerts on her phone. The call that followed was explosive. "How could you keep this from me?" Claire's voice cracked through the speaker, equal parts fury and fear.

Evelyn hadn't meant to withhold the truth. The trauma had left her numb. Between Alexander's hospitalization and the police interrogations, two days had slipped by before she realized she'd never called her best friend.

When Claire unwrapped the six-figure limited-edition bag—the same one fashion editors were calling "this season's holy grail"—her manicured fingers froze mid-air. "Wait. This isn't a joke?"

As a Vogue contributor, Claire recognized the diamond-stitched leather instantly. The waiting list for this piece exceeded twelve months. Even celebrity stylists couldn't secure it through backchannels.

"You do realize Alexander's fortune has limits," Claire hissed, stroking the python-skin trim. "Gifting this to your college roommate? His accountants will have aneurysms."

Evelyn smirked, adjusting the Cartier bracelet Richard's money had also bought. "Relax. This came from my father's guilt fund." The unspoken "100 million" hung between them like tinsel.

Outside the café window, a figure in a black hoodie snapped photos of their table. The telephoto lens glinted—once, twice—before vanishing into the holiday crowds. Neither woman noticed.

Three blocks away, in a parked sedan, Dominic Reeves reviewed the shots. The timestamp proved it: Evelyn Carter was spending dirty money. Exactly what his employer needed to see.

He forwarded the images with a caption: Phase One complete. Proceeding to surveillance point Beta.

The reply came instantly: Remember—she can't know she's being watched.

Claire gasped at her words. "Goodness! The Hayes family actually gave you that much? Then I absolutely can't accept this designer bag. After everything they put you through, I won't touch their dirty money."

Claire wasn't one to profit from her best friend's past suffering.

"Keep it. It's Richard's money anyway," Evelyn said with a careless wave of her hand. "I have zero guilt spending every penny."

Claire stopped protesting, and the two women continued their shopping spree through the upscale boutiques.

As they said their goodbyes in the dimly lit parking garage, Claire suddenly dropped her bombshell. "After the holidays... I might be leaving the country for a while."

Evelyn's eyes immediately dropped to Claire's midsection. "You're nearly four months along now, aren't you?"

Claire nodded silently. She'd already put all modeling contracts on hold as her pregnancy became more visible. Though her slender frame hid the small bump well, even the slightest change showed under professional lighting.

The winter layers provided temporary camouflage, but come spring when coats came off? There'd be no hiding the truth anymore.

The realization hit Evelyn instantly. She understood exactly why Claire needed to disappear overseas.

Claire didn’t want to give birth under Lucas’s watchful gaze, and her parents were settled overseas.

Just as she voiced her thoughts, Julian appeared behind her, clutching a bouquet of roses. Hearing her mention leaving the country, his expression darkened. "Claire, when exactly are you planning to go?"

At Julian’s sudden interruption, Evelyn and Claire spun around.

Julian closed the distance in two strides, seizing Claire’s wrist and pulling her against his chest. "Don’t leave. I’ll be here for you when the baby comes. I’ll take care of everything—both of you."

A short distance away, Lucas sat in his car, the scene unfolding before him like a slow-motion reel. He lit a cigarette, clamping it between his teeth.

From his vantage point, Julian had come to whisk Claire away, and they’d surrendered to their emotions, embracing right there in the dimly lit parking garage.

For the past two months, Julian had been practically living at Claire’s apartment. Their relationship had clearly escalated, and by the looks of it, whatever was inevitable had already happened.

Lucas hadn’t anticipated Claire’s ruthlessness. He’d assumed she was merely keeping Julian around to provoke him. But now, it was clear—she was serious.

Watching Claire melt into Julian’s arms, Lucas didn’t move this time. The past two months had been a whirlwind—impulsive decisions, fleeting calm, reckless outbursts, and obsessive thoughts. Now, his chest was just... hollow.

The moment stretched endlessly as Claire and Julian remained entwined in their passionate embrace.

Lucas hit the accelerator hard, his tires screeching as he tore away from the scene.

His sudden departure revealed another vehicle lurking behind - Ethan's sleek black sedan.

Evelyn decided to give the couple their privacy and turned her car toward home.

But as she entered the narrow alleyway, headlights flashed blindingly in her rearview mirror.

A car swerved aggressively, cutting her off with inches to spare.

Evelyn slammed the brakes, her heart pounding against her ribs.

She rolled down her window, fury coloring her words. "Are you out of your mind? Trying to kill us both?"

One second of distraction would have sent them crashing.

Before she could react further, the driver's door of the other car swung open.

Ethan Caldwell slid into her passenger seat with practiced ease.

His voice was deceptively calm when he spoke. "We need to talk, Evelyn."

The scent of his expensive cologne filled the confined space, making her grip the steering wheel tighter.

Streetlights flickered across his sharp features as he turned to face her fully.

That predatory gleam in his eyes hadn't changed in all these years.

Evelyn's pulse quickened, though she couldn't tell if it was from anger or something more dangerous.

The alley walls seemed to close in around them as the confrontation began.

Somewhere in the distance, a car alarm wailed into the night.

But in that moment, the entire world had narrowed to just the two of them.

And the secrets that hung heavy between them.

###Chapter 310 Twisted Reasoning

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line as Ethan slid into the passenger seat of her car. Her gaze was icy, devoid of warmth. "Ethan, what could we possibly have left to discuss?"

Ethan leaned back, unfazed. "Aren't you searching for Damian? I know exactly where he is." He pulled out his phone, flashing a QR code on the screen. "Add me back, and I'll send you his coordinates."

Evelyn had erased Ethan from her contacts months ago. The audacity of him asking to reconnect almost made her laugh. "If you know where he is, just tell me. Do I really need to add you again?"

His expression remained smug. "The location is complicated—too many turns, too many side streets. Without the exact pin, you'll never find him."

Suspicion coiled in her chest. She didn’t want him back in her life, but she needed to see Damian. Reluctantly, she scanned the code.

The moment the notification popped up on his screen, Ethan tucked his phone away.

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. "What are you doing? Weren’t you going to send me Damian’s location?"

"Relax," Ethan said smoothly. "I said I’d send it, and I will. But first, there’s something else we need to discuss."

The memory hit Ethan Caldwell like a punch to the gut—Alexander Whitmore and Evelyn Carter tangled together in the backseat of this very car. His jaw clenched, fingers tightening around the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white.

"It's suffocating in here. Get out," Ethan snapped, shoving his door open before the scent of leather and her perfume could choke him further.

Evelyn didn’t move.

He circled the car, yanking her door open with more force than necessary. "I said, get out."

Her fingers curled around the seatbelt. Meeting him alone was reckless, especially after what happened at Hawthorne Estate.

Ethan had been drunk that night, slurring pleas for her to come back, his words raw with a truth only liquor could loosen. And Alexander had seen them.

The aftermath had been brutal—Alexander’s possessiveness a living thing, his touch leaving marks that ached for days. Just the thought made her skin prickle with warning.

She stayed seated, tilting her head up. "Ethan, this isn’t appropriate. Your uncle will lose his temper."

Alexander’s name was a match to gasoline. Ethan’s expression darkened. "Are you scared of him? Did he force you? Tell me, and I’ll—"

"And you’ll what?" Evelyn’s gaze sharpened, dissecting him. His words didn’t fit—not the man who’d let her go without a fight.

The silence between them thickened, heavy with things unsaid.

Ethan exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "Just—get out of the car, Evelyn."

She didn’t.

Because the truth was, she wasn’t afraid of Alexander’s jealousy.

She was afraid of this—of Ethan’s sudden intensity, the way his eyes burned like he had something to prove.

And she had no idea what game he was playing.

Ethan pressed his lips together, his jaw tightening. "Even if I can't defeat him, I'd give my life to keep you safe."

Evelyn found his reasoning utterly baffling. She was legally bound to Alexander, yet the way Ethan spoke made it sound like she belonged to him instead.

She had no intention of indulging this conversation further. "Ethan, what exactly are you trying to say? Why are you blocking my path?"

Her refusal to acknowledge Alexander only fueled Ethan's conviction. To him, their public displays of affection were nothing more than an act. A flicker of hope burned brighter in his gaze.

"Evelyn," he said, voice softening with concern, "when you were taken... did they hurt you? I tried to reach you first, but Alexander got there before I could. You have no idea how sick with worry I've been these past few days."

He had followed her, watching for any sign of injury, any hint of distress.

"Worried about me?" Her tone was ice. "Your wife is lying in a hospital bed fighting to keep your child alive. Shouldn't she be your priority?"

###Chapter 311 A Verdict

Ethan's expression darkened at her words.

Evelyn rolled up the window with deliberate slowness. "If there's nothing else, I'm leaving." The mere mention of Vanessa had instantly frozen any warmth in her tone.

Ethan's hand shot out, gripping the car door handle before she could drive away. A thought flickered through his mind—was this coldness actually jealousy? Could she still have feelings for me?

The words tumbled out before he could stop them. "The baby... I'm already working on convincing her to terminate it. Just give me a little more time."

Evelyn hesitated. More time? She hadn't expected him to reject Vanessa's pregnancy so outright. After all Vanessa's scheming, to have Ethan dismiss her so callously—it almost felt like poetic justice.

"Your mess with Vanessa is none of my concern," Evelyn said, her voice icy. "Just send me Damian’s location." Without waiting for a response, she pressed the accelerator and sped off.

Ethan stood frozen as her car vanished around the corner, then collapsed back into his seat. A slow smirk curved his lips. Of course. Women only act this way when they care. Evelyn must still be in love with me. Why else would she agree to reconnect on WhatsApp?

Damian is just an excuse.

Once I deal with Vanessa, everything will go back to how it should be.

Ethan didn’t waste a second. He sped toward the hospital.

Inside the private room, Vanessa was berating a young nurse.

The inexperienced nurse had failed to find the vein on the first try, forcing her to attempt the injection again.

Vanessa, already in a foul mood, snapped. She flung the tray of medical instruments to the ground with a loud clatter.

The nurse flinched, her hands trembling as she stammered an apology.

Just as Vanessa opened her mouth to unleash another tirade, the door swung open. Ethan stood there, his sharp gaze darkening with displeasure.

Vanessa’s expression instantly softened into a sweet smile. “Ethan! You came to see me.”

He didn’t respond immediately, instead turning to the nurse. “You’re dismissed.”

The nurse didn’t hesitate. She bolted from the room as if fleeing for her life.

Vanessa noticed the coldness in Ethan’s eyes and realized he must have seen her outburst. Her fingers curled slightly into the sheets as she quickly defended herself. “Ethan, look at my hand—it’s swollen from the needle. It hurt so much. I was just trying to teach her a lesson so she doesn’t make the same mistake with other patients.”

Ethan didn't care whether her words were true or not. It didn't matter to him anymore. His voice was cold as he said, "I just spoke with Evelyn."

Vanessa froze. "Ethan, what are you implying?"

His expression remained unreadable. "Get rid of the baby. Take the money. Only then will she even consider taking me back."

Vanessa couldn't believe what she was hearing.

"Didn't you always claim to love me?" Ethan's gaze was piercing. "If you truly do, then prove it. Letting go is the greatest act of love. Dragging this out helps no one. If you terminate the pregnancy, you’ll be doing us both a favor."

Silence stretched between them. His words left her reeling. Had Evelyn really said that? The cruelty of it twisted inside her. This is between us. Why involve an innocent child?

It took Vanessa several seconds to find her voice again. "Your mother would never allow this. Ethan, this is your child too! How can you be so cruel?"

"Don’t bring my mother into this." His tone was final. "I’ve already arranged everything with the doctor. The procedure is scheduled for tomorrow morning."

This wasn’t a discussion. It was an order.

Without another word, Ethan turned and walked away, leaving Vanessa standing there, shattered.

Vanessa's entire body shook violently. She knew Ethan too well—when he made a decision, there was no turning back. If he said the surgery would happen tomorrow, then every detail had already been arranged.

Her fingers trembled as she snatched her phone from the nightstand. Without hesitation, she dialed Eleanor’s number, her lifeline in this nightmare.

The call ended abruptly.

Before she could take another breath, the door creaked open. A woman in her late forties slipped inside, her presence as silent as a shadow.

Vanessa’s blood ran cold the moment their eyes met.

Her lips parted, but no sound came out.

The woman smiled—a slow, chilling curve of her lips.

"Hello, Vanessa," she murmured. "Did you really think you could escape?"

Vanessa’s knees buckled.

She knew that voice.

She knew that face.

And she knew—with terrifying certainty—that she was out of time.

Secret Devotion: A Love Beyond Bars (Evelyn Carter) novel

###Chapter 312 Heiress

Vanessa's voice was sharp as she addressed the woman who had just slipped into her room. "What are you doing here? Who told you to come? If anyone sees you—" She cut herself off, gripping the edge of her vanity. "You need to leave. Now."

Evelyn Sinclair frowned, her dark eyes flickering with concern. "Vanessa, I heard what happened. I was worried sick." She stepped closer, lowering her voice. "I came in secret. It's the middle of the night—no one will know."

The woman standing before Vanessa was her birth mother, Evelyn Sinclair. She had lingered outside the door long enough to catch every word exchanged between Vanessa and Ethan.

Now that the immediate danger had passed, Evelyn's anger flared. "Ethan Caldwell—that coward!" Her hands clenched into fists. "How dare he abandon you like this? Telling you to get rid of the baby?" She scoffed. "He’s no better than Eleanor. Disgusting, the both of them."

Vanessa stiffened at the mention of Ethan’s mother. "Wait." Her gaze narrowed. "How do you know Eleanor?"

Something didn’t add up. Evelyn had never met Eleanor before. So how could she possibly know what kind of woman she was?

Evelyn froze, her expression tightening before she forced a dismissive laugh. "Of course I don’t know her. Why would I?"

Vanessa didn’t press further. Right now, she had bigger concerns. If anyone discovered Evelyn here, the consequences would be disastrous. "You can’t stay," she insisted, her voice edged with urgency. "You need to go—now."

Just as the words left her lips, Richard appeared in the doorway. His eyes widened at the sight of Evelyn Sinclair. "What are you doing here? If anyone sees you—"

Evelyn's hands trembled. "I—I was just leaving."

Richard moved swiftly, gripping her wrist. "I know you're worried about Vanessa, but didn’t I assure you? She’s perfectly fine, and the baby is healthy. If someone catches you lurking around, it’ll only complicate things. Come, I’ll escort you home."

Without another word, he guided her out.

Inside the elevator, Evelyn’s anxiety refused to fade. She turned to Richard, voice trembling. "I just overheard Ethan. He’s trying to convince Vanessa to terminate the pregnancy! Do you think their relationship is in trouble?"

Richard shook his head firmly. "The Caldwells would never let Ethan act so recklessly. You must have misunderstood. Why would he reject his own child?"

Tears welled in Evelyn’s eyes. "Richard, I’ve spent decades hidden in your shadow—no title, no recognition. I accepted that. I know I can’t compete with Margaret, but I won’t stand by while our daughter suffers for nothing!"

Richard’s grip on her hand tightened. "You have my word. Vanessa is my daughter too. I would never let harm come to her."

"But Vanessa told me you gifted the Hawthorne Estate to Evelyn just to win her favor. Doesn't that leave Vanessa at a disadvantage?" Evelyn Sinclair's eyes grew even redder, her voice trembling with emotion.

Richard Hayes scoffed, "I compensated Vanessa fairly, didn't I? Thirty million dollars as a Christmas present—that's more than generous!"

Their conversation carried them downstairs. Evelyn knew better than to push Richard too far, so she bit back any further protests.

Richard motioned for her to step into his car, instructing the driver, "Take her to Willowbrook Apartments."

When she noticed Richard wasn’t joining her, Evelyn frowned. "Aren’t you coming with me?"

With Christmas approaching and his son Oliver back home, Richard could no longer use work as an excuse to slip away to Evelyn’s place. But the memory of his latest argument with Margaret hardened his resolve. "Fine," he relented. "I’ll stay with you tonight."

A satisfied smile curved Evelyn’s lips.

Years ago, she had been Richard’s secretary. One drunken night, she had seized the opportunity to seduce him, and since then, their relationship had remained shrouded in secrecy.

But their affair hadn’t lasted. Margaret had grown suspicious, and Richard, ever the coward, had paid Evelyn off before the truth could unravel.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love After Prison (Evelyn)

###Chapter 313 The Secret Keeper

The woman stood trembling at the clinic doors, her threadbare dress hanging loosely over her swollen belly. Her sunken eyes held a desperate plea as she clutched her stomach—a womb that carried death instead of life.

In Cresthaven, the doctors could perform miracles. Or so she had heard.

But in her village, there was no mercy for women like her. A stillborn child meant disgrace. A death sentence at the hands of a furious husband.

That was when Evelyn Sinclair made her choice.

She handed Margaret Hayes’ newborn to the peasant woman, sealing the lie with a whisper.

A decade later, the truth unraveled.

Margaret’s sharp eyes noticed it first—the way Vanessa Hart’s blood type didn’t match. The numbers didn’t lie. The child she had raised wasn’t hers.

Panic set in.

Evelyn, older now but still clinging to the remnants of her beauty, saw the storm coming.

She couldn’t let Richard Hayes cast Vanessa aside. Not when the girl was her own flesh and blood.

So she sought him out.

Confession spilled from her lips like poison, each word laced with calculation.

Richard’s face darkened. "Where is Margaret’s daughter?"

Evelyn hesitated. But then—opportunity.

If she gave him this, perhaps he would give her something in return.

And he did.

The past reignited between them, a dangerous flame she had no intention of extinguishing.

Not when she still had so much to gain.

Evelyn Sinclair took pride in offering emotional comfort. Wealthy men constantly dealt with pressure—demanding clients outside, nagging wives at home. They craved women like her.

Evelyn Carter waited half the night, convinced Alexander had lied to her. Just as she was about to delete his contact, his message popped up with a location pin:

[My team tracked Damian Cross to this area. It's a rough neighborhood. Do you want me to go with you tomorrow?]

She studied the coordinates—a cramped, decaying district on the city’s fringe. The kind of place where shadows hid more than just secrets.

"Who are you texting?"

Alexander stepped into the room, his damp hair tousled, black silk pajamas clinging to his frame. The usual sharp edges of his presence softened slightly.

She didn’t bother hiding it. "Ethan."

His brow arched. He moved closer, sinking onto the couch beside her, his gaze dropping to her phone. Ethan’s WhatsApp stared back at him.

"What did he say? I thought you blocked him." His tone was deceptively calm, but the chill in his voice was unmistakable.

Evelyn remembered the doctor’s warning—Alexander’s temper was—

The wound on Alexander's lower back still needed daily dressing changes. Without hesitation, Evelyn hurried to fetch the first aid kit.

But before she could take a step, Alexander's strong fingers wrapped around her wrist, pulling her effortlessly onto his lap. She found herself straddling his thighs, their bodies pressed dangerously close.

The rich, masculine scent of his cologne enveloped her, sending her pulse into a frantic rhythm. The position was undeniably intimate—too intimate.

A shiver raced down her spine as Alexander leaned in, his lips grazing the sensitive skin of her neck. "Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured, his voice rough with barely restrained desire. "Don’t you think you owe me an explanation?"

Evelyn’s fingers curled instinctively into his hair, her breath hitching. "I’ll delete him right now, Alexander. Just… don’t move—"

"Who’s moving now?" His grip on her waist tightened, his dark eyes flickering down to where their bodies were flush against each other.

It was then that Evelyn realized her mistake. In her desperate attempt to evade his kisses, she had only stoked the fire inside him. Her heart hammered wildly, but it was too late—far too late.

Alexander’s injury had healed remarkably fast, and within days, he was unrestrained, his strength fully returned.

And now, with a feverish hunger, he took her again and again, lost in the heat of their passion.

His rough stubble grazed against her sensitive skin, sending shivers down her spine. The slight burn mixed with pleasure made Evelyn gasp.

Alexander's lips trailed lower, deliberately teasing.

She arched her back instinctively, nails digging into his shoulders. "Stop...it hurts," she breathed, though her body betrayed her words.

He chuckled darkly, the vibration against her collarbone making her tremble. "Liar."

Overwhelmed, Evelyn sank her teeth into his shoulder.

Instead of pulling away, Alexander groaned in approval. "Again," he demanded, pressing closer until no space remained between them.

The command sent heat pooling low in her belly. She bit down harder this time, tasting salt on her tongue.

His responding growl ignited something primal within her. The game had changed - she wasn't sure when she'd lost control, only that she never wanted it back.

Around them, the silk sheets twisted like the lies they told themselves. That this was just physical. That neither craved more.

The grandfather clock in the hallway chimed midnight.

Somewhere in Whitmore Manor, a phone began to ring.

###Chapter 314 The Unexpected Encounter

The following morning, Evelyn's phone buzzed with an incoming call. After a brief conversation, she grabbed her purse and stepped outside. A sleek Lamborghini purred to a stop in front of her.

Oliver leaned over and tapped the passenger seat. "Get in. I'll take you."

The car was undeniably luxurious, and Evelyn couldn't help but run her fingers along the smooth exterior. "This is new."

Oliver smirked. "Alexander gave it to me. Didn’t he tell you?"

Evelyn blinked, momentarily speechless.

Oliver’s expression turned serious. "The hospital’s in an uproar. Did you hear? Ethan refuses to keep the baby and is forcing Vanessa to terminate the pregnancy. She was taken into surgery this morning. Mom and Dad rushed over as soon as they got the news."

Evelyn had assumed Ethan’s threats were just empty words, but he had actually gone through with it. It seemed his determination to divorce Vanessa was unshakable.

"Eleanor hid Vanessa away," Oliver added, shaking his head. "Even if the baby is born, it’ll never be accepted by its father. Just another pawn in Vanessa’s desperate game. What’s the point?"

This was exactly what Evelyn had predicted. After fighting so hard to marry Ethan, Vanessa wouldn’t surrender easily. The baby was her last hope to reclaim control.

Oliver stepped closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Mom begged me to relay this. She's desperate for you to unblock her number. She genuinely wants to make things right."

Evelyn arched a brow, crossing her arms. "That transfer from Richard yesterday—that was you pretending to be him, wasn't it?"

Oliver stiffened. He had been so careful. "How did you know?"

"Because Richard would never phrase anything like that," Evelyn said, her lips curling into a knowing smirk.

Oliver exhaled sharply. "It was his money, though. Dad's secret funds are practically drained at this point."

Evelyn shook her head. It wasn’t about the money. It never had been. What she wanted was real remorse from the Hayes family—something they still hadn’t shown.

The car slowed to a stop outside a gated estate.

Oliver turned to her. "I sent someone ahead at dawn. Damian was told there’s a lucrative deal waiting for him here. He should be arriving any second."

Evelyn stepped out, smoothing her jacket. "Good."

The estate had once been Oliver’s private rehearsal space during his band days. The Hayes family owned countless properties, but this one had always been his favorite—secluded, elegant, and perfect for what they needed today.

The air was thick with tension as Evelyn strode toward the entrance, her heels clicking against the stone path.

Oliver followed, his voice low. "You sure about this?"

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "Absolutely."

A black sedan pulled into the driveway just then, its engine purring to a stop.

Right on time.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone.

Damian Cross was here.

The safe house was one of Alexander's lesser-known properties, vacant since Oliver had moved overseas. It had been freshly cleaned at Oliver's request, leaving it in pristine condition.

They'd just stepped inside when the growl of an engine cut off outside. Evelyn and Oliver exchanged knowing glances. With a quick gesture, she signaled for him to hide.

As Oliver slipped out of sight, the door creaked open. A man in his early thirties sauntered in, clad in a loud floral shirt that clashed with his rough demeanor.

Damian froze mid-step at the sight of Evelyn. His brows shot up in surprise.

Evelyn smirked, tilting her head. "Damian, that look on your face—didn’t think you’d see me here?"

Damian was her foster brother, a decade older, with a history of bad choices. Gambling debts in his youth had led him straight into gang life, where he’d stayed ever since.

He stepped inside, schooling his expression into something neutral. "Evelyn. What do you want?"

She settled onto the sofa, crossing her legs. "You must’ve heard I married Alexander Whitmore. Funny thing—I also heard you’ve been telling people you slept with me." She leaned forward, eyes glinting. "Alexander isn’t happy about that. He’d like a word."

Damian had just lifted a glass of water to his lips when her words hit him. His hand jerked, water sloshing over his shirt.

Damian knew exactly who Alexander was. His denial came swift and sharp. "When did I ever sleep with you? Evelyn, you're fabricating lies!"

"If we never slept together, then why spread such vile rumors?" Evelyn slammed her phone face down on the table, her gaze turning icy. "Damian, who paid you to tarnish my name?"

His eyes flickered nervously before landing on her phone. A smirk twisted his lips as realization dawned. "Evelyn... you're recording this, aren't you?"

In one swift motion, he snatched the phone from the table, triumph flashing in his eyes. He looked like a man who had anticipated this very moment.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Evelyn didn’t flinch. Instead, she leaned forward, her voice low and dangerous. "You think that’s all I have?"

Damian’s smirk faltered.

She reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a second phone—this one still recording. His face paled.

"Game over," she whispered.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance After the Storm (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 315 Innocence

The phone shattered against the hardwood floor with a deafening crack.

Damian wasn't satisfied.

He brought his boot down on the broken device again and again, grinding the pieces beneath his heel until nothing remained but twisted metal and splintered glass.

A dark chuckle escaped him as he turned his predatory gaze toward Evelyn.

"Evelyn," he drawled, voice dripping with mock sweetness. "Meeting your own brother and still acting like I'm some kind of threat? That's cold."

Evelyn's expression hardened into ice.

"Damian," she said, voice low and dangerous. "Last chance. Who paid you? What was the deal?" Her fingers curled into fists at her sides. "Don't make me do something we'll both regret."

Damian only smirked, unfazed.

"You think I'm scared of you?" He took a step closer, eyes glinting with malice. "Evelyn, you—"

The glass in Evelyn's hand smashed against his temple before he could finish.

Shards rained down as Damian staggered back, a dark fury twisting his features.

He lunged.

His fingers tangled in her hair, yanking hard as he snarled, "You think you can hit me and walk away? Who the hell do you think you are?"

Evelyn struggled, but Damian was stronger.

With a brutal shove, he slammed her down onto the sofa, his hand closing around her throat.

His grin was vicious.

"Now," he whispered. "Let's talk."

The shattered phone lay useless on the ground, its recording function destroyed.

Damian Cross smirked, his voice dripping with arrogance. "Vanessa called me last week. She wanted me to kidnap you—do unspeakable things to you—and film it all. Her plan? To humiliate you in front of your husband, make him leave you in disgust."

He leaned closer, his breath hot against Evelyn Carter's ear. "But we're family, aren't we? I couldn't bring myself to do it. So, dear sister… how will you repay my kindness?"

Evelyn gasped for air, her vision blurring as she fought against the suffocating grip around her throat.

Damian, too confident now, didn’t notice the flicker of defiance in her eyes.

She bit down hard on her lip.

The broken phone had been a decoy—a carefully placed trap to lure him into confessing.

Hidden in the shadows, Oliver Hayes adjusted the camera, capturing every damning word.

"You're scared, aren't you?" Evelyn choked out. "Scared of what Alexander will do when he finds out."

Damian scoffed. "What did Vanessa offer me? Money. Herself." His grin turned predatory. "Let me tell you, a spoiled heiress like her? Worth every second. That smooth skin, those delicate legs—"

Evelyn's stomach twisted. "You're lying."

Damian laughed. "Why would I lie?"

The air grew heavier.

Oliver's grip on the camera tightened.

The trap had been set.

And Damian had walked right into it.

The thought made Evelyn scoff. "With Vanessa's prideful nature, how could she ever stoop to being with someone like Damian? Besides, he's not her type at all. Vanessa has only ever had eyes for Ethan."

"I might be reckless, but I don’t lie!" Damian's pride bristled at Evelyn's skepticism. "I even have proof—a video! It's right here on my phone!"

Evelyn had only wanted to extract evidence from Damian to clear her name from three years ago. But now, he had dropped a bombshell.

He claimed to have footage, and Evelyn played along with disbelief. "Don’t try to fool me. You’ve always been full of empty boasts. Vanessa sleeping with you? That’s the most ridiculous lie yet."

Damian smirked and reached for his phone. As Evelyn shifted to rise from the couch, he swiftly pinned her back down.

"Listen, Evelyn," Damian said, his voice low and urgent. "I’m in deep trouble—debts piling up. But you? You’re the wealthy Mrs. Whitmore now. Help me out, and I’ll send you the video immediately. Just 20 million. Once you have it, blur my face and leak it. That’ll be enough to destroy Vanessa and give you the revenge you’ve been waiting for."

No one knew better than Damian just how innocent Evelyn had truly been back then.

Secret Longing: Finding Love After Betrayal (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 316 Crisis

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the abandoned warehouse as Evelyn Carter faced Damian Cross. She knew exactly why he had summoned her here.

Damian smirked, his fingers drumming against the rusted metal table between them. "Three years," he mused. "Three years you spent behind bars because of that night. Bet you never thought you'd see me again, huh?"

Evelyn's jaw tightened. She had always known Damian was a gambler, a man who thrived on risk. But this? This was a new low, even for him.

Three years ago, he had sold her out for a quick payout. Now, he was trying to play both sides—betraying Vanessa Hart just as easily as he had betrayed her.

"How about it?" Damian leaned forward, his breath reeking of cheap whiskey. "Twenty million. Transfer the money, and the video's yours. Simple."

Evelyn didn’t flinch. The offer sounded reasonable on the surface, but she wasn’t fooled.

She hadn’t forgotten that Vanessa’s scheme had only worked because of Damian’s involvement. They were partners in crime, and both deserved to pay.

This video he dangled in front of her? Just another trick. He wanted her to make a deal, to let him walk away scot-free while Vanessa took the fall.

Evelyn wasn’t about to let that happen.

If she agreed, she’d be letting Damian off the hook—and that was something she could never do.

Evelyn hadn't anticipated Damian's ability to think so quickly despite his lack of education. Her voice turned icy as she spat, "You won't get a single cent from me!"

Seeing her outright rejection, Damian's expression darkened instantly. "Evelyn, you're really choosing the difficult path, aren't you? If you refuse to pay, I'll have no choice but to strike a deal with Vanessa instead."

In a sudden, threatening motion, he began unbuttoning his gaudy floral shirt. Evelyn's face drained of color. "What the hell are you doing?"

Damian smirked, his gaze predatory. "It's been years since I last saw you, and you've only grown more stunning. I can't help but be drawn to you. Why don't we... enjoy this moment together?"

With a sharp tug, he ripped off his shirt, his eyes glinting with dark intent. "Vanessa promised me a fortune if I film something... intimate between us. Ruin your reputation, and I walk away rich."

He took a step closer, his voice dripping with false sympathy. "I watched you grow up. Out of some twisted sense of family loyalty, I wanted to give you a chance to keep your dignity. But since you're being stubborn, Vanessa gets what she wants. Don't blame me. Once I have the cash, I'll disappear. Alexander will never find me."

Before Evelyn could react, Damian lunged forward, his lips crashing against hers with bruising force.

Evelyn had been born when Damian was already ten. All these years, he'd treated her like a little sister—until now. The realization of his betrayal made her stomach churn.

Her mind raced. She had to escape. But how?

Damian's grip tightened, his breath hot against her skin. "Stop fighting it, Evelyn. You know you want this too."

Her pulse pounded in her ears. No. She wouldn't let this happen.

With a surge of adrenaline, she twisted violently, her knee jerking upward—

A strangled cry tore from Damian's throat as he doubled over in pain.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. She bolted for the door.

But Damian recovered faster than she expected. His hand snagged her wrist, yanking her back with brutal force.

"You little—"

The door burst open.

A shadow filled the doorway.

Evelyn's heart leapt.

Alexander stood there, his expression murderous.

Damian froze.

Then Alexander moved.

A single punch sent Damian sprawling to the ground, unconscious before he even hit the floor.

Alexander's gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Are you hurt?"

She shook her head, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

His jaw clenched. "This ends now."

But as he turned to leave, Evelyn grabbed his arm. "Wait."

Alexander paused.

Evelyn's voice was steady despite the tremor in her hands. "We do this together."

A slow, dangerous smile curved Alexander's lips.

Damian had made one fatal mistake.

He'd underestimated Evelyn Carter.

And now, he'd pay the price.

A flicker of danger sparked in his thoughts.

A decade had slipped by since their last encounter, and the Evelyn Carter before him now bore no resemblance to the timid, wide-eyed girl she'd once been.

Especially in recent years, a newfound elegance had woven itself into her every movement—a poise that hadn’t existed before.

The moment Damian Cross laid eyes on her today, something inside him twisted, an unsettling hunger stirring to life. Now, at last, he had the perfect excuse.

Damian stared at Evelyn like a predator sizing up its prey. His gaze was sharp, unrelenting, and utterly shameless.

Evelyn’s face drained of color as she instinctively fought back, driving her knee upward toward his groin. But Damian was prepared.

He caught her wrists effortlessly, pinning them above her head with one hand while the other clamped around her waist. "Relax, darling," he murmured, his voice dripping with dark amusement. "You’ll enjoy this a lot more if you stop struggling."

Damian was a man built for violence—a thug through and through. Brawling was second nature to him, and within moments, Evelyn found herself overpowered.

Desperation clawed at her throat as she twisted toward the door, her voice cracking. "Oliver! What are you doing? Help me—now!"

Only seconds earlier, Oliver had been lurking in the shadows, watching.

The security footage should have been rolling.

Every angle. Every movement. Every damning piece of evidence.

But now—when everything hinged on that proof—the cameras had gone dark.

Evelyn's fingers clenched around the edge of the desk, her knuckles whitening.

Alexander had assured her the system was flawless.

"Nothing gets past these cameras," he had said, that confident smirk playing on his lips.

Yet here she stood, staring at a blank screen where there should have been irrefutable evidence of Vanessa's treachery.

Her pulse hammered in her throat.

Without that footage, it was her word against Vanessa's.

And Vanessa had always been the more convincing liar.

A cold dread slithered down Evelyn's spine.

Where was Nathan?

He was supposed to be monitoring the feeds. Recording everything.

But now, when it mattered most, he had vanished.

The door creaked open behind her.

Evelyn didn't need to turn to know who it was.

Vanessa's perfume—heavy, cloying—filled the room before she even spoke.

"Looking for something, sister?"

The mocking lilt in her voice made Evelyn's stomach twist.

She turned slowly, meeting Vanessa's smug gaze.

"Where is it?" Evelyn demanded.

Vanessa's lips curled into a slow, knowing smile.

"Oh, Evelyn... You always did overestimate your little allies."

The screen flickered once—then went completely black.

Evelyn's breath caught.

Vanessa stepped closer, her heels clicking against the floor like a countdown.

"Did you really think Alexander's people would choose you over me?"

A chill settled over Evelyn.

Because the truth was—she wasn't sure anymore.

And that uncertainty was more dangerous than any lie Vanessa could spin.

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After Prison (Evelyn Carter) novel

###Chapter 317 Helpless

Evelyn cursed Alexander’s unreliability under her breath when sudden muffled sounds caught her attention. "Mmm... Mmm..."

Her blood ran cold.

There, just a few feet away, Oliver had been subdued by a hulking brute, a filthy rag stuffed in his mouth. His wrists and ankles were bound, his camera smashed beyond repair. His predicament mirrored hers—no, it was worse.

When Oliver heard Evelyn’s voice, he thrashed violently, spitting out the gag. "Evelyn! The footage—he deleted everything!"

Her stomach dropped.

A towering figure stepped out of the shadows, his presence suffocating. Evelyn whipped her head toward Damian, voice trembling. "Is he yours?"

Damian smirked, slow and satisfied. "Of course. Evelyn, did you really think I’d walk into this blind?" His laugh was cruel. "I’ve been here longer than you. My man scaled the walls before you even stepped inside. Everything you saw? A performance. And you fell for it."

His fingers dug into her waist, tearing her jacket open with a vicious yank.

"Stop it, you monster! Get your filthy hands off Evelyn! Let her go right now!" Oliver screamed, his voice raw with fury as he struggled against his restraints.

Marcus Riley delivered a brutal kick to the back of Oliver's knees, forcing him to the ground with a painful thud. Before Oliver could recover, Marcus drove his fist into his face, sending blood splattering across the floor.

"Know your place, boy," Marcus sneered, wiping his knuckles.

Evelyn's breath hitched at the sight of her brother bleeding. Her mind reeled in panic. "Please, stop this! This is between us—leave Oliver out of it! I'll give you whatever you want, just let him go!"

Damian Cross chuckled darkly, his fingers tracing the edge of Evelyn's collar. "Too late for negotiations, sweetheart. You've already lit the fire—now I intend to watch it burn." He jerked his chin toward Marcus. "Take the kid next door. He's ruining the mood."

Marcus hauled Oliver up, dragging him toward the door despite his violent resistance.

"You touch her, and I swear I'll tear you apart!" Oliver snarled, his voice hoarse. "Damian, you sick bastard—I'll make you pay for this!" But his threats faded as Marcus shoved him out of sight.

Damian wasted no time. His belt hit the floor with a metallic clink, and he closed the distance between them in two predatory strides.

A cold dread slithered down Evelyn's spine as his fingers brushed her skin.

The rough hands of Damian Cross crept toward Evelyn Carter's neckline, his fingers greedy and invasive.

Fear washed over Evelyn like ice water, draining the warmth from her face. Her body trembled, every muscle tensing in instinctive resistance.

Her heart plummeted.

She had hoped—prayed—that her brother, Oliver Hayes, might intervene, but he stood frozen, powerless against the brute force before them.

Then—

CRASH!

The floor-to-ceiling window exploded inward, shards of glass scattering like deadly rain.

Damian jerked back, his face twisting in fury. "Who the hell dares—?"

Before he could finish, a fist collided with his temple—hard.

Pain exploded behind his eye, white-hot and blinding.

He barely had time to react before an iron grip seized his throat and slammed his head into the table.

Wood splintered.

Blood splattered.

And the last thing Damian saw was the cold, merciless gaze of the man who had just shattered his world.

###Chapter 318 No Regrets

The glass table trembled under the force. With each brutal impact, crimson blood trickled from Damian's split lip. A jagged crack now marred the table's smooth surface.

Everything happened too fast. The world spun violently as Damian slumped against the broken furniture, his vision swimming. The relentless blows left him dazed, barely conscious.

Ethan had shadowed Evelyn silently, lingering just outside the door. Every damning word between Evelyn and Damian had reached his ears with crystal clarity.

He'd heard the shocking confession - that Evelyn had never been intimate with Damian. That Vanessa had paid him off. Most explosive of all, Damian's vile boast about taking Vanessa's virginity three years prior.

Oddly, the revelation didn't wound Ethan. Instead, an unexpected weight lifted from his shoulders, leaving him strangely light.

Memories surfaced unbidden - that drunken night when he'd awakened beside Vanessa. Her tearful claims of purity. All lies. Her first time had been stolen by this thug years before.

Yet for Ethan, it had been genuine. The realization curdled in his stomach now, leaving only revulsion. Just the thought of Vanessa made his skin crawl.

The glass table's fractured edge caught the light, mirroring the cracks in every lie he'd believed.

The living room window was too narrow for Ethan Caldwell to squeeze through. He had been listening outside, every word fueling his rage.

Inside, the scene was chaotic. Without hesitation, Ethan shattered the floor-to-ceiling window with a powerful kick.

His vision blurred when he saw Evelyn Carter pinned beneath Damian Cross. A surge of possessiveness overtook him, turning his eyes crimson with fury.

Ethan lost control. He seized Damian, his fists raining down like a storm, each blow releasing months of pent-up frustration.

Blood splattered as Damian’s face became unrecognizable. Ethan showed no signs of stopping, his rage unrelenting.

Evelyn finally snapped out of her daze. Her breath hitched when she recognized Ethan. When did he get here?

From the neighboring room, Marcus Riley rushed in at the sound of shattering glass. His face paled at the brutal sight before him.

Without a word, Marcus lunged forward to pull Damian free.

"Ethan, behind you!" Evelyn screamed as she caught the glint of a blade in Marcus’s hand.

Marcus’s expression was twisted with malice. Desperate men strike without mercy—one stab could change everything.

Vanessa's sharp warning snapped Ethan back to reality. Without wasting a second, he yanked Damian forward, using him as a human shield.

Marcus, unable to pull back his strike in time, never anticipated Ethan's lightning-fast reflexes. The blade plunged straight into Damian's stomach.

"Guh—" Damian choked, blood bubbling past his lips. His body swayed before crumpling to the ground like a marionette with severed strings.

"Damian!" Marcus roared.

Blood gushed from Damian's head wound while the stab in his abdomen sealed his fate. He was already halfway to death's door.

Panic seized Marcus. He dropped the knife, rushing to Damian's side. "I didn't mean to!" he babbled, hands trembling as he checked the damage.

Ethan didn't hesitate. He drove his foot into Marcus's chest, the impact striking his heart with brutal precision. Marcus toppled backward, gasping.

The living room was in shambles. Nearby, Oliver finally managed to roll into view, his limbs still bound. He thudded to a stop at Evelyn's feet. "Evelyn! Are you hurt?"

His eyes burned with fear as he scanned her frantically. Seeing only minor dishevelment and her clothes undisturbed, he exhaled in shaky relief.

Evelyn immediately crouched to untie him. "I'm fine. What about you? Are you injured?"

Her fingers worked swiftly, urgency lacing every movement. The air still reeked of iron and sweat, but for now, they were alive. That was enough.

Oliver winced slightly, rubbing his knee. "It's just a little sore, nothing major."

His gaze dropped to the shattered camera at his feet, and his frown deepened. "Now what? All our proof is gone. I risked everything filming this—for nothing!"

The memory flashed in his mind—how he'd been crouched in the next room, lens trained on the confrontation, when strong hands had clamped over his mouth from behind.

Helpless, he'd watched as Marcus Riley crushed the memory card beneath his boot. "Everything we worked for today—wasted!"

Evelyn shook her head. Safety came first. And their efforts hadn't been fruitless.

She now held the truth about that night.

And Oliver had seen Vanessa Hart's cruelty firsthand.

The game had changed.

###Chapter 319 Dreaming

Ethan Caldwell wiped the blood from his hands with a crisp white napkin, his gaze immediately seeking Evelyn Carter. His chest tightened when he saw how pale she looked. "Evelyn, are you hurt?"

She stepped back before his fingers could brush her arm, her silence louder than any rejection.

A shadow crossed Ethan's face. He'd gotten here before Alexander Whitmore this time—he'd been the one to save her. Yet Evelyn still flinched from his touch, still kept that careful distance between them. The sting of it was sharper than any wound.

Nearby, Oliver Hayes had already sprung into action. He yanked the ropes that had bound him moments ago and lashed Damian Cross and Marcus Riley together with vicious efficiency. His boot connected with their ribs in brutal kicks.

"You filthy rats!" Oliver snarled, waving the knife dangerously close to their faces. "Lay a finger on my sister again and I'll carve you up myself! Do you have any idea who she is? You're not fit to breathe the same air as her!"

Sirens wailed in the distance. The police arrived within minutes, hauling the two men away.

Ethan had called them while circling the building earlier—a calculated move.

Evelyn turned to leave without another word.

"Evelyn," Ethan called suddenly, his voice cutting through the tension. "Weren't you here for proof?"

The question hung in the air like a blade.

Evelyn turned at his words.

Ethan Caldwell's voice was low but clear. "I heard everything Damian Cross just said. You were set up. I've been outside since you started talking."

Now she understood. Ethan had followed her here. A bitter smile touched her lips. The mighty heir of Horizon Enterprises, reduced to trailing after her like some lovesick puppy.

Evelyn met his gaze head-on. "So what? You want to testify for me? Vanessa is your wife. Are you really prepared to do that?"

Exposing this meant dredging up the past—ripping open old wounds from three years ago. But Vanessa was Ethan's wife. The scandal would drag him down with her. His reputation, his standing, the whispers in high society—all of it would turn against him. There was nothing in this for him.

Ethan's expression softened, his eyes pleading. "Evelyn, I want you back. That's all I've ever wanted. Just... look at me."

The words hit like a thunderclap.

Oliver Hayes nearly choked on air. He remembered, vividly, how Evelyn used to chase after Ethan—how she'd been brilliant in every way except when it came to that infatuation.

When Oliver had returned to Cresthaven, he'd heard the impossible: Evelyn had married someone else. And not Ethan. The shock had been like watching the sky split open.

Given Evelyn's obsession with Ethan, Oliver couldn't fathom she would actually marry another man. It wasn't until he witnessed Evelyn standing beside Alexander at their engagement party that reality finally struck him.

Evelyn never mentioned Ethan's name again. Oliver assumed she had closed that chapter of her life for good.

Alexander was extraordinary. During their first meeting, he presented Oliver with a rare Bugatti Chiron—one of only five in existence. It was impossible to find fault with a man who gifted you a million-dollar hypercar.

For weeks, Oliver had been cruising around Cresthaven in his new prized possession, reveling in the envious stares and whispered admiration. Doors opened everywhere he went—people treated him like aristocracy, knowing his sister was engaged to Alexander Whitmore of Horizon Enterprises.

The extravagant gesture convinced Oliver of Alexander's genuine love for Evelyn. He was thrilled for his sister's newfound happiness.

Which made Ethan's sudden reappearance all the more shocking.

Oliver stared in disbelief as Ethan—the once proud heir of the Caldwell dynasty—now knelt before Evelyn, begging for her return. The world had truly gone mad.

How had the tables turned so dramatically during Oliver's years studying abroad? He remembered Ethan's cold arrogance, the way he'd sneered at Evelyn during their breakup.

Yet here he was—the mighty Ethan Caldwell—reduced to pleading? Oliver felt...

The satisfaction was undeniable.

Yet beneath that fleeting triumph, Alexander couldn't shake the unease coiling in his chest. What if Evelyn, in a moment of weakness, let old emotions resurface? What if she foolishly agreed to Ethan's absurd proposal?

Before Evelyn could even open her mouth, Oliver moved. He planted himself firmly between them, his voice sharp as a blade.

"Ethan, wake the hell up!" Oliver's glare could have melted steel. "You lost any right to Evelyn the second you betrayed her. You think you can just waltz back in and demand another chance?"

The air crackled with tension.

Ethan's jaw tightened, but Oliver didn't give him an inch.

"Dreams don't come true for men like you," Oliver spat. "Not after what you did."

Evelyn remained silent, but her fingers curled into fists at her sides.

Alexander watched, his pulse steady but his mind racing.

This wasn't over.

Not by a long shot.

###Chapter 320 Silent

Nathan's mocking laughter filled the air. "You're the one who betrayed her first, Ethan. You married Vanessa, so you're the one who's tainted! How dare you make such ridiculous demands? Does Alexander know you're trying to steal his wife? Alexander is your uncle. You’ve got some nerve, going after his wife!"

Nathan's words seemed to bounce off Ethan. His gaze remained locked on Evelyn, unshaken. He couldn’t believe that after seven years together, she could just walk away. How could two people who had grown up side by side forget everything they once shared?

If Evelyn truly didn’t care, why had she warned him when that knife came flying toward him? Ethan was certain—she still felt something for him.

"Ethan," Evelyn said firmly, "I’m not going back to you. If you refuse to testify, I’ll find another way." She turned to Nathan. "Let’s go home."

Ethan lunged forward, seizing her wrist. "Evelyn, how long are you going to stay angry? I’ve already humbled myself. Isn’t that enough? Fine, if you need to hit me, go ahead." He tried to force her hand against his face.

Evelyn instinctively recoiled, but before she could pull away, a cold voice cut through the tension.

"Ethan," Alexander said from the doorway, his voice like ice, "take your hand off her."

He strode in, his expression unreadable, his eyes locked onto Ethan with a chilling intensity that made the air itself feel heavier.

Alexander reached them in three long strides, immediately wrapping Evelyn in a protective embrace. His voice was a blade of ice. "You dare lay hands on my wife? Ethan, are you tired of living?" The fury in his eyes could have scorched the earth.

Ethan hadn't anticipated Alexander's sudden appearance. Shock flickered across his face before his expression darkened. "Uncle Alex, I—"

The words died in his throat as Alexander's fist connected with his jaw.

Blood bloomed at the corner of Ethan's mouth. He rolled his tongue against his split lip, spitting crimson onto the pavement.

Oliver, watching from the sidelines, whistled low. "Damn, that was a knockout punch! Textbook perfect!"

Whether provoked by the taunt or his own wounded pride, Ethan retaliated with a wild swing.

Alexander reacted instantly—twisting his body to shield Evelyn while his free hand shot out with lethal precision.

Ethan was no amateur, but he was hopelessly outmatched against a man who had spent years training in combat. Alexander caught Ethan's wrist mid-air, twisted it behind his back with brutal efficiency, and slammed him face-first into the ground.

Oliver clapped, grinning. "This is better than an action flick! Alex, you’ve got to teach me that move. I’d be unstoppable!"

Ethan groaned against the pavement, his breath ragged.

Alexander didn’t loosen his grip. His voice was dangerously quiet. "If you ever come near Evelyn again, I won’t stop at a warning."

The threat hung in the air, sharp as a blade.

Evelyn's glare burned into Oliver, her thoughts sharp as knives. He's deliberately stirring the pot.

Under her withering gaze, Oliver shrank back, licking his lips nervously before falling silent like a scolded child.

Ethan Caldwell's eyes were bloodshot. In his earlier fury, he had slammed Damian Cross against the table, only to injure himself in the process.

Now, with Alexander Whitmore twisting his already wounded wrist, it felt like his bones were being crushed to dust.

Alexander's expression was ice-cold. "Admit you were wrong."

Ethan clenched his jaw, refusing to speak.

Alexander tightened his grip, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Lost your voice? Answer me."

###Chapter 321 Affection

The agony tore through Ethan, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. His teeth ground together, but not a single sound escaped his lips.

Alexander's patience had worn thin. He knew Ethan was stubborn, defiant to the core. "I've been too soft with you," he murmured, voice like ice.

A sharp crack echoed as Ethan's finger was wrenched out of joint. White-hot pain seared through him, his body jerking violently. Sweat dripped from his jaw, his breaths ragged, each exhale a blade dragging across his lungs. Yet, even as the torment pulsed through him, Ethan remained silent.

His jaw clenched so tightly that blood welled between his teeth, but his eyes blazed with defiance. After a long, shuddering moment, he finally forced the words past his lips, voice raw. "Alexander... you're nothing but a vulture."

Evelyn's breath caught. No one dared speak to Alexander like that. She glanced at him, watching as his expression darkened further.

"You only swooped in when Evelyn and I were at our weakest," Ethan spat. "If Vanessa hadn't poisoned my mind, you wouldn't even be standing here. You married her in a hurry because you're afraid."

His voice dripped with venom. "Terrified that our history—our bond—is something you could never erase. So you took advantage when she was broken, manipulated her when she needed someone the most. You're a coward, Alexander. A snake in the shadows."

Ethan Caldwell stumbled, his body swaying as waves of pain threatened to consume him. His jaw clenched, his expression twisted in silent suffering, but he refused to crumble before Alexander Whitmore. His icy glare burned with pure, unfiltered hatred.

For the first time in his life, Ethan openly defied Alexander. The entire Caldwell family trembled before Alexander’s merciless nature, and Ethan had always tread carefully around him. But now, years of suppressed fury erupted like a volcano. He couldn’t hold back anymore.

He knew the consequences. He might end up like his father, Vincent Black—exiled, disgraced, erased from the family legacy. But fear didn’t paralyze him.

The air in the room grew heavy, charged with tension.

Alexander merely smirked, his lips curling in amusement as he watched Ethan’s outburst. Mockery danced in his piercing gaze.

"Yes, I took advantage of the situation," Alexander taunted, his voice dripping with arrogance. "But what can you do about it? You were the one who threw away what you had. And now you dare blame Evelyn? Have you no shame, Ethan? Can you honestly say you did nothing wrong?"

His grip tightened around Evelyn Carter’s waist, pulling her closer. Then, with deliberate slowness, he leaned down and pressed a kiss to her forehead.

Beneath his tousled dark hair, his eyes gleamed—bright, intense, alive.

"The woman you discarded like trash is the love of my life," Alexander murmured, his voice low but carrying the weight of absolute conviction. "I’ve loved Evelyn for years. We were meant to be. So if you can’t handle that… too bad."

His fingers traced Evelyn’s jaw, possessive yet tender.

And in that moment, his eyes held galaxies.

The warmth lingered on Evelyn's forehead as she lifted her gaze, meeting Alexander's tender yet intense expression. It was a startling contrast to the icy detachment he'd shown Ethan moments before.

For a heartbeat, Evelyn couldn't look away. His presence was magnetic, pulling her in like a spell she had no desire to break.

Oliver, standing nearby, nearly choked on the thick air of affection. Seriously? Must they do this in front of me? He rolled his eyes, fighting the irrational sting of envy. If he felt this way, he could only imagine the storm raging inside Ethan.

And then there was that kiss. Alexander hadn’t just claimed Evelyn—he’d done it with deliberate, undeniable triumph, right in front of the man who’d once thought he owned her.

Ethan’s face paled, his hands trembling at his sides. Every instinct screamed at him to tear them apart, but the searing pain in his broken finger kept him rooted in place.

Alexander’s words had struck deeper than any physical wound. Each syllable was a blade, slicing through Ethan’s pride, leaving him raw and exposed. There was no defense, no clever retort—just the crushing weight of truth.

Then came the shattering.

The floor-to-ceiling window exploded inward, shards of glass scattering like diamonds across the floor. The winter wind howled through the gaping hole, its frigid fingers clawing at Ethan’s skin, sinking into his bones.

An invisible vise tightened around his throat. The air turned thick, suffocating. He couldn’t breathe.

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After Prison (Evelyn Carter) – 1/3

###Chapter 322 The Final Choice

Ethan Caldwell's vision blurred with unshed tears as he watched them standing together, the picture of marital bliss. A crushing wave of humiliation washed over him - something he'd never experienced before.

With the Hawthorne Estate requiring post-event cleanup, Oliver Hayes remained behind.

Evelyn Carter gave Alexander Whitmore's hand a tender squeeze. "Darling, it's late. We should head home."

Alexander simply nodded, and they walked away without so much as a backward glance at Ethan.

He stood frozen, watching their retreating figures until they vanished from view. Every fiber of his being screamed to follow, but his legs might as well have been cast in concrete. The mere thought of moving forward filled him with paralyzing dread.

His chest constricted as if someone had reached in and shattered his heart into irreparable fragments. The pain was so visceral it left him shaking. "They're a family now," he thought bitterly. "Bound together as husband and wife. And what am I? Just a discarded ex, a pathetic fool. Even after saving Evelyn from Damian Cross, I couldn't earn so much as a glance from her."

The realization was unbearable. Unthinkable. "Could the woman who once adored me truly be done with us? We shared something real, didn't we?"

As Alexander opened the car door for Evelyn, something inside Ethan snapped. His vision tunneled, focusing only on the vehicle about to carry his lost love away forever. With a strangled cry, he lunged forward, throwing himself directly in the path of the moving car.

Ethan moved to the passenger side, gritting his teeth against the burning pain in his finger as he tried to open the door. But it remained locked from the inside.

"Do you really feel nothing for me anymore? Evelyn, tell me—what do I have to do to make you see me again?" His voice cracked, raw with emotion, before he could finish. A sob caught in his throat.

Ethan had never lowered himself like this for anyone. Evelyn was the first. Deep down, he knew if he didn’t act now, they might truly be over.

Seven years of love, of growing up side by side—could that really mean less than what Alexander had built in mere months? Ethan refused to accept it. He needed to hear Evelyn say she didn’t love him anymore before he could walk away.

"Evelyn, if I make Vanessa disappear, will you come back to me? Please?" His voice shattered on the last word, desperation bleeding through. A single tear traced down his cheek.

Who would have imagined Ethan Caldwell, of all people, reduced to this—clinging to someone with such raw, unyielding need?

Inside the car, Evelyn met his gaze, her eyes distant, unreadable. His were pleading, hers cold. The car door between them might as well have been a steel wall.

Ethan ignored Alexander’s murderous glare from the driver’s seat and pressed on. "Evelyn, I’ll give up everything—the Caldwell name, the fortune, all of it. Just nod, and I’ll take you far away from here."

Alexander's fingers closed around Evelyn's wrist with sudden urgency.

When she turned to face him, Evelyn was startled to see genuine worry flashing in his usually composed eyes. A thought struck her - "Is he actually concerned I might choose Ethan?"

Her lips curved in silent amusement at the idea of the formidable Alexander Whitmore feeling insecure.

Outside the car window, Ethan Caldwell shifted his weight nervously, his expectant gaze burning into her.

Inside the vehicle, Evelyn deliberately tightened her grip on Alexander's hand, their palms pressing together in silent understanding.

"Well?" She tilted her head, feigning innocence. "You did promise me homemade pasta tonight, Alexander. Unless you've changed your mind?"

Alexander blinked, then broke into a relieved grin. He reached over to tuck a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "Name the dish, darling. I'll cook you anything."

The engine roared to life before Ethan could react. Evelyn didn't even glance back as they pulled away - her answer couldn't have been clearer.

Ethan staggered backward as if struck, all color draining from his face. He crumpled to his knees on the pavement, watching helplessly as the taillights disappeared into the night.

###Chapter 323 A Decade of Longing

The car had barely left the driveway when Evelyn noticed Alexander's unusual silence. His jaw was clenched tight, fingers gripping the steering wheel with uncharacteristic tension.

She stole glances at his profile, the sharp angles of his face illuminated by passing streetlights. The words hovered on her tongue - What's wrong? - but something in his stormy expression made her swallow them back.

The city lights streaked past like shooting stars. Without warning, Alexander swerved into a deserted side street, tires screeching against asphalt. Before Evelyn could react, he'd already unbuckled her seatbelt with one hand while reclining her seat with the other.

In one fluid motion, he pulled her across the console onto his lap. The leather seat creaked beneath their combined weight as Alexander cradled the back of her head, pressing her against the cold steering wheel. His lips crashed into hers with a desperation that stole her breath.

It wasn't a kiss - it was a claiming.

His calloused palms framed her face as if she might disappear, his mouth mapping every inch of her with reverent urgency. The faint taste of coffee and mint exploded across Evelyn's senses as he deepened the kiss, his tongue sweeping possessively against hers.

The confined space filled with the scent of his cologne - sandalwood and something uniquely Alexander. Evelyn's fingers tangled in his hair as the world outside the tinted windows ceased to exist.

His teeth grazed her bottom lip, drawing a gasp that he swallowed hungrily. The dashboard clock ticked loudly in the sudden silence between breaths, marking seconds that stretched into eternity.

Alexander broke away just enough to rest his forehead against hers, his ragged breathing fogging up the windshield. "Say you're mine," he demanded, voice rough with emotion.

Not a request.

A plea.

The touch was so light it could have been mistaken for a passing breeze.

Overcome by the sudden intimacy, Evelyn attempted to turn away. Her thoughts raced. It's the middle of the day. Even if this alley is quiet, we're still parked right by the street. What if someone sees us?

But Alexander wasn’t having any of it.

Without hesitation, he pulled her back, his arms locking around her possessively. His kiss was relentless, demanding, leaving no room for escape.

Only when he was satisfied did he finally release her, his breathing uneven. He rested his forehead against hers, his voice low and rough. "Evelyn, I'm not in a good mood. Fix it."

Her pulse stuttered.

The way he said it—like a child denied his favorite treat—made her chest tighten.

Evelyn studied him carefully, her gaze softening. "Why are you upset? Is it because of what just happened?" She mentally replayed the last half-hour.

When Ethan had tried to corner her earlier, she had been firm in her rejection. She had made sure Alexander’s pride remained intact, ensuring he had the upper hand in every way.

He had dominated the encounter effortlessly.

So why was he still brooding?

Alexander abruptly let go of her, his expression dark. "Even though you shut him down, I’m still not happy." He reached into his pocket, pulling out a cigarette and placing it between his lips.

The tension in the air was thick enough to cut.

Alexander hadn't been part of her life in those seven years, leaving him with lingering insecurities.

The silver lighter clicked open, its flame dancing as Alexander shielded it to light his cigarette. He inhaled deeply, the nicotine calming his nerves before rolling down the tinted window of his car. Smoke curled into the evening air as he rested his arm against the frame, his gaze distant.

His voice was low, rough with emotion. "Ethan called me a coward. Said I was a venomous snake who'd sink to any depths."

Evelyn turned to him, her brow furrowing. "He was angry. You don't actually believe that, do you? You're the most principled man I've ever known, Alexander."

A humorless laugh escaped him as he stubbed out the cigarette. "You give me too much credit." He turned to face her fully, his dark eyes intense. The scent of tobacco clung to him as he confessed, "Evelyn, Ethan wasn't entirely wrong. I did whatever it took to make you mine. You have no idea the lengths I went to."

Her breath caught.

Alexander continued, voice raw, "I sought you out first. I'd wanted to marry you for years. That day you left Hawthorne Estate, broken and desperate, when you called me—" His jaw tightened. "I'd never felt such triumph."

"So yes," he admitted, "I took advantage. Every moment was calculated. I orchestrated Ethan's marriage to Vanessa. Those reporters waiting outside the hotel that night? They were mine." His fingers flexed against the steering wheel. "Does that disgust you?"

The silence between them grew heavy. Evelyn stared at him, seeing the man she loved in an entirely new light.

The phone trembled in my hand, my breath catching in my throat.

"Evelyn," Alexander's voice was rough with emotion, as if he'd been holding onto those words for years. "You have no idea."

A decade.

Ten years of silence. Ten years of wondering if he'd ever speak my name again.

My fingers tightened around the device, my pulse erratic.

"I've been waiting for this call," he admitted, the weight of those years pressing between us. "Every damn day."

The confession shattered something inside me.

I had thought I was the only one counting the days. The only one haunted by what we'd lost.

But he had been waiting too.

Silently.

Relentlessly.

Just like me.

###Chapter 324 Confession

Alexander tightened his grip on Evelyn's hand. "Even if you hadn't reached out to me first, I would have found my way to you. You were always meant to be mine."

His words sent a jolt through Evelyn, leaving her breathless.

"I've loved you for years," Alexander admitted, his voice soft but unwavering. "Since the moment you saved me a decade ago. It was instant—irrational, maybe, but undeniable."

Evelyn's mind reeled. Ten years? They had barely crossed paths back then. How could he have fallen for her so completely in just one encounter?

Yet, as she searched his face, she found no trace of deception. His gaze was steady, his expression raw with sincerity. It was almost startling—this man, so powerful in every other aspect of his life, was disarmingly vulnerable when it came to her.

Then it clicked.

Alexander had never been linked to any women. No scandals, no fleeting romances. Had he been waiting for her all this time? And when her trust in Ethan had shattered, had he simply stepped forward, finally free to claim what he'd always wanted?

The realization warmed her chest, spreading like sunlight. This was devotion. Not opportunism, not manipulation—just quiet, unwavering love.

A laugh bubbled up in her throat, giddy and disbelieving. She reached up, fingers threading through his tousled hair. "Alexander Whitmore," she murmured, shaking her head. "How are you real?"

Alexander's features softened as Evelyn traced the sharp lines of his jaw with her fingertips. The word "adorable" didn't quite fit him, yet here she was, using it anyway.

Evelyn's smile widened, her fingers gently pinching his cheeks, tugging his lips into an unwilling grin. No woman could resist a man so utterly devoted, and Evelyn was no exception. She cupped his face and kissed him firmly, pouring all her affection into it.

Seeing the warmth in Evelyn's eyes, the tension in Alexander's chest eased. His mood lifted, light as air.

He pulled her closer, letting her settle against his chest. Tilting his head, he brushed a kiss against her flushed lips. "Darling," he murmured, "as long as you're happy. Just love me a little more, that's all I ask."

Maybe it was the charged atmosphere, or the way they had bared their hearts to each other. Alexander's gaze darkened as he studied her, his thumb playfully tapping the tip of her nose. "Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured, voice low, "shall we go home?"

Their bodies pressed together, and Evelyn could feel the heat of his desire. The air between them shifted, thick with unspoken promises. A blush crept up her neck.

After dinner, Alexander wrapped his arms around her from behind, his breath warm against her ear. His gaze burned into her, intense and possessive.

That night, his kisses trailed over every inch of her skin, slow and deliberate. The dim light flickered wildly above them as Alexander moved with her, lost in the rhythm of their passion.

Evelyn, overwhelmed by the depth of his love, surrendered completely. Now that she knew the truth of his long-hidden feelings, she met him with equal fervor, their connection deeper than ever before.

The morning light spilled through the curtains as their bodies remained tangled in the sheets, skin still damp with sweat. Hours had slipped away unnoticed, consumed by their relentless passion.

Alexander’s voice was rough, breathless, as he pressed his lips to Evelyn’s flushed skin. "Do what you must with Vanessa," he murmured, fingers tracing the marks he’d left behind. "Don’t hold back, even with her condition. If there are consequences, I’ll handle them."

Evelyn’s body was alight with sensation, every touch igniting a fresh wave of heat. She melted into the mattress, exhaustion finally pulling her under.

When she awoke, the room was bathed in sunlight. Alexander was gone—likely already buried in work at Titan Capital Group’s international division, where holidays meant nothing.

Her thoughts drifted back to his words. Vanessa was pregnant, hidden away by Eleanor. A pregnant woman couldn’t be imprisoned, but that didn’t mean she would escape unscathed.

Evelyn smirked.

She would deal with Vanessa—just not yet.

For now, she’d let fate take its course.

And fate had never been kind to Vanessa Hart.

Ethan.

Knowing Ethan as intimately as she did, Evelyn was absolutely certain he wouldn't allow Vanessa to remain at his side any longer.

Vanessa had loved Ethan with every fiber of her being.

The agony of being discarded and cast into utter despair by the man she adored would wound her far deeper than any punishment Evelyn could devise.

The thought sent a shiver down Evelyn's spine.

She clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms.

This was justice.

This was poetic retribution.

Vanessa would finally understand the depth of pain she had inflicted upon others.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, watching her breath mist in the cold evening air.

The game was nearing its end.

And she would be the one left standing.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket.

Alexander's name flashed across the screen.

A small, genuine smile curved her lips.

He was her light.

Her redemption.

Her future.

Everything Vanessa had tried to steal from her.

But fate had other plans.

And Evelyn would make sure Vanessa paid for every single betrayal.

The wind howled through the trees, as if echoing her resolve.

Soon.

Very soon.

Justice would be served.

And Vanessa would drown in the consequences of her own cruelty.

###Chapter 325 Fear

The morning sun filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Carter sipped her coffee. Today was important—she had been invited to Olivia Cole's birthday celebration. Benjamin Cole, Alexander Whitmore's business associate, had personally sent the invitation. Declining wasn’t an option.

She set her cup down and turned to the vanity, carefully applying her makeup. Every stroke of the brush had to be perfect.

A soft knock interrupted her. Simon Graves entered, holding a garment bag. "Mr. Whitmore asked me to deliver this, Mrs. Whitmore. A gift for you."

Evelyn unzipped the bag, revealing an elegant dress. It wasn’t ostentatious, but the craftsmanship spoke of quiet luxury. She ran her fingers over the fabric before slipping into it. The mirror reflected a flawless fit, as if tailored just for her.

Her mind flashed back to last night—Alexander’s hands tracing her waist, his deep voice murmuring praise about her curves. Heat crept up her cheeks at the memory. His touch had memorized her measurements with unsettling precision.

She grabbed her phone and snapped a quick picture, sending it to Alexander with a message: [The dress is perfect. Thank you, darling.]

His reply came almost instantly: [Show me your gratitude properly tonight.]

Evelyn’s fingers twitched, the phone suddenly scorching in her grip. How could he—

The crisp paper of the invitation crinkled in Evelyn Carter's grip as she stepped through the grand doors of Whitmore Manor.

Across the city, Alexander Whitmore set his phone down with deliberate slowness. The CEO's leather chair creaked as he leaned back, meeting Ethan Caldwell's piercing stare head-on.

A smirk played at Alexander's lips as he tilted his chin up. "My wife just texted me. Why? Are you that interested in our private conversations?"

Ethan's knuckles turned white where they gripped the armrest. The way Alexander's entire demeanor had softened while reading that message made his stomach churn. That wasn't the cold, calculating businessman he knew - that was a man genuinely in love.

He swallowed hard, the taste of bile sharp on his tongue. When Alexander's gaze dropped pointedly to his bandaged hand, Ethan jerked it behind his back like he'd been burned.

The memory of yesterday's confrontation flashed behind his eyelids - Alexander's calm voice contrasting with the sickening crack of bone. The pain still throbbed through his entire arm, a constant reminder of his humiliation.

Alexander pretended not to notice his discomfort, sliding a file across the polished mahogany desk. "Explain this." His voice could have frozen hell. "The Horizon Enterprises merger was your project. Now it's a catastrophe."

Ethan's teeth sank into his bottom lip hard enough to draw blood as he flipped through the documents. He'd already pieced together what happened during the tense car ride here.

In his distraction before Christmas - distracted by thoughts of Evelyn, always Evelyn - he'd missed a decimal point in the financials. What should have been a $50 million acquisition had been signed for $5 million. The board would have his head for this.

The company had taken a devastating hit, and Alexander was livid. He'd called Ethan into the office despite it being the holidays.

Ethan knew he'd messed up. "I'll personally compensate Titan Capital Group for the losses," he said quickly.

Alexander's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Ethan, this isn't just about money."

His voice dropped, sharp as a blade. "Do you have any idea what this scandal will do to Titan Capital Group's reputation? A company of this magnitude making such an amateur mistake?"

A pause. Then, deliberately, Alexander added, "You haven't forgotten why your father was exiled overseas, have you? Why he still can't set foot in this country?"

Ethan's jaw clenched.

How could he forget?

Vincent had been in charge of Titan Capital Group for barely six months. In that short time, he'd bled the company dry—nearly ten billion dollars lost. Overnight, the empire became a hollow shell.

William had been furious. He'd had no choice but to recall Alexander, the estranged heir no one had taken seriously. Yet against all odds, Alexander had turned everything around within a year.

The difference between them was staggering.

Alexander's first act as CEO had been stripping Vincent of all authority. Then, he'd made sure every disastrous decision Vincent had made was publicly exposed.

Vincent lost everything—his position, his dignity. He became a laughingstock, whispered about in every elite circle.

Unable to bear the humiliation, Vincent had tried to sabotage Alexander—

The moment Alexander mentioned Vincent, Ethan understood everything.

Alexander's voice was ice. "Submit your resignation and explain yourself to the board."

Ethan's jaw clenched. This wasn’t just business—it was personal. Leaving Titan Capital Group meant losing any chance to see Evelyn regularly. Worse, it would erase his family’s remaining influence in the company entirely.

His gaze turned sharp. "I’ll resign. But tell me, Uncle Alexander—are you this desperate to remove me because you’re scared?" A bitter smirk twisted his lips. "Scared that Evelyn might still choose me one day?"

"Scared of you?" Alexander let out a derisive laugh. "Ethan, you overestimate your importance."

The air between them crackled with tension.

Ethan didn’t back down. "Then why the urgency? If you’re so confident, why force me out now?"

Alexander’s expression darkened. "This isn’t about confidence. It’s about consequences."

A beat of silence passed.

Ethan exhaled slowly, his voice dropping to a dangerous murmur. "Or maybe… it’s about control."

Alexander’s eyes flashed. "Careful, Ethan. You’re not in a position to make accusations."

Ethan held his stare, unflinching. "We’ll see."

With that, he turned and walked away, leaving the threat hanging in the air.

Alexander watched him go, his fingers tightening around the edge of his desk.

This wasn’t over.

Not even close.

###Chapter 326 Resignation

The air in the office grew heavier as Alexander Whitmore set down his pen, his piercing gaze fixed on Ethan Caldwell.

"Now that business is settled," Alexander began, his voice like winter frost, "let's address the personal matter between us."

He spun the pen between his fingers, the movement deliberate, controlled. "Don't mistake your relentless pursuit of Evelyn for some grand romantic gesture. Let’s be clear—right now, you’re no better than a man trying to steal another’s wife."

A muscle twitched in Ethan’s jaw.

"The illustrious Ethan Caldwell of Cresthaven, reduced to this?" Alexander’s lips curled in disdain. "The Caldwell family won’t stand for it. Neither will I."

He leaned forward, his tone cutting. "You have two choices."

"First—follow your father’s footsteps and disappear after the holidays."

"Or second—swear to me, in front of everyone at Whitmore Manor, that you’ll never approach Evelyn again." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Break that promise, and you’ll find yourself on the first flight out of the country."

Ethan’s fingers clenched into fists beneath the table.

He had known Alexander wouldn’t let yesterday’s confrontation go unanswered. But he hadn’t expected the man to strip him of every possible chance with Evelyn so ruthlessly.

Of course.

A man like Alexander Whitmore didn’t leave room for mercy when it came to rivals.

"Fair? Don't even start. Let me make this clear—Evelyn is mine now. Do you honestly believe the Caldwell name will protect you from me?"

Alexander's voice was a blade of ice.

This wasn't Uncle Alexander speaking. This was Evelyn's husband, ruthless and unyielding.

Their eyes clashed, and Ethan Caldwell felt the fight drain out of him.

His impulsive move had backfired spectacularly. Instead of gaining leverage, he'd trapped himself in a corner.

Now, he was caught between a storm and a cliff.

Alexander's warning couldn't be clearer. If Ethan pushed further, he'd face the consequences in front of the entire Whitmore family.

As things stood, Ethan had no ground to stand on. Exposing this would only humiliate him further.

A sharp ring cut through the tension—an international call.

Alexander's gaze flicked to the phone, then back to Ethan, colder than ever. "If you know what's good for you, pack your things and get out of Titan Capital Group."

Ethan stormed out of the office, his footsteps heavy as he headed toward the Marketing Department.

The office stood unnervingly quiet, with most employees still away on holiday. Ethan Caldwell found himself completely alone in the space that had once felt like a second home.

He had joined Titan Capital Group fresh out of university, dedicating years of his life to climbing its corporate ladder.

Now, because of one reckless error, he was being forced out. Though he retained his shares, his position within the company was no longer secure.

Leaning back in his chair, Ethan pressed his fingers against his temples, willing the throbbing ache to subside.

Titan Capital Group had been his entire world. Had Alexander Whitmore not suddenly emerged as the golden heir, Ethan would have been next in line for the CEO position.

But now? Alexander had taken everything. His father was exiled. Even his own place in the company was slipping through his fingers.

And Evelyn Carter—the woman he loved—was drifting further away with each passing day.

A bitter taste filled his mouth. He refused to accept that Alexander was superior in any way.

Everything Alexander can offer her, I can too. So why won’t Evelyn choose me?

He had admitted his mistakes. He had even swallowed his pride and begged for her forgiveness.

The HR department worked with ruthless efficiency. Despite the holiday, the paperwork was already—

The holiday atmosphere in Cresthaven was shattered within hours as Ethan Caldwell's resignation email landed in every Titan Capital Group employee's inbox.

Whispers spread like wildfire through the corporate halls.

Ethan Caldwell—forced out of Titan Capital Group?

In barely twelve months, both he and his father had been systematically outmaneuvered by Alexander Whitmore. The office grapevine overflowed with theories.

Some claimed Alexander was a cutthroat strategist. Others whispered that Ethan's catastrophic mistake had been an elaborate trap designed to remove the last remaining threat to Alexander's dominance.

As Ethan zipped up his final box of belongings, his phone vibrated violently against the polished mahogany desk. Eleanor's name flashed across the screen.

"Ethan! What in heaven's name happened? You resigned?"

###Chapter 327 Forging Our Own Path

“Yeah.”

The phone call had barely ended when another one came through.

“What’s this about you resigning?” His mother’s voice was sharp with accusation. “Is Alexander targeting you? I knew it! He’s always despised our family! This is his way of wiping us out—completely unacceptable! Has he lost his mind?”

Ethan exhaled sharply, pinching the bridge of his nose.

“You can’t just walk away, Ethan!” she continued, her tone bordering on hysterical. “If you leave Titan Capital Group, we lose all influence there! Do you realize what that means? Your father won’t even have a place to return to when he comes back from overseas!”

Overwhelmed, he ended the call without another word.

Before he could even set the phone down, it rang again.

This time, it was Trevor. “What the hell happened, man? You’re family! How did things get this bad? Alexander went nuclear—kicking you out like that?”

Ethan lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around him as he leaned back in his chair. “I messed up.”

Trevor scoffed. “Sounds like he was just waiting for an excuse. With the rest of the Whitmore family being so weak, getting rid of you means he has full control now.”

Ethan took a long drag, the bitterness in his chest growing.

“Let’s be real,” Trevor pressed. “A man without a career is nothing. And you know how fast news travels in our circles. This isn’t just about you—it’s about reputation.”

Ethan clenched his jaw, the weight of the situation settling heavily on his shoulders.

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows of Eclipse Lounge, casting long shadows across the polished mahogany table. Trevor Moss leaned forward, his fingers drumming impatiently against his glass of whiskey.

"Remember the old days?" Trevor smirked, swirling the amber liquid. "Back when you were the golden heir of Titan Capital Group? People bowed at your feet. Now?" He scoffed. "Without that shiny title, you're just another face in the crowd."

Ethan Caldwell exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples. His once-privileged life had crumbled, leaving him adrift. But Trevor’s next words sparked something inside him.

"Why don’t we build something ourselves?" Trevor’s eyes gleamed with reckless energy. "You’ve got the capital. I’ve got the hustle. Let’s break free from the damn Whitmores. Imagine it—Ethan Caldwell, self-made. No more living in Alexander’s shadow. And trust me, women love a man with his own empire."

Trevor had always been the dreamer, the one with grand schemes that his conservative parents had crushed at every turn. Yet, that fire in him had never died.

Ethan’s pulse quickened.

This could change everything.

The real reason he hesitated to challenge Alexander wasn’t just familial loyalty—it was power. The kind that made men kneel.

But what if he could stand as an equal?

In business, blood meant nothing. Only strength did.

And Evelyn…

Seven years. Seven years of memories. She couldn’t have erased them.

Otherwise, why would she have warned him yesterday? That single whispered "Be careful" when the knife flashed—it meant something.

Didn’t it?

His fingers curled into fists.

Maybe it was time to stop running.

Maybe it was time to fight back.

Evelyn’s invitation was met with immediate acceptance.

The door swung open without hesitation.

Benjamin Cole’s wife, Olivia, though nearing forty, could easily pass for early thirties.

Her embroidered gown shimmered under the chandelier light, exuding the effortless grace of high society.

When she spotted Evelyn, Olivia moved forward, her smile warm and welcoming. “Ms. Carter!”

Evelyn inclined her head slightly. “Mrs. Cole, please—just Evelyn.”

Olivia hadn’t anticipated Alexander’s wife to be so approachable.

Being married to a man like Alexander placed her at the very top of the social ladder.

An event like this was a privilege, yet Evelyn carried no arrogance—only quiet confidence.

Olivia felt an instant kinship with her.

Remembering the reason for the invitation, Olivia glanced behind her. “Where’s Mr. Herty?”

The attendant shook his head. “He was here moments ago.”

Evelyn’s brows lifted slightly. “Mr. Herty?”

A flicker of curiosity crossed her face.

The atmosphere hummed with murmured conversations and clinking glasses.

Evelyn’s gaze swept the room, taking in the glittering crowd.

Olivia leaned in slightly. “Leonard Herty—the renowned cellist. He was supposed to perform tonight.”

Evelyn’s lips curved. “Ah. I’ve heard of him.”

A beat of silence passed between them.

Then Olivia’s eyes brightened. “You know, I’ve been meaning to ask—how do you find Cresthaven?”

Evelyn’s smile deepened. “It’s growing on me.”

Olivia laughed softly. “Give it time. It has a way of pulling people in.”

A server passed by with champagne flutes.

Olivia plucked two, handing one to Evelyn.

Their glasses touched with a delicate chime.

Before either could speak again, a commotion near the entrance drew their attention.

A tall, broad-shouldered figure stepped into the room.

Alexander Whitmore.

His presence commanded the space effortlessly.

Evelyn’s pulse quickened.

Olivia’s knowing glance didn’t escape her.

“Seems someone’s eager to see you,” Olivia murmured.

Evelyn took a slow sip of champagne, her eyes never leaving Alexander.

“Or perhaps,” she countered lightly, “he’s just making sure I haven’t caused a scandal.”

Olivia chuckled. “Somehow, I doubt that’s his concern.”

Alexander’s gaze locked onto Evelyn’s.

The corner of his mouth lifted.

Evelyn exhaled slowly.

The night was far from over.

###Chapter 328 Save

Olivia Cole smiled warmly. "I happened to hear you play the cello recently, and as luck would have it, Leonard Herty is a master in that field. I thought you two might have much to discuss."

Beside them, an elegantly dressed woman leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Oh, you have no idea. Mr. Herty is in a league of his own. He performs exclusively for Cresthaven’s most distinguished circles—his concerts aren’t even publicly announced."

She lifted her chin slightly, her expression one of quiet awe.

Evelyn Carter understood instantly.

This was the world of true influence.

If one tried to uncover details about these individuals, they’d find only shadows. These were the untouchable elite, while those who paraded their riches were merely affluent.

The line between the two was stark, but the wealthy always sought to bridge the gap, eager to mingle with those who held real power.

Evelyn shook her head with a modest laugh. "I’m just an amateur. There’s no way I could keep up in a conversation with someone like him."

Olivia waved a dismissive hand. "Nonsense. I played your recording for him, and he was impressed. He said you have remarkable potential."

Her eyes gleamed with quiet triumph, as if she’d already orchestrated the perfect introduction.

The phone vibrated in Evelyn's palm.

"Hello?"

Margaret's voice cracked with uncharacteristic fragility. "Evelyn, darling. It's Mom."

A beat of silence.

"Could you...come home? Just for a little while? We need to talk."

Evelyn's grip tightened. "No. There's nothing left to say." She moved to disconnect.

"Wait!" Panic spiked through the receiver. "Where are you? If you won't come here, I'll—"

"Olivia Cole's birthday party. At their estate."

The line went dead.

The Cole mansion sprawled across three acres of Cresthaven's most exclusive neighborhood. With multiple Cole branches in the city, Evelyn doubted her mother would dare crash such a high-profile event.

Alexander's business associate Benjamin Cole commanded respect in elite circles. His wife's birthday gala had drawn half of high society—the gardens teemed with champagne flutes and designer gowns.

Evelyn wandered past a marble fountain when shouts erupted ahead.

"Someone collapsed!"

"Call an ambulance!"

A woman in emerald silk clutched her throat, knees buckling.

Evelyn froze.

The gasping figure wasn't just any guest.

It was Margaret Hayes.

"Someone call 911!"

Vanessa's heart pounded as she sprinted forward.

An elderly man with silver-streaked hair lay motionless on the pavement, his breathing labored, his forehead glistening with sweat. His ashen face twisted in discomfort.

The crowd had formed a hesitant circle around him, uncertain how to help.

"Step back, everyone! Give him room!" Vanessa commanded, her voice steady despite the urgency.

She dropped to her knees beside him, assessing his condition.

His skin was cold and damp, his fingers trembling faintly.

Without hesitation, she reached into her purse and pulled out a small chocolate bar. "When was the last time you ate?" she asked, unwrapping it and pressing it gently into his palm.

Bystanders exchanged confused glances. "Why are you giving him candy?" a woman whispered.

"His blood sugar's crashing," Vanessa explained briskly.

As if on cue, the man's eyelids fluttered open.

Though still pale, color was slowly returning to his cheeks.

"He's conscious!" someone gasped in relief.

"It was just hypoglycemia! That scared me half to death!"

"Do we still need to call an ambulance?"

A voice from the crowd suddenly spoke up. "Wait—isn’t that Mr. Herty? The world-famous cellist?"

Leonard Herty blinked, his vision slowly clearing. The first face he saw belonged to a striking young woman—graceful yet unassuming, radiating quiet elegance.

Moments ago, as his consciousness had wavered from the blood sugar crash, the world around him had blurred into indistinct shapes. The only thing that had anchored him was a soothing, melodic voice. He hadn’t been able to respond then.

Now, gazing at Evelyn, he felt an odd sense of recognition, as though he’d met her somewhere before.

Leaning in slightly, Evelyn murmured just loud enough for him to hear, "If you have irregular eating habits, always keep a piece of candy on you. And… you might want to get your liver checked."

Leonard’s brow furrowed. How does she know about my liver?

She had barely examined him.

Does she have medical training? A quick glance, and she’s already pinpointed the issue?

Her accuracy suggested she wasn’t just making guesses.

Secret Longing: Finding Love After Redemption (Evelyn)

###Chapter 329 Leverage

Richard held the car door open as Evelyn Sinclair stepped out.

Her gaze flickered with something unreadable as she looked at him. "I feel terrible for monopolizing your time like this. If you have other commitments, please don't let me hold you back. I can take these flowers to Mrs. Cole on my own."

Ever since aligning herself with Richard, Evelyn had strategically used his influence to establish her boutique floral business.

Her clientele consisted almost exclusively of the elite, cultivated through Richard’s extensive connections.

Ordinary customers didn’t interest her—not when the wealthy socialites, with their bottomless pockets and penchant for grand romantic gestures, were willing to spend exorbitant sums on lavish floral displays.

A single high-profile event, like a birthday gala, could net her six figures for nothing more than a few hours of work.

Over the years, she had amassed both wealth and a formidable network, ensuring that even if Richard’s support vanished overnight, she and Vanessa would never want for anything.

This time, for Olivia Cole’s birthday celebration, every arrangement had been sourced from Evelyn’s shop.

As the proprietor, she had personally curated an exquisite bouquet to deliver to the Cole residence.

But her motives weren’t purely professional.

She needed to see Olivia for herself.

The moment Evelyn Sinclair heard Richard Hayes would attend the birthday gala, anticipation curled in her stomach. Would he finally acknowledge her publicly?

In their elite circles, married men keeping mistresses was as common as champagne at brunch.

No wife would dare make a scene when half the women present played the same game.

That's why she'd "coincidentally" had car trouble today, conveniently needing Richard's chauffeur services.

Struggling with an oversized floral arrangement, Evelyn nearly stumbled when Richard reached out. "Let me help with that."

She shook her head, biting her lip. "If we walk in together...people might talk."

Deliberately putting distance between them, she pretended to adjust her shawl, creating plausible deniability.

Richard didn't push. Tonight he attended Olivia Cole's celebration strictly as Horizon Enterprises' CEO.

Business obligations demanded these tedious social performances between the Hayes and Cole dynasties.

"After delivering those," he nodded at the flowers, "wait in the car. James will take you home."

Evelyn's manicured nails dug into the ribbon wrapping the stems.

Richard Hayes showed no intention of publicly acknowledging her presence.

Once inside the Hawthorne Estate, they went their separate ways. Richard followed a servant through the manicured gardens, only to stumble upon a commotion.

He lingered at the garden's edge, observing as Leonard Herty regained his footing.

The sight of his former classmate left Richard momentarily stunned.

Leonard has been part of high society for years now—far removed from ordinary businessmen like me. Benjamin Cole must have serious influence to secure his attendance.

Countless people would kill for this opportunity. And here I am, with the advantage of our shared past.

But what truly shocked him was spotting Evelyn Carter standing beside Leonard.

So Evelyn was Leonard's savior?

This is fate smiling upon me.

With a debt of that magnitude, how could I not capitalize on it?

Securing Leonard's favor would be my golden ticket into elite circles. Horizon Enterprises would thrive like never before.

As the crowd thinned, Richard seized his moment and strode toward them.

Evelyn froze for a split second, her mind racing. Alexander? He's attending Olivia's birthday celebration?

Noticing her bewildered expression, Richard swiftly clarified, "Mr. Wells contacted me recently. He was deeply moved by your cello performance and expressed interest in mentoring you. Didn’t I mention this?"

That much was true—but Evelyn had declined the opportunity at the time.

Hearing Richard’s explanation, Leonard’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.

A realization dawned on him. No wonder she looked familiar when we first met. I’ve seen recordings of her playing the cello before.

The air between them thickened with unspoken thoughts.

Evelyn’s fingers twitched slightly, as if recalling the weight of the bow in her hand.

Leonard studied her with newfound interest, his earlier casual demeanor shifting into something more intent.

Richard watched the exchange, a knowing glint in his eyes.

Some opportunities, once lost, had a way of circling back.

The question was—would she take it this time?

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After Prison (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 330 Refusal

For years, countless hopeful musicians had approached Leonard Herty, begging for his guidance. Some truly desired to master the cello, while others saw him as nothing more than a means to climb the social ladder.

Leonard knew this all too well. It was why he had refused to take on students for so long.

The only exception had been Natalie Riley, a prodigious young cellist who had studied under him before he rose to prominence. She had been his pupil since the age of five, blossoming into a musician of extraordinary skill.

Yet now, Evelyn Carter had stirred something in him—something he hadn’t felt in years.

Her technique wasn’t flawless. Her execution needed refinement. But there was something undeniable in the way she played—an emotional intensity, a raw connection to the music that couldn’t be taught.

When Evelyn played, the cello didn’t just sing—it wept, it laughed, it breathed. Technique could be polished, but the soul she poured into every note was rare.

For the first time in decades, Leonard considered breaking his own rule.

He was certain—Evelyn had the makings of something extraordinary.

The irony wasn't lost on him. The talented young woman he'd been searching for was none other than the very apprentice he wished to mentor. Leonard found this twist of fate deliciously poetic.

His weathered face broke into a warm smile as he studied her. "Would you consider becoming my protégé? It would be my privilege to pass on everything I know and make you my final student."

Evelyn's breath caught. Her mind reeled at the realization that this was the legendary musician Olivia and the others had spoken of.

"Cat got your tongue?" Richard nudged her arm, his voice urgent. "Leonard Herty is offering to teach you! Do you understand how many would sell their soul for this chance?"

Evelyn pressed her lips into a thin line, tuning out Richard's excitement.

She met Leonard's expectant gaze and after a weighted pause, responded with gentle firmness, "Maestro Herty, your faith in me is humbling, but I'm merely a hobbyist. The cello is my escape, not my destiny."

Richard's jaw slackened, disbelief contorting his features.

His thoughts screamed, Have you lost your mind, Evelyn? This is your golden ticket into high society! How can you be so blind? You're rejecting what others would kill for!

Leonard reeled as if struck. After decades of rejecting pupils, he'd finally discovered someone worthy—only to face immediate rejection. The sting was sharper than he'd anticipated.

The air thickened with unspoken tension as Evelyn's refusal hung between them like a guillotine's blade.

To Leonard Herty's surprise, Evelyn Carter's blunt rejection didn't offend him—it intrigued him.

While others groveled for his attention, she stood firm, unshaken. A rare woman of principle.

A quiet laugh escaped him as he offered her an easy exit. "No pressure. Take all the time you need. My door remains open if you reconsider."

Richard Hayes, however, couldn't let this slip. His grip tightened on Evelyn's arm as he yanked her aside, frustration sharpening his tone.

"Have you lost your mind? This is Leonard Herty! Do you think he offers mentorship to just anyone?"

His voice dropped to a furious whisper. "You will accept. Do not humiliate him—or me—in front of everyone."

Evelyn stared at him, baffled. Since when did her choices belong to Richard?

Her retort came swift and biting. "Mr. Hayes, since when do you dictate my decisions? This is none of your concern."

The words rang louder than intended. Heads turned. Even Leonard's brows lifted, amusement flickering in his gaze.

Richard stiffened under the weight of their audience. The public defiance stung—a slap to his pride he hadn't seen coming.

Alexander turned back, his voice a dangerous whisper. "You're crossing a line."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "That line was drawn years ago. Tell me, what sort of father abandons his own flesh and blood?"

The entire elite circle knew about Richard and Margaret's twisted priorities.

Instead of cherishing their biological daughter, they had poured their love and resources into an imposter—a fact that had fueled endless high-society gossip.

The murmurs in the room grew louder. Some guests didn't even bother to hide their judgmental stares at Richard, clearly relishing the scandal unfolding before them.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love After Incarceration (Evelyn)

###Chapter 331 Unnecessary Drama

Richard Hayes' face drained of color as Evelyn Carter boldly exposed their fractured relationship in public.

Airing family grievances like this would undoubtedly make them the talk of the Hawthorne Estate.

"After everything I've sacrificed for you, you dare deny your own parents? What kind of ungrateful daughter are you?"

He shook his head in disappointment, as if Evelyn were beyond redemption.

"Vanessa, on the other hand, values the Hayes family's support. She's considerate and loyal. How can two sisters be so different?"

His words oozed contempt, clearly shifting all blame onto Evelyn.

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh. "If Vanessa's so perfect, why don't you go bother her instead? Why this sudden obsession with me?"

She took deliberate steps back, putting distance between them, her patience wearing dangerously thin.

Richard clenched his jaw, thinking bitterly, How did Margaret end up raising such a defiant child?

Here he was, humbling himself, offering apologies, even presenting her with the title deed to—

The truth was undeniable now—this girl had no heart! She believed she could throw her weight around simply because she had Alexander Whitmore wrapped around her finger.

What she didn’t realize was that once I secured my connection with Leonard Herty, Alexander would become irrelevant.

No more bending to his whims!

Richard Hayes shot a glance at Leonard, his voice dripping with false concern. "Mr. Herty, this girl is impossibly stubborn. She refuses to yield, and that kind of defiance makes her unteachable. Even if you took her under your wing, I doubt you could handle her."

He quickly added, "But I have another daughter—Vanessa Hart. She’s an extraordinary cellist, far superior to Evelyn. I can arrange for you to hear her perform. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed."

As he spoke, Richard fumbled with his phone, pulling up old recordings of Vanessa’s performances.

Evelyn couldn’t help but scoff.

Even now, her father was still pushing Vanessa forward as if she were the only daughter who mattered.

All his previous kindness had been nothing but a performance.

Thank heavens she had never trusted his empty promises.

Leonard’s expression darkened, his displeasure sharpening his tone. "No need for that."

Leonard flicked his wrist in clear dismissal, his expression icy.

"Talent alone means nothing without integrity. Your other daughter? She lacks both."

Richard bristled immediately. "Vanessa is devoted and kind! She’s everything a mentor could want!"

"Is she?"

Leonard’s lips curled in disdain.

Though he didn’t involve himself in Cresthaven’s petty gossip, the Hart family scandals had reached even his ears.

Vanessa’s so-called virtues aside, stealing her sister’s fiancé and being caught by paparazzi outside a luxury hotel? That wasn’t just scandalous—it was disgraceful.

Among the elite, whispers were inevitable. But true power demanded discretion.

Vanessa had made herself a laughingstock.

Leonard’s patience snapped. "If you believe Vanessa is so exceptional, by all means, find someone else to waste their time on her."

With those sharp words hanging in the air, Alexander Whitmore spun around without another glance.

His polished dress shoes clicked against the marble floor as he strode away, his broad shoulders rigid with unspoken fury.

Richard Hayes stood frozen in place, his mouth slightly agape.

The weight of Alexander’s dismissal settled over him like a suffocating blanket.

His fingers twitched at his sides, as if grasping for words that wouldn’t come.

The grand hallway of Titan Capital Group’s headquarters suddenly felt cavernous, the silence deafening.

Richard’s mind raced, replaying the confrontation in fragmented flashes.

He had expected resistance—but not this cold, cutting finality.

Alexander’s retreating figure turned the corner, disappearing from view.

Only then did Richard exhale, his shoulders slumping.

A bitter taste coated his tongue.

He had gambled and lost.

Badly.

Somewhere in the distance, an elevator dinged softly.

The sound snapped him back to reality.

He straightened his tie with stiff fingers, forcing composure into his expression.

But the sting of humiliation lingered.

Alexander Whitmore had made his stance painfully clear.

And Richard Hayes was no fool.

He knew when he’d been outmaneuvered.

With one last glance down the empty corridor, he turned and walked away—his pride in tatters.

###Chapter 332 Mud Stains

Nathaniel was stunned by Leonard’s sudden dismissal, his face twisting into a scowl as the weight of the rejection settled over him.

In his mind, they had once been classmates. Though years had passed without contact, there was no reason for Leonard to act so high-and-mighty in front of an old friend.

Humiliated in front of everyone, Nathaniel swiftly redirected his anger toward Evelyn.

"This is all your fault! You must have done something to piss him off, and now I'm paying the price!"

Evelyn arched a brow, genuinely baffled. "Hold on. Who exactly offended him? Me or you? Why do you always drag me into your mess?"

"You treat Vanessa like she’s some kind of saint! Open your eyes—look at how everyone else sees her!"

Evelyn let out a sharp, mocking laugh. "Oh, you haven’t heard? Damian already confessed that he and Vanessa plotted to frame me and get me arrested."

"Don’t look at me like that! I’m just stating facts. Ethan knows about it too—ask him if you don’t believe me."

"Only you would still think Vanessa is innocent. Let me tell you, this isn’t over. Damian was taken in for questioning yesterday, and soon enough, they’ll be knocking on Vanessa’s door. She won’t be—"

Evelyn cut herself off, her lips curling in cold amusement as Nathaniel’s expression darkened further.

The air between them crackled with tension, thick with unspoken accusations.

Nathaniel clenched his fists, his pride refusing to let him back down. "You’re just bitter because Ethan chose her over you."

Evelyn’s smile turned razor-sharp. "Oh, please. If I wanted Ethan, I could have had him. But unlike Vanessa, I don’t need to scheme and lie to keep a man."

The words hung in the air, heavy with implication.

Nathaniel’s face flushed with anger, but before he could retort, Evelyn turned on her heel and walked away, leaving him seething in her wake.

The confrontation had only just begun.

And Vanessa’s reckoning was coming.

Evelyn's words exploded like fireworks, sending shockwaves through the gathered crowd.

Though no one recognized Damian Cross by name, the implication was clear—he was tangled in Evelyn's dark history.

Her composed tone suggested layers of untold secrets simmering beneath the surface.

Just as anticipation thickened, Evelyn spun away without another word, leaving the audience hanging.

The energy dissipated, and people began drifting apart, murmurs lingering in the air.

Richard Hayes clenched his jaw, irritation flashing in his eyes.

Then, from the shadows, Evelyn Sinclair emerged.

She had caught every word—the accusations, the mention of Damian's arrest, the veiled threat of a reopened investigation.

Her stomach twisted into knots.

Stepping in front of Richard, she studied the storm of emotions crossing his face.

"Vanessa is our daughter. You must believe in her innocence. Don’t let that girl’s poisonous whispers get to you."

Richard folded his arms, his expression turning to stone. He remained silent, choosing to wait and watch.

Richard Hayes wasn't foolish.

After decades in the business world, he knew better than to underestimate a situation like this.

The fact that Evelyn Carter was willing to drag this scandal into the light meant she had solid evidence backing her claims.

Three years ago, he had acted impulsively.

Seeing Vanessa Hart hurt had clouded his judgment.

In that heated moment, he hadn’t considered the consequences.

Evelyn’s defiance had pushed him to his breaking point, and Vanessa had convinced him that sending her to prison would finally teach her a lesson.

Now, Richard’s voice was dangerously quiet.

"Tell me the truth, Evelyn Sinclair. What really happened three years ago?"

Evelyn Sinclair’s fingers twisted nervously, her lips pressed into a thin line.

The plan had been hers and Vanessa’s from the start.

They had believed prison would crush Evelyn’s spirit, clearing the path for Vanessa to become the undisputed heiress of the Hawthorne Estate.

Vanessa’s scheme had worked flawlessly—until now.

Evelyn Sinclair had never imagined the past would resurface like this.

And she certainly hadn’t expected Evelyn to gain the backing of someone as powerful as Alexander Whitmore.

Her voice wavered, but she held firm.

"Even if Damian Cross changes his story now and claims—"

The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife.

"Richard, Vanessa is our daughter," Evelyn Sinclair hissed, her grip tightening on his arm. "How can you even question her loyalty? And Damian? He grew up under the same roof as Evelyn—they're practically family!"

Richard exhaled slowly, considering her words.

It did make sense.

Damian was unreliable—a gambler who could switch sides in an instant.

Seeing the hesitation flicker in Richard's eyes, Evelyn pressed closer. "If he starts spreading lies about Vanessa, you must stand by her. Don't let him manipulate you!"

Richard gave her hand a reassuring pat, about to respond—

Then a voice, sharp as shattered glass, sliced through the moment.

"Well, Richard, isn’t this a sight?" Margaret Hayes stood behind them, her face flushed with fury, eyes burning like embers. "Keeping a mistress behind my back? And bold enough to bring her to Olivia Cole’s birthday party? Do I mean nothing to you?"

The accusation hung in the air, heavy and suffocating.

Evelyn Sinclair stiffened, her grip on Richard’s arm turning vice-like.

Margaret’s glare could have melted steel.

And just like that—the carefully constructed peace shattered.

###Chapter 333 A Moment Too Late?

Margaret's unexpected arrival sent shockwaves through Richard and Evelyn Sinclair.

The instant Richard spotted her, all color drained from his face. His grip on Evelyn's wrist slackened involuntarily.

Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined Margaret would appear at Olivia Cole's birthday celebration.

But the damage was done - she'd witnessed everything.

Truth be told, Margaret had been observing from the shadows for some time. She'd been present when Richard approached Leonard Herty about mentoring Vanessa Hart, choosing to remain silent as she watched the scene unfold.

Yet as guests began drifting apart, her sharp eyes caught the intimate proximity between Richard and a strikingly familiar woman.

Every nerve in Margaret's body screamed danger.

That face... she knew it all too well.

This was Richard's former personal assistant from Horizon Enterprises!

The woman had been legendary for her breathtaking beauty and hourglass figure. Half the single men at the company had fallen under her spell during her tenure.

Whispers spread like wildfire through the office.

Margaret Hayes never tolerated gossip. When she heard the rumors, she had stormed into Richard’s office, only to discover he had already dismissed his secretary.

At the time, Margaret had felt a rush of relief, convincing herself she had overreacted. She thought she had misjudged her husband.

Her trust in Richard had remained unshaken—until now.

Years later, seeing them together at the party was a brutal wake-up call.

Her pulse spiked as realization struck.

What does this mean? They’ve stayed in contact all this time? Richard fired her out of guilt, just to shut me up!

Fury burned through her. She marched straight to Richard and grabbed his tie, jerking him forward.

"Richard! You will explain yourself tonight!"

Her voice was sharp, drawing stares. "How dare you lie to me? Keeping a mistress behind my back?"

Caught off guard, Richard stumbled forward as she yanked him closer.

Then—

A loud whoosh.

His wig flew off, landing on the floor with an almost comical bounce.

The room fell silent.

Bald patches gleamed under the chandelier light.

Margaret froze.

Richard’s face turned crimson.

And the party guests?

They stared.

Some gasped.

One stifled a laugh.

Margaret’s grip on his tie loosened.

This… was not the confrontation she had planned.

"Mr. Hayes' scalp is shinier than my grandmother's antique silver tray!"

"I always wondered how Richard kept such thick hair at his age. Now we know—it was all fake!"

"Where did he even get that wig? It looked so natural! Someone get me the shop's details!"

"Maybe you can ask him yourself—after he recovers from this humiliation."

Richard Hayes' face burned scarlet as he stood frozen, the discarded wig lying at his feet like a dead animal. His dignity had evaporated in seconds.

Margaret Hayes showed no mercy, her voice sharp enough to slice through steel.

"Richard, cat got your tongue? Or are you too ashamed to even speak?"

Her laughter was bitter, laced with years of resentment. "At your age, you should know better than to embarrass yourself like this. Half a minute? That’s all you’ve got? And yet you still had the audacity to cheat?"

The crowd erupted into fresh laughter, some clutching their stomachs.

One voice rose above the rest, mockingly sympathetic. "Come on, give the man a break! He’s over fifty—half a minute is practically a marathon at that age!"

Richard’s hands trembled, caught between retrieving his wig and fleeing the scene entirely. But Margaret wasn’t done.

"Pathetic," she spat. "Utterly pathetic."

The whispers around them grew louder, the spectacle too delicious to ignore.

And in that moment, Richard Hayes realized—his reputation would never recover.

The flush of humiliation burned across Richard's face. He couldn't comprehend how he'd become the laughingstock of this situation.

Wrenching himself from Margaret's iron grip, he snapped, "Thirty seconds? That's your pathetic standard! You know damn well what you're like in bed! Get your hands off me!"

His voice cracked with indignation as nearby guests stifled laughter. The grand ballroom of Whitmore Manor suddenly felt suffocating.

Margaret's grip only tightened, her manicured nails digging into his forearm. "Oh darling," she purred with saccharine sweetness, "must we air our private affairs in public?"

A waiter nearly dropped his champagne tray. Across the dance floor, Evelyn Carter discreetly turned away, shoulders shaking with silent laughter.

Richard's tie felt like a noose. "This is ridiculous!" he hissed, desperately trying to salvage his dignity. "I demand—"

"Demand?" Margaret arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Like you demanded that prenup amendment last week?" Her voice carried just enough to make nearby socialites lean closer.

The string quartet chose that moment to pause between songs, making Margaret's words echo across the marble floors. Richard wished the ground would swallow him whole.

Alexander Whitmore appeared at Evelyn's side, his smirk barely concealed behind a crystal tumbler. "Should we intervene?" he murmured.

Evelyn shook her head, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Let them have their moment. It's more entertaining than the opera."

At the center of the storm, Richard finally wrenched free, stumbling back into an ice sculpture. The frozen swan toppled with a crash that silenced the entire room.

Margaret sighed dramatically. "Always so... abrupt in your movements, dear."

The resulting laughter followed Richard all the way to the men's lounge, where he vowed to file for divorce by morning.

###Chapter 334 A Complete Joke

Richard's temper ignited like wildfire as he seized Margaret by the arm, flinging her aside with enough force to send her stumbling.

Her fury burned white-hot, but against his brute strength, she was powerless.

Hearing Richard openly mock her feelings only poured gasoline on the flames of her rage.

"Oh, I see now! I'm just some uptight, proper wife while you're out there sniffing after those pathetic, attention-starved tramps!"

Her control shattered. She launched herself at him, fists flying, nails scratching—every ounce of her fury unleashed.

"And you!" She whirled on Evelyn Sinclair, eyes blazing. "You think you can just waltz in and steal my husband? Disgusting homewrecker!"

"Who the hell do you think you are, prancing around like you belong here? You're nothing but a washed-up hag with no shame!" Margaret spat, venom dripping from every word.

Blinded by rage, she lunged—her palm cracked across Evelyn's cheek with a sharp, satisfying smack.

Deep down, Margaret had known something was off about Richard for weeks.

Just days ago, he hadn't come home, claiming he'd been drinking with business partners and needed to stay at a hotel.

The excuses had been flimsy. The scent of cheap perfume on his collar had been unmistakable.

Now, seeing him with Evelyn—her lipstick smudged, her blouse wrinkled—confirmed every ugly suspicion.

Margaret's chest heaved. Her vision blurred with unshed tears.

This wasn't just betrayal.

This was humiliation.

And she wouldn't let either of them forget it.

A Laughingstock Trapped in Her Own Delusions

Margaret had gone through every frame of the security footage. The voices were distorted but undeniably feminine.

Yet without a clear image to match, her doubts remained just that—unsubstantiated suspicions.

For days, she had been restless, itching to call Evelyn and pour out her frustrations.

When Evelyn mentioned she was at Olivia’s birthday celebration, Margaret didn’t hesitate to join.

She never expected to stumble upon the truth in such a blatant way: Richard, hand in hand with his mistress, in the middle of the afternoon.

The betrayal cut deeper than any blade.

All those years she had sacrificed for this family, and now she felt like the biggest fool alive.

From a distance, she couldn’t catch every word, but as she edged closer, fragments of their conversation about Vanessa reached her ears.

Now, seeing Evelyn Sinclair up close—those sharp features, that unmistakable nose—everything clicked into place with terrifying clarity.

A cold shiver raced down Margaret’s spine as the horrifying realization struck her.

Her breath hitched.

Could it really be?

The realization struck her like lightning, igniting a fire in her veins.

Her mind screamed, "After everything I've sacrificed for that girl, I've been raising the mistress's child?!"

Blinded by fury, Margaret unleashed a storm of slaps across Evelyn's face.

"You deceitful little snake! You'll regret this!"

Evelyn curled into herself, shielding her head as Margaret's rage rained down. The woman was a force of nature, terrifying in her unrestrained wrath.

Within seconds, Evelyn's hair was a wild tangle, her cheeks burning with the imprint of Margaret's fury.

Desperate, Evelyn shot a pleading look at Richard. "Richard, please! Stop her!"

Humiliation burned through her as she buried her face in her knees, unable to meet anyone's gaze.

Finally, Richard adjusted his disheveled wig and rushed forward, stepping between them.

"What in God's name are you doing, Margaret? People are watching! Have you lost all sense of dignity?"

Margaret scoffed, her voice dripping with venom. "Me? The one who should be ashamed is the man who paraded his mistress's child under my roof! Don't you dare lecture me!"

The crowd around them buzzed with murmurs—powerful figures, business associates, all witnessing the scandal unfold.

The weight of their judgmental gazes pressed down on him like a physical force.

Every whispered comment was another needle pricking at his already frayed patience.

"Not here," he ground out between clenched teeth. "We'll deal with this at home."

His grip on her wrist tightened imperceptibly before he forced himself to release her.

The unspoken threat hung heavy between them - this wasn't just personal anymore.

"Do you really want to risk Horizon Enterprises' reputation over this petty drama?" His voice dropped to a dangerous murmur.

The crowd around them leaned in, hungry for more scandal.

She flinched at the mention of the company, her defiance wavering.

In that moment, he saw the exact moment she realized the stakes.

The satisfaction that curled through him was bitter and hollow.

###Chapter 335 Regret

Horizon Enterprises didn't become successful just because of Richard. Margaret had poured her heart and soul into the company too.

Trying to reason with an enraged woman was pointless.

The only way to snap her out of it was to remind her of what truly mattered—forcing her to face the consequences of her actions.

The moment Richard mentioned the company, Margaret's expression flickered with hesitation.

But that brief moment of clarity vanished when she spotted Evelyn pushing through the crowd toward her. The fury she had just barely suppressed roared back to life.

Margaret clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. How could I have been so blind? Evelyn suffered all these years because of me!

Her love for Vanessa ran deep. From the moment Vanessa was born, Margaret had raised her as her own, watching her grow from a helpless infant to a bright, lively girl who called her "Mom."

That bond was unbreakable—as real as if they shared the same blood.

When Evelyn had first returned home, Margaret had been cautious, wary.

The truth crashed over Margaret like a tidal wave.

Her mind reeled with the horrifying realization—"All these years, I've been raising the child of the woman who stole my husband!"

Guilt, rage, and disgust twisted inside her until she could barely breathe.

Her heart ached for Evelyn.

In the storm of her emotions, nothing else mattered—not Horizon Enterprises, not her social standing, not even the decades of carefully maintained appearances.

Only one thought consumed her: "How could I have been so blind?"

She had been manipulated.

And because of it, her own daughter had suffered.

Now, Vanessa and Richard's strange behavior made perfect sense.

Of course they knew.

Vanessa must have always known Sandra was her real mother.

They had played her like a fool.

While she showered affection on the mistress's daughter, she had scorned her own flesh and blood.

Margaret could almost hear Sandra's mocking laughter when she'd sent Evelyn to prison.

What have I done?

The weight of her mistakes pressed down until she wanted to scream.

She deserved worse than a slap.

She deserved to burn.

The commotion had drawn Evelyn Carter to the scene, her heart pounding with concern over the violent clash between Richard Hayes and Margaret Hayes.

Their marriage had always been strong, weathering minor storms with ease. But seeing them physically fight in public—this was something entirely different. Something catastrophic.

When Evelyn arrived, her breath caught in her throat.

Margaret wasn’t just arguing—she was attacking both Richard and Evelyn Sinclair with a fury Evelyn had never witnessed before.

Something had shattered.

Then, as Evelyn Sinclair lifted her head, Evelyn Carter’s stomach dropped.

The resemblance was undeniable.

Margaret’s voice cut through the air like a blade. "Vanessa is your bastard child, isn’t she? She’s this woman’s daughter!"

Her accusation struck like lightning, electrifying the stunned onlookers.

"You two played me for a fool! You swapped my own child for yours!"

The crowd stood frozen, the revelation hitting them like a tidal wave.

Richard had introduced Evelyn Sinclair to countless business associates over the years, always presenting her as a trusted advisor.

No one had ever guessed the truth—that their bond ran so deep, it had produced a child.

"Vanessa bears an uncanny resemblance to Evelyn Sinclair."

The whispered words hung heavy in the air between them.

"So you're saying Vanessa isn't just some imposter?" Eleanor's manicured fingers tightened around her champagne flute. "She's actually Richard's illegitimate daughter?"

Across the gilded ballroom, Vanessa Hart laughed too brightly at something Alexander Whitmore said, her emerald-green gown shimmering under the crystal chandeliers. The same way Evelyn Sinclair's eyes had sparkled twenty years ago.

Margaret Hayes nearly dropped her hors d'oeuvres plate. "That would explain why William left her shares in Horizon Enterprises."

At the periphery of the crowd, Evelyn Carter froze mid-conversation with Nathan Reeves. The fragmented whispers reached her like shards of broken glass.

Vanessa. Richard's daughter.

The revelation struck with the force of a physical blow. All those years of stolen childhood moments, of whispered arguments behind closed doors at Hawthorne Estate - they took on horrifying new meaning.

Alexander's protective arm encircled Evelyn's waist as he felt her tremble. His storm-gray eyes darkened with realization.

The pieces clicked into place with terrible clarity. Vanessa's relentless vendetta. The sabotaged business deals. The leaked photos last Christmas. It had never just been about money or status.

This was about blood.

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms as the orchestra swelled. One thought eclipsed all others:

Her entire life had been built on a foundation of lies.

###Chapter 336 A Shocking Revelation?

"What really happened with the baby switch all those years ago?"

"Isn't it obvious? Evelyn Sinclair swapped Margaret's real daughter with her own."

"God, what a calculated move! Turning her bastard child into the legitimate heir overnight. Evelyn played this perfectly! Margaret must be boiling with rage after raising her enemy's child all these years."

"She didn't just steal her husband - she stole Margaret's baby too. That's a new low, even for Evelyn."

"Thank heavens Evelyn Carter was found. Can you imagine if she hadn't been? She'd have lived her whole life in that nightmare."

"Let's be honest - both Margaret and Evelyn are the true victims in this mess."

The whispers swirled around Richard Hayes, who stood frozen, the weight of these revelations crushing him.

His silence only stoked Margaret's fury higher. "You vile witch!" she screamed, her palm connecting with Evelyn Sinclair's cheek again. "How could you do this to my child? What kind of monster are you?"

Each slap left Evelyn's face more swollen, the humiliation burning deeper.

Trapped in Margaret's wrath, she couldn't even raise her hands to defend herself, her desperate eyes pleading with Richard for intervention.

Margaret trembled with barely contained fury, her voice sharp as shattered glass. "Richard, while I was giving birth, you and that woman secretly switched my daughter. Did you really think I’d just vanish into thin air?"

Her finger jabbed into his chest like a dagger. Richard paled, his breath hitching.

The truth was, Richard had been oblivious to the swap when it happened.

It wasn’t until Margaret uncovered the deception that he reconnected with Evelyn Sinclair.

At first, he had been horrified by Evelyn’s decision.

It was cruel.

Unforgivable.

But when Evelyn broke down, confessing how she had endured society’s judgment while raising her child alone, he understood.

She hadn’t wanted her daughter to grow up labeled as a bastard.

So she had taken Margaret’s child instead.

"Where is the other girl?" Richard had demanded.

Once Evelyn confessed, he tracked down Evelyn Carter—his flesh and blood, no matter who raised her.

Margaret's accusations hung heavy in the air between them.

Richard couldn't betray Evelyn Sinclair now.

Doing so would only redirect Margaret's fury toward her, escalating the conflict further.

"Evelyn has been found, and that chapter is closed. Why dredge up the past?" Richard replied, forcing his voice to remain calm.

Tears welled in Margaret's eyes, her voice trembling with raw emotion. "Finding her doesn't erase the pain she endured!"

"Richard, you owe us both! I want a divorce—and you will walk away with nothing!"

A cold mask settled over Richard's features.

Decades of marriage had entangled their families' fortunes. Untangling them now would be catastrophic.

A public divorce would force a complete restructuring of Horizon Enterprises, triggering media chaos and a devastating stock plunge.

Who could survive that fallout?

Richard assumed Margaret was merely lashing out in anger. He stepped closer, his voice low and measured. "Let's not cause a scene. Too many people are watching."

"A scene?" Margaret's laugh was sharp, brittle. "This isn't some petty argument!"

Margaret Hayes stared at Ethan Caldwell, her hands trembling with suppressed fury.

This man—the one she had shared her life with for decades—now felt like a complete stranger.

She was the victim here, yet he dismissed her pain as if it were nothing more than a dramatic performance.

All she wanted was answers.

A confrontation about his betrayal.

But he acted like it was just another petty disagreement.

Her chest tightened as she thought of Evelyn Carter.

How devastating it must have been for her to endure this kind of cruelty in the past.

The realization hit her like a physical blow.

She wasn’t just fighting for herself anymore.

She was fighting for every woman who had ever been silenced.

Her voice hardened.

“You don’t get to walk away from this.”

Ethan scoffed, rolling his eyes.

“Margaret, don’t be ridiculous. You’re making a scene.”

Her nails dug into her palms.

Making a scene?

If he wanted a scene, she’d give him one.

###Chapter 337 Truth Revealed

No one believed Evelyn at that moment. They all assumed she was just causing unnecessary drama.

Yet as the saying goes, you never truly understand someone until you walk in their shoes. Suddenly, Margaret found herself drowning in the same suffocating emotions Evelyn had described.

The commotion grew louder, drawing even the hostess, Olivia, away from her guests.

It was her birthday celebration, after all. Olivia approached Margaret with concern, asking if everything was alright and offering assistance.

Margaret knew she couldn’t continue this confrontation—not here, not at someone else’s joyous occasion.

She shot Richard a blistering glare before turning her attention to Evelyn Sinclair, who was still clutching her stinging cheek.

"This isn’t over, Richard," Margaret hissed, her voice sharp enough to cut glass.

Her gaze flickered toward the exit just in time to see Evelyn slipping away. Without hesitation, Margaret chased after her, desperation clawing at her chest.

The moment Margaret disappeared, Evelyn Sinclair—still sniffling dramatically—rushed toward Richard, her voice dripping with false innocence.

"Richard! Margaret is absolutely vicious! She doesn’t behave like a proper lady at all!"

Margaret's words resonated deeply with Richard.

Evelyn, the cherished only daughter, had lived a sheltered life. Her stubborn personality constantly clashed with his own.

"Creating such a public spectacle—she clearly doesn't know how to manage situations properly," Richard muttered, irritation simmering beneath his composed exterior.

"Did you see the rage in her eyes when she stormed out? She won’t just walk away from this. She’ll pin everything on our Vanessa!" Evelyn Sinclair cried, her voice trembling with panic.

Abruptly, she buried her face in her hands, tears spilling over once more.

"How can I ever show my face in society after being humiliated like this? What will become of my boutique?"

The mention of her boutique gave Richard pause.

Now that Margaret knew of Evelyn’s existence, she wouldn’t let this go quietly.

If he didn’t sever ties with Evelyn completely, Horizon Enterprises could face serious repercussions.

With a measured glance, Richard made his decision. "Evelyn, I think it’s best if we don’t see each other for a while."

Evelyn’s eyes widened in shock. "Richard… what are you saying?"

"Your flower shop is just a short ride away. Take a cab home." His voice was clipped, devoid of warmth. "I have matters to attend to. And be cautious—Margaret might retaliate by targeting your shop."

Without another word, Richard Hayes turned on his heel and strode away, leaving Evelyn Sinclair standing there, her nails digging into her palms.

Two decades had slipped by, yet Richard remained exactly the same.

Back then, she had been his personal assistant, shadowing his every move. What had started as professionalism had slowly simmered into something more.

Their encounters had been sporadic, but it had been enough for Margaret to catch wind of it.

The moment Richard learned his wife was returning, he hadn’t hesitated. He’d fired Evelyn on the spot.

Humiliated and furious, she had taken the money and left—but the bitterness had festered. It had driven her to make that irreversible decision.

Now, rage coiled tight in her chest. She snatched her phone and dialed Vanessa Hart’s number.

"Vanessa, we have a crisis." Her voice was sharp with urgency. "Margaret caused a scene today. The truth about your parentage is about to explode—soon, everyone will know you're the product of an affair."

Vanessa’s blood ran cold.

Just days ago, she had been forced to endure an abortion under Ethan Caldwell’s pressure, only to be dragged away by Eleanor to—

The grand estate had always been her sanctuary. Not even Ethan Caldwell would risk making a scene within these walls.

After days of restless anxiety, her delicate condition had finally stabilized. But the moment she heard whispers of her secret threatening to spill, Evelyn Carter shot upright, bare feet hitting the cold marble floor.

"Where do you think you're going?" Alexander Whitmore's voice cracked like a whip across the sunlit bedroom. "Get back in bed this instant."

His commanding tone made her flinch, but desperation clawed at her throat. She couldn't let this happen. Not now. Not when she'd sacrificed so much to keep this one fragile truth hidden.

The morning light streaming through the bay windows painted golden stripes across Alexander's furious expression as he blocked the doorway. His usually impeccable shirt was rumpled from sleepless nights spent at her bedside, the dark circles under his eyes mirroring her own exhaustion.

Evelyn's fingers twisted in the silk sheets. "You don't understand—"

"I understand perfectly." He stepped closer, the scent of his expensive cologne mixing with the sterile hospital smell that still clung to her skin. "One wrong move and we lose everything."

Outside, a car door slammed. Voices carried from the courtyard below. The walls of Whitmore Manor, once her impenetrable fortress, suddenly felt paper-thin.

###Chapter 338 The Round-Faced Toddler

Eleanor fixed Vanessa with a stern look. "Didn't Dr. Wells specifically order bed rest?"

"I just want to visit Willowbrook Apartments for a little while. It's a short trip—I have a car arranged. Nothing will go wrong!" Vanessa protested.

Eleanor's frown deepened. "And why exactly do you need to go?"

Vanessa chewed her bottom lip, her voice barely above a whisper. "I miss my family... I just need to see them."

"You're recovering and carrying a child. If anyone should be visiting, it should be them coming to you. You shouldn't be exerting yourself," Eleanor insisted, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Eleanor was fiercely protective of Vanessa's pregnancy. Even Harold had mentioned just days ago that they would host a grand celebration once the baby arrived.

Inwardly, Eleanor thought, Does this mean Vincent will finally return?

That’s why this pregnancy must go smoothly. The baby has to be born safe and healthy!

Just then, a maid hurried in from the hallway, leaning close to whisper something urgent into Eleanor's ear.

Vanessa's fingers curled into tight fists, her nails digging into her palms.

Eleanor's voice dripped with mockery. "How amusing. All this time, I thought you were just some insignificant girl, but you're actually Richard's illegitimate daughter? How... unexpected."

Vanessa's face drained of color. She hadn't anticipated the news spreading so fast—especially not with Eleanor still in the house.

If Eleanor knew, the rumors outside would be far worse.

Eleanor had always despised her. Now, with the label of a bastard child, she had even more reason to push Vanessa aside.

Her gaze dropped to Vanessa's swollen belly.

"Vanessa, stop this foolishness. Stay in bed and don’t go anywhere. You're in the center of a storm right now. Stepping outside will only make things worse."

"Your only priority is that child. Deliver a healthy, plump little prince, and suddenly, everyone will call you blessed. Who will care about your origins then? Just don’t lose sight of what truly matters."

"And remember—once you leave this house, I can’t shield you. If Ethan gets his hands on you and forces an abortion, you’ll lose everything."

Normally, Eleanor wouldn’t waste so many words on Vanessa.

But the thought of her acting recklessly and endangering the baby was unbearable.

The moment Evelyn stepped outside, her eyes landed on a sleek vintage car parked by the curb.

Alexander leaned casually against the polished frame, his posture relaxed. When he spotted Evelyn, a slow, warm smile spread across his face.

Evelyn blinked in surprise, her heart skipping a beat. She hurried toward him, her voice laced with disbelief. "You came to pick me up?"

Alexander nodded, his expression shifting to concern. The commotion inside the estate had been loud enough to reach his office.

He had rushed over, his stomach twisting at the thought of Evelyn caught in the middle of the chaos.

"What's wrong?" he teased, tilting his head slightly. "Aren't you happy to see me?"

Evelyn exhaled, the tension in her shoulders melting away. His presence was like sunlight breaking through storm clouds.

"Of course I'm happy!" she exclaimed, her mood lifting instantly.

Just then, Margaret burst out of the grand doors of Hawthorne Estate, her voice sharp with urgency. "Evelyn! We need to talk!"

Evelyn turned, her expression turning icy. "There's nothing left to say."

Without another word, she reached for the car door.

Margaret rushed forward, desperation creeping into her tone. "Evelyn, I know you're angry with me, but you have to understand—I was deceived! I regret not seeing through that mother-daughter pair sooner. They manipulated me!"

Tears cascaded down Margaret's cheeks as the devastating truth crashed over her.

She had been such a fool.

How could she have ever mistaken the counterfeit for the real thing? Because of her blindness, her precious daughter had endured unbearable suffering and injustice.

Yet Margaret herself had been cruelly deceived for years.

Her husband—the man she had trusted with her life—had been carrying on an affair behind her back. He'd fathered another child.

Worse still, he'd switched their own baby.

The crushing weight of anguish and regret pressed down on Margaret's chest, filling her with a sorrow so profound it threatened to drown her.

Every breath burned.

Every heartbeat ached.

She had failed her daughter in the worst possible way.

Now she would spend the rest of her life making amends—if Evelyn would ever forgive her.

The thought sent fresh tears streaming down her face as she clutched the photograph of her real daughter to her chest. That sweet, plump little boy in the other photo wasn't hers at all.

The deception cut deeper than any knife.

###Chapter 339 Don’t Want to See Him

Margaret’s usually immaculate hair was tangled, her eyes swollen from crying. The elegant, composed socialite Evelyn had always known was nowhere to be seen.

To Evelyn, Margaret had always been the picture of poise—graceful even when facing the humiliating truth of her husband’s affairs.

But today, the carefully constructed facade had shattered. The scandal, the public breakdown—it all stemmed from one devastating revelation: Evelyn Sinclair had secretly switched their children years ago.

The weight of that betrayal had crushed Margaret completely.

And perhaps, beneath the anger, there was something else—a quiet, gnawing guilt toward Evelyn herself.

Evelyn’s chest tightened. After a long silence, she finally spoke. "Get in. I’ll drive you."

The sun dipped low, casting long shadows across the secluded Hawthorne Estate. Finding a cab here would be nearly impossible.

Relief flickered across Margaret’s face. She hurriedly opened the back door and slipped inside, as if afraid Evelyn might change her mind.

Just as they settled, Richard stormed out of the villa.

At the sight of him, Margaret’s expression darkened. "Evelyn, please—I can’t face him right now. Let’s just go."

Neither of them had the energy to deal with Richard tonight.

Evelyn turned to Alexander, their eyes locking in silent understanding. Without a word, he started the engine and pulled away from the curb.

By the time Richard stormed out, the car was long gone, leaving nothing but dust in its wake.

When he arrived at Hawthorne Estate, the grand entrance stood barred against him.

He waited. One minute. Two. No footsteps approached.

Jaw clenched, he punched in the security code.

Error.

Again.

Error.

A third attempt.

Access denied.

The password had been changed.

Richard ripped at his tie, his knuckles turning white as he hammered on the oak door.

Silence.

Rage burned through him. The staff wouldn’t dare defy him—not unless Margaret had given the order.

"Margaret!" His voice cracked like a whip. "This is my house! You think you can lock me out after humiliating me today?"

The door swung open.

Richard stepped forward, expecting his wife’s contrite face.

Instead, a bucket of pig’s blood splashed across his designer suit.

The putrid stench assaulted Richard's senses like a physical blow, forcing bile to rise in his throat.

He staggered back, swiping at his face with disgust, only to see Oliver grinning at him, the empty metal bucket still in his hands.

Before Richard could react, Oliver slammed the bucket down over his head with a loud clang.

"Special delivery!" Oliver crowed, stepping back to admire his handiwork. "Consider it a spiritual cleanse for that rotten karma of yours!"

The metallic echo inside the bucket drowned out Richard's furious curses.

Oliver folded his arms, thoroughly pleased with himself. "You're welcome, by the way."

From beneath the bucket, Richard's muffled threats only made Oliver laugh harder.

"Maybe next time you'll think twice before showing your face around here," Oliver called over his shoulder as he walked away, leaving Richard trapped in his stinking humiliation.

The afternoon sun gleamed mockingly off the overturned bucket as Richard struggled to free himself, his dignity left in tatters on the pavement.

###Chapter 340 Rude Awakening

The metallic clang echoed through the room as Richard sent the basin flying across the floor.

His pulse hammered in his ears. The ridiculous wig he’d been forced to wear tumbled off with the impact, landing in a tangled mess at his feet.

Fury burned through him.

"Oliver, I am your father! Is this the kind of respect your mother taught you?" Richard's voice was sharp, each word laced with barely contained rage.

Oliver squared his shoulders, defiance flashing in his eyes. "Lies! Mom’s not even here—she hasn’t been for days. This is all me!"

He jabbed a finger at Richard. "A real man controls himself. If you can’t do that, you’re no better than an animal."

News of the confrontation at the Hawthorne Estate spread like wildfire within the hour.

Humiliation scorched Richard’s skin. To be publicly berated by his own son—it was unbearable.

But Oliver wasn’t finished.

From somewhere behind him, he produced a plunger, brandishing it like a weapon. "Move it, old man. You’re turning this place into a haunted house just standing there."

He planted himself firmly in the doorway, blocking Richard’s path.

"What about your precious Vanessa? Or that mistress of yours?" Oliver sneered. "If you love them so much, why are you here?"

The words struck like a whip.

Richard’s jaw clenched.

This wasn’t just defiance—it was war.

"I'm your father! This is my home! You think you can just throw me out?" Richard's face twisted in outrage, his voice trembling with disbelief.

"Your home?" Oliver scoffed, crossing his arms with deliberate nonchalance. "Didn't Grandfather divide this estate between Evelyn and me?"

He tilted his head, feigning deep thought. "Besides, the deed is in Evelyn's name now. So tell me, what claim do you really have?"

Richard's throat tightened. He had miscalculated—revealed too much, too soon.

Done with the conversation, Oliver slammed the door shut with a resounding crash.

Meanwhile, in the dining room, Alexander meticulously cut his steak into bite-sized pieces, offering them to Evelyn.

Her lips curved into a soft smile as warmth bloomed in her chest. Playfully, she speared a piece and lifted it toward him.

Without hesitation, Alexander leaned in, accepting the morsel from her fork. Then, with affectionate familiarity, he brushed his nose against hers.

Margaret watched, stunned. The intimacy between them was unexpected—yet undeniably genuine.

A strange mix of shock and relief settled over her.

She had doubted this marriage from the start, especially knowing Evelyn had spent seven relentless years chasing after Ethan.

Margaret had always assumed Alexander was merely a consolation prize—a second choice.

But now, witnessing the tenderness between them, she wasn't so sure.

The revelation hit Margaret like a tidal wave.

All these years, she'd believed Evelyn had married Alexander out of spite toward Ethan.

But the scene unfolding before her made Margaret question everything.

As the dinner plates were cleared, Margaret found her voice.

"Evelyn, darling," she said, gripping her daughter's hand. "This injustice won't stand. I'll make certain you get what's rightfully yours."

Evelyn's lips curved into a sardonic smile. "And how exactly do you propose to do that, Mother?"

Margaret's eyes hardened like diamonds. "I'm divorcing Richard! Horizon Enterprises wouldn't exist without my family's investments. If that bastard thinks he can treat us this way, he's about to learn a brutal lesson."

The implications were staggering - asset division would send shockwaves through Horizon's boardrooms.

Margaret had hesitated at first, but the image of Richard's betrayal burned through her doubts.

Her thoughts turned venomous. "Why should I endure this humiliation? Richard and Evelyn Sinclair plotted to switch babies, forcing me to raise their bastard. What kind of monster does that?"

Her voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Every cent he spent on that woman came from our joint accounts. I'll hire the fiercest lawyers to claw back every penny!"

She turned her gaze toward Vanessa. "And those shares I so generously gifted her? They'll be returned - with interest."

The dining room seemed to hold its breath as Margaret's declaration hung in the air.

Evelyn watched her mother with new respect, realizing the sleeping lioness had finally awakened.

The game had changed.

And Richard Hayes would soon discover just how badly he'd miscalculated.

The words hung in the air like a blade poised to fall.

Eleanor's grip on her teacup tightened, her knuckles turning white. The delicate porcelain trembled slightly, betraying the storm beneath her composed exterior.

Vanessa stood frozen, her breath catching in her throat. The accusation was a slap—one she hadn't seen coming.

Ethan Caldwell's expression darkened, his jaw clenching. He had always been a man who thrived on control, but this—this was slipping through his fingers.

"You've raised her for years," Evelyn Carter said quietly, her voice steady despite the tension thickening the room. "Are you truly willing to throw that all away?"

The silence that followed was suffocating.

Vanessa's mind raced. Every memory, every calculated move—had it all been for nothing?

Across the room, Alexander Whitmore watched, his gaze unreadable. He had seen this coming long before anyone else.

Eleanor finally set her cup down with a soft clink.

The sound was deafening.

Vanessa swallowed hard.

This wasn't just a question.

It was a reckoning.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance After the Fall (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 341 Blood for Blood

Evelyn froze at Margaret's question, a cold wave of dread washing over her. "Margaret, are you still holding this against me for caring about Vanessa?"

Her voice trembled slightly. "You've never been a mother, so you can't possibly understand. I raised her from infancy, loved her as if she were my own flesh and blood."

"It's like losing a beloved pet—only worse, because she wasn't just an animal. She was a person I cherished with my whole heart."

A bitter realization settled in. "Now I see it clearly. Everything that should have been yours was stolen by her and that woman."

"And Vanessa? She played us all, pretending to be sweet and innocent while living off my affection and resources."

Margaret fell silent, the truth of Evelyn's words cutting deep.

The revelation that Vanessa's love had been nothing but an act left Evelyn feeling hollow, as if the ground had been pulled from beneath her.

After dinner, they prepared to escort Margaret home.

As they reached the doorway, Alexander stepped out to bring the car around.

Night had fully descended, the wind sharp and relentless, carrying both a chill and an unsettling energy.

It felt surreal that only two weeks ago, life had been perfectly ordinary.

The Caldwell family reunion was in full swing at Whitmore Manor, and with so many relatives gathered under one roof, tension was inevitable.

A freezing droplet splashed onto Evelyn's forehead, making her flinch.

"That's odd," Evelyn murmured, brushing her fingers across her skin. "It's not raining."

Before she could react, another icy trickle slid down her neck, sending a violent shiver through her.

She wiped her collar, frowning as she tilted her head back to search for the source.

"Evelyn, move!"

Margaret's scream cut through the air as she lunged forward, shoving Evelyn out of the way.

Evelyn staggered, barely catching herself before a massive block of ice shattered against the pavement where she had just stood.

The frozen chunk had fallen from at least six stories up, exploding into deadly shards on impact.

Had Margaret been even a second slower—

Evelyn's blood turned to ice. A cold sweat slicked her spine.

Margaret trembled beside her, her pulse hammering visibly at her throat.

The warning signs flashed in Evelyn's mind mere seconds before disaster struck.

Alexander moved like lightning, his face tight with concern. "What happened?"

His grip on Evelyn's shoulder was firm, his voice laced with urgency.

The shattered ice scattered across the pavement told the story before words could.

"Both of you—get in the car. Now," Alexander commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn didn't hesitate, ushering Margaret into the backseat.

Alexander lingered, his sharp gaze locked onto the broken shards. Suspicion darkened his expression.

Winter made ice inevitable—but not here. Not in the heart of the city, outside an elite restaurant. Places like this had protocols. Staff to prevent accidents.

This wasn’t an accident.

And the ice itself…

Alexander crouched, examining the fragments. Natural icicles tapered to a point. These didn’t. Even shattered, the edges bore marks of deliberate shaping.

He clenched an unlit cigarette between his teeth, biting down hard as he flicked his lighter open. The flame sparked, casting shadows across his hardened features.

The night air was thick with tension as Alexander stepped outside. His sharp gaze traveled upward, scanning the towering structure before him.

The mixed-use building loomed over twenty stories high, its darkened windows reflecting the dim city lights. Then he saw them—a pair of piercing eyes watching him from above.

On the fifth floor, a man leaned against the corridor wall, the glow of his cigarette casting eerie shadows. Unlike Alexander's refined presence, this man radiated raw, unpolished aggression.

The dim lighting masked his features, but his arrogance was unmistakable. Even from a distance, the challenge in his stance was clear.

Alexander crushed his cigarette beneath his polished shoe, exhaling a slow stream of smoke. Without hesitation, he loosened his tie and sprinted up the stairs, his movements swift and precise.

The man above barely had time to react.

No matter how fast Alexander was, scaling five flights in seconds defied logic.

But the stranger was already gone, slipping through another exit. When Alexander reached the spot, all that remained were scattered cigarette butts and a message scrawled in the damp concrete:

[Blood for blood.]

The words dripped with defiance, a promise of vengeance yet to come.

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After Prison (Evelyn)

###Chapter 342 Burden

The moment Alexander stepped back into the car, Evelyn noticed the storm brewing in his eyes. His jaw was clenched tight, his shoulders rigid with tension.

"What happened?" she asked, her fingers tightening around the steering wheel. "Where did you go?"

"Nothing to worry about," Alexander replied curtly, slamming the door shut. The sound echoed in the sudden silence. "I’m assigning extra security to you. Just a precaution."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

In the backseat, Margaret leaned forward, her voice sharp with concern. "Alexander, is there a threat?"

It had only been a week since Evelyn’s abduction. The memory still sent icy fingers crawling down her spine. She had just learned the kidnappers had used explosives—something she hadn’t even realized at the time.

Alexander fastened his seatbelt with a quick, practiced motion. "An old mission from my academy days might have resurfaced. Better safe than sorry."

He didn’t elaborate, but Evelyn understood. Classified. Off-limits.

Her mind raced. Wait… operatives use aliases to protect their identities.

If they know who he really is…

A cold realization settled in her chest.

This wasn’t just a precaution.

It was a warning.

"The weight."

"The weight?" Alexander's brow furrowed. "What do you mean?"

It hit him then—how often had Evelyn been pulled into danger because of him? The realization darkened his features.

They knew exactly where to strike.

His enemies had identified his weakness, which was why they kept targeting Evelyn.

This had gone too far.

As the car rolled past a neon-lit pharmacy, Margaret suddenly spoke. "You can drop me here. I ate too much at dinner—need to walk it off. I'll catch a cab later."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed slightly.

Too much? She barely touched her plate.

The moment the car stopped, Margaret pushed the door open—but as she stepped onto the curb, her ankle gave a sharp wobble.

Evelyn caught the stumble in the rearview mirror, her gaze snapping to Margaret's feet.

"Did you hurt yourself back there?"

Earlier, when the ice shattered, Margaret had acted on pure instinct—shoving Evelyn to safety without a second thought for herself.

I had intended to purchase some pain relief cream and recover at home, but the moment I stepped outside, the throbbing in my ankle became impossible to ignore.

Margaret responded with an embarrassed smile, "It's really nothing. A few days of rest should do the trick."

Evelyn shook her head disapprovingly before settling back into the luxurious leather seat.

As the car door clicked shut, a crushing wave of disappointment washed over Margaret.

Just as she turned away, the tinted window descended with a quiet hum.

Evelyn leaned out, resting her chin on folded arms. "Why are you still standing there like a statue? Get in already!"

Margaret's eyes widened in shock as she turned to meet her daughter's gaze. Her voice quivered, "Evelyn..."

With a thoughtful tilt of her head, Evelyn addressed Alexander. "Mr. Whitmore, would you mind taking my mother to the medical center? She needs proper examination."

Alexander gave an immediate nod of agreement.

Margaret stood frozen, her pulse racing with a confusing mix of astonishment and overwhelming joy.

Her thoughts tumbled wildly: "Is Evelyn actually... concerned about me? She's insisting on accompanying me personally? And did she just call me... Mother?"

Evelyn Carter refused to let her tears fall in front of Margaret Hayes.

Her heart swelled with emotion as she thought, "My precious girl still shows me kindness after all my mistakes."

The biting winter air couldn't penetrate the cocoon of warmth inside the car.

Hot air whispered against Margaret's face from the vents, stirring emotions she'd long suppressed.

When she reached up to brush away an imaginary speck, her fingers came away wet.

The tears had come without warning, tracing silent paths down her weathered cheeks.

The dashboard lights cast a soft glow, illuminating the quiet intimacy of this unexpected moment between mother and daughter.

Margaret turned her face toward the window, watching streetlights blur through her unshed tears.

Each passing light seemed to highlight another regret, another missed opportunity in their fractured relationship.

Yet here Evelyn sat beside her, offering silent comfort in the steady rhythm of her breathing.

The hum of the engine filled the space between them, a neutral soundtrack to their complicated history.

Margaret discreetly wiped her palms against her coat, surprised by the intensity of her emotions.

She'd built walls around her heart for so long, she'd forgotten what it felt like when they crumbled.

The scent of Evelyn's vanilla perfume mixed with the leather seats, creating a strangely comforting aroma.

Outside, snow began to fall - delicate flakes that melted instantly against the warm windshield.

Like her tears, Margaret thought. Brief but undeniable evidence of feelings she could no longer suppress.

Her chest tightened with a mixture of sorrow and something dangerously close to hope.

For the first time in years, she allowed herself to imagine reconciliation.

The possibility hovered between them, fragile as the winter night outside their moving sanctuary.

Evelyn's quiet strength filled the car as surely as the heater's warmth.

Margaret let out a shuddering breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding.

The weight of her daughter's forgiveness settled around her shoulders - heavy, but not unbearable.

Not when carried together.

###Chapter 343 Richard’s Predicament

The third day of Richard’s stay at the hotel coincided with the holiday.

Trapped in Cresthaven with no way to return home, he had no choice but to remain in his temporary refuge.

News of the incident at Olivia’s residence had exploded across the city. Everywhere he went, hushed whispers and pointed fingers followed him.

And it wasn’t just Cresthaven—the online storm was relentless.

Someone had recorded the entire confrontation and uploaded it for the world to witness.

In this era, public scandals involving affairs weren’t uncommon. But when it involved one of Cresthaven’s elite families, the gossip took on a life of its own, rapidly climbing the trending charts.

Netizens dug deeper, unearthing the twisted truth about the swapped daughters. The weight of it pressed against Richard’s temples, a dull ache forming.

Online, faceless critics tore into him with venomous words, each comment a fresh wound that made him question his own worth.

Richard clenched his fists. What does any of this have to do with me?

The backlash was suffocating.

He had never imagined that Evelyn’s past would resurface like this, dragging him into the eye of the storm.

His phone buzzed incessantly—messages from associates, distant relatives, even old acquaintances who hadn’t spoken to him in years.

All of them wanted answers.

None of them cared about the truth.

Richard exhaled sharply, tossing his phone onto the bed.

The walls of the hotel room felt like they were closing in.

He needed air.

Stepping out into the hallway, he immediately regretted it.

A group of guests nearby froze mid-conversation, their eyes darting toward him before they quickly averted their gazes.

The whispers started again.

Richard turned on his heel and retreated back inside, slamming the door behind him.

His reputation was in ruins.

And there was nothing he could do to stop it.

The accusations kept pouring in.

"Heartless monster!"

"How could any father treat his own daughter like this?"

The online mob dragged his family name through the dirt, as if generations of Hayeses were to blame for his current disgrace.

The worst part?

The news outlets claimed the footage was "blurred," but anyone who knew Richard Hayes could instantly recognize him on screen.

His phone wouldn’t stop ringing.

Relatives from the Hayes family bombarded him with calls, demanding explanations.

Even Evelyn Sinclair reached out, sobbing about her flower shop being vandalized.

At first, Richard refused to engage.

This entire mess was her fault to begin with.

Yet somehow, he was the one bearing the brunt of the public’s fury.

But then he remembered—the flower shop was his investment.

Gritting his teeth, he sent someone to assess the damage.

To his shock, it wasn’t Margaret’s doing.

Just a swarm of overzealous internet vigilantes.

They even filmed themselves trashing the place, posting it online like some twisted victory lap.

Evelyn’s boutique catered to elite clientele.

The damages? Over a million dollars.

Richard had no choice but to swallow the loss.

Three days had passed.

Surely, Margaret’s anger had cooled by now.

He checked out of the hotel early, determined to return home.

But when he arrived, his blood ran cold.

The front door wasn’t just locked—it bore a custom sign:

[Richard & Dogs: STAY OUT.]

Oliver’s handiwork.

The sign was embedded so deeply into the doorframe that removing it would require demolition.

Richard’s jaw clenched.

He knocked sharply.

"Take that damn sign down!"

Oliver’s mocking voice rang out from inside.

"Still thirsty for blood, Richard? Should I bring you a bowl? I’ve got plenty to spare."

Richard forced his voice steady.

"It’s the festival today. Families should be together. Just open the door."

A bitter laugh echoed back.

"Oh? Don’t you have another family to celebrate with?"

The morning sun cast long shadows as Richard Hayes stood at the doorstep of Hawthorne Estate, his pride in tatters.

"I've ended things with Evelyn Sinclair," he declared, desperation creeping into his voice. "I haven't spoken to her in weeks. My heart has always belonged to your mother. Just let me see her—if I need to apologize, shouldn't I do it properly?"

Oliver Hayes scoffed, his arms crossed. "Get out of here. Go wherever the hell you want."

Under any other circumstances, Richard would never tolerate such disrespect.

But today was different.

Earlier, he had discovered his accounts were frozen, forcing him to rely on his chauffeur’s card just to pay for his hotel stay.

His patience snapped. "Open this damn door! I need to speak to Margaret!"

Then—

The door swung open.

Margaret stood there, gripping a handful of coffee beans. Without hesitation, she flung them straight into Richard’s face.

The bitter grounds scattered across his suit, sticking to his skin like accusations.

His breath hitched.

She didn’t say a word.

She didn’t need to.

The door slammed shut again, leaving him standing there—humiliated, broke, and utterly alone.

###Chapter 344 A Thousand

Richard forced a tight smile, struggling to maintain his composure. "Darling, you've already drenched me. Can we call it even now?"

His fingers brushed against Margaret's wrist, seeking any sign of forgiveness.

Margaret's eyes burned with fury, her glare sharp enough to cut glass.

Seizing the opportunity, Richard stepped inside the room. "I've reflected on everything. I was wrong—completely blinded by Evelyn. I had no idea about the baby swap back then. If I'd known, I would have stopped her immediately."

Silence. Then—

Wham.

Margaret shoved the divorce papers against his chest.

"I don't care about your mess with Evelyn. We're dividing the assets. Just sign."

Richard's jaw dropped. "Divorce? Have you lost your mind?"

His thoughts raced. Divorce means restructuring Horizon Enterprises. The financial fallout would be disastrous.

"Yes, I've lost it," Margaret hissed. "Every time I think about what Evelyn suffered because of you, I lose it. You owe us, Richard. You've owed us for years. The fact that I'm not leaving you penniless is mercy. Sign, or walk away with nothing."

Richard Hayes stared at his empty bank account, panic rising in his chest.

With no options left, he dialed Vanessa Hart’s number.

The Whitmore Manor buzzed with activity as the family prepared for their holiday feast.

Vanessa paced the grand hallway, her stomach in knots at the thought of facing Ethan Caldwell later.

When her phone rang, she barely glanced at the caller ID before answering.

"Dad," she said dismissively, "why don’t you just stay with Mom for a while?"

"Absolutely not!" Richard hissed. "Going to Evelyn’s place now would be suicide!"

His mind raced.

After Evelyn Sinclair’s boutique had been vandalized, her address had been plastered all over social media.

If he showed up there, it would only make things worse.

And Margaret Hayes? She’d lose her mind if she found out he was hiding at Evelyn’s.

No, the smartest move was to cut ties with Evelyn completely.

Maybe then Margaret would soften.

Women were sentimental creatures—he knew that much.

Margaret came from old money, something Evelyn could never touch.

Richard wasn’t stupid.

Divorcing Margaret was out of the question, especially with the mountain of debt looming over him.

The financial repercussions would be catastrophic.

"Vanessa, could you wire me some funds? I'll just stay at a hotel for a few nights," Richard said.

Vanessa was stunned. She hadn't anticipated her father would ever ask her for money.

But since he had, she couldn't say no.

After ending the call, Vanessa swiftly transferred the amount to Richard's account.

[Dear Customer, your account has received a transfer of 1000 dollars from Vanessa Hart. Current balance: 1048 dollars.]

Richard blinked in disbelief.

The icy wind howled around him, nearly dislodging his wig.

He thought bitterly, I used to gift Vanessa millions during holidays, and now my own daughter can only scrape together a pitiful thousand?

What kind of joke is this?

This won't even cover the hotel charges I put on that driver's card earlier.

Fuming, he dialed Vanessa again.

"Dad, didn't the transfer go through?" Vanessa asked, confused.

The notification pinged on Richard's phone.

His fingers trembled as he stared at the amount.

"Vanessa," his voice was tight, strained. "Why is it only a thousand? Did you misplace the decimal point?"

For a man of his stature, a thousand dollars wouldn’t cover the valet parking at the places he frequented.

Vanessa sighed through the line, irritation lacing her tone. "Dad, I’m not made of money. Between my expenses here and Mom draining my accounts yesterday—fine. I’ll send more."

Another notification.

Ten thousand.

The wind howled around him, biting through his coat as he stood motionless on the sidewalk.

Two weeks ago, he had wired thirty million without a second thought.

Now, the irony burned like acid in his throat.

All those years of bending over backward for her—his golden child—had turned him into a punchline.

His grip on the phone turned white-knuckled.

Somewhere in the back of his mind, Evelyn’s quiet voice whispered: I told you so.

But it was too late for regrets.

The damage was done.

###Chapter 345 The Confession

Two agonizing days of police interrogations finally yielded results—Damian Cross had altered his testimony.

He vehemently denied any involvement with Vanessa Hart, refusing to admit he had ever accepted money from her.

To Oliver Hayes' dismay, all the evidence he had meticulously gathered at the Hawthorne Estate had inexplicably disappeared.

Evelyn Carter propped her chin on her palm, staring absently out the window.

A thought flickered through her mind: If only Ethan Caldwell would step forward as a witness…

But if he discovered Vanessa had been conspiring with Damian, he wouldn’t remain passive.

Yet days had passed without a single word from him.

Perhaps, now that Vanessa’s pregnancy was secure, Ethan’s anger had softened.

They were still married, after all. Old emotions didn’t just vanish overnight.

Her thoughts drifting to the unborn child, Evelyn reached for her phone and dialed Claire Dawson.

“Claire, how’s the baby?”

Alexander Whitmore, fresh from the shower with a towel slung over his shoulder, froze mid-step.

His ears strained to catch the hushed conversation, but Evelyn was deliberately keeping her voice too low to decipher.

Alexander pushed open the bathroom door, stepping into the bedroom with damp hair.

Evelyn's eyes widened when she saw him. She quickly ended her call with Claire, flashing him a bright smile. "That was fast."

Something about her behavior set off alarm bells in his mind.

"I'm ready," he said, watching her carefully. "You should get moving too. We still have to leave for Whitmore Manor soon."

Nodding, Evelyn brushed past him toward the bathroom.

Alexander grabbed his phone and stepped out onto the balcony. The morning air was crisp as he dialed Lucas's number.

Three rings later, Lucas answered. His voice sounded hollow, drained of all emotion. "What do you want?"

"What's going on between you and Claire?" Alexander demanded.

The line went silent. On the other end, Lucas stared blankly at the freshly signed divorce papers on his desk.

He'd finally surrendered. Letting Claire go meant freeing himself from this torment.

"It's over," Lucas finally said through clenched teeth. "We're divorced."

Alexander's grip tightened around his phone. "You already got the certificate?"

"Not yet." Lucas exhaled sharply. "I'm picking it up this afternoon."

The morning sunlight suddenly felt too harsh. Alexander squinted against the glare, his mind racing. Something wasn't adding up. Evelyn's secretive call. Lucas's abrupt divorce. The timing was too coincidental.

A cold suspicion settled in his gut. Whatever was happening, they were clearly keeping him in the dark. And Alexander Whitmore didn't appreciate being left out of the loop.

Not when it concerned his wife.

Not when it involved his best friend.

And certainly not when the pieces refused to fit together properly.

He ended the call without another word, his jaw set in determination. One way or another, he would uncover the truth.

"Perhaps the child is still with her," Alexander murmured.

Lucas went completely still, then comprehension dawned. "Who are you referring to? Claire?"

Alexander exhaled. "Yes. I overheard Evelyn speaking with her on the phone."

Before he could finish his sentence, Lucas was already sprinting toward the door.

The sharp slam of the door reverberated through the phone line, and Alexander sighed, shaking his head.

"Thank you, Alexander," Lucas called back breathlessly, still gripping his phone.

"Of course," Alexander replied, well aware he was inviting Evelyn’s fury by revealing this.

But Lucas had been drowning in despair for weeks. Someone had to throw him a lifeline.

The moment the call ended, Lucas sped toward Claire’s apartment. Meanwhile, Alexander stared at his darkened phone screen, fingers tightening around it. A prickle of unease crawled up his spine.

Just then, Evelyn stepped out of the bathroom, skin glowing from her shower, her damp hair curling at the ends.

Their eyes met.

A flicker of guilt crossed Alexander’s face before he quickly averted his gaze.

Evelyn, blissfully unaware, hummed as she reached for her towel.

The soft rustle of fabric filled the dressing room as Evelyn adjusted the final touches of her outfit. Just as she smoothed the last wrinkle, strong arms encircled her waist from behind, pulling her into a familiar warmth.

"Hey, love," Alexander murmured, his lips grazing the shell of her ear before pressing a tender kiss to her hair.

The unexpected affection sent a shiver down Evelyn's spine, but she steadied herself, turning slightly in his embrace. "What's on your mind?"

Alexander hesitated, his fingers tracing idle patterns along her arm. "There's something I need to tell you."

"Oh?" Evelyn arched a brow, curiosity flickering in her gaze.

"I overheard your conversation with Claire."

Evelyn froze, her breath hitching for the briefest moment before she forced herself to speak. "What exactly did you hear?"

Alexander exhaled slowly, his grip tightening just slightly. "I called Lucas."

The words hit her like a physical blow. Her carefully maintained composure shattered. "You told him?"

The air between them grew heavy, thick with unspoken implications. Evelyn's pulse raced, her mind scrambling to process what this meant—for her, for them, for everything.

Alexander's expression was unreadable, but the tension in his jaw betrayed his own unease. "I had to."

Evelyn swallowed hard, her fingers curling into fists at her sides. The weight of his confession settled over her, and for the first time in a long while, she felt the ground shift beneath her feet.

The silence stretched, charged with anticipation.

What came next would change everything.

###Chapter 346 Inner Turmoil

Alexander nodded earnestly, his gaze unwavering.

Evelyn hesitated for a brief moment before speaking. "Alexander, you didn’t have to tell me this."

Had he chosen to keep it to himself, she would never have known.

"I couldn’t lie to you," Alexander murmured, his voice softening.

Telling Lucas had been about loyalty—but confessing to Evelyn? That was about trust. About them.

He didn’t regret his choice.

Seeing the raw honesty in his expression, the faint shadow of remorse in his eyes, Evelyn felt her resistance crumble.

She slipped her arms around his waist, pressing her cheek against his chest. "You..."

How could she stay angry when he looked at her like that?

Besides, Claire had already decided to stay. Eventually, her pregnancy would become obvious. Lucas would find out one way or another.

Meanwhile, at Whitmore Manor, Vanessa stood on the balcony.

As Ethan’s car rolled up the driveway, her fingers curled into fists.

The sun filtered through the sheer curtains of Whitmore Manor, casting delicate patterns across the floor. Vanessa had been confined here for over ten days under Eleanor’s watchful care. Though her pregnancy had stabilized, her mind was anything but calm.

Ethan’s stance on the baby remained a mystery. He hadn’t barged into the manor yet—likely out of deference to Eleanor.

A shudder ran through her as she recalled that harrowing morning.

Armed guards had stormed into her hospital room, their grips like iron as they dragged her toward the operating table. The doctor had already prepped the instruments, cold and clinical under the sterile lights.

Richard and Margaret had rushed in, desperate, but the guards ignored them entirely. Vanessa had been shoved onto the gurney, helpless.

She never thought Ethan could be so merciless.

The idea of losing his own child didn’t even make him hesitate.

He hadn’t even bothered to show his face—just sent his men to do his dirty work.

If not for Eleanor’s timely intervention, she would have lost everything.

Now, she was hidden away in Whitmore Manor, isolated for half a month.

Ethan hadn’t come. Not once.

Vanessa had picked up her phone countless times, fingers hovering over his contact, but she always stopped herself.

Eleanor had warned her to stay composed. "He needs time," she’d said.

But how much longer could she wait?

Vanessa had given in against her better judgment.

It was a family holiday, and the Caldwells had an unbreakable rule—every member was expected to gather at the manor for festivities.

A knot of unease twisted in Vanessa’s stomach.

She was going to see Ethan again.

Though he hadn’t reached out in the past ten days, she knew it was only because she’d been secluded at the Hawthorne Estate.

When the sound of footsteps echoed from the grand staircase, Vanessa immediately retreated from the window and sank back onto the bed, pressing a hand to her forehead as if weakened by a sudden spell of dizziness.

But the minutes stretched.

After what felt like an eternity, Ethan still hadn’t appeared.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. She cracked her eyes open, glancing at the maid stationed nearby. "Go see what’s happening. Why hasn’t Ethan come up yet?"

The maid dipped into a quick curtsy before slipping out. She returned moments later, her voice hushed.

"Mr. Caldwell is in the study playing chess with Sir Harold. He said he won’t be joining you."

Vanessa’s fingers curled into the silk sheets, a sharp sting of rejection piercing through her.

"I see," she murmured, barely audible.

The game dragged on through the morning, the ticking of the clock mocking her growing frustration.

Ethan had erased her from his mind entirely—his own wife.

Vanessa's heart was a battlefield of contradictions. Part of her longed for Ethan to acknowledge her presence, while another part recoiled at the thought of facing him.

The war inside her was relentless, impossible to escape.

When lunchtime arrived, a maid appeared to guide her downstairs.

Normally, Vanessa would tread carefully in Whitmore Manor, every step measured.

But now, with her pregnancy, even the staff treated her with newfound reverence. Eleanor hadn’t issued a single command since her arrival.

Vanessa savored this shift in power. It solidified her belief that once the baby was born, her position would be unshakable.

This only fueled her determination to protect the child growing inside her—no matter the cost.

Secret Longing: A Love Reclaimed After Darkness (Evelyn)

###Chapter 347 Starting Your Own Business?

The moment Vanessa stepped into the hallway, her eyes locked onto Ethan emerging from his study.

Her bedroom was strategically placed near the grand staircase, ensuring he couldn’t avoid seeing her.

Ethan was deep in conversation with Harold, their voices low as they debated the outcome of their latest chess match.

"Ethan..." Vanessa called out softly, but he didn’t react, his attention fully absorbed by their discussion.

Her fingers curled into tight fists, nails biting into her palms. She hesitated to call again, afraid of irritating him further.

It was Harold who noticed her first. "Your wife is waiting for you," he murmured, nudging Ethan subtly.

Ethan finally glanced in her direction, but his gaze slid past her face as if she were invisible.

"Grandfather, let me assist you," Ethan said smoothly, brushing past Vanessa without so much as a pause.

The brief contact made her lips press into a thin line, swallowing back the frustration bubbling in her chest. She trailed behind them, her steps measured as they descended the stairs.

Harold turned slightly toward Ethan as they walked. "I’ve been reviewing your proposal," he began, his tone thoughtful.

Vanessa lingered a step behind, unnoticed, her heart heavy with unspoken words.

He was talking about Ethan Caldwell's sudden departure from Titan Capital Group, a scandal that had dominated financial headlines for weeks.

Vanessa Hart had caught snippets of the gossip, shocked that Ethan would walk away from such an influential corporation.

The Caldwell dynasty controlled numerous enterprises, but Titan Capital was their golden goose.

Its quarterly profits alone surpassed their other holdings combined.

Abandoning that throne of power seemed utterly reckless to her.

"Why not swallow your pride and ask your Uncle Alexander for reinstatement?" Harold Caldwell teased with an amused smirk.

Vanessa nearly nodded in agreement. In high finance, bruised egos healed quickly.

Today's bitter rivals often became tomorrow's business partners.

Besides, Ethan and Alexander weren't enemies—they were blood.

For Ethan, a simple apology to his elder could reopen Titan Capital's doors. The math seemed obvious.

But before Vanessa could speak, Ethan responded icily, "No need, Grandfather. If my proposed venture shows potential, why shouldn't I pursue it?"

Harold Whitmore's eyebrows shot up in surprise.

Ethan nodded, a confident gleam in his eyes. "Yeah, I've already set things in motion."

In truth, Ethan was downplaying his progress. His plans were far more advanced than he let on.

But he preferred to keep things under wraps until every detail was finalized.

Harold chuckled, his weathered face breaking into a rare smile. "Well, this is unexpected! You're moving faster—and smarter—than your reckless father ever did. I had no idea you were so ambitious."

"Thank you, Grandfather," Ethan replied, warmth spreading through his chest at the rare praise.

Harold had built the Whitmore empire from nothing, transforming it into Cresthaven's most powerful family in mere decades.

His sharp business instincts were legendary.

If he saw potential in a venture, it was almost guaranteed to succeed.

Still, Harold's expression turned serious. "But entrepreneurship isn't without risks. There are traps everywhere. You're still inexperienced—don't let your guard down."

Ethan met his grandfather's gaze steadily. "I understand. I'll be cautious."

As their conversation continued, they made their way to the dining table and took their seats.

Vanessa pressed her lips together, feeling completely erased from existence.

It was like she had become a silent shadow, following them without a voice of her own.

The pain in her chest grew heavier when she realized even Harold, who typically steered clear of family conflicts, knew about Ethan's business plans.

And there she stood—his wife—the last to know.

The irony stung like salt in an open wound.

She watched as Ethan and Harold exchanged knowing glances, their conversation flowing effortlessly while she remained on the outskirts.

Vanessa clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.

How had it come to this?

She was supposed to be his partner, his confidante.

Yet here she was, an afterthought in her own marriage.

The laughter around her sounded distant, muffled, as if she were underwater.

Her throat tightened, but she swallowed the lump forming there.

She wouldn't give them the satisfaction of seeing her break.

Not again.

Not ever.

Vanessa straightened her shoulders and forced a smile, though it felt brittle on her lips.

If this was the game Ethan wanted to play, fine.

She'd play it better.

And this time, she'd make sure he was the one left in the dark.

###Chapter 348 The Unseen Divide

The Whitmore Manor was expansive enough to require two grand dining tables for their family gatherings.

As guests settled into their seats, Alexander and Evelyn made their entrance with impeccable timing, as was their custom.

The family appeared unfazed by their late arrival, treating it as commonplace.

The moment they stepped into the dining hall, relatives from various branches of the family rose to greet them, exchanging warm pleasantries and admiring glances.

But for Vanessa, the scene was unbearable.

Being relegated to the second table while Evelyn sat at the head table with Alexander cut deeper than she cared to acknowledge.

To add insult to injury, Grace chose that moment to assert her authority.

"Vanessa, why don't you take my seat? I need to speak with my brother privately," Grace suggested with feigned sweetness.

Vanessa cast a desperate glance toward Ethan, silently begging for his intervention.

The younger generation—Harold's grandchildren from his second and third sons—were mostly adolescents, either freshly stepping into adulthood or still navigating high school.

The air hummed with quiet tension as Vanessa reluctantly rose from her seat.

Grace's smile didn't reach her eyes as she gestured toward the now-vacant chair at the far end of the table.

Evelyn, seated beside Alexander, pretended not to notice the exchange, though the slight tightening of her fingers around her wine glass betrayed her awareness.

Ethan remained frustratingly silent, his attention seemingly absorbed by a conversation with his uncle.

Vanessa's chest constricted as she moved toward the less prestigious table, her pride in tatters.

The whispers that followed her were barely concealed, the pitying glances from distant cousins only amplifying her humiliation.

At the second table, the teenagers barely spared her a glance, engrossed in their own world of gossip and laughter.

Vanessa clenched her jaw, forcing herself to sit with rigid composure.

She wouldn't give them the satisfaction of seeing her break.

Not today.

Not ever.

Ethan Caldwell remained silent.

The quiet stretched between them, heavy and suffocating.

With a resigned sigh, Vanessa Hart settled among the younger cousins, forcing a smile she didn’t feel.

Ryan Fletcher soon joined them.

The moment he spotted Vanessa beside him, his expression twisted in distaste. He shifted away sharply, putting as much distance between them as possible.

Vanessa’s brows furrowed. What’s his problem?

Her thoughts churned. Ryan’s mother is Sir Harold’s adopted daughter, and she married out years ago. He’s practically an outsider here. And yet, he dares to look down on me?

Noticing her glare, Ryan smirked. “Got something to say?”

He lifted his hands in mock innocence. “Heard you’re expecting. Just keeping my distance, you know? Wouldn’t want to get dragged into any drama—especially since your husband and I have never seen eye to eye.”

With that, he reached over and tugged a bespectacled younger cousin into the seat between them. “Christopher, sit here.”

Christopher Aniston, Audrey Mills’ eldest son at eighteen, was deep in SAT prep with only months left before the exams.

Quiet and bookish, he didn’t resist when Ryan pulled him down, obediently filling the gap between them.

Vanessa instinctively glanced at Alexander. She thought, Will he really stay silent while Ryan is being so blatantly disrespectful?

To her surprise, Alexander didn’t react. He and Grace were engrossed in conversation, their heads tilted close, voices barely above a whisper. Vanessa couldn’t catch a single word.

Frustration coiled tight in her chest. Her fingers curled into fists beneath the table.

Grace had deliberately positioned herself between Alexander and Vanessa—because Alexander had texted her earlier, insisting he didn’t want to sit too close to Vanessa.

Grace might not know the full extent of their issues, but anyone with half a brain could see the tension between them. Alexander hadn’t stepped foot in Hawthorne Estate for days.

Grace had always looked down on Vanessa.

She was convinced that ever since her brother married Vanessa, his reputation had begun to tarnish. His once-unshakable influence was fading.

Grace believed Vanessa was nothing but bad luck, dragging Alexander down from his rightful place at the top.

Her gaze flicked to Vanessa’s stomach. Bro, I fully support you filing for divorce. Mom must be losing her mind to be swayed by something as trivial as a pregnancy.

She smirked inwardly. In a family like ours, if Alexander wanted, he could have an entire line of women begging to bear his heir.

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After Prison (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 349 The Unwelcome Toast

"Looking at her now, all I see is a conniving troublemaker. She doesn't even come close to Evelyn's elegance. And let's not forget—she's an illegitimate child."

Grace scoffed, her gaze flickering toward Evelyn, who sat gracefully at the adjacent table.

Evelyn was radiant in her cream-colored, double-breasted coat, the soft hue enhancing her luminous complexion.

Even Grace, barely in her twenties, couldn't suppress a pang of envy.

In elite circles, bloodlines mattered. Those born into privilege sneered at bastards.

Who wanted an unexpected sibling crashing into their lives?

If they shared a mother, it might be tolerable. But if not? A bitter war over inheritance was inevitable.

Grace pictured herself in Evelyn's place, itching to tear Vanessa apart. To her, Vanessa was utterly despicable.

Grace tilted her head. "Let's face it. Your heir would come from a bastard's womb. That hardly suits your reputation, does it?"

Ethan stayed silent, his indifference toward Vanessa palpable.

The golden chandelier cast a warm glow over the dining room, but Ethan Caldwell only had eyes for one person.

From his seat, he had a perfect view of Evelyn Carter’s delicate features.

Vanessa Hart’s scandalous origins had only recently come to light, thanks to the relentless gossip circulating online.

A sharp pang of worry twisted in Ethan’s chest—what if Evelyn was hurt by the rumors?

Just then, he noticed Alexander Whitmore’s hand slipping beneath the table, fingers intertwining with Evelyn’s.

A secret smile passed between them, intimate and knowing.

Ethan’s jaw tightened, his grip on his wine glass turning white-knuckled.

“Are you even paying attention?” Grace Caldwell elbowed him sharply, irritation lacing her voice.

His gaze remained locked on Evelyn, and Grace suppressed a frustrated sigh. He’s being so obvious. With half the room watching, he needs to be more careful.

The memory of New Year’s Eve flashed in her mind—Ethan, drunk and reckless, pulling Evelyn into a heated conversation in front of everyone. She couldn’t let that happen again.

But before she could intervene, Ethan abruptly stood, glass in hand, and strode toward Evelyn’s table.

“Uncle Alexander… Aunt Evelyn,” he said, the title tasting bitter on his tongue. His eyes never left her face. “A toast.”

Grace’s pulse spiked.

Across the table, Vanessa’s spoon clattered loudly against her plate.

The clink of crystal glasses resonated through the charged air.

Alexander arched a brow, studying Ethan with cool detachment.

Seizing the moment, Ethan nervously raised his glass, downing his drink in one swift motion before refilling it. His fingers trembled slightly against the stem.

"Aunt Evelyn," he began, turning toward her with a practiced smile, his gaze lingering just a second too long on her face.

But Alexander moved with effortless grace, intercepting the gesture. His hand slid between them, his voice smooth but firm. "Evelyn doesn’t handle alcohol well. I’ll take this one for her."

Without waiting for a response, he plucked the glass from Evelyn’s fingers, clinked it against Ethan’s, and took a deliberate sip.

Ethan’s jaw tightened, but he swallowed his protest.

Alexander was right—every eye in the room was watching. A single misstep would fuel the gossip mill for weeks.

Ethan wanted Evelyn. But he wasn’t foolish enough to challenge Alexander outright.

Pushing now would only humiliate him.

Forcing a smile, he moved on, making his rounds to toast the rest of the Whitmore family, ensuring no one was left out.

But Alexander saw right through the act.

Ethan wasn’t here for pleasantries.

He was here for her.

Alexander's piercing gaze cut through Ethan's carefully crafted facade. He wasn't about to let the man manipulate this moment to his advantage.

His fingers tightened imperceptibly around his wineglass as he assessed the situation. The tension in the air was thick enough to slice with a knife.

A quick glance at Evelyn beside him confirmed she remained composed, though he noticed the subtle tightening of her jaw. She had always been perceptive—too perceptive—when it came to Ethan's games.

Ethan raised his glass with practiced charm, his smile not quite reaching his cold eyes. "To new beginnings," he said smoothly, the toast dripping with double meaning.

Alexander didn't miss the way Ethan's gaze lingered on Evelyn a second too long.

He countered immediately, lifting his own glass with deliberate calm. "To clarity," he said, his voice low but carrying unmistakable warning. "May the truth always come to light."

The corner of Evelyn's mouth twitched. She recognized the challenge in his words.

Across the table, Vanessa watched the exchange with barely concealed interest, her nails tapping against her glass.

Nathan cleared his throat, attempting to diffuse the tension. "And to successful partnerships," he interjected hastily.

Alexander didn't break eye contact with Ethan as he took a slow sip, the unspoken battle raging beneath the surface.

Evelyn's hand found his under the table, her fingers intertwining with his in silent solidarity.

The game was far from over.

###Chapter 350 We Need to Talk

Evelyn blinked when Alexander suddenly locked eyes with her. "What is it?" she asked, tilting her head slightly.

"Nothing," he murmured, his lips curving into a soft smile as he reached out to tuck a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

After lunch, drowsiness crept over Evelyn, her eyelids growing heavy.

"Let's rest at Whitmore Manor before heading back," she suggested, stifling a yawn.

They had their own private quarters there—Alexander preferred solitude, choosing a separate wing away from the bustling household to ensure peace.

His arm slid around her waist, pulling her closer. "Give me a kiss, and I'll carry you upstairs."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "What?"

His voice carried easily, and with the rest of the Whitmore family lingering nearby after the meal, every word was heard.

A ripple of surprise passed through the room.

Harold Aniston coughed into his newspaper, suddenly engrossed in the headlines.

The others exchanged glances, momentarily speechless.

Audrey Mills nearly dropped her teacup, while Sophia Ellis pressed her lips together, fighting a smile.

Evelyn felt heat rise to her cheeks as Alexander smirked, clearly unbothered by their audience.

The air thickened with unspoken amusement—no one had ever seen this playful side of Alexander Whitmore before.

Gasps rippled through the crowd as Alexander swept Evelyn into his arms without warning.

His lips curved into a wicked smirk. "Even if you refuse to kiss me, darling, I’m still carrying you to our room."

Evelyn’s breath hitched, her pulse skyrocketing. "Alexander!"

"Hmm?"

"You absolute menace!"

Her face burned. The Whitmore Manor was overflowing today—grandparents, cousins, even a ten-year-old gaping at them from the buffet table. This was mortifying.

Alexander’s eyes gleamed with unrepentant amusement. "Guilty as charged. But I’m your menace."

And just like that, he strode past the stunned onlookers, cradling Evelyn as though the rest of the world had dissolved into static.

Ryan Fletcher elbowed Ethan Caldwell. "Since when does Uncle Alex have rizz?"

Ethan’s jaw tightened. "Ryan, for God’s sake—"

Post-lunch, the estate buzzed with scattered conversations and clinking porcelain.

Ethan shrugged on his jacket, heading for the door when Eleanor’s voice sliced through the chatter. "Leaving so soon?"

Not once since arriving at Whitmore Manor had Ethan acknowledged his mother’s existence.

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Ethan Caldwell's resentment toward Eleanor was palpable. She had pressured Vanessa Hart to keep the baby—a child he never wanted.

When Ethan had once begged to marry Vanessa, Eleanor had refused. Now that he wanted nothing to do with her, Eleanor was forcing Vanessa to stay.

"Ethan," Eleanor said, her voice laced with desperation, "everything I do is for your father. As the eldest son of Harold Aniston, he was exiled overseas, unable to even visit for holidays. But if you have a child, it gives him a reason to return. We could finally be a family again."

Ethan's icy gaze cut through her. "So you're asking me to sacrifice my life for your fantasy?"

Eleanor's face twisted in disbelief. "How is having a child a sacrifice? It's a blessing!"

His jaw tightened. "My heart belongs to Evelyn Carter."

Eleanor recoiled as if struck. "What did you just say?"

Her voice rose in horror. "Ethan, have you lost your mind? She's your Aunt Evelyn! What are you thinking? You'd abandon your own child for a woman you can never have?"

Ethan let out a bitter laugh, unwilling to waste another breath arguing.

There's no point explaining myself to someone who refuses to understand.

"I'll reclaim my woman when the time comes."

His words were final—Ethan wanted nothing more to do with Vanessa.

If Eleanor insisted on keeping the baby, he wouldn’t interfere.

But Ethan would never let his heart soften for Vanessa again, and his relationship with his mother would shatter beyond repair.

Eleanor, however, remained unshaken.

She was certain Ethan just needed time. Once that baby is born, she thought, who could resist those tiny fingers and that innocent smile calling them Daddy?

Ethan had just lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around him as he reached his car. Then—

Vanessa burst through the front door, sprinting after him.

"Ethan! We need to talk!"

Her voice cracked with desperation, but he didn’t even glance back.

The car door slammed shut.

The engine roared to life.

And just like that, he was gone—leaving her standing there, fists clenched, heart pounding.

She had gambled everything on this moment.

And lost.

Secret Longing: A Love Reborn from Shadows (Evelyn Carter) novel

###Chapter 351 Setting the Record Straight

Ethan Caldwell lifted his chin defiantly, his gaze deliberately avoiding hers. He took a slow drag from his cigarette, exhaling a thick plume of smoke that veiled his expression in a hazy shroud.

Vanessa Hart had expected nothing less from him.

Though they had shared lunch at the same table, not a single word had passed between them. With so many eyes around, she couldn’t risk drawing attention by confronting Ethan in public.

Her fingers curled protectively over her stomach as she stepped closer to the sleek black car.

"Ethan."

"Don’t touch me."

He rolled down the window just enough to rest his forearm on the ledge, flicking ash from his cigarette with deliberate indifference. His voice was laced with disdain. "Filthy."

Vanessa froze outside the car, caught in the tension between hesitation and indignation.

Filthy?

Her mind raced. Was he referring to the ash—or was he calling me filthy?

Her shoulders slumped slightly, an invisible weight pressing down on her chest.

Ethan smirked, as if he could hear every unspoken doubt swirling in her mind.

Vanessa staggered slightly, her vision blurring at the edges.

"Ethan…" Her teeth sank into her lower lip, her expression a mix of shock and devastation. "Is this because of the rumors? Because the whole world knows I'm illegitimate now? Do you think I'm beneath you?"

Lately, Cresthaven had been buzzing with whispers about her true parentage.

Anonymous messages flooded her phone, each one more vicious than the last.

Someone had leaked her number online, and the internet had turned into a battlefield of cruelty.

They called her a parasite, a stain on the Hayes name, stealing a life that wasn’t hers to claim.

Vanessa clenched her fists. What did I ever do to deserve this? I was just a child. I had no control over who my parents were.

Once, she had snapped back at one of the faceless trolls—only to be met with a wall of accusations, branding her as ungrateful for daring to defend herself.

She couldn’t shake the suspicion that Evelyn had orchestrated it all, paying people to push her until she cracked—until she lost everything, including the baby.

And now, Ethan’s words—dirty—felt like a knife twisting in the wound of her exposed past.

The scandal had exploded, and of course, he was suffering too. His reputation, his family name—everything was tangled in the mess of her existence.

But then, his expression shifted, his features smoothing into something colder. Detached.

The air between them turned to ice.

Vanessa braced herself.

This wasn’t just about the rumors anymore.

Something far worse was coming.

Ethan’s voice was deceptively calm as he spoke.

"I’ve met Damian."

Vanessa went rigid, her expression freezing for a heartbeat too long.

"Damian? Why would you ever meet that worthless gambler?"

Ethan let out a derisive laugh, stubbing out his cigarette.

He reached out, his fingers brushing lightly against her cheek.

"Didn’t realize you could be so cruel. You’d trash your first lover without hesitation?"

His words sent ice through Vanessa’s veins.

A cold sweat prickled down her spine, her feet suddenly unsteady.

"Ethan, what are you saying? I… I don’t understand."

His gaze locked onto hers, sharp and assessing, as if he were watching a poorly rehearsed play.

"Fine. If you’re confused, let me spell it out for you."

He crushed the cigarette underfoot, his eyes darkening.

"Vanessa, three years ago, you planned Evelyn’s kidnapping, didn’t you? Damian confessed. I heard it myself."

His next words struck like a blade.

"You slept with him. That was your first time, wasn’t it?"

The air between us grew thick with tension.

Ethan Caldwell's lips curled into a cruel smirk as his gaze raked over me.

"So it was all an act," he said, voice dripping with disdain. "You pretended to be pure, when in reality, you were already ruined."

My fingers curled into fists at my sides.

The accusation hung in the air like a blade poised to strike.

Vanessa Hart stood beside him, her eyes gleaming with malicious triumph.

"You must have been terrified we'd find out," she purred. "All this time, playing the victim while hiding your dirty little secret."

Alexander Whitmore stepped forward, his presence a shield between me and their venom.

"Enough," he growled.

But Ethan wasn't finished.

"Did you think we wouldn't discover the truth?" He laughed, the sound harsh and mocking. "Did you really believe you could fool everyone forever?"

The weight of their words pressed down on me, but I refused to crumble.

Because the truth they thought they knew wasn't the whole story.

And when the real secret came to light—

It would destroy them instead.

###Chapter 352 Hatred

Ethan Caldwell had always boasted about his ability to hold his liquor. But that night, after barely finishing half his drink, he blacked out—only to wake up tangled in the sheets of a hotel bed with Vanessa Hart.

She had tricked him into believing it was her first time, demanding he take responsibility.

Tears welled in Vanessa’s eyes as she clutched the sheets to her chest. "How can you trust him over me?" Her voice trembled with desperation. "Ethan, you’d rather believe Damian Cross than your own wife?"

Vanessa had already heard the news—Damian had been arrested.

Terrified he might expose her, she had paid a fortune to send him a message in prison, promising an even larger payout if he kept his mouth shut.

Damian had agreed. The money had been transferred.

But Vanessa never expected that Damian would meet Ethan before his arrest.

Her nails dug into her palms. Damn it. From the way Ethan’s talking… he knows everything. That backstabbing rat!

Ethan’s expression was glacial. "That’s right, Vanessa. I don’t trust you. You’re a pathological liar who’s deceived me one too many times. You’ve burned every shred of credibility you had with me." His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "So yes. I’d rather believe Damian."

Ethan's fingers tightened around the damp tissue he'd pulled from the car's console, scrubbing furiously as if he could erase the very memory of touching her.

"Not a single strand of Evelyn's hair holds less worth than you."

The window rolled up with a sharp hum, cutting off the sight of the woman he loathed. Vanessa felt the air leave her lungs, desperation clawing at her throat.

"Ethan!" Her voice cracked, raw with panic. "I'm carrying your child! You can't just—the baby has a heartbeat! I saw him on the ultrasound days ago. He has your nose, your eyes! The doctor confirmed it's a boy!"

Her nails dug into the leather seat as she pleaded. "Can't you soften, just for him? Let’s try—let’s be a family. We could make this work!"

Ethan's laugh was ice. "From the second you twisted my pity to frame Evelyn three years ago, whatever I felt for you turned to ash."

His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "God, Vanessa. If it weren’t for you, Evelyn would still be mine."

A sharp honk split the air as he slammed his palm down. "You should be in a cell. But you’ve always been clever—hiding behind my mother’s skirts. She wants this bastard you’re carrying."

His voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "You owe me. You owe Evelyn. Without my mother’s protection, do you think you’d still be breathing the air of Whitmore Manor? A woman like you doesn’t deserve to raise a Caldwell."

Vanessa's knees buckled beneath her. She clutched the car door for support, her fingers turning white from the pressure.

"You actually believe a child could chain me to you?" Ethan's laugh was ice-cold. "Vanessa, you've sorely misjudged me. When a man falls out of love, that's when his true cruelty surfaces."

His words slithered through the air like venom.

"Keep the baby if you insist. But don't expect a single ounce of paternal affection from me." His smirk was razor-sharp. "Need I remind you? We never signed a marriage certificate. That child will be born a bastard—just like its mother. Something to be ashamed of, something to hide."

Every syllable was a calculated strike to Vanessa's weakest points.

She had never imagined Ethan could be this merciless—willing to disown his own flesh and blood just to punish her.

The engine roared to life as he spun the wheel sharply. Tires screeched against pavement, leaving Vanessa collapsed on the cold asphalt, her body wracked with tremors.

"Evelyn!" The name tore from her throat like a curse.

Her vision blurred with unshed tears, but beneath the grief burned something far darker—a hatred so potent it threatened to consume her.

The truth was undeniable: Ethan rejected this child because his heart still belonged to Evelyn.

He wanted a family with her.

A twisted smile curled Vanessa's lips as realization dawned.

"So that's your game, Ethan? You still crave Evelyn?"

Her nails dug into her palms hard enough to draw blood.

"Fine. Let me help you with that."

The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the tangled sheets.

Evelyn stirred, her body pressed against Alexander's warmth. His arm draped possessively over her waist, pulling her closer even in sleep.

A bitter taste rose in her throat.

This was the moment Vanessa had warned her about.

"When you wake up in his arms, that's when you'll be truly beyond redemption."

The words echoed in her mind, sharp as broken glass.

Evelyn's fingers twitched against the pillow. She should pull away. She should leave before he woke.

But the weight of his embrace felt like chains she no longer wanted to break.

Outside, birds sang as if the world hadn't shifted on its axis.

Inside, Evelyn's heart pounded with the terrifying realization—she didn't want to escape.

Not anymore.

Not from him.

The hatred she'd nurtured for so long had melted like frost under morning sun, leaving something far more dangerous in its place.

A soft sigh escaped Alexander's lips as he nuzzled against her hair.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

This was surrender.

This was ruin.

This was the point of no return.

###Chapter 353 A Scheme

Vanessa was certain Evelyn would endure far worse suffering than she currently faced. She could almost see Evelyn trapped between Alexander and Ethan, mercilessly scorned by the Whitmore family.

A wicked idea sparked in her mind, twisting her lips into a smirk. She let out a sharp cry, deliberately loud enough to draw attention.

The garden staff rushed over in alarm. "Goodness! What happened? Why are you on the ground? Let me help you up!"

"I just slipped," Vanessa murmured, clutching the maid’s arm as she rose. The venom in her eyes melted into feigned distress. "I—I hope the baby is alright…"

The maid paled. She had been assigned by Eleanor Whitmore to watch over Vanessa, and she knew failure would cost her dearly.

Vanessa bit her lip. "Don’t tell Eleanor. Just go to the pharmacy and get me some prenatal supplements. Something mild."

"But I—I don’t know what those are…"

The maid fidgeted nervously. She wasn’t well-educated, barely able to read labels. But her diligence had earned her this position, and now she was terrified of making a mistake.

Vanessa exhaled sharply. "Then find someone who does. Quickly."

Her fingers curled into her palm. If this worked, Evelyn’s downfall would be inevitable.

Her left hand moved quickly across the paper, crafting the message with deliberate care.

She altered her usual handwriting style, making it unrecognizable. "Take these - they're the medications Dr. Wells prescribed during my hospital stay."

Eleanor eagerly nodded, tucking the folded note into her dress pocket before rushing out the door.

Evelyn awoke to an empty bedroom.

The memory of Alexander carrying her through Whitmore Manor in full view of the Caldwell family made her cheeks burn with humiliation.

"How will I ever look them in the eye again?" she wondered.

Alexander had been particularly... enthusiastic after lunch, his mood elevated by one too many glasses of wine.

Despite seeing her exhaustion, he'd pressed her into the mattress, covering every inch of her skin with heated kisses.

His morning shave had already given way to rough stubble that scraped deliciously against her sensitive flesh.

Worse still were his skilled hands kneading the tension from her lower back, coaxing her body to surrender completely.

When pleasure finally overtook her, Evelyn couldn't suppress the breathy cry that escaped her lips - a sound that now filled her with acute embarrassment.

The sheets still carried his masculine scent mixed with their shared passion.

She buried her face in the pillows, torn between lingering satisfaction and mortification.

Somewhere in the mansion, she could hear the distant murmur of voices - no doubt discussing the spectacle they'd witnessed earlier.

Evelyn sat up abruptly, wincing at the pleasant ache between her thighs.

She needed to regain some dignity before facing anyone.

A hot shower first. Then perhaps she'd...

Her thoughts scattered as the bedroom door creaked open.

Alexander stood framed in the doorway, his disheveled appearance suggesting he'd just come from his study.

Those stormy gray eyes darkened when they landed on her tousled state.

"Running away already, Mrs. Whitmore?"

The deep rumble of his voice sent fresh shivers down her spine.

Evelyn swallowed hard.

This man would be the death of her.

Whitmore Manor was nothing like their cozy little home. The grand estate buzzed with activity, and today, it was especially crowded.

Broad daylight made everything riskier.

Even though they had their own private wing, there was no guarantee someone wouldn’t wander through the gardens, bored enough to eavesdrop.

Evelyn whispered desperate pleas into Alexander’s ear, but he only chuckled, unfazed.

"The elders might suspect, but they’d never speak of it. The younger ones will just assume we’re… affectionate," Alexander murmured, his voice dripping with arrogant amusement.

She had never seen him so shameless.

Yet there he was, teasing her with slow, deliberate nips at her earlobe, unraveling her resistance until she was pliant in his arms.

Afterward, Evelyn noticed with faint irritation that Alexander’s shirt remained perfectly buttoned, not a single crease out of place.

What a devil in a tailored suit.

In retaliation, she slid her fingers beneath his crisp white collar, tracing the hard lines of his abdomen with deliberate slowness.

But Alexander wasn’t one to let a challenge go unanswered. What should have been a peaceful nap turned into another heated battle of wills—one that left Evelyn breathless and boneless against the sheets.

By the time he was done, her body ached deliciously, every muscle lax with exhaustion. She barely had the strength to curl into the pillows before sleep claimed her.

When Evelyn finally stirred awake, two precious hours had vanished, and Alexander's presence was conspicuously absent.

She blinked at the clock, shocked at how deeply she'd slept.

Her phone screen illuminated with a message from Alexander timestamped twenty minutes prior: [Hydration and soothing lozenges await on your bedside. Should your throat protest, indulge in both.]

Evelyn buried her flaming cheeks in her palms, the memory of earlier intimacies making her wish she could disappear into the Egyptian cotton sheets.

The glass of water proved perfectly tepid as she sipped, fingers flying across her screen: [Your current coordinates?]

[Horizon Enterprises headquarters. Transatlantic negotiations. Expect my return shortly. Remain at Whitmore Manor - consider it an order.]

Her lips curved involuntarily.

Rising, she let the shower's steam cleanse both body and lingering embarrassment. Fresh cashmere hugged her curves as twilight painted the windows charcoal.

A sudden concern pierced her contentment. "Claire's situation... Has Lucas made contact yet?"

The phone rang three times before Julian's smoky baritone answered.

"Where's Claire?" Evelyn's grip tightened on the device. Julian's continued interference was becoming... problematic.

The tension in the air was palpable.

Evelyn had been staying at Willowbrook Apartments with Claire Dawson lately, and the thought of Lucas Bennett showing up unexpectedly made her stomach twist.

One wrong move, and everything could spiral out of control.

Julian Mercer’s voice was barely above a whisper as his gaze swept the room. “She’s crying.”

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

Margaret Hayes’s eyes widened with worry. “Did Lucas say something to upset her?”

The silence that followed was heavy, thick with unspoken fears.

Evelyn clenched her fists, her mind racing.

If Lucas walked through that door now, she wasn’t sure she could keep her composure.

The last thing she needed was another confrontation.

Not when she was already barely holding herself together.

Julian exhaled softly, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn swallowed hard.

She needed a plan.

Fast.

Before everything fell apart.

###Chapter 354 Liberation

Julian's fingertips brushed lightly against the corner of his mouth.

The tender bruise still throbbed from Lucas's fist.

His mind swirled with unanswered questions.

Julian arranged fresh ingredients across the living room table, guiding Claire through each step.

The television hummed with late-night comedy, but their focus remained on the mixing bowls between them.

Claire curled comfortably on the sofa, her silk pajamas rustling as she tucked her legs beneath her.

Domestic tasks had never been her forte - cooking least of all.

She attempted to fold the batter before surrendering with a dramatic sigh.

"These are absolute perfection," she marveled, watching Julian pipe flawless swirls.

"How do you make everything look so effortless? I'd burn water if left unsupervised."

A flush crept up Julian's neck.

"Let me handle these things," he murmured. "Your only job is to enjoy them."

The oven timer chimed like a promise.

Julian Mercer gently bit his lower lip, his eyes lingering on Claire Dawson's face for several heartbeats, utterly mesmerized by her radiant smile.

When Claire caught him staring, Julian immediately looked away, pretending to focus on something else.

His pulse raced so violently he feared she might hear it.

Claire rested her chin on her palm, studying him with quiet amusement.

"Julian."

Her voice was soft but deliberate. "You do realize I'm pregnant, right? There's a new life growing inside me."

Julian stiffened, sensing the weight behind her words.

"I've been financing you—no, let's be precise, I've been supporting you—but only to irritate Lucas enough to make our divorce quick and painless."

She exhaled, her fingers tracing idle circles on the table. "This afternoon, I'm finalizing the divorce. Once it's done, I'll be free. And so will you."

Julian's breath hitched. "Claire, what are you saying? What do you mean I'll be free?"

"You've been staying here for weeks now. Some days, you're up before dawn just to make it to your university on time."

The life of a medical student was grueling, relentless.

Claire tilted her head, her gaze unwavering. "You don’t owe me anything, Julian. This arrangement was never about you. It was about him."

Julian clenched his fists. "But I—"

"You're free," she repeated, softer this time. "No more obligations. No more debts. Just… go live your life."

The silence between them stretched, heavy with unspoken words.

Julian swallowed hard.

Freedom had never felt so much like loss.

The breakfast was carefully arranged on the table, waiting for her to wake up and enjoy it.

Claire had noticed every single one of his thoughtful gestures.

She thought Julian was truly extraordinary. There was a vibrant energy about him, the kind only someone his age could radiate. Though he was three years younger than her, more often than not, it felt like he was the one looking after her.

At first, Claire hadn’t paid much attention to it. But over the past few days, she had started to sense something different in Julian’s gaze.

She had assumed their arrangement was purely transactional—mutual convenience with no strings attached. But now, she realized that in the three months they had lived together, Julian had developed genuine feelings for her.

Claire believed Julian deserved someone pure and untainted, not someone like her—divorced, carrying another man’s child, and tangled in a messy life.

“I’ll keep supporting you until you graduate. Your living expenses will still be transferred to your account on time. But starting tomorrow, you should move out.”

Julian froze, his expression blank, as if the words had struck him motionless.

“Claire.”

His voice was soft, hesitant.

“The stars at my university… aren’t they beautiful?”

A pause.

“Didn’t you say you loved watching them with me?”

Julian Mercer clearly had quite the reputation on campus. The moment they stepped onto the quad, several heads turned in his direction.

Claire Dawson wasn't surprised. With those striking features and that confident stride, of course he'd be popular among the college crowd. Julian carried himself with an effortless magnetism that drew eyes wherever he went.

A quiet thought nagged at her. "How does someone like him end up working at Eclipse Lounge to pay off family debts?" The contrast between his current poise and his past struggles didn't add up.

They sprawled across the manicured grass, watching stars blink into existence overhead. Claire fought to keep her eyes open, determined not to miss the meteor shower.

Then came the interruption.

A brunette with bold red lipstick sauntered over, zeroing in on Julian. "Julian Mercer," she purred, then flicked her gaze toward Claire. "Is this your sister?"

The question hung in the air like a challenge.

###Chapter 355 She's Mine

Julian Mercer gazed down at Claire Dawson resting on the grass, her eyes peacefully shut. His expression softened with undeniable tenderness.

With careful movements, he unwound the cashmere scarf from his own neck and draped it gently over her shoulders.

When he lifted his gaze to the approaching stranger, his eyes turned icy.

"No," he stated firmly, his voice leaving no room for argument. "She's with me."

The girl flushed, muttered an apology, and hurried away.

Claire hadn't been asleep. She'd felt the warmth of Julian's scarf settling over her, the brush of his fingers against her collarbone.

Her eyes fluttered open, a teasing smile playing on her lips. "Using me as a shield now?"

Julian pressed his lips together, a faint pink dusting his cheeks.

It was the first time Claire had ever seen him look flustered, and the sight sent a thrill through her.

Right then, she decided the hours spent shivering under the winter sky had been worth it.

When the first meteor blazed across the darkness, Claire nudged Julian's arm. "Make a wish," she whispered.

The medical school stood atop a secluded hill, far from the city's glow. Darkness enveloped them, broken only by the scattered light of distant stars.

A cool breeze whispered through the open field. Julian stood motionless, his hands pressed together, his gaze fixed on the heavens with quiet awe.

His lips parted slightly, voice barely above a murmur yet carrying clearly in the stillness. His eyes flickered toward Claire as he breathed a single word.

"Claire."

Though soft, the name hung in the crisp mountain air.

Claire hesitated, then smirked. "Should I be worried there's another Claire in your life?"

Julian remained silent for a heartbeat before shaking his head.

"My wish... is you."

The night was surprisingly mild for winter, the air fresh and invigorating.

Claire's pulse stuttered at his words.

After a long pause, she exhaled. "Your campus stars aren't as spectacular as I imagined." A beat. "But tonight wasn't wasted."

She hadn't anticipated Julian taking her casual remark so seriously.

Perhaps he'd misread her meaning entirely.

The words might have planted the wrong seed in his mind.

As her thoughts wandered, Claire's eyes flickered with mischief when they landed on Julian.

"Julian, you're 21, and I'm nearly 25. I'm four years older than you, and I'm keeping this baby."

She tilted her head, studying his reaction. "Do you realize what that means? I doubt you'd want to become a father in your early twenties."

His gaze dropped to her stomach, unwavering. "How do you know I don’t?" His voice was steady, firm. "Claire, that’s my child. I’m its father."

At that exact moment, the electronic lock on Claire’s front door beeped.

Lucas had cracked the code.

The first thing he heard as he stepped inside was Julian’s declaration.

"I’m its father."

Lucas didn’t hesitate.

His fist connected with Julian’s jaw with a sickening crack.

Blood instantly welled at the corner of Julian’s mouth.

Lucas seized him by the collar, fury burning in his eyes. "Did you touch her? Did you sleep with her? Did you get her pregnant?!"

The misunderstanding spiraled out of control.

Lucas had already convinced himself—the child in Claire’s belly was his.

Blind fury consumed Lucas as his fists rained down on Julian's face.

Claire's heart pounded in terror as she rushed forward. "Lucas! Have you completely lost it?!"

"Yes, I have!" Lucas snarled, his voice raw with rage. "I'll kill him!"

The fire in his eyes was terrifying. Claire wanted to stop him, but fear for the baby in her womb held her back.

"Lucas, we're supposed to be at the courthouse in an hour to finalize our divorce."

Her words were sharp, deliberate. "Once we're divorced, who I choose to have a child with is none of your concern."

She stepped between them, shielding Julian with her body. "Julian is the man I love. Don't make me hate you, Lucas."

The air crackled with tension.

Lucas's fists trembled at his sides, his chest heaving.

Claire met his gaze, unflinching.

The clock was ticking.

Their marriage was over.

But Lucas wasn't ready to let go.

###Chapter 356 The Innocent One

Claire's voice trembled as she nearly screamed those final words.

The moment they left her lips, the air in the room turned thick with tension.

Lucas's eyes burned crimson, while Julian stood frozen, his expression unreadable.

Lucas's arm dropped to his side, lifeless.

The fire in his gaze dimmed, as though his soul had been extinguished in a single breath.

He turned stiffly, like a statue carved from grief.

"I won't touch him again. You can stop loving me, but just... don't hate me, Claire. Please."

The man who had always carried himself with unshakable pride now sounded broken, his voice raw with desperation.

When Lucas first discovered Claire hadn't ended the pregnancy, his heart had soared with hope.

But never—not even in his darkest nightmares—had he imagined the child might belong to Julian.

It was as if the universe had twisted the knife deeper, laughing at his suffering.

Julian wiped at his split lip, blood smearing his fingers. Lucas's knuckles were bruised, the pain nothing compared to the agony in his chest.

Lucas Bennett rose abruptly, turning his back. "This conversation isn't over."

His thoughts were a tangled mess, and he desperately needed space to breathe.

Without another word, Lucas stormed out.

Claire Dawson remained silent. The moment the door clicked shut behind him, she retreated into her bedroom, locking herself away.

Julian Mercer quietly straightened the living room, the muffled sound of weeping seeping through the closed door.

A cold realization settled in his chest—Claire didn’t love him.

Her tears weren’t for him. They were for Lucas, for the irreversible fracture between them.

Some wounds ran too deep to heal.

Meanwhile, at Whitmore Manor, Evelyn Carter finished dinner alone. Alexander still hadn’t returned.

Vanessa Hart watched her from across the table, then discreetly signaled a maid to arrange a private meeting.

Evelyn’s instincts flared. Nothing good ever came from Vanessa’s summons.

With Vanessa now pregnant and coddled by the entire household, Evelyn refused to be blamed if anything went wrong.

She’d been burned too many times before.

So when the maid approached, Evelyn shook her head. "Not tonight."

The evening air was crisp as Evelyn wandered through the manicured gardens of Whitmore Manor, hoping the stroll would ease the heaviness of dinner.

Then, without warning, Vanessa materialized from the shadows ahead.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. The sudden appearance sent a jolt of alarm through her.

Instinctively, she retreated two paces, putting a deliberate nine feet between them.

Vanessa smirked, taking a step forward.

"Don’t." Evelyn’s voice was sharp, her hand raised in warning. "If you have something to say, say it from there."

Vanessa tilted her head, fingers resting lightly on her rounded stomach. "Nervous? Relax. This baby is my only leverage. I wouldn’t waste it on you."

Evelyn scoffed, her gaze icy. Trusting Vanessa was like trusting a snake not to strike.

She positioned herself strategically at the intersection of two paths—close enough to the main walkway that passing staff could witness anything, yet with multiple escape routes.

"Evelyn," Vanessa purred, "wasn’t marrying Alexander enough? Or do you still crave Ethan too? Maybe you’re greedy enough to want both." Her smile turned venomous. "Why did you humiliate me in front of him? You—"

The accusation hung in the air, sharp as a blade.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into her palms. The garden, once serene, now thrummed with tension.

Vanessa wasn’t here to talk.

She was here to play.

And Evelyn refused to be her pawn.

The air between us crackled with tension as I faced Vanessa across the room. Her wide, accusing eyes burned with fury, but I refused to back down.

"First of all," I said, my voice steady, "Damian came forward on his own. I didn’t send him."

A bitter laugh escaped my lips as I continued. "And even if I had, I’d only be returning the favor—using the same tactics you’ve perfected against me."

My fingers curled into fists at my sides. "Vanessa, why do you always play the victim? You act like you’ve never done anything wrong."

Her lips parted, but I didn’t give her the chance to interrupt.

"Let’s not forget—you were the one who sought out Damian. I didn’t force you into his arms." My tone sharpened. "So don’t you dare blame me for your choices."

The weight of years of betrayal pressed down on me, and I exhaled slowly.

"If you really want to settle accounts," I said, my voice dropping to a dangerous whisper, "then let’s go over everything."

I took a step forward, watching as she stiffened.

"Your mother stole me away just so you could live in luxury. Three years ago, you conspired with Damian to frame me—to have me thrown into prison like a criminal."

My chest tightened with the memory of cold prison walls and endless nights of despair.

"Every single one of these debts, Vanessa," I said, my voice trembling with barely contained rage, "is something you owe me."

Silence stretched between us, heavy and suffocating.

For the first time, I saw a flicker of fear in her eyes.

And I relished it.

###Chapter 357 Vanessa’s True Colors

"How dare you pin your misfortunes on me?" Evelyn's voice dripped with icy disdain. "Vanessa, are you seriously delusional? After all the vile things you’ve done, karma will catch up with you sooner or later."

Without another word, Evelyn turned on her heel and walked away.

Vanessa watched her retreating figure, her nails digging into her palms hard enough to leave crescent-shaped marks. Rage vibrated through her entire body.

"You think you can expose me, Evelyn? You’re wasting your breath."

Her hand instinctively cradled her stomach.

"This baby is my golden ticket. The Caldwells will protect me at all costs. My father will stand by me no matter what. Even if that rat Damian changes his testimony, nothing will touch me."

Evelyn didn’t bother looking back. She only offered a chilling smile over her shoulder.

At that moment, Ethan stepped out from the shadows.

He had been trailing Evelyn since she left for her evening stroll in the garden. There was something about her—an invisible pull he couldn’t resist.

And so, he had heard every single word.

The moment Ethan Caldwell witnessed Vanessa Hart’s true nature, his world tilted.

Never had he imagined such venom could lurk beneath her delicate facade.

Her past sweetness? A carefully crafted illusion.

Her vulnerability? A calculated performance.

The realization struck him like a physical blow, leaving him reeling.

Vanessa’s face paled when she noticed Ethan standing there, but she quickly schooled her features into practiced innocence.

She approached him, her voice dripping with false remorse.

"Ethan, how long have you been here?"

Her fingers twisted nervously.

"Everything I said—it was just anger talking. Evelyn provoked me. You know how she is."

Ethan’s lips curled in disgust.

"Save your lies."

His gaze dropped to her stomach, his expression hardening.

"The thought of my blood running through your child’s veins makes me sick."

Vanessa’s breath hitched.

"Ethan, please—"

"You admitted it yourself," he cut in coldly. "One moment you’re confessing, the next you blame Damian for slander. Which is it?"

A beat of silence.

Then, with chilling finality, he delivered his verdict.

"Terminate the pregnancy. Name your price, and disappear."

He’d pay any amount to erase her from his life.

Tears welled in Vanessa’s eyes—but this time, they held no power over him.

The air between us crackled with tension.

"Ethan, how could you say those words in front of Evelyn?" My voice trembled with barely contained fury. "You know exactly how strained things are between us. You’re humiliating me!"

My hands instinctively cradled my stomach.

"You might not care about this baby, but I do. I’m keeping it."

Ethan’s lips curled into a mocking smirk.

"You always knew I’d leave you eventually. That’s why you’re using this child as leverage, isn’t it? Vanessa, you’re pathetic."

His words were like ice.

"Do you honestly believe my mother will still shield you after I expose everything?" His voice dropped lower, each syllable laced with venom. "I’ve held back out of pity. But now? There’s no reason to."

He turned sharply toward the door.

"Ethan!" I lunged forward, desperation clawing at my throat. "Where are you going?"

"Where do you think?" He didn’t even glance back. "To tell the Caldwells the truth about you."

"You can’t do this to me!"

Our voices clashed in the tense silence.

From the corner of the room, Evelyn watched us with detached amusement.

She didn’t intervene.

She didn’t need to.

The show was entertaining enough on its own.

The weight of old grudges had become exhausting.

Evelyn sighed, turning to leave.

Then—

A loud splash shattered the silence.

Whirling around, her breath caught in her throat.

Vanessa had just shoved Ethan into the water.

Evelyn stood frozen, disbelief coursing through her.

Did Vanessa really just do that?

Ethan was strong, solid—how could she overpower him so easily?

"I—I didn't mean to—!" Vanessa stammered, her face paling as she stumbled back. "Ethan, wait—I'll get help!"

Without another word, she spun on her heel and fled, not once looking back.

Secret Longing: A Love Reborn After Darkness (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 358 A Desperate Cry

Ethan couldn't swim.

The bitter winter air had turned the pond's surface into a fragile sheet of ice.

His body convulsed violently as the freezing water swallowed him whole.

The man who once carried himself with such arrogance now thrashed helplessly, his pride shattered like the ice beneath him.

"Someone... please..." he choked out between gasps.

Overhead, fireworks burst across the night sky in dazzling colors. The Caldwell family's planned celebration illuminated the darkness.

The perfect viewing spot was the grand balcony, too far away to hear anything from the isolated pond.

No matter how desperately Ethan screamed, his cries dissolved into the night.

Evelyn sprinted toward the water's edge.

She never imagined Vanessa would actually follow through with this.

She'd witnessed their heated argument, but attempted murder? That crossed a line even Vanessa wouldn't—

Ethan's head disappeared beneath the surface again. The pond might not be ocean-deep, but it was more than enough to claim a drowning man.

The icy water burned his lungs as he swallowed another mouthful. His thrashing grew weaker.

Evelyn's pulse hammered in her throat. She had to act now.

Vanessa stood frozen nearby, her face unreadable in the fireworks' glow. Was that regret in her eyes? Or satisfaction?

Ethan's hand broke the surface one final time before sinking beneath the black water.

The grand finale of fireworks exploded overhead, painting the scene in garish red light.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. She kicked off her heels and—

SPLASH.

The cold hit like a thousand needles.

Somewhere above, Vanessa screamed.

But Evelyn only had eyes for the dark shape sinking into the depths.

She reached out.

His fingers brushed hers.

Then slipped away.

The water swallowed them both.

Above the surface, the fireworks ended.

Silence fell over the Caldwell estate.

No one had seen a thing.

The icy water swallowed him whole, dragging him deeper with every frantic movement. Panic only made it worse—the more he fought, the faster he sank.

"Take my hand!" Evelyn shouted.

She dropped to her knees at the water's edge, arm outstretched toward Ethan.

She couldn’t just watch him drown. No matter their past, she wasn’t cruel enough to wish death upon him.

His fingers clamped around hers in sheer desperation.

Dragging him onto solid ground took every ounce of her strength. The moment he collapsed onto the shore, his legs seized violently.

Ethan writhed on the damp earth, muscles locked in agony, gasping like a fish out of water.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, torn between frustration and pity.

She had planned to walk away the second he was safe. But seeing him like this—helpless, shivering—she hesitated.

Her conscience won.

"Where does it hurt?" she demanded.

She gripped his calf, kneading the knotted muscles with firm pressure.

The night air bit through his soaked clothes, turning his skin to ice. His body trembled uncontrollably, lips darkening to a chilling shade of violet.

Evelyn's voice was icy as she spoke. "Don't look at me like that, Ethan. Let me remind you once more—there will never be anything between us. I belong to your uncle."

His expression darkened at her words, his jaw tightening.

She was drawing a line, one so sharp it left no room for doubt—or hope.

Ethan's voice dropped low, edged with frustration. "If you feel nothing for me, why did you save me?"

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "Consider it repayment for what you did for me years ago."

She hadn’t forgotten.

Back in college, when cruel whispers and sharp glares had followed her, Ethan had been the shadow shielding her. If not for him, those tormenting her would never have backed down.

And then there was the accident—Ethan, eighteen, driving through a storm to reach her, losing control, slamming into a pole. The coma that followed.

Ethan stiffened. He hadn’t expected this—her using his own rescue as another wall between them.

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Who asked you to repay me?"

Vanessa's lips curled into a wicked smile as she raised her hand, fingers splayed as if to shove him back into the water.

Ethan blinked, his expression shifting from shock to something darker. "Don't bother," he said flatly. "I'll do it myself."

Before she could react, he threw himself backward with deliberate force. The water swallowed him whole, the splash echoing across the lake's surface.

Evelyn could only stare, her breath catching in her throat.

"Ethan, you're insane."

This time, he didn't fight it. His body sank deeper, his eyes closing as if in surrender.

"Ethan!" Her voice cracked. "Have you completely lost your mind?"

The water rippled, silent and mocking.

Secret Longing: A Love Reclaimed (Evelyn)

###Chapter 359 Sinking into the Depths

Evelyn was seething. After all the trouble she’d gone through to drag him out, Ethan had the audacity to plunge right back in.

She shot to her feet, dusting off her jeans with sharp, irritated motions before spinning on her heel.

"Fine! Drown for all I care! Consider this my last act of mercy!"

Her thoughts raced. What kind of lunatic throws himself into an ice-cold lake? Is he trying to prove something? Or has he completely lost it?

Ethan’s jaw clenched.

The water rose, swallowing his vision, his breath, his senses whole.

The cold bit into his skin like needles, but he didn’t make a sound.

He refused to let Evelyn walk away like this.

If saving him was just her way of settling a debt—if she thought she could cut him off afterward—then he’d rather let the lake take him.

Evelyn had barely taken three steps when the unnatural silence behind her made her freeze.

The absence of splashing, of struggle, sent a jolt of dread down her spine.

She turned.

The water was still.

Too still.

Her breath hitched.

No. No, no, no—

Her feet moved before her mind could catch up.

Her pulse skyrocketed as she whirled around, sprinting back toward the lake’s edge.

“Ethan?”

Just a few feet away, Ethan’s coat bobbed on the water’s surface. A sharp, icy fear sliced through Evelyn as she lunged forward, fingers stretching desperately toward it.

“Ethan! Answer me!”

Her voice cracked.

“Please tell me he didn’t just—”

Her chest tightened. She hadn’t anticipated Ethan being this reckless.

Muttering under her breath, she yanked off her jacket, preparing to plunge into the frigid water once more.

Then—

A violent splash.

Ethan burst through the surface, choking, gasping, water spewing from his lips.

His face was blotched crimson from oxygen deprivation, his entire body shuddering. Without hesitation, Evelyn seized his arm and hauled him onto solid ground.

This time, exhaustion had hollowed him out.

Pale. Weak. Barely conscious.

His teeth chattered uncontrollably, his lips trembling too violently to form words.

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

Hypothermia was setting in.

Gritting her teeth, she wrapped an arm around his waist. “We’re going inside. Now.”

Evelyn slipped Ethan's arm over her shoulders, supporting his unsteady steps toward the grand estate.

The howling winter wind only intensified his suffering, his body trembling uncontrollably against hers.

Without thinking, he pressed closer, seeking what little warmth she offered.

"Ethan, why would you do this to yourself?" Her voice was sharp with frustration. "You're gambling with your life just to prove a point. Do you honestly think it's worth it?"

His lips quivered as he whispered weakly, "This isn't about proving anything."

It wasn't pride.

It was desperation—a last, reckless attempt to rekindle even a flicker of emotion in Evelyn's heart.

Even if it was just sympathy, he would take it.

He couldn't accept that seven years of love could vanish so easily.

Evelyn had no clue of the storm raging inside him. She assumed it was sheer stubbornness, a childish refusal to admit defeat.

When they finally reached his room, she guided him inside and spoke softly, "Take a hot bath. Change into dry clothes."

Her duty done, she turned to leave. She had already given him more than he deserved.

The moment Evelyn turned to leave, an odd scent lingered in the air.

She paused, inhaling deeply. Her nose wrinkled.

Glancing back, her gaze locked with Ethan’s.

He was sprawled on the floor, drenched and trembling. A puddle of water had formed around him. His clothes clung to his body, half-buttoned, as if he’d tried—and failed—to dress himself. His legs, still numb from the cold, refused to cooperate.

Evelyn kept her distance, arms crossed. "I’ll fetch a servant to assist you."

Something about this entire situation felt off.

Her mind raced. Where is everyone? The fireworks can’t possibly have drawn the entire household outside.

Had there been even a single soul in the halls, she would’ve dumped Ethan on them without a second thought.

"I… don’t feel right," Ethan groaned, curling in on himself.

A strange heat pulsed through his veins.

After nearly freezing in the water, his body should’ve been shivering. Instead, fire licked at his skin. His muscles tensed. His breathing grew ragged.

This wasn’t normal.

Yes, he had feelings for Evelyn. But this? This was something else entirely.

Evelyn hesitated.

His pallor was alarming. Against her better judgment, she stepped closer and pressed two fingers to his wrist.

His pulse thundered beneath her touch.

Far too fast.

Far too hot.

Her stomach twisted.

Something is very wrong.

###Chapter 360 He’s Got a Fever

The bewilderment on Ethan’s face told Evelyn everything. He clearly had no clue what was going on.

This mess wasn’t his doing.

Vanessa—had she orchestrated this?

Evelyn scanned the room, but the source of the strange, cloying scent eluded her.

She strode to the windows and flung them open, letting the crisp night air rush in.

Ethan’s shirt clung to him, drenched, but his cheeks burned with an unnatural flush. His gaze locked onto hers, lost and disoriented.

Right then, he looked like a wounded animal—vulnerable, desperate.

A shiver ran down Evelyn’s spine. She shouldn’t stay.

Even the faintest whiff of whatever was in the air had left her limbs heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

She turned to leave.

A hand clamped around her wrist.

Ethan’s grip was scorching. His usual icy composure had shattered, replaced by raw, unfiltered need. His voice was rough, strained.

"Evelyn… you’re just going to walk away?"

Her pulse stuttered.

This wasn’t the Ethan she knew.

And that terrified her.

Evelyn froze, every fiber of her being locked in tension.

Her breath caught in her throat.

That voice—so vulnerable, so broken. Is this really the same Ethan Caldwell, the untouchable tycoon of Cresthaven?

"What's wrong with you?" she whispered, her eyes widening in disbelief.

Ethan's head dipped lower, his body swaying slightly as he leaned into her. His breathing turned ragged, his forehead glistening with sweat.

The effort to control himself was evident—his voice strained, thick with something raw.

"I'm... fine."

Then she saw it—a single tear tracing down his cheek.

Her heart lurched.

Without thinking, she fished a tissue from her pocket and pressed it into his hand.

"Here. Wipe your face. Don't worry—your secret's safe with me."

She understood. A man like Ethan, a pillar of Horizon Enterprises, couldn't afford rumors of him sobbing while clinging to a woman's leg after a lake mishap. It would destroy his reputation.

She tried to pull away.

His grip only tightened.

"Evelyn," he rasped, his voice cracking. "What do I have to do for you to see me? Why won't you—"

"I've apologized. Isn't that enough?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Some things can't be undone."

Ethan's sobs only grew louder at her words.

A strange heaviness settled in Evelyn's chest. She'd never imagined seeing him like this—vulnerable, broken.

"Did the river water scramble his brain?" she mused.

"The Ethan I knew would rather die than let me see him cry."

Her palm pressed lightly between his shoulder blades, voice steady. "I need to leave."

She attempted to ease away, fingers brushing his chest—

Then recoiled instantly.

His skin scorched her fingertips. Fever.

"So it was just delirium talking." Relief loosened her shoulders. "I'll call a doctor."

The door handle refused to turn beneath her grip.

Locked? Or jammed?

Behind her, Ethan erupted into wet coughing. "Evelyn—clothes. The wardrobe. Please." His teeth chattered audibly.

The mahogany cabinet stood inches from her elbow, its mirrored surface reflecting twin images of distress.

Meanwhile, on the moonlit terrace...

The last sparks of fireworks had faded into the night, plunging the sky back into velvety darkness as guests began drifting away.

Vanessa came stumbling through the thinning crowd, her face ghostly pale, eyes wide with undisguised terror.

Eleanor spotted her immediately, irritation flaring. This girl had no sense of propriety whatsoever.

But with so many influential guests still milling about, Eleanor couldn't reprimand her openly. Instead, she fixed Vanessa with a glare sharp enough to cut glass.

Vanessa recoiled as if struck, backing up blindly until she collided with Sophia's solid frame.

"My goodness, you're shaking like a leaf!" Sophia caught her by the shoulders. "What on earth has frightened you so?"

###Chapter 361 The Broken Lock

Vanessa trembled, her lips colorless from how hard she'd been biting them. She looked like she was holding back something terrible, her voice tight with tension. "It's nothing... I didn't see anything."

Sophia's gaze sharpened with suspicion.

She seized Vanessa's wrist, her grip firm. "Tell us what you saw. We can help."

Vanessa shook her head violently, but her eyes shimmered with unshed tears, making her look utterly wretched.

Eleanor, annoyed by the theatrics, snapped coldly, "Stop this nonsense and speak. No one dares harm anyone under the Whitmore name."

Only then did Vanessa hesitate, her voice barely audible. "I... I saw a woman being dragged into a room by Ethan..."

Her words dissolved into quiet sobs, tears streaking down her cheeks, amplifying her fragile appearance.

Harold's expression darkened instantly. "What kind of ridiculous accusation is this?"

"Enough crying," Sophia said, trying to soothe her. "If this truly happened, Mr. Whitmore will handle it."

No one had expected Ethan to be bold enough to pull such a stunt—especially not within the walls of Whitmore Manor.

Eleanor felt a sharp pain forming behind her temples. She knew her son too well—there was always more to his stories than he let on.

Her gaze instinctively swept across the room.

When she realized Evelyn was nowhere in sight, a cold dread slithered down her spine. Ethan’s earlier words echoed in her mind. "He’s still obsessed with her."

Had he really been reckless enough to act on it in front of everyone?

And why, if Vanessa had seen someone entering a room with Ethan, hadn’t she intervened instead of gathering an audience?

The pieces didn’t fit.

The crowd was already surging toward the main hall, leaving Eleanor no chance to stop them.

Inside the room, Evelyn yanked open the wardrobe door.

Her breath hitched.

Draped inside was a familiar silk scarf—one she hadn’t seen in years.

“Remember this, Evelyn?” Ethan’s voice was soft, almost reverent. “I gave it to you a lifetime ago.”

She did remember.

She had thrown it away the day she severed ties with him.

So why was it here, hanging like some twisted trophy?

A shiver crawled up her spine.

Ethan’s smirk deepened as he watched her confusion unfold.

His voice dropped to a whisper as Ethan stepped closer.

The back of his fingers grazed hers with deliberate slowness.

Evelyn jerked her hand away as if burned.

Even with the windows wide open, the lingering traces of the drug made her head swim.

The door won’t budge. If I don’t get out soon…

"Alexander treats me well, and I care about him. Don’t bring this up again. That scarf—you should get rid of it," she said, her voice sharp as ice. She yanked at the handle once more.

Ethan’s expression twisted, pain flashing in his eyes before they glistened with unshed tears.

"Throw it away? Just like that?"

His voice cracked. "Evelyn, are you trying to erase us completely?"

She shook her head. "The past can’t be erased, but I’ve moved on. You should too, Ethan."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "You’re wasting your time. The lock’s jammed. It won’t open from the inside."

Her breath hitched. Of all the times for this to happen.

"Was it you? Or Vanessa?" Her gaze hardened. "Did you plan this—the drug, the locked door?"

Secret Longing: A Love Reclaimed (Evelyn Carter’s Story) 1/4

###Chapter 362 His Wife

An intoxicating aroma permeated the air. Only then did Ethan Caldwell comprehend the reason behind his unusual physical reactions.

Moments ago, he had attributed his lack of self-control around Evelyn Carter to the depth of his feelings for her. Just being near her made restraint impossible.

He had kept conversing with her—not just to prolong their time together, but also to distract himself from the overwhelming urge to act recklessly. Crossing boundaries with her was the last thing he wanted.

But when Evelyn mentioned the strange scent lingering in the room, realization struck Ethan like lightning.

"This is my private chamber. No servant would dare interfere here," he thought, his jaw tightening.

"So why would Vanessa do this?"

"Could she be setting Evelyn up?"

A cold fury settled over Ethan’s expression.

Just then, the sound of approaching footsteps and murmurs echoed from outside the door.

A bitter chuckle escaped him.

He knew if word spread that Evelyn was in his room, the consequences would be disastrous.

Ethan Caldwell never imagined Vanessa Hart would sink this low—dragging him into her twisted game, using him as a mere stepping stone to achieve her ambitions.

But Vanessa had gravely underestimated just how much Ethan cherished Evelyn Carter.

Yes, he desired her.

Yes, he longed to be with her.

Yet he would never stoop to such dishonorable tactics to claim her.

Even as the intoxicating fragrance thickened the air, Ethan steeled himself against its effects.

A cold smirk curled his lips as he lifted his gaze to Evelyn. "Don't worry," he rasped, his voice rough with fever. "I won't let anything happen to you."

He forced himself upright, fighting the dizziness that threatened to pull him under. The icy plunge into the lake had left his limbs numb, his muscles sluggish. Every movement was a battle.

Ethan staggered forward.

But Evelyn didn’t reach for him.

Instead, she took a deliberate step back, maintaining the distance between them.

Her voice was calm, detached. "I don’t need your protection."

Emotional debts were the most dangerous kind—she refused to owe him anything.

Ethan’s eyes darkened with confusion. "Then what are you planning?"

"Ethan, who's in there with you? Don't be reckless. Open the door."

Almost simultaneously, Vanessa's voice pierced through, thick with tears as if she had endured some unspeakable injustice.

Audrey tried to soothe her, murmuring, "Calm down, or you'll upset the baby."

At the mention of the child, Vanessa's expression crumpled further into despair.

"They say men stray when their wives are carrying their child. I never imagined it would happen to me," she sobbed.

Eleanor immediately jumped to her son’s defense, snapping, "We don’t even know the truth yet, and you’re already spinning tales?"

Hearing this, Evelyn let out a sharp, bitter laugh.

She turned to Ethan, her voice dripping with icy amusement. "How does it feel to be betrayed by the woman you call your wife?"

Ethan’s jaw clenched, his words tight with barely restrained fury. "She was never my wife. We never even signed a marriage certificate."

Just then, Harold’s commanding voice boomed through the door. "Open it. Now."

A servant hurried forward with the key, ready to turn the lock.

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to the window behind her.

"It’s only two stories. A jump might twist an ankle, but it won’t kill me."

"But if anyone finds me in here with Ethan..."

Evelyn's fingers dug into the windowsill, her body poised to leap.

Ethan's expression turned stormy. "Evelyn," he hissed, voice low and urgent, "I promised I'd keep you safe. Don't do this."

She offered him one last fleeting smile—soft, bittersweet.

Then she jumped.

The hem of her dress whipped against the wind as she disappeared from view.

Ethan lunged forward, his heart slamming against his ribs, fingers grasping at empty air.

But before he could react further, the door burst open.

Secret Longing: A Love Reclaimed After the Fall (Evelyn)

###Chapter 363 Something Is Amiss

A hushed crowd had gathered outside the guest room, their curious gazes immediately drawn to the bed.

The sheets lay perfectly smooth, untouched. Ethan stood motionless, his clothes drenched, water dripping onto the carpet. His usually composed demeanor was shattered.

Eleanor rushed forward, her face pale with worry. "Ethan! What happened? Why are you soaked?"

His skin burned beneath her touch, feverish and clammy.

"You're burning up!" Her voice trembled. "How did this happen?"

Ethan's sharp gaze cut through the room, landing on Vanessa.

She flinched under the intensity of his stare.

Sophia turned to Vanessa, arms crossed. "You claimed there was a woman in here. Where is she?"

"I—" Vanessa faltered, her confidence crumbling. She had seen Evelyn guiding Ethan inside with her own eyes.

This wasn't how it was supposed to go.

By now, everyone should have found them together—Evelyn and Ethan, tangled in scandal. There would be no escape for her.

Yet the room was empty.

Ethan's fever, his drenched clothes—none of it made sense.

Vanessa's pulse raced. Something had gone terribly wrong.

Vanessa had been certain that if Evelyn was caught seducing a married man, even with Alexander's backing, her reputation would be utterly ruined.

Everything should have gone perfectly, yet now, Evelyn had vanished without a trace.

Vanessa had personally locked the door.

Her gaze flickered toward the bathroom. She rushed over and shoved the door open.

Next, she checked the wardrobe and beneath the bed. Finding them empty, her face drained of color.

“She’s gone,” Vanessa whispered, disbelief lacing her voice.

Sophia’s interest evaporated instantly. “Dragging everyone here in the dead of night for what? A ridiculous farce?”

Harold shot Vanessa a disapproving look. “If there’s nothing to see, everyone should leave.”

It was late, and no one wanted to stay a moment longer.

One by one, the crowd dispersed.

Eleanor, however, kept her eyes fixed on Ethan, sensing something off about the night’s events.

“Ethan, why are your clothes soaking wet?”

“Ask Vanessa. She pushed me into the lake,” Ethan replied, his piercing gaze locking onto Vanessa once more.

At his words, Eleanor’s expression darkened instantly. "Vanessa, have you lost your mind?"

Vanessa’s voice trembled as she defended herself. "It wasn’t intentional! It was an accident!"

Ethan scoffed, his eyes flashing with fury. "Don’t lie. You pushed me into the lake, promised to get help, and instead, you brought an audience to witness some fabricated scandal?"

Vanessa bit her lip hard, her nails digging into her palms. "I was just… upset when I saw you two together."

"Upset?" Ethan’s voice dripped with disdain. "What gives you the right? And that scent in the room—the one meant to provoke desire—wasn’t that your doing?"

"What scent?" Vanessa widened her eyes, feigning innocence. "Ethan, I don’t know what you’re talking about."

By now, the lingering traces of the scent had faded, giving her the confidence to play dumb.

"Ethan," she whispered, tears glistening in her eyes. "Are you really misunderstanding me like this?"

Her voice cracked dramatically. "Even if you have feelings for Evelyn, I could have tolerated your secret meetings. But this is Harold’s house! How could you be so shameless in front of him?"

Eleanor’s sharp gaze flickered between them before she interjected. "Ethan, what exactly is going on between you and Evelyn? Have you two—?"

"Mother!" Ethan cut her off coldly, his jaw tight. "Are you really going to believe her lies so easily?"

The words barely left her lips when Ethan Caldwell's fingers closed around Vanessa Hart's throat, his grip tightening with barely restrained rage. His eyes burned with a fire that sent chills down her spine.

"You honestly believe my mother's favor makes you untouchable?" His voice was a dangerous whisper, laced with venom.

Vanessa gasped for air, her nails digging into his wrist, but his hold didn't loosen.

"Playing games with me?" Ethan snarled, his face inches from hers. "Vanessa, you must have a death wish."

The air between them crackled with tension, his fury palpable.

She choked out a laugh, defiance flashing in her eyes despite the fear. "You wouldn't dare."

His grip tightened further. "Try me."

The threat hung in the air, heavy and suffocating.

Secret Longing: A Love Reclaimed (Evelyn Carter) novel

###Chapter 364 The Truth Comes Out

Vanessa gasped for air, her face flushing crimson within seconds.

Tears spilled down her cheeks as she locked desperate eyes with Eleanor, silently begging for mercy.

Seeing Ethan's uncharacteristic fury and the brutal grip he had on Vanessa, Eleanor rushed forward. "Ethan, stop! Think about the baby!"

"The baby?"

Ethan's expression turned glacial. "Does she even deserve to carry my child?"

Under normal circumstances, he would never raise a hand against a woman—but Vanessa had shattered every boundary.

Using her pregnancy as a weapon to manipulate and scheme? Unforgivable.

"I told you—once the child is born, your father can come home. Until then, she must stay unharmed," Eleanor insisted, her voice strained with urgency.

"Do you have any idea what she did tonight?" Ethan's tone was razor-sharp.

"She shoved me into the lake, pretended to run for help, then led everyone back to stage this absurd spectacle."

Ethan's grip tightened around Vanessa's throat, his voice a deadly whisper. "You should be a corpse right now."

Eleanor's face drained of color. She had been completely unaware.

Her sharp gaze turned to Vanessa. "Is what Ethan saying true?"

Vanessa gasped for air, her vision blurring at the edges. Just as darkness threatened to consume her, Eleanor rushed forward and yanked Ethan away.

Finally free, Vanessa collapsed to her knees, clutching her bruised throat. Tears streamed down her face in torrents.

Never had she imagined Ethan could be so cruel—so willing to end her life with his bare hands.

Trembling, she managed to rasp out, "Mrs. Whitmore... it's true I pushed Ethan into the water by accident. But it's also true that there's something going on between him and Evelyn."

Before she could finish, Eleanor's palm struck Vanessa's cheek with a resounding crack.

"You dared to lay hands on my son?" Eleanor's voice was ice. "If you weren't carrying his child, do you think I'd even tolerate your existence?"

The blow left Vanessa reeling. A fiery handprint bloomed across her pale skin.

For a long moment, she simply knelt there in shock. Then, pressing a shaking hand to her stinging cheek, she dissolved into even louder sobs.

"You will end this pregnancy immediately and leave Whitmore Manor. I'll compensate you with thirty million dollars. After this, we're done."

His eyes burned with contempt. Ethan couldn't fathom how Vanessa could sink so low.

Now that he saw her for who she truly was, all he felt was revulsion.

Eleanor hesitated at Ethan's harsh demand, her expression conflicted.

"She's made mistakes, yes, but the baby is blameless. Why not let her stay until the child is born? Your father would—"

"Mother!" Ethan cut her off sharply. "Why are you so obsessed with this child? If you want a baby that badly, go have one yourself!"

"What kind of ridiculous talk is that?" Eleanor snapped, glaring at her son in disbelief.

Vanessa shook her head, her voice trembling. "Don’t you see, Eleanor? Ethan is desperate to discard me because he’s already fixated on Evelyn."

Her hand rested protectively over her stomach. "Once I’m out of the Whitmore family, nothing will stand between them."

She looked down, whispering to her unborn child. "You poor thing. You came at the worst possible time. Your father is already lost to another woman. He doesn’t care about you at all."

Secret Longing: Finding Love After Redemption (Evelyn)

###Chapter 365 Eleanor's Decision

Vanessa shook her head, tears streaming silently down her cheeks.

Eleanor's brow furrowed. Vanessa's words resonated deeply within her.

She knew her son better than anyone. Once Ethan Caldwell set his mind to something, nothing could change it. Her thoughts spiraled. He’s already left his position at Titan Capital Group. If he provokes Alexander by interfering with Evelyn’s affairs… he might not even survive in Cresthaven.

The realization sent a cold shiver down her spine.

One man in her family had already been forced out by Alexander. She couldn’t bear to lose her son too.

In her eyes, Vanessa was the only thing standing between Ethan and Evelyn.

And then there was the child Vanessa carried—Eleanor couldn’t bring herself to discard it.

"Ethan, this baby must stay," she said firmly. "Just yesterday, I spoke to your father. He told me he was attacked overseas. He’s barely holding on."

Her voice softened, pleading. "You just need to endure a little longer. Once the baby is born, we’ll find a way to bring him home."

Eleanor feared Ethan might lash out at Vanessa again. If that happened, she wasn’t sure she could protect her.

Ethan had never experienced such utter frustration before.

His fever burned through him, leaving his limbs weak and trembling. A pounding headache made his vision swim dangerously, threatening to send him crashing to the floor at any second.

His clothes were still damp, clinging uncomfortably to his skin.

Once Eleanor had ushered Vanessa out and shut the door, Ethan had no energy left to argue.

He would rest first and deal with Vanessa later—when he wasn’t fighting just to stay upright.

Just as he finished changing into dry clothes, a sudden realization struck him. Gritting his teeth against the exhaustion, he forced himself to the window and looked down.

Evelyn had leapt from the window, bracing for impact.

But instead of hitting the ground, she landed safely in someone’s arms.

Alexander had caught her, and the force sent them both tumbling onto the grass.

Evelyn’s face pressed flush against Alexander’s, and in her overwhelming relief, she impulsively kissed him—hard.

So hard that her teeth ached from the impact.

Wincing, she pulled back, clutching her mouth.

And when she looked up, she found herself trapped in Alexander’s piercing, stormy gaze.

Eleanor's Choice

Alexander’s arm remained locked around her waist as he murmured, "Mrs. Whitmore, care to explain why you just jumped out of Ethan’s window?"

"What exactly were the two of you doing in there? Hmm?"

Though his tone was deceptively calm, Evelyn could hear the dangerous edge beneath it.

She realized how this must look—her, jumping out of a window in the dead of night. It screamed of guilt, of someone caught in the act and fleeing.

Her words stumbled. "It’s… complicated."

Alexander’s grip tightened slightly. "Then simplify it."

"Vanessa pushed Ethan into the water. I pulled him out, took him to his room, but then Vanessa showed up with a crowd."

Evelyn let out a disbelieving laugh at how absurd it sounded.

Alexander arched a brow, his expression clearly saying, "You expect me to believe that?"

Frustrated, Evelyn dragged a hand through her hair.

"Alexander, I know it sounds insane, but you have to trust me. You know how I feel about you, don’t you?"

Amusement flickered in his eyes. "No, I don’t. Why don’t you show me?"

Evelyn bit her lip—then suddenly cupped Alexander’s face in her hands.

Her fingers trembled as they brushed against Alexander's cheek. Without warning, Evelyn closed the distance between them, capturing his lips in a desperate kiss.

Alexander went completely still. The sudden contact sent shockwaves through his body, leaving him breathless and disoriented.

When he didn't react, Evelyn misinterpreted his silence. Her grip tightened around his shoulders, pressing him deeper into the soft grass. She kissed him again with renewed urgency - once, twice, three times - each kiss more insistent than the last.

Beneath her, Alexander's heartbeat accelerated until it threatened to burst from his chest. The scent of her perfume mixed with the earthy aroma of crushed grass, creating an intoxicating blend that made his head spin.

###Chapter 366 Let Him Watch

The night was eerily quiet, the atmosphere charged with unspoken tension. Pale moonlight filtered through the trees, painting everything in an otherworldly silver hue that made the darkness feel alive with possibility.

Alexander came back to himself with a sharp inhale, his lips crashing against Evelyn's with a hunger that bordered on desperation. It was as if he wanted to consume her, to make her a part of him completely.

Evelyn gasped for air, her voice trembling as she whispered, "Alexander, we're not alone out here."

But he only deepened the kiss, his mouth trailing lower, tracing the delicate curve of her collarbone. His hands were restless, his desire too fierce to be contained.

"Not like this," she pleaded softly, pressing her palms against his chest. "Inside. We can go inside. Just—not here, okay?"

From the window above, Ethan watched. His vision tunneled, zeroing in on the two figures tangled together in the grass, lost in each other, utterly unaware of anything else.

He staggered back as if struck, his heart seizing in his chest like a knife had been driven straight through it.

The sight of Alexander pinning Evelyn down, kissing her like a man possessed, sent a white-hot rage through him. Every muscle in his body tensed, his fingers digging into the windowsill hard enough to leave marks.

His breath came in ragged bursts, his entire body trembling with the effort to stay still. The pain was suffocating, twisting his insides into knots.

He wanted to storm down there.

He wanted to tear them apart.

But he couldn't move.

All he could do was watch.

The veins on Ethan's hands bulged as his nails dug into his palms.

Even through the agony, he couldn't tear his eyes away. He needed to see how far this would go between them.

"Am I punishing myself?" The thought clawed at him.

"This shouldn't be happening. Evelyn was supposed to be mine."

His jaw clenched. "Alexander has no right. I met her first. Seven years—seven damn years—and I never even got to kiss her!"

His vision burned as their embrace deepened, lips moving with reckless hunger. In his mind, it was him—his hands tangled in Evelyn's hair, his mouth claiming hers.

A sharp ache flared in his chest, making his breath hitch.

Alexander had noticed Ethan the moment he appeared.

There he stood, half-hidden behind the glass, eyes glistening with unshed fury. Even from across the room, Alexander could taste the bitterness radiating from him.

The corner of Alexander's mouth curved.

Looking down at Evelyn, he deliberately murmured, "Anything I want when we get home? As often as I like?"

Evelyn's cheeks darkened. She swatted his chest with a breathless laugh.

"Why does he have to be so cruel?" Evelyn wondered, her heart pounding. "Why ask me that again? What am I supposed to say?"

Alexander didn’t wait for an answer.

Seeing her bury her face shyly against his chest, he tilted her chin up and captured her lips in another searing kiss. Between breaths, his voice was rough with desire as he murmured, "Then tonight, you’ll be in charge, alright?"

Evelyn’s thoughts spun wildly. In charge?

How exactly does he expect me to do that?

Heat flooded her cheeks. She pressed her face into the crook of his neck, too flustered to meet his smoldering gaze.

Alexander seemed to relish her embarrassment. With one arm locked around her waist and the other braced against the floor, he effortlessly rose to his feet.

Instinctively, Evelyn wound her arms around his shoulders.

He hooked his hands beneath her thighs, lifting her effortlessly, and carried her toward their bedroom.

Years of disciplined training had honed Alexander’s strength—holding Evelyn’s slight frame was nothing to him.

Every movement radiated raw, masculine power, while Evelyn clung to him like a delicate vine, her legs wrapped tightly around his waist.

She couldn’t bring herself to lift her head, her voice muffled against his shoulder as she protested weakly, "You don’t have to carry me… I can walk…"

The way he held her made her skin prickle with awareness.

In private, she might have melted into his embrace. But here at Whitmore Manor? Even at this late hour, Evelyn couldn't shake the dread of prying eyes.

"You leapt from a second-floor window." Alexander's voice was rough velvet against her ear. "Can you even feel your legs?"

His arms tightened around her as he carried her effortlessly.

"Aren't you worried someone might see?" Evelyn whispered, her fingers curling into his shirt.

"Worried?" His low chuckle sent shivers down her spine. "I'm counting on it."

###Chapter 367 I Want Evelyn

Evelyn tilted her head, confusion flickering in her eyes. "Hmm? Who can't see?"

Alexander's gaze darkened, his eyes briefly darting toward the window ledge. "No one."

Upstairs, Ethan Caldwell watched as Alexander and Evelyn vanished from sight. Rage burned through him, white-hot and consuming. His fist collided with the glass before him before he could stop himself.

The window exploded on impact. Shards rained down, embedding into his skin.

But Ethan barely registered the pain.

He knew Alexander had done this deliberately.

It was a calculated provocation.

The image of Alexander carrying Evelyn away seared into his mind. He could already picture what came next—intimacy, whispered words, touches meant only for each other.

It was unbearable.

Ethan dropped to his knees, fingers tangling in his hair as a raw, guttural scream tore from his throat.

Alexander's cruelty cut deeper than any blade. This wasn't just physical—it was psychological torture, designed to break him.

And it was working.

His vision swam red, blood dripping from his wounded hand onto the shattered glass below.

He was losing his mind.

The crash of breaking glass shattered the night's silence. Eleanor had just settled Vanessa down when she hurried to check on Ethan, worried about his persistent fever.

She never expected to find the room splattered with blood.

Her heart lurched. She rushed to his side.

"Ethan! What happened?"

The shattered window told her everything.

Tears streaked down his face. "I want Evelyn!"

Eleanor stiffened. Her pulse spiked as she quickly shut the door, terrified someone from the Whitmore family might hear.

"Have you lost your senses? Evelyn is married to Alexander! Ethan, you can't say things like this! Didn’t I already warn you?"

Ethan collapsed to the floor, his body limp, his eyes hollow—like a man who had nothing left.

Seeing his feverish state and the blood dripping from his hand, Eleanor reached to help him up.

But he shoved her away.

Without a word, he wrenched the door open and stormed out.

"Where do you think you're going in this state?" she called after him, panic rising.

The night swallowed him whole.

"Are you seriously this obsessed with Evelyn?"

Eleanor watched him with growing concern, more convinced than ever that Vanessa needed to stay by his side.

"Don’t you find this behavior humiliating? A man should focus on his ambitions, not lose himself over a woman. I’ve never seen anyone act like they’re dying for someone like this. Besides, you were the one who chose to marry Vanessa."

She frowned, pressing a hand to his forehead. "You must be delirious from the fever. You need to rest and calm down."

She grabbed a bottle of fever reducers from the medicine cabinet and set them on the nightstand. Then, she called for the housekeeper to clean up the broken glass scattered across the floor.

Worried Ethan might do something reckless, she snatched the key and locked the bedroom door from the outside. The way he looked right now—wild-eyed, desperate—made her fear he’d storm out and confront Alexander directly.

Ethan collapsed onto the bed, his chest hollow, his heart in shambles.

Alexander had pushed him past his breaking point.

The sheer ruthlessness of it stunned him. Not only had Alexander taken the woman he loved, but he’d done it in the cruelest way possible—twisting the knife deeper just to watch him bleed.

When he heard the lock click from the outside, Ethan let out a bitter laugh.

Even his own mother didn’t trust him anymore.

But what did it matter?

Evelyn was gone.

And Alexander had won.

No prison could contain him if he truly wished to escape.

His eyes flickered toward the shattered glass.

If Evelyn had the courage to leap, so did he.

Ethan Caldwell rose to his feet, his movements swift and decisive.

The night air was cool against his skin as he braced himself on the windowsill.

Without hesitation, he threw himself into the darkness.

###Chapter 368 The Breaking Point

Ethan Caldwell leaped from the garden wall.

His landing was far from graceful, sending a sharp pain shooting through his twisted ankle. He gritted his teeth and pushed through it.

The night was unnervingly still as he limped toward the guesthouse where Alexander Whitmore resided.

No guards. No witnesses. Just the suffocating silence of the estate.

A dim glow seeped from one of the upstairs windows. He moved closer, his pulse erratic.

Then—he heard it.

Soft, breathy moans. A woman’s voice, laced with pleasure.

His blood turned to fire.

He knew that voice. Evelyn.

Ethan’s hands clenched into fists. His imagination painted the scene behind that door—Alexander, claiming her, savoring every inch of her.

Of course he’s ecstatic. He has her. All of her.

A bitter taste filled his mouth.

If only I hadn’t been so damn noble back then—

The thought carved into him like a blade.

His throat constricted, veins throbbing at his temples, his vision tinged red.

He didn’t understand why, but even knowing what was happening inside, he couldn’t stop himself from coming here.

Dragging a hand down his face, he suddenly slammed his fists against the door with brutal force, as if he could tear it down with sheer will.

If he didn’t make them stop now, he’d lose his mind. He couldn’t bear another second of it.

The sounds inside cut off abruptly.

Evelyn bit her lip and slid off Alexander, instinctively yanking the sheets up to her chin, leaving only her flushed face exposed.

Alexander’s gaze flicked toward the door, his expression darkening.

At this hour, no one should have been interrupting them. And yet, he already knew exactly who stood on the other side.

A cruel smirk curled his lips as he pulled Evelyn back against him, his grip unyielding.

Her cheeks burned as she pressed into the hard planes of his chest, her body trembling faintly. His voice, rough and low, whispered against her ear, "Ignore it. We're not done."

His heartbeat was steady, powerful—a stark contrast to the erratic rhythm of her own.

The heat of their bare skin pressed together, the intimacy of the moment, made her realize just how reckless this man could be. How utterly shameless.

She hadn't anticipated Alexander to be this relentless, completely disregarding the persistent knocking at the door.

"Not now," Evelyn breathed, her voice barely audible. "Please, someone's there. Go check."

Her cheeks burned with humiliation. Had anyone heard them earlier? The mere possibility made her want to disappear.

Tonight, Alexander was insatiable. Even after their passionate afternoon, his energy only seemed to grow as the night deepened.

Exhaustion weighed heavily on Evelyn, but he showed no signs of stopping.

She thought back to her reckless escape from Ethan’s window earlier. It must have looked suspicious, and perhaps that was why she let Alexander have his way—hoping it would soothe his simmering anger.

Yet, the more she yielded, the more consumed he became. He had guided her through positions that left her muscles trembling, her back aching in protest.

Seeing her distress, Alexander finally relented, lazily pulling on his trousers before striding toward the door.

Evelyn scrambled into her robe and burrowed beneath the sheets, wrapping herself tightly like a fragile cocoon.

The door swung open.

There stood Ethan, his eyes bloodshot, fury radiating from every tense line of his body.

His eyes burned with an intensity that wasn't quite tears—something darker, fiercer. A storm of barely restrained fury.

The door swung open, and Ethan Caldwell's gaze snapped toward the interior.

There she was—Evelyn Carter, curled beneath the blankets, only a single strand of her hair visible.

Then her eyes flickered up, bright and hesitant, meeting his for the briefest moment. A silent exchange, unnoticed by Alexander Whitmore standing between them.

###Chapter 369 Restless Desire

Evelyn's lips, still plump and flushed from their heated exchange, glistened invitingly under the dim light. Alexander's gaze darkened as he took in the sight, his fingers curling into tight fists at his sides.

The image of her beneath the sheets burned in his mind, sending a surge of possessiveness through him.

Noticing Ethan's lingering stare, Alexander shifted subtly, cutting off his view with a deliberate step forward. His voice was low, edged with warning. "It's late. What do you want?"

Ethan's throat worked as he struggled for words. He had acted on impulse, driven by a desperate need to interrupt whatever was happening behind that door.

But now, faced with the reality of the situation, he felt foolish.

Alexander and Evelyn were married. Their intimacy was natural, expected. And here he stood—an outsider, consumed by jealousy, his presence nothing short of pathetic.

Swallowing hard, Ethan forced out the flimsy excuse he had prepared. "I cut my hand. I... I came to ask for bandages."

Alexander's lips curled slightly, unimpressed. He saw right through the lie.

Alexander stood bare-chested, his sculpted torso glistening under the dim light.

Every defined muscle was slick with sweat, fresh crimson scratches trailing down his shoulders—undeniable evidence of Evelyn’s desperate grip moments ago.

Ethan Caldwell’s throat tightened, his pulse hammering as he took in the scene.

Alexander exhaled sharply, arms crossing over his chest as he leveled Ethan with an impatient glare. "If you’re done staring, get out. Your dear aunt is… rather preoccupied." His voice dripped with mocking amusement. "She doesn’t like to be kept waiting."

Ethan’s jaw clenched.

The words struck like a blade, twisting deeper with each syllable.

Before Ethan could retort, the door slammed shut, nearly grazing his nose. He stumbled back, fists trembling at his sides, his gaze burning into the wood separating him from Evelyn.

Inside, Evelyn arched a brow, pressing a playful slap against Alexander’s chest.

"I can’t wait any longer?" she challenged, lips curving.

Alexander smirked, closing the distance between them in one stride. His arms wound around her waist, pulling her flush against him.

"Prove me wrong," he murmured against her ear.

I couldn't stop myself from cradling the back of her head and claiming her lips again.

"It wasn't you who was impatient... It was me."

Evelyn's heart skipped wildly in her chest.

This man—why does he always catch me off guard like this?

She pressed lightly against Alexander's chest, breaking the kiss, her gaze flickering instinctively toward the door.

Was Ethan still there?

Alexander followed her line of sight, his voice dropping dangerously low. "What's wrong? Still thinking about him?"

"What are you talking about?" Evelyn shot him a glare. "There is no 'him.' There's only you."

"Is that so?"

The corner of his mouth lifted in satisfaction. Tilting his chin up slightly, he issued a command. "Prove it."

Evelyn blinked, momentarily stunned.

Then realization hit, and heat rushed to her cheeks.

After a brief hesitation, she closed her eyes and pressed her lips to his.

Alexander responded instantly, deepening the kiss with a hunger that left her breathless.

The moment Alexander pulled Evelyn into his embrace, she was consumed by his fiery passion. His touch ignited a familiar heat, melting her resistance instantly.

Outside the door, Ethan Caldwell hadn't moved an inch.

The walls were thin.

Too thin.

Every sigh, every whisper, every intimate sound between Alexander and Evelyn reached Ethan’s ears with cruel clarity.

His jaw clenched.

His fingers curled into fists.

A bitter thought twisted in his mind: "I’m still standing here, and he’s already claiming her like this?"

The humiliation burned deeper than anger.

###Chapter 370 Ethan's Downfall

Ethan's Adam's apple moved visibly, his jawline rigid with tension.

His breathing came in ragged gasps, knuckles white from how tightly he clenched his fists. His entire body shook violently, as if caught in an invisible storm.

Maybe the sheer magnitude of the shock was too much. One second, Ethan was standing—the next, his vision blurred, his knees buckled, and he crashed to the floor, consciousness slipping away like sand through his fingers.

The pain wasn’t sharp—it was a slow, suffocating tide, drowning him in waves of agony. He would’ve preferred a knife to the gut over this. At least that would’ve been clean.

Across the room, Evelyn stiffened, her gaze darting toward the door.

Had she just heard something?

Instinctively, she tried to pull away from Alexander’s arms, her body already twisting toward the sound.

Alexander frowned, his grip tightening around her waist, dragging her back against him.

“Distracted during a kiss?” His voice was low, rough with irritation. “Where do you think you’re going?”

“I heard something outside.”

Evelyn’s eyes flicked to the door again. “Didn’t you hear it?”

Alexander, trained for years in tactical response, had reflexes honed to near-perfection. His hearing was sharper than most—but right now, all he cared about was the woman in his arms slipping away.

The sound was unmistakable.

Alexander heard it clearly—the heavy thud of a body hitting the ground.

His lips curled in disdain.

Ethan Caldwell had fainted outside, unable to bear the emotional strain.

Pathetic.

Was this his way of manipulating Evelyn’s sympathy?

Alexander’s voice was cold, detached. "What sound? I didn’t hear anything."

Evelyn frowned.

The noise had been loud enough to echo through the hallway. There was no way he hadn’t heard it.

"I’m going to check."

"Evelyn." His tone sharpened, freezing her in place.

She turned to face him.

"It’s Ethan."

Alexander’s gaze was glacial. "He’s doing this to get your attention. Do you really want to play into his hands?"

Evelyn hesitated.

She remembered—Ethan had fallen into the lake earlier that night.

He had been burning up with fever.

Her fingers tightened around the edge of her sleeve.

She never anticipated he would come searching for her, using the flimsy excuse of needing a bandage from Alexander.

Evelyn saw right through it. Ethan simply wanted to lay eyes on her again.

She knew she should maintain her distance.

But ever since Ethan’s car crash at eighteen, the aftermath had haunted him. Back then, his fever had spiked so dangerously high, the doctors had rushed out a critical condition notice.

The damage never fully healed.

If his temperature rose unchecked now, it could trigger seizures—potentially fatal without immediate intervention.

Despite their fractured history, Evelyn couldn’t ignore the possibility.

That accident had been her fault, after all.

Her fingers tightened around the doorframe. "Fine, I won’t go. But will you at least check on him?"

The thought of Ethan collapsing just beyond the door gnawed at her.

Even if Alexander went instead, it would ease the knot in her chest.

Alexander’s expression remained icy, his voice sharp as shattered glass. "Not a chance."

Her heart clenched at the sight. Even if it were a complete stranger, she couldn't just leave them unconscious on the doorstep.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, his body rigid with refusal.

When he didn’t move, Evelyn pushed herself up, determined to open the door herself.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, his dark eyes flashing with frustration.

This had gone on long enough.

Ethan couldn’t keep pulling these desperate stunts to worm his way back into Evelyn’s life.

And there he was—Ethan Caldwell, sprawled across the porch, his skin alarmingly pale.

The impact of his fall had left an ugly bruise blooming across his temple, stark against his ashen complexion. His breathing was shallow, his body limp.

###Chapter 371 Alexander Was Furious

Ethan had rushed to change after his unexpected plunge into the icy water, but his hair remained damp. The biting winter wind only intensified his growing dizziness.

Fever took hold swiftly. By the time Evelyn opened the door, Ethan was already convulsing violently.

He collapsed onto the floor, his body twisting in uncontrolled spasms, curled into a helpless, trembling ball. Gone was his usual arrogance—only raw vulnerability remained.

Evelyn dropped to her knees instantly, pressing her hands against his shoulders as she called out in panic, "Alexander! I need your help!"

Alexander stood frozen, his voice sharp with barely contained rage. "Let him suffer. His fate means nothing to me."

She knew his words were fueled by anger.

Alexander would never truly abandon someone in need.

"Stop being stubborn," Evelyn snapped. "This is serious. And if anything happens to him right outside our door, do you really think Grace won't blame you for it?"

She slapped Ethen’s cheek sharply, trying to rouse him, but he remained unresponsive. His convulsions grew more erratic, his breathing shallow. The situation was deteriorating fast.

The air was thick with tension.

Alexander, however, remained unmoved, his expression cold and detached.

Evelyn’s voice trembled as she begged, “At least call for help, please?”

Alexander didn’t even glance her way.

“Alexander!”

After what felt like an eternity, Ethan was finally rushed to the hospital.

The chaos had grown so loud that it even disturbed the Whitmore household.

Sophia rubbed her eyes, still half-asleep. “Alexander, what on earth happened? Why was Ethan passed out outside your door in the middle of the night?”

Alexander’s gaze sharpened. “That’s exactly what I’d like to know, Sophia. Maybe you should ask him why he wasn’t in bed and decided to pay me a visit at this hour.”

Sophia flinched at his tone and pressed her lips together, falling silent.

Eleanor, of course, knew the truth.

What she couldn’t fathom was why Ethan would go to such lengths—climbing out of his window—just to see Evelyn, especially after she had locked his door before leaving.

To Eleanor, Evelyn was nothing but trouble.

The night had taken a dark turn, and no one was leaving unscathed.

The sun had barely risen when Evelyn woke with a start.

Her first thought was of Ethan. She needed to get to the hospital—needed to be by his side.

After everything that had happened between them, she knew he must despise her. But illness made people vulnerable. Maybe, just maybe, this was her chance to fix things.

"You?" Eleanor arched a brow, her voice sharp. "Stay home. You’ll only make it worse."

Evelyn opened her mouth to protest, but Eleanor was already gone, the ambulance doors slamming shut behind her.

As the crowd thinned, Alexander’s expression darkened like a storm rolling in.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn, burning with barely restrained fury.

"Alexander…" She reached for him, fingers brushing his sleeve.

He jerked away before she could touch him.

That’s when she knew—he wasn’t just annoyed. He was angry.

"Alexander, please—"

She didn’t understand. He was always so patient with her. Why was tonight different?

What had she even done wrong?

In a situation like that, how could anyone expect her to just stand by and—

Nothing?

Evelyn's thoughts raced. "Could Alexander truly be this possessive?"

The moment Alexander stormed off, the garden plunged into unsettling silence, leaving only Evelyn and Vanessa behind.

Vanessa's lips curled into a taunting smirk. "Seems like you're losing Alexander's favor. Once that's gone, who'll protect you then?"

Evelyn's eyes flashed with defiance. "And you, Vanessa? You poisoned your own husband. Quite the accomplishment. Ethan might be too weak to confront you tonight, but just wait until he recovers. You should be terrified of what's coming."

When Evelyn finally returned to their suite, Alexander had already vanished.

This wasn't just irritation—it was fury. He'd abandoned her in the dead of night without a second glance.

###Chapter 372 A Business Trip

The sun had long set when Evelyn realized her predicament. Having arrived at Whitmore Manor in Alexander's car earlier, she now found herself stranded—taxis were nearly impossible to find in the gated estate at this hour.

She sank into the plush mattress, the sheets still carrying the faint warmth and lingering scent of their earlier intimacy.

Alexander's face flashed in her mind.

After all this time together, Evelyn couldn't deny it anymore—she had fallen hopelessly in love with him.

Whatever fleeting connection she once had with Ethan Caldwell was dead and buried. That was why she hadn't hesitated to help Alexander earlier.

But clearly, he didn't see it that way.

A dull ache pulsed behind her temples. How could she possibly regain his trust?

The holidays were over, and tomorrow she'd be returning to Titan Capital Group.

Evelyn arrived at the office before dawn, hoping to catch Alexander before the workday began.

His office stood empty.

She settled into his chair, waiting.

Sleep had evaded her last night, her mind racing with unanswered questions—

After days of contemplation, Evelyn finally resolved to confess her feelings to Alexander.

He made her feel alive.

She adored his commanding presence, the way his strong arms made her feel protected. Every second in his company anchored her soul.

Their time together had cemented one undeniable truth—Alexander Whitmore now held the most sacred place in her heart.

The memory of him charging into danger to save her during the kidnapping still sent shivers down her spine. That single act had deepened her devotion beyond measure.

If what she once felt for Ethan had been youthful infatuation, what she harbored for Alexander now was something far more potent—reverence, passion, and an unshakable trust.

But when she waited in his office for over an hour, well past his usual punctual arrival, there was no sign of him.

Alexander, who prided himself on never being late, was conspicuously absent.

Natalie entered to retrieve some files, pausing when she noticed Evelyn.

"You've been here this whole time? I assumed you'd be running late. Are you waiting for Mr. Whitmore?" She tilted her head. "He left for a business trip early this morning. Didn’t he tell you?"

Evelyn’s breath caught.

No. He hadn’t.

The question lingered in Evelyn's mind like an unwelcome guest. "Did Alexander truly leave for a business trip, or was this just his way of avoiding me after our argument?"

She bit her lip, the uncertainty gnawing at her.

Unable to focus, she slipped into the break room and dialed Alexander’s number.

Silence.

No answer.

Her shoulders slumped slightly as she scrolled through last night’s group chat, her fingers pausing over the message confirming Alexander had flown to Cresthaven.

Maybe he’s still in the air, she reasoned, forcing herself to push the doubts aside.

Just then, her phone buzzed—Margaret’s name flashed across the screen.

"Evelyn, why don’t you bring Alexander over for dinner tonight?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Margaret quickly added, "Your father won’t be there. Richard made sure of that."

The implication was clear—without Richard’s presence, there’d be no pressure for Alexander to discuss Titan Capital Group or Horizon Enterprises.

Evelyn exhaled softly. "Alexander’s away on business."

"Then come by yourself," Margaret insisted. "I’ll have Oliver pick you up after work."

Evelyn hesitated only a moment before agreeing.

The sun was dipping below the skyscrapers as the workday ended.

A sleek, limited-edition Lamborghini pulled up in front of Titan Capital Group, its engine purring like a contented beast.

Oliver Hayes leaned against the hood, his black hoodie casting shadows over his sharp features. The hood was drawn low, but it did nothing to hide the magnetic energy radiating from him.

This was the financial district—full of suits and polished shoes.

A guy like Oliver, young, effortlessly cool, and leaning against a car worth more than most annual salaries?

He was impossible to ignore.

Whispers followed him like a trail of smoke.

But Oliver didn’t care.

A lollipop dangled from his lips, the cherry-red candy clicking against his teeth as he kept his gaze locked on the glass doors of Titan Capital.

He was waiting.

And the entire street knew it.

###Chapter 373 Nathan Cornered

The moment Evelyn exited Titan Capital Group, Alexander sped toward her in his sleek black Lamborghini.

Grace, lingering nearby, gaped at the striking young man bathed in golden sunset light.

Only when the sports car roared away did she finally blink back to reality.

Was that Evelyn’s brother?

Her pulse quickened as she replayed the image—Oliver leaning lazily against the car, a cherry lollipop dangling between his lips like he owned the world.

Heat rushed to her cheeks. She shook her head violently, snapping herself out of the trance.

Damn it!

I got so distracted I forgot why I came here!

Ethan had been comatose since his midnight hospitalization. A full twenty-four hours passed before he stirred that evening.

Now, he lay motionless, refusing food, water, even words—a hollow shell of the ruthless businessman he once was.

The machines beeped around him, the only proof he was still alive.

Grace bit her lip, guilt gnawing at her.

This is all my fault.

She reached for her phone, fingers trembling.

I need to fix this.

Before it’s too late.

The sunlight streamed through the car window, warm against Evelyn's skin.

But her thoughts had wandered too far, and now she'd lost sight of where Margaret had gone.

Stepping out of the car, Evelyn immediately spotted Richard standing outside, locked in a heated argument with Margaret.

"How dare you show your face here!" Margaret's voice trembled with fury. "Did you sign the divorce papers yet?"

Her eyes were bloodshot, her hands clenched into fists. "Every time I see you, I want to strangle you with my bare hands! Get out!"

Without hesitation, she grabbed a broom from a nearby maid and swung it at Richard with all her strength.

"Margaret, please! Listen to me!" Richard dodged, desperation lacing his words. "I've been staying at a hotel for days. We've been married for decades—can you really just erase all of that?"

"And what did you give me in return?" Margaret spat, her voice raw with betrayal. "You stole my child! What else is left for me to cherish?"

"It wasn't me!" Richard's hands rose in defense. "It was Evelyn Sinclair! She switched them behind my back—I only found out later!"

"What does it matter?" Margaret's grip on the broom tightened. "You both deceived me! You cheated, you used my money to fund your affair, and now you expect forgiveness? You're delusional!"

"I've cut all ties with her!" Richard insisted, his voice breaking. "Three days—I haven't seen her once! Please, Margaret, just one more chance. I don’t want a divorce!"

Margaret's lips curled into a bitter smile.

"Too late."

She raised the broom again.

This time, Richard didn't dodge.

Richard couldn't fathom how his thirty-year marriage was crumbling over this scandal.

The first workday after the holidays began with uneasy glances the moment he stepped into Horizon Enterprises.

Whispers slithered through the corridors like snakes.

As CEO, his authority had dissolved overnight.

The affair with Evelyn Sinclair and the twisted secret of their swapped daughters had exploded into public spectacle. Business partners were fleeing—termination notices piled on his desk like funeral wreaths.

Online, the mob raged. Competitors stoked the flames. Social media erupted with vows to boycott Horizon Enterprises forever.

Alexander Whitmore had already crippled him earlier this year. Now, this new disgrace...

By noon, stocks had nosedived. Richard was drowning.

The internet had unearthed every skeleton in his closet. If he didn’t salvage this fast, his father’s empire would be dust.

Divorcing Margaret wasn’t an option.

Evelyn Sinclair had been a fleeting indulgence. Even Vanessa—

He would never choose Evelyn Sinclair over Margaret.

Margaret came from old money, while Evelyn was just a gold-digging mistress with empty hands. Richard knew exactly where his bread was buttered.

His desperate gaze locked onto Margaret. "What do I need to do to make you take me back?"

Over Richard's shoulder, Margaret spotted Evelyn Carter approaching through the garden.

"You want redemption?" Margaret's lips curled into a cold smile. "Simple. Renounce Vanessa Hart as your daughter before the entire family. Cast her out of Hawthorne Estate. Then... maybe I'll think about it."

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love After Betrayal (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 374 Are You Expecting?

Margaret's demand visibly shocked Richard.

Had she just asked him to banish Vanessa from the Hawthorne Estate?

"But Vanessa is our daughter. We raised her ourselves. How could we possibly cast her out? Margaret, could you truly do that?"

"Why wouldn't I?"

Margaret let out a bitter laugh. "Evelyn Sinclair, your mistress, swapped my child, and Vanessa stole my daughter's rightful place. Why should I show her any mercy?"

Maybe she had once loved Vanessa.

But the moment she discovered Vanessa—Evelyn's flesh and blood—had been deceiving her while secretly aiding Evelyn, all she felt was revulsion.

She couldn't think of a single way she had wronged Vanessa.

Yet Vanessa had leeched off her like a parasite, draining her dry, all while using the resources Margaret provided to fund Evelyn. The sheer audacity!

Richard attempted to appeal to Margaret's lingering maternal instincts. "Without our support, Vanessa will struggle terribly alone at Whitmore Manor!"

And now, with the truth exposed—

Eleanor had always despised Vanessa. If the Hayes family publicly disowned her now, wouldn't that be rubbing salt in the wound?

Richard couldn't possibly be that heartless. After all, Vanessa was his own flesh and blood.

Meanwhile, he conveniently forgot how tight-fisted she'd been when he'd begged her for financial help.

Margaret scoffed bitterly. "Well, Vanessa's going through a rough patch. Since you're so reluctant and sympathetic, stop bothering me here. Get out! Go comfort her immediately!"

She shoved Richard toward the door just as Evelyn and Oliver entered.

Spotting them, Richard blurted, "Your mother wants a divorce! Talk some sense into her! At her age, demanding separation is ridiculous. Won't we become laughingstocks? A split would damage your reputations too."

Evelyn didn't even glance his way as she strode past into Hawthorne Estate.

Oliver studied his father with cold detachment.

"Richard, Mother gave you a choice. You refused. Since you can't bear to cut ties with Vanessa, go live with her and Sandra permanently."

"But I'm your father!" Richard's voice cracked. "You'd really cast me out like this?"

The afternoon sunlight cast long shadows across the marble foyer, illuminating the dust motes swirling between them - a fitting metaphor for their disintegrating family bonds.

Evelyn paused halfway up the staircase, her grip tightening on the wrought-iron railing. Without turning, she uttered words that sliced deeper than any blade: "You stopped being our father the moment you chose her over us."

Oliver stepped forward, his polished Oxfords clicking against the tiles. "The lawyers will contact you tomorrow. Don't bother coming back."

As the heavy oak door slammed shut, Richard stood frozen on the manicured lawn, the autumn wind carrying away the last remnants of his delusions. Inside, the grandfather clock chimed four times - the death knell of his marriage.

Somewhere in Kingsdom, Vanessa's phone buzzed with an incoming call she wouldn't answer. The universe had a cruel sense of irony; the daughter he'd sacrificed everything for couldn't even spare him five minutes.

Upstairs, Evelyn collapsed onto her bed, pressing a shaking hand to her abdomen. The pregnancy test hidden under her pillow burned like a secret against the satin sheets. Would history repeat itself? Would her child someday look at her with the same betrayal she'd shown Richard?

Outside, storm clouds gathered.

"You..."

The door slammed shut with finality as Oliver turned the lock, leaving Richard standing alone in the hallway once again.

He exhaled heavily, staring out at the quiet night. A wave of loneliness washed over him, sharp and unexpected, like a traveler stranded far from home.

Inside, the dining table was meticulously set with Evelyn’s favorite dishes—each one prepared with care by Margaret.

Even after over a decade of being back with the Hayes family, this was the first time Evelyn had been treated like an honored guest.

Yet, she barely touched her food, her appetite clearly absent.

Margaret frowned. "Is something wrong, Evelyn? Do the dishes not suit your taste?"

Evelyn shook her head slightly. A full day had passed, and Alexander still hadn’t returned her calls.

He was supposed to be on a business trip, but by now, his flight should have landed.

The flight from here to Cresthaven only took two hours. Was he still angry?

"Try the tortilla soup," Margaret urged gently. "I had the chef prepare it specially—it's very nourishing."

Margaret carefully set a steaming bowl of tortilla soup before Evelyn. The rich aroma of spices filled the air between them.

Evelyn's face suddenly paled. She clapped a hand over her mouth, her body convulsing with sudden nausea.

Margaret froze mid-motion, her eyes widening in realization. The spoon she'd been holding clattered against the ceramic bowl.

"Evelyn?" Margaret's voice trembled with sudden hope. "Darling... could this be...?"

The kitchen fell silent except for Evelyn's shallow breaths as she fought to compose herself. Her free hand instinctively moved to her still-flat stomach.

Margaret's gaze dropped to where Evelyn's fingers rested protectively. A slow, knowing smile spread across her face. "Oh my stars... are we expecting?"

Evelyn swallowed hard, her cheeks flushing pink. She opened her mouth to respond, but no words came out. The possibility hung between them like a delicate soap bubble - beautiful, fragile, and utterly life-changing.

###Chapter 375 Why Didn't You Warn Me?

Pregnant?

Evelyn's monthly cycle had been irregular this month, delayed by nearly a week.

The possibility hadn't even crossed her mind.

The traumatic kidnapping ordeal had wreaked havoc on her emotions and hormones - she'd assumed the missed period was just stress-related.

Her fingers twitched with the instinct to check her own pulse, but she quickly dismissed the absurd thought. Even doctors couldn't properly diagnose themselves.

"Evelyn darling, we're going straight to the hospital after lunch!" Margaret practically vibrated with excitement.

After weeks of turmoil, this potential good news felt like sunlight breaking through storm clouds.

Knowing medical confirmation was necessary, Evelyn didn't protest.

They finished their meal quickly and drove to Cresthaven General.

Margaret took charge with military efficiency, settling Evelyn in the waiting area before marching off to handle registration.

The blood test results would take an hour. Margaret fidgeted impatiently, then suddenly brightened. "Let's go—"

The waiting room TV flickered with breaking news. Evelyn's breath caught as Alexander Whitmore's face filled the screen.

Evelyn wasn't in the mood. She told Margaret to go without her.

Margaret suspected Evelyn might be in early pregnancy and needed special care, so she didn't insist. "Stay put. I won't be long," she cautioned before leaving.

Alone, Evelyn scrolled through her phone absentmindedly. Her fingers hovered over Alexander's contact before she switched to messaging Simon instead.

[Did you reach Cresthaven safely?]

His reply came instantly: [Yes, Mrs. Whitmore. How may I assist you?]

[Alexander...] Evelyn started typing about his unanswered calls, then deleted it. Simon was merely an assistant - these matters weren't his concern.

[Never mind. Just checking in.] She sent the vague reply.

Across town, Simon trailed behind Alexander as they prepared for a business dinner. Pocketing his phone without another thought, he nearly missed the way Alexander's gaze lingered on his screen.

A knowing smile curved Alexander's lips. Had his wife really resorted to contacting his assistant when she couldn't reach him?

The realization sent an unexpected warmth through his chest. Even through her stubborn independence, Evelyn still sought connection. He'd have to remedy this communication gap soon - just not yet. Let her wonder a little longer.

Alexander adjusted his cufflinks, already anticipating their next encounter. She'd either scold him for ignoring her or pretend nothing happened. Both possibilities amused him equally.

"It's quite troublesome," Alexander suddenly remarked. "My wife insists on knowing my whereabouts even when I'm traveling for work."

Simon paused, glancing at Alexander in surprise.

The man was practically glowing with satisfaction. This wasn't a complaint—it was a blatant boast about Evelyn's devotion to him.

Though taken aback, Simon maintained his professional composure. "Mr. Whitmore, as an unmarried man, how could I possibly anticipate this and remind you?"

"True enough." Alexander nodded, eyeing Simon with exaggerated sympathy. "I heard about your recent breakup. Must be peaceful traveling alone without anyone checking on you."

Simon clenched his jaw.

Enough already. I get it. Stop rubbing salt in the wound.

Meanwhile, Evelyn exhaled in relief after receiving Alexander's safe arrival message.

As she pocketed her phone, movement near the emergency entrance caught her eye.

Vanessa staggered inside, clutching her bleeding forehead while Richard hovered anxiously beside her. Crimson streaks painted her fingers—the injury looked serious.

"I'm taking them to court! They've completely ruined my life!"

Evelyn Sinclair sobbed hysterically before Richard Hayes, her mascara streaking down her bruised face. "First they destroyed my boutique last week, and now this violent assault! Why did you interfere? I need to file charges immediately!"

"Stop this nonsense!" Richard snapped, running a hand through his graying hair. The confrontation with Margaret at Hawthorne Estate still burned in his memory when Evelyn's frantic call had interrupted him.

Her dramatic claims of lying in a pool of blood had dragged him here, only to find her with nothing but superficial scratches.

"Call the police? Have you no shame left?" His voice dripped with contempt. The stench of cheap perfume mixed with alcohol made his stomach churn.

Evelyn clutched her designer handbag like a shield. "You're supposed to protect me! After everything I've sacrificed—"

"Protect you?" Richard's laugh was bitter. "From the consequences of your own schemes?"

The diamond bracelet on Evelyn's wrist caught the fluorescent light - the same one Vanessa had "borrowed" from Margaret's collection last month. The pieces connected in his mind with sickening clarity.

Outside the clinic window, ambulance sirens wailed. Somewhere in Cresthaven, real emergencies were happening while he wasted time on this theatrics.

Evelyn opened her mouth to protest, but Richard was already turning away. The revolving door spat him back into the crisp autumn air, where the scent of maple leaves offered temporary relief from the toxicity inside.

His phone buzzed - another message from Vanessa. He deleted it without reading. The Hayes family had bled enough because of these women.

As his chauffeur opened the car door, Richard allowed himself one glance back at the clinic. Through the glass, Evelyn was already reapplying lipstick, her earlier distress forgotten. The performance would continue, with or without his participation.

This time, he chose to exit stage left.

###Chapter 376 How Rude!

Richard Hayes was already in a difficult position. He hadn't planned to see Evelyn Sinclair at such a crucial moment, but when he heard she was on the brink of death, he couldn’t just walk away.

A group of aggressive internet trolls had stormed into her apartment, attacking her under the guise of confronting the "other woman."

The injuries weren’t life-threatening, but in the chaos, Evelyn had lost her footing—her head slamming against the sharp edge of a coffee table.

Richard rushed her to the hospital without hesitation.

From a distance, Evelyn Carter watched them with a bitter smirk. How touching.

She strode forward, her heels clicking sharply against the tiled floor. "My mother is taking a stroll just outside this hospital. Are you seriously still refusing to sign the divorce papers? And yet here you are, tangled up with her again?"

Richard froze at the sight of his daughter, guilt flashing across his face as if he’d been caught red-handed.

"Evelyn, she was hurt. I just brought her here. There’s nothing between us—don’t mention this to your mother!"

"Evelyn?"

Her laugh was cold, dripping with disdain.

"Evelyn Carter!"

"Vanessa, you're absolutely vile."

Evelyn Sinclair seethed with anger. "I am Vanessa's real mother. What's wrong with him showing concern for me? Clearly, Beatrice didn’t raise you properly. You have no manners!"

"Who do you think you are? Don’t call me Evelyn. We aren’t acquainted. My respect is reserved for decent people, not shameless harlots."

"What did you just call me? A harlot?" Evelyn Sinclair’s temper flared instantly.

"I was being generous. Maybe you don’t even deserve that."

"You—!"

Already incensed after someone had stormed into her home and injured her, Evelyn Sinclair hadn’t anticipated being humiliated at the hospital too.

Her fury burned hotter than ever.

"Richard," she whimpered, turning tearful eyes toward him, desperate for his sympathy.

He frowned, thinking Evelyn Carter’s words had been unnecessarily cruel.

"Evelyn, what’s gotten into you? Evelyn Sinclair is your elder."

"Apologize to her? Who do you think you are to demand that of me?" Evelyn scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "The whole world knows I've cut ties with you, Richard. Are you still living in some delusional fantasy?"

Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and strode away, her posture rigid with defiance.

The bitterness toward Evelyn Sinclair ran deep. Over two decades ago, it was because of her that Evelyn had been cast out, replaced by Vanessa Hart.

Yet here she was, acting as if she had any right to lecture her. The audacity was almost laughable.

"Richard, is she truly your flesh and blood?" Evelyn Sinclair gasped, clutching her chest dramatically. "Vanessa has always been so respectful and obedient. This—this is unacceptable!"

Richard Hayes' expression darkened. Evelyn's blatant disregard for him in front of Evelyn Sinclair was a slap to his pride.

When he reached out to stop her, she sidestepped him effortlessly, her movements sharp and deliberate.

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't resist fanning the flames. "Evelyn, you are beyond rude! How dare you treat your own father with such disrespect? After everything he's done for you—"

Her shrill voice grated on Evelyn's nerves. In one swift motion, Evelyn seized her jaw, her fingers tightening with calculated precision.

A sharp crack echoed through the air.

Evelyn Sinclair's eyes widened in shock as a searing pain shot through her face. Her hands flew to her jaw, only to realize—it wouldn't close.

Dislocated.

Just like that.

Evelyn smirked, releasing her grip. "Now that was impolite."

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After...

###Chapter 377 A Passionate Reckoning

Evelyn's face twisted in agony as she desperately tried to clamp her mouth shut, but her jaw refused to obey. Saliva spilled uncontrollably from her lips in an undignified stream.

"Richard..." Her pleading eyes locked onto Richard with pathetic desperation.

Vanessa watched with dark amusement as the viscous trail of drool splattered onto the polished floor. Having trained in martial arts, she knew precisely how to manipulate pressure points for maximum effect. Who knew those skills would prove so useful in high society?

"Someone fetch a doctor for your mistress," Vanessa sneered, flicking her gaze toward Richard with undisguised contempt. "Unless you enjoy watching her decorate the floor like a leaky faucet."

Richard's face purpled with rage. This vulgar display shattered every expectation of aristocratic decorum. His elegant wife had transformed into some back-alley brawler before his eyes.

His palm itched to strike her insolent face, but before he could act, Margaret came charging like a vengeful hurricane.

"Richard Hayes, you spineless worm! How dare you lay hands on my daughter!"

Snatching a mop from a gaping janitor, Margaret swung the sodden head at Richard's torso with terrifying precision. He barely dodged the first strike, but Margaret pursued him relentlessly across the marble foyer, her fury giving her unnatural speed. The wooden handle whistled through the air as she aimed for his kneecaps with terrifying accuracy.

Vanessa watched the chaotic scene unfold before her with a resigned sigh.

She considered interrupting Margaret, but seeing how fiercely her mother was berating Richard while gripping his collar, Vanessa thought better of disturbing them.

The printer hummed softly as it produced her test results. She collected the papers and approached the physician.

The doctor scanned the report quickly before smiling. "Ms. Carter, wonderful news. You're expecting."

Vanessa froze, the words echoing in her ears. Pregnant.

"Approximately three weeks along. Get plenty of rest. If nausea becomes severe, try ginger tea or probiotic drinks."

She nodded absently, fingers trembling around the crisp paper.

Her first instinct was to call Alexander.

But remembering their recent argument and his stubborn silence, she doubted he'd answer. The revelation could wait until his return.

Except it couldn't.

The overwhelming joy propelled her toward the airport ticket counter. One way to Cresthaven. Now.

Her heels clicked urgently across the linoleum, each step carrying her closer to the man whose child grew inside her. She'd surprise him at Horizon Enterprises, consequences be damned.

The cab ride passed in a blur of nervous anticipation. Her palm rested unconsciously over her abdomen as skyscrapers loomed ahead.

Soon, Alexander would know.

Soon, everything would change.

Her fingers flew across the phone screen, securing the first flight out at dawn.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the hospital corridor, a familiar voice froze her in her tracks.

"Evelyn."

Ethan Caldwell stood there, his usually composed gaze now wild and bloodshot. Before she could react, he seized her wrist, yanking her into the deserted stairwell. The emergency door slammed shut behind them with finality.

He caged her against the concrete wall, his palms slamming beside her head. His chest rose and fell with ragged breaths that smelled of whiskey and desperation.

Then he moved.

Without warning, Ethan crushed his mouth against hers in a kiss that tasted like possession and punishment.

Evelyn twisted away, but he caught her chin, forcing her to meet his burning gaze. His other arm banded around her waist, pulling her flush against him.

He'd wanted this since last night.

Since hearing those breathy moans through Alexander's bedroom door. The sounds Evelyn had never made for him in seven years of waiting. Seven years of playing the gentleman while Alexander Whitmore took what Ethan had been too cautious to claim.

The irony choked him.

All those nights he'd spent resisting temptation, only for his rival to claim his prize in a single evening. The thought drove him madder than the bourbon still coursing through his veins.

His arms wrapped around her with desperate intensity, his eyes burning with raw emotion.

"Evelyn, I know he forced you into this. Walk away from him."

Confusion flickered across Evelyn's face.

"Let's disappear together—somewhere no one knows us." His voice cracked. "Just you and me, far from Alexander, Vanessa, and the Whitmore legacy. I don't care about power or money anymore... only you."

Ethan's tears soaked into the fabric of her dress, warm and trembling.

###Chapter 378 My Reasons Are My Own

Ethan Caldwell never imagined he'd one day kneel so low, weeping desperately for a woman.

In his arms, Evelyn Carter instinctively raised her hand to strike him.

But his tears made her hesitate.

She exhaled sharply. "Ethan, Alexander didn't force me. I chose this. My heart belongs to him now."

"You're lying!" His eyes burned with unshed tears. "You can't just stop loving me! Evelyn, we're alone here. Say the word, and I'll take you away—forever!"

His voice trembled with raw desperation.

Forever.

The word almost made her laugh.

She pushed away from him. "You promise me forever, but what about Vanessa?"

"I despise her! I never loved her! Don't even say her name!" The venom in his voice was unmistakable.

"If you hate her so much, then testify against her. She orchestrated that kidnapping three years ago. She worked with Damian to ruin me."

The air between them grew heavier.

Ethan's jaw clenched. "You know I can't."

"Because you're still protecting her." Evelyn's voice turned icy.

"No! Because I have my reasons!"

She studied him—the man she once thought she knew. Now, he was a stranger.

"Reasons?" She tilted her head. "Or excuses?"

His silence answered for him.

Evelyn turned away. "Then we have nothing left to say."

His hand shot out, gripping her wrist. "Wait—"

She didn't look back. "Let go, Ethan."

His fingers tightened. "I can't lose you again."

"You already did."

With that, she pulled free and walked away, leaving him standing there—alone, just as he'd left her three years ago.

The irony wasn't lost on her.

Some wounds never truly healed.

And some choices couldn't be undone.

Ethan Caldwell altered his statement the moment he stepped into the police station, and you deliberately withheld crucial information from the authorities. Essentially, you gave Vanessa Hart a free pass."

Evelyn Carter lifted her gaze to meet Ethan's. "You claim to despise her, yet you show her mercy. Doesn't that strike you as absurd?"

He clenched his jaw. "I have my justifications!"

"Justifications?" Her laugh was bitter. "What could they possibly be? Is it because she's carrying your child? Or are you simply too weak-willed to act? Has your mother been pressuring you again? You're married to her now, yet here you are, chasing after me. I beg you—stay with her forever. Do us all a favor."

Without another word, Evelyn turned on her heel, her expression frosty.

"Evelyn! Just let me explain—"

"Enough." She didn't even glance back. "Stop this pathetic charade, Ethan. I've made myself clear—I love Alexander. We're over. Your persistence only makes me lose respect for you."

As she strode away, Ethan's bloodshot eyes burned into her retreating figure.

"Then why are you here, Evelyn?" His voice cracked. "You came to the hospital because you were worried about me, didn't you?"

"Your arrogance is astounding." She paused just long enough to throw the words over her shoulder. "I came for my own medical appointment. It has nothing to do with you."

The color drained from his face. In three long strides, he caught up to her, gripping her wrist. "You're sick? What's wrong?" The panic in his voice was raw, unguarded.

The memory of Evelyn emerging from the gynecology ward flashed through his mind, and realization struck like lightning.

His gaze dropped to her abdomen, shock widening his eyes. "Evelyn... are you expecting?"

Evelyn had no intention of confiding in Ethan.

She had already secured a dawn flight to Cresthaven, desperate to deliver the news to Alexander in person.

Her fingers brushed the emergency exit handle when Ethan's arms suddenly locked around her waist from behind.

A startled gasp escaped her as she instinctively drove her heel into his foot.

"Have you lost your mind? I'm Alexander's wife!"

"Evelyn, don't be angry." His breath was hot against her ear. "His wife? Do you honestly believe he loves you? You're just a pawn to him."

"What nonsense are you spouting?"

"You're so naive." His grip tightened. "Why do you think Alexander Whitmore married you? It's certainly not because—"

"I don't want to hear another word!" Evelyn wrenched free and delivered a stinging slap across his face.

###Chapter 379 His Precious Obsession

Evelyn summoned every ounce of her strength, her palm connecting sharply with Ethan’s cheek. The slap left a vivid red mark across his flawless skin.

"Stay away from me," she hissed, her voice trembling with fury. "This is your last warning."

Ethan’s expression darkened, his eyes turning stormy. The sting on his face was nothing compared to the ache in his chest.

She fought him like a caged animal, desperate to sever all ties between them.

But Ethan would never allow that.

A bitter chuckle escaped his lips. "You leave me no choice, Evelyn."

Before she could react, two towering bodyguards emerged from the stairwell, cutting off her escape.

Evelyn staggered back, her pulse racing. "What are you doing?"

His voice was raw with emotion. "You’re destroying me. What else can I do? I love you too much to let you go."

The bodyguards closed in, their presence suffocating.

Evelyn collapsed onto the cold concrete floor.

Nathan moved swiftly, his arms outstretched to catch her before she hit the ground.

Darkness swallowed her consciousness.

The narrow stairwell was now crowded with men, blocking any possible escape.

Nathan gazed down at Evelyn with a look of possessive adoration, as if she were a rare jewel he had finally claimed.

"Evelyn." His fingers traced the curve of her cheek with unsettling tenderness.

"This time, you won’t slip away from me again."

A sudden thud echoed from the door behind them—someone was forcing their way in.

Nathan’s expression darkened.

He had known for a while that someone was always watching over Evelyn from the shadows.

Out of respect for her independence—or perhaps out of fear of crossing a line—the mysterious protector kept his distance.

But Evelyn’s prolonged absence had clearly triggered his instincts.

Nathan suspected this was one of Alexander’s men, sent to guard her.

The two bodyguards exchanged knowing glances.

Having served Ethan Caldwell for years, they immediately grasped his unspoken command.

Ethan strode away with Evelyn Carter by his side.

The bodyguards lit cigarettes, leaning casually against the stairwell as they began to talk.

"After seven years with Mr. Caldwell, there's no way she's over him."

"Of course not. He was her first love. They were inseparable. She only married Alexander Whitmore out of spite when Ethan got involved with Vanessa Hart."

The man in black paused just outside the door, his hand freezing mid-motion.

"She must regret it now. That's why she's running back to Ethan, isn't it?"

"Obviously. You don't just walk away from a bond like theirs. Good thing she's leaving Alexander. There was never any real love there anyway. What's the point?"

The pieces clicked into place for the eavesdropper.

So this was why Evelyn had vanished without a trace.

She had orchestrated her disappearance to escape Alexander—only to reunite with Ethan.

His jaw tightened.

Without another word, he turned and walked away.

The silence stretched on for what felt like an eternity.

The two bodyguards exchanged glances, their ears straining for any sound from the other side of the door.

Nothing.

Not a whisper. Not a breath.

Satisfied, the taller one smirked and reached for the handle.

The room was empty.

Just as they had planned.

A low chuckle escaped the first bodyguard as he shook his head. "Damn, we're good. That performance deserved an Oscar."

His partner pulled out a cigarette, lighting it with a flick of his wrist. He took a long drag before grinning. "Seriously. Even I almost believed we were about to get our asses handed to us."

They both laughed, the tension melting away.

The shorter one nudged his companion. "Ethan Caldwell better give us a raise after this."

"Better be a damn big one," the other agreed, exhaling smoke. "That was next-level acting."

They leaned against the wall, basking in their victory.

For now, at least, their deception had worked perfectly.

But little did they know—their triumph wouldn't last.

###Chapter 380 A Peculiar Encounter

Just then, Margaret happened to walk past the two security guards stationed outside.

Her nose wrinkled in distaste as she caught the acrid scent of cigarette smoke. She fixed the offending guard with a sharp glare.

"This is the maternity ward—a strictly non-smoking zone," she snapped, crossing her arms. "Have you no common decency?"

The guard startled, hastily stubbing out his cigarette against the sole of his shoe. "My apologies, ma'am. It won't happen again."

Fresh from her confrontation with Richard, Margaret was riding high on adrenaline. She settled for a warning glare before striding away, the encounter already fading from her mind.

After combing through every corridor and waiting area without spotting Evelyn, Margaret decided to check the physician's office.

The doctor looked up from her charts with a polite smile. "Mrs. Carter left nearly an hour ago."

Margaret's brows knitted together. That made no sense—why would Evelyn leave without telling her?

Pulling out her phone, she dialed Evelyn's number with quick, agitated taps.

Two rings. Then—silence.

The call had been declined.

A cold trickle of unease slid down Margaret's spine. Her fingers flew across the screen.

[Evelyn? Where are you? I've searched the entire hospital.]

The three blinking dots appeared... then vanished without reply.

The world around her faded into darkness as she slipped into unconsciousness, completely unaware of Margaret's repeated calls.

Ethan Caldwell gently placed Evelyn Carter in the backseat, securing her seatbelt with meticulous care.

Worried she might feel discomfort during the drive, he tucked a soft pillow behind her back, ensuring she remained as comfortable as possible.

Only when he was certain she was settled did he allow himself to exhale in relief.

Her phone buzzed incessantly from her pocket. Ethan retrieved it, unlocked it with her fingerprint, and swiftly typed a reply to Margaret: [Don’t wait for me. I’ve already left. You should head home too.]

Margaret’s next message made his blood run cold: [What were the test results? Are you pregnant?]

Ethan’s eyes darkened dangerously as his gaze dropped to Evelyn’s abdomen.

So, she had come to the hospital for that reason.

He reached into her shirt pocket and pulled out the medical report.

The moment his eyes scanned the results, his expression twisted into something unrecognizable.

Evelyn was carrying Alexander Whitmore’s child.

A surge of fury burned through him, his vision tinting red. His fist slammed into the front seat with enough force to make the driver flinch.

The man behind the wheel stiffened, holding his breath as tension thickened the air.

Moments later, Ethan's fingers tightened around Evelyn's phone as he typed a single word: [No.]

Without hesitation, he changed her passcode and slid the device into his jacket pocket.

On the other end of the line, Margaret's shoulders slumped in disappointment.

She had been so sure Evelyn was expecting.

At dinner, the nausea had been overwhelming—how could it not have been pregnancy?

But she was still young.

She and Alexander had only been married six months. There was no need to rush.

Sighing, Margaret tucked her phone away and descended the hospital steps.

Her gaze flickered to the parking lot, where a sleek black van had just pulled in.

Ethan stepped out, his expression unreadable.

Margaret's lips pressed into a thin line.

The memory of his betrayal—his affair with Vanessa, the way he'd shattered Evelyn's heart—flared hot in her chest.

And now? He was Vanessa's husband.

Ethan didn’t notice her.

Good.

She had no intention of speaking to him.

Turning sharply, she strode to her car without a backward glance.

Evelyn Carter remained completely unaware that Vanessa Hart, unconscious and motionless, lay hidden in the backseat of the van Ethan Caldwell had just exited.

Both vehicles roared to life simultaneously, their engines humming as they departed the hospital grounds one after another.

Meanwhile, Alexander Whitmore had just concluded a business dinner, his mind foggy from one too many glasses of whiskey. His phone buzzed insistently in his pocket—Simon Graves, his ever-vigilant bodyguard, was calling.

Alexander fumbled with his phone, his fingers sluggish from alcohol. The call connected, but before Simon could relay his urgent message, the screen went black.

Battery dead.

Groaning, Alexander pressed a hand to his throbbing temple and glared at the useless device.

Who had been calling him at this hour?

###Chapter 381 Return to Cresthaven

Alexander Whitmore barely registered the buzzing of his phone.

Simon Graves noticed his dazed state and quickly guided him into the waiting car. "Mr. Whitmore, let's get you back to the hotel to rest."

"Fine." Alexander was too far gone to argue.

The next morning, the throbbing in his temples announced his hangover before he even opened his eyes.

He dragged himself upright and reached for a glass of water. As the cool liquid soothed his throat, a nagging thought surfaced—something important had slipped his mind.

His phone.

Fumbling for it, he vaguely recalled a call last night, one that had ended abruptly.

The name on the screen sent a jolt through him—the bodyguard assigned to protect Evelyn Carter.

Alexander hit redial immediately.

The line connected at once. The bodyguard relayed everything he'd overheard the previous night.

Alexander's expression darkened with each word.

His grip tightened unconsciously. The glass in his hand shattered under the pressure, shards biting into his palm.

Blood welled up, dripping steadily onto the floor.

The crimson droplets splattered across the marble floor.

"Mr. Whitmore, are you alright?" Simon's voice trembled as he reached for the phone. "I'll call for medical assistance immediately."

"Don't." Alexander's tone was razor-sharp. "Book the next flight back to Cresthaven."

Simon froze. "But sir, the meeting with the Aetherland delegates—they've already arrived at the conference center. This deal is crucial for Titan Capital's expansion—"

Alexander's jaw tightened, his knuckles whitening around the shattered glass in his palm. "Did I stutter?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Get me on that plane."

Simon swallowed hard.

This wasn't like Alexander. The man was legendary for his ruthless professionalism. The Aetherland negotiation had been in the works for eighteen months—a make-or-break opportunity to secure Titan Capital's foothold in the European markets.

To abandon it now? Unthinkable.

Yet the blood dripping onto Alexander's custom Tom Ford oxfords told a different story. Something had shattered his legendary composure.

And Simon knew better than to ask twice.

Punctuality was sacred in international business. One missed meeting could mean losing a potential partner forever.

Alexander Whitmore wasn’t the type to act impulsively, yet Simon Graves sensed something dire must have occurred to make him abandon negotiations mid-session.

He booked the first flight back to Cresthaven without hesitation.

Seated in the cabin, Alexander scrolled through his call log. Evelyn Carter had tried reaching him relentlessly yesterday, but he’d ignored every attempt in his fury.

A faint smile touched his lips. She’d been worried enough to contact Simon behind his back.

At least someone still cared.

He’d orchestrated everything perfectly—a grand homecoming surprise for Evelyn after his business trip. The Griffore souvenir in his carry-on was just the beginning.

But fate had other plans.

During the ride to the airport, he’d dialed Evelyn’s number. The line connected, yet silence answered.

A cold dread slithered down his spine. Had she truly walked away?

Her midnight meeting with Ethan Caldwell haunted him. What secrets had they exchanged?

Alexander would be furious if he knew.

Ethan Caldwell was making his move while Alexander was away.

The realization hit Evelyn like a cold splash of water.

She had been too trusting. Too naive.

All those times she had defended Ethan, believing there was still good in him—what a fool she had been.

Now, he was circling like a vulture, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

Her fingers tightened around her phone.

She should call Alexander. Warn him.

But pride held her back.

She had handled worse. She could handle Ethan.

The city of Cresthaven stretched before her, its glittering skyline a stark contrast to the storm brewing inside her.

Ethan had crossed a line.

And Evelyn wasn’t about to let him get away with it.

Secret Longing: A Love Reborn from Ashes (Evelyn)

The game had just begun.

###Chapter 382 The Divorce Papers

Alexander's hands balled into fists at his sides. The mere thought of Evelyn reuniting with Ethan sent waves of agony crashing through him.

He had called Titan Capital Group only to discover she hadn’t shown up for work.

Even the security at Hawthorne Estate confirmed she never returned home last night.

Where had she been? With him?

Her sudden coldness—was it because he hadn’t answered her calls?

Or had she reignited something with Ethan, deciding she no longer wanted Alexander?

Ethan hadn’t slept a wink.

The previous night, a raging fever had wracked his body, sending him into violent convulsions. An ambulance rushed him to the hospital, where he spent the day drifting in and out of consciousness between IV drips.

By evening, the sterile air of the ward suffocated him. He wandered out—only to find Evelyn sitting alone in the hospital lobby.

Kidnapping her wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision.

The idea had festered in his mind for weeks.

Ethan Caldwell had saved Evelyn Carter from Damian Cross, just as he had done ten years ago.

He expected her to look at him with the same adoration she once had.

But she didn’t.

Instead, she coldly distanced herself from him—right in front of Alexander Whitmore.

The rejection cut deeper than any blade.

Ethan told himself it was fear that made her act this way. Fear of Alexander.

Then Valentine’s night happened.

Under the soft glow of moonlight, he watched from his window as Evelyn and Alexander kissed.

The sight burned into his mind.

He could almost imagine them tangled in passion, lost in each other.

It drove him mad.

How could they be so happy while he suffered?

How could the woman who had once loved him now belong to someone else?

Lying in his hospital bed, the IV drip feeding into his veins, Ethan plotted.

He would get her back.

When he spotted Evelyn sitting alone in the hospital lobby, he knew—this was his moment.

She might hate him afterward.

But he was certain.

One way or another, she would remember who she truly belonged to.

Restless, Ethan Caldwell idly scrolled through Evelyn's phone.

Her contact name for Alexander read "My Beloved," making his jaw tighten.

He discovered Evelyn had attempted to call Alexander over a dozen times yesterday. Not a single call had been answered.

Ethan smirked.

Had they fought?

Fortune truly favored him.

What woman could endure her husband vanishing mid-business trip without explanation?

At dawn, the phone buzzed.

Alexander.

Ethan declined without a second thought.

When the third call came, he finally responded—with a carefully crafted message.

Then, he blocked the number.

On the other side of the world, Alexander Whitmore had just landed.

The notification flashed—Evelyn’s name. His thumb tapped instantly.

[Let’s end this. I’m in love with Ethan.]

[Don't try to find me. I need time alone. Let's take a break from each other.]

Alexander's hands shook uncontrollably as he read the message.

His expression darkened, the air around him turning icy.

He gripped his phone tighter, dialing her number again and again—only to be met with the sharp tone of rejection.

Evelyn had blocked him.

"Mr. Whitmore."

Simon finally caught up to him, breathless. "Mrs. Whitmore returned to Hawthorne Estate for dinner last night, then went to the hospital. She met with..."

He hesitated before finishing, "She met with Ethan Caldwell there. After that, she vanished."

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn Carter) novel

###Chapter 383 Hunger Strike

Alexander's brows furrowed deeply.

Had Evelyn even bothered to visit Ethan at the hospital?

His fingers curled into tight fists, knuckles turning white.

"So Ethan might know where Mrs. Whitmore is," Simon murmured cautiously, watching Alexander's expression. "Should we reach out to him?"

A cold, mocking smile twisted Alexander's lips.

Evelyn had sent him messages demanding space, insisting she never wanted to see him again. Wouldn’t it be pathetic if he went crawling after her now?

And then there was the report from the bodyguard he’d assigned to protect her—she had initiated a reconciliation with Ethan.

How laughable.

All his efforts had been for nothing. No matter what he did, it could never compete with her seven years of devotion to Ethan.

Alexander’s eyes burned with fury. Contacting Ethan now would only invite humiliation.

"Mr. Whitmore?" Simon’s voice wavered when Alexander remained silent for too long. His stomach tightened with unease.

"What? Aren't we going to search for Mrs. Whitmore?"

When Evelyn regained consciousness, golden sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

A sharp pain throbbed at the base of her skull as she pushed herself upright.

The lavish bedroom smelled faintly of fresh roses and lemon polish.

This wasn't her penthouse. Not Alexander's either.

Memories flooded back - Ethan's cold eyes in the hospital stairwell, the sudden impact against her temple.

She'd been kidnapped.

Yet the gilded cage surprised her. No locked doors. No restraints.

Servants moved like ghosts through the sprawling villa, their eyes averted when she passed.

At noon, they presented an elaborate spread - seared scallops, truffle risotto, chocolate soufflé.

Her stomach churned.

Morning sickness and dread killed any appetite.

The silverware gleamed mockingly as she pushed the plate away.

She needed to think. To escape.

But first, she needed to understand why Ethan had taken her.

The sprawling Hawthorne Estate had no cell reception, no Wi-Fi, just a single antique television gathering dust in the parlor.

Not exactly useful for sending distress signals.

Evelyn Carter fixed her gaze on the trembling maid. "Where's Ethan? I demand to see him immediately."

The servant wrung her hands. "Mr. Caldwell remains hospitalized. He'll visit once the doctors discharge him."

Fury licked through Evelyn's veins. Ethan had truly lost his mind this time.

Didn't he realize the consequences?

If the Whitmores discovered he'd kidnapped Alexander's wife, they'd tear him apart limb by limb. Alexander wouldn't rest until Ethan's entire world crumbled to ashes.

Why would a Cresthaven elite like Ethan risk everything for this madness?

The staff clearly operated under strict orders. No smartphones, no landlines—just the oppressive silence of the mountains surrounding the estate.

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

Even if she slipped past the guards, the wilderness stretched for miles. Without GPS or landmarks, she'd be wandering straight into nature's merciless jaws.

The grandfather clock chimed ominously as Evelyn made her decision.

If Ethan wanted to play games, she'd raise the stakes.

Starting now, not a single bite of food would pass her lips.

Let's see how long before her "host" came running.

The silver tray clinked softly as the maid placed dinner on the bedside table once more.

Evelyn Carter turned her face away, her stomach growling but her resolve unshaken.

She had only allowed herself a few sips of water all day.

The staff noted everything. When midnight draped the Hawthorne Estate in silence, they discreetly dialed Ethan Caldwell.

"Mr. Caldwell," the head maid whispered, "Ms. Carter hasn't touched a single meal. It appears she's refusing to eat. What should we—"

The mansion was eerily still, amplifying even the faintest rustle of fabric.

Sometime past three AM, Evelyn stirred in bed.

A door creaked open downstairs.

Then, the purr of an engine cut through the night.

Her eyes snapped open in the darkness.

###Chapter 384 The Pasta Surprise

At this late hour, only one person would dare to disturb her—Ethan Caldwell.

Just as expected, moments later, the door to Evelyn's suite creaked open.

Ethan stood silhouetted in the doorway, his tall frame radiating icy tension. He deliberately left the lights off, as though afraid the brightness might sear her tired eyes.

"Evelyn, I know you're awake."

His voice, rough with exhaustion, cut through the darkness. The faint glow from the hallway illuminated his approach as he moved toward her bed.

"Why haven't you eaten? Even if you're furious with me, you shouldn't punish yourself like this."

His tone was softer than she'd ever heard it, almost pleading. His fingers reached out, brushing against her cheek as if to tuck a stray lock of hair behind her ear.

She jerked away instinctively, leaving his hand hovering in the air before it finally settled against her skin.

The heat of his touch startled her.

Evelyn hadn't realized his fever still hadn't broken after two days.

Irritation flared within her. She snapped on the bedside lamp, its golden glow revealing the exhaustion in his shadowed eyes.

"What exactly are you trying to prove, Ethan?" Her voice was sharp, laced with frustration. "You're not usually this—"

Ethan sighed deeply, his voice laced with frustration. "Evelyn, you know I'm usually a reasonable man, but you—you're my one exception."

His lips curled into a mocking smile. "Did you really think your disappearance would send everyone into a panic?"

He leaned closer, his tone dripping with condescension. "You've been gone for twenty-four hours, and yet life goes on. No one's searching for you. Not even your precious husband."

Evelyn's fingers clenched around the edges of the blanket.

"Alexander returned from Cresthaven hours ago," Ethan continued, watching her reaction. "And guess what? He hasn't even bothered to look for you."

His words struck like poisoned arrows. "Face it, Evelyn. You mean nothing to him. That marriage was always just a game—a way to get under my skin. You're disposable to him."

The quilt wrinkled beneath Evelyn's tightening grip.

That couldn't be true.

Alexander was back in the city, knew she was missing, and chose not to act?

It defied logic. Even after their explosive argument, wouldn't he at least check if she was safe? Then she remembered—her phone was currently in Ethan's possession.

A cold realization settled in her chest.

Evelyn stared at him, her eyes wide with disbelief.

"Did you use my phone to contact him? Ethan, give it back to me!"

Ethan tucked Evelyn deeper under the covers, his movements slow but deliberate. "Don't be upset. Just rest. I'll make you some spaghetti."

He rose from the bed, his body trembling slightly.

A full day and night of high fever, followed by plunging into an icy lake in the dead of winter, had taken a brutal toll on him.

Ethan was supposed to be in the hospital. But when the staff called, saying Evelyn hadn't eaten all day, he had rushed over without hesitation.

No doctors made rounds at this hour. No one would notice his absence.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Don't bother. I won't eat it. Ethan, either let me out, or I'll starve myself."

"Evelyn, you've never tasted my spaghetti before, have you? It's my first attempt, so don't judge too harshly."

He ignored her protests. Stepping out of the room, he headed straight for the kitchen and tied an apron around his waist.

When Evelyn emerged, wrapped in her coat, she found him watching a cooking tutorial on his phone, his expression a mix of concentration and panic.

The water in the pot bubbled violently. With unsteady hands, he dropped the spaghetti in.

The plate of spaghetti steamed before Evelyn, its rich aroma filling the air. Yet, she barely glanced at it.

Alexander Whitmore, one of Cresthaven's most powerful men, had rushed here despite his high fever. Just to cook for her. Just to feed her with his own hands.

It was absurd.

"Ethan," Evelyn said coldly, her fingers tightening around her fork. "You should know by now—you can't control me."

His expression darkened, but she didn’t flinch.

Somewhere in the distance, a clock chimed, marking the end of something.

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After
###Chapter 385 There Must Be a Way

Evelyn Carter stared at Ethan Caldwell with icy detachment. "My feelings for you are gone. Nothing you do will change that."

"Be reasonable. You can't keep me imprisoned indefinitely. When I get out, how do you plan to explain this to the Whitmore family?"

His recklessness was bordering on foolishness.

"Evelyn, you still care. I can see it in your eyes—you're worried about the Whitmores coming after me. Relax. Worst case, I'll cut ties with them completely."

Evelyn exhaled in frustration.

Ethan nudged the plate toward her. "Eat. If not for yourself, then for the baby."

At the mention of the child, her guard shot up. "You know?"

So that was why she couldn’t find the medical report earlier. She’d assumed it was misplaced, but he’d taken it.

"Don’t look at me like that. I’d never harm our child."

To prove his point, he twirled a forkful of spaghetti and took a deliberate bite. "See? No poison."

He chewed, then grimaced. "Though it’s criminally under-seasoned."

Evelyn was speechless, watching as Ethan resembled a child who had just lost his favorite toy.

It was painfully obvious—he would never find what he was looking for, and they could never return to how things used to be. So why couldn’t he accept it? Why did he keep lying to himself?

Did he really believe she would change her mind?

Evelyn didn’t touch a single bite of the pasta he had made. Instead, she retreated to her room and locked the door behind her.

Ethan hesitated outside, his hand hovering over the doorknob before dropping it when he realized she had locked him out.

"I need to get back to the hospital," he said, his voice strained. "Evelyn, rest well. I’ll come see you in a couple of days."

Silence.

Her thoughts were a tangled mess.

Reasoning with Ethan was impossible now.

The man who had always carried himself with arrogance had tied an apron around his waist, cooked for her, and spoken to her with a gentleness that unsettled her. It was unnerving.

The front door slammed shut. The engine of his car roared to life before fading into the distance.

Evelyn lay on the bed, her gaze fixed on the ceiling, sleep the furthest thing from her mind.

She couldn’t just sit here and wait.

She had to find a way out.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand ballroom of Whitmore Manor, she felt the weight of countless eyes upon her.

The chandeliers cast a golden glow over the sea of elegantly dressed guests, their whispers weaving through the air like invisible threads.

Alexander stood at the center of the room, his presence commanding attention even without words.

Vanessa Hart, her stepsister, was already by his side, her crimson gown a deliberate contrast to Evelyn’s ivory dress.

Ethan Caldwell, her ex-fiancé, lingered near the champagne tower, his gaze sharp as a blade.

She tightened her grip on her clutch, forcing herself to breathe.

This wasn’t just a party—it was a battlefield.

Nathan Reeves, Ethan’s ever-loyal assistant, moved through the crowd with practiced ease, exchanging pleasantries while his eyes darted toward Evelyn.

She ignored him, focusing instead on the warmth of Alexander’s hand when it found hers.

“You look stunning,” he murmured, his voice low enough that only she could hear.

A flicker of reassurance settled in her chest.

Then the music shifted.

Vanessa’s laugh rang out, bright and calculated, as she raised her glass.

“To family,” she declared, her smile razor-thin.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

Because she knew—this toast wasn’t a celebration.

It was a warning.

Across the room, Ethan’s lips curved into a smirk as he locked eyes with her.

The game had begun.

And Evelyn had no intention of losing.

There had to be a way.

At Eclipse Lounge, Alexander sat in a shadowed corner booth while Lucas slumped drunkenly beside him.

"How could she have Julian's child?" Lucas's voice was thick with liquor and bitterness. "Tell me, Alex—what does that pretty boy have that I don't? He dances for money in clubs. Doesn’t that disgust her?"

His fingers tightened around his glass. "I wasted my heart mourning her, and she was already moving on. I fought like hell to win her back, and now she’s carrying another man’s baby."

With a sharp curse, Lucas slammed his drink down hard enough to make the ice rattle. "She’s going to be the death of me."

The pain in his voice was raw. Even now, he couldn’t wrap his mind around Claire being pregnant with Julian’s child.

"Since when did she become so fickle? She loved me—I know she did. Then, in the blink of an eye, she’s in someone else’s arms?"

Every word out of Lucas’s mouth was a knife twisting in Alexander’s own wounds.

He didn’t answer. Just lifted his glass and drank.

"Hey, I’m the one drowning my sorrows here," Lucas slurred, squinting at him. "Why are you matching me shot for shot?"

The dim lighting of the bar couldn’t hide the storm in Alexander’s eyes.

Somewhere in the haze of alcohol, there had to be an answer.

A way to fix what was broken.

A way to make her his again.

Alexander downed three more glasses of bourbon in quick succession.

He abruptly set the crystal tumbler down with a sharp clink and rose from his seat.

Lucas blinked in confusion as his friend strode toward the exit. "What's gotten into you? We just agreed to drown our sorrows tonight. You bailing on me already?"

Alexander only grabbed his tailored coat from the velvet booth without responding.

Lucas suddenly snapped his fingers, realization dawning. "Right! Your wife's waiting at home! Unlike some of us who got dumped, you've actually got someone to go back to!"

He waved dismissively, completely missing the icy storm brewing in Alexander's steel-gray eyes. "Go on then. Don't keep the little woman waiting."

Alexander's jaw tightened.

Each careless word from Lucas made his expression grow more frigid.

Yet he offered no explanation as he turned on his heel.

No self-respecting man wanted to admit being left by his wife.

Though apparently Lucas had no such pride.

The Whitmore Manor stood dark and silent when he arrived.

No lights. No Evelyn.

Just empty rooms echoing with absence.

###Chapter 386 The Unexpected Turn

The night was pitch black.

Alexander stumbled into Whitmore Manor, slightly intoxicated, loosening his tie with an impatient tug.

Everything remained exactly as Evelyn had left it. Her shoes still lined the shoe cabinet meticulously, her clothes untouched in the wardrobe. Yet, she was gone.

After a cold shower, Alexander collapsed onto the king-sized bed they once shared.

The pillow still carried traces of her favorite lavender shampoo—a scent that now haunted him.

Silence pressed heavily around him. Normally, the alcohol would have dragged him into unconsciousness by now.

But tonight, sleep refused to come.

His thoughts circled back to Evelyn.

Gritting his teeth, Alexander grabbed his phone and dialed her number.

Two sharp beeps. Then—nothing.

Blocked. Again.

His jaw clenched. He slammed his fist into the mattress, a frustrated growl tearing from his throat.

She had vanished without hesitation—erased herself from his life completely. No calls. No messages. Not even showing up at Titan Capital Group.

Was this the difference between love and indifference? When passion faded, did it leave only this—cold, calculated silence?

The emptiness of the room mocked him.

Alexander exhaled sharply, staring at the ceiling.

Somewhere out there, Evelyn was moving on.

And he was left here, drowning in the remnants of what they once had.

Evelyn Carter felt nothing for him, so walking away came without a second thought.

But her heart still belonged to Ethan Caldwell. Even after all this time apart, she couldn’t erase him from her mind. She would go back to him—no matter the cost.

Alexander Whitmore pressed the back of his hand against his eyes.

He was convinced he was unlovable.

At Titan Capital Group, Natalie Brooks propped her chin on her palm, staring at Evelyn’s vacant desk with a distant expression.

Cassandra Reed approached, arms laden with files, and murmured, “With over twenty years of experience, I can confidently say Mr. Whitmore and Evelyn had a major fight.”

Alexander had been working like a man possessed these past two days.

Titan Capital didn’t encourage overtime, yet his office lights burned bright well past nine, sometimes ten at night.

Last night was even stranger—he didn’t go home at all. He slept in his office.

And Evelyn? She hadn’t shown up for work in two days.

Something was definitely wrong.

Cassandra tilted her head curiously. "Do you really think Evelyn would forbid Alexander from returning home? She's always been so kind-hearted. That doesn't sound like her at all."

Victoria strode over just then, arms crossed. "Honestly, should we really be speculating about Mr. Whitmore's personal life? Don't we all have enough work to do?" She dropped a thick stack of files onto Cassandra's desk with a thud. "Here, make yourself useful. These contracts need reviewing by end of day."

The office hummed with quiet activity around them. Cassandra sighed dramatically as she pulled the first file toward her. Through the glass walls, she could see Evelyn's empty office - the CEO had left early again today.

Victoria lingered by Cassandra's desk, lowering her voice. "Between us? I heard Mr. Whitmore hasn't been seen at headquarters all week either." She tapped the files meaningfully. "Maybe focus on these instead of office gossip, hmm?"

Outside, rain began pattering against the windows of Titan Capital Group's high-rise. The weather mirrored the strange tension that had settled over the company recently. Even the usually unflappable Victoria seemed unsettled as she glanced toward Evelyn's darkened office once more before returning to her own workstation.

Cassandra chewed her lip thoughtfully as she opened the first file. Something unusual was definitely happening between their CEO and her enigmatic husband. But as Victoria said - perhaps some mysteries weren't theirs to solve.

###Chapter 387 The Revelation

Cassandra stuck out her tongue playfully and fell silent.

Natalie's mind was elsewhere.

Two days ago, she had sent Evelyn a message about an urgent document she needed for work.

At first, Evelyn hadn’t responded. When Natalie called, Evelyn snapped, "Figure it out yourself."

That wasn’t like Evelyn at all.

Their previous conversations had been warm, even friendly. Something felt off.

Simon walked by and lightly tapped her desk. "You seem lost in thought."

"Mr. Graves," Natalie murmured, "when is Evelyn coming back?"

Simon paused. "Why do you ask?"

Natalie unlocked her phone and showed him the messages. "She doesn’t sound like herself."

Simon glanced at the screen, his expression shifting.

A chill ran down Natalie’s spine.

Something was wrong.

Very wrong.

The tension in the office was palpable.

Simon Graves cleared his throat. "Perhaps Mrs. Whitmore is simply preoccupied. It might not be personal."

"But—" Natalie Brooks started to protest, only to fall silent as Alexander Whitmore strode out of his office.

Simon hurried after him. "Mr. Whitmore, where are you headed?"

Alexander didn’t respond immediately. Only when they were settled in the back of the sleek black car did he finally speak. "I heard my nephew has launched a new venture. Is that correct?"

Simon blinked in surprise. "Yes, Horizon Enterprises had its grand opening today. Should I arrange for a congratulatory gift?"

Alexander smirked, loosening his tie with a slow, deliberate motion. "A gift?" He leaned back against the supple leather seat. "This calls for a personal visit, don’t you think?"

Understanding dawned in Simon’s eyes.

Evelyn Carter would undoubtedly be there to support Ethan Caldwell.

And Alexander intended to see her.

Without another word, Simon signaled the driver. The engine purred to life.

The sleek black sedan came to a smooth halt outside the gleaming glass tower of Horizon Enterprises.

Simon stepped out first, his polished shoes clicking against the pavement as he approached the reception desk. His inquiry about Ethan Caldwell's whereabouts yielded unexpected news.

Trevor Moss greeted them with practiced professionalism, though his eyes flickered with unease. "Mr. Whitmore, what brings you here today? Mr. Caldwell remains hospitalized—his condition took a turn for the worse these past few days. I've been overseeing all company operations in his absence."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "He's been in the hospital this entire time?"

"Without exception," Trevor confirmed, adjusting his tie.

This didn't add up. Alexander knew Ethan better than that. The ambitious businessman wouldn't miss his own company's grand opening unless something far more significant demanded his attention. Hospitalization seemed too convenient an excuse—more like a smokescreen for darker dealings.

Without another word, Alexander turned on his heel and strode back toward the waiting vehicle. His mind raced with possibilities, each more troubling than the last.

Simon lingered momentarily, his attention caught by the extravagant floral arrangements flanking the entrance. His voice carried a note of concern when he finally caught up. "Sir... I don't see Mrs. Whitmore's bouquet among the displays."

The omission felt deliberate. Ominous. Like missing pieces in a puzzle they'd only begun to assemble.

Alexander's jaw tightened as he slid into the leather seat. The game had changed. And he intended to discover exactly how.

Even after their reconciliation, Ethan Caldwell and Evelyn Carter knew society's judgmental eyes would never accept their forbidden connection. They moved like shadows, careful not to draw attention.

"Track her current address."

Given the circumstances, Evelyn wouldn't return to Hawthorne Estate. She wouldn't stay at Claire Dawson's place either—not with Julian Mercer there.

Alexander Whitmore needed to see her.

Two days of silence had been torture.

Even if it was over, he deserved to hear those words from Evelyn's lips, not through the sterile glow of a text message. He needed to understand why she'd shattered them without warning.

Simon Graves hesitated before reporting, "We've combed every hotel and rental in Cresthaven. No trace of Mrs. Whitmore."

Alexander's knuckles whitened around his whiskey glass.

Had Evelyn moved into Ethan's penthouse? Were they playing house while his world burned?

The ice in his drink cracked like his self-control.

Somewhere across the city, a phone buzzed with an encrypted alert. Security footage from a luxury high-rise flickered to life on a tablet—Evelyn's silhouette against floor-to-ceiling windows, alone.

Simon cleared his throat. "There's... one more lead."

Alexander's head snapped up. The game wasn't over yet.

###Chapter 388 The Visit

Alexander's face drained of color when he realized Evelyn had been staying at Ethan's place these past few days.

His gaze turned icy.

"Has she returned to Hawthorne Estate recently?"

Simon replied, "The day you left for your business trip to Cresthaven, Mrs. Whitmore came back for dinner. She hasn't been back since."

Thirty minutes later, a sleek black car pulled up outside the grand gates of Hawthorne Estate.

Alexander stepped out, his polished shoes crunching on the gravel path. In the garden, Oliver lounged on a wicker rocking chair, soaking up the afternoon sun.

Spotting Alexander's arrival, Oliver sprang to his feet. "Alex? What brings you here?"

Simon stepped forward with an armful of elegantly wrapped packages. "Mr. Whitmore was occupied with his trip to Cresthaven and couldn't visit earlier. He's free today and brought these gifts from his travels."

Oliver eagerly took the boxes from Simon's arms. "You didn't have to! Mom! Alex is here!"

He ushered them inside with enthusiastic gestures.

Upstairs, Margaret descended the staircase just in time to see—

"Alexander, where's Evelyn? Why isn't she with you?"

Margaret frowned, glancing behind him as if expecting her daughter to appear. The absence felt unsettling.

"I invited her for dinner last night, but she declined," Alexander admitted, his jaw tightening. "I assumed she'd come with me today."

Oliver huffed, crossing his arms. "Mom, I texted her saying I’m leaving for college soon and might not see her for months. She barely replied—just one word!"

Alexander’s instincts flared.

Even if Evelyn wanted distance from him, she wouldn’t shut out her family like this.

Oliver and Evelyn had always been close. For her to ignore him… something was wrong.

"Oliver, let me borrow your phone," Alexander said abruptly.

Without hesitation, Oliver tossed it to him. Alexander had gifted him a rare sports car last month—of course he’d hand it over without question.

Alexander dialed Evelyn’s number.

The line rang once.

Then silence.

His grip tightened.

She’d hung up.

Alexander's phone buzzed instantly with a reply: [What?]

Seeing the message, he didn't respond. Instead, he called again.

This time, Evelyn answered with a text: [I’m sick. My voice is gone. If you need something, text me.]

Alexander smirked and typed in Oliver’s tone: [Evelyn, you promised me a set of limited-edition figurines before I left for college. Don’t tell me you forgot?]

The reply didn’t come as quickly this time.

Five minutes ticked by. Silence.

Alexander called again.

Finally, Evelyn responded slowly: [Fine. I’ll have someone deliver them to the house later.]

Oliver had been watching Alexander’s every move with wide eyes. The moment figurines were mentioned, he perked up. "Alex, how did you know I collect those?"

Alexander gave him a knowing once-over, his gaze sharp enough to peel back layers. As if I wouldn’t notice.

With a satisfied smirk, he handed the phone back to Oliver.

The test was complete.

And the truth had revealed itself.

The messages sent from her phone weren't hers.

A cold smirk curled on Alexander's lips. The realization struck him like lightning—he had never considered this possibility before.

Ethan Caldwell must have Evelyn under his complete control.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have restricted her access to her own device.

###Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love After Betrayal (Evelyn) novel

The air in the room grew heavy as Alexander's fingers tightened around the phone. His mind raced with scenarios, each more infuriating than the last.

If Ethan had gone this far, what else was he capable of?

Evelyn’s absence had never felt more sinister.

Alexander’s jaw clenched. He wouldn’t let this stand.

Not when Evelyn’s freedom—and possibly her life—hung in the balance.

The game had just taken a darker turn.

And Alexander was done playing by Ethan’s rules.

###Chapter 389 Retch

"Alexander, are you leaving already?"

Oliver noticed Alexander rising abruptly and frowned in confusion. "Dinner's about to be served. At least stay and eat before you go."

"I can't," Alexander replied tersely, already moving toward the door. "Something urgent came up."

Before Oliver could protest, Alexander had vanished beyond the estate gates.

Oliver sighed, running a hand through his hair. Why is everyone acting so strangely these days?

Moments later, a servant arrived carrying an ornate box. Inside were meticulously crafted figurines—each one exquisitely detailed.

Oliver skimmed the accompanying note from Evelyn, his brows knitting together. A slow realization dawned on him.

When did I ever mention wanting figurines?

His sister had been acting oddly for weeks. First the sudden hunger strike, now this.

Evelyn's protest had lasted precisely forty-eight hours before her stubbornness crumbled. By the third day, she'd surrendered to hunger, though her body rebelled violently.

Morning sickness gripped her mercilessly. Every meal ended the same way—retching over the porcelain bowl, trembling hands clutching her stomach.

The pregnancy was still new, her body unaccustomed to the changes.

Oliver watched from the doorway as Evelyn slumped against the bathroom tiles, exhausted. He made a mental note to call their family physician at dawn.

Something wasn't right.

And Alexander's abrupt departure only deepened the mystery.

The air was thick with tension as Evelyn Carter sat by the window, her fingers tracing the cold glass. If she wanted to escape, she needed to conserve her strength. Without energy, every attempt would be futile.

Ethan Caldwell arrived on the sixth night of her captivity.

Days of barely eating had left Evelyn gaunt, her once-vibrant eyes now shadowed with exhaustion. The staff at Hawthorne Estate had been kind, preparing elaborate meals in hopes of tempting her appetite. When she refused solid food, they resorted to soups—rich, nourishing broths that became her only sustenance.

Ethan slipped into the estate late that night, finding her room shrouded in darkness. He didn’t disturb her, though the weight of his presence lingered in the silence.

Morning came, and Evelyn descended the stairs to find him already seated at the dining table, sipping black coffee. He pushed a steaming cup of milk toward her. "Drink this. It’ll help with the nausea."

His voice was soft, almost tender—a cruel echo of the past. For a fleeting second, she could almost believe they were still together.

Evelyn ignored the milk, pouring herself a glass of water instead. Her voice was steady, but her knuckles whitened around the glass. "Ethan, how much longer do you plan to keep me here?"

Nearly a week had passed. He’d been absent for days, and the estate gates remained locked, sealing her in like a prized possession.

The question hung between them, unanswered.

The delivery truck came only once each morning, bringing fresh produce to the estate.

Every time it arrived, a group of maids and guards would swarm around Evelyn, their watchful eyes making it clear—she wasn’t getting anywhere near that truck.

She was trapped.

Ethan Caldwell had power, wealth, and no patience for useless people. With this many eyes on her, escaping wasn’t just difficult—it was impossible. She couldn’t even step outside without permission.

He noticed the bitterness in her expression.

"I’ll be staying here with you for the next few days."

His voice was soft, his gaze unnervingly tender. "Evelyn, we have all the time in the world to… reconnect."

A wave of nausea hit her.

Whether it was his words or the pregnancy hormones, she didn’t know—but she barely had time to turn away before she was retching violently in front of him.

Ethan’s expression darkened instantly.

"Do I disgust you that much?" His voice was dangerously quiet. "Were those seven years together really so unbearable for you?"

He stepped closer, his jaw tight. "I’ve changed my mind. Don’t you want things to go back to how they were?"

She didn’t even blink.

“I don’t.”

With that, she turned on her heel and disappeared into her room, the door clicking shut behind her with finality.

Alexander’s voice followed, low and edged with frustration. “Evelyn, this defiance of yours exists solely because I allow it.”

Secret Longing: A Love Reclaimed After Darkness (Evelyn Carter) novel

The air between them crackled with tension, thick enough to slice.

Evelyn’s refusal had been sharp, effortless. She hadn’t hesitated, hadn’t wavered.

Alexander’s words lingered in the hallway, a quiet threat wrapped in velvet.

But Evelyn was done bending.

She leaned against her bedroom door, exhaling slowly.

Outside, Alexander’s footsteps retreated, heavy with unspoken promises.

Or warnings.

She couldn’t tell anymore.

And frankly, she didn’t care.

Not when every fiber of her being screamed one truth—she was done playing by his rules.

The silence stretched, suffocating.

Then, a soft knock.

Not Alexander.

Too tentative.

Evelyn didn’t move.

Whoever it was could wait.

Forever, if necessary.

She had nothing left to give.

Not to him.

Not to anyone.

###Chapter 390 The Chef's Redemption

Ethan Caldwell watched Evelyn Carter's retreating figure, his voice unexpectedly soft. "Being cherished should make you feel protected. I've wronged you before, so I'll endure your tantrums without limits."

Water droplets traced paths down his hollowed cheeks.

Days of raging fever had left him gaunt, his complexion ashen. The man who once commanded boardrooms now looked fragile enough to shatter.

The household staff stood frozen. No one in living memory had dared throw water in the master's face.

Yet Ethan showed no trace of anger.

His gaze remained fixed on Evelyn's stiff shoulders. "I'll spend every day proving I mean this fresh start."

The door slammed with finality before he finished speaking. The lock clicked like a gunshot.

Ethan followed anyway, pressing his palm against the carved oak. Inside, Evelyn burrowed deeper into the duvet, its down filling muffling her scream.

Fury prickled along her skin like static.

How could anyone remain calm after weeks of forced isolation? The gilded cage of Whitmore Manor might dazzle outsiders, but she saw only bars.

His knuckles rapped gently against the wood. "Darling—"

"Stop calling me that!" A porcelain vase shattered against the doorframe.

Ethan exhaled slowly, counting the shards glinting on the marble. Twelve pieces. Like the twelve roses he'd sent yesterday now floating in the koi pond.

He leaned his forehead against the cool wood. "I'll be in the kitchen."

Silence.

Downstairs, the head chef gaped as the CEO of Horizon Enterprises tied on an apron. "Sir, perhaps the beef Wellington—"

"I'll handle her meals from now on." Ethan selected a santoku knife, testing its weight. The blade caught the afternoon light as he began julienning carrots with precise strokes.

Upstairs, Evelyn startled at the unfamiliar aroma drifting through the vents. Something earthy and rich with herbs.

Her stomach betrayed her with a growl.

The scent carried memories—midnight snacks during exam weeks, their first anniversary dinner, all the meals he'd burned while learning.

A tear plopped onto the silk sheets. Damn him. Damn this war between her hunger and pride.

The intercom crackled. "Dinner in twenty minutes," came Ethan's voice, rough as aged whiskey. "I remember how you like your steak."

She hurled a pillow at the speaker.

It landed softly, useless as her resolve.

The isolation was suffocating.

Trapped in this gilded cage, Evelyn Carter had been completely cut off from the outside world. No phone. No internet. No way to know what was happening beyond these walls.

What unsettled her most was Alexander Whitmore’s silence.

Yes, they’d had their disagreements before, but he wouldn’t just abandon her like this. Not without a fight.

There was only one explanation—Ethan Caldwell was behind this.

Exhaustion weighed heavily on Evelyn as pregnancy fatigue pulled her into another deep sleep.

When she stirred awake hours later, golden afternoon light spilled across the room.

She turned—and froze.

Ethan sat at her bedside, watching her with those unreadable dark eyes.

"Good afternoon, sleeping beauty."

Evelyn bolted upright, heart hammering. Her gaze darted to her clothes—still intact, exactly as she'd worn them to bed. She exhaled shakily.

Then realization struck.

She'd locked the door.

Her fingers curled into the sheets as icy dread slithered down her spine.

How had he gotten in?

Had Ethan used his own key to unlock the door?

Evelyn's expression darkened immediately.

"Evelyn, don't give me that look." Ethan rose from his seat with a charming smile. "I know you've been bored, so I cleared my schedule just to keep you company."

While you were sleeping, I mastered spaghetti. This batch will definitely taste better than last time. Come downstairs and try it."

Evelyn hadn’t eaten much all day. And Ethan always knew how to tempt her.

She stopped fuming—what was the point?

Better to stay composed and hear him out.

"I'll be waiting in the dining room."

With that, Ethan shut the door softly behind him. Evelyn exhaled in frustration.

She couldn’t figure him out.

Ethan, what game are you playing now?

After a quick freshening up, Evelyn descended the stairs just as Ethan set down two plates of pasta.

The spaghetti looked surprisingly delicious.

She took her seat.

Ethan watched her, silent and expectant.

"Is it to your liking?" Ethan's gaze burned with anticipation as he watched Evelyn take another bite.

Evelyn gave a small nod. "It's decent. The steak is surprisingly tender."

A triumphant grin spread across Ethan's face at her approval. "I'll make it for you whenever you want. You've barely eaten these past few days. You must be starving."

She didn't argue. Hunger gnawed at her, though the nausea from her pregnancy had stolen her appetite.

"Maybe if you let me leave this place, I'd actually enjoy my meals," she murmured, her voice edged with quiet defiance.

Ethan stiffened. His smile vanished, replaced by a cold, unreadable mask. "Evelyn," he said, his tone dangerously low, "are you really that desperate to escape me?"

The air between them thickened with tension.

Evelyn held his gaze, unflinching.

Somewhere in the distance, a clock ticked.

The silence stretched.

Then—

A sharp knock at the door shattered the moment.

Ethan's jaw clenched.

Evelyn exhaled slowly.

Neither moved.

The knock came again, louder this time.

"Ethan," a voice called from the other side—Nathan, his ever-loyal assistant. "We have a situation."

Ethan's eyes darkened.

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

Was this her chance?

Or just another cruel twist of fate?

###Chapter 391 Regret

Evelyn's voice was sharp as she demanded, "Do you really intend to keep me locked away forever? Ethan, do you honestly believe that's sustainable?"

Ethan remained silent, his fingers twitching toward the cigarette pack in his pocket. He flicked open the lighter, the flame casting shadows across his tense features.

His agitation was palpable.

Noticing Evelyn's disapproving frown, he exhaled sharply and strode out into the garden, the cigarette dangling unlit between his fingers.

Evelyn finished her spaghetti in silence, the fork clinking softly against the porcelain. Then, with deliberate steps, she followed him outside.

"Aren't you cold?" she asked, her tone icy.

Ethan turned, immediately shrugging off his coat to drape it over her shoulders.

She sidestepped, her gaze frosty. "Ethan, have you considered what will happen when the Caldwells discover you're holding me against my will?"

His jaw tightened.

"You have a family," she continued. "And so do I. You—"

"Evelyn," he cut in, his voice rough. "All I want is this—just you and me, without the rest of the world interfering. Can we please stop bringing them into this?"

Evelyn couldn't make out his expression clearly in the dim light.

His voice was low but firm. "I've thought this through. If the world won't accept us, I'll take you far away. We can leave everything behind—my family, my name, all of it."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the edge of the table. "And Vanessa? What about the child she’s carrying? Don’t you want your own flesh and blood?" Her voice cracked slightly. "I'm pregnant with Alexander's baby, Ethan. Do you expect me to just... get rid of it?"

"I'll raise it as my own."

Ethan’s gaze burned into hers, unwavering. "If you choose me, I’ll be that child’s father in every way that matters."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

She exhaled slowly, shaking her head. "You’d abandon your own unborn child just to play father to another man’s? Ethan, what kind of twisted logic is that?"

His eyes glistened with unshed tears.

"I love you," he whispered hoarsely. "And because I love you, I’ll love your child too. Evelyn, I’m begging you—don’t shut me out. Just think about what we’ve shared these past seven years."

He reached for her hand, but she pulled away.

"Give me a chance to prove myself," he pleaded. "Please."

Ethan's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn's.

Each word he spoke carried undeniable weight.

"Whether I'm the one you truly want—feel it with your heart first. Then answer me."

Humans were peculiar creatures.

During the years Evelyn had loved Ethan, she had desperately longed for his affection in return.

But now that he had finally repented and laid his emotions bare, she felt nothing.

The Evelyn who had once loved him so fiercely no longer existed.

She had moved on long ago, leaving their past behind like discarded pages of an old book.

The irony wasn't lost on her—Ethan, who had once betrayed her without hesitation, now clung to the hope that she might love him again.

Yet Evelyn remained silent.

Ethan wouldn’t hear her truth anyway.

If she wanted to escape, she had to play along—at least for now.

She needed to placate him, lull him into complacency.

Only then could she find a way out of this gilded prison.

Being trapped in this isolated villa, waiting helplessly for rescue, was not an option.

She refused to be that powerless.

After a long pause, Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet Ethan's intense stare.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she clutched the edge of her sweater.

The air between them grew thick with unspoken words.

"Tell me the truth," she whispered, voice barely audible.

Ethan's jaw tightened, shadows flickering across his face in the dim light.

He took a step closer, the scent of his cologne wrapping around her.

"Would you believe me if I said yes?" His deep voice sent shivers down her spine.

Evelyn swallowed hard, memories flashing through her mind.

The betrayal.

The pain.

The empty promises.

Yet here he stood, looking at her with those piercing eyes that always saw too much.

She turned away, staring at the rain-streaked window.

"Why now?" The question hung between them like a blade.

Ethan reached out, his fingers brushing her wrist.

"Because I can't pretend anymore."

Her breath caught at the raw honesty in his tone.

The grandfather clock in the corner ticked loudly, counting the seconds of silence.

Evelyn closed her eyes, fighting the tears threatening to fall.

When she opened them again, Ethan was still watching her, waiting.

Always waiting.

"Stay," she finally said, the word tasting foreign on her tongue.

A slow smile curved his lips, lighting up his entire face.

It was the same smile that had stolen her heart years ago.

And just like before, she was powerless against it.

###Chapter 392 Divorce

Ethan's voice was firm. "Absolutely. I never go back on my word."

I crossed my arms. "And Vanessa? She's carrying your child, yet you haven't even visited her?"

His expression darkened. "I've made it clear—that child means nothing to me. I don't love her. Just the sight of her makes me sick now."

He clearly wanted to drop the subject, shifting his attention elsewhere.

With a dramatic flourish, he opened the trunk of his car, revealing an extravagant haul.

Dresses. Designer handbags. Diamond necklaces. Soon, the entire living room glittered with luxury.

"Evelyn, I handpicked every single item for you." Ethan gestured proudly at the display. "Tell me what else you desire. I'll have it delivered by tomorrow."

His generosity knew no bounds. A quick glance told me even the simplest blouse cost a fortune.

Among the treasures were rare, limited-edition bags—the kind even money couldn't easily buy.

My fingers brushed over a delicate perfume bottle.

Without warning, I uncapped it and sprayed a mist directly at him.

She held up the delicate glass bottle. "What do you think of this scent?"

Ethan froze. He hadn't anticipated Evelyn initiating a conversation about something so trivial.

His pulse quickened. If she's asking my opinion on perfume, does that mean she's finally opening up to me?

A hopeful smile tugged at his lips. "It's lovely," he answered, voice warm with barely contained delight.

Evelyn studied the bottle, her expression unreadable. The floral notes made her stomach churn—her morning sickness had been relentless these past weeks.

But she forced a serene smile. If pretending to tolerate this cloying fragrance would lower his guard, she'd endure it.

Then, casually, as if discussing the weather—"What brand does Vanessa prefer?"

The question hit like ice water. "Evelyn—"

Just moments ago, he'd dared to hope. The way she'd examined the perfume, he'd foolishly imagined gifting her an entire collection.

And yet, here they were again.

His jaw tightened. "Why does she matter so much to you?"

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "If you truly want this," she said, fingers tightening around the bottle, "go back to Whitmore Manor right now. Get her to sign the papers."

The unspoken demand hung between them—Prove it.

Evelyn gazed into Ethan's eyes, closing the distance between them with deliberate steps. Her fingers brushed against his, feather-light.

"How else would I know if your feelings are genuine?" she murmured. "You've never truly shown me your love, have you?"

Her delicate features were inches from his, her breath warm against his skin.

Ethan's pulse quickened. The woman he had obsessed over for so long was finally within reach. His arms moved instinctively, craving the weight of her against him.

Evelyn didn't pull away.

Disgust coiled in her stomach, but she forced herself to comply, sliding her hands around his waist.

Ethan froze.

He hadn't expected her to embrace him first. A rush of triumph surged through him. His fingers traced the curve of her cheek, tilting her face toward his.

Evelyn flinched, turning her head sharply.

"Ethan," she whispered, resting her forehead against his shoulder. "Not until the divorce is final."

Her wide, innocent eyes held his, filled with such fragile purity that it made him hesitate. To push further now would be sacrilege.

The familiar scent of Evelyn enveloped him, bringing an unexpected sense of calm. At last, he held the woman he adored, and for the first time in weeks, contentment settled over him.

When physical attraction burned this intensely, resistance was futile. The need to close the distance, to claim, was instinctive.

And right now, Ethan Caldwell wanted nothing more than to pull Evelyn Carter closer.

Love made him reckless. It made him crave her touch, her kiss, every forbidden inch of her.

"Once I bring you the signed divorce papers, you'll give me a real chance?" His voice was rough with uncertainty, fingers tightening around her waist. "You promise, Evelyn?"

She exhaled, nodding. "Yes. That's the deal."

"Then wait for me."

Without another word, Ethan turned on his heel and strode toward the gates.

Evelyn watched his car disappear down the driveway before finally releasing the breath she'd been holding.

Please don't disappoint me.

Please come back.

Whitmore Manor stood an hour's drive from Hawthorne Estate.

Ethan didn't hesitate. The moment his car pulled away, he ordered his driver straight to the Whitmore residence.

His phone buzzed—Nathan Reeves, his ever-efficient assistant, was already calling.

The moment Ethan stepped back into Whitmore Manor, his assistant Nathan was already waiting in the foyer with two freshly printed documents in hand.

"I've revised the terms as you instructed," Nathan said, adjusting his glasses. "The child support has been raised to eighty million. If she signs, the total settlement will be one hundred million."

The papers felt heavy in Ethan's grip.

He had expected this moment for months, yet now that it was here, his chest tightened inexplicably.

The numbers were generous—more than fair.

But would Evelyn even care about the money?

She had never been the type to be swayed by wealth.

Still, this was the only way.

A clean break.

No more complications.

No more pain.

He exhaled sharply, his fingers tightening around the documents.

"Make sure she gets them by tonight."

Nathan nodded, already pulling out his phone to arrange the delivery.

Ethan turned away, his jaw clenched.

This was for the best.

Wasn't it?

Yet as he walked toward his study, the weight of the decision settled over him like a storm cloud.

One signature.

And everything would change.

Forever.

A hundred million dollars was no small sum.

Even among the elite, few could casually produce such an amount.

Ethan Caldwell had only offered such generous terms because he was desperate to remove Vanessa Hart from the picture—quickly.

After all, he had known Evelyn Carter for years. He understood her limits. She wouldn’t keep giving him chances.

This was his opportunity. If he failed to act now, if he disappointed her again, there would be no redemption left.

By the time he returned to Whitmore Manor, his decision was final.

Vanessa had to go.

Ethan tucked the documents under his arm and stepped inside, only to freeze in the foyer.

There, seated in the living room with effortless poise, was Alexander Whitmore.

Alexander lounged on the sofa, flipping through the financial section of the morning paper as if he belonged there.

Ethan’s breath caught.

This wasn’t part of the plan.

###Chapter 393 Unease

Otherwise, Alexander wouldn't have remained so composed. He would have confronted Ethan long ago.

It appeared Alexander didn’t care deeply about Evelyn after all.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so indifferent.

Ethan walked past Alexander and offered a polite greeting. "Uncle Alexander."

Alexander lowered his newspaper and met Ethan's gaze.

Their eyes locked. The overpowering scent of perfume clinging to Ethan was unmistakable. Alexander merely gave a curt nod, his expression unreadable.

As Ethan ascended the stairs, Alexander's gaze darkened.

He knew instantly—Ethan had seen Evelyn.

The perfume was one he recognized all too well. He had seen it on Evelyn’s vanity countless times.

The scent wasn’t just lingering on Ethan—it was drenched into his clothes, as if deliberately sprayed onto him.

Alexander understood. This was Evelyn’s message.

She was signaling that she was trapped, unable to reach him.

Without hesitation, Alexander turned to Simon beside him. "Find out where he just came from."

Alexander Whitmore gave a curt nod as Simon Graves exited the room.

Minutes later, Simon returned, his expression grim. "Sir, I hit a dead end."

Alexander's brows furrowed. "Explain."

Simon hesitated before continuing. "Ethan Caldwell switched vehicles multiple times during his route—clearly trying to throw us off. Each car stopped briefly in surveillance blind spots. We lost track of his movements entirely. There’s no way to trace his origin point."

A cold smirk curled Alexander’s lips.

He hadn’t anticipated Ethan’s level of caution.

Confronting him directly wasn’t an option. Not when Evelyn Carter was still in his grasp.

Ethan had already proven he wouldn’t back down from threats. If pushed too far, he might retaliate against Evelyn.

And that was a risk Alexander couldn’t take.

His fingers clenched into fists at his sides.

For now, restraint was the only play.

As long as he didn’t provoke Ethan, Evelyn would remain unharmed.

But patience had its limits.

And Alexander’s were wearing thin.

Alexander's first instinct was to rush to her rescue, but Evelyn's safety remained his top priority.

"Have someone discreetly tail him," Alexander commanded, his voice low and urgent. "Track his movements after he leaves. Make sure he doesn’t notice."

Simon gave a firm nod. "Understood. I’ll handle it immediately."

He turned to leave but hesitated, pivoting back with a sudden realization.

Alexander frowned. "What is it?"

Simon pulled out his phone, swiping through records. "While investigating Mrs. Caldwell’s recent activities, I discovered something unexpected. The night you were away in Griffore, she booked a last-minute flight from Cresthaven to Griffore."

Alexander’s breath hitched. "She was coming to see me?"

Simon tapped the screen, displaying the airline confirmation. "This was the same day you ignored her calls."

The weight of the revelation settled heavily in Alexander’s chest.

He had been so preoccupied with business that he hadn’t noticed—hadn’t even considered—that Evelyn might have been trying to reach him.

Now, with danger looming, the regret burned sharper than ever.

Simon’s voice softened. "I thought you should know."

Alexander exhaled slowly, his jaw tightening. "Find her. Now."

Every second counted.

And this time, he wouldn’t fail her.

###Chapter 394 Scent of Longing

"It seems Mrs. Caldwell intended to surprise you at dawn."

Simon exhaled heavily. "Mrs. Caldwell truly cherishes you. You ignored her call for just one day, yet she couldn't bear waiting any longer."

Alexander's chest tightened with conflicting emotions.

Regret clawed at him.

What had possessed me that day?

He had ignored Evelyn's call for an entire day.

Why had I been so stubborn?

Did I disappoint her?

Did I break her heart?

The ache to see Evelyn surged through him like wildfire.

He couldn't stand another second apart.

Alexander needed to pull her into his arms, to breathe in her familiar lavender scent, to press his lips to hers and whisper his apologies.

He would tell her how much he loved her.

How foolish he'd been.

How he'd never let his pride come between them again.

Never again would he risk losing her.

Alexander's expression darkened with resolve as he—

Alexander Whitmore glanced at Simon Graves. "Get a car ready for me too. I'll be following Ethan Caldwell personally later."

Simon gave a firm nod.

With over a decade in the police academy, Alexander's training wasn't just about physical endurance—it included advanced tracking techniques.

He had absolute confidence in his skills.

Back in his academy days, he had always outperformed his peers in every mission.

Countless criminals had fallen into his hands. Tracking Ethan would be child's play.

Eleanor wasn't home—likely out playing mahjong with her friends.

Vanessa Hart, on the other hand, was staying at Whitmore Manor, resting due to her pregnancy. She had grown noticeably less active lately, her figure softening.

The reason? The food was too indulgent.

Eleanor, paranoid about Vanessa's well-being, had forbidden her from leaving the estate. These days, Vanessa's only outings were short strolls through the garden.

Ethan's sudden arrival caught Vanessa completely off guard.

After all, unless it was a holiday, Ethan never visited voluntarily—let alone unannounced.

The air thickened with tension as Vanessa's fingers tightened around the edge of her chair.

She hadn't expected him to show up now.

Not when she had so much to hide.

Vanessa knew with absolute certainty that Ethan despised her.

It wasn't merely because of that infamous violin incident years ago when she'd deceived him.

More damning was Valentine's Day, when she'd orchestrated the perfect scene - painting herself as the victim while shoving Ethan into the icy lake with her own hands.

Ethan couldn't swim. That single act had shattered any possibility of reconciliation between them.

There was no love in Ethan's heart for her. Not even basic tolerance remained, let alone belief in her carefully crafted lies.

When Vanessa spotted Ethan approaching, her breath hitched for three full seconds.

She forced her lips into a practiced smile, stepping forward with outstretched arms. "Ethan darling! Did you come to see me? Have you missed me?"

Before he could respond, Vanessa seized his hand possessively.

Then she froze.

The distinct aroma of women's perfume clung to his clothes.

Though faint, the floral notes were unmistakably feminine.

This was impossible. Ethan had severe mysophobia and avoided nightclub women like the plague.

Her grip tightened unconsciously as her mind raced. Who had been close enough to leave their scent on him? The implications made her stomach churn.

Vanessa's smile turned brittle as she inhaled again, confirming the betrayal lingering on his tailored suit. The fragrance was expensive, sophisticated - not some cheap bar girl's perfume.

Her nails dug into his palm as dark realization dawned. Someone had breached Ethan's notorious personal space. Someone he'd allowed close enough to leave their mark.

And that someone wasn't her.

The Eclipse Lounge pulsed with energy as Alexander's friends lounged with their dates draped over them. Yet the space beside Alexander remained conspicuously empty, as always.

Vanessa had always admired his self-control. It was one of the qualities that first drew her to him.

But tonight was different.

The moment Alexander stepped through the door, an unfamiliar floral fragrance clung to him like a second skin. The scent was delicate yet unmistakable - expensive French perfume.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms. Everyone knew Alexander only had eyes for Evelyn.

Her mind raced with possibilities.

"Did they finally reconcile?"

"Was this Evelyn's perfume lingering on his clothes?"

The questions burned through her like acid.

Vanessa watched as Alexander absently touched his collar, his fingers brushing against where the scent seemed strongest. A ghost of a smile played on his lips before he schooled his features back into their usual impassive mask.

She'd never seen him like this before.

The realization hit her like a physical blow - something had changed between them. Something fundamental.

Vanessa's champagne flute trembled in her hand as she fought to maintain her composure. The bitter taste of betrayal coated her tongue, though she couldn't say for certain what exactly had been betrayed.

All she knew was that the man standing before her wasn't the same Alexander Whitmore she thought she understood.

And that terrified her more than anything.

###Chapter 395 Divorce

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms, her chest constricting with a storm of conflicting emotions.

She bit back the words burning on her tongue.

Not now. Not with Ethan.

Their marriage had been crumbling for months, and accusing him over Evelyn's lingering perfume would only drive the final wedge between them.

That incident at the lake still hung between them—her shoving him into the water, his icy glare afterward. Repairing their relationship required patience, not provocation.

So when the faint trace of jasmine and vanilla—Evelyn's signature scent—drifted from his collar, Vanessa clenched her jaw and looked away.

Ethan didn’t even meet her eyes as he dropped two crisp documents onto the coffee table.

Then he sank into the leather sofa, his posture rigid, his expression unreadable.

His tailored suit was immaculate, his tie perfectly knotted, every inch the composed CEO. But the way his gaze slid past her—like she was nothing, less than nothing—cut deeper than any blade.

The bold black letters on the top page made her breath hitch.

Divorce Agreement.

Her hands trembled.

To him, she wasn’t worth a second glance. Not even the courtesy he’d show a passing stranger.

The truth struck her like a physical blow.

How had everything fallen apart so completely?

She still loved him—desperately.

She wouldn’t have fought so hard to become his wife otherwise.

Once, he had loved her too.

But now, even with Alexander sitting right in front of her, the distance between them felt insurmountable.

She could have accepted it if he simply didn’t love her anymore. She could have even endured him asking for a divorce.

But knowing it was because of Evelyn?

That made every sacrifice, every year she had given him, utterly meaningless.

At four months pregnant, her belly had begun to curve noticeably, especially with the extra weight she’d gained.

Her steps were slow as she approached him, stopping just before the sofa.

His gaze flickered down to the gentle swell of her stomach, impossible to ignore now.

Vanessa pressed her palm against her belly, then reached for his hand, guiding it to rest where their child grew.

"Alexander," she whispered, her voice trembling. "Can you feel him? This is your son. Our son. If you leave me… will you leave him too?"

The air between them was thick with tension, heavy enough to suffocate.

Vanessa's fingers trembled as they clutched at Ethan's sleeve, her voice breaking.

"He just kicked. Are you really going to abandon us? Destroy everything we've built?"

A single tear escaped, tracing a path down her cheek before landing on his skin, warm and desperate.

Her sorrow would have moved any man—but Ethan Caldwell wasn't just any man.

His gaze remained icy, unyielding, as if her pain meant nothing to him.

He didn’t even glance at her again.

With a sharp motion, he pulled his hand free, leaving Vanessa standing there, stunned.

For a heartbeat, she couldn’t believe he could be so cruel.

Ethan barely reacted, his expression carved from stone as he met her eyes.

"Vanessa," he said, voice devoid of warmth, "I’m giving you a billion. What more could you possibly want? Take it and go. Spare me the performance—it doesn’t work on me."

His words were a blade, slicing through the silence between them.

Secret Longing: A Love That Defies All Odds…

A billion dollars in alimony was beyond generous. Ethan could have left her with nothing.

It was Vanessa who had destroyed everything between them. Their relationship had been built on her web of lies from the very beginning.

And when she pushed him into that lake, fully aware he couldn’t swim, she had shattered whatever lingering affection he might have still held for her.

“Do you think I’ve forgotten?” Ethan stepped closer, gripping her chin just hard enough to make her flinch. “Your tears mean nothing to me. Did you really believe I’d trust you now?”

His fingers tightened, the pressure turning her skin crimson.

The sharp pain forced a gasp from her lips, tears spilling uncontrollably down her cheeks.

But Ethan didn’t release her. Instead, his grip only grew firmer. “Vanessa, do you have any idea what happens to people who betray me? I’ve let you get away with too much already. Did you honestly think you could deceive me?”

Vanessa staggered back, collapsing onto the bed.

A cold sweat traced down her spine as she stared up at him, fear tightening her chest.

Vanessa's teeth sank into her lower lip as she struggled to stand. Her legs trembled violently before giving out completely, sending her crashing back onto the hardwood floor.

"Ethan, you don’t understand! That night—it wasn’t what it looked like. Please, just let me explain!"

"An accident?" His voice dripped with scorn. "You expect me to believe you didn’t lace that drink? That you didn’t orchestrate the whole damn scene, dragging my entire family into your twisted little drama? You wanted to destroy Evelyn, didn’t you? Play the victim and soak up everyone’s pity like some tragic heroine?"

A harsh laugh escaped him as he shook his head. "Pathetic. An illegitimate brat throwing a tantrum, drowning in crocodile tears. It’s disgusting."

"Ethan, I swear, that’s not what happened!"

But he was done listening. Done with her lies.

His fingers tapped impatiently against the divorce papers spread across the table. "Sign them. Now. Don’t make this harder than it has to be."

Vanessa’s pulse raced. She couldn’t sign. She wouldn’t.

Eleanor wasn’t here to intervene. Alexander had only just arrived home.

Desperation clawed at her throat. She raised her voice, sharp and shrill, hoping someone—anyone—would hear.

"I won’t sign! Your mother would never allow this! She cares about this baby—are you really going to—"

Her words cut off as his cold glare silenced her.

The air between them crackled with tension.

And in that moment, Vanessa realized—she was completely alone.

###Chapter 396 Calling for Backup

"Don't you dare mention my mother."

Vanessa's stalling tactics were obvious—she was clearly trying to buy time, possibly to call for help. Sensing this, Ethan tightened his grip on her wrist, forcing the pen toward the divorce papers.

Her face drained of color, but she was no match for his strength.

She twisted in his hold, screaming for someone to intervene. Just as the tip of the pen hovered over the document, a sharp knock echoed through the room.

Alexander leaned casually against the doorframe, his lips curling into a mocking smirk. "What's all the shouting about?"

Vanessa's head snapped up as if she'd been thrown a lifeline.

Tears streaked down her cheeks as she sobbed, "Alexander! Ethan is forcing me to sign the divorce papers!"

She was certain that since Ethan wanted to leave her for Evelyn, Alexander wouldn’t just stand by and watch.

After all, he was the head of the Whitmore family—Ethan’s uncle.

If he stepped in, at least for now, Ethan wouldn’t be able to push her any further.

"Divorce?" Alexander's voice dropped dangerously low, his icy glare making the air in the room turn frigid.

His piercing gaze locked onto Ethan. "And what, exactly, is your reason for this?"

"Ethan, have you found someone else?"

The words slipped from my lips before I could stop them. My fingers trembled around the phone, the silence on the other end stretching unbearably.

Ethan Caldwell—my ex-fiancé, the man who had once promised me forever—had been nothing but a ghost since my release from prison.

And now, here he was, calling me out of the blue.

I could hear his sharp inhale, the hesitation in his voice. "Evelyn, it's not what you think."

A bitter laugh escaped me. "Then what is it, Ethan? Because last I checked, you vanished the moment I needed you the most."

The line crackled with tension.

Then, a woman's voice cut through—light, melodic, and painfully familiar.

Vanessa.

My stepsister.

The one who had stolen everything from me.

"Evelyn," Ethan finally spoke, his tone laced with something I couldn't place. "I need your help."

My grip on the phone tightened.

Help?

After everything?

A cold smirk curled my lips. "Funny. I seem to recall you weren't big on helping me when I was rotting in a cell."

His silence was answer enough.

But then he said the one thing I never expected.

"It's about Alexander."

My breath hitched.

Alexander Whitmore—my husband, the man who had pulled me from the wreckage of my past.

The man who had given me a second chance.

"What about him?" My voice was steel.

Ethan exhaled sharply. "He's in trouble, Evelyn. And if you don't act fast, he won't make it out alive."

The world tilted.

My pulse roared in my ears.

Alexander.

In danger.

Because of Ethan.

I swallowed the bile rising in my throat. "Where is he?"

Ethan hesitated. "Meet me at Eclipse Lounge. Midnight. Come alone."

The line went dead.

I stared at the phone, my mind racing.

This was a trap.

It had to be.

But if there was even a sliver of truth to his words…

I couldn't risk it.

Not when it came to Alexander.

I grabbed my coat, my fingers dialing another number.

"Nathan," I said the moment the call connected. "I need backup."

Because if Ethan thought I was walking into this blind, he had another thing coming.

And this time, I wouldn't be the one left broken.

###Chapter 397 Sowing Discord

Ethan Caldwell had no intention of dragging Alexander Whitmore into this mess. It would only make things worse.

A pang of guilt twisted in his chest—especially since he was still keeping Evelyn Carter close.

"Uncle Alexander, this is between us. Stay out of it!"

Alexander’s lips curled into a mocking smirk.

"Between you? You were the one declaring to the world you’d marry her, and now you want a divorce out of nowhere? Treating marriage like some fleeting whim?" His voice dripped with disdain. "The Whitmore family doesn’t tolerate such disgrace. As its head, I can’t ignore this."

Ethan’s temper flared.

"Our relationship is dead. If I want a divorce, I don’t owe anyone an explanation." His jaw tightened. "I can’t even stand being in the same room as Vanessa anymore. Why the hell would I need your permission?"

His bluntness stunned even Vanessa.

No one in the Whitmore family dared speak to Alexander like that.

"Fine. You don’t need my approval," Alexander said, his tone turning icy.

"But you don’t get to slink away from a marriage you flaunted to the entire city."

"If you're serious about ending this, I'll make sure it's permanent."

Before Ethan could respond, Alexander already had his phone out. "Prepare a press conference immediately. Contact every major outlet. We're making an official statement about the Caldwell family today."

"Uncle Alexander, what the hell are you doing?" Ethan's voice was sharp with disbelief.

Alexander smirked. "Once the media gets involved, even your mother won't be able to stop this. Isn't this exactly how you forced Vanessa into the family in the first place? Consider this my way of returning the favor."

Ethan's jaw tightened. "This will turn us into a public spectacle!"

Their rushed marriage had already been controversial enough.

"Too late for that. You're already the hottest gossip in Cresthaven," Alexander fired back.

Ethan's expression darkened.

As much as he hated to admit it, Alexander wasn’t wrong.

He never expected cutting ties with Vanessa would be this messy.

When he married her, people whispered behind his back. Now that he wanted out, suddenly everyone had an opinion—and none of them were on his side.

Frustration boiled over. He shot Vanessa one last searing glare before storming out of Whitmore Manor.

With Alexander interfering, he knew things were about to get worse.

The moment Ethan Caldwell left, Vanessa Hart exhaled sharply, her shoulders relaxing as she turned to Alexander Whitmore.

"Thank you," she murmured, though her gratitude was laced with caution.

Without his timely intervention, she might have been cornered into signing that wretched agreement.

Alexander's gaze remained icy, his voice cutting through the tension. "Don’t mistake this for kindness."

Vanessa hesitated, then a thought struck her.

"Alexander," she began carefully, "did you notice his cologne?"

If Ethan was rekindling something with Evelyn Carter, Alexander wouldn’t tolerate it. Vanessa was certain the strain in her own relationship with Ethan was entirely Evelyn’s doing.

A spark of anticipation flickered in her eyes. If Alexander turned against Evelyn, things would unravel beautifully.

Alexander arched a brow, silently urging her to continue.

"That scent on Ethan—it’s identical to Evelyn’s signature perfume." Vanessa lowered her voice, feigning concern. "Do you think she’s been meeting him behind your back? Maybe reigniting old flames?"

The air between them thickened with unspoken implications.

Vanessa held her breath, waiting for the storm to break.

###Chapter 398 Shadowed Steps

Alexander's piercing gaze cut through Vanessa's words the instant they left her lips.

His voice was ice. "Vanessa, is this your pathetic attempt to cause drama? What makes you think you have any right?"

Vanessa's face drained of color. "Alexander, I'm being honest. Evelyn is clearly—"

"Do you honestly believe my marriage is as toxic as yours with Ethan? Built on lies and suspicion?"

The disgust in his eyes was palpable.

"When I married Evelyn, I promised to trust her completely. Perfume isn't exclusive. What's your endgame?"

"Alexander—"

"Focus on keeping your own man from straying. I intervened this time, but next time? Don't count on luck."

Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode away.

Vanessa stood rooted, teeth sinking into her lower lip until she tasted copper.

It infuriated her. No matter what she did, Evelyn always won.

A storm of jealousy and fury raged inside Vanessa, her lips pressing into a bloodless line as she clawed for a way to turn the tables.

Across town, Ethan Caldwell lounged in his car, the window cracked just enough to let the smoke from his cigarette curl into the night air.

Evelyn had made her terms clear—she would only entertain reconciliation if he ended things with Vanessa for good.

This was his one shot.

But thanks to Alexander, his carefully laid plans had crumbled once again.

He could force Vanessa to sign the divorce papers, but pushing too hard might make Alexander suspicious.

And Alexander had no idea Evelyn was still tangled in Ethan’s web.

Frustration gnawed at him, driving him straight to the dimly lit Eclipse Lounge to drown his irritation in whiskey.

What he didn’t know?

Alexander was watching from the shadows.

Ethan drank until dawn.

Alexander waited, silent and unseen, the entire time.

The neon lights of Eclipse Lounge flickered against the wet pavement.

Alexander narrowed his eyes, spotting his opportunity. With a turn of the key, his engine purred to life as he began tailing the other vehicle.

Ethan Caldwell slumped in the backseat, fingers pressing against his throbbing temples.

The city lights blurred past the tinted windows as he wrestled with his thoughts. How would he explain himself to Evelyn when he returned to Hawthorne Estate?

Ending things with Vanessa had proven far messier than anticipated.

A familiar glow caught his attention—Maple Leaf Café, its retro sign still hanging crookedly just as it had during his university years.

Evelyn used to love their pastries.

"Pull over," he ordered abruptly.

The sedan swerved to the curb. Ethan emerged, returning minutes later with two paper-wrapped sandwiches. He handed one to the driver.

"Keep the heat on," he instructed, cradling his own parcel like contraband.

Three miles later, they turned into a service alley where the streetlights had long burned out. No cameras. No witnesses.

Ethan stepped onto the cracked asphalt, scanning the shadows before slipping into a waiting SUV.

Tires screeched as both vehicles vanished into opposite ends of the night.

Alexander Whitmore observed the unfolding scene from a distance, the corner of his lips curling into a smirk as he lit a cigarette.

The dim lighting made it difficult for most to discern which vehicle Ethan Caldwell occupied. But for a man like Alexander, who had spent years tracking down elusive targets, it was child’s play.

Without hesitation, he followed the first car that began moving again.

Two miles later, the lead vehicle came to a halt.

This time, four other cars lurked in the shadows, waiting.

Alexander had an uncanny ability to identify Ethan’s exact location.

Yet, just as Ethan attempted to switch cars for the fourth time, something unexpected occurred.

###Chapter 399 Enemy of the Enemy

Ethan Caldwell took far longer than usual to switch vehicles this time.

From a safe distance of a hundred yards, Alexander Whitmore could only watch, frustration gnawing at him. He had no idea what was happening inside the car.

Just as Ethan settled into the driver’s seat of his new ride, the back door suddenly swung open. A stranger slid in beside him without hesitation.

Ethan’s grip tightened on the steering wheel as he shot the man a sharp, distrustful glare.

“Who the hell are you?”

The intruder had a jagged scar above his eyebrow and a cigarette dangling lazily from his lips. Everything about him screamed trouble.

“You’ve got a tail,” Zachary Black said, exhaling a slow stream of smoke before rolling down the window to flick the ashes. “And you didn’t even notice, did you?”

He smirked, tapping the cigarette against the edge of the window.

“Thought your little car-swap was clever? To Alexander Whitmore, that’s amateur hour.”

Ethan’s eyes narrowed dangerously. “I’ll ask one more time—who are you?”

Zachary leaned back, unfazed. “Doesn’t matter who I am. What matters is I can help you lose him.”

The car’s engine hummed softly as the city lights blurred past the windows.

Ethan tightened his grip on the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white.

"We’re almost there," he muttered, more to himself than to the man beside him. "Do you really think switching cars again will make a difference?"

Zachary exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his expression unreadable. "You tell me."

Ethan’s gaze flicked to the rearview mirror.

There it was—a sleek black sedan parked in the shadows, its headlights dark.

It hadn’t been there when they’d pulled in.

A cold knot formed in his stomach.

How long has he been following me?

He had been careful. He’d taken detours, changed vehicles twice.

Yet, Alexander was still on his trail.

Had he figured it out? Did he know Evelyn was with him?

The thought sent a sharp jolt of unease through him.

Zachary smirked, flicking ash out the window. "Relax, Caldwell. I couldn’t care less about your little hide-and-seek game."

Ethan’s jaw clenched.

This wasn’t just a game.

And Alexander Whitmore was no ordinary opponent.

Ethan Caldwell's gaze sharpened. He knew favors like this never came free.

"What's your angle?" His voice was ice. "What do you want?"

"Let's just say your uncle and I have... history."

That got Ethan's attention.

Zachary Black was the man who'd trapped Evelyn Carter in that derelict warehouse months ago.

He'd rigged the place to explode with her inside, but the cops had stormed in before he could flip the switch.

And now, somehow, he was walking free again.

Ethan's lips curled in silent contempt.

This man was gutter trash—nothing like him, born with a platinum spoon in his mouth.

Disgust coiled in his gut, but years of polished manners kept his expression neutral.

He guessed Zachary must have crossed paths with Alexander Whitmore during police training.

The specifics didn't matter. Ethan had zero interest in digging through Zachary's filthy past.

Zachary smirked, as if sensing Ethan's revulsion.

He crushed his cigarette against the windowsill and flicked it into the night.

The dim glow of the city lights filtered through the blinds, casting long shadows across the room.

Evelyn Carter leaned against the cold marble counter, her fingers tracing the rim of her untouched whiskey glass.

Across from her, Alexander Whitmore regarded her with an unreadable expression, his sharp features half-hidden in the dim lighting.

"Listen," Evelyn began, her voice low but steady. "I might not be the hero of this story, but there's an old saying—the enemy of my enemy is your temporary ally. You understand what I'm saying, don't you?"

Alexander's lips curled slightly, though his eyes remained guarded.

"Life isn't just black and white," she continued, swirling the amber liquid in her glass. "It's about strategy. And as the CEO of Titan Capital, I know you're no stranger to weighing risks and rewards."

The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken tension.

Outside, the distant hum of the city was a reminder of the world still turning beyond these walls—a world where alliances shifted like sand, and trust was a currency few could afford.

Evelyn met his gaze, her own unwavering.

"So," she murmured, "are we going to play this game together, or do I walk out that door alone?"

###Chapter 400 Failure

The moment Zachary spoke, Ethan Caldwell hesitated, his mind racing through possibilities.

Even after changing vehicles twice, Alexander Whitmore remained hot on his trail. Without Zachary's assistance, he knew any further attempts to outmaneuver him would be futile.

But the man's notorious reputation gave him pause.

"Let's get one thing straight," Ethan said, his voice sharp with warning. "I won't be part of anything illegal. That's non-negotiable. Propose something else, and I might consider it."

Zachary smirked, tilting his head slightly.

"Wouldn't dream of dragging you into anything shady. You're the golden heir, after all. Someone like me? I know my place."

"Then what exactly do you want?" Ethan's expression darkened, an unspoken tension thickening the air between them.

"Just a favor. I haven't decided what yet, but I'll let you know when I do."

Ethan glanced at his watch.

It was already past one in the morning.

If he didn’t hurry back, the sandwiches he’d ordered for Evelyn would be ice-cold by the time he returned.

"That's the spirit I admire!"

Zachary Black flashed a wicked grin, swinging the car door open with dramatic flair. With a careless wave, he sauntered away.

The driver glanced back. "Sir, should we leave now?"

"Go," Ethan Caldwell replied curtly.

The car sped off, vanishing into the dark embrace of the night.

From the shadows, Alexander Whitmore had been watching. He had seen someone enter and exit Ethan’s car, and as the vehicle disappeared, his instincts screamed at him to give chase.

But fate had other plans.

Three sleek black cars suddenly swerved in front of him, forming an impenetrable wall. One even circled him mockingly, tires screeching against the pavement.

Alexander’s jaw tightened.

Ethan had anticipated him.

No time for games.

His fingers flexed around the steering wheel before slamming the accelerator. The car responded instantly, executing a flawless drift that sent it slicing through the blockade like a blade through silk.

Zachary’s eyes widened in disbelief.

He hadn’t expected such precision from Alexander.

Snapping into action, he lunged forward—only for a massive freight truck to roar into his path, cutting him off with a deafening rumble.

By the time the truck lumbered past, the road was empty.

Alexander was gone.

Zachary Black's car had disappeared into the night. Ethan Caldwell exhaled sharply, irritation twisting his features, though he couldn't deny a flicker of reluctant respect.

Meanwhile, Alexander Whitmore accelerated down the darkened road, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. Frustration burned in his chest like embers refusing to die.

After the chaos of the ambush, he found himself driving without direction, scanning every shadow for any sign of Ethan.

The road split into multiple paths ahead. Alexander cursed under his breath, the weight of his failure pressing down on him.

If not for that sudden attack, Ethan wouldn’t have slipped through his fingers so easily.

Ethan smirked as he shook off Alexander’s pursuit, weaving through backstreets before finally returning to Hawthorne Estate.

The light in Evelyn Carter’s bedroom still glowed against the late hour.

She stood by the window, her fingers pressed against the glass, searching the darkness for any sign of him.

When no headlights followed Ethan’s car, her shoulders slumped in disappointment.

She had drenched herself in perfume earlier, hoping that clinging to Ethan would spark jealousy in Alexander—or at least provoke Vanessa Hart.

No woman would stand by while her husband tangled with another.

Vanessa Hart was counting on Evelyn Carter to make her move.

She had been certain Evelyn would send someone to monitor Ethan Caldwell's every step. That would have been her perfect opportunity to vanish without a trace.

But as minutes stretched into hours, Evelyn remained frustratingly inactive.

Vanessa's hope withered.

She had clearly overestimated her stepsister's cunning.

A bitter realization settled in her chest—this plan had failed spectacularly.

Her fingers curled into fists. Another chance might not come for months.

Then—

A sharp knock shattered the tense silence.

Ethan's smooth voice filtered through the door.

###Chapter 401 There’s No Going Back

"Evelyn, are you awake? I brought you something to eat."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, her voice barely above a whisper but laced with resolve. "I'm not hungry. You can have it."

Without another word, she turned away and flicked off the lamp, casting the room into shadow.

But Ethan didn’t leave. "Evelyn, you’ve hardly touched anything in days. You’re wasting away. How can you not be hungry? At least come see what I got for you."

His tone was soft, almost desperate, but Evelyn exhaled sharply, exhaustion weighing her down.

"Ethan, I told you—I’m not hungry. We’ll talk tomorrow. Right now, I just want to sleep."

She couldn’t bear another pointless conversation with him, not when the night stretched endlessly before her.

Realizing he wouldn’t win this battle, Ethan finally relented. "Fine. Get some rest."

Yet he lingered outside her door, staring at the sliver of dim light beneath it.

A pang of sorrow twisted in his chest.

She used to adore him. Now, she couldn’t even stand the sound of his voice.

Ethan Caldwell was furious and needed space.

He was certain that if he gave her enough time, Evelyn would eventually soften.

Just then, a maid approached him. "Sir, the sandwich you brought back has been prepared. Would you like it now?"

He shook his head. "No, let the staff have it."

The maid hesitated. "But... didn’t you get that specifically for Ms. Carter? It’s quite rare."

"I’ll just fetch another one for her tomorrow."

Unbeknownst to him, Evelyn had heard every word from her bedroom.

She dismissed it at first, assuming it was just another one of Ethan’s careless remarks.

But the next morning, when she descended the stairs, her breath caught at the sight of a freshly made sandwich placed neatly on the dining table.

Ethan was already seated, his expression brightening the moment he saw her. "Evelyn, you must be starving. Come, eat something."

Her gaze flickered to the sandwich.

It was from that tiny bakery near her old high school—the one she used to visit religiously every weekend.

Years had passed since she last tasted it.

Evelyn lifted the delicate pastry to her lips, taking a hesitant bite. Almost immediately, her brows knitted together in displeasure.

“Well?” Ethan asked, his voice laced with hopeful anticipation.

Before she could respond, the housekeeper interjected eagerly. “Ms. Carter, you should know—Mr. Caldwell woke before sunrise just to stand in line for this. He wanted it to be fresh for you.”

Evelyn chewed slowly, then placed the pastry back on the plate with deliberate indifference. “It’s not the same.”

Ethan blinked, confused. He picked up a piece and took a bite himself. “What do you mean? It tastes exactly how it always has.”

“No,” she said coolly. “It’s different.”

The weight behind her words wasn’t lost on him.

“But it’s from the same bakery. Nothing’s changed.”

“Maybe you’ve just forgotten what it used to taste like.”

He nudged the plate toward her again, unwilling to concede. “Try another bite. I’m sure you’ll recognize it.”

Evelyn met his gaze steadily, her expression unreadable.

“The flavor is gone, Ethan. Just like us. Some things can’t be undone. Don’t you see that?”

A bitter laugh escaped him. “Evelyn, yesterday you told me that if I left Vanessa, you’d consider giving us another chance. Was that just a lie?”

###Chapter 402 His Promise

"Yes, I did say that." My voice was steady despite the storm inside me. "Well? Did the papers get signed?"

Ethan went completely still.

I wasn't surprised. If he had actually managed to get the divorce finalized, he would have shoved the documents in my face by now, triumphant.

"Evelyn, I do want to end things with her, but—"

His hesitation told me everything. He didn’t mention Alexander’s sudden interference, how he had stormed in and stopped everything.

Instead, his fingers tightened around mine, desperate. "I promise you," he said, voice rough with urgency, "I’ll be divorced within a month."

The look on his face was a mix of frustration and something almost pathetic.

I tried to pull away, but his grip was iron.

Then, without warning, he yanked me against him, arms locking around me like I might vanish if he let go.

The sudden warmth of his body against mine startled me.

His cologne—something expensive, musky—drifted over me, but the scent only made nausea rise in my throat.

Before I could stop myself, I shoved him back and bolted for the door.

The sandwich Evelyn had eaten earlier made a sudden, unwelcome reappearance.

Watching her struggle with morning sickness, Ethan felt a sharp pang of sympathy twist in his chest.

When she finally emerged from the bathroom, pale and exhausted, he wordlessly handed her a glass of water, his expression tight with concern.

Evelyn took a careful sip, the cool liquid soothing her throat.

But the water tasted oddly salty, and she frowned, glancing up at him in question.

"I called Dr. Wells," he explained, his voice low and earnest. "He suggested a pinch of salt might help settle your stomach."

"Thank you," she murmured, touched by his thoughtfulness.

"If you're still feeling unwell, just rest. I'll make you something else," he insisted, already striding toward the kitchen before she could respond.

Evelyn wasn’t tired, though.

Instead, she curled up on the couch and flicked on the TV, letting the mindless chatter of a talk show fill the room while her gaze kept drifting toward the kitchen.

Through the open doorway, she watched Ethan move with surprising efficiency, an apron tied around his waist.

The usually composed, sharp-edged man looked almost domestic as he cooked—his movements careful, his focus absolute.

It was strange, seeing him like this.

Not the ruthless businessman or the distant figure she’d once known, but a man preparing a meal for his wife.

For their child.

The thought sent an unexpected warmth through her.

Evelyn's fingertips traced absent circles over her abdomen, a storm of emotions swirling in her chest.

Maybe it was the love that had dimmed between them, leaving her feeling hollow and distant.

Her mind raced—seven days trapped in this gilded cage, seven days dreaming of freedom.

Just as she lost herself in thought, Ethan stepped out of the kitchen, balancing a plate in his hands.

"I made you carbonara," he murmured, placing it on the coffee table. "It's mild. You should be able to stomach it this time."

Noticing her slumped shoulders, he closed the distance between them, his intention obvious as he lifted a fork.

Evelyn turned her face away slightly. "I appreciate it, but I can feed myself."

He sank onto the couch beside her, his gaze never leaving her as she took small, deliberate bites.

It had been so long since they'd shared a quiet moment like this—strangely, it didn’t feel entirely unwelcome.

The woman he still loved was right there, within reach, and for a fleeting second, it was as if time had rewound to simpler days.

His fingers brushed against her cheek, tucking a loose curl behind her ear with aching gentleness.

"Evelyn," he whispered, his eyes flickering down to her stomach. "I want this—us—forever."

The words hung in the air between us, heavy with meaning.

Alexander's grip on my hand tightened, his gaze unwavering.

"I swear to you, Evelyn," he said, voice low but firm. "This child will be mine in every way that matters."

A shiver ran down my spine.

The weight of his promise settled over me like a warm blanket.

I searched his eyes—those deep, stormy gray eyes that had seen so much pain, yet still held such tenderness.

There was no hesitation there. No doubt.

Only fierce determination.

My free hand drifted unconsciously to my stomach.

The life growing inside me wasn't his by blood, but in that moment, I knew—it didn't matter.

Not to him.

Not to us.

Tears pricked at my eyes as I remembered the fear that had gripped me when I first discovered the pregnancy.

The shame.

The uncertainty.

All of it melted away under the intensity of Alexander's devotion.

He brought my hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to my knuckles.

"I'll be the father this child deserves," he murmured against my skin. "I'll protect them. Love them. Teach them."

A sob caught in my throat.

This man—this beautiful, broken, healing man—was offering everything without hesitation.

After everything we'd been through.

After all the betrayals.

The lies.

The pain.

Here he stood, ready to claim a child not his own as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

The last of my resistance crumbled.

I launched myself into his arms, burying my face in his chest.

His familiar scent—sandalwood and something uniquely Alexander—wrapped around me.

Strong arms encircled me, holding me together when I felt like I might fly apart.

"Thank you," I whispered into his shirt.

He rested his chin atop my head.

"No," he corrected gently. "Thank you, Evelyn. For trusting me with this. With your heart. With your future."

I tilted my head up to meet his gaze again.

The love shining back at me stole my breath.

In that moment, I knew—no matter what storms lay ahead, we would weather them together.

This child would grow up surrounded by love.

Protected.

Cherished.

And that was all that mattered.

###Chapter 403 The Reluctant Concession

Evelyn had exhausted all words with Ethan. She'd laid bare every truth, every painful detail.

Yet he remained trapped in his delusions, weaving fantasies where none existed.

It was as if he'd constructed an elaborate daydream and now sought to pull her into its suffocating embrace.

As she finished the last bite of the meal he'd prepared, a flicker of triumph crossed his features.

"I'll be staying here this week," he announced, wiping his hands on a dish towel. "Just name what you're craving—I'll make it happen."

Silence stretched between them like a taut wire.

The crushing reality of being imprisoned with him settled over Evelyn like a leaden cloak.

But survival instincts kicked in—she knew maintaining his fragile good humor was her only path to eventual freedom.

"Those designer pieces I sent yesterday," he pressed, leaning against the marble counter. "You didn't even try them on?"

Her laugh held no warmth. "What's the point of dressing up for a gilded cage?"

Most women adorned themselves to be seen. But she'd rather walk through fire than perform for her jailer.

The grandfather clock in the hall ticked ominously, counting down the hours of her captivity. Outside, a world continued turning without her—a world where Alexander must be tearing the city apart searching for her.

Ethan's phone buzzed with another message, likely from that snake Vanessa. Evelyn clenched her fork until her knuckles whitened.

"Eat up," he murmured, refilling her wine glass with expensive burgundy. "You'll need your strength."

The unspoken threat hung between them like a guillotine blade.

Somewhere beyond these gilded walls, a storm was gathering. And Evelyn intended to be its eye when it finally broke free.

An invisible barrier had formed between them.

Evelyn's rejection was palpable, and Ethan had no idea how to bridge the distance.

The television played softly in the background, broadcasting a segment about an upcoming concert in Cresthaven featuring a world-renowned pianist.

Evelyn found herself momentarily entranced by the performance.

Noticing her lingering gaze, Ethan spoke up. "You want to go, don't you? I remember you used to play the cello."

She flicked her eyes toward him before lowering them again. "You've made sure I can't leave this place. How could I even think about going out?"

With that, she turned off the TV and headed toward the stairs.

Ethan's frown deepened when he noticed her bare feet.

Before she could take another step, he strode forward and swept her into his arms.

"Ethan! Put me down! What are you doing?" Evelyn protested, startled by his sudden movement.

"Taking you upstairs. The floors are freezing—you shouldn’t be walking around barefoot."

In her haste to get away from him, she hadn’t bothered with shoes, giving him the perfect excuse.

As she struggled in his hold, he tightened his grip. "Stop squirming. I don’t want to risk hurting the baby."

The moment he mentioned their child, Evelyn went completely still.

A satisfied smirk tugged at Ethan's lips, pleased to have finally captured her attention.

Without another word, he scooped her into his arms and carried her upstairs, depositing her gently onto the plush bed.

The second Evelyn's back hit the mattress, her eyes narrowed in suspicion.

Ignoring her wary glare, Ethan seized her bare foot.

"Where are your socks? It's freezing!"

"What are you doing?"

She tried to yank her leg away, but his grip only tightened.

"I'm just trying to warm you up," he insisted, his voice softer than she expected. "I swear I'm not being creepy. Can you relax for once?"

Her frown deepened.

Even during the years she had shamelessly pursued him, they had never been this close.

The tension between them was unbearable. Acting on instinct, she snatched a pillow and hurled it at his face.

"Hey," he dodged effortlessly, his tone shifting abruptly. "Didn't you want to go to that orchestra concert? I'll take you."

Her breath caught.

She stared at him, stunned into silence.

Had she heard him right?

"Hold on—what did you just say?"

"I'm taking you to the concert. Maybe we could... try being civil with each other?"

"You're actually letting me leave the house?"

Hidden Desires: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn Carter)

The words hung between them, charged with disbelief. Alexander Whitmore—her husband, her captor, the man who had kept her locked away like a fragile bird in a gilded cage—was offering her freedom. Even if just for one night.

Evelyn studied his face, searching for the catch. His jaw was set, his storm-gray eyes unreadable. The same eyes that had burned with fury when she’d last defied him.

But now?

Now there was something else. Something that made her pulse stutter.

Was it guilt? Regret?

Or worse—hope?

She swallowed hard, fingers curling into the fabric of her dress. "Why?"

Alexander exhaled sharply, running a hand through his dark hair. "Because I’m tired of fighting."

The admission stunned her.

Since the day they’d been forced into this marriage, it had been nothing but battles—silent and explosive, cold and searing. Every word a weapon, every glance a challenge.

And now he wanted a truce?

For a concert?

Her lips parted, but before she could respond, he added quietly, "One night, Evelyn. No guards. No conditions. Just... us."

Just us.

Two words that shouldn’t have meant anything.

But they did.

They always had.

She lifted her chin. "Fine. But if this is some kind of trick—"

"It’s not." His voice was rough, almost pleading. "For once, just... trust me."

Trust.

The most dangerous word of all.

Evelyn hesitated—then nodded.

One night.

One chance.

And maybe, just maybe, one step toward something neither of them dared name.

###Chapter 404 A Bold Attempt

Ethan Caldwell gave a slow nod, his sharp eyes catching the shadows beneath Evelyn Carter's usually vibrant gaze.

It pained him to see her like this—trapped, diminished. The walls of Whitmore Manor seemed to close in on her more each day.

He knew music was her escape. The way her fingers danced across the cello strings spoke of a soul too fierce to be caged.

Ethan understood that passion. He played the piano himself, had performed at prestigious venues.

Their shared love for music created a bond Alexander Whitmore could never rival. A man raised on farmland, with calloused hands that had never touched an instrument.

Ethan smirked. He was the refined one, the cultured one. This concert could be his chance to remind Evelyn of that.

The symphony hall would be filled with elegance, with people who appreciated artistry. He wanted her to see him there, in his element, proving he belonged by her side.

When he finally relented and agreed to let her attend, the tension between them eased. The following days were lighter, almost peaceful.

Evelyn’s mood lifted visibly. She ate better, smiled more. The concert wasn’t just an event to her—it was hope. A glimpse of freedom.

And perhaps, if luck favored her, an opportunity to slip away unnoticed.

As the date drew nearer, Ethan watched her closely.

Too closely.

The night was deep and still when Evelyn Carter drifted into peaceful slumber, a faint smile gracing her lips as if she were dreaming of the liberation that lay ahead.

Outside, the world was cloaked in darkness, but Ethan Caldwell's stormy gaze burned with intensity as he watched her. His fingers traced the curve of her cheek, his voice barely audible. "Evelyn, do you truly wish to escape me so badly?"

Unaware in her dreams, Evelyn imagined herself breaking free, her heart light with the promise of freedom.

Stepping out of the room, Ethan was met by a bodyguard stationed in the living area. "Sir," the man reported, "surveillance has been secured around the concert venue as instructed. Ms. Hart won’t have the chance to meet anyone tomorrow."

A satisfied nod was Ethan’s only response. If he was allowing Evelyn this small taste of freedom, he would ensure she remained within his grasp.

For days now, while pretending to indulge in their time together, he had been orchestrating his plans in the shadows.

His next question was sharp. "What has my uncle been up to?"

Since shaking off Alexander Whitmore with Zachary Black’s assistance, the silence from that front had been unsettling. Ethan had expected Alexander to react immediately upon learning Evelyn was with him—yet his phone had remained eerily quiet.

"Reports indicate he’s currently on a business trip," the bodyguard answered. "He doesn’t appear concerned."

Ethan’s jaw tightened. That wasn’t like Alexander. Something was wrong.

He turned toward the window, the city lights flickering in the distance. If Alexander wasn’t making a move, then he was planning something—something Ethan needed to anticipate before it was too late.

His fingers curled into a fist.

Evelyn might dream of freedom, but he would never let her go. Not now. Not ever.

And if Alexander thought he could take her back, he was sorely mistaken.

Ethan's brow furrowed, an uneasy feeling settling in his gut.

Something wasn't right.

He had a strong suspicion Alexander was up to something. This sudden trip felt less like a genuine business matter and more like a carefully constructed diversion—a smokescreen to throw him off track.

"Monitor his movements closely. If he so much as steps near the opera house tomorrow, I need to know instantly."

The bodyguard gave a sharp nod, understanding the gravity of the command.

As midnight approached, Evelyn pressed herself against the door, holding her breath to catch every whispered word.

She had woken the second Ethan left her room, and the thought of tomorrow's escape plan sent adrenaline coursing through her veins.

An hour later, when the last light in Hawthorne Estate flickered out, she knew it was time.

Her pulse pounded as she slipped into Ethan’s bedroom, every nerve alight with fear and resolve.

Earlier, she had glimpsed him scrolling through emails on his phone—and more importantly, she had memorized Alexander’s number.

She needed to call for help.

Moving with painstaking care, she spotted the phone resting beside Ethan’s pillow, still tethered to its charger.

The air in the room was thick with tension.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she reached for Alexander's phone.

This was her first time doing something like this, and the fear of waking him made her pulse race.

She held her breath, carefully lifting the device from the nightstand.

Just as she pulled the charging cable free, Alexander's eyes flew open in the dark.

The sudden intensity of his gaze pinned her in place.

Her heart hammered against her ribs.

A beat of silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken questions.

Then, his voice, rough with sleep, cut through the stillness.

"What are you doing, Evelyn?"

The question hung in the air like a blade.

She swallowed hard, her mind scrambling for an answer.

But the truth was far more dangerous than any lie she could conjure.

Because if he found out why she needed his phone, everything would unravel.

And she wasn't ready for that.

Not yet.

Not when she was so close to uncovering the truth.

###Chapter 405 Fire the Designer

Their gazes locked, and Evelyn recoiled in surprise.

Ethan gripped her wrist, his expression torn between irritation and affection.

"Evelyn, why must you always defy me?"

She scowled but refused to back down.

Wrenching her hand free, she spun on her heel, determined not to let him witness her unease.

But Ethan wasn’t done. He hauled her back, crushing her against his chest.

"Did you honestly believe you could slip into my room, steal my phone, and vanish without a word?"

She tried to push away, but his arms only tightened.

Living under the same roof had eroded every boundary between them. He was growing far too accustomed to this intimacy, and she knew she needed to escape—fast.

The more time they spent together, the harder it became to ignore the danger of his wandering hands.

With a sharp shove, she broke free. "Open your eyes! The truth is right in front of you—what more is there to say?"

"Do you really think I'd let you go that easily?" His voice carried a playful edge, but beneath it lay something far more serious.

"It's just a device. If you want it returned, all you had to do was ask."

With a careless flick of his wrist, Ethan reached into the nightstand and tossed her the phone.

Evelyn's breath caught as she recognized it instantly, hope flaring bright before doubt could smother it.

But the moment she unlocked the screen, her brief elation shattered.

No SIM card. No Wi-Fi access in this gilded prison.

"Ethan, this isn't funny."

Fury burned through her veins, her fingers tightening around the useless device. What good was a phone without connection? Another one of his twisted games.

The bastard actually laughed, his amusement growing at her visible frustration. He much preferred this fiery version of her to the hollow pleasantries she'd been offering lately.

"Relax and get some sleep. Tomorrow we're attending the symphony. Unless you'd prefer I carry you to your room right now?"

Evelyn recoiled as if scalded, her cheeks flushing with indignation.

Without dignifying him with a response, she spun on her heel and marched out, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the framed portraits in the hallway.

The concert was scheduled for seven, but Ethan arrived with the evening gown at four.

Evelyn studied the dress. The mermaid silhouette clung tightly, making any quick movements impossible.

Attending the concert was merely an excuse. Her real objective was to slip away unnoticed.

To avoid suspicion, she dug through her wardrobe and selected a simpler, more comfortable dress instead.

When she stepped out, Ethan’s expression darkened at the sight of her in anything other than his chosen gown. "You don’t like what I picked for you?"

"It’s fine," she replied, her voice deliberately detached.

A flash of annoyance crossed his face as he snatched up his phone and dialed Nathan. "Terminate the designer."

Evelyn could only stare in disbelief.

"Should we eat before the concert, or would you prefer afterward?" he asked, smoothly changing the subject.

"Any interesting new places?"

"There’s one that just opened. Decent reviews."

"After, then. I could use a proper meal."

Ethan nodded, his expression one of approval as he surveyed the meticulously laid-out plans before him.

Across the table, Evelyn kept her face carefully neutral, though triumph flickered in her chest.

This dinner invitation was exactly what she needed.

Being out in public with Ethan meant surveillance would loosen, if only slightly. It was the perfect opportunity to gather information, to test the boundaries of her invisible cage.

Her fingers curled around her glass of water, the condensation cool against her skin.

One step closer to freedom.

She just had to play her part a little longer.

###Chapter 406 A Moment of Serenity

The crisp morning air embraced Evelyn as they stepped out of Hawthorne Estate, washing away the lingering tension in her shoulders.

She reached for the car window, rolling it down without hesitation. The refreshing breeze caressed her face, and Alexander didn't object.

His gaze lingered on her profile, an unconscious smile playing at the corners of his lips.

It had been ages since he'd seen her so at ease, even if her contentment wasn't directed at him.

The wind toyed with Evelyn's chestnut locks, sending them swirling around her delicate features like autumn leaves.

Alexander's pulse quickened at the sight.

Memories flooded back—their early days when she'd first stolen his breath away without even trying.

She'd been his first true infatuation. Before Evelyn, no one had ever made his heart race with just a glance.

The realization struck him as odd. Ever since that day in the restroom when he'd come to her aid, he'd found himself scanning crowded corridors for her familiar silhouette, drawn to her like a magnet amidst a sea of strangers.

Though his family owned multiple luxury vehicles, he'd often choose to walk behind her after school, ensuring she reached home safely under the guise of coincidence.

Throughout his formative years, her image would invade his thoughts at the most unexpected moments—during board meetings, while studying abroad, even in the middle of important business negotiations.

The scent of her vanilla shampoo still haunted him, though he'd never admit it.

Evelyn turned slightly, catching his stare. For a fleeting second, their eyes locked, and Alexander swore he saw a flicker of something—recognition? Longing?—before she quickly looked away.

The car accelerated, carrying them toward an uncertain future, but in this suspended moment between past and present, Alexander allowed himself this small indulgence—to remember what it felt like to love her without complications.

Ethan couldn't resist.

He leaned in, closing the distance between them until the warmth of Evelyn's presence enveloped him. The faint scent of her shampoo—something floral and delicate—teased his senses.

Just as he was about to brush against her, she turned abruptly.

Their foreheads collided.

The softness of her skin grazed his lips, sending an unexpected jolt through him.

Evelyn blinked, startled, then pressed a hand to her forehead. "Ethan!"

Her voice was sharp, edged with irritation as she shoved against his chest, putting space between them.

He hadn’t planned this.

Yet the ghost of that accidental kiss lingered, and he absently touched his own lips, still warm from the brief contact.

This close, he could see the faint flush on her cheeks, the way her lashes cast delicate shadows under her eyes.

His pulse thrummed.

She was mesmerizing. Even when her gaze burned with defiance, all he wanted was to pull her back in.

It struck him then—when you were drawn to someone, your body betrayed you. Every instinct demanded closeness.

With Evelyn, the pull was undeniable. A hunger he’d never felt with Vanessa.

Not like this.

With Vanessa, she was always the one initiating contact.

Ethan squeezed his eyes shut, attempting to suppress the storm of emotions raging inside him.

But the moment darkness claimed his vision, Evelyn’s face materialized—her lips, her scent, the way her breath hitched when he was near.

The ache for her was visceral, a relentless hunger that refused to be ignored.

Just as the tension in the car became unbearable, the vehicle glided to a perfect stop outside the concert hall.

Evelyn practically flung the door open, fleeing as if Ethan were a predator hot on her heels.

He followed at a measured pace, his tailored suit immaculate, his expression schooled into perfect indifference—as if the charged moment between them had never happened.

Evelyn noticed immediately that they weren’t using the main entrance. No security checks, no crowds—just discreetly stationed bodyguards every few steps.

Ethan had planned this meticulously.

Escape was impossible.

"This is the private entrance," Ethan murmured, his voice smooth. "I reserved the entire hall. No distractions. Just you, me… and the music."

Evelyn’s breath caught.

So this was why he had insisted on bringing her here.

Ethan noticed the subtle shift in her expression immediately. His hand reached out instinctively, fingers brushing against hers.

"Walk with me," he murmured, his voice low and inviting.

The evening air carried the faint scent of blooming roses from the nearby gardens. The golden hues of sunset painted the sky, casting long shadows across the path.

Evelyn hesitated for only a second before slipping her hand into his. The warmth of his touch sent a quiet thrill through her.

They moved in comfortable silence, their steps perfectly in sync. The distant laughter of other couples strolling through the park only emphasized the intimacy between them.

Ethan glanced down at her, his gaze lingering on the way the fading light caught in her hair.

She felt his eyes on her and looked up, meeting his intense stare.

For a heartbeat, neither of them spoke.

Then, without warning, he stopped walking.

Evelyn turned to face him fully, curiosity flickering in her eyes.

Ethan cupped her cheek gently, his thumb tracing the curve of her jaw.

Her breath hitched.

Slowly, he leaned in, closing the distance between them.

The world around them seemed to fade away as their lips met—soft, tentative, then deepening with unspoken emotion.

When they finally pulled apart, Evelyn's cheeks were flushed, her lips slightly parted.

Ethan smiled, a rare, tender expression that made her heart stutter.

"Come on," he said softly, intertwining their fingers again. "Let's keep walking."

And just like that, the moment passed—but the memory of it lingered, sweet and electric, between them.

###Chapter 407 I'll Feed You

Evelyn didn't even glance at Ethan. Instead, she strode past him, heading straight for the concert hall and claiming a front-row seat.

Noticing Evelyn's irritation, Ethan exhaled in amusement before settling beside her.

"For dinner later," Evelyn began, her voice edged with sarcasm, "are you planning to reserve the entire Italian bistro too?"

Ethan blinked in surprise. That had, in fact, been his exact intention.

"Ethan, I'm not some pampered pet you can leash."

Turning sharply, Evelyn met his gaze. "Why don't we skip the concert and cancel dinner altogether? Let's just go back. You can lock me away again. It makes no difference whether I step outside or not—since you've made sure I can't speak to a single soul."

With that, she rose abruptly, feigning departure.

Ethan's fingers closed around her wrist. "Evelyn, the performers are about to start. Don’t you want to hear them?"

A realization struck her—if she wanted to escape Ethan, she’d have to slip back into her old role: the lovesick girl who lived only for him.

She lowered her lashes, then lifted them again, her eyes softening with practiced devotion.

Ethan froze, his eyes widening in disbelief. "A date?"

"Yes, our first one. And you completely ruined it."

Evelyn's voice trembled as she spoke, her tears landing on the back of Ethan's hand.

She had tried so hard to make things work between them, but all he seemed to want was to keep her caged like some prized possession.

"Evelyn, don't say that."

Seeing her tears fall uncontrollably, Ethan's chest tightened with guilt.

He scrambled for tissues, desperate to wipe them away.

But before he could, Evelyn suddenly threw herself into his arms.

Ethan went completely still, his breath catching in his throat.

It had been so long since she had willingly touched him.

All these days, he had bent over backward to cook for her, to do things he wasn't even good at—just to see her smile.

Yet every time, she had only given him a cold, distant "thank you."

But now… now she was clinging to him.

Did this mean his efforts had finally paid off?

Evelyn buried her face against his shoulder, her quiet sobs filled with hurt and frustration.

Ethan's hardened expression softened as he tenderly brushed Evelyn's hair away from her face.

"Evelyn, I never meant to cage you," he murmured. "I won't reserve the entire Italian bistro next time."

Relief washed over Evelyn at his words.

She immediately pulled away from his embrace.

The sudden emptiness in his arms left Ethan feeling hollow.

Luckily, the orchestra began playing just then, filling the silence between them.

Ethan reached for Evelyn's hand. She tensed momentarily but didn't pull away.

His heart soared.

Did this mean she didn't despise his touch?

Less than thirty seconds later, Evelyn withdrew her hand, claiming she needed water.

To her surprise, Ethan lifted the glass to her lips himself.

"Let me," he insisted.

Evelyn froze.

Trapped in this charade, she had no choice but to play along.

Turning her face slightly, cheeks flushed with feigned shyness, she took the glass from him. "I can manage."

Ethan's breath hitched as Evelyn leaned in closer, her delicate features mere inches away.

The way her lips touched the water glass sent his pulse racing. Every graceful movement captivated him anew.

He realized with startling clarity - true love wasn't about finding someone new, but rediscovering the same person endlessly.

While Evelyn remained engrossed in the symphony's crescendo, Ethan couldn't tear his gaze away.

His eyes traced the curve of her cheekbones, the flutter of her lashes, committing each detail to memory.

The concert hall's golden lights caught in her hair like scattered stardust, making his chest tighten.

He'd willingly go blind if it meant this would be the last sight he ever saw.

Between movements, Evelyn turned, catching his intense stare. A blush crept up her neck as she whispered, "What?"

Ethan simply smiled, lifting a strawberry to her lips. "The music's beautiful," he murmured. "But you're the masterpiece."

The orchestra swelled around them as Evelyn accepted the offering, her fingers brushing against his in the dimmed theater.

Somewhere between the third movement and the final note, Ethan realized - he'd happily spend eternity watching her experience the world.

###Chapter 408 Seeking Assistance

Evelyn had sensed Ethan's intense stare for quite some time.

She pretended to be completely engrossed in the symphony, though she could feel his gaze burning into her from the corner of her eye.

Evelyn was certain that if their eyes locked, Ethan wouldn’t hesitate to pull her into a kiss.

The thought sent a shiver down her spine.

Finally, the performance came to an end.

The musicians took their bows on stage. Under Ethan’s watchful presence, Evelyn didn’t dare make a single move.

They returned to the car in silence, heading toward the upscale French bistro he had chosen.

As they passed a bustling shopping district, Evelyn’s attention was caught by a vibrant advertisement for a Japanese izakaya flashing across a massive LED screen.

"I’m not in the mood for French cuisine," she said suddenly. "Let’s try that Japanese place instead."

The car merged into the weekend traffic, the streets packed with lively crowds.

Ethan’s gaze flickered to her stomach. "You’re pregnant, Evelyn. Are you sure you want to be in such a crowded area? What if someone accidentally—"

Evelyn clung to Ethan's arm, her voice dripping with playful sweetness. "I'm craving sushi. Can we?"

Her wide, innocent eyes met his, making resistance impossible for Ethan.

He gave a curt nod, instructing the driver to turn back toward the mall.

The car soon rolled into the underground garage. Just as Evelyn reached for the door handle, Ethan's fingers closed around hers, tight and possessive.

Startled, she bit her lip and tugged her hand free.

"People might see us," she whispered.

Ethan's gaze darkened. "I don't give a damn."

"But I do," Evelyn countered, stepping back. "Right now, I'm your aunt. I won’t let gossip ruin your reputation because of me."

She clasped her hands behind her back, but the intensity in Ethan's stare only burned hotter.

He hadn’t anticipated her concern for him.

Evelyn pretended not to notice, striding ahead toward the nearly empty Japanese restaurant.

Once seated, she glanced toward the restroom. "I’ll be right back," she said, rising smoothly.

Ethan's piercing gaze followed Evelyn but he made no move to stop her.

With a subtle nod to the security detail behind him, one of the broad-shouldered men immediately fell into step behind her.

"Ms. Carter, allow me to escort you," the bodyguard intoned, his voice laced with unspoken warning.

They reached the restroom entrance, but the guard stepped in first—methodically checking each stall, rapping his knuckles against the doors to confirm they were empty before finally permitting her entry.

Evelyn exhaled sharply at the excessive precaution.

"Standard protocol, Ms. Carter," the man said smoothly, positioning himself outside the door. "Can't risk any... unexpected encounters."

She slammed the lock shut behind her, sinking onto the closed toilet seat.

Her pulse hammered against her ribs. This was her first moment alone in days.

Could she really let this chance slip away?

Biting her lip, she mentally mapped the restaurant's layout. If she screamed now, would anyone dare intervene against a Caldwell in Cresthaven?

The weight of his influence pressed down on her. Even if someone heard—

The guard's shadow loomed under the doorframe. No exits. No allies.

Her fingers trembled as they hovered near the emergency call button on her smartwatch. One press would alert Alexander's security team.

But would they reach her before Ethan's men did?

A toilet flushed in the adjacent stall.

Evelyn froze.

She wasn't alone after all.

The moment they stepped into the upscale restaurant, the maître d' rushed forward with a practiced smile.

"Mr. Whitmore, your usual table is ready," he said, bowing slightly.

Evelyn's stomach twisted.

This was Alexander's territory.

Every staff member here knew him by name. The polished marble floors, the crystal chandeliers—even the air smelled like his influence.

How could she possibly find help in this place?

The other diners barely glanced her way, too absorbed in their expensive meals and whispered conversations.

She swallowed hard.

Would any of these strangers dare intervene?

Not when Alexander Whitmore commanded the room with just his presence.

Evelyn clenched her fists under the table.

She needed a miracle.

###Chapter 409 Ethan Became Suspicious

Evelyn pushed open the restroom door and stepped out. As she moved to wash her hands, the bodyguard stationed outside abruptly blocked a young woman attempting to enter.

The girl’s expression twisted in irritation, her lips parting to protest—until Evelyn emerged.

Their shoulders brushed as Evelyn passed, the accidental contact sending the stranger stumbling back a step.

"Watch where you're going!" the girl snapped, her voice sharp with indignation. "Who do you think you are? Does this place belong to you?"

Evelyn steadied her with a firm grip, murmuring an apology. "I didn’t mean to. Are you hurt?"

Her fingers tightened around the girl’s wrist, discreetly pressing a crumpled slip of paper into her palm.

Confusion flickered across the girl’s face at the unexpected object, but Evelyn’s grip prevented her from unfolding it—not here, not with the bodyguard watching.

"Ms. Carter, I’ll handle this," the bodyguard interjected, stepping between them. His tone was smooth, diplomatic. "Miss, we’d be happy to cover your expenses tonight. Will that suffice?"

The girl hesitated, her fingers curling around the hidden note.

Evelyn met her gaze briefly—a silent plea—before the bodyguard guided her away.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut behind her, Evelyn unfolded the crumpled note with shaking fingers.

[I'm being forced. Please call this number—tell him to come to this café immediately. Help me.]

Alexander's number was hastily scrawled in smudged lipstick.

Evelyn had deliberately avoided involving the police. This was a Whitmore family matter, after all. A public scandal would only make things worse—for her, for Ethan, and especially for Alexander.

Her pulse hammered as she dialed the number.

Then, at the last second, she hung up.

Words might fail her. Instead, she typed out a frantic message, detailing everything—the forced dinner, Ethan’s watchful gaze, the bodyguard stationed outside.

Once sent, she flushed the note down the toilet and wiped her phone clean.

Cold water rushed over her trembling hands, washing away the sweat.

Then—her phone buzzed.

She answered without thinking.

But as she stepped out of the bathroom, the bodyguard was still there, arms crossed, eyes sharp.

Her breath caught.

She ended the call before a single word could escape.

The phone call ended abruptly.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she set the device down.

Across the table, the bodyguard's sharp gaze never left her.

She forced herself to remain still, not daring to make any sudden moves.

Alexander's brow furrowed.

The sudden disconnection left him unsettled.

He checked the text message again—no mistake.

Without wasting another second, he grabbed his coat and headed straight for the restaurant.

It had to be Evelyn.

She was in trouble.

His instincts screamed that Ethan was behind this.

That manipulative bastard had gone too far.

The mall was crowded, typical for a weekend.

A full-scale lockdown would cause chaos, so Alexander had no choice but to search for her himself.

Evelyn returned to her seat, her pulse unsteady.

The table was laden with exquisite dishes.

Ethan smiled, the picture of charm as he served her.

"Try this," he urged, placing a delicate slice of seared scallop on her plate.

She picked at her food, chewing slowly.

Her eyes flickered toward the exit.

The girl she had bumped into earlier was leaving.

Had she delivered the message?

Evelyn couldn't be sure.

But she had to stall.

For Alexander.

For herself.

Ethan Caldwell dialed Alexander Whitmore's number, his fingers trembling slightly.

But his attention was abruptly stolen by the sight of Vanessa Hart slipping into a black sedan.

Something about her furtive movements set off alarms in his mind.

Without thinking, he ended the call mid-ring and quickened his pace.

The evening shadows stretched long across the pavement as he followed at a discreet distance.

Vanessa's car turned sharply down an unfamiliar side street, tires screeching against the asphalt.

Ethan cursed under his breath and flagged down a taxi.

"Follow that car," he instructed the driver, his voice tight with urgency.

Through the taxi's window, he watched the sedan weave through traffic with reckless abandon.

His phone buzzed in his pocket - Alexander calling back.

He ignored it.

The chase led them to the industrial district, where warehouses loomed like silent giants in the gathering dusk.

Vanessa's car disappeared behind a chain-link fence.

Ethan tossed cash at the driver and slipped out, moving with practiced stealth.

His polished shoes crunched on gravel as he approached the abandoned building.

A sliver of golden light escaped from beneath a rusted metal door.

Pressed against the cold concrete wall, he heard muffled voices inside.

One voice stood out - deep, commanding, and chillingly familiar.

Ethan's blood ran cold.

He recognized that voice from countless boardroom battles and family dinners.

This changed everything.

Backing away silently, he pulled out his phone with shaking hands.

Alexander needed to know.

Evelyn Carter needed to know.

But first, he needed proof.

Raising his phone camera, he captured the license plates of three black SUVs parked nearby.

The sound of a safety being clicked off froze him in place.

"Looking for someone?" a gruff voice asked from the shadows.

Ethan didn't turn around.

He knew when he was outmaneuvered.

Slowly, he lowered his phone.

The last thing he saw before the world went dark was Vanessa's smirk reflected in a broken window.

Then everything faded to black.

Ethan Caldwell dialed Alexander Whitmore's number, his fingers tapping impatiently against the phone.

But his attention snapped elsewhere when he noticed Evelyn Carter trailing after that mysterious woman.

A flicker of suspicion darkened his expression.

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her fingers tightening around the strap of her bag.

The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension.

The phone trembled in Evelyn's hand as she ended the call with Alexander.

Her breath hitched when she spotted one of Ethan's bodyguards tailing the young woman who had just left.

A cold realization settled in her chest.

Ethan was suspicious.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, masking the flicker of unease in her gaze.

The game had just gotten more dangerous.

###Chapter 410 Run Away

Ethan's voice was firm as he spoke. "You're pregnant. You shouldn't eat too much seafood."

"Alright." Evelyn nodded, keeping her expression neutral. She needed to stall, but she couldn't risk being too obvious. If Ethan noticed, everything would fall apart.

As they stepped out of the restaurant, the bodyguard who had been tailing the girl returned and whispered something into Ethan's ear.

His face darkened instantly.

Disbelief flickered in his eyes as he turned to Evelyn. "You lied to me?"

Evelyn's pulse spiked, but she forced herself to stay composed.

She met his gaze evenly. "What are you talking about?"

Ethan hesitated. The bodyguard had followed the girl and found nothing suspicious—she had acted completely normal. Yet, something still felt off.

He had tested Evelyn deliberately, expecting a reaction. But she remained unshaken.

Had he imagined it all?

Evelyn knew Ethan hadn't discovered anything concrete.

If he had, he would've dragged that girl here to face her already.

She studied Ethan's expression carefully, searching for any signs of suspicion. Finding none, she took two deliberate steps back.

Tears welled up in her eyes, her lower lip trembling with practiced precision. Her shoulders shook with feigned distress.

"Ethan," she whispered, voice breaking, "if you truly wanted a fresh start with me, why can't you trust me even a little?"

Ethan froze, staring at her as if struck. His hesitation lasted just a second too long.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her face, letting a single tear slip free.

"You never divorced Vanessa. You kept me trapped. I endured so much—all because I loved you. And now you accuse me?" Her breath hitched dramatically. "If this is how it is, then we're done!"

Before he could react, she spun on her heel and bolted.

The mall was packed—perfect for losing him in the crowd. Just a few more steps and she'd vanish—

A strong arm yanked her back.

Ethan crushed her against his chest, his grip unyielding. His voice was rough with—
###Chapter 410 Fleeing Shadows and Lingering Regret

"I'm so sorry, Evelyn. I was completely wrong. I never should have questioned you. Please, forgive me."

Lucas Bennett froze in his tracks, his breath catching as he witnessed the unexpected scene unfolding before him. The man and woman stood locked in an embrace, oblivious to the world around them.

His family's boutique occupied the third floor of this very mall. He had just finished his routine inspection upstairs when fate cruelly decided to reveal Evelyn Carter and Ethan Caldwell's secret rendezvous.

Instead of confronting them, Lucas silently raised his smartphone. The camera shutter clicked softly, capturing their intimate moment in high definition.

With trembling fingers, he attached the damning photo to a message for Alexander Whitmore:

[Alex, seems we're both victims of betrayal. Your wife is publicly embracing another man right now.]

Alexander was navigating through heavy traffic when the notification arrived. His phone remained untouched on the passenger seat.

Only when he parked his luxury sedan outside the shopping complex did he see Lucas's message. The moment his eyes landed on the photograph, the temperature in the car seemed to drop twenty degrees.

Alexander's knuckles turned white as they clenched around the steering wheel. His usually composed features twisted into something dark and dangerous.

The screen of his phone illuminated his stormy expression as he stared at the image that could shatter his world.

###Chapter 411 Alexander Is Here

Alexander radiated an icy intensity that could freeze the entire parking garage.

His fingers flew across his phone screen as he dialed Lucas. "Are they still inside? Intercept them now!"

Even through the static connection, Lucas could practically feel the lethal chill in Alexander's voice.

He sighed in resignation. "Too late, man. They're already gone."

Alexander's eyes darkened dangerously, his jaw tightening.

Lucas added, "They left just five minutes ago. Want me to check the garage cameras?"

"Don't bother. I'm already here."

Alexander scanned the dimly lit garage, his mind racing. Chasing them to the restaurant now would be pointless—they had slipped away.

Multiple elevators led in and out of the garage, making it impossible to cut them off.

That left only one option.

He would have to wait at the garage's exit toll booth.

Evelyn had stalled for as long as she could, but Alexander still hadn't appeared.

The clock was ticking.

Disappointment settled in Evelyn's chest. The girl clearly hadn't called Alexander.

For days, she had tried every trick—throwing tantrums, making scenes.

Yet Ethan only seemed more amused, his gaze growing darker with fascination.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. If Alexander wasn’t coming, there was no point in dragging this out.

But she refused to leave empty-handed.

The first floor of the mall buzzed with activity, a musical event in full swing. Instruments gleamed under the bright lights.

An idea sparked.

She strode toward the display, her eyes locking onto the cello.

Without hesitation, she sat and drew the bow across the strings.

The rich, melancholic notes filled the air.

Shoppers paused. Phones lifted, capturing the impromptu performance.

Ethan stiffened, realization dawning too late.

The cello was wired to the mall’s speakers. The music echoed through every corridor.

Alexander, stationed at the exit, froze.

That sound—he knew it anywhere.

Evelyn was here.

The annual meeting at Horizon Enterprises was in full swing.

Alexander stepped out of his sleek black car and strode purposefully into the upscale shopping center.

Only a handful of stores specialized in musical instruments, making his search straightforward.

As the final notes of the piano piece faded, the hall erupted in enthusiastic applause.

Ethan Caldwell's eyes gleamed as he gazed at Evelyn Carter—this song held deep significance for him.

It was this very melody, played by Evelyn years ago, that had pulled him back from the brink of unconsciousness after a devastating car crash.

"Is she playing this now… for me?" Ethan’s pulse quickened at the thought.

Overcome with emotion, he took an eager step forward, ready to sweep her into his arms.

Then, without warning, a figure in a black fedora materialized beside him.

A sharp nudge from the man’s elbow made Ethan turn—and freeze.

Zachary Black.

Pulling his hat lower, Zachary muttered under his breath, "Alexander’s coming. Now."

Ethan’s breath hitched. His expression darkened with shock.

Zachary smirked, his voice dripping with mockery. "He's barely three minutes out. Ethan, why don't you make yourself scarce with your little runaway before he arrives?"

Ethan's pulse spiked.

A sharp glance at his bodyguard sent the man into motion, seizing Evelyn's arm to drag her toward the exit.

Ethan turned to follow, but Zachary stepped into his path, blocking him effortlessly.

"Remember that favor you owe me, Ethan?" Zachary's grin was razor-sharp. "Time to pay up."

Ethan's jaw tightened. "What do you want?"

The air crackled with tension.

Evelyn struggled against the bodyguard's grip, her heels scraping the floor.

Somewhere beyond the building's walls, tires screeched to a halt.

Zachary's laugh was low, dangerous. "Oh, nothing much. Just your silence."

Ethan's phone buzzed—Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

Too late.

The doors burst open.

A shadow filled the doorway, broad-shouldered, furious.

Alexander Whitmore had arrived.

###Chapter 412 The Confrontation

By the time Alexander reached the instrument section, Evelyn had already been escorted out of the mall by security.

All he found was Ethan Caldwell standing there, waiting.

Alexander had no patience left for Ethan’s games. He strode forward and seized Ethan by the collar, slamming him against the nearest display.

"Where is she?" Alexander demanded, his voice low and dangerous.

Ethan feigned confusion, his lips curling into an innocent smile. "Uncle Alexander, I have no idea what you're talking about."

Alexander didn’t hesitate. His fist connected with Ethan’s jaw, snapping his head to the side.

A thin trail of blood trickled from the corner of Ethan’s mouth. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, his eyes glinting with amusement rather than fear.

"Still playing dumb?" Alexander growled. "Do you have a death wish?"

Ethan licked the blood from his lips, his smirk widening. "You think threats scare me?"

Alexander tightened his grip. "Your father was exiled. Do you want the same fate? Or worse?"

Ethan’s laughter was cold. "I’m not my father." His gaze turned sharp, calculating. "And I don’t lose."

The air between them crackled with tension.

Alexander leaned in, his voice a lethal whisper. "Then you’ve just made your last mistake."

Ethan's words confirmed one thing—Evelyn was in his control.

Alexander's lips curled into a cold smirk. "You think stealing her phone and sending me messages will fool me? If you're so confident, let her face me herself."

"Why not?" Ethan met Alexander's piercing gaze without flinching. "Uncle Alexander, tomorrow at 2 PM, Evelyn and I will be waiting for you at the Willowbrook Estate."

He took a deliberate step back, smoothing the wrinkles Alexander had left on his collar.

With a mocking smile, Ethan turned and walked away, leaving Alexander standing there, his eyes burning with intensity.

This was a direct challenge.

Alexander pulled out his phone, his fingers moving swiftly.

"Find the exact location of Ethan's Willowbrook Estate. Clear my schedule for tomorrow."

Evelyn never expected to be forcibly taken from the mall by a group of armed men.

It took her a moment to realize—Alexander must be coming for her. That was why Ethan was acting so desperate.

But the bodyguards surrounded her tightly, leaving no chance for escape.

Evelyn was shoved unceremoniously into the car, her protests muffled by a gloved hand clamped over her mouth.

When Ethan slid in beside her, she wrenched free and struck him across the face with a resounding slap.

The bodyguards, who had barely released her, immediately restrained her again.

Ethan's expression darkened. "Release her."

The moment her arms were free, Evelyn swung again, aiming for his cheek.

"You arrogant bastard!" she seethed, raining blows on his chest. "I'm not some doll you can drag around! You said I wasn't your pet—so what the hell is this?"

Ethan remained silent.

He dodged her next strike effortlessly, knowing full well how deeply he'd wounded her pride.

The urge to pull her into his arms was overwhelming, but her fury was a living thing between them.

"Evelyn," he murmured, voice rough with regret. "I couldn't risk losing you."

The pretense shattered.

She shoved him away with all her strength and turned to stare resolutely out the window for the remainder of the drive.

As the car turned onto the familiar road leading to Whitmore Manor, Evelyn's stomach twisted. Had she really—

###Chapter 413 The Breaking Point

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she reached for the car door handle, desperate to escape.

But Ethan had anticipated this. With a quiet click, the locks engaged, trapping her inside.

Back at Hawthorne Estate, she barricaded herself in the guest bedroom, the heavy oak door slamming shut behind her.

Morning came, but Evelyn refused to emerge.

Ethan left a tray of freshly made breakfast outside her door—scrambled eggs, buttered toast, her favorite blend of coffee. Silence was his only reply.

By noon, unease gnawed at him.

He retrieved the spare key, fingers tightening around the cold metal.

The sight that greeted him shattered his composure.

Evelyn sat curled on the hardwood floor, knees drawn to her chest. Her bare feet were pale against the dark wood, toes curling slightly from the chill.

Her gaze was hollow, fixed on nothing.

"Evelyn." His voice cracked as he crossed the room in three strides.

He reached for her, but she flinched violently.

"Don't touch me!" Her hands flew up, nails scraping his forearms as she shoved against him.

Ethan caught her wrists, heart hammering. "You'll freeze like this. At least put on socks—"

A wild kick connected with his shin. She fought like a cornered animal, breaths coming in ragged bursts.

It was useless. His grip was steel.

But the tears streaking her face? Those undid him completely.

Ethan Caldwell gently placed Evelyn Carter on the bed, then brought over the meal he'd prepared, intending to feed her.

With a swift motion, Evelyn knocked the plate from his hands. It shattered against the hardwood floor, food scattering in every direction.

Her eyes burned with fury as she glared at him. "Ethan, you disgust me."

The words cut deeper than he expected. Just yesterday, Evelyn had been warm toward him—almost affectionate. But after he'd dragged her away from the mall against her will, that warmth had vanished, replaced by icy indifference.

Desperate, he seized her wrist and pressed her palm against his chest. "Evelyn, I messed up. But once you calm down, we can go back to how things were yesterday, can't we?"

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "You actually believed that act?"

His grip tightened. "What?"

"I was pretending," she spat. "I don’t want a fresh start with you. I just wanted you to lower your guard."

His breath hitched. "That's not true."

Evelyn almost pitied him—the way his expression twisted between disbelief and devastation.

Then, without warning, he crushed his lips against hers.

She froze in shock.

Ethan's fingers dug into Evelyn's arms as he shoved her onto the mattress.

The air between them crackled with dangerous energy.

She twisted beneath him, but he pinned her wrists above her head with terrifying ease. His other hand moved to the first button of her blouse.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

In all their years together, Ethan had been controlling, yes—but never like this. Never this raw, this unrestrained.

If he had wanted to take her by force, he could have done it that night by the lake when Vanessa pushed him in.

But this version of Ethan was unfamiliar. Unpredictable.

If he decided not to stop, she wouldn’t stand a chance.

Evelyn went still. She shut her eyes and whispered, "Ethan, you're hurting me."

The words sliced through his rage. His grip slackened slightly at the fragile tremor in her voice.

###Chapter 414 Drawing Blood

Ethan's crimson eyes burned with fury. In his twisted mind, Evelyn rightfully belonged to him.

It was Alexander who had stolen her away.

If not for that bastard, Evelyn would have come crawling back to him by now.

Her pained whimpers made his grip falter.

Tears streaked down her cheeks, and something inside him twisted. Even in his rage, he hadn’t wanted to break her like this.

He released her, dragging in ragged breaths to steady himself.

But the moment his guard dropped, Evelyn’s demeanor shifted.

Her trembling lips curled into something cold.

Weakness was a woman’s sharpest blade.

Her fingers closed around a shard of shattered porcelain from the floor.

Before he could react, the jagged edge pressed against his throat.

The tables turned in a heartbeat.

Ethan froze.

He hadn’t anticipated this—Evelyn, fragile Evelyn, pressing death to his skin with steady hands.

The sharp edge pressed deeper into Ethan's throat.

"Ethan, just let me go. I don't want to hurt you," Evelyn said, her voice icy and unyielding. "Get me a car."

Ethan hadn't anticipated this—Evelyn, armed and dangerous, turning against him.

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Evelyn, you won't do it."

Years of knowing each other had convinced him she wasn’t capable of violence. She was bluffing.

Her gaze remained frigid.

Without a word, she tilted the blade, and a thin line of crimson appeared on his skin.

Blood trickled down, staining the pristine sheets beneath them.

"Overconfidence is a flaw, Ethan."

Her tone hardened. "I said, get me a car."

The cold sting at his neck sent a jolt of disbelief through him.

How could she?

To escape him, she was willing to draw blood.

His jaw clenched, eyes burning with betrayal. "Even if you slit my throat tonight, Evelyn, you're not leaving."

Evelyn never anticipated that Ethan would remain defiant, even now.

Her fingers brushed against the fabric of his coat, slipping into his pocket to retrieve his car keys.

The sudden clatter of his phone hitting the floor made her freeze.

A call came through.

The voice on the other end was unmistakable—rough, edged with malice.

It was him. The man who had dragged her into that derelict building.

Zachary’s tone was chillingly casual. "Ethan, did you lure Alexander to the northern estate yet?"

Ethan’s gaze flickered toward Evelyn before he answered, his voice tight. "Why did you want him there?"

A dark chuckle slithered through the speaker. "I have unfinished business with him. Stay out of it."

Evelyn’s pulse spiked.

Something was wrong.

Was Zachary planning to hurt Alexander?

###Chapter 415 Evelyn's Decision

Ethan's instincts screamed danger. His voice turned icy. "Zachary, didn't I make myself clear? I won't be part of your illegal schemes."

"Illegal? Don't be dramatic. All you're doing is getting him to show up. Even if something happens to him, it's not your fault. Besides, don't you want Evelyn all to yourself?"

Zachary's arrogant laughter echoed through the phone. Through his binoculars, he spotted a car approaching in the distance, and his expression hardened.

"Well, well. You actually pulled it off. Consider your debt settled."

The call ended abruptly, leaving Evelyn pale and trembling.

The truth hit her like a freight train.

Ethan and Zachary had used her as bait to lure Alexander to the Hawthorne Estate, planning to eliminate him when the opportunity arose.

Evelyn felt sick. She never imagined Ethan could sink this low.

"Betraying your own family, Ethan? You're despicable."

Without wasting another second, she grabbed the car keys she'd just wrested from Ethan and bolted for the door.

In a heartbeat, Evelyn spun around and drove the jagged porcelain shard toward him with deadly precision.

The sharp edge sliced through Ethan’s fingers as he instinctively reached to block her. Blood welled instantly.

He recoiled, giving Evelyn the split-second advantage she needed.

She didn’t hesitate.

Darting toward the door, she moved like a shadow—swift, silent, unstoppable.

The car door slammed shut behind her.

Her foot hit the accelerator before she even fully registered what she was doing. The engine roared as the vehicle shot forward, tires screeching against the pavement.

Whitmore Manor’s security team sprang into action at Ethan’s furious shouts.

"Stop her!"

They lunged toward the speeding car, arms outstretched.

Evelyn didn’t slow down.

She gripped the wheel tighter, knuckles white, and aimed straight for them.

At the last possible moment, the guards scattered, diving out of the way as the car barreled past.

Within seconds, she was through the gates.

Ethan didn’t waste time.

Ignoring the blood dripping from his hand, he sprinted to another car and tore after her.

Northon’s elite villas were few.

Finding Alexander wouldn’t be hard.

But catching Evelyn before she reached him?

That was another story.

If Zachary was truly targeting Alexander, Evelyn calculated that the occupancy rate at Whitmore Manor must be dangerously sparse.

After meticulous deliberation, her focus landed on a freshly constructed estate that had only recently been transferred to its new owners.

Following her navigation system, she reached the destination in just under fifteen minutes.

Ethan was right behind her, pulling up mere seconds after she did.

The moment her car stopped, Evelyn bolted toward the gated entrance.

Ethan leaped from his vehicle and chased after her, shouting her name, but Evelyn pretended not to hear.

He sprinted, cutting her off before she could step inside.

Seizing her wrist, Ethan stared at her with desperate, pleading eyes.

"Evelyn, if you walk away now, this is over. Do you understand that?"

If she returned to Alexander’s side, there would be no more restraint.

Knowing Alexander’s ruthlessness, Ethan would never get another chance like this—and he might not survive the consequences of his recklessness.

Evelyn turned to face him, her expression as frigid as winter.

Every word Evelyn spoke struck Ethan like a thunderbolt to the chest.

His breath hitched.

The world around him blurred into nothingness.

Only her voice remained, sharp and clear, cutting through him with surgical precision.

His hands clenched into fists at his sides, nails biting into his palms.

But the physical pain was nothing compared to the agony tearing through his heart.

She wasn’t just speaking.

She was dismantling him.

Piece by piece.

And there was nothing he could do to stop it.

Her gaze held his, unflinching.

No hesitation.

No regret.

Just cold, brutal truth.

His throat tightened.

A suffocating pressure built behind his ribs.

He wanted to scream.

To beg.

To make her take it all back.

But the words wouldn’t come.

Because deep down, he knew.

She meant every single syllable.

And that realization shattered him.

Completely.

Irrevocably.

In that moment, Ethan Caldwell understood what true heartbreak felt like.

Every syllable that fell from Evelyn's lips struck Ethan like a hammer to his chest.

The air between them grew thick with tension, charged with unspoken emotions.

Ethan's hands clenched at his sides, his knuckles turning white.

He could feel his heartbeat thundering in his ears, each pulse a painful reminder of what he stood to lose.

Evelyn's gaze never wavered, her expression resolute yet tinged with sorrow.

The weight of her words settled heavily between them, an invisible chasm widening with every passing second.

Ethan's breath hitched, his throat tightening as if bound by invisible chains.

He wanted to reach out, to pull her back—but the distance between them felt insurmountable.

The silence stretched, suffocating and absolute.

Then, with a quiet finality, Evelyn turned away.

Her retreating footsteps echoed in the hollow space of the room.

Ethan remained frozen, the truth of her choice crashing over him like a tidal wave.

His world splintered in that moment, sharp and irreparable.

And for the first time, he understood what true heartbreak felt like.

Every syllable Evelyn spoke struck Ethan like a dagger to the chest.

Her voice was steady, unwavering, each word sharp enough to pierce through his defenses.

Ethan felt it then—the visceral crack of his heart fracturing.

The air between them grew thick with unspoken regrets.

He had expected anger, tears, even pleading.

But this?

This cold, resolute certainty was far worse.

Ethan’s hands clenched at his sides, his knuckles whitening.

He wanted to argue, to demand she reconsider.

Yet the steel in her gaze told him it was futile.

She had made her choice.

And for the first time, Ethan Caldwell understood what true loss felt like.

It wasn’t just losing her.

It was knowing he had been the one to push her away.

The silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating.

Then, without another word, Evelyn turned and walked away.

Ethan didn’t stop her.

He couldn’t.

Because deep down, he knew she deserved better.

And Alexander Whitmore had already given her what he never could—unconditional love.

The realization settled over him like a shroud.

He was too late.

Far too late.

###Chapter 416 The Fortunate Man

Evelyn's decision was final, leaving Ethan Caldwell without even a sliver of hope.

For reasons he couldn't explain, his thoughts wandered back to their school days.

It was their senior year—both eighteen, standing at the precipice of adulthood during their graduation ceremony.

Their school had a long-standing tradition: a masquerade ball to celebrate commencement.

Back then, Ethan hadn’t been in that fateful car accident. He hadn’t mistaken Vanessa Hart for Evelyn yet.

On the night of graduation, Ethan arrived at the masquerade in a perfectly tailored tuxedo.

Even with her face half-hidden behind an ornate mask, he recognized Evelyn immediately amidst the crowd of girls in shimmering cocktail dresses.

He moved toward her with effortless confidence, extending his hand like a prince from a fairy tale.

When Evelyn placed her fingers in his, accepting his invitation to dance, Ethan felt invincible.

That night, he was certain—he was the most fortunate man in the room.

In his mind, he could already see her walking toward him in white, a vision of grace and beauty, promising forever.

It felt like mere moments had passed since everything unfolded.

Yet Ethan Caldwell couldn't comprehend how someone who had once adored him so fiercely could now feel nothing at all.

A crushing weight settled in his chest. Despite their years together, he still couldn't measure up to Alexander Whitmore, who had entered Evelyn Carter's life only months ago.

Only now did he truly grasp the depth of Evelyn's resistance.

Even after keeping her confined for weeks, spending nearly every waking moment by her side—

He had tried everything. Learned to cook for her. Bent over backward to make her happy.

None of it had mattered.

Evelyn spotted Alexander’s sleek black car parked outside Hawthorne Estate.

He had to still be nearby.

Done wasting time with Ethan, she pulled away and strode deeper into the neighborhood without a backward glance.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, his vision blurring with raw anguish.

His first instinct was to follow—

But then a shadow darted from the side, startling him.

Zachary Black.

Ethan barely had time to react before the man was in his face, eyes gleaming with something dangerous.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Ethan’s pulse spiked.

This wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.

Zachary Black's face was a canvas of fresh bruises—undeniable evidence of Alexander Whitmore's brutal efficiency.

Ethan Caldwell had only heard stories about Alexander's decade-plus training at the police academy and his unmatched reflexes, but witnessing the aftermath firsthand was something else entirely.

Clearly, Zachary's attempt to ambush Alexander had spectacularly backfired, leaving him battered and barely standing, freshly discarded like trash from Alexander's grip.

Zachary's face was a grotesque mosaic of swelling and cuts, blood seeping from his split lip.

He coughed violently, spitting out a mouthful of crimson. "Mr. Caldwell, that woman who just ran past you—that's Alexander's wife, isn't it?"

Ethan's expression darkened as he demanded coldly, "What are you scheming?"

"I was thinking of using her to get to Alexander," Zachary replied, his tongue probing the inside of his swollen cheek.

A vicious smirk twisted his lips. "You probably don’t know about the blood debt between your uncle and me. I’m here to collect."

It was obvious Zachary stood no chance against Alexander in a direct fight. A head-on clash would only end in his defeat, so he had shifted his focus to Evelyn Carter instead.

Ethan’s refusal was immediate, his voice steel. "As long as I’m here, you won’t lay a finger on her."

Zachary Black let out a low, mocking chuckle. His dark eyes glittered with cruel amusement as he leaned against the cracked brick wall.

"Well, well," he drawled, dragging out each word like a knife across skin. "The mighty Alexander Whitmore has a weakness after all."

The scent of damp concrete and stale cigarettes hung heavy in the abandoned warehouse. Somewhere in the distance, a pipe dripped steadily like a ticking clock.

"But isn't your precious Evelyn already married to you?" Zachary's smirk widened, revealing slightly crooked teeth. "I heard every pathetic word between you two. That woman's heart isn't yours to claim."

He pushed off the wall, his boots scraping against the concrete floor. The single bare bulb overhead cast jagged shadows across his sharp features.

"Tell me, Whitmore," Zachary's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Is some used-up wife really worth risking everything for?"

A muscle twitched in Alexander's jaw. The ropes binding his wrists bit deeper into flesh as he strained against them.

Outside, thunder rumbled in the distance. The storm was coming.

Zachary's laughter echoed through the empty space, bouncing off rusted metal beams. "Look at you. Kingsdom's golden boy, trussed up like Christmas dinner."

He pulled a switchblade from his pocket. The click of it opening was obscenely loud in the tense silence.

"Let's see how much your beloved Evelyn is really worth to you, shall we?"

The first drop of rain hit the corrugated metal roof with a sound like gunshot.

Somewhere in the city, Evelyn Carter froze mid-step, her chest suddenly tight with inexplicable dread.

###Chapter 417 Emergency Call

Zachary Black had been silently tracking the couple from the moment they stepped into view.

The way Ethan Caldwell transformed from arrogant bully to obedient puppy around Evelyn Carter fascinated him.

Ethan didn't even bother with formalities. "This doesn't concern you. Last I checked, Uncle Alexander is turning the estate upside down looking for you. You might want to disappear before he finds you."

Without waiting for a response, Ethan hurried after Evelyn, leaving Zachary standing alone.

A dangerous smirk curled Zachary's lips as he watched them go.

Years ago, Ethan had personally led the raid that destroyed Zachary's family - executing his parents to complete a government-sanctioned mission.

That blood debt would be repaid in full.

The Hawthorne Estate sprawled across acres of land, but locating Evelyn wouldn't be difficult.

Zachary circled the stone garden twice before melting into the shadows near the main villa.

Evelyn had searched most of the property without finding Alexander, and her anxiety grew with each passing minute. Something felt terribly wrong.

The rocky path twisted unexpectedly when a shadow lunged at her from behind the jagged stones.

Her heart stopped as she recognized Zachary Black's menacing face.

Memories of her previous abduction flooded back, triggering an involuntary scream that tore from her throat.

Zachary's calloused palm clamped over Evelyn Carter's mouth, but she reacted with feral desperation.

Without hesitation, she sank her teeth into his flesh until she tasted copper, twisting her body to deliver a brutal knee strike.

He anticipated her move.

Rage contorted his features as cold steel flashed in the sunlight - a switchblade materializing from his waistband with deadly intent.

The blade arced toward her abdomen with terrifying speed.

Evelyn's breath hitched. No escape. No time.

Then - impact.

But not against her skin.

Alexander Whitmore's muscular frame collided with hers, spinning them both as he took the full brunt of the attack.

A wet, crunching sound.

The knife buried itself to the hilt in Alexander's chest.

Crimson bloomed across his crisp white shirt like some grotesque flower. His face twisted in silent agony as-

Just before collapsing, Ethan delivered a brutal kick straight to Zachary's chest.

Taken completely by surprise, Zachary was sent flying backward. His head struck the artificial rock formation behind him with a sickening crack. He crumpled to the ground, knocked out cold.

Satisfied that Zachary could no longer pose a threat to Evelyn, Ethan finally allowed himself to exhale before his legs gave way beneath him.

The entire confrontation had unfolded in mere seconds, leaving Evelyn rooted to the spot, her mind struggling to catch up with the horror before her.

She knew with absolute certainty—had Ethan not thrown himself in front of her, that knife would have buried itself deep in her abdomen.

With her unborn child at risk, the thought alone made her stomach twist in dread.

A sharp gasp escaped Evelyn’s lips as her gaze landed on Ethan, now sprawled on the ground, the blade still embedded in his chest.

His face was drained of color, contorted in silent agony.

She dropped to her knees beside him, hands trembling as she reached for him. "Ethan! Look at me—are you okay?"

His body convulsed, muscles locking as he curled inward, fighting against the pain.

Ethan clenched his jaw, forcing himself to stay conscious for her sake. His voice was strained, barely audible.

"I’ll live… What about you? The baby—are you both—?"

His words cut off as a shudder wracked his body.

Evelyn’s pulse roared in her ears. She fumbled for her phone, fingers slick with cold sweat.

"Hold on, just hold on—I’m calling an ambulance!"

Her vision blurred as she dialed, her breath coming in short, panicked bursts.

The knife glinted under the harsh sunlight, a grotesque reminder of how close death had come.

Ethan’s hand twitched toward hers, his fingers brushing her wrist weakly.

"Evelyn…" His voice was a ragged whisper. "Promise me… you’re safe."

Her throat tightened.

The sirens wailed in the distance, but time had never moved slower.

Evelyn's head shook violently.

The blade remained lodged deep in Ethan's chest. There was no way he could survive this!

Blood pooled around them in a crimson tide, staining everything in its path. The metallic scent filled the air, making her stomach churn.

With steady hands despite the panic clawing at her throat, Evelyn fished Ethan's phone from his jacket pocket. "Stay with me," she whispered, fingers trembling as she dialed 911. "Help is coming."

Across the room, Alexander burst through the doorway, taking in the horrific scene with widening eyes.

His jaw clenched when he saw Evelyn clutching Ethan's limp form against her chest, her designer dress soaked scarlet.

###Chapter 418 Will You Shed a Tear for Me

Evelyn had no idea Alexander was watching her from the shadows.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she reached into Ethan’s pocket, retrieving his phone. With surprising steadiness, she dialed 911.

After relaying their location to the dispatcher, she answered a rapid-fire series of questions about Ethan’s condition.

"Keep him conscious," the dispatcher urged. "Talk to him. Help is on the way."

"Understood," Evelyn replied, her voice tight.

For fifteen excruciating minutes, she cradled Ethan in her arms, careful not to shift him. The dispatcher’s warning echoed in her mind—don’t move him. The knife buried in his chest was a death sentence if disturbed.

As she stared down at Ethan’s ashen face, her thoughts flickered to Alexander.

Years ago, Alexander had lain in a similar state, his chest torn open. Back then, she’d had acupuncture needles—tools to slow the bleeding, to buy him time.

Now, with nothing but her bare hands, she was powerless.

The wail of sirens cut through the night.

Evelyn exhaled shakily, her grip tightening around Ethan.

Hold on.

But the blood soaking through his shirt told a different story.

Ethan Caldwell clutched his chest, his fingers trembling against the fabric of his shirt. The pain was unbearable, and he wasn’t sure how much longer he could endure it.

His eyelids grew heavy, threatening to close, but Evelyn Carter tapped his cheek lightly. "Stay awake," she urged, her voice firm yet laced with concern. "The ambulance is almost here. Just hold on a little longer, Ethan."

A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips.

"Evelyn," he rasped, his voice barely above a whisper. "I thought you despised me. Figured you'd be celebrating if I..." His words trailed off, the effort too much.

This tenderness from Evelyn was something he had never expected.

"I hated that you kept me trapped," she admitted, her fingers tightening around his. "But I never wished for this."

Her emotions were a storm inside her—anger, confusion, guilt.

No matter how complicated their past was, one undeniable truth remained: Ethan had thrown himself in front of Zachary Black’s blade to save her. If he hadn’t, she would be the one bleeding out on the cold pavement.

She couldn’t abandon him now.

"Breathe," Evelyn instructed, noticing the shallow, uneven rise and fall of his chest. "Slow and deep. Don’t gasp like that."

"Evelyn," Ethan choked out, his voice raw with pain. "If I die saving you... will you cry for me?"

Tears slipped from the corners of his eyes as his Adam’s apple bobbed weakly.

The pain was excruciating.

Ethan Caldwell's lips had lost all color, his breathing shallow. Every word he forced out felt like it drained another fragment of his fading strength.

But he couldn’t let this moment slip away.

Not when Evelyn Carter was finally here, listening.

There were things he needed to say—things he had to say.

Because if he didn’t say them now, he might never get another chance.

Evelyn stiffened at his question. Her brows knitted together in confusion. "Why would you even ask something like that?"

His fingers trembled as he reached for her. "It matters. Just answer me, Evelyn. Please."

She hesitated, then exhaled. "Maybe. But if I did, it would only be—"

His fingertip pressed lightly against her lips, silencing the word "guilt" before it could escape.

"Just say you would. That’s enough for me." A faint, bittersweet smile touched his mouth. "The reason doesn’t matter."

Evelyn didn’t respond.

She could see it—the way he was clinging to illusions, weaving his own fragile fantasy where her tears meant something more than regret.

But she didn’t have time for his delusions.

Her grip tightened around his phone as she dialed a number, her focus razor-sharp.

Alexander Whitmore.

She had to find him.

Ethan watched her, his expression unreadable.

He didn’t try to stop her.

The sudden ringing of a phone shattered the silence.

Evelyn spun around instinctively.

Her breath caught in her throat.

Alexander stood mere feet away, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

She hadn't realized he'd been following her this whole time.

The weight of his presence pressed against her chest like a physical force.

His phone continued buzzing insistently in his hand, the screen illuminating his sharp features.

Evelyn's fingers trembled at her sides.

How much had he heard?

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Alexander took a deliberate step forward.

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed.

The distance between them seemed to shrink and expand simultaneously.

His lips parted as if to speak—

Then the phone rang again.

Louder this time.

More insistent.

A stark reminder of the world outside this charged moment.

Evelyn watched his jaw tighten.

The way his fingers flexed around the device.

The battle between answering and continuing their silent standoff played across his face.

She held her breath.

Waiting.

Always waiting.

The space between them hummed with years of unsaid words.

Of buried emotions.

Of secrets too heavy to name.

Then—

Alexander lifted the phone to his ear without breaking eye contact.

"Whitmore."

That single word, spoken in that familiar commanding tone, shattered the spell.

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

The moment was gone.

But the electricity remained.

Crackling.

Dangerous.

And entirely undeniable.

###Chapter 419 She Had Missed Him

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

Her pulse quickened at the sight of Alexander standing across the street.

Without thinking, she took a step forward—only to freeze when she felt Ethan's weight against her shoulder.

Two weeks.

It had been two endless weeks since she'd last seen him, and now he stood there, his sharp features more defined, his presence more imposing than ever.

Alexander moved with purposeful strides, his stormy gaze locked onto them.

Every word of their conversation had reached him.

When their eyes met, Evelyn immediately recognized the dangerous glint in his.

Ice.

That was all she felt radiating from him—a bone-chilling coldness that made her fingers tremble.

Realization struck.

He had misunderstood.

"Alexander, wait—" she blurted, tightening her grip on Ethan's arm. "He's injured. That's the only reason I'm supporting him. The ambulance is coming."

Alexander stopped inches from her, his towering frame casting a shadow over them. His voice was razor-sharp.

"Is that really all you have to say to me?"

Evelyn's teeth sank into her lower lip.

I never intended to disappear for two whole weeks. I...I couldn't get through to you.

Alexander's fingers brushed gently beneath Evelyn's chin, lifting her face until their eyes met.

His lips curved into a smile that didn't reach his stormy gaze. "So you're saying Ethan abducted you and kept you prisoner?"

Evelyn nearly nodded, but one glance at Ethan's battered form made her hesitate.

She knew without doubt that if she confirmed Alexander's suspicions, he'd send Ethan flying across the room in his fury.

She'd never seen such darkness in Alexander's eyes before.

And Ethan was in no condition to survive Alexander's wrath.

After a tense pause, Evelyn whispered, "Alexander, please...don't hurt Ethan. I'll explain everything later, I promise."

Seeing her concern for him, Ethan managed a weak, triumphant smile.

"Evelyn...I knew you still cared..."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.

Evelyn's stomach clenched.

"Ethan, for God's sake shut up!" she hissed, shooting daggers at the injured man leaning against her. He was determined to make this disaster worse.

The air grew thick with tension as Alexander's jaw tightened. His knuckles turned white where they clenched at his sides.

Evelyn could practically feel the anger radiating off him in waves.

She'd missed him desperately these past weeks - his warmth, his laughter, the way his eyes crinkled when he smiled.

But this?

This terrifying intensity?

This she hadn't missed at all.

Ethan coughed weakly, breaking the silence. A trickle of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth.

Alexander's gaze flickered to the blood, then back to Evelyn's face. His voice came out dangerously calm.

"Tell me one good reason I shouldn't finish what someone else started."

Evelyn's heart pounded against her ribs. She tightened her grip on Ethan's shoulder protectively.

The wrong word now could spark an explosion.

She swallowed hard, searching Alexander's face for any trace of the man she loved beneath the mask of fury.

"Because I'm asking you," she said softly. "Because after everything, I need you to trust me just this once."

A muscle twitched in Alexander's cheek.

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken words and half-truths.

Somewhere outside, a car alarm wailed into the night.

Evelyn held her breath.

The next move was his.

Evelyn’s sharp glare made Ethan pout, his expression wounded. But beneath that façade, satisfaction curled in his chest.

The air turned icy. Just then, the wail of sirens cut through the tension—an ambulance and police car arriving simultaneously.

Paramedics lifted Ethan onto a stretcher while officers hauled away the unconscious Zachary.

Alexander turned on his heel, his posture rigid. Instinctively, Evelyn moved to follow.

Her legs, numb from crouching too long, betrayed her. A startled gasp escaped her lips as she stumbled.

Alexander, already ten paces ahead, whirled around with lightning reflexes. His arms—strong as steel—locked around her, steadying her before she could hit the ground.

Fingers clutching his shirt, Evelyn pressed against his chest.

"Alexander," she whispered, tilting her face up. Her eyes shimmered, bright and wounded like a rabbit’s. "Do you have any idea how much I’ve missed you these past three weeks?"

Her gaze held nothing but him. "How can you be so cold? Didn’t you miss me at all? I called you so many times that day—not one answer. I was lost. I even booked a flight that night to chase you to Cresthaven." Her voice cracked. "Then Ethan took me."

Three revelations.

Three fractures in the silence between them.

First, Evelyn had finally responded to Alexander's email.

Her fingers trembled as she typed out the truth—that her sudden disappearance hadn't been by choice. Ethan Caldwell had taken her.

The words stared back at her from the screen, raw and accusing.

Second, the sting of Alexander's distrust cut deeper than she expected.

She had thought their bond was unbreakable. But his suspicion, his hesitation to believe in her... that hurt more than any physical wound.

The memory of his cold tone during their last call made her chest tighten.

And third—

Evelyn pressed a hand to her mouth.

She had missed him.

Not just his presence, but the way his laughter filled a room. The warmth of his hand in hers. The unspoken understanding between them.

Three simple truths.

One complicated mess.

The notification pinged—Alexander had read her email.

Now she waited.

The cursor blinked.

Her heart raced.

Would he answer?

Would he forgive?

Or had she lost him for good?

The weight of unspoken words pressed heavily between them.

First, Evelyn confirmed Alexander’s earlier suspicions—her sudden disappearance hadn’t been by choice. Ethan Caldwell had taken her. The admission left a bitter taste in her mouth, but the truth needed to be laid bare.

Second, the memory of Alexander’s cold detachment still stung. The way he had turned away from her, the distance in his eyes—it had carved wounds deeper than she cared to admit.

And third…

Her breath hitched.

She had missed him.

More than she could articulate. More than pride would allow her to say.

The silence stretched, thick with unspoken longing and unresolved tension.

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After Prison (Evelyn)

###Chapter 420 The Escape Plan

Cradled in his embrace, Evelyn pressed herself against Alexander's chest, her playful gaze striking directly at his vulnerability.

Alexander suddenly understood—he was utterly powerless against Evelyn's charms.

Her voice was soft as she continued, "You have no idea how many schemes I had to devise just to break free from Ethan."

As she spoke, Evelyn stretched out her hand toward Alexander.

A fresh cut marred her palm, evidence of her desperate struggle.

Alexander's eyes darkened at the sight, a storm of fury brewing in their depths.

He seized her hand, his grip tightening protectively. "How did this happen? Did Ethan hurt you?"

Evelyn bit her lower lip, shaking her head. "No. I did it to escape. I slashed him with a broken piece of porcelain."

It had been a reckless gamble—hurting the enemy by hurting herself. She had wounded Ethan, but not without paying the price.

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I overheard Zachary calling Ethan, saying they'd set a trap for you. I was terrified something might happen, so I had to act fast—I attacked Ethan and stole his car keys."

Lifting her gaze, Evelyn met Alexander's eyes, her own filled with unspoken fear and determination.

She understood exactly why Alexander was furious.

This wasn't just about possessiveness.

The more enraged he became, the clearer it was—he cared deeply for her. Evelyn refused to let this incident drive a wedge between them.

Her words managed to ease some of the storm brewing in Alexander's heart.

Yet his expression remained unyielding.

"How can you be certain Ethan's little performance wasn't staged?" His voice was sharp. "A calculated move to manipulate your emotions? You embraced him—defended him—even told me not to lay a finger on him! You're shielding him!"

Evelyn hesitated before responding. "If Ethan hadn't stepped in front of that blade, it would've been me bleeding out. Given that, I can't let you retaliate against him."

The attack had been too sudden, too precise. Zachary's strike had been ruthless, leaving no room for hesitation.

In her mind, there was no way Ethan could have conspired with Zachary.

She had seen the dagger sink into Ethan's chest, mere inches from his heart. One wrong move, and he could've died right then.

Evelyn refused to believe he would gamble his life just to win her sympathy.

She had known Ethan since childhood. She understood him—or at least, she thought she did.

Though easily influenced by others' manipulations, his heart wasn't truly wicked.

Evelyn was more convinced that Zachary had been the one pulling Ethan's strings.

Otherwise, why would Ethan have turned on Zachary so swiftly, delivering that brutal kick that sent him crashing into the fake mountain, knocking him unconscious right after Zachary had tried to hurt her?

Ethan had played a crucial role in ensuring Zachary's capture.

Hearing Evelyn's unshakable faith in Ethan left a bitter taste in Alexander's mouth.

His expression darkened instantly.

No man wanted his wife to have such a long-standing childhood friend—especially one who still held her trust so completely, even in moments of crisis.

Evelyn sighed.

She recognized that look on Alexander's face—he was jumping to conclusions again.

She met his gaze, her eyes a mix of exasperation and patience.

"Alexander, Ethan and I are in the past. There's nothing left between us. This whole kidnapping was just a twisted coincidence."

Evelyn meant every single word with complete sincerity.

To her, Ethan Caldwell was nothing more than a closed ###Chapter in her life. Yet he refused to move on, and Alexander kept letting jealousy cloud his judgment. It was an exhausting cycle with no end in sight.

There was nothing she could do about Ethan’s lingering presence, so she focused all her energy on Alexander instead.

Evelyn knew she and Ethan could never rekindle what was lost. She wasn’t the type to second-guess her decisions.

In her world, missed opportunities stayed missed.

She always kept her eyes forward, never wasting time on people or things that belonged in the past.

Leaning into Alexander’s embrace, she silently willed him to understand her heart.

"Once he recovers, you can deal with him however you see fit. I won’t interfere. This isn’t about protecting him—it’s about responsibility. Ethan lost too much blood, and he got hurt because of me. I can’t just walk away from that. You understand, don’t you?"

Secret Longing: A Love Reborn After Shadows (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 421 My Wife

Alexander's stern expression softened slightly.

His fingers traced the shallow cut on Evelyn's palm where the porcelain had nicked her skin. "Does it still hurt?"

Evelyn shook her head quickly. "It stopped stinging ages ago. I was too busy worrying about you. I drove here at nearly 200 mph, terrified I wouldn’t make it in time before Zachary got to you."

A low chuckle escaped Alexander’s lips. "Zachary’s still a rookie if he thinks he can outmaneuver me."

Back in his military training days, he’d topped every combat simulation. His reflexes were razor-sharp, and in close-quarters combat? He’d never lost a single match.

Without another word, Alexander swept Evelyn into his arms and carried her to the car, speeding straight to the nearest hospital.

The moment they arrived, he shocked everyone by lifting her from the passenger seat himself.

All eyes in the emergency room snapped to them as Alexander strode through the doors, Evelyn cradled against his chest.

Her cheeks burned with embarrassment.

It was just a minor cut, for heaven’s sake. Yet Alexander refused to let her so much as graze the floor with her shoes.

The moment Alexander stepped into the clinic, Dr. Victoria Sinclair's face brightened with recognition.

But her smile faltered when she noticed the woman cradled in his arms.

"Alexander," she said, pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose, her tone professional yet tinged with curiosity. "Is this... your wife?" The doctor's sleek ponytail and crisp white coat gave her an air of quiet authority. "You never mentioned her before."

Alexander's grip on Evelyn tightened slightly. "Yes. This is Evelyn Carter, my wife." His voice carried an edge of urgency. "She injured her hand. Please examine it immediately."

Victoria nodded, snapping on a pair of gloves before approaching. She took Evelyn's hand gently, inspecting the wound with practiced precision. "This looks like it was caused by something sharp. A knife, perhaps?"

Evelyn's gaze flickered to the doctor's name tag.

[Dr. Victoria Sinclair, Chief of Surgery.]

"A piece of broken porcelain," Evelyn murmured.

Victoria offered a reassuring smile. "It's superficial. I'll prescribe an ointment—apply it twice daily, and it should heal without issue." She turned back to her computer, fingers flying over the keyboard as she typed up the prescription.

Then, with a light laugh, she glanced at Alexander. "But really, for something this minor, you carried her in here like it was an emergency. Did she twist her ankle too?"

Alexander's jaw tightened.

Evelyn felt the tension radiating from him.

Victoria's smile didn't waver, but something unspoken passed between them—a history Evelyn wasn't privy to.

The air in the room grew heavier.

Evelyn shifted, suddenly aware of how close Alexander held her, his heartbeat steady against her side.

Victoria finished typing and handed the prescription to Alexander. "There. All set."

He took it without a word.

Then, as if remembering himself, he exhaled. "Thank you, Victoria."

The doctor's smile softened, just slightly. "Anytime."

Evelyn watched the exchange, a quiet unease settling in her chest.

Something told her this wasn’t just about a cut on her hand.

His fingers tightened around the phone. Alexander flashed an apologetic glance at Victoria before stepping out of the exam room to answer the call.

Evelyn tilted her head. "It's just a scratch, really."

Victoria's gaze lingered on Evelyn's face, sharp and assessing. "Back at the academy, Alexander wouldn't have blinked at something this minor. Women these days are so... fragile. If you wait any longer, it might heal before you even get treated."

Evelyn stiffened. Is she mocking me?

Does she think I'm exaggerating?

And from the sound of it, she's known Alexander for years.

Meeting Victoria's stare head-on, Evelyn smiled sweetly. "What can I say, Dr. Sinclair? My husband can't bear to see me in pain. Even the smallest mark makes him panic. He insisted on dragging me here. Maybe you could tell him to stop fussing over me?"

Victoria's lips parted slightly, clearly caught off guard by the gentle-looking woman's sharp retort.

A slow smirk curled her lips. "My, Ms. Carter. You've got quite the bite."

Evelyn nodded, unfazed. "Alexander and I are married. We balance each other out."

Just then, the door swung open—Alexander returned, slipping his phone into his pocket.

"What exactly do you mean by complementary?"

"Darling, it's obvious," Evelyn purred, her lips curling into a teasing smirk. She threaded her fingers through Alexander's arm, resting her cheek against his broad shoulder. "We're two halves of a perfect whole, aren't we, my love?"

Her emerald eyes glittered with playful curiosity as she turned toward the unfamiliar woman. "Sweetheart, you've been terribly rude not introducing us. Who is this Dr. Sinclair?"

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension as Evelyn's manicured nails absently traced patterns on Alexander's sleeve. She could feel the subtle stiffening of his muscles beneath her touch, a telltale sign she'd learned to read over years of marriage.

Across from them, Victoria Sinclair adjusted her designer glasses with practiced elegance. The diamond pendant at her throat caught the afternoon light, scattering prismatic dots across the clinic's sterile walls.

Alexander cleared his throat, his usual commanding presence momentarily unsettled. "Dr. Sinclair is the new head of neurosurgery at Cresthaven General," he explained, his baritone voice carefully neutral.

Evelyn's smile didn't waver, though her grip tightened imperceptibly. "How fascinating," she murmured, tilting her head like a curious feline. "And how exactly do you two know each other?"

The loaded question hung in the antiseptic-scented air as three heartbeats synchronized in the tense silence. Somewhere down the hall, a monitor beeped relentlessly, counting seconds like a bomb waiting to detonate.

###Chapter 422 Jealous

Alexander's gaze lingered on Evelyn's face. "During my time at the military academy, she was practically the unofficial medic."

With rigorous training and frequent field exercises, injuries were inevitable. That was how Alexander and Victoria Sinclair had crossed paths.

Their connection wasn’t deep, but they shared history—enough to be considered old acquaintances.

Evelyn caught on immediately.

Alexander had just returned from active duty, and Victoria had hurriedly established herself as a doctor in Cresthaven. Evelyn’s instincts had been right all along.

Victoria had come here for Alexander.

The realization hit Evelyn like a wave.

"Oh, so you were just colleagues!" Evelyn feigned innocence. "Dr. Sinclair is stunning. I thought maybe you had feelings for her back then."

Alexander tapped Evelyn’s nose teasingly. "Don’t make assumptions. Nothing like that ever happened."

"I can’t help it," Evelyn pouted. "Dr. Sinclair is brilliant, beautiful—everything a man could want."

Her wide, guileless eyes made Alexander chuckle.

But beneath the playful banter, Evelyn’s pulse quickened.

She wasn’t just joking.

The thought of Victoria Sinclair being anywhere near Alexander unsettled her more than she cared to admit.

The words trapped Victoria Sinclair perfectly, leaving her no room to maneuver.

Yet she couldn't even show her frustration—Evelyn Carter's remarks sounded like nothing but compliments, giving her no valid reason to retaliate.

If she reacted poorly, it would only confirm she had ulterior motives.

"Exactly," Victoria quickly agreed, following Alexander Whitmore's lead. "Mr. Whitmore and I are merely professional acquaintances. Ms. Carter, you shouldn't assume otherwise!"

"Oh." Evelyn nodded, her smile sweet but sharp as she corrected, "Then next time, you should address me as Mrs. Whitmore. After all, I am Alexander's wife."

Victoria was rendered speechless.

Was Evelyn marking her territory?

Hidden in the folds of her coat, Victoria's fingers curled into tight fists.

Once the prescription was handed over, Alexander and Evelyn left the examination room together.

Alexander studied Evelyn with a knowing glint in his eyes. "Mrs. Whitmore… are you, by any chance, jealous?"

He hadn’t missed the subtle tension between Evelyn and Victoria earlier.

He knew Evelyn well enough to recognize when she was staking her claim.

Evelyn sighed. Some people just loved to create drama out of thin air.

Alexander’s expression darkened. "Ms. Carter, I’m simply preventing your little flirtation from escalating."

Evelyn nodded. "Mr. Whitmore, I’m just trying to cut off your little romance before it blooms."

Alexander was stunned, immediately defending himself. "Aren’t you overreacting? Victoria and I are barely acquaintances. There’s nothing between us."

Before Evelyn could reply, their conversation was abruptly cut short.

A woman stormed toward them, her face twisted with fury.

It was Eleanor.

Without warning, she lunged at Evelyn, her hand raised to strike.

Alexander’s eyes widened in alarm as he swiftly pulled Evelyn behind him, shielding her with his body.

His voice was sharp, laced with anger. "Eleanor, what the hell do you think you’re doing?"

"My son is fighting for his life in surgery, and it’s all because of her!" Eleanor spat, her eyes blazing with hatred. "What do you think I’m doing? I’m making sure she pays for what she did to Ethan!"

Eleanor’s chest heaved with barely contained rage as she glared at Evelyn over Alexander’s shoulder.

"You damn troublemaker! If anything happens to my son, I swear I’ll destroy you!"

The news hit Evelyn like a lightning strike.

On her way to the hospital, she discovered that Ethan had been stabbed by a street thug.

The blade had sunk deep into his chest, and the mere thought of it made Evelyn's knees buckle.

As a mother, the sight of her son bleeding and unconscious was unbearable.

While the surgeons worked tirelessly to save Ethan's life, Evelyn paced the sterile hallway, her mind racing.

Then it clicked—Vanessa was behind this.

Her blood boiled.

Needing air, she stormed into the lobby—only to collide with Vanessa herself.

Evelyn lunged without hesitation.

"First, you nearly got him killed in that car crash years ago, and now this?" she seethed. "Vanessa, you’re a curse upon my son!"

###Chapter 423 Selfish

Evelyn's entire body trembled with barely contained rage, her emerald eyes flashing like wildfire as she launched herself at Vanessa, fists flying with reckless abandon.

Alexander moved with lightning reflexes, positioning his broad frame between the two women, effortlessly blocking Evelyn's assault with his towering height.

"Evelyn, control yourself! This is a hospital, for Christ's sake!" Alexander's voice cut through the chaos like a whip, sharp and commanding.

"To hell with your hospital! My son nearly died today, and you're worried about propriety?" Evelyn spat back, her chest heaving with each ragged breath.

The hallway had become a spectacle, nurses and patients alike pausing to gawk at the unfolding drama, whispers spreading like wildfire.

Vanessa stepped out from Alexander's protective shadow, her icy gaze locking onto Evelyn.

"You keep screaming about what happened to Ethan," Vanessa said, her voice dripping with venom, "but somehow fail to mention how he kidnapped me and locked me away like some prized possession. Care to explain that little detail?"

"Lies! Ethan would never—" Evelyn's denial died on her lips as doubt flickered across her face.

"Why don't you ask him yourself when he wakes up?" Vanessa challenged, crossing her arms.

Evelyn froze, the color draining from her face.

The possibility struck her like a physical blow.

Had Ethan really done something so monstrous?

Now that she thought about it, his behavior had been erratic lately.

She'd called him repeatedly, only to be met with vague excuses and abrupt dismissals. When she'd finally cornered him into answering once, inviting him to Whitmore Manor for dinner, he'd brushed her off with some flimsy excuse about work commitments.

Except he hadn't been working.

The real kicker? His usual entourage hadn't seen him in weeks. It was like he'd vanished into thin air, leaving no trail behind.

If Vanessa's accusation was true... it would explain everything.

Evelyn's righteous fury evaporated, replaced by creeping dread.

If Vanessa wasn't lying... then she'd been attacking the wrong person this whole time.

Alexander seized the moment. "Since we're airing grievances, let's discuss what kind of upbringing produces a man who thinks kidnapping is acceptable behavior. You know damn well what this scandal would do to the Caldwell name if it went public."

He hadn't even begun to deal with Ethan yet. If this got out, Ethan wouldn't just lose his position—he'd be lucky to avoid prison.

Evelyn's mouth snapped shut, her earlier bravado crumbling into stunned silence. The matriarch who'd stormed in like a hurricane now stood subdued, the weight of potential disgrace pressing down on her shoulders.

A tense silence stretched between them before she finally broke it. "I have no idea what you're talking about. Ethan is still unconscious. You can't just throw around accusations without proof. We'll discuss this when he wakes up!"

Without another word, Eleanor spun on her heel and marched away, her heels clicking sharply against the hospital floor.

Ethan's surgery dragged on late into the night, leaving him in a deep, unnatural slumber afterward.

It wasn't until the next morning that he finally stirred, his eyelids fluttering weakly as consciousness slowly returned.

By then, the hospital room was packed to the brim with members of the Caldwell family, all having rushed over from various branches of the family tree.

Most patients wake within hours after surgery, but Ethan's prolonged unconsciousness had everyone on edge.

Eleanor was frantic, running between the hospital and Whitmore Manor, spinning the story to her advantage. She even managed to drag Harold into the mess—a man who usually stayed far removed from family drama.

The Caldwells weren't about to let Harold's personal visit to the hospital go unanswered.

The moment Ethan's eyes cracked open, Vanessa lunged forward, her voice thick with fake concern.

"Ethan!" she cried, clutching his hand. "I've been sick with worry all night! How could you be so reckless, throwing yourself in harm's way for Evelyn? And her—she's utterly selfish! Did she shove you in front of those men to save herself?"

Her words held two devastating truths.

First, Ethan had been with Evelyn when it happened.

Second, Evelyn was somehow involved in Ethan getting stabbed.

The realization hit me like a physical blow. My fingers tightened around the edge of the hospital chair, knuckles turning white.

Across from me, Vanessa’s lips curled into a knowing smirk. She had always enjoyed delivering bad news, especially when it involved Evelyn.

“You didn’t know?” she asked, feigning innocence.

I didn’t answer.

Because the truth was, I hadn’t.

Ethan had never mentioned being with Evelyn that night. He’d spun some vague story about a business meeting gone wrong.

But now, the pieces were falling into place.

The way Evelyn had been avoiding me.

The way Ethan had been unusually distant.

And the way neither of them could look me in the eye.

A bitter taste filled my mouth.

Had they been together that night?

Had something happened between them?

Or worse—had Evelyn been the one to stab him?

The thought sent a chill down my spine.

Evelyn wasn’t violent.

But then again, people changed.

Especially when betrayal was involved.

I stood abruptly, my chair scraping against the floor.

Vanessa’s smirk widened. “Going somewhere?”

I ignored her.

Because right now, I needed answers.

And there was only one person who could give them to me.

Evelyn.

###Chapter 424 Blame It All on Evelyn

Eleanor instinctively looked at Vanessa.

She had tossed and turned all night, agonizing over what would happen when Ethan regained consciousness. The question of how Alexander would handle Evelyn's abduction had haunted her thoughts.

But Vanessa's cunning words had planted a seed in her mind.

The kidnapping had become a messy situation, especially since Evelyn had emerged completely unscathed.

Ethan, however, bore a life-threatening chest wound—one that could have easily been fatal.

Eleanor saw the opportunity and decided to follow Vanessa's lead. She would shift all the blame onto Evelyn.

"Ethan, you reckless fool," Eleanor murmured, her voice trembling with feigned sorrow. "Your own uncle cast you out of Titan Capital Group, and yet you still threw yourself into danger to save his wife? Your kindness has always been your downfall."

She dabbed at her dry eyes with a handkerchief, the picture of a grieving mother.

At first glance, the two women’s performance was convincing.

But Harold Aniston’s expression darkened as he listened. His voice was sharp when he finally spoke.

"What exactly happened here? How did my grandson end up with a bullet in his chest?"

"I contacted Vincent last night, and he's rushing back. Ethan is our family's only heir! This tragedy struck out of nowhere. Vincent is devastated!"

Vincent was Ethan's father. A year earlier, under his mismanagement, Titan Capital Group had suffered catastrophic losses. Furious, Harold had Alexander take control of the company.

As the eldest son, Vincent had been utterly humiliated. But it didn’t end there—he had secretly conspired with Titan Capital’s rivals, attempting to wrest power back from Alexander.

When Harold discovered the betrayal, he banished Vincent overseas without hesitation, forbidding him from returning even for holidays. The message was clear: he had disowned his own son.

Eleanor had been sick with worry, pulling every string to bring Vincent home, but nothing worked.

Her original plan had been to wait until Vanessa successfully gave birth, creating a reason for Vincent’s return. But then Ethan’s sudden accident changed everything.

In a twisted way, this was an opportunity. Her son had nearly died—surely Harold wouldn’t object if Vincent came back now.

As she spoke, a weary middle-aged man pushed through the crowd and entered the hospital room, exhaustion etched into his face.

Despite being the eldest son of the Aniston family, Vincent’s status had long since crumbled.

Vincent dropped his briefcase with a loud thud and sprinted to the hospital bed. "Ethan! My boy!" His voice cracked with emotion. "Your father's here now!"

His rough hands clutched Ethan's limp fingers, his eyes bloodshot. "Who did this to you? How could anyone dare—"

Ethan's face was ghostly pale, his skin clammy from the blood loss. The surgery had drained him completely.

His lips parted weakly, but only a dry rasp escaped his throat.

Vincent's theatrics escalated. "No, don't speak! Save your strength, son!"

Eleanor's sharp voice cut through the room like a knife. "It's that scheming wife of Alexander's, obviously. That Evelyn Carter is nothing but a walking disaster!"

"Alexander?" Vincent's gaze sharpened, like a predator locking onto prey.

Seizing the moment, Vincent turned on the waterworks. He staggered toward Harold, his voice wobbling with exaggerated distress.

"Father, I know Alexander runs Horizon Enterprises now, but you can't let this slide! Your grandson is power-drunk, protecting that woman while my son nearly died! You have to intervene!"

Harold massaged his temples, the headache from their dramatics pounding behind his eyes. He knew this mess needed resolution—fast—before the family tore itself apart.

He snapped at Harrison. "Bring me Alexander's wife. Now."

###Chapter 425 The Performance Begins

Evelyn slept peacefully in her own bed for the first time in weeks.

Now that she had finally escaped Ethan’s grasp, her sleep was deeper than it had been in ages.

Only heaven knew how she had survived those torturous weeks.

The constant fear of Ethan barging into her room at any moment had kept her from truly resting. Some nights, she had dozed fitfully, perched on the edge of the mattress like a wary bird.

Alexander had left for the office that morning, though he had wanted to stay with her.

Evelyn had insisted he go—work came first—and even walked him to the door with a reassuring smile.

When Harold sent a car for her later, Evelyn was momentarily confused.

But the mention of a hospital visit made everything click.

This must be about Ethan.

She took her time preparing—changing into something elegant, applying subtle makeup, and ensuring she looked every bit the composed wife of Alexander Whitmore before stepping into the waiting car.

The hospital room was far more crowded than she had anticipated.

Members of both the second and third branches of the family were already there, their hushed conversations filling the sterile air.

Evelyn reacted instantly, leaping backward just in time to avoid the strike.

The man swung again, his face twisted with fury.

That was it. Evelyn had reached her limit.

She caught his wrist mid-swing and shoved him back with surprising strength.

"What is wrong with you? Use your words, not your fists!" she snapped.

Vincent Black's glare burned with rage. "My son is in this condition because of you!"

"Vincent, have you lost your mind? How is any of this my fault?"

Evelyn, having once been engaged to Ethan, recognized him immediately.

The sudden shift from "Mr. Caldwell" to "Vincent" made him falter for a split second.

When it registered, his expression twisted into something ugly.

Seeing Evelyn alone, without Alexander, Eleanor felt bold enough to strike.

"You dare ask how it's your fault? Ethan is barely clinging to life in that hospital bed! The doctors say his condition is critical. His future could be ruined—all because of you, you scheming witch!"

Vanessa rushed forward, clutching her stomach dramatically.

"Thank God Ethan is strong. If anything happened to him, what would become of me and our child?"

Evelyn saw right through the act.

This was a performance—a carefully orchestrated play to paint her as the villain. They were trying to shift all the blame onto her.

Her gaze flicked to Harold Aniston before she strode toward him.

Eleanor, realizing Evelyn's intent, panicked.

"Don't you dare twist this around and make Ethan the villain to save yourself, Evelyn!" she accused, going on the offensive.

"Twist it around?" Evelyn nearly laughed. "Who's the one playing the victim here?"

She shook her head, amused. "Eleanor, your desperation to silence me speaks volumes. What exactly are you afraid of? You know exactly what you've done."

Harold, who had remained silent until now, sensed there was more to this than he'd been told.

His sharp gaze locked onto Evelyn. "What the hell really happened? I want the truth—from her."

Evelyn's eyes settled on Ethan's unconscious form.

She held the truth like a live grenade—one wrong move and it would shatter everything.

There he lay, vulnerable in the sterile hospital bed, his recovery hanging by a thread. Revealing the truth now would be like pouring salt into an open wound.

Ethan had taken a blade meant for her. That single act of reckless loyalty had landed him here.

And then there was the scandal. Nearly three weeks of unexplained imprisonment had already stained her reputation.

A man and a woman alone together—especially with their complicated history—was a recipe for vicious rumors. The whispers would spread like wildfire, twisting into something far uglier than reality.

She couldn’t risk it.

###Chapter 426 The Hidden Agenda

Vanessa whispered, "Perhaps we should wait until Ethan regains his strength to explain everything himself?"

She wanted to witness how Ethan would attempt to justify his betrayal to them all.

Nearby, Eleanor exhaled in quiet relief when Vanessa avoided mentioning the abduction.

But her relief shattered the moment Ethan's lips parted.

Cassandra was the first to notice Ethan stirring. She seized his hand urgently. "Ethan, can you hear me? How are you feeling?"

Though weakened, Ethan yanked his hand from Cassandra's grip. His icy rejection couldn't have been clearer - he wanted nothing to do with her.

Cassandra's face darkened as she followed Ethan's unwavering gaze toward Evelyn.

His voice emerged as a fragile whisper. "The attacker stabbed me... Evelyn had no part in this..."

"Ethan!" Eleanor spun around, her furious glare cutting through his words like a blade.

Her thoughts raged: Why must he be so obstinate?

The tension in the room became palpable.

Evelyn stood motionless, her expression unreadable. She watched the scene unfold with calculating eyes, waiting for the next move in this dangerous game.

Nathan hovered near the doorway, his posture tense. He kept glancing at his watch, as if expecting someone.

Outside, rain began pattering against the windows, the sudden storm mirroring the turmoil inside.

Ethan's breathing grew labored again, his pallor worsening. Yet his eyes remained locked on Evelyn, conveying something only she seemed to understand.

Eleanor's manicured nails dug into her palms. She'd underestimated her son's loyalty to this woman.

Vanessa bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. The bitter taste filled her mouth as she watched the silent exchange between Ethan and Evelyn.

Somewhere in the mansion, a clock chimed ominously.

The game had changed.

And Evelyn Carter held all the cards.

"That way, she'll be too occupied protecting herself to chase after the kidnapping."

"I know you have a sense of honor, but you can't just casually admit to being stabbed like this!" Vanessa's voice trembled with anger. "That wound almost killed you!"

Vincent Black nodded in agreement. "Exactly! Ethan, I came back specifically to demand justice for you. You're lying here critically injured, while Evelyn walks away unscathed. Anyone can see something's not right about her."

Their synchronized attacks drowned out Ethan's feeble attempts to defend Evelyn.

Vanessa, tears glistening in her eyes, played her trump card—her pregnancy—to guilt-trip Evelyn.

"Evelyn, we're family now. I'm carrying his child. Can't you, for the sake of this baby, just let Ethan and me live in peace?"

They made it seem as if Evelyn had committed some unforgivable sin.

But Evelyn wasn't fooled.

It took her only seconds to unravel their scheme.

They were exploiting Ethan's injury to rewrite the narrative and pin the blame on her.

Evelyn had no desire to kick a man while he was down, but they were weaponizing her kindness, flipping the script to make her the villain.

A chilling realization struck her.

They were terrified the truth about Ethan imprisoning her would surface. Because if it did, the Caldwell family would undoubtedly cast him out.

She never imagined her kindness would be turned into a blade against her.

Evelyn's voice was steady, yet it carried an undeniable weight. "Aren't you the least bit curious why Ethan and I were there at that exact moment, crossing paths with that man?"

"There are call logs on Ethan’s phone—proof of contact between him and the attacker. And that man’s real target wasn’t Ethan. It was Alexander."

The room plunged into silence the moment she finished speaking.

Everyone was frozen, stunned by Evelyn’s revelation.

If her words were true, then Ethan had been secretly working with the criminal.

What she implied was clear—Ethan and that man had plotted against Alexander together.

Eleanor’s face drained of color. She had only learned last night, after running into Evelyn at the hospital, that Ethan had imprisoned her for weeks.

But she never thought he could be involved with a criminal.

In mere seconds, Eleanor’s mind raced. She knew Ethan could never admit to this.

"You’re lying!" Her voice trembled with fury. "I’m his mother. No one knows Ethan better than I do. How could he possibly be connected to that man? Evelyn, these accusations are absurd!"

Ethan had clung to a fragile thread of hope.

He'd convinced himself that Evelyn's prolonged silence meant she still held some affection for him, that perhaps she'd left him an escape route.

But hearing her speak these words with such finality shattered that illusion completely.

The way Evelyn's voice didn't waver, the steel in her gaze - it all confirmed what he'd been refusing to acknowledge.

She had severed every tie between them, cutting him out of her life with surgical precision.

Ethan's fingers curled into fists at his sides, his nails biting into his palms. The physical pain was nothing compared to the realization crashing over him.

All his carefully constructed plans, his secret maneuvers - they meant nothing now.

Evelyn wasn't playing some elaborate game. This wasn't a test of his devotion.

She had moved on completely, while he'd been trapped in the past, obsessing over what might have been.

Across from him, Evelyn stood tall, her posture radiating quiet strength. The diamond on her left hand caught the light, a glittering reminder of her new life with Alexander.

Ethan swallowed hard, his throat suddenly dry.

He'd been so focused on winning her back that he'd failed to see the truth - Evelyn Carter wasn't his to win anymore.

The realization hit him like a physical blow, stealing his breath.

All this time, he'd believed himself the hunter.

Now he understood - he'd always been the prey.

###Chapter 427 Harold’s Verdict

Ethan stood with his shoulders slumped, the weight of guilt pressing down on him.

Vanessa clenched her fists so tightly her knuckles turned bone-white.

She had remained confined to the estate throughout her pregnancy, yet Ethan had deliberately kept his distance, refusing to even glance her way.

Something had shifted between them—Vanessa could sense it the moment she saw him standing beside Evelyn.

Her eyes burned with resentment as she glared at the other woman.

Why does Evelyn always get everything I desire?

She’s already married to Alexander. What more could she possibly want? And yet, she still dares to ensnare Ethan!

Now that Evelyn was accusing Ethan of treachery, Vanessa saw her opportunity to reclaim him.

"Evelyn, you’re seriously claiming Ethan conspired against Alexander? They’re both Whitmores! Why would he ever betray his own family? I refuse to believe my husband would do such a thing!"

Harold slammed his cane against the marble floor, and the room instantly stilled.

"The Whitmore family has strict principles. We do not tolerate deceit or betrayal."

If any member dared collude with outsiders to harm their own blood, the consequences would be severe.

Vincent quickly stepped forward. "Father, I think—"

"I asked your son, not you. Silence!" Harold snapped.

Eleanor shot Ethan a frantic look, silently begging him to stay quiet.

Meanwhile, Sophia, who had been observing from the shadows, smirked and added, "Ethan, your grandfather has always favored you. Just tell him the truth. He’ll understand."

She relished the tension, knowing this conflict wouldn’t touch her own family.

Ethan hesitated, torn between his mother’s pleading gaze and the woman he still loved. His jaw tightened, but he remained silent.

Eleanor seized the moment. "Harold, what is there for Ethan to say? Look at him—he’s injured! If he were truly working with criminals, would they have harmed him this badly? No accomplice would be treated like this."

Her reasoning sounded plausible, but Harold’s expression darkened.

"So you’re suggesting Evelyn is lying?"

Evelyn faced Eleanor, her lips pressed into a thin line of disapproval. "Those words never left my mouth. I simply believe Ethan is being falsely accused. I can't fathom what others are thinking."

Though she hadn't directly called Eleanor a liar, every syllable dripped with accusation, as if the older woman had spun the entire tale from thin air.

Evelyn found it almost laughable. She had nearly become Eleanor’s daughter-in-law once. Thank heavens she’d come to her senses in time. The thought of being bound to this family now made her skin crawl.

Harold observed the exchange with icy detachment. His instincts screamed that something was off.

He couldn’t say for certain whether Ethan was involved with the criminal, but one thing was glaringly obvious—Ethan still carried a torch for Evelyn.

From the moment Evelyn had stepped into the room, Ethan’s gaze had been glued to her, unwavering.

That kind of raw, unguarded longing wasn’t something one could fake.

What’s more, Vincent and Eleanor danced around certain topics with practiced ease. Whenever Ethan should have spoken, they jumped in, desperate to muzzle him.

Harold had already connected the dots.

He knew young men, fueled by reckless impulses, were capable of unspeakable things.

Ethan had clearly crossed a line—one that couldn’t be uncrossed.

If things had spiraled to the point where they’d dragged Alexander into this mess, whatever Ethan had done must have been beyond redemption.

Harold said nothing.

Ethan was a Caldwell—his own grandson, the boy he’d watched grow from a child into a man. The bond between them ran deeper than anything Evelyn could ever hope to challenge.

After a long, heavy silence, Harold kept his thoughts to himself.

The Caldwells were sharp. The moment they noticed Harold’s silence, they knew exactly where his loyalty lay.

###Chapter 428 Harold’s Decision

Sophia Ellis’s husband, an illegitimate son, had never known much warmth. Seizing the opportunity, Sophia tried to mediate, hoping to gain Harold’s favor.

"We’re all family here. Why escalate things? Let’s all take a breath. If we can’t resolve this now, maybe it’s best to move on. No need for lingering resentment."

Audrey Mills, ever the diplomat, nodded in agreement. She didn’t want to alienate anyone, so she backed Sophia’s words. "Sophia has a point. Let’s all step back for a moment."

Eleanor was desperate for this matter to disappear. Her outburst had been calculated—meant to sow confusion and shift focus away from Ethan’s imprisonment of Evelyn.

Now that Evelyn hadn’t mentioned the abduction, Eleanor felt a wave of relief.

"Fine, fine. Let’s just consider Ethan’s injury an unfortunate accident. We’ll drop the matter. Evelyn, don’t keep harping on trivial things!"

Evelyn smiled, but her eyes glinted with mischief. "Trivial? Ethan, why don’t you enlighten everyone about what really happened? I’ve given you the floor."

Ethan stiffened. Though Evelyn’s lips curved upward, the sharp mockery in her gaze was unmistakable.

He opened his mouth to speak, but Eleanor was desperately shaking her head, urging him to stay quiet.

Ethan Caldwell stood frozen, torn between two impossible choices.

Seeing his silence, Evelyn Carter understood his hesitation all too well.

He claimed to care for her, to hope she would reconsider—yet every move he made only drove her further away.

Evelyn counted herself lucky that she had long since stopped believing in him.

"Step back? I've already retreated a thousand steps out of respect for what we once had, and still, you demand more."

She lifted her chin, her voice steady. "The truth isn’t hard to uncover. The man who attacked Alexander is still in custody. His phone records will show every call, every message exchanged with Ethan. A simple check will prove whether they conspired together."

Her gaze shifted to Harold Aniston, the family patriarch.

Harold had always treated her with kindness, but Evelyn wasn’t foolish enough to think he would choose her over his own grandson.

But this wasn’t just about her—it was about Alexander.

Alexander Whitmore was Harold’s youngest son. The real question was, who would Harold side with—his son or his grandson?

Since the day she married Alexander, Harold had seemed to care—but now, she would see where his loyalty truly lay.

Evelyn couldn’t comprehend why Harold had sent Alexander away to live with a rural family right after his birth, then neglected him for years.

Alexander had never known the privileges of the Whitmore name. They only reclaimed him when he was useful.

As Evelyn’s position didn’t permit her to challenge these decisions, she still needed to know—did Harold truly care for his son?

When she mentioned Ethan’s threats against Alexander, Harold stayed silent.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, a sharp ache blooming in her chest for Alexander.

She could endure her own suffering, but she refused to let him share that fate.

Just as she opened her mouth to speak, Alexander’s icy voice cut through the tension behind her.

“Evelyn. Come here.”

She turned, meeting his piercing gaze.

Her breath hitched. She’d intended to handle this alone—she hadn’t meant to drag him into it.

###Chapter 429 Alexander Arrives

Alexander had been standing there for quite some time, unnoticed at the edge of the gathering.

Evelyn tensed under the weight of so many accusing stares. She didn’t want Alexander dragged into this mess, but just knowing he was there eased the tightness in her chest.

The thought that he had heard everything made her heart ache for him even more.

Harold, however, seemed determined to dismiss the entire situation. To him, it was obvious that Alexander should be the one to back down.

“Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be at the office?”

Evelyn moved toward Alexander, her fingers curling tightly around his as if to silently reassure him.

Instinctively, he pulled her against him, understanding her need to shield him.

Warmth spread through him, and all he wanted was to hold her close, to kiss her until the rest of the world faded away.

“Did you really think I wouldn’t come when you were surrounded by wolves?”

Evelyn rested her head against his shoulder, her voice light. “It’s not that bad. They’re still your family, after all. Just… a very passionate debate.”

Evelyn couldn't believe Alexander still wanted to preserve his family's dignity after how horribly they had treated her.

Her heart ached with a mix of warmth and sorrow. Then, to her surprise, he pulled a cupcake from his pocket. "Did you eat breakfast?"

She shook her head, touched that he had remembered.

"I haven't. And honestly, a cupcake sounds perfect right now."

Watching them, Ethan felt a sharp pang of discomfort.

He had just stood there, silent, when he should have spoken up. Now, the moment was gone.

If he confessed now, it would reveal everything—his hidden feelings for Evelyn, the jealousy burning inside him.

His career was finally taking off. Challenging Alexander now would be reckless.

But his hesitation only deepened Evelyn's disappointment in him.

A storm of emotions raged within Ethan. Seeing her in Alexander's arms made him want to tear them apart.

Alexander's hands slid around Evelyn's waist, lifting her effortlessly.

She gasped, not expecting him to carry her in front of everyone.

Instinctively, her arms wound around his neck, her face pressing against his chest as warmth flooded her cheeks.

"I'm taking you to the hallway so you can eat," he murmured, voice low and tender. "Let me handle this."

The man known for his icy demeanor melted only for her, his words soft, his touch gentle.

The Whitmore family watched in stunned silence, realizing how different Alexander was with Evelyn.

She glanced at them, then nodded. "Alright. I trust you."

If anyone could manage his family, it was him.

She shifted, ready to step out of his arms, but his grip tightened.

Even though the hallway was just steps away, he refused to let her walk.

And then she saw it—not just the cupcake, but a doughnut too, glazed with rich, decadent chocolate.

Once he had secured her safely in the hallway, Alexander stepped back.

Evelyn remained seated, absently nibbling on a pastry. The others had deliberately positioned themselves close enough for her to hear every word.

Alexander dragged a chair over and sat down heavily.

The moment he had arrived, a thick, uneasy silence had draped over the room like a suffocating blanket.

No one dared to speak first.

Evelyn’s fingers stilled around her pastry.

She could feel the weight of Alexander’s gaze burning into the side of her face, but she refused to look up.

Not yet.

Not until she was ready.

Across from her, Vanessa shifted uncomfortably, her manicured nails tapping against the armrest of her chair.

The sound was sharp.

Irritating.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, forcing herself to remain calm.

Alexander leaned forward, his voice low but carrying effortlessly in the tense quiet.

"Someone," he said, "is going to explain what the hell is going on here."

His tone was deceptively mild.

Evelyn knew better.

So did everyone else.

Vanessa opened her mouth—

Then closed it just as quickly when Alexander’s icy glare cut to her.

Evelyn finally lifted her head.

Their eyes locked.

And just like that, the air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Alexander’s jaw tightened.

Evelyn tilted her chin up.

A silent challenge.

A dare.

The others held their breaths.

No one moved.

No one breathed.

Then—

A sharp knock at the door shattered the moment.

Evelyn blinked.

Alexander didn’t.

His gaze never left hers as he called out, "Enter."

The door creaked open.

Footsteps.

Then—

"Sir," Simon’s voice cut through the stillness. "We have a problem."

Alexander didn’t react.

Neither did Evelyn.

But the others?

They stiffened.

Because if Simon was here—

If he was interrupting—

Then whatever this "problem" was?

It was bad.

Very, very bad.

After ensuring she was comfortable in the hallway, he stepped away to let her enjoy her treat undisturbed.

Evelyn remained seated, savoring each bite. The thin partition between her and the others amplified every sound from the adjacent room with startling clarity.

Alexander dragged a chair across the floor and took his seat. His presence alone had cast an unnatural hush over the gathering, as if the air itself had stilled in anticipation.

###Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn) novel

The silence stretched, thick and heavy.

Evelyn could hear the faint rustle of fabric as someone shifted uncomfortably. A glass clinked nervously against a table.

She tilted her head, listening intently. The tension was palpable even through the wall.

Alexander crossed his legs, his posture relaxed yet commanding. His sharp gaze swept across the room, daring anyone to break the silence first.

Evelyn smiled to herself, recognizing that familiar, intimidating aura.

Some things never changed.

The snack suddenly tasted sweeter.

She leaned back against the wall, content to wait.

Whatever was about to unfold, it promised to be interesting.

Very interesting indeed.

###Chapter 430 Presenting the Evidence

The tension in the room thickened as several pairs of eyes darted between each other. It was clear—Alexander Whitmore hadn’t come for pleasantries.

His piercing gaze settled on Vincent Black. "Vincent, you're back?"

Vincent’s reply was clipped. "Yes."

"I heard about your little misadventure abroad. Wallet stolen, left stranded—practically made headlines. Had to pull some strings to keep it out of the tabloids. Did you even realize that?"

Once the golden heir of the Aniston legacy, Vincent had plummeted from grace, and the humiliation burned deep.

Alexander’s words struck like a whip. Vincent’s jaw tightened, his face darkening under the weight of everyone’s scrutiny. "What’s the point of dredging that up now?"

The sting of disgrace was unbearable.

A faint smirk curled Alexander’s lips. "Fine, let’s move on. How about we discuss Ethan’s injury instead?"

His tone was deceptively calm as he continued, "I heard you all conveniently pinned the blame on Evelyn, expecting her to justify what happened. Curious, isn’t it? She’s a victim too. Why should she bear responsibility for Ethan’s recklessness?"

Alexander’s eyes flicked to Ethan Caldwell’s face, his expression unreadable.

Alexander scoffed. "So you're implying that just because Evelyn is unharmed, she should be held responsible for Ethan's injury?"

Eleanor fell silent.

Alexander turned back to Ethan, his gaze sharp. "How did you get hurt? Would you like to explain, or should I?"

Ethan pressed his lips together, his expression unreadable.

Ever since Alexander had begun openly displaying his affection for Evelyn, Ethan had felt detached from everything around him. His mind was a chaotic mess.

Noticing Ethan’s silence, Alexander’s voice turned icy. "If you refuse to speak, then I’ll do it for you."

"Alexander," Eleanor interjected quickly, "Evelyn is your wife. Perhaps it’s best if you maintain some impartiality here?"

"Impartiality?" Alexander’s eyes darkened. "She’s not the one at fault. Do you really expect her to take the blame for this?"

Vincent stepped forward, eager to diffuse the rising tension. "Alexander, we’re all family here. There’s no need to escalate things. Father, don’t you agree?"

Vincent knew that if the truth came out, Ethan wouldn’t escape unscathed. He needed to calm the situation before it spiraled.

Harold, too, wanted to avoid further conflict. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Alexander shot him a chilling glare.

Then, a curious voice cut through the thick tension in the room.

"Who exactly is in charge here?"

The question hung in the air, sharp and unexpected.

Alexander twisted the signet ring on his thumb, its weight a constant reminder of his authority. "As head of the Whitmore family, I have every right to oversee its affairs. Don’t you agree, Harold?"

Harold’s gaze flickered to the engraved crest.

Truthfully, he had long relinquished control of the family’s matters. He shouldn’t have involved himself at all.

But Eleanor had come to him earlier, distraught, insisting Ethan’s life was in danger. That had forced his hand.

Harold could see the steel in Alexander’s eyes tonight. There would be no backing down.

With a weary sigh, he waved his hand. Now wasn’t the time to challenge his grandson’s authority. Doing so would only undermine the family’s stability.

Alexander was, after all, the brightest star in the Whitmore lineage. The entire dynasty depended on him.

"Very well," Harold conceded. "You’re the head of this family. Handle it as you see fit."

Alexander gave a subtle nod to Simon, who stood just behind him.

Simon stepped forward, producing a photograph.

The image showed Ethan Caldwell and Zachary Black exchanging hushed words in a dimly lit corner of a shopping mall.

#The man beside Ethan had already been taken into custody.

The photograph trembled slightly in Alexander's grip as he extended it toward Grace.

Her breath hitched.

The glossy surface captured a moment frozen in time—a shadowed figure, their face obscured, but the glint of the blade unmistakable.

Grace's fingers brushed the edge of the photo, her pulse erratic.

"Recognize anything?" Alexander's voice was low, deliberate.

She swallowed hard, scanning every detail—the angle of the wrist, the curve of the fingers gripping the knife.

Something twisted in her gut.

The stance. The way the assailant leaned forward—too familiar.

Her gaze snapped up to meet Alexander's.

"You think it's—?"

His jaw tightened. "I don't think. I know."

A beat of silence stretched between them.

Grace exhaled sharply, her mind racing.

This changed everything.

The truth had been hiding in plain sight all along.

And now, it was staring right back at them.

###Chapter 431 Ethan’s Confession

Sophia gasped theatrically, her hand flying to her chest. "Good heavens! Ethan, are you actually working with this criminal?"

The memory of Evelyn’s earlier accusation—that Ethan had conspired with the attacker to harm Alexander—flashed through her mind. Her eyes widened in exaggerated shock.

"Have you lost your senses, Ethan? You’re Harold’s eldest grandson!" Her voice dripped with feigned dismay. "You’re supposed to lead by example, not sink to this level!"

Though her concern wasn’t genuine, Sophia played her part flawlessly.

Her relationship with Eleanor had always been strained, rooted in years of resentment. Eleanor’s family had never hidden their disdain for Sophia’s husband, Vincent, branding him an illegitimate son.

The bitterness between them stretched back decades.

When Sophia was preparing to marry into the Aniston family, Eleanor’s household had been consumed by grief over a relative’s passing.

The funeral had been a grand affair, drawing nearly all the guests who might have attended Sophia’s wedding. As a result, her ceremony had been embarrassingly sparse.

At the time, Vincent’s mother had just died. Their marriage had been nothing more than a cold business transaction, and the absence of guests had only deepened Sophia’s humiliation.

The scandal wasn’t about the Caldwell family—it was solely about Vincent and his household.

Sophia had set her wedding date months in advance, yet when the day arrived, barely anyone came.

For most, marriage was a sacred, once-in-a-lifetime event, and the empty seats made Sophia seethe with humiliation. Since then, she had nurtured a deep grudge against Eleanor.

Now, Sophia couldn’t help but relish Eleanor’s public disgrace.

Her words pretended to lament Ethan’s poor judgment, but in truth, they were a deliberate confirmation of his criminal ties.

Eleanor shot Sophia a venomous glare, knowing this wasn’t the time to engage.

Alexander flung the photograph at Ethan. "Here’s your proof. What do you have to say for yourself, Ethan?"

Alexander had been waiting for this moment.

After Ethan had kept Evelyn captive for over two weeks, Alexander had no intention of letting him walk away unscathed.

But if he was going to destroy Ethan, he needed a justifiable reason—one that wouldn’t drag Evelyn’s name through the mud.

Exposing Ethan’s kidnapping would only bring shame upon Evelyn, and Alexander refused to let her suffer further.

So, he made a decision.

He would take the blame himself.

That way, if the truth ever surfaced, the scandal would land squarely on his shoulders—not hers.

Ethan and Alexander locked gazes.

The storm in Alexander’s eyes was unmistakable.

Truthfully, Ethan had been manipulated by Zachary. He never truly intended to harm Alexander.

Though he despised Alexander for stealing the woman he loved, his hatred didn’t run deep enough to wish him dead.

Yet now, under Alexander’s piercing scrutiny, Ethan found himself speechless. What defense did he have?

As a man of pride, begging for mercy was beneath him.

They were rivals, after all.

After a heavy silence, Ethan muttered, "Do what you want. I have nothing to say."

His words were surrender.

"Ethan, stop this nonsense!"

Eleanor cut in sharply. "Those photos prove nothing. Zachary used you, didn’t he?"

A mother knew her son best.

The air between us crackled with tension.

"You were played by Zachary." My voice trembled with barely contained fury. "This guilt you feel—it's making you protect Evelyn instead of facing the truth!"

Alexander's icy laughter sent chills down my spine.

"Let me get this straight," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Now it's about him being the victim? About him protecting Evelyn? Not about Evelyn nearly killing our son?"

I clenched my fists, nails digging into my palms.

The betrayal cut deeper than I'd ever admit.

Ethan stood between us, his face pale. "You don't understand—"

"Understand what?" I snapped. "That you conspired with a criminal? That you helped Zachary Black target my family?"

Ethan flinched as if struck.

Alexander's gaze never wavered. "Interesting how quickly the narrative shifts when convenient."

The unspoken accusation hung heavy in the air.

Ethan's shoulders slumped. "I never meant for any of this to happen."

"That's the problem," Alexander said coldly. "Intentions don't matter. Only consequences do."

A tense silence fell.

Somewhere in the mansion, a clock ticked ominously.

Ethan opened his mouth—

Then closed it again.

The truth was a blade between us, sharp and unforgiving.

And it cut all three of us equally.

###Chapter 432 The Crossroads

A flush of discomfort crept across Eleanor's features at Alexander's pointed remark.

Vincent Black seethed with barely contained rage. He knew exactly how ruthless Alexander could be. If not for that, he wouldn’t have remained overseas for years, avoiding this very confrontation.

"Alexander, what’s your game?" Vincent’s voice was sharp. "Why involve my son in our family disputes?"

"Vincent, what an odd thing to say." Alexander’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. "Aren’t we all family? I should be welcoming you back with open arms."

Vincent’s jaw tightened at the thinly veiled threat beneath Alexander’s pleasant tone.

"Besides, this has nothing to do with our personal grievances. Your son made his own mistakes—how is that my fault?"

Alexander tilted his head, his gaze cutting. "Stop coddling Ethan. He’s grown, yet what has he achieved? Vincent, Eleanor—doesn’t that reflect poorly on you as parents?"

Ethan Caldwell stood frozen, his throat dry.

Vincent and Eleanor’s expressions darkened like storm clouds.

Every word from Alexander struck like a blade, leaving them raw.

The truth struck them like lightning—Alexander was avenging Evelyn.

After witnessing how they'd tormented Evelyn, Alexander had sworn to reclaim her honor.

Everyone knew Alexander Whitmore always settled his debts.

Evelyn sat in the corridor, licking frosting from her fingers after finishing a chocolate cupcake. A faint smile curved her lips as she overheard the conversation.

Her heart fluttered, knowing Alexander would go this far for her.

Inside the hospital room, Alexander's icy stare pinned Ethan Caldwell in place.

"I’m offering you two choices." His voice was lethally calm. "Once you’re discharged, you either leave the country like your father and never set foot here again—or stay, but the Whitmore family will disown you. Either way, you lose your place among us."

Silence thickened the air.

Vincent Black’s face twisted with fury. "Alexander! You can’t strip my son of his name! I won’t allow it!"

Alexander didn’t blink. "If expulsion displeases you, then he can choose exile."

But exile was no better.

A life banished overseas meant losing access to the Whitmore fortune and influence. The family name would mean nothing without its power behind it.

Evelyn’s quiet laughter drifted through the door.

She had never felt more cherished.

"Father, speak up! Are you really going to let Alexander do this?" Vincent's voice trembled with panic.

Harold was stunned by Alexander's decision.

A deep instinct told him there was more to Alexander's reasoning than met the eye.

Ethan was Harold's favorite grandson. He had watched him grow, their bond unbreakable.

Harold turned to Alexander, his voice heavy. "Alexander, isn't this punishment too severe?"

"Severe? Father, have you forgotten our family's principles?"

Vanessa, who had remained silent until now, finally reacted.

Both choices led to ruin for Ethan, but she and Ethan were bound together.

"Alexander, I'm carrying the next heir of the Whitmore family. If Ethan is exiled, what becomes of my child?"

Eleanor nodded in agreement. "Exactly. Vanessa carries the family's legacy. That child is your great-grandson, Harold. Alexander, don't be cruel."

"Cruel? Fine. I'll make an exception. The child can remain part of the family—but Ethan cannot."

Alexander's voice was steel, his gaze locked onto Ethan. "You have two choices. Leave the country, or be stripped of the Whitmore name. Decide now."

###Chapter 433 The Reckoning

Ethan Caldwell slumped against the sterile white hospital pillows, his jaw clenched.

The weight of Alexander Whitmore's ultimatum pressed down on him like a vise. Without the Whitmore name shielding him, he was just another man with nothing.

This was retribution. Alexander hadn't forgotten those two weeks when Evelyn Carter had vanished—when Ethan had been the one to orchestrate it. Now, the debt was due.

"Alexander," Ethan muttered under his breath, "you're cutting me off from the company, from the family. Do you really think Evelyn won't see you for the monster you are?"

The Whitmore patriarch's word was law. Even Harold Whitmore couldn't overrule him.

And Ethan had no defense. Conspiring with outsiders against family? Indisputable.

Exile or expulsion—those were his choices. No one would dare speak in his favor.

But Evelyn...

Ethan smirked bitterly. Alexander cared about her. Too much. He wouldn’t risk her seeing him as heartless.

Would he?

The thought flickered—Alexander, ruthless enough to discard his own nephew.

Ethan's fingers curled into the sheets.

Maybe he’d underestimated just how far Alexander would go.

Before Alexander could respond, Evelyn stepped into the room, her heels clicking softly against the marble floor.

"As the head of the Whitmore family, it's Alexander's responsibility to address any misconduct within our ranks." Her voice was calm but carried undeniable authority as she reached for Alexander's hand, a deliberate show of unity. "Only through fair judgment can we maintain order in the Whitmore household, don't you agree?"

She continued, her tone measured yet firm. "None of you truly understand the burden Alexander carries as the family leader. He desires harmony just as much as anyone."

Her gaze swept across the room, silencing any murmurs of dissent. "But when someone breaks the rules, they must face the consequences. How can you accuse Alexander of being ruthless when the fault lies with the one who erred? Isn't that unfair?"

The room fell into heavy silence. Evelyn’s words left no room for argument—no one dared to plead for Ethan now.

Ethan's lips trembled as he watched Evelyn and Alexander standing together, her fingers intertwined with his. A sharp pang of betrayal twisted in his chest.

He had never imagined that not only Alexander but even Evelyn would push for such severe punishment.

The realization struck him like a physical blow—she truly didn’t care. She was cutting ties with him, publicly and decisively.

His heart ached as memories surfaced—those two weeks they had spent together, every meal he had prepared for her with his own hands.

Now, none of it mattered.

Ethan had believed Evelyn would be moved by his sincerity, granting him a fresh start. The realization that she had been acting all along struck him like a physical blow.

Her earlier kindness had been nothing but a carefully crafted illusion—a ploy to dismantle his defenses.

The truth left him feeling like a fool.

His emotions spiraled into chaos, and for the first time, life seemed unbearably bleak.

Vincent's voice cut through the tension. "Once Ethan recovers, I’ll arrange for him to relocate overseas. Alexander, does this satisfy you now?"

Exile was the lesser evil compared to being cast out from the Whitmore family entirely.

Vanessa clutched her stomach, tears spilling down her cheeks. "But I’m carrying his child. What am I supposed to do if he leaves?"

Her voice trembled as she turned to Alexander. "Please… show some mercy. Let him stay until after the baby is born. I’m begging you."

She wept uncontrollably, as if her tears alone could sway his decision.

Eleanor considered the timeline. By the time Vanessa delivered, half a year would have passed. Perhaps by then, the matter of Ethan’s departure would fade into irrelevance.

"Eleanor, if Ethan truly abandons me, I'll drown in tears!"

Vanessa's dramatic sobs filled the lavish sitting room of Whitmore Manor. The crystal chandelier above trembled slightly as her wails grew louder.

Harold Aniston, his patience wearing thin, slammed his newspaper onto the mahogany coffee table. "For heaven's sake, woman! Can't this wait until after the child arrives?"

His voice carried the sharp edge of decades spent commanding boardrooms. The grandfather clock in the corner ticked ominously, counting the strained silence between outbursts.

Vanessa clutched her swollen belly, mascara streaking down her flushed cheeks. "You don't understand! He's been distant ever since..." Her voice cracked as fresh tears spilled over.

Across the room, Eleanor Caldwell sighed, rubbing her temples. The afternoon sunlight streaming through the bay windows suddenly felt oppressive rather than cheerful.

"Vanessa darling," Eleanor began in that polished tone perfected over thirty years of high society galas, "men like Ethan need space when—"

"I don't care what men need!" Vanessa shrieked, hurling a velvet cushion across the room. It knocked over a priceless Ming vase that had survived four generations of Caldwells. The crash echoed through the manor like a gunshot.

Harold's face turned an alarming shade of crimson. "That's enough! I won't have this hysterics under my roof!"

Vanessa opened her mouth to retaliate when a new voice cut through the tension.

"Perhaps," came Alexander Whitmore's smooth baritone from the doorway, "we should discuss solutions rather than casualties." His gaze flickered to the shattered porcelain, then to Vanessa's trembling form. "Especially when there's an heir involved."

The word 'heir' hung in the air like smoke after fireworks. Vanessa's hands instinctively cradled her stomach as fresh sobs wracked her body. Outside, a sudden gust of wind made the rose bushes scrape against the windowpanes like fingernails on glass.

Eleanor exchanged a loaded glance with her son. Some storms, it seemed, couldn't be weathered with mere patience. Not when the Caldwell name—and now the Whitmore legacy—hung in the balance.

###Chapter 434 Vanessa Knew the Truth

Alexander's expression turned stormy, his jaw tightening with visible resistance.

He saw right through their tactics—everyone was playing for time.

But Harold was adamant. "This decision is final!"

In the corner, Evelyn subtly gripped Alexander's sleeve, a silent plea for restraint. Pushing too hard now could backfire spectacularly.

Reluctantly, Alexander yielded.

He knew the truth—no matter how much they delayed, Ethan would eventually be shipped overseas. Any reckless move on his part would only speed up the process.

His gaze locked onto Ethan and his parents, voice dripping with warning.

"Vincent. Eleanor." His tone was ice. "You'd better keep your son on a tight leash. One more misstep, and exile will be the least of his worries. After all, you know exactly what I've spent the last ten years perfecting."

The unspoken threat hung heavy in the air.

At the academy, Alexander had trained relentlessly. Hunting criminals wasn’t just his job—it was second nature.

Most of the men he’d pursued now sat behind bars. And the precinct? Filled with allies who owed him favors.

His words carried an unmistakable warning—if Ethan dared to cross the line again, Alexander would personally ensure he ended up behind bars with no chance of mercy.

While others might not fully grasp Alexander’s meaning, Vincent and Eleanor understood perfectly.

It was a clear threat—keep Ethan in check and abandon any foolish ideas about Evelyn.

Vincent opened his mouth to speak but ultimately remained silent.

Once they left, only Vincent’s family remained in the hospital room.

Eleanor shut the door firmly before turning to Ethan with a sharp question. "Tell me the truth. Did you really kidnap Evelyn?"

Ethan clenched his jaw, refusing to answer. His silence was confirmation enough.

Eleanor’s face paled. "Have you lost your mind? Do you have any idea what you’ve done?"

"Your father has spent the last year barely holding on after going against Alexander in the company. And now you think you can challenge him? Do you honestly believe he’ll let this slide?"

Ethan had no interest in arguing. It was pointless.

Vincent finally spoke, his voice low but firm. "Ethan, these six months are your chance to prove yourself. Build your company. Secure your position. Once you’re untouchable, no one can force you out."

The air in the room grew heavier, thick with tension and unspoken fears.

Eleanor exhaled sharply, her fingers tightening around her purse. "This isn’t just about business anymore. You’ve made it personal."

Ethan’s gaze darkened, but he said nothing.

Vincent’s expression hardened. "If you don’t fix this, we all pay the price."

A long silence stretched between them, broken only by the distant hum of hospital machinery.

Then, from the doorway, a cold voice cut through the tension.

"Too late for that."

Vanessa stood there, her eyes burning with fury.

She had heard everything.

And now, she knew the truth.

Vanessa had been completely in the dark.

The moment she heard Ethan had kidnapped Evelyn and kept her in a secluded villa for weeks, her blood boiled with rage!

As soon as Vincent and Eleanor left, Vanessa stormed up to him. "Ethan, do I mean nothing to you? What were you doing with Evelyn all that time? Did you sleep with her?"

Her mind raced. No wonder Alexander was so furious he wanted to disown him. Ethan’s actions were beyond disgraceful!

The thought of her man betraying her while she carried his child made her feel like a fool for ever defending him.

Everyone knew—everyone—except her.

"Ethan, after everything I’ve sacrificed for you, how could you do this?"

Only then did Ethan react.

He turned, his lips curling into a mocking smirk. "Do what, exactly?"

"How could you be with Evelyn? You—you two—"

Her voice broke. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks.

Suddenly, it all made sense—the way he had pressured her to sign those divorce papers.

The realization hit her like a slap.

The thought struck her like lightning.

"If I had signed those papers back then, would Ethan have run away with Evelyn by now?"

Her fingers trembled around the wine glass.

The past played in her mind like a cruel film reel—Evelyn’s quiet defiance, Ethan’s cold dismissal, the way their lives had shattered around her.

Vanessa took a slow sip, the bitterness of the wine matching the taste of regret in her mouth.

She had played her cards wrong.

Too late, she realized the game had never been in her favor.

Ethan had never been hers to keep.

And Evelyn—her stepsister, the one she had underestimated—had won without even trying.

The truth settled over her like a suffocating blanket.

She had lost.

Not just Ethan.

But everything.

###Chapter 435 The Pitiful Ethan

"Evelyn and I are completely innocent. But you? You were sneaking around with another man while pretending to be devoted to me. Vanessa, how dare you question me now?"

Vanessa pressed her lips together, her fingers trembling. "I'm your wife! I'm carrying your child, and I just pleaded with Alexander for this baby's sake!"

"Did I ever ask you to beg for me?" His voice was ice. "Don't think this child binds us together. That will never happen."

Before she could react, four broad-shouldered bodyguards stepped into the room.

"With my mother gone, Vanessa, I'm taking you to end this pregnancy."

Her blood ran cold. She had never imagined Ethan could be this cruel.

As the men advanced, she stumbled backward, her hands instinctively cradling her stomach.

"No! You can't do this! I won't let you!" Her voice cracked with desperation.

"Ethan, without this baby, how will you stay in Cresthaven? If you're forced to leave, what will happen to you and Evelyn?"

The words spilled out before she could stop them.

His face darkened with rage. A glass shattered against the wall beside her head.

"Silence! How dare you speak such filth? You will not soil her reputation!"

The ceramic mug struck Vanessa's midsection with brutal force. She gasped, her face draining of color as she doubled over, clutching her stomach. Cold sweat beaded along her brow, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

Being treated like this by the man she adored shattered Vanessa completely.

Her vision blurred with unshed tears, shoulders trembling violently.

"Evelyn is your perfect fantasy, isn't she? Just mentioning her name makes you defensive? I'm your wife!"

Her voice cracked with raw emotion.

"You want to divorce me? To discard me like trash? Listen well, Ethan—that will never happen. I know Evelyn. As long as I breathe, she will never take you back!"

A bitter laugh escaped her.

"I want you to suffer as I do. Ethan Caldwell, you will love only me!"

Her venomous words ignited Ethan's fury. If not for his weakened state, he would have lunged at her.

The murderous glint in his eyes made Vanessa shriek, "Help! He's trying to kill me!"

The chaos drew immediate attention.

Vincent and Eleanor, who had barely stepped away, rushed back in alarm.

Assessing the scene, they quickly ushered Vanessa out for medical attention.

The weight of the situation pressed heavily on everyone.

It wasn't just about Evelyn anymore—it would shape Ethan's entire future.

Eleanor stormed back into the hospital room, her voice sharp as she glared at her son. "Ethan, if you even think of harming that child, I swear I won’t let you. Not while I’m still breathing."

She exhaled sharply, frustration lacing her words. "Are you out of your mind? This baby is your only way to stay in Cresthaven. If Vanessa loses it, what then? You’d rather be exiled overseas forever?"

Ethan lay motionless, his hollow gaze fixed on the ceiling. He looked shattered, like a puppet with its strings cut.

As if nothing mattered anymore.

Vincent couldn’t hold back his disgust. "Pathetic. Letting a woman break you like this. I never thought my own son would be this weak."

"Stop," Eleanor snapped, though she agreed. Even she found his behavior inexcusable.

How could he throw everything away over a woman he can never have again?

Evelyn ruined him.

Meanwhile, Alexander drove Evelyn back to Willowbrook Apartments. The moment they stepped inside, she turned and wrapped her arms around him tightly.

His hands settled on her waist. "What’s wrong? Are you upset I was late earlier?"

###Chapter 436 The Bonds That Matter

Evelyn nestled closer to Alexander's chest, her fingers tracing idle patterns on his shirt. "No, I actually pity you."

Alexander arched a brow, amusement flickering in his gaze. "Pity me?"

"Mm." She nodded, her voice softening. "Your father knows Ethan is working with Zachary to hurt you, yet he still defends him. He tried to make it seem like nothing."

Once, Evelyn had admired Harold. But now? Disappointment coiled tight in her chest.

It struck her then—no one in this family truly valued Alexander. To them, he was expendable.

Alexander chuckled, his fingers threading gently through her hair. "I stopped expecting anything from them a long time ago. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a family’s love."

Evelyn tilted her head up, her eyes bright with conviction. "Then I’ll love you enough for all of them. I’m your family now."

A slow, devastating smile curved his lips. "Oh? Is that a promise?"

Before she could answer, his arm banded around her waist, pulling her flush against him. He dipped his head, capturing her lips in a kiss so tender it stole her breath.

Evelyn froze for a heartbeat, warmth flooding her cheeks at the soft press of his mouth.

His thumb brushed her jaw, lingering. "You’re blushing."

She swatted his shoulder, but her traitorous heart raced anyway.

The kiss was electrifying, leaving Evelyn breathless and trembling. She melted into Alexander’s arms, surrendering completely to the heat between them.

Alexander kept his gaze locked on her, studying every flicker of emotion across her face.

In that moment, with Evelyn pressed tightly against him, the weight of her return finally settled in his chest.

The past two weeks had been pure torment.

He’d forced himself to maintain a facade of normalcy, careful not to alert Ethan to his desperation.

With Evelyn trapped in Ethan’s clutches, Alexander knew any overt move to find her would only provoke the man further—putting her in even greater danger.

More than once, he’d considered storming Ethan’s family estate and taking Grace and Eleanor hostage to force a trade.

But cold logic had prevailed. Such reckless actions would only tighten the noose around Evelyn’s neck.

When their lips finally parted, Alexander’s hunger was far from sated. He trailed scorching kisses down her throat, lingering at the delicate hollow of her collarbone.

Evelyn shuddered, her fingers tightening in his shirt.

His arm banded around her waist as he guided her backward, never breaking contact as they moved toward the staircase.

The possessive intensity in his touch wrapped around her like armor. For the first time in weeks, Evelyn felt truly safe.

After thirty days of constant anxiety, Evelyn had finally stepped through the familiar doors of Whitmore Manor yesterday. Alexander hadn't pushed her for anything last night - just wrapped his strong arms around her as they drifted into peaceful sleep.

But morning light brought different intentions.

The golden afternoon sun stretched across their bedroom, promising hours of uninterrupted intimacy ahead.

Alexander's lips claimed Evelyn's the moment the door clicked shut behind them. Gone was the tenderness of earlier kisses - this was raw hunger, desperate and consuming.

His dress shirt hung open, revealing the sculpted chest of a man in his prime. Those piercing gray eyes darkened as they traced every curve of Evelyn's face, his mouth leaving a trail of fire along her sensitive neck.

Each featherlight touch sent electric shocks through Evelyn's body.

Her heartbeat thundered so violently she feared it might crack her ribs, her head tilting back of its own accord. Alexander's intentions became unmistakably clear as his hands grew bolder.

Their breaths mingled as he nipped at her swollen lips, his movements growing more urgent. Fingers tangled in the fabric of Evelyn's sundress, hiking the hem upward when -

A sudden realization froze her in place.

The realization struck Evelyn like lightning—Alexander had no idea about her pregnancy.

Just weeks ago, she had been plagued by relentless morning sickness, unable to keep even water down. But lately, the nausea had faded, leaving her almost forgetting the tiny life growing inside her.

She pressed a hand to her stomach, her thoughts racing.

Would Alexander be happy?

The question gnawed at her. Their relationship had been a whirlwind of passion and pain, and now, this unexpected blessing—or complication—lay between them.

She imagined his reaction.

Would his eyes light up with joy? Or would that familiar guarded look return, the one he wore when life surprised him?

Evelyn exhaled slowly.

She needed to tell him.

But not yet.

First, she had to be certain—certain of his feelings, certain of their future.

Because this child deserved more than uncertainty.

It deserved love.

And she would make sure it had that, no matter what.

###Chapter 437 I Am Pregnant

"Alexander, wait!"

Evelyn quickly reached out to stop him, sensing the restless energy radiating from his body.

His voice was low, laced with desire. "Why? What is it?"

"I—" She hesitated, her teeth sinking into her lower lip. She needed to tell him she couldn’t afford any physical exertion right now.

Before she could explain, Alexander captured her lips again, his kiss deep and urgent, leaving no room for protest.

Heat flooded Evelyn’s cheeks. She placed her hands against his chest in a feeble attempt to push him away, but he only tightened his grip, pressing her closer. His breath was warm against her ear as he murmured, "We can talk later."

Was he really this impatient? Evelyn knew if she didn’t speak now, it would be too late. Alexander was young, strong, and full of relentless stamina.

After being trapped by Ethan for nearly three weeks, he had held back last night, thinking she needed rest. His restraint had been admirable—but now, his hunger was undeniable.

Feeling the intensity of his need, Evelyn realized things were escalating too fast. She cupped his face, pulling back just enough to meet his gaze.

"Alexander… I’m pregnant."

Silence.

He froze, his expression shifting from desire to stunned disbelief.

Evelyn met his gaze, her heart pounding. "I'm pregnant," she confessed softly. "I found out the night Ethan took me away, but I never got the chance to tell you."

She reached for Alexander's hand and guided it to her abdomen. "There's a baby here. Our baby."

For a moment, Alexander simply stared at her, his expression unreadable. Then, realization dawned in his eyes, widening them in shock. "You're serious?" he murmured, lowering himself until his lips brushed against her stomach.

Evelyn couldn't help but smile at his reaction. Alexander, always so composed and sharp, now looked utterly disarmed. At barely a month along, there was nothing for him to hear, but his eagerness warmed her heart.

He pressed his ear against her, listening with exaggerated focus. Amused, she teased, "Hear anything? Or just my stomach growling?"

After a long pause, he lifted his head, his voice low and rough. "I heard it."

"Heard what?" she asked, bewildered.

"The baby," he said, his lips curving into a slow, wicked smile. "Told me we can definitely do this."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Before she could react, Alexander pulled her into his arms, his fingers tangling in her hair as he kissed her—deep, possessive, and just rough enough to make her pulse race. Even though she was the one on top, she melted into him, surrendering to the heat of his touch.

He wasn't gentle. Not entirely.

His mouth moved over hers with bruising intensity, leaving her lips tingling and her body aching. They didn't go further—couldn't, not now—but the way he teased her, the way his hands traced slow, maddening paths over her skin, left her trembling and breathless.

Alexander was endlessly creative in showing his affection, leaving Evelyn breathless and clinging to him for balance.

His arms wrapped around her from behind, their bodies pressed together so closely it felt like they shared one heartbeat. The heat of his skin against hers blurred all boundaries between them.

His warm exhale danced across the nape of her neck, igniting a trail of goosebumps down her spine.

To her own astonishment, Evelyn realized she was becoming addicted to this—to him. The safety of his embrace, the way his presence wrapped around her like sunlight. She never wanted to move.

###Chapter 438 Did He Cook for You?

From the very start, Evelyn had always intended to secure a powerful ally. But now, she was certain—she had fallen hopelessly in love with Alexander.

His mature charm was intoxicating. She adored the way he held her, the warmth of his embrace, the passion they shared.

He was everything she had ever dreamed of in a husband.

"Don’t you have work today?" she asked, tracing idle patterns on his chest.

"I’m staying with you," Alexander murmured, his hand drifting to rest on her slightly rounded stomach. "You’re showing more each day. How do you even focus at the office?"

The pressure at Titan Capital Group was relentless. As the president’s executive assistant, Evelyn juggled endless tasks—exhausting even without the added strain of pregnancy.

Alexander refused to let her push herself too hard.

She understood his concern but bit her lip. "It’s still early. Won’t I just be bored at home?"

His lips curved. "Do whatever makes you happy. Take up a hobby. Travel. I’ll make sure you have everything you need."

His words wrapped around her like a promise.

And for the first time, Evelyn let herself believe in it completely.

The revelation of her pregnancy would undoubtedly make them even more protective of her.

Perhaps it was best she avoided work for now.

"Are you hungry? I'll prepare something for you." Alexander's mood was buoyant, his energy undiminished despite their earlier exertion.

He slipped into his pajamas and propped himself up against the headboard.

"I've heard pregnant women often experience morning sickness. Are there any foods you can't stomach? I'll make sure to steer clear of them."

Evelyn shook her head. "I don't have morning sickness anymore."

Alexander froze.

That meant her morning sickness had already passed.

Which meant it had happened during the time Ethan had imprisoned her.

Guilt twisted in his chest. He knelt before Evelyn, taking her hands in his.

"I'm sorry I wasn't there to protect you."

The thought of her enduring that alone—without him—gnawed at him.

She gave a small, reassuring shake of her head. "Alexander, none of it was your fault."

The golden afternoon light spilled through the windows as Alexander studied Evelyn’s face.

His voice was soft but insistent. "Tell me what you want to eat. I’ll make it for you now." His fingers brushed against hers. "You must have suffered so much."

Evelyn shook her head, not wanting him to drown in regret. "It wasn’t that bad," she admitted. "Ethan actually cooked for me."

Alexander’s expression darkened instantly.

"Ethan cooked for you?"

As Ethan’s uncle, Alexander knew better than anyone—Ethan had never lifted a finger in the kitchen. He barely even stepped inside one. Yet, he had cooked for Evelyn.

The possessive glint in Alexander’s eyes didn’t escape her. She cupped his face gently. "I only ate what he made because I had to. Nothing more."

His jaw tightened. "I was too lenient with him. He had no right to be so... attentive to you."

A beat of silence passed before he spoke again, his voice low. "Besides cooking... did he ever..."

He trailed off, unwilling to voice the question. He trusted Evelyn. He didn’t want to push her into reliving painful memories.

But the truth remained—she and Ethan had lived alone together for weeks.

Evelyn leaned in, pressing her forehead against his. "Don’t think about it. There’s nothing to dwell on."

Alexander exhaled sharply, pulling her closer.

He wouldn’t let his imagination run wild.

But forgiveness?

That would take time.

Alexander's irritation simmered beneath the surface.

Some thoughts were too dangerous to entertain.

The truth was, his patience had limits he hadn't acknowledged before.

Vanessa's latest provocation had struck a nerve.

He clenched his fists, then forced himself to relax.

Memories of Evelyn's smile flashed through his mind—warm, genuine, untouched by the pettiness surrounding them.

A bitter laugh escaped him.

How had he ever believed himself above jealousy?

The scent of roasted herbs lingered in the penthouse kitchen.

His stomach twisted.

Had Nathan prepared that meal for her?

The question haunted him more than he cared to admit.

###Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn) novel

Alexander turned toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Manhattan's skyline glittered mockingly below.

He'd built an empire, yet this—this helplessness—was entirely new territory.

His phone buzzed.

One glance at Eleanor's name made his jaw tighten.

Family obligations could wait.

Right now, he needed answers.

And he knew exactly where to find them.

The elevator doors slid open with a whisper.

Alexander stepped inside, his reflection grim in the polished brass.

Tonight, he'd confront the truth.

No matter the cost.

###Chapter 439 The Mysterious Snapshot

Evelyn shook her head, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of her sweater. "I barely left my room the whole time. The only moments I saw Ethan were during meals."

She knew exactly what Alexander was worried about.

Men were all the same when it came to these things.

Her voice was steady, determined. "During those weeks, Ethan and I never crossed any lines. I would never betray you."

Tears shimmered in her eyes, threatening to spill over.

Alexander pulled her into his arms before they could fall.

"Evelyn, I'm the one who should apologize. It's not that I don't trust you. It's just—"

"I know."

She couldn't bring herself to blame him.

If their roles were reversed, if he had spent weeks alone with another woman, she would have been consumed by jealousy.

The fact that he was trying to stay composed meant everything.

"I'll make you dinner." Alexander released her and strode out of the bedroom, his broad shoulders tense.

Evelyn exhaled slowly as the door clicked shut behind him.

His expression had been stormy.

He was still upset.

And she had no idea how to fix it.

Alexander Whitmore was chopping vegetables in the kitchen when his phone buzzed.

An unknown number had sent him a photo.

His fingers hovered over the screen before he tapped to open it.

Instantly, his blood boiled.

The image showed Evelyn Carter and Ethan Caldwell stepping out of a car together, hands clasped, in front of a concert hall.

His grip tightened around his phone until his knuckles turned white.

They were holding hands.

Before he could process it, another message arrived.

Another photo.

This time, inside the concert hall.

Evelyn was nestled against Ethan’s chest, bathed in soft backlighting.

They looked perfect together.

Too perfect.

Alexander’s jaw clenched, his chest rising and falling with barely contained fury.

Then—a third notification.

His stomach dropped.

This one was worse.

Much worse.

Evelyn lay asleep in a dimly lit room, the edge of Ethan’s pajama sleeve visible beside her.

Alexander prided himself on his self-control.

But right now?

He wanted to rip Ethan apart with his bare hands.

With a snarl, he hurled his phone against the floor.

It shattered.

Just like his restraint.

Without another thought, he stormed out of the house.

The door slammed shut with such force that the walls trembled.

Moments later, the roar of an engine cut through the silence.

Evelyn rushed to the window just in time to see Alexander's car peeling out of the driveway.

Tires screeched.

Gravel flew.

Then he was gone.

She called his name twice, her voice swallowed by the night.

Her stomach twisted.

Hadn't he promised to cook dinner?

What had just happened?

Frowning, Evelyn descended the stairs.

That's when she saw it—his phone, shattered beyond recognition on the marble floor.

Her fingers trembled as she picked up the pieces.

The screen was obliterated.

The casing split apart.

Something was very wrong.

In all their years together, she'd never seen Alexander lose control like this.

Even from a distance, his rage had been palpable—a storm rolling off him in waves.

What had set him off?

Was it... because of her?

Without another thought, Evelyn grabbed her keys.

But Alexander wasn't headed home.

His taillights disappeared in the direction of the hospital.

The door crashed open with a violent bang, jolting Ethan Caldwell awake from his uneasy slumber.

Before he could even blink the grogginess from his eyes, Alexander Whitmore's furious grip seized him by the collar, yanking him forward.

A sharp pain exploded across Ethan's face as Alexander's fist connected with his jaw.

Fresh from surgery, Ethan's chest still ached from the lingering trauma, leaving him too weak to defend himself.

Blood gushed from his nose, staining his hospital gown crimson, dripping like a relentless waterfall down his chin.

Alexander didn't stop there.

Another brutal punch landed squarely on Ethan's mouth, splitting his lip and sending him reeling back against the pillows.

His vision blurred, his body trembling from the assault.

Ethan barely had time to register the metallic taste of blood before Alexander loomed over him again, his expression dark with unchecked fury.

The room spun.

Ethan's fingers weakly grasped at the sheets, his breath ragged.

He had no strength left to fight back.

Not like this.

Not when Alexander was a storm of vengeance, and he was nothing but a broken man in a hospital bed.

The door behind them creaked slightly, unnoticed in the chaos.

A shadow lingered just beyond the threshold—someone watching.

Someone who had orchestrated this moment.

And as Alexander raised his fist once more, Ethan realized with chilling clarity—this was far from over.

###Chapter 440 What If It’s Mine?

Alexander’s expression darkened as he glared at Ethan, his jaw clenched tight.

The sight of him made Alexander’s blood boil.

“What the hell did you do to her?” His voice was low, dangerous.

“Did you send those photos to provoke me?” Alexander’s eyes flashed with fury. “Ethan, are you that eager to die? Have I been too lenient with you?”

There were no outsiders here—no need for subtlety.

Ethan knew exactly who Alexander was talking about.

Evelyn.

But he was genuinely confused. “Photos? What photos?”

“Still playing dumb?” Alexander’s lips curled into a cold smirk. “You know exactly what I’m talking about. Those photos were taken with your phone.”

Ethan did have pictures with Evelyn on his phone—but he hadn’t sent them to Alexander.

His phone hadn’t even been in his possession since the surgery.

Yet, Alexander’s reaction told him everything.

The photos had been leaked.

And they must have been devastating. Otherwise, Alexander wouldn’t be this enraged.

A slow, triumphant smile spread across Ethan’s face.

For years, he had lived in Alexander’s shadow.

But now?

Now, he finally had the upper hand.

The tension in the room was suffocating.

Ethan Caldwell smirked, wiping the blood from his split lip with the back of his hand. His eyes gleamed with defiance as he stared up at Alexander Whitmore.

"You sent me away because you were afraid," Ethan taunted. "Afraid that Evelyn and I would find our way back to each other. Those photos? They got under your skin, didn’t they?"

Alexander’s jaw tightened, his knuckles white from the force of his clenched fists.

Ethan continued, undeterred. "Do you even know what we’ve been doing these past twenty days? We met. We talked. We went to concerts, shared meals—real dates, Alexander. Not a rushed marriage like yours." His grin widened. "Tell me, have you ever actually taken Evelyn on a proper date?"

Alexander’s expression darkened, but Ethan only laughed.

"Face it. Evelyn and I have history. Memories you can’t erase, no matter how hard you try."

A fresh trickle of blood slid down Ethan’s chin, but he didn’t flinch. Instead, his smile turned sharper, more dangerous.

"You shipped me off because you saw me as a threat. That’s the truth, isn’t it? You’re not as confident as you pretend to be."

Alexander’s voice was ice. "You’re delusional. Shared childhood means nothing. She’s my wife now. She’s carrying my child. That makes you irrelevant."

Ethan’s eyes flashed.

"Are you sure about that?" He tilted his head, his gaze locking onto Alexander’s. "How do you know it’s yours? What if it’s mine?"

The words struck like a blade.

Alexander’s control snapped.

Ethan Caldwell smirked, his tone dripping with arrogance. "I said the child in Evelyn's womb is mine, Alexander."

The words had barely left his lips when Alexander Whitmore's fist connected with his face again.

Blood gushed from Ethan's already injured nose, staining his crisp white shirt.

"Bullshit!" Alexander's voice was a low, dangerous growl. "First of all, I know Evelyn would never betray me. Second, you're delusional if you think she'd ever take you back!"

His knuckles ached from the force of the punch, his entire body trembling with barely restrained fury.

Despite his unwavering trust in Evelyn, the mere suggestion was enough to ignite his rage.

Ethan wiped the blood from his lips, unfazed. "Test the baby’s DNA after it’s born, Alexander. Then you’ll see I’m telling the truth."

The challenge hung in the air between them, thick with tension.

Alexander’s jaw clenched.

He refused to entertain the idea—yet doubt, like poison, slithered into his mind.

What if Ethan wasn’t lying?

What if the child wasn’t his?

The thought was unbearable.

But Evelyn wouldn’t.

She couldn’t.

Would she?

###Chapter 441 Vanessa's Premonition

Alexander's calm demeanor and unwavering confidence sent chills down Nathan's spine.

He trusted Evelyn implicitly, yet Ethan's words planted seeds of doubt.

Was it possible...?

No! Impossible!

"Ethan, do you really think I won't kill you just because you're lying in a hospital bed?"

Nathan's grip tightened around Ethan's collar before his fist slammed into Ethan's abdomen.

Blood sprayed from Ethan's lips, staining the pristine white sheets beneath him.

Nathan didn't hold back. Each strike sent waves of agony through Ethan's battered body.

His vision blurred. His thoughts scattered.

The surgical wound on his chest burned like fire. For a moment, he wondered if this was how death felt.

The commotion in the room grew too loud to ignore.

Vanessa burst through the door.

Her breath caught at the sight—Ethan, beaten and bleeding.

Without hesitation, she threw herself between them.

"Uncle Nathan! Have you lost your mind? You're the head of the family! How could you do this to Ethan? What has he even done to deserve—"

Her voice cracked.

"DOCTOR! SOMEONE HELP!"

The scent of iron hung thick in the air.

Vanessa didn't doubt it—if she'd arrived even a minute later, Ethan might not have survived.

Tears blurred her vision as medical staff flooded the room.

Nathan was forced out, his expression icy.

Vanessa barely held herself together.

That morning, Ethan had struck her stomach with a glass in a fit of rage. The pain had been sharp, terrifying.

The doctors had run tests.

No abnormalities. The baby's heartbeat is strong.

But the ache lingered.

A deep, unsettling sensation that something was wrong.

She needed this child.

Without it, her marriage to Ethan would crumble.

He needed this child.

Or Nathan would exile him without hesitation.

The deeper Vanessa thought about it, the more bitterness consumed her.

While other expectant mothers were treated like royalty, why was Ethan doing everything in his power to erase her and their unborn child from his life?

How had her existence become so wretched?

She and Ethan used to be perfect together. So why had their relationship crumbled to dust after their wedding?

Vanessa felt trapped in a maze with no exit, unintentionally driving him further away with each passing day.

What could she possibly do to turn things around?

Those anonymous texts Alexander had received? They were all from Vanessa.

If she was drowning in misery, why should Evelyn get to float on cloud nine?

Misery loved company—and Vanessa was determined to drag everyone down with her.

Just as she anticipated, Alexander snapped.

But what shocked her was the sheer violence of his reaction.

The always composed, controlled Alexander Whitmore lost it completely.

He threw punch after punch at Ethan, consequences be damned!

The raw fury in his eyes was something she’d never seen before.

A twisted satisfaction curled inside her.

At least someone else was suffering too.

A cold shiver ran down Vanessa's spine.

She couldn't explain it, but something felt... off.

Then she saw it—the way Alexander's eyes darkened when Ethan Caldwell's name was mentioned. The ruthless edge in his voice. The way his fingers curled into fists.

Vanessa's lips curved into a slow, satisfied smile.

This was it. The moment she'd been waiting for.

Evelyn Carter would lose Alexander Whitmore.

And Vanessa would be there to watch it all unfold.

The thought sent a thrill through her veins.

She could already picture Evelyn's heartbreak. The tears. The devastation.

Vanessa leaned back, savoring the delicious anticipation.

Everything was falling into place exactly as she'd planned.

Soon, Alexander would be hers.

And Evelyn?

She'd be nothing.

###Chapter 442 What Now?

The moment Alexander walked out the door, Evelyn immediately dialed Claire. She needed to confide in someone about everything that had transpired recently. "Claire, I need your advice. Alexander just stormed out. Do you think he's really angry? Could this escalate?"

Claire was taken aback by the call. Evelyn had been unreachable for weeks—ever since Ethan had forcibly kept her confined.

She never imagined Ethan would go to such lengths, completely disregarding the repercussions. Now, Evelyn was left to pick up the pieces of the mess he had created.

"Honestly, most men wouldn't handle this well. Alexander is probably questioning what really happened between you two during those twenty days."

After all, Evelyn and Ethan had been isolated together in the same house for over twenty days—not just a brief encounter.

"What do I do?" Evelyn asked, her voice tight with worry.

A simple explanation wouldn't be enough. Even if Alexander wanted to believe her, doubt would linger in the back of his mind.

"I can't fix this for you, but aren't you pregnant? That baby is a bond between you two. Maybe you should show him a little vulnerability."

Unsettled, Evelyn ended the call and decided to prepare dinner for Alexander, hoping the gesture might soften his heart.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the grand ballroom of Whitmore Manor, the air shifted.

Every gaze turned toward her, whispers fluttering like startled birds.

She had expected this.

After all, it wasn’t every day the estranged wife of Alexander Whitmore made an appearance at his family’s exclusive gala.

Her crimson gown clung to her curves, the slit revealing just enough to command attention without crossing into scandal.

Vanessa Hart’s lips curled into a sneer from across the room.

Evelyn ignored her.

She had bigger prey tonight.

Alexander stood near the marble fireplace, his tailored tuxedo accentuating his broad shoulders.

Their eyes met.

A spark of something dangerous flickered in his gaze before he schooled his expression into cool indifference.

Good.

Let him pretend he wasn’t affected.

She took a sip of champagne, the bubbles sharp against her tongue.

Then she saw him.

Ethan Caldwell.

Her ex-fiancé.

The man who had shattered her trust before Alexander had even entered her life.

He was speaking with Nathan Reeves, his ever-loyal shadow.

Evelyn’s grip tightened around her glass.

This was why she had come.

Not for Alexander.

Not for reconciliation.

But for revenge.

She moved through the crowd with deliberate grace, her heels clicking softly against the polished floor.

Ethan hadn’t noticed her yet.

Perfect.

She stopped just behind him, close enough to catch the faint scent of his cologne—something expensive and suffocating.

"Miss me?" she purred.

He stiffened before turning, his smile strained.

"Evelyn. I didn’t expect to see you here."

She tilted her head.

"Didn’t you?"

His gaze flickered toward Alexander, then back to her.

"I heard about the divorce. Shame."

Her laugh was low, venomous.

"Oh, Ethan. You always did have a talent for understatement."

Before he could respond, Alexander’s voice cut through the tension.

"Evelyn."

She turned, meeting his stormy eyes.

"Alexander."

His jaw clenched.

"We need to talk."

She arched a brow.

"Do we?"

Around them, the party continued, oblivious to the war brewing in its midst.

Vanessa’s laughter rang out, sharp and mocking.

Evelyn smiled.

Let them watch.

Let them all see what happened when they underestimated her.

Tonight, the game changed.

And she intended to win.

The living room clock ticked loudly as Evelyn curled on the sofa, her fingers tracing patterns on the velvet cushions. The aroma of roasted chicken and rosemary potatoes lingered in the air, growing colder by the minute.

The front door clicked open at exactly 9:47 PM.

Evelyn bolted upright, her bare feet hitting the icy hardwood before she could think. She barely registered the chill as she rushed toward the foyer.

Alexander stood framed in the doorway, his tailored coat dusted with snowflakes. His jaw was clenched tight enough to crack walnuts. When his stormy gaze dropped to her naked toes, his frown deepened.

"I made your favorite," she blurted, twisting the oversized sleeves of her ivory nightgown. The fabric swallowed her frame whole these days—first from stress-eating after Ethan's betrayal, then from forgetting meals altogether.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he scooped her up effortlessly. "Christ, Evelyn. The thermostat reads fifty degrees." His voice was sandpaper-rough, yet his hands cradled her like spun glass.

Three hours earlier, Alexander had vanished mid-meal prep, leaving a shattered smartphone in the driveway.

Now his wool sweater scratched her cheek as she breathed in his bergamot scent. "Your phone," she whispered against his collarbone. "And you... you just disappeared."

The grandfather clock chimed ten times before he spoke again. "I needed air." His thumb brushed her ankle where the cold had turned her skin blue. "But I should've remembered who waits for me in the cold."

Something wet splashed onto his shoulder. Evelyn didn't realize she was crying until Alexander tilted her chin up, his eyes reflecting the broken pieces of whatever storm he'd weathered alone tonight.

Alexander had been distant all day.

When Evelyn finally saw him at Whitmore Manor, his expression was unreadable. She noticed the way his jaw clenched when she asked about his sudden disappearance.

"I had urgent business to attend to," was all he offered.

He didn't mention the damning photographs that had mysteriously appeared in his inbox. Sensing his reluctance to elaborate, Evelyn chose not to push. Some battles were better fought in silence.

The grandfather clock chimed four times.

"I made dinner," she said instead, guiding him toward the dining room with gentle determination. "Are you hungry?"

The aroma of roasted herbs and red wine reduction filled the air. Evelyn's stomach growled, but she'd waited this long - she could wait until Alexander was ready to eat.

The table was set for two, with candles flickering between them.

"Do you like it?" she asked, watching his face for any reaction. The shadows under his eyes told her more than words ever could.

Outside, dusk painted the sky in bruised purples.

Somewhere between the first course and dessert, the unspoken things between them grew heavier than the silverware. Evelyn counted the seconds between Alexander's measured bites.

The clock ticked louder.

In the dim light, she noticed his left thumb tracing the edge of his water glass - his tell when wrestling with unspeakable truths.

The food grew cold between them.

Neither mentioned the way Alexander's phone buzzed three separate times during the meal, nor how his knuckles whitened around the stem of his wine glass with each vibration.

Evelyn pretended not to see.

Some storms needed to brew in silence before they could be weathered together.

The candles burned lower.

When Alexander finally reached across the table to cover her hand with his, his palm was colder than the untouched chocolate mousse between them.

Evelyn turned her hand upward to intertwine their fingers.

No words.

Just the quiet understanding that whatever came next, they'd face it together - even if neither was ready to name the storm clouds gathering overhead.

The grandfather clock struck six.

Somewhere in the house, a phone rang unanswered.

The mousse remained untouched.
###Chapter 443 I'm Telling the Truth

Alexander's lips curved into a radiant smile the moment he saw the spread on the dining table.

At a glance, he recognized Evelyn had prepared his favorite dishes—three entrees and a steaming bowl of soup.

She turned toward the kitchen, intending to fetch the silverware.

But Alexander caught her wrist gently, pulling her back. "Sit down. Let me handle it."

Without waiting for a response, he strode into the kitchen and returned moments later with polished cutlery in hand.

His expression softened as he met her eyes. "No more cooking."

Evelyn blinked in confusion. "Why not?"

"You're pregnant," he said firmly. "I won't have you exhausting yourself for me."

Guilt gnawed at him. If he hadn't stormed out earlier in frustration, she wouldn’t have gone hungry for so long.

What kind of man was he?

His drive home had been plagued with doubts.

For a fleeting moment, he had even entertained Ethan’s claims.

Ethan’s unwavering confidence had planted seeds of suspicion—was the child truly his?

But then he watched Evelyn move around the kitchen, preparing a meal just for him despite her condition.

The sight shattered his doubts.

How could he ever question her?

His fingers tightened around the silverware as he set the table, his thoughts a whirlwind of regret and resolve.

He wouldn’t let Ethan’s poisonous words taint what they had.

Not now.

Not ever.

Evelyn deserved better.

And he would prove it.

Trust was supposed to be the foundation of marriage.

How could Alexander have let Ethan manipulate him so easily?

But those photos…

Alexander's voice was low. "Evelyn, I left because I received something."

Her grip tightened around the fork. "What was it?"

"Photos of you and Ethan."

Her stomach twisted. "Show them to me."

"They're gone now. But I remember every detail."

His words came out clipped. "The first one—you two holding hands outside the concert hall. The second—an embrace that looked far too intimate. The last…" His jaw clenched. "You were in bed together."

Evelyn's expression turned icy.

She hadn’t expected Ethan to stoop this low.

No wonder Alexander had stormed out.

Ethan had crafted the perfect trap—using fabricated evidence to make Alexander believe she had betrayed him.

The realization made her blood boil.

She met Alexander's gaze steadily. "None of that was real."

His eyes darkened with doubt. "Then explain it."

Evelyn set the fork down with deliberate calm. "Because I’m telling the truth."

Evelyn gazed into Alexander's eyes with desperate intensity. "Do you trust me?"

Her voice trembled as she continued, "For the past two weeks, I attended a concert with Ethan Caldwell—but only because I was trying to escape. I held his hand just to make him lower his guard. And I swear, nothing else happened between us! We never shared a bed, and there’s nothing between us now!"

Tears welled in her eyes as she whispered, "Alexander, please… believe me."

Her heart ached.

Never had she imagined she would one day have to defend her own innocence like this.

Alexander’s expression darkened with regret. He sank onto the couch beside her and pulled her into his arms.

"Evelyn, I’m sorry," he murmured, his voice rough with emotion. "I never should have doubted you. I hurt you, didn’t I?"

The pain of his suspicion cut deep.

Yet Evelyn knew the real culprit wasn’t Alexander—it was Ethan.

If he hadn’t kidnapped her, none of this would have happened.

A sob caught in her throat. Even wrapped in Alexander’s embrace, an icy dread settled in her chest.

Would this rift between them ever fully heal?

The dim lights of Eclipse Lounge flickered against the polished mahogany counter.

Alexander Whitmore leaned against the bar, his fingers tracing the rim of his whiskey glass.

Nathan Reeves sat beside him, nursing a drink of his own.

"You don't usually drink this much," Nathan remarked, eyeing his boss carefully.

Alexander smirked, the amber liquid swirling as he tilted the glass.

"Men only drink like this when they're either celebrating or drowning their sorrows."

Nathan raised a brow. "Which one is it for you?"

A bitter chuckle escaped Alexander's lips.

"Neither. I'm just tired."

The weight of the past few weeks pressed down on him—Evelyn's absence, the relentless corporate battles, the whispers behind his back.

Across the room, Lucas Bennett lounged in a booth, laughing with a group of women.

Nathan followed Alexander's gaze.

"Lucas seems to be enjoying himself."

Alexander took another sip, the burn of alcohol doing little to numb his thoughts.

"Lucas always knows how to forget."

A silence settled between them, heavy with unspoken words.

Then, Nathan spoke carefully.

"Have you heard from Evelyn?"

Alexander's grip tightened around his glass.

"No."

The single word carried more pain than he cared to admit.

Nathan exhaled. "You should talk to her."

"And say what?" Alexander's voice was sharp. "That I miss her? That I regret everything?"

Nathan didn't flinch. "If that's the truth."

Alexander downed the rest of his drink in one swift motion.

"The truth doesn't change anything."

The bartender slid another glass toward him, but Alexander pushed it away.

He stood abruptly, the stool scraping against the floor.

"I'm done for the night."

Nathan watched as Alexander strode toward the exit, his silhouette swallowed by the shadows outside.

Lucas glanced up, frowning as the door swung shut.

"Where's he going?"

Nathan sighed.

"Somewhere he thinks he can outrun his thoughts."

Lucas shook his head.

"Good luck with that."

Outside, the cold night air hit Alexander like a slap.

He pulled out his phone, thumb hovering over Evelyn's contact.

But he didn't call.

Instead, he shoved it back into his pocket and walked away.

Some battles couldn't be won with words.

And some wounds never truly healed.

Men only reached for alcohol when their hearts were heavy, wasn't that the universal truth?

The amber liquid swirled in Alexander Whitmore's crystal tumbler, catching the dim light of Eclipse Lounge. His usually sharp emerald eyes were clouded, his jaw clenched tight enough to crack stone.

Across from him, Lucas Bennett leaned against the leather booth, watching his oldest friend with concern. "You're drinking like a man who lost everything. What happened?"

Alexander downed the whiskey in one burning gulp. "Evelyn thinks I betrayed her."

Lucas nearly choked on his gin. "What? That's impossible. You'd rather cut off your own arm than hurt her."

A bitter laugh escaped Alexander's lips. "Tell that to the surveillance footage Vanessa doctored." His fist slammed against the mahogany table, making the glasses tremble. "She's convinced I'm working with Ethan again."

The name of Evelyn's treacherous ex-fiancé hung between them like a poisonous fog. Lucas whistled low. "That witch never stops, does she? First the fake pregnancy claims, now this?"

Ice clinked as Alexander refilled his glass. "I confronted her at Horizon Enterprises today. She looked at me like I was a stranger." The pain in his voice could've shattered diamonds.

"Then make her see the truth," Lucas insisted, snatching the bottle away. "You didn't survive prison and rebuild Titan Capital just to lose her over some fabricated evidence."

Alexander's phone buzzed with a security alert. His breath caught—Evelyn had just entered their penthouse at Willowbrook Apartments. Alone.

Lucas saw the change in his expression. "Go. Before she packs her bags."

The tumbler hit the table with finality. Alexander's chair screeched as he stood, resolve hardening his features. "This ends tonight."

Outside, rain began to fall as he sped through Cresthaven's glittering streets. The storm mirrored the tempest in his chest—one that would either drown them both or cleanse every lie between them.

Somewhere in the downpour, Vanessa Hart smiled at her flawless manicure, unaware her house of cards was about to collapse.

###Chapter 444 The Gestational Age

The clock ticked loudly in the silent bedroom. Evelyn Carter lay awake, her gaze fixed on the ceiling. Sleep refused to come.

Alexander Whitmore stumbled home well past midnight, the scent of whiskey clinging to him. Hearing the front door close, Evelyn quickly shut her eyes, feigning sleep.

The shower ran briefly before the mattress dipped under his weight. Warm arms encircled her waist, pulling her flush against his chest.

"You're not asleep," Alexander murmured into her hair, his breath warm against her skin.

Evelyn exhaled softly. "Lucas finalized his divorce from Claire today. He needed someone to drink with." His heartbeat steadied her nerves.

She turned slightly, fingers brushing the hollow of his throat. "Alexander...would you come with me tomorrow? For the prenatal check-up?"

The question hung between them. Evelyn wondered if he truly believed her excuses about those damning photos.

Claire's words echoed in her mind—A child is the strongest bond.

Tonight, she would use that bond to mend what was broken.

The drowsiness still clung to her when she sensed his rage.

He stood on the balcony, clad in black silk pajamas, one hand buried in his pocket. Evelyn couldn’t hear who he was speaking to, but the tension in his posture was unmistakable.

From across the room, she could tell the caller wasn’t delivering good news. Alexander’s expression darkened with every word, his jaw tightening.

Who dared speak to him like that?

Just as she was about to call out, his voice cut through the silence like a blade.

"He deserved it."

The call ended abruptly.

Evelyn sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. "What’s wrong?"

Alexander exhaled sharply.

"Ethan has three broken ribs."

Her breath hitched.

"I did it last night."

Her mind raced.

Had he left their home just to confront Ethan at the hospital?

Her gaze dropped to his hands. "Are you hurt?"

A scoff. "Him? Please."

He tossed his phone onto the bed and stalked into the bathroom without another word.

Evelyn’s fingers curled into the sheets.

If Alexander had gone that far, this wasn’t over.

Not by a long shot.

The ultrasound room was quiet except for the steady beeping of the machine. Evelyn lay on the examination table, her fingers lightly tracing the curve of her belly. Alexander stood beside her, his phone buzzing insistently in his pocket.

Halfway through the scan, it rang again.

The voice on the other end was unmistakably Vincent, sharp with accusation.

"He’s still your nephew, Alexander! Blood ties mean nothing to you? If anything happens to Ethan because of you, I swear I’ll make you pay—even if it costs me everything!"

Alexander’s lips curled into a cold smirk. "Still running to Father when you can’t handle things yourself? Pathetic."

He didn’t wait for a response, ending the call with a tap of his finger.

Evelyn’s voice was soft. "Should we check on him?"

Alexander shook his head. "He’ll live."

Three broken ribs—that was mercy. Ethan had earned far worse for what he’d done.

Once the scan was complete, Evelyn took the reports to the doctor. The woman studied the images, then frowned slightly.

"The baby’s measurements are about two weeks behind." She pointed to a small shadow on the screen. "Are you certain about the conception date?"

Evelyn nodded. "Positive."

"That's unusual." Alexander's brow furrowed as he studied the report again. "The measurements indicate it's two weeks smaller than expected."

His fingers tapped lightly against the edge of the desk, a habit he had when deep in thought.

Evelyn bit her lip, her hands instinctively resting on her stomach. "Is something wrong?"

Alexander shook his head, though his expression remained thoughtful. "Not necessarily. It could simply be because you're underweight. Your body needs more nutrients to support the baby's growth."

He reached across the desk, his warm fingers brushing against hers. "We'll adjust your diet. More protein, more healthy fats. Let's see if we can close that gap in the next few weeks."

Evelyn exhaled slowly, some of the tension leaving her shoulders. "I'll eat whatever you recommend."

A small smile tugged at Alexander's lips. "Good. Because I'm putting Simon on grocery duty. He'll make sure our kitchen is stocked with everything you need."

The image of Simon Graves, Alexander's usually stern assistant, pushing a cart through the organic produce section almost made her laugh. Almost.

Because beneath the momentary relief, a quiet worry still lingered.

Two weeks.

What if it wasn't just about her weight?

###Chapter 445 The Tragic End of Eleanor

The moment Evelyn and Alexander stepped out of the physician's office, his phone buzzed urgently.

This time, it was Harold. His voice was sharp, demanding. "Did you break Ethan's ribs? Where are you? Get here immediately!"

He rarely spoke to Alexander with such severity. Evelyn's pulse quickened, her worried gaze flickering toward him.

If this wasn't handled flawlessly, Alexander could be branded as heartless toward his own kin.

He ended the call and turned to her. "Let me take you home first."

"No." Evelyn tightened her grip on his arm. "I'm staying with you."

Her voice softened but held resolve. "We're partners. Whatever trouble comes, we face it together. Don't shut me out."

After a brief hesitation, he nodded.

Before they even reached the hospital room, Eleanor's sobs echoed down the hallway.

She had always been composed. This raw, unchecked grief was unlike her.

"His surgery was just yesterday. He was supposed to recover. But now—three ribs shattered—" Her voice cracked.

The weight of the situation pressed down on them both.

The moment Alexander departed yesterday, the medical team fought desperately to stabilize Ethan.

His injuries were severe, life-threatening.

Dawn broke. Ethan remained unconscious, his body connected to countless machines in the ICU. The prognosis was uncertain.

When Alexander entered the hospital room, Eleanor charged at him like a storm.

"How could you do this to Ethan? Even if you deny him as family, he's still a human being!" Her voice shook with fury. "He nearly died saving Evelyn, and this is how you repay him? What kind of monster are you?"

The accusations poured out like acid. Harold's expression darkened instantly.

This level of public confrontation was unprecedented in their family.

Vincent sneered, "Just like his mother—utterly heartless."

Alexander's gaze snapped to Vincent, sharp as a blade.

Vincent immediately regretted his words, but with Ethan's life hanging by a thread, his usual restraint had shattered.

Alexander appeared unaffected.

With glacial calm, he guided Evelyn to the sofa, handed her a paper cup of water, then turned his full attention to Vincent.

The air thickened with tension.

Evelyn's fingers trembled around the cup. She could feel the storm brewing beneath Alexander's controlled exterior.

Vincent swallowed hard but held his ground.

Harold stepped forward, his voice cutting through the tension. "Enough. This isn't the time for accusations."

Alexander's lips curved into a humorless smile. His next words would change everything.

"Alexander!" Harold's voice cut through the tension, his brows furrowing deeply. "How can you speak of your own mother that way?"

"Am I wrong?" Alexander's voice was icy, his jaw clenched. "Isn't that exactly what you believed? That's why you shipped me off to the countryside and pretended I didn’t exist."

The mention of his childhood made Harold stiffen.

His shoulders sagged as if the weight of years had suddenly crashed down on him. Seated in his wheelchair, he opened his mouth—then closed it again, silent. Painful memories flickered behind his eyes.

Beside him, Evelyn studied them both carefully.

She knew Harold had been married three times, the first two ending in swift divorces. But Alexander’s mother—she had died mere days after giving birth.

A postpartum hemorrhage.

The rumors had always been vicious. People whispered that Harold resented the child whose birth had taken his wife’s life, that he couldn’t bear to look at Alexander, so he exiled him from the Whitmore family.

Yet something about it didn’t sit right with Evelyn.

There was more to this story.

She could feel it.

###Chapter 446 What a Child!

Vincent quickly steered the conversation back on track.

"Harold, we must seek justice for Ethan! The doctors confirmed he has lasting injuries. He's just a boy! Alexander can't abuse his authority as family head to brutalize him like this!"

Harold seemed lost in thought, barely registering Vincent's words.

"Harold!" Vincent raised his voice sharply.

The older man finally stirred, waving a dismissive hand. "I'm exhausted. Handle this mess yourself."

"Harold!" Vincent's jaw dropped in disbelief.

This was a complete reversal. Just hours ago, Harold had been livid upon learning three of Ethan's ribs were fractured. What changed? Had Alexander's mention of his late mother triggered something?

Did Harold still carry that old guilt?

Alexander's mocking laughter cut through the tension. "Vincent, you keep accusing me of unjust punishment. Why don't you ask your precious stepson what he actually did? Ethan dared lay hands on my wife—kidnapped her like common trash. Harold, tell me—doesn't three broken ribs sound merciful?"

Eleanor gasped, paling at the public exposure of the scandal.

Harold's head snapped up. "Alexander, explain yourself."

Alexander Whitmore turned his piercing gaze toward Evelyn Carter.

He dared to lay hands on my wife.

"Besides breaking three of his ribs, I'm stripping him of the family name." His voice was ice. "Harold, what do you think?"

The implication was clear.

Harold Aniston understood—Alexander wouldn’t act without cause. But even he hadn’t expected Ethan Caldwell to abduct Evelyn.

Now it all made sense.

Alexander settled beside Evelyn, his arm wrapping protectively around her shoulders.

"Family matters should stay within the family," he said coldly. "No outsiders are present, and the rest of the relatives aren’t here. I was willing to show mercy—banishment abroad would’ve been enough. But since Vincent Black insists on playing judge, I’ll cut Ethan from the Anistons entirely."

Vincent paled.

He turned to Harold. "Father, Ethan is impulsive, but he must have had a reason for taking Evelyn!"

He had considered denying it, but the truth was too easily uncovered. Harold wasn’t a fool.

Alexander scoffed. "Impulsive? He’s nearly thirty. What kind of child does that?"

Vincent’s jaw tightened. "Maybe Evelyn led him on!"

Evelyn’s eyes flashed. "Excuse me? I seduced him?" Her voice dripped with disbelief. "He knocked me out cold in the hospital and held me captive for over twenty days. The surveillance footage—"

"Do you want me to produce evidence?"

Evelyn was stunned by how shamelessly Vincent, Alexander’s eldest brother, could twist the truth at his age.

He scoffed, refusing to back down. "Harold watched Ethan grow up. He knows Ethan better than anyone! What can some surveillance footage prove? Even if he did tie you up, do you really think you’re completely innocent?"

His absurd logic only fueled Evelyn’s fury.

Alexander placed a steadying hand on her shoulder and shot Vincent a chilling glare. "Is the footage not enough to prove Ethan’s guilt, or are you just choosing to ignore it?"

Vincent’s face darkened. "You—! Alexander, I’m your elder brother. How dare you speak to me like that?"

Harold had been silent for a long while. Ever since Alexander mentioned his late mother, his expression had grown distant.

Now, as his two sons continued to argue, he finally struck his cane against the floor.

"Enough!" His voice cut through the tension. "Alexander, Ethan is still fighting for his life in the ICU. Whatever grievances you have against him, he’s already paid the price."

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After Prison (Evelyn)

###Chapter 447 Evelyn's Deepest Fear

"You shattered three of his ribs. Isn't that enough? Or do you intend to drive him out of the family entirely? He's still your nephew, Alexander. Do you want him dead? Let this go. For everyone's sake."

Harold's voice was firm, his expression unreadable. He knew the scandal would be catastrophic if word spread.

Alexander clenched his fists, ready to argue, but Evelyn's fingers curled gently around his wrist. A silent plea. Not now.

Ethan lay in the ICU, ribs fractured, old wounds reopened. If Alexander pushed for his expulsion now, Evelyn feared Vincent would retaliate. And she couldn't bear the thought of Alexander in danger.

Outside the hospital, the evening air was cool. Alexander hesitated, his gaze heavy with unspoken words. Evelyn understood.

"Alexander," she whispered, stepping closer. "What happened to me doesn’t matter. Only you do."

She would endure anything—humiliation, pain—if it meant keeping him safe. He was everything.

He pulled her into his arms, his breath warm against her skin. "I won’t let him near you again."

His voice was a vow, dark and unyielding. And Evelyn believed him.

Alexander's warm breath tickled Evelyn's neck, sending shivers down her spine. She instinctively leaned into him, craving his closeness.

"Alexander, all I want is to focus on my health and our baby." Her voice trembled slightly. "But I'm terrified—what if Ethan and Vincent go too far? What if they hurt our child?"

That was her greatest fear.

Alexander's hand rested protectively over her stomach, his touch gentle yet firm. "They wouldn't dare. If they even try, I'll make sure they suffer for it."

Later that evening, Evelyn returned to Hawthorne Estate for dinner. When Margaret heard about the twenty days Evelyn had been trapped with Ethan, her face darkened with fury.

"What kind of monster is Ethan? First, he betrays you, then regrets it and tries to win you back—only to turn around and do this?" Margaret's hands clenched into fists. "Locking you up for weeks? If word gets out, your reputation could be ruined!"

She hesitated, then lowered her voice. "And Alexander… how is he handling this? Is he angry?"

Margaret's concern was obvious—she feared Alexander might blame Evelyn. Being held captive by an ex-fiancé was the kind of scandal that could breed distrust.

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "Alexander knows the truth. He hasn't blamed me at all."

Margaret exhaled in relief. "Good. He's a good man."

As someone who had been through it all, Margaret had wisdom to spare. Looking back at her own life, she saw the signs of Richard’s betrayal clearly now. If he had been faithful, Vanessa wouldn’t even exist.

Evelyn noticed Richard’s prolonged absence and frowned. "Has Dad been avoiding us lately?"

Margaret shrugged, her voice steady. "I don’t know where he is, and frankly, I don’t care. If anything happens to him, the estate remains ours. Men can be so childish—refusing to divorce just to prolong the misery."

Just as the words left her lips, a sharp knock echoed through the room, cutting their conversation short.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love After Prison (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 448 Not for Sale

The servant opened the door to find a stranger standing on the doorstep.

"Who are you?" the servant asked, frowning in confusion.

The man adjusted his tie. "I'm from Horizon Realty. Mr. Hayes has instructed us to list this property for sale."

At those words, Margaret shot up from the sofa, her face paling.

"What did you just say? Has Richard lost his mind? This is the Hayes family estate! He can't possibly sell it!" she cried, her voice trembling with outrage.

Evelyn’s mind raced. And the deed is still in my name.

The agent remained unfazed, as if he had expected this reaction. "Mr. Hayes stated he owns fifty percent of the property and intends to sell his portion."

Margaret was rendered speechless, her hands clenching into fists.

Evelyn understood immediately—this was Richard’s way of forcing Margaret’s hand.

For weeks, he had humbled himself, reaching out repeatedly, only to be met with cold rejection. Now, he was flipping the game, taking control of the situation in the most ruthless way possible.

Evelyn stepped forward, her voice firm. "You can leave. This house isn’t for sale."

The agent hesitated, but one look at Evelyn’s icy glare made him retreat without another word.

As the door closed, Margaret turned to Evelyn, her eyes wide with panic. "What is he thinking?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "He’s making sure you have no choice but to talk to him."

Margaret sank back onto the sofa, her expression a mix of fury and dread.

Richard had just declared war.

The first call went unanswered.

It wasn’t until the third attempt—made by Margaret Hayes with icy determination—that Richard Hayes finally deigned to pick up, his tone dripping with lazy indifference.

His voice crackled through the speaker, laced with impatience.

"What do you want? Make it quick. I’m busy."

In the background, the unmistakable clatter of poker chips and muffled laughter painted a vivid picture of where he was.

Evelyn Carter could practically see the smirk twisting his lips, the arrogant tilt of his chin.

So, in just twenty days, he’s gone from groveling to outright defiance.

Margaret cut straight to the point.

"Richard, what the hell are you doing? Selling the house?"

His reply was infuriatingly calm.

"Aren’t you filing for divorce? Assets get divided. That’s how it works."

"But the deed is still in Evelyn’s name."

"Everything under the Hayes name belongs to me. What difference does it make if she’s holding the papers?"

Margaret’s fingers tightened around the phone.

After nearly three decades of marriage, she was finally seeing him for what he truly was—a man without shame.

Evelyn exchanged a glance with her mother before smoothly taking over the conversation.

The air in the room grew thick with tension as Evelyn leaned forward, her gaze sharp as a blade.

"If we're discussing selling assets to divide the estate, then Horizon Enterprises is half my mother's as well. Why don't we put that on the market too?"

Her voice was calm, but the challenge in her words was unmistakable.

"Alexander mentioned just yesterday that there aren't many solid investment opportunities available right now. Horizon Enterprises, however, is a stable venture. I’ll speak with him—I’m sure he’d be willing to make a fair offer. After all, it’s all in the family."

Richard Hayes froze. He hadn’t anticipated this move from his daughter.

A storm of fury darkened his expression.

"You ungrateful child!" he spat, his voice trembling with rage. "You’ve truly turned your back on your own blood since marrying into the Whitmore family! Now you’d hand over the company too? How could you betray your grandfather’s memory like this? He adored you!"

Evelyn’s response was ice-cold, her tone devoid of warmth.

"Don’t use Grandfather to manipulate me. If he were here, he’d be confronting you first. If you can sell Hawthorne Estate, then Horizon Enterprises is just as fair game."

The words struck like a whip, leaving Richard momentarily speechless.

His original plan had been simple—use the sale of the family estate as leverage to pressure Margaret, to make her reconsider the divorce.

But Evelyn had dismantled his strategy effortlessly, turning his own weapon against him.

The silence that followed was heavy, charged with the weight of unspoken battles yet to come.

"Evelyn, you need to come home. We're waiting for you."

The call ended abruptly, leaving Evelyn Carter standing frozen in place.

Margaret Hayes studied her daughter's tense expression. "Tell me the truth—have you truly decided to go through with the divorce?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw, the betrayal still raw. Richard's secret affairs. Evelyn Sinclair's unforgivable act of swapping her child.

The damage was irreversible.

But after the initial storm of anger, logic crept in.

If I divorce him, it might soothe my pride. But what then? Richard marries Evelyn Sinclair, and I hand them everything on a silver platter?

It was like toiling under the sun only for someone else to reap the harvest.

Why should I give them that satisfaction?

Nearly three decades of marriage had bound their lives together—families, businesses, reputations. A divorce wouldn't just shatter them—it would send shockwaves through Horizon Enterprises and Titan Capital Group alike.

The cost outweighed the fleeting relief of walking away.

Margaret watched the silent battle play out across Evelyn's face and understood. Some wars weren't fought with exits, but with staying power.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance After the Fall (Evelyn Carter)

###Chapter 449 Unexpected

The silence stretched between them after that. Moments later, Richard returned, but what shocked everyone was the sight of Vanessa trailing behind him.

Margaret's face darkened the instant she spotted Vanessa.

"Richard, explain yourself. I asked you to come back so we could talk things through. Why did you bring her?"

Vanessa's eyes welled up as she gazed at Margaret with a wounded expression. She stepped forward, fingers curling gently around Margaret's sleeve.

"Mom... even if I'm not your real daughter, doesn't the love we shared all these years mean anything? Twenty years of calling you 'Mom'—was it all for nothing? How can you act like you don’t want to see me?"

She buried her face against Margaret’s shoulder, her quiet sobs trembling through her.

Margaret’s expression softened slightly. She could unleash her fury on Richard without hesitation, but when it came to Vanessa—especially now, with her pregnancy—she couldn’t bring herself to be cruel.

For two decades, Margaret had cherished Vanessa like a priceless treasure, loving her as fiercely as if she were her own flesh and blood.

The bond between them was real. The only reason Margaret had grown distant was the crushing realization that the daughter she’d raised had never truly been on her side.

"Evelyn Sinclair." My lips curled in disgust just saying her name. "I despise her as much as you do. That’s why I’m begging you—please don’t divorce Dad."

Margaret Hayes froze, completely unprepared for Vanessa Hart’s plea for reconciliation.

She had assumed that since Evelyn was Vanessa’s biological mother, her daughter would naturally side with her.

"Mom, no matter what happens, you’ll always be my mother." Vanessa’s voice trembled with emotion. "I could never turn my back on you. All I want is for you and Dad to be happy together."

It seemed Vanessa wasn’t as close to Evelyn as Margaret had feared.

After all, who would willingly embrace the truth that their birth mother was a homewrecker?

And now, with the scandal exposed, it was nothing but shameful.

Margaret’s expression remained cold. "Don’t think a few sweet words will make me forget everything. You’ve already taken everything from this family. The only thing left for me is to make things right for Evelyn."

Richard Hayes’ face darkened at her words.

"What has Vanessa ever done wrong?" His voice was sharp with frustration. "She was just a child back then. She had no part in this. If you want to blame someone, Margaret, blame Evelyn—not Vanessa! And she’s pregnant now. She can’t handle this kind of stress!"

The tension in the room thickened, suffocating.

Vanessa’s eyes welled with tears, her hands instinctively resting on her stomach.

Margaret’s jaw tightened, but she didn’t back down.

"Pregnancy doesn’t erase the past, Richard." Her voice was icy. "And it doesn’t change the fact that Evelyn is the one who deserves justice."

A heavy silence fell.

Vanessa swallowed hard, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Mom… please."

But Margaret had already turned away.

The battle lines were drawn.

And this time, there would be no forgiveness.

"You haven't shown her even an ounce of concern!" Margaret snapped, stepping protectively in front of Evelyn.

Her words struck Richard and Vanessa like a physical blow, their expressions freezing in shock.

Their eyes immediately dropped to Evelyn's stomach. "Evelyn... you're pregnant?"

Evelyn hadn't planned to share the news yet, but now that Margaret had revealed it, there was no point in denying it.

"Yes. It's still very early," she answered calmly.

A flicker of envy crossed Vanessa's face before she could hide it.

This wasn't supposed to happen.

She had just discovered her own pregnancy, and now Evelyn was expecting too.

While Vanessa's relationship with Ethan was crumbling, Evelyn seemed to have everything—a stable marriage, a loving husband, and now a child on the way.

Margaret redirected the conversation sharply. "Richard, if you refuse to divorce, fine. But I have conditions."

Richard swallowed hard. "What conditions?"

Margaret had considered demanding he cut all contact with Evelyn Sinclair.

Margaret's fingers tightened around her purse strap as she considered her next move. The air between them crackled with tension.

After a brief pause that felt like an eternity, she revised her demand sharply. "Every penny you've wasted on Evelyn Sinclair during our marriage belongs to our joint assets. I want it all back—down to the last cent!"

Richard froze, his face draining of color. His mouth opened slightly but no words came out.

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken accusations.

Margaret held her ground, her gaze unflinching. She could see the calculations running through his mind—the years of hidden expenses, the secret bank transfers, all laid bare now.

Across the room, a clock ticked loudly, marking the seconds of his stunned hesitation.

Then Richard's shoulders slumped in defeat. The truth was undeniable, and they both knew it.

###Chapter 450 No Laughing Matter

The request didn’t faze Richard in the slightest. He agreed without missing a beat.

Vanessa’s stomach twisted with unease for Evelyn Sinclair.

Evelyn’s floral boutique had been funded entirely by Richard—a modest investment of a few hundred thousand. But that was just the beginning.

The real assets at stake were the properties, luxury cars, and stock portfolios. Combined, they were worth tens of millions. If Margaret demanded it all back, Evelyn would be left with nothing.

For years, Evelyn had been more than just Richard’s companion—she had shared his bed, his table, his life. Now, she stood to lose even the roof over her head, let alone the lavish lifestyle she had grown accustomed to. Margaret was determined to claw back every penny Richard had ever spent on her.

Vanessa had expected Richard to hesitate, to deliberate. But he had agreed instantly, without so much as a flicker of doubt.

Her breath caught in her throat.

As much as she wanted to intervene, Vanessa couldn’t. Not now. She was playing her own game, currying favor with Margaret for her own ambitions. Defending Evelyn wasn’t an option.

The moment Richard gave his answer, Margaret’s sharp gaze slid toward Vanessa.

The tension in the room was suffocating.

Margaret's voice was ice-cold. "You want us to get along? Fine. But my second condition is that you sever all ties with Evelyn Sinclair. Do that, and you’ll still be my daughter."

Vanessa stiffened, caught off guard.

She had walked right into this trap. If she refused now, it would prove to Margaret that her earlier promises were nothing but empty words.

Years of living under Margaret’s roof had taught Vanessa one thing—this ultimatum didn’t come from her mother alone.

Her gaze flickered toward Evelyn.

This has to be Evelyn’s doing.

What a calculated move.

In the end, both Richard and Vanessa agreed.

They knew the Hayes family wielded considerable influence. If Margaret pushed for divorce, Horizon Enterprises' stock would crash, and chaos would follow.

But then, Margaret did something even more shocking.

She snatched Richard’s phone from his hand, scrolled through his contacts, and tapped Evelyn’s name.

"Since you’ve both agreed, let’s make it official. Call Evelyn now and end it—right in front of me."

Her tone left no room for argument.

Margaret's voice turned sharp. "In private? So you can sneak around with her? Richard, are you trying to have it both ways?"

Her words left Richard utterly speechless.

By the time the argument died down, Evelyn Sinclair's call had already connected, her sickly sweet voice dripping through the speaker. "Richard, what's wrong?"

Margaret jabbed Richard in the ribs, urging him to stop hesitating and get to the point.

Richard finally spoke, his tone icy. "Evelyn, we're done. I'm short on funds, so I need you to return everything I ever spent on you."

Evelyn went silent, as if she couldn’t believe her ears. "Excuse me? What did you just say?"

"The penthouse. The jewelry. The investments. All of it was marital assets between Margaret and me."

His voice was steel. "If you refuse, we’ll take legal action. You’ll be forced to return every last cent."

There was no humor in his words—only cold, hard finality. Evelyn was stunned into silence.

Nearly thirty seconds passed before she finally choked out a response, her voice trembling. "Richard… what about all the years I gave you?"

Without an ounce of shame, Richard scoffed. "What exactly did you give me?"

"My prime years, my devotion, my very soul—Richard, you can't discard me like yesterday's news!" she sobbed, her voice cracking with raw emotion.

Richard Hayes remained unmoved, his tone glacial. "You offered those willingly, didn't I compensate you generously in return? Evelyn, let's end this with dignity."

Margaret Hayes felt the ground tilt beneath her.

Her mind reeled. Twelve years. Twelve years of standing by him through bankruptcies and betrayals. I bore his heir. And now he dares to itemize every penny he ever spent on me?

The line went dead before Evelyn Sinclair could retaliate.

Vanessa Hart's phone lit up ninety seconds later.

The moment Vanessa saw Evelyn Sinclair's name flash on her screen, her stomach twisted.

She wanted to ignore it.

But Margaret Hayes' piercing stare left her no choice. With trembling fingers, she answered.

"Vanessa!" Evelyn's voice was raw, choked with tears. "Your father—he's cutting me off completely! He's demanding I return every penny! You have to help me!"

Her shrill voice carried so clearly that even without speakerphone, everyone in the room heard every word.

She clearly had no idea they were all gathered together.

Under Margaret's unrelenting gaze, Vanessa forced the words out. "There's something I need to say too. I was raised by the Hayes family. I can't accept that my real mother destroyed someone else's marriage. We should end this."

Silence. Then—

"How could you?" Evelyn's voice cracked. "You're my daughter! My own flesh and blood!"

A sharp inhale. "This is Margaret's doing, isn't it?"

"No!" Vanessa's reply came too fast. "This is my choice!"

Evelyn's breath hitched—the sound of a woman unraveling.

"Is all my devotion going to end up meaning nothing?"

Margaret felt a rush of satisfaction. This was just the start. She was determined to make Evelyn and Richard suffer the same torment she had endured!

In the past, Margaret had always yielded to Richard's every word, but now the power dynamics in their household had completely reversed.

Later that afternoon, as Evelyn was leaving, Vanessa rushed after her.

"Two incredible men fighting over you! Ethan nearly got thrown out of Whitmore Manor by Alexander. Evelyn, do you really think you're that irresistible?" Vanessa sneered.

Evelyn turned, deliberately taunting her with a smirk. "Yes, I do."

Vanessa's eyes burned with fury as she gripped Evelyn's wrist. "You stayed with Ethan in that estate for so long. Did you two sleep together?"

The question had haunted Vanessa for days. The mere thought of her beloved Ethan being intimate with Evelyn was driving her to the edge of insanity.

Evelyn frowned in irritation. "I'm not like you. I have self-respect. Besides, I lost interest in Ethan a long time ago."

Vanessa's composure shattered. "Two people alone in that house—don't lie to me!"

Evelyn yanked her wrist free. "Believe what you want. It doesn't change the fact that he chose me over you—twice."

Vanessa's breath hitched. The truth was a knife twisting in her chest.

Evelyn leaned in, voice low. "And if you ever lay a hand on me again, I won't be so forgiving."

With that, she walked away, leaving Vanessa trembling with rage.

The game had only just begun.

The crisp autumn air did nothing to ease the tension between them.

Vanessa's grip on Evelyn's wrist tightened, her manicured nails digging into flesh. "What the hell happened? Evelyn, why are you doing this to me?" Her voice trembled with barely contained fury. "You're already married to Alexander. Why do you have to steal my man?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her patience wearing thin.

"And those photos!" Vanessa continued, her eyes wild. "If there was nothing between you two, explain those!"

A cold smirk curled Evelyn's lips. "Your man is your problem. You're the only one who thinks he's worth fighting over."

She had no interest in continuing this pointless argument. With a sharp twist, Evelyn freed herself from Vanessa's grasp and turned to leave.

But then—

"That baby you're carrying," Vanessa spat, venom dripping from every word. "Is it really Alexander's... or Ethan's?"

The accusation hung in the air like poison.

Just yesterday, Vanessa had overheard Ethan and Alexander in a heated argument—Ethan claiming the child was his.

Evelyn's jaw clenched. "You're delusional."

Vanessa let out a bitter laugh. "Think you've won? This isn't over, Evelyn. Until the very end, we'll see who comes out on top."

Without another word, Vanessa stormed to her car, slamming the door behind her.

Evelyn watched her for a long moment before stepping into her own vehicle, her fingers tightening around the steering wheel.

The game wasn't over.

But neither was she.

Vanessa slammed her foot on the accelerator, her car roaring past Evelyn's with a burst of speed.

The tires screeched as she cut sharply in front of Evelyn's vehicle, then slammed on the brakes without warning.

Evelyn's heart lurched into her throat.

The impact was sudden, brutal.

Metal crunched. Glass shattered.

For one terrifying second, Evelyn's world went white.

Her hands clenched the steering wheel, knuckles bone-white.

This was no accident.

Vanessa had done this on purpose.

The realization hit her like a second collision.

Her stepsister had just tried to kill her.

###Chapter 452 She Brought This Upon Herself

Vanessa abruptly reduced her speed, catching Evelyn completely off guard. Even with slamming on the brakes, Evelyn's car still crashed into Vanessa's.

Her first thought was, Has she lost her mind? If she wants to end herself, why involve me?

Once the initial shock faded, Evelyn stepped out of her car and approached Vanessa's window, rapping sharply on the glass.

The window rolled down, revealing Vanessa's ghostly pale face. Then Evelyn noticed the blood smeared across the leather seats.

Vanessa slumped back against the headrest, her breathing shallow. Evelyn's eyes widened. "The dashcam recorded everything. This was your doing—don't even think of blaming me," she snapped.

"My baby—" Vanessa gasped, her fingers tightening around Evelyn's wrist. "Please... call an ambulance."

Evelyn was speechless. How could Vanessa be so reckless? Despite their enmity, the child was innocent. It was unthinkable that she would endanger her own baby just to frame her.

Vanessa had acted in blind fury, swerving in front of Evelyn's car without considering the consequences.

Now, the searing pain and the blood terrified her. Her pregnancy had been fragile from the start—frequent hospital visits, doctors insisting on bed rest.

And now, this.

All because of her own recklessness.

The situation couldn't have been worse.

A minor collision had triggered severe bleeding. Vanessa had been feeling discomfort in her abdomen for days, though the cause remained unclear.

Regret washed over her in waves. She had only meant to frighten Evelyn, not cause an actual accident. Now, she was the one suffering the consequences.

Her gaze locked onto Evelyn, bitterness rising in her throat.

Why was Evelyn completely unharmed while she was in agony?

The crash had occurred near the Hawthorne Estate. Hearing the commotion, Richard and Margaret rushed outside.

Richard took one look at the scene and immediately lashed out at Evelyn. "What were you thinking? We were just inside trying to smooth things over, and now you ram into Vanessa?"

"Calm down!" Margaret snapped, shooting Richard a sharp glare. "My daughter is pregnant! If you upset her, I swear you'll regret it! And how do you know Evelyn did this on purpose?"

Richard's stomach twisted with worry.

Vanessa was carrying the child of one of Cresthaven's most powerful families—a potential heir to billions.

Her position in the Caldwell family was already precarious. This baby was her only lifeline, her only guarantee of security.

If anything happened to it, all her scheming would be for nothing.

A cold dread slithered down his spine. "In a rear-end collision, the car behind is usually at fault!"

"Don't jump to conclusions," Margaret countered. "From where I'm standing, it looks like Vanessa swerved recklessly!"

As they argued, Vanessa clutched her stomach, her face pale.

"Stop fighting!" she gasped. "Can someone just take me to the hospital?"

Secret Longing: A Love Reborn After Betrayal...

###Chapter 453 Her Downfall

Richard drove Vanessa to the emergency room.

The moment they disappeared through the hospital doors, Margaret pulled Evelyn aside for inspection. "Sweetheart, are you injured anywhere?"

Evelyn rotated her wrists experimentally. "Nothing hurts."

"Thank heavens. Honestly, that girl's been practically living at the maternity ward trying to preserve that pregnancy. Nature has its ways - some things just aren't meant to be," Margaret remarked with brutal honesty.

Still, worry creased her forehead. "We should get you examined regardless. And shouldn't you inform Alexander about this?"

Evelyn's gaze drifted to the damaged vehicle parked nearby. The front bumper bore ugly scrapes where paint had been stripped away.

It was Alexander's prized sports car. He'd definitely want to know about the collision.

Alexander was chairing a quarterly earnings meeting when his phone lit up.

Normally, all notifications were muted during boardroom sessions - except for calls from Evelyn. The special ringtone pierced through the corporate discussion.

"Car accident?" His voice turned razor-sharp with alarm the second he answered. "Where are you hurt?"

The entire conference table fell silent as executives watched their CEO's face darken. Without hesitation, Alexander stood, signaling the meeting's abrupt end with a slash of his hand.

"Send me your location immediately," he commanded, already striding toward the exit. His assistant Simon scrambled to follow, nearly tripping over his own feet.

Back at the accident scene, Evelyn blinked at her suddenly silent phone. "He hung up before I could explain..."

Margaret arched an eyebrow. "That man moves faster than lightning when it concerns you."

Tires screeched before Evelyn could respond. A black luxury sedan skidded to a stop mere inches from the damaged vehicles, its tinted windows hiding the furious occupant within.

The driver's door flew open.

Alexander emerged like a storm given human form.

The dull ache in Evelyn's lower abdomen was barely noticeable. Aside from the occasional morning sickness that came with early pregnancy, she hardly felt like an expectant mother at all.

"That's a nasty scratch on your car. This must be worth a fortune, isn't it?"

She had chosen the sleekest, most luxurious vehicle from Alexander's garage that morning.

He responded with casual indifference. "Just a few million. No big deal."

Evelyn blinked, momentarily speechless.

"As long as you're unharmed, that's all that matters. I'm on my way now. Oh, and call the police—let them sort out liability," Alexander instructed.

She nodded and ended the call, only to find Margaret watching her with an amused smirk.

"What?" Evelyn asked, confused. Shouldn't Margaret be panicking after an accident? Why did she look so smug?

"I'm just pleased to see how much Alexander adores you," Margaret said, her smile widening. "The way he drops everything to rush to your side—that's how you know a man truly loves you."

She leaned in slightly, lowering her voice. "Alexander is a thousand times better than Ethan ever was. You're far luckier than Vanessa. Maybe this accident was fate's way of showing you that."

The police and Alexander arrived simultaneously.

After examining the crash site and vehicle damage, officers concluded both drivers bore equal fault.

"I believed you claimed to be unharmed?"

Alexander's brow furrowed as his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn's face.

During her abrupt braking, an object from the dashboard had struck her cheek, leaving a faint crimson trail.

She gnawed her lower lip, fingertips brushing the stinging wound.

Blood.

The injury sat just beyond her line of sight—she'd been oblivious until now.

"Merely a surface scratch. Trivial," Evelyn dismissed with forced lightness.

"Trivial?"

Alexander insisted on immediate medical attention, his tone brooking no argument.

Nearby, Margaret pressed a hand to her mouth, shoulders shaking with suppressed mirth.

Perfect timing, she sneered internally. Hurry along now—before nature stitches her up without your interference.

The late afternoon sun cast elongated shadows across the asphalt as Alexander guided Evelyn toward his car, his protective grip on her elbow tighter than necessary. Margaret lingered, watching their retreating figures with venomous satisfaction.

At the hospital's stark white reception, fluorescent lights highlighted Evelyn's pallor as a nurse dabbed antiseptic on her cheek. Alexander hovered like a storm cloud, his jaw clenched.

"All this fuss for nothing," Evelyn muttered, wincing at the sting.

The nurse smiled knowingly. "Better safe than sorry with facial wounds, dear."

Alexander's phone buzzed—a terse message from Simon about postponed meetings. He silenced it without glancing down.

Margaret's parting jab echoed in Evelyn's mind: Drama queen. She exhaled sharply. This minor scrape had somehow become another battlefield in their endless war.

As the nurse applied the final bandage, Evelyn caught Alexander studying her with an unreadable intensity. Something darker than concern flickered in those gunmetal-gray eyes.

Her stomach dropped.

This wasn't about the cut.

Something far worse was coming.

The car ride to the hospital was tense. When Alexander discovered Vanessa had intentionally swerved in front of Evelyn’s vehicle, his expression darkened like a gathering storm.

"What was she thinking?" His voice was razor-sharp.

Evelyn exhaled softly. "She was upset after our argument. It was just reckless impulse."

Meanwhile, Vincent and Eleanor rushed to the hospital upon hearing about Vanessa’s accident.

But by the time they arrived—delayed by the distance from Whitmore Manor—Vanessa had already finished her examination.

"How is she? Is the baby unharmed?" Eleanor demanded, her voice trembling.

Vanessa’s chest tightened.

Of course. The baby. That’s all anyone ever cared about. Not her pain. Not her fear. Just the precious heir inside her.

Richard, standing nearby, delivered the crushing verdict. "The doctor said the fetal heartbeat is unstable. It could stop at any moment."

Vanessa knew then—her fate was sealed.

###Chapter 454 He's the One Chasing After Me

Eleanor's expression turned stormy as she snapped, "Vanessa, what were you thinking? We arranged a driver for you! Why would you risk driving yourself in your condition?"

The entire family had placed their future ambitions on this unborn child. Now, those hopes lay shattered.

Vincent's face mirrored her fury. "How did this accident happen? Ethan just regained consciousness, and now we've lost the baby. Can you imagine how heartbroken he'll be?"

Having just returned from abroad, Vincent clearly wasn't aware of the full situation.

In reality, Ethan wasn't grieving at all. If anything, he was probably relieved.

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms. After such a catastrophe, someone had to shoulder the blame. She couldn't let them pin everything on her.

Her position in the Caldwell family was already precarious. If she became known as the woman who couldn't even protect her own pregnancy, she'd be utterly humiliated.

Vanessa quickly seized the narrative. "It was Evelyn! She was jealous that I was carrying Ethan's child, so she deliberately crashed into me! You have to make her pay for this!"

Eleanor's expression darkened at the news of the threatened miscarriage. When she learned the car accident might have been orchestrated by Evelyn, her fury knew no bounds.

She stormed across the hospital room, her heels clicking sharply against the tiled floor.

Within moments, Vanessa clutched her abdomen, her face contorted in pain. "Mom… it hurts so much…"

After a battery of tests, the doctor sighed. "I'm afraid it's too late. The pregnancy can't be saved."

His tone was clinical. "Given the advanced stage, medication won't suffice. We'll need to perform surgery."

Vanessa was wheeled away, tears streaking her cheeks. "My baby…"

Eleanor's rage burned white-hot. "First, they break three of Ethan's ribs, and now this? What kind of monsters are they?"

Vincent turned to Richard. "Richard, they're both your daughters. What do you propose we do?"

Richard's face was unreadable, but his jaw clenched as he watched Vanessa disappear behind the operating room doors.

He knew Vanessa's place in the Hayes family was precarious. If he didn't act decisively now, her future would be—

Richard Hayes crossed his arms, his expression unreadable. "We're all civilized people here. Naturally, I side with the victim in this situation."

"Evelyn has gone too far," Vincent Black interjected, his voice tight with anger. "Now that she has Alexander Whitmore backing her, she thinks she can act without consequences! How could she be so heartless toward her own stepsister?"

"A car accident!" Richard shook his head in disbelief. "We're talking about attempted murder here!"

With Richard's implicit approval, Vincent turned to Eleanor. "You need to call Evelyn. Now."

Just as Evelyn Carter stepped into the hospital lobby, her phone vibrated. Seeing Eleanor's name flash across the screen, her lips curled into a knowing smirk.

"Evelyn! Vanessa lost the baby because of you!" Eleanor's shrill voice pierced through the receiver the moment Evelyn answered. "I swear to God, you won't get away with this!"

"Is this still about Ethan Caldwell?" Evelyn's voice dripped with icy amusement. "Are you really so obsessed with your son's ex that you'd blame me for your own family's misfortune? How pathetically transparent."

The venom in Eleanor's voice intensified. "You're just jealous Vanessa was carrying Ethan's child! No wonder he left you - you're a monster! This is exactly what you deserve!"

Alexander was at the admissions desk handling paperwork when Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone. Her response came out in glacial syllables.

"Let me clarify something for you, Eleanor. It was Ethan who couldn't let go. Maybe you should ask yourself - was it really him who rejected me? Or was it me who threw him away like yesterday's trash?"

"Secondly, Vanessa lost her baby because of her own reckless behavior. As for your ridiculous accusation that I'm jealous of her—nothing could be further from the truth. I'm expecting my own child, after all."

Eleanor froze, her face paling as the words sank in.

"Whose child is it? Ethan's?"

Evelyn nearly rolled her eyes.

Do these people have no sense at all? Why does everyone assume it has to be Ethan's?

She scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain. "Ethan? Please. Do you honestly think he's worthy?"

Eleanor's composure shattered. "Evelyn, you will come here immediately! We are settling this right now!"

A cold smirk curved Evelyn's lips. "And why would I ever obey you?"

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After Prison (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 455 The Girl in the Photo

Evelyn didn’t waste another second thinking about Eleanor and ended the call abruptly.

When Alexander returned from completing her hospital registration, he immediately noticed the shift in her expression. "What happened? Did someone upset you?"

"Eleanor just called. Vanessa lost the baby," Evelyn replied flatly.

Alexander pieced it together instantly. "So she lashed out at you over the phone, trying to guilt-trip you?"

"Not exactly guilt. More like… amusement. It’s almost comical how they always flip the script to paint themselves as the victims, no matter who’s actually at fault."

"Don’t let it get to you. I’ll handle it."

Alexander guided Evelyn to the treatment room door, then lingered in the hallway to make a call.

Inside, Dr. Victoria Sinclair looked up in surprise when Evelyn entered. "You’re becoming quite the frequent visitor here, aren’t you?"

"Car accident. Just a scratch on my face," Evelyn answered briskly. "Dr. Sinclair, could you prescribe me some more of that ointment?"

The wound stung sharply, deep enough to draw blood.

Evelyn winced as the doctor cleaned it, but her attention snapped to Victoria Sinclair’s snide remark.

"You’re wasting medical resources," Victoria scoffed, her tone dripping with disdain. "I honestly don’t understand why Alexander would marry someone as insufferable as you."

Evelyn’s patience had already worn thin. Now, even the doctor was taking cheap shots at her for no reason.

She met Victoria’s gaze head-on, her voice icy.

"Do you have feelings for Alexander? Is that why you can’t stand me?"

A flicker of discomfort crossed Victoria’s face before she schooled her expression.

Evelyn didn’t let up. "But we’re already married, Dr. Sinclair. So, are you really trying to be the other woman?"

Victoria’s lips pressed into a tight line. "Watch your words! I only respect him professionally. I just think you two are completely mismatched!"

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "Mismatched? And who would be the perfect match, then? You?"

Victoria’s cheeks flushed, but she forced a smirk. "I did my research. Your marriage to Alexander—it was all you chasing after him, wasn’t it?"

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "And what’s wrong with a woman pursuing the man she loves?"

Back then, to protect Alexander’s reputation, it had been easier to let the world believe she was the one who had pursued him relentlessly.

Victoria’s eyes narrowed. "Women who chase men too desperately never end up being cherished."

Evelyn tilted her head, a slow, knowing smile curving her lips. "Funny. Alexander seems to cherish me just fine."

The words hung in the air, sharp as a blade.

Victoria’s grip on her clipboard tightened, but before she could retort, Evelyn stood, smoothing her skirt.

"Thanks for the patch-up, Doctor. But next time, save your opinions for someone who actually cares."

With that, she turned and walked out, leaving Victoria seething behind her.

The hospital corridor stretched ahead, but Evelyn’s mind was already elsewhere.

She had a husband to go home to.

And no bitter doctor’s words were going to ruin her day.

Victoria Sinclair smirked, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction as she studied Evelyn Carter’s face, searching for any flicker of distress.

Evelyn froze.

Her mind flashed back a decade—to the abandoned haystack where she’d found Alexander Whitmore bleeding out, barely clinging to life.

Victoria leaned in, her voice dripping with smugness. "I’ve even seen a photo of that girl in Alexander’s wallet. He carries it everywhere."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

That didn’t make sense. When she’d saved Alexander all those years ago, their encounter had been brief—just enough time to stop the bleeding before the ambulance arrived. There was no way he could have had a photo of her.

Shaking off the thought, Evelyn took the prescription from Victoria and walked out without another word.

Alexander ended his call the moment he spotted her. "How did it go?"

"Nothing serious. Just some ointment for the scratch."

"Good. I’ll go get the medication."

As he turned, something slipped from his pocket.

Evelyn hesitated, her fingers twitching toward the fallen object. She opened her mouth to call him back—
Evelyn crouched down, her fingers brushing against the leather object on the floor. Alexander's wallet.

Her breath hitched as she recalled Victoria's cryptic words about a photograph. Who did Alexander carry in his wallet all these years?

With trembling hands, she pried open the worn leather folds.

Tucked in the innermost compartment was a small, faded picture—so old the edges had begun to yellow.

The girl couldn't have been more than seventeen.

Large, innocent eyes stared back at Evelyn, framed by delicate features untouched by time. There was a fragility to her smile, a quiet sweetness that made Evelyn's stomach twist.

Her grip tightened involuntarily, the edges of the photo crumpling between her fingers.

This wasn't her.

Yet Alexander had kept this girl's image close to his heart for years, hidden away like a sacred relic. Whoever she was, she meant everything to him.

###Chapter 456 You Don't Need to Test Me

The hospital corridor buzzed with activity, yet to Evelyn Carter, everything felt unnervingly still.

The world around her muted into white noise.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she stared at the aged photograph in her hands.

Time had worn its edges, leaving faint creases where someone had held it too often.

A thin layer of protective film covered the image—a deliberate attempt to preserve what clearly mattered.

Her mind raced.

Does Alexander love someone else?

Then why did he marry me?

He swore he’d loved me for ten years.

Her lips pressed into a tight line as she slid the photo back into the wallet with mechanical precision.

Just as she closed it, Alexander returned, medication in hand.

His steps faltered when he saw his wallet in her grip.

Alexander gave a subtle nod, his expression unreadable as he discreetly opened the leather wallet to inspect its contents.

Evelyn noticed how his gaze lingered on the photo tucked inside for a full five seconds. His thumb brushed over the protective sleeve, as if confirming the image remained untouched, before he exhaled softly in relief.

A sharp ache twisted in Evelyn’s chest. "Alexander… that photo in your wallet—"

Before she could finish, he smoothly diverted the topic. "It's handled. Eleanor won’t trouble you again."

"How?" Evelyn asked, momentarily distracted.

"I sent her the security footage from the accident."

The recording laid everything bare. Anyone who watched it would see the truth instantly.

It showed Vanessa deliberately swerving into Evelyn’s lane, cutting her off with dangerous precision.

Even the officers had remarked on Vanessa’s reckless driving during their investigation. Though Evelyn bore partial blame for not braking in time, the fault was ultimately shared.

Then, almost as an afterthought, Alexander added, "Oh, and Ethan’s awake."

Evelyn arched a delicate brow.

"Would you like to visit him?" Alexander murmured, his piercing gaze tracing the contours of her face.

He uncapped the antiseptic, soaking a cotton pad before dabbing it gently against Evelyn's cheek. The sting was sharp but fleeting.

Her answer came swift and firm. "No. Why would I? He means nothing to me now."

"But he's asking for you."

Alexander's voice softened, weighted with something unspoken. "Are you certain? Ethan barely survived. He nearly died."

Evelyn studied him, a thought flickering through her mind—Why does he sound almost... jealous?

She lifted her chin, meeting his eyes squarely.

"His wants don't dictate mine. Stop testing me, Alexander. Whatever I once felt for Ethan is gone."

His lips pressed into a thin line.

Even he couldn't explain this restless unease coiling in his chest.

Across the city, Vincent and Eleanor's expressions darkened as they watched the footage Alexander had sent.

Vanessa had told her that Evelyn had rammed into her car, making Eleanor picture a fiery confrontation between two women battling for a man's affection.

She even mused that her son was rather fortunate—women were literally risking their lives for him while he lay unconscious in a hospital bed.

But the truth was far from what she imagined.

Vanessa had deliberately cut off Evelyn's car, and in the end, she was the one who suffered, losing her unborn child in the process.

She had orchestrated her own downfall.

When Richard noticed the grim expressions on their faces outside the operating room, he frowned. "What happened?"

Vincent handed him the phone. "See for yourself."

After watching the footage, Richard's expression darkened.

He knew instantly—this had just escalated into something far more dangerous.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 457 The Hidden Truth

Nathan Reeves was just as stunned as everyone else by the revelation. Vanessa Hart had acted with such reckless abandon! But as her father, Richard Hayes couldn't help but defend her.

"Regardless, Evelyn did collide with her sister's car. Vanessa isn't the most skilled driver—you can't place all the blame on her!" Richard argued fiercely.

His words left Vincent Black and Eleanor speechless. They knew Richard favored Vanessa, but they hadn’t expected him to twist the truth so shamelessly.

While Richard was willing to go to such extremes, Vincent and Eleanor refused to stoop to that level. The Caldwells prided themselves on their reputation, and with undeniable evidence staring them in the face, they were mortified.

Vincent cleared his throat. "Richard, this is a Caldwell family matter. Perhaps it's best if you leave now. We'll take care of it."

"But Vanessa is still in surgery—" Richard protested.

Eleanor cut him off sharply. "It's a minor procedure, not open-heart surgery. She'll be on her feet by tonight."

Realizing how inappropriate it was for him to linger in the maternity ward, Richard reluctantly left. Moments after his departure, Vanessa was wheeled out of the operating room.

Eleanor stormed toward her, her face twisted in fury, and delivered a stinging slap across Vanessa’s cheek. "Vanessa, have you lost your mind? You gambled with your own child!"

Vanessa clutched her throbbing abdomen, her cheek burning. She hadn’t anticipated such a violent reaction from Eleanor.

"What—what are you talking about?" Vanessa stammered, bewildered.

"How dare you play dumb! You know exactly what happened in that car crash!" Eleanor snapped.

"You’ve been nothing but a liability! I never should’ve allowed Ethan to marry you! Now that you’ve lost his favor, you think you can drag us all down with you? Who do you think we are?"

Eleanor had noticed Ethan’s growing indifference toward Vanessa, and it terrified her. The baby had been Vanessa’s last bargaining chip to regain her position, and Eleanor couldn’t believe her stupidity.

"You absolute fool! How could you be so careless?" Eleanor hissed, jabbing a finger at her.

"And now, because of your recklessness, I’ve lost my grandchild! Give me back my grandson!"

She struck Vanessa again, leaving her no room to escape.

Vanessa shielded her face, tears welling in her eyes. "I’m devastated too! If Evelyn hadn’t crashed into me, none of this would’ve happened!"

"Evelyn crashed into you? Or did you provoke her and cut her off?" Eleanor demanded.

"It was her fault! If she’d braked properly, there wouldn’t have—"

Eleanor’s eyes flashed with fury. "Enough of your lies!"

The tension in the room was suffocating, and Vanessa knew she was fighting a losing battle.

Eleanor's piercing gaze locked onto Vanessa, her mind flashing back to how Richard had similarly tried to pin everything on Evelyn.

"Like father, like daughter. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree," she seethed internally.

Just as her anger threatened to boil over, her phone vibrated sharply against her palm. Sophia's name flashed on the screen.

"Eleanor, I just heard about Vanessa's accident—she lost the baby? Why on earth was she behind the wheel when she's such a reckless driver? Couldn't you have arranged for a professional chauffeur?"

Eleanor's eyelid twitched in irritation. The accident had happened barely two hours ago, and she hadn't even stepped foot back into Whitmore Manor. How had news spread this fast?

"Eleanor, haven't you seen? It's all over the media. I just caught a glimpse on the evening news—Vanessa's face was plastered across the screen!"

The revelation sent a chill down Eleanor's spine.

Who had leaked this? And why so soon?

Her fingers tightened around her phone as her mind raced through possibilities. This wasn't just gossip—it was calculated exposure.

Someone was pulling strings behind the scenes.

And Eleanor intended to find out who.

###Chapter 458 It Made the News

Eleanor ended the call and instantly pulled up the news on her phone.

The glaring headline seized her focus: [Dangerous Lane-Hopping: Drivers Like This Should Be Banned! A Real Highway Hazard!]

Her stomach dropped as she tapped the link.

Crystal-clear dashcam footage showed Vanessa’s reckless lane-cutting in vivid detail.

But what made Eleanor’s blood run cold was the unmistakable close-up of Vanessa’s face, captured perfectly by the traffic camera.

The comment section was a storm of outrage.

"Is she trying to get herself killed or just ruin everyone else’s day? This isn’t driving—it’s a death wish!"

"This woman drives like she’s starring in her own action movie. Spoiler: it doesn’t end well."

"Hold on… doesn’t she look familiar? Isn’t that Ethan Caldwell’s wife?"

No one had anticipated the police would escalate this into a public warning broadcast.

The backlash was already spiraling out of control.

The situation worsened when netizens exposed Vanessa's true identity!

Eleanor stared at Vanessa in shock. Rage consumed her as she lunged forward, nails ready to claw at her face.

"Vanessa! Look at the mess you've made! If you want to humiliate yourself, fine! But now you've dragged the entire family into this disgrace!"

"We're the laughingstock of Cresthaven now!"

The hallway outside the operating room descended into chaos. Vincent stepped in, trying to mediate. "Fighting won't solve anything. We're only making this worse."

"Worse?" Eleanor scoffed. "Ever since this woman came into our lives, have we known a single day of peace? And Sophia—who does she think she is? If Vanessa hadn't been so reckless, Sophia would never have dared mock me like this!"

Eleanor had always despised Sophia for her petty, scheming nature. Their rivalry had spanned years, with Eleanor always holding the upper hand.

But this time, Sophia's smug remarks had left her speechless.

"This was orchestrated! I won't let this stand!" Eleanor seethed.

Losing her grandchild was devastating enough, but now the Caldwell name was being dragged through the mud online. Eleanor could already imagine the whispers at her next high-society luncheon.

Ethan had married Vanessa, an illegitimate daughter, and after all the effort to secure an heir, she had lost the baby in the most humiliating way possible.

"It's Alexander! He's behind this! Only he would stoop so low!" Eleanor declared.

She was convinced that since Evelyn had suffered, Alexander wouldn't let it slide. He must have leaked the footage to publicly shame them!

Vincent stiffened at the accusation.

"How dare he! This isn't just an attack on us—it's an assault on the Whitmore family's reputation! I'm calling Harold. He won't tolerate this!"

Before he could dial, Harold already knew.

Retired and with ample free time, Harold spent his mornings playing chess and browsing the news.

Just today, the scandal had flashed across his television screen.

When Harold summoned Alexander to Whitmore Manor, his voice was icy.

"Did you leak this to the press? To defend your wife, you'd tarnish the Whitmore name?"

Alexander responded with icy composure. "The Whitmore family's reputation? If we tolerate certain individuals' outrageous actions, that's what will truly destroy our legacy."

His words hung heavy in the air.

Harold's face darkened instantly. "Explain yourself. Are you implying I'm the problem?" His voice cracked like a whip, fury radiating from him.

The tension in the room thickened.

Alexander didn't flinch. His gaze remained steady, unyielding. "I'm stating facts. Turning a blind eye to misconduct only invites disgrace."

Harold's hands clenched into fists. "You insolent—"

Before he could finish, the doors burst open.

Vanessa rushed in, her face pale. "Father! Have you seen the news?"

A television screen flickered to life in the corner.

Breaking news headlines scrolled across the screen: "Scandal Rocks Elite Whitmore Family—Shocking Revelations Surface!"

Alexander's lips curved slightly.

Too late.

The damage was already done.

###Chapter 459 The Reckoning

The sunlight streaming through the windows did nothing to soften the tension in the room.

"I've endured your constant grievances at home," Harold Aniston's voice was low, but every word carried the weight of his fury. "But why did you have to drag our family's name through the mud? Now the entire city is whispering about us. Are you happy now?"

Though Harold knew Vanessa Hart bore responsibility for the scandal, Alexander Whitmore had crossed a line by exposing their private affairs to the public. The news had spread like wildfire, tarnishing the Aniston name. Even old acquaintances—people he hadn’t spoken to in decades—had reached out, their voices laced with pity and curiosity.

Humiliation burned through him.

Alexander, however, remained unruffled. He adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate calm. "They needed to face the consequences of their actions."

His voice was ice. "Did you expect me to sweep this under the rug? To let them walk away unscathed?"

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Just like you did when I exiled Ethan Caldwell from this family. Tell me, Father—since when do we protect criminals?"

The air grew heavier.

Alexander's next words sent a chill down Harold’s spine. "Be grateful Evelyn and the baby weren’t seriously harmed. If anything had happened to them..." His gaze darkened. "I wouldn’t have stopped at just ruining them."

Harold recoiled. "What are you saying? Alexander, you’re a detective, not a vigilante! I never should have—"

The door slammed shut before he could finish.

Alexander was already gone.

Harold's face darkened as he gripped the armrests. "You forget your place, Alexander. Everything you have came from me. I can strip it all away whenever I choose."

A cold smirk curled Alexander's lips. "The mask finally slips. You needed me to save Titan Capital Group during the crisis, but now that I'm protecting what matters, suddenly I'm disposable?"

He leaned back, the leather sofa creaking beneath him. "But here's something you should understand—Titan Capital isn't yours to reclaim anymore. Test me if you doubt it."

The unshakable calm in Alexander's voice made Harold falter. For the first time, he couldn't counter his son's words.

Alexander had transformed into the heir Harold always claimed to want—ruthless, strategic, unstoppable.

Harold studied him, struck by how much Alexander resembled Evelyn in that moment. The sharp angles of his jaw, the defiant tilt of his chin—it softened Harold's fury just slightly.

This wasn't an enemy. This was his blood, fighting for the woman he loved.

"Enough," Harold bit out. "Call off your people. Have the press retract the story."

Alexander didn't blink. "A word of advice? Losing your head over a woman is beneath you. Especially when Evelyn's ties to Ethan Caldwell are... complicated." His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "For the family's sake, end this marriage."

The scandal of imprisonment struck Harold like a thunderbolt, forcing him to face the gravity of the situation.

Such disgrace was intolerable for a family of their standing.

Harold would never permit Ethan to harm Alexander. The only viable solution was to drive Evelyn out of the Whitmore family.

It was a perfect strategy—saving their reputation while eliminating future complications.

Alexander’s eyes darkened dangerously. "So, the Whitmores solve their crises by pinning everything on a woman?"

His laugh was cold, edged with menace.

"I caused this uproar to make it clear—I will protect my wife at all costs. By what right do you interfere in my marriage, Father?" His voice dripped with disdain. "You never raised me. Perhaps it’s time I stopped pretending you did."

The air thickened with tension.

Harold’s jaw tightened, but Alexander wasn’t finished.

"Evelyn stays. If you force her out, I walk with her. And when I do, the Whitmore name won’t survive the fallout."

A silent battle raged between them—one fueled by years of resentment.

Harold had underestimated his son.

Now, he was reaping the consequences.
###Chapter 460 The Silent Standoff

Alexander's voice was deceptively calm as he delivered his ultimatum.

Nathan had never expected Alexander to be so fiercely devoted to Evelyn—so much so that even his most lenient suggestion for her was unacceptable. Worse, he was willing to defy his own father for her sake.

Whispers claimed Evelyn was expecting.

Yet Alexander remained unshaken by the rumors.

"Fine."

Nathan sighed in resignation. "I'm too old to meddle in your affairs. But remember—no matter how much you despise Ethan, don’t harm him. We’re still family. They’ve already lost their child. Don’t push them too far."

His words carried the weight of experience. In a family like theirs, no one was weak. Provoking them too much would only ignite an all-out war.

Alexander’s jaw tightened. "As long as Ethan knows his place. As his uncle, I’ll be happy to teach him some manners."

The conversation ended, and Alexander retreated to his room, shutting the door with deliberate control.

Evelyn sat on the bed, scrolling through news updates when the door—

###Chapter 461 Confession

Ethan Caldwell's face was deathly pale. Having just recovered from a severe illness, his breathing was shallow and uneven.

His gaze remained fixed on the two figures entwined by the window, their passionate kiss burning into his vision. He couldn’t tear his eyes away, as if punishing himself with the sight.

In the shadows, he was nothing more than a voyeur. His heart shattered, yet his lips curled into a twisted, bitter smile.

The moment he had regained consciousness, he learned of Vanessa Hart’s miscarriage—caused by Evelyn Carter’s reckless driving. A dark thought flickered in his mind: Was it jealousy?

Ignoring the doctor’s protests, Ethan had rushed back to Whitmore Manor, only to witness Alexander Whitmore and Evelyn in the throes of passion.

His fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

Then, as if reaching a decision, he pulled out his phone and dialed. "Are you absolutely certain that woman means that much to Uncle Alexander?"

"Without a doubt!" Trevor Moss’s confident voice crackled through the line. "You’re my closest friend—why would I lie? She found him at his lowest, saved him from starvation. Their bond is as deep as yours and hers ever was."

Ethan didn’t argue.

His attention snapped back to the window, where Evelyn now leaned against the sill, her silhouette framed by moonlight.

Only a woman deeply in love would dare to do such a thing!

Ethan clenched his fists, his face turning ashen. "Find her. Bring her to Cresthaven immediately."

Trevor nodded but couldn't resist adding, "Ethan, most women don’t respect men who worship them. Remember how untouchable you used to be? Confidence is what attracts them. Maybe... you should stop indulging her so much."

Ethan remained silent, finding the term "worship" amusing in this context.

When no reply came, Trevor hesitated before asking, "Ethan... are you angry?"

"No. Just follow my orders. Quickly." He ended the call.

Leaning back, Ethan shut his eyes briefly, exhaling slowly.

Nathan glanced at him from the driver’s seat. "Would you like to step out for some air?"

"Take me back to the hospital," Ethan commanded.

He wasn’t officially discharged yet and needed to return.

Nathan complied without another word, turning the car around toward the medical center.

Vanessa was waiting in his private ward.

Her eyes were still puffy from crying—she’d undergone an abortion earlier that day. Her face was ghostly pale, her usual vibrancy drained away.

"Ethan, our baby is gone. Please, don't leave me too. Evelyn took everything from us... I have no one but you now..." Vanessa's voice trembled as tears streamed down her bruised cheeks.

Ethan wordlessly reached for the tissue box on the coffee table, pulling out two sheets and handing them to her. The simple gesture made her breath hitch—this was the first kindness he'd shown her in months.

"Does it still hurt?" His voice was low, detached.

Vanessa blinked in confusion. "What?"

His gaze dropped to her abdomen. "Your stomach. From the procedure."

The memory of Eleanor's slap across her face after the abortion flashed in her mind. The humiliation, the physical pain—it all came rushing back.

A choked sob escaped her lips when she realized he was asking about her wellbeing. "N-no... It's better now. But Ethan—" She clutched the tissues tighter. "I can't lose you too. If anything happens to you, I'll—I'll make them pay! Even if it's your uncle, I swear I'll—"

Ethan's piercing stare cut her off. His fingers brushed the swollen mark on her cheekbone where Eleanor had struck her. "Who did this to you?"

The tenderness in his touch made fresh tears spill over. The red imprint stood out starkly against her pale skin, a brutal reminder of her suffering.

Vanessa hesitated. This was her chance. If she played this right, she could turn his sympathy into something more. Something permanent.

She let her lower lip quiver. "It doesn't matter. Nothing matters except you." Her fingers crept toward his wrist. "We've both lost so much... but we still have each other. Don't we?"

The grandfather clock in the corner ticked loudly in the heavy silence. Somewhere in Whitmore Manor, a door slammed shut.

Ethan's expression remained unreadable as he studied her face—the tears, the bruises, the desperation.

Then his phone buzzed.

Vanessa's heart plummeted when she saw the name flashing on the screen: Evelyn Carter.

The woman who'd destroyed everything.

The woman who still held Ethan's heart.

The guilt weighed heavily on my shoulders. I should have protected my baby. No wonder she was furious with me.

Ethan's voice cut through my thoughts. "Vanessa, why are you so determined to stay when all I want is a divorce?"

His question hung in the air, sharp and unrelenting.

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms. The pain grounded me, kept me from crumbling.

"You know why," I whispered, my voice barely audible.

The truth burned in my chest, but I couldn't say it. Not yet.

Ethan's expression darkened. "No, I don't. And I'm tired of guessing."

The tension between us was suffocating.

I took a shaky breath. "Because I still love you."

His eyes flickered with something unreadable.

It was a dangerous confession. One that could either break us completely—or change everything.

###Chapter 462 Trial by Fire

Vanessa chewed her bottom lip nervously. "I know I screwed up. You have every reason to hate me right now. I deserve it. But Ethan, I swear, I genuinely care about you."

Her voice trembled slightly. "Everything I did—even the worst of it—was because I love you. No matter who walks away, I won’t. I’ll stay."

Ethan exhaled sharply, flicking open his lighter. The flame caught, illuminating the sharp angles of his face as he lit a cigarette.

"You just had surgery—" Vanessa reached for it, her fingers brushing his. "Ethan, please. At least wait until you’re discharged?"

The resemblance between Vanessa and Evelyn was uncanny. For a split second, Ethan’s gaze flickered, distracted by the ghost of another woman in her features.

A nurse paused by the door, frowning. "Mrs. Caldwell, you should be resting. After your—"

"I’m fine," Vanessa cut in, straightening. "My husband needs me." She turned toward the small kitchenette in the VIP suite, determination in her steps.

"Ethan, you can’t handle anything heavy right now. Let me make you some congee?"

The suite’s kitchen was compact but fully stocked. Ethan didn’t argue, just leaned back against the pillows, watching her move with detached silence.

Vanessa worked quietly, pouring every ounce of desperation into the simple meal. If she could just keep him from signing those divorce papers—

Two weeks passed in a blur of careful routines. Ethan’s recovery progressed, his strength returning day by day.

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the hospital window as Trevor leaned against the doorframe with a smirk.

"I've got good news and even better news," he announced, his voice dripping with playful secrecy. "Which one do you want first?"

Ethan exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his expression unreadable. "Not interested."

Trevor chuckled. "Ah, there’s the Ice Prince of Cresthaven I know. So cold, so untouchable. You could have any woman in this city wrapped around your finger."

Ethan flicked the cigarette into the bin without sparing him a glance. "What’s the good news?"

"The good news is your uncle’s little obsession, Isabella Morgan, is flying back tomorrow night." Trevor grinned. "The better news? The Powell family’s black sheep is back in town, and Cresthaven is about to get a whole lot more interesting."

Ethan remained impassive. "Isabella’s return might be relevant. But why should I care about the other?"

Trevor pulled his chair closer, lowering his voice. "Alexander’s been running things smoothly, but Dominic Powell? He’s unpredictable. After years in the shadows, he’s back—and he’s not here to play nice. Your uncle’s empire might take a hit."

Ethan’s fingers stilled around his lighter, his mind working through the implications.

Just then, Vanessa stepped in, balancing a tray of freshly sliced fruit.

Trevor, having said his piece, stood and stretched. "Well, duty calls."

Vanessa escorted him out before returning to Ethan’s side. She picked up an apple slice and held it out to him.

He took it, the sweetness bursting on his tongue.

"Ethan," she said softly, "if your tests come back clear tomorrow, the doctor said you can be discharged. You’ll finish recovering at home."

The afternoon sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow across the room.

"I understand," Ethan murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. "Thank you for looking after me these past few days."

Vanessa blinked in surprise, a faint smile tugging at her lips. "There's no need for thanks. It's what a wife should do."

A heavy silence settled between them before Ethan abruptly broke it. "Evelyn and I were alone together at Hawthorne Estate for quite some time. Don't you wonder what we were doing?"

Vanessa stiffened, her pulse quickening. The question felt like a trap.

Is he trying to provoke me?

Her fingers curled slightly against the fabric of her dress, but she kept her expression carefully composed.

Secret Admiration: Finding True Love After Prison (Evelyn)

###Chapter 463 Risk

The confession hung heavy in the air between them.

"Honestly, I'm terrified," Vanessa admitted, her fingers twisting the fabric of her dress. "No woman wants to share the man she loves, and neither do I." Her gaze locked onto Ethan’s, unwavering despite the storm of emotions inside her.

Her voice softened. "Back then, I was pregnant—fragile. I couldn’t... be with you the way you needed." A bitter smile touched her lips. "I was jealous, yes. But more than that, I hated myself for failing to keep your heart."

Ethan’s expression shifted, surprise flickering in his dark eyes.

He reached out, tilting her chin up with a single finger. "Why?" His voice was low, rough with something unspoken. "Why do you love me like this?"

The space between them vanished, their breaths mingling.

Vanessa didn’t hesitate. "Your mind. Your body. The way you make me feel when we’re together." Her words were bold, deliberate.

A satisfied smirk curved his lips.

Then, unbidden, the memory surfaced—Evelyn pressed against Alexander near the balcony, their lips locked in a heated kiss.

His grip on Vanessa tightened. "Kiss me," he commanded.

For a heartbeat, she froze. Then, swallowing her shock, she obeyed, her mouth meeting his with practiced ease.

The irony wasn’t lost on him. He’d denied himself for Evelyn’s sake, yet she had no such restraint with Alexander.

The realization tasted bitter.

Pathetic.

He deepened the kiss, chasing the thought away.

Vanessa wasn't entirely sure what Ethan meant by his earlier words, but she didn't press further.

Yet, before she could dwell on it, he pulled her into his arms, deepening the kiss with an urgency that left her breathless.

A fire burned in his chest—months of pent-up desire demanding release.

When he gave her that silent permission, her heart leapt with unexpected delight.

But reality crashed in. The doctor had been clear—no intimacy for at least a month after her miscarriage. The risk of infection was too high.

Still, this was Ethan Caldwell. The man she had longed for. How could she let this chance slip away?

Her thoughts tangled in hesitation—until his hands slid beneath her skirt.

His voice turned sharp. "Don’t tell me you’re having second thoughts now."

She shook her head quickly, pressing closer. "I want this. I want you."

Her lips found his again, hungry and reckless, sealing her decision.

Afterward, exhaustion pulled her under, and she drifted into sleep on the hospital bed.

Ethan lit a cigarette, exhaling slowly as satisfaction settled over him.

But as he watched Vanessa’s peaceful expression, his mind betrayed him.

He imagined Evelyn Carter in her place—soft sighs, worshiping hands, the way she would have looked at him with those deep, knowing eyes.

The fantasy was sweeter than reality.

According to Harold, any woman marrying into the Whitmore family was required to reside at Whitmore Manor to receive ancestral blessings.

Vanessa had lived there during her pregnancy years ago, so Evelyn agreed to the arrangement without protest.

But Alexander wouldn’t tolerate outdated traditions. "If you’re uncomfortable, we’ll leave immediately. These rules mean nothing to me."

The Whitmore family was extensive—nearly every member lived at the manor except Alexander.

He refused to let Evelyn get tangled in their suffocating family politics.

"Your father insists on tradition, though. Honestly, I don’t mind staying." Evelyn traced her fingers along Alexander’s jaw, the rough stubble grazing her fingertips.

His chain felt cold against her skin.

"Worried Ethan and Eleanor will make trouble for me? They wouldn’t dare cross me under your roof, would they?"

Alexander had already made them pay.

Though the scandal had been scrubbed from headlines, the damage was done.

Eleanor had locked herself in her rooms since, claiming illness. She refused to even dine with the family.

Eleanor rarely left her room these days.

Every time she stepped out, Sophia would sneer, "Oh, Eleanor, feeling better? Was it your son marrying that useless woman that gave you migraines? Or was it her failure to protect your grandchild?"

Each word was a blade twisting deeper into her chest.

The weight of it suffocated her until she retreated behind locked doors.

To keep Evelyn from growing restless, Alexander sent over the cello he had gifted her before.

For days, she lost herself in its melodies, the notes filling the silence of the manor.

Between practice sessions, she called Claire to catch up.

Claire was due in two months, her voice bright with anticipation.

"And what about you and Lucas...?"

"We're divorced."

Claire's voice was light, almost carefree. "Ditched the toxic ex, now it's just me and my little one."

Evelyn exhaled slowly.

Lucas had misunderstood—he assumed Claire's baby belonged to Julian.

But as an outsider and Claire's closest friend, Evelyn wasn't about to correct him. Not when Claire finally seemed happy.

"Did it hurt when he wasn’t there for the birth?" she asked gently.

Claire shrugged. "What good would he have done? Holding my hand wouldn’t have made the contractions any easier. His absence was irrelevant."

Evelyn nodded. That made perfect sense.

Without hesitation, she declared, "Don’t worry, Claire! I’ll be your ride-or-die from now on!"

Claire burst out laughing. "Deal! And when my son starts talking, I’ll teach him to call you 'Mommy'!"

Evelyn grinned, relieved. Claire wasn’t just coping—she was thriving. The divorce hadn’t broken her. If anything, she was freer than ever.


Claire abruptly shifted the conversation. "Speaking of which, there's been some gossip circulating in Cresthaven about you. Have you caught wind of it?"

"What are you referring to?" Evelyn asked, her brow furrowing slightly.

"Rumors are spreading that you're carrying Ethan's child," Claire revealed, watching her friend's reaction closely.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, exasperated by the sheer pettiness of people.

"Why are they so obsessed with my personal life instead of minding their own damn business?" she snapped, irritation lacing her voice.

Claire bit her lip, concerned about how these whispers might strain Evelyn's relationship with Alexander.

"I'm worried this gossip could hurt you. Speaking of which, has Alexander been acting differently lately?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a small smile. "Yes."

"Nothing... unusual?" Claire pressed, finding his sudden attentiveness suspicious.

At this, Evelyn's cheeks flushed a delicate pink, her gaze dropping to her hands.

Claire's eyes widened in realization. "No way! Is he really that insatiable? He can't even control himself while you're pregnant?"

The past two weeks had felt like a dream to Evelyn.

Every single day, she and Alexander couldn't keep their hands off each other.

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows as Evelyn Carter curled up on the sofa, her phone pressed to her ear.

Claire Dawson’s voice crackled through the line. "The doctor said we can resume intimacy after the first trimester. And honestly, Alexander was so gentle—I barely felt a thing."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her phone. Something about Claire’s tone felt… off.

A car engine rumbled outside, pulling her attention away. The familiar hum of Alexander Whitmore’s luxury sedan sent a flutter through her chest.

Moments later, the front door swung open.

Alexander strode in, his tailored suit clinging to his broad frame. The crisp scent of his cologne mixed with the faint chill of autumn air still clinging to his coat.

Without a word, he pulled Evelyn into his arms.

"Miss me?" His voice was low, rough with affection.

Evelyn melted against him, her pulse quickening. "Always."

His lips met hers in a slow, possessive kiss.

As she gazed up at him—those sharp cheekbones, the smoldering intensity in his eyes—she traced the perfect slope of his nose.

God, he was breathtaking.

Sometimes, she imagined their future son inheriting those devastating looks.

Breaking the kiss, Evelyn smoothed her hands over his chest. "You must be starving. I’ll have the chef prepare dinner."

Alexander tightened his grip on Evelyn’s wrist, stopping her from walking away.

“Dinner can wait.” His fingers trailed down her spine with deliberate slowness, igniting a familiar heat between them.

His lips found the delicate curve of her collarbone, his breath warm against her skin. The hunger in his touch was undeniable, his restraint unraveling by the second.

“How about we work up an appetite first?” His voice was rough with desire.

Evelyn didn’t protest. Instead, she met his gaze, her silent consent sending a thrill through him.

In one swift motion, he pressed her down, his mouth claiming every inch of exposed skin with reckless abandon.

Her blouse slipped from her shoulders, pooling at her feet in a whisper of fabric.

The air between them crackled with urgency, their bodies moving in perfect sync.

Control was a distant memory.

In that moment, nothing else mattered.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 465 The Aftermath

The last rays of twilight had faded by the time they finished.

At Whitmore Manor, meals were served precisely on schedule. Missing dinner meant going hungry—no exceptions.

Evelyn lay breathless, her body humming with exhaustion. Alexander's stamina had become almost overwhelming lately.

Men in their twenties were insatiable, but this? This bordered on ridiculous.

Alexander's palm slid over her abdomen, his touch feather-light. "How have you been feeling?" His voice was low, thoughtful. "Your bump isn't showing much yet."

"Maybe it needs more time," she murmured.

The doctor's words echoed in her mind—the baby measured small. Despite nutrient-rich meals and careful rest, progress seemed sluggish.

Prison had stolen more than years from her. It had stolen her body's ability to heal properly.

"I'll bring you dinner," Alexander said, pressing a kiss to her temple before rising.

The sheets rustled as he dressed. Evelyn watched the play of moonlight across his shoulders, her fingers twitching with the memory of touching him.

Her stomach chose that moment to growl loudly.

Alexander chuckled. "That settles it. I'm definitely raiding the kitchen now."

Evelyn buried her face in the pillows, equal parts mortified and amused. Pregnancy hunger was no joke.

As his footsteps faded down the hallway, she traced absent circles on her belly. This child would be loved. Would be safe.

No matter what.

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson. She quickly slipped into her silk pajamas and trailed Alexander to the kitchen.

The staff had already left for the night. Alexander began preparing spaghetti for them both.

As she approached, his gaze lingered on the delicate curve of her exposed neck.

"Spaghetti alone won't give you enough nutrients," Evelyn murmured, turning toward the refrigerator. "With your schedule, you need more protein." She reached for the eggs, but Alexander's arms encircled her from behind.

His lips brushed against her skin. "Why did you choose this?" he murmured, his voice rough.

The pajama top dipped low, revealing the elegant slope of her shoulders and collarbones.

His warm breath tickled the shell of her ear, sending her pulse racing.

Alexander's voice dropped lower. "Suddenly, I'm not hungry for spaghetti anymore."

"Alexander," she whispered urgently, "your father is here." The kitchen was hardly private—anyone could walk in. The thought of being caught made her want to vanish on the spot.

But he ignored her protest, pressing another kiss just below her jaw.

"We're married," he murmured. "Since when is a kiss a crime?"

Alexander pinned Evelyn against the wall, his arm forming an unbreakable cage around her. His other hand slid possessively around her waist, lifting her effortlessly onto the kitchen counter.

His touch was electric, tracing slow, deliberate paths along her skin.

Evelyn’s cheeks burned.

He had been insatiable ever since she moved into Whitmore Manor.

Just as their passion deepened, the kitchen door swung open.

Ethan Caldwell stood frozen in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

His gaze flickered over Evelyn’s flushed face, the telltale marks on her neck, the way Alexander’s hands still lingered on her waist.

If he hadn’t walked in, there was no doubt where this would have led.

Ethan’s jaw tightened, but his voice remained steady.

"Uncle Alexander. There are children in the house." His tone was dry. "I know you two can’t keep your hands off each other, but this is the kitchen."

Instead of retreating, he deliberately left the door wide open.

His eyes landed on the pot of boiling water. "Spaghetti?" He exhaled sharply. "I haven’t eaten. Mind if I join?"

###Chapter 466 Unexpected Encounter

The air in the kitchen thickened the moment Ethan Caldwell stepped inside.

His presence shattered what had been an intimate moment between Alexander and Evelyn.

Alexander Whitmore didn’t falter. His hands remained steady as he adjusted Evelyn’s dress, smoothing the fabric with deliberate care.

Ethan watched, his expression unreadable.

A slow smirk curled Alexander’s lips as he brushed his thumb over Evelyn’s flushed cheek. "Darling, why don’t you prepare something for us? I’ll be waiting in the living room."

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

He was leaving her alone with Ethan.

Her pulse raced, but she forced a soft smile and nodded.

She understood.

The more composed she appeared, the more dignity it granted Alexander. Every man had his pride, and Ethan’s actions had wounded his deeply.

Being kidnapped, locked away—those weren’t things Alexander would forget.

And now, the woman who had once rejected Ethan’s advances was—

Alexander was brilliantly cunning, and Evelyn adored that about him.

When Alexander exited the kitchen, he intentionally left the door slightly open.

Evelyn wiped her hands on a towel before stirring the simmering pasta.

Ethan retrieved plates from the cabinet and set them on the counter with deliberate precision.

“The staff mentioned you and Uncle Alexander have been… intimate quite often,” he remarked casually.

Evelyn froze. How would any servant have witnessed them when they occupied the most secluded wing of Whitmore Manor?

Impossible. Clearly, Ethan was probing.

She calmly plated the pasta but remained silent.

Unfazed, Ethan continued, “You’re pregnant, Evelyn. Shouldn’t you be resting instead of indulging? Do you really believe Alexander cares about you—or this child?”

As she scooped the last of the pasta, boiling water splashed onto her skin. The sudden sting made her drop the tongs.

Her hand burned red. Gritting her teeth, she thought back to Claire’s phone call earlier that afternoon.

Claire mentioned the gossip spreading through Cresthaven—that Evelyn was expecting Ethan's baby.

Alexander moved away from the sink and turned on the faucet for her.

His actions remained proper, maintaining a respectful distance from Evelyn the entire time.

Evelyn rinsed her hands under the cool stream of water, the sting from the burn slowly fading.

Alexander returned to the stove, plating the last of the pasta with practiced ease.

"If a man truly loves you," he murmured, almost to himself, "he won’t care about your past."

His voice was low, thoughtful. "I warned you before, Evelyn. Alexander isn’t as straightforward as he seems. He’ll always control the relationship. Don’t let him get too close."

With that, he picked up the dinner plate and gave her a slight nod. "I’ll take this to the dining room first."

Then he pushed open the kitchen door and disappeared into the hallway.

The icy water had numbed the worst of the pain on her skin.

Evelyn turned off the tap, grabbed the remaining two plates, and followed him out.

In the dining room, Alexander was laughing softly into his phone, his voice warm and relaxed.

It was the first time Evelyn had ever heard him sound so genuinely happy during a call.

The moment Evelyn stepped closer, Alexander swiftly ended his call. His piercing gaze locked onto hers as he asked, "What exactly did you discuss with Ethan just now?"

Her breath hitched. The tension between them crackled like static electricity.

Alexander's jaw tightened visibly. He pocketed his phone with deliberate slowness, never breaking eye contact. The late afternoon sunlight streaming through the windows cast sharp shadows across his angular features.

Evelyn's fingers twitched at her sides. She hadn't expected him to overhear her conversation. The call had been brief - just a few clipped sentences exchanged with her former fiancé.

The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken questions.

Alexander took a measured step forward. His tailored suit jacket stretched across his broad shoulders as he crossed his arms. "Well?"

A faint citrusy scent of his cologne mixed with the crisp autumn air drifting through the open balcony doors.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "It wasn't important."

His eyebrow arched in that infuriating way she'd come to recognize. The way that said he knew she was withholding information.

Somewhere downstairs, a door slammed shut. The distant sound of footsteps echoed through the grand hallway of Whitmore Manor.

Alexander's expression darkened. "When it comes to Ethan Caldwell, everything is important."

The weight of his words settled between them like a physical presence.

Evelyn swallowed hard. She should have known Alexander would react this way. After everything that had happened, after all the betrayals and manipulations, he had every reason to distrust her former fiancé.

And yet...

The phone call had been unexpected. Ethan's voice had sounded different - strained, almost desperate.

But explaining that to Alexander now would only make things worse.

The grandfather clock in the hallway chimed five times, each resonant tone vibrating through the tense silence.

Alexander's phone buzzed in his pocket, but he ignored it. His entire focus remained fixed on her.

Evelyn could see the storm brewing behind his steel-gray eyes. She'd seen that look before - right before he made one of his ruthless business moves or confronted a threat head-on.

And right now, she realized with a sinking feeling, Alexander Whitmore clearly considered Ethan Caldwell a threat.

To their marriage.

To their hard-won peace.

To everything.

###Chapter 467 Refusal

"Just some routine things," Evelyn murmured as she arranged the dinner plates with practiced ease. "Let's eat—I'm absolutely famished!"

Her appetite had doubled lately, a natural consequence of her condition. Alexander watched with quiet satisfaction as she savored each bite.

"Oh, I almost forgot," Evelyn added between mouthfuls, "I still need to finalize my transition at Titan Capital Group."

Though she owned the company, protocol demanded she properly delegate her responsibilities before stepping away.

Alexander gave an understanding nod. "Handle it at your own pace."

After the meal, he excused himself for a shower, pausing to brush his lips against her temple. "Don't keep me waiting too long."

The casual remark triggered Ethan Caldwell's earlier warning in her mind: "You're carrying his child, Evelyn. Shouldn't he be more concerned about your rest than his own desires? Does he really prioritize your wellbeing?"

Her fingers hesitated mid-air as she applied her nightly skincare, the serum cool against her distracted touch. Alexander, toweling his hair, didn't notice her momentary stillness.

The vibration of his phone shattered the quiet.

The phone call could confirm her doubts.

Evelyn's hands shook as she reached for the device, but the ringing ceased before she could answer.

At that moment, Alexander stepped out of the shower, a towel slung low around his hips. Water droplets glistened on his sculpted torso, impossible to ignore.

He caught her staring and smirked.

"Like what you see?"

Before she could respond, he took her hand and pressed it against his damp skin. His lips found hers in a searing kiss, fingers tangling in her hair to hold her close.

Evelyn melted into him, breath hitching as his mouth moved with possessive hunger.

"Relax, sweetheart," he murmured against her lips. "Just once tonight."

She nodded, dizzy from his touch. His hands cradled her face, teeth grazing her bottom lip in that way that always unraveled her. Her arms wound around his neck of their own accord.

"Not tonight," she whispered between kisses.

Alexander didn't stop. His breath warmed her cheek, sending shivers down her spine. The kiss deepened, his grip tightening as if he couldn't bear to let go.

When she finally turned her head to gasp for air, her plea came out breathless. "I'm pregnant. We shouldn't..."

His palm slid to her stomach. "Are you feeling unwell?" The question was casual, but his darkened gaze told another story.

Alexander smirked, his fingers tracing idle patterns on the bedsheet. "So, what exactly are you implying? That I'm not gentle enough?" His voice was low, teasing, but there was an edge to it—a challenge.

Evelyn didn’t respond.

She lay still, her gaze fixed on the ceiling, her fingers curled loosely at her sides. The silence stretched between them, thick and uncomfortable.

Alexander’s playful mood evaporated.

He studied her face—the way her lips pressed together, the tension in her jaw. She wasn’t just distracted. She was closed off.

"Evelyn," he said, his voice losing its earlier lightness. "Look at me."

She didn’t.

His hand stilled. "You don’t want to tonight."

It wasn’t a question.

The air between them grew heavier, charged with something unspoken.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, finally turning her head to meet his gaze. Her eyes were guarded, distant.

Alexander’s expression darkened.

He pushed himself up, sitting at the edge of the bed, his back to her. The sheets rustled as he moved, the sound sharp in the quiet room.

Evelyn watched him, her chest tight.

She should say something.

But the words wouldn’t come.

Alexander stood abruptly, grabbing his shirt from the chair. He didn’t look back as he pulled it on, his movements stiff.

The door clicked shut behind him.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

Alone again.

Just like always.

Alexander's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Then what's troubling you, darling? Do I need to be more tender?" His lips brushed against Evelyn's forehead in a featherlight kiss.

The air between them crackled with Alexander's unmistakable desire, while Evelyn's mind wandered elsewhere. When her lack of response became apparent, his brow furrowed.

"Are you absolutely certain about refusing me tonight?" His voice dropped to that dangerous velvet tone that usually made her melt.

###Chapter 468 Jealousy

"Alexander, I just think..." Evelyn began, her voice trailing off.

Before she could finish her sentence, Alexander's phone buzzed sharply on the nightstand.

He didn’t move, his piercing blue eyes fixed on her, waiting.

Evelyn hesitated, her thoughts scattering. "You should answer that first," she murmured instead.

With a slow exhale, he released her and reached for the device.

A flicker of movement caught her eye—Isabella flashed across the screen.

That name again.

A childhood nickname, sweet and intimate, reserved for someone who had known him long before Evelyn ever did.

Her breath hitched as she watched his expression soften, the hard edges of his face melting into something tender. Without a word, he strode out of the bedroom, the door clicking shut behind him.

Evelyn froze.

Alexander never stepped away to take calls. Not from her.

Which meant this was different.

This was a secret.

Her fingers curled into the sheets. Maybe it was just the hormones—the irrational fears that came with pregnancy. She shook her head, trying to dispel the unease coiling in her chest.

She was his wife. His legal wife.

And she carried his heir.

Yet why did that suddenly feel like it wasn’t enough?

It was merely a phone call. Everyone deserved their privacy.

When Evelyn spoke with Claire on the phone, she didn’t always want Alexander hovering nearby.

Perhaps Isabella was a man!

After reassuring herself, Evelyn was about to close her eyes when Alexander stepped back into the bedroom.

He set his phone down, the ghost of a smile still playing on his lips.

Alexander tilted his head. "You wanted to tell me something earlier?"

Evelyn studied him, a strange tightness coiling in her chest.

He had sounded so animated while talking to Isabella.

After a beat of hesitation, she knew—if she didn’t ask now, she’d spend the entire night tossing and turning.

"Who is Isabella?"

Alexander blinked. "You saw her name?"

Evelyn nodded.

Alexander didn’t hesitate. "An old friend. It was her first auction, so she asked for advice."

It sounded reasonable. Too reasonable.

Evelyn bit her lip. Was she overreacting?

But then why did that lingering smile on his face make her stomach twist?

Alexander drew Evelyn into his embrace, breathing in the delicate floral scent of her shampoo.

His lips brushed against her temple as he murmured, "I might be home late tomorrow night. Don't stay up waiting for me."

Business galas were part of Alexander's routine, and midnight returns weren't unusual.

A man dedicated to his empire—that was simply who he was.

"Anything you'd like?" His fingers traced idle circles on her back. "I'll bring it home for you."

Wrapped in his warmth, Evelyn's earlier tension melted away.

"Just you," she whispered, already drifting into peaceful sleep against his chest.

Morning light found his side of the bed cold and empty.

After her morning routine, Evelyn entered the dining room to find Ethan and Vanessa already seated.

The moment their eyes met, Vanessa's manicured nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

They hadn't crossed paths since... that night. The night Vanessa lost what she'd schemed so hard to obtain.

The air thickened with unspoken accusations.

Evelyn's toast turned to ash in her mouth. Across the table, Vanessa's smile was all sharp edges and poisoned honey.

Some wounds never healed. Some battles never ended.

And this war between them? It had only just begun.

The criticisms of Vanessa were harsh, accusing her of reckless driving and cursing the unfortunate drivers behind her.

This left Evelyn with no choice but to swallow her anger, unable to pin any blame on Vanessa.

At least one good thing came from the miscarriage—her relationship with Ethan had slightly improved. A small silver lining in an otherwise devastating situation.

But the rumors about Vanessa in Cresthaven still burned in Evelyn’s chest like acid.

Whose child was Vanessa carrying?

If that baby truly belonged to Ethan, Evelyn might actually celebrate.

As Alexander’s wife, Vanessa was entangled with Ethan. The Whitmore family would never tolerate such disgrace, and Vanessa’s reputation would be ruined beyond repair.

Vanessa remained oblivious to Evelyn’s scheming.

As they sat down for breakfast, Vanessa casually remarked, "I heard there’s a major auction today. With Sir Whitmore’s 80th birthday coming up, I’d love to go and bid on something special for him."

Ethan took a slow sip of his coffee.

His gaze flickered toward Evelyn before he responded, "You mean the Powell auction? I’d advise you to stay home."

###Chapter 469 Restless Whispers

Vanessa frowned. "What do you mean?"

"Have you heard? The Powell family's troublemaker is back. Why do you think he's making such a spectacle with this auction?"

Vanessa froze for a moment, a sudden unease creeping into her expression.

"How did that menace resurface? What terrible timing. I think I'll skip today's plans," she muttered.

Auction?

Evelyn's thoughts immediately snapped to the auction Alexander had mentioned the night before. Was this connected?

Ethan's voice was quiet but deliberate. "At a Powell auction, the only person who could possibly keep things under control for them is Uncle Alexander."

Evelyn finally turned to study Ethan, sensing something layered beneath his words.

What is he implying? Is this a warning?

After breakfast, Evelyn changed into a sleek business outfit, deciding to head to Titan Capital Group first to finalize her resignation paperwork.

Evelyn Carter couldn't shake the strange feeling creeping up on her.

She studied Natalie Brooks with growing suspicion.

When Natalie headed to the pantry to rinse her mug, Evelyn followed closely behind.

Natalie hesitated before speaking. "This morning, Mr. Whitmore brought a stunning woman into his office. They've been in there all morning—haven't come out once."

Evelyn blinked. "She must be a client."

Alexander Whitmore frequently met with female business associates. Back when Evelyn had worked in his office, she'd witnessed similar situations countless times.

It meant nothing. He was a CEO, after all. High-profile negotiations often took hours—sometimes entire days—to finalize.

Natalie bit her lip. "Honestly? I don’t think this is just business. Just… keep an eye out."

Alexander had never been one for scandals, which made today’s incident all the more unusual.

What unsettled Natalie most was how comfortable they seemed together. When she’d delivered files earlier, she’d caught Alexander—normally composed and unreadable—smiling at the woman like a lovestruck fool.

The woman.

Even after Evelyn had finished her documentation procedures, the door to Alexander's office remained closed.

Recalling Natalie's words, she hesitated briefly before deciding to investigate. Having come all this way to Titan Capital Group, she felt obligated to greet Alexander properly.

Her knuckles never touched the wood.

The door swung open before she could knock, revealing a disheveled woman with sleep-mussed hair and a faint crease marking her cheek. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, her entire posture radiating exhaustion as though freshly roused from slumber.

Alexander's office concealed a private sanctuary behind its polished doors—a compact resting area complete with washing facilities and a walk-in wardrobe, designed for his occasional overnight stays.

Evelyn knew it intimately. She'd napped there herself during late-night work sessions.

The implication struck like a physical blow.

That space was Alexander's personal retreat.

Her stomach twisted. "How could he let another woman sleep there? What exactly happened behind that closed door..."

She was the girl in the photograph Alexander had tucked away in his wallet.

The image captured her at sixteen or seventeen, cheeks still soft with youthful roundness.

It must have been taken years ago.

Now, that lingering baby fat had melted away, leaving behind delicate, refined features. Her face was untouched by makeup, radiating a natural purity.

Evelyn hadn’t encountered a woman who looked so effortlessly stunning in ages.

This was Isabella.

A heavy weight settled in Evelyn’s chest. This was Isabella—Alexander’s first love, the woman who had once held his heart.

###Chapter 470 Unspoken Doubts

What did that make her, then?

Hadn’t Alexander declared his love for her for an entire decade?

Without uttering a single word, Evelyn turned on her heel and walked away.

This was, after all, his company. As Alexander’s wife, causing a scene here would be inappropriate—it could damage his reputation.

She had to think of his position.

Perhaps it was better to wait until he returned home tonight. Then, they could talk properly.

Watching Evelyn leave so abruptly, Isabella found it strange.

She murmured under her breath, "Why didn’t she come in? Did she mistake the office?"

Inside, Alexander’s voice carried curiosity. "Isabella, what’s wrong?"

She turned back, flashing him a sweet smile. "I just saw a stunning woman. Your company really is filled with beauties."

Alexander didn’t take the bait. He had little interest in other women, though he did acknowledge the skewed gender ratio in the executive offices. He assumed she was referring to one of the assistants.

"Is this about my feelings or my career?" Isabella laughed lightly, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup. "Career-wise, I want to join Titan Capital Group and work as your assistant. Would that be acceptable?"

"Isabella." Alexander sighed, rubbing his temple. "Don’t joke like that. You can’t be my assistant."

She rose from her seat, shutting the office door with deliberate softness before returning to face him. Leaning forward, she rested her elbows on his desk, chin propped on her hands. "Do you think I’m overqualified? That working under you would be beneath me?"

Her eyes sparkled with mischief, lips curving into an innocent smile.

"Then pay me more. It’s not like you can’t afford it."

Alexander exhaled, pinching the bridge of his nose. "You—a world-renowned violinist—coming to Titan Capital as my assistant? Your fans would storm the building if they found out."

"You flatter me," she teased, twirling a lock of her dark hair. "That charity concert was a one-time thing. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be so broke I can’t even repay what I owe you."

At that, he set his pen down. "I told you, forget about the money. We don’t keep tabs between us."

Isabella tucked her hair behind her ear, expression turning serious. "You sponsored my education out of kindness. I can’t keep taking advantage of that."

The weight of Rachel’s words lingered in the air.

The Powell family. We’re engaged. It’s not unreasonable to expect him to help settle my debts, is it?

Alexander’s expression darkened. "Isabella, don’t force yourself into this. If you don’t want to marry him, don’t. Dominic has a criminal record. He’s not the right man for you."

Stepping out of Titan Capital Group, Evelyn felt strangely detached, her thoughts scattered.

Claire had called, insisting on seeing her.

Now that Claire’s pregnancy had progressed, her movements were slower, less fluid. Without hesitation, Evelyn hailed a cab and headed straight to her friend’s home.

Ever since the accident, Alexander had forbidden her from driving, his concern for her safety bordering on overprotective.

The moment Claire saw Evelyn, her eyes widened in alarm.

"You look terrible. What’s wrong?"

Evelyn’s face was ghostly pale, her usual vibrancy dulled.

She shook her head slightly, offering no explanation.

She hadn’t pieced everything together yet. There was no point burdening Claire with half-formed suspicions.

She would wait until she got home, until she could confront Alexander properly. The last thing she wanted was to make a scene over what might just be a misunderstanding.

Evelyn forced a smile. "What did you want to talk about?"

###Chapter 471 A Costly Favor

The evening light filtered through the curtains as Claire handed the gilded invitation to Evelyn.

"I've got my eye on something special at tonight's auction," Claire said, resting a hand on her swollen belly. "But you know how I feel about crowded places these days."

Evelyn took the invitation, her fingers brushing against the embossed lettering. The Powell family's emblem stood out in gold foil.

Of course it was them again.

"What caught your attention?" Evelyn asked, flipping open the invitation.

"A bracelet," Claire replied, her voice soft but determined. "With only two months left, I think I deserve a little reward for what's coming."

Evelyn smiled. Claire had always been one for meaningful gestures.

Giving birth was no small feat. If a piece of jewelry could make the ordeal feel more dignified, who was she to judge?

Then she saw the price tag.

Fifty million dollars.

Her breath hitched.

What kind of bracelet could possibly cost that much?

It was practically daylight robbery.

"Don't look so shocked yet," Claire said with a knowing smile. "There's more."

Evelyn braced herself.

If this was just the beginning, what else was coming?

The auction hadn't even started, and already her pulse was racing.

She had a feeling this night would be anything but ordinary.

"Evelyn, you absolutely must get this for me, please!"

Evelyn accepted the card with a thoughtful expression. Claire must have received a generous settlement after her divorce from Lucas to be spending so extravagantly.

Go ahead and buy it! she decided. Nothing matters more than happiness. Besides, what’s the point of money if not to spend it?

Claire’s voice was bright with excitement. "It’s just an auction, but the guest list is filled with Cresthaven’s elite. Is Alexander free to accompany you? Make sure you dress to impress him!"

Lately, Claire had heard whispers circulating through Cresthaven’s social circles.

As Evelyn’s closest friend, she couldn’t help but worry that Alexander and Evelyn’s relationship might be suffering.

Alexander…

Evelyn’s chest tightened, and she remained silent.

Apparently, Claire had been indulging in too much leisure time at home. She was practically buzzing with excitement as she summoned a styling team to transform Evelyn, treating her like a living doll.

The stylists began with a full-body pampering session, followed by meticulous makeup application. Evelyn sat obediently before the mirror, letting them work their magic.

After careful deliberation, the lead stylist presented an exquisite ivory satin gown, draping it before her.

It looked as though it had been crafted specifically for Evelyn, flawlessly complementing her elegance.

"Adrian was my lead stylist during my modeling days!" Claire gushed. "So many celebrities swear by his work!"

The afternoon sun streamed through the boutique windows as Claire adjusted the final touches on Evelyn's gown.

"Adrian is absolutely brilliant," Claire gushed, stepping back to admire her handiwork. "Every A-list celebrity in Cresthaven fights for his appointments. I practically had to kidnap him today since he was free. Trust me, Evelyn - you'll be the most dazzling woman at that auction."

Evelyn studied her reflection, running her hands over the intricate beadwork. The emerald-green silk hugged her figure perfectly, the plunging neckline accentuated her collarbones without being indecent.

"Are we attending a charity gala or the Miss Universe pageant?" Evelyn quipped, twisting to see the open back design.

But she couldn't deny the effect. The elegant drape of fabric, the way the light caught the delicate embroidery - it made her stand taller. For the first time since that disastrous lunch meeting at Titan Capital, she felt like herself again.

At three months pregnant, her bump was barely noticeable beneath the expertly tailored dress. The silhouette made her look regal rather than maternal.

Claire's eyes sparkled with approval as she handed Evelyn a matching clutch. "Alexander won't recognize his own wife," she teased, nudging Evelyn toward her phone. "Call him. Let him pick up this masterpiece."

Evelyn hesitated, thumb hovering over Alexander's contact. The line rang... then went to voicemail.

Her smile faltered as she lowered the device. "It's fine," she said too quickly, tucking the phone away. "I'll grab a cab. He probably got held up at that investor meeting."

She vaguely remembered Alexander mentioning an important presentation today. Still, the hollow feeling in her chest had nothing to do with hunger.

###Chapter 472 A Fateful Invitation

Claire frowned. She had hoped Alexander would accompany Evelyn, which was precisely why she had spent hours meticulously styling her for the occasion.

A small romantic gesture like this could reignite old flames. With tonight's auction attended by Cresthaven's elite, Evelyn would undoubtedly make Alexander proud as his date.

But now, it appeared Alexander wasn’t coming.

Claire hesitated. Was it safe for Evelyn to attend the Powell family’s event alone? Dominic Powell had a dangerous reputation—one that made even the bravest hesitate.

After a moment’s thought, Claire said, "Evelyn, maybe you should skip this one."

"Why?" Evelyn asked, confused. "Don’t you want that bracelet anymore?"

"I can live without it. You might not realize who’s hosting this auction. It’s the Powells—and their history isn’t exactly clean."

Seeing Evelyn’s blank expression, Claire elaborated, "You’ve only recently reconnected with your family, so you might not know Cresthaven’s darker side."

"The Powells were once deeply involved in organized crime. They’re obscenely wealthy now, but rumors say some of the items up for auction tonight might belong in a museum—or worse, were stolen."

The afternoon sun streamed through the hospital windows, casting golden patterns on the floor. Evelyn Carter sat beside Claire Dawson's bed, her fingers tracing the delicate embroidery on the auction invitation.

Claire's eyes sparkled with excitement. "You have to see this bracelet, Evelyn! It's said to bring good fortune to expecting mothers."

Evelyn studied the Powell family crest embossed on the card. Unlike other wealthy families who hid behind polished reputations, the Powells flaunted their controversial dealings with arrogant transparency.

She arched a brow. "So? I'm just bidding on jewelry. How does that put me at risk?"

Claire leaned forward, lowering her voice. "Do you know how the Powells rebuilt their empire? They pinned every scandal on their youngest son. Dominic Powell was only seventeen when he took the fall. He just got out of prison—after ten years."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. Today was Dominic's twenty-seventh birthday. This auction? A twisted celebration, with all proceeds "compensating" his lost decade.

Julian Mercer returned then, balancing a paper bag of warm pastries. His smile was polite as he nodded at Evelyn. "Afternoon."

Then his entire demeanor softened as he offered Claire a glazed donut. "Fresh from the bakery downstairs."

Evelyn's grip tightened on the invitation. She'd survived being framed by Vanessa Hart. But Dominic? Betrayed by his own blood.

Claire sighed. "Maybe skip the auction. Without Alexander around, things could get complicated if you cross paths with the Powells."

Evelyn's lips curved into a determined smile. "Childbirth is sacred. If this bracelet brings you joy, it's yours." She stood, smoothing her skirt. "I'm just there to bid. Not to dance with vipers."

The invitation crinkled in her palm. Some shadows, she knew, clung tighter than prison walls.

Claire frowned slightly, her lips pursing in displeasure. "You don't speak to me the same way you do with Evelyn."

The air between them grew tense, charged with unspoken words. Claire crossed her arms, her gaze sharp and probing.

Alexander sighed, running a hand through his dark hair. "It's not what you think," he said, though his voice lacked conviction.

Claire wasn't convinced. She had noticed the way his tone softened whenever Evelyn's name was mentioned. The way his eyes flickered with something deeper—something she couldn't quite place.

"You're different around her," Claire pressed, stepping closer. "And I don't like it."

Alexander's jaw tightened. He knew she was right, but admitting it would only complicate things further.

"Let's not do this now," he muttered, turning away.

But Claire wasn't ready to let it go. "Why? Because you don't have an answer?"

The silence stretched between them, heavy and suffocating.

Finally, Alexander turned back to her, his expression unreadable. "It's complicated."

Claire scoffed. "That's not good enough."

She wanted more—needed more. But Alexander wasn't ready to give it to her.

Not yet.

Maybe not ever.

The realization stung, but she refused to let it show. Instead, she straightened her shoulders and met his gaze head-on.

"Fine," she said coolly. "But don't expect me to pretend I don't see it."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked away, leaving Alexander standing alone in the dimly lit hallway.

His thoughts drifted to Evelyn, as they often did.

And for the first time, he wondered if Claire was right.

Maybe he was different around her.

Maybe that was the problem.

###Chapter 473 An Unexpected Encounter

Julian's voice was barely above a whisper. "You're not like anyone else."

Evelyn could sense the special affection Julian held for Claire, though Claire likely only viewed him as a younger sibling.

Even though Evelyn was no longer married to Lucas, she still needed Julian. The timing of Claire's pregnancy was delicate. If Lucas paid too much attention, he might uncover the truth.

As night descended, the city center pulsed with neon lights and rhythmic beats.

Evelyn hailed a cab to the auction. The venue was packed with high-profile guests, each dressed in their finest.

Luxury vehicles glided past one after another, yet Evelyn arrived in a simple taxi.

This was an event for the elite—no one would spare a glance for an ordinary cab. But the moment Evelyn stepped out, all eyes snapped toward her.

She was radiant.

Evelyn rarely made public appearances. Most knew her by reputation, few had ever seen her in person.

So when she walked into the gala, poised and striking, whispers erupted like wildfire.

Evelyn stepped out of the car with effortless grace, handing the driver a generous tip before turning toward the dazzling entrance. The neon lights caught the delicate angles of her face, casting an ethereal glow around her.

Several passersby were so mesmerized that they walked straight into the glass doors, only to recover with flushed cheeks and forced laughter, pretending nothing had happened as they exchanged awkward pleasantries.

At the entrance, Evelyn presented her invitation to the security guard, who gave her a respectful nod and stepped aside.

The ballroom was even more breathtaking than she had anticipated. Swathes of silk and crystal adorned the space, transforming it into something out of a fairy tale—like a scene from the most extravagant wedding.

The moment she stepped inside, the hum of conversation reached her ears.

Nearly every whisper was about Dominic Powell.

"Did you hear? Dominic had blood on his hands before he even turned twenty. Can you imagine? A killer at that age?"

"Well, what do you expect from the Powells? Their family has always been ruthless. It’s no surprise they raised a monster."

"Someone like him should’ve rotted in prison. Now that he’s free… I swear, Cresthaven won’t be the same."

"And poor Isabella Morgan—engaged to that devil. What a tragedy."

Evelyn listened, her expression unreadable, as she accepted a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. Her fingers tightened around the stem as she considered the whispers swirling around her.

The murmurs around her were sharp and unrelenting.

"You think she's tragic? The Morgans made their fortune dirty, working hand-in-hand with the Powells back then. They're just as guilty—no saints here." A voice dripped with disdain.

"Exactly. When the Morgans collapsed, they left behind a mountain of debt. The real victims were their creditors. Years of hard-earned savings—gone in an instant."

Evelyn absorbed every word, piecing together the puzzle in her mind.

The Powells, desperate to cleanse their reputation, had thrown the Morgans under the bus. A scapegoat to bear the weight of their sins.

The Morgans had resisted, of course, but under the Powells' iron grip, they'd had no choice. Overnight, their empire crumbled. Assets seized. Lives destroyed.

Only one thread remained—a fragile engagement, the Powells' hollow promise to Isabella. A leash disguised as protection.

At the reception desk, guests were checking in. Evelyn handed over her invitation.

It bore Claire's name, a favor from her closest friend.

"Ms. Dawson, the auction is to your left. The ballroom is straight ahead." The attendant smiled brightly.

Evelyn's gaze swept across the grand hall.

Two worlds glittered before her—one of calculated bids and whispered deals, the other of swirling gowns and champagne flutes.

The night hummed with possibility.

And danger.

The grand ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers, but Evelyn Carter found no joy in the spectacle.

She barely registered the swirling couples or the orchestra's waltz. Her gaze kept drifting toward the auction area, where she planned to wait quietly for the main event.

Then she saw it.

The guest list lay open on a velvet podium, two names leaping out like electric shocks:

[Alexander Whitmore]

And directly beneath, in elegant script:

[Isabella Morgan]

Her breath hitched.

The last time those names had appeared together was in a society column announcing their childhood friendship. Before prison. Before everything changed.

The champagne flute trembled in her hand as distant laughter echoed through the marble halls.

###Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn) novel

The air smelled of gardenias and whispered secrets.

Across the ballroom, Alexander Whitmore adjusted his cufflinks, unaware his entire world was about to shift.

Isabella Morgan's laughter tinkled beside him, her hand resting lightly on his arm.

Neither noticed the woman in emerald green watching them from the shadows.

Evelyn's knuckles whitened around her clutch.

Some reunions were never meant to happen.

And yet—

The auctioneer's gavel sounded.

Fate had other plans.

###Chapter 474 She Loved Him

Evelyn froze. Isabella?

She hesitated briefly before forcing a casual tone. "Is the Whitmore family here tonight?"

The attendant nodded enthusiastically. "You mean Mr. Alexander Whitmore? He arrived with his wife."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "His wife?"

Unaware of Evelyn's connection, the attendant beamed. "Yes, Mrs. Whitmore is absolutely stunning—impossible to miss in a crowd."

Evelyn inhaled sharply, her chest tightening. The edges of her vision blurred slightly. She spun around, scanning the glittering ballroom for Alexander.

Then she felt it—the weight of someone's stare.

She turned.

Ethan.

She didn’t know how long he’d been watching her. Dressed in an ivory suit that made him stand out, he looked paler than usual, the lingering effects of his illness softening his sharp features into something almost delicate.

Their gazes locked. The second Ethan saw her, his expression shifted—raw admiration flashing in his eyes.

She was radiant.

And he couldn’t look away.

Ethan turned his head, murmuring something to the person beside him before striding toward Evelyn.

His voice was low, laced with warning. "Honestly, you shouldn’t have come tonight."

He stopped in front of her, his gaze unreadable. "Evelyn, you can still walk away. I don’t want to see you hurt."

Confusion flickered across her face. "What do you mean?"

A cold smirk curved his lips. "You want to know? Then let me show you."

Before she could react, his fingers closed around her wrist.

Evelyn stiffened, instinctively trying to pull away.

But the delicate straps of her heels and the restrictive silk of her gown made movement difficult. Before she could break free, he had already dragged her onto the dance floor.

The grand ballroom was a vision of old-world elegance. Crystal chandeliers cast shimmering light like scattered diamonds across the room.

Multicolored spotlights danced across the walls, blending with the sea of crimson rose petals strewn across the floor. The air was thick with the scent of roses and expensive perfume.

Then her breath caught.

At the center of it all stood a man in a tailored black suit.

Alexander.

Her pulse stuttered.

His presence commanded the room, his sharp features illuminated by the golden glow.

And his eyes—dark, intense—were already locked onto hers.

The silk fabric of her dress clung to most of her bare back as they swayed across the polished dance floor.

Under the glittering chandeliers, Alexander Whitmore and Isabella Morgan moved in perfect harmony, their figures creating a breathtaking vision.

Every eye in the ballroom was drawn to them—the striking man with his commanding presence and the radiant woman who matched him step for step.

Their gazes locked, shutting out the world around them.

Evelyn Carter felt her breath catch.

Isabella.

There was no mistaking her. The realization settled heavily in Evelyn's chest, leaving behind a hollow ache she couldn't ignore.

Alexander's first love had returned.

The way he looked at Isabella—completely absorbed, utterly captivated—told Evelyn everything. They had met in his office earlier that day, and now, mere hours later, he had brought her to this gala without hesitation.

Isabella had transformed since their daytime encounter. Gone was the simple elegance of her casual attire. Now, she was a vision in an intricately beaded gown, vibrant as a blood-red rose in full bloom.

It was astonishing how one woman could embody such contrasting allure—demure by daylight, dazzling by night.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her champagne flute.

She had believed what she shared with Alexander was special. He had been everything she'd ever wanted in a partner—strong, devoted, passionate.

But seeing him now, his attention wholly consumed by another, made her question everything.

The scars of past heartbreaks had taught Evelyn Carter to guard her heart fiercely. Yet against all odds, she had willingly given it to Alexander Whitmore.

His unwavering care and quiet devotion had slowly chipped away at her defenses. What had begun as a marriage of convenience—a safe harbor in her storm—had become something far deeper.

Day by day, moment by moment, Alexander had woven himself into the fabric of her life.

She loved him.

She loved the way he anticipated her needs before she voiced them. She loved the steady certainty of his presence, the way the world felt simpler when he was near. With Alexander, she could breathe. He carried the weight so she didn’t have to.

But now, as she cradled the life growing inside her, doubt crept in.

Had his heart changed?

The man who had been her anchor—was he slipping away?

###Chapter 475 Perfect Pair

Evelyn found herself lost in thought, questioning where things had gone wrong.

Had she made any mistakes? The answer was clear—she hadn't.

Recalling the whispers circulating through Cresthaven, her gaze dropped to her stomach.

Did Alexander doubt her?

It seemed their relationship had shifted after Ethan Caldwell had taken her away for over twenty days.

Was it possible Alexander also believed the child she carried wasn’t his?

The room buzzed with chatter, but Evelyn heard none of it.

Her eyes remained fixed on the couple twirling gracefully at the center of the stage.

They looked like the perfect pair.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, her heart sinking deeper with each passing second.

So absorbed in their dance, they hadn’t even noticed her presence.

A heavy weight settled in her chest.

Perhaps she was the outsider here.

The pain in his chest was unbearable as he watched her. Ethan Caldwell's voice was barely above a whisper. "Evelyn, do you regret it? Does it hurt this much?"

Evelyn Carter turned slowly, meeting his gaze with a fragile smile that didn't reach her eyes.

"Regret?" Her voice was steady, though her fingers trembled slightly. "I made my choice. There's no room for regret."

The path had been hers to walk. If she had stumbled, she could always turn back. Regret was pointless—every step had shaped her. Even the pain had its purpose.

The memories, though bittersweet, had once been beautiful.

If given the chance, she would choose Alexander Whitmore all over again. He had given her moments of warmth, security, and love—things she would never erase, no matter how it ended.

A deep breath steadied her, but the tears still threatened. She refused to let them fall.

She wouldn’t make a scene. Not here. Not in front of everyone.

Ethan watched her struggle, guilt gnawing at him. If he had known it would wound her this deeply, he would never have—

"Evelyn," he said urgently, stepping closer. "My offer still stands. We can start fresh. Forget Alexander. Let me protect you. That’s what a man should do."

His words only made her lips curl into something cold and mocking.

"So this was your plan?" Her voice was sharp. "Show me this, break me, and then swoop in as my savior?" She shook her head. "You had my heart once, Ethan. You crushed it. There’s no second chance."

The rumors in Cresthaven—that the child she carried was his—had all stemmed from his own lips.

He had fed the whispers, let them grow into something monstrous.

If her marriage to Alexander shattered, Ethan was just as guilty as anyone else.

His methods were underhanded. Despicable.

Her eyes burned with unshed tears, but now, beneath the sorrow, fury simmered. She hated him in that moment.

Across the room, the music faded.

Isabella Morgan’s forehead glistened with a sheen of sweat. Alexander reached for a handkerchief from a passing waiter and handed it to her with a murmured word.

Evelyn looked away before she could see more.

###Chapter 476 Forbidden Glances

The golden chandeliers cast a warm glow over the grand ballroom as Isabella Morgan leaned closer to Alexander Whitmore. "Tell me," she murmured, her voice laced with playful challenge, "would any man stand by and watch his fiancée dance with another man at his own birthday celebration?"

Alexander arched a brow. "Dominic Powell has a reputation for a short temper. Aren’t you worried he’ll make a scene?"

Isabella waved a dismissive hand. "That’s precisely why I need you. In all of Cresthaven, you might be the only person he wouldn’t dare cross."

The Morgan and Powell families had been bound by an engagement contract for years—signed when Isabella was barely fourteen.

Now, over a decade later, the thought of marrying Dominic repulsed her.

Truthfully, no woman in her right mind would willingly tie herself to a man with his violent history.

But the Morgans had fallen from grace long ago. With no remaining influence, Isabella stood alone against the Powells.

Her only lifeline? Alexander.

She had orchestrated this dance with one purpose—

Yet as the music faded, no enraged fiancé stormed into the ballroom.

Alexander opened his mouth to speak when his gaze snagged on a pair of figures at the far end of the corridor.

Evelyn Carter and Ethan Caldwell stood bathed in moonlight, their bodies angled toward each other. Evelyn's eyes shimmered with unshed tears while Ethan's expression warred between longing and restraint.

To any onlooker, they looked like star-crossed lovers torn apart by cruel fate.

Alexander's jaw tightened, his hands curling into fists at his sides. The air around him turned glacial.

Isabella followed his line of sight and immediately recognized Evelyn—the same woman who had nearly interrupted their meeting that morning.

Even now, standing motionless, Evelyn commanded attention effortlessly. The soft glow of the overhead lights kissed her porcelain skin, the delicate pearl earrings at her lobes enhancing her ethereal beauty.

She was elegance personified—the kind of woman who made others pale in comparison.

"Is that your nephew?" Isabella asked casually, nodding toward Ethan.

The question hung between them, heavy with unspoken implications.

Leaning forward with her elbow resting on the table, Isabella studied Evelyn with narrowed eyes. "That woman sitting across from him... Could she be his wife?"

Alexander's jaw clenched.

He snatched a champagne flute from a passing waiter and downed it in one swift motion, his stormy gaze never leaving the couple across the room.

Through gritted teeth, he bit out, "She's my wife."

Isabella had already pieced it together.

She sighed dramatically, tilting her head. "Oh dear... So your wife is seeing someone else?"

The deliberate phrasing made Alexander's expression turn glacial. With a sharp exhale, he slammed the empty glass onto the table hard enough to make nearby guests flinch.

The air around him crackled with barely restrained fury.

As he moved to storm over, Isabella caught the edge of his tailored jacket.

"Half of Cresthaven's elite is here tonight," she murmured. "If you make a scene now, won't that just prove there's truth to the rumors?"

###Chapter 477 A Seductress

Isabella Morgan tilted her head slightly, her long lashes fluttering with practiced innocence. The burnt orange of her dress made her golden skin glow, while the neon lights caught the crimson of her lips, transforming her into a vision of temptation.

Before returning to Cresthaven, Isabella had heard whispers about Alexander Whitmore’s marriage. The entire flight, she had wondered—what kind of woman had finally captured his attention?

In their world, marriages were rarely about love. They were transactions, alliances between powerful families. Rumor had it that Alexander’s wife was the heiress of a prominent Cresthaven dynasty, so Isabella had assumed it was just another business arrangement.

But the way Alexander was acting now told a different story.

She knew him better than most—they had grown up together. Alexander was always composed, his emotions locked away behind an impenetrable mask. Even in the most chaotic situations, he remained unshaken.

Yet now, she saw something dangerous flicker in his gaze. Anger. Possessiveness.

It made her wonder—was his marriage more than just a contract?

Alexander didn’t move, his stance unyielding. Seizing the opportunity, Isabella stepped closer. "I recognize a few faces here," she murmured, her voice honeyed. "Would you introduce me?"

The Morgan family might have fallen from grace, but at their peak, they had been one of Cresthaven’s most influential dynasties. With a calculated smile, she reached out, her fingers brushing toward his arm.

"I'm your companion for the evening. We shared a dance. What's the issue?" Isabella dismissed his hesitation, stepping closer with deliberate grace.

Alexander's brow furrowed. He had only danced with her to provoke Dominic into calling off their engagement.

But presenting her to others would suggest something far more intimate between them. When Isabella reached for his arm again, Alexander retreated a step.

A flicker of irritation crossed Isabella's face, but she smoothed it away. Her gaze slid to where Evelyn had been standing moments ago. "Your wife and nephew vanished. Where could they have slipped off to at this hour?"

Alexander followed her line of sight. Evelyn and Ethan were indeed gone. The air between them thickened with unspoken tension before Alexander turned on his heel, disinterested.

Isabella exhaled dramatically, eyeing the ornate clock on the wall. "The auction begins soon. Surely you won't abandon me now?"

Neither noticed the watcher.

In a dimly lit surveillance room, a man swirled amber liquid in his glass, surrounded by screens broadcasting the gala's every move—even the whispers carried.

Dominic's sharp, mocking smile glinted in the monitor's glow. The guards behind him stood frozen, barely breathing. His moods were mercurial—deceptively calm one second, volcanic the next.

A decade behind bars had only made him more unreadable.

The atmosphere in the room was thick with tension.

Dominic Powell wasn’t a man to be trifled with. His reputation for ruthlessness was well-known, and few dared to cross him. Yet, someone had foolishly challenged him—openly, brazenly.

His men had witnessed it all. Isabella Morgan, his fiancée, had danced with Alexander Whitmore. The audacity of it was staggering.

Given Dominic’s volatile temper, they expected retribution. Even with Alexander’s protection, Isabella wouldn’t escape unscathed.

But Dominic didn’t react as they anticipated.

Instead, his fingers hovered over the remote, pressing a button that froze the surveillance footage. The screen locked onto a woman—Isabella.

She was breathtaking in white satin, pearls glinting at her ears. Yet, her eyes were rimmed red, as if she had been crying.

A slow, dangerous smirk curled Dominic’s lips.

“She’s crying…” he murmured, his voice dripping with dark amusement.

Secret Longing: Finding Love After Betrayal (Evelyn)

###Chapter 478 Dominic’s Fascination with Evelyn

The security team surrounding them couldn’t hide their shock.

Dominic’s expression was sharp, almost predatory, yet his voice dripped with unexpected tenderness. The contradiction was jarring, leaving his men utterly confused.

This wasn’t the Dominic they knew.

Years behind bars had hardened him into an unfeeling force.

So why was he suddenly so intrigued by a woman he’d never met?

Instinct told them she was in danger.

No one who caught his eye ever walked away unscathed.

Dominic had a reputation—one built on cruelty and the thrill of breaking others.

At that moment, he reached for a glass filled with sapphire-colored liquor.

His teeth grazed the rim before he threw his head back, downing it in one swift motion. Some of the liquid escaped, trickling down his throat and staining his loosened collar, but he didn’t bother wiping it away.

A smirk curled at the corner of his lips, his gaze dark with amusement and something far more dangerous.

The bodyguard hesitated, confusion flickering across his face. "To Ms. Morgan?"

It was only natural to assume. After all, Isabella was engaged to Dominic. Sending her flowers would be expected.

Dominic’s icy gaze sliced through the air, his lips curling into a sneer as he uttered a single, cutting word. "Moron."

The bodyguard’s face drained of color.

A cold sweat broke out down his back as realization struck—he had overstepped. His voice shook with barely contained fear. "My apologies, Mr. Powell!"

Desperate to make amends, he reached for the flower.

But Dominic’s grip tightened abruptly, his dark eyes boring into the man like a predator sizing up prey.

The bodyguard bowed his head, his entire body trembling.

"Forgive me, Mr. Powell! Please!"

Dominic’s smile was slow, deliberate. "Forgive you? Of course."

Just as relief began to trickle in, Dominic lifted the flower to his lips, biting down on the stem with deliberate sensuality. His striking features took on a dangerous allure as he leaned back in his chair, lazily twirling the blossom between his fingers.

"Though," he mused, voice dripping with mock contemplation, "the color is dreadfully dull."

Dominic plucked the delicate bloom, crushing it beneath his polished shoe with deliberate nonchalance. "Well? What's your brilliant suggestion?"

The bodyguard hesitated, jaw clenched, before drawing a sleek blade from his sleeve. Without flinching, he pierced his own fingertip.

Crimson droplets splattered onto the pristine petals.

A collective inhale echoed from the dozen guards behind him.

The man’s face contorted in silent agony.

Dominic observed with icy detachment, his expression unreadable—a statue carved from indifference.

Minutes stretched before the bleeding ceased. Only then did Dominic chuckle, flicking the ruined flower aside. "Relax. It was a joke." He clapped the guard’s shoulder, lips curling. "You’re so dramatic."

The night air hummed with murmured conversations as guests mingled in glittering pairs. Evelyn sat apart, a shadow in the gilded auction hall, her gaze fixed on the display case where the emerald bracelet would soon appear.

Nathan had kept his distance all evening, a silent sentinel tracking her every move from across the room.

Midway through the bidding, the doors swung open. Alexander entered with Isabella on his arm, drawing whispers like moths to flame.

Secret Longing: A Love Reborn from Ashes (Evelyn) – 1/4

###Chapter 479 Whispers of Intrigue

His gaze instinctively sought out Evelyn. She was completely engrossed in the auction stage, seemingly oblivious to their arrival.

The item up for bid was a millennium-old masterpiece, its colors still vibrant despite the passage of time.

Flourishing Era, the painting was called—a priceless artifact that belonged in a museum. Yet here it was, displayed at the Powell family’s auction, drawing hushed murmurs of disbelief from the crowd.

"The Powells really do have shady connections. To possess even one piece like this is astonishing. This is the fifth treasure tonight, isn’t it?"

"Exactly! That’s why they say the Powells are obscenely wealthy. Just a few of these relics could make anyone’s fortune!"

"Where do they even get these things? Shouldn’t someone report them?"

"Are you out of your mind? This is the Powell family we’re talking about. You’ll disappear before they ever face consequences!"

Fear flickered across the faces of the onlookers, but their greed won out. One by one, they raised their paddles, bidding sums that left others breathless.

Evelyn, too, was captivated. She had never seen anything like this before…

The auctioneer’s voice rang out. "A rare treasure, ladies and gentlemen—smooth as silk, flawless in craftsmanship. The starting bid is thirty million dollars!"

"Thirty-two million!"

"Thirty-five million!"

The bids came in sporadically.

Recognizing the bracelet Claire had admired earlier, Evelyn wasted no time. "Fifty million!"

It was the first time she had spoken all evening. This bracelet was her sole target. Once she secured it, she intended to leave immediately.

The room fell into stunned silence at her bold offer.

After a few tense seconds, the auctioneer began the countdown. "Fifty million, going once! Fifty million, going twice—"

"Sixty million!"

Evelyn’s head snapped toward the voice. There, seated beside Alexander, was Isabella Morgan.

She had been the one to counter.

Evelyn’s eyes locked with Alexander’s across the room.

Tonight had been full of whispers.

Like how the Morgan family had fallen from grace years ago…

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the auction hall as the bidding war intensified.

It was common knowledge that Alexander Whitmore’s financial backing had allowed Isabella Morgan to complete her education.

After the Morgan family’s downfall, Isabella had been taken in by distant relatives—neighbors to the farmers who had raised Alexander. Their shared past was no secret.

Eighty million dollars.

Evelyn Carter’s fingers tightened around her paddle. The Morgan fortune had long been seized. Could Isabella really afford such an extravagant sum?

Or… would Alexander step in to buy the bracelet for her?

Evelyn lowered her gaze, a pang of discomfort twisting in her chest as she glanced away from the pair.

"Eighty million, going once. Eighty million, going twice—"

Her paddle lifted again. "Ninety million."

Guilt pricked at her. She hated taking something someone else cherished, but this bracelet belonged to Claire Dawson. She had to secure it for her.

That was the limit of the funds Claire had entrusted to her. If Isabella bid again…

"Ninety-five million!"

Isabella’s voice rang out, sharp with determination. Evelyn exhaled, closing her eyes in defeat.

Beside Isabella, Alexander’s expression darkened, his jaw tightening.

Evelyn batted her eyelashes with feigned innocence. "That bracelet is absolutely divine. It's rare to find something that matches my style so perfectly." She pouted slightly. "I don't have nearly enough funds for it, but you do, don't you, my dear benefactor?"

Alexander's expression darkened instantly. "Stop speaking nonsense."

Evelyn let out a playful laugh, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "You were the one who said I never have to repay you, that we don't keep tabs between us. So doesn't that make you my patron?" She tilted her head, her voice dripping with mock sweetness. "Or is it because I want the same bracelet your wife adores that you're suddenly being so stingy?" Her lips curled into a knowing smirk. "Don't forget—she humiliated you tonight. Consider this my way of getting revenge on your behalf."

The air between them crackled with tension as Alexander's jaw tightened. Evelyn merely smiled wider, twirling a strand of hair around her finger, waiting for his response.

###Chapter 480 The Auction Showdown

Alexander's fingers tightened around his champagne glass when Isabella mentioned Evelyn's past with Ethan.

No husband could stomach seeing his wife entangled with another man. Witnessing Evelyn seated beside Ethan moments ago had ignited an unfamiliar fire in his chest.

His stormy gaze cut through the crowd, locking onto the front row where she sat.

Evelyn wasn't looking at him anymore.

Under the scrutiny of high society, she lifted her paddle with effortless grace. "Ninety million!"

The emerald bracelet's appraisal value was fifty million. Claire had prepared eighty, but Evelyn was ready to cover the excess herself.

She wasn't one for public displays of rivalry. This uncharacteristic aggression intrigued him.

Does she truly want it that badly?

Isabella's voice sliced through his thoughts. "Ninety-one million."

Gasps rippled through the gilded hall. The bidding war had escalated beyond reason, and every eye was riveted to the two women.

Evelyn's spine straightened. Alexander recognized that stubborn tilt of her chin—the one that always preceded storms.

His lips curved.

Let the games begin.

The tension in the auction hall was palpable.

Bids flew back and forth, escalating rapidly.

Whispers spread through the crowd as spectators sensed the brewing rivalry.

All eyes were locked on the two determined bidders, wondering who would ultimately claim the coveted bracelet.

A heavy silence fell over the room for several tense seconds.

Alexander's voice cut through the quiet, sharp with irritation.

"She's mine. Who gave you the right to discipline her? If she needs punishing, that’s my responsibility—not yours."

Evelyn stiffened, caught off guard by his words.

He was defending her.

Isabella couldn’t comprehend why he would shield a wife who had betrayed him.

He must be under some kind of spell.

Alexander’s fingers twitched toward his pocket, instinctively reaching for his cigarettes.

Then he remembered—no smoking allowed.

Leaning back in his seat, his patience wore thin.

"Isabella, you’ve crossed a line."

She lifted her chin defiantly. "I simply want the bracelet. Is that a crime?"

The auctioneer raised his gavel, ready to call the next bid.

Alexander’s tone was icy. "By all means, try."

"However," Alexander's piercing gaze shifted away from her.

His voice held an icy finality, leaving no room for debate. "I'll fund your education, but I won't finance your extravagant tastes—not even as a loan."

The message was unmistakable. He refused to pay for the necklace.

Evelyn felt heat rush to her cheeks, her pride stinging.

This was beyond humiliating.

She pressed, "But I already won the bid! Everyone's watching—if I can't pay, what will they think? Are you trying to shame me?"

Just imagining the whispers made her stomach twist.

Surely Alexander wouldn’t do this to her. Their bond was deeper than this.

The auctioneer raised his gavel, poised for the final call.

Alexander’s eyes narrowed, lingering on the display case.

The emerald bracelet shimmered under the lights—elegant, delicate, undeniably feminine.

He leaned back, arms crossed, his tone deliberately indifferent. "My salary goes to my wife. If you want money, ask her."

Evelyn froze, her gaze snapping toward Isabella.

She found herself locked in a fierce bidding battle with Evelyn over an exquisite diamond bracelet. The irony wasn't lost on her - she might end up borrowing funds from the very woman she was competing against.

Isabella clenched her fists, frustration bubbling in her chest.

Alexander had claimed all his earnings went directly to Evelyn's accounts.

Since when did Evelyn have the authority to manage his finances?

The injustice burned like acid in Isabella's throat.

As the auctioneer raised his gavel for the final call, Alexander suddenly lifted his paddle with effortless grace.

"One hundred million."

The entire ballroom erupted into shocked whispers and gasps.

###Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn) novel

The air crackled with tension as all eyes turned toward their private booth. Isabella's nails dug into her palms, her pulse roaring in her ears. Across the room, Evelyn's crimson lips curved into a knowing smile that made Isabella's stomach twist.

Alexander's deep voice cut through the murmurs. "For my wife."

The declaration hung in the air like a challenge. Isabella felt the weight of hundreds of curious stares burning into her skin. Her cheeks flamed as she realized the entire elite society now witnessed her humiliation.

The auctioneer's gavel came down with finality. "Sold to Mr. Whitmore for one hundred million!"

Applause broke out, but Isabella only heard the blood rushing in her ears. She needed to escape before the tears welling in her eyes betrayed her. Pushing back her chair abruptly, she fled toward the marble pillars lining the grand hall.

Behind her, she heard Alexander's sharp intake of breath. "Rachel—"

But she was already gone, heels clicking a frantic rhythm against the polished floors. The scent of gardenias from the centerpieces turned cloying as she fought for air.

Tonight had revealed painful truths.

She was merely a spectator in Alexander and Evelyn's carefully choreographed marriage. A pawn in their games. A fool who'd believed she still held some claim to his heart.

The night breeze stung her cheeks as she burst through the terrace doors. Somewhere in the glittering city below, a church bell tolled midnight.

Perfect timing for reality's cruel awakening.

###Chapter 481 The Surprising Offer

All heads swiveled toward the bold bidder who'd just offered a staggering hundred million for the bracelet.

When they recognized Alexander Whitmore, no one batted an eye.

Evelyn Carter slowly lowered the paddle she'd been about to raise.

The bidding had far surpassed any reasonable valuation.

It made no sense to keep competing for something so overpriced.

She'd tried her best - Claire Dawson couldn't possibly fault her for bowing out now.

Perhaps Alexander truly cared for Isabella Morgan after all.

Dropping a hundred million publicly just to please her? That spoke volumes.

A hundred million dollars. How many people could casually throw around that kind of money?

Evelyn counted herself lucky they'd only recently married.

She liked him well enough, but her heart wasn't completely his yet.

The only tragedy was their unborn child, whose father's affections had already shifted elsewhere...

Women should absolutely pursue their own careers!

After Claire's divorce, she appeared to be thriving.

Perhaps Evelyn should take inspiration from Claire's boldness and strength to consider her next steps.

Isabella had been on edge the entire evening.

Her stomach twisted with anxiety that the auctioneer might close the bidding before she could secure the piece. The thought of having to borrow from Vanessa was mortifying.

When Alexander placed his bid, relief flooded through her.

Truthfully, the bracelet wasn’t something she adored. It was the rush of competition—and the fact that Vanessa desired it—that had driven her.

A satisfied smile curved Isabella’s lips. "Alexander, thank you for winning it for me."

A hundred million was an outrageous sum. Naturally, no one dared to counter.

Then, realization struck.

"You told me your salary goes to your wife," she murmured, tilting her head. "Where did you get this kind of money?"

A warm flutter filled her chest.

Was this the quiet, understated romance of an older man? Claiming to have nothing, yet secretly securing a lavish gift just for her.

The thought made Evelyn's lips curve into a genuine smile, her eyes sparkling with anticipation as they met Alexander's.

"Who said it's for you?"

His words shattered her hopeful expression like fragile glass.

Alexander reclined in his chair, his gaze flickering over her with cool detachment. "Didn't you notice my wife likes it? Naturally, I'm buying it for her."

Evelyn's smile froze, disbelief flooding her features.

"What are you talking about? She was just caught in a scandal, entangled with your nephew! How could you—"

Alexander scoffed. "Really? Did they embrace? Hold hands? They were merely talking. A scandal?"

Watching Evelyn converse with Ethan had unsettled him, but as her husband, he would respect her.

She was only speaking with an old flame. It wasn’t a crime.

Evelyn had chosen him, but he refused to let their marriage become a cage.

Besides, she and Ethan had shared seven years together. As rivals, Alexander understood the weight of that history. Though it gnawed at him, he wouldn’t begrudge her this.

His unwavering stance left Isabella speechless.

Secret Longing: A Love Beyond Chains…

###Chapter 482 The Unexpected Twist

Isabella crossed her arms, her lips forming a petulant pout. "Alexander, you're completely under her spell!"

His eyebrow arched in response. "A spell? Perhaps. But answer me this—Evelyn is my wife. What gives you the right to disrespect her in my presence?"

His displeasure was palpable.

Tonight, Isabella had repeatedly made snide remarks about Evelyn, and as her husband, Alexander refused to let it slide. "Isabella, Evelyn is kind-hearted and wonderful. She doesn’t deserve your disdain."

As he spoke, his gaze instinctively searched for Evelyn, but she was nowhere in sight.

A flicker of surprise crossed his features. She left already? Without me?

They hadn’t even exchanged a single word tonight.

Just then, an attendant approached hesitantly.

Alexander assumed it was time to settle the payment—after all, he had just spent a staggering hundred million on a bracelet.

But the attendant’s next words made his expression darken.

"The auction organizers have decided to retract the sale of the bracelet."

His jaw tightened. Is this some kind of joke?

He had never heard of an auction house backing out of a finalized bid.

The attendant, sensing his rising anger, quickly added, "As an apology, we’d like to offer you a complimentary gift."

Alexander barely spared it a glance. "Keep it."

The attendant pressed on nervously. "Please, it’s a token of goodwill from the organizers."

With a dismissive sigh, he finally looked.

Two tickets.

Not just any tickets—VIP passes to Cresthaven’s annual fireworks gala, the most coveted seats in the city.

After a brief hesitation, he accepted them.

A memory surfaced—months ago, beneath a sky ablaze with fireworks by the shore, he and Evelyn had confessed their love.

Maybe this time, watching the fireworks together would rekindle what they’d lost.

Isabella wanted Alexander to give her a ticket, but before she could blink, he had already tucked them away.

The attendant turned to her with a polite smile. "Ms. Morgan. Mr. Powell requests your presence."

At those words, Isabella's instincts flared to life.

Everyone knew the Powell family was hosting tonight's auction. So… the attendant had to be referring to Dominic, her fiancé.

"Why does he want to see me?" Isabella pressed her lips together, an uneasy weight settling in her chest.

She and Dominic had been engaged for over a decade, yet they had never once met.

Whispers painted him as cold, unpredictable, and impossible to please. After spending ten years behind bars, who knew what kind of man he had become?

Their engagement had been arranged when she was just a child—barely ten years old. Back then, the Morgan family had already crumbled, leaving her to fend for herself among distant relatives.

The Powells had been the ones to ruin her family, yet they had never lifted a finger to help her.

Naturally, she held no affection for this stranger who was supposed to be her future husband. All she wanted was to sever this cursed engagement and be free of him.

Now, hearing that Dominic wanted to see her, dread coiled tight in her stomach.

"Ms. Morgan, that was an exquisite waltz."

The staff member's smile was polite but carried an edge. "I'm referring to the one you danced with Mr. Caldwell in front of everyone. Wasn't it all to catch Mr. Powell's attention? Congratulations—it worked."

At those words, Isabella's gaze instinctively sought out Alexander.

"Alexander, will you come with me?"

With him by her side, she could face anything. He had always been her anchor, the one who made her feel safe.

Before Alexander could respond, the staff member cut in sharply. "Ms. Morgan, Mr. Powell was very clear—he will see only you."

###Chapter 483 The Sinister Encounter

Alexander's voice was cool as ice. "Go on. I'll stay right here. Just call if you need me."

Having brought Isabella along, he felt responsible for her safety tonight. His unspoken promise hung in the air—he had her back.

Isabella exhaled softly and trailed after the staff member.

They weaved through the glittering banquet hall, the noise fading as they turned down a deserted corridor. The sudden silence prickled at her skin.

"Is this the right way?" she asked, her voice tight.

The attendant didn't answer. He halted abruptly and motioned toward a door with a stiff nod.

Isabella pushed it open.

Behind her, the staff member's face twisted into something like pity as she stepped inside.

Darkness swallowed her whole. The oppressive blackness made her stomach clench.

The room was empty.

A cold realization slithered down her spine—she'd been played.

Isabella Morgan felt an eerie chill crawl up her spine.

Without warning, a single beam of light flickered to life, casting elongated shadows across the bare walls. The silhouette of a man materialized within the dim glow.

Her breath hitched.

Was that… Dominic?

Why was he lurking in the shadows like this?

Even after a decade behind bars, his striking features remained untouched by time. The sharp angles of his profile could rival any Hollywood heartthrob.

Isabella couldn’t tear her gaze away.

She didn’t notice the faint rustling at her feet.

Something cold and sinuous brushed against her ankle.

Her blood turned to ice.

Snakes.

At least four of them, coiled and ready, their emerald eyes gleaming in the darkness.

A scream tore from her throat as she spun toward the door, fingers scrambling for the knob.

Locked.

Panic clawed at her chest.

She was trapped.

Why were there serpents slithering across the luxurious hotel suite?

In mere moments, the cold, scaly creatures had begun coiling around Isabella's legs.

Her breath hitched, terror locking her muscles in place.

She tried to shake them off, but the more she twisted, the tighter their grip became.

From the waist down, she was completely ensnared. Every nerve screamed in silent panic.

Tears welled in her eyes, but she bit back any sound.

"Dominic," she whispered through clenched teeth, squeezing her eyes shut. "This is your doing, isn't it?"

She knew he could hear her.

The rumors about his twisted nature were proving true. Was this his revenge for dancing with Alexander at the gala?

Isabella’s resolve hardened. She would never marry this monster. One wrong move, and she might not live to see morning.

"Call them off!" Her voice trembled, fraying at the edges. She was seconds from shattering.

Her entire body quaked, yet she couldn’t budge—frozen in place by sheer dread.

"If these snakes aren’t gone in the next ten seconds," she forced out, "I swear I’ll have the entire police force at your door—"

Yes, Evelyn could call the police!

The thought struck her like lightning.

Her fingers trembled as she fumbled through her bag, desperate to find her phone.

Alexander was just outside. If she could just reach him—

But the moment the screen flickered to life, the snakes struck.

A slithering tongue grazed her skin, cold and slick.

Evelyn screamed.

Her phone clattered to the floor, the screen shattering on impact.

The serpents coiled tighter, their hisses filling the air.

###Chapter 484 The Serpents' Nightmare

Isabella felt her soul teetering on the edge of escape.

Dominic was merciless—no, beyond merciless. He was monstrous.

Just minutes ago, she had admired his sharp jawline in the dim light, thinking he must be devastatingly handsome beneath that cold exterior.

But his twisted preferences shattered that illusion. He wasn’t just cruel—he was depraved.

Tears spilled from Isabella’s eyes without permission. She hated crying, but her body betrayed her, the hot trails of fear streaking down her cheeks.

Dominic watched the live feed from the surveillance room, his lips curling into a slow, chilling smile.

His voice, smooth as velvet, dripped with mock sympathy. "These are my newest companions. They curl around me at night. So gentle, so devoted. Why do you tremble?"

The richness of his tone should have been alluring. Instead, it sent ice through her veins.

"I—I swear, I shouldn’t have danced with Alexander!"

Isabella was certain this was his revenge. She had crossed an invisible line tonight.

That single reckless moment—flirting with Alexander—must have ignited his fury.

She had humiliated him publicly on his birthday.

It was a thoughtless act.

But Evelyn never imagined Dominic would be this unhinged.

He kept venomous snakes as pets—slept with them coiled around his limbs like living jewelry.

She just wanted to end their engagement. Not sign her own death warrant.

"Y-you have to let me go!" Isabella's voice cracked as she thrashed against the restraints. The snakes' hisses vibrated against her collarbone. "Dominic, please—I take it back! I won't break it off!"

Dominic didn't move from his chair. On the surveillance screen, Isabella's tear-streaked face twisted in primal terror. His laughter was a dark, velvety thing.

"But you made her cry," he murmured, tilting his head as if studying a fascinating insect.

Isabella froze. "W-what? Who's crying?"

Dominic didn't answer. His gaze slid past her, through the floor-to-ceiling windows, where a lone figure stood by the infinity pool below.

Even from this height, Evelyn's silhouette was unmistakable.

A slow smile curved his lips.

The room plunged into silence. Isabella's choked sobs were the only sound.

Dominic's voice was a dangerous purr, laced with arrogance and something far more sinister. The weight of his presence pressed down like a physical force.

"Let you go? Of course," he mused, his lips curling into a cruel smirk. "But the door won’t budge. What’s your brilliant solution, darling?"

Isabella froze. Tears streaked her face, her breath coming in shallow gasps. The snakes coiled around her limbs, their cold scales tightening with every second. She could feel their flickering tongues against her skin—a silent promise of agony.

Then, with a sharp whistle from Dominic, the serpents slithered away, leaving her trembling. Her legs gave out, and she crumpled to the floor in a heap.

For a fleeting moment, she thought mercy had found her.

She was wrong.

His voice cut through the air like a blade. "I’ve changed my mind. Watching someone take a dive sounds far more entertaining."

Isabella’s blood turned to ice.

"Consider this your chance," Dominic continued, his tone devoid of warmth. "Don’t say I didn’t give you an out. You’ve got five seconds to figure it out."

"Five."

The countdown began.

Each number felt like a hammer striking her coffin.

Dive? What did he mean?

Her mind raced, panic clawing at her throat. One wrong move, and this monster would snap. She bit down on her lip hard enough to draw blood.

"Four."

Evelyn's pulse hammered in her throat, her skin leaching of all color.

The air in the dimly lit room grew thick, suffocating.

Around her, the glass terrariums gleamed under the flickering overhead light, their inhabitants stirring with eerie precision.

She hadn’t expected this.

Not here.

Not now.

Her fingers trembled as she pressed them against the cold surface of the nearest enclosure, the serpent inside coiling tighter, its obsidian eyes locking onto hers.

A shiver raced down her spine.

This wasn’t just a collection.

This was a warning.

A threat.

And it was meant for her.

Across the room, the door creaked open, the sound slicing through the silence like a blade.

She didn’t need to turn to know who stood there.

The scent of his cologne—dark, expensive, unmistakable—drifted toward her, wrapping around her like an invisible noose.

"Enjoying the view, Evelyn?"

Alexander’s voice was smooth, deceptively calm.

But she knew better.

Beneath that polished exterior lurked something far more dangerous.

She swallowed hard, forcing steel into her voice. "What is this?"

A low chuckle.

Then, the slow click of his shoes against the marble floor as he approached.

"Consider it… a reminder."

Her breath hitched.

Of what?

Of how easily he could strike?

Of how little control she truly had?

The serpent in the terrarium shifted, its scales whispering against the glass.

A mirror of the tension coiling inside her.

She turned then, meeting his gaze head-on.

His smile was razor-sharp.

And in that moment, she realized—

This wasn’t just about fear.

This was a game.

And he had just made his move.

###Chapter 485 Isabella’s Desperation

Her frantic eyes darted to the balcony. Without hesitation, she sprinted toward it.

The sight below made her blood run cold. A massive swimming pool glittered under the harsh sunlight. If her memory served her right, the hotel’s pool was located on the third floor.

But she was trapped on the tenth.

A hysterical laugh bubbled up in Isabella’s throat. Dominic expects me to jump from here? From the tenth floor?! That’s not an escape—it’s a death sentence!

"Three!"

Her voice cracked as she screamed, "Dominic, my family was destroyed because of yours! We gave everything—my father worked for your family, took the fall for your crimes, and died for it! And this is how you repay me? This isn’t justice—it’s murder! I’ll never oppose you again, I swear! Just let me go!"

"Two!"

Dominic remained unmoved, his expression colder than stone. His silence was more terrifying than any threat.

In that moment, clarity struck her like a blade.

She had been a fool.

Begging for mercy from a monster like Dominic was pointless.

He had no heart. No conscience.

He was pure, unfiltered evil.

"One!"

Dominic's voice cut through the air like a whip.

At his signal, the snakes coiled and struck toward Isabella, their hisses sending chills down her spine.

2/4

Then—something snapped inside her.

Gritting her teeth, Isabella hauled herself onto the railing, her fingers white-knuckled against the metal.

"Dominic, even if I die tonight, I swear I’ll haunt you for the rest of your miserable life!"

Marriage? To him?

Was he so obsessed with forcing her into this nightmare that he’d rather watch her break than let her go?

Without another thought, she leaped.

The world blurred.

A deafening splash shattered the silence as her body hit the pool below.

The impact was brutal—bones jarred, lungs seized, pain exploding through her like shattering glass.

Blood filled her mouth, metallic and thick.

Above, the remaining guests screamed.

What in the world was going on?

Who was this woman?

How had she just plummeted from the sky like that?

Dominic barely spared a glance at the surveillance feed. Seeing Isabella’s reckless leap didn’t even make him blink.

His expression remained icy, voice dripping with disdain. "Pathetic. You didn’t even grasp why I was furious, yet you thought throwing yourself off a building would fix things."

He scoffed, shaking his head in disbelief.

Then, his cold gaze landed on the emerald bracelet resting on the table.

"Take it to her."

The bodyguard nodded sharply. After witnessing what happened to the last guy who messed up, he wasn’t about to repeat that mistake.

"Understood, Mr. Powell. I’ll deliver it to Ms. Morgan immediately."

At that moment, another guard spoke up cautiously. "Sir, Ms. Hart seems to be leaving. Should we intercept her?"

The room fell into a heavy silence for a few heartbeats.

Dominic’s eyes flicked back to the screen, where Vanessa was already on her feet, clearly preparing to walk out.

Dominic’s voice was hushed, carrying a softness she had never heard from him before.

A faint smile touched his lips. After a long pause, he murmured, "It's been years. What if my presence frightens her?"

The bodyguard’s eyes flickered downward, lingering on Dominic’s motionless legs.

The wheelchair sat as a silent reminder.

"But—"

Dominic cut him off with a wave of his hand, his fingers brushing over an elegantly wrapped gift box resting on the table.

"Give this to her instead."

Secret Longing: A Love Rekindled After Prison (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 486 Evelyn’s Reflection

The bodyguard gave a curt nod before exiting with the velvet-lined box cradled in his gloved hands.

Evelyn remained alone on the penthouse terrace of the Grand Cresthaven Hotel, the night air cool against her skin.

Below her stretched the glittering heart of Cresthaven, its skyscrapers towering like sentinels around the hotel.

She rested her palms lightly on the railing, the metal chilled beneath her touch.

From this height, the city sprawled beneath her like a kingdom waiting to be claimed.

Cresthaven at night was breathtaking—a sea of golden lights shimmering against the dark canvas of the sky.

The distant hum of traffic wove through the air, headlights streaming like rivers of fire between the buildings.

Even at this late hour, the city pulsed with life—laughter and music drifting up from rooftop bars, the murmur of conversations carried by the wind.

Yet amid the vibrancy, Evelyn felt strangely hollow.

A quiet ache settled in her chest, sharp and unexpected.

Why this sudden heaviness?

The loneliness struck like a blade, swift and merciless, wrapping around her until she could barely breathe.

The memories of her childhood in the countryside flooded Evelyn’s mind unexpectedly.

Though Beatrice had never shown her much affection—preferring Damian above all—life had been simpler then.

Every morning, Beatrice would finish her chores on the farm, then disappear into the village’s gambling den by afternoon. Evelyn’s adoptive father had died young, and Damian was always absent, drifting from one odd job to another.

Left to her own devices, Evelyn grew accustomed to solitude.

By the time she turned one and could form words, she had already begun learning about medicinal herbs from the village doctor, Jonathan Blake, who lived next door.

Their rural home was surrounded by wild herbs of every kind.

Perhaps because of those early lessons, Evelyn could identify and name every herb by the age of six.

Time moved slowly in those days. By twelve, she had memorized human anatomy and started studying medicine under Jonathan’s guidance.

Her knowledge ran deep. So when Jonathan fell ill and couldn’t see patients, Evelyn stepped in, treating them with acupuncture.

Back then, healing even one person filled her with joy for days. That sense of purpose—of making a difference—was everything.

The sun had barely risen when Evelyn found herself flipping through medical journals again.

To her, these weren’t just textbooks—they were portals to another life, one where she wasn’t the forgotten daughter of the Hayes family.

Jonathan Blake had been her anchor in those early years.

He’d taught her to read using anatomy charts instead of fairy tales. His stories weren’t fantasies—they were gritty recollections of midnight emergencies and impossible diagnoses.

For a girl raised in shadows, his world glowed with purpose.

At fourteen, the Hayes family reclaimed her.

The mansion was grander. The meals were lavish. But the air tasted like loneliness.

Richard and Margaret Hayes tried, at first.

But Vanessa Hart knew how to twist affection like a knife.

A spider scuttling across the floor? Vanessa would shriek until Margaret cradled her.

A pimple before prom? Vanessa sobbed into Margaret’s silk blouse about ruined beauty.

Evelyn learned early: silent suffering earned no comfort.

She retreated. They forgot her.

By the time exclusive school cliques branded her an outsider, even her reflection felt like a stranger.

Then Ethan Caldwell kicked open a bathroom stall door.

His knuckles were split. The bullies scattered.

For two glorious years, he was her daylight—until he became her storm.

Now, Evelyn tilted her head back.

The city lights had murdered the stars.

Just like Vanessa had stolen her family.

Just like Ethan had shattered her trust.

Her phone buzzed. Alexander Whitmore’s name flashed.

Her thumb hovered.

The man who’d married her to atone for his brother’s sins.

The man who didn’t know she’d stopped believing in salvation.

Had Alexander also changed his heart?

The question haunted Evelyn like a persistent shadow.

She stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows of their penthouse, watching the city lights flicker below. The skyline of Cresthaven stretched endlessly, a glittering testament to power and ambition—just like Alexander.

But was he still the same man she had fallen for?

Her fingers tightened around the stem of her wineglass. The deep red liquid swirled, mirroring the turmoil in her chest.

Memories flashed—his cold demeanor at Horizon Enterprises earlier, the way he had dismissed her suggestion with a single glance.

Was this the same man who had once whispered promises against her skin?

A knock at the door startled her.

"Evelyn?"

Alexander’s voice, low and smooth, sent an involuntary shiver down her spine.

She didn’t turn.

The door opened, and his presence filled the room before he even stepped inside. She could feel him—his warmth, his scent, the weight of his gaze.

"You’ve been avoiding me."

His accusation was soft, but it carried an edge.

Evelyn finally turned, meeting his piercing blue eyes. "Have I?"

Alexander’s jaw tightened. He crossed the room in three strides, stopping just inches from her.

"Talk to me."

The command was gentle, but it wasn’t a request.

She exhaled sharply. "What’s there to say? You’ve made your priorities clear."

His brow furrowed. "What the hell does that mean?"

"Galaxy Holdings. Titan Capital. Your meetings. Your deals." She gestured vaguely. "You’re everywhere except here."

Alexander’s expression darkened. "You think I don’t want to be here?"

"Do you?"

The challenge hung between them, thick and suffocating.

For a moment, silence reigned.

Then Alexander closed the distance, his hands framing her face. His touch was firm, possessive.

"Evelyn," he murmured, his breath warm against her lips. "You’re the only thing that matters."

Her heart stuttered.

But doubt lingered.

Had he changed?

Or had she?

The answer terrified her.

###Chapter 487 A New Perspective

Evelyn had married Alexander in the beginning simply for stability.

His dependable nature and considerate gestures made her feel secure, even blessed.

In this chaotic world, someone had left a light on just for her.

She dreamed of building a life with Alexander, and soon enough, she was carrying their child.

But then Isabella returned—Alexander’s first love—and suddenly, his focus was split.

Should she step aside for Isabella?

Evelyn’s lashes fluttered downward.

Perhaps she had been wrong to anchor all her happiness in one person.

Alexander could be an important part of her life, but not her entire world. If she made him her everything, his absence would shatter her.

She needed her own ambitions, her own growth.

Love? Even without it, she could still thrive.

The realization lifted the weight off her shoulders.

A woman who waited for a man’s love was a woman who had already lost.

Evelyn inhaled the crisp night air before turning away from the balcony's edge.

A figure materialized beside her, offering a folded garment with practiced efficiency. "Ms. Carter, the evening chill is setting in. You'll need this."

The security detail—identifiable by his tailored black suit and discreet earpiece—maintained professional distance. When Evelyn's gaze flickered with suspicion, he added smoothly, "Standard provision for all guests. No obligations attached."

She accepted the cashmere wrap with murmured thanks, impressed by the Whitmore estate's meticulous hospitality. Who'd have expected Dominic Powell's event team to anticipate every female guest's comfort down to the evening temperature drop?

Then came the surprise.

A velvet-clad box materialized in the guard's gloved palm. "Compliments of the host."

Evelyn's fingers hesitated mid-air. "Party favors already?"

The guard's lips twitched. "Consider it... a preview."

The weight of the box told its own story—no mere trinket, but something substantial. Evelyn traced the embossed silver crest, mind racing through possible contents. The Whitmores' legendary generosity wasn't exaggerated, it seemed.

Around them, laughter and clinking glasses formed a sparkling backdrop to this curious interlude. Somewhere beyond the terrace lights, the real game was beginning.

"Thank you."

Evelyn accepted the small velvet box with a polite smile. As the bodyguard retreated, her fingers trembled slightly with anticipation. She flipped open the lid—

And gasped.

Inside lay an immaculate set of acupuncture needles, each one gleaming under the ballroom lights. Gold and silver tips shimmered, arranged meticulously by size and purpose. It was a complete professional kit, the kind only a trained practitioner would recognize.

Her pulse quickened.

This wasn’t just thoughtful—it was personal.

Too personal.

A frown creased her brow. Who at this gala would know about her medical training? Her gaze darted across the room, scanning the crowd. Other guests held champagne flutes, clutch purses—not a single one carried a gift box.

Realization struck like lightning.

She whirled around, heels clicking sharply against marble as she chased after the retreating bodyguard.

"Wait!" Her voice cut through the murmur of the crowd. "Who sent this?"

The question hung in the air, heavy with implication. Someone knew her secrets. Someone had been watching.

And that sent a chill down her spine.

The bodyguard paused, his voice dropping to a hushed tone. "It's Mr. Dominic Powell."

Dominic?

Evelyn's lashes fluttered in confusion. Dominic Powell—the man whose birthday celebration was happening tonight?

She was certain they had never met.

The air between them grew thick with unspoken questions. Evelyn tilted her head slightly, studying the bodyguard's tense expression.

Why would a stranger send guards after her?

Her fingers tightened around her clutch as unease prickled along her spine.

Across the room, laughter and clinking glasses filled the space, a stark contrast to the sudden tension coiling in her chest.

She needed answers. Now.

But before she could demand them, the bodyguard stepped aside, revealing a shadowed figure at the end of the hall.

Tall. Broad-shouldered. Watching her with an intensity that made her breath catch.

Dominic Powell.

And he was walking straight toward her.

###Chapter 488 Wounded Isabella

Evelyn was just about to press for more details when her phone buzzed insistently in her purse.

The bodyguard exhaled in quiet relief as her focus shifted.

Seizing the chance to escape further interrogation, he slipped away the moment she answered the call.

"Evelyn, are you okay? Why haven't you returned yet?"

The auction had concluded at ten.

Now, nearing eleven, Claire’s concern grew with each passing minute of silence.

"I’m sorry, Claire. I couldn’t get that bracelet for you."

"Not even for eighty million?" Claire’s voice sharpened with disbelief.

The piece was valued at fifty million at most. Claire had prepared eighty, anticipating a bidding war.

"Yes." Evelyn’s lashes lowered. "It sold for a hundred."

A stunned breath escaped Claire at the astronomical sum.

Key Adjustments:

Name Replacements:

Meryl → Evelyn
Anne → Claire
Rachel → Isabella
Enhanced Descriptions:

"Phone rang" → "buzzed insistently" (more vivid)
"Let out a sigh" → "exhaled in quiet relief" (emotional nuance)
"Gasped in shock" → "A stunned breath escaped" (varied phrasing)
Pacing & Suspense:

Added urgency with "each passing minute of silence."
Sharpened Claire’s reaction with "voice sharpened with disbelief."
Cultural Nuance:

"Bracelet" remains generic for international appeal.
Monetary values kept consistent with high-society auction tropes.
Logic & Flow:

The bodyguard’s relief and escape align with his desire to avoid scrutiny.
Claire’s escalating worry mirrors original tension.
The hundred-million reveal lands as a dramatic climax.
Word Count:

Matched and slightly exceeded original length while maintaining brevity.

Claire had believed spending eighty million was the height of extravagance.

Who could possibly outdo her?

Vanessa answered quietly, "It was Alexander."

Claire froze for several heartbeats before her imagination took flight.

"Did he buy it for you? Oh my God! Since when is Alexander this romantic? A hundred million dollars—for you? But isn’t this a little… awkward? Didn’t you two discuss it? I was the one who wanted that bracelet… Now I feel strange."

She could picture it vividly.

At the auction, Vanessa relentlessly raised her paddle for the emerald bracelet.

Then Alexander, with effortless dominance, outbid everyone in one decisive move. Later, he’d present it to his beloved wife with a smoldering gaze…

So ridiculously romantic. Claire suddenly found herself rooting for them.

Meanwhile, Isabella, who had plunged from the tenth floor into the pool, was dragged out by the resort staff.

Every inch of her body screamed in agony, as if she’d been crushed beneath a speeding truck.

The metallic tang of blood flooded her mouth.

Her mind went frighteningly blank.

The icy water clung to her skin like a second layer.

Her off-shoulder gown, now drenched, offered no protection from the dozens of eyes fixed on her. She might as well have been bare.

Then—

A violent cough wracked her body.

Blood sprayed from Isabella’s lips, splattering across the marble tiles before trickling into the pool in thin, crimson ribbons. The water around her darkened.

Gasps erupted.

Her face was ghostly pale, her breaths shallow and uneven.

“Oh my god—her lungs! Someone call an ambulance!”

“That’s a lot of blood. She’s not going to last long.”

“Where did she even come from?”

“I saw her fall—tenth floor, maybe higher. Who survives that?”

“What the hell happened up there?”

Voices overlapped, sharp with panic and morbid curiosity.

Isabella couldn’t speak.

Every breath was agony, her chest burning as if filled with liquid fire.

Even a rock dropped from that height would shatter.

And she was just flesh and bone.

The world spun as Evelyn plummeted through the air.

Her heart hammered against her ribs.

The ground rushed up to meet her.

She barely had time to brace herself before impact.

Pain exploded through her body like wildfire.

Every breath was agony.

She lay there, stunned, staring at the sky.

Had she been just a few inches to the left—

She shuddered.

It didn’t bear thinking about.

Then, footsteps.

Slow.

Deliberate.

A shadow fell over her.

She blinked up at the figure looming above.

Black clothing.

Cold eyes.

A face she didn’t recognize.

Her pulse spiked.

Who was this man?

And what did he want with her?

The impact sent shockwaves through her body.

She was fortunate to have landed in the pool.

But what if she hadn’t?

The thought sent a chill down her spine.

Death could have claimed her in an instant.

Then, from the chaos of the crowd, a figure emerged—dressed in black, his presence sharp as a blade.

The air around him seemed to still.

Isabella’s breath caught.

Who was he?

And why did his gaze burn with such intensity?

The world around her blurred, narrowing to only him.

A whisper of danger.

A promise of something more.

Her pulse raced.

Was he friend—or foe?

The answer would change everything.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love After Betrayal (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 489 The Twisted Gift

The bodyguard extended a velvet box toward her. "Ms. Morgan, this is from Mr. Powell."

Isabella turned, her gaze falling on the delicate bracelet inside—the same one from tonight's auction.

"Mr. Powell wishes to express his gratitude for your... performance," the bodyguard continued, his tone carefully neutral. "He insists you wear it daily. A reminder of his... appreciation."

Before she could refuse, the man clasped the bracelet around her wrist, the diamonds glinting coldly under the lights.

Isabella's pulse quickened.

A gift from Dominic?

Her mind reeled.

This was the same man who had orchestrated her terror—who had forced her to leap from a building to escape his twisted game.

And now? A lavish bracelet worth a fortune.

Was this a reward? A warning?

Her teeth sank into her lower lip.

Dominic Powell didn’t give gifts. Not like this.

Unless...

Had he known at the auction that she was bidding against him?

The realization sent a chill down her spine.

He was utterly deranged!

Dominic Powell seethed with rage when Isabella Morgan dared to suggest calling off their engagement. To punish her for dancing with other men, he'd unleashed snakes upon her.

Now, witnessing her trembling form, drenched and pale, a flicker of remorse crossed his features. He pressed an ornate bracelet into her palm—a twisted peace offering.

Did he truly desire her hand in marriage this desperately?

Isabella shut her eyes, her nails biting into her palms. She'd sooner lose her mind than wed this monster.

She needed an escape—a way to sever this cursed bond.

Alexander Whitmore arrived moments later, his usually composed demeanor fractured by concern.

The sight of him shattered Isabella's composure. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks as a sob tore from her throat.

"What happened?" Alexander's voice was low, edged with something dangerous as his gaze swept over her disheveled state.

Wordlessly, she collapsed against his chest, her body wracked with tremors.

Alexander stiffened momentarily before shrugging off his tailored coat, draping it over her shoulders to shield her from prying eyes. The weight of hostile stares prickled along his spine.

"Enough tears," he murmured, though his tone lacked its usual steel. "Let's get you to a doctor."

When he moved to guide her, Isabella's knees buckled. A sharp gasp escaped her as pain contorted her delicate features.

Alexander's gaze dropped, comprehension dawning instantly. "Broken ribs?"

Isabella gave a weak nod, crimson still trickling from her pale lips.

The severity of her injuries caught him off guard.

His breath stuttered as he swiftly bent down, gathering her into his arms with urgent care. The elevator doors slid shut behind them as he headed for the emergency exit.

Outside the Grand Marquis Hotel, Evelyn was flagging down a cab when the sudden commotion at the entrance drew her attention. She turned instinctively.

Alexander emerged, his usually impeccable hair damp with perspiration, cradling a figure wrapped in his tailored suit jacket. The way his jaw clenched with barely restrained panic sent an icy shiver down her spine.

Though the woman's face remained hidden, the telltale glint of emerald caught Evelyn's eye. That distinctive bracelet - its intricate gold filigree framing a single flawless stone - shimmered mockingly under the porte-cochere lights.

The air left Evelyn's lungs in a painful rush.

She'd recognized that piece immediately. The same one Claire had gushed about during their phone call earlier. "He must've bought it for you," her best friend had insisted with wedding-chapter enthusiasm. Against all logic, Evelyn had let that fragile hope take root.

But now, seeing it adorn another woman's slender wrist - a wrist currently draped across her husband's shoulder with terrifying intimacy - the fantasy shattered like dropped crystal.

The taxi driver honked impatiently. Evelyn stood frozen on the curb, watching Alexander's car peel away into the neon-lit night. Somewhere beneath the roaring in her ears, she registered the bracelet's clasp - that distinctive lion-head design she'd admired in the auction catalog - glinting like a betrayal in the rear window.

The revelation hit Evelyn like a tidal wave.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the delicate velvet box. Inside, the diamond bracelet glimmered under the soft lighting, mocking her with its cold brilliance.

She had been so certain.

The way Alexander had been acting lately—the lingering glances, the secretive smiles—she had convinced herself it was all for her.

But she was wrong.

The note tucked beneath the jewelry confirmed it.

"For the one who holds my heart."

Evelyn's breath caught.

The handwriting was unmistakably Alexander's, but the name scrawled at the bottom wasn't hers.

Isabella.

Her stomach twisted.

Isabella Rhodes—Lucas Bennett's sister, the woman who had always hovered at the edges of Alexander's life with quiet persistence.

Evelyn's chest tightened.

All this time, she had believed the gifts, the attention, were signs of rekindled affection.

But they weren't meant for her.

They never had been.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

How foolish she had been, reading into every gesture, every word, as if they were promises.

Now, the truth was undeniable.

Alexander's heart belonged to someone else.

And Evelyn?

She was just a spectator in her own marriage.

The bracelet slipped from her fingers, landing on the dresser with a hollow clink.

She turned away, her reflection in the mirror a stranger—eyes shadowed with hurt, lips pressed into a thin line.

Outside, the evening stretched on, indifferent to her shattered illusions.

Somewhere in the city, Alexander was probably with her, whispering sweet nothings, oblivious to the wreckage he'd left behind.

Evelyn clenched her fists.

She wouldn't cry.

She wouldn't beg.

But one thing was certain—she wouldn't be fooled again.
###Chapter 490 The Crimson Revelation

The car sped through the night streets, its tires screeching against the pavement.

Alexander pulled back the coat draped over Evelyn's shoulders, revealing her pale face. Blood streamed from her nose and mouth, staining the tissues pressed against her skin.

His crisp white shirt was now splattered with crimson.

His jaw tightened. "Simon," he ordered, voice sharp. "Faster."

Simon didn't hesitate. The engine roared as he slammed the accelerator, weaving through traffic and ignoring the blaring horns of cars they left behind.

Alexander checked his watch. Past eleven.

Vanessa had vanished from the auction without a word. He wondered if she had made it home safely.

Pulling out his phone, he dialed her number—only to be met with silence. The line was dead.

Evelyn's condition was worsening. He'd be at the hospital all night.

"Maybe she's already asleep," he muttered, though unease prickled at the back of his mind.

The city lights blurred past as the car raced toward the emergency room.

The phone rang twice before a staff member at the estate picked up.

"Has Evelyn come back yet?"

"No, Mr. Whitmore. The lights in your suite are still off."

Alexander frowned. Maybe she went to our penthouse instead?

He dialed the staff at their city residence, only to receive the same answer.

Evelyn hadn’t returned there either.

Where could she be at this hour?

A knot of unease twisted in his chest. Though Cresthaven was generally safe after dark, the thought of her alone out there unsettled him.

"Simon, once we reach the hospital, stay with Isabella for her tests. Update me the second you hear anything."

Simon gave a firm nod. "Understood, sir."

Isabella’s face paled. "Alexander… you’re not staying with me?"

He exhaled sharply. "It’s late. I should head back—Evelyn will be concerned if I’m not home."

The words lodged in her throat like shards of glass. She opened her mouth to protest, but the car had already pulled up to the emergency entrance.

A medical team rushed forward with a stretcher, their movements swift and practiced.

The night air was thick with tension as Evelyn Carter stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway of Hawthorne Estate. Her fingers trembled around the envelope she had just discovered tucked beneath the antique vase—the same vase her stepmother, Vanessa Hart, had always adored.

A cold draft swept through the corridor, making the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.

She shouldn’t be here.

Not after everything that had happened.

But the moment she had seen Alexander Whitmore’s name scrawled across the envelope in that unmistakable, jagged handwriting, she knew she couldn’t walk away.

Her pulse pounded in her ears as she carefully peeled back the seal.

Inside was a single photograph.

Her breath hitched.

It was a picture of her and Alexander, taken years ago at Maple Leaf Café. The edges were slightly singed, as if someone had held it too close to a flame before changing their mind.

But that wasn’t what made her blood run cold.

Scrawled across the back in red ink were three words:

"I remember everything."

A sharp gasp escaped her lips.

This wasn’t just a message.

It was a threat.

And it could only mean one thing—Ethan Caldwell was back.

The sound of footsteps echoing down the hall snapped her back to reality.

She shoved the photograph into her pocket just as Vanessa’s voice cut through the silence.

"Evelyn? What are you doing here?"

Her stepmother’s sharp eyes flickered to the vase, then back to her.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just… reminiscing."

Vanessa’s lips curled into a knowing smirk. "Funny. I didn’t take you for the sentimental type."

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone buzzed.

A text from Alexander:

"We need to talk. Now."

Her stomach twisted.

Whatever was coming, it was already in motion.

And this time, there was no running from it.

Simon handed the car keys to Alexander. Without hesitation, Alexander slid into the driver's seat and sped away from the hospital, his expression unreadable.

In the backseat of a cab, Evelyn recounted everything to Claire, her voice trembling.

"Are you serious? Alexander actually gave her that bracelet?"

Evelyn's eyes were swollen, her fingers twisting the fabric of her dress. Six months of marriage had made her vulnerable—she had genuinely fallen for him.

Claire's face darkened as guilt gnawed at her.

If she hadn’t asked Evelyn to purchase that bracelet, none of this would have happened. Then again, maybe it was better this way—exposing Alexander’s betrayal early could save Evelyn from deeper heartbreak.

Yet something didn’t add up.

"Who is Isabella, really? Some childhood sweetheart? Alexander… he’s always been so careful. This isn’t like him."

Alexander had never been reckless. His reputation was spotless—until now.

The photograph of Isabella stared back at me from Alexander's wallet.

They had waltzed together under the chandeliers tonight.

He had slipped that diamond bracelet onto her wrist.

And then he had carried her out of the hotel in his arms.

My fingers trembled as I gripped the edge of the vanity. "Tell me, Claire—what part of this is a misunderstanding?"

Vanessa exhaled sharply, her reflection meeting mine in the mirror.

"Evelyn, listen to me. I finally understand now." Her voice was steel wrapped in silk. "Love is just... smoke. It slips through your fingers when you try to hold it. My career—that's real. That's mine."

A bitter laugh escaped me. "Should I ask Lucas about Isabella, then? Would that make it clearer?"

The silence between us bled like an open wound.

Outside, midnight pressed against the windows, heavy with unspoken truths.

###Chapter 491 The Divorce Consideration

Lucas Bennett and Alexander Whitmore had been close friends for years. Claire Dawson wondered if Lucas might hold some answers.

Evelyn Carter leaned in, her voice barely above a whisper. "But you two are divorced now, aren't you?"

Claire nodded, her fingers absently tracing the curve of her swollen belly. "Yes, but in my heart, your situation matters more..."

Evelyn hesitated, then shook her head.

It didn’t feel right.

When Lucas and Claire had divorced, it had been anything but amicable. Lucas had been convinced the baby she carried belonged to Julian Mercer—he’d even lashed out at Julian in a fit of rage.

Now, Claire was in her final trimester, mere weeks away from giving birth. If she confronted Lucas now and something went wrong… Evelyn couldn’t bear the thought.

Claire’s brow furrowed with concern. "So, what will you do?"

She never imagined Evelyn would face the same painful crossroads she once had.

"If his heart belongs to someone else, then I won’t cling to a title that means nothing." Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Alexander gave me stability, no matter his reasons for marrying me. For that, I’ll always be grateful."

Claire exhaled softly, her voice barely above a whisper. "And what about the baby?"

Evelyn's phone chose that exact moment to die, the screen going black.

She stared at the darkened device before pressing a hand against her stomach.

That was one question she still didn’t have an answer to…

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn arrived at Whitmore Manor.

Ethan stepped out of his car just behind her.

Earlier, as he’d been leaving the hotel, he’d spotted Evelyn trying to flag down a cab on the curb.

He’d also witnessed the moment Alexander carried Isabella out of the building.

Ethan had offered her a ride, since they were both heading to the same place.

But Evelyn had refused without hesitation.

She insisted on taking the taxi.

Ethan didn’t push. Instead, he followed at a distance, keeping an eye on her discreetly.

He felt like he’d changed.

The old Ethan would’ve dragged her into his car without a second thought.

But now, he let her go.

Even if they were both returning to Whitmore Manor.

After everything they'd been through, Ethan Caldwell finally understood—Evelyn Carter had her own mind. Her choices deserved respect.

Recalling tonight's events, Ethan could imagine how devastated Evelyn must be by Alexander Whitmore's actions.

He'd seen the redness in her eyes.

She was carrying Alexander's child. One day they were inseparable, the next—this. No one could endure such whiplash without pain.

Ethan never anticipated Alexander's sudden return with Isabella Morgan would wound Evelyn so deeply.

His chest ached for her.

For a fleeting moment, he questioned his own cruelty. But pain didn't equate to weakness.

He needed Evelyn to witness everything.

This strategy might shatter her faith in Alexander, just as she'd lost faith in him.

Leveling the playing field.

Now they'd compete fairly.

By the poolside, Ethan had observed Dominic Powell's man deliver the bracelet to Isabella.

He could guess Evelyn's assumption—that the jewelry came from Alexander.

The irony tasted bitter.

Evelyn's trembling hands clutching her stomach haunted him.

Yet this was necessary.

Alexander needed to lose what Ethan had lost.

The moonlight glinted off the bracelet's diamonds like frozen tears.

Evelyn's quiet gasp still echoed in Ethan's memory.

He turned away from the window, the weight of his decision settling like stone.

Tonight changed everything.

The game had entered its final phase.

And Evelyn?

She stood at the crossroads, unaware she held all the power.

Ethan's fingers tightened around his glass.

The whiskey burned going down, but no flame could match the fire in Evelyn's eyes when she discovered the truth.

Let Alexander explain this.

Let him try.

Wasn't this misunderstanding actually working in his favor?

Ethan Caldwell couldn't believe his luck.

Nathan Reeves' unexpected move had been reckless, but now it seemed even fate was conspiring to help him.

Ethan had always considered Nathan's personality difficult to handle. Yet now, he found himself oddly grateful.

The man had unknowingly handed him the perfect opportunity.

Vanessa Hart would be furious when she found out, but that was a problem for later.

Right now, Ethan needed to focus on damage control.

He glanced at the legal documents spread across his desk.

The divorce papers stared back at him, their crisp edges mocking his predicament.

But perhaps... just perhaps... this wasn't the disaster it appeared to be.

Alexander Whitmore would never see this coming.

Evelyn Carter certainly wouldn't.

And that gave Ethan the advantage he desperately needed.

His phone buzzed with an incoming message.

It was from Simon Graves.

The timing couldn't have been more perfect.

Ethan allowed himself a small, satisfied smile.

The game had just gotten infinitely more interesting.

Let them think they had won.

He would show them all what true strategy looked like.

After all, when opportunity knocked, only fools failed to answer.

And Ethan Caldwell was no fool.

Wasn't this the perfect storm of misunderstandings that even fate seemed to be orchestrating in his favor?

Ethan couldn't help but admire Lucas's unexpected maneuver. If not for the man's notoriously prickly demeanor, Ethan might have actually considered buying him a drink as a token of gratitude. After all, Lucas had unwittingly handed him the upper hand.

The tension between them had reached a boiling point, and now, with this new development, the scales had tipped dramatically.

Ethan smirked to himself.

Sometimes, the universe worked in mysterious ways—and right now, it was working for him.

Vanessa would be furious when she found out.

But that was a problem for another day.

For now, he had everything he needed to turn the tables.

And he wasn’t about to waste this opportunity.

###Chapter 492 The Divorce Consideration

Claire exhaled softly, her voice laced with concern. "What about the baby?"

At that exact moment, Evelyn’s phone screen went black, the battery drained completely.

She stared at the lifeless device before pressing a trembling hand against her stomach.

That was the one question she still didn’t have an answer for…

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn stepped out of the taxi in front of Whitmore Manor.

Ethan had followed her the entire way.

Earlier, as he was leaving the hotel, he had spotted Evelyn hailing a cab on the curb.

And he had also witnessed that moment—Alexander carrying Isabella out of the building, his expression unreadable.

Ethan had offered her a ride, since they were both heading to the same place.

But Evelyn had refused instantly.

She insisted on taking the taxi alone.

Ethan didn’t push. Instead, he trailed the cab at a distance, keeping watch without her knowing.

He smirked bitterly to himself.

The old Ethan would have dragged her into his car without a second thought, whether she wanted to or not.

But now?

Now, he let her go.

Because they were both returning to Whitmore Manor.

And yet—

They weren’t going home to the same person.

The weight of everything finally hit Ethan Caldwell.

He realized Evelyn Carter had her own mind, her own choices. He had to respect her decisions, no matter how much it pained him.

Tonight's events played vividly in his mind.

Alexander Whitmore had shattered Evelyn's heart.

Ethan had seen the redness in her eyes, the unshed tears.

She was carrying Alexander's child. One moment, they were inseparable. The next, this.

No one could endure such betrayal without breaking.

Ethan hadn’t anticipated Alexander’s sudden return—or the reappearance of Isabella Morgan, his childhood sweetheart.

The pain in Evelyn’s expression twisted something inside him.

For a fleeting second, he questioned his own cruelty.

But pain wasn’t weakness.

He needed Evelyn to see the truth.

This was the only way she’d understand—Alexander wasn’t the man she thought he was.

Just as she had once realized Ethan wasn’t hers to keep.

Now, they stood on equal ground.

A fair fight.

Earlier, by the pool, Ethan had watched as Dominic Powell discreetly passed the bracelet to Isabella.

He knew exactly what Evelyn must have thought when she saw it.

That it was from Alexander.

The perfect deception.

Wasn't this misunderstanding actually working in his favor?

Ethan Caldwell couldn't believe his luck.

The situation should have been disastrous, yet somehow, Dominic Powell's interference had twisted things to his advantage.

He'd expected Alexander Whitmore to retaliate fiercely.

Instead, the man had withdrawn completely, leaving Evelyn Carter vulnerable and confused.

Ethan smirked, running a hand through his hair.

Fate truly worked in mysterious ways.

He'd spent months scheming, only for Dominic's petty move to achieve what he couldn't.

The divorce papers lay unsigned on his desk.

Evelyn's hesitation was palpable.

Every passing hour without her signature tightened the noose around Alexander's neck.

Ethan leaned back in his leather chair, staring at the ceiling.

Perhaps he should send Dominic a thank-you note.

The man's toxic personality had inadvertently become his greatest ally.

Downstairs, the grandfather clock chimed midnight.

Ethan's phone buzzed with a new message.

Vanessa Hart's name flashed on the screen.

"She's at Eclipse Lounge. Alone."

His fingers tightened around the device.

Perfect.

The pieces were falling into place.

All he needed was one final push.

And this time, not even Alexander Whitmore could stop what was coming.

The game had changed.

And Ethan?

He was winning.

Wasn't this misunderstanding between them so perfect that even fate seemed to be on his side?

Ethan couldn't help but admire Lucas's clever maneuver. If it weren't for the man's infuriating arrogance, Ethan might have even bought him a drink in gratitude. Unknowingly, Lucas had handed him the perfect opportunity.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn)

The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she clutched the divorce papers, her heart pounding like a drum in her chest. She had never imagined things would escalate this far.

Alexander's cold gaze bore into her, his expression unreadable. "Sign them," he said, his voice devoid of emotion.

She swallowed hard, her mind racing. Was this really how their story would end? Over a misunderstanding that could have been cleared up with a single conversation?

But fate had other plans.

Just as she reached for the pen, a sharp knock echoed through the room. The door swung open, revealing Nathan, Alexander's ever-loyal assistant, his face pale.

"Sir," he said urgently, "there's been a development."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "What now?"

Nathan hesitated, his eyes flickering to Evelyn before he spoke. "The documents you requested—they've been altered. Someone tampered with them."

A beat of silence.

Then, Alexander's gaze snapped back to Evelyn, sharp and assessing.

And just like that, the game changed.

Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Because for the first time in weeks, she saw something flicker in Alexander's eyes—doubt.

And doubt, she knew, was the beginning of a second chance.

###Chapter 493 Let’s Get a Divorce

When Alexander stepped back into the bedroom, Evelyn was seated at the small dining table, twirling spaghetti onto her fork.

The door creaked open, but she didn’t turn.

In those brief, silent moments, Evelyn had already mapped out her next steps.

With her pregnancy, no company would risk hiring her. Maybe she could use this time to study, to sharpen her skills.

But first—there was something far more pressing.

Alexander’s gaze dropped to his bloodstained shirt. Not wanting to alarm her, he grabbed his sleepwear and slipped into the bathroom.

Ten minutes later, he emerged, damp hair tousled, the scent of soap clinging to his skin.

Evelyn was still there, fork in hand, the last strands of pasta disappearing between her lips.

The warm glow of the lamp haloed her bent head, her loose waves spilling forward like silk. She looked fragile, as if the slightest breeze might dissolve her into the air.

Alexander’s chest tightened.

He moved closer, his fingers brushing her shoulder in a featherlight touch.

“You didn’t eat earlier?”

Alexander’s touch sent a shiver down Evelyn’s spine. She stiffened, then deliberately reached for her plate to evade his hand.

He froze, his fingers hovering midair before dropping awkwardly to his side.

"Did Ethan make the spaghetti?"

A beat of silence. Then, Evelyn nodded.

"Is it good?"

"Decent," she answered swiftly.

Alexander pressed his tongue against his cheek, eyes narrowing. "Starting tomorrow, I’ll cook for you."

To his surprise, tears welled in Evelyn’s eyes.

Her porcelain skin made the glistening trails more pronounced. Panic flared in his chest. Why was she crying over something so simple?

His heart twisted. Instinctively, he moved to pull her close.

But Evelyn set the plate down. Seeing his intention, she stood and stepped back.

Deliberately putting distance between them.

The realization struck him like a blow.

Desperate to break the tension, he grasped for words. "You came to the auction. Why did you leave without telling me?"

"What was I supposed to do there? Watch you and Isabella waltzing together like lovers?"

The mere image of it shattered Evelyn’s heart.

She inhaled sharply, blinking back fresh tears. "Alexander, let’s end this."

The air around them turned frigid as Alexander’s control snapped.

Evelyn shut her eyes tightly.

She missed the flash of panic in his gaze.

"Tell everyone it was just a contract marriage. Say I forced you into it out of gratitude for saving my life."

Her voice was steady, though her hands trembled.

"People already believe I’ve been chasing you for years. Your reputation won’t suffer at all."

She swallowed hard before continuing.

"Keep everything—the money, the properties. I don’t want a single cent."

Her fingers curled into fists.

"As for the baby…" Her breath hitched. "Just say I lied about being pregnant to trap you. That way, it won’t complicate your future relationships."

Her gaze drifted to the window, where sunlight streamed in, mocking her pain.

She forced herself to think, to plan.

"What else…?"

Evelyn was determined to shield Alexander’s pride, even as her own heart broke.

He had been kind to her, in his own way.

And for that, she would make sure he walked away unscathed.

His fingers dug into her shoulders as he crushed her against his chest.

The scent of his cologne mixed with the salt of her tears.

"You foolish woman," Alexander growled, his voice rough with emotion. "Do you really think destroying your own reputation will save mine?"

Evelyn trembled in his grasp, her breath hitching.

His grip tightened. "If you truly believed I betrayed you, you should've taken everything from me. Dragged my name through the mud. Made me pay tenfold!"

A bitter laugh escaped him.

"Do you imagine cheaters reward kindness? That they pity the women who suffer in silence?" His thumb brushed her cheek, smearing a tear. "No. They exploit it."

Her pulse fluttered beneath his touch.

"Your mercy becomes the blade that cuts you deepest." Alexander's lips grazed her temple. "God help me, Evelyn, but I can't let you go."

The confession hung between them—raw and undeniable.

His mouth found hers in a claiming kiss that tasted like desperation and unfinished vows.

Somewhere in the back of her mind, a warning bell chimed.

This wasn't how divorces were supposed to feel.

Secret Longing: A Second Chance After Betrayal (Evelyn) novel

###Chapter 494 Evelyn’s Brother

Alexander’s words sent a jolt through Evelyn.

He was acting unusually tonight.

She had anticipated his immediate agreement. Shouldn’t he be thrilled to divorce her and finally marry the woman he loved?

Yet, his mood was dark.

It almost sounded like… concern.

Was he pitying her?

His voice, deep and velvety, brushed against her senses. "Evelyn, what I have with Isabella isn’t what you believe."

The embrace brought his lips dangerously close to her hair.

The sweet, intoxicating scent of strawberries clung to her thick locks, and he found himself inhaling deeper.

His large hands settled on her shoulders, warm and possessive.

Evelyn stiffened. That heat—always so deceptive, so addictive.

Against her will, his chest felt like safety.

But she shoved him back, putting space between them before she lost herself completely.

Alexander's hand stretched out, but Evelyn slipped through his fingers like smoke.

He could only stand frozen as she turned away, her silhouette outlined by the dim bedroom light.

Evelyn adjusted the collar of her silk pajamas, her movements deliberate.

Her expression was unreadable, her voice cool.

"Isabella was my neighbor when we were children."

Alexander exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. "She was there during the worst two years of my life."

Evelyn shut her eyes briefly. Of course. A childhood bond.

That was the most dangerous kind—built on survival, trauma, and unshakable loyalty.

A past she could never compete with.

"But it's not what you're thinking."

Alexander stepped closer, his gaze intense. "Isabella and I were never involved. It was her brother I was close to."

His voice roughened as memories surfaced.

"There was an accident. Only one of us could make it out alive."

A heavy pause filled the room.

"He chose me."

The silence that followed was suffocating.

Alexander shut his eyes tightly. A memory surfaced, and sorrow crashed over him like a tidal wave.

He had spent years burying those painful recollections. No one truly understood the horrors he had witnessed.

Bloodshed. Betrayal. Terror. Loss.

They haunted him, twisting his guilt into an unshakable burden—especially when it came to Isabella.

She had been just a child when her brother died. Barely sixteen. Too young to face such devastation alone.

The image was seared into his mind—the day he returned home.

Snow blanketed the ground. The sky burned crimson at the edges, the winter sun dipping low.

His military boots crunched against the ice as he stepped out of the SUV.

Then—small hands clutching his coat.

Isabella, her braids tangled, her cheeks streaked with dirt and tears, collapsed at his feet.

"Where is he?" Her voice cracked. "Bring him back!"

Her tiny fists gripped his trousers, knuckles white.

The wind howled, but her sobs cut through it. Sharp. Desperate.

Alexander had no words. Only silence.

And the weight of a promise he could never keep.

The underage siblings had only each other.

It was their first winter in the remote village, where the wind howled through the barren trees.

Then, in the blink of an eye, her brother was gone forever.

He had been fourteen—barely old enough to dream, yet too young to die.

Alexander Whitmore stiffened, his jaw tightening as he tilted his head down, letting the shadows conceal the grief twisting his features.

His chest constricted, the weight of loss pressing against his ribs like a slow, suffocating vise.

He couldn’t bear to dwell on it.

Secret Longing: A Love Reborn After Darkness (Evelyn Carter) novel

###Chapter 495 Where Is the Ring?

"Evelyn, I'm only looking after Isabella on behalf of her brother. She's like a sister to me. Don't let your thoughts spiral."

Alexander's voice was firm, his gaze steady.

"I'll introduce you properly later."

His fingers tightened slightly around his glass.

"Isabella isn't the reason we'd ever divorce unless—" He paused, his eyes darkening as they locked onto hers. "Unless you've fallen for someone else."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

She hadn’t.

"I haven’t."

The tension in Alexander’s shoulders eased, but his expression remained unreadable.

"Then stay with me." His voice dropped lower, rougher. "The thought of you with another man—it unsettles me."

A shadow crossed his face.

"When we married, I made it clear—divorce was never an option."

He reached for her hand, his fingers brushing hers—then froze.

Her ring finger was bare.

The wedding band was gone.

"I'm actually glad you're jealous."

His voice was low, amused.

"It proves you still care."

Alexander pulled Evelyn closer, his arms wrapping around her waist.

A warm, lingering kiss pressed against her forehead.

His lips lingered, as if imprinting the moment into her skin.

"Where's the ring?" he murmured, his breath brushing her skin. "Let me put it back on you."

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning indifference. "I threw it away."

Alexander stilled.

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken tension.

His jaw tightened.

She had thrown away their wedding ring?

His gaze darkened as he studied her face, searching for any hint of deception.

When she didn’t deny it, he exhaled sharply.

"Fine," he conceded, though his voice was rough. "I’ll get you a new one."

Evelyn met his eyes—deep, unwavering.

She hadn’t actually thrown it away.

The moment she’d gotten home, she’d tucked it into her jewelry drawer, intending to return it when she filed for divorce.

But now…

Had she misjudged everything?

Yet, the memory of that bracelet—worth a staggering hundred million—still burned.

He’d given it to Isabella.

The thought twisted inside her, sharp and unrelenting.

A hollow ache settled in her chest.

Alexander lifted her effortlessly, carrying her to the bed.

His kiss was fierce, possessive, as if trying to erase every doubt between them.

When he finally pulled back, his reluctance was palpable.

His arms tightened around her.

He had almost lost her.

Thankfully, the misunderstanding had been cleared.

Or so he thought.

Moments after they settled, his phone buzzed.

Alexander glanced back.

Evelyn’s eyes were closed, her breathing even.

She’d attended an auction today, and as a pregnant woman, exhaustion had claimed her quickly.

Not wanting to disturb her, he slipped out into the hallway.

The door clicked shut.

Evelyn’s eyes snapped open.

The night was silent, amplifying his voice.

"How could it be that bad? She was fine when I left."

A pause.

Then, clipped and urgent: "I’m on my way."

Thirty seconds later, he returned.

Evelyn shut her eyes just in time.

The mattress dipped as he climbed back in.

But sleep didn’t come for either of them.

The room was shrouded in darkness, save for the faint glow of moonlight filtering through the curtains. Alexander remained seated beside the bed, his gaze lingering on Evelyn's peaceful sleeping face. His fingers traced the delicate curve of her cheekbone, his heart swelling with tenderness.

He didn’t want to leave.

But duty called.

Isabella Morgan was in critical condition—severe blood loss, unconscious, and in desperate need of a transfusion. The hospital’s blood bank had exhausted its supply of type B, and fate had deemed him the perfect match.

"Evelyn," he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. His thumb brushed lightly over her lips before he reluctantly withdrew his hand. "Sleep well. I’ll be back soon."

She didn’t stir.

With one last lingering look, he rose from the bed, his movements silent as he slipped out of the room. The door clicked shut behind him, sealing her in warmth while he stepped into the cold uncertainty of the night.

The hospital awaited.

###Chapter 496 Alexander's Midnight Departure

Evelyn remained silent in response to Alexander's words.

The silence stretched between them like an unspoken chasm. He turned his back to her.

Slipping from the sheets, Evelyn padded barefoot across the cold marble floor to the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Moonlight spilled through the glass, painting silver streaks across the darkened bedroom while street lamps cast golden pools on the pavement below.

Her breath fogged the glass as she watched Alexander's tall figure cutting through the garden below, his long strides carrying him toward the garage with urgent purpose.

A hollow ache bloomed in her chest - part confusion, part betrayal.

Where was Alexander rushing off to at this hour? To comfort Isabella after their earlier conversation?

But hadn't he sworn Isabella was just like a sister to him?

Then why did sisters require midnight visits from married men?

Even after the taillights of his Porsche vanished down the winding driveway, Evelyn remained frozen at the window.

The king-size bed felt cavernous when she finally returned to it. Hours ticked by as she stared at the ornate ceiling.

Dawn's first light was staining the horizon when exhaustion finally claimed her.

Her sleep was fitful, plagued by fragmented dreams where she kept searching for a husband who was never there.

The bed was empty.

Alexander's side of the sheets lay perfectly smooth, untouched. He hadn't come home last night.

Evelyn's chest tightened. A dull ache settled in her ribs.

Had he stayed with Isabella the entire night?

What had they been doing?

She exhaled sharply, forcing the thoughts away.

After a moment, she pushed herself up and headed to the bathroom.

Downstairs, Vanessa was already in the dining room, watching her with an unreadable expression.

"Your ex made you pasta last night, and this morning, Uncle Alexander was in the kitchen cooking for you." Vanessa's voice dripped with envy. "Must be nice having two incredible men fawning over you."

Evelyn froze.

Her gaze flicked to the table.

Only then did she notice—her breakfast was different.

The Whitmore family typically ate toast, eggs, and fruit in the mornings.

But in front of Evelyn’s seat sat a steaming bowl of butternut squash soup.

The thermos sat on the marble countertop, its stainless steel surface gleaming under the morning light. When Evelyn twisted it open, fragrant steam curled upward, carrying the comforting aroma of freshly made pumpkin soup.

One of the maids stepped forward, her voice hushed with awe. "Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Whitmore has been in the kitchen since four this morning. I don't think he slept at all—his hands were shaking when he was chopping the vegetables."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the thermos. Alexander had done this for her?

"Please don't let it go cold," the maid urged, her eyes shining. "He looked absolutely exhausted, but he refused to let anyone else touch the pot."

The image formed clearly in Evelyn's mind—Alexander standing at the stove in his rumpled dress shirt, his usually impeccable hair disheveled, stirring the soup with bloodshot eyes. The thought made her chest tighten.

Vanessa's sharp laugh cut through the moment. "Seriously, what's your secret? First Ethan falls for you, now Uncle Alexander is playing househusband at dawn? You should write a manual—I'd pay good money for it."

She'd seen Alexander earlier too. The man had looked like death warmed over—pale as moonlight with dark circles that could rival a raccoon's. Yet there he was, sacrificing sleep to cook like some lovesick newlywed.

What kind of witchcraft was this? Since when did Whitmore men behave like this?

###Chapter 497 I Am Your Aunt

The younger generation of the Caldwell family treated Evelyn with far more warmth than they ever showed Vanessa.

Vanessa seethed with resentment. Ethan had left early that morning, and Harold was out for his usual stroll. Only Evelyn and Vanessa remained at the breakfast table, giving Vanessa the perfect opportunity to unleash her bitterness.

Evelyn set down her teacup and met Vanessa’s glare with an unreadable smile.

"Does it bother you? Seeing how easily they accept me?" Evelyn tilted her head slightly. "I could tell you exactly how I won them over, but why would I? Watching you squirm is far more entertaining."

Vanessa’s nails dug into her palms. "Don’t get too comfortable," she hissed.

She hadn’t forgotten the child she’d lost—the child she blamed Evelyn for. But reclaiming Ethan’s affection was her priority now.

One day, she would make Evelyn pay.

She just needed the right moment to strip Evelyn of everything—her dignity, her pride, her place in this family.

"Alexander didn’t return home last night," Vanessa remarked casually, though her tone dripped with venom.

Gossip traveled fast in Cresthaven, and Vanessa had her sources. Her circle of friends thrived on whispers, and their group chat was a constant stream of scandal.

The latest rumor? Alexander Whitmore had been seen leaving the Eclipse Lounge with an unfamiliar woman.

Vanessa smiled to herself.

This could be exactly the opportunity she’d been waiting for.

The morning sunlight streamed through the windows as Evelyn Carter scrolled through the messages in the group chat, her fingers moving swiftly across her phone screen. The situation was becoming clearer by the second.

"It's perfectly normal for a man to have a wife and a mistress, especially in a family as wealthy as ours. And who knows? There might be more women in the future. You’d better get used to it, Aunt Vanessa!"

"He made breakfast for you, but do you really think it means anything? It’s just guilt! After spending the night with another woman, Uncle Alexander puts on this act of affection. Do you honestly believe he loves you?"

Vanessa’s words were sharp, designed to wound.

They struck right at Evelyn’s most vulnerable spot.

Vanessa watched her closely, eager to see the pain flicker across her face—that delicious moment of suffering she so desperately wanted to witness.

But she was disappointed.

Evelyn remained composed, her expression unreadable, as if none of it mattered to her at all.

A slow, knowing smile curved Evelyn’s lips. "You’re absolutely right. But at least Ethan can’t even be bothered to pretend in front of you anymore. Vanessa, Vanessa… how utterly pathetic you are."

"You—!"

Vanessa’s temper flared at the taunt, but she clenched her fists, forcing herself to stay still. This was Whitmore Manor, after all, filled with staff who reported directly to Alexander. She couldn’t risk making a scene.

Because no matter what, Evelyn was Alexander’s wife—her elder. And that alone demanded respect.

Evelyn Carter let the half-eaten sandwich slip from her fingers, shooting Vanessa Hart a glare before storming off.

Her appetite was completely ruined.

Vanessa set down her spoon with deliberate calm.

"I recall how, in the early days of your marriage, you fought the maids for chores just to win Eleanor's approval. Pathetic, wasn't it?"

Vanessa's face darkened at the sudden reminder of her past humiliation.

Eleanor had despised her from the start. Desperate to please, Vanessa had resorted to scrubbing floors and playing the dutiful housewife, thinking it would earn her favor.

Instead, it only deepened Eleanor's contempt.

It was Grace Caldwell who later enlightened her—the Whitmore family expected elegance and poise, not a glorified servant. Especially not for a man like Alexander Whitmore, whose reputation in Cresthaven demanded nothing less than perfection.

"I'm done. Clean up."

Vanessa stiffened. "Excuse me?"

"What did you just call me?"

"Aunt Evelyn."

###Chapter 498 The Hidden Truth

Evelyn walked away without a backward glance.

Vanessa stood frozen in place, her hands trembling.

A quick-witted maid handed her a damp cloth, but Vanessa's glare could have melted steel.

She flung the cleaning rag across the marble floor, her voice breaking with fury. "How dare she humiliate me like this?"

At Titan Capital Group's executive suite, Alexander Whitmore's complexion was alarmingly pale.

Simon Graves, standing beside him, couldn't hide his concern.

"Mr. Whitmore, you should take medical leave. You're in no condition to work."

Last night had been hell. Alexander had raced to the hospital, donated blood, and kept vigil until dawn.

By 5 AM, Isabella Morgan was finally stabilized.

Even then, Alexander hadn't rested. He'd gone straight home—only to spend what little energy he had left cooking breakfast for Evelyn.

The dark circles under his eyes spoke volumes.

Simon had never seen his boss so recklessly self-sacrificing.

The man was running on fumes.

Yet here he was, pushing through another grueling workday as if his body wasn't screaming for reprieve.

Simon suppressed a sigh.

Some battles couldn't be fought with logic.

Not when love was the driving force.

Simon Graves was concerned Alexander might fall ill.

Nathan Reeves set down his pen and massaged his temples wearily. His voice came out rough when he spoke.

"Did she eat breakfast?"

"The maid confirmed she finished the soup. Mr. Whitmore, Mrs. Whitmore adored the meal you prepared."

A faint smile tugged at Alexander's lips.

He sifted through the papers on his desk until his fingers brushed against a glossy fashion magazine.

Tapping a photo, he asked, "Can I get this exact bracelet?"

Simon blinked in surprise, leaning closer to examine the image.

"It appears to be one-of-a-kind."

The pearl bracelet stood out from typical jewelry—its intricate design was unmistakably unique. Replicating it would be nearly impossible.

"Mr. Whitmore, are you serious about this? I know an artisan who might recreate something similar, but the cost—"

Alexander's tense expression softened slightly. "Money isn’t an issue. Set the budget at a hundred million. Tell him not to hold back."

Simon’s jaw nearly dropped.

Well, when you’re that rich, you call the shots.

"Could you tell me Mrs. Carter's wrist size?"

Alexander gestured with his fingers. Evelyn was delicate, her wrists almost fragile.

"Approximately 2.2 inches."

Evelyn went to see Claire.

"You're saying Alexander didn't come home last night and was with Isabella instead?"

Claire's eyes widened in shock. The memories of the past few months flashed through her mind, and she nearly lost her composure.

She stood abruptly, one hand bracing her lower back, the other resting protectively over her rounded belly. "Has Alexander fallen for someone else? Did he cheat on you while you're pregnant and unable to be intimate?"

Seeing Claire's fury on her behalf, Evelyn worried it might affect her condition.

"Please, sit down. He might not have cheated—he made me breakfast this morning."

"So what?" Claire's voice rose sharply.

"I think Vanessa might be right. Maybe he slept with another woman and felt guilty, so he cooked for you to ease his conscience."

Evelyn fell silent.

Was it really the case?

Claire clutched her stomach, wincing. "Ugh! I'm so furious it's making me nauseous."

Evelyn immediately steadied her. "Sit down. Breathe. You're pregnant—you can't afford to get worked up like this."

"I can't help it! I'm terrified you'll get hurt again. After what Alexander put you through, I won't stand by and watch history repeat itself!"

Every word from Claire dripped with concern, but Evelyn's mind was elsewhere, lost in thought.

After a long pause, Evelyn finally spoke. "I think... I want to take cello lessons from Mr. Herty. What do you think?"

The air between them grew heavy.

Claire's eyes widened. "The cello? Now? After everything?"

Evelyn traced the edge of the coffee table absently. "Music helps me think. And right now, I need clarity."

Claire exhaled sharply. "Fine. But promise me one thing."

"What?"

"If Alexander so much as looks at you the wrong way again, you walk away. For good this time."

Evelyn didn't answer.

Some promises were too heavy to make.

###Chapter 499 Julian Was Thoughtful

Not long ago, Leonard had offered to take Evelyn as his student, but she had refused.

Now, looking back, she realized playing the cello wasn’t such a bad idea after all.

Claire saw right through her. "Are you so heartbroken that you’re replacing romance with hobbies?"

"I used to love the cello," Evelyn admitted. "But after Ethan’s accident, I blamed myself and stopped."

Claire gave an understanding nod. "Do it. Whatever makes you happy, I’m behind you a hundred percent."

Evelyn smiled. Claire’s unwavering support gave her the push she needed.

Then, without warning, Claire grabbed Evelyn’s hand and pressed it against her stomach.

"You know medicine, right? Can you tell if it’s a boy or a girl?"

Evelyn flushed. "I only know the basics. Do I look like an ultrasound machine to you?"

"Basics?" Claire scoffed, unconvinced. "Stop being modest. I know how brilliant you are!"

She was barely two months along. Far too early for—

A knock at the door interrupted them.

Julian stood there, holding a beautifully wrapped box. His gaze flickered to Evelyn’s hand still resting on Claire’s belly.

"Am I interrupting something?"

Claire grinned. "Just a little gender prediction session."

Julian arched a brow. "And?"

Evelyn pulled her hand back, flustered. "And nothing. It’s impossible to tell this early."

"Pity." Julian stepped inside, handing the box to Claire. "For the little one. A welcome gift."

Claire’s eyes lit up as she tore into the wrapping. Inside lay a delicate silver rattle, engraved with tiny musical notes.

Evelyn’s breath caught.

Julian met her gaze, his expression unreadable. "Thoughtful, don’t you think?"

Too thoughtful.

The way he was watching her—like he knew exactly what she’d been considering moments before he walked in.

Claire beamed. "It’s perfect. Thank you."

Julian merely nodded, but his attention never left Evelyn.

She swallowed.

Something told her this wasn’t just about the cello.

Not even close.

If she had known just a little more, her assumption wouldn’t have been so spot-on.

Evelyn hesitated briefly before carefully examining Claire.

After a moment, she announced, "It's a girl."

Claire exhaled in relief. "Thank goodness. All the outfits I bought are pink."

They spent a long while chatting in the living room, but Evelyn couldn’t help but notice Julian’s absence. It struck her as odd.

The moment she arrived, he had disappeared into his room. No one had any idea what he was up to, though the occasional sound of zippers sliding could be heard through the door.

Curiosity getting the better of her, she approached and peeked inside—only to find the guest bed completely covered in an explosion of items. Women’s socks, pajamas, baby swaddles, tiny outfits, hats, feeding bottles, wet wipes, tissues… and an open suitcase in the middle of it all.

It was…

"I’m packing for her hospital stay."

Julian looked utterly serious, one hand resting thoughtfully against his chin as if solving a complex equation.

"Evelyn, can you double-check if I’ve missed anything? I’ll run out and get it if I have to."

Evelyn stood frozen in shock. She hadn't anticipated Julian to be this considerate.

Beside her, Claire was equally stunned. "Julian, you—"

Noticing her bare feet, Julian immediately retrieved her slippers and knelt to slide them onto her.

"Even with the heating on, pregnancy makes you feel warm, but you still need to wear slippers."

His voice was gentle, patient. He remained crouched before her, gazing up with a playful grin.

His eyes sparkled with amusement.

"I looked it up—catching a cold right before delivery makes everything harder. You don’t want a C-section, do you?"

Julian’s tone was light, teasing, yet undeniably charming.

He rose, his gaze lingering on Claire’s face.

"Take care of yourself, Claire."

The heater hummed softly, warm air brushing against the windows.

Claire’s cheeks burned. Her thoughts scattered, leaving her momentarily speechless.

Claire?

Since when did he call her by her first name?

She had always seen Julian as nothing more than a charming distraction.

A pretty face with empty promises.

But the truth hit her like a storm.

He wasn’t just a dancer.

He wasn’t just a model.

He was something far more dangerous.

A predator wrapped in silk.

And now, Claire was caught in his web.

Would she be foolish enough to fall for him?

Or would she see through the illusion before it was too late?

The answer terrified her.

Because part of her already knew.

She was slipping.

And he wasn’t letting go.

She had always seen Julian as nothing more than a charming distraction.

A beautiful face with empty promises.

But the truth struck her like lightning.

He was so much more.

The way he moved, the way he spoke—every gesture carried a depth she hadn’t noticed before.

Could Claire really fall for him?

Her pulse quickened at the thought.

She had spent years guarding her heart, building walls no one could breach.

Yet here he was, dismantling them effortlessly.

It terrified her.

Because if she let him in, there would be no going back.

And that was the most dangerous part of all.

Would she dare to take that risk?

The answer lingered in the air, heavy with possibility.

Her fingers tightened around the edge of the table.

She wasn’t ready.

But maybe, just maybe, she didn’t have to be.

Maybe this time, she could let fate decide.

The question remained—would she regret it?

Or would it be the best decision she ever made?

Only time would tell.

She had always seen Julian as nothing more than a carefree young man.

Claire had shared the same impression.

But tonight, beneath the golden glow of the chandeliers at the charity gala, he had surprised them all.

The way his strong arms had caught Evelyn before she stumbled on the marble steps—gentle yet firm.

The quiet intensity in his gaze when he assured her, "I've got you," his voice deeper than she remembered.

This wasn't the playful dancer who joked his way through photoshoots.

This was a man who noticed the way Claire's fingers trembled around her champagne flute, who wordlessly swapped her glass for sparkling water before anyone else saw.

A man who remembered Evelyn couldn't eat shellfish after one glance at the passed hors d'oeuvres.

Claire's laughter faltered when Julian discreetly redirected the waiter.

Evelyn watched realization dawn in her best friend's eyes.

That dangerous, delicious question hovered between them like the notes of the string quartet:

What if we were wrong about him all along?

Secret Longing: A Second Chance at Love (Evelyn)

###Chapter 500 Childhood Sweethearts

Isabella opened her eyes.

The sterile white ceiling of the hospital room greeted her. A doctor in a crisp white coat informed her that she had been unconscious for three days after the accident.

Her left leg was encased in a heavy cast. The slightest movement sent sharp jolts of pain through her body, making her want to scream.

But no one was there to hear her.

Other patients had loved ones fussing over them—flowers, balloons, whispered reassurances. Isabella had nothing but the hum of machines and the distant murmur of hospital staff.

A deep loneliness settled over her.

The Morgan family was gone. She had no one left. If her brother were still alive, he would have been by her side in an instant, tending to her every need with that familiar, protective scowl.

But he had been gone for over a decade. Now, the only person she could lean on was Alexander.

The door creaked open. Simon Graves stepped inside, his expression unreadable. "Ms. Morgan, you're awake."

He had been coordinating with the hospital since her admission.

"The doctor says your fracture will take at least two weeks to heal before you can even think about walking." His gaze flickered to her immobilized leg. "What would you like to eat? I'll arrange it."

The words were polite, detached. Not the warmth she craved.

She swallowed hard, forcing a weak smile. "Anything is fine."

Simon nodded and turned to leave, but hesitated at the door. "Mr. Whitmore has been informed of your condition."

Her breath hitched.

Alexander knew.

But he wasn't here.

The door clicked shut behind Simon, leaving Isabella alone again with her thoughts—and the gnawing question of why the man who had once promised to always be there for her hadn't even bothered to visit.

She burst into tears. "Where's Alexander?"

"Mr. Whitmore has urgent business and can't make it."

Isabella's voice trembled. "Will he come after work?"

Simon's tone was firm. "There's a fireworks show in Cresthaven tonight. He’ll likely take his wife to see it."

Her breath hitched. Disbelief twisted her features as sobs wracked her body.

"I'm lying here, injured, and he’s off enjoying fireworks? What does that make me?"

Simon exhaled slowly. "Ms. Morgan, your injuries weren’t caused by Mr. Whitmore. Why shouldn’t he enjoy the evening?"

He crossed his arms. "Besides, I’m here with you, aren’t I?"

Isabella’s eyes flashed with fury. "I don’t need your company! Who do you think you are?"

Her chest heaved. She snatched the pillow behind her and hurled it at him. "Get out! I don’t want to see you!"

Simon barely dodged, rubbing his temple.

Amusing, really.

The Morgan family had been irrelevant for years, yet she still acted like royalty.

He was Alexander’s right-hand man—a senior executive at Horizon Enterprises.

And yet, here he was, tolerating her tantrums.

Patience had its limits.

Simon had already reached the door. But the words burning in his chest forced him to turn back.

"Ms. Morgan, let’s be clear—I have no personal stake in this. But tell me, what exactly is Mr. Whitmore to you?"

His voice was sharp, deliberate. "He has no obligation to camp out in this hospital day and night, attending to your every need. Or does he?"

Isabella’s lips thinned. "You don’t understand a thing. Alexander and I grew up together. We were inseparable. My brother died saving his life. So tell me, doesn’t he owe me this much?"

Simon didn’t flinch. "Mr. Whitmore repaid that debt long ago. When you were injured, he rushed here in the dead of night to donate blood. He arranged round-the-clock care. He’s done enough." His gaze hardened. "He’s a married man now, Ms. Morgan. Act like it."

Isabella’s face flushed crimson. The words struck like a slap.

She had no retort. Only fury. With a clipped command, she dismissed him.

Alone again, her fingers trembled as they brushed the pearl bracelet circling her wrist. The delicate beads felt like shackles.

A mocking gift from Dominic. A trophy of her humiliation.

Gritting her teeth, she clawed at the clasp. The skin beneath turned raw, red. But the bracelet refused to budge.

It clung to her, just like the past she couldn’t escape.

Evelyn Carter slammed her fists against the plush duvet, her frustration boiling over.

The door creaked open, revealing Alexander Whitmore leaning casually against the frame. His lips curved into an amused smirk.

"Care to explain why you summoned me with such urgency?" His deep voice carried a teasing lilt.

Evelyn's chest heaved as she glared at him. "You knew! All these years, you knew about Vanessa and my inheritance, didn't you?"

Alexander pushed off the doorframe, his expression shifting to something more serious. Moonlight from the bay window cast shadows across his sharp features.

He took three deliberate steps forward before answering. "Not all of it. Only what mattered."

Her nails dug into the bedding. "What does that even mean?"

The scent of his cedarwood cologne enveloped her as he sat on the edge of the four-poster bed. "It means I protected you from truths that would've destroyed you back then."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "How noble."

His fingers brushed against her clenched fist. "I'd do it again."

The quiet intensity in his voice made her breath catch. For five heartbeats, the only sound was the grandfather clock ticking in the hallway.

Then Evelyn yanked her hand away. "You don't get to decide what I can handle."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Someone had to."

Her pillow hit his chest with a soft thud. "Get out."

He caught the pillow effortlessly, his eyes never leaving hers. "Make me."

The challenge hung between them, charged with years of unspoken history. Somewhere downstairs, a glass shattered—probably Eleanor dropping another antique.

Evelyn opened her mouth to retaliate when sudden realization struck. "Wait... if you knew about the will, then you must know who—"

Alexander's phone buzzed violently in his pocket, cutting her off. The screen illuminated with Victoria Sloan's name.

His thumb hovered over the decline button, but Evelyn saw the way his shoulders tensed. "Answer it."

When he hesitated, she snatched the device and hit accept.

Victoria's panicked voice filled the room. "Alex! It's happening again—just like last time. They're at Titan Capital right now!"

Evelyn watched blood drain from Alexander's face. Whatever this was, it was worse than inheritance secrets.

Much worse.

Evelyn slammed her fist against the mattress in frustration. "Dominic!"

To her surprise, an amused voice responded instantly from the hallway. "Hmm? Did you need something, darling?"

The door creaked open slightly, revealing Alexander leaning against the frame with that infuriating smirk of his. His dark hair was slightly tousled, as if he'd just run his fingers through it, and his piercing blue eyes gleamed with mischief.

Evelyn crossed her arms, her cheeks flushing. "Don't 'darling' me. You know exactly what you did."

Alexander pushed off the doorframe and sauntered into the room, his hands tucked casually into his pockets. "Enlighten me, sweetheart. What terrible crime have I committed this time?"

She glared at him, though the effect was ruined by the way her lips twitched. "You told my father about the—"

"Ah." His smirk widened. "That."

Evelyn threw a pillow at him. "It was supposed to be a surprise!"

Alexander caught it effortlessly, his laughter warm and rich. "In my defense, he cornered me. And you know I can't lie to Richard."

She huffed, but the anger was already dissipating. "You're impossible."

He tossed the pillow back onto the bed and closed the distance between them in two long strides. His fingers brushed a loose strand of hair behind her ear, his voice dropping to a low murmur. "But you love me anyway."

Evelyn rolled her eyes, but she didn't pull away. "Unfortunately."

Alexander grinned, undeterred. "Admit it. You missed this."

She sighed, finally relenting. "Maybe a little."

His arms wrapped around her waist, pulling her close. "Good. Because I'm not going anywhere."

Evelyn rested her forehead against his shoulder, hiding her smile. "You'd better not."

Outside, the wind rustled the leaves of the Hawthorne Estate's ancient oak trees, carrying with it the faint scent of blooming roses. Some things, after all, never changed.

###Chapter 501

Evelyn gasped, a cold shiver running down her spine.

Was she imagining things?

Why did she hear Dominic's voice outside her hospital room?

She peeked out just as the door swung open violently.

Dominic sat in a wheelchair, pushed forward by a hulking bodyguard.

His presence made Evelyn's hands tremble uncontrollably.

Though they'd never met face-to-face, that voice haunted her nightmares.

Dominic was like a predator stalking its prey in the shadows, ready to pounce at any moment.

With his chiseled jawline, piercing eyes, and perfectly sculpted nose, he could have been a model - if not for the dangerous aura radiating from him.

"Dominic?" Her voice cracked. "W-why are you here?" Memories of that horrific night made her pull the hospital blanket tighter around herself.

Dominic smirked, his voice dripping with false sweetness. "I came to visit my beloved fiancée, of course."

Evelyn's throat went dry.

His gaze traveled slowly to her injured legs, feigning sympathy. "Such a tragedy. My heart breaks seeing you like this."

She knew better.

He was the reason she was here.

"What do you want?" Her pulse raced.

Being in the same room with him felt suffocating.

"Don't you wish Alexander was here with you?"

Dominic's tone was deceptively soft as he flashed a cruel smile.

In one swift motion, he pulled out a gleaming dagger and slashed it across her wrist.

"Call him. Tell him you're dying."

White-hot pain shot through her arm. Dominic watched with sick fascination as blood pooled on the sheets.

Tears blurred Evelyn's vision.

The man was utterly deranged!

Meanwhile, Claire arrived early at the fireworks festival.

Alexander had mentioned this annual Cresthaven event weeks ago.

The grand display would begin precisely at nine.

She hesitated about calling him when her phone rang.

"Claire, I'm sorry. I'm at the hospital and can't make it."

"Have the fireworks started? Are they spectacular?"

Claire froze as the first explosion lit up the night sky.

Brilliant colors painted the darkness, reflecting in her wide eyes.

After everything that had happened, she'd learned to control her emotions.

"They're breathtaking," she whispered into the phone. "Though they'd be more beautiful with you here."

Alexander fell silent.

He'd actually left work early, already at the festival grounds when Isabella's frantic call came through.

The doctors believed it was a suicide attempt based on the wrist wound's angle.

The scene they'd found was gruesome - blood everywhere.

As her emergency contact, Alexander had to sign the surgical consent forms. She was still in the OR.

For a professional violinist, this injury could be career-ending.

His fingers brushed against the velvet jewelry box in his pocket.

"I'll come get you when I'm done here," he offered gently.

"That won't be necessary," Claire declined immediately.
###Chapter 502
Evelyn ended the call and silenced her phone.

Gasps erupted around her. When she glanced up,
a spectacular burst of fireworks painted the night sky in vibrant hues.

Biting back tears, Evelyn turned away, her shoulders slumped in defeat.
Then, with trembling fingers, she dialed another number.

"Mr. Herty, I’ve decided to move into the dormitory."

She had reached out to Leonard two days prior.
The renowned cellist had recognized her raw talent immediately.

Leonard believed in nurturing potential. He offered her a place in his elite orchestra program.
But intensive training required full commitment—including residency.

At first, Evelyn hesitated.
Married and expecting, the idea seemed impractical.

Yet Leonard assured her of private accommodations.
His kindness tipped the scales.

Now, resolve hardened in her chest.
Was she punishing Alexander by leaving?

He had always been attentive. Their fights were rare, trivial.
But his broken promises cut deeper each time.

If only he’d fallen for someone else—she could walk away clean.
Instead, his suffocating care left her drowning in confusion.

Distance might clarify things.

"Pack your essentials," Leonard said. "Orientation begins Thursday."

The line went dead. Evelyn wandered the shadowed streets, oblivious.
She never noticed the sleek black Rolls-Royce trailing her for blocks.

Distraction proved costly.
At the crosswalk, she stepped off the curb as the light flashed red.

Tires screeched. A cherry-red Ferrari hurtled toward her.

Inside the Rolls, Dominic’s knuckles whitened on the armrest.
His driver reacted instantly, swerving to intercept.

Metal screamed as the Ferrari T-boned them. Airbags deployed with a muffled whump.

The Ferrari’s door flew open. "You blind moron!" spat its owner, a speed-junkie in designer leather. "That’s a half-million-dollar—"

Dominic lowered his window just enough to reveal a razor-sharp jawline.
He didn’t bother looking at the man.

"Open this damn door!" The racer grabbed the handle.

A glacial aura seeped from the Rolls.
Dominic’s bodyguard emerged, seizing the man’s collar.

"Know whose car you just hit? Mr. Powell’s."

Color drained from the racer’s face. "D-Dominic Powell?"
His bravado shattered. "Sir, I—I’ll pay for everything! Just—"

A sharp gesture silenced him. The bodyguard dragged him aside.

Evelyn finally registered the near-miss.
That Ferrari would’ve killed her. The Rolls had taken the hit deliberately.

Her gaze lifted to the tinted windows.
Dominic?
###Chapter 503

Evelyn peered into the luxury car with cautious curiosity.

Dominic's piercing gaze locked onto her.

He lounged carelessly against the plush leather seats, one arm draped over the front headrest while holding a nearly burnt-out cigarette between his fingers.

His eyes held an unusual clarity - like liquid amber catching sunlight.

Everything about him screamed danger and unpredictability.

Those all-knowing eyes gave Evelyn an unsettling sense of familiarity.

Yet she couldn't place where she'd seen him before.

Dominic exhaled a slow stream of smoke before crushing the cigarette. "Get in," he commanded.

His crisp white shirt accentuated the sharp angles of his outstretched hand.

Evelyn found herself studying his features.

That nagging sense of recognition persisted.

She remained frozen, her instincts screaming caution. Dominic's

eyes narrowed dangerously. "Evelyn Carter," he enunciated each syllable, "I won't ask again."

His voice carried the cold finality of someone accustomed to obedience.

She startled at hearing her full name.

Her peripheral vision caught the battered sports car driver - now sporting fresh bruises - scrambling into his vehicle like a frightened rabbit.

The man didn't dare glance back at Dominic before speeding away. Evelyn's breath hitched.

Cresthaven's rumors about Dominic Powell painted him as volatile, unpredictable, and dangerously intelligent.

No sane person would enter a stranger's car under such circumstances.

Yet before she could react, an iron grip yanked her wrist, pulling her into the vehicle.

The Rolls-Royce's interior smelled faintly of sandalwood and leather - surprisingly pleasant for someone with Dominic's reputation.

His proximity made her skin prickle.

Dominic studied her with unnerving intensity.

She dropped her gaze, suddenly fascinated by her own trembling hands.

After an eternity, his voice cut through the silence. "No recollection at all?"

The disappointment in his tone contradicted his bold action as he gripped her chin, forcing eye contact.

"What a shame," he murmured, thumb tracing her jawline. "I'd love to dissect that pretty head of yours to understand how you could forget someone like me."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

The rumors hadn't lied - this man operated on a different wavelength.

Her throat constricted, words failing her.

Dominic's fingers ghosted over her lips with terrifying gentleness. "Look closely, darling," he purred. "Don't I stir anything in that forgetful mind of yours? Because if you don't remember soon..." His smile turned predatory. "I'll make sure you never forget me again."
###Chapter 504

Dominic's fingers were icy against Evelyn's skin. The gesture should have been intimate, but it sent a chill down her spine.

She remained frozen in place.

He simply sat there, radiating a disturbing sense of anticipation.

"Still don’t remember me?"

His voice was deceptively soft.

"Have you heard about my methods?"

Dominic smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. "It’s fine if you don’t recall. I’ve always been curious about the texture of a woman’s brain matter."

His hand slid to the back of her head, fingertips pressing against her scalp.

Evelyn flinched.

Was he serious about cracking her skull open?

Her pulse spiked.

Dominic Powell was infamous—a man who thrived on cruelty. She knew he wasn’t joking.

Yet, something about his demeanor triggered a memory.

Back in prison, there had been a notorious inmate—a wealthy heir locked away for violent crimes.

Initially sentenced to three years, his penchant for chaos extended his stay. Fights, riots, even a death—his sentence ballooned to a decade.

Most prisoners sought early release through good behavior.

Not him.

He ruled the prison like a king, feared by inmates and guards alike. No one dared cross him.

Evelyn had kept to herself during her three-year sentence. The men’s and women’s blocks were separate, so their paths should never have crossed.

But on Christmas Eve, the annual prison gathering blurred those lines.

Evelyn, barred from joining due to "special restrictions," stood outside in the biting cold.

That was when she saw him.

At first, she barely noticed the man walking past.

Then she spotted the dark stain on her sleeve.

Blood.

His blood.

She had no idea where he was injured.

With less than a year left on her sentence, Evelyn had learned the hard way—kindness in that hellhole only brought suffering.

Her own legs still ached from old wounds. How could she help anyone else?

But as she turned away, flashes of her own past assaults flooded her mind.

The beatings. The retaliation. The scars that never fully healed.

Maybe he was just like her.

Against all reason, she ran after him.

By the time she found him, he was slumped in a shadowed corner, unconscious.

Only minutes had passed—how had he deteriorated so fast?
###Chapter 505

Had he collapsed or was he unconscious?

His pale complexion blended with the moonlight, making Alexander Whitmore nearly invisible against the dirt path. Evelyn Carter hadn't noticed his striking features when she first saw him sprawled on the ground.

Her fingers found his wrist, checking for a pulse.

With practiced precision, she pressed specific pressure points along his body, then firmly massaged the philtrum beneath his nose. After several tense moments, his eyelids fluttered open.

Those eyes. Cold as Arctic ice.

Before she could react, his hand shot up, fingers closing like a vice around her throat.

Evelyn's vision blurred instantly. The man clearly believed she meant him harm.

Her face turned an alarming shade of purple as she gasped for air. Despite her struggles, he held her effortlessly, like a predator with its prey.

"Who sent you?" His voice was gravelly with suspicion.

"What do you want?"

"Planning to finish what they started?"

Three rapid-fire questions left no space for answers. Evelyn's eyes rolled back as oxygen deprivation set in.

Blood trickled from his temple down his sharp cheekbone, dripping onto the damp earth. The wound looked serious, yet he showed no sign of pain.

Moonlight cast eerie shadows across his face, transforming his features into something demonic - a fallen angel dragging victims into darkness.

With her last ounce of strength, Evelyn managed to wheeze: "I'm... trying... to help you..."

A cruel laugh escaped his bloodied lips. "Help me? Why would you bother?" His grip tightened fractionally. "People like me don't deserve saving. The world would cheer if I died tonight."

His eyes held a terrifying emptiness. This wasn't bravado - he genuinely didn't care if he lived or died.

Something about that hollow gaze ignited Evelyn's defiance. Despite her choking, she locked eyes with him. "If death doesn't scare you... why fear living?"

Alexander's lips curled. "What's the point? Survival in this hellhole just means existing as a walking corpse." His gaze dropped pointedly to her leg. "Is that your inspiration to keep breathing, 879? That mangled limb of yours?"

The prison code number stitched on her uniform burned against her skin like a brand.

A chill wind whipped through her loose trousers, outlining the twisted scar tissue. The old injury still ached, especially on damp nights like this. She unconsciously shifted her weight to her good leg.

His mocking observation hit its mark. Evelyn did walk like someone broken.

Suddenly, anger overrode fear. "If you're so eager to die," she rasped, "then let go and I'll put you down permanently." Her fist clenched. "Three seconds is all I need."

The challenge hung between them like a gauntlet thrown.
###Chapter 506

Perhaps Evelyn's words had sparked Dominic's interest.

He did release her grip.

"Go ahead, show me how you can drop me in three seconds."

Evelyn inhaled sharply.

This might challenge others, but she knew every pressure point in the human body like the back of her hand.

Her palm struck Dominic's neck with precision.

Then, under his astonished gaze, she simply walked away.

Dominic did collapse.

Not dead - just unconscious.

He wouldn't stay down long. Ten minutes maximum.

Ten minutes was all Evelyn needed to disappear.

She'd put sixteen feet between them when hesitation struck.

Turning back, Evelyn grabbed a nearby rock and scratched a message in the dirt.

"The best views require your own eyes. If you've got the guts, keep breathing."

Evelyn had buried that memory.

Now, facing Dominic, recognition dawned.

Prison buzz cuts and blood had obscured his features that night.

But the voice - that cynical, world-weary tone - matched perfectly.

Evelyn froze.

"Were you the man I knocked out on Christmas Eve?"

The moment she spoke, she regretted it.

Why mention assaulting him? This was Dominic Powell!

Had he tracked her down for revenge?

Or something worse?

Goosebumps prickled Evelyn's arms.

Most people would've forgotten after eighteen months.

Not Dominic.

Dominic Powell never forgot a slight.

His midnight appearance confirmed it.

Evelyn calculated apology odds.

The math wasn't promising.

She cursed her past recklessness.

Last she'd heard, Dominic got five extra years.

Yet here he stood, free after six months?

Sentence reduction seemed impossible.

Dominic's smirk turned predatory.

Two fingers tapped Evelyn's forehead.

"Almost got yourself killed daydreaming about a man. Pathetic."

Evelyn startled.

How did he know she'd been thinking about Alexander?

Tears threatened.

Alexander had promised fireworks tonight.

Instead, he'd vanished with Isabella.

The injustice burned.

Evelyn had been mentally drafting confrontation points when the sports car appeared.

Without Dominic's intervention, she'd be roadkill.

However twisted, he'd saved her life.

"Knocked me out cold without hesitation," Dominic mused. "Thought you had spine. Turns out you're just another weepy girl pining after some guy."
###Chapter 507

Dominic's words dripped with sarcasm. He released Evelyn's chin, turned abruptly, and snatched a pristine white handkerchief from the nearby table. With a flick of his wrist, he tossed it at her. "Dry those tears. Nothing disgusts me more than a weeping woman."

She froze in disbelief.

Tears? She hadn't shed a single one. Yet when emotions overwhelmed her, her eyes would inevitably redden and glisten - an unfortunate trait that always made her appear on the verge of crying.

But refusing Dominic's handkerchief wasn't an option.

The delicate fabric carried his signature scent - a masculine blend of sandalwood and something distinctly Dominic.

Realizing this might be his personal item, Evelyn dabbed at her eyes twice before extending it back toward him.

Dominic's expression darkened instantly.

"Keep it or trash it. I don't recycle used things."

His mood swings were exhausting.

The handkerchief, crafted from premium Tencel, probably cost more than her weekly groceries.

Evelyn's fingers curled around the fabric like it might burn her.

What now? Keep it? That seemed presumptuous.

But discarding it in front of him would undoubtedly provoke his wrath.

Compromising, she tucked it carefully into her handbag.

The moment the zipper closed, Dominic's intense gaze shifted away.

A dangerous smirk played on his lips as he suddenly closed the distance between them.

"Collecting my personal effects now, are we?"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

She couldn't possibly admit she feared his temper if she discarded it.

Pursing her lips, she offered, "I'll have it cleaned. Something this valuable deserves proper care."

Dominic scoffed. "Value? It's just fabric."

"Everything has worth," Evelyn countered. "Even you claim life is meaningless, yet here you stand. Doesn't that prove my point?"

Dominic's smirk vanished.

"So you're saying I should be dead?"

The fruit knife flashed in his hand as he pressed the cold blade against her abdomen.

"I hear there's life growing here?"

"Wouldn't want to die alone. Maybe this little one should join me?"

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins.

How had the conversation turned so deadly so fast?

His manic energy suggested he might actually follow through.

Trembling, Evelyn whispered, "Dominic, think about what you're doing."

Suddenly, he chuckled, the sound sending chills down her spine. "How predictable you are."

His free hand caressed her cheek with terrifying gentleness. "Leave Alexander. Be with me instead."

Evelyn's world tilted.

Had she misheard?

But his intense gaze held no trace of humor.

"You... want me to divorce Alexander?"

"Is that so impossible?"

"Of course it is."

"Explain."

"Alexander gave me shelter when I had nowhere else to go. He's been nothing but kind. Why would I leave him?"

"He abandoned his pregnant wife for another woman. Isn't that reason enough?"

"Maybe he had his reasons."

Evelyn wouldn't air her marital struggles before Dominic. As Alexander's wife, she owed him that dignity.

Dominic's laughter turned cold.

"Reasons? He left his pregnant wife to parade around with Isabella Morgan. Tell me, Evelyn - who does he truly love? You? Or his childhood sweetheart?"
###Chapter 508

The night was eerily silent, amplifying every sound. Evelyn could hear Dominic's voice like shards of ice scraping against her eardrums. Each word he spoke struck with unnerving precision.

She lowered her gaze slightly.

The memory of that extravagant bracelet—worth millions—on Isabella's wrist flashed through her mind.

It still bothered her.

"Do you need me to clarify things for you?" Dominic plucked the phone from Evelyn's trembling hand.

"Call him. Tell him you were in an accident."

Her lips pressed into a thin line.

Dominic leaned back in his seat, watching her like a predator sizing up its prey.

Her fingers hovered over the screen.

She hesitated.

Dominic smirked, as if he could read her thoughts.

"You can't even bring yourself to call him. Admit it—you're questioning your place in Alexander's heart." His voice dripped with mockery. "When you start comparing yourself to another woman, you've already lost."

"So tell me, why cling to a relationship that's already crumbling?"

Evelyn had no answer.

She bit her lip and shifted the subject.

"Dominic, answer me first—why did you drag me into this car?"

"How do you know so much about what's happening between Alexander and me?"

It was unsettling.

Dominic wasn't the type to involve himself in petty drama.

Yet he knew, in exact detail, that Alexander had abandoned her tonight.

Dominic's lips curled into a cold smile. "Isabella is my fiancée. Your husband is out with her. Shouldn't I be furious?"

His eyes darkened with something dangerous.

"Tell me, wouldn't it be thrilling if you were with me instead?"

The absurdity of it struck her.

This was his game.

Because Alexander was with his fiancée, Dominic's pride had been wounded.

That was why he had appeared tonight—to reclaim his dominance by taking what belonged to Alexander.

Nothing would satisfy him more than making Alexander's wife his own.

Evelyn's expression hardened.

She needed to escape—safely.

Her gaze flickered over Dominic's face, assessing.

Dark circles shadowed his lower eyelids—a sign of kidney deficiency, which affected the bones. Since she'd entered the car, she hadn't seen him move his legs.

Dominic noticed her prolonged stare.

In one swift motion, he yanked her forward.

Evelyn gasped as she collided against his chest.

His voice rumbled against her, laced with dark amusement.

"Like what you see?"

"Tell me where you want to look, and I'll let you see everything."

Evelyn recoiled.

She hadn't been staring at him like that.

Struggling in his grip, she blurted, "Let me go, Dominic! I can heal your legs!"

His expression turned glacial.

"Oh? Who told you my legs were damaged?"

Legs were his greatest weakness—a subject no one dared mention.
###Chapter 509

Dominic's intense gaze sent shivers down Evelyn's spine. She instinctively recoiled, but his iron grip caught her wrist with bruising force.

The memory flashed through her mind - just a year ago in prison, Dominic had walked perfectly fine. Something terrible must have happened since then. Not that she cared to know the details.

"I figured it out myself," she said quickly. "When you gave me that acupuncture set at the auction, you were testing my medical knowledge."

His dark under-eye circles told the story - kidney deficiency affecting bone health. "The kidney governs the bones, so logically it would manifest in your-"

"Are you implying I'm bad in bed?" Dominic's voice dripped with dangerous amusement.

Evelyn's breath hitched as he yanked her forward, nearly tumbling her into his lap. The sudden proximity made her skin prickle with unease.

"That's not what I meant!" Her pulse raced as she realized her mistake. No man would take kindly to such an implication, even if medically accurate.

Dominic's hot breath fanned her neck as he murmured, "I can prove my stamina, Evelyn. Care to test me?"

Her hands flew up to push against his chest. "I only diagnosed your bone condition! Don't twist my words, Dominic!"

His dark chuckle sent another wave of panic through her. "You weren't so timid when knocking me unconscious. What changed?"

Everything had changed. She was married now, a mother. This dangerous flirtation had no place in her life.

Dominic's next words came too softly to decipher. "What did you say?" Evelyn asked.

"Your treatment plan for my leg," he redirected smoothly.

Evelyn carefully took his pulse, her brow furrowing at the findings. The injury dated back six months - likely from severe trauma. Difficult, but not impossible to treat. If only her mentor Jonathan were here...

"Give me two days to formulate a plan," she offered.

Dominic's hand slid to cradle the back of her head, his gaze turning predatory. "Do you know what happens to people who lie to me, sweetheart?"

His lips hovered dangerously close to her throat when a sharp knock shattered the tension.

Ethan Caldwell's drunken face appeared at the window, his breath reeking of alcohol. He'd been drinking with Trevor Moss nearby when he spotted Evelyn entering Dominic's car across the street.

Through his drunken haze, Ethan couldn't believe his eyes. What business could these two possibly have together?
###Chapter 510

To verify, he called Whitmore Manor, and the servant informed him that Evelyn hadn't returned. Only then was Ethan 70% certain.

The Powells and Caldwells moved in different circles. Coming from old money, Ethan naturally looked down on the Powell family's shady business origins, especially Dominic. Though their families had no dealings, Ethan feared Evelyn might fall prey to Dominic's charms.

The car window rolled down, revealing Evelyn in Dominic's embrace. Ethan's expression darkened. "Evelyn! You..."

His lips pressed into a thin line. "He's forcing you, isn't he? Come home with me now!"

Dominic chuckled, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Mr. Caldwell, what gives you the right? As her ex-fiancé or her nephew?"

The barb hit its mark.

Dressed in black, Ethan's eyes turned stormy. "She's still a Caldwell! She has nothing to do with you!"

He moved to snatch her away.

Dominic's interest only grew at the challenge. "A Caldwell? How delightful - I do love stealing what's precious."

With a glance forward, he ordered, "Julian, drive."

The Rolls-Royce purred to life.

Ethan reacted instinctively, grabbing the door handle as the car moved.

Rumours about Dominic ran rampant in Cresthaven. Whatever happened, Evelyn wouldn't be safe with him.

He had to protect her.

Julian hesitated, shocked by Ethan's reckless action.

"Keep driving," Dominic commanded coldly.

The car accelerated, dragging Ethan thirty feet behind it.

Inside, Evelyn's heart threatened to escape her chest.

This was madness!

One wrong move could kill him!

"Dominic, stop the car!" she demanded.

He arched an eyebrow. "Why? Still carrying a torch for your ex? You didn't react this strongly when Alexander was dating others." Propping his chin, he studied her curiously.

"Stop. Now." Her voice turned glacial.

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you'll limp for life. I won't treat your leg."

Evelyn could already imagine tomorrow's headlines.

Alexander Whitmore dragged through Cresthaven at night - all to protect her and their unborn child.

If the tabloids got wind of this, she'd never clear her name. The baby's parentage would become even more suspect.

Seeing her rare seriousness, Dominic glanced thoughtfully at Ethan outside.

The car had traveled three hundred feet. Ethan's face paled, yet he clung stubbornly.

Dominic had underestimated him.

Who knew the cold Ethan Caldwell could be so passionate?

If a man would sacrifice his dignity like this for a woman's affection, the outcome might prove unpredictable.

When the car finally stopped, Ethan collapsed. A passing vehicle nearly struck him.

Evelyn rushed out immediately.

Pale but determined, Ethan grasped her hand. His voice softened. "Evelyn... were you worried about me just now?"
###Chapter 511

Ethan sensed Evelyn still carried a flame for him.

Why else would her first instinct be checking his injuries after the accident?

If that wasn't love, then nothing was.

All his recent efforts were finally bearing fruit.

He was convinced that with persistent kindness, Evelyn would eventually return to him.

The three-hundred-foot drag had left Ethan with multiple abrasions.

Between the recent dagger wound to his chest and this new trauma, Evelyn immediately called for an ambulance.

When the paramedics arrived, she tried to leave after seeing Ethan loaded inside.

But the emergency team insisted she accompany them.

Panicked she might refuse, Ethan quickly claimed Evelyn was his aunt...

The medical staff, assuming family relations, wouldn't let her leave, whisking them both away.

Before departing, Dominic gave them a loaded look.

Cigarette dangling from his lips, he leaned out the window with dangerous nonchalance.

"Darling, remember your promise. I'll be waiting for your visit!"

Both Ethan and Evelyn turned simultaneously.

The Rolls-Royce bore a massive dent from the collision, making Dominic appear even more sinister as he called Evelyn "Darling."

The intimate term set off alarm bells in Ethan's mind.

As the damaged luxury car disappeared down the street, Ethan frowned.

"Evelyn, what exactly did you promise Dominic?"

"Did you bargain with him to save me?"

"Or is he blackmailing you?"

During the dragging incident, Ethan had heard Evelyn pleading with Dominic but couldn't make out specifics.

The thought of her making deals with that devil for his sake sickened him.

He wouldn't allow Evelyn to suffer on his account.

City lights blurred past the ambulance windows as Ethan reached for Evelyn's hand. She pulled away.

"Stop deluding yourself, Ethan. I didn't negotiate with him for you."

"The outcome would've been identical regardless of your presence."

Even without Ethan, she'd have agreed to treat Dominic's leg - he'd saved her life by intercepting that speeding car. But Ethan refused to believe this.

Hope shone in his eyes as he studied her.

He interpreted Evelyn's denial as protecting him from guilt!

After all, dealing with the infamous Dominic Powell was no small sacrifice.

Clearly, she still cared deeply!

The ambulance reached the hospital swiftly, where doctors whisked Ethan away for examination.

When staff addressed Evelyn as family, they handed her the paperwork.

She nearly groaned aloud.

Even after their long separation, Ethan's affairs still entangled her.

She immediately called Vanessa, demanding her presence.

Upon hearing Ethan had been car-dragged, Vanessa exploded.

"How did you find out before me? Evelyn, are you seducing Ethan again? What were you two doing together?"

Too exhausted for drama, Evelyn simply completed the paperwork.

After scheduling Ethan's treatments and texting Vanessa the details, she hung up.

As she turned to leave, a familiar figure froze her in place.

Alexander.

He pushed a wheelchair through the hospital corridors, his striking presence drawing eyes.

And in that wheelchair sat a frail, pale woman.

Isabella Morgan.
###Chapter 512

Evelyn's fingers curled into tight fists, her knuckles turning bone-white.

Against all expectations, Alexander had missed the fireworks gala tonight because of Isabella.

A storm of conflicting emotions raged within Evelyn.

When that sports car had nearly hit her, when Dominic had taunted her mercilessly—even Ethan had preferred being dragged by the vehicle rather than watch her taken away.

Yet here was Alexander, attending to Isabella.

The ache in Evelyn's chest made her feel fragile, breakable.

But she didn't retreat. Instead, she marched toward them with determined steps.

Alexander was hers. She wouldn't surrender him without a fight.

She'd already contacted Leonard about moving out in two days. No more shared living space with Alexander. Even if this confrontation went poorly, she had an exit strategy.

At the very least, she refused to waste another moment in this emotional limbo!

Evelyn knew she'd done nothing wrong in her marriage to Alexander. The fault wasn't hers. She deserved answers.

Evelyn blinked back the tears threatening to spill and fixed the pair with an unwavering gaze.

"Alexander, what a surprise! Is this Isabella? Won't you introduce us?"

Their startled expressions when Evelyn appeared was almost comical.

Isabella had just emerged from surgery, her stitched wrist still numb from anesthesia.

Alexander immediately abandoned the wheelchair and rushed to Evelyn. "Your face—it's covered in blood! Are you hurt?"

The blood wasn't hers—it was Ethan's.

In that narrow alley earlier, Ethan had kept trying to touch her, his bloody fingers brushing her cheek without her realizing.

Seeing Alexander's concern for Evelyn made Isabella seethe with jealousy.

She let out a dramatic cry, "Alexander! The pain—it's unbearable!"

Evelyn had intended to discuss tonight's events, but Isabella's interruption changed her approach.

"Alexander, shouldn't you check on your friend? She seems to be in agony."

The sarcasm dripped from Evelyn's words, her displeasure unmistakable.

Alexander sighed, running a hand through Evelyn's hair. "Is that jealousy I hear? I didn't cancel our plans lightly. Isabella needed emergency surgery—I had to sign the consent forms." His expression hardened as he turned to Isabella. "And you deserve every bit of that pain. What possessed you to play with knives?"

Isabella had claimed the wound resulted from a kitchen accident involving a chef's knife.

She'd deliberately omitted Dominic's involvement, fearing retaliation.

Alexander's blunt statement—that she deserved her suffering—cut deeper than any blade.

Even severely injured, Alexander showed her no tenderness.

Isabella's face darkened momentarily before she forced a smile.

Remembering the auction bracelet Evelyn had coveted—now adorning her own wrist—Isabella extended her left arm with deliberate nonchalance.

"You must be Alexander's wife! What brings you to the hospital? Did you hear we were together?"
###Chapter 513

The implication was clear - Evelyn had been anxious, which explained her eagerness to follow them.

Evelyn caught the subtle jab in Isabella's words and opened her mouth to retort. But then her gaze landed on the pearl bracelet adorning Isabella's slender wrist, and the words died in her throat. That bracelet... Alexander had given it to her.

A sharp pang of discomfort shot through Evelyn's chest. Her husband had gifted something so precious to another woman.

It felt like salt being rubbed into an open wound.

"I came to the hospital for personal reasons," Evelyn replied coolly, forcing her voice to remain steady.

Alexander followed Evelyn's line of sight and noticed the bracelet on Isabella's wrist. He remembered how Evelyn had repeatedly raised her bid at the auction - clear evidence of how much she'd wanted it.

Lowering his eyes, Alexander reached into his pocket and produced a small velvet box.

If he hadn't been rushing to sign those documents for Isabella's incident earlier...

"Evelyn, open this," Alexander said softly, extending the box toward her.

Evelyn froze. The box in Alexander's palm was just large enough to hold jewelry. Was this... for her?

When she didn't move, Alexander pressed the tiny clasp, making the lid spring open with a soft click.

Nestled inside was a pearl bracelet of exceptional quality.

The pearls glowed like freshly fallen snow - warm, luminous, flawless. Their pure white surface reflected light with an elegant, dreamlike radiance that held Evelyn's gaze captive.

Simon, standing nearby, quickly explained, "Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Whitmore had this specially commissioned for you! The craftsmanship surpasses even Ms. Morgan's piece!" He added pointedly, "Mr. Whitmore even knew your exact wrist measurements."

Simon's emphasis made Isabella's smile falter.

The bracelet Isabella wore was already exquisite, but Alexander had somehow found something even more magnificent.

Evelyn could tell at a glance - this was top-tier quality.

Isabella's auction piece had been overhyped. While valuable, it wasn't worth the exorbitant 100 million dollar price tag.

Alexander's custom creation, free from auction premiums, was genuinely worth every cent of that amount.

In both color and texture, Alexander's gift to Evelyn was clearly superior.

When placed side by side, the difference was undeniable.

Isabella's cheeks burned with humiliation.

"At the auction," Alexander explained, "I intended to purchase the bracelet Isabella has now for you. But the organizer unexpectedly withdrew it." He continued, "So I had Simon commission this piece from a master jeweler. Do you like it? If not, I'll have another made."

Alexander gently took Evelyn's wrist, preparing to fasten the bracelet.

Isabella stood rigidly to the side, her expression darkening.

She hadn't realized Evelyn held such importance in Alexander's heart.

That he would go to such lengths when unable to acquire the original...

Remembering how she'd obtained her own bracelet, Isabella's hands clenched into fists unconsciously.
###Chapter 514

Evelyn was taken aback, yet her sharp intuition caught the crucial detail.

"The auction house broke their promise? Is that even allowed at such prestigious events?"

"Highly unusual," Alexander remarked, his gaze briefly flickering toward Isabella.

The auction was hosted by the Powell family, yet the bracelet ended up in Isabella's possession. Alexander suspected Dominic Powell might have arranged this, knowing Isabella desired the piece.

Considering their engagement, gifting her jewelry wasn't beyond reason.

The pearl bracelet had been custom-designed for Evelyn, its milky sheen complementing her porcelain skin perfectly.

Its surface glowed with an ethereal luster, like moonlight captured in solid form. Evelyn typically disliked pearl accessories, but this piece instantly captivated her.

Hearing about the broken auction promise made Evelyn realize she'd misjudged Alexander entirely.

Had she been wrong about his feelings for Isabella? Had she imagined their connection?

Isabella squirmed in discomfort, her fingers nervously clutching the wheelchair arms.

Simon stepped forward, physically shielding Alexander from Isabella's reach.

"Ms. Morgan, allow me to escort you!"

Before she could protest, Simon added, "It's quite late. Mr. Whitmore and Mrs. Whitmore should retire. You've already occupied their entire evening. Surely you wouldn't want to impose further?" His pointed words left Isabella speechless.

Under the watchful eyes of hospital staff, she couldn't openly challenge Simon's remarks.

Isabella's hopeful glance toward Alexander found him completely absorbed in Evelyn.

From the moment Evelyn appeared, Alexander's attention never wavered from her. The blatant disregard made Isabella's eyes burn with unshed tears.

She envied Evelyn with painful intensity.

"You're right. I've monopolized Alexander's time enough tonight."

Suppressing her emotions, Isabella forced a smile. "Mr. Graves, I'd appreciate your assistance."

"Of course." Simon gripped the wheelchair handles, steering her away.

The moment they were out of earshot, Alexander pulled Evelyn into a fierce embrace.

"I'm sorry for standing you up. I never meant to hurt you." His voice dropped with concern. "But you still haven't told me why you're at the hospital. Are you ill?"

"Ethan got injured. I brought him here."

Alexander's embrace stiffened at Ethan's name.

Ethan, who'd been observing from the corridor shadows, chose that moment to approach.

"Uncle Alexander," he said with calculated sweetness, "Evelyn was simply concerned for my wellbeing, just as you were for Isabella's wrist injury. Surely you understand such compassion?" His smile turned razor-sharp. "Fair's fair, don't you think?"
###Chapter 515

When Ethan Caldwell reappeared, Alexander Whitmore's piercing gaze narrowed dangerously.

Ethan's face was a canvas of fresh injuries - bandages covering half his features, making him appear uncharacteristically fragile. His eyes locked onto Evelyn Carter as he spoke with venom. "Evelyn, Uncle Alexander ditched you to be with his childhood sweetheart. You nearly died in that car wreck because you were distracted, yet you forgave him just like that!" In Ethan's twisted mind, Alexander was no better than him.

Both men had let other women come between them.

But while Alexander could win Evelyn back with sweet words, Ethan had been chasing her for years with nothing to show for it. The injustice burned in his gut.

Vanessa Hart arrived fashionably late, catching Ethan's inflammatory words. Her face paled instantly.

She grabbed Ethan's arm urgently, whispering, "Ethan, that's Uncle Alexander you're talking to..."

"And what if it is?" Ethan scoffed.

The fear he once felt toward Alexander had evaporated tonight. Seeing Evelyn beg Dominic Powell on his behalf had emboldened him beyond reason.

"She'll divorce him eventually," Ethan declared boldly.

His words sent shockwaves through all three listeners.

Vanessa's lips trembled, her expression crumbling. "Ethan... Evelyn... you two...?"

Alexander's eyes turned glacial, his gaze sharp enough to cut diamonds.

Evelyn stormed forward and delivered a stinging slap across Ethan's face.

"What disgusting lies are you spreading!" she shouted, her cheeks flushed with fury.

The realization hit her like a truck - Ethan must be the source of those vile rumors circulating through Cresthaven about the baby's paternity. Would this madness never end?

Ethan licked the inside of his stinging cheek. Rather than anger, he seemed to savor the physical contact from Evelyn.

He leaned in dangerously close, his whisper meant only for her ears. "Evelyn, a real man who loves you wouldn't care about any of this. Want the truth? Uncle Alexander just wants you to abort that baby. He doesn't truly love you." His body pressed against hers inappropriately as he spoke.

Alexander moved like lightning, his fist connecting with Ethan's jaw with brutal force.

Ethan collapsed to his knees, spitting blood onto the pavement.

Yet he merely wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, grinning through the pain. "Hitting a nerve, Uncle Alexander? You can beat me senseless, but it won't change facts. That baby in Evelyn's womb is mine." His shameless taunt pushed Alexander past the breaking point.

As Alexander raised his fist again, Vanessa threw herself between them, shielding Ethan with her body.

"Please stop!" she begged. "Ethan's already injured! His chest wound hasn't healed - you could kill him!"

Alexander's voice was ice. "Then let him die. I won't stop until I've knocked every tooth from his lying mouth. That's a promise!"

Ethan kept provoking because he knew his status as the Caldwell heir and his childhood bond with Harold Aniston gave him protection.

Defiant, Ethan locked eyes with Alexander. "Tell me, Uncle Alexander, when you got that hospital call about Isabella Morgan dying - when they needed your signature for emergency surgery - were you worried about her life? Or were you feeling guilty for standing Evelyn up?"

"While she nearly died in that car crash, where were you? With another woman."

"When those men harassed her in that vehicle, where were you? Still with another woman."
###Chapter 516

Ethan Caldwell suddenly burst into laughter, tears streaming down his face.

He despised Alexander Whitmore. If Alexander hadn't seized the opportunity, Evelyn Carter wouldn't have married so soon.

Then perhaps, he and Evelyn might still have had a chance.

Ethan couldn't bear seeing Alexander and Evelyn happy together. He wanted their relationship to crumble as quickly as possible. Evelyn froze for a moment.

Ethan's words struck a nerve.

He understood her deeply, knowing exactly where it hurt the most.

He asked if she truly cared about this.

Of course, Evelyn cared.

When Alexander was distracted by Isabella Morgan, Evelyn wondered if he ever considered how much it would hurt her to be left behind.

Alexander didn't even know Evelyn had nearly been in a car accident tonight.

When Ethan mentioned she'd almost gotten hurt, Alexander's eyes filled with concern. "Evelyn, what's this about a car accident? You should go home and rest."

Without another word, she headed toward the hospital exit.

Her mind was in chaos.

She needed time alone to sort through her thoughts.

Alexander started to follow her but stopped. Instead, he grabbed Ethan by the collar and yanked him up.

He narrowed his eyes and growled, "Tell me what happened tonight!"

Ethan secretly relished seeing Alexander in such distress.

"Getting nervous, Uncle Alexander?" Ethan taunted.

Ethan smirked to himself. "Alexander wasn't even there when his wife was in danger. Instead, he was busy keeping some other woman company. That's a major red flag, a dealbreaker. There's no way Evelyn wouldn't mind. Hell, no woman would!"

"And it was me, Ethan, who saved Evelyn from Dominic Powell's clutches!"

That alone was something he could boast about for the rest of his life.

But he had no intention of telling Alexander that.

Ethan put on an innocent face and shrugged. "What happened tonight? Your precious childhood sweetheart Isabella went into labor. Why are you asking me what happened?"

Ethan was clearly trying to provoke him.

Looking at Ethan's smug face, Alexander landed another hard punch right in his face.

Ethan didn't mind the beating. The harder Alexander hit, the more it showed how rattled he was.

The moment Alexander left, Vanessa Hart rushed to support Ethan's swaying body.

"Ethan, what were you thinking? Why did you deliberately provoke Uncle Alexander like that?"

She quickly pulled out tissues to wipe the blood from his face. Her eyes welled up with tears, wishing she could take his pain instead. Ethan was in a good mood, which made him softer toward Vanessa than usual.

"What brings you here?"

"Evelyn called me. She said you were in trouble."

Ethan's eyes lit up at this news. "See? Evelyn really does care about me!"

He was so pleased he started humming a tune.

Vanessa could only stare at him speechlessly.

Evelyn and Alexander arrived home one after the other.

When Alexander walked in, Evelyn was showering in the bathroom.

Alexander noticed a suitcase tucked away in the corner. His brow furrowed.

Minutes later, Evelyn emerged from the bathroom.

"Don't listen to Ethan's nonsense, Evelyn. You're the only one in my heart."

Alexander wrapped his arms around her from behind, his eyes filled with devotion.

"I swear I have no feelings for Isabella. Ethan is just trying to drive us apart. You're too smart to fall for his tricks, Evelyn."

Evelyn gently placed her hand on her belly. "Ethan claims the baby is his. Do you believe that?"
###Chapter 517

"Absolutely not!" Alexander answered without missing a beat.

"You weren't trying to hurt this baby?"

"This is my child. Why would I ever want to harm them?"

Evelyn searched Alexander's eyes, probing for deception, but all she found was raw sincerity.

"Then why... lately, you've been so insistent about... wanting me."

She had wondered if he was trying to cause a miscarriage.

Alexander exhaled heavily. "Evelyn, I'm completely in love with you. Sometimes, I lose control. I'm sorry for that. I've been reflecting on it a lot lately."

Evelyn curled her fingers into her palms, recalling how Alexander hadn't touched her in weeks.

"Alexander, I might be leaving for a while," she said.

He froze, his gaze dropping to the suitcase. "What? Where are you going?"

"I'm planning to study cello with Maestro Leonard."

Alexander had heard of Leonard Herty’s prestigious orchestra and its intensive training program.

Given everything else happening, it looked like she was storming off in frustration...

"Evelyn, you—"

"I'm not angry," she said calmly.

"It's an incredible opportunity. Maestro Leonard rarely takes students. I'm honored to be his apprentice."

Alexander rubbed his temples as a dull ache formed.

He studied Evelyn’s face, searching for any flicker of hesitation or doubt.

But her expression remained unreadable.

His suspicions slowly faded.

Self-improvement was a good thing. He had no reason to object.

Of course, he would support her decision. If this was what she wanted, he wouldn’t stand in her way.

A pang of sadness tugged at his chest, but he pushed it aside.

Evelyn, meanwhile, didn’t see distance as an issue.

If Alexander truly cared, their relationship wouldn’t suffer just because she joined the orchestra.

If a man wanted to see you, he’d find a way. He’d make time.

But if his heart wasn’t in it, then even being together every day would be meaningless.

Alexander was silent for a moment before speaking. "What do you need? I’ll help you pack. The weather’s been unpredictable—bring some warm clothes."

The orchestra had weekends off, so Evelyn could come home then. Besides, he could visit her. Seeing each other wouldn’t be a problem.

Silently, Alexander opened the wardrobe and began carefully folding her clothes into the suitcase.

Watching him, Evelyn felt an odd swell of emotion. His care for her was quiet but steady, like the gentle touch of morning dew.

She had expected resistance, even anger, but instead, he was letting her go without protest, indulging her wishes.

"What about Harold?" she asked.

Alexander smiled and ruffled her hair. "Just focus on what you want. I’ll handle my father."

The Whitmores had a tradition—when a woman became pregnant, she was expected to stay at Whitmore Manor until the birth.

Evelyn had only been there a few days, and now she was leaving. It went against tradition.

With her staying at Whitmore Manor, running into Ethan was inevitable. And with Alexander so busy, it was practically handing Ethan an opportunity. Maybe it was better she left for a while.

Early the next morning, Alexander personally saw her off.

As she wheeled her suitcase toward the car, they bumped straight into Harold, who was adjusting a vase in the foyer.

Harold’s eyes narrowed at the suitcase. "What’s this about?" he demanded.
###Chapter 518

Alexander's gaze was icy and detached. "It's exactly what it looks like. We won't be staying at Whitmore Manor anymore."

Harold's expression darkened. "Have you forgotten our family traditions? She's pregnant—how could you possibly—"

"If we're unhappy there, staying is pointless."

Alexander wrapped a protective arm around Evelyn's shoulders.

"Your precious grandson has been harassing my wife, and you turn a blind eye. We're simply choosing not to live at Whitmore Manor anymore. Which situation is more outrageous?" Harold was left speechless.

Without another glance, Alexander grabbed their suitcase with one hand and took Evelyn's hand with the other, heading for the door.

Harold suddenly called out, "Let her stay. I need to speak with her."

"There's nothing to discuss. If you have something to say, say it to me. Ethan's the one harassing her. She has nothing to do with this." Alexander's tone was firm, shielding Evelyn from any potential confrontation.

"Alexander! Watch your tone!" Harold's voice was sharp, but Alexander didn't flinch.

Evelyn froze. The rumors circulating in Cresthaven had clearly reached Harold's ears.

What was Ethan trying to accomplish?

Alexander's expression darkened. "I never want to hear that question again. If Ethan keeps spreading lies, I'll deal with him myself. I don't care who's protecting him."

Without warning, Alexander grabbed the antique vase Harold had just polished and hurled it to the floor.

The vase shattered instantly, fragments scattering across the marble.

Harold's face twisted in horror. "Alexander! That was your mother's—how could you—"

"Why not?" Alexander sneered, utterly indifferent. "You abandoned her son for over a decade without a second thought. Funny how a vase suddenly means more to you than a person."

Harold recoiled as if struck, his lips trembling.

Alexander didn't wait for a response. He took Evelyn's hand and walked out.

Something nagged at Evelyn.

"Harold seemed genuinely upset about Alexander's mother," she thought, puzzled.

"But if he cared, why abandon Alexander for so long? Why leave him with strangers and never look back?"

In the car, Evelyn kept glancing at Alexander, struggling with unspoken questions.

She hesitated, unsure if she should ask.

Alexander sensed her turmoil.

"It's not some grand secret," he said quietly. "People say my mother died giving birth to me, and my father resented me for it, so he sent me away. But that's not the truth."

Evelyn bit her lip. "Then what is?"

"The truth is, my mother ran off with another man, convinced she'd found true love. She dumped me at Whitmore Manor like unwanted baggage. They crashed their car not long after. She's been missing ever since—probably dead by now."

Evelyn's breath caught.

She had no idea.

Alexander's mother had abandoned him—for another man.
###Chapter 519

No wonder Ethan had abandoned him with rural farmers without hesitation.

Alexander's very existence was a living testament to Ethan's disgraceful past.

And Alexander's mother had been equally cruel.

She had deserted her own newborn child!

Her departure left Alexander in an impossible position - unwanted in the Whitmore family and constantly ridiculed.

Evelyn's eyes brimmed with compassion as she studied Alexander, but he remained impassive.

For years, he'd been treated as an outcast by the Whitmores. Ethan only acknowledged him when the family needed something. Alexander had long accepted their manipulative nature.

Family meant nothing to him now. Having grown up outside the Whitmore estate, he felt no true bond with Ethan either.

Alexander pulled Evelyn into a tight embrace.

"Evelyn, stop looking at me with those sorrowful eyes."

His gaze burned with raw honesty.

Unable to resist, he cradled Evelyn's face between his hands and captured her lips in a searing kiss.

The temperature in the car soared as Alexander's kiss grew increasingly passionate yet controlled.

Evelyn flushed crimson, acutely aware of the chauffeur in front while they kissed like the world had disappeared.

Had there been a mirror, she would have seen herself glowing from Alexander's kisses, her eyes dark with longing.

She resembled a rose unfurling its petals at dawn.

Alexander supported the back of her head, holding her close as he drank in her sweetness.

Evelyn's soft lips parted slightly as she caught her breath.

"I truly don't want to let you join the orchestra," he murmured against her skin.

Alexander buried his face in the curve of Evelyn's neck, his fingers tracing delicate patterns near her ear.

His warm breath sent shivers down her spine, making her pulse race erratically.

"Stay with me. I need to see you every single day."

"But I already promised Mr. Herty," Evelyn protested.

She adjusted her clothing and pressed against Alexander's chest, breaking free from his arms. "A commitment is a commitment, and this is crucial for my professional development." Evelyn had deeper considerations.

Alexander could be part of her world but not consume it entirely. Recent events had taught her that women needed their own passions and careers.

Only by becoming more independent could she properly guide the child growing within her.

A shadow of concern crossed Alexander's features. "Promise you'll call daily, and I'll visit whenever possible," he insisted.

Evelyn nodded in agreement.

Upon reaching the orchestra, Evelyn wanted a low-key first impression and asked Alexander to stop outside rather than drive in.

Alexander insisted on helping her to the dorm, worried about her managing the cello and luggage while pregnant.

Evelyn accepted his assistance.

She collected the keys from the dorm manager first. Leonard had arranged everything in advance, making the process effortless.

They entered the room and Alexander set down the luggage and instrument. In one fluid motion, he spun and pressed Evelyn against the door.

"Can't I steal just a few more moments?" he whispered huskily.
###Chapter 520

The dormitory was compact but functional - a cozy one-bedroom apartment spanning just over 300 square feet. Every essential amenity had been thoughtfully arranged within its limited space.

Flushed memories surfaced in Evelyn's mind, causing her to avert her gaze awkwardly. "Stop that. This is my private dorm room."

Alexander had only secured her this single occupancy accommodation due to her pregnancy. His frequent visits were becoming increasingly inappropriate.

"It's getting late. Shouldn't you be heading to work?" Evelyn suggested, attempting to redirect the conversation.

"So eager to dismiss me?" Alexander arched an eyebrow, amusement dancing in his eyes.

"What if I purchased this entire orchestra? Then no one could question my presence here."

After all, objections would cease immediately if the property became his.

Evelyn responded with an entertained smile. "Purchase it? This is a government-funded orchestra. The process wouldn't be that straightforward."

She recalled Richard's previous remarks about the countless individuals vying to study under Leonard - all hoping to ascend Cresthaven's social hierarchy. Every musician in this orchestra was extraordinarily talented. These weren't ordinary people by any measure.

Certainly, others had attempted acquisitions before, yet none had succeeded.

After sharing some intimate moments in the confined space, Alexander finally departed, though his reluctance was palpable.

Evelyn, her cheeks still tinged pink, changed into an elegant full-length gown and collected her cello, preparing to report to Leonard.

"Didn't you hear? Mr. Herty departed on a business trip this morning. He's currently absent from the orchestra."

The practice facility was segmented into various classrooms according to instrument classifications.

Outside the cello practice room, a refined young gentleman nodded politely at Evelyn. "What did you need to see him about? I'd be happy to relay your message upon his return."

The young man possessed an aristocratic bearing and studied Evelyn with quiet curiosity.

Noticing the cello case she carried, he ventured, "Are you here for instruction with Mr. Herty?"

Evelyn confirmed with a nod.

Before the young man could respond, a delicate feminine laugh echoed from within the practice room.

"So many aspire to study under Mr. Herty, yet he's famously selective. How did security permit another random admirer to wander in?"

Every musician in this orchestra came from privilege and exceptional talent, these young women carrying themselves with inherent superiority.

As the first girl spoke, others quickly joined the chorus: "Honestly, these constant interruptions during practice sessions are becoming unbearable."

The group clearly deferred to their outspoken leader.

Leonard's prestige attracted countless opportunists seeking favor, yet he maintained an exclusive circle of protégés.

In all his years of teaching, Leonard had only ever accepted one apprentice - now an internationally celebrated cellist who had recently performed at one of the world's most prestigious concert venues abroad.

Therefore, when Evelyn implied she was here for private instruction, they naturally categorized her with the usual social climbers and regarded her with disdain.

The lead girl waved dismissively. "Just leave before we summon security."

Evelyn pressed her lips together gently. "But Mr. Herty specifically requested I wait for him here."

This declaration only deepened their skepticism. "You can't possibly be serious."

Leonard almost never conducted private lessons. His masterclasses were so rare that students competed fiercely for spots, with perhaps two sessions occurring annually at most.

Evelyn's claim of a personal invitation struck everyone present as utterly preposterous.
###Chapter 521

The girl's skeptical gaze burned into Evelyn, but she chose not to elaborate further.

Her cello case weighed heavily against her shoulder as she entered the rehearsal space. Spotting an unoccupied chair near the back, she made her way toward it.

"Really committing to this charade, aren't you?" Cassandra Brown scoffed, crossing her arms. "Just because Mr. Herty's away doesn't give you license to waltz in here using his name. This isn't some amateur ensemble - standards matter here."

Ethan Miller stepped forward, his voice calm. "Easy there, Cassandra. What's the harm in letting her sit? That seat's been empty all morning."

"Whose side are you on, Ethan?" Cassandra snapped. "Don't tell me you're falling for this pretty face like some lovesick puppy."

Ethan glanced at Evelyn with thoughtful eyes. "She doesn't strike me as dishonest. Besides, the truth will come out when Mr. Herty returns from his conference."

His attention lingered on the distinctive bracelet adorning Evelyn's wrist - the official orchestra access pass that granted entry to restricted areas. Its presence confirmed at least one truth: Evelyn belonged here.

The weekend rehearsal buzzed with energy, musicians practicing freely without instructors present. The cello section was running through a complex piece for next week's performance.

Evelyn listened intently, noting each player's distinctive interpretation. The skill level here surpassed anything she'd encountered before. Coming to this orchestra had clearly been the right decision.

Wanting to familiarize herself with the building, she quietly excused herself from the rehearsal room. Cassandra's lips curled in triumph as she watched Evelyn leave.

"Pathetic amateur," Cassandra muttered under her breath, confident her intimidation tactics had worked. No one could threaten her position as principal cellist - least of all some newcomer.

After stopping by the campus store for supplies, Evelyn returned to her dorm to organize her belongings. Night fell unnoticed as she worked, her stomach eventually reminding her she hadn't eaten.

Venturing out into the darkened campus, she struggled to navigate the unfamiliar layout. Just as she considered asking for directions, a sudden metallic clang shattered the silence.

The noise startled her - this section of campus stood deserted at night, the daytime bustle replaced by an eerie stillness broken only by the whispering wind.

Her pulse quickened as she scanned the shadows, fists clenched at her sides. Then she saw it - the glint of steel in the flowerbed where she'd just walked. A gun lay where none had been moments before.

Her blood turned to ice.

Every instinct screamed at her to leave, but her legs refused to cooperate. Taking steadying breaths, she finally willed herself to move when a new sound froze her in place.

From the dense shrubbery came a man's mocking chuckle, the sound raising goosebumps along her arms. She could feel his predatory gaze locked onto her back.

Evelyn resisted the urge to turn around. As a newcomer, playing ignorant seemed the safest course.

"Running away so soon?" the voice taunted. "Seems you've forgotten our little arrangement."
###Chapter 522

Dominic's voice came out rough and strained, as though every word caused him pain.

Evelyn froze mid-step, instantly recognizing that distinctive timbre.

When she turned, she found Dominic sprawled in the shrubbery, a thin trail of blood leaking from his lips.

From his disheveled appearance, he'd clearly sustained injuries elsewhere too.

Evelyn couldn't conceal her shock at discovering Dominic here of all places - the prestigious orchestra grounds.

Her brow furrowed as she demanded, "What are you doing here?"

The orchestra maintained strict security protocols, requiring identification for all visitors.

Evelyn had never heard of any connection between the Powell family and this cultural institution.

"Curiosity killed the cat, sweetheart." Dominic pushed himself upright against the wall, his lips twisting into a mocking smirk. "Sure you want those answers?"

Evelyn immediately pressed her lips together. "Forget I asked."

"Ah... but now I suddenly feel like sharing."

Evelyn exhaled sharply through her nose.

She'd never encountered such a contrary man in her life.

Dominic rapped his knuckles against the brickwork behind him. "Know what's on the other side? That's my family's estate."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "And?"

"I took an impromptu flight over the wall."

Evelyn's eyes widened slightly.

"Help me up."

Dominic's command held no polite pretense as he gestured impatiently.

Considering the effort it must have taken for a man with limited mobility to scale and fall from a wall, Evelyn moved to assist him.

As she drew closer, the dark stain spreading across Dominic's shoulder became visible. Crimson seeped steadily through his expensive shirt.

The injury appeared serious, his forehead glistening with perspiration.

Evelyn asked, "How do we get you back?"

Dominic scoffed. "Through the front gates like civilized people! Were you planning to catapult me back over?"

Evelyn thought privately that he'd apparently managed the first launch just fine.

Finding no wheelchair available on orchestra property, Evelyn snapped a sturdy branch from the bushes, fashioning a makeshift crutch.

Dominic didn't hesitate to use her as support. Leaning heavily on the branch with one hand, he draped his injured arm across Evelyn's shoulders, deliberately shifting his weight to make her stagger.

In a tone that brooked no argument, he ordered, "Pick up that pistol at your feet and hand it to me."

Evelyn went rigid.

She'd initially mistaken it for a prop, but its substantial weight confirmed its authenticity upon lifting.

The realization struck her - Dominic's shoulder wound bore the distinctive characteristics of a gunshot.

His claim about the estate being just beyond the wall raised disturbing questions. How does one sustain such injuries in their own home?

The more plausible scenario involved Dominic scaling the wall in desperate escape, only to take a bad fall.

"I'll be right back," Evelyn said, turning to leave.

Dominic's grip on her wrist was instantaneous and unyielding.

"Going somewhere?" His voice dropped to a dangerous octave, eyes darkening. "The gun frighten you?"

"I gave my word about treating your leg, and I honor my promises. I need to retrieve my acupuncture kit from my dormitory."

Dominic's gaze sharpened. "You live here?" A slow, unsettling smile spread across his face. "How... convenient. We'll be seeing much more of each other."

Evelyn remained silent.

There was an unmistakable predatory edge to Dominic's tone.

Wordlessly, Evelyn produced a handkerchief and began binding his shoulder wound to stem the bleeding. Dominic's eyebrows lifted slightly at her competent ministrations.
###Chapter 523

It was the handkerchief he'd used to dry her tears last night. Evelyn never expected Dominic would keep it tucked so near his heart.

After leaving the symphony hall, they found themselves standing before the imposing gates of Powell Estate.

Evelyn supported Dominic to the entrance. The guard's eyes widened at the sight of his injury.

"Mr. Powell! What happened?"

Dominic was the youngest of three Powell brothers, with two elder siblings who ruled the family empire.

A servant rushed forward with a wheelchair, gesturing urgently for him to sit.

"Not a word of this to anyone!" Dominic commanded through gritted teeth.

The guard nodded solemnly. "Understood, sir. Shall I summon the family physician?"

"Unnecessary." Dominic turned his head, locking eyes with Evelyn. "We have our own doctor right here."

Powell Estate sprawled like a small kingdom. They were escorted to a private chamber in the west wing.

His shoulder wound had bled through the crisp white shirt, staining it crimson.

Dominic collapsed onto the four-poster bed and ripped the ruined fabric away without ceremony.

Evelyn's breath caught. She hadn't anticipated such casual disregard for propriety.

The shirt came off in one fluid motion, revealing taut muscles glistening with sweat.

Pain flushed his cheeks, beads of perspiration dotting his forehead.

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably. Being alone with a half-naked man - a married woman's worst scandal.

"I only agreed to see you home," she said stiffly. "I'm no battlefield surgeon. You need proper medical attention." She turned toward the door.

A gunshot wound in his own home? The Powells clearly played dangerous games.

This was no place for outsiders.

Dominic's low chuckle froze her in her tracks.

"You think Powell gates swing so easily in both directions, Dr. Carter?"

His voice dripped with dark amusement.

Those piercing eyes pinned her in place. "The woman who healed my leg when specialists failed? Surely a bullet's just a splinter to your skilled hands."

The wound gaped obscenely, flesh torn and weeping.

Pale from blood loss, Dominic lay sprawled across sapphire silk now blooming with scarlet stains.

Blood had traced rivulets down his sculpted arm, drying in macabre patterns between fresh droplets.

"That requires proper debridement and stitches," Evelyn insisted, reaching for her phone. "I'm calling an ambulance."

"Don't!" Dominic snapped.

To him, this was merely a scratch.

He'd survived worse - much worse - and walked away smiling.

His finger jabbed toward the water carafe on the side table.

Thinking he wanted a drink, Evelyn poured a glass.

Instead, Dominic upended the entire pitcher over his wound, hissing through clenched teeth as water sluiced away blood.

"Fetch me a clean shirt," he ground out.

As if that settled the matter.

Evelyn's lips thinned. The bullet remained lodged in muscle. Fever would set in by nightfall. "Where's your first aid kit?"

Dominic cracked one eye open, mouth quirking. "Changed your mind, doctor?"
###Chapter 524

Evelyn had no patience left for his teasing.

Dominic gestured weakly behind her, and Evelyn retrieved the medical supplies.

She helped him settle onto the bed, carefully dabbing alcohol-soaked cotton against his bloodied shoulder.

The wound wasn't fatal, thank God.

Though he must have been in excruciating pain from blood loss, Dominic remained eerily silent as she worked. Only the cold sweat beading on his forehead revealed his suffering.

There was something disturbingly attractive about him like this.

His bare torso tensed, every sculpted muscle standing in sharp relief.

The injury softened his usual predatory edge, transforming him into something vulnerable yet paradoxically more dangerous. The procedure took longer than anticipated.

As minutes stretched into hours, the night deepened around them.

Evelyn began by sterilizing the wound, then reached for the forceps.

The bullet remained lodged in Dominic's flesh, demanding extraction.

She studied his face. "Still refusing the hospital?"

Her experience with such matters was limited.

At twelve, she'd helped a neighbor remove a nail from his foot after a farming accident.

The principles might be similar, but this was entirely different.

Unlike a straightforward nail, bullets were treacherous. A single misstep could cause catastrophic damage.

Worse, the first aid kit lacked anesthesia.

Dominic would endure every second of agony raw.

The ultimate test of endurance.

His eyes remained closed. If not for the occasional twitch of his brows, Evelyn might have thought him asleep.

After an eternity, he murmured, "Just do it. Already dead anyway."

Evelyn hesitated. "There's no pain relief. You understand what that means?"

At this, Dominic's eyes snapped open.

His unfocused gaze found her face.

She knelt beside the bed, slightly hunched. A loose strand of hair framed her delicate features, softening her normally sharp appearance. Her petite form triggered something primal in him.

Dominic's breath hitched before he managed a lazy smirk. "Concerned about me, sweetheart?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

"How about I carve you up too? We can suffer together. Romantic, no?"

The man was clearly delirious.

Without ceremony, Evelyn located the bullet and plunged the forceps into torn flesh.

She may have twisted the instrument unnecessarily.

Dominic's entire body went rigid.

His hands fisted the sheets, veins standing out like cables beneath his skin. Sweat sheened his torso.

"Petty revenge?" He pressed his tongue against his cheek, the ghost of a smile tugging at bloodless lips. His voice emerged thready, barely audible.

Evelyn didn't pause. "You chose this. I warned you about the hospital."

The subtext was clear - his suffering was self-inflicted.

Dominic exhaled something between a laugh and a groan.

His smile widened as his gaze locked onto Evelyn with unsettling intensity.
###Chapter 525

The tweezers plunged deep into his flesh, and with one sharp tug, the bullet came free.

Blood immediately welled up from Dominic's shoulder, staining the sheets beneath him.

Evelyn pressed a wad of gauze firmly against the wound, her fingers steady despite the urgency.

She reached for her acupuncture needles, inserting them with practiced precision into the pressure points around the injury.

Almost instantly, the bleeding slowed to a trickle.

She wrapped thick layers of bandages around his shoulder, securing them tightly.

"Keep it dry for the next few days," she instructed, her voice calm but firm.

"This is just basic first aid. If it worsens, you'll need proper medical attention."

The medical kit was limited, and the conditions weren't sterile. A wound like this needed stitches. The metallic scent of blood hung heavy in the air, so Evelyn cracked open a window, letting in a cool breeze.

Behind her, Dominic had propped himself up.

Though his face was still pale, his gaze was sharp—predatory—as it locked onto her.

While packing away her tools, Evelyn said quietly, "I'm not curious."

Once everything was tidied, she pulled out her pulse monitor and placed Dominic's wrist against it.

His heartbeat was strong, steady.

Not at all like a man who had just narrowly escaped death.

Everything seemed stable.

"The wound is treated. You should start antibiotics," she said.

"For your leg, I'll write you a prescription for herbal medicine. Soak it in warm water—not too hot—for thirty minutes daily. After three days, come back for another check." She grabbed a pen and paper, swiftly writing out the instructions.

In under two minutes, she slid the neatly written prescription toward him.

"My work here is done. Please have someone escort me out."

Whitmore Manor was vast, a labyrinth of halls and corridors. Without guidance, she'd never find her way out.

Dominic leaned back, one arm propped behind his head, his lips curling into a smirk.

"Why the hurry? It's late. Stay the night."

His hand shot out, gripping her wrist and yanking her forward. Caught off guard, Evelyn stumbled, landing on her knees beside the bed.

Now eye-level with him, their gazes locked.

Dominic's eyes held a dangerous glint—playful yet predatory.

"You know what they say about me, don't you? I never let things go."

"You caused me quite a bit of pain. What do you think you owe me?"

Despite the threat in his words, there was an odd warmth beneath them.

Evelyn arched a brow. "I told you to go to a hospital. You insisted I handle it. Your pain isn't entirely my fault."

"What if I want to blame you anyway?"

"Then you're just being unreasonable."

Dominic chuckled, low and dark. "And here I thought you knew me. Being unreasonable is my specialty."

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

Before she could react, his hand cupped her cheek.

She jerked back—but Dominic was faster. His fingers tangled in her hair, pulling her close.

Evelyn nearly fell against him.

"Stay with me. What do you say?"

His gaze was too intense to be a joke.

His eyes dropped to her lips—soft, pink, tempting.

His lashes lowered as his arm slid around her waist, pulling her flush against him while his other hand cradled the back of her head.

Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief.
###Chapter 526

Evelyn pressed her palms firmly against Dominic's chest, shoving him backward onto the plush bed.

"Dominic, get a grip! I only came to treat your injury! I'm a married woman! This is completely inappropriate!"

Anyone with eyes could see what Dominic had attempted - forcing himself on her for a stolen kiss.

A wicked grin curled Dominic's lips. "What's the problem? You're married, I'm engaged. Doesn't that make it more exciting? The thrill of forbidden fruit?"

When Evelyn had pushed him, she'd accidentally hit his wounded shoulder. Though pain radiated through his chest, he maintained that infuriating smirk.

Evelyn found herself speechless at his twisted reasoning.

She recoiled from his touch, putting several feet between them.

"I'm carrying Alexander's child. You need to erase whatever sick fantasy you're entertaining."

Dominic's grin only widened, his eyes sparkling with dark amusement. "Perfect timing then, isn't it? You're pregnant, I'm injured. One reckless night together would be quite the adventure, don't you think?" Evelyn bit her tongue hard.

She couldn't fathom what kind of depraved pleasure he was imagining.

Evelyn refused to continue this disturbing conversation.

She'd done her medical duty - nothing more.

Perhaps from blood loss, Dominic's complexion had turned ashen. After their brief exchange, exhaustion etched deep lines across his face.

Seizing the moment of vulnerability, Evelyn swiftly produced two silver needles and pressed them into precise pressure points. Dominic's eyelids immediately grew heavy. Evelyn couldn't leave fast enough.

Still seething, she tucked the blanket around him but deliberately pinched his wound area.

"Did you really think I wouldn't retaliate?" she thought venomously.

Dominic's eyes fluttered half-open as the sudden pain made him hiss sharply.

What shocked Evelyn most was Dominic's reaction - instead of anger, he actually smiled at her!

His darkened eyes gleamed as he murmured, "Once you heal my leg, darling, we'll have all the time in the world to... acquaint ourselves better."

Evelyn remained stonily silent.

Absolute nonsense!

As Evelyn turned to leave, Dominic's assistant Nathaniel appeared to escort her out.

Walking through the manor corridors, Evelyn gave crisp instructions: "Keep the wound dry, and ensure he takes the medicinal bath for three consecutive days."

"Understood, Ms. Carter."

Nathaniel respectfully guided her to the Powell Manor gates, his parting words polite yet loaded: "You're always welcome here, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn had no intention of ever returning. The entire estate felt oppressive and sinister.

Especially Dominic... his predatory demeanor made her skin crawl.

After healing his leg, she vowed to sever all connections.

As she departed, Evelyn failed to notice the shadowy figure observing her from an upper window.

Vanessa stood pensively, watching Evelyn's retreating form.

"Why would Evelyn be leaving Dominic's private quarters so late at night? What exactly were they doing in there?"

"Vanessa, what has captured your attention so?" came a smooth male voice behind her.

The impeccably groomed man was Sebastian Powell, Dominic's elder brother.

Vanessa had come to Powell Manor for business negotiations - Horizon Enterprises needed a patent Sebastian controlled. The discussions had run later than expected. She never anticipated spotting Evelyn on her way out.

Covertly, Vanessa snapped a photo with her phone.

Turning to Sebastian with practiced charm, she said, "Oh nothing, just admiring your magnificent peonies in the moonlight."

Once outside the manor gates, Vanessa immediately forwarded the photo to Ethan.

"Ethan, look at this. Evelyn sneaking out of Dominic's room in the dead of night. Doesn't this suggest something... inappropriate between them?"
###Chapter 527

The phone rang at midnight.

It was Ethan.

"Vanessa, shut your mouth! Stop spewing nonsense!" His voice was sharp with anger. "Don't project your filthy thoughts onto others!"

Vanessa felt the sting of injustice. She hadn't said anything wrong.

By the time she returned to the Hawthorne Estate, the clock had long passed midnight.

A hot shower later, she slipped into a silk nightgown that clung to her curves.

Standing before the mirror, she admired her reflection—flawless from every angle.

She remembered how Ethan used to worship her.

In their happiest days, he would cradle her face in his hands and whisper how breathtaking she was.

But now? He barely looked at her anymore.

The neglect gnawed at her.

Ethan hadn't come home yet. Lately, he'd been preoccupied, leaving early and returning late.

Not wanting to provoke him, Vanessa had avoided questioning his whereabouts.

She poured herself a glass of Merlot from the wine cabinet. Halfway through, the front door clicked open.

Adjusting the neckline of her gown, she sauntered toward Ethan, fingers curling around his tie to pull him inside. The contrast between his crisp suit and her barely-there nightwear was stark.

This was her favorite set—black lace that accentuated every curve.

Her gaze burned with intent as she looked up at him.

"Ethan, you're finally home. It's been so long since we—"

Their last intimate moment had been at the hospital after her miscarriage.

That night, something primal had stirred in Ethan. Despite his injuries, he'd clung to her with desperate need.

Vanessa had hoped it would change things between them.

But the distance only grew.

These days, he barely spoke to her.

Tonight, she'd merely hinted at something between Evelyn and Dominic, and Ethan had exploded.

His constant defense of Evelyn cut deep.

He was her husband, damn it!

Vanessa's gaze smoldered with open invitation.

Ethan noticed.

And couldn't have cared less.

He raised a hand, pushing her away with cold detachment. "I'm tired. It's late. You should sleep."

Grabbing his pajamas, he turned toward the guest room.

Vanessa stood frozen.

Wasn't she making herself obvious enough?

She was practically throwing herself at him! How could he just—

Her arms wrapped around his waist from behind, delicate fingers tracing his abdomen.

Today was her fertile window. If they slept together now, she might conceive.

She couldn't waste this chance.

Since the miscarriage, Eleanor had reverted to treating her like garbage.

With Ethan pulling away, Vanessa needed an anchor. A baby would secure her position.

"Ethan, we're married. I don't want separate beds."

He peeled her hands off like removing lint.

"My heart belongs to Evelyn. If you can't accept that, we'll divorce."

The door clicked shut behind him.

Vanessa stood alone, her reflection in the mirror twisting with disbelief.
###Chapter 528

"How could Ethan say those words to me with such brutal honesty? That his heart belongs to another woman?
Does my husband not care at all about how this makes me feel?

Is he rejecting intimacy with me because he's saving himself for Evelyn?
What a cruel joke!
My own husband, remaining faithful to someone else!"

Vanessa's humiliation burned like acid in her chest.

Across the mansion, Ethan lay in the guest room with his eyes shut tight, his mind a storm of dark thoughts.
Evelyn had met with Dominic again tonight. She'd even gone to Powell Manor.

"What happened between them?"

The memory flashed before his eyes—Evelyn begging Dominic to spare him as thugs dragged him toward a speeding car.

That reckless woman. Please tell me she didn't agree to any of Dominic's twisted demands just to protect me.

Dominic was a predator who recognized no boundaries.

The possibilities twisted in Ethan's gut until he could bear it no longer. He threw open his door and stormed toward the attic where Alexander and Evelyn stayed at Whitmore Manor.

Dark windows. No lights.

Ethan stood frozen in the shadows until a familiar voice cut through the night.

"Looking for someone?"

Alexander materialized from the darkness, his knuckles connecting with Ethan's jaw before the younger man could react.

"Get lost."

The punch landed with brutal precision, blooming fresh pain beside yesterday's fading bruise.

But Ethan wiped his bleeding lip and stood his ground.

"She's not back yet, is she? Alexander, do you even know where your wife is right now?"

Alexander didn't bother explaining Evelyn's orchestra rehearsal.

He lit a cigarette instead, the ember flaring in the night breeze.

"Ethan, you ever hear how I handled escape attempts at the police academy?" His voice was deceptively calm.

"One prisoner thought he could outrun me. I shattered both his kneecaps. He still can't walk without crutches. Want to test that theory?"

The threat hung between them like a drawn blade.

But Ethan couldn't walk away. Not with Evelyn in danger.

"Alexander, Vanessa saw Evelyn leaving Dominic's suite at Powell Manor tonight. You know what that monster's capable of. At this hour—"

Tires screeched before he could finish.

Alexander was already in his car, dialing Evelyn's number with shaking hands.

No answer.

The orchestra hall loomed ahead, its doors locked tight against latecomers. Security blocked Alexander at the entrance.

He redialed, desperation clawing at his throat.

This time, the line connected.
###Chapter 529

Evelyn's voice was thick with sleep, as if she'd been dragged from the depths of a dream.

She murmured, "What is it? I just fell asleep."

Hearing her, Alexander exhaled sharply, tension easing from his shoulders. "Evelyn, where are you?"

Rubbing her eyes, she glanced at her phone. Over a dozen missed calls from Alexander, all within the last thirty minutes.

"I'm in the orchestra dorm. Why the sudden urgency?"

The night was cold, the wind biting.

Outside, Alexander rolled down his car window halfway, letting the chill tangle through his hair.

The icy air kept him sharp. Even past 1 AM, sleep was the furthest thing from his mind.

Nathan's words from earlier gnawed at him, stirring an unease he couldn't shake.

Dim streetlights painted shadows across Alexander's striking features, his expression unreadable.

"Evelyn, did anything happen tonight? Did you... see anyone?"

He didn’t know what was happening, but he needed answers.

Still groggy, Evelyn didn’t catch his meaning. "Well, I saw some orchestra members, the lunch crowd at the cafeteria, and..." She hesitated. "Oh, right. Dominic."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Dominic?"

So Nathan hadn’t lied.

Evelyn had met with Dominic.

Just then, a sleek black car glided into the driveway of a nearby mansion.

Alexander’s gaze followed it, landing on the Powell family crest mounted beside the entrance.

His eyes narrowed.

This wasn’t just any neighborhood.

Only the elite of Cresthaven lived here. The Powells were practically next door to the orchestra—just a wall away. He hadn’t noticed earlier.

Alexander stepped out of his car.

Leaning against the hood, phone pressed to his ear, he kept his tone casual. "How do you know Dominic?"

Evelyn hesitated. She remembered the fireworks, the near-accident, the way Dominic had pulled her to safety.

She owed him.

But she’d promised secrecy about his condition.

"Tonight, I was walking around campus when Dominic fell from the wall. He was limping, so I helped him back to Powell Manor."

Silence stretched between them. Then, carefully, Alexander asked, "And after? Did he give you trouble?"

Not wanting to worry him, Evelyn deflected. "Nothing serious. Where are you? I hear wind."

"I'm outside your dorm."

Evelyn froze.

She scrambled out of bed, pulling her robe tight as she rushed to the window.

There, beneath the glow of the streetlights, was Alexander’s car, headlights still on.

Her heart leaped.

She threw open the door and raced downstairs, appearing before him moments later, breathless.

"What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 530

The moment Alexander laid eyes on Evelyn, he pulled her into a tight embrace.

After an exhausting business dinner that ran late into the night, he'd finally returned home well past midnight. Now, holding the woman he'd been craving all day, Alexander felt an intense wave of satisfaction wash over him.

He was already regretting his decision.

Just one day apart, and he couldn't stand being separated from her.

If he'd known it would feel like this, he never would have agreed to let her stay at the orchestra residence.

"I just wanted to see you for a moment. I'll leave soon. Did I wake you?"
"Not at all."

They stood wrapped in each other's arms outside the orchestra building, completely lost in their private world.

Evelyn never expected Alexander would come looking for her so late at night.

It made her heart flutter, knowing he cared this deeply.

They were so absorbed in each other that neither noticed the figure watching them from behind a massive oak tree fifty meters away.

Dominic pressed his tongue against his cheek, a dangerous glint in his eyes.

Unable to sleep due to the throbbing pain in his shoulder wound, he'd asked Nathaniel to wheel him outside for some fresh air.

He never imagined they'd stumble upon such an intimate scene right after stepping out.

Dominic's fingers absently played with the dagger at his waist as he spoke with feigned indifference. "Nathaniel, what does it mean when a woman carries a man's handkerchief with her at all times?"

Nathaniel hesitated before answering, "I suppose it means she has feelings for him?"

Dominic nearly choked on his cigarette smoke at the response.

"So Evelyn has feelings for me, then?"

Earlier that evening, she'd used the handkerchief he'd given her days ago to dress his shoulder wound.

The sight of Evelyn casually producing that handkerchief had frozen him momentarily.

Exhaling a slow stream of smoke, Dominic adjusted his collar. "If she likes me, then why did she refuse when I asked her to come to my bed?" Nathaniel fell silent.

He wiped his forehead nervously, suddenly regretting his earlier answer.

After an awkward pause, Nathaniel ventured, "Perhaps...she's just being coy?"

Dominic's gaze darkened as he watched the embracing couple. "If she's interested in me, why is she wrapped around another man?" Hearing the dangerous edge in Dominic's voice, Nathaniel went completely still.

He lowered his head, pretending not to hear.

Evelyn stood quietly in her nightgown.

Her long hair cascaded down her back, a few loose strands resting on her shoulders, with slender legs visible beneath the hem.

Despite her pregnancy, her figure remained delicate. She looked more like a university student than an expectant mother.

Dominic frowned, studying the couple intently. "Tell me honestly - am I inferior to Alexander in any way?"

Nathaniel immediately responded, "Mr. Powell, you surpass him in every aspect!"

"We've both been through similar hardships, our experiences mirror each other." Dominic stubbed out his cigarette and sheathed his knife.

"So her relationship with Alexander must be just for show. Why else would she suddenly move to the orchestra? Isn't it because she knows Powell Manor is next door? She wants to be closer to me." A slow smile spread across Dominic's face.

Across the way, after their brief embrace, Evelyn returned to the orchestra alone.

If a woman truly cared for a man, she'd watch his car drive away before going inside.

But she didn't.

Dominic's eyes followed Evelyn's retreating figure.

"She offered to treat my injury just to spend more time with me."

"Moving to the orchestra was her way of escaping her current relationship, avoiding daily contact with him."

"She refused my advances because she's afraid I'd lose interest after having her. Classic playing hard to get."

Dominic's lips tightened, his usually cold voice softening unexpectedly.

"I'm only now realizing how deeply she cares for me."
###Chapter 531

The first light of dawn had barely touched the sky when Evelyn Carter rose from bed, her prized cello case already in hand.

She'd received a text from Alexander last night - he promised to visit the orchestra hall today to hear her play.

The practice room stood empty when she arrived, its silence welcoming. Evelyn settled onto the chair and began tuning her instrument, but the first note had scarcely sounded when the door swung open.

Cassandra Brown stood framed in the doorway, her lips curling in disdain. "You again? Still clinging to the orchestra like some desperate groupie?"

Cassandra's sharp eyes immediately zeroed in on the exquisite cello resting against Evelyn's knees.

"That instrument..." Her voice dripped with barely concealed envy. "How did trash like you get your hands on something so valuable?"

The cello had been Alexander's gift - purchased at auction from a legendary musician who happened to be Cassandra's personal idol.

Evelyn remained silent, her fingers gently caressing the strings.

Cassandra's face twisted at being ignored. "Save your breath. Everyone knows Maestro Herty doesn't take just anyone as a student, no matter how expensive their toys are!"

Other musicians began trickling into the room, including Cassandra's usual sycophants - Miranda and Eleanor.

Hearing cello music from the hallway, Miranda called out without looking, "Cassandra, that phrasing is exquisite! Far superior to yesterday's rehearsal."

Their footsteps faltered when they saw Evelyn holding the bow instead. An awkward silence descended.

Cassandra shot them a venomous glare.

Eleanor quickly recovered, sneering, "Our principal cellist graduated from Juilliard. Some amateur with a fancy instrument could never compare."

Evelyn continued playing yesterday's practice piece from memory, though several notes went slightly off-key.

Miranda smirked. "See? She can't even read sheet music properly. An embarrassment to the section."

Cassandra preened, covering her laugh with a delicate hand. "And she actually thinks Maestro Herty would consider teaching her."

"Delusional!" Miranda scoffed. "Even someone of Cassandra's caliber only managed a single masterclass with him."

Ethan Miller entered mid-conversation, shaking his head at their petty behavior.

In hushed tones, Miranda added, "I saw her last night, wrapped around some wealthy-looking man in a luxury car outside the hall."

Eleanor's eyes gleamed with malice. "Do you think she's... you know... sleeping her way in here? Was that her sugar daddy?"

Cassandra's smile turned predatory. "Explains the expensive instrument. Just another rich man's plaything pretending to be serious about music."

Evelyn carefully set down her bow and rose to her full height.

Turning to Cassandra, she said coolly, "Did you gargle with sewage this morning? Because your words reek of it."

Cassandra's face blanched. "How dare you speak to me like that?"

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "The loudest stench always comes from the foulest mouth. Should I draw you a diagram?"

"You—" Cassandra sputtered. Thanks to her father's position as associate conductor, no one in the orchestra had ever challenged her before.

"You'll regret this! My father will have you thrown out before lunch!"
###Chapter 532

Evelyn turned to storm off in fury.

Leonard let out a mocking scoff. "How old are you really? A grown woman still running to daddy when things don't go your way? Maybe you should just crawl back under his wing permanently if you're going to act this childish."

Cassandra's eyes burned with rage, her entire frame shaking with barely contained anger.

The cutting words froze Evelyn in place, torn between leaving and staying.

Blinded by fury, Cassandra lunged forward, hand raised to strike.

Evelyn caught the wrist mid-air, her gaze turning icy.

"I came here to study under Mr. Herty, not to entertain your tantrums. This orchestra isn't your personal playground. Consider this your only warning - stay away from me. Next time, you won't walk away so easily."

Every practice room was equipped with high-definition surveillance. Any physical altercation would be clearly documented.

Cassandra bit her lip hard.

Violence was strictly prohibited in the orchestra. Any physical confrontation meant severe consequences. Not even her father, the deputy conductor, could overlook such blatant evidence without compromising his authority.

Cassandra lowered her hand with visible effort. "Just wait until Mr. Herty returns from his trip. I can't wait to see you get thrown out!"

The orchestra had zero tolerance for dead weight.

New members required a mentor's guidance and approval before earning performance privileges.

Without an instructor, even if Evelyn had connections to get in, she'd remain perpetually stuck as an apprentice.

Cassandra flopped onto her chair, preparing to practice her violin when Leonard suddenly entered.

All eyes brightened at his unexpected appearance.

Cassandra sprang to her feet, eyes gleaming. "Mr. Herty! We don't have a masterclass scheduled today, do we?"

As the orchestra's brightest star, Leonard commanded attention wherever he went.

Given his prestigious status, he rarely attended regular rehearsals.

He only appeared for significant state events, making his presence now particularly noteworthy.

Leonard's gaze swept across the room before settling on Evelyn.

"I'm here for my new apprentice."

"Apprentice?"

Leonard gestured impatiently. "Stop dawdling. Come greet your new teacher properly!"

Cassandra and her two companions stood frozen.

Their jaws dropped comically wide, as if trying to catch invisible flies.

"Mr. Herty...you're taking her as your student?"

Leonard turned to Cassandra. "I've been watching this remarkable talent for some time. Better claim her before another master snatches her away."

He called out again, sharper this time. "Evelyn! Stop wasting my time."

Evelyn approached with her cello. "Mr. Herty."

Cassandra's mind reeled.

Leonard had placed Evelyn on an impossibly high pedestal.

More shockingly, his wording suggested Evelyn hadn't sought him out - he'd actively chosen her.

Among all the musicians vying for Leonard's attention, countless had begged to become his students only to be rejected. Yet here he was, selecting Evelyn as his final protégé.

"Why can't that honor be mine?" Cassandra seethed inwardly.

For three consecutive years, she'd personally visited Leonard's residence. Even with her father's influence as deputy conductor, Leonard had remained unmoved!
###Chapter 533

The golden afternoon light streamed through the practice room windows as Evelyn's bow glided across the cello strings. Having been immersed in classical music since childhood and now studying under a maestro like Leonard Herty, her progress had been extraordinary.

In merely seven days, her technique had transformed dramatically.

"Looking for a lucrative gig?" Leonard's voice interrupted her practice.

Evelyn lifted her bow from the strings. "What do you have in mind?"

"There's a luxury hotel grand opening tonight. They need a solo cellist." Leonard adjusted his glasses. "Five grand for one hour's performance. Perfect opportunity to gain experience."

After brief consideration, Evelyn nodded. Constant performance was the only path to mastery. And five thousand dollars for sixty minutes? That was opportunity knocking.

She carefully packed her prized cello, then returned to her dorm to prepare before heading home.

Alexander had called at dawn, promising to leave work early to collect her. They'd planned a romantic dinner before her performance - the timing worked perfectly. Her suitcase held a sleek cocktail dress for changing at the venue.

"Are you close?"

Standing at the orchestra building entrance, Evelyn scanned the street with her performance bag. One hand held her phone while the other adjusted her subtle makeup - just enough to accentuate her natural elegance, giving her an almost otherworldly glow.

"Right behind you," Alexander's familiar voice answered.

She turned to see his luxury sedan idling at the curb. Evelyn hurried toward it. "We should leave soon. I've got preparations after dinner."

Her hand froze on the door handle as she glimpsed the interior.

The backseat wasn't empty.

Alexander sat beside Isabella Morgan, their thighs nearly touching in the confined space. No room remained for Evelyn.

Her stomach dropped. "I see you've... made alternate arrangements?" The words tasted bitter. This dinner she'd anticipated all week had become something else entirely.

Disappointment flooded her veins. How many times had Alexander met Isabella during her intensive week at the orchestra?

The morning call replaying in her mind - Alexander's promise of trying a new restaurant, just the two of them - now felt like cruel mockery.

Isabella emerged gracefully, her bandaged wrist prominently displayed. "Don't be jealous, Evelyn!" Her musical laugh carried across the pavement. "I got discharged today and hitched a ride when I heard Alexander was coming."

She moved toward the trunk, struggling with her violin case before pouting at Alexander. "It's too heavy with my injury. Be a dear?"

Evelyn's breath caught.

"Isabella works here too?" The realization struck like icy water.

Isabella flashed a triumphant smile. "Oh yes, first chair violin. Heard you're joining us? We'll be seeing plenty of each other, colleague."
###Chapter 534

Alexander remained seated in the car.

With just a subtle nod from him, Simon immediately stepped out of the front seat.

He grabbed Isabella's luggage and began walking ahead. "Ms. Morgan, allow me to escort you to your dormitory."

Isabella shot Alexander a disappointed glance but knew better than to argue further.

She gave a tight smile. "Thank you, I appreciate that."

Evelyn slid into the car beside Alexander.

Discovering Isabella worked at the same orchestra had been the last thing she expected.

Evelyn could sense the hostility radiating from Isabella.

This was going to make orchestra rehearsals... interesting.

As Simon's absence stretched on, Evelyn kept glancing at her watch.

The performance started at precisely 8 PM, and it was already 7.

If they hurried, they might still have time for a quick dinner.

Alexander draped his arm around Evelyn's shoulders. "You've been quiet. What's troubling you?"

"Just thinking about Isabella."

Alexander's eyes darkened. He'd noticed Evelyn's mood shift the moment she saw Isabella in his car.

He pulled her closer, inhaling the floral scent of her hair.

"I only gave her a ride because we were going the same direction. Don't read too much into it."

"She just returned from abroad and claimed she didn't have any ride-sharing apps installed. She was flagging me down from halfway across the parking lot - I couldn't just drive past."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "How would you know she doesn't have ride-sharing apps?"

"She told me herself."

Alexander's expression grew serious. He understood Evelyn's concern.

"Evelyn, I have zero interest in her. You're my wife. The only woman in my heart. Nothing could ever happen between us."

As he spoke, Alexander leaned in closer.

He closed his eyes and cradled the back of her head, his lips seeking hers.

After a week apart, his longing overflowed like champagne from an overfilled glass.

He'd missed her terribly.

In this moment, with Evelyn's doubts swirling, no words could reassure her like this physical connection.

Alexander wanted his actions to demonstrate how irreplaceable she was to him.

Their breaths mingled as Evelyn's pulse quickened.

In the intimate confines of the car, every sensation felt magnified.

All Alexander wanted was to pull Evelyn close and kiss her as if the world had ceased to exist.

His lips met hers in a searing kiss.

"Wearing lipstick?"

He could taste the faint strawberry flavor of her gloss.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed. Even though they were alone, they were still parked on a public street.

With a playful grin, Alexander took her hand and drew her nearer.

Gazing at her with adoration, he murmured, "You look stunning. That shade suits you perfectly."

His eyes locked with hers. "Please don't be upset about Isabella. Evelyn, you've always been so understanding. Don't put me in this difficult position."

From Alexander's perspective, the situation was complicated.

Isabella was his late friend's sister with no one else to turn to, and he'd promised to watch over her.

Meanwhile, his wife kept pressing him about it.

After a long pause, Evelyn released a slow breath. She decided to trust Alexander this once.

"Alright," she said softly.

Alexander pulled Evelyn closer, his eyes brimming with affection.

He guided her to sit beside him and enveloped her in a warm embrace, silently conveying his love and gratitude.
###Chapter 535

"How much longer until the baby arrives?" Alexander asked, tracing circles on Evelyn's swollen belly with a frustrated sigh. The forced abstinence was driving him mad.

As a man with an insatiable appetite, going from nightly passion to cold showers felt like cruel punishment. He might as well have taken monastic vows.

Evelyn did quick calculations in her head. "Five or six months, I suppose."

Alexander's jaw dropped.

Suddenly changing topics, he asked, "That child in Claire's womb - is it really Lucas's?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise at the unexpected question about her best friend.

But it made sense. Alexander and Lucas were close. Of course he'd be curious.

She hesitated, torn between honesty and loyalty. "I'm not sure," she murmured.

Alexander noticed her evasion but didn't press. Instead, he playfully booped her nose. "Keeping secrets from your own husband now?"

Evelyn responded with a mysterious smile.

Just then, Simon returned - with Isabella in tow.

To Evelyn's astonishment, the woman rapped on their car window, flashing Alexander a dazzling smile. "Heading to dinner? Mind if I join? I've been dying to try that new bistro."

After Simon had escorted her upstairs earlier, Isabella had asked him to wait outside her door. When she reappeared minutes later, she'd transformed - clad in a designer cocktail dress with freshly painted lips, clearly having put considerable effort into her appearance.

Now, her uninvited dinner request made Simon visibly uncomfortable. She knew perfectly well this was meant to be a romantic date, yet here she was, inserting herself deliberately.

Alexander's voice turned icy. "You really want to come with us?"

Isabella batted her eyelashes innocently. "Oh come on, Alex! They serve my favorite dishes there. I'm absolutely famished!" Without waiting for permission, she yanked open the passenger door and slid in.

Simon rolled his eyes at her shamelessness. Why couldn't this woman take a hint? Her constant pursuit of taken men reeked of desperation.

Noticing Evelyn's pursed lips, Alexander explained, "That new French place at Willow Mall. Just opened today."

The car ride became painfully silent despite Isabella's multiple failed attempts at conversation.

Thirty minutes later, they arrived at the mall's parking garage.

A hostess greeted the awkward trio and led them to their table. Alexander immediately noticed Evelyn lagging behind, her expression troubled.

"Not feeling French cuisine? We could go somewhere else - just us two?"

"Don't bother!" Evelyn interjected. "You two enjoy. I have work to do." Turning to the hostess, she asked, "Where's the dressing room?"

As the hostess pointed the way, Evelyn strode off with her bag.

Alexander stood frozen, watching her retreating figure.

Isabella winced dramatically. "Did I upset your wife? I'm so sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to intrude. I just really wanted to try this place."

Alexander remained silent.

Minutes later, Evelyn emerged in her performance gown, taking her place at the restaurant's grand piano. With a few expert adjustments, she began tuning the magnificent instrument.
###Chapter 536

Alexander froze when he saw Evelyn pick up her cello, finally understanding what she meant by "having to work" earlier.

His breath caught when he realized Evelyn was performing at this very hotel tonight.

A waiter approached with menus. Isabella ordered several dishes before sliding one toward Alexander.

"Their bouillabaisse is supposedly divine. Care to try?" she asked.

Alexander shook his head. "You enjoy."

He couldn't possibly feast with another woman while his wife worked mere feet away.

The thought turned his stomach.

Abandoning Isabella mid-meal, he moved to the table closest to Evelyn's performance area, watching her intently.

When her order arrived alone, Isabella's face darkened with humiliation.

Every other table in the French restaurant was filled with couples, leaving her conspicuously solitary.

Evelyn's fingers danced across the cello strings effortlessly, each note resonating perfectly through the elegant space. Several male diners cast appreciative glances her way.

One particularly bold gentleman even slipped her his business card between pieces.

Though focused on her performance, Evelyn could feel someone's intense gaze burning into her.

When she finally looked up, her eyes locked with Alexander's. Her bow faltered momentarily at the realization he'd changed tables.

"Wasn't he supposed to be dining with Isabella?" she wondered.

As Evelyn concluded her final piece and set down her bow, an elegant bouquet appeared before her.

"Miss, might I have the pleasure of your contact information?"

A handsome biracial man with striking blue eyes presented roses directly in Alexander's line of sight.

Evelyn instinctively glanced toward her husband before murmuring, "My husband is sitting right there."

The man froze as Alexander approached, claiming Evelyn's hand possessively.

Producing a bouquet of lilies from behind his back, Alexander gave the interloper a pointed look. "Lilies happen to be my wife's favorite."

After the man retreated awkwardly, Alexander guided Evelyn to a seat.

"You must be exhausted. I ordered this for you - eat while it's warm." His brow furrowed. "Why didn't you tell me about this performance?"

"Mr. Herty recommended it last minute," Evelyn began, but Alexander's phone interrupted.

Stepping away to take the call, he left Evelyn momentarily alone - precisely when Isabella struck.

"Lovely performance," Isabella purered, her compliment dripping with false sweetness.

Evelyn maintained polite composure. "Thank you."

Isabella slid into Alexander's vacant chair.

"Rumor has it you're carrying Ethan's child." Her eyes gleamed maliciously. "Since you're already cheating, when will you divorce Alexander?"

Evelyn's expression frosted over.

She set down her fork deliberately. "Eager for my marriage to end?"

"Alexander's too naive. I'd hate to see him raising another man's child unknowingly."

Isabella leaned closer. "How much did Ethan pay you to bear his bastard?"

Every suspicion Evelyn harbored about Isabella's motives crystallized in that moment.

This childhood friend's return was no coincidence. She wanted Alexander.

Never had Evelyn encountered a homewrecker so brazenly confrontational.

Rather than anger, cold amusement curled Evelyn's lips. "How much did your father pay your mother to conceive you?"

The barb struck true.

Isabella flushed crimson. "How dare you!"

Evelyn sipped her juice calmly. "Pursuing a married man reflects poorly on your upbringing, Ms. Morgan. Your parents have been gone over a decade - must they roll in their graves at your behavior?"

"You—"

Blind with rage, Isabella snatched a water glass and hurled its contents at Evelyn's face.
###Chapter 537

Evelyn never imagined Isabella would dare to physically lash out in such a public setting.

The glass of water came flying toward her without warning, catching her completely off guard.

At that exact moment, Alexander stepped back inside after finishing his phone call outside.

With lightning reflexes, he positioned himself in front of Evelyn, taking the full impact on his tailored suit jacket.

Isabella froze, her face draining of color as she realized Alexander had witnessed everything.

Alexander's expression darkened like a gathering storm, his jaw tightening with barely contained fury.

Isabella bit her lower lip hard enough to leave marks. "Alexander, I... It wasn't intentional."

Her words stumbled out in a nervous rush.

The back of Alexander's suit was completely soaked through, making his glare even icier.

He pulled Evelyn protectively against his side. "Isabella, how could you attack Evelyn like this?"

Had he been even a second slower, Evelyn would have been drenched.

The disappointment in Alexander's eyes as he looked at Isabella was palpable.

Isabella's eyes welled up instantly, her voice thick with emotion. Tears began streaming down her cheeks in dramatic rivulets.

She sobbed dramatically, "I know I lost control, but she insulted my family, Alexander! She mocked Andrew... My brother died because of you, how could she speak about him that way..."

Alexander stiffened, glancing back at Evelyn with sudden uncertainty.

Evelyn was stunned by Isabella's masterful manipulation of the truth. "When did I ever mention your brother?"

Just as Evelyn started to explain, Isabella covered her face with both hands and burst into louder sobs.

"We were just talking normally! I don't know what I said wrong, but she suddenly accused me of being uncultured," Isabella wailed.

"Andrew loved me most in this world. If he were still alive, he'd never let me suffer like this," she cried dramatically.

"Alexander, I was the one wronged first. Don't I have the right to defend myself?"

Her tear-filled eyes looked pitifully up at Alexander. The commotion had drawn curious stares from nearby patrons.

Alexander rubbed his temples in frustration. "That's enough."

Isabella's tears made her eyes glisten like crystal. "Alexander, everything's different now that you're married. I understand Evelyn dislikes me, but why must she insult my family?"

Evelyn couldn't remain silent any longer. "I never insulted your family!"

Isabella shot back immediately, "Then why would I throw water at you for no reason?"

"Isabella, have you no shame?!"

"Enough!" Alexander cut them off sharply. The argument was spiraling out of control. "It's late. Everyone should go home."

Evelyn froze at his words.

Since Alexander hadn't defended her or indicated whose side he believed, a sharp pang of disappointment pierced her chest.

Isabella flashed Evelyn a triumphant smirk before turning to Alexander with a soft, pleading voice. "It's so late... It'll be impossible to find a cab..."

Evelyn pulled away from Alexander's embrace.

She refused to create a public spectacle by forcing Alexander to choose between them.

It was beneath her dignity.

"Take her home. I need some space," Evelyn said coolly before turning on her heel.

Alexander instinctively moved to follow, but Isabella grabbed his sleeve desperately.

"Alexander, you'd really make me go back alone?" Her tear-filled eyes looked up pathetically. "When a woman says she needs space, you should respect that."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "I'll call you a car."

"No!" Isabella protested, biting her lip with exaggerated hurt.

Fresh tears spilled over as she dug in her heels stubbornly.

"All those years abroad, I was completely alone. I had to do everything by myself. I'm so tired of being lonely."

"Now that I'm finally home, I just want to be near you. You're all I have left... I have no family anymore..."
###Chapter 538
Alexander's voice was icy. "I'm a married man. It's inappropriate for us to be together this late. Evelyn might misunderstand."

He strode toward the exit, with Isabella trailing closely behind.

Outside Willow Mall, Evelyn hadn't gone far.

"Evelyn!"

Just as Alexander called her name, Isabella suddenly tripped.

Her foot caught on the steps, sending her tumbling straight into Alexander's arms.

Isabella immediately wrapped herself around him, clinging like ivy to an oak.

When Evelyn turned at the sound of Alexander's voice, she saw them locked in an embrace.

Isabella's arms were wrapped tightly around Alexander's waist, her face pressed against his chest. Alexander's hands—the same hands that had once caressed Evelyn so tenderly—now gripped Isabella's shoulders.

Evelyn's lips trembled as her heart turned to stone. A cold numbness spread from her toes, freezing her thoughts completely.

She didn't scream. Didn't make a scene. Just closed her eyes as silent tears traced her cheeks.

Without a backward glance, Evelyn vanished into the night.

Suddenly, her entire existence felt meaningless.

Moments ago, she had considered going back for the lilies Alexander had given her.

Now, the thought was laughable.

Alexander finally managed to push Isabella away.

She had stumbled into his arms so suddenly that he hadn't been able to react in time. His patience was wearing thin.

His gaze turned glacial. "You did that on purpose."

Isabella's eyes widened in feigned shock. "Why would I? It was an accident—there's a step right here!"

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Do you think I'm stupid?"

Isabella bit her lip. "Alexander, Evelyn doesn't deserve you! She—"

"Who are you to decide who deserves me?" His voice was a whip crack. "Since when do I need your opinion?"

Faced with his fury, Isabella lowered her head, tears spilling over.

She sobbed violently, her shoulders shaking with each cry.

Alexander exhaled sharply, irritation warring with reluctant pity at her red-rimmed eyes.

"Evelyn is my wife. If you truly consider yourself my friend, you will respect her."

"Throwing water at her was unacceptable, Isabella. You're not a child. Don't drag me into your petty games."

Tears dripped from Isabella's chin onto the marble floor. She looked up, her gaze brimming with wounded betrayal.

"So I should just take her insults? Even when she slanders my brother? Alexander, have you forgotten how Andrew died for you?"

At the mention of Andrew, Alexander fell silent.

After a long pause, he said quietly, "I trust Evelyn wouldn't speak ill of someone unrelated to her."

"You think I'm lying?" Isabella let out a hollow laugh, tilting her face toward the sky.

"Andrew, do you see this? This is the man you died saving. Alexander is nothing but a traitor, letting his wife spit on your memory. Was your sacrifice worth it?"

Alexander's frown deepened.

Isabella's dramatics planted a seed of doubt.

Could Evelyn really have said those things?

"Simon will drive you home," Alexander said flatly.

Isabella stood her ground. "I want Evelyn to apologize. To me. To my family. To Andrew's memory."

Alexander met her gaze, his own unreadable.

"If Evelyn truly did this, I will personally apologize to your entire family on her behalf."

"Alexander, you—" Isabella's voice cracked with disbelief.

His patience snapped. "Go home. I need to speak with Evelyn."
###Chapter 539

Evelyn didn't return home.

As twilight painted the sky, she found herself drifting through the city streets without direction.

This weekend was supposed to mark her reunion with Alexander after seven long days apart - a moment she'd been counting down to with restless anticipation.

They say distance makes hearts grow fonder. Earlier while practicing her cello, she'd wondered if their time apart might rekindle the spark between them. But Isabella's sudden appearance had shattered that fragile hope.

Alexander had promised to collect her from the symphony hall, yet Isabella sat smiling in his passenger seat.

He'd spoken of a romantic dinner for two, only for Isabella to appear at the restaurant as well.

It felt like a calculated invasion of their relationship.

A wave of melancholy crashed over Evelyn.

Was it just her pregnancy hormones making her overly sensitive? Was she blowing things out of proportion?

She struggled to push down the ache in her chest.

Her phone buzzed. Claire's name flashed on the screen. "Evelyn, where are you?" came the worried voice.

Evelyn nodded silently, the weight of disappointment pressing down on her.

She should have been celebrating - her part-time position at the luxury hotel paid five thousand monthly, more than she'd ever earned. Yet all she could think about was how desperately she wanted this disastrous day to end.

"Come stay with me tonight," Claire soothed. "You need rest, especially in your condition."

They settled into Claire's bed, pajamas exchanged. Claire, heavy with child, could only sleep on her side, exhaustion lining her face.

Evelyn's throat tightened. Soon that would be her reality.

At least Claire had Julian by her side.

Though not officially together, Julian's affection for Claire was undeniable. Given time, their friendship might blossom into something more. Julian was the epitome of thoughtfulness - warming milk for Claire each night, and tonight, for Evelyn too.

But who would be there for her?

When her time came, when she lay vulnerable in that hospital bed at midnight, would Alexander abandon her for Isabella without hesitation?

The thought chilled her to the bone.
###Chapter 540

The night stretched long as Evelyn and Claire talked about everything - motherhood, relationships, careers.

They agreed every woman needed a purpose beyond love, something to make her feel alive.

Evelyn drifted off first.

Claire lay awake, restless. Something felt off about Evelyn's mood tonight.

As her best friend, she couldn't ignore it.

She slipped out of bed quietly, grabbing her phone and stepping onto the balcony.

The night air was cool as she dialed Lucas's number.

He answered on the second ring, voice rough with surprise.

They hadn't spoken since the divorce papers were signed months ago. This was her first call.

Lucas's fingers tightened around his phone. His throat felt suddenly dry.

He forced calm into his voice, though his pulse raced. "What do you want?"

The ice in his tone made her pause. She hadn't considered how this might look.

"Do you know what's happening between Isabella and Alexander?" Claire asked directly.

The question deflated him. Of course she wasn't calling for herself.

After a beat, he understood - this was about Evelyn.

Isabella had returned from Paris and was circling Alexander again.

"It's complicated," he admitted. "If you want details, meet me tomorrow."

Claire had planned a quick phone call. This wasn't part of the script.

Seeing him again was the last thing she wanted.

Lucas sensed her hesitation. "Come on, Dawson. If you need my help, the least you can do is buy me lunch."

She exhaled sharply. "Fine. Text me the address. I'll find you."

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Evelyn woke to an empty bed.

She washed up and wandered out, finding Julian at the stove.

He'd been cooking for Claire these past months.

Claire raved about his skills so much she'd fired their private chef.

"You're awake," Julian smiled. "Where's Claire? Breakfast is ready."

"Not in the room," Evelyn frowned, scanning the apartment.

Julian turned off the burner, concern flashing across his face.

"Maybe she went for a walk?" Evelyn suggested.

Julian shook his head. "She never wakes before ten. I've been cooking since eight."

The implication settled between them.

Claire had left before eight.

Where would she go at that hour?

"Eat without us," Julian said, pulling off his apron. "I'm going to look for her."

An uneasy feeling twisted in Evelyn's gut. Something wasn't right.
###Chapter 541

The morning sunlight streamed through the windows as Evelyn Carter sat alone at her kitchen table, picking at her breakfast. Just as she finished clearing the dishes, her phone vibrated violently against the marble countertop.

Julian Mercer's name flashed on the caller ID.

"Evelyn! It's Claire!" His usually smooth voice cracked with urgency.

Her fingers tightened around the phone. "What happened?"

"It's complicated. Get to Mercy General now! She might be going into premature labor!" Julian's words tumbled out in a panicked rush.

In the background, Evelyn could make out Lucas Bennett's deep voice shouting for paramedics.

Her stomach dropped. Claire had gone to meet Lucas today.

How bad must it be if they needed an ambulance?

She kicked off her house slippers, grabbing the pre-packed hospital bag Julian had prepared weeks ago.

When Evelyn burst through the hospital doors, Claire was already being wheeled into the delivery suite.

Julian's cream-colored sweater was splattered with crimson stains that made Evelyn's blood run cold.

"What the hell happened?" she demanded.

The amount of blood terrified her. Something was terribly wrong.

Lucas stood nearby, his designer shirt sleeves rolled up to reveal blood-streaked forearms. He stared at the floor, shoulders hunched in obvious guilt.

Evelyn immediately understood this disaster involved him.

"I found her collapsed on the sidewalk, bleeding everywhere," Julian choked out.

His normally warm brown eyes burned with fury as he glared at Lucas. "Ask him. I'd like to hear his explanation too."

Evelyn turned on Lucas, her gaze sharp as broken glass. "Start talking."

Lucas ran a shaky hand through his hair, struggling to form words.

Earlier that morning, he'd arranged to meet Claire at The Copper Kettle. Their conversation began civilly enough, discussing Alexander Whitmore and Isabella Morgan's situation.

Then Claire had made a comparison that changed everything.

"Is Isabella just like Cassandra, throwing herself at taken men?" Claire had asked.

Given how Cassandra Reed had destroyed her own marriage, the parallel seemed obvious.

The mood shifted instantly.

Lucas had snapped back, "And what about you, Claire? You slept with someone else and got pregnant during our marriage."

At eight months along, Claire's baby bump was impossible to hide beneath her summer dress. The sight had triggered Lucas's unresolved bitterness.

Even now, he couldn't stomach the thought of Claire with another man.

Her visible pregnancy during their meeting felt like a public humiliation.

Claire, furious, had thrown her iced tea in Lucas's face.

"You shattered my heart first!" she'd screamed. "Whether I slept with someone else or not, you'll damn well live with the consequences!"

She'd stormed out, her designer handbag swinging violently.

Truthfully, Lucas had only asked to meet because he missed her.

He never expected their encounter to escalate like this.

Of course he'd chased after her - he still loved Claire.

But just steps from the café entrance, a delivery van had clipped her as she crossed without looking.

Seeing her crumpled form on the pavement, blood pooling beneath her, Lucas's mind had gone terrifyingly blank.
###Chapter 542

Julian arrived just in time.

He shoved Lucas aside and gathered Claire into his arms, his desperation palpable.

Evelyn turned to Lucas, her voice trembling with barely contained rage. "Lucas, explain this to me right now!"

Lucas swallowed hard. "There was a car accident."

Evelyn's vision swam, the edges of her sight darkening.

A strong arm encircled her waist, steadying her before she could collapse.

She glanced up—Alexander.

What was he doing here?

Dark shadows bruised beneath his eyes, evidence of sleepless nights.

But Evelyn had no time to dwell on that. She tore her gaze away and demanded, "How did this happen? Did you two fight?"

Lucas remained silent, guilt twisting his features.

His silence ignited her fury. She grabbed his collar, her voice a venomous whisper. "Lucas Bennett, if anything happens to Claire or that baby, I swear I'll destroy you. I don't care who you are."

Lucas looked broken. "I'll apologize to her myself," he murmured.

The woman he loved was fighting for her life, and he was drowning in regret.

He loved her more than anything, yet somehow, they had become strangers.

Everything with Lola had been a misunderstanding—he'd been manipulated too.

But that misunderstanding had shattered them beyond repair.

"Let me go," Lucas said quietly.

"I just want to punch you," Evelyn hissed.

"Evelyn, calm down. Think of the baby," Alexander interjected.

He draped a coat over her shoulders, his expression tight with concern. "What's done is done. We need to focus on Claire now."

A nurse burst through the delivery room doors. "The accident has caused complications. Natural delivery isn't possible—we need to operate immediately. Where's the father? He needs to sign."

Lucas shot Julian a bitter look.

They were divorced. He had no right to sign.

"I'll do it!" Evelyn rushed forward. "How is she?"

"The patient is conscious, but the baby's condition is unstable," the nurse explained, handing her the forms. Evelyn's hands shook as she took the pen.

Alexander pulled her close, murmuring, "Breathe. Claire's strong. I've already called in the best surgeon—he'll handle the procedure."

Evelyn exhaled shakily, some of the tension easing at his reassurance.

Alexander had acted swiftly, arranging everything the moment he arrived.

"We're low on type A blood. Is anyone a match?" the nurse asked.

Julian, silent until now, stepped forward. "I am."

"Follow me," the nurse instructed, leading him into the operating room. The doors swung shut behind them.

Lucas watched, jealousy gnawing at him. Julian would be with Claire through it all.

Meanwhile, Evelyn paced outside, her anxiety a living thing.

Claire was in there, and she could do nothing.

"Where's the driver who hit her?" she demanded, turning on Lucas.
###Chapter 543

The hospital waiting room felt like purgatory. Hours had crawled by, yet the mysterious driver remained conspicuously absent.

Alexander's gaze slid toward Lucas with silent accusation.

Lucas bristled under the scrutiny. "Why are you looking at me like that? I didn't run her over."

"Check your phone," Alexander countered. "It's Isabella."

The hallway plunged into suffocating silence.

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms as she struggled to maintain composure.

Isabella Morgan - Alexander's childhood friend - had struck Claire.

What possible motive could she have?

Evelyn studied Alexander's reaction like a hawk, knowing his response would determine whether she signed those divorce papers tomorrow.

"Are you absolutely certain?" Alexander's voice carried an edge as sharp as broken glass.

Lucas gave a single, solemn nod.

On the other end of the line, Isabella's breath hitched at Alexander's glacial tone.

The accident had left her paralyzed with shock.

It had been a simple Saturday errand - test driving a luxury sedan at Willow Mall.

Then a pregnant woman materialized in the crosswalk.

Though Isabella held a valid license, years abroad had eroded her driving skills.

Panic made her stomp the accelerator instead of the brake. The sickening thud still echoed in her bones. The salesman beside her had turned sheet-white.

The $800,000 prototype now bore bloodstains. That poor salesman would certainly lose his job.

Isabella had considered fleeing, but the terrified salesman warned that hit-and-run carried prison time. They'd called the authorities, and she'd just finished giving her statement when Alexander called.

"Alexander," she sobbed into the phone, "I'm in terrible trouble. I'm at the 12th precinct."

Alexander massaged his temples. The tremor in Isabella's voice confirmed Lucas's suspicion - she was their hit-and-run driver.

"Text me the address," he clipped. "I'll dispatch someone." The line went dead.

He caught Simon's eye with a nearly imperceptible tilt of his head.

Simon nodded once before striding toward the elevators.

Meanwhile, Evelyn perched on a plastic chair outside OR-3, counting each agonizing second.

Time had become molasses - thick, sluggish, unbearable.

Alexander and Lucas had disappeared into the stairwell for a hushed conference.

Evelyn checked her watch for the twentieth time. A cesarean shouldn't take this long. Dread coiled in her stomach like a venomous snake.

Complications meant danger. Danger meant...

The OR doors burst open. Evelyn sprang to her feet.

Julian emerged, eyes swollen and bloodshot. His ashen complexion sent Evelyn's heart into freefall.

"How's Claire?" she demanded, trying to peer around his broad shoulders.

A nurse quietly sealed the doors behind him.

"Still in surgery," Julian rasped. "She's lost... so much blood. You know how she hates pain..."
###Chapter 544

Julian collapsed onto the floor, clutching his head as waves of pain contorted his handsome features.

Evelyn felt her heart clench at the sight.

"Come sit down. You just had a blood transfusion - you shouldn't be exerting yourself," she murmured, guiding him to a nearby chair.

The elevator dinged open, revealing Simon and Isabella.

Isabella's eyes immediately darted around the waiting area. "Alexander?" she called out. The sight of her triggered Evelyn's pent-up rage from earlier that morning. Before anyone could react, Evelyn strode forward and delivered a stinging slap across Isabella's face. "If anything happens to Claire, I swear I'll make you regret ever being born!" she hissed, her entire body trembling with barely contained fury.

The impact made Isabella's head snap sideways.

A bright red handprint bloomed across her cheek as tears spilled from her eyes.

"Alexander, I never meant for this to happen," she whimpered. "I was terrified too! That car cost over a million dors and now the dealership expects me to pay for everything!"

Julian's glare could have melted steel. "What kind of excuse is that? Because you panicked, we should just let you walk away?"

It was unusual for the normally composed Julian to speak with such venom, showing just how deeply Claire's condition affected him.

Isabella grabbed at Alexander's sleeve desperately. "Alexander, please help me. I swear it was an accident."

As she tried to throw herself into his arms, Alexander smoothly stepped aside.

He positioned himself protectively near Evelyn, maintaining clear distance from Isabella.

His gaze held complex emotions as he regarded the woman he'd once considered family. "You're an adult now, Isabella. If you've made a mistake, you need to take responsibility. I can't help you with this. What you should be focusing on is how to make amends."

Isabella's tears fell faster. "What are you saying? Alexander, don't you care about me anymore?"

Evelyn saw red. She grabbed a fistful of Isabella's hair.

All Isabella cared about was manipulating Alexander into saving her.

She'd caused Claire to go into premature labor, yet showed no remorse - only concern for escaping consequences.

If this were personal, Evelyn might have controlled her temper.

But this involved Claire - her dearest friend who now lay fighting for her life.

With Claire's parents overseas and her divorce from Lucas finalized, Claire had no one but Evelyn and Julian by her side.

As her best friend, Evelyn would move heaven and earth to protect her.

"Let me make this crystal clear - there will be no leniency. You will answer for what you've done!" Evelyn tightened her grip on Isabella's hair. "First, you will apologize to Claire and beg for her forgiveness. Second, the man you're pleading with is my husband. Who do you think you are, coming here to beg him for help?"

Through her tears, Isabella protested, "Alexander and I grew up together! My brother died saving his life-"

Evelyn cut her off sharply. "Don't you dare bring that up! Your brother sacrificed himself for Alexander. Alexander owes your brother, not you."

"You're just exploiting your brother's memory to manipulate Alexander. Isabella, you're using his kindness for your own selfish ends!"

"I'm sure your brother meant the world to you, didn't he? If he could see you now - harassing his best friend and trying to destroy his marriage-"
###Chapter 545

Evelyn had never witnessed such raw fury in Isabella before.

Her crimson eyes burned with unbridled rage.

Every word Isabella spat out struck like a dagger, leaving Evelyn no room to defend herself.

Even the simplest phrases laid bare the twisted nature of Isabella’s relationship with Alexander.

Evelyn knew if she dragged Alexander into this again, she’d be weaponizing her own brother to destroy his family. She bit down on her lip until it bled, rendered utterly silent.

In Evelyn’s mind, Isabella had always seemed fragile—easy to manipulate.

She never expected this steel beneath her soft exterior, this fire that left Evelyn speechless.

She had underestimated her. Badly.

The pain in her scalp flared as Isabella yanked her hair, forcing her to bow like a sinner before a judge.

Evelyn’s pride burned, but what could she do? She had brought this upon herself.

Earlier, Simon had warned her.

He’d said if she failed to earn Claire’s forgiveness, she could face charges. Prison.

Isabella had scoffed. “Alexander won’t let that happen.”

Simon had smirked, as if he’d expected that answer.

“Mr. Whitmore has principles,” he’d said. “He won’t sacrifice others for your mistakes.”

The thought of prison sent ice through her veins. Swallowing her pride, she relented.

“Fine! I’ll apologize!” she snapped, wrenching free from Isabella’s grip. She turned toward the operating room doors and shouted, “I’m sorry!”

Isabella’s laugh was sharp. “Sorry? If apologies fixed everything, we wouldn’t need laws. When Claire wakes up, you’ll say it to her face.”

Evelyn stiffened. “I already did.”

“You think tears erase what you did?” Isabella shot back.

Desperate, Evelyn turned to Alexander, searching for mercy.

He didn’t even glance at her.

The indifference cut deeper than any blade.

They’d grown up together. He’d sent her money when she was abroad. She’d thought she meant something to him.

But now, with Isabella beside him, his loyalty was clear.

“Alexander,” she whispered, voice cracking. “Can we talk? Alone?”

His arm slid around Isabella’s shoulders. “No. You’ve hurt her enough.”

Humiliation scorched her cheeks.

Then—the operating room doors swung open.

Lucas, pale but alive, was wheeled out.

While everyone else still glared at Evelyn, his gaze locked onto the doors.

He lunged forward, gripping the nurse’s arm. “Where is she?”

The nurse held a child—but Claire was nowhere to be seen.

True Love After
###Chapter 546

"The patient remains under observation. She won't be discharged for at least another thirty minutes. While stable, she's sustained partial fractures in her lower limbs requiring extended recovery," the nurse explained. Lucas Bennett finally released the breath he'd been holding.

His attention snapped to the tiny bundle in the nurse's arms.

Claire Dawson's newborn.

"Who's the father? This preemie arrived four weeks early with aspiration pneumonia. We're transferring to NICU immediately - paternal signature required," the nurse pressed. The infant looked impossibly small.

Even with its eyes squeezed shut in sleep, the baby's resemblance to Claire was unmistakable.

Evelyn Carter exhaled in relief upon hearing Claire's condition wasn't critical.
Just fractures - painful but manageable. Thank heavens!

Then she saw the child.

Her breath hitched.

That nose. That jawline. The infant was Lucas Bennett in miniature.

Evelyn's gaze darted to Lucas. He was studying the baby with unsettling intensity, seemingly oblivious to the mirror image in swaddling blankets.

Evelyn's relief evaporated as Alexander Whitmore's eyebrows knitted together.

The financier's sharp eyes flicked between infant and friend, then narrowed in dawning comprehension.

Alexander remembered Claire's abortion claims, Lucas's insistence the child belonged to Julian Mercer. The pieces clicked into place with terrible clarity.

When the nurse requested the father's signature, Evelyn urgently nudged Julian. The model caught her meaning instantly. "I'll handle it," he declared, following the nurse down the corridor.

As they departed, the nurse murmured just loud enough for Julian and Evelyn to catch: "Is that gentleman the uncle? The resemblance is rather striking..."

Julian practically dragged the nurse around the corner.

Evelyn monitored Lucas's reaction like a hawk.

Unexpectedly, Lucas turned to Alexander. "How premature did she say?"

Evelyn's stomach dropped. The jig was up.

"Four weeks," Alexander confirmed evenly.

Evelyn watched the truth detonate behind Lucas's eyes.

In seconds, his expression transformed from confusion to shock to something dangerously close to euphoria.

Lucas seized Evelyn's shoulders. "Tell me the truth - that's my child, isn't it? Claire never terminated the pregnancy?" His voice cracked with barely restrained emotion.

Evelyn hesitated.

Claire had been adamant about raising this baby alone. She'd built an entire life around this secret.

But no contingency plan accounted for genetics this undeniable.

The nurse's premature birth comment had lit the fuse. Even if Evelyn stayed silent now, Lucas would uncover the truth within hours.

Still, loyalty kept her mute.
###Chapter 547

Since this was a matter between Lucas and Claire, Evelyn felt like an outsider who couldn't interfere too much. Most importantly, she couldn't betray Claire's trust.

"I don't know," Evelyn answered truthfully.

"How can you not know? You're Claire's closest friend!" Lucas's eyes burned with desperation. "It's my child, isn't it? Evelyn, just give me a sign!" His intensity nearly swayed her.

Alexander swiftly pulled Lucas back, positioning himself protectively before Evelyn.

"Stop pressuring her, Lucas. If we weren't friends, I'd have knocked you out already," Alexander warned, taking Evelyn's hand and drawing her close.

He continued firmly, "Evelyn is pregnant and emotionally vulnerable because of your situation. Who are you to interrogate her? If you want answers, ask Claire yourself!"

Alexander looked down at Evelyn with concern. "Are you alright?"

She gave a slight shake of her head.

"Maybe you should sit down and rest?" Alexander suggested gently.

Meanwhile, Isabella, who had been observing nearby, grew increasingly uncomfortable.

Suddenly, she gasped dramatically, clutching her forehead while her knees buckled.

Alexander frowned. "What's wrong?"

"I...I skipped breakfast," Isabella whispered weakly. "I think I'm feeling faint."

As she spoke, she attempted to collapse into Alexander's arms.

But Alexander stepped aside, his gaze turning icy as he pulled Simon forward instead.

Isabella tumbled into Simon's embrace.

Alexander remained composed. "Then let Simon take you to get something to eat."

Simon caught her reluctantly, annoyance lacing his voice. "Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Morgan had breakfast. On our way from the police station, she ate the toast I'd bought for my girlfriend after finishing my errands." The implication was clear - Simon resented Isabella for taking what wasn't hers.

Isabella shot Simon a venomous glare.

Alexander's expression darkened instantly.

The lie had been exposed.

He looked at Isabella with profound disappointment. "Isabella, what's this act about?"

It was the first time she'd seen that look from him, and she scrambled to explain. "Alexander, don't listen to him! I never touched his food!"

Simon scoffed in disbelief at her audacity.

"If you didn't eat it, Ms. Morgan, then did my toast get devoured by a stray dog?" he retorted.

Isabella's nose flushed red. "How dare you!"

"Then why so defensive if you're innocent?" Simon pressed.

"I—" she stammered helplessly.

In that moment, Alexander felt nothing but disappointment.

Connecting the dots, he realized Isabella had been manipulating situations.

Ever since her arrival, misunderstandings between him and Evelyn had multiplied.

Alexander could see this pattern would only drive Evelyn further away.

He refused to become another Ethan Caldwell, easily deceived by a woman's schemes.

Alexander recognized Isabella's twisted attachment to him - a dependency formed from childhood loss that had warped into unhealthy possessiveness.

This possessiveness made her instinctively hostile toward any woman near him, though it wasn't genuine affection.

Within minutes, Alexander reached a decision.

Taking Evelyn's hand firmly, he told Isabella, "No more games. Your tricks won't work on me anymore."
###Chapter 548

The morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the penthouse, casting long shadows across the marble floors. Alexander Whitmore stood by the window, his expression unreadable as he addressed the woman sitting across from him.

"I funded your education and ensured your comfort all these years because Andrew entrusted me with that duty." His voice was calm but firm, carrying the weight of finality. "But you're an adult now, Isabella. It's time you stood on your own."

Isabella Morgan's fingers tightened around her teacup, her knuckles turning white. She had expected many things from this conversation, but not this. Not outright rejection.

"Alexander—"

"I'll have Simon handle any matters concerning you from now on," he continued, cutting her off. His gaze flickered briefly to Evelyn, who sat quietly beside him. "This isn't just about responsibility. It's about respect—for my wife."

The words struck Isabella like a physical blow. She had always known Alexander was loyal, but hearing him prioritize Evelyn so openly left her breathless.

Evelyn, for her part, barely reacted. But beneath the table, her fingers brushed against Alexander's, a silent acknowledgment of his words. The warmth of her touch softened the hard lines of his expression, if only for a moment.

Isabella's lips pressed into a thin line. She had spent years weaving herself into Alexander's life, banking on their shared history. But now, with a single declaration, he was severing those ties.

The realization settled heavily in her chest.

She had underestimated Evelyn Carter.

And now, she was paying the price.
###Chapter 549

Lucas's unexpected arrival startled Claire and Evelyn in the hospital room.

Isabella was completely unprepared when he forced her to her knees.

Never in her life had she endured such disgrace.

Tears pooled in her eyes as she struggled to rise, but Lucas kept an iron grip on the back of her head.

Outmatched by his strength, Isabella could only bow her head in submission.

Frustrated sobs wracked her body.

Today had been nothing but misfortune - everyone seemed to be targeting her.

If only the Morgan family hadn't lost their status, she wouldn't be suffering this humiliation!

She'd been the cherished princess of her household! How dare they treat her this way?

Was it because she no longer had powerful backing?

Isabella bit her lip until it nearly bled. "Claire, I'm sorry for hitting you with my car. It wasn't intentional! You appeared so suddenly I couldn't brake in time!"

She'd already given her statement at the police station.

According to their investigation, the accident wasn't entirely her fault - Claire shared partial responsibility.

"I'll cover all your medical expenses. Just please don't press charges."

Claire hadn't realized it was Isabella who'd struck her.

After her heated argument with Lucas at the Maple Leaf Café, she'd stormed out blindly, not seeing the approaching vehicle.

Isabella had panicked behind the wheel - seeing Claire, she'd mistakenly hit the accelerator instead of the brake. That's why Claire's legs were broken. They were lucky neither she nor the baby suffered worse injuries.

Having just given birth to a beautiful girl, Claire wanted to accumulate good karma.

But before speaking, she glanced at Evelyn for guidance.

After all, Isabella's shameless behavior had caused Evelyn so much pain.

This was Claire's chance to make Isabella pay.

Evelyn gave an almost imperceptible shake of her head.

Her grievances with Isabella would be settled in due time - no need for Claire to complicate matters. Different issues required separate handling.

Besides, Alexander had publicly declared he wouldn't interfere with Isabella's affairs, which reassured Evelyn.

Yet he hadn't abandoned her completely. If Evelyn made a scene now, she'd only lose his respect.

Their years of friendship allowed Claire to immediately understand Evelyn's silent message.

"Pay all medical bills for me and my daughter," she said coldly, "plus compensation for emotional distress. Every penny, no exceptions."

The total sum would likely give Isabella sleepless nights.

Added together, it amounted to a staggering figure.

Isabella nodded eagerly in agreement.

Claire continued, "Now get up. There's no need for such dramatic begging."

But Isabella remained kneeling.

Only when Lucas finally released her did she rise.

Tear tracks stained her cheeks as she turned to leave, not even brushing the dust from her dress.

Alexander, waiting in the corridor, immediately noticed Isabella's tear-streaked face and bruised knees.

He instantly understood she'd been humiliated inside.

"Alexander, I'm fine," Isabella forced a trembling smile. "If kneeling helped Evelyn vent her anger, it was worth it."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Evelyn made you kneel?"
###Chapter 550

Isabella gave a vague response. "Regardless, I made a mistake and should apologize properly. They only demanded compensation and won't pursue legal action." Alexander's frown deepened. "Tell me honestly—did Evelyn force you to kneel?"

Isabella froze, shocked he'd uncovered the truth.

After previous consequences, she dared not lie this time. "No, it was Lucas."

Alexander's expression turned icy. "Then why blame Evelyn?"

Isabella had no reply.

Rubbing his temples in frustration, Alexander ordered, "Simon, escort her back."

Simon stepped forward immediately. "Ms. Morgan, I'll drive you home."

Biting her lip, Isabella cast one last longing glance at Alexander.

He ignored her completely, his gaze fixed on the hospital room door.

XXXXX 2/4

Inside the private suite, Lucas stared at Claire with tear-filled eyes.

"Claire, if she's my daughter, why did you claim you'd terminated the pregnancy? I'm her father, yet you hid her existence and planned to have her call another man Daddy."

The thought alone crushed Lucas.

For years, he'd believed his indecisiveness drove Claire to abort their child, creating an irreparable rift between them. The imagined loss had devastated him, leading to years of self-punishment and desperate attempts to win her back.

Now he discovered the truth—their child lived.

Did this mean Claire's relationship with Julian was just an act?

Could there still be hope for them?

Evelyn sat quietly on the sofa, meticulously peeling an apple.

Noticing this, Claire immediately said, "I want an apple too."

"You just delivered. No cold fruits."

Evelyn blinked curiously. "Speaking of which, did you arrange postnatal care? Should we call your helpers?"

"I hired two maternity nurses." Claire reached for her phone. "I'll summon them."

Their casual conversation completely excluded Lucas.

Simon pulled up to the orchestra's entrance, and Isabella exited the vehicle.

As she turned to leave, he suddenly said, "Ms. Morgan, while you did eat the croissant I bought for my girlfriend, I'm not unreasonable. Please wire me the twenty-five dollars. Thank you." He lowered the driver's window, fixing her with an expectant look.

Isabella gaped.

Demanding twenty-five dollars? How petty could he be?

Glaring furiously, Isabella snapped, "A man like you actually has a girlfriend? I hope she dumps you immediately!"

Simon smirked. "When you had food poisoning, I stayed overnight at the hospital. Countless chauffeur services—all forgotten? Ms. Morgan, how cruel to wish my relationship ruined."

Isabella retorted, "You're Mr. Whitmore's executive assistant. Solving his problems is literally your job—he pays you generously. Serving me falls under those duties. What's your point?"

Simon countered, "My contract specifies assisting Mr. Whitmore—not buying you pastries. All this deflection... are you trying to skip out on your debt?"

###Chapter 551

Simon waved his phone dismissively. "It's just toast, but I have boundaries. What if my girlfriend thinks I'm being too friendly with another woman?" His relationship had started over those very sandwiches.

Fate worked in mysterious ways. That evening after work, starving and exhausted, Simon had stumbled into a tiny café for a quick bite. There, he'd literally bumped into the campus queen herself.

Being alumni, exchanging numbers felt natural. Two months of relentless pursuit later, she'd finally agreed to be his girlfriend.

No way was he sharing their special toast tradition with anyone else. That was sacred.

Isabella remained oblivious to this sentiment.

After enduring a humiliating day at the hospital, the last thing she expected was Simon nickel-and-diming her over twenty dors.

The absolute audacity!

Too drained to argue, she transferred the money and stormed off.

Her heels clicked angrily against the pavement as she reached a deserted alleyway. A loose pebble bore the brunt of her frustration.

How had everything gone so wrong?

Alexander had made his position painfully clear - no more protection. The realization brought hot tears to her eyes.

The evening breeze carried memories of another lifetime.

At sixteen, when most girls worried about prom dresses, Isabella had watched her world collapse. The Morgans fell from grace overnight, leaving only Andrew by her side.

Poverty transformed her from privileged heiress to unwanted burden. Distant relatives took them in reluctantly, demanding backbreaking farm labor in return.

Andrew, barely fourteen, shielded her from the worst. His pianist hands became calloused and scarred within months. Then one fateful day, he left with Alexander and never returned.

The whispers started immediately - kidnapped by drug cartel operatives lurking in the hills.

Those endless days of terror still haunted her. Police reports painted increasingly grim pictures of torture techniques. Each update shattered her further.

She'd prayed until her knees bruised, but heaven remained deaf.

The final blow came when only Alexander emerged from the military vehicle. The cartel's cruel game - only one could live. Andrew chose Alexander.

No body was ever recovered. Just bloodstained clothes in a mockery of a coffin. The DNA confirmed the worst.

Alexander became her lifeline during the subsequent darkness. Now even that was gone.
###Chapter 552

Simon waved his phone dismissively. "It's nothing major, but I have boundaries to maintain. What if my girlfriend gets the wrong idea when she finds out I bought cat toast for another woman?" His relationship had blossomed over a shared love of toast.

It was destiny. That evening, after wrapping up work with an empty stomach, Simon had stopped at a humble toast stand. There, by pure chance, he'd encountered the campus queen.

Being alumni, exchanging contacts came naturally. Two months of relentless pursuit later, she'd finally agreed to be his girlfriend.

He couldn't risk compromising their special toast tradition now.

Isabella remained oblivious to this significance.

After enduring a humiliating day at the hospital, the last thing she expected was Simon nickel-and-diming her over twenty dors.

The absolute nerve!

Too exhausted to argue, Isabella transferred the money and stormed off.

She found herself in a deserted alleyway, kicking pebbles with frustration.

How had everything gone so wrong?

Alexander had made his position painfully clear - their childhood bond meant nothing now. The realization brought hot tears to Isabella's eyes.

The evening breeze carried memories of her shattered past.

At sixteen, when most girls worried about prom dresses, Isabella had watched her world collapse. The Morgan family's downfall left her with only Andrew.

Penniless, they'd begged distant relatives for shelter.

From privileged heiress to charity case overnight - the humiliation still burned.

Their reluctant hosts put them to work in the fields.

Andrew, barely fourteen with pianist's hands, shouldered most of the labor. Those delicate fingers grew calloused and scarred within months.

Then came the day Andrew left with Alexander and never returned.

The villagers whispered about kidnappers - ruthless drug cartel members who enjoyed torturing hostages.

Each passing day brought fresh horrors. Police reports described psychological torment, physical abuse. Isabella stopped eating, praying endlessly for Andrew's safe return.

But fate dealt its cruelest blow. The cartel's twisted game: only one could survive. Andrew chose Alexander.

Isabella's last hope died when Alexander returned alone in that police car.

No body. No closure. Just bloodstained clothes for a makeshift grave.

The cartel had stolen even her right to mourn properly.

For years, depression consumed her - until Alexander reappeared, offering the lifeline she'd desperately needed.
###Chapter 553

Isabella's breath hitched as the memory of that fateful auction night flashed through her mind.

The alley seemed to shrink around her when she recognized the sleek Rolls-Royce blocking her path.

Dominic Powell. Here. Now.

Her pulse pounded like a trapped bird against her ribs.

The one-way alley offered no escape except past that ominous vehicle.

As she approached reluctantly, the car door slid open with a whisper of luxury leather.

Dominic's sharp gaze immediately zeroed in on the fading red mark marring her cheek.

"Who dared lay hands on you?" His voice carried dangerous undertones.

Isabella blinked in surprise. Since when did Dominic care about her wellbeing?

Then realization dawned - she was still technically his fiancée. That bracelet on her wrist proved it.

Hitting her was akin to slapping Dominic Powell's pride.

"Vanessa Hart," she admitted quietly.

Dominic's eyes darkened to stormy depths. "Is that so?"

A shiver ran down Isabella's spine at his tone. "I never expected her to be so... bold."

Tears pricked at her eyes, though she couldn't decipher Dominic's expression.

She had more pressing concerns than reading his moods. "If we're done here, I should go."

"Did I say you could leave?" Dominic's voice turned glacial. "Turn around."

The command froze her in place.

When she pivoted, she found Dominic studying the mark on her cheek with unsettling intensity, his chin propped on one hand.

"Such delicate little hands," he murmured.

Isabella gaped.

Was this madman actually admiring the handprint Vanessa left?

Only Dominic Powell would find beauty in violence.

Despite his eccentricities, she couldn't deny the warmth spreading through her chest.

Here he was, seeking her out after she'd been wronged, finding twisted ways to comfort her.

Perhaps there was method to his madness after all.

Beneath his piercing stare, she gathered her courage. "Satisfied? Your fiancée was assaulted. Will you just stand by?"

One dark brow arched. "And?"

"If you truly care for me, help me make Vanessa pay."

Dominic's lips curled into something between a smile and a sneer. "Care for you? Seek vengeance?"

Isabella pressed on, playing her cards carefully. "I may have considered breaking our engagement... but if you protect me now, I'd reconsider."

The lie slipped easily from her lips.

Marry Dominic Powell? Never. No amount of handsome features could compensate for his mercurial nature.

But desperate times called for empty promises.

Dominic's sudden laugh sent chills down her spine. His icy amusement was more terrifying than anger.

"Tell me, darling," he purred, "how exactly should I punish this Vanessa?"

Isabella's confidence grew. Clearly, he wanted to impress her.

She needed to maintain her image - not appear too vindictive.

Dominic's smirk turned predatory. "That's all?"
###Chapter 554

Dominic suspected Isabella was plotting something sinister. Had she suggested harming Evelyn directly, his dagger would have been drawn in an instant.

Yet this cowardly woman still expected his assistance.

She had her own twisted logic.

Evelyn was nothing like her.

Pregnant women were vulnerable. A single snakebite could terminate her pregnancy.

Isabella, still traumatized by her own encounter with snakes, was convinced Evelyn would react hysterically.

Dominic's voice dripped with mockery. "Don't waste my time with petty schemes. Handle it yourself."

His face remained shadowed. "If you want my involvement, make it worth my while."

Isabella froze. A chill ran down her spine—something in his tone suggested darker intentions.

Her voice trembled. "Worth your while? What exactly do you mean?"

Noticing her unease, Dominic smirked. "You'll need to cooperate fully."

She instinctively stepped closer.

When he whispered his plan, her eyes widened in horror. "You...you can't possibly—"

Dominic gave her a leisurely once-over. "This is for your benefit. Refuse, and the deal's off."

Her mind raced. Then, abruptly, she grinned.

"Fine! I accept!"

As she walked away, Dominic watched her retreating figure with cold calculation.

He flicked his cigarette aside. "What makes shallow women like her think I'd ever want marriage? Or her?"

Confidence was attractive. Delusion was pathetic.

Nathaniel, listening from the driver's seat, had heard every word of Dominic's scheme.

Dusk settled as Evelyn kept vigil at Claire's hospital bedside.

Lucas felt invisible. No matter how he pleaded, Claire refused to acknowledge him.

He needed confirmation—proof the child was his. But she gave him nothing.

His shoulders slumped. Then Julian entered the room.

The dancer's step faltered upon seeing Lucas.

Julian approached Claire's bed gently. "The nurses took the baby for neonatal care. The doctor said treatment will take about a week. If all goes well, she can leave with you."

Claire nodded. "Thank you. You should go home and change."

Julian's white shirt still bore dried bloodstains from that morning, now darkened with time.

"I packed extra clothes in the hospital bag. I'm staying to care for you."

As he retrieved fresh clothing, he smiled at Claire. "How could I leave you here alone?"

Lucas's temper flared.

He seized Julian's collar. "Enough acting! I know that baby is mine!"

This charade between Claire and Julian had gone on long enough.

Lucas snarled, "How much is she paying you? I'll double it. Get out!"

Their eyes locked—Lucas's bloodshot with rage, Julian's calm despite being manhandled.

This was between Lucas and Claire. No interlopers allowed.

Julian remained composed. "Mr. Bennett, need I remind you? You and Claire are divorced. Strangers. You have no authority here."

Lucas's lips curled. "That child's blood says otherwise."
###Chapter 555

The room fell into complete silence for several heartbeats.

Julian studied Claire's pale face before declaring with conviction, "I'm the father of this child."

His words ignited a fire in Lucas, who swung his fist without warning. The punch connected with Julian's nose, sending crimson droplets splattering across the hospital floor.

"Who gave you the right to claim my daughter?" Lucas snarled.

Seeing the blood, Claire's temper flared. "Lucas! Have you lost your mind? Get out of my hospital room this instant!"

Julian pressed a hand to his throbbing nose, wincing in pain. Evelyn quickly produced tissues and offered them. "Julian, should I call a doctor?"

He shook his head, stuffing the tissues against his nostrils. "It's nothing serious." Then he turned to Lucas with narrowed eyes. "Leave. Claire just had major surgery. If you upset her and her stitches rupture, I'll make sure you regret it."

Julian was perhaps the only person whose orders Lucas would never follow. Yet the truth in his words couldn't be ignored.

Fresh from childbirth and a car accident, Claire couldn't afford emotional distress.

"Rest well, Claire," Lucas muttered before exiting, planning to return when she'd regained strength.

Within minutes, a nurse entered to administer an IV. "That handsome man has been pacing the hallway all afternoon," she remarked while adjusting the drip. "Family?"

Claire glimpsed through the door crack and saw Alexander still waiting for Evelyn outside.

"You should go home," Claire told Evelyn. "You're pregnant too. At least my baby's safely delivered now."

Evelyn hesitated until Julian assured her, "I'll take care of everything. The household staff are already on their way."

With Evelyn gone, only Julian remained with Claire in the sterile room.

"Hungry?" He gently smoothed her blanket edges.

Claire gave a slight headshake, studying Julian's disheveled appearance. "Clean yourself up," she murmured.

He obeyed without protest.

Returning fifteen minutes later, his dark hair damp, water droplets trailed down his sharp jawline onto his freshly changed white shirt. Claire's eyes were closed, so Julian moved like a shadow - silent steps, controlled breathing.

Standing vigil at her bedside, his mind flashed to the roadside scene - Claire's bloodied form, the paralyzing terror that had gripped him. Never before had he experienced such soul-crushing helplessness.

Thankfully, both mother and child had survived.

His gaze dropped to her IV-pierced hand. The delicate skin showed faint bruising from the cold fluids. Without thinking, Julian captured her chilled fingers between his warm palms, attempting to heat the invading liquid through sheer willpower.

He remained statue-still, watching over her with an intensity that would have unsettled anyone awake.

Much later, when Julian had finally dozed off against the bed rail, Claire's eyes fluttered open. Memories of the operating room flooded back - the agonizing transition from natural labor to emergency C-section, the paralyzing fear when they'd rushed her to surgery.

The cold steel table. The blinding lights. Her body shaking uncontrollably as medical jargon swirled around her.

Then Julian had burst in, still in his bloodstained shirt. He'd taken her trembling hand and whispered words that anchored her: "I'm right here. You're not alone."
###Chapter 556

Tears shimmered in Claire's eyes.

For the first time, she didn't feel abandoned.

She lay motionless on the operating table, the anesthesia dulling her senses, yet acutely aware of Julian beside her—his blood flowing into her veins, into her daughter's tiny body.

In that moment, he felt like Bella's real father.

A warmth spread through her chest, unfamiliar yet comforting. This man, who had no obligation to them, was giving everything.

The drugs made speech impossible, but when Julian leaned close after the transfusion, his whisper brushed her ear like a promise. "Now she carries part of me too." His fingers traced her cheek. "Claire... let me be there for both of you. Always."

She couldn't respond.

But watching him slump into the chair beside her bed, exhaustion claiming him, something shifted inside her. Maybe second chances weren't just for other people.

Julian stirred when her fingers twitched.

He bolted upright, immediately checking her IV line. "Did I hurt you?" His hand retreated from hers as if burned. "I just—your skin was cold, so I..."

"Julian." His name left her lips with deliberate weight.

He froze. That tone—he'd never heard it before.

"What is it?"

Her throat worked around the words. "Would it bother you... if Bella came with us? On our first date."

The world tilted. Julian's breath hitched. He stared, unblinking, as if she'd spoken in riddles. "Say that again."

His voice cracked. Hope, raw and terrifying, widened his eyes.

Had he dreamed it? The beeping monitors assured him this was real, yet—

"Look at me." He cradled her face, searching. "Once more. Please."

Claire turned her palm up, threading her fingers through his.

Moonlight silvered their joined hands when she whispered, "I choose you."

Outside, the hospital gardens lay bathed in cool light. Evelyn let Alexander steer her toward the parking lot, his arm a solid weight across her shoulders.

"Still angry, darling?"

A half-shrug. Then a reluctant nod.

He pulled her against his chest, lips grazing her temple. "I was blind. Simon handles Rachel's matters now—you won't hear her name from me again."

Evelyn tilted her head up. "Tell me about Andrew. How he saved you."

Alexander's grip tightened.

When he spoke, the words dragged from some dark place. "Drug runners. Police raid drove them into our village." A muscle jumped in his jaw. "Andrew and I were gathering firewood. They took us at gunpoint."

The past clung to him like shadows. Evelyn shuddered—not from the night air, but the image of her husband as a bound child in some filthy hideout.

Alexander's next words came hollow. "They slit Andrew's throat when the ransom was late."

Evelyn's gasp shattered the stillness.

His arms locked around her, holding them both upright as decades-old grief poured out in ragged confession. "I lived because he died begging them—'Take me instead.'"

The admission hung between them, heavier than the moon above.

Evelyn pressed her face into his collar, breathing in the scent of his pain. No wonder Rachel's ghost had lingered so long.

Some debts could never be repaid.

###Chapter 557

The images of drug lords from news reports flashed through Evelyn's mind—their ruthless methods, their cold-blooded brutality. A shiver ran down her spine.

"Andrew and I lived through hell during that time."

Alexander's gaze drifted toward the distant horizon, his voice hollow. "After we were rescued, I swore I'd bring them down myself. That's why I joined the police academy."

The cartel members had been far more vicious than he ever imagined. Back then, he and Andrew were just kids, no threat to their operations.

Yet, if any of them were in a bad mood, they'd beat them senseless. Only when Alexander and Andrew were on the verge of death would they toss them a sip of water.

Andrew had fought back once. In retaliation, they slashed his cheek with a blade, the wound so deep it exposed raw flesh. The scar stretched across the bridge of his nose, blood pooling beneath him.

They knew exactly how to inflict agony. They poured chili water over Andrew's open wounds, his screams echoing in the dark.

His fiery temper had cost him dearly.

Those two weeks were a waking nightmare for Alexander. Every second, he plotted their escape.

Finally, after ten days, he saw his chance.

When the cartel members were drunk and careless, Alexander used a jagged rock to saw through the ropes binding them. He and Andrew were ready to run.

But Andrew, consumed by rage, refused to leave without revenge. He snatched a dagger from one of the unconscious men and plunged it into the abdomen of the one who had scarred him.

The man's howl of pain woke the others.

They didn't make it far.

The beating that followed was worse than anything before. Alexander lay broken on the ground, every breath agony, as if he'd been crushed beneath a truck. Andrew fared no better.

The cartel lost patience. They demanded to know who had planned the escape.

Neither spoke.

Then came the cruelest game of all.

"Such loyalty," one of them sneered. "Fine. Let's play."

They blindfolded Alexander and Andrew and threw them into a pitch-black room.

Only one of them would leave alive.

Starved, wounded, and delirious, they lost track of time. The darkness stretched endlessly, hunger and pain distorting their senses.

After four days, a dagger clattered onto the floor between them.

"Kill the other, and you walk free."

By then, they were barely clinging to life. The cartel locked the door and left.

It was a test of humanity, a plunge into despair.

They stared at each other. Neither reached for the blade.

Then Alexander, weakened by fever and blood loss, collapsed into unconsciousness.

When he woke, the dagger was in his hand.

The floor was slick with blood.

"Impressive," a voice mocked. "You actually did it."

The words struck like a hammer to his chest.

Alexander recoiled, dropping the knife. No. It wasn't possible.

He would never hurt Andrew.

So why couldn't he remember what happened before he blacked out?
###Chapter 558

"Where is Andrew? Where is he? Hand him over!"

"He's dead. His body was disposed of. We don't keep trash here."

The drug lord's voice dripped with contempt, as if discussing nothing more than discarded waste.

"No. That can't be..." Alexander clutched his head, his fingers digging into his scalp. Andrew couldn't be dead. It wasn't possible.

But when he squeezed his eyes shut, fractured memories flickered through his mind. He heard Andrew's voice, hoarse but firm: "Promise me you'll look after my sister."

Why did that memory feel incomplete? What had happened?

He couldn't recall how Andrew had died.

Despair coiled around him like a noose. The psychological conditioning had been too strong—when he closed his eyes, he saw himself driving a blade into Andrew's chest. Had he really done it?

Alexander's breath came in ragged gasps.

Guilt and horror crashed over him in waves.

He refused to believe he had taken Andrew's life, but if he hadn't—then where was Andrew?

The drug lords had lied. After Andrew's supposed death, they hadn't released Alexander. Instead, they kept him locked in that suffocating, windowless room.

They were monsters, unpredictable and cruel. Why had he ever trusted them?

Days blurred together until hunger gnawed at his bones. Then—chaos erupted outside.

Shouts. Running footsteps. The police had found their hideout.

The drug lords scrambled to escape, forgetting about Alexander until it was too late.

He became a bargaining chip. A gun pressed against his skull as they dragged him to the rooftop, using him as a shield.

"Let us go, or I pull the trigger!"

The drug lord's voice was frantic, his grip unsteady.

But negotiations didn't last long.

A single gunshot split the air.

The man behind Alexander crumpled.

A perfect headshot.

Warm blood splattered across Alexander's neck. The body hit the ground with a sickening thud.

Alexander dropped to his knees, trembling.

For months afterward, the sight of any liquid—even water—made him retch.

After his rescue, Alexander wasn't sent home immediately. The police needed his statement.

He had been with the cartel for weeks. They needed every detail.

It was then that Alexander learned the truth.

The police had only captured a fraction of the operation. The real leader had escaped.

The officer assigned to him—a kind man in his thirties—let him shower, gave him fresh clothes, and handed him a steaming cup of instant noodles.

When Alexander remained catatonic, they brought in a therapist.

Three days passed before he spoke.

He told them everything—the twisted game, the ultimatum that only one of them could live.

"The search dogs picked up Andrew's scent," the officer said gently, sensing Alexander's torment.

"They also found his blood on one of the cartel's knives. The dagger left in the room wasn't the murder weapon."

Alexander's breath hitched.

"It wasn't you," the officer said firmly. "They lied."
###Chapter 559

At last, Alexander exhaled deeply, the weight on his shoulders lifting slightly.

Yet the guilt remained, gnawing at him. Andrew had died while they were together.

"Are you certain Andrew is dead? Where is his body?"

Alexander clung to a fragile hope.

The officer responded professionally, "I can't disclose too much about the case. All I can say is his body hasn't been recovered yet."

Noticing his distress, the officer gave his shoulder a reassuring pat. "Don't dwell on it. This chapter is closed for you. The rest is our job. Come on, I'll take you home."

In the car, Alexander overheard the officers discussing the police academy.

Right then, he made a decision. He would enroll, become an officer, and bring criminals to justice. Over the next decade, he trained rigorously and completed every mission assigned to him. It was exhausting, but fulfilling.

Only a year ago had Nathan brought him back into the Whitmore family.

After hearing Alexander's story, Evelyn embraced him, her heart aching for him.

She felt his body tremble. Reliving the past clearly tormented him.

Evelyn began to understand why he treated Isabella with such care.

He still questioned whether Andrew was truly dead.

Alexander couldn't shake the possibility that he might have been the one who ended Andrew's life.

The guilt consumed him, splitting his mind into two voices—one constantly accusing him of murder. His kindness toward Isabella was merely his guilt transferred.

Suddenly, Evelyn asked, "Do you think Andrew might still be alive?"

Despite the blood at the scene, something felt off.

A person couldn’t just vanish after Alexander lost consciousness. Besides the blood, there was no concrete evidence proving Andrew’s death.

Evelyn pressed further, "Where’s his body? Weren’t the drug lords arrested? Didn’t they confess?"

Alexander shook his head. "Only the low-level operatives were caught. The real leader escaped. Those left behind were disposable."

In such criminal organizations, information was tightly controlled. The lower ranks knew nothing.

Evelyn realized that if Andrew had been buried in some remote place, finding him would be nearly impossible.

Years had passed since the kidnapping. His remains would be nothing but bones by now.

As they left the hospital, Lucas suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

Alexander slammed on the brakes just in time.

He rolled down the window, scowling. "What the hell are you doing?"

If the car had been moving faster, Lucas’ recklessness could have caused a crash.

Lucas’ eyes were bloodshot, his shirt soaked. A half-empty liquor bottle dangled from his fingers.

Clearly, after Claire had rejected him, he’d drowned his sorrows at a nearby convenience store.

The moment the car stopped, Lucas staggered to the passenger side and banged on the window.

"Evelyn, you and Claire are close. Tell me, how do I win her back?"

His voice cracked. "She had my child. She must still love me, right? Why else would she keep the baby?"
###Chapter 560

Evelyn sighed deeply, her voice laced with exhaustion. "She had the baby not out of love for you, but for the child itself. Claire wants to protect her daughter from becoming a pawn in your twisted games. Alexander, she's made up her mind to walk away."

Lucas shook his head violently, his breath reeking of alcohol. "That's impossible. After all we've shared, all these years together... Now with our baby... She wouldn't just leave."

He stumbled toward the hospital entrance, his movements unsteady.

Evelyn sprang from the car, intercepting him. It was too late at night for this nonsense. Claire needed rest, and Lucas was clearly intoxicated.

She shot Alexander a pleading look. "Take your friend home and keep him there. Make sure he doesn't disturb Claire again."

What new mother had energy to deal with a drunken ex-husband's melodrama?

Alexander roughly shoved Lucas into his car's backseat, glaring at him. He'd finally reconciled with Evelyn and planned a quiet evening together before she returned to her studies. Their time together had become precious lately.

But of course Lucas had to show up tonight.

Still, Lucas was his oldest friend. Alexander couldn't abandon him here, not in this state. The idiot might get himself killed wandering the streets drunk.

After dropping Evelyn safely home, Alexander watched until she disappeared inside before driving off with his troublesome passenger.

Lucas clambered into the front seat, clutching his head miserably. "Don't take me home. Let's go to Eclipse Lounge. I need another drink."

Alexander shot him an exasperated look. "You need sleep, not more alcohol. If you keep this up, even I'll start hating you, let alone Claire."

Lucas groaned. "You don't understand this pain. She nearly died giving birth to my child! And what was I doing? Nothing! Meanwhile Julian got to stand by her side in the delivery room!"

The agony in his voice was palpable. His own child, and he'd been the last to know. Claire had shut him out completely, leaving him drowning in guilt and regret.

"Today of all days, when they reunited," Lucas continued bitterly. "In Claire's eyes, Julian must seem like some damn hero now. And me? Just the worthless ex who lost his chance. I should've been there holding her hand! Julian stole that from me!"

His fists clenched. "And today she actually cursed at me to protect him! That pretentious bastard is just using her for her money. I swear I'll make him pay!"

Alexander listened silently, recognizing this as his friend's desperate need to vent. He interjected occasionally, "Even without Julian, there'd be someone else. You're divorced, Lucas. Maybe it's time to move on."

"Move on?" Lucas laughed harshly. "Did you see me bothering her these past months? But now she's given birth - almost died doing it - and you expect me to pretend our child doesn't exist? That's my blood!"

Alexander pulled the car over, exhaling deeply. The situation was undeniably complicated.
###Chapter 561

The storm between them appeared to have passed, yet Claire had given birth to Lucas's child. Just when it seemed their connection might endure, the divorce papers had been signed.

Little Bella became the invisible tether binding Claire and Lucas together. Though Lucas projected an air of carefree indifference, beneath the surface lay a man burdened with responsibility.

Claire had just endured childbirth. Combined with the guilt that had been gnawing at him for months, Lucas would undoubtedly seek redemption.

As for their daughter? The moment the Bennett family discovered her existence, they'd move heaven and earth to claim her.

Lucas spotted the neon glow of Eclipse Lounge and practically leapt from the car, Alexander struggling to keep pace with his long strides.

Noting his friend's distress, Alexander ordered them both drinks. But Lucas could see Alexander's attention was elsewhere.

Physically present, mentally absent - Alexander's thoughts had clearly flown back to Evelyn.

Waving a dismissive hand, Lucas muttered, "Go home to your wife. I need to be alone tonight."

Truthfully, Alexander was itching to return to Evelyn. After their long separation, today's brief reunion felt painfully inadequate.

Yet abandoning his friend in this state seemed unconscionable.

"I'm staying," Alexander declared firmly.

Lucas snorted. "Unless you've grown breasts overnight, your company holds little appeal."

Snatching up his cocktail, Lucas beckoned Maxwell Wood over, whispering instructions. Within minutes, the manager returned with a parade of barely-clad women.

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Have you lost your damn mind?"

"We're divorced," Lucas slurred, alcohol blurring his judgment. "She's moved on. Why shouldn't I?"

When Alexander tried dismissing the women, Lucas stopped him. "You've got someone waiting. I don't. Let them stay."

The disappointment in Alexander's gaze could have frozen lava. The approaching women hesitated, sensing the tension.

Eventually they clustered around Lucas, who reclined against the leather booth accepting drinks with a smile that didn't reach his eyes.

He produced a thick wad of bills, slapping it onto the table. "Make me forget her tonight, and this is yours."

One particularly observant woman purred, "Heartbreak, Mr. Bennett? Nothing heals old wounds like new... companionship." Lucas turned sharply.

The resemblance was uncanny - especially in profile. As she raised a glass to his lips, Lucas's vision blurred. "Claire?" he murmured, reaching for her.

Seizing her opportunity, the woman practically vibrated with excitement. "Would you like private service tonight, Mr. Bennett?" She elbowed her competition aside, pressing against him. "There's a VIP suite upstairs..."

Lucas lit a cigarette, inhaling deeply. The cloying, cheap perfume assaulting his nostrils was nothing like Claire's subtle vanilla scent. His interest evaporated instantly.

"Calling her Claire?" Alexander's voice cut through the haze. "That's beyond disrespectful." He raised his phone. "911? I'd like to report solicitation at Eclipse Lounge—"

Before he could finish, the room erupted into chaos as women scrambled for the exit.

Maxwell rushed in, sweating profusely. "Mr. Whitmore, what possible offense could we—"

The sudden silence was deafening. Lucas stared into his drink, the ice cubes melting like his resolve.
###Chapter 562

A golden halo illuminated Alexander from behind. He met Maxwell's gaze steadily. "You've done nothing wrong. I simply need Lucas to spend some time at the police station to cool off." Alexander couldn't risk leaving his volatile friend unsupervised.

The bar environment would only fuel Lucas's agitation.

The police station was the perfect solution - it provided both restraint and space for reflection.

Maxwell sighed internally. "Why must I get dragged into your lovers' quarrel?"

Within minutes, uniformed officers arrived and escorted a protesting Lucas away.

Having interned at the precinct, Alexander knew this would likely result in a five-day holding period.

Five days should be sufficient for Lucas to regain his composure.

"You scheming bastard!" Lucas shouted over his shoulder as they led him out.

He'd thought Alexander was joking about calling the authorities.

"This is ridiculous! I didn't even hire anyone - just had two damn drinks!"

Dawn was breaking when Alexander finally exited Eclipse Lounge.

Evelyn still slept peacefully when he returned to their penthouse.

After a quick shower, he slipped into bed and pulled her close.

Despite his careful movements, Evelyn stirred immediately. The scent of alcohol clung to him.

"You've been drinking?"

"Just a couple with Lucas."

"Is he alright?"

Alexander nodded. "He's somewhere safe now."

Noticing his exhaustion, Evelyn didn't press further.

Once his breathing deepened into sleep, she quietly left the bedroom.

The past forty-eight hours felt like an eternity.

Her restless night had been plagued by nightmares - a monstrous serpent pursuing her relentlessly through endless corridors.

Waking left her more exhausted than if she'd actually run all night.

After breakfast, Evelyn visited Willow Mall's baby boutique to shop for Claire's upcoming delivery.

Stepping outside, she froze.

A sleek black sedan idled at the curb - unmistakably Dominic's.

This time, Evelyn approached without hesitation.

She slid into the passenger seat and immediately assessed his condition.

"Any changes in sensation this week?" She'd prescribed treatment nearly seven days ago.

Dominic's expression remained unreadable. "Some temperature sensitivity."

Evelyn jotted adjustments to his herbal soak. Then she tested his knee reflex.

"Feel that?"

"A dull pressure."

She retrieved her acupuncture kit from the car's console. "Lie back for treatment."

Dominic didn't comply. Instead, he propped his chin on one hand. "Why should I?"

His challenging gaze held hers as the tension between them crackled like static.
###Chapter 563

Evelyn sighed as she packed her medical supplies. "You don't have to listen to me," she said, her voice laced with frustration. "Unless you prefer staying in that wheelchair forever."

Dominic's lips curved into a mocking smile as their eyes met.

"Standing or sitting makes no difference to me," he drawled, stretching his legs lazily.

From the beginning, it had been Evelyn's idea to treat his paralysis. But Dominic couldn't care less about walking again - his entire existence felt meaningless anyway.

Evelyn frowned at his nonchalance. "Are you serious? You'd rather be confined to a wheelchair your whole life?"

"Tell me something first," Dominic countered, tilting his head. "Why are you so determined to fix me?"

The question hung heavily between them. Evelyn busied herself with her medical bag, avoiding his piercing gaze.

"Fine. If you refuse treatment, I'm leaving." She reached for the door handle, only to hear the locks click shut. Nathaniel had obeyed Dominic's silent command.

"Did I say you could go?" Dominic reclined his seat, folding his arms behind his head in clear invitation.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. The man was infuriating - why couldn't he just cooperate like a normal patient?

Her attention shifted to the bloodstained bandage peeking from beneath his shirt. With careful fingers, she peeled back the fabric and gasped. The dressing she'd applied a week ago remained unchanged, now fused to his flesh with dried blood.

"You're lucky you haven't gotten an infection," she muttered, working to separate the fabric from skin. Each tug drew fresh beads of blood, yet Dominic showed no reaction beyond mild amusement.

"Nathaniel," Evelyn called to the driver, "we need to get him to a hospital immediately. This wound requires stitches."

Dominic chuckled darkly. "My dear Evelyn, why the sudden concern?"

She ignored his teasing, focusing on the gruesome injury. After weeks of forced proximity, she'd begun deciphering Dominic's twisted psyche.

He moved through life like a bored predator, toying with those around him for entertainment. The fear he inspired in others seemed to be the only thing that made him feel alive.

Yet Evelyn couldn't comprehend why this dangerous man showed her such... tolerance.

As she worked, Dominic watched her through half-lidded eyes, his expression unreadable. The car's interior grew heavy with unspoken questions, the air between them charged with something neither dared name.
###Chapter 564

Dominic remained silent as Evelyn finished bandaging his shoulder wound. With practiced hands, she began the acupuncture treatment on his legs.

Her movements were precise and gentle. Dominic relaxed into the leather seat, surrendering to her skilled ministrations.

An hour later, the session concluded.

Beads of sweat dotted Evelyn's forehead from the intense concentration required.

"When's the next session?" Dominic inquired.

"Not too soon. At least three days between treatments."

His brow furrowed. "Three days? That means I won't see you until then?"

Propping his chin on one hand, Dominic clearly disliked this arrangement. "Surely I need treatment tomorrow?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Our relationship isn't exactly the type that requires daily meetings, is it?"

A slow, knowing smile spread across Dominic's face. "Daily meetings? Now there's an interesting suggestion."

Evelyn found herself momentarily speechless.

"Speaking of which," Dominic continued, "did Isabella cause you any trouble?"

"None worth mentioning," Evelyn replied.

"If she does, just say the word. I'll take care of her."

Evelyn tilted her head curiously. "Isn't Isabella your fiancée?"

Dominic's eyebrows shot up. "Why? Jealous that I'm engaged?"

An uncomfortable silence fell.

Evelyn's expression stiffened. Why would she be jealous? More importantly, why was Dominic siding with her over his own fiancée?

Just then, Alexander's call interrupted them.

Having woken to find Evelyn absent, he was checking on her whereabouts.

Evelyn instinctively glanced at Dominic before answering, "I just picked up some baby supplies. Taking them to Claire now."

"Alright. I'll meet you at the hospital later."

She'd never intended to stay with Dominic long anyway.

Hanging up, she opened the car door. "Get that shoulder stitched properly. I'm leaving."

Dominic's gaze darkened as he watched her retreating figure.

Only when Evelyn was out of sight did Dominic run his tongue along his teeth in frustration.

"She answers Alexander's call in front of me? Makes plans right here? Impressive."

His irritation flared visibly.

Nathaniel, seated in the driver's position, felt an involuntary shiver at the sudden chill emanating from behind him.

Dominic pulled out his phone and dialed.

"Dress up. I'm picking you up in an hour," he commanded.

Isabella sounded confused. "Why?"

"Just do it," Dominic snapped before ending the call.

Biting her lip, Isabella stood before her mirror, applying makeup and selecting a daring cocktail dress.

If Dominic wanted a date, why the secrecy? After yesterday's humiliation, a night out might lift her spirits anyway.

She had no real interest in Dominic, but as a Powell heir, he was worth stringing along for amusement.

When she emerged, Dominic's car waited as promised.

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at Eclipse Lounge.

Isabella exited first, expecting Dominic to follow.

Instead, his phone rang. "Go ahead inside. I'll join you shortly."

Assuming he'd follow after his call, Isabella entered alone.

The club pulsed with neon lights and deafening bass. Cigarette smoke hung thick in the air.

Dressed to impress in her revealing outfit, Isabella immediately drew male attention in the male-dominated space. Several men approached within moments.
###Chapter 565

Isabella Morgan had assumed that since Dominic Powell brought her here, those men wouldn't dare to cause trouble.

But Dominic never showed up. She sat alone at the bar, already two drinks in, growing increasingly uneasy.

Even if Dominic had stayed in the car to make a call, thirty minutes had passed. He should've returned by now. "Dominic, where are you?"

She moved to a quieter corner and dialed his number.

"I'm leaving."

"Leaving? You dragged me here just to abandon me?" Isabella couldn't believe it. She felt utterly played. "Dominic, are you messing with me?"

She expected at least some excuse, some half-hearted explanation. Instead, Dominic just laughed. "Yeah. How'd you guess?"

His mocking tone made her blood run cold.

Remembering his ruthless methods, she bit back her anger. Provoking him risked a repeat of last time's humiliation.

After hanging up, she slammed her phone down and ordered two more shots.

She downed them in quick succession.

Nearby, Vincent White watched her with predatory interest.

Seeing her alone, he slid onto the stool beside her.

"Sweetheart, why drink alone? Let me get you another."

Isabella glanced at his cheap watch - barely worth ten grand - and sneered. "Get lost. You can't afford me."

Her fiery attitude only intrigued him more. "No need to be rude. Just being friendly."

Already irritated and now tipsy, Isabella snapped.

When Vincent tried to touch her arm, she grabbed her half-finished cocktail and threw it in his face.

Liquor dripped from his chin onto his crisp white shirt.

His expression darkened. No one humiliated Vincent White.

He grabbed her throat and yanked her close. "You bitch! Do you know whose club this is?"

The sharp slap across her face sobered her instantly.

She glared at him, struggling. "Let go! Do you know who I'm connected to?"

"I don't give a damn!" Vincent started dragging her toward the VIP section.

One of his lackeys chuckled. "Consider it an honor to entertain Mr. White."

Now she understood why no staff intervened. This was Vincent's domain - the infamous Eclipse Lounge.

Fear prickled her skin as she cursed Dominic's betrayal. Bringing her here only to abandon her.

Vincent hauled her toward an upstairs private room.

Her stomach dropped. At least downstairs had witnesses. Behind closed doors...

"Stop! I'm Alexander Whitmore's woman!"

The name carried weight in Cresthaven. Most men would back off immediately.

Vincent knew Alexander, but scoffed. "Nice try, sweetheart." He tightened his grip. "Keep lying and I'll gag that pretty mouth."

The door clicked shut behind them.

Isabella's heart pounded as she made a break for the ensuite bathroom, locking herself in.

Fingers trembling, she dialed Alexander.

The phone rang. And rang.

No answer.

Vincent started pounding on the door. "Open up, princess!"

She redialed desperately. He'd have tools to break in soon.

The knocking grew louder.

Alexander had to pick up. He just had to.
###Chapter 566

Evelyn spent the morning chatting with Claire at the hospital, bringing along the baby clothes she'd purchased earlier from the maternity boutique.

"Have you decided on a name yet?"

Claire looked remarkably better than yesterday, her eyes sparkling with renewed energy. The overnight rest had brought color back to her cheeks.

"I'm naming her Bella. Bella Bennett."

Evelyn smiled. "That's an absolutely charming name."

Since Claire could eat solid food post-surgery, Julian had prepared homemade soup for her.

Claire suddenly grasped Evelyn's hand, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Julian and I... we're together now."

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock. "Seriously?"

Remembering how Julian had rushed into the operating room yesterday to donate blood, Evelyn hesitated. "Is this genuine affection, or just gratitude?"

Claire bit her lip. "A bit of both, I think."

It wasn't surprising. They'd shared a home for nearly eight months. Julian made breakfast every morning, warmed milk for her at night—his thoughtfulness had slowly melted her heart.

"Whatever it is, I support you." Evelyn squeezed Claire's hand firmly. "But Lucas already knows Bella is his daughter. He won't give up easily. Have you thought about how to handle this?"

Claire shook her head. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. We're already divorced. Who I date now is none of his business."

Their conversation paused as Julian entered with a steaming lunchbox.

Evelyn discreetly excused herself, closing the door softly behind her. Outside, Alexander stood waiting in the corridor. He immediately took her hand.

"Hungry? Let's get you something to eat."

Evelyn checked her phone—it was already past 3 PM.

"Honestly, you two talk forever. Have you forgotten you're carrying a baby?"

Alexander produced a cupcake from his pocket. "Bought this from the hospital café. Eat something before my child starves."

Evelyn accepted it, elbowing him playfully. "Who says it's a boy? What if it's a girl?"

"Just a guess. A daughter would be even better." Alexander's gaze dropped to her barely visible bump. At nearly four months, her pregnancy wasn't showing.

"Should we get you checked? Are you eating enough?"

"Next appointment isn't due yet." Evelyn took a bite. "The doctor said some women don't show early. It's normal."

Alexander remained silent as he led her to the car, driving to a nearby restaurant.

During the ride, Evelyn noticed his phone buzzing incessantly. "Aren't you going to answer that?"

"Not important." His tone was dismissive.

Evelyn thought nothing of it until they arrived. After ordering, Alexander excused himself to the restroom.

That's when the text came through:

[Alexander, I'm trapped by thugs at Eclipse Lounge. Will you let them humiliate me?]

His expression darkened instantly. He called Isabella back immediately.

The line connected to hysterical sobs and loud banging. "What's happening?"

"Please, Alexander! They're breaking in—"

"Where are you?"

"VIP room 3 at Eclipse—"

A deafening crash interrupted her as the door splintered open. Isabella's scream pierced through before the phone clattered to the floor.

"Did you really think you could hide from me?"

The smug voice of Vincent White made Alexander's blood run cold. More scuffling followed, then Isabella's terrified wails.

He hung up and bolted.

Evelyn frowned as Alexander sprinted past their table.

"Our food hasn't even arrived! Where are you going?"

He didn't look back.
###Chapter 567
Evelyn sat quietly at the table, waiting. When Alexander didn't return after several minutes, she picked up her fork.

The spread before her was exquisite, and her stomach growled in protest. She couldn't let it go to waste.

She dialed Alexander's number. No answer.

Only one person could make Alexander abandon her mid-meal—Isabella.

Yet Evelyn felt an unexpected calm settle over her.

Perhaps uncovering the truth about Andrew's death had reshaped her perspective on Alexander and Isabella's relationship.

Or maybe she'd braced herself for this moment long ago, numbing the sting.

Evelyn trusted Alexander wouldn't betray her. There had to be a valid reason for his sudden departure.

As his wife, she owed him the benefit of the doubt.

She'd wait for his return and a proper explanation.

The meal ended too soon, with Alexander still absent. Evelyn settled the bill and stepped into the cooling evening air.

As she debated returning to the theater, a sleek black sedan pulled up beside her.

"Standing me up?"

Dominic's smirk carried a dangerous edge. "Night's young. How about keeping me company instead?"

Evelyn's brows knitted. How did Dominic know she'd been with Alexander?

"No, thank you," she said firmly.

Dominic's gaze burned into her retreating figure. "First woman to refuse me," he murmured. "Makes you even more irresistible."

Nathaniel, his driver, exchanged a glance through the rearview mirror.

Bold move, Mr. Powell. Stealing Alexander Whitmore's woman takes guts.

Alexander burst into the private booth to find Isabella pinned beneath Vincent, her dress torn at the shoulders.

Isabella's hair fanned across the floor as she fought to cover herself. Angry red marks marred her cheeks and collarbones.

"You'll regret this!" she sobbed. "The Morgans will have your head!"

Vincent laughed cruelly. "Your family's been irrelevant for decades. Who'd avenge you?"

His belt clattered to the floor. Isabella went deathly pale.

The weight difference made escape impossible.

Just as Vincent leaned in, the door exploded inward.

"Alexander!" Isabella cried.

Alexander's fist connected with Vincent's jaw before the man could react. Teeth shattered. Blood sprayed.

Isabella scrambled up, collapsing against Alexander. "A few more minutes and he would've—"

Her entire body trembled violently. Tears soaked Alexander's shirt as she clung to him.

Alexander peeled her off and took in her ruined dress. He shrugged out of his jacket and tossed it to her. "Cover yourself."

Only then did Isabella realize how much skin she'd exposed.

Wrapped in Alexander's scent, she pointed at Vincent. "That monster tried to rape me! Don't let him get away!"

Vincent groaned on the floor, struggling to rise after Alexander's devastating punch.

Alexander turned to Isabella. "Why are you alone here?"

Newly returned to the city, she shouldn't know about places like Eclipse Lounge.

"Dominic brought me!"

"Dominic?"

Isabella nodded. "He got a call and left me here."

Alexander's eyes darkened. Isabella's breath hitched—she recognized that lethal calm.

Something was very wrong.
###Chapter 568

"Impossible. Did Dominic arrange this? Why would he go this far?"

Isabella couldn't believe it. But when she pieced everything together, the timing was too perfect to be coincidence.

She stomped her foot in frustration. "I told you Dominic's a monster! I can't marry him! Alexander, you have to help me call off this engagement!"

Alexander studied Vincent's expression. "Are you working for Dominic?"

Vincent shook his head vehemently. "Dominic? I don't even know the man!"

Alexander wasn't interested in explanations. Just then, a squad of police officers entered the establishment.

"Save your excuses for them. This place is operating illegally and will be shut down immediately."

Vincent paled. He hadn't anticipated Alexander would alert the authorities en route.

The bar represented his life's work. Faced with law enforcement, his bravado crumbled.

"Mr. Whitmore, have mercy! Arrest me if you must, but don't close my bar!"

Since no real harm had come to Isabella, Vincent would likely serve minimal jail time at worst.

But the bar was different. Once shuttered, reopening would be nearly impossible.

Alexander didn't even glance at him as he escorted Isabella outside.

Standing beneath the neon lights, Alexander lit a cigarette. "I'll give you Simon's number."

Isabella froze. "Alexander, are you really abandoning me?"

In the emergency, Alexander had been nearby. The ten-minute response time beat the police arrival.

Rushed and distracted, he hadn't even informed Evelyn. The guilt already gnawed at him.

Alexander exhaled smoke. "I won't risk Evelyn misunderstanding. I can't leave her waiting."

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes. "What about my engagement? You promised to help me end it!"

"I'll handle what Simon can't. I'll speak with the Powells about terminating the arrangement soon. Come on, I'll take you home."

Isabella bit her lip. "I can't face the theater. That disgusting man touched me. I feel filthy. Everyone will gossip if they see me like this. I need to wash up first."

**

Evelyn watched Alexander escort Isabella into the hotel lobby.

They collected a room key from reception. Isabella gazed up at Alexander with pleading eyes.

"Alexander, could you... take me upstairs?"

Alexander's suit jacket still draped her shoulders. Her red-rimmed eyes gave her a pitiful, rabbit-like appearance.

Evelyn stood paralyzed, her feet leaden. Through the glass doors, she witnessed the scene unfold, unable to move.

An invisible hand seemed to squeeze her heart, the discomfort stealing her breath.

Dominic wheeled closer, his smirk taunting. "Surprised? Alexander's betrayed you."

Evelyn's fists clenched unconsciously. Meeting Dominic's mockery, she turned with icy composure.

"Isabella's your fiancée. You seem remarkably pleased by this development."

Dominic shrugged. "I maintain excellent perspective."

Evelyn's gaze hardened. "Is it perspective, or careful planning? Dominic, you're despicable."

The coincidences stacked too neatly. Evelyn had just parted from Alexander when Dominic appeared outside the restaurant.

Once might be chance. Multiple encounters reeked of calculation.

Connecting the dots, Evelyn knew Dominic had orchestrated Alexander's abrupt departure.

She met Dominic's gaze squarely. "Your manipulations are transparent. Did you truly think I'd fall for this?"

Dominic's eyes narrowed, unruffled by exposure.

He seized Evelyn's wrist, pulling her close until his breath ghosted across her lips.

"You always knew I played dirty. What? Having second thoughts about fixing these legs now?"

His grip tightened. "In prison, you told me to live well. Changed your mind? Would you prefer this scourge removed permanently?"
###Chapter 569

Without warning, Dominic seized Evelyn's wrist and pressed a cold steel blade into her palm.

"Here's your chance. End me now."

Evelyn gasped, her breath catching in her throat. The sudden weight of the dagger shocked her system. The metallic scent of dried blood clung to its surface, telling stories of past violence.

"This has taken lives," she realized with horror.

Her fingers recoiled as if burned, sending the weapon clattering to the floor.

Dominic caught it mid-air with practiced ease. He twirled the blade between his fingers with disturbing familiarity. "Too frightened? Shall I demonstrate how it's done?"

Before she could react, he dragged the sharp edge across his own palm.

Crimson droplets splattered against his dark trousers, spreading in ominous stains. Dominic leaned back in his wheelchair, watching the blood flow with detached amusement, applying more pressure as if testing his own pain threshold.

Evelyn stood frozen, words failing her.

She lunged forward, wresting the dagger from his grasp, and hurled it into the nearest trash bin outside the hotel entrance. "Nathaniel," she commanded sharply, "take Mr. Powell away immediately!"

She couldn't bear to witness his self-destructive spectacle any longer. When Nathaniel wheeled Dominic away without protest, Evelyn finally exhaled the breath she'd been holding.

As she turned toward the hotel lobby, movement caught her eye. Alexander stood near the elevators, gesturing to security. "Please escort my guest upstairs," he instructed.

Isabella's plea to be accompanied was met with refusal. The rejection drained all color from her face. "Alexander, you won't even walk me up?"

Before he could respond, Evelyn entered the scene. Alexander opened his mouth to explain, but Evelyn pressed a finger to his lips. "No explanations needed," she murmured with a soft smile. "I trust you completely."

Their fingers intertwined naturally as she turned to assess Isabella's condition. The woman's tear-streaked makeup and torn dress spoke volumes about her recent ordeal. Evelyn thought grimly, "Dominic shows no mercy, even to his own fiancée."

Compassion softened Evelyn's voice. "Would you like me to go upstairs with you?"

Isabella blinked as if struck. "What did you just say?"

Evelyn repeated gently, "I asked if you'd like company. What's your clothing size? I can fetch you something fresh."

Disbelief flickered across Isabella's features. Nearly fifteen seconds passed before she managed a stiff, "No."

Respecting the clear boundary, Evelyn watched the elevator doors close before leaving with Alexander. His grip tightened around her hand. "You're not upset?"

"At first, I was hurt when you left me. But she's Andrew's sister, alone and vulnerable now. My heart aches for her." Evelyn didn't want Alexander caught in emotional crossfire.

They entered a boutique where Evelyn selected a complete outfit, arranging for delivery to Isabella's room. Outside, Alexander suddenly pulled her into an embrace. "Mrs. Whitmore," he murmured against her hair, "your kindness humbles me."

His lips found hers in a sudden, passionate kiss that left Evelyn breathless. She flushed scarlet, glancing around at passing pedestrians. "Alexander! We're in public!"

His answering smile held both apology and promise.
###Chapter 570

"Legally speaking, we're husband and wife now. Kissing isn't exactly a crime."

Alexander's fingers brushed against Evelyn's cheek as he tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. His other hand tilted her chin upward.

His dark eyes held hers captive beneath the flickering streetlamp.

The deserted midnight street became their private sanctuary as they embraced. Pressed against Alexander's chest, Evelyn felt heat radiating through her entire body.

Their breaths mingled in the cool night air before Alexander claimed her lips in a searing kiss that left her trembling. Her fingers clutched at his crisp white shirt, leaving telltale wrinkles in the pristine fabric.

At Whitmore Manor, Nathaniel wheeled Dominic back to his private quarters.

"Sir, I'll draw your bath immediately."

Nathaniel recognized the storm brewing behind Dominic's stony expression. He prepared the bath with meticulous care, adding therapeutic herbs to the steaming water.

Blood dripped unnoticed from Dominic's clenched fist into the water. He sat motionless in the tub, letting the shower cascade over his face like a man seeking purification. The dagger wound on his palm gaped open, staining the porcelain crimson.

"Mr. Powell, your hand—" Nathaniel gasped when he returned.

Dominic didn't respond. His eyes remained closed, lashes casting shadows on his pale cheeks.

"Leave me."

Nathaniel's throat tightened as he bandaged the deep gash, then checked the bullet wound on Dominic's shoulder. When he helped his employer from the bath, they were met with an unwelcome visitor.

"Sir... Mr. Reginald Powell is here," Nathaniel murmured.

Dominic's eyes snapped open, glinting with bitter amusement. "Which poor soul requires elimination this time?"

Reginald's calculating gaze dropped to Dominic's legs.

The wheelchair could be an elaborate ruse—or perhaps his son's injuries were genuine. Either way, it didn't concern him.

"The Walkers are challenging our claim to the eastern district property," Reginald stated, brushing imaginary lint from his sleeve.

Dominic's expression remained impassive. "Noted."

Dawn found Evelyn returning to the theater. As she stepped from Alexander's car, she spotted Isabella settling her taxi fare.

Their eyes met briefly before Isabella hurried through the gates without acknowledgment.

Evelyn tilted her head, studying Isabella's outfit with interest. "That actually suits her surprisingly well."

The edgy ensemble Evelyn had chosen contrasted sharply with Isabella's usual pastel wardrobe. Yet the bold lines accentuated her figure better than any frilly dress ever had.

Alexander laced his fingers through Evelyn's, indifferent to fashion critiques.

"Don't forget to eat properly while you're working. And remember—" He brought her knuckles to his lips. "Your husband expects your full attention when you return."

Evelyn's breath caught at the possessive glint in his eyes.
###Chapter 571

After saying farewell to Alexander, Evelyn made her way back to her dormitory.

She dropped her bag carelessly on the bed before grabbing her violin case. The music room beckoned.

As she stepped into the hallway, an unexpected figure blocked her path.

Cassandra Brown stood with her arms crossed, a smirk playing on her lips. Her cold eyes raked over Evelyn with undisguised contempt.

"Well, well," Cassandra drawled. "I saw that fancy car drop you off earlier. Figures you'd need connections to worm your way into this orchestra. How else could someone like you get Leonard Herty as a mentor?"

Evelyn brushed past without a word, pushing open the music room door.

But Cassandra wasn't finished. She followed close behind, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

With a mocking laugh, Cassandra continued, "Don't think that pretty face will keep you here forever, Evelyn. This isn't some beauty pageant - we value actual talent, not whatever tricks you used to seduce your way in."

The truth was, Evelyn had shown remarkable improvement in just days.

Beyond regular rehearsals, Leonard had been giving her private lessons daily.

Even during group sessions, instructors couldn't stop praising her natural affinity for the violin.

Word had spread quickly about Leonard taking on a protégé. Orchestra members from other sections came to glimpse the much-talked-about newcomer.

Evelyn found herself constantly watched. Yet she remained composed, as if the attention meant nothing.

To Cassandra, this calm was infuriating.

"She's loving every second of this," Cassandra thought bitterly. "She's just playing hard to get to make them more curious."

Before Evelyn's arrival, Cassandra had been the undisputed star. Every major solo had been hers.

Now whispers suggested Cassandra's reign might be ending. The thought made her blood boil.

She was the principal cellist! This newcomer meant nothing.

Yet beneath her anger, unease grew. In mere weeks, Evelyn had earned undeniable praise. The future suddenly seemed uncertain.

Cassandra raised her voice, ensuring everyone heard.

"Someone like you joining us is an insult! So tell us, which sugar daddy bought your way in? Don't be shy - share with the class!"

A crowd gathered instantly. Cassandra's accusation sent shockwaves through them.

"Could it be true?" someone whispered.

"I did see a man drop her off in a rare sports car this morning," another added.

"God, she acts so humble but there's clearly more to her."

The whispers swelled, fingers pointing at Evelyn.

Just then, Isabella Morgan walked by with her violin.

She'd changed from the stylish outfit Evelyn bought her last night back into her usual dress.

Seeing Evelyn cornered, Isabella frowned and shot Cassandra a withering look.

As she passed Evelyn, Isabella muttered, "Pathetic. Letting trash like that walk all over you? Alexander would be ashamed."

Then Isabella turned her full attention to Cassandra.

"You're the principal cellist, correct?" Her voice cut like ice. "With all your experience, you don't recognize Alexander Whitmore? The man who dropped her off is her husband - CEO of Titan Capital Group."

The revelation struck like lightning. The crowd gasped collectively, eyes widening in shock.

Even those outside business circles knew Alexander Whitmore's name.

That Evelyn was married to one of the nation's most powerful men seemed impossible.

Cassandra stared at Evelyn, her face frozen in stunned disbelief.
###Chapter 572

Evelyn had assumed Cassandra was merely fortunate to study under Leonard. But discovering Cassandra's ties to Titan Capital Group made the reality far more difficult to swallow.

"If Cassandra truly is the CEO's wife, why keep it secret?" she pondered.

Evelyn's finger trembled as she pointed. "You...you're married?"

Cassandra's icy stare swept over Evelyn. "Weren't you just accusing me of being someone's mistress and leveraging connections? Don't retreat now. Why the shaking hands?" With deliberate slowness, Cassandra reached out and patted Evelyn's shoulder.

"Next time you want to slander someone, at least verify your facts. And before gossiping about others, perhaps examine your own reflection. Didn't you notice your recent nose job is slightly crooked?"

Evelyn's face drained of color. Her hand flew to her nose.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. "So her nose isn't real? I thought something looked off."

Another voice added, "We're orchestra colleagues. Isn't it shameful for Evelyn to spread such rumors? Cassandra is Titan Capital's CEO's wife - why would she need to be anyone's mistress?"

Evelyn's cheeks burned. She wished the floor would swallow her whole.

Worst of all, she could feel dozens of eyes scrutinizing her nose.

Her attempt to humiliate Cassandra had spectacularly backfired. Now she was the laughingstock.

The whispers grew wilder. Some speculated she'd had full facial reconstruction.

She'd only touched her nose!

Evelyn teetered on the edge of hysteria.

Miranda Price and Eleanor Shearer, Evelyn's usual allies, grew nervous. If Evelyn turned her fury on them later, they'd pay dearly. They hurried to diffuse the situation.

"Enough everyone! Don't you have rehearsals? What if Vice President Green catches you loitering?"

The warning worked. The crowd gradually dispersed.

Evelyn wasn't just any member - her father was the orchestra's vice president. While gossip was tempting, most knew better than to cross certain lines.

When the hallway finally cleared, only Evelyn, Miranda, and Eleanor remained.

Recalling Cassandra's public humiliation, Evelyn trembled with rage.

Never had she endured such disgrace. Her pride lay in tatters.

Eleanor attempted consolation. "Evelyn, don't let her get to you. She's new here. You're principal cellist. She could never surpass you."

Miranda nodded vigorously. "Exactly. With her current skill level, she barely qualifies as an ensemble member." Evelyn's expression softened slightly at their reassurances.

In her mind, Cassandra's position as Leonard's student could only stem from sheer luck.

Evelyn had dedicated her life to music since childhood, yet still hadn't earned Leonard's tutelage.

She'd researched Cassandra's background thoroughly. No prestigious music academies. No formal training.

"It makes perfect sense," Evelyn thought. "If Cassandra is Titan Capital's CEO's wife, of course Leonard would take her on. It's all Alexander Whitmore's influence. Certainly not talent."

A cruel smirk twisted Evelyn's lips as she formulated her plan.

"Spread the word," she instructed Miranda and Eleanor. "Tell everyone Cassandra only became Mr. Herty's student by pressuring him through her position as Alexander's wife. She's nothing but a connection-climber."

Leonard was the orchestra's cornerstone. If this rumor spread, many would revolt against the idea of him being coerced.

Orchestra members prided themselves on merit and integrity. If they believed Cassandra had entered through such means, she'd drown in their contempt.

Miranda and Eleanor exchanged uneasy glances. "Evelyn...isn't that going too far? Didn't Mr. Herty himself say he begged Cassandra to study with him?" Eleanor hesitated.

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "Mr. Herty only said that to save Alexander's face. Do you truly believe he'd debase himself to beg anyone? She dared challenge me publicly. I'll ensure Cassandra doesn't last in this orchestra!"
###Chapter 573

Evelyn had no clue she'd deeply offended Cassandra.

What shocked her more was Isabella stepping in to defend her earlier.

Isabella had never shown any fondness for her before.

"Could it be because of that dress I sent her last night?" Evelyn wondered. "Did that small gesture really change her opinion of me?"

During the orchestra's rehearsal, the conductor announced an upcoming performance scheduled in a month.

This prestigious event, held every three years, required selecting a soloist from the cello section.

Traditionally, this honor automatically went to the principal cellist, with others providing accompaniment.

But this year, the rules changed dramatically. The soloist would be chosen through an internal competition involving all orchestra members.

The winner would represent the orchestra in a grueling 48-hour composition challenge, testing not just musical skill but creative versatility.

Evelyn didn't consider participating at first, being new and inexperienced in composition.

When Leonard heard about the competition, his gaze turned stern. "You're seriously not entering?" Evelyn shook her head.

"You're my protégé. If my own student won't even compete, people will say I can't produce worthy successors."

Evelyn paused, considering his words. "Professor Herty has a point."

His reputation was impeccable. If she, his student, lacked the courage to enter an internal competition, wouldn't that reflect poorly on him?

Embarrassing herself was one thing, but tarnishing Leonard's name was unacceptable.

Still, Evelyn remained realistic about her abilities.

"But my skills aren't at that level yet. Wouldn't it be worse if I entered and got eliminated immediately?"

Leonard frowned. "Who said you're not good enough? There's still a month until selections. With my personal coaching, you think you can't surpass the others?"

Evelyn realized then how fiercely competitive Leonard was. Of course - anyone who reached his legendary status had to be.

He continued, "Unless you don't want to improve, a month with me is worth five years of regular lessons!"

Evelyn nodded. A month of private instruction from Leonard was an opportunity too precious to refuse.

"But what if I actually win? The orchestra would send me to the composition competition afterward," she pointed out.

For the internal selection, she'd only need to perfect one piece through repetition.

But composing was different - you couldn't fake inspiration. Without experience, she might struggle to produce even a simple score in 48 hours.

"Don't worry about that," Leonard assured. "I'll guide you through every step. Inspiration strikes unexpectedly - some create masterpieces in mere minutes."

His confidence was absolute. Leonard didn't see her concerns as obstacles at all.

Not wanting to dampen his enthusiasm, Evelyn agreed to try.

To accelerate her progress, Leonard arranged for Evelyn to skip all group rehearsals, focusing solely on their daily one-on-one sessions.

With Evelyn practicing diligently under Leonard's expert guidance, the days passed swiftly.

One afternoon, Evelyn took time off to collect Claire and her newborn from the hospital.

As she waited, a breaking news report flashed across the hospital television.

The Whitmore Manor had burned to the ground the previous night.

The Whitmores were Cresthaven's premier real estate dynasty, responsible for developing one-fifth of the city's properties.

For such an affluent family, their manor boasted a cutting-edge fire suppression system designed to activate at the slightest threat.

Yet the entire estate had been consumed by flames - an inexplicably eerie catastrophe.

Julian went to complete Claire's discharge paperwork while Evelyn and Claire waited by the hospital bed, both deeply unsettled by the disturbing news...
###Chapter 574

"That's impossible. The news reported the Bennett Estate's fire suppression system failed, but their family built their fortune on construction. How could they make such an amateur error?"

"Even though the Bennett family escaped unharmed, the property damage must be catastrophic. This will undoubtedly raise doubts about their construction standards." "Could this be corporate sabotage? But that's too extreme! If the firefighters hadn't arrived when they did, the entire family could've perished."

As they debated, Julian burst into the room, his face pale with panic.

"We have a problem! Sophia is gone!"

"What?" Claire shot upright despite her injuries. "Explain!"

"I just completed the discharge paperwork and went to collect Sophia. But the nurse said someone claiming to be her father took her hours ago. They presented a birth certificate, so the nurse released her!"

Claire's expression turned glacial.

Her mind raced. "It has to be Lucas. He must have secretly obtained Sophia's birth documents and used them to kidnap her!"

Claire's hands trembled. Lucas had been conspicuously absent these past few days, making her believe he might have moved on.

She never anticipated he'd resort to stealing their daughter right from the hospital.

Claire immediately grabbed her phone and dialed Lucas's number.

No answer.

Tears burned her eyes. She'd barely held Sophia since the birth. One fleeting glimpse before they whisked the baby to NICU. Now Lucas had vanished with her without explanation.

"That's my child, my flesh and blood! I nearly died bringing her into this world!" she whispered fiercely.

Evelyn recognized Claire's escalating distress and moved to calm her.

"Claire, you must stay calm. Your fractures haven't healed. Lucas wouldn't harm Sophia. She's his daughter too."

"He took her for DNA testing!" Claire bit her lip until it bled, her voice shaking with fury.

She feared once the results confirmed paternity, Lucas would have legal grounds to keep Sophia permanently.

"We're divorced," Claire spat bitterly. "I endured this pregnancy alone. Why can't he just let me go?"

Julian couldn't bear Claire's anguish. "I'll find him! I'll bring Sophia back!"

"Julian, stop!" Claire commanded sharply. "The Bennett family isn't some ordinary household. Charging in there would be suicide."

Lucas commanded vast resources while Julian was just a medical student. Storming the Bennett estate would get him arrested at best.

Claire inhaled deeply, forcing composure.

"Evelyn's right. Sophia is Lucas's child too. He won't hurt her. This is just another manipulation tactic. We'll wait. Let him show his hand first."

Evelyn and Julian helped Claire return home.

Claire barely touched her lunch, and Evelyn understood - a mother's heart remains with her child. Retrieving her phone, Evelyn called Alexander. Alexander was reviewing contracts when his phone vibrated. Seeing Evelyn's name, he answered instantly. "Evelyn?" "Alexander, what's Lucas playing at? Why would he take Sophia without warning?"

Alexander's stunned silence confirmed his ignorance of the situation.
###Chapter 575

Evelyn's voice was icy. "You told me you'd already spoken to him that day! Now he's taken Bella and won't even answer Claire's calls!"

Alexander could hear the fury in her tone. "Let me handle this," he responded quickly.

Claire suddenly burst into tears, her sobs raw and unrestrained. Evelyn's heart twisted at the sound, and she ended the call abruptly, turning to comfort her distraught friend. Alexander felt a pang of guilt—Evelyn's anger wasn't just directed at Lucas, but at him too.

He dialed Lucas’s number, but to his surprise, the call went unanswered.

Just then, Simon walked in with a stack of documents. "The fire at the Walker estate has sent their stocks crashing." The blaze had been the talk of the city all morning. Titan Capital Group had a long-standing partnership with the Walkers, and only days ago, Alexander had met with them to discuss business.

During their meeting, they had been adamant about securing the eastern suburbs' land.

Simon added casually, "The Walkers have withdrawn from the bidding. Now, the Powells are in the lead."

But Alexander barely registered the update. His mind was still on Evelyn’s call.

Unable to reach Lucas by phone, he grabbed his coat and headed straight to Willowbrook Apartments.

The security recognized him immediately and let him through without question.

As soon as he stepped inside, the sound of a baby’s cries filled the air.

Alexander frowned. That idiot actually took the child.

Hearing the commotion, Lucas emerged from the bedroom. He looked disheveled, his white shirt stained with something yellow, his hair unkempt. "Alexander? What are you doing here?" He descended the stairs, his expression darkening as if remembering something unpleasant.

"You had me locked up for five days!" Lucas snapped. "Do you have any idea what that was like?"

The cell had been freezing and pitch-black. Lucas still hadn’t forgiven Alexander for that.

Alexander took a seat on the couch as a servant handed him a drink.

He leveled Lucas with a cold stare. "Those five days were supposed to sober you up. Clearly, they didn’t work. You’re still as reckless as ever."

Lucas stiffened. "What did I do wrong?"

"You took Bella from the hospital without a word! Do you realize how much this will make Claire despise you? She nearly died giving birth to that child. What gives you the right to just take her?" Alexander’s sharp words left Lucas momentarily speechless.

After a long pause, Lucas muttered, "I just wanted Claire to come to me."

Alexander pressed further. "And what if she doesn’t?"

Lucas froze, then snapped, "She will. The baby is here with me—she’ll have no choice!"

"So you admit it?" Alexander’s voice was cutting. "You’re using Bella as leverage to manipulate her."

The accusation stung. Lucas recoiled. "She’s my daughter! I would never use her like that!"

"But you are," Alexander said flatly. "And all you’re doing is pushing Claire further away. That’s all I have to say. Think about it."

With that, he stood and walked out without another word.

Upstairs, Bella’s cries grew louder as the maid tried to soothe her.

Lucas had been released from custody that morning and gone straight to the hospital to take her.

He believed Bella was the only thing that could bind him and Claire together—an unbreakable link. If he had her, Claire would have no choice but to come to him. Then, he could regain control.

His plan was simple: demand Julian leave Claire’s home. Once he was gone, Lucas was certain he could rekindle their relationship.

But instead of Claire, it was Alexander who had shown up.

Lucas clenched his fists. She should’ve been discharged by now. Why hasn’t she come?

Does she really hate me that much?
###Chapter 576

Evelyn spent considerable time soothing Claire's distress.

"I refuse to go to him," Claire declared, her tone unyielding. "Let's see how long his pride lasts!"

Evelyn nodded in agreement. "Focus on healing your legs. Rest is crucial. Alexander just informed me he heard Bella crying loudly—she's perfectly healthy. No need for concern."

For now, whoever broke first would lose the upper hand. Lucas had taken the baby solely to pressure Claire into submission.

Before returning to her orchestra, Evelyn left Julian with strict instructions to care for Claire.

But as she reached the entrance, Nathaniel intercepted her.

His eyes were bloodshot, his voice trembling. "Ms. Carter, please! You must help Mr. Powell! He's barely clinging to life!"

Evelyn froze. "Dominic? What's happened to him now?"

The memory of that disastrous night resurfaced—Dominic manipulating events to sabotage her relationship with Alexander, using Isabella as his pawn. The heated confrontation outside the hotel remained vivid in her mind.

That night, he'd even drawn a dagger and dared her to stab him.

Evelyn couldn't fathom what could reduce Nathaniel, a composed man, to such desperation.

Acting on instinct—or perhaps lingering guilt—she followed him through a discreet entrance into Powell Manor.

They moved silently, avoiding detection.

But the moment Evelyn stepped into the room, her breath caught.

The metallic tang of blood hung thick in the air. Dominic lay motionless on the bed, eyes shut tight.

His lips were parched, his body trembling violently beneath a thick blanket. He looked worse than when he'd been shot in the shoulder. Evelyn's frown deepened. "Why isn't he at a hospital?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "Mr. Powell forbade it!"

"What irrational vendetta does this man have against medical care?" she wondered.

Medical supplies were already arranged nearby. Evelyn approached and lifted the blanket.

The fabric beneath was saturated with blood.

Peeling back Dominic's shirt, she gasped.

A clean, deep gash marred his abdomen—two centimeters deep, the length of a finger.

The wound's edges were crusted with dried blood, fresh crimson still seeping through. It was at least a day old.

The sheets beneath him were stained beyond recognition, layer upon layer of rust-colored betrayal.

Evelyn worked swiftly to stem the bleeding, but the wound gaped too widely—she could only slow it.

Dominic burned with fever, unconscious. Without proper care, infection was inevitable.

"Why does he always end up like this?" she thought bitterly.

After assessing the injury, she confirmed it was superficial—no organ damage.

If it was merely surface-level, she could attempt sutures herself.

"Needle and thread?"

"Yes! Here!" Nathaniel rummaged through the kit and handed them over. "Ms. Carter, are you truly stitching him yourself?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "He belongs in a hospital, but your stubborn master refuses. If I do this here, he'll have a hideous scar."

Nathaniel hesitated. Dominic was notoriously vain—a permanent mark might devastate him.

A weak cough startled them both.

Dominic's eyes fluttered open.
###Chapter 577

Dominic's eyes were glassy, his face flushed with fever.

His voice came out hoarse. "Go on, stitch me up. Let's see how terrible your sewing skills are."

Evelyn remained silent.

The bed was too low for her pregnant form. Rather than straining, she simply knelt on the floor.

Years ago, when medical resources were scarce, her mentor Jonathan had performed emergency sutures in dire situations. Evelyn had assisted him on several occasions.

This was her first time doing it alone. Her fingers trembled slightly with nerves. Thankfully, Dominic lay perfectly still, like a mannequin, showing no reaction to the pain. Determined to do it right, Evelyn worked with meticulous care for nearly an hour. By the time she finished, her knees had gone numb from kneeling so long.

She peeled off her gloves, bracing herself against the bed as she rose to sit in the chair. Absently, she wiped the sweat beading on her forehead.

Then she cleaned the wound and secured it with a sterile bandage.

Dominic glanced at the sutures. "Slow and painful, but not bad. After our last fight, I thought you'd leave me to suffer. Yet here you are..."

Before he could finish, Evelyn shoved a thermometer between his lips, cutting him off.

Her gaze drifted to his palm, where a fresh cut from their previous argument remained untreated.

She disinfected it with iodine and wrapped it carefully.

Once done, she retrieved her stethoscope and began examining him.

"Your herbal soak needs modification," she said evenly.

Then she inserted acupuncture needles along key points in Dominic's legs. "Your condition is improving. You can start rehabilitation exercises soon—it'll speed recovery. Make sure Nathaniel massages your legs nightly to stimulate circulation." She sketched a diagram on paper, demonstrating the techniques for Nathaniel.

Nathaniel recorded the demonstration on his phone for reference.

After the massage, warmth spread through Dominic's legs like a gentle current. At first, he'd only allowed Evelyn to treat him out of desperation, expecting nothing. Yet her methods had produced undeniable results.

Dominic's eyes gleamed with disbelief. "Where did you learn medicine like this?"

Specialists had declared his legs beyond repair, yet in just a month, Evelyn had restored some sensation.

He'd investigated her thoroughly. Evelyn had no medical degree, no history of practice. How had she become this miracle worker capable of treating even him?

Evelyn answered calmly, "I learned from a great doctor."

Dominic's skepticism deepened. He'd tried countless treatments, and every specialist had given the same grim prognosis. One had mentioned that only Esther George, a legendary healer, might have helped him. "Who is Esther?" Dominic frowned.

The doctor had said Esther was the finest physician of their era but had vanished years ago. Rumors claimed they'd died—or taken on a single apprentice.

Dominic had dismissed it as fantasy.

Now, watching Evelyn's impossible results, he suddenly seized her wrist. "What's your connection to Esther?"
###Chapter 578

Evelyn looked completely bewildered. "Who's Cassandra? I've never even heard of her!"

"Wasn't she the one who trained you in medicine?"

"Absolutely not!"

Many powerful figures had sought Cassandra's expertise, but the elusive physician remained untraceable. Instead, they turned their attention to hunting down her rumored apprentice.

Dominic was beginning to suspect Evelyn's medical skills might rival—or even surpass—those of Cassandra's supposed protégé.

He had truly struck gold.

By the time the chaos settled, night had already fallen. At some point, Nathaniel had slipped into the kitchen and returned with dinner.

"Ms. Carter, why don't you stay and eat before you leave?"

Evelyn instinctively wanted to refuse, but then she remembered she still had matters to discuss with Dominic.

As a patient, Dominic's diet was restricted—he could only manage a bowl of broth. The rest of the meal, however, was left to Evelyn.

Despite having been half-dead hours earlier, Dominic now sat upright in bed.

"Nathaniel, change the sheets," Dominic ordered.

Nathaniel nodded, fetching fresh linens and helping Dominic settle back against the pillows.

Evelyn set down her fork, her tone sharpening. "The fire at the Bennett Villa—was that your doing?"

Dominic froze, his eyes narrowing dangerously.

Leaning back against the headboard, he pressed his tongue against his cheek, exuding a mix of amusement and menace. "Curiosity killed the cat, Evelyn."

After several encounters, Evelyn had learned to read Dominic well.

She knew that when he responded like that, it was his way of tacitly admitting the truth.

Her mind raced, piecing together the events.

Dominic must have infiltrated the Bennett Villa that night, setting the blaze that devastated the Bennett family. As he tried to escape, someone from the household had discovered him, resulting in the knife wound to his abdomen. The news had been buzzing with reports of the Powell and Bennett families battling over a prime plot of land in the eastern suburbs. Now, it all made sense.

She stared at him in disbelief.

"All this for a piece of land? How could you be so reckless with lives?"

If he hadn't been caught, the entire Bennett family could have perished in the fire. Worse, Dominic had deliberately disabled the estate's fire safety system to ensure maximum destruction.

She hadn't realized just how cold-blooded he could be.

Dominic smirked. "Is this really news to you? My methods have never been clean. You've always known that, haven't you?"

With that, he suddenly yanked Evelyn forward, pulling her face inches from his.

His voice dropped to a rough whisper. "So tell me—why did you save a monster like me? I gave you the chance that night. Why didn't you take the dagger and finish me off, hmm?"

Their eyes locked. His were bloodshot, the scent of iron still clinging to him.

Even though he'd eaten, his face remained ghostly pale.

Despite his threatening demeanor, Evelyn knew better than anyone—Dominic was nothing more than a paper tiger right now.

She thought he was ruthless, treating human life as if it were worthless.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, Nathaniel burst in from outside.

"Mr. Reginald Powell and Mr. Sebastian Powell are on their way here!"

Without hesitation, Nathaniel pulled Evelyn into the bathroom and shut the door behind them.

The moment they hid, the bedroom door swung open.

Through the thin bathroom door, Evelyn could hear the voices outside.

Reginald stood with one hand behind his back, radiating superiority as he looked at Dominic, who lounged against the bed.

"The Bennett family has withdrawn from the eastern suburbs bid. You handled this well," Reginald remarked.

Dominic's expression remained indifferent, only a flicker of mockery crossing his face.

Sebastian's voice followed, laced with disapproval. "Dominic, our father is here, and you're just lying there? Is this how you show respect?"
###Chapter 579

Dominic let out a dark chuckle. "My legs don't work, Sebastian. Surely you've noticed that by now?"

Sebastian's eyes raked over Dominic's motionless limbs before narrowing suspiciously. "Are they really paralyzed, or is this just another one of your schemes to avoid helping the Powell family?"

At this accusation, Reginald's expression turned stormy. "Dominic, so all this time, your so-called disability was just an act?"

Dominic remained silent.

Nathaniel's face flushed with anger. "Mr. Powell's condition is medically verified! The hospital records prove it!"

Sebastian scoffed. "And hospital records can't be forged? Wasn't it through deception and manipulation that the Powells gained their status in the first place?" His gaze turned icy. "Besides, since when does a mere servant interrupt family discussions?"

Reginald's voice turned glacial. "Dominic, after everything the Powell family has done for you, this is how you repay us? Your brothers have sacrificed everything for this family. And you? You just take and take. Now you're faking paralysis too? Get up this instant!"

As Reginald reached for him, Dominic suddenly hurled the glass in front of him onto the marble floor.

The explosive shattering sound echoed through the room, sending shards scattering in all directions.

Dominic smiled faintly, but it was a smile that chilled the blood. "Demanding a paralyzed man to stand? Isn't that asking too much?"

Though his voice was quiet, it carried an undeniable weight that pressed down on everyone present. "Have you said your piece?" His piercing gaze swept across both men. "Then get out."

The room plunged into tense silence. Both men were momentarily stunned by Dominic's commanding presence.

Several heartbeats passed before Sebastian found his voice again.

"Dominic, how dare you speak to Father like that? Yes, you handled the Walker situation well, but that doesn't give you the right to act superior. I can tolerate your arrogance, but ordering Father to leave? Have you no respect?"

Dominic's eyes turned to ice. His next words cut through the air like a blade. "I won't repeat myself. Leave."

The final word came out as a thunderous command that seemed to vibrate through the very walls. The chandelier above them trembled slightly.

Reginald glared at Dominic, visibly trembling with suppressed rage, but ultimately turned on his heel and stormed out.

The silence that followed was deafening. Sebastian took two deliberate steps closer to Dominic.

His smile was unsettling. "Dominic, believe it or not, I swear I wasn't the one who pulled the trigger that night. You're my brother. Why would I ever hurt you?"

Dominic met his gaze unflinchingly. "Sebastian, don't worry. If it wasn't you, I won't falsely accuse you. But if it was..." His eyes darkened dangerously. "You'll pay dearly."

The intensity of Dominic's stare forced Sebastian to look away. Without another word, he turned and exited.

The moment the door closed, Nathaniel rushed to lock it.

Still fuming, Nathaniel couldn't contain his outrage. "Mr. Reginald is completely unreasonable! After you risked your life infiltrating the Walker estate that night, this is how he treats you? That wound on your stomach proves your sacrifice, yet he lets Sebastian mock you like that? They're in this together! It's outrageous!"

Dominic remained eerily calm. Compared to Nathaniel's fury, he seemed completely detached, as if none of this concerned him.

The bathroom door creaked open, and Evelyn stepped out.

Nathaniel suddenly remembered her presence and immediately fell silent. With an awkward nod, he exited to stand guard outside.

The room filled with prolonged silence, broken only by Evelyn's steady gaze studying Dominic's face.
###Chapter 580

Reginald Powell showed no affection for his son Dominic, while his brothers, dripping with sarcasm, wouldn't hesitate to betray him at the first opportunity.

Only now did Evelyn realize Dominic's seemingly privileged life was nothing but an elaborate illusion.

His standing in the Powell family might have been even more precarious than her own experiences at Hawthorne Estate.

Despite his paralyzed legs, the Powells still suspected him of faking his condition.

Noticing her intense gaze, Dominic's lips curled into that familiar, sardonic smile. "Eavesdropping, were we?"

Evelyn chewed her lower lip before asking cautiously, "All these years... have you been handling the Powell family's dirty work?"

Leaning back against the headboard, Dominic closed his eyes. "Essentially."

Her suspicions were confirmed. Dominic was merely a pawn for the Powells. Nobody cared if he lived or died, if he was happy or healthy. The only concern was whether he completed his tasks without tarnishing the family name. He'd nearly died from his injuries last night, yet his so-called family couldn't be bothered. The realization made Evelyn's chest tighten painfully.

"That gunshot wound on your shoulder - was that Sebastian's doing?"

Dominic's eyes narrowed to slits. "If not him, then my dear eldest brother. What's this? Pity? No longer calling me heartless?"

"I'm just wondering... if you hadn't set fire to Willowbrook Apartments, what would have happened?"

"The Powells don't tolerate useless members. Even if I hadn't lit that match, the outcome would've been the same."

Evelyn frowned in confusion. "What do you mean?"

"You're asking too many questions tonight. Not afraid of me anymore?" Dominic's mocking gaze traveled over her face as he tilted his chin.

"I'll give you two options - leave now, or..."

He patted the empty space beside him on the bed, the unspoken invitation clear.

Evelyn didn't hesitate to choose the first option.

Nathaniel escorted her through the back exit. As they walked, Evelyn couldn't stop dissecting Dominic's words.

He wasn't merely stating facts - he was telling her that regardless of who actually set Willowbrook ablaze, the blame would have fallen on him regardless.

Dominic was the Powell family's designated scapegoat, shouldering responsibility for all their atrocities. Even if he'd been innocent, someone else's crimes would still have been pinned on him. The realization sent ice through Evelyn's veins.

The Powell family's rise from infamy to respectability was built on Dominic's suffering. He endured a decade in prison, was branded a murderer and arsonist, became the monster society feared. But that wasn't the real Dominic. The Powells had molded him into this figure of nightmares. Many atrocities attributed to him weren't even his doing - they'd simply been dumped onto his shoulders.

He was a tool for the family's advancement, disposable from the start. His cruelty was merely armor hiding his pain. Nobody cared about the real Dominic, the boy who'd never known love. Evelyn's gaze dropped to the cobblestones.

Regret twisted in her gut. She'd fought with Dominic earlier, called him merciless.

But how could someone who'd never received love or kindness be anything else?

Her words had probably wounded him deeper than any bullet.

"Ms. Carter, if you turn this corner, you'll reach your orchestra," Nathaniel said quietly.

Evelyn nodded absently, taking a few steps before hesitating. She turned back.

"Give this to Dominic for me."
###Chapter 581

"Evelyn told you to give this to me, but she didn't say anything else?" Dominic's voice was laced with skepticism as he examined the pink lollipop Nathaniel handed him.

"Nothing at all," Nathaniel confirmed, watching his employer's reaction carefully.

Dominic turned the candy between his fingers, his expression unreadable. "Does she think I'm some child who can be pacified with sweets?" Though his words were dismissive, he didn't return the treat.

Nathaniel ventured cautiously, "Perhaps Ms. Carter simply wanted to share something pleasant with you. Or maybe she considers you a friend? Friends often exchange small tokens like this, don't they?"

The tension between Dominic and Evelyn had been palpable during their recent encounters, filled with heated debates and opposing viewpoints. To Nathaniel, this gesture seemed like an olive branch.

"I find Ms. Carter quite remarkable," Nathaniel continued. "When you were at your weakest, despite your recent arguments, she came immediately when I asked for her help. That's the mark of a true friend."

Dominic's fingers tightened around the lollipop as he stared out the window. "Do you know what I admire most about her?"

Nathaniel blinked in surprise at the unexpected question.

"She's like sunlight breaking through storm clouds," Dominic murmured, a rare softness in his voice. "You find yourself drawn to her warmth without even realizing it."

Over the next fortnight, Evelyn balanced her rigorous orchestra rehearsals with daily treatments for Dominic's injuries. Their interactions remained strictly professional - doctor and patient.

Dominic proved to be an exemplary patient, enduring painful therapies without complaint and following every instruction precisely. Evelyn had promised to help him walk again, and she was determined to keep that vow.

His recovery progressed astonishingly well, especially after she incorporated therapeutic massages into his regimen. Within weeks, Dominic could stand with support, and full mobility seemed imminent.

Meanwhile, under Leonard Herty's expert tutelage, Evelyn's cello skills flourished. The renowned musician had submitted her application for the orchestra's upcoming auditions without her knowledge.

Cassandra Brown emerged from the vice conductor's office, her eyes scanning the competitor list. Her lips twisted into a sneer when she spotted Evelyn's name.

"Nepotism at its finest," she scoffed to her companions. "Does she have no shame, competing after buying her way into Herty's tutelage?"

The orchestra buzzed with rumors that Evelyn had used Alexander Whitmore's influence to pressure Leonard into accepting her as a student. Too focused on practice to address the gossip, Evelyn noticed the subtle shift in her colleagues' attitudes.

A chance encounter in the cafeteria revealed Rachel wasn't the rumor's source - her genuine surprise at hearing the story was evident. That left Cassandra.

Their confrontation came in the break room when Cassandra blocked Evelyn's path. "People like you, bribing your way into Mr. Herty's circle with dirty money, don't belong in this orchestra. You're contaminating our sacred space of art!"

Her two followers nodded vigorously. "Mr. Herty might tolerate you, but we don't want your kind here."

Evelyn's icy gaze swept over them before her lips curved into a knowing smile. "What I enjoy most," she said sweetly, "is watching people like you seethe with hatred, yet remain utterly powerless to change anything."
###Chapter 582

"What are you implying? Are you confessing you used connections to get in?"

Cassandra Brown's eyes widened in shock. The rumor she'd casually spread turned out to be true after all.

"You actually pressured Mr. Herty into accepting you as his student!" Her voice trembled with indignation. "Mr. Herty is this orchestra's pride, and you're tarnishing his reputation!"

Evelyn Carter couldn't be bothered to argue with someone like Cassandra. These were the types who couldn't achieve what they wanted and resorted to slandering others out of spite.

Truthfully, their jealousy stemmed from one simple fact—she was Leonard Herty's only protégé.

"Let me make something clear," Evelyn said icily, her fingers tightening around her cello case. "This marks the second time you've provoked me. Don't test my patience."

Her gaze swept over Cassandra with undisguised disdain. Initially, Evelyn hadn't cared much about the internal selection competition. But suddenly, the thought of making Cassandra taste bitter defeat became irresistibly appealing. As the principal cellist, losing to a newcomer like Evelyn would be utterly humiliating.

"What better way to silence her than by crushing her in the competition?" The thought brought a dangerous glint to Evelyn's eyes.

"Care to make it interesting?" Evelyn's lips curled into a challenging smile. "Whoever wins the selection. If you lose, you'll publicly apologize to me before the entire orchestra."

Cassandra scoffed, tossing her hair over her shoulder. "You? Honestly believe you can outperform me?"

She'd heard Evelyn play during orchestra rehearsals shortly after she joined. The amateurish technique, the rookie mistakes that took years to unlearn—it was painfully obvious Evelyn was merely a hobbyist.

The audacity of this novice challenging her, a professional who'd been playing since childhood, was laughable.

Confidence oozed from Cassandra's smirk. "Fine. But when you lose, you'll admit before everyone that you used connections to join and coerced Mr. Herty into teaching you. Then you'll resign from the orchestra permanently. Agreed?"

Evelyn hesitated, taken aback by the severity of the terms.

Cassandra pressed her advantage, voice dripping with mockery. "What's wrong? Suddenly having second thoughts?"

"No," Evelyn replied evenly, meeting her gaze. "I simply don't know how to confess to something that never happened."

"Spare me the act," Cassandra sneered. "No one ever admits they used connections."

As tensions escalated, Evelyn's phone vibrated insistently in her pocket.

Alexander Whitmore's name flashed on the screen.

Stepping aside, Evelyn answered in a hushed tone. "Yes?"

"That internal selection competition your orchestra's hosting in two weeks—I just received an invitation."

Evelyn paused, recalling Leonard mentioning external participants would be invited to vote. The inclusion of outsiders from prominent families helped maintain voting impartiality by preventing internal factions from forming.

"Yes, that's correct."

"Are you competing?" Alexander's voice carried subtle curiosity.

"I am," Evelyn confirmed softly.

Alexander's tone warmed with amusement. "It's been years since I last heard you play. This should be... interesting."

His lighthearted teasing coaxed a small smile from Evelyn. "I've improved tremendously. Prepare to be impressed."

"There's something else you should know."

"What is it?"

"Mr. White is dead."

The words struck Evelyn like a physical blow.

It took her a moment to place the name, though it rang faint bells in her memory.

"That man who nearly assaulted Isabella at Eclipse Lounge last time—he was detained for over two weeks and just released yesterday. This morning, they found his body in his own bar." Alexander's words hung heavily between them.

Evelyn's breath caught. "That's... unexpected. What happened?"

"The official report lists it as suicide."

The silence that followed was deafening.
###Chapter 583

A chilling thought crossed Evelyn's mind. "As vile as Mr. White was, his actions didn't deserve death. He had sinister intentions toward Isabella, but no actual harm came to her. So why did he suddenly take his own life?"

Dominic's face flashed before her eyes.

"Could it have been him?" she wondered.

"After all, it was Dominic who lured Isabella to the Eclipse Lounge that night."

"But that doesn't add up. Mr. White never implicated Dominic to the police. What reason would Dominic have to silence him?"

Alexander's voice snapped her back to reality. "The police investigation concluded it was suicide. But..."

"But it's bizarre, isn't it? Who chooses to end their life by... that method?"

Alexander made a low sound of agreement. "Precisely."

Such brutal self-mutilation seemed less like suicide and more like calculated vengeance.

If this was revenge, the perpetrator must have ties to Isabella.

"Isabella spent years overseas. Who would go to such lengths for her?" Evelyn pondered.

The more she considered it, the more Dominic seemed the only plausible suspect.

As she wrestled with these thoughts, Isabella walked past with her violin case slung across her back.

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. She abruptly ended the call and intercepted her.

"Care to join me for lunch?"

Isabella frowned, visibly startled by the unexpected invitation. "We're hardly close enough for shared meals."

"My meal card's empty," Evelyn replied with practiced nonchalance.

Isabella's reluctance was palpable.

Undeterred, Evelyn added, "Alexander funded your entire music education abroad - we're talking millions. Surely you won't begrudge me a cafeteria meal?" Isabella's eyes narrowed as she studied Evelyn, clearly suspicious of her motives.

Before Isabella could protest further, Evelyn casually grasped her sleeve and steered them toward the dining hall.

With no financial constraints, Evelyn ordered enough food for a small banquet before settling opposite Isabella.

Her extravagance left Isabella utterly perplexed.

Once served, Evelyn attacked her meal with single-minded focus, as if her only purpose was mooching off Isabella's account. Gradually, Isabella's guard lowered. Watching Evelyn eat with such gusto, she eventually picked up her own utensils. It was her money after all - every uneaten bite felt like wasted funds.

When the atmosphere seemed sufficiently relaxed, Evelyn dropped her bombshell. "Mr. White is dead."

Isabella's fork froze mid-air. "What did you say?"

"The man from the Eclipse Lounge. He committed suicide."

Shock flickered across Isabella's features before giving way to a satisfied smile. "Good riddance! Karma's a bitch. But... why would he kill himself?" Evelyn studied Isabella's reaction carefully.

Her surprise appeared genuine, without a trace of deception.

Evelyn had briefly entertained the possibility that Isabella orchestrated revenge, but now dismissed it entirely.

Setting down her fork, Evelyn rose to leave.

"Wait!" Isabella called after her. "We're not finished here. Where are you going?"
###Chapter 584

The moon cast silvery beams through the music room windows as Evelyn Carter remained late into the night, her cello practice echoing through the empty halls.

With the internal competition looming and her wager with Cassandra Brown, every moment counted.

Cassandra's position as principal cellist proved she possessed genuine talent, making Evelyn push herself harder.

Though Leonard Herty had been giving her private lessons, the rest of the orchestra remained unaware of her rapid progress.

The deserted practice room provided perfect solitude, allowing Evelyn to immerse herself completely in the music.

Her fingers danced across the strings with newfound precision, unaware of the shadow pausing outside the door.

As principal cellist, Cassandra immediately recognized the mastery in the performance. The vibrato resonated with perfect pitch, each note brimming with emotion.

Her steps slowed involuntarily.

The technical brilliance combined with emotional depth surpassed anything she'd heard from their orchestra.

Cassandra edged closer, peering through the door's small window. When she saw Evelyn's focused expression, her face drained of color.

"This can't be!"

Evelyn's playing had been amateurish before - rough technique, frequent missed notes.

How had she transformed so dramatically in such short time?

If this continued, the internal selection...

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms, bitter envy twisting her features.

"Of course," she thought bitterly. "Private lessons from Maestro Herty make all the difference."

"But why her? Just because she comes from money?"

The injustice burned through her. Cassandra vowed to expose Evelyn's privileged advantage and humiliate her before the entire orchestra.

The selection would occur at the prestigious Symphony Hall nearby.

Participants were granted access the day before to familiarize themselves with the venue.

Leonard's coaching session ran overtime, discussing nuanced interpretations of the competition piece.

By the time Evelyn arrived, the orchestra group had already departed.

She hailed a cab, relieved the venue was only two stops away.

The grand concert hall stood empty, its usual bustle absent without scheduled performances.

While others knew the layout well, Evelyn navigated the maze-like backstage area for the first time.

After locating her assigned dressing room, she found nothing amiss and turned to leave.

Then came the unmistakable click of a lock engaging.

Her pulse spiked.

Evelyn rushed toward the sound, but the door was already secured from outside.

"Hello? Someone's still in here!" Her voice echoed unanswered.

This made no sense. The security desk had been manned when she arrived.

They'd confirmed locking wouldn't occur until after 8 p.m.

Her watch showed 7:30. Even accounting for getting lost, she should have had ten minutes.

Realization dawned - someone had deliberately trapped her.

Hands trembling, Evelyn grabbed her phone.

No signal.

The shadows seemed to press closer as the reality of her situation sank in.
###Chapter 585

Something wasn't right. Evelyn's phone displayed [No Signal] as if someone had intentionally severed her connection to the outside world.

Though spring had arrived, the night air still carried a biting chill. She instinctively wrapped her coat tighter around herself, but the icy wind cut through the fabric like knives. Even with the main doors securely locked, an unsettling tension hung heavy in the air.

Unable to gain entry, she retreated to the lounge. In the dead of night, the space felt unnervingly hollow, her voice bouncing off the walls when she called out. The lights had been switched off, casting eerie shadows across the empty room. Fear coiled in her stomach, making her curl into a tight ball on the couch. "Who would do this?" she wondered.

After careful consideration, she concluded it must be Cassandra. Earlier that evening, when she'd stepped off the bus, she'd caught a fleeting glimpse of someone who looked like Cassandra across the street.

Time dragged on mercilessly as the temperature continued to drop. Evelyn activated her phone's flashlight, hoping to signal someone outside.

But as her battery dwindled to single digits, no help came.

Resigned, she sank back into the couch, worrying how this sleepless ordeal might affect tomorrow's crucial orchestra auditions.

The relentless cold gnawed at her bones, making relaxation impossible. Her fingers had lost all sensation, and her legs felt like blocks of ice.

Suddenly, she remembered Alexander. They'd planned to have dinner together tonight.

"Will he realize something's wrong when I don't show up?" she thought.

Alexander arrived at the symphony hall precisely on time, waiting for Evelyn.

But as minutes turned to hours, there was still no sign of her.

Assuming she might be running late, he waited an additional twenty minutes.

Just then, Isabella emerged from the building. Spotting his car, she hurried over, her face lighting up with delight.

"Alexander! What a surprise to see you here!"

"I'm waiting for Evelyn. We have dinner plans."

Isabella's smile faltered. "Oh... I thought maybe you'd come to see me."

Alexander didn't respond, his gaze fixed on the building's entrance. Undeterred, Isabella opened the passenger door and slid in without invitation.

"Then I'll keep you company while you wait."

Alexander's expression flickered briefly, but he remained silent. After ten minutes, Isabella sighed dramatically.

"I'm starving. Why is she always so inconsiderate with other people's time?"

Alexander frowned. "I'm taking Evelyn out tonight. If you're hungry, you should go eat."

"But I hate dining alone. What's the harm in joining you?" Isabella pouted, her voice dripping with petulance.

"Isabella," he said firmly, "I've told you before. I don't want Evelyn getting the wrong idea. I'm a married man, and your presence would only create unnecessary tension. Surely you understand that?" Isabella fell silent. After a long pause, she lowered her head, tears welling in her eyes. "Alexander," she whispered, her voice trembling. "Do you know what today is?"

He turned to look at her, confused.

"It's my twenty-third birthday. Did you forget?"

She bit her lip, her fingers twisting together as if trying to hold herself together.

"Back home, birthdays were special. My parents would each give me presents, and I was the center of attention all day."

Her gaze drifted to the window, lost in nostalgic memories.

"But now... my family is gone. The only person who still celebrated with me was my brother Andrew."

Her voice broke with emotion. "And now... Andrew's gone too."

Tears streamed down her cheeks, splashing onto her tightly clasped hands.

She wiped them away gently, her movements as delicate as her fragile state.

Alexander froze.

He hadn't realized it was Isabella's birthday.

Reaching into the glove compartment, he pulled out tissues and handed them to her. "Here."

Isabella accepted them, dabbing at her eyes.

"Alexander," she said softly, "I just didn't want to spend my birthday alone. I promise, if you let me come, I won't interfere with your date." Alexander hesitated, a pang of sympathy stirring within him. "Fine. When Evelyn arrives, I'll explain the situation."

Isabella's tears transformed into a radiant smile. Without thinking, she reached for his hand.

From a short distance away, a man stood observing the entire exchange through the open car window.
###Chapter 586

Dominic's lips curled into a sly smirk.

His fingers hovered over the phone screen as he captured the perfect shot - Alexander and Isabella sitting intimately close in the car. With a satisfied tap, he sent the photo to Evelyn's number.

The message remained unread. No blue ticks appeared. Dominic's brow furrowed as he dialed her number again.

"Out of service," the automated voice repeated.

Something wasn't right.

He turned to Nathaniel, his trusted assistant who stood nearby. "When does a phone show out of service?"

"Dead zone, perhaps?" Nathaniel suggested with a shrug.

Dominic's jaw tightened. "Impossible. This area has perfect coverage."

Meanwhile, Alexander grew increasingly restless as Evelyn failed to appear. His calls went straight to voicemail, each unanswered attempt tightening the knot in his stomach.

The arrival of a charter bus outside the concert hall drew everyone's attention. Passengers streamed out, led by a visibly smug Cassandra Brown.

"Someone's in a good mood," Miranda Price observed, nudging her friend.

Cassandra's smirk widened. "Just celebrating one less obstacle in my path."

"What obstacle?" Miranda pressed.

"Nothing worth mentioning," Cassandra dismissed with a haughty wave.

Isabella, familiar with most orchestra members, studied the newcomers with narrowed eyes. "Aren't these all first-chair cellists?" she murmured, resting her chin thoughtfully on her palm.
###Chapter 587

The guard swallowed hard, his professionalism barely holding against the man's chilling presence.

"Handing over this key isn't something I can do lightly," he managed, voice wavering.

Dominic's gaze turned glacial. "I suggest you rethink that answer."

Before the guard could speak, Dominic's fist connected with his jaw.

"Waste of time," Dominic muttered, plucking the keys from the guard's belt. He strode toward the concert hall without a backward glance.

In the dim lounge, Evelyn hugged her knees, shivering violently. A faint sound made her freeze.

Footsteps.

Getting closer.

She scrambled up, but her numb legs betrayed her. She crashed into a side table, sending a vase shattering across the floor.

Pain lanced through her as she clutched her bleeding knee.

Dominic paused mid-step at the crash. He sprinted toward the noise.

Just as Evelyn examined her injury, blinding light flooded the room as power returned.

Before she could react, strong arms yanked her against a hard chest. An unfamiliar cedar-and-spice scent made her stiffen.

The arms tightened like steel bands.

She looked up—and gasped.

Dominic Powell stared back, eyes gleaming with dark amusement.

Her gaze dropped to his legs in shock. "You—you're walking?"

His lips curved. "Thanks to you." His thumb brushed her cheekbone. "Miss me?"

Evelyn's mind reeled. "How did you even know I was here?"

"Call it... fate."

She scowled. The man spoke in riddles.

Outside, Alexander Whitmore's car screeched to a halt. He stormed toward the entrance, grabbing the first guard he saw.

"Where are the damn keys?"

The guard sighed. After tonight's chaos, what was one more intruder?

"Some psycho took them five minutes ago."

Isabella Morgan trailed behind, adjusting her dress. "Alexander, slow down!" she called.

He didn't even glance back, disappearing into the building.

Inside, Dominic studied Evelyn's blue-tinged lips and shaking hands.

Without a word, he shrugged off his coat and draped it over her shoulders. "Wear it."

Evelyn hesitated—then surrendered to the warmth. As feeling returned, realization struck.

Dominic Powell had just saved her.

Again.
###Chapter 588

Evelyn studied Dominic's face intently. "Was it you who killed Mr. White?"

"Mr. White?" Dominic's brow furrowed. "Who's that?"

"Vincent White, the owner of Eclipse Lounge. Didn't you see Isabella there?" Evelyn pressed, her voice tight.

Dominic let out a dry chuckle. "Why would I kill him? I don't even know the man. Cover my tracks?" He shook his head. "You give me too little credit. For something so insignificant, I wouldn't waste my energy."

Evelyn searched his eyes, looking for any sign of deception.

Dominic met her gaze steadily, his expression unreadable.

Having spent considerable time with him, Evelyn understood Dominic to some extent. She knew that despite his unpredictable nature, he wasn't one to lie outright.

"If he says it wasn't him, then it wasn't him," she concluded silently.

"But if not Dominic, then how did Mr. White die?" The mystery deepened, leaving her more confused than before.

Suddenly remembering her dinner plans with Alexander, Evelyn realized she was already late. She turned to leave, but Dominic's voice stopped her.

"Did you see the photo I sent you?"

Evelyn frowned. "My phone has no signal. What photo?"

Dominic handed her his phone. The screen displayed an image of Alexander and Isabella sitting together in a car outside the orchestra building, deep in conversation.

From the angle, it almost looked like they were embracing.

"This one wasn't staged," Dominic said with a shrug. "Pure coincidence."

Evelyn's face paled. Her fingers tightened around the phone, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Dominic's voice dropped lower. "Maybe it's time you stepped aside and let them be."

"Or better yet," his gaze flicked to her abdomen, "marry me. I'd make an excellent ready-made father."

Evelyn snapped. She shoved the phone back at him.

"Why would I want to marry into the Powell family? Our deal was simple - I help you walk again. Now that you're healed, we're done. We shouldn't see each other again." She turned sharply to leave.

"Honestly, darling, it's not your decision to make. You think I'll let you walk away that easily?"

Dominic moved swiftly, blocking her path. "A man who can't make up his mind isn't worth your time. If you're not satisfied with my family, the Caldwells aren't much better." He placed a hand on her shoulder. "Besides, I did save your life tonight. The least you could do is not be so eager to cut ties."

At that moment, Alexander and Isabella reached the lounge entrance.

Isabella trailed behind, protesting. "Alexander, I'm telling you, she's not here—" Her words died when they reached the doorway.

Hearing their approach, Dominic suddenly pulled Evelyn into an embrace.

Caught off guard, Evelyn stiffened. Dominic's tall frame meant her face pressed against his chest. From that angle, her eyes locked with Alexander's through the doorway.

For a brief, electric moment, their gazes held. Evelyn could clearly see the shock in Alexander's eyes.

Dominic leaned down, whispering in her ear. "If he can cozy up to his childhood sweetheart, why can't you have a charming companion of your own?"

Evelyn had been about to push Dominic away, but when she saw Isabella clutching Alexander's arm, she froze.
###Chapter 589

Evelyn had always been consumed by jealousy because of Alexander, and it felt utterly unfair.

She wanted Alexander to taste the same bitterness she was drowning in right now.

Outside the door, Alexander was completely unprepared for the sight of Evelyn and Dominic locked in an intimate embrace.

A thousand questions exploded in his mind simultaneously.

"How long has Evelyn known Dominic? When did they even meet?"

"And what the hell is Dominic doing here in the first place?"

Behind him, Isabella stood frozen, her mouth slightly agape in shock.

Her thoughts raced. "This can't be happening. Why is Evelyn wrapped around my fiancé like this?"

"There must be something going on between them!"

Isabella, always the dramatic one, exclaimed loudly, "Well... This explains why you've both been so secretive!"

Alexander noticed Evelyn was wearing Dominic's jacket.

Isabella's words hit Alexander like a sledgehammer to the chest.

"They're hiding in this abandoned music hall where conveniently no one can reach them. Alexander, you've been played!"

Her shrill voice echoed through the empty corridor, ensuring everyone within earshot heard her accusation.

Alexander's expression darkened dangerously.

Dominic, however, seemed to be enjoying every second of this.

A smug smirk played on his lips. He didn't look the least bit guilty about being "caught" - if anything, he appeared thrilled.

Especially when he saw Alexander's stormy expression, Dominic's male ego practically glowed with satisfaction.

Dominic chuckled. "Talk about bad timing. Couldn't you two have waited five minutes?"

Alexander's jaw clenched visibly. His glare could have melted steel as he extended his hand toward Evelyn. "Evelyn, come here."

Evelyn stepped away from Dominic's embrace.

She had expected Alexander to explode with rage at the scene.

Any man would have reacted violently to seeing his woman in another man's arms.

But to her shock, he controlled his temper, swallowing his fury rather than making a scene.

Evelyn closed her eyes briefly, steeled to continue the charade. Yet seeing Alexander restrain himself so completely made her hesitate.

She took one step toward Alexander, but before she could move further, Dominic grabbed her wrist.

Dominic said, "Why should you go just because he says so? We were having a perfectly lovely evening."

He placed a possessive hand on her shoulder, giving her a look dripping with fake tenderness. His gaze deliberately stoked the flames.

"Let the baby take my last name," he added casually, "I'd be honored to be its father."

The words detonated like a grenade. Alexander's face turned murderous.

Without hesitation, he lunged forward and threw a punch at Dominic's face.

Dominic dodged at the last second, but it was a feint.

Alexander's real punch came from his other hand, connecting solidly with Dominic's jaw.

Blood immediately trickled from Dominic's split lip.

Dominic, who had never been struck before, looked genuinely shocked. His eyes narrowed dangerously as he licked the blood from his lip. His fists clenched, ready to retaliate. "You'll regret that."

Evelyn gasped as the situation spiraled out of control.

Seeing the two men about to brawl, she rushed between them. "Stop this! Right now!"

Her sudden movement made both men hesitate, neither wanting to accidentally hurt her.

Evelyn didn't wait for another word. She turned and walked briskly out of the room.
###Chapter 590

The moment Evelyn disappeared through the doors, Alexander sprinted after her. "Evelyn!"

Dominic remained motionless, his fingertips brushing the blood at his split lip.

Alexander hadn't pulled his punch.

Though Dominic had taken the hit, he didn't consider himself defeated. Alexander's face bore its own marks of their scuffle.

While Dominic could stand unaided now, his body hadn't fully recovered. A sudden wave of dizziness washed over him.

Dominic scowled and motioned toward Isabella, who stood frozen nearby. "Get over here and help me."

Isabella snapped out of her shock.

With visible reluctance and a hint of fear, she approached and slipped an arm around his waist.

From this close proximity, she couldn't help noticing Dominic's striking features - the rugged jawline, the piercing eyes that held a dangerous allure. Fragments of their previous encounters suddenly clicked into place.

Understanding dawned. Isabella finally grasped why Dominic had treated her with such coldness.

Her voice took on a teasing lilt as she studied his profile. "You're after Alexander's woman, aren't you?"

Dominic's gaze turned glacial, the sudden intensity making Isabella recoil.

Remembering his ruthless reputation, she swallowed her remaining words and focused on supporting his weight.

After a tense silence, Isabella ventured, "If you want Evelyn, why don't you call off our engagement?"

Dominic's laugh held no warmth. "That decision isn't mine to make. Take it up with my father, Reginald."

Isabella stiffened. "Reginald? Your father?"

The revelation shocked her. She'd never imagined someone as fiercely independent as Dominic would have his marriage arranged by family...

Outside the concert hall, Alexander finally caught up to Evelyn.

She still wore Dominic's coat - a detail that stoked Alexander's irritation.

Steeling himself, he blocked her path. "What's really going on between you and Dominic?"

Evelyn ignored him, flagging down a passing cab and sliding inside.

Alexander moved to follow.

But before he could reach the vehicle, the driver accelerated away.

"Miss, is that gentleman in the fancy car your boyfriend?"

The cabbie glanced at the luxury vehicle tailing them in his rearview mirror.

The high-performance Porsche maintained steady pursuit.

"Just saying," the driver continued with worldly wisdom, "for men like that, time equals money. If he's chasing you this hard, you must mean something special."

The approaching traffic light turned red. The driver could have sped through but chose to slow instead.

"Look at that! Who drives a Porsche like that just to chase a girl? That's true dedication right there."

Evelyn bit her lip. Memories of shivering alone in the concert hall while Alexander entertained Isabella flashed through her mind, reigniting her anger.

The driver gave a knowing smile in the mirror. "No point in running, sweetheart. How about I stop so you two can talk?"

Evelyn massaged her temples as the cab rolled to a halt.

The Porsche pulled up behind them, and Alexander emerged.
###Chapter 591

Simon scrambled out of the taxi, hastily paying the fare for Evelyn.

When he turned around, Alexander had already pulled Evelyn into his Porsche and sped away.

Left standing in the cold night air, Simon felt completely powerless.

The taxi driver tipped his hat with an amused grin. "Need another ride, sir?"

Simon could only exhale in defeat.

Inside the Porsche, Alexander secured Evelyn's seatbelt with careful hands.

The engine roared as he accelerated down the empty streets.

Evelyn sat in silence, struggling to control her emotions.

Her traitorous stomach growled loudly in the quiet car.

Alexander glanced at her, his expression unreadable.

He'd intended to drive straight home, but at the last moment swerved toward a small bistro. The place was nearly empty, staff wiping down tables.

"Sorry, we're closed," a waitress called out. "Kitchen's shut for the night."

Alexander checked his watch - almost 10:30 pm.

Evelyn turned to leave, but Alexander caught her wrist.

Dressed in his impeccable suit, he exuded effortless authority.

"Do you have any ingredients left?" he asked the waitress.

The young woman flushed under his intense gaze. "Some basics, yes."

"Would you allow us to use your kitchen?" His voice was calm but persuasive.

The waitress hesitated, clearly torn. "That's against policy..."

"My wife is expecting," Alexander explained gently. "She hasn't eaten all evening and your menu looked perfect for her cravings."

Biting her lip, the waitress finally nodded. "Okay, but clean up after yourselves. And this never happened."

"Thank you," Alexander said with genuine warmth.

The waitress disabled the security cameras and led them to the kitchen.

Alexander pulled out a chair for Evelyn. "Wait here."

Through the glass partition, Evelyn watched in shock as Alexander tied on an apron and began cooking with surprising skill.

In under fifteen minutes, he emerged with a steaming plate of fettuccine that smelled divine.

Evelyn felt her anger beginning to waver.

She propped her chin on her hands, fighting a smile. How dare one meal weaken her resolve?

"Eat," Alexander said, handing her a sanitized fork. "I'll make more if you're still hungry."

Evelyn remained silent. She took a bite and nearly moaned at the rich flavors.

She wanted to demand why he'd been with Isabella tonight, but speaking first felt like surrender.

The homemade sauce was far better than anything she'd expected.

Her hunger returned with vengeance.

Noticing Alexander wasn't eating, she frowned. "Aren't you having any?"

Alexander lowered his eyes. "I'm too furious to eat."
###Chapter 592

Evelyn exhaled quietly through her nose.

She had every right to be furious, yet Alexander looked like he carried the burdens of the entire universe. What did he have to be so troubled about? Her thoughts simmered. "You're the one who abandoned your pregnant wife in confinement while running off with Isabella."

She jabbed her fork into the spaghetti, keeping her gaze firmly on her plate.

Alexander's face still bore the marks from his earlier altercation with Dominic.

Though Alexander had landed more blows, Dominic had fought back fiercely.

His jawline was swollen, and a thin trail of blood still seeped from the cut at the corner of his mouth.

When Evelyn had nearly cleared her plate, Alexander finally shattered the heavy silence. His piercing gaze locked onto hers as he demanded, "How do you know Dominic?"

The night's events had left him shaken.

He didn't believe Evelyn had arranged to meet Dominic intentionally.

It was obvious she'd been locked inside the concert hall, and Dominic had...

But Alexander couldn't comprehend why Dominic, of all people, had been the first to rescue her.

It ate at him, flooding his veins with guilt.

If only he'd realized sooner that Evelyn was trapped, he could have reached her first. Instead, it was Dominic who had intervened.

As her husband, he'd failed her profoundly.

But stronger than the guilt was the fear.

Unlike Ethan, Evelyn's ex, Dominic represented an unknown variable. Ethan belonged to the past, but Dominic was here now.

And Alexander had no clue when or how they'd met.

This complete lack of knowledge unsettled him deeply.

Seeing Dominic embrace Evelyn, hearing him declare his feelings, had nearly pushed Alexander over the edge.

He couldn't fathom how their relationship had reached such an intimate level.

Dominic's open concern and admiration for Evelyn made Alexander's skin crawl.

The thought of his wife being desired by another man sickened him.

Yet as a rational man, despite his jealousy, Alexander needed to understand. He had to know the truth.

Evelyn mattered to him.

He refused to unleash his dark emotions on her - that would only erode their love, not strengthen it.

Maintaining his composure, he pressed again. "Evelyn, when did you two meet?"

Her response came softly. "Just once, long ago. In prison."

Alexander's eyebrows shot upward. "And now? What's between you?"

"Nothing," she stated firmly. "He was my patient. I treated his injury and helped him walk again."

Relief washed through Alexander.

So it had all been a misunderstanding.

He reached across the table, capturing her hand. His voice dropped to a serious tone. "But he has feelings for you."

Evelyn set down her fork and met his gaze squarely. "I can't control others' emotions. But I swear to you, I've done nothing inappropriate. Now, what about you? Didn't you promise not to meet Isabella alone? Why were you with her tonight?"

Her large eyes glistened with unshed tears, her voice trembling with raw hurt.
###Chapter 593

Alexander rushed to explain. "You've got it all wrong!"

Before he could finish, tears welled up in Evelyn's eyes. Not wanting him to see her cry, she stood abruptly and stormed out of the restaurant.

Alexander panicked, thinking she was leaving him for good. He bolted after her.

Evelyn stood by the curb, desperately trying to hail a cab. But the streets remained empty. She huffed in frustration, then noticed Alexander standing silently behind her.

Their eyes locked. Evelyn's breath hitched as something stirred deep inside her - like a gentle ripple disturbing still waters.

The first raindrops began to fall. Without thinking, Alexander pulled Evelyn into his embrace, shielding her from the rain with his body.

Feeling his protective gesture, Evelyn weakly pounded his chest with her fist.

Alexander caught her wrist and pressed her palm against his pounding heart.

His familiar sandalwood scent enveloped her, bringing an unexpected sense of security.

Her anger began to melt away.

"Why," she wondered, "does this man have to be so infuriatingly perfect? He won't even let me stay properly angry."

The truth was, Evelyn wasn't truly angry anymore. Just confused and hurt.

She'd spent hours trapped alone in that freezing concert hall, starving and frightened, only to find her husband arriving with another woman - and mentioning it was Isabella's birthday no less!

The rain intensified. Alexander gently guided Evelyn under a nearby awning, his hand protectively cradling the back of her head.

"You have a perfectly good husband with a car, yet you're trying to catch a cab? Evelyn, are you saying you don't trust me?"

Evelyn looked down. "It's not about trust. I'm jealous. Jealous of you and Isabella."

Her blunt confession surprised Alexander, but a warm smile spread across his face.

Tucking a damp strand of hair behind her ear, he murmured, "If you're jealous, it means you care. That makes me happier than you can imagine."

Evelyn rolled her eyes dramatically. "Who gets happy about making someone jealous? You're ridiculous! Maybe I should stay mad forever!"

She stomped on his foot and tried to push away.

Alexander tightened his grip and pulled her closer.

Leaning down, his voice turned serious. "I messed up. I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?"

His gaze held hers with raw sincerity. "I waited outside the concert hall for hours, but your phone was dead. Then Isabella showed up mentioning her birthday."

"I never intended to bring her. This was supposed to be our date night. But when I couldn't reach you, I thought she might know where you were." Alexander's eyes reflected only Evelyn's face.

Cupping her cheeks, he pressed a tender kiss to her forehead.

"Evelyn, you're the only woman I've ever loved."

The downpour turned torrential, transforming the streets into shimmering mirrors of neon lights.

In Alexander's deep gaze, Evelyn saw the city's glow - and her own astonished reflection.
###Chapter 594

Evelyn's pulse raced as Alexander's unexpected words hung in the air between them.

She could feel her heartbeat thundering against her ribs, especially when his intense gaze locked onto hers.

"This isn't fair," she scolded herself silently. "I shouldn't be melting this easily!"

Yet Alexander's raw honesty acted like a soothing balm, dissolving the last remnants of her anger.

"You're absolutely impossible, Alexander!"

Her voice carried through the downpour, playful yet soft, and she saw his lips curve into that devastating smile.

"Does this mean we can head home now?"

Without hesitation, Alexander dashed through the rain to bring his car directly to her side, shielding her completely from the storm.

Since they were near the Willowbrook Apartments, they opted to spend the night there.

As they exited the vehicle, Alexander's sharp eyes caught the unfamiliar jacket draped over Evelyn's shoulders. "Leave that here. I'll return it later," he stated firmly.

Once her legs healed, chances were they'd never see Dominic Powell again.

Exhausted, Evelyn took a quick shower and fell into a deep sleep the moment her head touched the pillow.

Meanwhile, Alexander returned to the car, snatched Dominic's jacket, and without hesitation tossed it into the nearest trash bin.

Unbeknownst to him, Ethan Caldwell stood smoking beneath a streetlamp, observing everything with keen interest.

After Alexander departed, Ethan casually strolled over and retrieved the discarded garment.

It was clearly a man's coat - definitely not Alexander's style.

He'd seen Evelyn wearing it earlier that evening.

"Why," he pondered, "would she be wearing another man's clothing?"

Ethan's expression darkened. In his experience, a man giving a woman his jacket always carried implications.

"Does Evelyn have another admirer besides me and Uncle Alexander?" he wondered.

Perhaps the unfamiliar surroundings affected her, but Evelyn awoke unusually early the next morning.

Remembering today's performance and yesterday's "accidental" locking incident at the concert hall, she quickly prepared to leave. "Let me drive you," Alexander offered, already rising from bed.

"No need. It's still early and I have plenty of time before the performance. You should rest."

Evelyn preferred handling her own battles. Involving Alexander would only complicate matters.

She had a strong suspicion about who'd locked her in yesterday.

She could manage this herself. Alexander's interference would only create unnecessary drama.

As she stepped outside, she nearly collided with Ethan.

Ignoring him completely, she headed toward the street.

Ethan easily matched her pace. "This neighborhood's terrible for taxis. Uncle Alexander really should have driven you."

Evelyn checked her phone. Her ride was two minutes away. She didn't dignify his comment with a response.

Ethan persisted. "Want me to give you a lift?"

Finally, Evelyn turned to face him. "Who do you think you are? Why would I ever accept a ride from you?"

Ethan seemed unfazed by her hostility.

"Evelyn, let me guess. You don't truly love Uncle Alexander, so you're seeing someone else. Am I right? Or maybe Isabella's presence has driven you to this. Like Claire, you've taken a lover, haven't you?" He'd spent the entire night obsessing over this theory.

Evelyn stared at him as if he'd lost his mind.

Ethan flashed a roguish grin. "If that's the case, you should have come to me. I'd happily play the role of your 'stand-in lover' to spite Uncle Alexander. And if we make it official? Well, I wouldn't object to that either."
###Chapter 595

Evelyn couldn't contain herself any longer. The dam burst as she snapped, "Are you truly this dense?"

Ethan recoiled as if struck, his expression morphing into one of utter disbelief. The woman before him seemed like a stranger.

"Evelyn...what did you just—"

She lifted her chin, her gaze locking onto his with unflinching intensity.

"I despise name-calling, but you leave me no choice. Ethan Caldwell, Cresthaven's golden boy. Must you debase yourself clinging to someone who wants nothing to do with you?"

His breath hitched. "You think I'm...degrading myself?"

"Every single day," Evelyn confirmed with a sharp nod.

Before he could respond, a sleek black sedan pulled up beside them.

Evelyn verified the license plate against her phone screen. Without sparing Ethan another glance, she yanked the door open and slid inside.

The car peeled away, leaving Ethan choking on exhaust fumes.

He stood frozen, watching the taillights disappear around the corner. His hands curled into white-knuckled fists at his sides.

"Does she detest me this much now?"

The realization struck like a physical blow, draining the color from his face. An aching hollowness spread through his chest, as if someone had carved out his heart with a dull spoon.

"Is this her retribution?" he wondered bitterly.

"The woman who once adored me now wants me to taste her suffering..."

Vanessa chose that moment to appear, rushing toward him with outstretched arms.

She wrapped herself around his waist from behind, pressing her cheek against his back.

"You still have me, Ethan. Evelyn doesn't deserve you, but I do. We're married now. Let's build our happiness together, yes?" Her voice dripped with saccharine sweetness, her manicured fingers tracing circles on his abdomen.

Ethan's face darkened. Revulsion twisted his features as he shoved her away violently.

"Know your place, Vanessa. Do you honestly believe I've kept you around out of affection?"

He seized her chin, forcing her to meet his glacial stare. Angry red marks bloomed beneath his fingertips.

"I want you to experience the agony of loving someone who'll never return your feelings. I want to watch you drown in misery, just as I'm drowning now."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode away without a backward glance.

Vanessa's tears fell freely.

She'd foolishly believed his reluctance to divorce after her miscarriage signaled lingering tenderness.

Now she understood. He simply wanted her to suffer.

The man's heart was carved from ice.

The orchestra members arrived at dawn, their shuttle bus pulling up to the concert hall's grand entrance.

Cassandra Brown stepped off with a spring in her step. The memory of Evelyn being locked inside overnight had erased all her nerves. She hummed a jaunty tune, adjusting the straps of her designer gown.

"Cassandra, you're radiant today!" Eleanor gushed from behind her. "Is that a new Valentino? It hugs your curves perfectly."

Cassandra preened. As principal cellist, she always dressed to impress for performances.

Today's selection required her most exquisite ensemble.

The internal competition would determine who performed at next month's gala. Beyond orchestra members, Cresthaven's elite had been invited to judge.

Though her father Edward Brown served as associate conductor, the Browns lacked true wealth. They were minnows swimming with sharks.

Cassandra envisioned herself center stage, her bow coaxing magic from the strings. The fantasy sent thrills down her spine.

If she could catch a wealthy matriarch's eye today, perhaps she'd land a proposal from an eligible heir.

Her daydreams carried her so high she barely noticed the ground beneath her feet.

Miranda's sharp gasp shattered the reverie. "Wait—why are there police cars surrounding the hall?"
###Chapter 596

"Did you hear? There was an attempted murder here last night!"

The excited whisper rippled through the gathered crowd like an electric current.

Miranda Price elbowed her way forward. "Murder? Tell me everything!"

"All I know is someone deliberately locked the doors. Security didn't notice until it was too late. The police are treating it as premeditated." Cassandra Brown felt her stomach drop.

She had only locked one door last night. How had this escalated into an attempted murder charge?

A cold sweat broke out across her forehead. Her breathing became shallow, especially when she saw two uniformed officers making a beeline for her.

"Ms. Brown? We need you to come with us."

"What are you talking about?" Cassandra's voice cracked with panic. "I didn't try to kill anyone! This is ridiculous!"

Her outburst turned every head in the vicinity.

The officers remained impassive. Years of experience had taught them that truth wasn't measured in decibels.

"The investigation will determine that. Please cooperate."

Cassandra's frantic denials only fueled the growing whispers around her.

"I never would've guessed. Cassandra always seemed so put together."

"Who was the target? Do we know the victim?"

"Must be serious if they're arresting her before the performance."

The gossip burned Cassandra's cheeks hotter than any spotlight.

Then Evelyn Carter appeared.

Cassandra's mouth fell open. "You...you're..."

Evelyn offered a thin smile. "You should cooperate with the police. Though I suppose our little wager is settled now."

Cassandra gnawed her lip.

She remembered all too well.

To maximize Evelyn's humiliation, Cassandra had made sure the entire orchestra knew about their bet.

Now everyone would witness her public apology.

"This isn't over!" Cassandra spat, clinging to her pride. "We haven't even performed yet!"

Evelyn checked her watch. "The concert starts in fifty minutes. Do you really think they'll release you that quickly?"

Cassandra's face darkened with realization. "You called them, didn't you? This was your plan all along! If you were truly confident in your skills, you wouldn't need to sabotage me!"

"Funny," Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "I seem to recall who sabotaged whom first."

She stepped closer, resting a deceptively light hand on Cassandra's shoulder.

"You claim you're not afraid of losing to me, yet you locked me in the concert hall."

Evelyn had dealt with Vanessa Hart's manipulations for years; Cassandra's amateur theatrics barely registered.

Cassandra spluttered. "Afraid? Of you? Don't flatter yourself! I'm the principal cellist!"

"If not fear," Evelyn's voice dropped to an arctic whisper, "then your only motive was attempted murder."
###Chapter 597

The room fell into heavy silence.

Evelyn said nothing, her fingers tightening around her cello bow.

Alexander's voice was calm but firm. "There's no need for concern. The authorities are thorough. If she's guilty, justice will be served."

Cassandra's face drained of color as officers led her away, the murmurs of orchestra members following her like a shadow.

Within minutes, the incident became the hottest topic among the musicians. Evelyn found herself at the center of whispered conversations.

When Edward Brown received word about his daughter's arrest, he rushed to the concert hall in panic.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat in her dressing room, carefully adjusting the pegs of her instrument.

Alexander arrived carrying an extravagant bouquet of white roses, placing them silently in her dressing room before stepping out. Their paths crossed with Edward in the hallway.

Though not close to Evelyn, Edward recognized Alexander immediately.

Seeing the powerful businessman felt like grasping at straws.

"Mr. Whitmore," Edward pleaded, wringing his hands. "Your wife wasn't seriously harmed. Cassandra is just impulsive. I'll ensure she understands the gravity of her actions. Could we perhaps... overlook this incident?"

Alexander's expression darkened visibly.

"Impulsive? She's twenty-six. My wife is twenty-three."

"As the orchestra director, you should be enforcing discipline, not making excuses. Frankly, this makes me question your leadership."

Edward's face flushed crimson.

Being chastised by a man fifteen years his junior burned his pride.

Alexander continued mercilessly. "Your parenting speaks for itself. Twenty-six years of your guidance produced this. Since you've failed, the legal system will educate her properly."

Edward bowed his head as curious colleagues passed by.

The sight of their esteemed director groveling before Alexander set tongues wagging.

Beads of sweat formed on Edward's forehead as regret washed over him. He'd underestimated Alexander's protective nature.

"You're absolutely right. I was mistaken. Cassandra was wrong," Edward forced out between clenched teeth. "Please accept my sincerest apologies."

"Why apologize to me?" Alexander's gaze flicked toward the dressing room. "I wasn't the one locked in a freezing room for hours. Edward, how would you suggest we handle this? Your orchestra connections might protect you, but I have contacts in the city council. As for your position..."

Edward's stomach dropped.

He'd come to beg for his daughter's freedom, not realizing his own career hung in the balance.

"Rules exist for a reason! I never show favoritism!" Edward declared hastily.

He just wanted this nightmare over, realizing he'd tangled with the wrong man. "When Cassandra is released, I'll personally bring her to apologize to your wife."

Inside the dressing room, Evelyn heard every word.

A small smile touched her lips. Alexander's fierce protectiveness still surprised her.

This feeling of security, knowing someone always had her back, warmed her more than any applause ever could.

Then the stage manager knocked.

"Ms. Carter? You're on in two minutes."

Evelyn stood, smoothing her gown. She'd memorized every note, practiced every measure. As the announcer called her name, mentioning she was...
###Chapter 598

To maintain impartiality, all competitors in the same section performed identical musical pieces.

Evelyn Carter's turn came toward the finale. Three other cellists had already played the same composition, leaving the audience somewhat weary.

But Evelyn's interpretation stood apart. Her rendition brimmed with raw emotion, every note meticulously crafted with precision.

When she finished, the concert hall erupted in thunderous applause.

She earned the highest score of the competition - a staggering 9.5 out of 10.

"Looks like we might have a new principal cellist."

"She surpasses Cassandra. Leonard truly lives up to his reputation, mentoring such an exceptional protégé."

"She's only been with our orchestra for a month, hasn't she?"

"Her talent must be extraordinary. Why else would Leonard personally select her from all the brilliant musicians here?"

In the audience, Isabella Morgan clenched her fists.

This marked her first time witnessing Evelyn perform.

She felt relieved to specialize in violin rather than cello.

Otherwise, she wouldn't stand a chance competing directly against such skill.

After her performance, Evelyn retreated to the dressing room. Isabella intercepted her in the corridor.

"Congratulations," Isabella offered.

Evelyn studied her briefly. She couldn't be bothered deciphering whether the congratulations were genuine or forced. "Thanks," she replied simply.

"I scored highest in the violin section," Isabella added defensively. "I'm just as accomplished as you."

Evelyn tilted her head, expression neutral. "Nobody suggested otherwise. Why so defensive?"

"You know the winners will represent the orchestra in the composition competition, right? The forty-eight-hour challenge. It's a team event. I intend to win first place. Don't drag me down." The prestigious competition paired musicians to create original works within two days.

Previous winning compositions had been acquired by major labels for top artists, some fetching millions in royalties and dominating music charts. For aspiring musicians, it served as the ultimate springboard - a single hit could launch a career, guaranteeing demand for future works.

Evelyn, however, remained indifferent. She'd only participated to fulfill Leonard's requirements.

She lacked both experience and ambition in composition.

Simply passing the orchestra's selection sufficed for her.

Isabella, conversely, seemed eager to collaborate.

Evelyn blinked innocently. "Why should I partner with you?"

"What do you mean?" Isabella snapped.

She'd assumed Evelyn's cello mastery and Leonard's endorsement made her the ideal partner.

She'd approached Evelyn first. Yet Evelyn appeared to be rejecting her.

Frustrated, Isabella demanded, "Cello and violin make perfect partners. You're seriously refusing?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"Perfect partners doesn't mean I have to choose you."

Then she stuck out her tongue playfully. "I'm not teaming up with you. Deal with it. Hah!"

Truthfully, Evelyn didn't want to handicap Isabella, knowing she wouldn't take the competition seriously. But Isabella misinterpreted her intentions.

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes as frustration overwhelmed her.

When Alexander Whitmore arrived, Isabella flung herself into his arms, sobbing dramatically.

"Alexander, did you see that? I tried being civil, but she refused to cooperate. She's utterly impossible!"
###Chapter 599

Isabella's fingers trembled as she reached for Alexander's sleeve, but he stepped back before she could make contact.

The fabric slipped through her desperate grasp like sand through an hourglass.

"Evelyn's participation should be voluntary," Alexander stated coldly, his jaw set. "You can't force someone into a team."

Isabella's lips parted in shock. "Force her?"

His gaze didn't waver. "Pressuring someone against their will is coercion. That's exactly what you're doing."

Frustration coiled tight in her chest.

It was always Evelyn. Everything Evelyn did was perfect in Alexander's eyes.

Her voice turned urgent. "When are you helping me end things with Dominic?"

After Alexander left with Evelyn last night, Isabella had no choice but to leave with Dominic.

She had dropped hints all evening, murmuring, "It's my birthday today. Would it kill him to get me a gift? Or at least a cake?"

Dominic had smirked down at her. "Cake? Sure. But first..."

His fingers brushed something metallic in his pocket.

"...I've always wondered—what do a woman's insides look like?"

The knife glinted under the streetlights.

Isabella's blood turned to ice.

Trapped in his car, she had curled into herself, praying he wouldn't act on his grotesque curiosity.

That night, nightmares of blood and viscera left her gasping awake.

If only Dominic would fixate on Evelyn instead.

Alexander's frown deepened. "I have no standing with the Powells. If you want out, negotiate with them yourself."

Their only connection was through Andrew—now gone.

He'd supported her education, but marriage was different. Intervening would overstep.

"What if you told them you've fallen for me?" Isabella blurted.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Are you out of your mind?"

"I'm married." The words were a blade. "You'd ruin your reputation."

Heat flooded her cheeks.

His phone rang—a merciful interruption—and he left with a clipped excuse.

Isabella stepped into the hallway, defeated.

"Ms. Morgan?"

She turned. A woman with sharp eyes approached. "You voted for me?"

"Vanessa Hart." The woman smiled. "And yes. But more importantly... I overheard your dilemma."

Isabella stiffened. "Eavesdropping?"

"Coincidence." Vanessa leaned closer. "But breaking your engagement isn't impossible. Especially if..." Her whisper sent a jolt through Isabella.

"Drug Alexander? Are you insane?"

Vanessa's smile turned razor-thin. "Burned bridges force accountability. Once compromised, a man like him won't abandon you."

Isabella's pulse raced.

"The Bennetts' moon celebration is coming. Dominic's family will attend—and so will Alexander."

Vanessa's nails dug into Isabella's arm. "Spike his drink there. The blame falls on the Bennetts. No one suspects you."

"Why help me?"

"Because I want you as his wife." Vanessa's eyes gleamed. "And I want Evelyn destroyed."

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat slumped in the music room, forehead pressed to her arms.

Leonard flicked her ear. "The competition's in weeks. Shouldn't you be composing?"

To outsiders, Leonard was intimidating. To her? A teddy bear in a grumpy disguise.

She groaned. "I've never written a full piece. Expecting genius now is like betting on lottery numbers."

Leonard snorted. "Nonsense. You know Natalie Riley?"

Evelyn shot upright. "The prodigy who sold out Vienna's Golden Hall?"

"My student. Couldn't compose at first either." Pride warmed his voice. "Now? Every performance is original."

He tapped her sheet music. "You're my student. You'll excel."

The competition only required a demo—perfection wasn't necessary.

For days, Evelyn drowned in classical melodies, scribbling notes whenever inspiration struck.

Slowly, the chaos in her mind began to harmonize.

Music, she realized, wasn't about perfection.

It was about catching those fleeting moments of magic before they slipped away.
###Chapter 600

Evelyn had silenced her phone while working and only noticed Claire's two missed calls after completing her composition.

"Claire, what's wrong?" she asked, hearing the urgency in her friend's voice.

"I'm finally free from bed rest! The Bennett family is hosting a celebration for Bella today and just sent me an invitation," Claire replied bitterly.

Evelyn frowned at Lucas's audacity. "After everything he put Claire through - snatching their newborn without warning - why would he deliberately send her this invitation? Is he trying to reopen old wounds?"

"Stay put! I'm coming right now!" Evelyn declared, spinning on her heel.

As she turned, a loose sheet of music fluttered from her sketchbook.

The paper drifted downward, caught by a breeze that carried it down the staircase.

Minutes later, Isabella Morgan happened upon the fallen sheet. Pausing mid-step, she bent to examine the handwritten notes. "What have we here?" she murmured, smoothing the crumpled edges.

Though the handwriting was hurried, the musical notations were clear - a composition draft with scribbled revisions, likely capturing a sudden burst of inspiration.

With her trained musical ear, Isabella began softly humming the melody.

By the final measure, her pulse quickened with unexpected excitement.

This was extraordinary!

The paper's creases suggested it had been carelessly discarded.

As a new orchestra member, she recognized this wasn't amateur work, yet couldn't place which musician might have created it.

Carefully folding the precious score, she tucked it into her purse for further study.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had left the concert hall and was hailing a cab when Dominic Powell appeared beside her.

Dominic kept his gaze lowered, masking his emotions. "Need a ride? I'm heading your way."

After ten unsuccessful minutes trying to flag a taxi in this quiet district, Evelyn still shook her head. "I'll manage."

His frown deepened. "You've been avoiding me lately. Not even answering my texts."

"I healed your injury. What more could you possibly want from me?" Evelyn countered coolly.

Dominic's expression darkened. "So that's how it is? You're just going to pretend our history doesn't exist?" His voice dropped. "And my jacket? Did you forget about that?"

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "The jacket? Alexander took it, promising to return it to you." A realization struck her. "Wait...he didn't?"

The thought amused her. "Is Alexander seriously holding a grudge over a jacket?"

She bit her tongue, knowing she couldn't reveal Alexander had tossed it.

Dominic misread her silence.

"If you fancy me, just say so. No need to keep my jacket like some lovesick schoolgirl clutching her crush's sweater." Evelyn rolled her eyes at his arrogance.

Noting her reaction, Dominic smirked. "Honestly, after you fixed my leg, I wouldn't mind getting more...personal." Just then, a taxi finally appeared in the distance.

Evelyn quickly waved it down. As the cab slowed, she shot Dominic an amused look. "Has anyone ever told you how painfully corny you are?" Before he could respond, she slipped into the taxi.

Dominic stood frozen. "Did she just...call me corny?"

His face paled in shock.

By the time he recovered, the taxi had disappeared. Nathaniel, his driver, kept his eyes firmly on the road, wishing he could unhear everything.

Dominic's hand suddenly gripped Nathaniel's shoulder. "Am I really that corny?" he demanded.

Nathaniel swallowed hard. "Mr. Powell, you're simply...authentic with Ms. Carter."

Leaning back, Dominic lit a cigarette, the flame reflecting in his stormy eyes. "Exactly. She doesn't appreciate sincerity. Instead, she mocks me."

A faint, dangerous smile played on his lips. "So disobedient."

Claire's first post-recovery meal was Sichuan hotpot.

The two friends enjoyed their girls' night without male company.

Claire had ordered the spiciest broth available, tears streaming from the heat. "Tomorrow's the custody hearing! I can't lose! Why should I?"

"That bastard stole my newborn without warning! Now he's throwing this grand Bennett family celebration? What's he trying to prove?"

Evelyn squeezed her friend's hand. "At least you'll see Bella tomorrow."

Claire viciously bit into a beef slice as if it were Lucas's flesh. "I'm not just seeing her - I'm taking my daughter home!"

"Just wait! Before I couldn't fight back because of my injury, but now? That bastard will learn what happens when you cross me!"

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at Bennett Manor with Alexander.

The Bennetts had spared no expense, inviting Cresthaven's elite.

As they exited the car, the midday sun blazed mercilessly. Alexander instinctively shielded Evelyn with his hand.

Their shared smile held private warmth until they spotted Ethan Caldwell and Vanessa Hart.

Vanessa had been clinging to Ethan's arm, but he abruptly pulled away upon seeing Evelyn, his expression turning icy.

Vanessa's face tightened before she deliberately eyed Evelyn's midsection. "Evelyn, shouldn't you be showing more at five months? That barely looks like three." Her tone dripped venom.

Evelyn's flowing dress concealed her subtle bump, her hair elegantly pinned with a single jeweled clip.

Ethan cleared his throat, but his warning glance at Vanessa came too late.

Recent rumors about Evelyn's baby being Ethan's had resurfaced, and nearby guests began whispering.

Alexander smoothly drew Evelyn closer. "Ethan, your wife seems unusually interested in my child. Perhaps focus on producing your own heir? I'd love to meet my grandnephew someday."

Ethan's mouth opened then closed. The insult was delivered so politely it took him a moment to process.
###Chapter 601

The server approached with a tray of champagne flutes, the golden liquid sparkling under the chandeliers.

Vanessa waved him away with a delicate gesture. "None for me, thank you. I'm expecting." She placed a protective hand over her stomach. "Perhaps some sparkling water with lime?"

A stunned silence fell over their group. All eyes immediately dropped to her midsection.

"Didn't Vanessa just lose a baby recently? She's pregnant again already? That's... remarkable."

Ethan looked like he'd been struck by lightning. His brow furrowed in confusion. "When did this happen? How could I not know?"

It had only been three months since the miscarriage. They'd barely been intimate since then - just a handful of times when Ethan had been drowning his sorrows in alcohol.

Vanessa stroked her belly lovingly, beaming up at Ethan. "I just got the news two days ago."

"I'm already ten weeks along! I suppose my body just knows how to hold onto a pregnancy." She squeezed Ethan's arm. "Darling, we're going to be parents! Isn't it wonderful?"

Ethan said nothing.

The announcement brought shock, not joy.

His gaze flickered to Evelyn, who stood stone-faced, showing no reaction to Vanessa's news.

A dark cloud passed over Ethan's features.

Alexander, ever the peacemaker, broke the tension with a chuckle. "Well now, Vanessa. Does this mean I'll be a great-uncle soon?"

Ethan's chest tightened painfully at the words.

Just then, a commotion erupted near the grand entrance.

Claire had arrived.

She'd come to the Bennett estate for her daughter's one-month celebration - and she'd brought her new boyfriend Julian, throwing down the gauntlet at Lucas. The whispers started the moment she walked in.

True to form, Lucas stormed in within minutes, his expression thunderous.

His icy glare could have frozen hell as it landed on Julian before he grabbed Claire's wrist and started dragging her away.

Julian moved to intervene but was immediately surrounded by Bennett security.

Lucas, flanked by his bodyguards, snarled at Julian. "Get this bastard off my property!"

Claire whirled on him. "Julian is my boyfriend! How dare you!"

"This is my house - I'll dare whatever I please." Lucas tightened his grip. "You're in my territory now, Claire. You should be more concerned about yourself!" With that, he hauled her away.

She struggled instinctively, but Lucas's jaw clenched. "Don't you want to see our daughter?"

At the mention of their child, Claire stilled.

The bodyguards efficiently escorted Julian out. Evelyn started forward but Alexander caught her arm. "Let them work it out privately."

Inside the private suite, Lucas locked the door with a decisive click.

Claire looked around expectantly. "Where is she?"

Lucas's voice was arctic. "Break things off with Julian, and you can have her back."

"Over my dead body!" Claire spat.

Lucas laughed humorlessly. "Really, Claire? What is he to you that you'd abandon your own child for him?" He stepped closer, eyes blazing. "What kind of mother does that make you?"

"A mother? If I were truly heartless, I never would have carried her to term!"

"Lucas, I carried her for nine months. Who the hell do you think you are, keeping her from me and making demands?"

"Julian cooks for me, takes care of me, prepares everything for the baby. He's been more of a father than you ever were!"

Lucas's eyes turned feral with rage.

"Anything he can do, I can do better, Claire. Have you ever considered you're stealing my right to be a father? That child is mine too. How can you just let some stranger play daddy?"

"How can you be so cruel? How can you just stop loving me?"

"I threw this party for her... for you. Look around - this is our wedding suite."

Claire froze.

For the first time, she noticed the room's decor. Rose petals covered every surface, just like the day they'd gotten married. The sweet fragrance filled the air.

But this time, the roses were his idea.

Lucas gripped her shoulders, his voice breaking. "Hate me if you must, but don't stop loving me. Don't leave me behind..."

He pulled her into a crushing embrace. "Claire, you don't really love Julian, do you? You're just using him to hurt me."

"You kept our baby because part of you still hoped for us, didn't you?"

"I've changed. Can't you come back to me?"

His voice cracked with a vulnerability she'd never heard before, making him sound like a lost child.

Claire clenched her fists, her mind reeling.

She'd never seen Lucas like this - raw, exposed. It left her speechless.

Before she could gather her thoughts, Lucas captured her lips in a searing kiss that stole her breath.

When she tried to push him away, he pinned her wrists against the door.

His tongue invaded her mouth with desperate intensity, igniting a fire that made her pulse race wildly.

"What are you— mmph! Let me go!" Her protest was muffled against his lips.

Lucas seemed deaf to her words.

Eyes closed, he poured every ounce of his longing into the kiss, as if trying to brand her with his love.

Even when Claire bit down hard enough to draw blood, he only held her tighter, breathing ragged with need.

"Come back to me, Claire. I can't survive without you."
###Chapter 602

Lucas's pulse hammered violently as he crushed Claire against his chest.

His fingers dug into her slender waist. With closed eyes, he captured her lips in a bruising kiss, savoring the familiar taste that still drove him wild.

After three years of marriage, he knew every curve, every sensitive spot of her body like the back of his hand. His touch traced deliberate patterns along her spine.

But Claire only felt suffocating despair.

"Lucas, don't make me despise you!" She wrenched free and delivered a stinging slap across his face.

The sharp crack shattered the tense silence between them.

"Even divorced, you still crave me? How pathetic!" Tears burned in Claire's eyes. "Should I hire escorts for you? If you won't return Bella, we'll settle this in court! Your touch makes my skin crawl!"

She spun on her heel and stormed out, the door slamming behind her. Lucas stood frozen, watching her retreat with leaden steps.

000

"Court?"

"Is this really where we've ended up?"

A bitter smile twisted Lucas's lips as anguish flooded his chest.

Outside, Evelyn rushed to Claire's side, taking in her red-rimmed eyes.

"Did you see her?"

Claire shook her head, biting her quivering lip.

Evelyn recognized that shattered expression - she'd worn it herself too many times.

She wrapped a comforting arm around Claire's shoulders. "Let's get you some air."

Julian paced like a caged tiger outside the Bennett estate when he spotted Claire's tear-streaked face.

"That bastard!" Claire choked out. "All I wanted was to see my daughter! He's using her to force me to leave you!"

Julian staggered back as if struck.

He'd never imagined his presence in Claire's life would cost her access to her child.

The realization hit him like a physical blow. "This is my fault."

"I failed to protect the woman I love. Now she's suffering because of me."

His hands clenched into white-knuckled fists, veins standing out along his forearms as he glared at the mansion.

With Claire's emotions in tatters, Evelyn guided her into the car to compose herself.

Julian excused himself to buy water - then marched straight for the Bennett estate.

When he found Lucas, he grabbed him by the collar and slammed his fist into that arrogant face.

"Was making her cry your grand plan?" Julian snarled. "Is this how you love someone? By breaking them? What kind of man does that?"

Lucas reeled from the unexpected blow. Regaining balance, he retaliated with a vicious right hook.

"You're just her kept boy, living off Claire's money. What would you know about love?"

"Without her wealth, you'd be nothing. If she were penniless, would you still cling to her?"

Julian stood his ground. "In a heartbeat! I love her, not her bank account! I'd love her if she lived in a cardboard box!"

Lucas's laugh dripped with contempt.

"Without Claire paying off your family's debts, you'd be rotting in some gutter."

"Love? You're a gold-digger too deluded to admit it. Tell me - do you even know where your affection ends and your greed begins?" Lucas's words were calculated to eviscerate. "I've tolerated you because you're beneath my notice. Frankly, I don't consider you a man at all."

Julian's chest heaved with barely contained fury.

"You look down on me from your gilded tower," he shot back. "Everything was handed to you - you've never had to fight for anything in your life."

"Your so-called superiority is an accident of birth. The only difference between us is your head start."

"Your arrogance blinded you, Lucas. That's why you lost her."

"In love, we stand as equals. Claire left you because she saw your true colors. She chose me."

"Can't stomach being bested by someone you consider inferior? Tell me - do you actually love her? Or is this just your bruised ego refusing to lose?"

Lucas blinked, startled by Julian's unexpected eloquence. Each barb struck deeper than the last.

The air between them crackled with hostility.

Just as fists might fly again, Alexander materialized between them.

He positioned himself in front of Lucas. "Julian, you should go."

Lucas bristled. "Alexander! You're supposed to be my friend!"

Alexander remained calm. "Evelyn sees him as family. That makes him off-limits."

Julian wiped blood from his split lip and nodded at Alexander before turning away.

Lucas's expression darkened.

"If I can't win her back, I'm moving in with you and Evelyn," Lucas threatened petulantly. "I'll be your permanent third wheel."

Alexander arched an eyebrow. "Don't blame me for your failed marriage. Kidnapping her child? Really? Have you completely lost your mind?"

"While you were playing tyrant, Julian was actually caring for her. Feeding her. Supporting her. If you were her, who would you choose?"

Frustrated, Lucas drove his fist into the wall.

"I've never had to chase a woman before! How was I supposed to know threats would backfire?"

In a foul mood, Lucas dragged Alexander out for drinks.

Midway through their session, Isabella appeared.

"Alexander, I don't know anyone here. Mind if I join you?"

When a server brought fresh glasses, Isabella quickly poured whiskey into Alexander's tumbler. As the men talked, she grew increasingly anxious watching Alexander ignore his drink.

Lucas thrust his glass toward her. "Why only serve him? What am I, invisible?"

Isabella curled her fingers nervously. "Lucas, you've had enough. It's not healthy."

"Since when do you—"

His words cut off as he suddenly slumped forward, unconscious.

Alexander frowned and signaled for staff to carry Lucas to a couch.

Meanwhile, Isabella's gaze kept returning to Alexander's untouched drink.

She couldn't push too obviously - he'd see right through her.

As Alexander prepared to leave, she saw her chance.

"Such a waste," she murmured, reaching for his glass. "Let me finish it for you."

Just as the rim touched her lips, Alexander snatched it away. "You have your own drink!"

In one swift motion, he downed the contents.

Her eyes widened slightly as he drained the glass.
###Chapter 603

The moment Alexander swallowed the wine, Evelyn felt a thrill of anticipation shoot through her.

Her pulse quickened as she pretended nonchalance, refilling her own glass and draining it in one gulp.

"This vintage is quite exceptional. Care for another?" Evelyn asked with practiced ease.

The wine had been specially prepared with Vanessa's assistance. Though inexperienced in such matters, Evelyn reasoned the more they drank, the better her chances would be.

"No thank you!" Alexander waved dismissively, setting down his glass with deliberate care before turning toward the exit.

His thoughts raced. "Claire went to Willowbrook Apartments ages ago. What could possibly be taking so long?" He needed to find her immediately.

Noticing his departure, Evelyn swiftly moved to follow him.

After several paces, Alexander spun around, irritation flashing in his steel-gray eyes. "Why are you shadowing me?"

Evelyn lowered her lashes, perfecting an innocent expression. "I...I told you, I don't know anyone here. You're my only familiar face. If I'm not with you, who else should I accompany?"

Alexander's brow furrowed as he considered this.

The Morgan family had fallen from grace years ago, making invitations to such elite gatherings rare for Isabella.

She'd only received entry because Lucas Bennett was throwing this extravagant banquet for Claire Dawson, distributing invitations like confetti to anyone who crossed his path.

"Since you're clearly uncomfortable, I'll have Simon arrange your ride home," Alexander stated firmly, reaching for his phone.

Just as his fingers brushed the device, a wave of dizziness crashed over him. The grand ballroom seemed to tilt dangerously as he staggered.

"Alexander! Are you alright?" Evelyn's voice held just the right mix of concern and alarm.

This was the moment she'd been waiting for.

She immediately steadied him, slipping her arm through his. "Too much champagne? Let me help you to the lounge."

With her cheeks flushed becomingly and lips slightly parted, she made a tempting picture - one most men would find difficult to resist.

Alexander's instincts screamed warning. Since taking over Titan Capital Group, he'd faced countless schemes, but this sensation was different.

Within seconds, he recognized the truth - this wasn't mere intoxication.

Something primal stirred within him - a ravenous hunger demanding immediate satisfaction.

His expression darkened with dawning comprehension.

With sudden violence, he shoved her away. "Did you drug me?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Alexander! What a horrible accusation! Drug you with what?"

Yet even as she spoke, she felt it too.

A burning heat pooled low in her abdomen, her knees weakening dangerously.

Playing the victim perfectly, she swayed toward him, voice trembling. "Alexander...I don't feel well at all."

Internally, she applauded Vanessa's handiwork. "The little minx outdid herself. I only had a sip, but I'm burning up. Alexander drank a full glass - he must be suffering far worse."

Alexander studied Evelyn's feverish expression, torn between suspicion and reluctant concern.

"She seems genuinely affected...but the timing is too convenient to be coincidence."

As Evelyn's breathing grew more labored, Alexander found himself gripping her arm tighter than intended, half-dragging her toward the nearest private room to call for medical assistance.

But then Evelyn made her bold move - throwing her arms around his neck and pressing her body flush against his.

Alexander froze, his entire frame going rigid.

At that precise moment, Vanessa and Ethan Caldwell turned the corner.

Ethan's face darkened instantly at the intimate scene.

"First he steals the woman I love, now he can't even remain faithful?" he thought bitterly.

Vanessa gasped dramatically, "Alexander! You two—"

Ethan clamped a hand over her mouth, hissing, "Not another word!"

Desperation clawed at him. He wanted Evelyn for himself, but the thought of Claire discovering her husband's infidelity turned his stomach. Claire was five months pregnant - the last thing she needed was this kind of stress.

"Keep your mouth shut!" Ethan repeated through gritted teeth.

Vanessa nodded obediently, and Ethan released her.

He shot Alexander one last glare before dragging Vanessa away. Alexander, fighting the drug's effects, barely registered their departure.

His focus narrowed to Evelyn, who was now rubbing against him like a cat in heat. "Alexander, I feel so strange...help me..." she murmured, fingers plucking at her neckline.

In truth, Evelyn remained relatively clear-headed - the wine giving her only a pleasant buzz. Her performance was pure theater. But Alexander was genuinely struggling.

The drug hit him with unexpected force, muddling his thoughts. He dug his nails into his palm, using the pain to maintain focus.

"Isabella, listen carefully. You need to wait in the lounge while I call an ambulance," he ground out.

But Evelyn clung tighter, widening her eyes. "An ambulance? Whatever for? I just feel...warm. Don't you feel it too, Alexander?" Her gaze dropped meaningfully. "There's no need for doctors when we could help each other..."

"Enough!" Alexander roared, shoving her away violently.

The pieces were falling into place with terrible clarity.

He stared at her, disgust warring with disappointment. "This is beyond unacceptable!"

Alexander had always shown Isabella leniency out of respect for Andrew, but this crossed every line.

If he lost control now, how could he ever face Claire again?

"Isabella, you're Andrew's sister. I've tolerated much out of respect for his memory, but using that against me? Have you no shame?"

His voice turned icy. "Homewrecking isn't a virtue. You're young, beautiful, an accomplished violinist - must you fixate on another woman's husband?"

Evelyn's cheeks burned with humiliation.

Tears welled in her eyes as she protested, "Alexander! How can you say such things? I would never—"

She clung stubbornly to her facade of innocence even as the drug's effects made her movements increasingly erratic.

Just as she reached for him again, a sharp crack echoed through the hallway.

Claire stood there, her palm stinging from the force of her slap.
###Chapter 604

After Julian dropped Claire off at home, Evelyn returned to find Alexander.

The office was empty, and Evelyn assumed he'd already left. Just as she reached for her phone, she spotted Alexander and Isabella together.

Evelyn arrived at the perfect moment, catching Alexander's firm words to Isabella.

She was stunned by his resolve—she hadn't expected him to stand his ground so fiercely.

When she saw Isabella shamelessly inching closer to Alexander, she couldn't hold back. With a sharp motion, she slapped Isabella hard across the face.

The sting radiated through Isabella's cheek, leaving her momentarily frozen.

She never imagined Evelyn would strike her—and with such force.

The slap extinguished the fire of her earlier excitement, leaving her dazed.

Tears welled in her eyes as she glared at Evelyn. "How dare you hit me?"

"Enough with your schemes," Evelyn shot back, her voice icy. "Alexander owes your brother a favor, not me. I won't tolerate you seducing my husband. If I don't hit you, who will?"

She rushed to Alexander’s side, concern etching her face. "Are you okay?" she asked, noticing the sweat beading on his forehead.

He looked pale, clearly struggling.

Relief washed over Alexander when he saw Evelyn. He took her hand, surrendering to her presence.

"Take me home," he murmured.

Evelyn nodded, leading him out.

Isabella watched them leave, frustration boiling inside her. She stomped her foot, the weight of her failure crushing her.

Alexander will never trust me now. How can I fix this?

Why did Evelyn have to show up? Everything was going perfectly!

She bit her lip, restless energy consuming her.

Desperate to regain control, she rushed to the restroom and splashed cold water on her face, but it did nothing to calm her.

She felt helpless—like she was digging her own grave.

Meanwhile, Dominic wandered around Whitmore Manor, hoping to catch a glimpse of Evelyn.

Disappointed, he turned to leave when suddenly, a woman burst out of the restroom.

Without warning, she wrapped her arms around his waist and pressed her lips to his.

Dominic’s expression darkened instantly.

He couldn’t believe it—some random woman had just assaulted him. He nearly shoved her away.

Who the hell does she think she is?

When he recognized Isabella, his fury flared.

"You bitch!" he snarled, grabbing her throat. "That was my first kiss!"

His grip tightened, his eyes burning with rage. The air turned icy, and Isabella felt true fear.

She gasped, clawing at his hand. "Dominic, you're choking me!"

His voice was deadly. "And? You think you can just kiss me and walk away? You deserve worse."

Her heart pounded.

What’s his problem? It was just a kiss!

She forced a weak protest. "I’m your fiancée, Dominic. A kiss isn’t a crime."

His lips curled in disgust. "You think you can dictate what I do?"

The hallway felt suffocating as he pinned her against the wall, her feet barely touching the ground.

Just then, a voice cut through the tension.

"Dominic, flirting with your fiancée?"

Dominic turned sharply to see his brother, Sebastian, approaching.

His grip didn’t loosen. "This isn’t flirting. She’s nothing."

Sebastian smirked. "Looked cozy to me. Should I tell Father to move the wedding up?"

Dominic’s glare sharpened. "Mind your own business."

Sebastian shrugged, unfazed. "You’re my brother. It’s my job to meddle."

He nodded at Isabella. "Ms. Morgan, long time no see."

Recognition flickered in Isabella’s mind. She had met the Powell brothers years ago, but the memories were hazy.

If not for Sebastian’s arrival, she might have ended up a ghost in Dominic’s grip.

She clutched her throat, nodding weakly.

Dominic scoffed and stormed off, leaving her alone.

Sebastian lingered, studying her. "Are you alright? Need a doctor?"

She shook her head quickly.

He smiled, his demeanor warm. "No need to be nervous. Dominic and I are... different."

"If he’s ever rude, let me know. I’ll handle him."

Isabella was taken aback by his kindness.

The brothers were nothing alike—Sebastian, with his gold-rimmed glasses and calm presence, was the opposite of Dominic’s volatility.

Suddenly, the drug’s effects hit her like a wave. Her legs trembled, and she stumbled.

Sebastian caught her. "Careful!"

"Th-thank you," she stammered, but her vision blurred.

Before she could react, she collapsed into his arms.

"Isabella?"

Sebastian shook her gently, noting her flushed cheeks and feverish skin.

She was clearly drugged.
###Chapter 605

The dim glow of the bedside lamp cast long shadows across the room as Evelyn carefully lowered Alexander onto the mattress.

"Let me get you some water," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Her hands trembled slightly as she turned away. This was unfamiliar territory, and uncertainty coiled in her stomach.

Before she could take a step, Alexander's fingers closed around her wrist with surprising strength, yanking her backward.

Evelyn gasped as she tumbled into his scorching embrace. The heat radiating from his body made her pulse leap wildly.

Her dark tresses spilled over them like silk, brushing against Alexander's flushed cheeks in silent temptation.

With a rough tug, Alexander tore off his tie, the fabric whispering against his collar before hitting the floor. Restraint shattered.

He caged her beneath him, capturing her lips in a desperate kiss that tasted like salvation.

It felt like drowning in sunlight after years of darkness. Evelyn's cool touch only fueled Alexander's burning need.

"Evelyn..." His voice was rough as gravel as he framed her face with trembling hands.

His teeth grazed her lower lip, the possessive gesture sending shivers down her spine.

"We shouldn't—" Evelyn's protest died against his mouth as Alexander kissed her deeper.

Rational thought evaporated. Every nerve ending screamed for her. His hands slid down to her waist, lips trailing fire along her collarbone.

Evelyn's heart hammered against her ribs. "Alexander! I'm five months pregnant—this could hurt the baby!"

The words barely registered through his haze until his palm brushed the gentle swell of her abdomen.

Reality crashed over him like ice water. Alexander jerked back as if electrocuted, digging his nails into his thigh to ground himself.

"Are you alright?" His voice cracked with concern as he searched Evelyn's face.

Tears shimmered in her wide eyes, her porcelain skin flushed with distress.

"You terrified me," she whispered, voice trembling. "I thought you'd—"

"God, I'm sorry." Alexander raked a hand through his hair, the feverish intensity evaporating.

He couldn't trust himself near her. Not like this.

"I need a minute." He practically bolted to the bathroom.

The sound of running water soon mingled with muffled curses behind the closed door.

Isabella woke to sunlight stabbing her eyelids. The unfamiliar plush bedding confused her—this wasn't her apartment.

She sat up too quickly, the room spinning. Fragmented memories surfaced—a drugged drink, blurred faces...

Her stomach dropped when she spotted her torn dress discarded on the floor. The missing underwear made her blood run cold.

The rumpled sheets told their own story. A dark stain on the linen confirmed her worst fears.

Three empty condom boxes on the nightstand mocked her.

Her fingers hovered over her phone's emergency dial pad when a knock shattered the silence.

The door opened to reveal a man in a crisp black shirt, gold glasses glinting in the sunlight.

Sebastian Powell.

Isabella's breath hitched. "You...it was you?"

Her mind reeled. Sebastian was Dominic's older brother!

"How could you?" Her voice cracked. "I'm engaged to your brother!"

Her thumb still rested on the call button, but logic prevailed—this scandal would destroy her. Dominic would kill her.

Sebastian closed the distance in three strides, pulling her against his chest.

"You came to me willingly last night," he murmured against her neck, his breath hot.

His hands traced familiar paths along her body, reigniting sparks of memory.

Isabella slapped him hard. "Stay away! You knew exactly who I was!"

"You don't love him." Sebastian caught her wrist.

"That doesn't excuse this!"

His grip tightened. "Remember when you were five? Your doll fell in our pond. I dove in to save it."

The unexpected memory stilled her. "That was you?"

"I've wanted you since that day." His lips brushed her ear. "The engagement was my idea—Father wanted to pawn you off on Dominic."

Isabella recoiled. "You're marrying Victoria Clarke next month!"

"A political match." Sebastian captured her lips. "You're the only woman I've ever wanted."

His hands slid under the sheets, proving just how much.
###Chapter 606

Alexander stirred awake as the last traces of medication faded from his system.

He massaged his temples, his gaze drifting to Evelyn beside him. Unable to resist, he leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to her cheek.

Ever since Evelyn had joined the orchestra, her time at home had dwindled to mere weekends—just a handful of days each month.

The thought tightened his chest. He pulled her closer, wrapping his arms around her.

Evelyn, still half-asleep, felt herself being drawn into warmth. She blinked groggily, only for Alexander’s lips to capture hers the next second.

"Mmm—"

Her drowsy mind registered one thought: That medicine was stronger than I thought.

"Alexander, calm down! Go take another shower!" she protested, voice thick with sleep.

He chuckled, releasing her. His eyes lingered on her flushed lips. "Evelyn, I’m perfectly fine. I just wanted to kiss you."

Heat flooded her cheeks. She yanked the blanket up, attempting to hide.

"I just woke up," she mumbled, still disoriented.

Alexander found her unbearably adorable like this.

Cupping her face, he leaned in until their breaths mingled. "Evelyn, when will you come home for good?"

At five months pregnant, her belly would soon make even playing the cello difficult.

"After the composition contest," she said.

Leonard had insisted she participate, and lately, composing had ignited a spark in her. Her hand drifted to her stomach.

By the contest’s end, she’d be six months along—she’d need to be more careful.

A sudden flutter made her bolt upright.

"Alexander! The baby just kicked!"

He stilled, then pressed his ear to her belly. "Let me listen."

Evelyn laughed. "He can’t talk yet. What are you expecting to hear?"

"Your stomach growling. Are you hungry? I’ll make breakfast."

She rolled her eyes, bundling herself tighter in the blanket. Alexander tapped her nose affectionately before slipping out of bed.

With nothing planned for the weekend, Evelyn idly uploaded a recent composition to her Twitter. She rarely used the platform—her few dozen followers meant the post garnered little attention.

No matter. It was just for her own records.

She replayed the melody, satisfaction curling in her chest. The notes sparked fresh inspiration, and she quickly jotted them down.

Meanwhile, at a sunlit café, renowned cellist Natalie Riley sipped coffee across from her mentor, Leonard Herty.

When Leonard mentioned taking on a new protégé, Natalie’s interest piqued.

Leonard never took students.

"What’s so special about her?" Natalie asked.

Leonard smirked. "She’s a quick learner. Far more talented than you were at her age."

Natalie scoffed. "You’re joking."

"Believe what you want. Her compositions? Brilliant. Mark my words—she’ll surpass you."

Natalie’s brows shot up. "Really? What’s her Twitter? I need to see this."

Every orchestra member had one, including Evelyn, though hers had been set up at Leonard’s insistence.

Leonard took a leisurely sip. "Look up ‘Sweet Savage.’"

Natalie blinked. "Bold name for a girl."

"It’s just a handle. You kids love your dramatics."

Natalie found the account instantly. A recently posted composition caught her eye.

The moment she pressed play, the synthesized melody stunned her.

Leonard grinned as the music floated between them. "Well? Convinced?"

Natalie sniffed. "It’s decent. Not quite my level."

Yet her fingers betrayed her, retweeting it with a comment: [My mentor’s newest student. / thumbs up]

As a prodigy who’d performed at Vienna’s Golden Hall by twenty, Natalie boasted millions of followers. Fans worshipped her as a celestial talent—her rare posts sent shockwaves through the music world.

So when the famously aloof Natalie endorsed an unknown account with twelve followers? Chaos erupted.

Curiosity drove hordes to "Sweet Savage’s" profile. They expected a rising star, not this obscure handle.

Within hours, Evelyn’s followers exploded from twelve to over 200,000.

Oblivious, she enjoyed lunch at home, her phone silenced.

Elsewhere, Vanessa Hart sat across from a seething Isabella Morgan.

The second Vanessa settled into her chair, Isabella hurled a cup of coffee straight into her face.

"This is all your fault!" Isabella snarled, trembling with rage.

Without Vanessa’s poisonous advice, she’d never have taken that irreversible step.

She’d never have lost everything overnight—left with no recourse but to choke down her humiliation.

Coffee dripped from Vanessa’s face onto her ruined blouse. Her expression darkened.

Without hesitation, she snatched a cup from the table and flung it back.

"Who do you think you are? The Morgans are finished. You’re just Alexander’s charity case—unwanted, worthless. I’m Ethan’s wife. You dare lay a hand on me?"
###Chapter 607

Isabella gasped, her eyes brimming with unshed tears as she glared at Vanessa.

"You think you're special because you married Alexander? The Whitmore family is still controlled by Harold, and in the Hayes family, you're nothing but an illegitimate child who can't even show your face in public! What right do you have to act so high and mighty? You just seduced your way into his bed and forced him to marry you."

"You..." Vanessa trembled violently, one hand instinctively cradling her stomach, terrified for her unborn baby.

Vanessa quickly steadied herself; she hadn't come here to engage in petty arguments.

"Ms. Morgan, did you invite me here just to quarrel? Since our plan failed, we should focus on damage control!" Hearing this, Isabella visibly calmed down.

"Alexander must despise me now; he probably never wants to see me again. What else can I possibly do?"

Vanessa smirked. "That's simple. I can create the opportunity, but it's up to you to take advantage of it."

Isabella clenched her fists. "Drugging him again? That's despicable."

She secretly loathed such underhanded tactics. What was the point of controlling a man through chemicals?

Besides, Isabella just couldn't bear Alexander ignoring her while showering all his attention on Evelyn.

She simply wanted Alexander to notice her again, to care about her existence.

Her feelings for Alexander were a toxic cocktail of resentment and longing. Andrew, her brother, had died because of Alexander, yet he'd moved on, married and started a family, completely forgetting about her - his savior's sister. The bitterness consumed her.

"I just want Alexander to pay attention to me again!" Isabella blurted out.

Vanessa's lips curled into a knowing smile. "I want to make Evelyn suffer. Once cracks appear in their marriage, Alexander will naturally turn to you."

Isabella looked skeptical.

Just then, her phone buzzed.

Glancing at the caller ID, she immediately declined the call.

After their meeting, Isabella took a cab back to the symphony hall.

Exhausted beyond measure, she grabbed a silk nightgown and headed for the shower.

When she emerged, a man lounged on her bed.

Isabella paled. "You... How did you get in here?"

Sebastian, who had just entered her room, held the bra she'd dropped upon arrival. The gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose gave him an air of cultured menace that set Isabella's nerves on edge.

He moved closer, his large hand encircling her wrist as he pulled her against his chest.

"Isabella, why did you ignore my call?"

His touch made her skin crawl, but Sebastian seemed to revel in it, burying his face in the crook of her neck.

Isabella stiffened. "Sebastian, what are you doing here?"

"I live next to the symphony hall, so I just climbed the wall. Your dorm lock is child's play. Did you forget the Powells'... particular skills?" Sebastian chuckled darkly. "I just wanted to surprise you."

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes.

She'd thought that terrible night was the end, never imagining Sebastian would continue harassing her.

Only Alexander could help her now, but she couldn't possibly tell him about this.

"Sebastian, what do you want? You're engaged to Victoria Clarke. If she finds out you're fooling around... what would she think?"

Sebastian tightened his grip. "She won't find out! Isabella, I want you. Ever since that night, I haven't been able to get you out of my mind. Every second, I think about you. I need you."

His lips crashed against hers.

Isabella clutched at his shirt, trying to push him away, but her efforts were futile.

This was the symphony dormitory - any noise would alert the neighbors. Tears spilled down her cheeks.

"Isabella, don't cry," Sebastian murmured, licking the tears from her face. "I'll be gentle."

Suddenly, Isabella asked, "Sebastian, did you kill Vincent White?"

She reasoned: "Sebastian claims to have loved me for years. If true, he must have been watching me. That night, Vincent tried to assault me - Sebastian had motive."

Sebastian looked genuinely confused. "Vincent White? Who's that?"

Isabella froze.

"If Sebastian doesn't know Vincent... then who killed him?"

Before she could probe further, Sebastian's gaze turned predatory. He tore open his shirt and shoved her onto the bed.

A sharp cry escaped Isabella's lips.

Someone passed by her door, the sound unmistakable in the silent hallway. A concerned knock followed. "Isabella? Are you okay? Did you fall?"

Her heart hammered. "N-no, I'm fine. Just bumped into something."

"Alright, be careful."

Isabella swallowed hard, pushing against Sebastian's chest.

But he held her tighter, his hungry gaze devouring her. "Isabella, you're irresistible."

Disgust churned in her stomach.

Suppressing her revulsion, she challenged: "Sebastian, you claim to love me, but you only want to use me. Your 'love' is just empty words."

"How can you say that? Don't you believe how much I care for you?" Sebastian paused in his assault.

Isabella closed her eyes. "Prove it."

"What do you want me to do?"

"Your brother Dominic nearly strangled me that day."

Sebastian smirked. "Consider it done. He'll pay."

"It's late. You should go! Be careful leaving - don't get caught!"

Sebastian frowned, clearly unsatisfied. "Isabella, I'm not finished... Can't we continue?"

Isabella shook her head. "You were too rough last time. I can't take it."

Reluctantly, Sebastian released her.

He cupped her face, kissing her swollen lips possessively before finally leaving.

The moment the door closed, Isabella rushed to lock it.

She ran to the bathroom, scrubbing her mouth under running water until her lips burned. Then she stepped into the shower, scouring her skin raw.

When she finally emerged, dazed and trembling, she tore the contaminated sheets from her bed.

Collapsing to the floor, Isabella buried her face in her hands and wept uncontrollably.
###Chapter 608

The afternoon sun cast long shadows when Evelyn received the summons from Whitmore Manor. Harold Whitmore demanded her presence immediately.

Alexander was away at Titan Capital Group, immersed in business negotiations when the call came. With no other choice, Evelyn went alone.

Upon arrival, she found Harold in the study, moving chess pieces with deliberate precision. His sharp gaze immediately dropped to her midsection as she entered.

"Harold, what did you need to discuss?"

"You're five months along, correct? Why isn't your pregnancy showing more prominently?"

Evelyn's flowing dress concealed her gentle curves. Her naturally slender frame - willowy arms and delicate ankles - betrayed none of the typical signs of pregnancy.

At first glance, one might not even guess she carried a child.

Vanessa, barely two months pregnant, appeared nearly as unchanged as Evelyn.

Evelyn's hand drifted protectively to her abdomen. "Perhaps my metabolism hides it well."

Harold's piercing stare intensified. "Is it truly your metabolism...or miscalculated timing?"

His eyes raked over her form again, voice turning glacial.

"Speak plainly - is this child Ethan's?"

The implication struck like a physical blow. Evelyn had been Ethan's captive for weeks. Who knew what might have occurred during that time?

Then came her pregnancy announcement, now this barely visible bump - the dots connected themselves in Harold's suspicious mind.

Evelyn's lips parted in disbelief. She met Harold's gaze unflinchingly.

"Harold, from anyone else I'd dismiss such nonsense."

"But you? How could you entertain such vile thoughts? This is Alexander's child beyond any doubt. Ethan and I share nothing but mutual contempt. What exactly are you accusing me of?"

Harold's brow furrowed. "Yet Ethan boasts to everyone the child is his..."

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "And you take his word over mine? As patriarch, you let Ethan spread these lies while favoring his branch? Alexander is your son too! If you doubt me, fine! But do you doubt him as well?"

Without waiting for response, Evelyn turned on her heel, ignoring Harold's thunderous expression.

No woman could remain composed when her integrity and child's parentage were questioned so brazenly.

She nearly called him a deluded old fool to his face.

In the hallway, she collided with Ethan.

His face brightened. "Evelyn! When did you arrive at the manor?"

Her expression could have frozen lava. "Since when do I report my movements to you?"

Ethan blinked at her venom. His gaze flicked toward the study. "What did Grandfather want?"

"Ask him yourself!"

As she moved to leave, Ethan reached for her arm.

Evelyn reacted violently, shoving him away with surprising strength.

The commotion drew the attention of the assembled Whitmore relatives.

Sophia intervened. "Goodness! Evelyn, what's upset you so?"

Harold emerged from the study at the disturbance.

Evelyn's glacial stare swept the gathering. "Perfect timing. Let me make something abundantly clear."

She placed both hands over her womb. "This child is Alexander's - incontrovertibly. Should I hear one more whisper otherwise..."

Snatching up a nearby Ming vase, she smashed it violently at their feet.

The priceless artifact exploded into shards that skittered across marble tiles.

"Consider this their fate."

The room froze in stunned silence.

Sophia sighed. "Pregnancy hormones, clearly. She came here spoiling for a fight."

Ethan's face cycled through shades of pale and crimson. That final act had been meant for him alone - a visceral warning.

Evelyn departed without backward glance.

Before she'd cleared the room, Eleanor's shrill voice pierced the air.

"Such audacity! A mere bride presuming to throw tantrums in Whitmore Manor? With Harold still breathing? The disrespect!"

Vanessa eagerly fanned the flames. "My apologies for failing to teach her proper decorum. Please forgive my sister's outburst."

Their tag-team theatrics met with silent, amused observation from the others.

Evelyn turned slowly, taking their measure.

Alexander had been exiled for years. These so-called kin were vipers in silk.

His standing in the Whitmore hierarchy mirrored her former position in the Hawthorne household.

The realization ached like an old wound.

She pulled out her phone, fingers flying.

[My love, when our baby comes, we'll be three. This child and I will adore you beyond measure!]

Alexander had just concluded his board meeting.

The message kindled warmth in his chest. Amidst corporate battles, such tenderness from his wife was rare sunlight.

Simon approached quietly. "Sir, Mrs. Whitmore was summoned to the manor today by your father."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Explain."

"The staff reported she shattered an antique vase after warning them against questioning the child's paternity."

Alexander's fist clenched. "I knew Father suspected...Could it be..."

He barked orders. "To the manor. Now."

Dinner service was underway when Alexander arrived, his presence dropping the temperature ten degrees.

Servants shrank from his glacial demeanor.

"Mr. Whitmore! Shall we set a place for you—"

"Unnecessary." His gaze found Harold. "I understand you summoned my wife today?"

Eleanor bristled. "Alexander! That tone with your father? After all his years—"

Alexander's laugh held no mirth. "An elder? Then address me directly. Bullying my wife in my absence - what manner of man does that?"

Vincent attempted deflection. "Who's bullying anyone? Your father merely wished to converse. Or does she report every pillow talk to you?"

Alexander's eyes narrowed to slits. "You dare speak to me? Perhaps focus on controlling your own son first."

"Letting Ethan spread his filthy rumors unchecked - does the Whitmore name mean nothing to you?"

Alexander sank into an armchair, finger stabbing toward Ethan. "Fetch the family disciplinary ledger!"
###Chapter 609

Alexander's expression darkened. "We're all here for a peaceful family dinner. Why must we resort to punishment?"

Vincent smirked, casting a sideways glance at Alexander. "What's the matter? As head of the Whitmore family, don't I have the right to discipline my own nephew for tarnishing our reputation?"

"You..."

Eleanor turned pleading eyes to Harold, hoping he might intervene since Ethan had practically been raised under his supervision. Losing patience, Alexander turned to the frozen servants. "Why are you standing there? Must I do this myself?"

"Harold! Alexander's going to punish Ethan! Please say something!" Eleanor dropped her fork in panic.

Harold opened his mouth to speak when Alexander's icy glare silenced him.

Rumors had spread like wildfire these past months. Harold had initially hoped to ignore them.

But during a recent chess game with an old friend, the awkward topic arose, prompting his call to Evelyn.

To Harold's surprise, Alexander's devotion to his wife made him seize...

Harold couldn't show favoritism here.

It would undermine Alexander's authority as family head.

Harold frowned. "Ethan was indeed in the wrong."

"Alexander's decision to invoke family discipline is justified."

"Father!"

"Grandfather!"

Ethan's parents were frantic as servants retrieved the barbed whip.

By family law, Ethan faced at least twenty lashes.

Under everyone's watchful eyes, Ethan was led from the dining table for punishment. After just two strikes, he grimaced in pain, his white shirt already torn.

Vanessa rushed to Alexander's side.

"Alexander, have mercy! Ethan's health is delicate—this punishment could cause lasting harm!" Alexander remained unmoved.

Ethan had long been on his disciplinary list, only shielded by Eleanor or Harold.

The rumors that had quieted recently...

Resurfaced at the baby's one-month celebration, gaining momentum again—all because of Ethan's mischief.

Evelyn, burdened with false accusations, bore the brunt of public scrutiny.

If Alexander didn't act, their unborn child would suffer alongside Evelyn.

After ten lashes, Ethan collapsed, face ashen.

Vanessa clung to Alexander's sleeve pleadingly, a sly glint flashing in her eyes.

She discreetly slipped something into his pocket.

With the whipping concluded, Alexander's anger dissipated.

Eleanor rushed to help Ethan up, concern etched on her face.

Alexander flicked imaginary dust from his suit as he rose from the sofa.

Approaching the dining table, he calmly stated, "We were having dinner, weren't we? Please, be seated."

He accepted the fork and bowl from servants with measured grace.

The others were too tense to eat, but the second and third branch members, wary of Alexander, forced polite smiles and sat.

Vincent broke the awkward silence. "Father, we'll skip dinner. Ethan..."

Harold bellowed, "Don't be dramatic!"

"A few lashes won't kill him! The Whitmores have no place for weak men!"

Caught between staying and leaving, the family members hesitated.

Alexander himself served Harold soup. "Father, enjoy your soup."

The scene was bizarre—minutes ago they'd been at odds, now appearing reconciled.

The family struggled to comprehend the shifting dynamics.

Harold accepted the soup with apparent respect, creating an illusion of fatherly benevolence and filial devotion.

"Your wife's pregnancy is challenging. I still have your mother's gold necklace. I'll have it made into jewelry for her," Harold offered.

Alexander merely smiled. "Fine."

Everyone knew Alexander's mother was a taboo subject in the Whitmore family.

She'd died shortly after his birth, with outsiders believing it was childbirth complications.

But the family knew the truth—she'd committed suicide.

Not long after Alexander's birth, she'd slit her wrists quietly. When found by nurses, she was already cold.

It was later diagnosed as postpartum depression causing temporary insanity.

Harold believed Alexander's birth indirectly caused his mother's death, which was why he'd sent the boy to live with farmers, neglecting him for years as if he didn't exist.

Only when needing an heir did Harold recall Alexander, bringing him back to the Whitmore fold.

Alexander's striking resemblance to his mother made Harold doubly affectionate, trying to compensate for years of neglect.

But Alexander remained indifferent toward Harold.

Understandable—he'd spent his first two decades fatherless, surviving alone outside, forming no emotional ties to the Whitmores. Faced with Harold's sudden kindness, Alexander's response was minimal.

Now at dinner, they played out benevolent father and filial son roles, creating palpable dissonance among the family.

Evelyn leaned on the table, scrolling through her phone.

Twitter seemed glitchy—her notification icon showed 99+ messages, pouring in incessantly.

But her account had always been eerily quiet.

She tapped the app curiously, wondering if it malfunctioned.

Then shock hit.

Her ID was trending everywhere.

[Sweet Savage]

[Natalie's Protégé Nicknamed Sweet Savage]

[Sweet Savage's Musical Arrangements Are Stunning]

"What the hell? Has the world gone mad?"

Evelyn investigated further, discovering Natalie had retweeted her arrangement! Even announcing to the world she was her protégé!

Everyone wanted to know who this "Sweet Savage" was. Natalie's fans praised her arrangement from days ago.

But Evelyn stumbled upon something unusual...
###Chapter 610

Evelyn was scrolling through her phone when Alexander walked through the door.

She immediately rushed to him. "Where were you? Why are you back so late?"

The evening had long settled over Cresthaven, and Evelyn had just finished dining alone at their penthouse.

Alexander casually shrugged off his tailored jacket, draping it over the hallway coat rack. "I went to Whitmore Manor to settle your score."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "You confronted your father?"

After the humiliation she'd endured at the Whitmore estate, she never expected Alexander to have heard about it so soon.

Alexander's jaw tightened as he nodded. "Used the family whip on Ethan. He won't be spreading rumors or bothering you again."

Evelyn's fingers twitched at her sides. "You must be hungry. There's leftover soup - let me warm it for you."

Strong arms encircled her from behind, Alexander's stubble grazing her shoulder as he buried his face in her hair.

"Not yet, love. Just let me hold you."

Evelyn stilled, melting into the familiar warmth of his embrace.

A soft smile curved her lips as she placed her hands over his. "Feel that? The baby's moving."

At this stage, the flutters were barely perceptible - like champagne bubbles beneath her skin.

Alexander's large hand splayed across her abdomen, catching the faintest nudge.

"Our child," Evelyn whispered, turning in his arms to face him. "I had a checkup after leaving Whitmore Manor. The doctor says everything's perfect."

She tilted her head up, eyes shining. "Due in November. Do you think Cresthaven will have its first snowfall by then?"

Alexander chuckled, thumb tracing her cheekbone. "When our little one arrives, will I become second priority?"

"Never." Evelyn pressed closer, her voice firm. "You're my heart, Alexander. Our baby completes us." Remembering his fractured childhood, she vowed their family would be different.

They'd shower their child with all the love they'd both been denied.

Alexander cradled her face, his kiss tender yet charged with emotion. "Marrying you was my life's greatest blessing."

The raw vulnerability in his voice made Evelyn's heart swell.

But then she froze.

Beneath Alexander's signature cologne lingered a whisper of jasmine perfume.

A scent she recognized instantly - Isabella's signature fragrance.

Her stomach twisted. "Did you see Isabella today?"

Alexander frowned. "No. Why?"

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. The lie hung between them like smoke.

She forced a smile, extricating herself from his embrace. "It's late. Go shower while I heat your soup."

As Alexander headed to their ensuite, Evelyn moved mechanically to the kitchen. The soup pot hissed as flames licked its base, her reflection warping in the stainless steel.

Her phone buzzed.

Isabella's message contained a single photo - half her face visible against crisp hotel sheets, Alexander's unmistakable suit jacket draped over her bare shoulders.

Before Evelyn could react, the image disappeared.

[Wrong recipient! You saw nothing, right?] Isabella's follow-up arrived instantly.

Then another: [Pregnant women can't satisfy their husbands. Lucky for Alexander, I could. Check his jacket pocket - left you a souvenir.] Also swiftly deleted.

The soup boiled over as Evelyn lunged for Alexander's jacket.

Her fingers closed around a single, unused condom.

The matching one was missing.

Evelyn's vision blurred. She remembered buying this exact brand - a twin pack.

Alexander had sworn he hadn't seen Isabella. Then why would she plant this in his pocket?

A sharp pain lanced through her abdomen. The baby reacted to her distress.

The kitchen spun. She tasted metal - as if she'd swallowed broken glass.

Was their entire marriage a beautiful lie?

When Alexander emerged from the shower, the penthouse stood empty.

A steaming bowl of soup waited on the dining table.

Alexander's call went straight to voicemail. "Evelyn? Where are you at this hour?"

On the other end, Evelyn bit her lip bloody. She needed space to think. "Claire called. I'm keeping her company tonight."

Alexander's voice sharpened. "Alone? Why didn't you wait for me to drive you?"

"After your long day? I took a cab. Almost there." The lie burned her tongue.

Claire's apartment was indeed ten minutes away.

Alexander sighed. "So I'm sleeping alone tonight?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled around her phone.

She wasn't entirely lying - Claire had called earlier about meeting tomorrow. But tonight? Evelyn needed to breathe. To process.

Before her world shattered completely.
###Chapter 611

Claire had been determined to provide breast milk for her daughter Bella, expressing milk diligently every day.

But now that Lucas had taken Bella, Claire's milk supply had dried up from sheer frustration.

When Evelyn arrived, Claire mentioned needing to discuss something important.

Evelyn thought it would be good for her distressed friend to talk things out.

Entering the apartment, Evelyn found only Claire inside, which felt unusual.

"Where's Julian? Shouldn't he be home?"

Claire sighed. "Lately, Julian's been leaving early and coming back late."

It was summer vacation with no dance classes scheduled.

Teenage boys had their own social lives, so Claire didn't pry too much.

Claire pulled Evelyn close and whispered urgently, "I'm sneaking into Bennett Manor tonight to get Bella back!"

Evelyn gasped. "You're kidnapping your own child?"

Claire nodded firmly. "I've checked. Lucas won't be home tonight, and I know Bennett Manor's layout perfectly. Even have the door code memorized..."

Evelyn hesitated. "Why not talk to Lucas properly? He doesn't seem unreasonable."

"We already discussed this at Bella's one-month celebration," Claire countered.

"If he wanted to give me custody, he would've done it by now. Why keep delaying?"

"Just wait here, Evelyn! I'll bring our baby home soon!"

Before Evelyn could protest, Claire dashed out the door.

Evelyn sat stunned in the dim living room. Nearly twenty minutes later, Julian crept in quietly.

Thinking everyone was asleep, Julian stealthily hid something beneath the shoe rack before grabbing pajamas.

When the bathroom light flicked on, Evelyn rose to investigate.

Beneath the rack sat a designer handbag worth about $50,000.

Suddenly everything made sense.

Julian hadn't been socializing - he'd been working multiple jobs to buy Claire this gift.

When Julian emerged, his dirt-streaked face and grimy nails told the full story.

"Construction site?" Evelyn guessed.

Julian froze. Claire's straightforward nature had kept her oblivious, but Evelyn saw through him instantly.

"Tutoring by day, construction by night," Julian admitted quietly. "Wanted to get her something nice."

Evelyn's heart ached. She couldn't bring herself to say Claire hadn't carried such "entry-level" luxury items since college.

This bag represented Julian's entire world - his maximum effort.

"Is the work difficult?" Evelyn asked gently.

Julian smiled. "Every brick I laid, I thought of her. That made it easy."

Meanwhile at Bennett Manor, Claire moved like a shadow through the darkened halls.

Bella's faint whimpers guided her.

"Why is she crying? Did that nanny neglect her again?"

Creeping toward the nursery, Claire's pulse raced.

The sight that greeted her shattered expectations: Lucas, who should've been absent, cradling their daughter with surprising tenderness.

"Want to hold her?" Lucas asked casually, as if expecting her.

The moment Bella settled into Claire's arms, the crying stopped instantly.

"She's hungry," Lucas observed when Bella nuzzled Claire's chest.

Claire blinked in confusion until realization struck.

Noticing Lucas's practiced movements, Claire realized he'd been caring for Bella extensively.

As Claire prepared to nurse, she glared at Lucas. "Out!"

Lucas smirked. "My house. My rules. Besides..." His gaze trailed meaningfully before he retreated to the bathroom.

While nursing, Claire noticed the nursery had been meticulously set up in what was once their honeymoon suite.

"Has Lucas been parenting solo all this time?" The thought stunned her.

After barely five minutes, Lucas emerged shirtless, water droplets tracing his sculpted torso.

Claire hastily adjusted her blouse as Lucas casually remarked, "Breaking and entering without even a hello? I could've cooked you dinner."

Clutching Bella tighter, Claire declared, "I'm taking her tonight."

Then disaster struck - Bella spit up violently.

Panicked, Claire froze until Lucas expertly positioned Bella upright, patting her back until she burped contentedly.

"Babies need burping after feeding," Lucas explained gently. "Claire...it's not that I won't share custody. But you can't even care for yourself properly - how can you care for our daughter?"

As Bella drifted to sleep in her crib, Lucas made his offer: "Stay the night. Prove me wrong."
###Chapter 612

Lucas's suggestion caught Claire completely off guard.

She narrowed her eyes at him. "Stay here overnight?"

They'd been divorced for years. Now that she was in a new relationship, spending the night at Bennett Estate felt entirely inappropriate. Lucas seemed to read her thoughts.

He took two steps back toward the doorway. "The room's yours for the night."

With that, he even pulled the door closed behind him.

Claire pressed her ear against the wood, listening intently.

The sound of slippers against hardwood faded gradually until silence returned. Lucas had clearly left.

She exhaled slowly, turned the lock, then glanced at the sleeping infant on the bed.

Eleanor lay peacefully, her tiny cheeks flushed pink. The serene environment clearly made her feel safe and content.

But Claire had no intention of staying.

After scanning the empty hallway, she scooped Eleanor up, preparing to leave.

Just as she reached the foyer, Eleanor suddenly erupted into loud wails.

Claire froze, patting the baby's back. "Sweetheart, Mommy's taking you home," she whispered.

The crying only intensified.

Panic fluttered in Claire's chest.

Was she hungry again?

Impossible. She'd just been fed!

As Claire fumbled, the commotion drew Lucas downstairs.

He immediately took Eleanor from her arms.

The screaming infant quieted instantly against his shoulder.

Lucas studied Claire. "She's unsettled. I'll keep her tonight - she's comfortable with me." His gaze dropped to Claire's packed diaper bag and wrapped-up baby. One eyebrow arched. "Were you planning to kidnap my daughter in the middle of the night?"

Claire remained silent.

Lucas smirked. Cradling Eleanor with one arm, he grabbed Claire's wrist with the other, leading her back upstairs.

"It's late. Stop making trouble. Try again tomorrow if you must. I won't interfere. Fair?"

His tone was light, almost amused - completely devoid of the anger she'd expected. Claire blinked in surprise.

Before she could react, Lucas had already steered her back into the bedroom.

XXXXX

"When is Claire coming home?"

Julian watched Evelyn expectantly as she ended her call.

Evelyn stared at her darkened screen, fingers tightening slightly around the device.

After a pause, she said, "She's staying the night."

"Staying?" Julian's voice pitched higher as he sprang from the couch. "With Lucas?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

Claire had been vague - something about Eleanor clinging to Lucas, making departure impossible. As an expectant mother herself, Evelyn understood. She wouldn't abandon her child either.

But for Julian, Claire's current boyfriend, this situation was undoubtedly difficult to accept.

Before Evelyn could stop him, Julian had shoved his feet into shoes and stormed out.

XXXXX

With dawn approaching, Evelyn - hindered by her pregnancy - couldn't follow.

This was their private matter. She had no right to interfere.

Instead, she washed up and slept at Claire's apartment.

But sleep proved elusive.

A disturbing dream haunted her - Alexander cheating with Isabella, their naked limbs entwined.

She awoke trembling, a hollow ache in her chest.

Had Alexander betrayed her...?

At first light, restless, she checked her phone.

Overnight, her Twitter had exploded.

Sweet Savage had gained thousands of followers after Natalie's retweet. Meanwhile, a composition she'd casually posted days earlier had gone viral. Initially, comments praised her work. Then plagiarism accusations surfaced.

Evelyn chuckled dryly.

She knew every note was original.

But scrolling further revealed numerous accounts now accusing her of theft.

Even Natalie had trended last night due to the scandal.

Guilt twisted Evelyn's stomach.

She'd never even met Natalie, yet now the renowned musician's reputation was tarnished by association.

What a weekend.

Reviewing the comments, she traced the accusations to a single Twitter account.

The claimant provided "evidence" - drafts of Evelyn's composition.

Recognition struck.

She distinctly remembered tucking those drafts into her notebook at the orchestra. They'd disappeared afterward.

Someone at the orchestra must have stolen them.

The penalty for plagiarism there was immediate expulsion.

Who would dare?

XXXXX

At dawn, Lucas dressed to a security guard's report.

"Mr. Bennett, a suspicious man loitered outside all night."

Lucas moved to the window.

Pulling back the sheer curtains, he spotted Julian by the garden below, head bowed in dejection.

Morning light bathed him, yet he seemed shrouded in darkness.

Lucas's lips curved. "Ignore him."

The guard nodded and left.

Nearby, Claire rubbed her bloodshot eyes.

She hadn't anticipated infant care being so exhausting.

Last night had been sleepless.

Every time she lay down, Eleanor demanded feeding.

Adorable but demanding.

By dawn, Claire could barely keep her eyes open, yet Eleanor kept tugging at her.

Unfamiliar with childcare, Claire muddled through alone, not daring to disturb Lucas.

Eleanor's premature fragility terrified her - she'd nearly dropped the baby during a diaper change.

The memory still chilled her.

Just as dawn broke and Eleanor finally quieted, Claire attempted sleep.

Her phone rang immediately.

"Who is it?" she snapped without checking.

Julian paused, licking chapped lips. "Me."
###Chapter 613

Claire was still half-asleep when her phone rang. The moment she heard Julian's voice, her foggy mind sharpened.

"What's wrong?" she mumbled, rubbing her tired eyes.

Julian's grip tightened around his phone before forcing himself to relax. "I'm outside your house."

"What?" The words didn't register immediately.

His voice came out rough, laced with exhaustion. "I'm standing outside Bennett Estate."

That jolted her awake. "Why are you at Bennett Estate?" The question slipped out before she could stop it.

Julian's eyes squeezed shut, bitterness flooding his senses.

"You're my girlfriend. You didn't come home last night. Don't I deserve an explanation?"

What he didn't say was that he'd spent the entire night pacing outside the gates.

A dull ache began pulsing behind Claire's temples.

She forced herself out of bed and descended the grand staircase.

The second she stepped outside, Julian rushed forward and crushed her in a desperate embrace.

"Why are you staying here? Why didn't you come home? Have you gone back to your ex-husband?"

"Claire, you spent the night in his house. Did you sleep together?"

Each accusation hammered against her skull.

She massaged her temples. "I came to pick up Sophia."

"Then why didn't you leave?"

"Sophia refused to go without her father." Claire sighed. "And I underestimated how difficult childcare would be."

Last night had been an eye-opener. She needed to hire a professional nanny before attempting to take Sophia home again.

Julian's voice cracked. "Is it really about Sophia? Or is this about you not being able to leave Lucas?"

Claire stiffened, anger flaring. "How could you say that?"

"Do I even matter to you?" Julian's voice broke. "Or do you think because I'm younger, my feelings don't count?" These doubts had tormented him through the long night.

He couldn't decipher Claire's true feelings anymore.

"Have you considered how this makes me feel? My girlfriend spending the night at her ex's mansion?"

Claire's headache intensified.

Her body still hadn't recovered from childbirth and the traumatic delivery. Exhaustion weighed down her limbs.

Faced with Julian's emotional outburst, her mind went blank. "Of course you matter."

But last night, all her focus had been on Sophia.

Holding her daughter had awakened primal maternal instincts. Nothing else had seemed important in that moment.

Julian wasn't Sophia's father. He was still young, still learning. He couldn't possibly understand.

Claire wanted to explain but words failed her.

Some experiences couldn't be shared.

"Did you come here just to fight?" She sighed. "Let's discuss this at home."

Julian shook his head violently.

"What now?" Claire frowned.

"You seem perfectly comfortable here." He took a step back, voice rising. "Maybe you should just stay!"

For the first time, Julian lost his temper with Claire. His usual gentle demeanor shattered as his voice cracked with raw emotion.

"Fine! Stay with him then!"

He turned and stormed off before she could respond.

Claire instinctively moved to follow, then remembered her recently healed leg fracture. Running wasn't an option.

She understood Julian's pain, but what choice did she have?

How could any mother abandon her child?

Lucas had finally allowed her to see Sophia. If she'd left last night, who knew when she'd get another chance?

Upstairs, Lucas observed the scene from his bedroom window.

After several failed attempts to call Julian, Claire trudged back inside.

Lucas sat at the dining table, calmly eating breakfast.

As she passed, she declared, "I'm taking Sophia with me."

Lucas set down his fork and leaned back. "Fine."

His immediate agreement startled her.

She hadn't expected him to give in so easily.

"I saw your little lover's tantrum." Lucas's tone dripped with amusement. "Dating a child must be exhausting. So emotional. So...dramatic."

Claire caught the mocking edge in his voice.

She shot him a glare. "Maybe I enjoy the passion."

Lucas chuckled. "Enjoy it? Claire, let's be honest. You're with him out of gratitude. He donated blood during your delivery." His gaze sharpened. "Gratitude isn't love. You've always loved me."

"Delusional!" Claire snapped, refusing to engage further. She marched upstairs to collect Sophia.

"You can take her," Lucas said suddenly, "under three conditions."

"First, my daughter is never left alone with your boy toy. You must supervise."

"Second, if she experiences any harm or discomfort, I reclaim custody immediately."

"Third," his eyes darkened, "no physical intimacy with your man while Sophia is present. No kissing. No sleeping together."

The final condition made Claire explode. "You're insane, Lucas!"

"My personal life is none of your business!"

"I won't have my daughter exposed to inappropriate behavior." Lucas smirked. "Can't handle it? Then leave Sophia with me. I, however, have no problem following these rules."

Claire rolled her eyes.

Was this his twisted way of proving his devotion?

They were divorced. His loyalty meant nothing now.

"Fine! I'll follow your ridiculous rules. But once Sophia leaves with me, don't expect to get her back!"

As Claire strode out, Lucas's lips curved into a knowing smile.

He watched her go, expression calm and assured, as if everything was proceeding exactly according to plan.
###Chapter 614

The moment Claire stepped into the empty apartment, the silence hit her like a physical blow.

Julian's absence was palpable. Even Eleanor had gone out, leaving the space eerily quiet.

Her arms tightened around little Sophia as she carried the sleeping infant to the nursery. With trembling fingers, she dialed Julian's number again.

Still no answer.

The memory of their heated argument that morning flashed through her mind, making her stomach churn.

After an entire sleepless night and the emotional rollercoaster of the day, her nerves were frayed beyond repair.

"Enough," she muttered to herself.

Collapsing onto the bed, she surrendered to exhaustion.

When she awoke hours later, golden afternoon light streamed through the windows. Sophia's hungry wails pierced the silence.

Claire scooped up the crying baby, mechanically beginning to nurse while massaging her throbbing temples.

The clock on the wall read 2:17 PM.

Her stomach growled painfully - she hadn't eaten since yesterday.

Passing Julian's bedroom door, she hesitated before pushing it open.

Everything was immaculate, as always. The military-precise bed, the stacks of medical textbooks with their dog-eared pages and meticulous margin notes.

She'd heard through the grapevine he'd been awarded the prestigious Harrison Scholarship this term.

Her gaze swept the room until it landed on the empty space where his suitcase usually sat.

Her breath caught.

Flinging open the closet confirmed her fears - several of his favorite outfits were missing.

"Just... left?" The words tasted bitter on her tongue.

Claire pressed her lips into a thin line, shaking her head as an unfamiliar ache spread through her chest.

This was their first real fight. She never imagined he'd walk away without a word.

"Adults talk things through," she whispered to the empty room. "What are you, twelve?"

Storming into the living room, she sank onto the couch, trying to steady her breathing.

She'd always believed Julian would never leave unless she asked him to.

How wrong she'd been.

No calls. No texts. Just... silence.

Twenty minutes passed before she could think clearly again.

Life had to continue, Julian or no Julian.

Sophia's renewed cries snapped her back to reality. She rushed to comfort the infant, but the weight of single parenthood pressed down on her.

Between feedings and diaper changes, she couldn't even find time to use the bathroom, let alone eat.

Just as despair threatened to overwhelm her, three sharp knocks echoed through the apartment.

Claire answered the door with a fussy Sophia in her arms.

"Can I help you?"

"Mr. Bennett sent us," the silver-haired butler announced.

Behind him stood two uniformed maids. One immediately washed up and expertly took Sophia from Claire's arms, while the other marched toward the kitchen.

"These ladies will handle all household duties," the butler explained. "Mr. Bennett has arranged their compensation." With a polite nod, he departed.

The maid bounced Sophia gently, engaging her with high-contrast flashcards while the other produced a steaming plate of pasta.

"The pantry was nearly empty," the cooking maid apologized. "I'll do proper grocery shopping after cleaning."

Claire devoured the meal, her pride warring with gratitude.

Lucas's help was the last thing she wanted to accept, but she couldn't deny she was drowning.

These women had cared for Sophia before - the baby already recognized them.

With household burdens lifted, Claire finally caught her breath.

She dialed Lucas's number.

His smug voice answered on the second ring. "Enjoying my little gift?"

"I'll pay their salaries myself," Claire snapped.

"Still pushing me away?" Lucas chuckled. "Do it for Sophia then. Though I'm sure they wouldn't object to double pay."

Claire's finger hovered over the end call button.

"I hear your pretty boy moved out," Lucas continued. "Got what he wanted and left, did he?"

Claire's grip tightened on the phone. "Lucas, if you licked your lips, you'd poison yourself."

His laughter grated. "I'm the only one who truly cares, Claire. Julian was never right for you. You're fundamentally incompatible."

The line went dead.

Claire realized with startling clarity how little she actually knew about Julian.

His university, his major, his age - surface details. She didn't even know his hometown.

Now, finding him would be like searching for a ghost.

At dawn, Evelyn returned to the conservatory to whispers and pointed stares.

Head high, she deposited her bags in the dorm before slinging her cello across her back and marching to the practice rooms.

With the international composition competition days away, she cycled through playlists - classical, jazz, pop - desperate for inspiration.

She was steps from the practice room when someone yanked out her earbuds.

Cassandra Brown stood before her, smirking.

Fresh from two weeks in police custody for locking Evelyn in the concert hall, Cassandra sneered, "Heard about your plagiarism scandal, Evelyn."

Evelyn extended her hand for the earbuds.

Cassandra tossed them aside. "What's with the attitude? If those claims stick, even your precious mentor won't save you from being blacklisted."

Evelyn's laugh was ice. "Funny - right after your arrest, your father came begging my husband for leniency." She eyed Cassandra with disdain. "He's not getting any younger. How can you sleep at night, causing him such stress? Instead of lying low, you're still-"

Cassandra's mouth opened and closed like a fish. With a frustrated stomp, she stormed off.

Evelyn watched her go, shaking her head.

Whoever had orchestrated this smear campaign using Natalie Riley as a pawn, it certainly wasn't Cassandra Brown.

That girl couldn't plot her way out of a paper bag.
###Chapter 615

The whispers followed Evelyn Carter all day. Everywhere she went, hushed voices buzzed about the alleged "plagiarism" scandal.

She ignored them. The cello in her hands demanded her focus. She played, letting the music drown out the noise.

After class, Evelyn and Leonard stepped into the hallway—only to collide with Hank Lopez, the violin instructor from the next room.

Hank shot Evelyn a look before pulling Leonard aside. "Mr. Herty, a word?"

Leonard rarely checked social media. The Twitter storm had likely escaped his notice.

Hank lowered his voice. "Have you seen the news? They're accusing your protégé of stealing someone else's composition."

If proven true, it wouldn’t just ruin Evelyn—Leonard’s reputation as her mentor would crumble too.

The music world had no mercy for plagiarism. Hank, concerned, had come to warn him.

Leonard’s brow arched. "Plagiarism?"

"You haven’t seen it?" Hank pulled out his phone, shoving the screen toward Leonard. "The evidence is right here."

The same sheet music draft Evelyn had seen earlier glared back at them.

Leonard barely glanced at it before handing the phone back. "Baseless rumors. You believe everything online?"

He dismissed Hank with a wave and walked away.

Hank frowned at his retreating back. "Mr. Herty, I’m trying to help! The proof is undeniable—did you even look?" He chased after Leonard, still arguing.

Evelyn stood frozen, watching them go. Her teeth grazed her lower lip.

Curiosity gnawed at her. She pulled out her phone—she hadn’t checked social media all day.

Her notifications were flooded. Demands for a response to the plagiarism scandal clogged her mentions.

No wonder everyone’s whispering.

It’s everywhere.

A bitter laugh escaped her. I’m the victim here. What response do they want?

Without hesitation, she uninstalled Twitter.

Three days until the competition.

Evelyn packed her things and stepped outside. The sun had dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in strokes of crimson and indigo.

A sleek black limousine idled at the entrance.

Leaning against it was Alexander Whitmore.

One hand tucked in his pocket, his gaze flickered toward her—sharp, magnetic.

Her pulse stuttered.

That face never failed to unravel her.

Then she remembered the condom she’d once found in his pocket.

He might not even be here for me.

It could be for Isabella.

The thought twisted something inside her. She lowered her eyes.

Alexander motioned for her.

She hesitated—then took a step forward.

Before she could reach him, Isabella’s voice cut through the air.

"Alexander! Perfect timing—I have something for you."

Isabella brushed past Evelyn, reaching Alexander first. She held out a gift, beaming.

Alexander didn’t take it. His eyes stayed locked on Evelyn, confusion flickering at her hesitation.

Evelyn froze. Then Nathaniel came sprinting from the distance.

He whispered something to her. Her expression shifted.

Under Alexander’s watchful gaze, she turned and followed Nathaniel toward Powell Manor.

Isabella smirked, arms crossed. "She’s awfully close with Dominic."

"You came all this way for her, and she just walked off with him. Doesn’t seem like she cares much about her husband."

Alexander’s gaze darkened. He shot Isabella a glacial look. "Finished? Then leave."

The ice in his voice stung. Isabella flinched, then turned away—but not without glancing back.

Alexander didn’t spare her a second look. He didn’t touch the gift.

Clearly, he was still furious with her.

As night fell, Alexander stood under the dimming sky, his silhouette swallowed by shadows.

His eyes stayed fixed on Powell Manor, sharpening dangerously.

Dominic was injured.

Evelyn rushed to check on him after hearing his leg had worsened.

Inside, Dominic lay on the bed, face contorted in pain.

She lifted his pant leg—and sucked in a breath.

A compound fracture.

"What happened?"

His skin gleamed with sweat.

Nathaniel’s eyes were red-rimmed. "A car accident. Mr. Powell was in a car accident."

"Why wasn’t he taken to the hospital? Where’s the driver? Did anyone call the police?"

"It was Sebastian Powell! How could we? Reginald Powell has always favored his other sons over Mr. Powell. Even if they committed murder, he’d cover for them. But when it’s Dominic—"

"Enough," Dominic snapped.

He locked eyes with Evelyn. "Well? Can you fix it?"

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "Acupuncture won’t help. You need surgery—a metal rod. Go to the hospital. Now."

Nathaniel paled. "Surgery? How long until he recovers?"

"At least three months. Maybe longer."

Nathaniel’s hands clenched. "Sebastian did this on purpose. I saw it—he meant to hurt him. How could he do this to his own brother?"

Dominic’s jaw tightened.

The accident hadn’t been an accident.

He and Sebastian had been on a business trip. Alone, Sebastian had seized the moment—shoving Dominic from the moving car. The driver had then run over his legs.

He’d let his guard down.

Now he was paying the price.

Sebastian, he thought, I won’t forget this.
###Chapter 616

The evening shadows stretched long across the pavement as Evelyn stepped out of Powell Manor.

She'd just finished visiting Dominic at the hospital. The tension between Sebastian and Dominic had reached dangerous levels.

Never in her wildest dreams would Evelyn have imagined Sebastian ordering his driver to deliberately run over Dominic's legs.

"What kind of feud drives brothers to such brutality?" she wondered.

The Powell family empire remained firmly under Reginald's control, with both sons playing their designated roles.

"Even with conflicting interests, the family hasn't split. Reginald is still healthy. Why resort to this?"

Lost in thought, Evelyn exited through the side gate where Alexander waited impatiently.

"You went to Powell Manor? Was Dominic summoning you again?" His voice carried an edge.

Evelyn nodded. "Car accident. Shattered legs. He requested my medical opinion."

"Why does he keep turning to you specifically?" Alexander's jaw tightened.

"Perhaps he trusts my diagnosis more than his physicians?" Evelyn replied softly.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Evelyn, if this continues, I might actually get jealous."

Any man would feel uneasy seeing his wife repeatedly visiting another man. Evelyn knew this would bother Alexander.

Her abrupt departure earlier would have upset any husband.

But the lingering scent of Isabella's perfume on Alexander still haunted her. She wanted him to understand how that felt.

The evening chill settled around them. Alexander reached for Evelyn's hand, frowning at how cold her fingers were.

He immediately shrugged off his jacket to drape over her shoulders.

Evelyn stiffened. Normally, his thoughtfulness would warm her heart.

But tonight, Isabella's cloying perfume clung to the fabric.

With a sharp movement, Evelyn flung the jacket back at Alexander.

He caught it, bewildered. "Evelyn?"

Without a word, she slid into the car, turning her face to the window.

Alexander ran a hand through his hair, completely lost. He'd been the one waiting outside for hours, yet she was angry?

Simon, their driver, wisely remained silent as he pulled away from the curb.

As the car moved through the twilight streets, Alexander suddenly captured Evelyn's hand.

Their fingers intertwined as he gently turned her face toward him with his other hand.

"Tell me what I've done wrong," he murmured.

During Evelyn's absence, Alexander had buried himself in work. He was certain he hadn't given any woman inappropriate attention.

Except...there had been that encounter with Isabella earlier when he came to pick Evelyn up.

But he'd barely spoken to her.

Evelyn's fingers twitched in his grasp. "That day at Willowbrook Apartments...I smelled Isabella's perfume on you."

She watched his reaction closely.

Alexander froze. "We didn't even meet that day. Are you accusing me of something?"

Evelyn nodded.

"My heart belongs only to you," Alexander said urgently.

"And yet I found...that item in your pocket."

Confusion clouded Alexander's features. "What item?"

Evelyn glanced at Simon's back before whispering three words. Alexander's face darkened instantly.

He'd been framed.

He had absolutely no idea how that item ended up in his pocket.

Alexander tightened his grip on Evelyn's hand. "You're smarter than to fall for such obvious tricks."

Pulling her close, he pressed her against his chest. "But they say love makes fools of us all. In a strange way, I'm glad - it means you care enough to be jealous."

Thinking of Evelyn's recent distress filled Alexander with guilt.

No wonder she looked so exhausted today.

His chin rested atop her soft hair. "After all this time together, you should know the man I am. I'm your husband. You shouldn't doubt me."

Before she could respond, Alexander buried his face in her neck.

His warm breath sent shivers down Evelyn's spine. She tried to pull away, but Alexander held her tighter.

"I'm the wronged party here," he murmured against her skin. "Framed, and my own wife doesn't trust me."

To emphasize his point, he captured her lips in a playful bite, teasing them gently.

The intimate contact made Evelyn's pulse race.

"So this is how Alexander expresses his displeasure?" she thought wildly.

Her heart hammered so loudly she feared he might hear it.

Evelyn pushed him away, unconsciously licking her tingling lips before glancing nervously at the front seat.

Simon had discreetly raised the privacy partition.

Evelyn's cheeks burned scarlet, feeling like they'd been caught in something indecent.

Alexander smoothed her hair gently. "That day, I was at the office the entire time. The only other place I went was Willowbrook to help you. As for the perfume..." He frowned, unable to place it.

But he knew one thing for certain - he hadn't met Isabella that day.
###Chapter 617

The realization hit me like a ton of bricks.

If Alexander hadn't met Isabella, how did her signature perfume end up on his clothes?

And that condom...someone had to be physically close to slip it into his suit pocket without him noticing.

It couldn't have been any employee from Horizon Enterprises.

So who then?

Alexander looked completely bewildered, running his fingers through his hair in frustration.

Seeing his distress, Evelyn felt her anger dissipate.

Her temper flared quickly but faded just as fast. All she really wanted was Alexander's reaction to the accusations.

At least now she knew he genuinely felt wronged and that something wasn't adding up.

Evelyn locked eyes with him. "Isabella clearly has an agenda. She sent me a photo wearing your jacket." Alexander froze momentarily before shaking his head in exasperation. "This has to be some twisted game she's playing."

Their conversation was interrupted as the car pulled up to Whitmore Manor.

No sooner had they stepped out than they encountered Vanessa.

Vanessa was supporting Ethan as they took a leisurely stroll through the gardens. The bruises from Ethan's recent punishment were still visible, his complexion sickly pale.

Vanessa spotted them immediately.

Her eyes widened slightly when she saw Alexander and Evelyn holding hands.

"Didn't they fight?" she thought incredulously. "She was absolutely furious that day... What changed?"

A flicker of jealousy crossed her features before she forced a smile. "Welcome back."

"Mm." Alexander barely glanced her way.

As the two couples passed each other, Ethan could only steal furtive glances at Evelyn.

His gaze lingered even after she disappeared inside, unable to tear his eyes away.

Vanessa noticed, her fists clenching unconsciously. With a bitter smile, she murmured, "Ethan, look how happy they are together."

Her hand drifted to her stomach as she spoke.

"My prenatal checkup is tomorrow. Will you come with me?"

Evelyn walked a few paces before suddenly turning to Alexander.

"You said you came to Whitmore Manor that day, right? Did Vanessa approach you?"

Alexander frowned in thought. "She grabbed my pant leg, begging me to help Ethan." The pieces suddenly clicked for Evelyn.

"Could Vanessa be the source of the perfume?" she wondered.

"Is she working with Isabella?"

The next morning, Evelyn received a frantic call from Claire.

"Evelyn, I don't know what to do! Julian's disappeared and I'm terrified something's happened to him."

Claire's anxiety grew as she recounted their argument outside Bennett Estate that morning, pouring out every detail to Evelyn.

Evelyn listened quietly before responding, "Let me try calling him for you."

With little expectation, she dialed Julian's number. To her surprise, the call connected.

"Julian, where are you? Claire's been worried sick."

The line was filled with chaotic background noise - a middle-aged man shouting in a thick dialect, the faint sound of a woman crying. Julian moved away, the noise fading slightly.

His voice sounded strained. "Family emergency. Had to return home."

Evelyn pressed, "Claire's really concerned about you."

The prolonged silence made Evelyn check if the call had dropped.

She verified the connection before asking, "When are you coming back?"

The shouting man called Julian's name again, this time more urgently.

Julian's grip on the phone tightened. "Please tell Claire... we should end things. She deserves better."

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond.

Frowning, she tried calling back, but the line wouldn't connect this time.

Claire felt like she was losing her mind.

Evelyn's message echoed in her head as she gripped the steering wheel tighter.

Julian wanted to break up.

A hysterical laugh escaped her. She'd paid his tuition, covered his living expenses, even settled his mother's debts. And now she was being dumped.

Julian had pursued her first, confessed his feelings first. How dare he be the one to end it?

Within the hour, Claire made her decision.

She drove out of Cresthaven, heading into more rural areas. Bella, sleeping in the backseat, woke occasionally crying, but Claire kept driving.

Once on the highway, regret set in. She shouldn't have brought Bella. This whole trip might have been a mistake.

But stubborn pride pushed her forward.

She needed to hear those words from Julian's lips.

Eventually, Claire's luxury car rolled into a small, rundown town.

The sleek vehicle looked absurdly out of place, like a swan in a pigsty.

Julian had mentioned his hometown, but Claire only had vague directions, relying on memory and GPS.

Bella, unaccustomed to long journeys, cried frequently.

Claire's regret deepened. She never should have come.

But turning back wasn't an option.

Minutes after exiting the highway, Lucas called. "Where the hell did you take Bella? Are you seriously chasing after that pretty boy because he dumped you? Claire, you've lost your mind!" Claire scowled. "Are you having me followed?"

"Chasing after someone like Julian? Have you no self-respect? Let it go, Claire. You're worth ten of him!"

His tone was razor-sharp, clearly agitated. "Why would you degrade yourself like this?"

"Lucas, we're divorced. Why do you care what I do?"

"Because I still care about you! I can't watch you self-destruct. Send me your location - I'm coming to get you."

Claire hung up without responding.

The town had no proper hotels, only dilapidated motels.

Choosing the least offensive option, Claire checked in and grabbed a quick meal.

Once Bella was settled, Claire called Julian again.

This time, he answered.

"I'm in your county now."

Julian sounded stunned. "What?"

"Come get me, or I'll knock on every door until I find you. Your choice."

About forty minutes later, Julian appeared at the motel.

His shoes were caked with mud from last night's rain, pants stained. He looked as worn as the town itself, confusion and exhaustion etched on his face. He was clearly out of breath from running.

When he saw Claire, he visibly fought the urge to embrace her.

"I told you it's over. Why did you come?"

Claire immediately noticed Julian's red-rimmed eyes and the angry red mark on his cheek - unmistakably from a blow.

Standing abruptly, she demanded, "Who did this to you?"
###Chapter 618

Julian shook his head, his voice barely above a whisper. "No one hit me. I just scraped myself by accident."

Claire's brows knitted together. "Do I look stupid to you? Those aren't accidental scratches. Who did this to you?"

Julian's gaze drifted toward the sleeping baby in the crib. He hadn't expected Claire to bring Bella here.

"Is this Bella?"

She had grown so much since he last saw her in the operating room. Nearly two months later, her delicate features were becoming more pronounced—a perfect blend of Claire and Lucas.

Claire grabbed Julian's wrist. "Stop deflecting. Who hit you? Was it your father again?"

Julian's silence was answer enough.

Claire exhaled sharply.

Without another word, she turned and scooped Bella into her arms. "Take me to your house. Now."

Julian stared at her, stunned. He had walked away without looking back, yet here she was—standing in his small town, demanding to see where he lived. It felt surreal, like a dream he couldn't wake from.

He lowered his head. "You should go back."

He turned to leave.

Claire's expression hardened.

"I drove for hours to find this place, and now you're telling me to leave? Julian, do you even care? Why did I come here if you're just going to push me away? What aren't you telling me?"

Julian bit down on his lip, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

Still, he refused to speak.

The tension between them thickened until Bella, sensing the unease, began to fuss.

Claire immediately softened, rocking the baby gently.

Bella stirred awake, her tiny face scrunching as she whimpered for milk. After days of caring for her, Claire had learned her cues well.

Julian stepped outside, shutting the door behind him. He crouched against the wall, pulling out a cigarette. The flame flickered as he took a slow drag.

By the time Claire emerged, the hallway was thick with smoke.

Anger flared in her chest. She snatched the cigarette from his fingers and crushed it under her heel.

"Since when do you smoke?"

This wasn't him.

The Julian she knew didn't do this.

Something was wrong—something he wasn't telling her.

Claire crossed her arms. "Did your father gamble again?"

Julian nodded.

"How much?"

Silence.

"Julian. How much?"

"Two million."

Claire froze.

"Two million? Last time it was three hundred thousand."

A heavy pause settled between them before she finally spoke. "I'll pay it."

Julian's head snapped up. "No. I don't want your money."

He had stopped relying on Claire's finances long ago.

After she cleared his family's debts the first time, he had saved every penny he earned, determined to stand on his own.

The bag he bought her—earned through odd jobs—was supposed to prove he wasn't the leech Lucas had accused him of being.

But now, he was trapped.

Two million was impossible.

He knew Claire could cover it, but he couldn't ask her again.

His family was a black hole, and he refused to drag her down with him.

"Claire, just go back. This isn't your problem." His voice cracked, tears glistening in his eyes. "I've dropped out of school. I'm not returning to Cresthaven. Throw out whatever I left at your place."

Claire's jaw tightened. "I came here to help you, and this is how you react? Did you ever really consider me your girlfriend?"

She pulled a card from her wallet. "This will cover the debt. Pay it off, then come back. We'll pretend none of this happened."

Julian shoved it back into her hand. "No. Don't you get it? What about next time? Or the time after that? Last time was three hundred thousand. Now it's two million. What if it's twenty million next? How many times can you bail me out?"

The card burned in his palm, a humiliating reminder of his helplessness.

Julian's face flushed with shame. He turned and ran before she could see him break.

Claire watched him disappear, frustration knotting in her chest.

She wasn't leaving like this.

Not after coming all this way.

Claire strapped Bella into the car seat and started the engine. She followed the path Julian had taken, determined to find him again.

The town was small—it wouldn't be hard.

Her car bumped along the unpaved road, kicking up dust as she navigated toward the cluster of houses on the hillside.

The steering wheel jerked in her hands, the uneven terrain testing her patience.

Minutes later, she parked outside a weathered farmhouse.

Chickens scattered as she stepped out, her shoes sinking into the mud. The air smelled of damp earth and livestock.

Bella slept soundly in the backseat. Claire hesitated, then left her there.

She scanned the property—and froze.

Inside, several burly men loomed, their arms covered in tattoos.
###Chapter 619

The living room was a mess.

Two women—clearly mother and daughter—were tied up, their faces pale with fear.

A thug loomed over them, his voice rough. "Where's the damn money? Pay up!"

A gaunt middle-aged man wrung his hands. "We don't have it! Just two more days, please!"

"You said that last time!" The thug scoffed. "Guess I gotta teach you a lesson."

He yanked the ropes tighter around the women. "No money? Then I'll take their fingers!"

He pulled out a knife, grinning.

That was when Julian Mercer burst in.

He shoved himself between the thug and his family, eyes blazing. "If you want blood, take it from the man who owes you!" He jabbed a finger at his father, Marcus Davis. "He's the one who gambled it all. Take him—we don't need him."

Marcus's face twisted. "You little brat! I'm the head of this family!"

Julian laughed bitterly. "Head? You're a parasite. You've sucked us dry for years!"

Marcus lunged, fist flying.

Julian, busy untying his mother and sister, didn't dodge in time. The punch landed hard.

"You disrespectful—!"

The thug rolled his eyes. "Enough! I'm here for cash, not your drama!"

Then Marcus did the unthinkable.

He pointed at his wife and daughter. "Take them instead! The girl's almost old enough to marry. The wife can clean, cook—whatever you want!"

Julian's stomach turned.

His mother—calloused hands gripping her daughter—screamed, "No! Don't touch her!"

Claire Dawson, watching from the doorway, felt like she'd stepped into a nightmare.

She strode forward, heels sinking into the grimy floor.

All eyes snapped to her.

In her designer dress, she looked utterly out of place—like a swan in a gutter.

Julian's mother and sister gaped. They'd never seen anyone so... polished.

Julian froze.

Shame burned through him. Of all people, why did she have to see this?

Claire didn't hesitate. She pulled a black card from her purse and slapped it against the thug's chest. "The debt's cleared. Now leave."

The thug's eyes bulged as he processed the payment—two million, just like that.

He whistled. "Damn, Marcus. You got lucky." He leered at Claire. "Sweetheart, need protection? My boys could—"

"Go," Claire snapped.

They scattered.

Marcus eyed Claire like a vulture. "Who are you? That card really had two mil?"

Julian's mother fumbled for a chair, wiping dust off the seat. "Miss, please sit—"

"No." Claire's gaze swept the crumbling walls, the broken furniture. This was where Julian grew up?

The divide between them had never felt wider.

She turned to leave.

Marcus grabbed Julian's arm. "Who is she? Rich, huh? You should—"

"Shut up!" Julian shook him off and chased after Claire.

Outside, Claire cursed under her breath. Her tires were stuck in mud.

Julian caught up, voice raw. "I'll pay you back. Every cent."

She rolled down the window, lips curled. "How? You dropped out of med school. Back to dancing for tips? Selling yourself?"

She tossed a bag at him. "Keep it. Consider it severance pay."

His throat tightened. "Claire, I—"

"Need a lift?"

Lucas Bennett appeared, smirking. His SUV idled nearby.

Julian's fists clenched as Claire stepped out of the car without a backward glance.
###Chapter 620

Claire's eyes widened in shock. Lucas Bennett was the last person she expected to see standing there.

"What are you doing here?"

"Playing chauffeur," Lucas replied smoothly, holding the car door open, his palm resting against the frame above her head. "Get in. Someone else will handle your car."

Claire hesitated.

Lucas arched a brow. "It's a four-hour drive back to Cresthaven. Do you really want Eleanor screaming her lungs out halfway through?"

That did it. Claire relented.

During the trip, Eleanor had wailed nonstop in the backseat, but Claire couldn't comfort her while navigating the highway.

It shattered her heart.

Julian Mercer stood nearby, watching as Claire moved toward Lucas's car. His lips parted as if to speak, but no words came. "Claire..."

Lucas shot him an icy glare. "You think you have the right to call her that?"

Grabbing Julian's shoulder, Lucas steered him several paces away.

"I warned you before—you live in different worlds. Know your place. You can't compete with me."

Julian's expression darkened, disbelief flashing in his eyes. "What are you talking about? Did you... was my father's debt your doing?"

Lucas smirked, neither confirming nor denying. His grip on Julian's shoulder tightened.

"What difference does it make?" Lucas said coolly. "This is reality. The gap between us is insurmountable. Consider this a lesson—you don't stand a chance." Without waiting for a reply, Lucas turned and strode back to his car.

The engine roared to life, leaving Julian rooted in place.

The setting sun painted the sleek car in golden hues.

Oddly, despite the fading light, it felt blinding, as if swallowing Julian whole. He watched the car disappear into the horizon, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

Then, abruptly, he dropped to his knees and slammed his fist into the ground.

Blood dripped from his split skin, but the crushing weight of helplessness hurt far worse. His vision blurred.

To Lucas, destroying him had been effortless. Julian never stood a chance.

Inside the car, Claire sat in silence, staring blankly out the window. She looked hollow, as if exhaustion had drained her soul.

"Straight home, or should we stop for food?"

Lucas's voice pulled her back. She had shifted to the backseat to be near Eleanor.

"Home," Claire answered without hesitation.

She couldn't bear another second in this place.

Noticing her fatigue, Lucas didn't press further.

"There's a blanket beside you. Close your eyes and rest."

Claire didn't respond. Miraculously, Eleanor stayed quiet the entire ride.

Claire dozed off until the bustling streets of Cresthaven jolted her awake.

Rubbing her eyes, she took in the familiar cityscape. Having grown up in urban sprawl, she'd never ventured into such a remote area before. Only now, surrounded by life, did she feel grounded again.

Instinctively, she glanced at Eleanor. The baby had woken up at some point.

Her wide eyes were fixed on the passing scenery. At two months old, her vision should have been limited, yet she seemed utterly captivated. Claire reached out to stroke her cheek—

Eleanor burst into tears.

Hungry.

Claire's gaze flicked to Lucas. He was focused on the road, seemingly oblivious. Quickly, she lifted Eleanor, draped a blanket over herself, and began nursing.

Unexpectedly, Lucas spoke. "Not bad. You're getting the hang of motherhood."

Claire stiffened, twisting her body to block his view. "Eyes on the road!"

Lucas chuckled but said nothing more.

By the time Claire finished, the car had stopped.

She blinked in confusion. "Why are we at your place?"

Lucas reversed into the garage and killed the engine.

One foot still on the brake, he turned to her. "Claire, I'm furious you took Eleanor to that godforsaken town. Remember our agreement when I left her in your care?"

Claire bristled. "There was no rule about leaving Cresthaven."

Lucas smirked, arrogance oozing. "Then consider this a new one. Eleanor doesn't leave the city. You broke the rules, so I'm taking her back."

"You—" Claire clutched Eleanor tighter, furious at his unreasonableness.

"If you want to see her, fine. You can even stay with her. But you'll do it here. Under my supervision."

With that, Lucas yanked open the car door. He seized Claire's wrist. "Relax. I'm not interested in you right now."

His gaze swept over her.

Following his eyes, Claire looked down.

The rural roads had been muddy. Her shoes were ruined, her legs streaked with dirt, her skirt splattered with grime.

Claire, who prided herself on elegance, had never been this disheveled in her life.

Lucas plucked Eleanor from her arms. "Hurry up. How long are you going to stand there looking like you just crawled out of a coal mine?"

Claire hesitated. But with Eleanor already in Lucas's arms, being carried inside, she had no choice but to follow.

Early the next morning, Evelyn Carter packed a small bag and headed to the competition venue.

The composition contest officially began today. For the next 48 hours, she'd be confined to a designated room, crafting her piece.

Once time was up, the judges would review all entries.

This year's panel was notoriously strict, and the 50 participants had been handpicked.

The rules were simple:

Each contestant would draw a theme. They could collaborate or work solo.

On the third day, the judges would score the pieces.

The top ten would perform live with instruments.

While the cash prizes were substantial, what competitors truly coveted was the prestige.

This was one of the industry's most esteemed events.

Beyond the top three awards, there was also a special honor—

The Audience Choice Award, determined by public vote.

Historically, the judges' picks and the public's favorite never overlapped.

Professional critics valued depth. The masses preferred melody.

Talent scouts swarmed the event, eager to buy winning compositions for their artists. Pre-vetted hits were gold.

Who wouldn't want that?
###Chapter 621

Evelyn was acutely aware she was merely a placeholder contestant with no real shot at victory. Her only goal was not to embarrass Leonard too badly—making the top ten would suffice.

Isabella, however, radiated fierce determination when they crossed paths at the competition entrance.

"This is being live-streamed," Isabella said, voice sharp. "Our orchestra only has two representatives. I'll ask one last time—will you collaborate with me?"

Evelyn shook her head. "No collaboration."

She knew a duet would create an entirely different effect than a solo performance. Two instruments could weave together, enhancing the melody's depth and emotional impact. Historically, nearly all winning pieces were duets. By refusing, Evelyn was effectively forfeiting any chance at the prize.

Isabella's lips thinned. "Fine. Let's see what magic you can pull off alone."

What Evelyn hadn't anticipated was Cassandra's presence.

Typically, contestants were selected through national orchestra auditions or university recommendations. Cassandra had been arrested during internal selections, disqualifying her.

Yet there she stood, smirking. "Surprised? My father's the orchestra's vice conductor. Pulling strings to get me in was child's play." She tossed her hair. "If not for that unfortunate incident, I'd have won the cello division. Don't think Leonard's mentorship makes you superior, Evelyn. I'm still the cello queen."

Evelyn turned away without a word.

The dismissal made Cassandra's nails dig into her palms. She'd begged her father for this chance. Her arrest had spread through the industry like wildfire. Winning was non-negotiable—it would be her redemption, her ticket into the entertainment world.

She whirled toward Isabella. "First violin, how about we collaborate?"

Isabella hesitated. Freshly returned from abroad, she lacked connections. Most contestants already had partners. A cello's rich tones would make her violin shine brighter.

After a beat, she nodded.

In her assigned room, Evelyn noticed the camera pointed at her desk. So this truly was live.

The host's voice crackled through speakers, announcing the competition's start. Contestants would draw lots to determine their composition themes.

A hostess handed out identical spherical containers. Evelyn plucked one at random.

Unfolding the slip, she read: "Love."

A deceptively simple theme. Countless love songs existed across genres and eras—but that very breadth made it treacherous. The cello's melancholic timbre wasn't naturally suited for love's fiery passion.

Following instructions, she displayed the theme to the camera. The countdown began.

Soundproofing swallowed all noise from adjacent rooms. Over the next forty-eight hours, if selected for the top ten, she'd perform her piece live.

Evelyn tuned her cello absently. The piece she'd posted online days ago would've fit... but using pre-existing work was unacceptable.

She scribbled notes, the camera zooming in on indecipherable markings. Only she understood the chaotic scrawl.

Meanwhile, Isabella and Cassandra had also drawn "Love."

Cassandra's conservatory-trained mind conjured ideas instantly. Twenty years of rigorous training guaranteed that. Isabella, too, felt confident—her overseas education had honed her composition skills.

But collaboration cracks appeared immediately.

Both insisted their instrument take the melodic lead, relegating the other to harmony.

"The violin's brilliance is meant for melody," Isabella snapped, mindful of the cameras. "Expecting me to play second fiddle? Absurd. It's like buying flowers and keeping only the stems!"

Cassandra scoffed. "The cello's depth carries its own narrative power."

"Then we compose separately," Isabella proposed. "After twenty-four hours, we'll pick the stronger piece."

Two options increased their odds. Cassandra agreed.

Twenty-four hours later, Evelyn's composition neared completion.

She'd jotted initial thoughts: What was love to her?

Sincerity. Mutual respect. Arguments weathered together. Companionship that felt like coming home.

Her mind conjured Alexander's face.

The cello's voice, aged and wise, demanded closed eyes and an open heart. As notes flowed, her vision crystallized. She transcribed them meticulously.

Isabella and Cassandra, however, were deadlocked.

Their styles clashed violently. Both refused to compromise.

With time bleeding away, Isabella suddenly brightened.

"Split the piece," she whispered, pulling Cassandra aside. "Violin leads the first half, cello the second."

Cassandra frowned. "It'll sound disjointed. Our pieces don't mesh."

Isabella's smile turned sly. "I have a pre-written composition. Minor adjustments, and it's competition-ready."

The camera caught their conspiratorial huddle—but not their words.
###Chapter 622

The discovery struck Evelyn like lightning.

Hidden among the orchestra's archives was a hauntingly beautiful composition that perfectly captured the essence of love. With just minor adjustments, it would be competition-ready. Evelyn's fingers trembled as she traced the musical notes - this was her golden ticket.

The melody already had viral potential. Online voters would eat it up. She'd at least secure an honorable mention.

Then came the shocking realization.

The piece had been shared on Twitter weeks ago by renowned cellist Natalie Riley - composed by none other than Leonard Herty's protégé, Evelyn Carter.

Evelyn's stomach twisted with envy. How dare that pregnant nobody possess such talent?

Her fingers flew across her phone, creating a fake composer account. She uploaded the original manuscript as "proof" of her authorship. The internet exploded.

Within hours, plagiarism accusations against Evelyn Carter trended worldwide. Orchestra administrators launched an immediate investigation.

The music world didn't tolerate thieves. If convicted, Evelyn Carter would be blacklisted forever.

Isabella Morgan smirked. With the manuscript in hand, who could prove she wasn't the true composer?

"Let's see Leonard Herty protect his precious student now," she muttered. "When this scandal breaks, he'll drop her like a hot coal."

The competition deadline loomed. Isabella knew using existing music was risky, but with her "modifications," who could tell?

She spent hours transcribing, altering just enough to claim originality. When finished, she handed the sheets to Cassandra Brown.

Cassandra's eyes lit up. "This is brilliant! The interplay between cello and violin - exquisite!" They digitized the score and submitted their entry.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter had submitted her composition early. Six months pregnant, she desperately needed rest after two grueling days composing.

Her baby bump had become noticeable, though loose clothing still concealed it. The weight made every movement sluggish.

Judges reviewed submissions in marathon sessions. Most contestants anxiously awaited results, but Evelyn slipped away to a nearby bistro. Sunlight warmed her face as she ate slowly - her first proper meal in days.

Back at the venue, judging progressed rapidly. Initial rounds used a strict scoring system: discard highest and lowest marks, average the rest. Top ten advanced.

Leonard Herty and Natalie Riley sat on the judging panel. After fifty compositions, even their trained ears grew fatigued.

Isabella and Cassandra's piece played as entry #49. Isabella studied the judges' reactions like a hawk.

"Current tenth place is 80 points," Cassandra whispered. "We need higher to advance."

The screen flashed their score: 85. They'd made it.

"Go change into your performance dress," Cassandra urged. But Isabella lingered, waiting to hear the final entry.

Evelyn returned just as her composition began playing. The judges' expressions shifted instantly - leaning forward, eyes alight.

Entry #50 received the highest scores yet, including a rare 99 from notoriously harsh Leonard.

Isabella's blood ran cold when she saw Evelyn rise and walk backstage.

Online viewers already flooded forums with "#50 for the win!" comments. A few praised #49, but the tide clearly favored Evelyn's piece.

Backstage, Cassandra found Isabella pale and shaking. "What's wrong?"

"I think #50 is Evelyn Carter's," Isabella whispered. "Her score crushed ours."

Cassandra scoffed while applying lipstick. "Composition means nothing without performance. Many choke in the live round."

But Isabella had heard Evelyn play. Her cello skills now rivaled Cassandra's as principal cellist.

A dangerous glint entered Isabella's eyes. "We need to ensure she doesn't get that chance."

Cassandra's makeup brush froze mid-stroke. "What are you suggesting?"

Isabella's smile turned venomous. "An unfortunate accident before her performance. Nothing traceable back to us."

The two women locked eyes, an unspoken pact forming. The competition had just turned deadly.
###Chapter 623

Leonard Herty's brow furrowed as he sat at the judges' panel.

Natalie Riley leaned closer. "Mr. Herty, is something wrong?"

Leonard took a sip from his thermos. "Doesn't the 49th composition sound familiar to you?"

Having just evaluated the 50th piece, Natalie struggled to recall the previous melody.

She requested the audio team to replay the 49th entry. After listening twice, recognition flickered in her eyes. "It does sound familiar, but I can't quite place it."

Natalie checked the live stream comments on her phone. The chat was exploding with observations.

[That 49th piece sounds identical to the viral melody from TikTok last week! Just slightly rearranged.]

[Wasn't that melody involved in a plagiarism scandal?]

[So contestant 49 is plagiarizing too?]

Though cleverly modified, music professionals could instantly identify the stolen composition.

Natalie whispered, "The rules state all compositions must be original works created within 48 hours. If someone submits pre-existing material..."

Leonard's expression darkened. "That's automatic disqualification."

"What if it's outright plagiarism?" Natalie pressed.

Leonard's voice turned icy. "Then we remove them from the competition immediately."

Natalie handed him her phone. "You should see this."

Cassandra Brown slipped out of the dressing room.

Isabella Morgan had revealed that Evelyn Carter composed the 50th entry. The news unsettled Cassandra deeply.

If Evelyn placed higher than her in the competition, Cassandra's position as principal cellist would become a joke.

She couldn't risk that humiliation.

In the instrument storage area, a staff member stood guard.

As the 49th contestant, Cassandra pretended to retrieve her cello. Passing Evelyn's instrument, she discreetly used a razor to sever the strings.

The sabotage wouldn't be visible until played. Either the string would snap mid-performance or throw the instrument out of tune.

Cassandra smirked, imagining Evelyn's public humiliation before the judges and live audience.

This was payback for those two weeks in jail after Evelyn called the police. Humming, Cassandra returned to the dressing room with her cello.

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "You seem cheerful."

No cameras meant they could speak freely.

Cassandra kept her tone light. "Just handled some business. That 50th entry you were worried about? Consider it neutralized."

Isabella feigned ignorance but gave a knowing smile. "You're on soon. Let's warm up."

Performers had thirty minutes to prepare before taking the stage in sequence.

After changing into her performance gown, Evelyn went to collect her cello.

She always inspected her instrument before playing. But when she set it down in the dressing room, a string snapped without warning, lashing her cheek.

"Ah!"

The sharp pain made her gasp. Blood welled from the thin cut on her right cheek.

She dabbed at the wound, letting the stinging subside. Makeup would slow healing, so she arranged her hair to conceal the injury.

Examining the broken string, Evelyn's frown deepened. These were new strings, replaced just last week.

The clean, precise cut showed deliberate tampering.

Her pulse quickened. The 49th contestant was already performing. No time to investigate.

A staff member knocked. "Five minutes, Ms. Carter."

Panic fluttered in Evelyn's chest. Without that string, she couldn't perform.

Other cellists surrounded her, but none would lend their instrument to a competitor.

Then she remembered - Natalie Riley always brought her personal cello. But they'd never formally met.

Would approaching her be inappropriate?

Cassandra and Isabella left the stage, confident in their performances.

The live voting display showed their names climbing into the top three.

Cassandra's heart raced. She might actually win.

Isabella looked equally determined.

Then the spotlight shifted to the 50th performer.

Evelyn walked onstage in a satin gown, her hair cascading over one shoulder, graceful despite her pregnancy.

Isabella's eyes burned with jealousy at Evelyn's flawless figure.

Cassandra's lips curled when she recognized Evelyn's cello. Any moment now...

But as Evelyn played, the sabotaged string held firm.

Cassandra's smile faltered. This wasn't supposed to happen.
###Chapter 624

The final note hung in the air like a whisper of heartbreak. Evelyn Carter exhaled slowly, her fingers still trembling against the cello strings. She'd been certain the sabotaged string would snap mid-performance, yet somehow it had held.

The concert hall erupted.

A standing ovation shook the venue. People wiped tears, clutching their chests as if Evelyn's music had physically rearranged their hearts. Even the stone-faced judges rose to their feet, applauding with rare enthusiasm.

Isabella Morgan's glare could have melted steel. She shot Cassandra Brown a look that screamed, "You had one job."

Cassandra's mouth went dry. She'd loosened that string herself—it should have broken during the crescendo!

Evelyn's composition wasn't just technically flawless; it was soul-wrenching. The cello wept a story of decades-long love—sun-dappled memories of an elderly couple's intertwined hands, of shared silence more intimate than words. The kind of love that outlasts lifetimes.

Backstage, Natalie Riley turned to Leonard Herty with shining eyes. "Now I understand why you broke your ten-year hiatus to teach her."

Leonard's chest puffed up. "Talent like hers comes once in a generation."

Online, the livestream exploded:

[I just ugly-cried in public!]

[That's not music—that's pure magic!]

[VOTE NOW! This deserves ALL the awards!]

Then came the detractors:

[Wait—isn't this the same girl accused of plagiarism last month?]

[Convenient how she disappears during the scandal only to show up with a "new masterpiece."]

Trending hashtags #EvelynCarter and #PlagiarismScandal began battling for top spot. Unaware, Evelyn's vote count soared past competitors.

Vanessa Hart crushed a throw pillow against her pregnant belly, the livestream mocking her from the iPad. While she'd been confined to Hawthorne Estate after her miscarriage, Evelyn—also pregnant—was out there glowing under spotlights.

"Why does she get to have everything?" Vanessa hissed.

Across town, Ethan Caldwell gripped his phone hard enough to crack the screen. Fresh welts from his father's punishment still burned his back, but that pain was nothing compared to the agony of hearing Evelyn play again.

Every note was a knife twisting in old wounds. She'd once played like this for him—private concerts in moonlit gardens. Now that music belonged to the world. To Alexander Whitmore.

He hurled the phone against the wall.

Backstage, Evelyn set down her miraculously intact cello just as voting closed.

Isabella approached with a smile sharp enough to draw blood. "Bravo. Who knew you had such... dramatic flair?"

"Thank you," Evelyn said coolly.

Cassandra kept staring at the cello like it had personally betrayed her. "It should've broken," she muttered.

Evelyn turned slowly. "I changed the strings." She'd borrowed spares from Natalie—standard practice for professional musicians.

Cassandra blanched. "Lucky you."

"Not luck." Evelyn's voice dropped to ice. "It was sabotage." She signaled to the stage manager concealed in the wings. "We found our culprit."

The manager stepped forward, lips pressed thin. "Contestant 49, your admission just cost you this competition."

"No! I was joking!" Cassandra's shriek drew stares.

Isabella jumped in. "She's my accompanist! If she's disqualified—"

"The composer advances regardless," the manager cut in.

Relief flashed across Isabella's face before she could mask it. Cassandra looked gutted. Their partnership had always been transactional—now Isabella had thrown her under the bus without hesitation.

Evelyn watched coldly as security escorted Cassandra out. One enemy down. But as the whispers about plagiarism swirled online, she knew the real battle was just beginning.
###Chapter 625

Cassandra Brown burned with fury. "If Isabella hadn't convinced me Evelyn's composition was a serious threat, I would never have touched that cello! With all eyes on me, was I supposed to be that reckless?"

Her hands trembled as she realized Isabella wasn't protecting her - she was throwing her to the wolves.

"I contributed plenty to that composition! I gave Isabella countless suggestions!"

The realization struck Cassandra like lightning. She'd been played.

Yes, she'd sabotaged Evelyn's instrument, but every step had been orchestrated by Isabella.

Bitter resentment twisted Cassandra's features as she glared at her supposed ally.

"She manipulated me into this!"

The thought chilled her. "What a perfect way to sacrifice a pawn."

Now all that remained was crushing regret.

She only had herself to blame for trusting a viper.

"Isabella, stop lying! This was all your idea!"

"Just because we're teammates doesn't mean I knew about your schemes!"

"You got caught - don't drag me down with you! Supervisor, you must believe me!"

Isabella's voice trembled with theatrical distress, her performance worthy of an Oscar.

Cassandra gaped at the audacity. "How does she live with such shamelessness?"

She clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms, desperate to wipe that calculated innocence off Isabella's face.

While backstage erupted in chaos, the live broadcast continued seamlessly.

Scores had been tallied. The award ceremony commenced.

Staff herded contestants toward the stage for the presentation.

Isabella burned to know her ranking, but Cassandra's outburst posed a greater threat. She turned with calculated sweetness. "Listen..."

"...when our piece wins, I'll ensure you're credited on the recording. You'll share the glory."

A transparent ploy to silence dissent.

Cassandra's expression wavered. Though disqualified, the quiet handling meant her name could still appear as co-composer.

On screen, the results prepared to unveil.

Evelyn expected nothing - the competition was fierce, and she was still new to composition.

The ten finalists lined up on stage.

Isabella's pulse raced. This major competition marked her live broadcast debut.

She'd crafted the perfect ingenue image - soft pink lips, wide innocent eyes.

A carefully constructed persona.

In entertainment's cutthroat world, beauty alone wasn't enough. "Talented composer" paired with "girl-next-door" charm? That was her golden ticket.

The special award mattered most - audience votes meant commercial potential.

Nerves twisted Isabella's stomach as she edged closer to Evelyn.

Their entry numbers placed them side by side.

Evelyn seemed distracted. Isabella scoffed internally. "A national broadcast! How can she zone out?"

Then reconsidered. "She must be terrified. Good."

Third place was announced. Then second.

Winners clutched trophies, stammering through joy-filled speeches.

Only first place and the special award remained.

Isabella's confidence surged. Her composition surpassed those already awarded.

But she didn't want first place called yet - the special award was her target.

The host gripped the envelope, spotlight intensifying.

"First place goes to..."

The audience held its breath.

Then - infuriatingly - the host set down the envelope, grabbed water, and read an ad.

Online viewers erupted.

[Get on with it! My hair's turning gray here!]

[The suspense is killing me!]

Finally, the host continued, gaze flicking toward Evelyn.

"First place... entry fifty! Evelyn Carter!"

Thunderous applause.

The classical-leaning piece had charmed the judges - a predictable choice.

Isabella exhaled. Evelyn's win removed her toughest competition for the special award.

Now for the main event.

Record executives leaned forward, contracts at the ready.

Isabella straightened, radiating confidence. She'd practiced her acceptance smile for hours.

The host's gaze landed on her.

Isabella's heart leapt. "It's happening. She's looking right at me."

She clasped her hands demurely, ready for her close-up.

"And the special award goes to... entry fifty! Evelyn Carter!"

Isabella had already stepped forward.

She froze.

The world tilted.

"How? Both awards? This can't be real!"
###Chapter 626

Isabella's smile froze mid-curve.

The higher the expectations, the harder the fall. Her chest constricted painfully as hot tears pricked behind her eyelids.

"How can Natalie win both awards?"

Her mind reeled in disbelief. There must be some mistake in the judging process.

No competition had ever awarded both the special prize and first place to the same contestant - this defied all logic.

Just moments ago, Isabella had secretly checked the live voting rankings. She'd consistently placed in the top three. This outcome made no sense!

Meanwhile, Natalie stood motionless, utterly stunned by the announcement.

"Fate works in mysterious ways," she thought. "I entered on a whim, never expecting this!"

Her bewildered gaze sought out her mentor Leonard among the judging panel.

He responded with an approving thumbs-up, his usually stern features softened by a proud smile.

Natalie exhaled in relief.

"Leonard never gives praise lightly," she realized. "If he approves, my composition must have truly resonated with both the judges and audience."

As ceremony staff gestured for her to approach the stage, every camera lens focused on her reaction.

The presenter was none other than Natalie Riley - a living legend in the music industry whose mere presence elevated the competition's prestige.

Viewership numbers skyrocketed to 35 million as Natalie Riley, impeccably dressed in a navy suit, handed the trophy to her namesake.

"Congratulations!"

Their hands brushed during the exchange - the first real interaction between mentor and protege.

Earlier, Natalie had borrowed equipment through assistants, but seeing the celebrated musician up close, she was struck by her warmth.

"Thank you," Natalie murmured, accepting the award.

Just as her fingers closed around the trophy base, Isabella lunged forward.

She snatched the microphone with startling aggression.

"Something's rigged about this competition!" Isabella's voice rang through the auditorium. "My scores were equally high - how does she deserve two awards?"

Moments before Natalie's walk-up, Isabella had confirmed her ranking.

Even without the special prize, second place should have been hers!

Waving a crumpled score sheet before the cameras, her voice trembled with outrage.

"I demand transparency!"

The venue erupted in murmurs. Judges exchanged concerned glances while audience whispers grew to a dull roar.

Livestream comments flooded in:

[Plagiarism? After I voted for her!]
[In a prestigious competition like this? Unbelievable!]
[Ban plagiarists from music permanently!]

Isabella's knees threatened to buckle, but she forced steel into her posture.

"Accusations require proof," she challenged.

The host responded coolly, "A Twitter post surfaced days ago containing strikingly similar music."

"Per committee rules, plagiarized works are disqualified with potential further action."

As the original melody played, realization dawned:

[Now I recognize it! Just slightly modified!]
[How did this get past screening?]
[Is she seriously still standing there?]

Isabella straightened defiantly.

"That's my own composition! The rules never prohibited adapting previous works."

Producing her phone, she displayed her Twitter account - revealing herself as the mysterious "NoName" account that had recently accused "Melodic Fury" of theft.

[Wait...if she's adapting her own work...]
[Still unfair! Others created original pieces!]
[Wait - isn't Natalie Riley connected to "Melodic Fury"?]
[This tarnishes the competition's integrity!]

The tide of public opinion shifted dramatically in Isabella's favor.

Watching hateful comments about Natalie multiply, Isabella allowed herself a small, satisfied smile.

The host received urgent instructions through her earpiece.

"Ms. Morgan," she said gravely, "Can you verify this Twitter composition is authentically yours?"

Isabella's confidence wavered momentarily.

"No one could possibly know about those discarded drafts," she reassured herself.

"Of course it's mine!" she declared indignantly. "Who else's could it be?"

At that moment, a staff member approached bearing a forensic document analysis report.

The handwriting examination results silenced the room completely before triggering explosive reactions.
###Chapter 627

The live broadcast exploded into pandemonium.

[Wait, what just happened? The forensic expert confirmed the Twitter script matches Evelyn's handwriting perfectly?]

[Someone explain this mess to me!]

[It's simple! Someone stole the original manuscript of "Melodic Storm" from Natalie, Evelyn's junior apprentice, and now they're trying to pass it off as their own! And guess who's behind it? Isabella!]

[No way! That's beyond disgusting! Stealing creative work and then playing victim? The audacity!]

[No wonder "Melodic Storm" stayed silent through all the online hate – she was being framed! Her composure is incredible – I'd be screaming from rooftops!]

[Exactly! Poor Evelyn! Enduring all this slander without defending herself. I heard trolls have been flooding her DMs for weeks!]

[Keyboard bullies make me sick!]

Isabella watched in horror as her world crumbled.

Her face burned with humiliation, the weight of exposure crushing her.

"This can't be happening," she thought. "My career is over. Who'll hire a known plagiarist?"

The orchestra's strict anti-plagiarism policy flashed through her mind. Expulsion was inevitable.

Even teaching positions at music academies would be impossible now.

Cassandra sat among the audience, witnessing the spectacular downfall.

She gasped when the truth surfaced about Isabella's stolen composition.

"Karma's a bitch," Cassandra murmured, relieved she'd avoided sharing the stage.

Rage boiled inside Isabella as her dreams shattered.

"You're setting me up!" she screamed, charging toward Evelyn like a madwoman. "This report is fabricated!"

The crowd watched in mixed horror and amusement as Isabella unraveled.

Then – impact.

Evelyn, wearing modest heels, stood steady until Isabella's unexpected lunge.

With no time to react, Evelyn instinctively shielded her abdomen as Isabella crashed into her back.

Gasps echoed through the auditorium.

The stage's elevated edge loomed dangerously close.

Natalie sprang forward, grabbing Evelyn's wrist. "Careful!"

Live comments flooded in:

[Why isn't anyone shipping them? Mentor-student cellists with insane chemistry!]

[Stop! Natalie's way out of her league!]

[Isabella's just throwing a tantrum because she got caught. Attacking someone? Classy.]

Evelyn, shaken, gently touched her belly.

"Did that scare you, little one?" she wondered, feeling stronger movements than usual.

Observant viewers noticed the protective gesture and the subtle curve.

[She attacked a pregnant woman? Disgusting!]

[If Natalie hadn't reacted... God, the consequences!]

Security finally dragged Isabella away. Her legs gave out in the hallway.

A shadow fell across her crumpled form.

Sebastian crouched beside her. "I saw everything."

He'd dropped everything when the scandal broke.

Isabella scanned the empty corridor. "Here to mock me?"

"Never." He grasped her hand. "When you wanted Dominic punished, I made it happen. His legs? Shattered. Hospitalized."

Isabella recoiled. "That was just venting! You actually...?"

"The Powells are ruthless, but for you..." Sebastian pulled her into a crushing embrace.

"Let go!" she hissed. "You're engaged to Victoria Clarke! If her family sees this–"

The Clarkes ruled Cresthaven with iron fists. A disgraced musician like Isabella? Easy prey.

Sebastian scoffed. "They wouldn't dare touch what's mine."

Nearby, a shadowy figure exhaled cigarette smoke, the scar on his nose bridge barely visible.

As Isabella disappeared into Sebastian's car, he crushed his cigarette.

"Know her, Andrew?" a voice asked.

The man simply walked away, leaving the question unanswered.
###Chapter 628

The man in the baseball cap watched as Alexander and Isabella walked away, his piercing gaze following them until they disappeared around the corner.

There was something dangerous about him - the kind of person you'd instinctively cross the street to avoid.

"I don't recognize her," he muttered under his breath.

Nathan raised an eyebrow skeptically. "Really? You were staring holes through her back just now!"

After a brief pause, the sidekick added, "That's Sebastian Powell from the Powell family. They've been our business partners for years."

"But those Powell brothers? Always at each other's throats. Rich families - all smiles in public, knives out in private." He lit a cigarette, exhaling smoke through his nostrils.

Meanwhile, Isabella wobbled in her stilettos, and the capped man tensed as if to rush forward.

Then he checked himself.

Alexander immediately knelt to examine her ankle. "Are you hurt?" His voice dripped with concern.

"Hey! What do you think you're doing?" Isabella gasped.

"Your ankle's swollen. You can't walk. I'm taking you to my car."

Sunlight glinted off Alexander's gold-rimmed glasses, making his eyes sparkle with mischief.

He flashed a charming smile and effortlessly scooped her into the passenger seat before she could protest.

"Should we stop by the hospital?"

Isabella shook her head violently. "Absolutely not! Take me back to the symphony hall!"

With the windows down, their every movement was visible from the street.

The capped man watched as Alexander tenderly massaged Isabella's injured foot, his face the picture of worry.

"Fine, no hospital. But let me at least get some ointment on our way back?" Alexander suggested, pulling her closer.

"You've been on my mind constantly, Isabella. Every night when I close my eyes, it's your face I see."

From a distance, their words were inaudible, but their intimate embrace spoke volumes.

Isabella fought back revulsion.

She barely knew Alexander - their previous encounters had been strictly business.

Still, she reasoned, "If he's willing to cross Dominic just because I asked... he could prove useful."

After the humiliation at the competition, she needed allies.

She allowed the embrace.

Encouraged, Alexander cupped her face and pressed his lips to hers.

Isabella's stomach turned.

Fortunately, the kiss lasted only seconds.

"Let's get you back. I'll apply the ointment, then we can..." His suggestive tone left little to imagination.

"No! Just drop me off - and don't come inside!" Isabella insisted.

"Why not?"

She glared. "The symphony hall is crawling with people. What if someone sees us?"

Alexander waved dismissively. "Is that all? Then come to my penthouse, or we could-"
"Alexander! I'm exhausted. Not today."

Reading her mood, he backtracked. "Alright, let's just get that ointment."

As they drove off, the capped man stood motionless, watching until the car vanished.

Alexander deliberately slowed as they passed him, stealing a glance before pretending disinterest.

Minutes later, the sidekick chuckled. "Still staring, Andrew? They're long gone."

Only then did the man look away.

The sidekick shook his head. "What's Sebastian playing at? Isn't his wedding in two weeks?"

"That woman definitely wasn't Victoria Clarke. If Ms. Clarke finds out..."

"Victoria Clarke?"

"Sebastian's fiancée. Saw her once - stunning woman."

The sidekick grinned suggestively. "And let's just say she's... generously proportioned up top. Hey - Andrew! Where are you going? I wasn't finished!"

Back at the venue, Evelyn composed herself after the shocking encounter.

Isabella's shove hadn't injured her, but the live broadcast chaos demanded she maintain dignity through the awards ceremony.

As soon as it ended, she retreated backstage - straight into strong, familiar arms.

She looked up to find Lucas, breathless from rushing.

He'd been watching the live stream, glued to his phone during an unavoidable meeting.

When he saw Isabella collide with Evelyn on screen, he'd nearly shattered his phone screen trying to reach them.

A twenty-minute drive became an eight-minute adrenaline-fueled sprint.

He clutched a slightly battered bouquet from his mad dash.

"Should we get you checked?" Genuine concern etched his features.

Evelyn nodded.

At six months pregnant, she couldn't take risks.

Just then, Natalie approached. "Evelyn, Mr. Herty wants to host a celebration dinner."

An opportunity to formally introduce everyone - fellow students who'd never properly met.

Evelyn's eyes clouded with worry. "Natalie, please tell him I'm unwell. A celebration isn't appropriate right now."

Natalie's gaze dropped to Evelyn's belly. "Did you overexert yourself?"

Evelyn nodded slightly. "Possibly."

Natalie's expression turned serious. "Then you must get checked! I'll inform Mr. Herty."

Evelyn smiled gratefully. "You've been incredibly helpful today. Let me treat you to dinner soon - no arguments."

"Looking forward to it," Natalie replied, nodding at Lucas in recognition.

They'd met before - the cello Evelyn now played was one Lucas had purchased from Natalie at considerable expense. For musicians, their instruments were sacred - rarely parted with.

Except, of course, for those like Lucas who moved in different circles.

Even the most idealistic artists needed to eat.
###Chapter 629

The awards venue buzzed with anticipation. Reporters clustered like vultures, cameras poised to capture Evelyn Carter, the night's double laureate.

She stood at the epicenter of this media storm, every journalist desperate for an exclusive.

But Alexander Whitmore had other plans. Cradling his wife protectively, he navigated through secret exits, leaving the press pack bewildered by their disappearance.

By the time anyone noticed Evelyn's absence, the couple was already speeding toward the medical center.

History would remember Evelyn as the most elusive winner in the ceremony's annals.

After thorough examinations, the physician confirmed the baby's stable vitals.

But when Evelyn visited the restroom, she discovered alarming spotting.

The doctor's expression darkened when she reported this.

"We're admitting you for observation," he declared. "Strict bed rest is mandatory."

Alexander immediately turned to Simon Graves. "Fetch our essentials from home."

Evelyn protested, "You have work tomorrow. Hospital couches are torture devices. The doctor said we're just being cautious."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Abandoning my family here? That's not happening." He began rearranging the waiting area furniture. "I'm camping right here. One word and I'm at your side."

Evelyn surrendered to his stubborn devotion.

Exhausted from the awards chaos, she succumbed to sleep quickly.

Outside, Alexander made a call that crackled with icy disappointment.

"Isabella," he greeted tersely.

Isabella Morgan answered swiftly, her silk robe clinging to shower-damp skin. The golden hour light caught on a discarded condom in her wastebasket. With a frustrated kick, she sent the trash can spinning away.

Alexander cut to the chase. "You owe Evelyn a public apology for today's disgrace."

Isabella's breath hitched. She'd anticipated this confrontation but not its severity.

"Alexander! My reputation's in tatters online. Where's your sympathy?"

"You earned every bit of backlash," he spat. "Plagiarizing Evelyn? Shoving her? I'm disgusted."

Were it not for his debt to Andrew, he'd have dragged her before cameras immediately.

"Evelyn's hospitalized. I'm sending the address. Apologize sincerely or consider our friendship terminated. Don't come crying for favors afterward." The line went dead.

Isabella erupted. Luxury skincare bottles shattered against her floor in a cathartic explosion.

A knock interrupted her tantrum. "Ms. Morgan? Maestro Green demands your presence."

Wiping furious tears, she changed hastily and marched out.

Too late, she noticed the eavesdropping chorus girls. Their smirks fueled her rage.

Once she passed, their whispers detonated.

"Plagiarism queen thinks she's royalty?"
"Bet Green's axing her tonight."
A blush crept over one girl's cheeks. "Did you hear... noises from her room earlier?"

Giggles erupted. "Oh! I saw a music department boy scaling the fence!"

Scandalized gasps followed. "In our chaste dormitory? How trashy!"
"With her billionaire fiancé? Cheap thrill seeker."
"Exposing us to their kinks? Revolting!"

Meanwhile in the conductor's office, Isabella faced a tribunal of section leaders. Their collective glare could've frozen lava.

"The board voted unanimously," Theodore Green announced. "You're expelled effective immediately."

Isabella's nails bit her palms. She'd expected consequences but not this nuclear option.

"Understood."

To her, the orchestra had always been a stepping stone. She turned sharply, offering no apologies to the colleagues who'd stayed late to oust her.

The violin master adjusted his glasses. "Not even remorse? Who recruited this viper?"

HR manager Leonard Herty raised a timid hand. "Her credentials seemed impeccable..."

Theodore's gavel-like voice fell. "In music, character outweighs talent. Always."

Leonard nodded frantically, sweat beading his brow.

"Absolutely, Maestro!"

###Chapter 630

The sterile hospital walls seemed to close in on Evelyn Carter as she lay confined to bed rest. The last person she expected to see was Dominic Powell rolling through her doorway in a wheelchair.

After his recent car accident, steel rods now reinforced both his legs. His sudden appearance sent a jolt of surprise through her.

Alexander Whitmore had left for work at dawn, leaving Evelyn to obey doctor's orders. Boredom had settled in quickly, making her restless.

Just as she considered sneaking out, the door swung open. Nathaniel Powell pushed Dominic inside.

Evelyn had only endured half a day of hospitalization, but Dominic had suffered through a full week. His eyes lit up at the sight of her, while she instinctively pulled the blanket tighter around herself.

He'd watched yesterday's live stream. He knew about her award.

Nathaniel had spotted Alexander leaving the elevator when he went for breakfast. That connection led Dominic straight to Evelyn's room.

Dominic's voice turned thoughtful. "Seems the lesson wasn't strong enough."

Evelyn caught the dangerous edge in his tone. "What are you planning?"

"Since you're stuck here and your husband's dragging his feet, guess I'll have to intervene." His eyes gleamed with mischief, sending chills down her spine.

"Don't even consider it! We're not close enough for your 'help'."

Evelyn knew Alexander's feelings well. She wouldn't let him get tangled in her mess with Isabella Morgan.

Dominic's reckless reputation preceded him. She feared what he might do to Isabella, complicating everything further.

Dominic chuckled. "Still feeling sympathy for your attacker? Should I call you kind or just foolish? With that attitude, how will you protect your child?" His disdain for Alexander was palpable.

To Dominic, Alexander pretended to care while letting Isabella walk free as his wife lay hospitalized.

"If it were me," Dominic mused, "I'd have crushed Isabella already."

His gaze drifted to apple slices on the table - likely Alexander's doing before he left. Dominic popped one into his mouth, eyes lingering on Evelyn's belly. "Consider this a lesson for my future son."

Evelyn frowned, offended. "Dominic, what do you want?" She thought, "My child has nothing to do with him."

Dominic grinned. "I'm keeping an eye on you. Is that so hard to understand?"

Nathaniel slipped in, whispering urgently. Dominic's expression shifted to eager anticipation. "You're certain?"

Nathaniel nodded confirmation.

Dominic leaned closer, voice dropping. "Here's some gossip to pass time: my brother Sebastian's fiancée Victoria was kidnapped last night."

Evelyn frowned. "What's that to me?"

"Thought you might enjoy some entertainment," Dominic shrugged.

The rift between Dominic and his brothers was common knowledge. With Sebastian and Victoria's wedding weeks away, Dominic relished the unfolding drama.

Nathaniel sighed. "Probably a ransom. They're demanding $100 million from the Clarke family."

Dominic scoffed. "The Clarkes couldn't scrape that together overnight." The construction business struggled in this economy, even for top players.

"What's Sebastian doing?" Dominic asked, intrigued.

"Victoria's brother came this morning seeking funds from the Powells. But Mr. Sebastian Powell claimed they'd just purchased land and lacked liquidity." Dominic chuckled. "This gets better."

Despite their business arrangement marriage, Sebastian's cold response surprised even Dominic.

Nathaniel added, "Mr. Reginald Powell can't intervene either."

Dominic nodded. "The old man loves his public image."

Evelyn showed little interest in Powell family drama until Victoria's name registered. They'd been classmates.

During Evelyn's time with the Hayes family, Vanessa Hart constantly stirred trouble between Evelyn and classmates. Victoria alone had resisted Vanessa's manipulations.

Perhaps spoiled by her family, Victoria possessed an unshakable confidence. She'd called out Vanessa's schemes when others turned against Evelyn.

Evelyn initially mistook it for kindness, later realizing Victoria simply despised Vanessa.

Now, hearing of Victoria's kidnapping, Evelyn felt compelled to help. Richard Hayes had sent Christmas funds - perhaps she could assist the Clarkes.

Meanwhile, Isabella Morgan packed her dorm belongings under the orchestra's urgent eviction notice.

Penniless and directionless, she reluctantly called Alexander for help.

Seeing her name flash, Alexander tossed the phone to Simon Graves. "Handle this. I'm in a meeting."

Simon answered coldly. "Ms. Morgan, Mr. Whitmore is unavailable."

"Do you truly think it appropriate to ask a married man for housing? You have a fiancé, don't you?"

Isabella's blood boiled. "Fiancé? You mean Dominic? That's a joke!"

She snapped back, "My brother—"

"Mr. Whitmore owes your brother, not you. His terms are clear: apologize to Mrs. Whitmore for yesterday, or forget his help."

Isabella hung up, seething. She'd never gotten along with Simon.

Outside, staff pressed her to vacate. Tears welled as she thought, "Why is everyone against me? My family's gone, and now Alexander abandons me too."

One option remained: Sebastian Powell. The thought turned her stomach.

"Never letting Sebastian find me housing!"

Finally, Isabella made her decision: she'd apologize to Evelyn.

"Pride means nothing. If an apology regains Alexander's favor, what's the harm?"
###Chapter 631

The news of Evelyn's hospitalization spread like wildfire.

No sooner had Dominic left her room than the Whitmore family descended upon the hospital in full force, their concern palpable as they crowded into her space with well-wishes and gifts.

Sophia Ellis entered first, carrying an oversized bag of supplements. "Evelyn, my family owns a wellness company. These are specially formulated for expectant mothers. If you like them, I can bring more next time." Not to be outdone, Audrey Mills chimed in, "And I brought organic fruits—pesticide-free and fresh!"

Evelyn felt slightly overwhelmed but forced a gracious smile, accepting their offerings as the room buzzed with chatter.

Harold Aniston even made an appearance, offering well-meaning but unsolicited advice about prenatal care.

Yet, amid the crowd, Evelyn couldn't help but notice the absence of Eleanor and her family.

Frankly, she was relieved. The last people she wanted to see were Eleanor, Ethan, or Vanessa. Their absence was a blessing.

Still, with so many visitors, she couldn’t bring herself to ask them to leave.

The forced pleasantries drained her, and exhaustion crept in.

Sophia, however, was determined to keep the conversation alive, her voice loud and persistent.

Just when Evelyn thought she couldn’t take another minute, Claire Dawson walked in—like a lifeline.

Claire surveyed the room with a sharp gaze. "Alright, everyone. Evelyn needs her rest now."

Sophia and the others took the hint, reluctantly filing out.

As the door clicked shut, Claire took Evelyn’s hand, concern etched on her face. "Seriously, you don’t have to entertain them. If you’re not in the mood, just send them away. Why suffer?"

Evelyn sighed. "They’re Alexander’s family. I have to keep up appearances. We’ll cross paths again, so it’s better to stay civil."

Besides, most of them were older than her. If she outright dismissed them, the gossip would be merciless.

Claire nodded in understanding. "I get it. I used to feel the same way about Lucas’s relatives. Every time I had to face them, I was a nervous wreck, playing the perfect wife."

She smirked. "But you’ve got it better than I did. At least Alexander has your back. Lucas? He was never around, leaving me to deal with his family alone."

Evelyn arched a brow. "I heard you’ve been spending time with Lucas again. Are you two… reconsidering things?"

She had no idea what had happened after Claire chased Julian to his hometown, but since then, Claire had never mentioned him again.

Evelyn suspected that chapter had closed.

The thought of Julian stirred mixed emotions—he had seemed like a decent man, treating Claire well.

Claire shook her head. "No, we’re not getting back together. We’ve agreed to co-parent Bella."

In other words, they would share custody.

"Now that he knows she exists, it’s time he steps up and acts like a father."

Claire’s tone was firm, as if she had made peace with the arrangement. After everything—giving birth, raising a newborn—while Lucas had walked away without lifting a finger, it was only fair.

Having spent time with Bella, Claire knew firsthand how exhausting parenting could be, especially during sleepless nights.

As much as she adored her daughter, she didn’t want her entire life consumed by childcare.

Now that she had recovered from childbirth, she needed to return to work—something impossible if she were solely responsible for Bella.

Involving Lucas was the logical solution.

Evelyn admired Claire’s resolve. Since her divorce, Claire had become more self-assured.

Women should always prioritize themselves.

"What about Julian? How are things with him?"

Claire’s gaze drifted past Evelyn. "I’m disappointed in Julian. I chose him hoping for happiness, and now I’m walking away for the same reason…"

She couldn’t understand why Julian had vanished without explanation, refusing to share his struggles. It felt like he didn’t trust her enough to let her in.

She knew he had his pride, but the lack of communication had created an irreparable rift.

Evelyn didn’t press further. Claire had clearly made her decision.

Just then, a knock interrupted them. Both women turned to see Isabella Morgan stepping inside.

Claire immediately tensed. She knew Evelyn’s hospitalization was tied to Isabella’s reckless actions.

This was the woman who had caused the car crash that sent Evelyn into premature labor—and now she had the audacity to show up here.

"What do you want?" Claire snapped, her voice icy.

Isabella swallowed hard. "I came to apologize to Evelyn."

Claire scoffed. "Apologize? Seriously?"

Evelyn glanced at Simon Graves, standing behind Isabella, and realized why she hadn’t seen him earlier.

Alexander must have sent her to make amends.

"I wasn’t thinking yesterday. I never meant to hurt you," Isabella said, biting her lip, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. She looked pitiful. "Evelyn, I’m so sorry!"

"Save it, Isabella. We’re not buying the act," Claire said dryly.

That kind of manipulation might work on men, but women saw right through it.

Isabella stood frozen, unsure whether to wipe her tears or let them fall.

If she hadn’t been expelled from the orchestra and left with nowhere to go, she wouldn’t have come so willingly.

"I didn’t steal your composition—I found it by accident. I had no idea it was yours. You didn’t actually lose anything, and honestly, the controversy gave you more exposure."

Claire let out a disbelieving laugh. "No loss? Are you joking? People were tearing Evelyn apart online, accusing her of plagiarism. If you hadn’t tweeted that nonsense, none of this would’ve happened!"

Isabella tried to defend herself. "But the song gained more attention because of it, didn’t it? If anything, I helped her."

"Are you seriously suggesting Evelyn should thank you for this mess? Isabella, have you no shame?"

Cornered, Isabella’s composure cracked.

"You don’t understand! I was kicked out of the orchestra because of this! She’ll never have to see me there again. Isn’t that punishment enough?"

Evelyn was surprised by how swiftly the orchestra had acted.

Claire wasn’t backing down. "You were fired because you plagiarized. Don’t blame Evelyn for your mistakes."

Isabella’s tears finally spilled over.

Her dreams of a music career were crumbling, and now she was being berated by Claire.

"If you want to cry, do it outside. Evelyn needs to rest," Claire said, rubbing her temples.

With that, Isabella fled, defeated.

She had fulfilled her mission—apologizing as Alexander demanded. Now, she just hoped he wouldn’t abandon her.

As she wiped her tears, a shadow loomed before her.

She looked up—and froze.
###Chapter 632

The sun cast golden rays through the clinic windows as Vanessa Hart waited for her prenatal results.

The doctor smiled warmly. "Everything looks perfect with the baby's development."

Vanessa exhaled in relief, her fingers instinctively brushing her stomach. This pregnancy had come unexpectedly soon after her miscarriage—a miracle she'd barely dared to hope for.

Stepping outside, she collided with an unexpected figure.

Isabella Morgan stood there, her designer dress wrinkled, mascara smudged beneath red-rimmed eyes. Vanessa had seen the disastrous livestream yesterday—Isabella's humiliating public meltdown was all over social media.

Clearly, Alexander Whitmore had forced her to apologize to Evelyn.

Vanessa offered a tissue. "Fix your face, Ms. Morgan. You look like a raccoon."

Isabella snatched it with a bitter laugh. "Come to rub salt in my wounds?"

The hospital corridor buzzed with curious glances. Vanessa arched a brow. "Why would I? You're not even on my radar."

The truth was, Isabella didn't hate Evelyn—she was just desperately clinging to Alexander, her last lifeline.

Vanessa leaned closer, voice dropping to a whisper. "If you want to stay close to Alexander, I know a way..."

Isabella recoiled. "You're using me to hurt Evelyn?"

Vanessa's hand rested on her belly as she smiled. "Call it... mutually beneficial advice."

Before Isabella could respond, her phone blared. Seeing Sebastian Powell's name, her face paled.

Vanessa tactfully withdrew as Isabella answered.

"Are you alright? I heard about the orchestra." Sebastian's concern dripped through the speaker. "Let me get you an apartment—"

"Nauseating," Isabella cut in coldly. "Alexander's taking care of me."

Silence. Then Sebastian's voice turned dangerous. "He's a married man, Isabella."

"And you're engaged to Victoria," she shot back. "Yet here you are."

A sharp inhale. "That's different. I love you."

Isabella hung up, unaware that just beyond the corner, a wheelchair sat motionless.

Nathaniel Powell swallowed hard, watching Dominic Powell's expression darken. They'd come for a routine checkup—only to overhear that explosive conversation.

Nathaniel ventured carefully, "Sir... perhaps we should—"

Dominic tapped the wheelchair armrest. "Tell me, Nathaniel. Which part of me looks upset?"

Nathaniel suppressed a shudder. The calmer Dominic appeared, the deadlier the storm.

A slow smile curled Dominic's lips. "So Sebastian let Victoria get kidnapped because his heart belongs elsewhere... fascinating."

He'd always wondered why the Powell family forced him into this engagement instead of golden boy Sebastian. Now he understood—Keith would never allow his heir to be tied to a scandal.

Nathaniel hesitated. "Should we inform Ms. Carter?"

Dominic chuckled. "And give Alexander Whitmore the advantage? I think not."

His tongue pressed against his cheek. Oh, he'd collect what was owed—with interest.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter finally convinced her doctor to discharge her.

"Any discomfort, come back immediately," the doctor warned, eyeing her abdomen.

Evelyn nodded, eager to surprise Alexander. She stopped at the market, selecting ingredients for his favorite meal.

But as she entered their home, her smile faltered.

Her slippers were gone. In their place—a pair of stilettos she'd last seen on Isabella.

Her pulse spiked. "Isabella's here?"

The living room stood empty.

Then footsteps descended the stairs.

Isabella emerged from the master bedroom, yawning, wearing Evelyn's robe and slippers.

Evelyn's blood turned to ice. "What are you doing in my house?"

Isabella blinked sleepily. "I live here now. Weren't you supposed to be hospitalized?"

The grocery bags slipped from Evelyn's numb fingers.
###Chapter 633

"What nonsense are you spouting?"
Evelyn found Isabella's claims absolutely ridiculous and couldn't bring herself to believe a single word.

During her hospital stay, Alexander had been her constant shadow.
He juggled Titan Capital Group's demanding workload by day and kept vigil at her bedside by night, with Simon delivering fresh suits daily.
The man barely slept, often working until dawn, yet he always found his way back to her.
When autumn's chill crept in, he'd cocoon her in his warmth, his sculpted torso radiating heat beneath her exploring fingertips.

"Evelyn, you're playing with fire. Pregnancy won't always protect you," Alexander would growl, his smoldering gaze promising retribution.

Their intimate dances always ended the same way - with Alexander burying his frustration in the curve of her neck, his stubble grazing sensitive skin until she dissolved into breathless laughter.
Crammed together on the narrow hospital bed, Evelyn had never felt more cherished.

Now, seeing Isabella padding around in slippers through their penthouse, Evelyn's blood turned to ice.
"This is my home! What gives you the right to be here?"

The sight of rumpled sheets in the master bedroom ignited her fury.
"Who authorized you to enter our room? Get out!" She ripped the contaminated linens away, her stomach churning at the violation.

Isabella merely flicked her hair, unfazed. "Dramatic much?"

Evelyn's fingers clenched around her phone. "I'll show you dramatic. Alexander!"
The call rolled to voicemail.

"Meeting?" she muttered before rounding on Isabella. "I don't care how you got in. Leave now or I'm calling security."

"Alexander invited me!" Isabella taunted. "His penthouse, his rules. What's it to you?"

"I'm his wife! Half of everything here is mine!" The declaration silenced Isabella momentarily.

With exaggerated theatrics, Isabella turned toward the elevator. "Fine. But he'll come retrieve me personally!"

Evelyn wasted no time incinerating the tainted bedding. As she stepped out to dispose of it, she found Isabella lingering in the foyer.

The woman's sudden self-inflicted slap made Evelyn blink. "Have you lost your mind?"

Isabella whimpered into her phone, "Did you hear that, Alexander? She hit me!"

Evelyn's lips thinned. Retreating to the bathroom, she filled a basin with icy water.

"Last chance," Evelyn warned from the doorway.

Isabella's mocking "crazy bitch" mouthing was the final straw. The water arced perfectly, drenching Isabella's designer blouse.

Winter's approach made the dousing particularly cruel. Isabella's teeth chattered as she wrenched the basin from her head. "You'll regret this, Evelyn! Ah—"

Evelyn froze. Without any contact, Isabella suddenly tumbled down the curved staircase.

"Is this some deranged performance art?" Evelyn muttered, watching Isabella writhe on the marble below.

The penthouse door burst open. Alexander's usually impeccable hair was disheveled, his tie askew from rushing home. His gaze flickered between his soaked childhood friend and his pregnant wife.

"Evelyn, are you hurt?" He was at her side in three strides.

Isabella's tear-streaked face contorted. "I'm the one who fell! Why does no one care about me?"

###Chapter 634

Evelyn shook her head slowly, but then Isabella's piercing cry shattered the tense silence.

"Alexander! It hurts so much! My face—I think it's ruined!"

Alexander's gaze snapped to Isabella, his breath catching at the sight before him.

Blood pooled on the marble floor, its source unclear, but the vivid crimson stain was enough to make his stomach twist.

"Alexander, what did I do to deserve this? She just attacked me out of nowhere! Am I—am I going to die?" Isabella's voice trembled, her sobs punctuated by sharp gasps as she gestured dramatically at her injuries. Alexander's eyes locked onto the angry red mark blooming across her cheek.

His mind reeled. Evelyn did this?

He shot Evelyn a quick, disbelieving glance.

She had always been so composed, so gentle. The idea of her lashing out violently was foreign to him.

But Isabella's hysterics left no room for hesitation.

"Alexander, I swear I didn't provoke her! She just lunged at me!"

Isabella's wails crescendoed, fresh tears streaking down her face as another rivulet of blood trickled from her temple.

Evelyn, who had been observing the scene from the staircase, finally pieced it together.

So this is her game. Playing the victim to frame me.

Descending the steps, Evelyn demanded, "She just showed up uninvited, claiming you told her she could stay here—in our bed. Is that true?" Her voice was sharp with disbelief. She trusted Alexander, but the doubt gnawed at her.

How else would Isabella have gotten into their home?

Unless...

Her thoughts raced. "If you didn't give her the code, how did she even get inside?"

She needed answers, and she wasn't backing down.

Alexander glanced at Isabella, whose guilty flinch didn't escape him.

She clutched her head, whimpering, "Alexander, are you really going to let me bleed out right here?"

His attention snapped back to her.

Her face was ghostly pale, her lips nearly colorless.

He couldn't just stand there. "I'm calling an ambulance. You need medical attention."

Isabella exhaled in relief, but Evelyn pressed forward. "Did you give her our security code? Were you seriously planning to let her move in?"

Alexander opened his mouth, but Isabella cut in.

"The ambulance will take forever! Alexander, please just drive me yourself. I can't wait!"

She shot Evelyn a venomous look, her voice dripping with false innocence.

"You're so cruel! All I did was disagree with you, and you shoved me! You're delaying me on purpose—you want me to suffer!"

Evelyn didn't bother defending herself. The audacity of Isabella's performance left her speechless.

Alexander's frown deepened at Evelyn's silence. Did she really push her?

"Evelyn, just stay here. I'll be back soon."

With that, he scooped Isabella into his arms and rushed out the door.

Watching them leave, Evelyn felt a storm of emotions churning inside her.

She had planned a quiet evening for them. How had it spiraled into this?

Her stomach heavy, she mechanically grabbed a mop and began cleaning the mess—water, blood, the remnants of Isabella's theatrics.

Then she spotted it.

A small, half-hidden plastic bag in the corner.

Inside—blood.

Fake blood.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

So that's how she did it.

No wonder the blood had looked so excessive. It was all staged.

And Alexander fell for it.

She tossed the mop aside, a bitter laugh escaping her.

Why am I cleaning up this mess when I'm the one pregnant?

The thought of Isabella in their home—let alone their bed—made her nauseous.

As if sensing her distress, the baby kicked softly.

Evelyn cradled her stomach, then deliberately placed the blood bag where Alexander couldn't miss it.

She packed a small bag and walked out without looking back.

At the hospital, Isabella emerged from the ER, and Alexander paced the hallway.

The nurse called for family multiple times before he snapped back to reality.

He'd tried calling Evelyn—no answer.

Had she blocked him?

Is she really that angry?

But what was he supposed to do? Ignore Isabella bleeding on their floor?

All signs pointed to a fight between them, and he'd had to step in.

"How is she?" he asked the doctor.

"Severe head trauma. Possible concussion. She claims her vision is blurring—there's a risk of permanent damage."

Alexander glanced at Isabella, who lay still, eyes closed, the picture of fragile innocence.

As the nurse wheeled her away, he called Simon to take over.

Simon had just finished his shift and was in the middle of a very promising evening with his girlfriend.

When Alexander's name flashed on his screen, he groaned.

Not this again.

Hanging up, he muttered, "Damn it. When will this woman quit?"

His girlfriend traced his muscles with a pout. "What's wrong?"

Simon yanked his shirt back on. "Some gold-digger tried to crawl into my boss's bed and ended up in the hospital. Now I have to babysit her while he smooths things over with his wife."

She wrapped her arms around him. "Can't you just ignore it?"

Simon kissed her forehead. "Gotta keep the paycheck coming, babe. Just wait—soon, we'll have that house in Cresthaven."

Reluctantly, she let him go, glaring at the door as he left.

When Alexander finally returned home, the house was dark.

No Evelyn.

He called Lucas immediately. "Where's Claire?"

"Why do you care about Claire?" Lucas's voice was sharp.

"Is Evelyn with her?"

A pause. Then, "What's going on? Lose your wife? Well, Claire's been with me all day."

Claire had been handling their daughter's things—no contact with Evelyn.

Alexander's chest tightened.

Where was she?
###Chapter 635

Evelyn was nearly seven months pregnant.

The night was pitch black outside, the air crisp with the sudden chill of changing seasons.

Where could a pregnant woman go at this hour? Claire's place was the only logical choice.

Alexander's face darkened with worry as he stormed out, his mind racing.

He drove straight to the symphony hall—a high-security facility where no one entered without clearance. Even pulling rank didn’t sway the guard, who informed him that most musicians had left for holiday concerts, leaving the building nearly deserted.

When he realized Evelyn wasn’t there, Alexander slumped into his car, lighting cigarette after cigarette.

Blocked from her phone, he couldn’t even reach her.

Then Simon called. "Sir, Ms. Morgan is awake."

Alexander’s jaw clenched. Just the mention of Isabella’s name set his teeth on edge.

"What does that have to do with me? Call a doctor!"

Frustration sharpened his tone. Simon had picked the worst possible moment.

Simon hesitated. "She won’t stop crying. Claims she’s in pain and insists on seeing you. Nothing I say helps."

The wailing had disturbed neighboring rooms all night. Simon was at his breaking point.

"Then sedate her."

Alexander hung up with a sharp click.

He lit another cigarette, exhaling slowly.

Things were spiraling.

Since Isabella’s return, his relationship with Evelyn had been nothing but turbulence.

Maybe it was time to send Isabella away for good.

As the cigarette burned down, a thought struck him.

Hawthorne Estate.

Late that night, after leaving, Evelyn had considered a hotel.

But her doctor had been adamant—she shouldn’t be alone this far into her pregnancy, especially after her recent hospital stay.

Claire’s home was too chaotic with children.

So she took a cab to Hawthorne Estate.

Margaret was on the couch, watching TV.

When Evelyn walked in, Margaret blinked in surprise, glancing behind her. "You’re discharged? Where’s Alexander?"

Since their reconciliation, Evelyn’s old room had been kept ready.

Margaret had visited her in the hospital days prior, bringing supplements.

Evelyn slipped off her shoes. "He’s busy."

Margaret’s smile faltered at the suitcase. "Did you two fight?"

Evelyn didn’t elaborate.

Richard approached, sighing. "Men work all day. Must you bring drama home too?"

Margaret’s eyes flashed. "Richard, watch your tone. Who’s being dramatic?"

"I’m just saying—"

"Say less," Margaret snapped. "Would you react this way if it were Vanessa?"

Lately, Richard had been treading carefully.

After nearly losing Margaret to divorce, he now slept on the floor, his back stiff from months of punishment.

One wrong word, and she’d throw him out for good.

Seeing the storm brewing, Richard backed down. "Fine, my bad."

Evelyn retreated to her room, shutting the door softly.

Margaret followed, concerned. "Talk to me."

Evelyn lowered her eyes.

How could she explain such a tangled mess?

Margaret squeezed her shoulder. "Stay as long as you need. This is your home."

Half-asleep later, Evelyn heard the door creak open.

Too exhausted to react, she kept her eyes closed.

Then the mattress dipped.

Someone slid in beside her.

Her pulse spiked.

Alexander.

She clutched the blanket tighter, turning away.

No doubt Margaret had let him in.

A quiet sigh escaped her.

She focused on steadying her breathing, willing sleep to come.

But then his voice cut through the dark. "Evelyn. We need to talk."

She stayed silent, unmoving.

His hand brushed her shoulder. "Even if she provoked you, pushing her down the stairs was too far. What if she’s permanently injured? She could become our problem forever."

Evelyn’s eyes flew open.

A cold weight settled in her chest.

Had he seen the blood pack Isabella left? The whole thing was staged—yet here he was, accusing her.

She’d wanted answers. Why did Isabella know their passcode? Why was she in their bed?

But now, it didn’t matter.

Her voice trembled. "Even unharmed, she’ll always be tied to you, won’t she?"

Alexander stiffened. "How can you say that?"

"Am I wrong?" Her bitterness spilled over. "Why was I hospitalized? Because Isabella couldn’t stand me happy. Couldn’t stand our baby. You brought this into my life!"

The silence that followed was heavier than the dark.
###Chapter 636

Alexander's eyes darkened with pain. No one cared more about Evelyn and their unborn child's safety than he did.

Yet his genuine concern had been twisted into something ugly in Evelyn's mind—now she saw him as the villain who would harm them both.

In the dimly lit room, Evelyn bit her lip hard, praying Alexander wouldn't notice the tears slipping down her cheeks.

She quickly wiped them away with the edge of the blanket. "I didn't push her down those stairs. The way Isabella puts on that pitiful act, and you immediately believe her over me." Her voice cracked. "Fine, if you think I did it, then I did. I'm just that cruel. I'm not good enough for you. Just leave!"

Her chest ached, each breath sharp and uneven. She refused to let him see her break, but the injustice of it all was suffocating.

Though Evelyn had turned away, Alexander sensed her silent tears. His heart twisted.

He pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly. "Alright, it was my fault. Please don't cry."

He couldn't deny it—walking in to find blood everywhere, Isabella drenched and trembling like a wounded animal—anyone would have jumped to conclusions.

Especially after what Evelyn had suffered because of Isabella.

It wasn't unreasonable to think she might lash out.

Alexander wasn't blaming her. He was just stating the facts.

"Come on," he murmured, brushing a kiss against her temple. "I believe you."

Evelyn had the sinking feeling his words were just to placate her, not because he truly meant them.

She bit her lip harder, the misery deepening. "I want to sleep."

Alexander studied her for a long moment. Seeing her eyes closed, exhaustion weighing on her, he lay down beside her.

His voice was low, rough with emotion. "Come home with me tomorrow. I'll make sure she's gone."

With the plagiarism scandal, Isabella's reputation was in ruins. Concerts? Forget it. She'd be lucky to book small gigs.

In this industry, reputation was everything. At this point, her only option was to disappear overseas.

It was the perfect opportunity to be rid of her.

Evelyn knew better. Isabella wasn't the root of their problems—sending her away wouldn't magically fix everything.

"I'm not going back," she said stubbornly. "I'm fine here."

At least until Isabella was truly gone, she had no intention of returning to Whitmore Manor.

Alexander frowned. "Evelyn, I'm getting her out of our lives. Isn't that enough?"

Evelyn stayed silent, closing her eyes.

Pregnant and exhausted, she needed rest—for the baby’s sake.

But with Alexander beside her and the weight of everything pressing down, sleep wouldn’t come.

Her stomach growled loudly, betraying her.

In the darkness, Alexander’s warm hand slid over her belly, his touch tender.

"I'll make you pasta," he said, rising from the bed.

Evelyn huffed. "I'm not hungry. Don’t bother."

Alexander’s lips curved slightly. "Well, I am. Keep me company while I cook."

No matter how much she snapped or sulked, he never lost his patience. He always found a way to soothe her.

The room fell silent.

Evelyn absently stroked her stomach.

Maybe, for the baby’s sake, she shouldn’t let her emotions spiral.

Alexander had his own burdens—his hands were tied too.

With Isabella, it was obligation, not love.

And he was sending her away.

That thought eased the tightness in her chest.

Ten minutes later, Alexander returned.

The Hawthorne Estate was silent, everyone long asleep.

"I made shrimp pasta—your favorite."

He sat on the edge of the bed. "Come eat. Be mad at me after, but don’t starve yourself."

Evelyn’s irritation softened like butter under warmth.

Even in the middle of their fight, he was still worrying about her.

It was past 1 AM. In Cresthaven’s bitter winter nights, most CEOs weren’t awake cooking for their wives.

Evelyn wasn’t usually unreasonable.

But the hurt still lingered. "Even if I eat, it doesn’t fix anything."

Alexander smirked, finding her pout oddly endearing.

He knew exactly what was bothering her.

"Fine. Then I’ll pack my things and move into Hawthorne Estate with you."

Living apart wasn’t an option.

Too many marriages fell apart that way.

Evelyn blinked. "Since when does the husband permanently live at his wife’s parents’ house? People will call you a freeloader."

Alexander shrugged. "Let them. Lucas would kill to freeload off Claire but can’t. Besides—reputation means nothing. You matter more. Where you go, I follow."

Evelyn was speechless.

Alexander’s shamelessness was unmatched.

No wonder he’d landed a wife.

Before she could react, he scooped her into his arms.

Evelyn gasped. "What are you—?"

"If we wait any longer, the pasta will be ruined," he said simply, carrying her out.

Under the light, Alexander saw Evelyn’s red, swollen eyes.

Guilt flashed across his face. "I never expected her to show up at our place. She must’ve guessed the code."

The password was Evelyn’s birthday—not hard to figure out.

Evelyn froze.

She and Isabella weren’t close. How would she know that?

Silent, Evelyn focused on eating.

Maybe she shouldn’t keep punishing Alexander for someone else’s games.

Just then, his phone buzzed violently on the table.

He rejected the call without looking.

Evelyn saw Simon’s name.

Alexander ignored it, but seconds later, Isabella’s number flashed.

Evelyn sighed. "Just answer. She won’t stop."

Alexander picked up, voice icy. "Didn’t I say to call a doctor if there’s an issue?"

Simon sounded uneasy. "It’s complicated, sir. Ms. Morgan… she’s lost her sight. She can’t see anything."

The silence was so thick Evelyn heard every word.

Isabella had gone blind?
###Chapter 637

Isabella's sudden blindness was far too convenient.

Vanessa's first instinct was that this had to be another one of her schemes.

After all, Isabella had faked injuries before with that ridiculous blood packet. What wouldn't she do for attention?

But then again—those stairs were steep. A real fall could have caused serious damage.

Evelyn drew a slow breath, forcing herself to think rationally.

Rather than making this difficult for Alexander, she said quietly, "You should go check on her at the hospital."

Alexander's brows furrowed. "Evelyn, why are you pushing me toward another woman?"

But if she didn't suggest it, wouldn't he go anyway?

Alexander took loyalty seriously. As long as Andrew's memory lingered between them, he'd never fully cut Isabella out. Better to let him go now than have him distracted all night.

"She's causing a scene there, and Simon looks exhausted. She won't calm down until you arrive," Evelyn said before retreating to their bedroom.

The house was so quiet she could hear Alexander cleaning up in the kitchen—the clink of silverware, the running tap.

Then the front door clicked shut.

He'd left, just as she'd told him to.

Even though it had been her suggestion, an ache spread through her chest, heavy as stone.

Evelyn pulled the blankets tighter, biting her lip until she forced her eyes closed.

Alexander arrived at the hospital past 3 AM. He could hear the commotion from down the hall.

Isabella was thrashing on the hospital bed, hurling anything within reach. "Why can't I see? Where's Alexander? I need him here now!"

A nurse tried reasoning with her. "Ms. Morgan, it's the middle of the night. Other patients are complaining. If this continues, we'll have to sedate you."

The doctors had examined her but found no clear cause. Further tests would have to wait until morning.

Simon spotted Alexander and rushed over, dark circles under his eyes. "Mr. Whitmore."

At the sound of his voice, Isabella stilled.

Her hands groped blindly through the air. "Alexander? Is that you? I'm terrified—everything's black. I've gone blind!"

Isabella was baffled. She'd been fine after the ER visit. How could sleeping have stolen her sight?

This entire plan had been Vanessa's idea.

Vanessa had pointed out that with Evelyn hospitalized, Alexander was staying there instead of coming home.

Her suggestion? Have Isabella move into their house. Sleep in their bed.

What better way to humiliate Evelyn when she returned?

Isabella had hesitated, worried about Alexander's reaction.

But Vanessa had waved her off. "Worst case? He yells at you. So what?"

Isabella had figured she was right. A scolding wouldn't kill her.

Vanessa had given her the door code—suggesting Evelyn's birthday, since they shared the same date. Shockingly, it worked.

To sell the act, Isabella had brought another blood packet.

As she tumbled down the stairs, she'd spilled it strategically, leaving dramatic streaks.

She'd expected minor bruises at worst. Nothing a little rest wouldn't fix.

Never had she imagined going blind.

Blindness meant her career was over. Her life was over.

Now she was trapped in endless darkness, helpless.

Isabella had never felt such terror.

"How can I play cello like this?" she thought desperately. "Will I just waste away, waiting to die?"

Regret consumed her.

She never should have listened to Vanessa. Vanessa had risked nothing, while Isabella had lost everything.

When she heard Alexander approach, her hands flailed wildly. "Alexander? Is that you? I'm so scared. It's so dark—I can't see anything!"

Alexander stepped closer, waving a hand before her eyes.

No reaction.

Isabella seized his wrist like a lifeline. "I'm useless now. What's the point of living?"

Alexander studied her for a long moment before speaking. "The doctor said this could be temporary. Your sight might return any day."

Isabella's voice broke. "When? They don't know, do they? They're just saying that!"

Tears streamed down her face. She couldn't see Alexander's expression—couldn't read him at all.

She clung to him, trying to press against his chest. "It was Evelyn! She pushed me! You have to make this right!"

Alexander stiffened, pulling back—but Isabella's grip was iron.

At the accusation, his voice turned icy. "I haven't asked yet. Why were you in our house?"

After the orchestra incident, he'd arranged an apartment for her—thirty minutes from his home.

Isabella froze. She hadn't expected interrogation now.

Alexander's tone was relentless. "Tell me the truth. Did Evelyn push you, or is this another act?"

Isabella's pulse spiked, but she took comfort in one fact: no security cameras.

She doubled down, tears flowing freely. "Why would I jump to frame her? Look at me! I'm blind!"

Her weeping wasn't entirely fake. She was genuinely shattered.

Alexander held out tissues—but Isabella, oblivious, didn't take them.

Exhaustion weighed on him. He massaged his temples.

The night was too long for this.

Finally, he spoke softly. "Isabella, I'm sending you abroad. The best doctors will treat your eyes."
###Chapter 638

Sending Isabella away appeared to be the wisest decision. It would give Evelyn peace during her pregnancy. But Isabella froze, her face twisting in shock. "Alexander, are you abandoning me?"

"I'm not abandoning you," Alexander explained, his voice steady. "I'm arranging specialized treatment abroad for you."

"Is it because I'm blind now?" Her voice cracked. "You think I'm useless, so you're using this as an excuse to discard me?"

"Don't be ridiculous," Alexander frowned, irritated by her dramatics. "This is for your own good. What orchestra would take you in your current state?"

Seeing her tears, he softened his tone. "You don’t have to decide now. Take time to think."

"Alexander, where are you going?" Panic laced her words as she sensed him moving. "Don’t leave me! I’ll answer now—I won’t go! I want to stay with you!"

Her fingers clutched at the air blindly. "I’m terrified to go alone when I can’t see. Unless… you come with me."

"That’s impossible," he said flatly.

"Then I refuse." Her voice was steel.

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, he relented. "Fine. We’ll arrange treatment here. Rest now."

"You’re really leaving me alone in this state?" she snapped.

She knew how he’d stayed by Evelyn’s side during her pregnancy complications. She wanted the same devotion.

It was nearly dawn, and Alexander hadn’t slept. Work awaited him in a few hours.

A dull ache pulsed in his temples. He massaged them. "Just sleep."

"And you?"

"I’ll stay."

That seemed to placate her.

Exhaustion must have claimed her, because soon, her breathing evened out.

Simon entered quietly, sympathy in his gaze. "Mr. Whitmore, there’s a couch. You should rest too."

Alexander’s thoughts were with Evelyn. He’d only meant to check on Isabella briefly.

But if she woke and found him gone, another meltdown was inevitable. He had no choice but to stay.

"Simon, I appreciate your help tonight. Once this is settled, you’ll be compensated."

Simon nodded.

Dealing with Isabella was exhausting. But compared to Alexander’s predicament, he had it easy.

He was just an employee. Alexander was trapped in this nightmare with no escape.

Sunlight spilled through the curtains when Evelyn woke.

The other side of the bed was cold. Alexander hadn’t returned.

A hollow ache settled in her chest.

Her phone buzzed—a message from Leonard, inviting her to a celebratory dinner.

Given her pregnancy, it would be intimate—just Leonard and Natalie.

Though modest, the real purpose was introducing her to Natalie, her senior colleague.

Staying home meant drowning in dark thoughts. She accepted.

The restaurant was an exclusive private kitchen, discreet and elegant.

Leonard and Natalie were already seated when she arrived.

"Evelyn! Over here." Leonard beamed. "This is Natalie Riley—though I doubt introductions are necessary. The legendary cellist needs no introduction."

"Pleasure to meet you, Natalie." Evelyn presented her carefully chosen gift—a vintage record player, perfect for a musician.

Natalie chuckled. "So formal! Now I feel guilty arriving empty-handed. Leonard will scold me."

"You lent me your strings before the competition. This is the least I could do."

"Then I’ll have to return the favor," Natalie teased.

"Enough chatter—let’s order," Leonard interjected, noting the shadows under Evelyn’s eyes. "Trouble sleeping?"

Not insomnia. Just… unease.

She’d dreamed of bloodied hands dragging her into darkness, only to wake at dawn.

With Isabella’s situation looming, she didn’t elaborate.

Natalie cleared her throat. "Evelyn, we invited you not just to celebrate, but because a colleague wants to purchase the rights to your winning piece."

Evelyn blinked. Several agencies had approached her during her hospital stay, but she’d hesitated, unsure of industry pitfalls.

Natalie smiled. "Don’t worry. I’d never steer you wrong. Just sign the authorization, and the royalties will follow."

Evelyn glanced at Leonard for confirmation.

He nodded. "Natalie’s connections are invaluable. Exchange contacts—you’ll need them."

Trusting them, Evelyn agreed. "Of course. For you, I’ll authorize it."

Natalie produced a contract seamlessly. "Perfect. Just sign here."

Evelyn skimmed the terms—nothing alarming—and signed.

The payment hit her account before dessert arrived.

She counted the zeros. Six.

The windfall lifted her spirits.

Emboldened, she called Alexander.

His phone was off.

She tried Titan Capital’s executive office.

Natalie Brooks answered. "Titan Capital Executive Office. How may I help you?"

"It’s Evelyn," she said quietly. "Is Alexander there?"

"Evelyn!" Natalie’s voice warmed. "Long time! Congratulations on the pregnancy! Oh—Mr. Whitmore? He’s not in today. Didn’t he tell you?"

Evelyn’s stomach dropped.

It was already afternoon.

Had Alexander been with Isabella this entire time?
###Chapter 639

Evelyn's brows knitted together as she made up her mind to visit the hospital.

She needed to see with her own eyes what game Isabella was playing - whether her blindness was genuine or just another manipulative act.

At the medical center, she tiptoed to the doorway of the private ward.

Through the glass panel, she spotted Alexander sitting on the sofa beside the hospital bed, typing away on his laptop.

Isabella lay motionless on the bed, seemingly asleep.

Evelyn observed quietly from the hallway, relieved to see Alexander maintaining a respectful distance from the patient.

"Mrs. Whitmore..." Simon's voice suddenly echoed through the corridor.

The sound must have alerted those inside, because Alexander immediately turned his head.

The moment their eyes met, he set down his laptop and strode toward her. "Why are you lurking out here without telling me you've arrived?" Alexander frowned, capturing Evelyn's chilled fingers between his palms. "How long have you been standing there?"

The autumn winds had turned bitter, leaving Evelyn's hands icy.

He cradled them gently, transferring his warmth through the contact.

Evelyn glanced sideways into the hospital room and whispered, "Just arrived. How is she?"

Alexander sighed. "Tests this morning showed everything normal except her vision. The doctors suspect optic nerve damage from her fall." The uncertainty of the diagnosis complicated treatment.

Evelyn noticed the fatigue lining Alexander's bloodshot eyes.

"Did you sleep at all last night?" she asked.

Before he could respond, Simon interjected, "Mr. Whitmore maintained perfect propriety! Refused to share the room with Ms. Morgan. Spent the entire night reviewing contracts on that tiny sofa." Though a fold-out bed had been available, Alexander had chosen the uncomfortable couch.

Simon added under his breath, "Ms. Morgan's been impossible. She checks for Mr. Whitmore every thirty minutes. If he steps out, she starts hurling medical equipment."

"This morning when Mr. Whitmore used the restroom, she woke up and caused such a scene they had to sedate her," he continued, explaining why Alexander couldn't leave.

Evelyn withdrew her hands from Alexander's grasp.

She lifted her chin. "If she never recovers, do you plan to let her cling to you indefinitely?"

"Of course not," Alexander responded immediately. "She's struggling to adjust to sudden blindness. Give it a few days." Evelyn's bitter laugh cut through the sterile air. "So I should just surrender you to her for 'a few days'?" Alexander's grip tightened. "Evelyn, you're twisting my words."

A lead weight settled in Evelyn's chest.

"I left Ethan because he kept choosing Vanessa over me. How are you different?"

Evelyn's fists clenched until her knuckles bleached white.

She blinked back stinging tears, refusing to cry here.

She knew Alexander differed fundamentally from Ethan.

Ethan had betrayed her love willfully, while Alexander was trapped by circumstance.

Yet the pain felt identical.

As if sensing her distress, the baby fluttered against her womb - a tiny foot or hand brushing her from within.

Evelyn cradled her bump protectively.

She would be a mother soon. She needed strength.

Besides, her thriving career meant she didn't need any man's support.

"Fine," she said coldly. "Stay with Isabella. Clearly my feelings mean nothing. I'll have divorce papers drawn up immediately." She turned to leave.

Alexander seized her wrist, pulling her against his chest. "Don't be absurd. I would never divorce you."

The comparison to Ethan lacerated him.

He'd made mistakes, yes.

But never intentionally.

Alexander crushed her closer. "Give me time to resolve this properly. Be angry, but never mention divorce again."

He loved this woman desperately. After fighting so hard to make her his wife, how could she think he'd let her go?

Isabella was an unexpected complication - one he hadn't anticipated becoming so... unhinged.

His voice roughened. "She won't come between us forever. I'll handle this."

Though Alexander's embrace felt like sanctuary, Evelyn's heart remained leaden. Logically, she should leave and raise her child alone.

But emotionally, she couldn't sever their bond.

Alexander had been her protector when her own family abandoned her.

He'd patiently dismantled her defenses until she dared to hope for a real home.

Their love was genuine.

If Alexander had truly betrayed her like Ethan, she'd walk away without hesitation.

But this was different.

His involvement with Isabella stemmed from obligation, not affection. His frustration mirrored her own.

Evelyn's lashes lowered.

Why let Isabella destroy what they'd built?

The scheming woman didn't deserve that victory.

The more Isabella tried to divide them, the more determined Evelyn became to stand firm.

"Alexander..." Isabella's plaintive voice floated from the room.

Evelyn peered inside.

Isabella flailed blindly, nearly toppling from the bed. "Alexander! Where are you?" When no answer came, her voice turned frantic. "Have you abandoned me too?"

Alexander instinctively looked to Evelyn.

Seeing her silent observation, he remained rooted in place.

Satisfied by his hesitation, Evelyn pushed the door open. Alexander moved to stop her, fearing Isabella might harm herself - or Evelyn - in her agitated state. But after a beat, he followed.

Blind and hearing no response, Isabella grew increasingly distressed.

As she tried climbing from bed, her foot caught in the sheets, sending her pitching forward.

Evelyn caught her just before impact.

Isabella immediately clung to her, burying her face in what she assumed was Alexander's chest. "Alexander! You terrified me! I thought you'd left!" Evelyn's brow arched.

She'd mistaken her for Alexander? Was the blindness real?
###Chapter 640

Evelyn rested her head against Alexander's shoulder, her intentions unmistakably flirtatious.

Dominic didn't push her away. Instead, he matched her soft tone. "I'm not your Alexander. I'm Alexander's wife, Evelyn. You can call me Dominic." Isabella froze.

After several seconds of confusion, her hands instinctively groped until they brushed against Dominic's chest.

That's when realization struck - she'd embraced the wrong person.

She recoiled from Dominic in disgust. "Dominic, what are you doing here? Are you enjoying ruining my life?"

"Oh yes, how did you guess?"

Dominic settled onto the sofa, fixing Isabella with a steady gaze. "So happy that I treated myself to an entire lobster lunch today. Simply divine." Isabella's brows knitted together. "You're eating lobster? After blinding me? While I suffer here, you're..."

She couldn't fathom Dominic dining luxuriously while she languished.

Isabella's expression turned icy. "Dominic, you won't get away with this!"

"Well, here I sit before you. What exactly do you plan to do about it?"

Isabella swiped at the air several times, failing to reach Dominic, her chest heaving with rage.

She found Dominic utterly contemptible, certain this visit was solely to mock her misfortune.

Knowing Alexander stood nearby, Isabella pleaded, "Alexander, will you just stand there while she torments me?"

As Alexander opened his mouth, Dominic gently squeezed his palm. "Darling, you haven't slept since last night. Go home and rest. I'll handle things here." Alexander hesitated. Dominic wanted to take charge.

Isabella protested, "No, don't leave! Once you're gone, she'll torture me worse!"

Dominic chuckled. "Perhaps. But tell me, why should Alexander protect you, a stranger, over me, his wife?"

That silenced Isabella.

Blind and helpless, she could only stand there impotently.

Defeated in argument, Isabella prepared another tantrum.

But after last night's episode, all breakable items had been removed.

Now the room contained only a bed and sofa - both too heavy for Isabella to damage.

Dominic's voice turned glacial. "You'll reimburse every item broken since last night."

"Neighboring rooms have complained three times already. Continue causing disturbances if you wish, but don't be surprised when evicted, with no other hospital accepting you." "Empty threats!" Isabella snapped. "Alexander would never abandon me!"

"Don't be so certain." Dominic's words shattered Isabella's hope with surgical precision.

Dominic continued, "If Alexander tires of your theatrics, he might deposit you on the streets. Then what? Where would a blind woman even search for him?" Isabella couldn't endure another word.

She felt her way to bed and burrowed beneath the blankets.

Isabella calculated Dominic couldn't stay indefinitely. She'd be gone upon waking.

Seeing Isabella finally subdued, Dominic exited the hospital room.

Alexander followed, gently taking her hand and interlacing their fingers.

This was his first glimpse of this side of Dominic, and he had to admit - Dominic impressed him.

Isabella had plagued him since last night, yet Dominic silenced her with mere words.

"You're no longer angry with me?"

"Who said that? I'm still furious." She withdrew her hand. "Thank your unborn child. I'm only granting this chance for the baby. Don't waste it." Alexander smiled, gently cradling Dominic's belly.

Kneeling before her, he gazed at her stomach and whispered, "Thank you, little one."

Dominic studied the man before her.

Alexander's lowered lashes caught sunlight from the window, his golden hair gleaming, his gaze impossibly tender.

Without thought, Dominic traced Alexander's brows and eyes, feeling her heart soften.

Perhaps because she'd just put Isabella through hell, Dominic felt remarkably cheerful.

She concluded creating hell proved better than internal torment.

Why suffer alone?

If misery demanded company, she'd ensure Isabella developed stress-induced nodules!

"I'll stay at Hawthorne Estate awhile," Dominic murmured.

She knew returning home to Alexander's absence would only breed endless worry.

"Alexander, no woman takes this lightly, but I'll trust you this once. I believe you'll handle this properly. Please don't disappoint me." Her voice cracked. Alexander's heart ached. He immediately stood, drawing her into his arms.

His lips brushed her hair.

He murmured, "I know this situation wrongs you. Give me five... no, three days! Then I'll come to Hawthorne Estate to bring you home."

"Who says I want to return with you?" Dominic punched his chest, squirming free.

Alexander released her, smiling. "Fine. If you won't come home with me, I'll move into Hawthorne Estate. I'll be your live-in husband instead."

Nearby, Nathaniel sat in his wheelchair, observing the scene.

Beside him, Nathaniel held his breath, monitoring Nathaniel's expression. "Mr. Powell... please remain calm."

Learning of Isabella's blindness, Nathaniel had rushed over mid-rehabilitation, fearing Dominic's heartbreak.

He never expected to find them embracing.

Nathaniel pressed his tongue to his cheek, heart filled with unprecedented bitterness.

His voice thickened. "Nothing to see here. Let's go."

Nathaniel asked reflexively, "Back to therapy then?"

"Cancel therapy!" Nathaniel commanded from his wheelchair.

Nathaniel froze, eyes darting to Nathaniel's legs. "But Mr. Powell, your treatment isn't complete..."

Nathaniel scoffed, "What does it matter if I'm crippled? I've no wife! No one cares if I live or die!" Meanwhile, Dominic and Alexander separated.

Dominic entered the elevator, apparently departing.

Seeing Nathaniel's state, Nathaniel took initiative. "Ms. Carter, wait!"

He rushed toward the elevator, pushing the wheelchair inside just as doors closed... leaving himself outside. Nathaniel called, "Ms. Carter, an emergency! Please watch Mr. Powell for me!" Nathaniel hadn't anticipated this maneuver.

As the elevator descended, Nathaniel couldn't remain indefinitely.

After hesitation, Dominic wheeled him out.

Nathaniel spoke unexpectedly, "Dealing with Isabella wouldn't be difficult."

Dominic turned.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "I could marry her, keep her home, making her existence miserable daily. Would that satisfy your vengeance?" They were already engaged; marriage required only Nathaniel's word.

Dominic pierced him with a look before turning away. "How tedious!"

Nathaniel watched her retreat, smirking. "Can't bear me marrying another, can you?"

Bathed in sunset's glow, he nearly disappeared in blinding light.

"I've dirt on her," he said cryptically. "Flatter me, and I might share it. How's that?"
###Chapter 641

The crisp autumn air carried a faint medicinal scent through the hospital courtyard. Evelyn Carter tightened her cashmere scarf against the chill, her breath forming small clouds in the cold air.

"What could Dominic possibly have on Isabella?" The question gnawed at Evelyn's mind like a persistent insect.

She studied Dominic Powell's face carefully. Despite his usual mocking grin, his eyes held an unusual intensity that suggested he wasn't bluffing.

They were engaged. Could Dominic truly possess some damning secret about Isabella Morgan?

Though Evelyn harbored no affection for Isabella, she had no desire to exploit anyone's vulnerabilities. That wasn't her style.

With an icy stare, Evelyn turned away. "Keep your secrets. I'm not interested."

She took three decisive steps toward the exit before Dominic's voice stopped her.

"Are you absolutely certain you don't want to know?" His tone carried an odd mixture of amusement and warning.

Evelyn didn't bother turning around, simply waving a dismissive hand.

"Alexander left me in your care," Dominic called after her, his voice suddenly sharp. "And you'd abandon a disabled man here? How heartless."

The afternoon sunlight filtered through thinning maple leaves, casting dappled shadows across Evelyn's slender frame.

She spun on her heel. "You're Dominic Powell. The man who always settles scores. What could possibly happen to you?"

Everyone knew about Dominic's leg injury from his altercation with Sebastian Powell.

Evelyn had heard the recent gossip. Sebastian had taken a nasty fall during a countryside horseback ride two days prior.

Not only had he broken his arm, but the stallion had delivered a vicious kick to his ribs.

Sebastian had coughed up blood at the scene, barely escaping with his life.

As someone familiar with elite riding clubs, Evelyn knew their horses underwent rigorous vet checks.

What were the odds Sebastian would randomly select the one deranged horse?

The timing was too perfect. Knowing Dominic's vengeful nature, Evelyn had little doubt about his involvement.

The Powell brothers shared blood but behaved like sworn enemies, their rivalry bordering on lethal.

Dominic's dark eyes locked onto Evelyn's as he wheeled closer.

"Well, well," he murmured, tilting his head with that infuriating smirk. "Seems you've got me all figured out, darling."

Sebastian's injury had forced the postponement of his upcoming wedding to Victoria Clarke.

Terrible luck for the couple, their nuptials delayed twice now - first when Victoria was mysteriously abducted, and now this.

Whispers circulated that the pair might be cursed, their union doomed before it began.

Some even claimed the Clarke family was reconsidering the marriage entirely.

"Yes, I arranged Sebastian's accident," Dominic admitted casually, seeing she'd already connected the dots.

His smile turned glacial. "Consider it mercy. I could have killed him."

Evelyn's gaze hardened. "Your father tolerates your squabbles, but do you think he'll stand by if one of you ends up dead?"

She turned to leave again when Dominic's hand shot out, capturing her wrist.

His thumb traced slow circles on her pulse point, the rough pad of his finger sending unwelcome shivers up her arm.

Evelyn tried to pull away, but Dominic's grip was unyielding.

"Concerned for my safety?" he purred. "If you care this much, darling, doesn't that prove your feelings?"

Evelyn's nostrils flared. "You're insufferable!"

"Perhaps," Dominic conceded. "But tell me - what's so special about Alexander? He spent the night with Isabella, and you just forgive him? How pathetic."

His grip tightened. "Aren't you jealous? Don't you want to leave him? Or do you enjoy the pain?"

"My marriage is none of your concern."

Evelyn believed in working through marital issues privately, without outside interference.

"None of my business?" Dominic's eyes darkened dangerously, his patience visibly thinning.

"You're too close to see the truth! When he breaks your heart, remember my offer. I'd make an excellent father to your child."

Evelyn finally wrenched free as a gust of wind whipped her hair across her face.

Without another word, she strode from the hospital grounds.

When Nathaniel Powell found Dominic later, the courtyard was littered with cigarette butts.

Nathaniel had deliberately delayed his return, hoping to give them privacy.

Judging by the scene before him, their conversation hadn't gone well.

"Mr. Powell," Nathaniel ventured cautiously, "shall we return home?"

Dominic exhaled a plume of smoke, fixing Nathaniel with a venomous glare. "Who gave you permission to meddle?"

Nathaniel remained silent.

"You'll face consequences for this," Dominic snapped.

Nathaniel's shoulders slumped.

Caught in the crossfire indeed.

Meanwhile, Alexander Whitmore's phone chimed with several incoming images.

An anonymous number had sent photos of Evelyn - with Dominic Powell.

The images showed them in what appeared to be a heated exchange outside a hospital, even holding hands at one point.

Alexander's jaw tightened, an unfamiliar rage simmering in his chest.

He immediately responded: [Identify yourself. What's your game?]

No reply came.

Alexander glanced at Isabella resting in the hospital bed.

Were she not blind, Isabella would be the obvious suspect.

But she'd been asleep since Evelyn left, with no means of contacting anyone.

Besides, her blindness made such scheming nearly impossible.

The sender's motive was clear - to drive a wedge between him and Evelyn. But who?

And since when had Evelyn and Dominic become so... familiar?

For the first time, Alexander understood exactly how Evelyn must have felt seeing him with Isabella.

He wanted to call Evelyn immediately, but just then, Isabella stirred.

"Alexander," she murmured, her voice trembling slightly, "is Evelyn gone?"

Alexander pocketed his phone as Isabella attempted to rise.

When she nearly toppled, he instinctively steadied her. "She's left."

Isabella relaxed slightly. "I'm hungry. Will you feed me?"

Alexander neither agreed nor refused. "What would you like?"

"Anything, as long as it's from you."

At that moment, Simon Graves entered with a tray of oatmeal.

He set up the bed tray efficiently. "Ms. Morgan, your meal."

Isabella's face twisted in displeasure. "I want Alexander to do it."

Simon glanced uncertainly at Alexander.

"Simon has plenty of experience caring for others," Alexander said smoothly. "He'll attend to you properly."

Simon barely suppressed a grimace.
###Chapter 642

A tense silence filled the hospital room.

Simon Graves lifted a spoonful of oatmeal toward Isabella Morgan's lips.

Isabella turned her face away stubbornly, refusing the offering.

"Alexander," she whined, batting her eyelashes. "Could you feed me instead? Simon makes me uncomfortable."

Simon's grip tightened on the spoon. "Ms. Morgan, it's just oatmeal. Does the hand holding the spoon really matter that much?" His voice dripped with sarcasm. "Or does it magically taste better when Mr. Whitmore feeds you?"

Isabella countered sharply, "Don't you have a girlfriend, Simon? Won't she mind you spoon-feeding another woman?"

"This is strictly professional," Simon retorted, glancing at Alexander. "Mr. Whitmore promised me a bonus for this."

His eyes narrowed as he added, "Besides, Mr. Whitmore is married. You're worried about my girlfriend, but not about his wife?" Isabella bit her lip, falling silent.

She'd interacted with Simon enough to recognize his loyalty to Evelyn Carter. The man always found ways to defend her!

Still determined, she turned pleading eyes toward Alexander. "Please, Alexander? Just this once?"

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Enough. If you refuse to eat, you'll only hurt yourself." His meaning was clear - no special treatment.

Frustration bubbled in Isabella's chest, but hunger won out.

Fine. She'd eat. No point starving herself over pride!

As Isabella reluctantly accepted the oatmeal, Alexander stepped into the hallway to make a call.

For days, he'd been contacting the nation's top ophthalmologists.

This situation couldn't continue. Perhaps a specialist team could improve Isabella's condition.

Back in the room, Isabella had barely swallowed two bites when something extraordinary happened.

Where darkness had reigned, a sudden flash of light appeared.

Then, gradually, her surroundings came into focus...

Could she... see again?

Isabella froze, blinking rapidly.

Her first instinct was to turn toward Simon, the closest person.

He held the oatmeal bowl with obvious reluctance, his expression sour enough to curdle milk.

Clearly, he resented every moment of this task.

Isabella swallowed her irritation - she couldn't exactly snap at him now.

Looking down at her hands, certainty flooded her.

She could see! But was this temporary?

Why had her vision returned so suddenly?

After a moment's thought, Isabella decided to keep pretending.

Blindness had its advantages - it kept Alexander by her side these past days.

Familiarity breeds affection, after all. Given enough time, surely Alexander would develop feelings for her.

When Alexander returned, he announced, "I've arranged for a specialist team. They'll examine you in the coming days."

Isabella clutched her blanket, letting her gaze wander aimlessly. "Are they good doctors?"

Alexander nodded, then remembered. "The best in the country," he confirmed verbally.

A flicker of worry crossed Isabella's face.

Would these experts discover her deception?

Midnight found Isabella asleep, allowing Alexander to leave the room.

He dialed Evelyn's number.

Evelyn lay in bed, classical music drifting through her headphones - perfect for prenatal relaxation.

Seeing Alexander's call, she answered immediately. "Yes?"

"You met with Dominic this afternoon?"

A soft "mm-hmm" preceded her curious question. "How did you know?"

"Someone sent me photos of you two together."

Evelyn stiffened. "Were we holding hands?"

"Yes."

"Are you jealous?"

"Very."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. Someone had photographed her encounter with Dominic and sent it to Alexander.

Who would do such a thing?

Not Isabella... could it be Dominic himself?

Her prolonged silence prompted Alexander's low voice. "Evelyn, has Dominic stolen you from me?"

Evelyn dreaded conflict between Alexander and Dominic.

Dominic was unpredictable - if he could betray his own brother, what might he do to Alexander?

In a battle between rule-follower Alexander and ruthless Dominic, Evelyn feared for her husband's safety.

"It was just a chance meeting outside the hospital," she explained softly. "The photos must show misleading angles."

"Really?" Alexander's voice remained deep. "But—"

"Alexander," Evelyn interrupted firmly, "I'm your wife. You need to trust me."

Several seconds of silence followed. Of course he trusted her.

Trust formed the foundation of their relationship.

As Evelyn had given him her trust, he would give his in return.

"Did you eat dinner?" he asked suddenly.

Evelyn hesitated. Preoccupied, she'd barely touched her food.

Hawthorne Estate's cooking no longer suited her palate after so long away.

Her silence spoke volumes.

Through the phone, Evelyn heard wind rushing past Alexander.

Then his breathing quickened.

"What are you doing?" she asked sharply.

"Be ready in twenty minutes. Open the door at Hawthorne Estate."

Evelyn frowned in confusion.

"I'm bringing you a midnight snack," Alexander explained.

She checked the time - already midnight.

The hospital to Hawthorne Estate was a thirty-minute drive at least.

"I already ate," she protested. "Don't trouble yourself. Get some rest instead."

He'd been up all night yesterday.

"Wait for me." Two simple words, then he nearly hung up.

Evelyn curled her fingers. "What if Isabella wakes and needs you? Won't she throw another tantrum?"

Alexander's rapid breathing filled the line.

His deep voice resonated through the receiver. "Evelyn, nothing else matters. You're my wife."
###Chapter 643

Twenty minutes after ending the call, anticipating Alexander's arrival, Evelyn crept downstairs to unlock the front door.

The instant the door cracked open, she was swept into Alexander's arms.

His chest heaved against hers, his breath ragged. He must have sprinted from his car.

"Forgive me for making you wait," he murmured into her hair, his embrace tightening.

She hadn't waited long at all.

A drive that typically took half an hour had been slashed to twenty minutes. Concerned about the chill, Alexander guided Evelyn upstairs immediately. Once in the bedroom, he produced a neatly wrapped sandwich from his coat. "Most places were closed. Try this. If it's not to your liking, I can cook something fresh."

The sandwich still radiated warmth, freshly grilled.

Evelyn took a bite. It was perfect.

Alexander perched on the edge of the bed, watching her devour it.

"How's our little one behaving?" His gaze dropped to her belly, now noticeably rounded beneath her thin nightgown. Her slender frame and winter coats had concealed it in public, but here, the evidence of her pregnancy was undeniable.

He pressed his ear to her stomach.

"I read that in the third trimester, the baby's movements can cause discomfort," he said, listening intently.

As if responding, a tiny kick pressed against his ear.

"Was that—?" Alexander's palm cradled her bump, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Behave. Don't trouble your mother." Evelyn couldn't suppress a smile.

No sooner had she finished eating than Alexander, like a magician, produced a bottle of milk.

He warmed it, inserted a straw, and held it to her lips.

She took a sip. Perfect temperature.

"Too cold?" He sipped from the same straw, then nodded. "Just right."

His attentiveness softened the edges of her lingering resentment.

Then, his phone rang.

At this hour, there was no mystery about the caller.

Alexander declined the call, but within minutes, it rang again.

Evelyn lowered her lashes. "You should go back to her."

"I've arranged for specialists. They'll handle her treatment."

She nodded.

"Once they're done, I'll return to you immediately."

Their anniversary was mere days away.

A year had slipped by since their wedding day. Alexander pulled her close, his stubble grazing her shoulder.

His lips brushed her ear, warm and lingering.

"I hate being away from you," he confessed.

The phone rang again—Isabella growing increasingly frantic.

Evelyn glanced at the clock. 2 AM.

When Alexander ignored it, she plucked the phone from his pocket and answered.

Isabella's saccharine voice dripped through the line. "Alexander, where are you? I can't sleep without you."

Evelyn's reply was honeyed. "Oh? Can't sleep? Shall I come tuck you in instead?"

The moment Isabella recognized Evelyn's voice, her tone curdled.

"You? Where's Alexander?"

"Who else would it be? It's 2 AM, and we're married. Naturally, he's with me." Evelyn's voice was light, almost amused.

"He won't be coming tonight. We just finished an... exhausting session. Your Alexander is sound asleep beside me. Be considerate, won't you?"

Isabella's breath hitched audibly.

Then, a venomous snap: "Careful, Evelyn. Wouldn't want to lose two lives instead of one."

Alexander snatched the phone.

"Isabella, apologize. Now."

Silence. Then, a sudden flood of tears.

"Apologize? What about my pain? Who apologizes to me?" Her voice fractured. "I'm blind because of her! If I lash out, isn't that normal? You've abandoned me here—what if something happens?"

Alexander massaged his temples.

Evelyn cut in. "Isabella, what could possibly happen while you're lying in bed?"

"I need to use the bathroom! Who'll carry me if Alexander isn't here?"

Evelyn's breath stalled.

A cold wave crashed over her.

Had Alexander been... helping her these past days?

Her chest constricted.

Alexander interjected. "There's a nurse for that."

"But she's a stranger! It's embarrassing!"

Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Then hold it."

She ended the call, Isabella's voice severed mid-whine.

The warmth from Alexander's midnight snack had evaporated.

Now, looking at him made her chest ache.

She burrowed under the covers, turning away.

"Go help her. I'm going to sleep."

Alexander exhaled sharply, frustration tightening his jaw.
###Chapter 644

"Evelyn, are you overthinking again? Did you misunderstand something?"

Alexander gently placed his hand on Evelyn's shoulder.

After past experiences, he knew better than to let misunderstandings linger. They needed to be addressed immediately.

Otherwise, they would fester, creating distance between them.

Besides, he couldn’t bear the thought of Evelyn drowning in negative thoughts. But she refused to turn and face him.

In one swift motion, he shrugged off his jacket and climbed onto the bed.

He pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly.

"You really believe her nonsense? Do you think I’d actually escort her to the bathroom? Have some faith in me." Evelyn’s cheeks were still flushed with anger. His words did little to soothe her wounded pride.

"Just go back to her. I need to rest."

After all, he would have to leave tonight anyway.

"I’m not going anywhere."

Alexander pulled Evelyn closer, his lips grazing her cheek. "I’m staying right here with you, Evelyn. I can’t be without you."

Their bodies were pressed so close.

Evelyn suddenly became aware of the shift in Alexander’s breathing.

She froze, not daring to move.

She knew exactly what that meant.

Alexander exhaled shakily as his lips brushed the delicate skin of her neck.

Due to her pregnancy, he had been restraining himself for months.

Now, with the woman he loved in his arms...

The tension between them only grew.

Unable to resist any longer, he turned Evelyn to face him, cupped her face, and kissed her deeply.

Alexander’s phone was off. No interruptions this time.

Caught off guard, Evelyn’s pulse raced as her fingers curled into the sheets.

She whispered against his lips, "Alexander... I’m pregnant."

"I know," he murmured, his voice rough.

His lips moved tenderly over hers as he whispered, "Just kisses. Nothing more."

Though he kept his word, the room grew warmer with each passing second...

They stayed wrapped in each other, respecting boundaries but indulging in intimacy.

Evelyn rested against Alexander’s bare chest, her cheeks burning.

His shirt was open, his arms secure around her.

She was just as affected—she couldn’t even meet his gaze.

Alexander took her hand gently.

"Evelyn."

She stayed silent.

His voice was thick with emotion. "This is all because of you. Do you have any idea how much I’ve missed you?"

Moonlight spilled through the window, illuminating his sharp features.

While Evelyn’s face was flushed with embarrassment, Alexander’s eyes held a playful glint, completely at ease.

He held her hand firmly.

At this moment, his presence was intoxicating.

Beads of sweat dotted his forehead as his breathing grew uneven, his whispers hot against her ear.

To Evelyn, it all felt like a dream.

When Alexander finally pulled away and strode to the bathroom, she buried her face in the pillows, overwhelmed.

Even with her pregnancy, he always found ways to show his love.

Ten minutes later, he emerged, skin still damp from the shower.

Evelyn had already turned away, pretending to sleep.

Alexander wrapped his arms around her from behind.

With a content sigh, he murmured, "My love."

Evelyn made a sleepy sound, feigning drowsiness.

After their intimate moment, she felt too shy to face him.

Alexander saw through her act but didn’t call her out.

Instead, he just held her closer and whispered, "I love you so much."

His lips brushed the nape of her neck.

His warm breath tickled her ear.

Even with her back turned, she could picture the tenderness in his eyes.

Alexander must have worn that same sincere expression when he spoke those words.

Evelyn’s heart pounded so hard she feared it might leap from her chest.

She had fallen completely for him.

Exhausted from the night’s events, Alexander drifted off moments later.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her racing heart.

She knew it—she was utterly, hopelessly in love.

She had lost herself completely.

Oh, dear...

Evelyn knew Alexander had left at midnight, his phone turned off. She assumed he was at the hospital, worried about complications. He’d held her all night but slipped away at dawn.

In her dreams, a haunting melody had woven through her mind—so beautiful she could still recall it perfectly.

She sat at her desk, jotting down the notes, planning to develop it into a full composition later.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. The maid called her to breakfast.

Margaret had already left, off to play cards with her friends.

At the dining table, only Evelyn and Richard remained.

"Just wait. Your sister will be here soon," Richard said.

Evelyn frowned. Vanessa was coming too?

Minutes later, the door opened, and the maid ushered Vanessa inside, arms laden with gift bags.

"Dad, I brought these supplements for you and Mom. They’re excellent for your health."

Richard beamed with satisfaction before abruptly turning to Evelyn.

"Evelyn, you should learn from your sister. We raised you both for over twenty years. The least you could do is show some gratitude."

When Evelyn had arrived at Hawthorne Estate that night, she’d only carried a single suitcase. Seven months pregnant, she’d been lucky to make it home safely.

Buying supplements had been the last thing on her mind.

Evelyn caught the sarcasm in Richard’s tone.

She gave him a cool look. "What should I learn from Vanessa? How to steal another woman’s fiancé? How to abandon your mother for fame? Or how to act shamelessly?"

"How dare you speak about your sister like that?" Richard’s face darkened with anger.

"Did I say anything untrue?" Evelyn blinked innocently. "Point out my mistakes, and I’ll correct them."

Richard was left speechless.

Vanessa, far from offended, played peacemaker. "Evelyn, I know you have misunderstandings about me, but it takes two to tango. Yes, Ethan fell for me, and you got hurt—but are you completely blameless?"

Classic victim-blaming.

Evelyn had no patience for word games.

She sat down, picked up a shrimp, and placed it on her plate, peeling it slowly.

Further along in her pregnancy, she’d been constantly hungry. After last night’s drama, and with it already noon, she was starving.

Richard watched her eat and snapped, "Where are your manners? Your sister and I haven’t even sat down yet, and you’re already eating."

"How can you compare yourself to me? I’m seven months pregnant—are you?" Evelyn gave Richard’s protruding stomach a pointed glance. "Yours is just fat. No wonder you can handle being hungry."
###Chapter 645

Alexander froze, needing a full three seconds to process Evelyn's words.

When realization struck, his gaze immediately dropped to his midsection.

Was his waistline truly that noticeable?

Then again, wasn't some weight gain expected for a man in his fifties?

Vanessa, standing nearby, pressed her lips together to suppress a laugh at Evelyn's blunt observation.

But seeing Alexander's stormy expression, she quickly composed herself. "Evelyn, you shouldn't speak to Father that way. Show some respect."

"I call things as I see them." Evelyn shrugged. "No sugarcoating, no hidden meanings."

The unspoken message was clear - every word she'd uttered was undeniable truth.

Alexander wished the earth would swallow him whole.

As he reached for the roasted lamb chops at lunch, Evelyn suddenly swept all the meat dishes away from his place setting.

She met his glare with an expression that said 'this is for your own good.'

"All this fatty food will skyrocket your cholesterol and blood pressure." She pushed a plate of steamed vegetables toward him. "Stick to these if you want to live past sixty."

His favorite beef tenderloin now sat tantalizingly out of reach.

By meal's end, Alexander's stomach growled as loudly as when they'd begun.

"Vanessa, you should eat more."

Deprived of proper sustenance, Alexander turned his attention to his pregnant stepdaughter. "You're eating for two now! The baby needs nutrients." He piled Vanessa's plate high with delicacies.

Evelyn watched silently, her lashes casting shadows over her lowered eyes.

Though she claimed not to care, the blatant favoritism still stung.

They were both his daughters, yet Alexander had never shown her this level of attention - not a single word of concern, let alone serving her food.

Some children were clearly more equal than others.

"Vanessa, how's the pregnancy progressing? No complications?"

Vanessa was nearly five months along now.

Eleanor had kept her mostly confined to Hawthorne Estate these past months, terrified of a repeat miscarriage. Vanessa had gained noticeable weight, and recent ultrasounds showed the baby measuring large. Doctors had warned about potential delivery complications if growth continued unchecked.

"The baby's been quiet." Vanessa stroked her rounded belly. "We have the anatomy scan next week."

Alexander leaned forward. "Will they reveal the gender?"

Vanessa's fingers traced circles over her abdomen. "I'm praying for a boy."

A son would cement her position.

Eleanor desperately wanted a grandson.

Alexander nodded enthusiastically. "Sons are infinitely superior to daughters, no question."

Among his three children, Oliver remained his clear favorite. Though spoken carelessly, the implications hung heavy in the air. Even Vanessa's smile faltered.

Realizing his gaffe, Alexander backpedaled. "I only meant boys are easier to raise. You were always such a perfect daughter, Vanessa."

Evelyn chose that moment to twist the knife. "Perfect? Is that what we're calling homewreckers now? The whole city knows how she stole my fiancé right from under me."

Alexander's face darkened. "Must you constantly dredge up ancient history? Don't you ever tire of this broken record?"

"Not in the slightest."

Evelyn meticulously peeled a shrimp, savoring it before continuing.

"I need to remind you periodically, lest you forget. Not only did she steal my fiancé, but she framed me for crimes that landed me in prison for two years. Given Vanessa's track record, who knows what karma might visit upon her child..." While Evelyn couldn't directly retaliate yet, she took pleasure in needling them.

Vanessa's face drained of color.

"Evelyn! Take your anger out on me if you must! But how dare you curse an innocent child?"

"Innocent?" Evelyn's laugh held no mirth. "Was I not innocent when your mother switched us at birth? You enjoyed the Hayes family wealth while I struggled to survive, and now I can't even speak my mind?"

"You turned out fine!"

"Do you have any concept of what I endured? The things I did to survive? Don't presume to judge what you don't understand, so spare me your hypocrisy."

Vanessa fell silent, defeated.

"Evelyn, how long do you plan to stay here? Have you and Alexander quarreled?"

Evelyn arched a brow at her father. "Trying to evict me? Need I remind you this estate is legally mine now? If anyone should leave, it's you."

"You—!" Alexander's chest heaved with rage. "You've lost all sense of propriety! I'm your father!"

"Father, calm down!" Vanessa intervened as Alexander began pacing. "You don't understand - Evelyn wants to return, but Uncle Alexander has been... preoccupied. He's been spending all his time at the hospital with his childhood sweetheart."

Fresh from humiliation, Vanessa seized this chance to retaliate.

Pressing her advantage, she added, "Evelyn, is Alexander planning to divorce you?"

At the word 'divorce,' Alexander's expression turned thunderous.

Despite recent family turmoil, his connection to Alexander Whitmore had opened countless doors.

Horizon Enterprises depended entirely on Alexander's continued support.

If this marriage collapsed, what would become of his business?

"You must reconcile with Alexander immediately! Swallow your pride, apologize, do whatever necessary - but divorce is absolutely unacceptable!"

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins.

This was her father - demanding she grovel without even ascertaining the facts.

With paternal concern like this, did she even need enemies?

"I'm not going anywhere. Hawthorne Estate is my home." Evelyn dropped onto the sofa with finality.

"You ungrateful—!" Alexander raised his hand, poised to strike.

Evelyn tilted her chin up, meeting his gaze without flinching. "Lay one finger on me, and I'll dismantle everything you hold dear."

Alexander trembled with fury, his hand suspended mid-air.

At that precise moment, Margaret entered.

Taking in the scene, she flew to her daughter's defense, pummeling Alexander with her fists.

"Richard Hayes! How dare you raise a hand to my child?"

Margaret grabbed a nearby umbrella, whacking Alexander repeatedly. "Out! Get out this instant! You're no longer welcome under this roof!"

Alexander, who'd been playing model guest until now, blanched at Margaret's expulsion order.

But Margaret showed no mercy, instructing maids to pack his belongings immediately.

"Take your things and leave! Know your place! How dare you threaten my daughter!"

Alexander hadn't expected Margaret to follow through.

The memory of his previous eviction still haunted him - he couldn't endure that humiliation again.

His demeanor shifted instantly. "Darling, please forgive me. Just this once?"

It was pitiful watching this middle-aged man attempt puppy-dog eyes, whining to Margaret like a chastened schoolboy.

Evelyn observed from the sofa, her expression glacial, a shudder of disgust running through her at the pathetic display.
###Chapter 646


Vanessa swiftly stepped between Richard and Margaret. "Mom, please. Dad and Evelyn were just playing around. It wasn't serious. Evelyn's fine. Why make this into a family drama?"

Margaret scoffed. "Fine now, but what if she'd gotten hurt? Richard wouldn't be standing here so casually if that were the case."

Richard swallowed his pride, attempting to placate Margaret. "Darling, our son's graduation is coming up. Soon he'll be looking for a wife. Shouldn't we keep the peace? Just this once, let it go."

Margaret shot him an icy glare before turning to Evelyn. "Fine. Then apologize to Evelyn."

Richard, a man in his fifties, struggled to humble himself before someone younger.

But under Margaret's unrelenting stare, he relented.

He approached Evelyn, forcing civility into his tone.

"Evelyn, you know your father has a temper. I acted rashly today. I was wrong. Can you forgive me?"

Silence stretched between them until Margaret pressed, "What exactly did you—"

"—do? It was just a stupid argument. I shouldn’t have made her leave. This is her home. She can come and go as she pleases."

Richard's apology sounded sincere.

Being thrown out months ago had left a lasting impression.

With winter approaching, another expulsion would ruin his Christmas.

"Evelyn," Vanessa pleaded, "Dad’s already humbling himself. Can’t you let this go?"

Richard’s chest warmed at Vanessa’s defense.

His sweet daughter’s loyalty hadn’t been misplaced.

Evelyn had had enough of their performance.

Without a word, she turned toward the stairs. "I’m tired. I’m going to rest."

No one dared stop her.

Richard turned to Margaret hopefully. "Does this mean she’s forgiven me? Can I keep sleeping on your floor?"

Margaret merely snorted.

Taking her silence as consent, Richard hurried outside to retrieve the clothes the maid had tossed out earlier.

Vanessa trailed behind him, wiping away a fake tear.


"Dad, you’re living so miserably here. How can Mom treat you like this?"

Richard exhaled heavily.

From household head to Margaret’s subordinate—he’d struggled with the shift.

But it didn’t matter. As long as Horizon Enterprises thrived, he could endure humiliation at home. At least he still commanded respect outside.

Vanessa leaned in, whispering, "Mom says she loves you deeply. She’ll wait forever, even if you never see her again."

Richard stiffened. "You visited Evelyn Sinclair in secret?"

Margaret had forced Vanessa to cut ties, threatening banishment from Hawthorne Estate.

But Vanessa could never truly abandon her birth mother.

"Mom knows you’re suffering. She’s learned new massage techniques. She could ease your tension if you visit."

Richard fell silent.

He had no real feelings for Evelyn Sinclair. She’d merely been gentler, more attentive than Margaret.

But with Margaret watching him like a hawk, he didn’t dare risk it.

One slip-up had been forgiven. A second would be unforgivable.

Sacrificing his career for a woman wasn’t worth it.

He waved dismissively. "Tell your mother to remarry."

With that, he grabbed his clothes and retreated inside.

Vanessa stared after him, stunned.

Remarry?

Evelyn Sinclair had devoted her life to Richard. Now, past her prime, who would take her?

Men were all the same—ruthlessly pragmatic when their interests were at stake.


Lost in bitterness, Vanessa climbed the stairs and knocked on Evelyn’s door.

"What?"

"High school reunion. Are you coming?"

Evelyn blinked. A reunion?

As former vice president, Vanessa was notifying classmates.

Evelyn was about to decline when Claire called.

"Evelyn, what are you wearing to the reunion? I’m buying a fur coat. Once I’m dressed to kill, I’ll steal the spotlight!"

Evelyn hesitated. She’d planned to skip it, but Claire would insist.

"I’ll be there," she told Vanessa.

"Check your phone. The location’s in the group chat."

Vanessa smirked. "You look exhausted. Not sleeping well? Losing Alexander to another woman must sting."

Her gaze dropped to Evelyn’s stomach.

"Who knew even pregnancy couldn’t keep him? Alexander’s heart is colder than I thought. Weren’t you two always so lovey-dovey?"


Vanessa leaned closer. "Now you understand how it feels when your husband loves someone else."

Lately, Vanessa had wanted the Whitmores to suffer double what they’d inflicted.

Despite her pregnancy, she held no status in their family—oppressed by Eleanor, despised by her husband.

The humiliation made her want to tear Evelyn apart.

Evelyn studied Vanessa as if she were insane.

Alexander had spent last night with her. He cared. Their bond was unshaken by Isabella.

But explaining to Vanessa was pointless. Evelyn slammed the door.

The force nearly caught Vanessa’s belly.

Stumbling back, Vanessa clutched her stomach—then smiled.

Evelyn’s anger meant she’d struck a nerve.


Back in her room, Evelyn checked her college group chat.

The reunion fell on her and Alexander’s anniversary.

What a coincidence.

Their first anniversary, with their baby due soon.

She wanted to spend it with him.

But he might be at the hospital with Isabella that day...

With only days left and Alexander silent about their anniversary, she wondered—had he forgotten?

###Chapter 647

The past two days had been uneventful for Evelyn Carter.

She remained at the Hawthorne Estate, and Richard Hayes didn't dare voice any objections.

Alexander Whitmore would call periodically to update her about the medical situation.

Today was the day the ophthalmologist would examine Isabella Morgan's eyes. They'd soon know if treatment was possible.

Evelyn had spent these days composing a new musical piece at home.

But her distracted mind made the composition feel hollow, lacking its usual depth.

Though she wanted to refine it, she couldn't pinpoint where to begin. Needing space, Evelyn decided to take a walk for inspiration.

The class reunion wasn't until evening, so she had time.

Seeing Evelyn preparing to leave, Margaret Hayes spoke up from the couch. "You're in your third trimester now. You shouldn't go out alone. Let me accompany you."

Evelyn shook her head gently. She needed solitude to clear her thoughts.

Having Margaret along would only make her feel constrained.

"I'll be fine," Evelyn assured her.

Margaret didn't press further.

Once outside, Evelyn wandered aimlessly.

She checked the time.

Exactly one year ago, she and Alexander had been en route to obtain their marriage license.

Time had flown astonishingly fast. Their first anniversary had arrived.

Evelyn hesitated with her phone in hand, tempted to call Alexander.

But would mentioning their anniversary seem desperate?

If he truly cared, he'd remember without prompting. Calling might feel like forcing him to acknowledge it.

The short walk exhausted Evelyn in her condition, so she rested on a park bench.

Suddenly, her phone rang.

"Evelyn, are you alright?" Margaret's concerned voice came through.

She'd noticed Evelyn's unusual melancholy today.

Evelyn paused, touched by the concern. "I'm fine."

"Really? Something's bothering you. Did Richard say something again?"

"No, it's nothing like that."

"Then what—"

"Really, don't worry. I'm just taking some air and heading back soon."

Evelyn ended the call.

Margaret had heard the rumors circulating.

Whispers claimed Alexander was enchanted by some hospital patient, attending to her every need.

But Margaret knew better. She'd seen Alexander visiting Hawthorne Estate nightly to be with Evelyn.

Physical presence mattered less than where one's heart truly resided.

And Alexander's heart unquestionably belonged to Evelyn.

This separation might actually strengthen their bond, Margaret believed.

After wrestling with her thoughts, Evelyn decided to call Alexander about the situation.

The call connected briefly before disconnecting.

Evelyn stared at her phone in dismay.

If connected, why hadn't Alexander spoken?

This emotional limbo was wearing her down.

She hadn't seen Alexander since their parting two days prior.

Suddenly, she realized how intensely she missed him.

Meanwhile, Isabella stared at Alexander's phone.

He'd left it unattended when visiting the restroom.

When it rang, she'd instinctively picked it up.

She'd accidentally answered it.

Remembering her supposed blindness, Isabella panicked.

How could a blind person answer a call?

She tried deleting the call log, but Alexander's phone was password-protected.

After hanging up, the screen locked. She tried Evelyn's birthday—incorrect. The phone remained inaccessible.

Hearing the bathroom door open, Isabella quickly replaced the phone, feigning blindness. "Alexander, were you in the bathroom?"

"Yes."

"I've been confined here for days. I need air. Will you guide me outside?"

Guide her?

Alexander frowned. "It's unsafe for you to walk unaided. I'll arrange a wheelchair."

"No!" Isabella insisted. "I want your hand!"

Alexander turned to Simon Graves at the door. "Simon, escort her."

Simon entered immediately.

Isabella's enthusiasm vanished at Simon's presence.

She'd wanted private time with Alexander. What purpose did walking with Simon serve?

She quickly abandoned the idea.

Near noon, Simon left for lunch, leaving Alexander and Isabella alone.

When Evelyn arrived and reached for the door handle—

She froze at the sight before her.

From her angle, Isabella appeared to be embracing Alexander, arms around his neck.

Were they...kissing?

Evelyn's pulse raced as icy dread crept through her veins.

She swayed unsteadily, nearly collapsing.

On their anniversary, Alexander had gifted her this devastating scene!

Tears burned behind her eyes. Alexander's two-day absence suddenly made sense.

Had their relationship progressed this far?

Public displays of affection, just like that?

Evelyn wanted to confront them.

But her chaotic thoughts warned that confrontation might end everything.

After agonizing hesitation, Evelyn turned away.

Arguing wouldn't help. In her condition, she needed to protect the baby.

Distraught, Evelyn accidentally knocked over a hallway trash can, creating a loud crash.

Hearing the noise, Alexander turned.

He stood to investigate.

"Alexander, where are you going? Don't leave me!"

Isabella, who'd actually gotten something in her eye and requested his help, now pretended to grope blindly for him.

She'd spotted Evelyn's arrival.

Her staged "kiss" had worked perfectly—Evelyn had fled in distress.

The toppled trash can confirmed Evelyn's distraught departure.

Isabella couldn't let Alexander leave now and discover Evelyn outside.

She clung desperately to his hand.
###Chapter 648

The moment Alexander turned away, Isabella's lips twisted into a smug smirk, her eyes gleaming with triumph.

But as soon as she lifted her head, her expression melted into pitiful vulnerability. Tears welled in her eyes as she whispered, "I'm terrified being here alone. Please... don't leave me."

Alexander's jaw tightened, but with the medical team due to arrive soon, he reluctantly sank back into the chair.

He reached for his phone on the table.

Isabella's breath hitched.

Had he noticed she'd answered his call earlier?

Her pulse steadied when she saw him scrolling through emails instead of checking his call log.

Not wanting to arouse suspicion, she forced a weak smile. "Alexander, why are you so quiet? What are you thinking about?"

"Work."

Lately, his responses to her had been clipped and indifferent, barely more than a word or two.

Though it stung, Isabella knew better than to push.

She settled back against the hospital pillows, playing the role of the perfect, fragile patient.

Three days of bed rest had left her muscles stiff and aching. Even her backside felt numb.

How much longer would she have to keep up this charade?

Faking blindness was proving far more exhausting than she'd anticipated.

Evelyn left the hospital in a daze, completely unaware of Vanessa standing nearby.

It was Vanessa's scheduled prenatal appointment, and Eleanor had sent two maids to accompany her.

Noticing Evelyn's pale complexion, Vanessa instinctively moved toward her—only for the maids to block her path.

"Madam's orders—the baby's health comes first. Please don't involve yourself in unnecessary trouble."

These maids were Eleanor's most trusted attendants. Vanessa bit her lip, knowing it was pointless to argue.

She proceeded to the obstetrics department for her ultrasound, the maids hovering outside the door.

"The baby remains significantly larger than average," the doctor remarked, frowning at the screen.

"You're overindulging. If this continues, delivery will be complicated. There's also an increased risk of premature labor."

Vanessa scowled. Every visit, the same lecture—yet she barely ate anything!

This was a critical screening for congenital abnormalities, so the doctor took extra time.

At first, Vanessa didn't think much of it—until the doctor's expression darkened.

He called in a senior colleague, then another.

The three physicians murmured in hushed tones, pointing at the monitor, their medical jargon incomprehensible to her.

A cold dread settled in Vanessa's stomach.

She finally blurted, "Is something wrong? Is my baby okay?"

"One moment, please," the doctor said, his tone grim.

The delay only amplified her panic.

Each passing second felt like a blade dangling above her head.

When the examination finally ended, Vanessa hastily adjusted her clothes. "Well? Tell me!"

"The baby's heart isn't developing properly. We strongly recommend termination. If carried to term, the child will face severe lifelong complications."

Vanessa's blood ran cold. "You mean... he could die at birth?"

"Survival isn't guaranteed. Even if he lives, he'll require multiple surgeries for congenital heart defects. He'll never lead a normal life—no sports, no strenuous activity."

Vanessa's hands trembled.

A child who couldn't run or play? Unthinkable!

No one in her family had heart disease. Why her baby?

"I've had two abortions and a miscarriage from an accident," she said hoarsely. "If I terminate this one... can I even get pregnant again?"

The doctor's startled pause was answer enough.

This pregnancy had been a miracle. Another termination might leave her barren.

"Is it a boy?" she demanded.

"Yes."

Vanessa's resolve hardened.

She would carry this child to term.

The Anistons had endless resources. Money could buy the best specialists.

And with Ethan growing colder by the day, this baby was her only hope of reclaiming his attention.

Losing it meant losing everything.

As night fell, Claire drove Evelyn to their college reunion.

Claire frowned at Evelyn's pallor. "You look awful. What happened?"

Evelyn forced a weak smile. "Just pregnancy fatigue. The baby's been restless."

"Maybe you should skip this," Claire suggested, eyeing Evelyn's barely concealed bump.

The oversized sweater hid it well, but Evelyn had been distant since leaving the hospital.

Staying home would only feed her misery—at least the reunion might distract her.

"I need this," Evelyn murmured.

Claire sighed. "Fine. But I'm sticking to you like glue."

Throughout the drive, Claire tried making small talk, but Evelyn remained withdrawn.

Something was definitely wrong.

"Did Alexander cheat on you?" Claire finally asked bluntly.

The dam broke.

Evelyn covered her face, sobbing. "I saw him kissing Isabella, Claire. Today was our first anniversary, and he forgot! And there he was, wrapped around another woman!"

Her voice cracked with raw pain.

Claire's heart ached for her.

Pulling into the venue's parking lot, Claire yanked Evelyn into a fierce hug.

"That bastard! But this doesn't sound like him. Are you sure it wasn't a misunderstanding?"

"I saw it with my own eyes!"

Claire wiped Evelyn's tears with a tissue. "Listen, you're gorgeous, brilliant, and loaded. You know what they say about these reunions—they're basically matchmaking events in disguise!"

"Go wild tonight! If he can fool around, so can you. Maybe it's time to find a new daddy for that baby. Show him what he's losing!"

Typical Claire.

After her own heartbreak, she'd adopted a devil-may-care attitude toward love.

But Evelyn wasn't so sure revenge was the answer.

Not when her heart was already shattered.
###Chapter 649

The crisp evening air filled Evelyn's lungs as she steadied herself beside Claire before stepping out of the luxury sedan.

The reunion venue was a five-star hotel's private floor, an intentional choice to mirror their elite school days.

When the elevator doors slid open, Evelyn's breath caught at the sight of Vanessa Hart surrounded by familiar faces.

Though years had passed, she recognized them instantly - the same girls who'd once drenched her chair with red ink during class.

Evelyn could still feel the cold liquid seeping through her uniform, their cruel laughter echoing in her memory.

These were also the girls who'd locked her in an unheated bathroom during winter break.

Back then, young Evelyn couldn't comprehend such calculated cruelty from classmates.

For years, their bullying had cast long shadows over her school life.

Now, with adult perspective, it was obvious Vanessa had been the mastermind behind it all.

Vanessa and her clique still carried themselves with affected elegance, but their faded designer clothes told a different story.

If Evelyn remembered correctly, their families had lost fortunes in recent market crashes.

Karma had finally balanced the scales.

An uncomfortable silence fell as the women exchanged nervous glances, clearly unsure how to interact with Evelyn now.

Their eyes darted away whenever hers approached, afraid of offending the woman they'd once tormented.

Evelyn offered them a gracious smile, but Vanessa immediately sneered, "What's wrong, Evelyn? Overwhelmed with nostalgia?"

Her voice dripped with false concern before shifting to mock surprise.

"Oh wait! Isn't your husband currently... unavailable? Missing him already?"

The barb was deliberately loud, drawing curious looks from nearby guests.

Unfazed, Evelyn gently rested a hand on Vanessa's shoulder. "Still the same Vanessa, I see. No manners even now. Shouldn't you address me as 'Mrs. Whitmore'?"

Vanessa's face flushed crimson as if physically struck.

Her friends exchanged panicked looks, frozen in awkward silence.

The tension shattered when the elevator chimed, followed by rich masculine laughter.

All heads turned to see Dominic Powell stepping out in a bespoke black suit, one hand casually in his pocket, radiating effortless authority.

The contrast was striking - delicate Evelyn having rendered Vanessa speechless while Dominic observed with amusement.

Vanessa shot Evelyn a venomous glare before storming off in humiliation.

Evelyn frowned at Dominic's unexpected appearance.

His assistant Nathaniel interjected, "The Powell Group owns this property. Mr. Powell is conducting an inspection tonight. Should you require anything, Mrs. Whitmore—"

Dominic cut him off with a glacial stare. "That's enough."

Nathaniel immediately bowed his head as the elevator doors closed on them.

Claire, oblivious to the complexities between Evelyn and Dominic, noticed their familiarity and grinned.

"Spill it! There's definitely something between you two!"

Anyone could see Dominic's timely arrival wasn't coincidence.

Evelyn shook her head. "Don't be ridiculous. We're merely acquaintances."

Claire linked arms with her, undeterred. "Then why's a busy CEO making personal inspections during your reunion? He's clearly interested! When did this happen?"

Her matchmaking instincts were legendary.

Dominic might play the carefree bachelor, but Claire knew men like him became fiercely devoted once committed.

Evelyn protested, "He's Isabella Morgan's fiancé. And I'm married."

"Even better!" Claire's eyes sparkled. "Isabella's trying to steal Alexander, you're catching her fiancé's eye - poetic justice! Worst case, you both get revenge!"

Evelyn tapped Claire's forehead lightly. "How is that good? Isabella wants out of that engagement. Getting involved would just help her!"

Claire laughed. "Relax, I'm joking!"

She knew better than anyone - once Evelyn gave her heart, she never looked back.

Right now, that heart belonged solely to Alexander.

Evelyn checked her phone discreetly.

No new messages.

Her smile faltered momentarily.

It seemed today would pass like any other - Alexander had forgotten their anniversary.

Entering the ballroom, Evelyn was greeted by a hauntingly beautiful melody.

She paused, recognizing the composition instantly.

Having arrived late, most classmates were already mingling in clusters.

The music's enchantment seemed to hush all conversation.

"What is this piece? It's exquisite," someone murmured.

Claire beamed. "The award-winning composition from last month's competition! Don't you recognize the composer standing right here?"

Evelyn's cheeks burned - she wished the floor would swallow her.

True to form, Claire pushed her forward. "My incredibly talented best friend composed this!"

Suddenly, all eyes were on Evelyn.

She felt like a prize vegetable at auction under Claire's proud gaze.

The attention was overwhelming.

"Excuse me, are you...?"

Years had transformed Evelyn beyond recognition - no longer the plain, timid girl in ill-fitting uniforms.

Tonight, with minimal makeup accentuating her delicate features and dressed simply amidst overdressed peers, her natural beauty shone brighter.

Blushing, Evelyn raised her glass. "Laird Borden, isn't it?"

She composed herself with visible effort. "Evelyn Carter-Whitmore."

Laird's jaw dropped in recognition.

Within minutes, word spread - Evelyn had become an acclaimed composer.

The bullied girl now commanded the room's respect.
###Chapter 650

Vanessa watched from the shadows, her fingers twisting the fabric of her dress into knots.

She had orchestrated this gathering specifically to humiliate Evelyn, but fate had other plans. The moment Evelyn arrived, she became the center of attention with that mesmerizing piano performance.

The recent revelation that Evelyn had become Leonard Herty's protégé only intensified the crowd's fascination. Everyone wanted a piece of her newfound connection.

Leonard Herty wasn't just any musician - he was a titan in Cresthaven's cultural circles, a man whose influence could open doors to unimaginable opportunities.

As Vanessa observed Evelyn basking in the admiration, her hand instinctively moved to her swollen belly.

The doctor's diagnosis echoed in her mind - congenital heart defect. The thought of her unborn child's condition made her chest tighten with anguish.

A flash of bitterness crossed Vanessa's features as she glared at Evelyn's slender frame.

With trembling fingers, she dialed Ethan.

This was her only trump card now - her status as Ethan Caldwell's wife.

"Ethan... I'm ready to leave. Can you come pick me up?"

Ethan had been buried in work lately, but tonight's dinner meeting happened to be just five minutes away. Eleanor had been adamant about Vanessa skipping the event, worried about the baby's health. It was only Vanessa's promise of Ethan's escort that finally eased her concerns.

True to form, Eleanor had called Ethan personally to remind him of his duty.

No matter how much he might resent Vanessa, he wouldn't dare disobey his mother.

Within minutes, Ethan arrived at the venue, his tailored suit accentuating his commanding presence.

Being a year senior to most attendees, Ethan had been something of a campus legend during their university days.

Word of his arrival spread like wildfire, and suddenly a crowd formed around him.

Ethan was no stranger to sycophants - the Caldwell name attracted them like moths to flame. He maintained his usual aloof demeanor.

But Vanessa felt a surge of triumph. Finally, she was reclaiming the spotlight Evelyn had stolen!

She made sure to loop her arm possessively through Ethan's. "It's getting late, and I need to rest. The baby, you know."

All eyes immediately dropped to Vanessa's midsection. So that explained her fuller figure!

As Ethan allowed himself to be led away, someone called out, "Leaving so soon?"

"My husband has important matters to attend to," Vanessa replied sweetly.

Ethan's gaze wandered across the room until it landed on Evelyn.

His breath caught.

She stood out like a spring blossom in her caramel coat and white knit dress, her hair pulled back in a simple ponytail. There was an effortless grace about her that made everyone else fade into the background.

"Ethan?"

Vanessa tugged at his arm, but he remained rooted to the spot.

When she followed his stare, her blood boiled. He was completely transfixed by Evelyn.

Biting her lip hard enough to draw blood, Vanessa whispered, "Ethan, we're leaving."

Still no response.

The tension became palpable, until someone broke it with forced cheer. "Mr. Caldwell! You must try this excellent vintage before you go!"

Truthfully, no one wanted Ethan to leave. These elite gatherings were rare opportunities to network with Cresthaven's upper echelons.

Ethan seized the moment to take a seat - conveniently facing Evelyn. The way he looked at her could melt glaciers.

Vanessa's face burned with humiliation beside him.

Claire was the first to notice Ethan's intense stare. She nudged Evelyn sharply. "Ethan Caldwell's here!"

Evelyn glanced up, and when their eyes met, Ethan raised his glass in a silent toast, one eyebrow quirking playfully.

The gesture might have seemed subtle, but in this shark tank of social climbers, nothing went unnoticed.

Whispers about the complicated history between the three began circulating anew. Sympathy visibly shifted toward Vanessa - the pregnant wife clearly losing her husband's attention to another woman.

Desperate to salvage some dignity, Vanessa forced a smile while internally screaming for the event to end. The weight of pitying stares became unbearable.

Seizing an unnoticed moment, she slipped away to a secluded corner. With practiced stealth, she emptied a small vial into a crystal champagne flute.

Nathaniel gasped from the surveillance room. "Mr. Powell! She's poisoning Ms. Carter!"

Dominic, who had been monitoring the screens intently, barely reacted. "I have eyes, Nathaniel," he said dryly.

"Aren't we going to intervene? She's pregnant! What if she drinks that?"

It was almost comical - Dominic had come specifically for Evelyn, yet he'd holed up in the control room instead of making his move.

Nathaniel wondered if there'd been some incident at the hospital that had shaken his normally decisive boss.

Just as Evelyn reached for the tainted glass, Dominic finally stirred.

But before he could act, every head in the room turned toward the elevator.

Alexander Whitmore stepped out, his presence commanding immediate attention.

Dominic's hands clenched into fists.

"Damn it," he muttered. "Always one step behind."

Nathaniel sighed. "Mr. Powell... are we still making our move?"
###Chapter 651

The grand ballroom erupted in hushed whispers as the elevator doors parted, revealing Alexander Whitmore's imposing figure.

In Cresthaven society, his reputation preceded him.

Over recent years, financial headlines frequently featured him - alternately described as the Whitmore heir apparent or the city's most promising young tycoon. His consistent refusal of interviews only amplified his enigmatic aura.

For someone of Alexander's stature, securing an audience typically required weeks of advance scheduling.

No one anticipated his sudden appearance at this casual alumni gathering.

"He's even more breathtaking in person!"

"Those broad shoulders could carry the weight of the world!"

"Pity he's already taken. We never stood a chance."

"Delusional much? Even if he were single, women like us wouldn't register on his radar."

"Rumor has it he's completely devoted to his wife. Evelyn Carter must have won the cosmic lottery."

The crowd's attention shifted like a sudden tide.

Ethan Caldwell, previously the center of attention, found himself abruptly abandoned.

The contrast couldn't be sharper - Ethan, the struggling entrepreneur versus Alexander, the undisputed heir to Titan Capital Group with real power at his fingertips. The choice was obvious to everyone present. Ethan's face tightened as he registered the mass desertion, a bitter taste flooding his mouth.

Yet protocol demanded he acknowledge his uncle.

"Uncle Alexander!" Ethan forced a smile, rising from his seat.

A distracted hum was his only response as Alexander became engulfed in a sea of outstretched business cards.

To everyone's surprise, the notoriously aloof tycoon accepted each one with patient courtesy.

Whispers circulated about his legendary poker face, but tonight he seemed almost... approachable.

The change was undoubtedly for Evelyn's sake - as her husband, he wouldn't want to embarrass her before former classmates.

This graciousness only highlighted Ethan's earlier arrogance when rejecting toast after toast.

The collective thought was palpable: "This isn't even a competition."

"Mr. Whitmore, had we known you were coming, we'd have arranged proper accommodations!" Laird fumbled for his cigarette case, only to be waved off.

"I quit years ago," Alexander said, his voice carrying effortlessly. "With my wife expecting, secondhand smoke is out of the question."

A stunned silence followed.

The revelation about his consideration for Evelyn's pregnancy sent waves through the crowd.

As Alexander approached Evelyn, his arm encircled her shoulders possessively. "Please, everyone, enjoy yourselves," he addressed the room before turning to his wife with visible concern. "You're shivering. Where's your wrap?"

He began removing his tailored jacket.

Evelyn pressed a palm against his chest. "The heating's fine, really."

Alexander captured her hand, frowning. "Your fingers are like ice." His gaze dropped to her glass. "And this water's room temperature at best." He set it aside decisively.

Vanessa Hart's nails bit into her palms.

She'd nearly cheered when Evelyn picked up the doctored drink, only for Alexander to materialize at the crucial moment.

As the abandoned glass sat on the bar, Vanessa plotted its discreet disposal before anyone noticed the evidence. Meanwhile, the other women watched Alexander's attentiveness with barely concealed envy.

Who wouldn't covet a husband who combined staggering wealth, devastating looks, and unwavering devotion?

Evelyn had clearly won life's grand prize.

"You're incredibly fortunate, Evelyn," a classmate murmured.

Alexander's gaze softened as he looked down at his wife. "I'm the fortunate one to have won Evelyn's heart."

His eyes then flicked to Ethan. "Wouldn't you agree... Ethan?"

Ethan felt as though an invisible vise clamped around his chest, leaving him exposed and rigid.

His very presence suddenly felt absurd.

The unspoken truth hung heavy - had he not been such a fool, Evelyn would never have married Alexander.

The crowd's murmurs crescendoed as more people connected the dots about their tangled history.

Those unfamiliar with the backstory received rapid explanations in hushed tones.

For Ethan, the evening had become a waking nightmare, his cheeks burning with humiliation.

Vanessa's scheming suddenly seemed utterly contemptible.

Under Alexander's expectant gaze, Ethan had no choice but to respond.

"Uncle Alexander, you and Aunt Evelyn are truly heaven-matched."

The words tasted like ash, but he forced a convincing smile.

Alexander's approving clap on his shoulder felt like a branding iron. "Well said! Regarding that partnership proposal you submitted - my assistant will schedule a proper discussion."

Ethan had waited a month for any response to his startup's proposal, each inquiry met with vague excuses about paperwork delays.

Now he understood - Alexander had been waiting for this public display of submission.

The realization settled like a stone in his gut.
###Chapter 652

Evelyn was still trying to process why Alexander had shown up unannounced at her high school reunion.

She frowned. "I never told him about this place. How did he even know?"

At this hour, shouldn't he be at Isabella's bedside, playing the devoted friend?

The memory of seeing Alexander kiss Isabella earlier that day sent a sharp pang through her chest.

With so many eyes watching, Evelyn couldn't confront him directly, but her icy glare spoke volumes.

As the evening wore on, Ethan grew increasingly uncomfortable. He muttered a flimsy excuse and made his escape.

Vanessa instinctively moved to follow, but the sharp look he threw her way made her freeze.

Biting her lip, she trailed behind him anyway. The moment the elevator doors closed, she put on her most pitiful expression. "Ethan, what's wrong? We were fine just a minute ago. Why are you acting like this?"

Why?

Because ever since Alexander had arrived, Ethan felt like the punchline of a bad joke.

That snide remark from Alexander had been the final humiliation.

And it was all Vanessa's fault.

If she hadn't meddled, if she hadn't stirred up trouble between him and Evelyn—maybe things would have been different.

Once they were alone in the garage, Ethan dropped all pretense.

"Vanessa, stop following me! You're pathetic!"

"Your mother told you to drive me home. Where do you think you're going?" she snapped back, trying to regain control.

As the elevator doors opened, he shoved her away.

"Since when do I answer to you? Who do you think you are?"

He climbed into his car without another glance, slamming the door and speeding off.

Vanessa stood there, abandoned.

She had worked so hard to ease the tension between them. He didn't love her, but at least they had reached an uneasy truce.

She had hoped the baby would change things—that he'd soften for the sake of their child.

But now, thanks to this reunion, everything was falling apart again.

Her heart sank as she watched his taillights disappear.

It was late, and as a pregnant woman, she had no choice but to head back to the lobby to call a cab.

But as she turned, she nearly collided with a man in a wheelchair.

Vanessa froze.

Dominic Powell.

She didn't know him personally, but she'd heard enough about his volatile temper to be wary.

She tried to sidestep him, but he blocked her path.

"Mr. Powell, could you please move?" she asked, forcing politeness.

"Move?" His smirk was razor-sharp. "What makes you think I take orders from you?"

The hostility in his voice sent a chill down her spine.

She turned to leave—only to find herself surrounded by towering bodyguards.

Her pulse spiked. "What do you want? Ethan is my husband! You can't do this!"

Dominic scoffed. "Ethan? Please. Even he wouldn't dare cross me."

She clutched her belly protectively. "If you touch me, I'll call the police!"

Her threats meant nothing to him.

With a lazy flick of his wrist, his men lunged forward, muffling her screams as they shoved her into a waiting van.

Back at the reunion, laughter and clinking glasses filled the air.

Alexander handled the endless toasts with effortless charm, drinking without showing the slightest sign of intoxication.

He kept Evelyn close, their fingers intertwined beneath the table.

Every time their eyes met, his gaze was warm, affectionate—enough to make her earlier irritation fade.

When the chatter finally lulled, he leaned in, lips brushing her ear. "Why the frown? Not enjoying yourself?"

She arched a brow. "How did you even know I was here?"

His smirk was knowing. "Lucas."

Of course. Claire had brought Bella to the reunion, which meant Lucas was babysitting.

And Lucas had never been good at keeping secrets.

Alexander's voice dropped to a whisper. "So? Am I making you proud tonight?"

Reunions were all about comparisons—men flaunting success, women showing off designer labels and perfect marriages.

Alexander was giving Evelyn the ultimate upgrade.

Still, she couldn't shake her unease.

"You were just kissing Isabella. What are you doing here with me?"

Her words were barely audible, meant only for him.

Alexander frowned, finally realizing her mood wasn't just about the reunion. "When did I ever kiss Isabella?"

"I saw it!"

He feigned innocence, a wounded look crossing his face. "You must have imagined it."

"Imagined it?" Her eyes narrowed.

She had seen them at the hospital—there was no way she'd mistaken that.

Their quiet exchange was loaded, but to the others, it looked like playful banter.

Claire sipped her drink, watching them with quiet amusement.

Just an hour ago, Evelyn had been complaining about Alexander forgetting their anniversary.

But seeing them now, it was clear he hadn't forgotten at all.

Claire knew better than anyone what Evelyn had been through.

After everything, seeing her happy was a relief.

But it also stirred a quiet envy.

Since her breakup with Julian, Claire's life had returned to monotony.

If Julian had been the spice in her life, now it was bland.

Bella was a joy, but with her baby nearly three months old, maybe it was time to think about work again.

But what could she do?

Before Bella, she'd been a model. How many models were also single mothers?

Still, she didn't regret it. She'd traded her career for something far more precious.

Alexander could hold his liquor, but even he had his limits.

When Evelyn noticed his ears turning red, she smoothly intercepted the next toast.

He flashed a charming smile. "Sorry, my wife says I'm cut off."

Wrapping an arm around her, he stood to say his goodbyes.

To Evelyn's surprise, the entire table rose with him, looking almost starstruck.

Watching him navigate the room with such effortless charm made something warm bloom in her chest.

The moment they stepped outside, Alexander slumped against her, his breath warm against her ear.

"Babe, I think I'm drunk. Can't even stand straight."

His arms tightened around her.

"Give me a kiss. I need it."

His voice was low, playful—but the sincerity beneath it made her heart skip.
###Chapter 653

Evelyn's brow furrowed, the lingering resentment toward Alexander still simmering beneath her composed exterior.

She placed a delicate hand against his chest, creating distance between them. Her teeth worried her lower lip as she voiced the concern gnawing at her. "What about Isabella? Shouldn't you be attending to her tonight? In her current condition... what if something happens? Doesn't that worry you?"

"Worried?" Alexander's intense gaze locked onto hers, searching for something deeper. "Evelyn, tell me... is this jealousy I'm sensing?"

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken emotions.

It cut deeper than any knife to watch her husband dote on another woman, especially when he'd forgotten their anniversary.

Yes, Alexander had performed admirably at the reunion, making her the envy of her classmates. But what did that matter?

Empty gestures couldn't fill the void in her heart or provide genuine comfort.

What Evelyn craved was authentic devotion from her husband, not these superficial displays.

She desperately needed Alexander to resolve whatever remained between him and Isabella and refocus on their family.

She'd granted him time to sort through this mess, but if he couldn't... she was prepared to gather her dignity and walk away.

She refused to remain trapped in this twisted love triangle.

Financially independent now, Evelyn knew she could raise their child alone if necessary.

Alexander's fingers gently intertwined with hers. "Today, a specialist examined Isabella. They found no physiological damage to her eyes, yet she insists she can't see."

"The expert believes her vision might return spontaneously within days."

"My schedule's been overwhelming lately—I haven't been able to remain at her bedside constantly. Please don't misinterpret my actions."

"Sometimes work keeps me at the Hawthorne Estate so late, I didn't want to disturb your rest."

Evelyn's pregnancy advanced daily, and he understood how precious her sleep had become. His late-night arrivals would only disrupt her peace.

"I only visited the hospital today to consult with the specialist. I needed firsthand information about her condition."

He'd delegated Isabella's care to Simon and even hired a private nurse.

"I tried calling earlier," he added, drawing her closer until his arms encircled her waist.

Evelyn had developed a habit of silencing her phone during creative sessions.

By the time she noticed Alexander's missed calls and attempted to return them, he'd inevitably be in meetings with his phone muted.

This frustrating cycle of missed connections had strained them both.

Learning Alexander hadn't been constantly at Isabella's side eased some of Evelyn's tension.

Her lashes fluttered downward as she murmured, "But this afternoon... at the hospital... I saw you kissing her."

Alexander's expression darkened as he searched his memory. Suddenly, realization dawned. "Wait—was that noise in the hallway you?"

His gaze swept over her urgently. "Evelyn, did you fall? Are you injured?"

He vaguely recalled hearing something heavy impact the floor, but Isabella's distraction had prevented investigation.

Evelyn gave a slight headshake. "Just collided with a waste bin... stumbled slightly. No fall occurred."

Alexander exhaled in relief. "Thank goodness. Isabella claimed something irritated her eye... I was examining it. You misinterpreted what you saw."

Evelyn's features hardened with sudden clarity.

"How convenient," she mused silently. "I arrive precisely as they're in that compromising position."

"Almost as if... Isabella wanted me to witness it."

"But wait—she's supposedly blind. How would she know I was there?"

A startling possibility took root in Evelyn's mind.

"What if Isabella can see? What if this blindness is an elaborate ruse?"

The theory gained traction as she considered it.

Even the specialists found no significant injury—perhaps this was all performance art. "Could she be deceiving everyone?"

Evelyn kept these suspicions from Alexander.

Without concrete evidence, accusations would be meaningless.

If Isabella was indeed pretending, Evelyn wanted to expose the truth herself.

After all, Isabella had framed Evelyn for this supposed injury—now came the reckoning.

"Keeping Isabella hospitalized isn't sustainable. Why not bring her to our home?" Evelyn proposed abruptly.

Alexander stared in disbelief. "Our home? Evelyn, what are you suggesting?"

"Consider the practicality. Our staff could attend to her needs more efficiently," Evelyn countered with calculated sincerity.

Alexander shook his head. "That's our private sanctuary. I won't have another woman invading that space." His boundaries remained firm.

Never would he permit Isabella to cross their home's threshold.

Moreover, as a man of principle, he found the idea of cohabitating with another woman—even with Evelyn present—profoundly inappropriate.

But Evelyn had strategic reasons for this suggestion.

"Temporarily only! Once her vision returns, she leaves. Would you truly abandon a blind woman?" Alexander hesitated, conflict evident in his features.

Evelyn clasped his arm, tilting her face upward with softened expression.

This vulnerable posture always unraveled his resistance, tugging at his heartstrings.

With a resigned sigh, he nodded. "Very well. Your decision stands. I'll comply."

Relief washed over Evelyn.

Alexander's voice gentled. "Does this mean you're finally ready to return from the Hawthorne Estate?"

Her eager nod answered him.

"Then I'll rearrange my schedule to collect you personally tomorrow," Alexander said, the ghost of a smile touching his lips.

After a beat, he amended, "No—we're going home tonight."

In one fluid motion, he guided her toward their car, as though fearing she might reconsider.

As the city lights blurred past the window, Evelyn's thoughts drifted.

She reminded herself that Alexander carried tremendous responsibilities. That he'd made time for her reunion at all was significant. Expecting him to remember every anniversary might be unreasonable.

Her gaze dropped, stealing glances at the passing scenery.

Noticing Evelyn's distraction, Alexander retrieved his phone and texted Lucas: [Call me in ten minutes.]

Lucas responded immediately: [Understood.]
###Chapter 654

1/10
The car pulled up outside the cozy cottage. Alexander opened the door for Evelyn, gesturing for her to step out.

Just then, his phone rang.

"Evelyn, it's Lucas. It's freezing out here—go inside first. I'll join you after this call," he said.

She nodded absently, not giving it much thought.

When Lucas answered, confusion laced his voice. "Alexander, why did you ask me to call you?"

Alexander's eyes lingered on Evelyn until she disappeared inside. Then he smirked. "Just wanted to chat."

Lucas scoffed. "Since when do we call each other for small talk?"

"Exactly," Alexander agreed. "There’s nothing to talk about. You’re just a convenient excuse."

Lucas sputtered. "Excuse me? What the hell does that mean?"

Alexander chuckled. "This is why I have a wife, and you don’t."

Lucas bristled. "That’s low, man!"

2/10
"Claire drank too much at her reunion. A few guys were all over her—probably trying to ask her out," Alexander added casually.

Lucas immediately tensed. "What did you just say?"

He had barely dealt with Julian, and now rivals were already circling Claire?

"Alexander, I gotta go! My future wife needs defending!" Lucas hung up, handed his daughter to the nanny, and sped toward the restaurant.

Alexander glanced at the cottage. Evelyn had been inside for five minutes.

A slow smile curved his lips. He hoped she liked what awaited her.

Evelyn pushed open the door, and the rich scent of roses enveloped her before she even found the light switch.

Fumbling in the dark, she finally flicked it on.

3/10
She expected the living room to brighten instantly—but it didn’t.

Instead, a trail of warm, star-shaped lights flickered to life at her feet, casting a soft, romantic glow.

The fragrance wasn’t just from a few roses—it was everywhere.

The path of lights was intricately woven with rose petals, guiding her forward. The golden glow wrapped around her, turning the space into something dreamlike.

Evelyn’s breath caught. The entire room was blanketed in roses.

She followed the path, heart pounding, until she reached their bedroom door.

When she pushed it open, her knees nearly gave out.

A massive heart of roses covered their bed, spelling out I love you in bold crimson.

Honestly? It was a little cheesy.

But her chest tightened anyway.

A man like Alexander—raised on a ranch, hardened by years in the police academy—had no idea how to romance a woman properly.

Yet here he was, trying.

4/10
A realization struck her. Is this for our anniversary? I thought he’d forgotten…

But he hadn’t. And judging by the roses, he’d done this all himself.

She traced the petals, estimating thousands of them. The earlier arrangements were meticulous, but as she moved deeper, they grew haphazard—like he’d run out of time.

The I love you on the bed was slightly crooked, the letters uneven.

Tears pricked her eyes.

Alexander could’ve hired professionals. Instead, he’d done this—thorn-pricked fingers and all.

Her emotions had been a rollercoaster today. From disappointment to overwhelming gratitude.

The落差 was staggering.

5/10
He must’ve planned this for weeks, yet played it off as a spontaneous decision.

She’d never found him more irresistible.

Just as she thought the surprise was over, the projector hummed to life, casting images across the wall—photos she’d never seen.

All taken from Alexander’s perspective.

The first showed her in the kitchen shortly after their wedding, wearing an apron, nervously tasting a dish.

She remembered him working at the table, seemingly absorbed in his laptop.

Yet he’d stolen this moment without her noticing.

Had he been working—or watching her?

6/10
The next photo froze her.

The morning after their first time, Alexander had kissed her forehead while she slept—and captured it.

Her pulse skyrocketed.

Three more photos followed, all from her days as his secretary at Titan Capital.

He’d been observing her even then.

These images spanned their entire relationship. Alexander had documented her life without her ever realizing.

One photo stood out: her outside the orchestra, turning to wave at him, radiant amid the crowd.

The composition was stunning—like his gaze had tunneled through everyone else, landing only on her.

7/10
Photos spoke louder than words.

Through these, she felt Alexander’s love—raw and unwavering.

There were exactly 520. By the last one, tears streamed down her face.

Memories flooded back, tiny moments she’d forgotten, now vivid again.

She hadn’t realized how much they’d shared.

Her shoulders shook as she cried.

This wasn’t some generic anniversary—Alexander had poured his soul into it.

A warm presence enveloped her from behind. "Why the tears?" Alexander murmured, pulling her close.

Evelyn smacked his chest weakly.

8/10
"You jerk. Why didn’t you tell me?" she choked out.

"You thought I forgot?" He wiped her cheeks, heart aching at her tears. "I fought too hard to marry you to ever forget."

He’d spent days preparing. Sourcing ten thousand roses last-minute meant clearing out multiple florists.

Arranging them was harder.

That’s why he’d stayed away from Hawthorne Estate—every spare moment went into this.

For two nights, he’d barely slept.

Some roses still had thorns. His hands bore the scratches, but he hadn’t cared.

He wanted no help. This was his gift to her—imperfect, but entirely his.

9/10
Right before fetching Evelyn, he’d been fussing over the I love you on the bed.

The middle word refused to cooperate. After multiple failed attempts, he’d swapped it for a heart.

But hearts weren’t easier.

A man built for chasing criminals and tactical training now wrestled with flower petals.

Every muscle had been repurposed for romance.

This was his first time doing something like this. Until moments ago, he’d worried she’d find it tacky.

But her tears told him otherwise.

Guilt pricked him. He’d wanted to make her happy, not cry.

10/10
Alexander cradled her gently. Her tears unraveled him.

"Don’t like it? Next anniversary, I’ll do better," he promised.

But the truth?

She couldn’t have loved it more.
###Chapter 655

Evelyn melted into Alexander's arms.

The faint scent of whiskey clung to Alexander's skin from the drinks he'd had earlier. Rather than being unpleasant, the intoxicating aroma only enhanced his masculine allure.

Breathing him in, Evelyn felt lightheaded, as if she'd been drinking too.

Her fingers traced lazy circles on his chest as her cheeks flushed pink. "You kept this all secret from me..."

Her emotions had been on a rollercoaster all day. Never had she imagined Alexander would plan such an elaborate anniversary surprise, nor that he'd put so much thought into making it perfect. "That's what makes it a surprise," Alexander murmured before capturing her lips in a searing kiss.

Evelyn's heart raced uncontrollably, especially when their lips met.

She could see the raw desire burning in Alexander's eyes.

Their embrace tightened as the kiss deepened passionately.

Brushing rose petals aside, Alexander lifted Evelyn onto the bed.

The air was thick with the fragrance of fresh flowers, surrounded by lavish bouquets that heightened the romantic atmosphere.

This anniversary held special meaning, filled with heartfelt sentiment.

Beneath the blankets, they lay in comfortable silence, listening to each other's breathing.

The alcohol's effects were taking hold as Alexander pulled Evelyn flush against him, as if trying to merge their bodies together.

He took advantage of the moment to explore her curves while continuing to claim her lips.

Evelyn knew exactly what Alexander wanted.

But in her current delicate condition, they couldn't afford to be reckless.

Their noses brushed as they breathed each other in. "We have all the time in the world," Evelyn whispered. "There's no need to rush things now." "You're right," Alexander conceded hoarsely.

Instead, he poured all his passion into their kisses.

By the time they broke apart, Evelyn was dizzy.

Their bodies pressed together taught Evelyn there were countless ways to kiss.

Her hands, lips, and breath remained fused with Alexander's.

When Alexander panted against her neck, Evelyn kissed his brow before slipping away to the bathroom.

Returning, she trailed damp fingers through his hair only to be immediately pulled back into his embrace.

"Evelyn," he murmured contentedly, arms locking around her waist from behind. "You're too good to me."

A sudden memory made Evelyn blush fiercely.

Alexander seemed boneless now, clinging to her affectionately.

And so they slept, wrapped in each other's arms all night.

While they enjoyed their tender moment, darker events unfolded elsewhere.

Vanessa found herself bound in a sack, dragged away by Dominic.

When the hood was removed, she blinked in the unfamiliar room.

Her first instinct was to protect her belly.

During the entire journey, she'd racked her brain but couldn't fathom why Dominic would do this.

They'd never even spoken before - the Caldwells and Powells barely interacted.

This kidnapping made no sense.

She briefly wondered if Ethan owed Dominic money.

Ethan had been struggling with his startup funding lately.

But that money came from Dominic's brother, so that couldn't be it.

"Dominic, why kidnap me?" Vanessa demanded.

"You tell me," Dominic countered, swirling his wine glass. "Did you really think you could cause trouble on my turf without consequences?"

Vanessa froze as realization dawned.

The drugged water bottle she'd discarded earlier...

But she'd been so careful! How could he possibly know? "I don't know what you're talking about!"

"Don't play dumb." Dominic suddenly grabbed her chin. "This is the glass you threw away. I had it retrieved."

A dangerous glint entered his eyes. "I even saved the contents."

He brought the glass closer. "Care for a taste?"

Vanessa paled instantly - drinking this while pregnant would be suicide.

"Dominic, don't! I'm carrying a child - this could kill us both!" Genuine fear gripped her.

Everyone knew Dominic's impulsive nature. Once provoked, nothing could stop him.

This was no empty threat.

"Money? Is that what you want?" Vanessa gritted out. "Name your price, just don't make me drink that!"

Her baby had been diagnosed with a heart condition, but she refused to give up.

This poison would be certain death.

And losing this child might mean never conceiving again.

Dominic tilted his head innocently. "If you can't drink it, why give it to her?"

Vanessa's eyes widened as understanding struck - this was about Evelyn.

"You...you're doing this for Evelyn?" Her laugh turned shrill. "First Ethan, then Alexander, now you? How many men has that woman seduced?"

Dominic found her laughter grating.

In one swift motion, he forced the glass toward her mouth.

Vanessa jerked her head violently, smashing the glass against her forehead.

Liquid splattered across the floor as glass shards rained down.

She didn't even register the cut on her brow, only relief.

Dominic's eyes turned glacial. "Well played. Now you've really pissed me off."
###Chapter 656

Dominic Powell stood like a demon emerging from the depths of hell, his aura radiating pure menace.

Vanessa Hart lifted her head, crimson trails of blood seeping from her temple into her eyes.

Yet she didn't flinch. Relief washed over her instead.

The danger had passed. At least for now, the baby in her womb remained unharmed.

Dominic recognized that look in Vanessa's eyes. With a violent jerk, he threw her onto the cold concrete floor.

Vanessa instinctively cradled her belly, tears of pain gathering at the corners of her eyes.

The man was utterly deranged!

What kind of monster would treat a pregnant woman this way?

Then Dominic produced a baseball bat from nowhere.

He tested its weight in his hands with casual swings. "Wonder what would happen," he mused, "if I brought this down on you?"

Genuine terror gripped Vanessa now.

As Dominic advanced step by deliberate step, she scrambled backward, hands protectively covering her abdomen.

The unyielding wall behind her offered no escape.

"Dominic, please," she begged, voice trembling. "Let me go."

"If I spare you, who will spare her?" Dominic's grin widened at Vanessa's distress.

His cruel laughter echoed as he took in her pallid, fear-stricken face.

Vanessa's entire body shook uncontrollably.

When Dominic raised the bat high, aiming for her stomach, she squeezed her eyes shut in hopeless resignation. Sweat mingled with blood as it trickled down her forehead.

Death seemed imminent.

Then an unexpected voice cut through the tension. "Dominic, stop this madness!"

Sebastian Powell.

His arm hung in a sling, likely from a fracture.

Recently thrown from a horse, the beast had trampled his chest brutally.

Though discharged, his complexion still bore signs of lingering illness.

Seeing another human presence, Vanessa clutched at this lifeline desperately.

"Mr. Powell! Your brother's lost his mind! He's trying to kill my baby with that bat!"

Though merely business acquaintances from past dealings, Sebastian helped Vanessa up. "Mrs. Caldwell, you're safe now. I'll get you out."

Sebastian hadn't come alone - his personal security detail stood ready.

Dominic's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Interfering, brother? Stealing my plaything?"

"Do you even comprehend who she is?" Sebastian hissed. "Indulge your whims elsewhere, but don't drag the Powell name through this!"

His logic was sound.

Behind Vanessa stood the formidable Hayes and Caldwell families.

The Caldwells alone ranked among Cresthaven's elite.

Harm to Vanessa's unborn child would bring the Powells catastrophic consequences.

Dominic scoffed. "Since when do I fear them?"

"Father would disown you for this!"

Under the pretense of familial concern, Sebastian ordered his men to escort Vanessa away.

Dominic suddenly leveled the bat at Sebastian's good arm. "Always meddling, aren't you? That horse clearly didn't kick hard enough."

Sebastian met the threat with a thin smile. "Should I thank you for that near-miss? The hoof barely grazed my heart."

Their gazes locked in silent, venomous standoff.

Sebastian grasped the bat's tip and pushed it aside gently. "This belongs on a field, not aimed at people. Don't you agree?"

Dominic's laugh was chilling. "I've never played baseball. To me, this is no different than a gun - both exist to end lives."

"Then I'll teach you myself," Sebastian countered smoothly, "once my arm heals."

Nathaniel Powell watched this exchange, sweat beading on his forehead.

"Mr. Powell, they're gone..." he ventured timidly.

"I have eyes, Nathaniel," Dominic snapped.

Vanessa had taken quite the fall tonight. Between the physical trauma and psychological terror, she'd likely think twice before crossing Evelyn again.

Dominic's prediction proved accurate.

Though medical scans confirmed her baby's safety, Vanessa checked into the hospital immediately.

She placed a call to Eleanor Caldwell.

"Eleanor, it's Vanessa..."

After hearing the night's events, Eleanor arranged for Vanessa's hospitalization.

"How could Ethan abandon you like this?" Eleanor scolded while instructing Grace to summon her brother.

"Find that irresponsible boy! Out carousing while his wife needs him!"

Grace pouted. Fresh from university break, she'd hoped for relaxation, not family drama.

"If he won't come, let him stay out. What good is he here anyway? Vanessa needs rest, not his useless presence!"

"Grace!" Eleanor snapped.

Reluctantly, Grace took her phone outside.

"Dominic must pay for this!" Vanessa raged from her hospital bed. "He attacked me without provocation!"

She conveniently omitted the drugging incident, painting Dominic as the sole aggressor.

Eleanor's expression darkened. Dominic's notorious behavior was well-known in their circles.

"If he harmed you unprovoked, we'll demand answers!" Though disliking Vanessa, Eleanor couldn't tolerate an insult to Ethan's wife - especially while pregnant. "I'll have his mother rein him in!"

The thought of Dominic facing maternal discipline soothed Vanessa somewhat.

Returning, Grace overheard their plotting. "Mother," she said pointedly, "I doubt we're getting the full story. People don't attack pregnant women without cause." Her gaze bored into Vanessa. "She must've provoked Dominic and can't admit it."
###Chapter 657

Ethan Caldwell's mood was darker than the storm clouds gathering over Cresthaven tonight.

When Grace's call came through about Vanessa Hart's hospitalization, his first instinct was to laugh bitterly.

He'd just left their alumni reunion two hours ago. Of course Vanessa would find some dramatic way to pull him back in.

She could've easily hailed a cab. Cresthaven's taxi service was impeccable. Even if none were available, a simple Uber would suffice. There was absolutely no reason for him to personally chauffeur her home!

After years of dealing with Vanessa, Ethan knew her games all too well. This hospitalization stunt reeked of another desperate ploy for attention.

His heart held no affection for Vanessa. Every thought was consumed by Evelyn Carter - the woman he'd seen at the reunion with Alexander Whitmore as her husband.

He'd convinced himself he'd moved on. Yet seeing Alexander proudly parade as Evelyn's spouse tonight had ripped open old wounds, especially after Alexander's deliberate humiliation.

The Eclipse Lounge's dim lighting did little to mask Ethan's growing intoxication. Between sips of whiskey, memories surfaced - their first meeting when Evelyn was being bullied, curled up in the school bathroom. Those red-rimmed eyes like a frightened rabbit had awakened something primal in his sixteen-year-old self.

Childhood sweethearts. Stolen kisses. Promises whispered in the dark.

All gone now. Alexander had stolen her heart completely.

The realization made Ethan smash his glass against the bar counter.

Trevor Moss materialized beside him, clapping a hand on his shoulder. "Ethan, you're drowning yourself. Heard Dominic Powell kidnapped your wife? Shouldn't you be at the hospital?"

"Can't stand the sight of her," Ethan slurred.

Trevor sighed. "She's carrying your child, man. Hate her all you want, but that baby's innocent."

Ethan barked a laugh. "A clump of cells. Means nothing to me." He lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around his bitter expression.

His violent outburst sent glasses shattering across the floor, summoning manager Jason Wood.

"Mr. Caldwell," Jason began diplomatically, "is our service unsatisfactory?"

Trevor waved him off. "We'll cover the damages."

Only one woman could reduce Ethan to this state - Evelyn Carter. Seeing her tonight must have reopened old wounds.

"Women aren't worth this agony," Trevor advised, snapping his fingers at Jason. "Bring us some fresh company."

Moments later, Jason returned with a doe-eyed brunette named Lillian Harper. Unlike the other bar girls, her modest attire and shy demeanor stood out.

"Lillian will ensure your evening improves," Jason winked before departing.

Lillian approached cautiously. Noticing whiskey dripping down Ethan's collar, she dabbed it gently with a tissue. Ethan kept his eyes closed, barely acknowledging her presence.

Trevor leaned in conspiratorially. "Vanessa's pregnant. How long has it been since you two...?"

Even without the pregnancy, Ethan had no desire to touch Vanessa.

The memory of Grace's call resurfaced. Reluctant as he was, hospital formalities demanded his attention.

"I'm leaving." Ethan grabbed his jacket but staggered drunkenly.

Lillian caught him instinctively.

Ethan moved to shove her away - until their eyes met.

Those wide, innocent eyes. That vulnerable expression. For a heart-stopping moment, he saw Evelyn gazing back at him.

Trevor seized the opportunity to slip away. "Enjoy yourself, Ethan. I'll be on the dance floor."

Lillian's cheeks flushed as she bent to retrieve his jacket. "Mr. Caldwell, let me help—"

Ethan gripped her chin suddenly. "Why don't you call me Ethan anymore?" His voice cracked with longing - Evelyn always used his first name.

"Ethan," Lillian whispered, the name slipping past her lips like a secret.

That soft, breathy tone sent heat coiling through him. Before reason could intervene, Ethan pinned her to the leather couch, his movements rough with desperation.

"Evelyn," he growled against her neck, "is Alexander really better than me? I can give you everything he can. Why won't you even look at me?" His hips pressed insistently against hers. "Love me again, please..."

Lillian trembled beneath him, her inexperience evident. Yet fearing his displeasure, she wrapped her arms around his neck. "Ethan... slower," she pleaded.

Her submission shattered his last shreds of control. In his whiskey-hazed mind, it was Evelyn beneath him as he lost himself completely.
###Chapter 658

Claire blinked in confusion as the crisp night air hit her flushed cheeks. "What are you doing here?" she slurred, swaying slightly on her designer heels.

The hotel lobby lights cast long shadows as she stumbled outside. Most of her classmates had already left with their spouses or partners. Being single, Claire had stayed until the bitter end.

Three male classmates immediately swarmed around her like vultures. "Let us take you home," they offered simultaneously, their eyes gleaming with poorly concealed interest.

Claire let out a bitter laugh that turned into a hiccup. "Since when did I become so popular?" She poked the nearest man's chest with a manicured finger. "Or is it my bank account you're after?"

Though intoxicated, her words cut sharp as knives. "Rich women aren't stupid these days. We don't waste time on gold-digging losers." She'd learned from Julian Mercer that mixing social classes never ended well.

Money couldn't buy happiness, but poverty guaranteed misery - especially in relationships. More importantly, Claire refused to spend her hard-earned fortune on undeserving men.

The rejected suitors scattered like cockroaches under light, leaving only one figure standing resolutely beside her.

Claire squinted up at the towering silhouette. At 6'2", he made her feel petite despite her own height. "Still here? Didn't you hear me? Or are you just more shameless than the others?" she challenged.

Ignoring her barb, he firmly grasped her wrist. "Call a driver for your car. I'm taking you home."

Claire yanked her arm free. "Who died and made you my keeper?" Her gaze landed on the gleaming Mercedes idling nearby, noting the Cresthaven license plates. At least this one wasn't after her money.

As another gust of wind made her shiver, he suddenly bent to her eye level. "Max Harrison. Your desk partner who let you copy all my homework. Ring any bells?"

Memories surfaced through the alcohol haze - the transfer student whose family moved south for business. She'd once submitted his paper with his name still on it, earning a public scolding from their teacher.

The realization sobered her slightly. "Max? What brings you back to this reunion?"

"Business trip," he said simply, opening the car door. The interior light illuminated his sharp jawline. "Get in before you freeze."

Claire hesitated, then sneezed violently. Before she could react, a warm coat enveloped her shoulders.

Lucas appeared like a specter from the shadows, his shirt billowing in the wind. "No need for your assistance, Harrison," he said, possessively gripping Claire's shoulder.

The tension between the two men became palpable. Lucas's gaze never wavered as he declared, "I'll take my woman home myself."

Max's expression darkened, but he merely said, "Another time then, Claire," before disappearing into the Mercedes.

Only then did Claire process Lucas's words. She shoved him away violently. "I'm not your anything, Lucas! We're divorced - have some dignity!"

Lucas smirked. "Dignity? You used to worship the ground I walked on."

"That was before I grew a spine," Claire shot back, her alcohol-flushed face twisting in contempt.

Suddenly, Lucas hoisted her over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes. "Put me down!" she shrieked, the upside-down position making her stomach churn dangerously.

"Making sure you get home safe," Lucas said calmly, marching toward his car.

"Your funeral," Claire warned ominously.

Then she vomited all over his pristine white shirt.

Lucas froze, his entire body tensing. The man notorious for his germaphobia didn't even flinch. After a beat, he simply wiped himself off with tissues from the console.

As the car pulled away, Claire stared in disbelief. "What's your game?" she demanded.

Lucas met her gaze steadily. "Isn't it obvious? I'm courting you."

The declaration hung in the air as the city lights blurred past. Claire's intoxicated mind struggled to process this new version of Lucas - one who didn't rage at her drunken mishaps, one who spoke of pursuit rather than possession.

The rules of their relationship had changed, and Claire wasn't sure she wanted to learn this new game.
###Chapter 659

Claire gazed at Lucas standing before her for what felt like an eternity.

Her mind raced. "Did I have one too many drinks tonight?"

"Was he actually asking me out?"

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

"It's over between us, Lucas. We've known each other for years. Why put on this act now? Save your charming lines for other women - I became immune to them long ago."

Had Lucas said those words five years ago, when they were newly married, Claire's heart might have fluttered wildly.

Back then, she would have melted at such attention from the man she adored.

But now? Now those same words felt like salt in an open wound.

Claire had poured her heart out to Lucas, only to have him shatter it carelessly.

Only after losing her did he realize what he'd thrown away.

If he truly cared, why wait until it was too late?

It had taken every ounce of Claire's strength to walk away from that toxic marriage.

Why would she ever consider diving back into that nightmare?

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...

"Let's keep this professional." Claire turned toward the window, blinking back unexpected tears.

"We'll co-parent Bella. As for us? If you're lonely, go find someone else."

Lucas suddenly seized her hand, pressing it against his chest.

"Do you really think I'd chase after just anyone?" His voice was rough with emotion.

Through the thin fabric of his shirt, Claire could feel the steady thud of his heartbeat against her palm.

The city lights blurred past the window, casting shifting shadows across Lucas's intense expression. "I'm serious, Claire. We have a child together. Give me a chance to make things right."

The raw vulnerability in his eyes made her stomach flip.

She yanked her hand back. "My answer is no."

The next morning, Evelyn stirred awake to sunlight streaming through the curtains.

Alexander had prepared breakfast himself, keeping everything warm in insulated containers.

The milk was perfectly heated - just how she liked it.

This small act of tenderness made Evelyn's heart swell.

Even after a year of marriage, Alexander still made her feel like a newlywed.

His quiet devotion gave her an unshakable sense of security, like she had an impenetrable fortress at her back.

Especially when she curled into his arms, her cheeks would inexplicably flush.

She adored the faint scent of his cologne, the way her name sounded in his deep voice - it made her feel like the luckiest woman alive.

Evelyn had just finished eating when Alexander called.

"I've sent Simon to pick up Isabella from the hospital. Are you absolutely certain about this? It's not too late to change your mind."

Their home had become a sanctuary for their love. Bringing in a woman who harbored feelings for Alexander...

The thought made Evelyn's skin crawl.

"Let her stay," Evelyn insisted. "I've been cooped up for months with this pregnancy. Having company might relieve the boredom."

Truthfully, Evelyn suspected Isabella's blindness was an elaborate ruse.

Without proof though, this was the perfect way to catch her in the act.

If Isabella was faking, she couldn't maintain the charade indefinitely.

Alexander sighed. "Fine. But promise me you'll be careful. No confrontations."

An hour later, Isabella arrived with Susan, the housekeeper Alexander had assigned to assist them.

Isabella dramatically groped the air. "Susan? Are we at Alexander's?"

Susan nodded politely at Evelyn before remembering Isabella couldn't see. "Yes, Miss Morgan."

"Help me to the sofa, please."

As they passed, Susan greeted Evelyn. "Mrs. Whitmore."

Isabella stiffened. "Evelyn's here?"

"Obviously." Evelyn took a deliberate bite of an apple. "This is my home. And since you'll be staying with us, we should get to know each other better."

Isabella's stomach churned.

Friends?

The idea was laughable.

When Simon collected her from the hospital, Isabella had been elated.

But learning this was Evelyn's idea? That set off every alarm bell.

Why would her rival invite her into their marital home?

There had to be an ulterior motive.

"You're quite the actress," Evelyn murmured, leaning close. "You dropped your blood packet when you 'fell' down the stairs."

Isabella's breath hitched.

"Relax. Alexander doesn't know... yet." Evelyn patted her shoulder. "Keep up the performance."

With that, Evelyn sauntered off, leaving Isabella paralyzed with dread.

"Keep pretending?"

Did Evelyn know? Was this a test?

The question gnawed at Isabella all day.

When Alexander returned that evening, Evelyn launched herself at him.

"Darling, I missed you..." Her voice dripped honey as she pulled him into a passionate kiss.

Alexander froze. His normally reserved wife had never been so bold.

Forgotten was Isabella's presence as desire surged through him. His arms encircled Evelyn's waist. "Sweetheart, you taste divine."

His voice dropped to a husky whisper as he deepened the kiss, one hand cradling the back of her head.

Evelyn let him trail kisses down her neck while watching Isabella's reaction.

Isabella sat rigid, nails digging into her palms.

The audacity! Doing this right in front of her!

But playing blind meant pretending not to notice.

She had to sit there, silently seething.

This was Evelyn's game all along - flaunting what Isabella could never have.

And the worst part? She had to take it.
###Chapter 660

Evelyn and Alexander were locked in a passionate embrace near the foyer, their lips meeting in heated kisses.

Isabella watched as Evelyn melted into Alexander's arms, her cheeks flushed from their intense affection.

Despite her pregnancy, Evelyn clung to Alexander's neck, refusing to break their connection.

Isabella gritted her teeth.

How can she be so shameless? She’s pregnant!

Doesn’t she care about the baby?

They still act like this at night?

Unable to take it anymore, Isabella slammed her hands on the table and stood abruptly—only to lose her footing and crash to the floor with a loud thud.

Alexander had been too absorbed in Evelyn to notice anything else, but the noise snapped him out of his daze.

His desire evaporated instantly.

His expression darkened as he turned toward the sound.

"Alexander, is that you? I—I fell… It hurts…" Isabella whimpered, her voice trembling with fake distress.

Alexander shot Evelyn a glance before walking over.

"If you can’t see, don’t move around recklessly," he said coldly, helping her up.

Isabella sniffled. "It was so quiet… I didn’t realize anyone was here…"

"Susan will take you upstairs to rest," Alexander said dismissively.

"But I’ve been alone all day," Isabella protested. "Since you’re home now, will you take me for a walk?"

"I just got back from work. I’m tired," he replied bluntly. "If you want to go out, Susan can accompany you."

Isabella seethed at yet another rejection.

Alexander didn’t wait for a response before heading upstairs to shower.

Evelyn smirked, sticking her tongue out at Isabella when Alexander wasn’t looking.

Isabella saw the taunt but had to pretend she didn’t—her blind act left her powerless to retaliate.

Her fists clenched in silent fury.

Earlier, Evelyn had workers install surveillance cameras throughout the living room and hallways, making no effort to hide it from Isabella.

It was a clear challenge.

Evelyn was daring her to slip up.

Now, every inch of the house was monitored—except the bedrooms and bathrooms.

Alexander had mentioned sending her abroad once her "vision improved."

But Isabella refused.

He’d offered another option—marrying Dominic Powell—but the thought made her blood run cold.

Dominic was unhinged.

And if he ever found out about her past with his brother, Sebastian…

She shuddered.

No, pretending to be blind was her safest option—for now.

That night, as Evelyn lay in bed, Alexander pulled her close.

"Why the cameras?" he murmured.

Evelyn shrugged. "Just making sure there’s no confusion if something happens with Isabella."

Alexander sighed. "You still don’t trust me? I told you, I believe you about the stairs—"

"So you think she threw herself down?" Evelyn challenged.

Alexander hesitated.

He didn’t believe Evelyn would push her, but the idea that Isabella would harm herself was equally absurd.

He was about to respond when his phone rang.

An unknown number.

The voice on the other end was clear in the quiet room.

"Mr. Whitmore? Your nephew’s at the police station—got into a fight. Can you come down?"

Nephew?

Ethan?

Who would be stupid enough to pick a fight with Ethan Caldwell?

And how did it land him in jail?

Alexander frowned. "What happened?"

"Some girl caused a scene. Jealousy, probably."

Of course.

Ethan was married, yet still fooling around. If Vanessa found out…

Alexander rubbed his temples. "Evelyn, I need to go. Don’t wait up."

Evelyn pouted but nodded.

Then, just as he turned to leave, she grabbed his collar and pulled him into a deep kiss.

Her lips trailed to his neck. "Come back soon," she whispered.

Alexander groaned, desire flaring again.

"If you keep this up, I’ll have to shower again," he muttered, voice rough.

Evelyn giggled, hiding under the covers.

Alexander grabbed his jacket and left—only to nearly collide with Isabella in the hallway.

She was fumbling blindly, arms outstretched.

"Alexander? Where are you going? Can I come?"

He stiffened.

"It’s late. Stay inside."

Isabella smiled sweetly. "Thank you for worrying about me."

"I’m not," Alexander said flatly. His gaze dropped to her white nightgown.

With her hair loose and pale dress, she looked like a ghost.

"I just don’t want you scaring Evelyn."

Isabella’s smile froze.

Before she could reply, Alexander was already gone.

Police Station

Ethan Caldwell slumped on a bench, nursing a split lip and a bruised nose.

His usually pristine suit was disheveled, shirt unbuttoned to reveal his toned chest.

Trevor Moss, his equally battered friend, groaned beside him.

"I told you that girl was trouble!"

In the corner, Lillian Harper cowered beside her boyfriend—a plain-looking man with worse injuries than Ethan and Trevor combined.

The boyfriend shoved her away as she tried to wipe blood from his mouth.

"Was I not enough for you?" he demanded, voice raw with betrayal.

Lillian flinched, unable to meet his eyes.

Ethan smirked, wiping his own blood away.

This night was far from over.
###Chapter 661

"I'm sorry. It only happened once with him."

Lillian Harper looked utterly ashamed, as if she'd only resorted to such actions when desperate for money.

She never expected her boyfriend would catch them red-handed that very night.

Ethan Caldwell couldn't take it anymore. "Stop it. How could you hit a woman?"

"Shut your mouth! You slept with my girlfriend—I should've beaten you to death tonight!"

"Enough!"

The officer's sharp command silenced them.

When Alexander Whitmore arrived, his gaze locked onto Lillian’s eyes—so eerily similar to Evelyn’s—and everything clicked into place.

Alexander’s presence was commanding. The moment he stepped in, the entire station fell into a hush, all eyes drawn to him.

Late at night, his expression was stormy, his eyes as cold as the midnight air.

An officer immediately approached. "Mr. Whitmore."

Without hesitation, Alexander said, "Where do I pay the bail?"

The man led him into a room. Minutes later, the paperwork was signed, and Alexander strode back out.

His icy gaze landed on Ethan. "Aren’t you leaving? Why are you still sitting here?"

Ethan finally moved.

Trevor Moss hurried after Alexander. "Mr. Whitmore, thank you for tonight. I won’t take up any more of your time—I’ll get going!"

With that, Trevor bolted as if fleeing a predator.

As they left, the officer turned to Lillian and her boyfriend, still seated.

"Why are you two still here? You’re free to go."

Lillian blinked in shock. "But no one bailed us out yet..."

"Mr. Whitmore covered your bail. You can leave."

Lillian froze. That man who just walked in?

Her boyfriend scoffed. "Who does he think he is? We don’t need his charity!"

Lillian yanked his arm. "Shut up! Do you want to rot in here for days?"

Outside, Alexander was already in his car. Seeing Ethan lingering, he frowned. "What are you waiting for? Get in."

Ethan didn’t want Alexander here.

It was humiliating—getting into a brawl over a woman and needing his rival to bail him out.

Again, he’d lost to Alexander.

Trevor hadn’t wanted to involve his family, so he’d called Alexander instead.

"Uncle Alexander, I’ll transfer the bail money later."

Ethan reluctantly opened the passenger door and slid in.

He’d arrived in a police car—his own was still parked outside Eclipse Lounge.

Alexander started the engine, but instead of heading toward Whitmore Manor, he drove toward the hospital where Vanessa Hart was still recovering.

Ethan, drunk and drowsy, slumped against the window.

Alexander didn’t hesitate. He yanked Ethan out and punched him square in the face.

The force snapped Ethan awake.

A bruise bloomed on his cheek, blood trickling from his split lip.

Staggering, Ethan braced himself against the car, wiping his mouth.

He looked wrecked—but unsurprised.

"I couldn’t have her, so I settled for a lookalike. Uncle Alexander, even if you’re pissed, you had no right to hit me."

Alexander’s fist flew again.

Ethan’s lip swelled further.

"You didn’t appreciate her when she was yours. Now you’re playing the heartbroken fool? Pathetic."

Alexander’s voice was glacial, his face shadowed.

"The first punch was for me. The second was for Evelyn. Get your act together."

He turned to leave.

Then Ethan noticed it—a fresh love bite on Alexander’s neck.

His stomach twisted. Did Evelyn do that?

Was she always this bold with him?

Alexander’s phone rang, shattering the silence.

Ethan heard Evelyn’s sleepy voice, soft and sweet.

"Darling, when are you coming home? I had a nightmare... I’m scared without you here. I miss you..."

Ethan went still.

He’d never seen Alexander’s fury dissolve so fast, replaced by warmth.

Alexander smiled—genuine, radiant.

"I’ll be home in ten minutes."

"I’ll see you then?"

Evelyn’s voice was drowsy. "The baby kicked earlier... I think they missed their daddy. Hurry back and hold me..."

Alexander’s grin widened. He couldn’t wait to wrap her in his arms.

The car vanished into the night, leaving Ethan standing alone.

The taillights faded into darkness.

The world felt vast, yet Ethan was trapped—circling the same pain, unable to escape.

Evelyn had been right there, within reach.

And he’d thrown her away.

No substitute could ever replace her.

Tears spilled over. His face was wet, his chest hollow.

He was crying over a woman.

Because he’d destroyed the best thing he’d ever had.

Alexander arrived home exactly ten minutes later.

Evelyn’s smile lit up the room the second the door opened.

She sat up, switching on the lamp.

Alexander pulled her into his arms. "Mrs. Whitmore, I heard you missed me."

Her heart raced as his stubble brushed her cheek, sending shivers down her spine.

She nodded. "You were gone two hours and forty minutes. I missed you the whole—"

His kiss swallowed her words.

Alexander’s lips were as intoxicating as his gaze.

If she weren’t pregnant, he’d have taken her right then.

When they broke apart, Evelyn gasped for air—then noticed the bruises on his knuckles.

Her eyes widened. "Did you hit him?"

Alexander’s jaw tightened, thinking of Ethan’s cheap imitation of Evelyn.

"Are you worried about him?"

Evelyn traced his lips. "Alexander, I’m worried about you. Does it hurt?"
###Chapter 662

Evelyn rushed downstairs barefoot, her soles meeting the cool marble as she frantically searched for the medical kit. Alexander's injury had her heart pounding.

She grabbed antiseptic and cotton pads, gently pulling Alexander onto the sofa with determined hands.

"Honestly, Alexander Whitmore," she chided while dabbing at his wound, "getting into fights and coming home injured? Some battle strategy."

Alexander reclined against the cushions, watching through half-lidded eyes as Evelyn fussed over him.

Each careful touch sent warmth through him. The pain was worth this rare tenderness.

No one had ever treated his wounds with such devotion. No one had ever cared if he hurt.

Seeing it was just a surface cut, Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Keep this dry for three days. Be careful when-"

Alexander swept her onto his lap in one fluid motion, her legs straddling him.

Evelyn gasped as his hands settled on her waist, her entire body cradled against him.

Without ceremony, Alexander stood, supporting her bottom as he carried her upstairs. "Alexander! Put me down! I can walk!" she protested, cheeks flaming.

"You're barefoot," he stated simply, as if this explained everything.

Evelyn buried her face in his neck, surrendering to his embrace as he ascended effortlessly.

The intimacy left her breathless - too flustered to struggle even if she'd wanted to.

At the landing, Alexander pinned her against the door, claiming her lips in a searing kiss.

Evelyn giggled between kisses. "Alexander...not here..."

From her bedroom doorway, Isabella froze at the sight.

She'd risen from bed, drawn by the commotion, only to witness Alexander and Evelyn lost in each other.

Her chest constricted. With a frustrated growl, she slammed her door shut.

Unbearable! She couldn't stay another minute!

That evening, Ethan appeared at the hospital with a bruised face, immediately drawing Vanessa's attention.

"What happened?" she demanded. Ethan remained silent, offering no explanation.

Vanessa's eyes narrowed. She'd get answers one way or another.

By morning, she'd learned Ethan had been seen with a woman of questionable reputation.

Rage ignited in her veins. "Pining for Evelyn is one thing, but finding some lookalike replacement?" She couldn't confront Ethan directly, so when Eleanor visited, Vanessa unleashed her fury.

To her shock, Eleanor seemed indifferent, advising her to focus on the pregnancy.

How could she focus when her husband was chasing another woman?

Eleanor had never approved of her, and now even Eleanor wouldn't take her side.

Tears spilled down Vanessa's cheeks as despair overwhelmed her.

This marriage she'd fought so hard for had become her prison.

Everything was crumbling - even her unborn child had congenital heart defects, leaving her terrified of the future.

Grace watched awkwardly as Vanessa sobbed, clutching her hand and pouring out marital woes.

At twenty-two and still in college, Grace struggled to empathize. She'd never been in a serious relationship.

To her, Vanessa was simply reaping what she'd sown.

Eventually, Vanessa cried herself to sleep, tear stains darkening her pillow.

Grace shook her head. "This is why I'm sticking to fictional men. No marriage, no kids - just peace."

Meanwhile, Isabella's charade at Whitmore Manor was wearing thin.

With security cameras everywhere, maintaining her blind act was exhausting.

She opted to hide in her room, sleeping through the day.

When Evelyn noticed Isabella still hadn't emerged by ten, she knocked. "Isabella? You in there?"

"Ugh, Evelyn! I'm sleeping!" came the irritated reply.

Evelyn's voice was light. "Come on, bestie! I'm bored out of my mind!"

"Bestie? Don't call me that!" Isabella yanked the covers higher.

Evelyn smiled. "I've got cherries! I'll even wash them for you."

Isabella gritted her teeth. This wasn't about fruit - Evelyn was mocking her.

She had to know about the ruse. Why else install all those cameras?

"I hate cherries!" Isabella snapped.

Evelyn continued cheerfully. "Grapes then? Mangoes? I'll cube them perfectly - oh wait, you can't see them!"

"Isabella, why keep pretending?" Evelyn pressed. "Doesn't it get uncomfortable?"

Silence.

Isabella tossed violently, nearing her breaking point.

Recognizing the limit, Evelyn retreated, satisfied with her strategy.

Having Isabella under her roof was brilliant - any mischief would require careful planning now.

The doorbell interrupted her thoughts.

Evelyn opened the door to find a stunning woman holding a gift.

"Can I help you?" Evelyn asked, momentarily stunned.

The woman smiled warmly. "I'm Victoria Clarke. Thank you for saving me."

Evelyn's eyes widened in recognition. "Victoria?"
###Chapter 663

Victoria Clarke wasn't just any ordinary friend. She was Evelyn Carter's former classmate and Sebastian Powell's betrothed.

Their wedding date had been set, mere days away, when Victoria was suddenly taken hostage.

The kidnappers demanded an astronomical ransom - 100 million dollars - with threats to execute her if unpaid.

Dominic Powell had been present when Nathaniel delivered this devastating news, which Evelyn accidentally overheard.

Witnessing the Clarke family's desperate scramble to raise the funds, Evelyn felt compelled to intervene.

Though years had passed since their last contact, she couldn't bear the thought of her once-vibrant classmate meeting such a tragic end.

Without hesitation, Evelyn wired 30 million dollars to the Clarke family.

While it didn't cover the full amount, her generous contribution was met with tearful gratitude.

Today, Victoria arrived personally to express her thanks.

Evelyn immediately welcomed her inside.

"Evelyn," Victoria began earnestly, "I can't accept this as charity. Consider it a loan. Once my family recovers, we'll repay every cent with interest."

The Clarke fortune had been decimated by the ransom demand, leaving them drowning in debts.

Evelyn nodded understandingly, though her assistance had been given freely without expectation.

Yet Evelyn couldn't ignore Victoria's transformation. Once the spoiled Clarke heiress known for her haughty demeanor, she now carried herself with unexpected humility.

"I heard about your class reunion," Victoria mentioned, eyes lowered.

"Yes, we had one. Why didn't you come?" Evelyn inquired gently.

Victoria's voice softened. "Fresh from captivity... I wasn't exactly in a celebratory mood."

Evelyn's chest tightened with sympathy. "I can't begin to imagine..."

"But you're safe now. That's what matters."

A heavy sigh escaped Victoria's lips. "Rumors are spreading... about what those men did to me. The Powells are breaking off my engagement to Sebastian."

Their match had always been more about alliances than affection, but this public rejection would devastate the already struggling Clarke family.

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock.

She realized: "This withdrawal would confirm everyone's darkest suspicions about Victoria's ordeal."

"Honestly?" Victoria shrugged with surprising composure. "This whole nightmare revealed people's true colors. Maybe this broken engagement is a blessing."

Evelyn nodded firmly. "It proves Sebastian never deserved you. You'll find someone who values you properly. Don't waste tears on him."

Victoria's sudden laughter brightened the room. "When did you become so eloquent, Evelyn? I don't remember you having this silver tongue in school. I like it!"

The comment seemed to genuinely touch Victoria.

Their conversation flowed effortlessly, revealing a warmth and authenticity Evelyn hadn't remembered from their school days.

As noon approached, Evelyn invited Victoria to stay for lunch.

Victoria accepted eagerly.

After Susan prepared the table, Evelyn went upstairs to fetch Isabella.

Isabella initially refused but reconsidered when her empty stomach protested. With slight hesitation, she descended.

Victoria's eyebrows shot up at the unfamiliar woman's appearance.

Watching Isabella navigate the stairs with Susan's help, Victoria leaned close and whispered, "Who's that?"

Evelyn's lips curved mischievously. "My husband's childhood friend."

Victoria's jaw dropped. "Wait - Alexander brought his childhood friend to live with you? And you're okay with this? Isn't this... unusual?"

Evelyn shook her head calmly. "Actually, it was my idea."

Victoria looked utterly perplexed.

"You're keeping your rival under the same roof? Isn't that inviting trouble? Doesn't it make you... uncomfortable?"

Evelyn whispered something in Victoria's ear.

As comprehension dawned, admiration lit Victoria's features.

She thought, "I wonder who's really feeling uncomfortable here?"

Noticing the whispers, Isabella interjected sharply, "I hear new voices. Do we have company?"

Spotting Victoria but pretending otherwise, Isabella's curiosity got the better of her.

Quick-witted, Victoria smiled brightly. "Hello, Ms. Morgan. I'm Evelyn's friend."

Isabella's face darkened at the mention.

"But I have another identity too," Victoria added playfully. "Care to guess?"

Isabella scoffed, dropping into a dining chair. "Not particularly interested."

She motioned for Susan to assist with her meal, using her supposed blindness as justification.

Victoria took her seat, casually lifting a water glass, her eyes glinting with purpose.

"Ms. Morgan, I can heal your eyes," she declared calmly.

Before Isabella could react—

Victoria flung the water directly into Isabella's face.

The cold splash hit like a physical blow, drenching Isabella completely.

Isabella surged up, wiping her face furiously. "Have you lost your mind?!"

Victoria smiled triumphantly. "Told you I could fix your vision. Look at you now—seeing perfectly!"

Evelyn, mindful of Alexander's surveillance, remained still. But Victoria faced no such restraints.

The instinctive flinch betrayed Isabella's deception—captured perfectly by the high-definition cameras.

Isabella had grown weary of the charade anyway.

These past days of forced blindness had been suffocating; exposure brought unexpected relief.

"So what if I faked it? None of your damn business!" Isabella snapped.

Victoria replied coolly, "I'm Victoria Clarke. Evelyn's friend. Homewrecking never ends well—I suggest you reconsider your choices."

Isabella froze mid-retort.

Recognition dawned: "Victoria? Sebastian's Victoria?"

Memories of her complicated history with Sebastian stirred unexpected guilt.

Her bravado crumbled. Appetite gone, she retreated upstairs, slamming her bedroom door.

After lunch, Victoria prepared to leave.

Evelyn walked her out, embracing her warmly.

"I can't believe she helped expose Isabella's act," Evelyn thought gratefully.

Victoria grinned. "Honestly? After everything, that splash felt amazing. Like therapy."

As Victoria entered her car, ready to depart, her gaze caught on a familiar silhouette near the property.

Her pulse spiked as she squinted in disbelief.

The man bore an uncanny resemblance to one of her kidnappers!
###Chapter 664

Victoria's breath hitched as her gaze locked onto the figure across the street.

Her pulse thundered in her ears.

The man wore a battered baseball cap pulled low, shadows swallowing his features, but she'd recognize that posture anywhere.

This was the same monster who'd demanded 100 million dollars from the Clarke family.

Though they'd negotiated down to 80 million, the stolen fortune could have saved her father's failing business.

"Why now? Is he coming for me again?"

Cold terror slithered down her spine as memories of dank basement walls and rough ropes binding her wrists resurfaced. Her foot hovered over the accelerator.

She considered dialing 911 but hesitated.

This predator had snatched her from Cresthaven's busiest avenue without witnesses.

If he belonged to an organized syndicate, police involvement might trigger deadly retaliation.

These animals fed on fear - she wouldn't risk provoking the hornet's nest.

For now, silence was her armor.

During her captivity, she'd glimpsed her captor's face in a moment of daring.

While guards argued over cards, she'd loosened her blindfold just enough.

One look at the armed men surrounding her had crushed any escape plans.

But that fleeting moment had burned his features into her memory.

The jagged scar bisecting his nose.

Those icy blue eyes that held no remorse.

The way his underlings had murmured "Andrew" with trembling respect.

Victoria's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel.

The humiliation. The whispers. The ruined reputation.

"I'll make them pay," she vowed under her breath.

Forcing calm into her movements, she pulled away slowly.

When no pursuit came, relief warred with suspicion.

"Am I no longer valuable to them?"

Instead of fleeing, she parked behind a derelict diner and watched.

Andrew lounged against a lamppost, chain-smoking with casual menace.

Shadows moved in adjacent alleys - his pack of wolves, alert for threats.

After stubbing out his third cigarette, he climbed into a matte-black van.

The engine growled to life.

"What were they surveilling?" she wondered.

Adrenaline sharpened her focus as she followed at a discreet distance.

The van wound through Cresthaven's outskirts for fifty-three minutes before stopping near a ramshackle row house.

Victoria knew this neighborhood - a labyrinth of escape routes favored by criminals.

She abandoned her Mercedes in an overgrown lot and approached on foot.

The pack had vanished.

Frustration burned her throat until she spotted a bodega's neon sign.

An idea sparked.

Meanwhile, in a gilded cage...

Isabella Morgan seethed in her borrowed bedroom.

"Who does Evelyn think she is?" She dabbed at her damp blouse, humiliation scalding her cheeks.

The memory of Evelyn's friend "accidentally" spilling ice water down her back made her blood boil.

She stormed toward the hallway before remembering the security cameras.

With a frustrated growl, she retreated.

The vibration of her phone startled her.

Sebastian's name flashed on the screen.

Her lips curled. Right on schedule.

"What?" she snapped.

"Isabella, darling, I've missed you terribly..."

It had been nineteen days since she'd played the blind victim, nineteen days since Sebastian had touched her.

After the plagiarism scandal got her expelled from the symphony, their secret trysts had ceased.

"Your precious fiancée just drenched me in ice water," she hissed. "Perhaps we should end this before she escalates."

"Victoria did what?" Sebastian's voice sharpened. "Anyway, that's irrelevant now. After her kidnapping scandal, the Clarkes are social pariahs. The Powells can't associate with damaged goods."

His tone turned suggestive. "Now there's nothing stopping us from being together properly."

Isabella's stomach twisted.

The broken engagement meant Sebastian would become more relentless.

"I'm at Alexander's estate," she said quickly when he suggested visiting.

Silence.

Then dangerously quiet: "Whitmore took you home? Have you been sharing his bed?"

She knew that lethal calm - Sebastian's violent streak simmering beneath.

"Of course not," she lied. "Don't be absurd."

"Then tell me you still want me," he demanded.

The truth stuck in her throat like broken glass.
###Chapter 665

The moment Evelyn heard Alexander's car pull into the driveway, her pulse quickened.

She hastily ended her call with Sebastian, making some vague excuse about needing to go.

Throwing open her bedroom door, she nearly sprinted downstairs before remembering her predicament.

Her feet froze mid-step.

"What if Alexander discovers my blindness was all an act?"

"Would he exile me to some foreign country?"

Just then, Claire emerged from her room and spotted Evelyn hovering in the hallway.

"Evelyn? Did you hear the car? Were you coming to greet my husband?"

Before Claire could finish, Alexander appeared at the top of the stairs.

His gaze locked onto Claire the moment he entered.

Without hesitation, he swept her into his arms.

"Where are your slippers?" he murmured, concern lacing his voice as he lifted her onto his shoes.

Claire had been napping and rushed out barefoot when she heard his arrival.

"Alexander..." Evelyn tried to interject, but he didn't even glance her way.

The dismissal stung.

When his eyes finally met hers, she saw the truth reflected in them - he knew everything.

He'd come home specifically to confront her.

Instead of anger, his voice was eerily calm. "Evelyn, I'll purchase you a new ticket. Any destination you prefer. I'll handle all arrangements."

The unspoken message was clear - he wanted her gone.

Strangely, the offer tempted her.

Her reputation lay in ruins after the plagiarism scandal involving Claire.

Perhaps leaving the country would give her a fresh start.

With practiced vulnerability, she pleaded, "Alexander, can't I stay? I don't want to go anywhere else! I love it here!"

"Don't be difficult. You have three days to decide." As Andrew's friend, Alexander couldn't abandon his sister completely. "If you can't choose, I'll choose for you - marry Dominic."

Evelyn recoiled as if struck.

"What? I won't marry Dominic!" Her voice rose hysterically. "He's obsessed with your wife! You know this! Marriage to him would be torture!"

With that, she spun on her heel and slammed her bedroom door.

No one dared raise their voice to Alexander like that.

He frowned. "The Morgans are gone. Why does she still act like a spoiled princess? Who indulged this behavior?"

Claire observed the exchange, realizing Alexander treated Evelyn purely as a sister.

His protective demeanor held no romantic undertones.

Her lingering doubts finally eased.

Suddenly, Alexander's attention snapped back to Claire with startling intensity.

"What?" she asked, self-consciously touching her face.

"Even she knows Dominic only wants you," he growled, tilting her chin up until their foreheads nearly touched.

Heat radiated from him as his grip tightened possessively.

The air between them crackled with tension, though irritation still darkened his expression.

Claire never imagined Dominic could provoke Alexander's jealousy.

Alexander pressed her against the wall, his body flush against hers. "You belong to me, Evelyn..."

One hand entwined with hers while the other traced her jawline.

His hooded gaze dropped to her lips just as her phone shattered the moment.

An unknown number flashed on screen.

She ignored it, but the caller persisted.

With a frustrated growl, Alexander snatched the phone and answered.

"Ms. Carter? Where are you? Mr. Powell is injured... he needs you! I'm coming to get you." Nathaniel's panicked voice blared through the speaker.

Claire's stomach dropped.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Who is this?"

Recognizing Alexander's voice, Nathaniel answered bluntly, "Nathaniel Powell, Mr. Powell's assistant."

Jealousy flared in Alexander's eyes.

First Dominic's lingering obsession, now this?

Claire wondered how Nathaniel obtained her number.

As Alexander moved to disconnect, Nathaniel rushed on, "Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Powell is seriously hurt. This isn't a ploy - Ms. Carter's medical skills are his only hope!"

"What injury requires her specifically? Take him to a hospital," Alexander countered coldly.

"It must be Ms. Carter," Nathaniel insisted desperately.

Miranda Powell had recently punished Dominic in the ancestral hall after his kidnapping of Vanessa.

Normally this wouldn't be severe, but Dominic had just recovered from a car accident that shattered his legs.

Despite metal rods supporting his limbs, Miranda forced him to kneel on a washboard for twenty-four hours.

When released, his legs were mutilated beyond recognition.

Nathaniel knew only Claire's acupuncture could save him now.

"Ms. Carter, please! Without your help, he may never walk again!" Nathaniel's voice broke. "His entire life has been suffering - no parental love, taking the fall for family crimes as a teenager..."

"Ten years in prison would have broken him completely if you hadn't given him hope."

The raw plea struck a chord.

Without Claire's intervention, Dominic would never have fought for early release.
###Chapter 666

"Ms. Carter, please help Mr. Powell! He's still in his prime! If he loses mobility, it would be tragic!"

Vanessa fell silent on the call, her thoughts racing.

Nathaniel's mention of prison struck a nerve, dragging up memories of her own incarceration.

Three years had been unbearable enough.

But Dominic? A full decade!

What depth of betrayal must he have felt toward the Powells to choose prison over freedom?

In that moment, Vanessa felt an unexpected kinship with Dominic—two souls who'd endured the system's cruelty.

After hanging up, Alexander noticed Vanessa's distant expression.

Her mind was clearly elsewhere—probably with Dominic.

Following her gaze, he saw her staring intently at the medical kit in the corner.

Alexander's brow furrowed.

After a beat, he made his decision. "Vanessa, if you want to go, then go."

He understood her gift for healing was a calling.

As her husband, his job was to support her unconditionally.

Alexander had always encouraged her medical practice.

Gently cupping her face, he murmured, "But remember—you're mine. Treat him, but don't let Dominic steal you away." Vanessa nodded vigorously, surprised by Alexander's consent.

"I know," she breathed, heart swelling with gratitude.

She grabbed her acupuncture kit and turned to leave, but Alexander caught her hand, his touch warm. "I'll drive you." Vanessa smiled, impulsively pulling him into a tight embrace. Rising on tiptoes, she brushed a kiss against his cheek.

"Where else would I find such an understanding husband? Alexander, you're incredible!"

Men like him were rare, and her admiration deepened.

As they departed, Isabella watched from her window, gaze fixed until their car vanished.

Alexander was sending Vanessa away, but the thought of staying filled her with dread.

After a moment's hesitation, Isabella made her choice.

She packed hastily, dragged her suitcase to the door, and stepped outside.

Near the estate gates, a sleek Cayenne idled at the curb.

The window lowered, revealing Sebastian's smirking face. "Isabella," he called, beckoning.

Isabella froze, instinctively retreating.

It was Sebastian.

Her expression shifted to shock and unease. "What are you doing here?" she thought, fighting the urge to flee. Sebastian seemed oblivious to her discomfort.

He flung the door open, grabbing her wrist and yanking her inside with surprising strength.

Before she could react, Isabella found herself straddling Sebastian's lap, their faces inches apart.

"Isabella, I've missed you," he murmured, leaning in.

Startled, Isabella dropped her suitcase with a thud.

"What are you doing?" she gasped, shoving his chest.

Her mind raced: "This is practically Alexander's doorstep!"

"Couldn't wait," Sebastian breathed. "You weren't answering. Thought you might be coming to me?" Isabella seethed.

"What a lunatic!" she thought. "If I hadn't left, would he have broken in? What if security saw?"

Unseen, a figure in a black cap observed from the shadows.

A lanky companion nudged him. "Andrew, you've been stalking this woman for days? That obsessed?"

Andrew remained silent as the man continued, "But she's clearly into Sebastian. Look at them going at it—damn, that's intense." Andrew yanked the cap over his companion's eyes. "Stop staring!"

Inside the Cayenne, the rocking grew violent.

Andrew turned away. "Let Sebastian handle the next shipment."

His companion nodded, then frowned. "Wait—if you like her, why help your rival?"

"Who said I like her?" Andrew snapped.

The man persisted: "Then why surveil her? What's special about her?"

Andrew's face remained shadowed beneath his cap.

XXXXX

Despite her preparation, Vanessa still gasped at Dominic's injuries.

Without immediate treatment, amputation was likely.

His legs were mottled with bruises, some areas necrotic from neglect.

Frowning, Vanessa turned to Nathaniel. "Guard the door. No interruptions. And fetch me a basin."

Nathaniel obeyed, stationing himself outside.

Vanessa checked Dominic's pulse, then selected silver needles from her kit.

Precision guided her hands as she inserted them. "Pain?" she asked.

Dominic shook his head weakly, though sweat beaded his forehead. Infection had set in, likely causing fever.

Vanessa applied a cold compress to his brow.

As time passed, dark blood oozed from the knee needles.

"This pus must drain, or you'll lose the legs," she stated.

Dominic remained silent, eyes locked on Vanessa's face.

She noticed his unusual quiet—normally talkative, he hadn't spoken since her arrival.

With Dominic mute, Vanessa focused on her work.

After thirty minutes, most pus had drained. She bandaged his legs firmly. "The remainder will absorb. Bed rest is mandatory—no standing."

Suddenly, commotion erupted outside.

"Mrs. Price! You can't—" Nathaniel's voice cut off.

"Is Dominic here?" Miranda demanded, pushing forward.

Nathaniel blocked her. "You can't enter!"

Miranda's face darkened. "How dare you stop me?"

Her bodyguards overpowered Nathaniel, forcing the door open.
###Chapter 667

The moment Miranda Price crossed the threshold and saw the unfamiliar woman in Dominic Powell's bedroom, her lips curled into a knowing smirk.

Her informants had done their job well—they'd warned her a woman had slipped into Dominic's residence under cover of darkness. Now here was the proof, standing right before her.

Miranda's sharp eyes raked over Evelyn Carter, lingering on the unmistakable swell of her pregnant belly.

At nearly eight months along, Evelyn's condition was impossible to conceal, even beneath her oversized coat.

A man and woman alone together in the dead of night? Miranda's expression darkened like a gathering storm. "Dominic," she hissed, "who is this? Explain yourself."

Dominic moved instinctively, positioning himself between Evelyn and Miranda like a human shield.

Evelyn raised the acupuncture needles in her hand. "Mrs. Price, I'm Dr. Carter. Mr. Powell requested my expertise for his leg injury."

Miranda's laugh was razor-sharp. "A house call at midnight? How... unconventional."

When she noticed how Dominic's body tensed protectively near Evelyn, Miranda's suspicion ignited into fury. "You're engaged, Dominic! What's the meaning of this? And that child she's carrying—"

"Mine," Dominic declared without hesitation.

Evelyn's jaw dropped. She shot Dominic a glare that could melt steel, but he deliberately avoided her gaze.

Miranda's finger jabbed toward Dominic's chest. "You dare humiliate our family like this? An affair while engaged? A bastard child—"

In a flash, Miranda lunged forward, grasping Dominic's arm with bruising force. "We're settling this with your father tonight!"

Dominic winced as she yanked—his freshly bandaged legs rendered him immobile.

Evelyn darted between them. "His injuries are severe! He can't be moved!"

Miranda turned her venom on Evelyn. "Think carrying his brat makes you special? You're nothing to the Powells!" She shoved Evelyn hard.

Pregnancy made Evelyn unsteady. She stumbled backward, arms flailing—until Dominic's iron grip caught her waist.

Dominic hauled himself upright, his eyes glacial. His hand snapped out, seizing Miranda's wrist with a sickening crack.

"Touch her again," he whispered, "and I'll break the other one."

Miranda gasped. Never had Dominic defied her like this—not even during his worst punishments.

"You'd attack your own mother?" she shrieked.

Dominic's smile was arctic. "Keep testing me."

Evelyn interjected quietly, "That wrist needs immediate attention, Mrs. Price. Delay could cause permanent damage."

Miranda's glare promised retribution, but pain won over pride. She retreated toward the door.

"This isn't over, Dominic!" she spat before vanishing into the hall.

Silence descended like a shroud.

Dominic lounged against the headboard, flashing Evelyn a roguish grin. "So? How dashing was your baby's future father just now?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Alexander is plenty handsome, thanks."

Dominic's smirk faltered.

As Evelyn packed her medical kit, her thoughts churned. The Powell family rumors were ugly—Dominic, the product of Reginald Powell's infidelity, tolerated but never accepted.

"Provoking Miranda like that..." Evelyn hesitated. "Won't it backfire?"

Dominic's grin returned. "Worried about me, sweetheart?"

When he reached for her face, Evelyn sidestepped smoothly. "Professional concern only. My husband's waiting outside."

She moved toward the door, tossing over her shoulder, "Take the anti-inflammatories I prescribed. I'll check your progress in three days."

Dominic's eyes narrowed at her retreating back.

He barely registered her mention of Alexander. Only one phrase echoed in his mind: I'll be back.

XXXXX

The Carter-Whitmore residence was eerily empty when Evelyn and Alexander returned.

Isabella Morgan's belongings had vanished—suitcase, clothes, everything.

Evelyn frowned. "Where would she go at this hour?"

In this city, Isabella's connections were few. The fallen Morgan family held no power anymore.

Only one possibility remained: Dominic, her fiancé.

Alexander shook his head. "She's hiding to avoid being deported." He pulled out his phone, instructing Simon Graves to track her.

Neither anticipated how quickly events would spiral out of control.
###Chapter 668

Claire smoothed the wrinkles from her blazer as she checked her reflection one last time. The mirror showed a woman ready to reclaim her place in the world after maternity leave.

Today marked her return to the workforce. Though her bank account didn't demand it, idleness had never suited Claire's temperament. She craved professional fulfillment - both for personal growth and to model ambition for her daughter.

The elevator doors opened onto the bustling headquarters of Vogue Elite magazine. Claire had come merely to submit her modeling portfolio, but fate had other plans.

"Miss Dawson?" A receptionist handed her an unexpected form. "We're conducting auditions for our spring editorial spread. Would you like to participate?"

Claire hesitated only momentarily. A year away from the industry felt like an eternity in fashion years. New faces emerged daily, each more youthful than the last. Still, opportunity rarely knocked twice.

She completed the paperwork with practiced efficiency. When the casting director returned with a shortlist, Claire's name appeared dead last - traditionally the least favorable position. Yet watching dozens of rejected applicants depart, she took grim satisfaction in having cleared the first hurdle.

Two excruciating hours later, hunger gnawed at her concentration. "Claire Dawson?" The assistant finally called.

She entered the judging chamber with measured confidence. Five evaluators sat in scrutiny - three men and two women. The male judges barely concealed their disinterest, exchanging dismissive glances as they scribbled notes.

"Decent bone structure," remarked the senior female editor. "She photographs well. Far superior to the previous candidates."

"But she's had a child," countered a male stylist with palpable disdain. "The market wants fresh faces, not used goods."

Claire's nails bit into her palms. The insult burned, but professional decorum won over instinct. This industry operated on connections as much as talent - bridges couldn't be burned over petty insults.

As debate grew heated, all eyes turned to the silent figure at the table's center. "Mr. Harrison," an assistant prompted, "your decision?"

Max Harrison finally looked up from his documents. Recognition flickered across his features. "Claire. It's been years."

The atmosphere shifted palpably. The previously dismissive judges now fidgeted uncomfortably, reassessing their earlier remarks.

Max's assessment came cool and measured. "Her portfolio shows promise, but we have more suitable candidates, don't we?"

Claire's stomach dropped. She'd expected preferential treatment from a former classmate, not this clinical dismissal.

"Felicity Simons aligns perfectly with our brand image," a judge hastily agreed. "Established following, proven market appeal."

The verdict became inevitable. Claire maintained perfect poise as she collected her materials, but humiliation simmered beneath the surface. Had time changed Max so completely?

The parking garage offered cold sanctuary. Just as she reached her Mercedes, footsteps echoed behind her.

"Running off so soon?" Max appeared, hands in pockets, looking unfairly handsome in his tailored suit.

"Mr. Harrison." Claire emphasized the formal address. "Did I forget something?"

His lips quirked at her frosty tone. "That's no way to treat an old friend. Let me make it up to you - dinner's on me."

"You rejected me. Why would I want dinner?"

"Precisely why I owe you an apology." Without waiting for consent, he opened the passenger door. "My car's in the shop. Be a sport and give me a lift?"

Claire exhaled sharply through her nose. Some things never changed - Max's audacity least of all.
###Chapter 669

Claire had dined at this restaurant before.

It was an elite establishment, notorious for its exclusivity. Reservations had to be made at least seventy-two hours in advance.

Since she hadn’t booked ahead, walking in without notice was impossible.

Oddly enough, three days ago had been the night of their high school reunion.

A suspicion nagged at Claire—had Max planned this all along?

Seated across from him now, she studied him carefully.

The dim lighting during their interview had been different.

Now, face-to-face, she realized how much the boy she once knew had changed.

He was even more striking than she remembered, his height commanding the space between them.

Noticing her stare, Max set down his silverware. "Something on my face, or is the steak not to your taste?"

With a playful smirk, he slid a piece of his steak onto her plate. "Want to trade?"

Claire snapped back to reality and took a bite before steering the conversation toward the interview.

"So, you were the one who pushed my name forward?"

Something didn’t add up.

She had clearly marked mother on her résumé. If they had an issue with that, they should have rejected her application outright.

Instead, they had called her in—only to dismiss her for that very reason.

It felt like her application had been rejected, then mysteriously reinstated by Max.

He shrugged. "I did give you that opportunity."

"Then why let me interview just to turn me down for that?" Claire pressed. "Was this some kind of humiliation tactic? Do you think mothers can’t chase dreams?"

Max’s expression darkened. "That’s not what I meant at all. You’re misreading me."

"Then explain," she challenged, leaning in.

He exhaled. "This industry is brutal. The competition is fierce. Youth is currency, and you’ll face worse than this."

Claire couldn’t argue with that.

Soft piano music filled the upscale restaurant, wrapping them in an intimate ambiance.

Their booth by the window was cozy, the glass fogged from the chilly air outside.

Max’s gaze locked onto hers, intense and unreadable.

Claire wondered what his real motive was.

Years apart had turned them into strangers, despite their shared past.

This place wasn’t cheap. If Max just wanted to belittle her and flaunt his success, he wouldn’t have bothered with dinner. After tonight, they’d go their separate ways—likely forever.

He lifted his wine glass, clinking it gently against hers.

Then, from his pocket, he produced a business card and slid it across the table.

The title CEO of Starlight Entertainment gleamed under the soft light.

She knew the company—rising fast in the industry, responsible for launching multiple A-listers recently.

So that was why his family had moved to Cresthaven.

"If I remember right," he said, fingers tapping the table, "your dream was to dance professionally."

A simple gesture, but with his sharp features, it radiated effortless confidence.

Claire laughed softly, self-deprecating. "I injured my leg. I can still dance for fun, but a career? That ship sailed."

Dancing demanded perfection—relentless training, punishing routines. Her doctor’s prognosis had forced her into modeling instead.

Max, however, didn’t look surprised.

His knowing gaze suggested he’d expected this. "If you could go back, would you?"

"Without hesitation," Claire answered. "Dancing is my passion. Modeling was just… a detour."

His voice, deep and smooth, wrapped around her like warmth. "Then let me offer you a position at Starlight. Come work with me."

Claire froze.

Every word until now had led here.

Max wanted her in Cresthaven.

Starlight was a powerhouse, known for cultivating talent—whether established stars or fresh faces. Transitioning from performer to mentor would keep her in the dance world.

"Salary, meals, housing—all covered. Solid deal," he added, signaling for the check.

Outside, Claire was still processing.

Moving to Cresthaven? She’d never considered it.

Suddenly, a deliveryman rushed past, nearly colliding with her. Max grabbed her wrist, yanking her against his chest.

Claire stumbled, her cheek pressed to his shirt.

The scent of sandalwood enveloped her, his body heat sending a shiver down her spine.

For a heartbeat, they looked like lovers embracing.

Claire blinked, dazed.

"You okay?" Max murmured, fingers brushing her hair. "Scared?"

Before she could pull away, Lucas appeared, voice sharp with anger. "What’s going on here?"

They turned to see him striding over, eyes stormy.

He seized Claire’s arm, wrenching her back as he glared at Max. "Care to explain?"

Lucas must have been dining with clients—two middle-aged executives lingered behind him, shifting uncomfortably.

Max remained calm. "We were just having dinner."

Lucas scoffed. "Old classmates catching up? Just the two of you?"

Max’s smirk held a challenge. "We weren’t close then. Who knows about now?"

Tension crackled between them. Lucas’s instincts screamed that Max had ulterior motives.

Deliberately, Lucas leaned in. "Claire, your daughter’s starting to recognize people. This morning, she was looking everywhere for you."

The mention of Bella was a calculated strike. Everyone knew what it implied—a divorced mother wasn’t exactly prime dating material.

Lucas expected Max to falter.

Instead, Max met his gaze, cool and unshaken.

As he brushed past Lucas, he murmured just loud enough to hear:

"This time, I won’t let her go."
###Chapter 670

The sun cast golden rays through the café windows as Evelyn and Claire settled into their usual corner booth. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, mingling with the soft hum of conversation around them.

Claire stirred her latte absentmindedly before dropping the bombshell. "Max wants me to move to Havenbrook."

Evelyn's cup froze halfway to her lips. "Havenbrook? That's practically another world from Cresthaven!"

It was true. The distance wasn't just geographical—it was a complete reset.

Claire shrugged. "Nothing's final yet."

But Evelyn couldn't shake the suspicion creeping into her thoughts. Cresthaven was Lucas Bennett's domain. No matter how much Claire tried to distance herself, his shadow lingered.

Havenbrook, though? That was uncharted territory. A place where Max Harrison could easily become her anchor.

"Claire," Evelyn leaned forward, eyes gleaming with mischief. "I think Max has feelings for you."

Claire choked on her coffee, coughing violently as she grabbed a napkin. "You're joking, right? The CEO of Starlight Entertainment? Interested in a divorced single mom? That's straight out of a cheesy romance novel!"

Evelyn smirked. "Don't sell yourself short. You're stunning, and you two have history. Maybe he's been waiting for his chance."

Claire rolled her eyes. "Pregnancy hormones must be frying your brain."

Evelyn only laughed. "Just wait. His true colors will show soon enough."

Changing the subject, Claire frowned. "Have you heard from Isabella lately?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It's weird. How does someone just vanish?"

Two weeks of silence. No drama, no schemes. Peaceful, but unsettling.

Evelyn rubbed her rounded belly. "This little one's been quiet lately. Less kicking."

Claire's expression darkened. "Less movement? Have you seen a doctor?"

"It's probably nothing."

"Evelyn!" Claire snatched her keys. "We're going to the hospital. Now."

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled the air as they arrived. After a thorough check-up, the doctor confirmed the baby was simply lazy—healthy, but small.

Relieved, Claire insisted on handling the paperwork while Evelyn waited.

But when Claire returned, the bench was empty.

Her heart lurched. Evelyn wouldn't just leave.

Frantically dialing, she got only a robotic voice: "The number you have reached is currently unavailable—"

Panic set in.

Evelyn hadn't meant to wander. But then she saw her.

Isabella Morgan, slipping out of the maternity ward.

At first, Evelyn doubted her eyes. The sunglasses, the scarf—but that walk was unmistakable.

Isabella hesitated, then ripped a paper to shreds before tossing it away. Resolute, she turned back toward the doctor's office.

Pregnant? The thought was surreal.

Isabella's hands trembled as she sat across from the doctor. "I don't want it. Schedule the procedure."

The doctor nodded. "It's early. Medication will suffice."

A prescription was printed. Isabella clutched it like a lifeline—or a death sentence.

She didn't see Evelyn watching.

In a secluded corner, Isabella unscrewed a water bottle, shaking pills into her palm.

"Isabella."

The voice made her jump. Pills scattered across the floor.

Evelyn stood there, eyes wide with disbelief. "What are you doing?"
###Chapter 671

Evelyn's face drained of color, her first impulse to flee.

But Claire seized her wrist with surprising strength. "Evelyn, you owe me an explanation. What were those pills? Where have you been hiding? Alexander and I have turned the city upside down looking for you."

Evelyn scoffed. "Alexander only cares because he feels guilty about my brother. That's predictable. But you? Why bother?"

"Because you're a reckless girl alone in the world," Claire shot back, her voice softening. "I'm afraid you're making terrible choices."

Her concern was palpable. Claire couldn't help but pity Evelyn, who had lost everything too young. No wonder she clung to dangerous illusions.

"Alexander wants to send you overseas. Even if you refuse, disappearing like this is unacceptable!"

Evelyn stiffened at the unexpected warmth in Claire's tone. It unsettled her.

She turned, eyes sharp with defiance. "Playing the saint now? Do you honestly think I'll thank you?"

Her lips curled into a bitter smile. "You asked what I took? It was an abortion pill. Want to know whose child it was? Alexander's."

Claire's breath hitched. "That's impossible."

"You think I ran away? Alexander knows exactly where I've been. This villa? His idea. He's been hiding me here, visiting whenever he pleases."

Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "We've been intimate. Because you—pregnant, fragile—couldn't satisfy him anymore."

A sharp crack echoed as Claire's palm struck Evelyn's cheek.

"Liar! You're drowning in delusions!"

Evelyn touched her stinging face, fury boiling in her veins. "You dare hit me?"

She raised her hand but hesitated. Leaving a mark would only complicate things.

Claire's chest heaved. "You're lashing out because you're ashamed!"

Evelyn laughed coldly. "No, Claire. You're the one who's scared. Ask the doctor—I am carrying Alexander's child. Who else would I be with these past weeks?"

With that, she shoved past Claire and vanished down the hall.

Claire stood frozen, her mind reeling.

"Alexander... hiding her? No. It can't be true."

Yet doubt slithered in, tightening her chest. Stress coiled around her swollen belly, forcing her to lean against the wall, gasping.

"I trust him. I have to."

But the seed was planted.

Meanwhile, Claire's best friend, Victoria, tore through the hospital corridors, panic clawing at her throat.

"Evelyn! Where are you?" Tears streaked her face as she checked every floor, even taking the stairs two at a time.

Rounding a corner, she collided with a solid chest.

"Victoria?" Max Harrison steadied her, his brow furrowed at her distress. "What's wrong?"

"I—I lost Evelyn. She's pregnant, and her phone's dead!" Her words tumbled out in a frantic rush.

Max didn't hesitate. "I'll help. We'll split up—cover more ground."

Back in obstetrics, Claire confronted the doctor, her voice barely steady.

"My cousin, Isabella Morgan. She mentioned taking abortion pills here. Is she... alright?"

The doctor typed briskly. "Early-term pregnancy. Medication was viable. No surgery needed."

Claire's knees buckled.

She wasn't lying.

"Ma'am? You're pale—"

"I'm fine," Claire lied, stumbling out before collapsing into a chair.

Just as Max spotted her.

"Found her!" he called to Victoria, who came sprinting.

Victoria crushed Claire in a tearful hug. "You terrified me! Why didn't you answer?"

Claire numbly checked her dead phone. "Sorry. I just... needed air."

Victoria exhaled, then noticed Max lingering.

"Thank you," she said, wiping her eyes. "I owe you dinner."

Max plucked the keys from her shaky hands. "Tonight. Let's drop Claire home first."

As sunlight gilded his hair, he opened the car door with a smirk.

"Princess, your chariot awaits."

Victoria blinked. "Wait—what?"
###Chapter 672

The car hummed softly as Alexander took the wheel, his chivalrous gesture allowing the two women to settle comfortably in the backseat.

Evelyn couldn't shake the growing suspicion that something electric was developing between Claire and Alexander.

Discreetly nudging Claire with her elbow, Evelyn typed out a quick message: [Did you hear how he called you princess? That man is definitely interested.]

Claire's gaze drifted forward, studying Alexander's profile.

His dark hair was perfectly styled, not a strand out of place. From her vantage point, she could admire the strong contours of his nose and the sharp angle of his jawline.

His large hands gripped the steering wheel with confident ease, his manicured nails gleaming under the afternoon light. The crisp white shirt he wore showed no signs of wrinkles, hugging his broad shoulders perfectly.

"He must be borderline obsessive about cleanliness," Claire mused silently.

Breaking the comfortable silence, Claire asked, "What brought you to the hospital today? Everything alright?"

Alexander kept his eyes on the road as he answered casually, "My assistant wasn't adjusting well to the climate change. Just getting some fluids administered."

Claire's eyebrows shot up. "Wait, you just left him there alone? Isn't that a bit... cold?"

A deep chuckle rumbled from Alexander's chest. "We're all adults here. He doesn't need me holding his hand during an IV drip. Though if it were an old classmate..." His voice trailed off meaningfully.

Evelyn suppressed a knowing smile, perfectly aware of who he meant.

The old classmate could only mean Claire. Certainly not Evelyn herself - a happily married, pregnant woman.

She settled deeper into the leather seat, suddenly feeling like an unnecessary third wheel in this unfolding romance.

Fortunately, Alexander navigated through the city streets with expert precision, delivering Evelyn home just before evening traffic peaked.

As she stepped out of the vehicle, Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief.

"Home sweet home. You two go enjoy your evening."

Claire leaned forward with concern. "Are you sure you don't want to join us for dinner? Nathan's been working late so often lately..."

Evelyn waved her off with a smile. "The staff has dinner prepared already. Go on, have fun." She closed the door firmly, thinking, "This is clearly their moment - I shouldn't intrude."

Claire watched until Evelyn disappeared inside the grand estate before turning her attention back to Alexander.

Instead of starting the engine, Alexander turned fully toward her, his expression unexpectedly serious.

The confined space of the car suddenly felt intimate, charged with unspoken tension.

Claire found herself captivated by Alexander's unusual eyes - deep pools of intensity with a slight upward tilt at the corners that gave him a perpetually mischievous air.

Before she realized it, nearly a full minute had passed with her staring unabashedly.

"Oh God, that must seem so rude," Claire thought with sudden panic.

Flustered, she quickly looked away. "Why aren't we moving?"

"We will," Alexander said smoothly, "but first I need you to come sit up front with me."

Claire blinked in surprise. "Excuse me?"

"Front seat. I'd prefer the company," he clarified with a small smile.

Shaking off her momentary confusion, Claire offered an embarrassed grin.

With just the two of them now, remaining in the backseat felt strangely impersonal.

After all, Alexander Whitmore was a titan of industry - respected by celebrities and executives alike. How often did someone like him play chauffeur?

She quickly moved to the front passenger seat. "So... where should we eat?"

"You're the local expert - your choice," Alexander deferred gracefully.

Claire pulled up her navigation app, considering for a moment. "How about that new steakhouse by the pier?"

Just as they merged onto the main road, Alexander's phone buzzed insistently.

Since they were in Claire's car, his phone wasn't connected to the Bluetooth system.

"Could you grab that for me?" Alexander asked, glancing briefly away from the road.

Claire found herself momentarily lost in the depth of his gaze, nearly forgetting the task at hand.

The phone was nestled in Alexander's pants pocket, and Claire hesitated before carefully retrieving it, keeping her eyes averted from his muscular thigh.

Noticing her discomfort, Alexander pretended not to notice. "Just put it on speaker."

Claire hesitated. "But if it's business..."

"Doesn't matter," he assured her.

The reason for his nonchalance became immediately clear when he launched into a rapid conversation in what sounded like Swiss German - completely incomprehensible to Claire.

"Well, I guess it really doesn't matter then," she murmured to herself.

Alexander's rich baritone filled the car, the foreign syllables rolling off his tongue with effortless grace. Claire found the sound oddly soothing, like a lullaby.

Her thoughts drifted. "What would daily life be like in Cresthaven?"

When the call ended, Alexander turned to find Claire had dozed off, her head resting gently against the window.

He adjusted the climate controls, letting warm air circulate through the cabin as he drove more carefully.

His gaze softened as it lingered on her peaceful expression.

"Still the same heavy sleeper," he thought with quiet affection.

Claire awoke to find the world outside had darkened into night.

"How long was I out? Why didn't you wake me?" she exclaimed, disoriented as she realized they were parked in the restaurant's underground garage.

"Couldn't bring myself to disturb you," Alexander admitted with a smile. "Besides, the kitchen stays open late."

Looking down, Claire noticed Alexander's tailored coat draped over her like a blanket.

His distinctive cologne - a sophisticated blend of sandalwood and something uniquely him - enveloped her senses.

Turning, she found Alexander watching her with an intensity that made her pulse quicken.

Heat flooded Claire's cheeks as she realized how she must have looked while sleeping.

Then her gaze dropped to the coat in horror.

There, on the expensive fabric, was an undeniable damp patch from where she'd clearly drooled.

"Oh my God," Claire thought in mortification.

Instinctively wiping her mouth, she stammered, "I'm so sorry! I'll have it professionally cleaned and returned immediately."

Alexander's lips quirked in amusement. "After all these years, some things never change."

"Never change?"

Memories came flooding back - of late-night study sessions in university when she'd frequently doze off while copying Alexander's notes.

More than once, she'd woken to find her drool staining his meticulously organized textbooks.

Back then, he'd been visibly annoyed by her messiness.

The recollection made her cheeks burn hotter.

Alexander continued, "I just received word I'll need to cut this trip short. Flying back to Cresthaven first thing tomorrow - might not get the coat back in time."

Claire's heart sank. "He's leaving already?"

After a beat of silence, she offered, "That's fine. Just send me your address and I'll have it couriered to you."

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel tightened almost imperceptibly.

"Courier it?" His voice dropped, tinged with something like disappointment. "I suppose my offer wasn't compelling enough for you to accept."

Claire blinked before realizing he meant his invitation to work in Cresthaven.

"Oh! No, that's not it," she rushed to explain. "I just haven't made a final decision yet."

The thought of leaving her comfort zone was terrifying - but could she really pass up this opportunity?

She knew with sudden certainty that she'd regret it forever if she let this chance slip away.

Alexander's gaze intensified as he studied her. "Fair enough. Good things are worth waiting for. After all..." His voice dropped to a murmur. "I can be patient."
###Chapter 673

Evelyn returned home to a peaceful evening. She savored a light dinner before taking her customary walk around the neighborhood with Susan, her ever-attentive maid.

The obstetrician had emphasized the importance of gentle movement during these final weeks. "Regular activity will ease the delivery process," he'd advised.

Anticipating Alexander's return, Evelyn meandered back toward the house. To her surprise, Simon Graves sat waiting in the parlor when she arrived. She nibbled on sliced mango while awaiting her husband.

"Mr. Whitmore was called away unexpectedly on urgent business. I'm here to collect some essentials for his trip," Simon explained, adjusting his tie.

"Business trip?" Evelyn's fork paused mid-air. Alexander hadn't mentioned any travel plans that morning.

Simon recognized her confusion. "Last-minute crisis with the Singapore merger. Shouldn't take more than seventy-two hours to resolve." Evelyn nodded, rising to fetch a travel case.

Simon blanched. "Mrs. Whitmore! Please remain seated - I'll handle everything." His hands fluttered nervously toward her swollen abdomen.

As Simon disappeared upstairs, Evelyn grabbed her phone. Alexander answered on the second ring, the roar of a speeding car evident behind him. "Darling? Simon says you're leaving town?"

"Just a quick trip, Evelyn. Once I clear this hurdle, I'll be homebound until our little one arrives." Alexander had been working tirelessly to delegate responsibilities before her due date.

"I saw Isabella at the hospital today." Evelyn's fingers traced the brocade pattern on the sofa. She'd intended to share this news face-to-face, but circumstances demanded otherwise.

Logically, Evelyn trusted her husband implicitly. Eight years of marriage had proven his devotion. Yet emotionally, Isabella's cryptic smirk haunted her. Without resolution, she'd spend days agonizing.

"Maternity ward? You must be mistaken." Alexander's voice sharpened.

"We spoke directly. She's expecting." The line crackled with silence.

Then, decisively: "Turn the car around. Trip's postponed."

Evelyn blinked. "But Horizon's entire Asian division is waiting—"

"We'll discuss everything when I arrive." The call ended abruptly.

Simon reappeared, wheeling a leather suitcase. "All packed, Mrs. Whitmore. I'll—"

"Plans have changed. Alexander's returning."

Simon's jaw slackened. "The Singapore deal involves three billion! He rescheduled the Tokyo summit specifically for this!"

Evelyn studied her wedding band. "Apparently something more pressing emerged."

"More pressing than..." Simon's protest died as tires screeched outside.

Alexander burst through the door, still in his Oxfords. "Evelyn! Who fathered Isabella's child?" His chest heaved from the sprint indoors.

"I imagine only Isabella knows." Evelyn's response came measured. His frantic return confirmed the baby wasn't his - yet his agitation troubled her more.

Simon gaped. "Sir, the delegation—"

"Divert all security teams to locate Isabella!" Alexander barked. "Pull hospital surveillance footage. I want her found within forty-eight hours!"

His mind raced. "Pregnant? She's not even engaged! Was she assaulted while missing?" Guilt twisted his gut. He'd promised Andrew he'd protect his sister.

Walter hesitated. "Sir, the merger—"

Alexander finally noticed his shoes. He kicked them off violently. "Find her first!" His expression darkened. "If someone harmed her..."

He pivoted to Simon. "Have Reynolds handle Singapore. I'll join after resolving this."

Evelyn observed her husband's commanding presence. That he'd abandon a billion-dollar deal for Isabella stung more than any paternity claim. Had Isabella truly planted roots in his heart?

That night, Evelyn twisted in bed, tormented by recurring visions. In each nightmare, Isabella smirked triumphantly, boasting about the blossoming seed she'd planted in Alexander's soul.
###Chapter 674

The moment Isabella stepped out of the hospital, she didn’t realize she had eyes on her.

She tugged the brim of her hat lower, shielding her face, and hurried toward the nearest bus stop. The first bus that arrived was her escape.

A few yards away, a group of rough-looking men loitered, smoke curling from their cigarettes.

"You sure it's her?" the leader asked, his arms a canvas of tangled tattoos that made it impossible to decipher their meaning.

Eric Simmons, a burly man with a protruding gut, chimed in, "Our guy's been tracking her for weeks."

"Andrew's been lurking around her, showing up when she least expects it. Rumor has it he even took out some guy named Vincent White recently—all for her sake."

Daniel Foster, the leader, narrowed his eyes. "What's her deal? Any background?"

"Fallen heiress. Whole family's gone. She's alone now," Eric replied, scratching his stomach with a lazy grin.

He added, "Gotta admit, she's easy on the eyes. Maybe Andrew's got a soft spot for her. You know how it goes—beauty and danger don’t mix well."

Daniel scoffed, spitting on the pavement. "Andrew? A hero? Don’t make me laugh."

Eric nodded. "Exactly. He’s nothing compared to you, Daniel."

A smirk tugged at Daniel’s lips.

Eric rubbed his chin. "Hard to say. Andrew’s not the type to risk anything for anyone. Word is, he’s ice-cold. Using a woman to control him? Doubt it."

"Damn it!" Daniel snapped, frustration twisting his features. "I can’t stand that bastard! Steals from me, takes my men out—I’ll make him pay!"

Eric held up a hand. "Easy, Daniel. We’ve tangled with Andrew before. We’ll handle this."

Daniel frowned, suspicion gnawing at him.

A woman who could rattle Andrew? That was unusual.

Andrew wasn’t one to let emotions cloud his judgment. Yet he’d been hovering around her, pulling strings behind the scenes.

Did he actually care about her?

If so, why hadn’t he claimed her already?

Unless…

A realization struck Daniel.

"Dig deeper into her past! Find out if she’s got any siblings or connections!"

"On it!" Eric nodded eagerly.

After switching buses multiple times, Isabella finally reached the villa.

She could’ve taken a cab, but she wasn’t taking chances. If Alexander’s men were tracking her, she needed to stay off the radar.

Inside, a maid greeted her.

"Ms. Morgan, you’re back."

"Yeah," Isabella murmured.

She grabbed a glass of water and bolted to her room, shutting the door behind her.

Without hesitation, she swallowed the pills the doctor had prescribed.

"Isabella, what are you taking?"

The sudden voice made her nearly drop the glass.

She turned sharply toward the bed.

Sebastian Powell sat there, watching her.

Isabella had been so focused on the medication—on ending what was growing inside her—that she hadn’t even noticed him.

Setting the glass down, she forced calm into her voice. "Just something for a cold."

To sell it, she coughed lightly.

Sebastian was on his feet instantly.

He pressed a hand to her forehead. "With this weather, you shouldn’t take risks."

His fingers brushed her skin, searching for fever.

Isabella turned away. "I’m fine. Just a sore throat."

"Really?" Sebastian picked up the remaining pills, examining them. "No label. What kind of medicine is this?"

"Just something from the pharmacy. The clerk said it works fast."

Sebastian’s gaze sharpened, but he let it go.

Instead, he pulled her into his arms, his breath warm against her lips. "Did you miss me?"

He’d been tied up with business.

Since Isabella moved into the villa, he hadn’t had time to visit.

"I’m free now," he murmured. "I’ll stay with you for the next few days. How does that sound?"

His hand slid down her back, igniting a trail of heat. His breath teased her cheek, his desire unmistakable.

He removed his glasses, his intent clear.

He wanted her. Now.

Isabella’s instincts screamed to push him away, but before she could, his lips captured hers.

What should have felt intimate only made her skin crawl.

She gripped his wrists, stopping his wandering hands. "Sebastian, I’m not feeling well. Can we stop?"

A sharp pain twisted in her abdomen.

The medication was working too fast.

If this continued, she’d give herself away. The doctor had warned—no intimacy for a month.

But Sebastian wasn’t deterred.

"Isabella, I’ve waited long enough. You’re not backing out now."

Desperate, she blurted, "I saw Emilia earlier. What if Alexander’s men track me here? Do you want us exposed?"

Sebastian froze. "What did you say?"

"This villa is under your name. If they find it, they’ll connect us. I need to leave. Now."

Isabella was engaged to Dominic, yet here she was, tangled with Sebastian. If this got out, it would ruin him.

Dominic would be furious. The Powell family would never forgive it.

Seizing Sebastian’s hesitation, she wrenched free. "For both our sakes, I have to go."

If Sebastian stayed, she’d lose her mind.

Just being near him made her skin crawl.

Distance was the only solution.

Her words finally sank in.

Sebastian frowned. "Leave? Where will you go? A hotel? I’ll drive you—"

"No! There are cameras everywhere. If they catch us together, you’re as good as ruined."

All she wanted was to shake him off.

Her body was betraying her.

The medication was too strong. If she didn’t leave now, she’d slip up.

And that wasn’t an option.
###Chapter 675

The suitcase wheels clicked against the hardwood floor as Isabella Morgan dragged it toward the bedroom door.

Sebastian Powell's hand shot out, gripping her wrist. "Let me help you with that." His voice carried an edge of desperation she hadn't heard before.

She shook him off. "Everything's packed." Her tone was ice.

His gaze dropped to the untouched closet. She hadn't even bothered to unpack during her stay at the penthouse.

A muscle twitched in his jaw. "Were you planning to disappear without a word?"

The accusation hung between them.

Then crimson bloomed across his tailored slacks.

Sebastian recoiled. "Isabella—"

The pain hit like a sledgehammer. Her knees buckled.

He caught her as she swayed, his fingers coming away wet. "Christ, you're bleeding!"

This wasn't normal. The scarlet stain spreading across her skirt was too bright, too much.

"Hospital. Now." He swept her into his arms.

Isabella twisted violently. "Put me down!"

She wrenched free and slammed the bedroom door in his face, turning the lock with trembling fingers.

Blood trickled down her thighs as she slid to the floor.

"Sebastian," she gasped through the pain, "just go."

One night. That's all she needed to endure. By dawn, this would be over.

His fists pounded against the door. "You're hemorrhaging!"

"Period." She bit her lip until copper filled her mouth. "Heavy flow."

"Bullshit. Open this door!"

"Not your problem anymore." She curled into herself, riding the waves of agony.

Silence. Then retreating footsteps.

The grandfather clock struck three when the front door exploded inward.

Isabella barely had time to register the splintering wood before rough hands yanked her upright.

"Daniel Foster sends his regards," sneered the man with prison tattoos snaking up his neck.

Her pulse skyrocketed. These weren't Alexander Whitmore's men.

Rope bit into her wrists as they trussed her like game. "What does some two-bit gangster want with me?"

The backhand sent her sprawling.

"Your precious brother Andrew crossed the wrong people." The leader crouched, grabbing a fistful of her hair. "Three of my boys are in body bags thanks to him."

Isabella's laugh was bloody. "Then go after Evelyn Carter! She's Alexander's wife—"

"Alexander?" The thug exchanged glances with his crew. "Well, well. Seems we hit the jackpot twice."

A syringe flashed. Darkness swallowed her whole.

Eric Simmons licked his lips. "Boss, she's prime merchandise. We could get triple—"

Daniel's punch sent him reeling. "That bitch's brother cost me $20 million. Tonight, Andrew Morgan watches his sister die."

The text blazed across Daniel's burner phone: Got your leverage. Come alone or she's shark food.

Somewhere in the city, a phone vibrated against a mahogany desk. Andrew Morgan's blood ran cold.
###Chapter 676
Evelyn was carefully applying rosin to her cello bow, the gentle strains of Mozart's piano sonata filling the room for her unborn child's prenatal stimulation.

Natalie had sent a package from her recent performance tour in Lutalia. The moment Evelyn unwrapped the gift box, her face lit up at the sight of authentic Lutalian dark chocolate and a bottle of aged red wine.

She popped a square of chocolate into her mouth, savoring the rich cocoa flavors. Almost immediately, the baby responded with enthusiastic kicks, as if dancing to the sweet treat's rhythm.

Evelyn chuckled, running a hand over her rounded belly. "Looks like someone has their mother's sweet tooth," she murmured.

The thoughtful gift made Evelyn consider reciprocating. Money wasn't an issue anymore - thanks to Natalie's connections, her compositions were generating steady royalty checks. Without Natalie's mentorship, her musical career might have taken years longer to blossom.

She initially wanted Alexander's input on gift ideas for women Natalie's age. But when she checked his study, the room stood empty.

"Must be at one of his meetings," Evelyn mused, slipping into her wool coat.

At the foyer, Susan hurried over as Evelyn selected a pair of comfortable flats. "Mrs. Whitmore, should I accompany you? At this stage of pregnancy..."

Evelyn waved off the concern with a warm smile. "I'm just popping over to Willow Mall. It's barely fifteen minutes away."

Settling into the car, Evelyn scrolled through her contacts. Claire had been her first choice, but recent job rejections had left her friend stressed.

"Motherhood shouldn't disqualify anyone," Claire had fumed during their last coffee date. "I could bench press half those interviewers! This industry's ageism is disgusting."

Evelyn understood Claire's frustration. The modeling world prized youth above all else. "Their loss," she'd reassured her friend. "When the right opportunity comes..."

"I could always take that offer from Max in Havenbrook," Claire had mused, then sighed. "But Sophia's so little still..."

The dilemma was real - career versus motherhood. Evelyn decided against bothering Claire today.

Her thumb hovered over another contact - Victoria Clarke. They hadn't properly spoken since the kidnapping incident that ended Victoria's engagement. Society's cruel whispers about "soiled goods" had driven most of Victoria's friends away.

The call connected after three rings. "Evelyn? Now's not really..." Victoria's voice dropped to a whisper.

"I'm working the night shift at QuickStop. Can we reschedule?"

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. The Clarke heiress working as a convenience store clerk? Even after the ransom payment, the family fortune couldn't have dwindled that drastically.

Before Evelyn could inquire further, Victoria abruptly ended the call. "Customer just walked in. Later!"

At the QuickStop counter, Victoria clenched her phone, watching the familiar figure emerge from the alley's shadows.

Andrew Morgan was early tonight.

For two weeks, Victoria had taken this graveyard shift specifically to monitor his movements. That first night when their eyes met across the counter, she'd nearly fainted from terror.

The police claimed Andrew's kidnapping ring was too entrenched for immediate action. Any misstep could trigger retaliation against her family. So Victoria devised her own plan - get close, gather evidence, then strike.

Andrew's piercing gaze swept over her as he entered. Victoria forced her hands steady, reaching for his usual cigarette brand before he even tapped the glass display.

"Your usual, Mr. Morgan?" she asked brightly, noting how his pale fingers hesitated momentarily at her use of his name.

He slid a crisp hundred across the counter. Silence was his trademark.

Victoria counted his change with deliberate slowness. "You know," she ventured casually, "my grandfather died from lung cancer. Smoked two packs daily."

Andrew's icy stare could have frozen lava.

Victoria met his gaze unflinchingly, adding the change to his outstretched palm. "Just saying... your family would want you around longer."

For the first time in fourteen days, the corner of Andrew's mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. More like a predator considering new prey.

Victoria's pulse hammered as he pocketed the cigarettes without a word. The bell jingled as he exited, leaving her alone with the security camera's blinking red light.

She exhaled shakily. Phase one complete. Now to see if her bait would be taken.
###Chapter 677

Andrew's icy gaze swept over Victoria's face. With a curt nod, he pocketed the change expressionlessly before pushing open the convenience store door.

The crisp evening air hit him as he stepped outside. He hadn't walked ten paces when his phone buzzed violently in his pocket.

Fishing out a cigarette, he clamped it between his lips while retrieving the ringing device with his other hand.

Unknown caller.

He swiped to decline without hesitation.

On the other end, Daniel Foster cursed viciously. "Damn bastard! Ignoring my calls now?" His boot connected brutally with the woman kneeling before him. "Doesn't give a shit about his sister anymore?"

Isabella Morgan whimpered in agony. Fresh from a traumatic miscarriage, the kick to her abdomen nearly made her black out. Tears streaked her pale face as she pleaded hoarsely, "Please... just let me go."

Terror gripped her heart. In her six months back in the country, she'd only crossed paths with Evelyn Carter. But surely even Evelyn wouldn't orchestrate something this cruel.

"Let you go?" Daniel sneered, grabbing her chin roughly. "Do I look like the merciful type to you?"

"Wh-what do you want then?" Isabella's voice shook. "Money? Alexander Whitmore's loaded! Just let me call him—"

"You think we want Whitmore's dirty money?" Daniel spat, shoving her away. He jerked his head at Eric Simmons. "Watch her."

Bound tightly for twenty-four hours, Isabella's limbs had gone numb. Escape was impossible—blindfolded during transport, surrounded by armed men. But if not money... what?

The unknown terrified her more than any physical pain.

Eric crouched before her, his gap-toothed grin unsettling. "Hungry?" He unscrewed a water bottle tantalizingly.

Isabella lunged forward instinctively—only for him to pour it onto the concrete. Her stomach growled pathetically.

"Bastard," she whispered.

Eric chuckled darkly. "Patience, princess. Everything'll be clear soon." He took an exaggerated sip from another bottle. "If only dear Andrew would answer his damn phone..."

Isabella froze. "Andrew? That's impossible—"

"Alive and kicking," Eric confirmed, enjoying her shock. "Our boss's personal nightmare. Always interfering." He traced her tear-streaked cheek. "What's this? Didn't know your dead brother's been watching over you all these years?"

Her mind reeled. If Andrew was alive... why had he abandoned her? And what had he done to provoke these monsters?

The questions burned worse than her empty stomach.
###Chapter 678

"Sir, we've located Ms. Morgan's position."

"Where?" Alexander Whitmore's voice cut through the tense silence of the car.

Simon Graves adjusted his glasses. "After departing the medical center yesterday, she transferred between multiple transit routes before arriving at a private estate."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Take me there immediately."

The black sedan pulled up to the gated property thirty minutes later, just as Sebastian Powell came storming down the front steps.

With his back turned, Sebastian was berating a group of security personnel. "Incompetent fools! How could you lose one woman under your watch? If anything happens to Isabella, consider your careers finished!"

"But sir, they had tactical gear and outmaneuvered us. We couldn't—"

The guards remained bound with professional-grade restraints, clear evidence of the assailants' expertise. The ropes still hadn't been cut away.

Alexander observed the scene through the tinted window. A full twenty-four hours had passed since the incident, and Sebastian had only just arrived to discover his security team incapacitated.

"These weren't ordinary criminals," one guard insisted. "Their training was military-grade. Shouldn't we contact law enforcement?"

Sebastian's laugh was bitter. "The police? What could they possibly do? Have you forgotten the Powell family's origins?" His voice dropped dangerously. "Twenty years ago, no street thug would dare cross us. Every underworld operation answered to my father."

Times had changed. Since the Powells transitioned to legitimate business, their shadow connections had weakened considerably.

Alexander lowered his window, absorbing every word.

Isabella was gone. Taken.

Sebastian turned at the sound, his confident mask slipping when he recognized Alexander's profile.

Clearly, he hadn't anticipated Alexander tracking him down so swiftly. Forcing composure, Sebastian approached with measured steps.

Despite his family's influence and status in Cresthaven, Sebastian knew he stood no match for the man before him.

"Mr. Whitmore," he began smoothly, "what an unexpected—"

Alexander cut him off, his voice glacial. "Was the child Isabella carried yours?"

Sebastian's breath hitched.

Isabella was pregnant?

This was news to him.

But if Alexander was making the accusation, it must be true.

Memories of yesterday flooded back—Isabella's erratic behavior, the bloodstain on his trousers. The pieces clicked together with sickening clarity.

'She claimed it was cold medicine... Was it actually—'

The realization nearly knocked him backward.

Somehow, Sebastian kept his expression neutral. Admitting anything would be catastrophic—not just because of Isabella's engagement to his brother, but the scandal itself would ruin him.

"You misunderstand, Mr. Whitmore," Sebastian said with practiced ease. "Ms. Morgan and I have a purely platonic relationship. I offered her temporary lodging as a courtesy to my future sister-in-law. That's all."

Feigning surprise, he added, "She's expecting? My brother should have mentioned... Though given their engagement, I'll speak to Father about accelerating the wedding plans."

Every word was calculated, delivered with convincing sincerity.

Alexander had spent a decade mastering interrogation techniques at the academy. He could spot deception in a heartbeat.

Stepping from the vehicle, Alexander drove his fist into Sebastian's abdomen without warning.

The impact sent Sebastian reeling. He collapsed to one knee, bile rising in his throat.

Alexander loomed over him, voice deadly quiet. "One more time, Sebastian. Is that your child?"

Sebastian tasted copper. He'd heard rumors of Alexander's combat skills but never experienced them firsthand.

As Isabella's legal guardian, Alexander's protective fury made brutal sense.

Gritting his teeth, Sebastian shook his head. "Not mine."

He couldn't admit it. Wouldn't.

Alexander didn't strike again. Instead, he studied Sebastian with unnerving intensity.

Sebastian met his gaze unflinchingly. "Ms. Morgan is engaged to my brother. How could the child possibly be mine?"

Their stare lasted several heartbeats before Alexander turned away.

Taking this as a small victory, Sebastian signaled an associate, who produced security footage.

"These men invaded my property and took her," Sebastian said, pointing to the screen.

Alexander's eyes locked onto the distinctive tattoo visible on the lead abductor's forearm. His expression darkened.

Years at the border had taught him to recognize that insignia.

How had Isabella become entangled with them?

Alexander returned to his car without another word, making a call as the engine roared to life.

Sebastian watched him leave, unease coiling in his gut. This wasn't over.

That tattoo... It tugged at some half-remembered knowledge from his family's darker days. He needed answers.

Rushing back to Powell Manor, Sebastian cornered the elderly butler. "Hugh, identify this symbol. What organization uses this mark?"

Hugh Cyrus, now in his sixties, had accompanied Sebastian's father through the family's most dangerous years. Adjusting his spectacles, he studied the image.

His aged eyes sharpened with recognition. "Southwest syndicate," he murmured. "Specialists in high-profile abductions. Why do you ask?"
###Chapter 679

Sebastian Powell's confusion deepened.

If they were involved in that kind of operation, why abduct Isabella?
What possible connection could she have to their dealings?

Then, realization struck him like lightning. His expression darkened.
Isabella might not be linked to their business—but someone else was.
That man.

She must have been taken because of him.
Sebastian bolted from the scene without another word.

Hugh frowned as he watched Sebastian disappear into the crowd.
Nearby, Dominic Powell narrowed his eyes in suspicion.

"What's Sebastian up to? Why the sudden secrecy?"
Nathaniel Powell spoke up, "Sir, are you sure your leg has fully recovered? Ms. Carter advised against excessive walking. You should still be resting."

For days now, Evelyn Carter had been performing acupuncture on Dominic's legs, drawing out the stagnant blood.
The improvement was undeniable—he could now walk short distances without assistance.

"I've been trapped indoors for weeks. Take me out for some air."

With no one available to accompany her, Evelyn found herself shopping alone at Willow Mall.
She started in the men's section, selecting two silk ties that would complement Alexander Whitmore's suits before turning her attention to Natalie Riley's gift.

After browsing multiple stores without success, she absentmindedly wandered into a baby boutique.

Her due date was barely a month away, and lately, she couldn't resist the tiny, adorable items.
Everything was miniature and impossibly sweet. Since she didn't know the baby's gender, she stuck to soft neutral tones.

A sales associate immediately approached. "How may I assist you today, madam?"

Evelyn's understated elegance—minimal jewelry but impeccable tailoring—spoke volumes. The uniformed chauffeur trailing her confirmed her status.
The associate had spent years in luxury retail; she recognized high-value clients instantly.

Evelyn selected several feeding bottles and two organic cotton onesies.
Remembering she still needed to pack her hospital bag, she added two sets of premium maternity loungewear.

Noticing Gale Peterson's arms overflowing with bags, she suggested, "Gale, why don't you take these to the car first? I'll wait here."

Gale hesitated, reluctant to leave her unattended.

"I promise I won't leave this store," Evelyn assured him, gesturing to the seating area.

As she rested, a familiar figure caught her eye—Vanessa Hart.

Vanessa's pregnancy bump was pronounced. Though a month behind Evelyn, her belly appeared just as large.
She was examining cribs when their eyes met. The venom in Vanessa's glare was palpable.

Two days prior, her doctor had confirmed the baby's heart defect.
A C-section would be necessary, leaving a permanent scar. Worse, the infant's survival wasn't guaranteed.

The stress had manifested physically—acne peppered her usually flawless complexion.
She bore this torment alone, maintaining a perfect facade for Eleanor and Vincent Black.

Their growing obsession with her unborn child only amplified her dread.

Seeing Evelyn ignited her resentment.
"Why is she the true heiress while I'm the imposter?
How did she secure Alexander's devotion while I'm trapped in this farce?
Even our unborn children—hers will always outrank mine."

Vanessa stroked her belly as she approached. "Shopping for baby things too?"

Evelyn ignored her.

Undeterred, Vanessa pressed on. "My doctor confirmed it's a boy. Eleanor says my carrying style leaves no doubt."
Her eyes dropped to Evelyn's midsection. "Yours is a girl, isn't it? That rounded shape never lies."

Evelyn scoffed. "Still clinging to archaic gender biases? How ironic coming from a woman."

Vanessa smirked. "I'm merely pragmatic. The Whitmore empire needs a male heir. Don't fool yourself—they all prefer boys deep down."

"An empire?" Evelyn's laugh was icy. "Does Ethan Caldwell even possess the competence to inherit it? He's failing as crown prince. What makes you think your child could redeem his bloodline?"

The verbal strike hit its mark. Vanessa's stomach clenched violently.

As Evelyn stood to leave, Vanessa's hatred crystallized into a plan.
Her child was doomed—but Evelyn's was thriving.

If doctors hinted her baby might not survive, why shouldn't Evelyn suffer that loss instead?

Outside the boutique, Evelyn scanned for Gale but spotted Ethan Caldwell approaching.
The stench of cigarettes clung to him—he'd clearly been waiting in the stairwell rather than endure baby shopping.

He froze upon seeing her, his gaze locking onto her swollen abdomen.
"Evelyn..."

The sight of her carrying another man's child churned something dark within him.
If only it were his...

She barely acknowledged him before turning away.
"Fantastic timing," she thought acidly.

Ethan intercepted her. "You're this far along and shopping alone? Where's my uncle? If he loves you so much, why isn't he here?"

At least he'd accompanied Vanessa, albeit reluctantly.
What excuse did Alexander have?

Evelyn whirled around, defensive. "Since when is husbandly escort service mandatory? We're perfectly happy. His presence isn't required for validation."

Ethan sneered. "Really? Then I suppose turning down that billion-dollar acquisition had nothing to do with you?"

The tension between them crackled like live wires...
###Chapter 680

Ethan's sharp intuition struck true. He'd clearly picked up on something unusual.

But Evelyn maintained her perfect poker face. "Of course it's for me. I'm nearing my due date, and Alexander shouldn't be traveling far. He's staying in Cresthaven to be with me until the baby arrives. He even canceled a major deal for this. What's a billion-dollar contract compared to our child?"

A humorless smile tugged at Ethan's lips, never reaching his cold eyes.

He knew better than anyone that Evelyn was merely putting on a brave front.

Ethan understood exactly why Alexander wasn't by her side, but chose not to expose her now.

After everything they'd been through, he still wanted to preserve Evelyn's dignity.

"Did you come alone? Let me drive you home." Ethan took several cautious steps toward her, concerned for her safety in her delicate condition.

But Evelyn's frosty gaze stopped him dead as she deliberately avoided his outstretched hand.

"That won't be necessary!"

She turned sharply on her heel.

"Evelyn!" Ethan's brow furrowed. "Must you be so cold? You know I'd never harm you!"

"Never harm me? Right. Well, I don't love you anymore, so you'll never get another chance to shatter my heart."

Evelyn's mocking laugh hung in the air as she walked away without a backward glance.

To her, everything between them belonged to another lifetime.

Their relationship had long surpassed casual conversations or shared rides.

Nearby, Vanessa stood frozen in the baby boutique, watching the entire exchange through the glass storefront.

Her expression twisted with bitter resentment.

Ethan could barely tolerate being in the same room with her, his lawful wife, yet here he was engaging in prolonged conversation with Evelyn. The injustice burned like acid in her veins.

Everything she'd clawed and fought for, Evelyn obtained effortlessly.

Life's unfairness was unbearable!

Biting her lip hard enough to draw blood, Vanessa stealthily pulled out her phone.

"Damian, I need a favor."

"Don't worry, it's untraceable. Once it's done, I'll give you enough to disappear abroad. This time, I guarantee the police won't catch you." Damian had only recently been released from prison.

Like the fool he was, his first stop had been the casino.

Now he'd gambled away his last cent, constantly dodging loan sharks.

With no other options, he'd turned to Vanessa for help.

After all, they'd shared intimate history, so Vanessa secretly funneled him money behind everyone's backs.

But Vanessa never made poor investments.

She'd always suspected trash like Damian might prove useful someday.

Especially since he remained Evelyn's adoptive brother.

Not to mention that year ago, Damian had nearly assaulted Evelyn in the villa, resulting in Alexander sending him to prison in a rage.

Having served time unjustly, Damian must harbor deep hatred for his adoptive sister.

And indeed, his usefulness arrived sooner than expected.

After leaving the baby store, Evelyn descended one floor, pausing when she passed a quaint music shop.

Melodic classical pieces drifted through the doorway. Stepping inside, she found walls lined with vintage vinyl records. The owner clearly had impeccable taste.

Suddenly, inspiration struck - the perfect gift for Natalie!

As a performer, her senior would undoubtedly appreciate this rare find.

Evelyn carefully selected a limited edition album from the early 20th century.

The composer's work was legendary. Natalie would cherish this.

"I'll take this one, please."

At the counter, the cashier scanned the record and processed her payment.

Clutching her purchase, Evelyn headed toward the parking garage elevators.

The doors slid open to reveal Vanessa already inside.

What wretched timing.

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn entered anyway. She couldn't afford delays - Gale was waiting.

As the doors closed, the two pregnant women stood at opposite ends, pointedly ignoring each other.

What should have been a brief descent turned nightmarish when the elevator jerked violently. Evelyn instinctively grabbed the railing.

Then the lights flickered ominously before plunging them into complete darkness.

Vanessa shrieked, frantically mashing the control panel buttons.

Evelyn remained remarkably composed.

This was a high-end mall - management would prioritize their rescue.

Vanessa slammed the emergency button. "What's wrong with your damn elevator? I'm heavily pregnant! If anything happens to my baby, I'll sue this entire mall into bankruptcy!"

The operator's panicked apologies promised immediate assistance.

Vanessa seethed at her misfortune.

Everything went wrong whenever Evelyn appeared!

"You broke the elevator!" Vanessa snapped. "You must be too heavy! It worked fine until you got in!"

Evelyn couldn't be bothered dignifying such idiocy with a response.

Terrified of the dark, Vanessa activated her phone's flashlight.

The sudden illumination eased her panic slightly.

Turning, she saw Evelyn standing calmly, showing no fear. "It's pitch black! Aren't you scared?" Vanessa demanded.

Evelyn's voice dripped ice. "I've nothing to hide. Why would I be afraid?"

The barb struck home.

Never one to waste drama, Vanessa immediately called Ethan.

"Darling, where are you? I'm trapped in the mall elevator!"

Ethan's disinterested "Mmm" crushed her.

His utter lack of concern felt like punching a brick wall.

"It's so dark! My legs feel weak. Ethan, please come hold me?"

Vanessa's damsel act had once worked wonders on Ethan. Now, it fell flat.

Anticipating rejection, she hastily added, "Evelyn's here too! She's pretending to be brave, but I know she's terrified!"

Mentioning Evelyn's predicament finally sparked a reaction.

"Hold on, I'm coming!"

Though help was en route, Vanessa tasted only bitterness.

She knew exactly whose presence had motivated Ethan.

"You're in trouble and didn't even call your husband?" Vanessa sneered.

"Oh right, I forgot. He's not in town. Even if you called, he couldn't come. Rumor says Isabella ran away. He's probably searching for her, isn't he? Doesn't that make you jealous, Evelyn?"

Evelyn's reply came frosty and measured. "Jealousy isn't in my nature."
###Chapter 681

The elevator hummed softly as Vanessa and Evelyn stood in tense silence.

A mall employee's muffled voice penetrated the metal doors. "Ladies, is everything alright in there?"

Vanessa, still smarting from Evelyn's earlier rejection, snapped. "Do we look alright? We're trapped like rats! I'm suing this entire establishment!"

The apologetic voice continued. "The repair team is en route. Just five more minutes."

"Five minutes?" Vanessa shrieked, her pregnancy hormones amplifying her rage. "I could give birth in five minutes!"

Outside, hurried footsteps announced Ethan's arrival.

Vanessa's voice instantly turned saccharine. "Ethan darling, I'm seven months pregnant! My back is killing me and my ankles have swollen to twice their size!"

Ethan pressed his ear against the cold metal, listening intently. When he didn't hear Evelyn's voice, his stomach clenched.

If Vanessa was uncomfortable, how was Evelyn coping?

His voice came out strained. "And her? Is she okay?"

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms. Of course his first concern would be for Evelyn.

Through gritted teeth she replied, "Perfectly fine, as always."

Ethan exhaled sharply.

Vanessa leaned close to Evelyn, her whisper venomous. "Enjoying this? My husband still pines for you."

Tears pricked at Vanessa's eyes. She despised her own weakness - how could she still adore a man who so clearly loved another?

She'd initially pursued Ethan to spite Evelyn, but somewhere along the way, the charade had become reality. Now she was trapped in this loveless marriage, watching her husband's eyes follow another woman.

A choked sob escaped her lips as she collapsed against the elevator wall.

Evelyn turned, surprised by the sudden emotional outburst. Pregnancy hormones were one thing, but this seemed more profound.

She offered a tissue. "You might want to..."

"Save your fake concern!" Vanessa snapped, though she reluctantly accepted the tissue as the elevator doors began pinging - signaling imminent rescue.

The moment the doors parted, Ethan surged forward - only for Vanessa to intercept him dramatically.

"Ethan! I was terrified!" she wailed, clinging to him like ivy.

But Ethan's gaze remained locked on Evelyn as she stepped into the bright mall lights. "Evelyn, are you—"

Evelyn walked right past him without acknowledgment.

A flustered employee offered gift baskets. "Our deepest apologies—"

"Your cheap trinkets can't compensate for nearly killing us!" Vanessa screeched.

Evelyn froze mid-step.

Was that...? Among the retreating maintenance crew, a familiar silhouette made her blood run cold.

"Damian?" she called out.

The uniformed worker didn't flinch, disappearing around a corner.

Ethan stiffened at the name. He knew exactly what Damian had tried to do to Evelyn years ago.

His hands clenched into fists as he turned on Vanessa. "You're working with him again, aren't you?"

Vanessa paled. "I haven't seen him since prison!"

Evelyn's phone buzzed - a message to Alexander: [Saw Damian. Is he out?]

When no immediate reply came, Gale's call interrupted her thoughts. "Where are you? I've circled this mall twice."

Still shaken from the elevator incident, Evelyn opted for the stairs. "Meet me at the car. I'm taking the emergency exit."

Ethan watched her go, then abruptly disentangled from Vanessa to follow.

"Ethan!" Vanessa's cry went unanswered as she waddled after them, her pregnant belly slowing her down.

How did Evelyn move so effortlessly in her condition?

The stairwell swallowed both figures, leaving Vanessa alone with her crumbling marriage and the chilling possibility that Damian Cross was back.
###Chapter 682

Andrew's phone buzzed violently against the mahogany desk.

This wasn't another anonymous caller.

The screen displayed a saved contact - one he hadn't expected to hear from today.

He swiped answer with deliberate slowness. "Speak."

"Sebastian sent me." The voice crackled through the receiver. "Your sister's been taken by the Falcon."

Ice flooded Andrew's veins.

Isabella's existence was his most closely guarded secret.

Not even his most trusted lieutenants knew about her.

For over a decade, he'd buried Andrew Morgan's identity, letting the world believe him dead.

Yet Sebastian Powell knew.

Which meant...

Had the bastard been playing Isabella this entire time?

"Effective immediately," Andrew's voice dropped to subzero, "all contracts with the Powell syndicate are nullified."

"But sir," the intermediary protested, "we've only completed one transaction with them."

Andrew's jaw clenched.

That single deal had been Sebastian's reward for protecting Isabella.

Now it was clear - every interaction had been calculated.

Sebastian must have uncovered their connection months ago and manipulated Isabella to gain leverage.

No one played Andrew Morgan and walked away unscathed.

"Where is he?" Andrew's fist shattered the desk's edge. "Bring me Sebastian Powell now!"

Sebastian arrived within twenty-seven minutes.

Their first official meeting should have been ceremonial - two crime lords negotiating territory.

Instead, Andrew greeted him with a steel-toed boot to the ribs.

Sebastian skidded across the concrete, blood painting his lips ruby.

Through the pain, he noted the familial resemblance - Isabella's delicate features hardened into masculine cruelty.

"You used my sister." Andrew's voice could freeze hell. "Did you think I wouldn't discover your little game?"

The Powell family operated in shadows deeper than most.

As the middle son, Sebastian fought daily battles against his brothers under their father Reginald's watchful eye.

Andrew's patronage had tipped the scales in Sebastian's favor.

Now those scales would be his undoing.

"Every time I checked on Isabella," Andrew circled like a shark, "you just happened to be there. That's no coincidence."

Sebastian wiped his mouth. "My feelings for her are real."

Another kick sent him sprawling.

"Liar!" Andrew's shout echoed off warehouse walls. "You're just like your father - trading flesh for power."

Sebastian forced himself upright. "Believe what you want. Right now, the Falcon has Isabella. You know what he does to women."

Andrew's laugh held no mirth. "How convenient you know my enemies."

As if summoned, Andrew's phone rang.

Unknown caller.

Sebastian's eyes burned with urgency. "Answer it!"

Andrew never took unscreened calls.

One wrong connection could bring the entire FBI down on his operation.

But Isabella...

He pressed the phone to his ear.

"Well hello, Ghost." The voice dripped venom. "Miss me?"

Andrew's grip turned the phone to creaking plastic. "Foster."

"Got a present for you." Daniel Foster's chuckle slithered through the speaker. "Little birdie told me about your sister. I've got buyers lined up already."

Andrew's vision tunneled red. "Touch her and I'll salt every acre your family ever owned."

"Promises, promises." Foster's grin was audible. "Here's the deal - you come alone. One life for another."

The Falcon's hatred ran deeper than rival gangs.

Andrew had annihilated Foster's operations, starving his empire to dust.

This wasn't just business.

This was personal.
###Chapter 683

The silence on the other end of the line made Alexander think Andrew was hesitating. "I heard you came from money," he taunted. "Now your whole family's gone except for that sister of yours. What's wrong? Don't care if she lives or dies?"

"Give me the address. Don’t touch her."

"We'll talk when you get here."

The call ended, and Andrew’s expression darkened.

Daniel Foster had an army of men loyal to him. Walking into their hideout alone would be suicide.

Given how much they despised him, they’d tear him apart the second he stepped inside.

And Daniel had made it clear—come alone, or Isabella dies.

Andrew knew the odds.

If he wanted to survive this, he’d need backup.

But the police had been breathing down their necks lately. A full-scale operation would draw too much attention—risk exposing everything they’d built.

Yet, within minutes, his decision was made.

Isabella was non-negotiable.

He headed for the door.

Sebastian rushed after him. "I'm coming with you!"

Andrew didn’t even glance back.

Evelyn had just reached the stairwell when her phone buzzed.

Alexander.

Her pulse jumped as she answered.

His voice was tense. "Damian? Where did you see him?"

"At Willow Mall. I got Natalie a gift and picked up ties for you. Heading back now."

"You went alone?" His tone sharpened. "With your stomach that big, you should’ve told me. What if something happened?"

The sound of wind rushing through the phone told her he was already speeding toward her.

"I went with Gale. Besides, you were busy looking for Isabella. I checked your study—you weren’t there." Her voice softened, fingers tightening around the shopping bag.

A beat of silence. Then, guilt laced his words.

"I was searching for her. Extremists took her. The police are on it. But if you wanted to shop, you should’ve told me. I’d have made time."

Evelyn said nothing.

"Are you angry?" he murmured.

"No."

"Then why so quiet?"

"Just don’t feel like talking."

Alexander exhaled. "Andrew’s death… it’s on me. For years, I’ve dreamed of killing him with my own hands, Evelyn. It haunts me."

She understood.

Alexander was a man of principle. Years ago, he and Andrew had been taken hostage by drug lords.

Only Alexander came back.

The captors forced them to fight—only one would survive. The trauma nearly broke him.

Andrew’s disappearance left Alexander convinced he’d killed him in a blind rage.

Now, that guilt extended to Isabella.

Evelyn hadn’t lived through his nightmares, but she knew he’d move heaven and earth to keep Isabella safe.

"Any leads?" she asked.

"If I had any, I wouldn’t be losing my mind." He rubbed his temples. "I’ll meet you at the mall. Where exactly are you?"

"Don’t bother. I’m already leaving."

As she spoke, she stepped into the parking garage.

The space was vast, shadows stretching between flickering lights.

Then—headlights.

Blinding high beams seared her vision.

She barely had time to react before Ethan’s shout echoed behind her. "Evelyn, MOVE!"

Her blood turned to ice.

The truck wasn’t slowing down.

It was accelerating.

Alexander’s voice crackled through the phone. "Evelyn? What’s happening?"

No time to answer.

Pregnant. Exposed. Nowhere to run.

The driver swerved, matching her frantic steps.

Then—pain.

A contraction ripped through her, dropping her to her knees.

She twisted, shielding her belly with her body as the truck bore down.

Ethan sprinted toward her, screaming at the driver. "STOP!"

But Damian Cross didn’t care.

Revenge burned in his bloodshot eyes.

Alexander had put him behind bars. Now, he’d take everything from him.

He floored the gas.

BANG.

A figure lunged from the shadows—colliding with the truck.

The impact sent Dominic Powell crashing onto the hood, cracking the windshield.

Damian slammed the brakes.

Evelyn gasped, clutching her stomach.

Blood pooled beneath her.

"EVELYN!"

Ethan skidded to her side, hands shaking as he pulled her into his arms.

"I’ve got you—hospital now—just hold on—"

His voice broke.

His palms were slick with her blood.

Dominic groaned, pushing himself up from the pavement, blood dripping from his lips.

Evelyn’s vision blurred.

The last thing she heard was Alexander’s distant scream through the phone.

Then—darkness.
###Chapter 684

"Mr. Powell! Are you hurt!"

Nathaniel, who had just parked nearby, stared at Dominic with panic in his eyes.

Dominic had mentioned wanting to drive around without specifying a destination, so Nathaniel took the initiative to head toward Willow Mall near Evelyn's apartment.

Just as they entered the underground parking before the car fully stopped, Nathaniel witnessed the unthinkable. When Dominic saw Evelyn being chased by a pickup truck, he threw open the door and lunged forward.

Dominic's legs had barely recovered enough to walk, still healing from previous injuries, when this accident happened.

Tears welled in Nathaniel's eyes.

The man's luck was too cruel! He'd been struck and thrown through the air trying to intercept that truck!

The windshield had shattered completely. Dominic must have sustained severe injuries!

Damian Cross never expected someone would suddenly dart in front of his vehicle at the critical moment.

Glass shards flew into his eyes, blurring Damian's vision.

Despite the pain, Damian immediately tried to reverse the truck.

Now that he'd been spotted and knowing mall security's reputation, he needed to escape fast or face another prison term. Everything appeared crimson as he rubbed his stinging eyes.

But just as Damian prepared to flee, Dominic planted one foot on the truck's hood and vaulted onto the vehicle.

Blood still trickled from Dominic's lips, but his piercing gaze resembled a demon emerging from hell to claim souls. One look could make anyone's blood run cold.

For reasons unknown, Damian suddenly felt terror realizing this man looked familiar.

He must have seen him in prison.

Rumors said this man had spent ten years inside, feared by all. Even guards took detours to avoid him. During Damian's own incarceration, he'd heard countless stories about this legend.

But shortly after Damian's imprisonment, Dominic had been released.

What baffled Damian was why this man suddenly appeared at the mall, deliberately putting himself between Evelyn and danger.

He'd heard Dominic was ruthless but never known him to play hero.

Dominic kicked the windshield again, shattering it completely. With a cold smirk, he reached in and hauled Damian straight from the driver's seat. Caught off guard by such skill, Damian found himself airborne before he could react.

Dominic executed a perfect judo throw, slamming Damian hard onto the pavement.

With a sickening thud, Damian's head struck first. Stars exploded in his vision as pain radiated through his skull.

Dominic jumped down, planting his shoe on Damian's face and grinding down hard.

"Did you ask permission before touching what's mine?" Dominic's icy voice sounded like a death sentence.

A warm wetness spread beneath Damian, followed by the acrid smell of urine. Dominic's demeanor had literally scared the piss out of him.

Nathaniel rushed over, restraining Damian while eyeing Dominic worriedly. "Mr. Powell! You're bleeding badly! Where are you injured?"

Externally Dominic appeared unharmed, but blood kept pouring from his mouth, staining his white shirt crimson. Nathaniel knew the truth - Dominic had collided with the vehicle at full speed. This was internal bleeding!

Far deadlier than any surface wound!

Dominic remained silent, turning toward Evelyn.

Evelyn knelt clutching her stomach, a growing pool of blood beneath her.

"Evelyn! Evelyn! What's wrong!"

Her phone lay discarded, still connected to Alexander's call. His frantic voice came through the speaker, ignored by all.

Evelyn's abdomen contracted painfully while her lower back throbbed where the bumper had struck. The agony left her breathless, forcing shallow gasps. Ethan moved to lift her.

Dominic stepped forward. "Don't you dare touch her!"

Blood continued dripping from Dominic's lips as he advanced, leaving crimson footprints with each unsteady step.

Though his vision blurred and legs wobbled, he shoved Ethan aside to reach Evelyn.

"Stay with me," Dominic rasped, "I'll get you to the hospital."

But Evelyn, consumed by pain, couldn't hear him over the ringing in her ears.

Ethan blocked Dominic's path. "You're bleeding out! How can you help anyone? Let me handle this!" Raised in the Caldwell family's privilege, Ethan expected instant obedience.

Never had he witnessed such violence or seen someone risk their life so recklessly.

He'd been closest to Evelyn when the truck approached, yet hesitated at the critical moment.

If he'd acted as fearlessly as Dominic, he could have pulled Evelyn to safety first.

Those seconds of hesitation had cost Evelyn her injury. Guilt gnawed at Ethan, who now sought redemption.

Steadying his breathing, Ethan bent to lift Evelyn.

Dominic's cold laugh sent chills down spines. Despite his pallor, his grip was iron as he seized Ethan's arm. "Know your place. You lost your chance, so stop pretending to care. Understood?" The words darkened Ethan's face with humiliation.

Lost his chance?

"I just want to help."

"As if you've earned the right."

Their gazes locked in silent combat, tension crackling between them.

Suddenly, a woman's piercing scream echoed from a nearby stairwell.

Something heavy thudded against concrete.

Vanessa Hart clutched her stomach, crying out, "Help... someone help me!"
###Chapter 685

"Bloody hell."

Vanessa was carefully descending the stairs, trying to catch up with Ethan and Evelyn. Her pregnant belly made every movement cautious, terrified of anything happening to her unborn child.

But who could have predicted that with just three steps left, a filthy rat would dart across her path?

The sudden movement made her jump violently.

Disaster struck. Her foot slipped, and she found herself doing an involuntary split on the concrete stairs.

The pain was unbearable, shooting through her legs like fire.

Her inner thighs screamed in agony, making her suspect something might be broken.

After finally adjusting her position, Vanessa immediately called for help.

She couldn't move an inch now. It felt like her pelvis was splitting apart.

She'd heard commotion outside moments earlier, including what sounded like Ethan's voice. He couldn't be far.

"Ethan... help me!"

"I fell, Ethan! Are you there?" Vanessa cried out in pain.

In the underground parking garage, Dominic had already scooped Evelyn into his arms.

He moved steadily toward his waiting car.

Ethan hesitated, torn between pursuing them and the desperate cries coming from the stairwell.

"Ethan!" Vanessa's voice grew more frantic, terrified he might ignore her.

Ethan's jaw clenched, her wails grating on his already frayed nerves.

"Ethan, if you don't come now, your son and I won't make it!"

Reluctantly, Ethan turned toward the stairwell.

"I think something's broken," Vanessa whimpered, unable to stand.

She looked up at Ethan with pleading eyes, arms outstretched.

Strangely, all Ethan could see when looking at Vanessa was the image of Evelyn covered in blood.

"Ethan, why are your hands covered in blood? I heard fighting earlier. What happened?" Vanessa asked pointedly.

Ethan's lips parted, but exhaustion made words impossible.

"I'll take you to the hospital."

He slid his arms beneath Vanessa's knees and lifted her effortlessly.

When they reached the parking garage, Damian had already been subdued by mall security, with Nathaniel handling the aftermath. Seeing Damian's bloody form on the ground, Vanessa feigned shock and buried her face in Ethan's chest.

"Ethan, why is Damian here? Did he escape prison? Was he after Evelyn? I swear I had nothing to do with this. Look, I'm injured too!"

Vanessa clung to Ethan's neck, desperate to prove her innocence.

But Ethan was miles away, staring blankly ahead like a marionette with its strings cut.

When her words failed to register, Vanessa fell silent. The fall had been painful - she worried about the baby. But what truly unsettled her was how easily Damian had been captured. This wasn't part of the plan.

"That imbecile!" she seethed internally. "Starting a brawl in public?"

She'd only wanted Evelyn to lose the baby, not this public spectacle.

Still, Vanessa wasn't worried about Damian talking. She held all the cards now.

Dominic raced to the car with Evelyn in his arms.

They reached Gale's vehicle, and when Gale saw Evelyn's bloodied state, guilt overwhelmed him. "Mrs. Whitmore!"

He'd only been gone briefly! How had this happened?

Gale had seen the truck rampaging through the garage but never imagined Evelyn was the target!

Evelyn's lips were pale with pain, speech impossible.

Lying in the backseat, she saw the blood dripping from Dominic's mouth.

From experience, Evelyn instantly recognized Dominic's injuries were just as severe as hers.

"Are you insane?" she managed.

She never expected Dominic would risk himself to save her.

Seeing his reckless disregard for safety brought tears to her eyes.

Despite his critical condition, he'd carried her to safety... With internal injuries, wasn't this suicidal?

"Take off your shoes."

Dominic frowned. "Why?"

"You're bleeding internally. I need to stop it or you'll die." Evelyn instantly diagnosed the severity from Dominic's pallor.

Multiple organ hemorrhaging. Critical condition.

Dominic leaned back, breathing shallowly against the pain.

"Worry about yourself. Death doesn't want me yet." More blood spilled from his lips.

"This isn't a joke. You're worse than I am. Without immediate treatment, you won't survive."

"Who cares if this worthless life ends? Let it."

"Dominic!"

Evelyn knew she was going into labor.

The impact likely caused placental abruption.

Without childbirth experience, she could only wait for hospital care.

If the baby survived, wonderful. If not... fate.

But Dominic was different.

He was right here, and she could provide emergency aid.

Every second counted with internal bleeding. She couldn't watch him suffer.

"Take off your damn shoe!" she ordered. "Find the acupoint on his big toe and apply pressure! Maintain it until we reach the hospital! It'll slow the bleeding!"

Gale wasn't wasting time either, running red lights when a call came through.

It was Alexander.

"Sir, Mrs. Whitmore's in trouble! We're nearly at the hospital!"

Evelyn fell silent, though the line remained open. Alexander could tell from the commotion that her injuries were severe.

"Which hospital? I'm coming now."

Nothing was more devastating than hearing your loved one hurt, powerless to help.

Alexander wished for teleportation.

"Sir... she's lost significant blood."

"Understood. Just drive!"

The ten-minute journey felt endless. Upon arrival, medics rushed out with stretchers.

Gale hurried alongside as they loaded Evelyn. Dominic had already lost consciousness from his injuries.

Shock had set in.

Evelyn's diagnosis was correct - Dominic's internal bleeding was critical.

That fool... Despite his condition, he'd insisted on carrying her away from Ethan...

If he hadn't strained himself, his injuries wouldn't have worsened!

Tears filled Evelyn's eyes.

"Dominic, don't you dare die!"

Internal bleeding was a dance with death. If he died saving her...

Medical staff rushed the stretchers inside, separating them for treatment.

Dominic lay motionless, eyes closed. The usually vibrant man didn't respond to Evelyn's desperate pleas.
###Chapter 686

"The baby is in distress. We need to perform an emergency C-section now." After assessing Evelyn's condition, the doctor wasted no time rushing her into surgery. "Get anesthesia here—stat!"

The command barely left his lips before the OR doors slammed shut.

At that exact moment, Alexander burst from the elevator, chest heaving.

His frantic gaze locked onto Simon standing vigil outside. "How is she?"

"The baby's struggling. Mrs. Whitmore lost significant blood." Simon's voice turned grave. "Sir, if you'd arrived sixty seconds sooner, you could've seen her before they took her in."

The words were a knife to Alexander's ribs.

His wife was fighting for her life, and he hadn't been there. The guilt was suffocating.

He never imagined Evelyn would visit Willow Mall alone. Had he known, he'd have glued himself to her side.

Childbirth was a dance with death even under normal circumstances—let alone after today's trauma. As Simon recounted the events, Alexander's expression darkened to storm clouds.

Sending Damian to prison was supposed to reform him. Instead, the man had emerged more vicious than ever. Alexander's fist collided with the wall, the impact echoing his fury.

Just hearing the account made his blood run cold. How terrified must Evelyn have been?

Guilt gnawed at him, but this wasn't the time for self-flagellation. There were things only he could handle.

"What about Dominic? His condition?"

He owed the man a debt. Without Dominic shielding Evelyn, the consequences didn't bear thinking about.

Yet the thought twisted something primal in Alexander's gut.

He hadn't realized the depth of Dominic's feelings for his wife.

Alexander's fingers curled into fists, an unfamiliar tension coiling in his chest.

Simon shook his head. "No update. I've been focused here."

A beat of silence. The Powells likely remained oblivious to Dominic's injuries—not that they'd care, given how they treated him. Right now, the man was probably alone on some OR table, fighting for survival.

"When they brought him in, Mr. Powell couldn't speak. Pale as death." Simon lowered his voice. "The ER team said he'd lost too much blood. They weren't optimistic."

The internal medicine and maternity wings were in separate buildings. Dominic was currently under the knife across campus.

Alexander hesitated only a moment before dialing.

"Killian, I need a favor. A friend's critically injured—your expertise could save his life."

Killian Rhodes, the legendary ex-military surgeon whose hands were said to work miracles. Since retiring to civilian practice, he rarely operated anymore. Most couldn't even secure a consultation.

But for Alexander? He agreed instantly. "Consider it done."

As the call ended, Alexander leaned against the wall, pressing fingers to his temples.

Simon emerged from the elevator bank. "Sir, Damian's been processed. Given his recent release and immediate reoffense, sentencing will be severe."

Alexander's expression turned arctic. "Severe? That animal deserves a bullet. Why waste resources keeping him alive?"

The lethal intent in his voice made Simon stiffen.

"There's more... Vanessa Hart was at the mall during the incident."

Alexander's eyes flashed like drawn steel.

Vanessa. He'd warned her to stay in her lane.

"Bring her to me."

"Impossible. She took a fall—fractured bones, potential miscarriage. Charlotte and Vincent are camped at her bedside." Simon hesitated. "They're banking on this pregnancy."

Vanessa's frequent hospital visits weren't unusual, but her coincidental appearance wherever Damian surfaced? And now Evelyn was hurt?

Alexander didn't believe in coincidences.

"Then fetch me Ethan!" he snarled.

Ethan Caldwell arrived promptly, anxiety etching his features. "Uncle Alex, is Aunt Evelyn—"

Alexander's fist connected with Ethan's jaw before he could finish.

Ethan staggered, clutching his face. "What was that for?"

"Ask your wife!" Alexander's voice could've frozen hell. "You think Vanessa's innocent just because Damian did the dirty work?"

Ethan's silence was damning.

Truthfully, he suspected Vanessa's involvement too. But... she carried his child.

After her fall, Eleanor and Vincent had descended on the hospital. Doctors said Vanessa's fractures were complex—the baby's position prevented proper treatment. All she could do was endure the agony.

If the pain became unbearable? Termination before pain management.

At seven and a half months, survival odds were slim.

With Eleanor and Vincent obsessed with their heir, Vanessa had no choice but to white-knuckle through the torment. Though Ethan cared nothing for Vanessa, seeing any woman suffer so for his bloodline stirred something uncomfortably close to pity.

After a loaded pause, Ethan vowed, "If Vanessa's involved, I'll make it right. But not today."
###Chapter 687


Alexander also prayed nothing would happen to Evelyn.

Having witnessed the accident firsthand, Alexander couldn't shake his concern for her.

He completely understood Ethan's rage.

Ethan let out a bitter laugh. "Punish her? But what about Evelyn's suffering? Will punishing Vanessa erase what Evelyn's enduring?"

No one could predict how this incident might impact Evelyn's unborn child.


Punishment wasn't Ethan's true desire.

All he wanted was for Evelyn and their baby to be safe. He would have gladly borne the pain himself.

Her prenatal checkups had been flawless—she should have carried to term.

Yet this senseless tragedy forced her into premature labor.

It shattered Alexander to see her endure such unnecessary agony.

What tormented him most was his absence when she needed him most.


The guilt would haunt him forever.

The crushing helplessness suffocated him, but time couldn't be undone.

He should have been her shield. It should have been him.

Alexander couldn't comprehend it. Evelyn had been perfectly fine when he left that morning.

How had she ended up in surgery after just a few hours?

No apology could make up for his failure.

He wasn't sure if Evelyn would ever forgive him—or how this would fracture their marriage.

Alexander stared at the operating room doors, eyes bloodshot.

His fists clenched, murderous intent blazing in his gaze.


"Pray Evelyn and the baby survive. Otherwise, I'll slaughter Vanessa myself—no matter who shields her." Alexander's hand brushed his holster.

Simon froze when he spotted the gun.

Since Alexander's military days, Simon had never seen this side of him.

Someone had crossed a line that couldn't be uncrossed.

Simon silently hoped Vanessa wasn't involved—because if she was, no one could save her.


Three agonizing hours passed. Midnight loomed.

Alexander hadn't moved since the surgery began.

Suddenly, the doors swung open.

A nurse emerged.

Alexander lunged forward, eyes wild.

"Are you the father? I need your signature for the NICU transfer."

Alexander's hands trembled. Fear flickered in his eyes.

"Transfer?" His voice cracked.

Signing papers during surgery never meant good news.

Back in his police academy days, signing papers meant someone wasn't coming home.

Dread coiled in his gut.

The nurse clarified hastily, "The baby's here—but he's premature. Under five pounds. He needs NICU care."

Relief flooded Alexander.

"And Evelyn? How is she?"

"Stable. The accident gave her a scare, but her injuries are minor. The baby's condition is more critical."

Due to placental abruption and oxygen deprivation, the newborn had inhaled amniotic fluid. Intensive care was mandatory.

Evelyn's safety lifted a boulder from Alexander's chest.

Simon asked, "Boy or girl?"

"A boy. But with underdeveloped lungs, he'll likely need a ventilator. No visits yet."

Alexander nodded stiffly.

"Congratulations, sir! A son!" Simon beamed.

But Alexander couldn't celebrate.


Not until Evelyn was safe.

She still hadn't emerged from surgery.

After signing, Alexander resumed his vigil.

An hour later, Evelyn was wheeled out—unconscious, drained from the ordeal.

Alexander seized her hand.

"Evelyn!"

No response. Her lashes lay still against pale cheeks.


Alexander memorized every detail of her face, terrified to blink.

Only with her back at his side did his pulse steady.

"Evelyn, forgive me..."

Her bloodless complexion screamed of trauma.

Guilt strangled him.

He cradled her icy fingers between his palms, willing warmth into them.

Alexander couldn't look away—as if she'd vanish the moment he did.

She was his Achilles' heel.


He remained statue-still by her bedside, gaze locked on her.

Deep into the night, Simon crept in.

"Sir, you need rest. The doctor confirmed Evelyn's stable. The couch—"

Alexander shook his head.

"I'm staying."

Simon hesitated but retreated.

Alexander rasped, "Dominic's status?"

Simon stiffened. "Still in surgery—six hours now."

Evelyn had been out for three.

"It's late. Go home," Alexander dismissed.

Simon exited quietly.

Alone, Alexander studied Evelyn's peaceful slumber.


Dawn approached when his phone buzzed.

He slipped into the hallway.

Alvin's ID flashed—his former academy mate, now lead investigator.

"We located Isabella, but... the situation's grim."

Alexander's gut twisted.

"Define 'grim.'"


"We've pinpointed the hideout. But intel suggests your sister..."

The unspoken horror hung between them.

###Chapter 688

Alexander's words on the phone sent a chill down Daniel's spine. His grip tightened around the device, knuckles turning white.

"That can't be true!"

"The intel is confirmed," Alexander replied, voice grim. "We apprehended one of their surgeons. But we still don’t know the full situation inside. If we storm in recklessly, they might execute the hostages. Their lives are at stake."

A heavy silence settled between them before Alexander continued.

"Daniel, back at the academy, you were the best at covert ops. If we want to save Isabella, we need you to lead the infiltration team."

The call ended, leaving Daniel standing frozen, his expression unreadable.

Alexander’s words echoed in his mind.

The kidnappers had chosen their hideout well—an abandoned industrial complex, a tangled maze of interconnected factories. For any ordinary officer, navigating it would be a death sentence.

One wrong turn, and they’d alert the criminals before even locating the hostages.

And these men were ruthless.

Trapped, they wouldn’t hesitate to kill.

But Daniel wasn’t just any officer.

He was trained for this.

With him leading the team, their chances of success skyrocketed.

His gaze drifted to Evelyn, still unconscious in the hospital bed, her chest rising and falling steadily.

A storm of emotions raged inside him.

He wanted nothing more than to stay by her side, to be there when she woke.

To beg for her forgiveness for failing to protect her.

To be the first face she saw when her eyes fluttered open.

But—

Alexander’s call had shattered that hope.

The kidnappers had already carved out one of Isabella’s kidneys.

She was running out of time.

The monsters hadn’t even waited a full day before mutilating her. If they delayed any longer, she wouldn’t survive.

Daniel had questioned the report at first. How could they have taken her kidney so quickly?

But Alexander had confirmed it.

The surgeon had been caught red-handed, the organ still fresh in his possession.

Under interrogation, he’d confessed everything.

A cold dread settled in Daniel’s bones.

If Isabella died, the guilt would drown him.

Andrew had given him his only shot at survival.

And in return, he’d failed to protect his sister.

With both parents gone, Isabella had no one left.

He was her only hope.

Daniel moved to Evelyn’s bedside, pressing a lingering kiss to her forehead.

"Forgive me," he whispered. "Please… don’t hate me for this."

One last look, filled with longing, before he turned and walked away.

Meanwhile, in the derelict factory, Isabella lay motionless on the bloodstained operating table.

Her vision blurred in and out of focus.

The metallic scent of blood filled the air, pooling beneath her.

Her face was ghostly pale, lips cracked and dry.

A single tear traced a path down her cheek, disappearing into her hairline.

Her eyes—empty, resigned—stared into the abyss above.

She had stared death in the face all night.

And it had been hell.

These men weren’t just criminals.

They were monsters.

They’d taken her kidney while she was still awake.

Now she understood why they’d starved her.

She was nothing but livestock to them.

A fresh wave of agony wracked her body as she remembered how she’d begged, screamed, clawed at the ground until her fingers bled.

She was only twenty-three.

She’d thrown herself at Daniel Foster’s feet, forehead splitting open from the force of her desperation.

Blood had dripped into her eyes, but he hadn’t flinched.

No mercy.

No humanity.

Just cold, clinical cruelty.

She had never known despair like this.

Screaming until her voice gave out, with no one coming to save her.

What had she done to deserve this?

At first, she’d thought they just wanted ransom.

But she’d been wrong.

After a day of starvation, a masked man had appeared.

A surgeon.

He knew anatomy too well.

They’d dragged her to a makeshift operating room—filthy, rusted tools scattered about.

No anesthesia.

Just the scalpel, slicing into her flesh.

The pain had been unbearable.

Her limbs were bound, leaving her helpless as he carved into her.

She’d convulsed, screams tearing from her throat until it was raw.

Biting down had filled her mouth with blood.

She could still feel the blade—cold, precise—peeling her apart.

Death would have been kinder.

They’d gagged her when she tried to bite her tongue.

By the end, the cloth was soaked crimson.

Agony.

Pure, unrelenting agony.

Like thousands of needles burrowing into her bones.

Muscles twisting, teeth grinding to dust.

She had lived through a nightmare.

The "surgery" ended at dawn.

No aftercare.

Just crude stitches sealing her wound.

She could feel the blood pooling inside her.

Her tears had long dried up.

Her body trembled violently, icy cold.

She was so scared.

So alone.

Her parents had died when she was ten, sacrificed for the Powells.

All she had left was Andrew.

But he was gone too.

She was the last Morgan.

At twelve years old, her world had turned to darkness.

An age when she should have been surrounded by love, she was abandoned.

Even her distant relatives had whispered behind her back.

A cursed child.

A bringer of death.

They feared she’d doom them too.

"Am I really cursed?"

She’d known they didn’t want her.

So from middle school onward, she lived in the dorms.

Weekends were the worst.

Empty halls.

Silent rooms.

Just her.

Always her.

Christmas was the most vivid memory—watching classmates leave, laughing with their families.

She had nowhere to go.

The school locked the dorms during breaks.

So she’d hide.

Stockpile bread.

Pray no one found her.

While others celebrated, she sat in the dark, too afraid to even turn on a light.

That was her life.

Alone.

Always alone.

###Chapter 689

The only comfort in Isabella's life had been Alexander's kindness.

Despite his own struggles, after joining the police academy, he'd consistently sent her money and encouraged her education. She was like a drowning woman grasping at the last lifeline, desperately clinging to that faint glimmer of hope above the dark waters. Isabella held onto Alexander with everything she had, determined to claw her way out of the abyss.

To the outside world, she was a promising music graduate. No one knew the true cost of that achievement.

Her emotional dependence on Alexander ran dangerously deep.

It was an obsessive attachment she couldn't even rationalize to herself.

When the man who'd always been her anchor suddenly tried to establish boundaries because of another woman, Isabella couldn't accept it.

Alexander had been her guiding light. She'd fought so hard to reach that brightness, only to have it snatched away without warning. Lost in sudden darkness, terror consumed her.

She never truly meant to harm Evelyn. Every desperate act was just to recapture Alexander's attention, to reclaim even a fraction of his focus.

Was this twisted obsession really love?

Isabella stared blankly at the ceiling, feeling her world collapse around her.

Fresh out of college, her life should have been beginning. Instead, she saw only endless despair ahead.

Why? Why was this happening to her?

She'd done nothing to deserve this!

Her fists clenched until her nails drew blood, but nothing could dull the excruciating pain radiating through her body. During the illegal surgery, she'd lost consciousness multiple times from the agony. These monsters had nearly killed her.

Isabella's face was deathly pale.

Daniel approached with a cruel smirk, taking in her broken form sprawled across the operating table. His grin widened at her suffering.

He tossed water in her face, jolting her back to awareness.

"Enjoying yourself, princess? My surgeon did clean work, didn't he? I specifically instructed him to be gentle with you."

Blood filled Isabella's mouth. Her unfocused eyes slowly locked onto Daniel, brimming with tears and burning hatred.

Too weak to move, she could only glare.

"Don't worry. Your precious brother should be arriving soon." Daniel patted her cheek mockingly. "You can tell Andrew all about your grievances then."

He leaned closer, voice dripping with malice. "Oh wait - when Andrew comes charging in, he'll walk right into my trap. Then neither of you will be leaving here alive."

Only then did Isabella notice Daniel's men arming themselves behind him, preparing for a bloody confrontation.

After a night of processing this nightmare, she finally believed Andrew might truly be alive.

Daniel kept emphasizing this was all revenge against Andrew, his sworn enemy.

A sudden crash echoed from outside.

Daniel and Eric exchanged knowing glances, silently communicating something sinister.

Right on cue, a thug burst in. "Boss! Andrew's here! He's already taken out three of our guys!"

"Damn bastard! I'll put him down myself!" Daniel snarled, pulling a gun from his waistband. "If he's stupid enough to come here, he won't leave breathing! Weapons ready, boys! Tonight we finish this!" With furious curses, Daniel led his gang outside.

Apparently deeming Isabella no escape risk, they left her completely unguarded.

Isabella's eyes flickered with realization.

Her brother had come for her, but she felt no relief.

If Andrew was truly Daniel's mortal enemy - if this vendetta ran deep enough to justify such brutality - then one terrible truth became clear...

Andrew's hands were just as stained as Daniel's.

That horrific night, Isabella had learned far more about Daniel's operations than she ever wanted to know.

Robbery. Surrogacy rings. Human trafficking. Organ harvesting. Every imaginable depravity.

But the most profitable - and most disturbing - was the drug trade.

Isabella stared numbly at the door.

She couldn't forget the criminals who'd kidnapped Alexander and Andrew all those years ago.

Fugitives who'd snatched the boys from their village as bargaining chips.

If Andrew hadn't died that day... if he'd been hiding all this time... did that mean he'd become one of them?

Was that why he'd never come for her? Never even tried to contact her?

"Andrew," she whispered through bloody lips, "what have you become?"
###Chapter 690

The air crackled with tension as Daniel's men formed a rigid perimeter, their weapons trained on a lone figure.

Andrew stood motionless in his black tactical gear, his glacial stare cutting through the armed circle like a blade. The sheer intensity of his presence made the surrounding men shift uneasily, despite their numerical advantage.

Two bodies lay sprawled nearby, their blood seeping into the concrete. Their vacant eyes held the same stunned disbelief—caught mid-thought when death claimed them.

The sight of their fallen comrades ignited fresh fury in the remaining men. These weren't just hired guns—they were brothers who had bled together. Now, their collective rage focused on Andrew like predators scenting blood.

Daniel arrived, his face twisting with fury at the carnage.

"You think you can just waltz in here and start killing my men?" His voice trembled with barely contained rage. "You've got a death wish, Morgan."

Andrew's sharp features mirrored Isabella's, but where her eyes held warmth, his were twin pools of frozen darkness.

"Where is she?" His voice was deceptively calm, the quiet before the storm.

Daniel barked a laugh. "After all these years hiding in the shadows, now you suddenly care?" His lips curled into a vicious smirk. "Beg. On your knees. Maybe then I'll consider letting you see her."

A chorus of mocking laughter rose from his men. To them, Andrew was already a dead man walking.

Andrew's expression didn't flicker. "Bring her out first. Then we'll discuss terms."

Daniel's grin widened. "You're in no position to negotiate. My surgeons worked through the night—we took one of her kidneys. She's—"

A muscle twitched in Andrew's jaw. "Say that again." The ice in his voice could have frozen hell.

"What's wrong?" Daniel taunted. "Not so tough when it's your sister bleeding out, huh? You've spent years destroying my operations, killing my men without remorse. Now you finally understand real pain."

Andrew's hand moved toward his waist.

Daniel's eyes sharpened. "Try it. I dare you. But remember—your sister dies the second you pull that trigger." He gestured sharply. "Drop it. Now."

A dozen weapons clicked in response.

The standoff stretched, seconds feeling like hours.

Finally, for Isabella's sake, Andrew relented. He removed the pistol and kicked it across the concrete.

Daniel snatched it up, inspecting the weapon with satisfaction before nodding to a subordinate. "Bring her out. Let him see what his stubbornness cost her."

Minutes later, a gaunt figure was dragged into view.

Isabella moved like a broken marionette, her pallor ghostly against the dark stains on her hospital gown. Her once-vibrant eyes were swollen slits, the whites blood-red from endless tears.

When her captor released her, she collapsed like a sack of bones, coughing blood onto the pavement.

Andrew's composure shattered. "Isabella!"

She stirred weakly at the sound of her name, but couldn't lift her head.

"Happy reunion?" Daniel sneered, pressing Andrew's own gun to Isabella's temple. "Beg for her life. Or watch her brains paint the pavement."

Andrew ignored him, his voice breaking. "It's me—Andrew. Your brother."

Recognition flickered in Isabella's dull eyes. She tried to focus, but sixteen years had sculpted the boy she remembered into a stranger. Exhaustion won, and her eyelids fluttered shut.

Guilt ravaged Andrew. His protection had failed her.

He stepped forward—

"Move again and I splatter her skull!" Daniel snarled, finger tightening on the trigger.

Andrew's lips curved into a chilling smile. "You're the one who should be worried."

Daniel's gaze darted to the warehouse perimeter—and froze.

Andrew's men had silently surrounded the compound, their rifles sighted on every hostile.

"You bastard!" Daniel spat, swinging the gun toward Andrew.

The shot rang out as Andrew lunged for Isabella.
###Chapter 691

The gunshot shattered the silence.

Daniel Foster never missed his mark.

Andrew Morgan twisted mid-air, his body slamming against the concrete as the bullet whizzed past his ear. Years of living in the shadows had sharpened his instincts to razor precision.

"Damn it!" Daniel snarled, reloading with practiced efficiency.

He raised the gun again, but before he could pull the trigger, the warehouse doors burst open. Andrew’s men stormed in, guns blazing.

The abandoned factory erupted into chaos. Fists flew, metal clashed, and gunfire echoed off the rusted walls. Blood splattered across the cracked floor as both sides fought with brutal desperation.

Andrew seized the moment. He lunged toward Isabella Morgan, dropping to his knees beside her motionless form.

"Isabella! Open your eyes!" His voice cracked with raw panic.

Her skin was deathly pale, her breathing shallow. The deep gash on her side bled freely, staining his hands crimson.

"You’re going to be okay," he choked out. "I’ll get you out of here—just hold on!"

His hands trembled. For the first time in years, fear consumed him. He’d stayed away to protect her, and now she was paying the price.

A shadow loomed behind him.

Daniel swung a steel pipe with vicious force.

The impact sent Andrew sprawling. White-hot pain exploded through his skull as he hit the ground, his vision swimming.

Isabella slipped from his grasp, collapsing back onto the cold concrete.

Daniel smirked. "Did you really think you could save her?" He pressed the barrel of his gun against Andrew’s temple. "Today’s the day you both die."

A sudden commotion erupted outside—frantic barking, shouting.

"Police!" Eric Simmons bellowed, bursting through the door. "They’ve got the place surrounded!"

The fighting ceased instantly. Criminals on both sides froze, their faces paling.

Daniel’s jaw clenched. "Fall back! Use the tunnels!"

But he wasn’t leaving without finishing this.

He fired.

Andrew barely dodged in time. The bullet grazed his shoulder, searing through flesh. He gritted his teeth, blood soaking his sleeve.

The police were closing in. Boots pounded against concrete.

Andrew’s gaze flickered to Isabella. If he took her with him, she’d be dragged into his world.

"I’ll come back for you," he whispered.

Then he bolted toward the nearest window, vaulting through just as officers stormed the room.

Outside, flames erupted—dry hay stacks set ablaze, smoke billowing into the night sky.

Alexander Whitmore led the charge inside, scanning the carnage. His sharp eyes caught the silhouette of a man disappearing into the inferno.

"Did we get them all?" he demanded.

Alvin Chambers shook his head. "Daniel slipped through the back. Had a bike waiting."

Alexander’s gaze lingered on the burning hay.

Someone else had escaped.

And they’d set the fire as a distraction.

Clever.

Too clever.
###Chapter 692

The acrid scent of smoke assaulted Alexander's senses. He turned toward the factory entrance, his face hardening instantly.

Though this abandoned facility stood isolated, it bordered miles of dry woodland.

A single spark could ignite an inferno.

The entire mountain range would become a blazing hellscape.

The devastation would be catastrophic.

Alexander grabbed Officer Chambers' arm. "Get the fire department here now! We're losing control!"

The officer sprinted to his radio without hesitation.

While others scrambled for buckets and extinguishers, Alexander's piercing gaze swept across the warehouse.

He was searching for Isabella.

The kidnappers lay handcuffed on the concrete floor.

But their victim had vanished.

No cries for help. No traces of struggle.

The cavernous space took Alexander five agonizing minutes to search completely.

When he kicked open the control room door, the metallic tang of blood hit him first.

Fresh crimson streaks marred the steel table. His stomach twisted. That was Isabella's blood.

The gruesome scene unfolded in his mind.

Her kidney forcibly harvested while she screamed.

Guilt clawed at his throat.

He needed to find her. Needed to know if she still drew breath.

Alvin burst in, coughing. "Alexander! The wind changed direction! Flames are closing in!" Toxic fumes already snaked through broken windows.

Alexander pressed his sleeve to his mouth. "I know! But we haven't—"

"She's not worth dying for! That fire will consume this building in minutes!"

Just as Alvin tried dragging him out, a faint movement caught their attention.

"There!" Alvin pointed to a crumpled form near overturned crates.

Alexander lunged forward.

His hands shook when they made contact.

Her skin felt like marble in winter.

Isabella lay motionless, her pallor ghostly.

Fingers trembling, Alexander found the faint flutter beneath her jaw.

The weak pulse nearly buckled his knees.

Even hardened Officer Chambers recoiled at the brutality.

No criminal case had prepared him for this savagery.

Isabella needed a hospital. Now.

Alexander cradled her broken body and ran.

The jostling roused her slightly. Eyelids fluttered against the blinding light.

"Alexander..." she whispered through cracked lips.

"I've got you. Stay awake. Just hold on a little longer."

Behind them, Alvin organized the evacuation. "Take her! I'll secure the scene!"

The police cruiser's engine roared to life.

Hidden among the trees, Andrew exhaled shakily.

Seeing Isabella safe should have brought relief.

Instead, bile rose in his throat.

Half his men were in custody.

The trap had sprung perfectly.

All because he'd rushed in blindly.

The Alexander he'd known as a starving boy was gone.

In his place stood a ruthless adversary.

Sunlight dappled through the leaves as the police car sped away.

Andrew melted deeper into the shadows.

His skull throbbed from Daniel's earlier blow.

Every step sent fresh pain radiating through his body.

But he couldn't stop.

Not until he disappeared into the wilderness.

Isabella's skin felt like ice.

Alexander cranked the heat to maximum.

Her blood-soaked clothes had fused to her wounds.

The contrast against her waxen complexion turned his stomach.

He wrapped his coat around her fragile frame.

"Isabella, look at me." He tapped her cheek gently. "Daniel will kill me if I let anything happen to you."

At her brother's name, her lashes fluttered.

"Alexander... my brother... he's..."

Her whisper faded into silence.

She hadn't eaten in thirty-six hours.

Hadn't slept.

Hadn't stopped bleeding since the miscarriage.

Every syllable cost her dearly.

Her lips moved soundlessly as darkness claimed her again.
###Chapter 693

Alexander's breath caught when he saw Isabella's chapped lips. His hands moved swiftly, retrieving a water bottle from his jacket pocket.

He poured a careful trickle onto his fingers, dabbing the moisture onto her parched lips. The sterile scent of antiseptic filled the air as he wiped dried blood from her forehead with a damp tissue. Memories of last night flooded back - Isabella's desperate pleas echoing through the warehouse as Daniel Foster's men circled her.

A crimson trail had dried beneath her left eye, giving her face a shattered porcelain appearance. The blood had crusted her lashes together, making every blink a struggle.

"I don't think I'll survive this," Isabella whispered, each word laced with agony.

Her entire body screamed in protest as another tear carved a path through the grime on her cheek.

"Alexander...I'm sorry for being such a weight around your neck all these years."

Alexander's stern expression fractured momentarily, revealing the grief beneath. "Stop talking nonsense. You're tougher than this." Having known Isabella since childhood, seeing her broken form on the concrete floor twisted something inside him.

Isabella's lips parted as if to speak, but exhaustion won the battle.

Her eyelids fluttered shut, seeking refuge in darkness.

Alexander's jaw tightened. He couldn't let her slip away. With a firm shake, he roused her again.

"Isabella, listen. Evelyn delivered last night. She's at Cresthaven General now. I'm a father."

He kept talking, hoping the revelation would anchor her to consciousness.

"But there were complications. Evelyn was in an accident. The baby came early - they're both in critical care." The words tasted like ash in his mouth.

Isabella's eyes snapped open, realization dawning.

"Evelyn was in an accident?"

Her mind raced. "So Alexander left her side...for me?"

Alexander's voice cracked. "Do you think Evelyn will ever forgive me for not being there? When she needed me most?"

He ran a trembling hand through his disheveled hair. "But I couldn't abandon you. Not after everything. When I got the call about your kidnapping, I had to come."

Dark circles framed Alexander's bloodshot eyes, testament to his sleepless vigil. The stubble shadowing his jaw made him look years older.

"I owe Andrew everything. That's why I've watched over you all these years." His grip tightened on her shoulder. "Isabella, you've always been like a sister to me. Can't you stop these reckless stunts?"

Isabella stared at him, the truth of his words settling like stones in her stomach.

"Reckless?" The irony burned. "Yes, if I hadn't been so reckless, I wouldn't have gotten kidnapped and lost a kidney."

The realization hit her like a physical blow. She'd clung to Alexander's attention like a lifeline, terrified of being forgotten in the shadow of his new life with Evelyn.

But now, as he knelt beside her in this filthy warehouse, risking everything, she understood the depth of his loyalty. Even if she stopped her dramatic antics, Alexander would never truly abandon her.

For the first time, shame washed over her. She thought of Evelyn lying in a hospital bed and knew she owed her more than she could ever repay.

As consciousness began to slip again, Alexander's urgent voice pulled her back.

"Isabella!" His palm connected lightly with her cheek. "Stay awake. If Evelyn misunderstands my absence, I'll need you to explain everything to her."

His voice dropped to a raw whisper. "If you die on me today, I swear I'll never forgive you."

XXXXX

At Cresthaven General, Evelyn stirred beneath crisp hospital sheets. The deep, dreamless sleep left her disoriented, her body protesting every slight movement.

A dull ache radiated from her abdomen - the aftermath of emergency surgery. Fragmented memories surfaced: screeching tires, blinding headlights, then the sterile glare of operating lights before darkness claimed her.

Her hand drifted to her flattened stomach. The baby was gone - delivered.

Panic surged as she turned toward the empty bassinet beside her bed. "Where's my baby?" The unspoken fear choked her - had the accident harmed her child?

A gentle voice interrupted her spiraling thoughts. "Mrs. Whitmore, you're awake."

A middle-aged woman with kind eyes approached, introducing herself as Giselle Cortez, the caregiver Alexander had arranged. "You have a beautiful baby boy. He's in the NICU for observation - just standard procedure for preemies."

The clinical explanation should have comforted her, but Evelyn's gaze kept darting to the vacant chair beside her bed.

"Where's Alexander?" Her voice sounded foreign to her own ears.

Giselle hesitated. "Mr. Whitmore was called away on urgent business."

Evelyn's heart constricted. Only one thing would pull Alexander away now - Isabella.

The realization settled like a lead weight. While she'd been fighting for her life and their child's, Alexander had chosen Isabella. Again.

Tears pricked her eyes as she confronted the painful truth: in Alexander's hierarchy of priorities, she would always come second.

"Dominic," she suddenly gasped, memories of the accident flooding back. "Where's Dominic Powell? He was hurt trying to protect me."

Giselle looked blank. "I'm sorry, I don't know anyone by that name."

Evelyn's pulse spiked. Dominic had been bleeding profusely when paramedics arrived. If he'd died saving her...

"Get me a wheelchair. Now." Pain lanced through her abdomen as she attempted to sit up.

"Mrs. Whitmore, you mustn't! You've just had major surgery—"

"I said now!" The command left no room for argument.

Giselle hurried out, returning moments later with a wheelchair. Every movement sent fire through Evelyn's stitches as she was helped into the chair.

The moment they exited the room, Simon Graves nearly collided with them. Alexander's assistant had been pacing the hallway, his usually impeccable suit wrinkled from hours of waiting.

"Mrs. Whitmore!" His eyes widened at the sight of her in the wheelchair. "You shouldn't be up—"

"Where's Dominic Powell? Which room is he in?" Evelyn demanded, her voice steel wrapped in velvet.
###Chapter 694

Simon hadn't anticipated that Evelyn, fresh from childbirth, would be more concerned about seeing Dominic than her own newborn.

He hesitated before speaking. "Mr. Powell's surgery is complete. He should be resting in his room now."

Dominic had endured an extensive procedure the previous day.

The car accident had left him with severe internal bleeding, requiring two blood transfusions. Multiple organs had sustained damage of varying degrees.

The crash had been brutal. Worse, Dominic hadn't remained still after impact—his movements had exacerbated his injuries.

The doctors called his survival a miracle.

But surviving surgery was only the first hurdle. Recovery would be the true test.

Before the operation, he had been in critical condition. Though the surgery had been successful, the medical team couldn't predict when—or if—he would wake up.

When the wheelchair stopped outside Dominic's hospital room, Evelyn froze, gripped by sudden dread.

She lingered at the threshold, unable to bring herself to enter.

How could she face him? Guilt twisted inside her. The thought of seeing him broken because of her made her stomach churn.

The noise outside caught Nathaniel's attention. He opened the door and stepped into the hallway.

His eyes widened at the sight of Evelyn. "Mrs. Whitmore... you're here to see Mr. Powell?"

Since Dominic's accident, not a single member of the Powell family had bothered to visit.

They didn't care whether he lived or died. Not even a token gesture of concern.

Nathaniel knew Evelyn had just given birth—she should be resting. Her presence here moved him.

At least someone genuinely cared about Dominic.

He was certain Dominic would be overjoyed when he found out.

"How is he?" Evelyn asked.

Nathaniel hesitated, uncertain how to answer.

Taking the wheelchair from Giselle, he guided Evelyn inside. "See for yourself."

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled the air.

Dominic lay deathly pale on the bed, his eyes shut tight.

The room was stark, the coldness almost biting.

Evelyn instinctively hunched her shoulders.

Seeing the once defiant man now so fragile made her chest ache.

If he hadn't shielded her during the crash, he wouldn't be lying here like this.

"Mrs. Whitmore..." Nathaniel began.

Since the accident, he had been keeping vigil alone. With Evelyn here, he finally had someone to confide in.

"Mr. Powell's injuries are severe. The doctors said his quality of life may never be the same."

Evelyn reached out, lightly brushing her fingers against Dominic's wrist.

Her frown deepened as she assessed his condition.

His internal organs were still bleeding in places. Though the surgery had stabilized him, his spleen was ruptured.

The medical team had opted for conservative treatment—stopping the bleeding—but full recovery would take months, if not longer.

A lump formed in Evelyn's throat.

Dominic had always been so full of life. Now, his skin felt cold beneath her touch.

She carefully tucked his hand back under the blanket.

Nathaniel spoke again. "Damian was behind everything. He was arrested yesterday, but... I heard he took his own life in custody."

He paused, noticing the tears streaking Evelyn's cheeks. "Mrs. Whitmore, are you—you shouldn't cry. Not after giving birth."

He fumbled for a tissue, handing it to her awkwardly. Comforting women wasn't his forte.

Evelyn dabbed at her eyes, forcing down the tightness in her throat.

Her tears came from a storm of emotions.

Alexander hadn't spared her a second thought, yet this reckless fool had thrown himself in harm's way to protect her.

The realization that Alexander hadn't even visited since the accident cut deep.

Even Nathaniel, who barely knew her, understood that a postpartum woman shouldn't be crying.

But Alexander? He hadn't even shown his face.

"Damian killed himself? He's dead?" Evelyn asked.

Nathaniel nodded.

Something didn't sit right with Evelyn.

A man as ruthless and self-serving as Damian—who had even betrayed his own foster sister for profit—wasn't the type to succumb to guilt. "How?" she pressed.

"Asphyxiation. They say he strangled himself in his cell."

Evelyn's suspicion grew.

"I need to step out for a moment. I'll be back soon," she said.

She needed to retrieve her medical acupuncture kit.

Perhaps it could help rouse Dominic faster.

When Evelyn exited the room, Simon immediately approached. "Mrs. Whitmore, are you returning to rest?"

She met his gaze. "Damian is dead?"

Simon nodded.

"Did Alexander have him killed?"

Damian had committed countless crimes and tried to harm her multiple times. He deserved death.

But suicide? Too convenient.

If Alexander had orchestrated this, maybe he still cared.

Simon pressed his lips together.

This wasn't a conversation he wanted to have. He wasn't sure what Evelyn was implying.

Worried about tarnishing Alexander's image, he deflected. "Mrs. Whitmore, you haven't eaten. You should rest. When Mr. Whitmore returns, he'll explain everything."

"Wait for him?" Evelyn's laugh was brittle. "Tell me, when will that be?"

Simon had no answer.

Evelyn's voice turned icy. "You don't even know when he'll return, yet you expect me to wait? Why is it always me waiting? Who does he think he is?"

Simon recognized this as pure frustration.

But he genuinely didn't know Alexander's whereabouts.

Last night, after Simon left, Alexander had sent a message saying he had a lead on Isabella and was going after her.

He'd instructed Simon to arrange proper care for Evelyn.

Simon had complied.

But he hadn't pried into Isabella's situation.

Now, with noon approaching and Alexander still absent, Simon understood Evelyn's anger.

Any woman would be hurt in her position—giving birth without her husband present.

Still, Simon trusted Alexander had his reasons.

"Mrs. Whitmore, if you'd like, I can call him—ask when he'll return," he offered.

"Don't bother." Evelyn's gaze could have frozen hell. "I don't want to see him. Whether he comes back or not means nothing to me now."

It was pathetic—relying on an assistant to track down her own husband.

She refused to be that woman. The one who waited, powerless, for scraps of attention.

"Mrs. Whitmore..." Simon began.

This quiet fury was worse than shouting. At least with an argument, emotions could be vented and resolved.

But this? He had no idea what Evelyn was thinking—or planning.

Evelyn said nothing more. With a gesture, she signaled Giselle to wheel her away.

Simon's unease spiked. He immediately pulled out his phone to call Alexander.

The line went straight to voicemail.
###Chapter 695

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the hospital windows as Evelyn Carter gathered her acupuncture supplies. She winced slightly as she stood, the pain from her C-section incision sharp but bearable.

Giselle Cortez rushed forward, concern etching her features. "Mrs. Whitmore, you should be resting! Your body needs time to heal after surgery."

Evelyn knew the risks. But Dominic Powell lay unconscious in the ICU, his condition critical. The doctors had given their grim prognosis - if he didn't wake within 24 hours, the consequences could be permanent.

She couldn't just wait.

"I have to do this," Evelyn insisted, clutching the medical kit to her chest.

A knock interrupted them.

Richard and Margaret Hayes stood at the door, their faces lined with worry. They'd only learned of Evelyn's accident that morning when Margaret overheard hospital staff discussing it.

"Evelyn! Are you alright?" Margaret's gaze darted around the room. "Why didn't you tell us? And the baby - is it a boy or girl? Is everything okay?"

"It's a boy," Evelyn replied softly. "In the NICU. I haven't seen him yet." The words tasted bitter. She should be holding her newborn, not fighting for her life - and Dominic's.

Richard's brow furrowed. "How did this happen?"

"Damian Cross." Evelyn met her father's gaze directly. "But someone paid him. Who keeps trying to kill me, Dad?"

Richard's expression darkened. "Damian was always trouble. This is probably revenge for putting him in prison. It has nothing to do with Vanessa! She's pregnant, bedridden - how could she possibly-"

"I never mentioned Vanessa," Evelyn cut in coldly. "Interesting that you went there first."

Richard froze, realizing his mistake.

Margaret shot him a warning look.

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "I'd love to get along with my stepsister. So tell me - why does she want me dead so badly?"

Damian's sudden death in prison had been suspiciously convenient. Without him, the trail went cold.

"Where's Alexander?" Margaret changed the subject. "Surely Titan Capital isn't more important than his child's birth?"

Evelyn's grip tightened on the acupuncture kit. "He's... occupied."

Margaret pressed, "With what?"

"I don't know!" Evelyn snapped. "Ask him yourself!"

Richard seized the opportunity. "I saw Vanessa this morning. Ethan never left her side. What's really going on between you and Alexander? Why hasn't he been around?"

Each word was a knife twist.

"Maybe if you weren't so stubborn," Richard continued, oblivious to his daughter's pain. "Marrying Alexander was the best thing that ever happened to you. You should-"

The water glass shattered at Richard's feet.

"Are you here to check on me or berate me?" Evelyn's voice shook. "I just survived an accident, had emergency surgery, and you come to tell me it's my fault my husband abandoned me?"

Tears threatened, but she refused to let them fall.

Margaret gasped. "Alexander left you for someone else?"

Evelyn turned away. "I have more important things to do than listen to this."

As she reached the door, Margaret called after her, "Oliver heard about the baby! He's booking a flight home to see his nephew!"

Evelyn didn't look back. Every step sent pain shooting through her abdomen, but she pushed forward. Dominic needed her. That was all that mattered now.
###Chapter 696

Evelyn's heart ached from Richard's harsh words. Without another glance at him or Vanessa, she turned on her heel and strode out of the hospital room.

Vanessa bit her tongue, afraid any further remarks would turn Evelyn's resentment toward her as well. Instead, she redirected her anger at Richard.

"What were you thinking? Evelyn just survived a car crash and gave birth! She's done more for the Whitmore family than anyone! If Alexander isn’t here, that’s his fault—not hers! How could you blame her?" Margaret scolded, her voice sharp with frustration.

She feared the fragile peace they had recently established with Evelyn might shatter because of Richard's careless words.

Richard didn’t dare argue.

Under Margaret’s furious glare, he lowered his head in silent admission.

"I just wanted her to maintain a good relationship with Alexander. Let’s be honest—marrying into the Whitmore family is a huge advantage for us," Richard muttered defensively.

"Advantage?" Margaret scoffed. "Marriage isn’t a business transaction! You can’t treat our daughter like some bargaining chip. Would you have said the same if this were Vanessa?"

Richard fell silent.

Margaret jabbed a finger at his chest. "You’re unbelievable! Evelyn has suffered enough, and as her father, you should be supporting her, not tearing her down!"

Guilt twisted in Margaret’s chest as she thought of everything Evelyn had endured.

Richard didn’t want to hear more but held his tongue.

Instead, he changed the subject. "Something’s wrong between her and Alexander. Did you see how she reacted when I mentioned him? Do you think their marriage is falling apart?"

Margaret shot him a withering glare. "She just gave birth, and her husband is nowhere to be found. Of course she’s upset! Alexander is the one who should be ashamed!"

Just then, Richard’s phone buzzed.

Vanessa.

"Vanessa? What’s wrong? Alright, we’re already at the hospital. We’ll be right there," Richard said quickly before hanging up.

He grabbed Margaret’s arm, pulling her along.

"What now?" Margaret demanded.

"Vanessa’s in terrible pain. The fall last night dislocated her pelvis. The doctors say they can treat her, but she’d have to terminate the pregnancy. If she wants to keep the baby, she’ll have to endure it," Richard explained.

Margaret’s frown deepened. "And what exactly can we do about that?"

"Eleanor won’t allow an early delivery—says it’s too risky for the baby. Vanessa’s begging us to intervene," Richard replied.

Vanessa was suffering, but she wasn’t even eight months along. Eleanor refused to risk the baby’s life by inducing labor prematurely.

To protect the child, the doctors had also withheld strong painkillers.

"We’re her parents. Who else can she turn to?" Richard pressed.

Margaret’s expression turned icy.

"Oh, now we’re her parents? Richard, your hypocrisy is astounding. You’ve never shown this much concern for Evelyn! She’s been through hell, and you’ve never once stood up for her. Unbelievable!"

Evelyn stepped into Dominic’s hospital room. Unpacking her acupuncture kit, she asked, "Any changes while I was gone?"

Nathaniel shook his head. "Nothing. He hasn’t moved at all."

Evelyn nodded. "Help me remove his shirt."

Nathaniel quickly unbuttoned Dominic’s hospital gown, knowing what came next.

But as Evelyn approached, she froze.

Dominic’s torso was a map of scars.

Some were old, faded into pale lines against his skin. Others were fresh, angry red wounds still healing.

She inhaled sharply. She hadn’t expected his body to carry so much damage.

Nathaniel sighed. "Mr. Powell’s had a rough few years. Most of these scars are from enemies seeking revenge for his family’s business."

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Couldn’t he just walk away?"

The Powell family’s dealings were murky. Though they’d gone legitimate years ago, their past still clung to them.

Nathaniel hesitated. "Mrs. Whitmore… the Powell family’s affairs are complicated. You’ll understand in time. Mr. Powell doesn’t have much choice."

Evelyn didn’t push further.

She stepped closer and began the treatment, her hands steady.

Nathaniel watched nervously, eyeing Dominic’s condition.

Worried Evelyn might still be weak from childbirth, he suggested she sit.

Half an hour later, she finished.

But despite the session, Dominic remained still.

Nathaniel paled, his eyes reddening. "Mrs. Whitmore… do you think he might not wake up?"

Evelyn frowned. "This is supplemental treatment. It may take multiple sessions."

Just then, Dominic’s lashes fluttered.

"Mr. Powell!" Nathaniel gasped, unsure if he imagined it.

Then Dominic’s fingers twitched.

Nathaniel nearly sobbed in relief. "You scared me half to death! I thought you’d never wake up!"

Dominic’s eyes opened.

His face was pale, his usually sharp gaze unfocused. The injuries had taken their toll.

Relief washed over Evelyn.

She held up two fingers. "Dominic, how many fingers am I holding up?"

"One," he rasped.

Her stomach dropped.

She tried again, raising five fingers. "Now?"

"Nine," he answered.

Her heart sank further.

She reached for his wrist, checking his pulse.

This doesn’t make sense. His injuries were internal. His vision shouldn’t be affected.

Did the crash damage his eyes? His brain?

Just as her fingers brushed his skin, Dominic suddenly grabbed her hand.

Startled, she glared. "Don’t joke around. Your condition is serious—"

His voice was rough but teasing. "I can see fine. Just messing with you."

He cut her off, his grip tightening slightly. "Sit. Stay with me."

Evelyn hesitated. "You’re sure you’re not brain-damaged?"

Dominic’s gaze sharpened, a smirk playing on his lips. "You’re worried about me."

She scowled. "Of course I am. You got hurt because of—"

Her eyes dropped to his wrist. "Let go. I need to examine you."

Their eyes locked. Dominic grinned. "If you wanted to hold my hand, you could’ve just asked. Did saving you make me irresistible?"

Evelyn stared, speechless.

Even half-dead, he had the energy to tease.

His hospital gown hung loosely, exposing his collarbones. He looked fragile, yet his smirk was as infuriating as ever.

His gaze lingered on her face. "You tried so hard to push me away, and now here you are, fussing over me. Tell me—if I never woke up, would you have regretted it? Cried for me?"

She rolled her eyes. "You’ve got quite the imagination."

"Of course," Dominic chuckled, voice low. "I’ve imagined plenty with you."
###Chapter 697

The surgeon's face was grim as he stepped out of the operating room. "The patient is in critical condition," he said, his voice low with urgency. "One of her kidneys was violently extracted. The crude procedure she endured has left her at high risk for septic shock."

His words grew heavier. "The loss of that organ could trigger systemic failure. If her condition deteriorates further, we may face multiple organ shutdown."

A pause. Then, quieter: "She also shows no will to fight. That mental state complicates everything."

When they had wheeled Evelyn in, she had been barely conscious, unresponsive even when Alexander called her name.

They had rushed her straight into emergency surgery.

Now, the surgeon's expression told Alexander everything he didn't want to hear. Evelyn's chances were slim.

Alexander had spent the entire night at the hospital with Claire, only to race to that abandoned warehouse at dawn. By the time he got Evelyn to the ER, the sun was already high. Exhaustion carved deep lines into his face, his eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep.

He clenched his fists. Medicine wasn't his expertise. All he could do was trust the doctors.

"Save her," he demanded, voice rough. "Whatever it takes."

The surgeon nodded. "We're doing everything possible, but she's lost too much blood. We've already transfused three units." He held out a clipboard. "This is a critical condition consent form. You need to sign."

Alexander's jaw tightened as he scrawled his name.

Alone in the hallway, his thoughts spiraled.

He reached for his phone to call Claire—only to find it dead.

Too much had happened in twenty-four hours. No rest. No pause. Now, a splitting headache pulsed behind his temples.

In their panic, they'd taken Evelyn to the nearest hospital, not the one where Claire had given birth.

Thirteen miles apart.

Alexander borrowed a charger, jamming the cord into his phone. He needed to check on Claire.

—

The moment it powered on, he dialed.

A robotic voice answered instead of Claire.

His stomach dropped.

She had blocked him.

His frown deepened. He understood her anger—but cutting off contact entirely? No chance to explain?

He called Simon immediately.

Simon answered on the first ring. "Mr. Whitmore? Is everything handled? Mrs. Whitmore is... not pleased." Having a girlfriend himself, Simon understood perfectly.

If emotional blunders were ranked, Alexander had committed a Category 10 disaster.

"How is Claire?" Alexander's voice was strained. "Is she alright? Her mood? Her health?"

Simon hesitated. "She woke up, ate a little. Superficial injuries from the crash, nothing severe."

"Put her on."

A beat of silence. Then, awkwardly: "She's not here, sir."

Alexander's grip tightened on the phone. "She just delivered a baby. Why isn't she resting? Where is she?"

Simon cleared his throat. "She went to see Mr. Bennett. He's still unconscious. She's... concerned."

Alexander froze.

Claire was with Lucas?

A dark emotion coiled in his chest. "How long?"

"Nearly an hour. This is her second visit today."

Alexander's expression turned stormy.

Claire, fresh from childbirth, running to Lucas's bedside—twice?

Yes, Lucas had saved her. But was this level of concern necessary?

The thought made his blood simmer.

Simon added carefully, "She also asked if Damian's death was connected to you. I didn't answer. I worried the truth might... change how she sees you."

Alexander had built his reputation on integrity—spotless since his academy days.

But for Claire, he'd crossed lines. Ensured Damian's death behind bars.

A life-for-a-life matter. Simon wouldn't dare speak out of turn, not when it could shatter Claire's trust.

Alexander didn't blame him. He'd never wanted Claire to know.

Damian had targeted her one too many times. Alexander had reached his limit.

That decision was his burden as her husband.

Simon's voice cut through his thoughts. "Sir, when will you return?"

Alexander exhaled. "Evelyn lost a kidney."

Silence. Then a sharp inhale. Simon hadn't expected such brutality.

"She's still in surgery," Alexander continued. "Critical condition notice just issued."

As Evelyn's only legal guardian, he couldn't leave.

The doctors had warned—anything could happen before the operation ended.

He had to stay.

They'd said Evelyn's abdomen was flooded with blood. The butchers who took her kidney had botched the job so badly she was barely clinging to life. Specialists had been summoned, scrambling to save her.

Alexander couldn't erase the image of Evelyn's pallid face as they wheeled her away.

The color of death.

Simon understood. "I'll try to explain to Mrs. Whitmore."

—

The call ended just as the OR doors burst open.

A nurse sprinted out. "We're out of matching blood! We need donors now!"

Alexander rolled up his sleeve. "Take mine. We're the same type."

He followed her without hesitation.

Meanwhile, across town, an elevator dinged.

Claire stepped out, face unreadable.

Simon, still holding his phone, hurried over. "Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Whitmore just called—"

He stopped. The line was dead.

Claire walked past him without a word, acupuncture kit in hand. She returned to her room, collapsing onto the bed, utterly drained.

Simon sighed. Her anger was palpable—she wouldn't even acknowledge Alexander's name.

He knocked gently. "Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Whitmore wanted you to know—Ms. Morgan's condition is dire. Someone took her kidney. She's in surgery now."
###Chapter 698

Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered as consciousness returned.

She opened her eyes slowly, the harsh hospital lights making her blink.

The news about Isabella's kidney theft sent shockwaves through her.

"What kind of monsters would do this?" she wondered. "How can anyone be so cruel?"

Yet within moments, she steadied her breathing.

"Isabella's suffering is tragic," she thought, "but haven't I endured my own nightmare?"

Isabella lost an organ. Evelyn had survived a horrific car crash while pregnant.

Her life and baby's had hung in the balance. Yet Alexander, her husband, remained absent since the birth.

A bitter taste filled Evelyn's mouth. It seemed their lives mattered less than Isabella's.

The clock's ticking reminded her - nearly twenty-four hours had passed.

She'd given him that time.

Now time was up.

The door burst open as Claire rushed in.

Seeing Evelyn, Claire enveloped her in a fierce embrace, tears threatening to spill.

"Evelyn! Why didn't you call me? My heart stopped when I heard about the accident!" Claire's voice trembled.

She'd raced to the hospital upon hearing the news.

Evelyn's pallor made Claire's chest tighten. "Where are you injured?"

"My lower back," Evelyn admitted.

"Let me see." Claire secured the door before lifting the hospital gown.

Her breath caught.

An angry purple bruise marred Evelyn's spine area - dangerously close to paralysis territory. Evelyn had been silently enduring excruciating pain with every movement.

"This is severe! What did the doctors say?" Claire's face mirrored her concern.

"Internal bruising. Mobility will be limited for weeks." Evelyn knew from experience this injury might leave lasting effects.

Had Dominic not shielded her during impact, neither she nor the baby might have survived.

Her gaze dropped, emotions swirling.

Noticing her friend's distress, Claire asked the inevitable: "Where's Alexander?" This constant question only deepened Evelyn's resentment.

"Isabella was kidnapped. They took her kidney. She's likely still in surgery. Alexander's with her."

Silence fell between them.

Evelyn turned to Claire. "Tell me honestly - if I'm angry at Alexander now, am I being unreasonable? Isabella's fighting for her life while I'm upset about my feelings. Does that make me selfish?"

Claire cut her off sharply. "You're his wife. You should be his priority. You deserve his attention."

"Isabella's suffering isn't your burden to carry. Her pain isn't your fault."

"You were pregnant, Evelyn. You survived a horrific crash. That's miraculous."

"Imagine if Dominic hadn't been there? Your situation is equally critical."

"Evelyn, you're too kind. As your best friend, I need you to remember - don't let others' warped perspectives make you doubt yourself."

"Alexander's place is beside you and your newborn. Everything else comes second."

"You're a mother now. You must put yourself first to protect your child."

Evelyn sat stunned. Claire's words struck like lightning, clearing her mental fog.

She hadn't expected such wisdom from her usually carefree friend.

The truth resonated - Alexander had chosen Isabella.

"Thank you," Evelyn whispered.

Claire grinned, plucking a ruby-red apple from the basket. "Want one? I'll even peel it - a rare honor."

She stayed to keep Evelyn company, fearing dark thoughts might creep in.

Her peeling skills were amateurish, but the fruit tasted sweet.

Evelyn smiled between bites. "Claire, you're incredible. If I were a man, I'd marry you."

Claire winked dramatically. "Is this a confession? I've been meaning to tell you - I prefer women. Let's spend our lives together."

Laughter bubbled up, dispersing Evelyn's gloom.

"Stop! Laughing hurts my stitches." She touched her abdomen, knowing Claire's antics were intentional.

The room warmed with companionship. After dinner, Claire stayed until Evelyn slept before slipping out.

Silence returned like an unwelcome guest.

With Claire gone, loneliness crept back in.

Not seeing her baby hurt most.

The doctors had told Claire visiting wasn't permitted yet.

Simon had gone home to rest, leaving two guards outside.

Exhausted yet restless, Evelyn threw on a robe to walk.

The guards blocked her exit.

"Am I a prisoner?" she asked, bewildered.

"Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Whitmore worries for your safety. It's late, and you've just delivered -"

Evelyn's cold laugh cut him off. "Suddenly he cares?"

"If he truly cared, he'd be here."

The guards exchanged uneasy glances before reluctantly stepping aside.

Evelyn clutched her aching back, taking one painful step forward.

The elevator doors slid open.

Alexander emerged.
###Chapter 699

Talk of the wolf and he's at the door. Yet Alexander's sudden appearance didn't bring Evelyn the comfort she expected. He'd been absent during the horrific accident yesterday. Missing when they wheeled her into emergency surgery. Still nowhere to be found when she woke this morning, disoriented and alone. On what should have been their most important day, Alexander had vanished.

She'd imagined telling him everything - the paralyzing fear when metal screeched against metal, Dominic's body shielding hers from the crushing impact, the terror beneath her calm facade as surgeons fought to save their unborn child.

As her husband and the father of her baby, surely he'd understand. But now, with the moment passed and Alexander finally here, the words turned to ash in her mouth.

Perhaps she was overreacting. The injuries weren't life-threatening. Not like Isabella, who'd lost an organ.

Claire had insisted her feelings were valid. Wanting her husband's support wasn't unreasonable. Surviving relatively unharmed was sheer luck, not something to diminish her trauma. Evelyn knew Claire was right.

Alexander stood silhouetted in the doorway, his broad shoulders blocking the fluorescent hallway lights. Streetlamps cast angular shadows across his unshaven jaw. His chest rose and fell rapidly - he'd clearly run here.

Dried blood streaked his rolled-up sleeves. His usually immaculate suit was wrinkled and stained. Red veins webbed through his exhausted eyes. The normally polished Alexander Whitmore looked like he'd been through war.

Their eyes met briefly before Evelyn turned away, retreating toward the hospital bed. She reached to slam the door behind her, but Alexander caught it effortlessly.

"Evelyn," he rasped.

She pushed with all her strength, but against his muscular frame, it was futile. Fine. Not worth the energy.

She turned toward the bed, only for Alexander to suddenly sweep her into his arms. "Alexander!" she gasped.

His voice was gravel. "You should be resting. Just because I wasn't here doesn't mean you stop caring for yourself." His grip tightened. "You're still recovering."

"What's it to you?" she snapped. "Go back to Isabella. Why bother coming at all?"

Alexander adjusted his hold, his expression unreadable. "Stop struggling. You'll tear your stitches." He laid her gently on the crisp sheets. Exhaustion weighed on Evelyn - whether from trauma or postpartum fatigue, her body ached relentlessly.

After tucking the blanket around her, Alexander perched on the bed's edge. "Isabella's stable now. I'm sorry I wasn't here sooner."

Evelyn almost asked if Isabella would survive. Then caught herself - why show concern for someone who'd repeatedly hurt her?

Silence thickened between them. Alexander rose, poured water into a plastic cup. "Thirsty?"

Evelyn turned her face away.

When she refused, Alexander drained the cup himself. She watched his throat work, brow furrowing. Had he been so busy he hadn't drunk anything all day?

Even exhausted, Alexander moved with innate elegance. Some people were born with it. His pallor concerned her - had he been injured fighting off their attackers? She pressed her lips together and shut her eyes.

"Tired?" Alexander smoothed her blanket, tucking a loose curl behind her ear. "Rest if you need to. We'll talk tomorrow."

The room fell silent. Evelyn wasn't sleepy, but kept her eyes closed. She felt Alexander's gaze lingering, watching her with unsettling intensity.

To avoid disturbing her, he killed the lights. Moonlight spilled through the blinds, painting silver stripes across the bed.

Alexander sat vigil for long minutes before gently taking her hand. Had Evelyn looked, she'd have seen the raw emotion in his dark eyes.

A rustle at the door. "Mr. Whitmore?" Simon whispered.

Alexander released her hand. "What is it?"

"Got what you requested." Simon held up a takeout bag.

Alexander accepted it, glancing back at Evelyn - who was now watching him with open eyes. "Did I wake you?" he asked, reentering. "Or were you pretending?"

Evelyn thought, I'm too furious to sleep.

"Hungry?" Alexander lifted the bag. Even in darkness, she could see his outline.

"Not really," Evelyn muttered.

Alexander saw through her instantly. "I'm starving," he declared. "Humor me."

He knew Evelyn needed five small meals daily for recovery.

She'd sent Giselle away earlier - normally compliant, today she'd been stubborn. Angry. Determined not to owe Alexander anything.

But he wouldn't let her go hungry. With that, he disappeared into the suite's kitchenette. VIP rooms came fully equipped.

Evelyn propped herself up. "Is this your apology?" she asked softly.

Alexander's reply came between the sounds of running water. "No. This is my responsibility. What I should have done from the beginning."
###Chapter 700

Evelyn's eyes lingered on the faint pool of light cast by the kitchen lamp onto the tiled floor. The darkness enveloped the room, yet that small glow offered a sliver of comfort. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Is she...alright?"

She was inquiring about Isabella. Alexander froze mid-motion, knife hovering above the cutting board. He'd always known Evelyn possessed kindness, but even now—after everything—her concern for Isabella's condition surprised him.

She could have screamed. She could have thrown objects across the room in a rage. Instead, when he'd entered, she'd chosen to swallow her emotions, shut her eyes, and feign sleep. "What a foolish woman," he thought.

A flicker of guilt passed through Alexander's gaze. His hands moved with practiced ease as he diced vegetables and arranged them neatly on a plate. "She survived the surgery, but remains critical. The ICU now. Her survival depends entirely on her willpower."

He'd only caught a glimpse of Isabella being wheeled from the operating theater—pale as parchment, unconscious, before the medical team whisked her away to intensive care.

Isabella was hooked to countless monitors. Alexander knew the statistics—perhaps two in a hundred ICU patients walked out alive. The rest? Existing in limbo between life and death, sustained only by machines.

Evelyn's breath caught. "Isabella's in intensive care?"

She'd heard horror stories about ICUs—how being conscious there felt worse than death itself. Never knowing when the patient in the next bed would exhale their final breath. And every bed filled with someone in that exact state. "Who would go this far for her kidney? Who's behind it?" Evelyn asked.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Organ trafficking ring. Police interrogations yielded nothing—they're protecting whoever's pulling the strings."

Evelyn fell silent. Alexander added, "Their methods were...exceptionally brutal. The kind reserved for mortal enemies."

That was what baffled Alexander most. "Isabella's just a vulnerable woman. Spent years abroad. What possible grudge could justify this?"

Evelyn said nothing. The sizzle of cooking filled the air, and soon Alexander presented a steaming plate of pasta—not ordinary pasta, but loaded with every nutritious ingredient imaginable.

Crowning it—a perfectly fried egg, edges crisp and golden, enough to make stomachs growl. Alexander arranged the small dining table and handed Evelyn a fork. "Try it. If it's unsatisfactory, I'll prepare another."

As he spoke, he grabbed his own plate—barely a few strands of pasta, completely unlike the hearty meal before Evelyn. For a moment, words failed her.

Only two days since she'd last seen him, yet Alexander looked haggard. His jawline sharper, frame noticeably thinner.

Soon Simon entered with fresh clothes and towels. Once finished eating, Alexander headed straight for the shower, shedding bloodstained garments.

Evelyn heard the razor's hum, then running water. Her gaze drifted to the window. Unshed tears stung. Alexander didn't need to speak—his exhaustion radiated. The deep, soul-crushing kind. When he emerged, clean-shaven in fresh pajamas, he appeared more composed—but the crimson veins in his eyes stood out starkly. Approaching Evelyn, he asked softly, "May I sleep on the bed?"

Evelyn frowned. "Absolutely not."

"Ah." Disappointment flickered across Alexander's face—so brief she might have imagined it. "Then you rest. I'll remain here. I'm not leaving this time." He pulled a chair to her bedside. Evelyn thought, "Is he seriously going to watch me sleep?"

The house was so silent their whispers carried to the doorway where Simon still lingered. "Mrs. Whitmore, Mr. Whitmore kept vigil at your hospital bed all last night. Didn't sleep a wink. At dawn, he rushed off to rescue someone. Another sleepless night might break him."

Simon spoke truth. Alexander's pallor and hollow cheeks screamed of a man pushed beyond limits.

"Why are you still here?" Alexander scowled, clearly irritated by Simon's presence.

"Passionate about my work, sir. Overtime brings me joy. No extra pay required," Simon added hastily.

"Double your bonus. Now leave," Alexander ordered.

Simon's eyes brightened, though he maintained composure. "Of course. I'll ensure you're undisturbed." Evelyn wondered, "Did he truly stay all night?" She couldn't be certain, but Simon wasn't one for deceit.

She glanced at the empty half of the bed. "Perhaps sharing wouldn't be terrible."

"Evelyn, if you're awake, may we talk?" Alexander's gaze held hers steadily.

Evelyn met his eyes. "About what? That you regret abandoning me to save Isabella?"

Alexander's face remained shadowed.

Evelyn continued. "That you wish you'd been there during my accident? Or that given the chance, you'd choose her again every single time?" Alexander replied, "Yes. I would."

Her lips twisted into a bitter smile—as if she'd expected nothing less. "You had reasons. I understand. But each choice for her leaves me behind."

Frustration tightened Alexander's chest.

Evelyn scoffed. "Perhaps you think me unreasonable—angry when her life hung in the balance. Eventually, will I become a burden? Will resentment grow because I couldn't be more understanding?" "Never!" Alexander interjected sharply.

But Evelyn cut him off. "It doesn't matter. I'll never be first, Alexander. That's not something I can accept."

She held his gaze, voice calm yet firm. "Alexander, we're good people. But rather than dragging this marriage until we despise each other, let's end it now—before it's too late."

Alexander had once been everything Evelyn dreamed of—perfect in every way. So perfect she believed marrying him guaranteed happily ever after.

An exceptional man who overlooked her complicated past—even her involvement with her nephew. He'd supported her, provided safety when needed.

But everything shattered when Isabella appeared. Their coupledom became a trio. Alexander, repeatedly drawn to Isabella, grew distant—physically and emotionally. This wasn't the life Evelyn wanted.

Alexander's voice trembled slightly, bloodshot eyes wide with disbelief. "Evelyn, are you suggesting divorce?"

Evelyn nodded. "I warned you before marrying—if we divorced, I'd leave with nothing."

After all, she'd entered this marriage with nothing. He'd given her everything—security, comfort, unlimited credit for household expenses.

Evelyn was genuinely grateful. She retrieved a sleek black card from the drawer. "The card you gave me at our wedding. Barely used. I'm returning it."

Her expression remained calm, voice soft—merely stating facts. She and Alexander had shared beautiful moments. In this marriage, Evelyn had rediscovered long-lost warmth. Experienced his care, his constant championing of her.

She'd loved him deeply. If asked later, Evelyn would say Alexander had been a good husband. Their divorce wasn't because he was bad—simply because they weren't right.

Life was long. Some people only walk part of your journey with you. Someone always disembarks first. That's why Evelyn refused to let their relationship end in ugliness.

Even without the perfect ending, their shared journey held meaning. She'd always be grateful for his protection, support, and care.

Tears glistened in Evelyn's eyes. Her nose burned sharply. She inhaled deeply, summoning every ounce of courage. When she finally spoke, her voice cracked uncontrollably. "I only want custody of our son. Nothing else. Alexander, let's end this. Let's divorce."

###Chapter 701

Evelyn's words struck Alexander like a thunderbolt.

She appeared composed, her face as serene as ever. But beneath that calm exterior, he detected a flicker of pain—subtle, yet undeniable. The moment her voice wavered, his chest tightened, as if an invisible fist had seized his heart.

Evelyn wasn’t one to wear her emotions openly. For her to speak so much at once, to make such a drastic decision—it meant she had reached her limit. And Alexander knew it. That knowledge made the guilt unbearable.

He couldn’t expect her to keep enduring his neglect. Not after everything.

They were trapped in an impossible situation. If Isabella had truly been his sister, things might have been simpler. Evelyn might not have cared so deeply. But she wasn’t.

Alexander despised himself for failing Evelyn when she needed him most. If only he could turn back time, he would have stayed by her side, shielding her from everything. He had been one step too late.

What Dominic had done for her, he could have done too. But that single step—that tiny delay—had widened the chasm between them.

Isabella needed saving. That was his duty, his way of honoring Andrew, his closest friend.

Even without Andrew, Alexander couldn’t have abandoned her. It wasn’t about her being a woman, or who she was. If it had been anyone else, he would have acted the same. It just happened to be Isabella this time.

When he took his oath as an officer, he swore to protect. That was his responsibility—to answer the call, no matter what. Isabella wasn’t special to him. Not in the way Evelyn believed.

In his eyes, Isabella and Evelyn weren’t rivals. There was no competition, no choice between them.

How did things spiral this far?

The room was silent. Alexander’s gaze locked with Evelyn’s, but an invisible gulf stretched between them—vast, unbridgeable.

His eyes flicked to the black card in her hand before he looked away. "I gave it to you. It’s yours. Keep it."

Frustration coiled in his chest. He reached for his cigarettes, then stopped. Evelyn had just given birth. They were in a hospital. His hand fell back to his side.

His eyes were bloodshot, exhaustion etched into every line of his face. The once-confident Alexander now looked weary, burdened.

It felt like he had let the woman he cherished slip through his fingers.

But he had tried so hard, hadn’t he? He had given her everything. A wave of helplessness crashed over him. His throat tightened.

"Do you remember what I said before we married?" He took her hand, cradling it between his. "I told you—we don’t divorce. Ever."

Dressed in dark gray silk pajamas, Alexander looked unusually disheveled. His tired, bloodshot eyes betrayed his turmoil. His voice was rough, scraping against her soul.

"You just gave me a son, and now you want to leave me with him?"

A bitter smile touched his lips. "Evelyn, that’s not fair. If you want to punish me..."

He lifted her hand, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. "At least wait until I’m hopelessly in love with you before you walk away. That would hurt more, wouldn’t it?"

Evelyn bit her lip. "I’m not worth that kind of love. How could you feel that way about me?"

He pressed a finger to her lips. "Don’t say that. You’re everything to me."

She turned her face away, refusing to meet his gaze. Her shoulders trembled slightly. Her eyes were red-rimmed, lashes damp.

She inhaled shakily, steadying herself. "Words are easy. Actions aren’t."

Her fair skin flushed faintly, brows knitting in quiet frustration. "You always leave me behind. What else am I supposed to think?"

Alexander frowned. "I’m not leaving you. I’m—"

"Enough." Evelyn covered her ears, shutting him out. She closed her eyes. "I’m tired. Let’s stop. There’s no point arguing."

She knew Alexander wouldn’t agree to a divorce. She needed time.

In the dim light, he stared at her back. Evelyn was like a whisper—so close, yet slipping through his grasp. He wanted to hold on, but his hand faltered.

Letting go? Impossible.

No one knew better than him what Evelyn meant to him. When you loved someone, you fought for them.

Divorce? Over his dead body.

Alexander sat by her bed, watching her for hours. The night deepened, the world outside growing still. Eventually, Evelyn drifted into sleep.

His eyes burned with exhaustion. Leaning forward, he pressed a kiss to her forehead.

"I’m sorry, Evelyn," he murmured, voice rough. "I never wanted to hurt you."

She lay motionless, eyes closed, as if she hadn’t heard. Outside, the wind howled, scattering leaves across the pavement.

Alexander rose, quietly shutting the window so she wouldn’t feel the chill. He draped his jacket over her blanket. Then, resting his head beside her, he finally slept.

Meanwhile, across town, Victoria Clarke was finishing her late shift at the convenience store. She locked up, preparing to head home.

The wind had sharpened, cutting through her coat. She pulled it tighter. The store was on the outskirts, far from the city’s warmth. The area was always colder, lonelier.

One thought nagged at her—the man hadn’t come for his usual cigarettes today. He was always punctual, like clockwork. But tonight, he hadn’t shown.

Had something happened to him?

The question gnawed at her as she walked, her mind distant.

Then the rain began.

The alley ahead was dim, shadows shifting under flickering streetlights. The wind wailed through the narrow space, rain drumming steadily.

Thankfully, she had an umbrella.

Victoria kept walking—until she spotted something on the ground. A dark stain against the wet pavement.

She crouched, frowning.

Blood.

This part of town was rough. As a cashier, she’d learned to recognize trouble. Most customers were drifters or small-time troublemakers—lost souls renting cheap rooms in the slums.

Her first instinct was to walk away. She straightened, pretending not to see.

But then—

Her breath caught.

A figure slumped in the alley’s corner.

It was him. The man who hadn’t come to the store.

Was he hurt? Was that why he hadn’t shown?
###Chapter 702

Andrew Morgan huddled in the shadows of a crumbling brick wall, his body trembling from blood loss. Crimson stains spread across his gray hoodie, the fabric clinging to his clammy skin that had taken on an eerie pallor in the moonlight.

He'd barely escaped the police raid at the abandoned warehouse, only to find his safehouse compromised. The flashing blue lights reflected in puddles told him all he needed to know - someone in his inner circle had turned traitor.

Every movement sent fresh waves of agony through his body. The gunshot wound from Daniel Foster burned like fire, while the concussion from the earlier blow made his vision swim. The world tilted dangerously as he pressed a shaking hand to his throbbing temple.

With no safe place left, Andrew had no choice but to wait out the night in this filthy alley. He curled tighter into himself, trying to conserve body heat as fever began to cloud his thoughts. The growing pool of blood beneath him told a grim story he couldn't afford to consider.

The sudden crunch of footsteps on gravel made his head snap up. His hand flew to the gun hidden beneath his jacket before he recognized the silhouette. Victoria Clarke stood frozen at the alley's entrance, her shadow stretching toward him like an accusation.

For one charged moment, their eyes locked. Andrew saw the exact second recognition flashed in her gaze - and the carefully constructed mask of innocence that followed.

"You're hurt," Victoria said with convincing concern, stepping closer. The streetlight haloed her blonde hair as she pulled out her phone. "Let me call an ambulance."

Andrew moved faster than she anticipated. One moment her phone was in her hand, the next it sailed through the air to shatter against the pavement. The sound of breaking glass echoed through the narrow space.

"Are you insane?" Victoria stormed toward the wreckage, scooping up the destroyed device. "That was brand new!" She turned on him with impressive fury for someone facing a clearly dangerous man.

Andrew studied her through narrowed eyes. He remembered this woman - the convenience store cashier who always gave him exact change. Too exact. Like she'd been waiting for him.

The fever made it hard to concentrate, but one thought cut through the haze: She knows who I am.

Victoria's performance was flawless - the indignant citizen, the concerned bystander. But Andrew had spent years reading people, and the calculation behind her eyes betrayed her.

"You owe me for this," she declared, waving the broken phone. "Four hundred dollars. Cash."

A laugh tore from Andrew's raw throat despite himself. The audacity. "You're shaking down a bleeding man in an alley?"

Her chin lifted stubbornly. "Justice doesn't take sick days."

The absurdity of the situation struck him. Here he was, possibly dying, being extorted by some petite blonde with more courage than sense. The fever must be worse than he thought, because he found himself oddly charmed by her bravado.

When she reached to steady him, the contact sent an electric jolt through them both. Her fingers brushed his burning skin and recoiled. "Christ, you're on fire!" Her gaze dropped to his blood-soaked sleeve. "My car's nearby. Let me help you."

Every instinct screamed this was a trap. But with the police closing in and his strength fading, Andrew made a calculated decision. He'd play along - for now.

The ride to her apartment passed in a haze of pain. Victoria kept up a steady stream of chatter that he mostly tuned out, focusing instead on memorizing their route and noting potential escape routes.

The apartment surprised him - small but meticulously clean, with personal touches that didn't match the persona she presented at the convenience store. Interesting.

"Take these," she ordered, dumping an assortment of pills on the coffee table. Andrew scanned the labels before dry-swallowing the antibiotics, his paranoia not quite outweighing his need for medication.

When she moved to examine his wound, Andrew reacted on instinct. The gun appeared in his hand before he'd fully decided to draw it, the barrel steady despite his trembling limbs.

"Why work at that store, Victoria?" His voice came out rough as gravel. "Why linger near me?"

Through the reflection in a nearby mirror, he watched her pulse jump in her throat. But to her credit, she didn't panic. Instead, she slowly turned to face him, her expression carefully schooled into confusion.

"I don't know what you're talking about. I just work there."

Andrew cocked the hammer. The click echoed through the silent apartment. "Try again."

The game had begun. And only one of them would walk away alive.
###Chapter 703

Victoria's pulse hammered violently, the sound deafening in her own ears. Adrenaline flooded her system, sharp and merciless. This was terror—the kind that turned your veins to ice; the kind that breathed death in your ear.

She'd always known men like him—ruthless predators who thrived in shadows. But comprehension only struck now. His chilling composure wasn't performance art. If he chose, he could erase her existence without blinking.

"Why can't I work retail?" Victoria fought to keep her voice airy, deliberately injecting confusion into her tone.

She kept her back turned, fussing with the peonies in the crystal vase. "Is it the incongruity? Trust fund girl with a penthouse and Porsche, yet clocking shifts at a bodega?"

Her laugh came out brittle. "Truth is, the Clarke fortune built this life. The kidnapping changed everything." Andrew's gaze sharpened imperceptibly at her revelation. He remained silent, observing as she rearranged stems with trembling fingers. Whatever calculations ran behind those cold eyes, they stayed hidden.

"After the ransom, I became society's favorite punchline. Not a love story—just another dynastic transaction."

She shrugged like the memory didn't sting. "In our circles, once they brand you pathetic, the mark never fades. So I took the graveyard shift. Gave me something to focus on besides the whispers." She turned suddenly, meeting his gaze. "Is a heiress stocking shelves really so unbelievable?"

Andrew's grip on the Glock didn't falter, but she noted he hadn't raised it either. Emboldened, she let her voice crack. "The ransom gutted us. Dad mortgaged Clarke Industries just to keep creditors at bay."

Her shoulders slumped under invisible weight. The lie tasted bitter—the Clarkes still summered in Monaco—but she needed his sympathy. "Every family dinner feels like my funeral. That's why I live alone now."

A delicate finger brushed beneath her eye. "Now that you've seen behind the curtain, you must think I'm pathetic."

Andrew watched her sink to the floor, arms wrapped around bent knees. The tremors in her slender frame suggested tears, though he knew better. His jaw tightened.

The Morgans had once ruled Wall Street too, before the wolves tore them apart. He'd endured the same knives in the dark. "I took Victoria because she's engaged to Sebastian. If Isabella recognized me, she'd never have brought me here."

His shadow fell across her as he stepped closer. Victoria looked up—cheeks flushed, lashes damp. The picture of shattered vulnerability. Before reason intervened, his hand settled on her crown. "Enough."

She blinked. "That's your comfort? No 'there there,' just 'shut up'?"

Her dramatic collapse onto the hardwood would've been comical if not for the calculating glint in her eyes. "Couldn't you at least pretend to care?"

Andrew exhaled sharply. "I don't..."

"Don't what?"

"Don't pity you." Simple. Direct. Answering her unspoken question.

Victoria froze. The script wasn't supposed to include genuine moments. "You believe me?" she whispered.

"What's your name?" she tried again when he didn't respond.

His lips parted then sealed.

Changing tactics, Victoria produced a shattered iPhone, transferring the SIM to an outdated model. Andrew noted the four-year-old device.

"Looks like my loan's going delinquent," she quipped.

Silence.

"Well, couch privileges until you heal. But remember—you owe me." She emerged from her bedroom tossing a cashmere throw onto the sectional.

Her real thoughts ran colder: "Keeping him close is the play. I need to unravel who Andrew Morgan really is."

"Sleep tight." The bedroom door clicked shut.

Andrew stared at the blush-pink blanket and first-aid supplies. Without her interference, he'd be bleeding out in some alley.

Pain lanced through his shoulder as he surveyed the apartment. Sunlight streamed through gauzy curtains onto the cream sectional. Fresh orchids perfumed the air. Every detail screamed curated comfort—a far cry from the safehouses he knew.

At 6'3", the sofa barely accommodated his frame. The juxtaposition of his bloodstained shirt against pearl cushions would've amused him if exhaustion hadn't won. He slid the Glock beneath a pillow just as dawn painted the skyline gold.

XXXXX

First light found Evelyn awake, studying Alexander's sleeping form slumped beside her bed.

"He stayed all night?" Her fingers hovered near his jawline before snatching back.

The realization unsettled her. She'd demanded divorce papers; his refusal meant nothing would change. Alexander Whitmore didn't concede—ever.

Yet her decision stood. This limbo of doubt and resentment couldn't continue.

Scrolling Instagram for distraction, Evelyn paused at Natalie's latest post—a backstage celebration with Eldoria Philharmonic's inner circle.

Her breath caught. There stood Maestro Leonard Herty alongside legends she'd worshipped since childhood.

"Has Natalie actually befriended them?" Excitement fizzed through her veins.

She fired off a comment: [Living the dream! I'd sell my soul for five minutes with these icons.]

To her surprise, Natalie replied instantly: [You could be here too.]

Evelyn dismissed it as politeness until another DM arrived—an application packet for Brookstone Conservatory.

Natalie typed: [Their performance program places students alongside touring virtuosos. Two months until auditions.]

Evelyn's chest ached. She'd buried such dreams years ago.

Another notification: [Seriously, with your technique? Give it two years and you'll headline at Carnegie Hall.]

"Headline?" The fantasy alone terrified her.

The final attachment made her pulse spike—a backstage pass for next week's gala. Natalie's message glowed: [Your first lesson starts here.]
###Chapter 704

"Awake?" Alexander's voice was soft as he found Evelyn already up, scrolling through her phone in bed. His expression softened immediately. "You should be resting after giving birth. Too much screen time isn't good for your eyes. What would you like for breakfast? I'll prepare it for you."

"No need." Evelyn set her phone aside and swung her legs off the bed, heading toward the bathroom.

Alexander moved quickly to assist her, but she subtly sidestepped his outstretched hand. He froze momentarily, clearly taken aback. "Evelyn..."

"I'm not made of glass," she said calmly as she walked toward the bathroom. "It's been days since the delivery. I don't need constant supervision." Her words carried an unspoken accusation - when she'd truly needed him, he hadn't been there. Alexander lowered his gaze, guilt flashing in his eyes before he quickly composed himself and turned toward the kitchen.

When Evelyn emerged after freshening up, she saw Alexander busy at the stove but showed no reaction. She drew back the curtains, changed into fresh clothes, and retrieved her medical acupuncture kit from the drawer.

It was time for Dominic's treatment. His injuries had been severe - he'd barely survived - and his recovery was still fragile.

Hearing movement, Alexander turned off the burner and stepped out. "Where are you going?" he asked, noticing Evelyn heading for the door.

"To administer Dominic's acupuncture," she replied without hesitation.

Alexander paused, a tightness forming in his chest.

Evelyn glanced back slightly. "He saved my life, Alexander. Surely you don't object to that?"

The words struck Alexander with painful familiarity. He pressed his lips together, feeling the weight of her words rebound onto him.

As Evelyn reached for the doorknob, Alexander spoke quickly, "At least eat breakfast first. I made your favorite—"

"Not necessary." Evelyn's voice was calm but distant.

"You need proper nutrition during recovery," Alexander insisted, stepping in her path. "The acupuncture can wait a little longer."

"I'll eat in Dominic's room." Evelyn met his gaze directly, a faint smile touching her lips. "We arranged it yesterday. He's preparing soup for me - it should be ready by now."

Their eyes locked, but Evelyn's expression remained composed. In truth, the soup was fiction - Dominic wouldn't know the first thing about postpartum recovery meals.

Yet the lie cut Alexander deeply. He froze momentarily before forcing a bitter smile. "Is that so?"

"Yes. The soup will get cold if I delay." Evelyn hadn't planned to wound him this way. But she'd endured similar pain from him repeatedly these past weeks.

She thought, "Let him feel what I've felt."

Suppressing her rising guilt, Evelyn brushed past Alexander. The glimmer of moisture in his eyes caught her peripheral vision, making her fingers tighten around her sleeve hem. Her nails dug into her palm. She couldn't afford sympathy now. "He never hesitated when hurting me," she reminded herself.

Behind her, she heard his retreating footsteps. Evelyn bit her lip and moved forward slowly, one hand supporting her waist.

But soon his footsteps returned, quicker this time. Alexander caught up and draped a long coat over her shoulders, then gently placed a knitted hat on her head.

"The temperature dropped," he said evenly, as if the vulnerability she'd glimpsed moments before had been imagined.

With a tender smile, he gazed at her intently. "Stay warm. Don't catch cold. Come back soon - I'll be waiting."

A draft ruffled Alexander's hair as he stood there. The once proud man now appeared gaunt, his frame almost fragile beneath loose pajamas that revealed his recent weight loss.

An inexplicable frustration rose in Evelyn's chest. She averted her eyes and jabbed the elevator button. When the doors opened, she stepped in quickly, as if fleeing.

Alexander remained motionless in the corridor, watching her departure. The elevator doors closed, sealing the distance between them. Even after the elevator descended, he didn't look away.

"So this is how she felt," he thought. "Every time I walked away. I never meant to hurt her, yet the pain was real."

"Mr. Whitmore," Simon's voice interrupted from behind.

"Vanessa appears to be going into labor soon," Simon reported. "Her injuries were severe, and the pregnancy complicated treatment. She's been in agony for days. Yesterday she lost consciousness from the pain. This morning Richard stormed into the hospital, arguing with Eleanor on her behalf."

For Richard, who valued profit above all and prized his connection to the Whitmores, to confront Eleanor over Vanessa was unthinkable.

Simon added, "Vanessa threatened suicide if they didn't induce labor. Eleanor finally relented, but the Harts insisted the optimal delivery date is tomorrow."

Alexander's eyes narrowed slightly. When Damian had been cornered, the noose practically around his neck, Alexander had asked directly if Vanessa was involved in the car incident. Damian had sworn it was solely his doing. A coward like Damian would have betrayed Vanessa instantly to save himself. Yet he hadn't.

A shadow crossed Alexander's face. "Monitor her closely," he ordered coldly. "Before and after delivery, report every move and visitor immediately."

"Yes, Mr. Whitmore," Simon replied.
###Chapter 705

The hospital room was quiet as Evelyn Carter unrolled her acupuncture kit beside Dominic Powell's bed.

Dominic glanced at the clock—just past eight. His voice was casual. "Did you eat breakfast?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled for a fraction of a second before she answered, "Yes."

Dominic's sharp gaze lingered on her face, catching the slight hesitation. "Nathaniel brought soup," he said. "Postpartum recovery blend. Even if you've eaten, have some."

Evelyn blinked, turning as Nathaniel entered with a steaming thermos. "Still hot, Mrs. Whitmore," he said, offering it to her.

The rich aroma filled the room—a traditional remedy for restoring energy, perfect for someone who had just given birth.

Evelyn's thoughts tangled. Dominic Powell, a man with no wife or children—how does he know about this? She studied him, brows furrowed.

Dominic smirked. "Moved to tears?" He shifted slightly, wincing at the pain from his injuries. "If you're that touched, leave Alexander and marry me. Most men wouldn’t raise another man’s child, but I don’t mind."

Evelyn said nothing. She lifted the thermos and drank deeply, the warmth spreading through her, easing the exhaustion she hadn’t realized she was carrying. Could someone really not care?

Dominic watched her drain it in one go and scoffed. "Slow down. It’s not a competition." He reached for it. "Save me a sip."

Too late. The thermos was empty.

Dominic scowled. "Seriously? Not even a drop? Was it that good?"

Evelyn set it aside. "I already drank from it."

Dominic arched a brow. "And? I don’t care."

Something about him had shifted in her eyes. He was reckless, unpredictable—but once he claimed someone as his, he’d burn the world for them. She hesitated, then asked, "That day, when you ran into the fire for me—what were you thinking? Weren’t you afraid?"

Dominic shrugged. "Terrified. Going against instinct isn’t easy."

He wasn’t wrong. Survival instinct demanded retreat, not charging into danger. Yet he had, without hesitation. A second’s delay, and she wouldn’t be here.

His gaze drifted. "You once told me nothing in this world truly belongs to us. Only our feelings, our experiences. Living is about embracing it all—joy, pain, everything in between."

A pause. "I figured you weren’t ready to die yet. If trading my life for yours meant you got to keep living, it was worth it. Honestly? I’ve never found life that meaningful anyway."

The words settled heavily in Evelyn’s chest. He’d been ready to die for her—and they weren’t even close.

"You saved me," she said, pressing the needle into his skin with precision. "But my skills are solid. Now that you’re awake, dying isn’t an option." Another jab.

Dominic grinned, deliberately misreading her. "So you want me around? Miss my company?"

Pale from blood loss, his voice was still teasing, low. "I saved you. Does that mean you’re mine now?"

Evelyn’s ears burned.

"No answer? I’ll take that as a yes." His fingers curled around the back of her neck, pulling her closer.

Evelyn stiffened, turning her face away. "What are you doing?" His breath brushed her skin, warm and unsettling.

Dominic smirked. "What do you think? I’m going to kiss you."

He leaned in—just as the needle hit the pressure point on his forehead.

Dominic went still. His head dropped back onto the pillow, limbs slack, eyes closed—as if he’d fallen asleep.

Evelyn exhaled, studying his face. "Even if I wanted to leave Alexander," she murmured, "we’re still married. I won’t cross that line."

Principles mattered. She wouldn’t start something new before ending the old—not for her sake, but for everyone’s. She wasn’t sure if he heard her. Maybe she just needed to say it aloud.

She packed her kit and left. Outside, she told Nathaniel, "He’ll wake in half an hour."

Nathaniel nodded. But when he re-entered the room, Dominic’s eyes were open.

Nathaniel froze. Didn’t she say thirty minutes?

Dominic’s lips curved. He’d heard every word. She’s actually considering divorce?

A quiet laugh escaped him.

Nathaniel frowned. "Sir... why are you laughing?"

Dominic turned to him, suddenly serious. "How much is in my account?"

Nathaniel blinked. "What?"

Dominic never cared about money. Why now?

"You’ve been in prison ten years," Nathaniel said slowly. "Most of your dividends went to... smoothing things over."

Dominic wasn’t a model inmate. Fights, provocations—the Powell family didn’t cover those expenses.

Dominic’s patience thinned. "Just give me a number."

Nathaniel hesitated. "Between cash and shares—excluding properties—about eight hundred thousand."

Dominic’s expression darkened. "Only eight hundred thousand?"

Nathaniel couldn’t help it. "Why do you need to know?"

Dominic’s answer left him speechless.

"To get married."
###Chapter 706

Alexander feigned seriousness. "Liquidate one of the subsidiaries."

His mind churned with bitterness. "After all I've sacrificed for the Whitmore family - putting my life on the line repeatedly - they can't even spare a million dors for me."

The injustice burned deeper when he thought about his brothers. "Living like kings, spending without restraint while I scrape by. This can't continue."

A cold determination settled in his eyes. "Perhaps it's time to reconsider my allegiance to the Whitmores. How can I provide for Evelyn and our child if this continues? We deserve better."

Evelyn and Alexander's relationship had reached an impasse. She spent the entire day in the hospital room, pointedly ignoring his presence.

When they did exchange words, her tone remained frosty, her responses clipped. The emotional distance between them grew with each passing hour, leaving Alexander increasingly frustrated.

That evening, after Evelyn finally fell asleep, Alexander slipped into the hallway for a smoke. The glowing tip of his second cigarette had just flared to life when Lucas called, inviting him for drinks.

Before leaving, Alexander stationed two security guards outside Evelyn's door. He needed this escape, needed to clear his head.

At Eclipse Lounge, Alexander sank into the plush leather booth and began downing drinks like a man possessed. Ten glasses disappeared in rapid succession.

Lucas watched in alarm. "Are you trying to drown yourself?"

As Alexander reached for another, Lucas grabbed his wrist. "Talk to me. What's going on?"

The words came out bitter. "Evelyn wants a divorce."

Lucas froze. He'd been too wrapped up in his own drama with Claire to notice the cracks in Alexander's marriage.

Claire had dropped a bombshell earlier - she planned to move with their daughter Bella to Silvercrest, halfway across the country from Cresthaven. When Lucas confronted her, their fragile truce shattered.

"Who's in Silvercrest?" Lucas had demanded, blocking the doorway. "Why take Bella so far from home?"

Claire's response cut deep. "She's my daughter. I'm getting her travel documents today, so don't think you can stop me."

"This is about Max, isn't it?" Lucas accused, refusing to budge.

Their recent cooperation as co-parents evaporated in that moment. "How could you take our child to some strange place? Are you thinking of Bella at all, or just yourself?"

Claire's eyes glistened with unshed tears as she turned away without another word, leaving Lucas to puzzle over what he'd said wrong.

Now at the bar, Lucas shared the story with Alexander, who despite his drunken state, offered razor-sharp insight. "You disrespected her."

"How?" Lucas frowned.

Alexander sighed. "She endured pregnancy and childbirth alone. Sacrificed everything for Bella. Anyone else can tell her to prioritize the child - but not you. You didn't share that burden, yet you presume to dictate her life now?"

The truth hit Lucas like a physical blow. He'd been so focused on his rights as a father that he'd forgotten Claire's sacrifices.

"Claire's a model," Alexander continued. "Maybe Silvercrest offers career opportunities. Instead of considering that, you accused her of chasing some man. No wonder she's disappointed."

Lucas's eyes widened with realization. Alexander gave a bitter smirk and drained another glass.

"Your turn," Lucas countered. "You're so perceptive about my problems - how did you end up on the verge of divorce?"

Alexander's dark chuckle spoke volumes. The irony wasn't lost on either of them - how easily they could diagnose others' relationships while remaining blind to their own.

Across the dimly lit bar, Ethan Caldwell's eyes gleamed with opportunity. "Uncle Alexander and Evelyn are splitting up?"

He'd been stuck playing nursemaid to Vanessa all week, her constant complaints about her broken leg driving him to seek refuge at the bar. Now, he'd stumbled upon golden information.

Ethan left Eclipse Lounge with renewed purpose. "This is my chance to win Evelyn back."

At the hospital, he marched straight to Evelyn's room, only to be blocked by Alexander's security detail. "Mrs. Whitmore is resting. No visitors."

"I need to see her," Ethan insisted, but the guards remained unmoved.

The commotion stirred Evelyn from sleep. Her eyes fluttered open, instinctively searching for Alexander. Finding his side of the bed empty, a pang of disappointment struck. "Is he with Isabella again?"

Straightening her gown, she called out, "Let Ethan in."
###Chapter 707

The moment Evelyn agreed to see him, Alexander felt a spark ignite in his chest.

He threw his head back with that familiar arrogance, casting a contemptuous glance at the security detail outside before sauntering in like he owned the place, even having the audacity to slam the door shut behind him.

The bodyguards exchanged irritated looks before immediately dialing Lucas Bennett, dramatically recounting the unfolding situation with embellished details.

Inside the hospital room, Ethan's eyes burned with desperate hope. "Evelyn, is it true? You're really divorcing Alexander?"

Evelyn's delicate brows knitted together. "What business is that of yours? Did you storm in here at midnight just to ask about this?"

"Of course it's my business!" The scent of whiskey clung to Ethan's clothes, yet his gaze remained unsettlingly clear. "You only married him because of me in the first place." His voice dropped to a whisper. "You're leaving him because you finally realized you never loved him, didn't you?" That dangerous hope flickered brighter in his eyes. "You still love me. Say the word, and I'll take you away from all this tonight."

Evelyn stared at him like he'd grown a second head. "My marriage has nothing to do with you, Ethan. Have you completely lost your mind? If this is all you came to say, then get out."

The light in Ethan's eyes shattered like broken glass. Even if Evelyn left Alexander, she would never choose him.

Agony twisted his handsome features. "Why? Why won't you give me another chance? Just say yes, and I'll love you with every breath in my body—I'd die for you."

Evelyn's voice turned arctic. "I gave you seven years worth of chances. You had countless opportunities to prove yourself, but you never did." Her gaze could have frozen hell over. "You're the one who ended our story, Ethan."

Ethan staggered back as if physically struck. First he'd blamed Vanessa, then Alexander. Now the bitter truth settled in his gut—his own indecision had destroyed everything. He'd been out of the game before it even began.

The pain in his chest was a living thing, gnawing at his ribs with serrated teeth until each breath became a battle.

What had once been the purest love of his youth now lay in ruins at his feet, trampled beyond recognition by his own foolish hands.

He stumbled from the room like a man condemned, his soul visibly draining from his body with each mechanical step.

When Alexander arrived at the hospital corridor, this was the haunting sight that greeted him—Ethan Caldwell, once so vibrant, now a hollow shell shuffling away from Evelyn's room. The man didn't even register Alexander's presence as he passed, eyes vacant as a corpse.

Alexander's frown deepened as he pushed open the hospital room door. "Evelyn, did Ethan try to—"

The lights snapped off before he could finish. Darkness swallowed the room as Evelyn burrowed deeper under the covers, her silent dismissal louder than any words. Alexander approached cautiously. "Evelyn..."

She didn't turn to face him. "You've been drinking." Her quiet observation carried an unspoken question—he hadn't gone to see Isabella after all.

Alexander didn't deny it. "Just a few glasses."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I can't stand the smell. You shouldn't stay tonight."

Though the VIP suite was luxurious, it offered only one proper bed. Alexander's broad frame had looked comically cramped on the narrow sofa last night, his long legs dangling awkwardly over the armrest.

He lifted his sleeve to his nose and grimaced—the alcohol fumes were indeed potent. "It was Lucas. He insisted—"

"I don't care." Evelyn's interruption was swift as a guillotine. "Who you drink with or where you go stopped being my concern long ago. I'm exhausted. Leave."

"Evelyn..." Alexander reached for her hand, but she wrenched it away with surprising force.

The alcohol made his head swim, but Alexander forced himself to remain steady as he carefully tucked the blanket around her shoulders. "Rest well," he murmured, his voice rough with unspoken emotion.

He turned to leave but paused at the threshold. "I'll be right outside if you need anything."

The door clicked shut. Evelyn released a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. A thought nagged at her—the hospital corridors were freezing at night. Was he really planning to sleep out there?

Her fingers twitched against the sheets, emotions churning like a stormy sea. After twenty restless minutes, she finally slipped from bed and padded to the door.

When she opened it, the sight punched her straight in the chest—Alexander Whitmore, CEO of Titan Capital, six feet two inches of pure muscle, curled fetal on a hard plastic bench. The hallway was silent except for the howling wind outside the windows.

He'd draped his suit jacket over himself like a child's blanket, his usually perfect hair mussed, face pale with exhaustion. One arm was thrown over his eyes, whether to block light or hide emotion, she couldn't tell. In that moment, he resembled nothing so much as a stray dog—loyal to a fault, stubbornly waiting outside a door that might never open. He'd catch his death out here.

Evelyn stared for a long moment before silently retreating. Her gaze landed on the spare blanket folded over the sofa. After a brief internal battle, she snatched it up and returned to the hallway.

The door creaked louder than she'd intended. Alexander stirred, blinking up at her with sleep-clouded eyes that cleared instantly when he saw the blanket in her hands. His voice was gravel-rough with hope. "Evelyn..."

"Don't get sick and pass it to me," she muttered, avoiding his gaze as she tossed the blanket at him and turned sharply away.

Alexander sat frozen, watching her retreating form. The question haunted him—did she truly want this divorce? The mere thought carved a hollow ache beneath his ribs.

Ethan's broken expression flashed through his mind—that same hopeless devastation he'd witnessed minutes ago. The idea of Evelyn looking at him with that same finality made his blood run cold.

"Evelyn is the only woman I've ever loved," he thought desperately. "And she must feel something too. Why else would she bring me a blanket? This can't be how our story ends."

With sudden determination, Alexander pushed through the door.

Wordlessly, he pulled Evelyn into a crushing embrace. "I won't sign the papers," he rasped into her hair. "Hit me, scream at me, do whatever you need—but don't leave me." He felt hot tears track down his cheeks, cooling against her skin.

Evelyn stood rigid in his arms. When she finally spoke, her voice was feather-light yet carried the weight of the world. "When something breaks, can you really pretend the cracks don't exist? If that were true, shouldn't I still be with Ethan?" She paused, letting the knife twist. "What do you think, Alexander?"

The words struck like a physical blow. Alexander's grip tightened involuntarily. Was he really no different than Ethan in her eyes?
###Chapter 708

Alexander's expression darkened, his jaw tightening visibly. He opened his mouth to speak, but Evelyn pried his hands from her waist with deliberate slowness, one finger at a time. "Enough. I need rest. Please go."

For a heartbeat, Alexander stood frozen. Evelyn turned away, her eyes rimmed red, and shoved him toward the door with surprising strength. When he reached for her again, she slammed the door shut without hesitation. The sharp crack of wood meeting metal echoed through the corridor as Alexander barely pulled his fingers back in time.

From inside, the decisive click of the lock turning sounded like a gunshot to his ears. That single hospital door had become an impenetrable barrier between them, dividing their worlds completely. Alexander remained motionless, staring at the closed door.

Through the small glass panel, he watched Evelyn collapse to her knees, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs. The ache in his chest intensified, drowning him in helplessness. He knew forcing his way in would only make things worse.

Simon appeared beside him suddenly. "Mr. Whitmore, your hand—"

Alexander's fingers had turned an alarming shade of purple, swollen nearly twice their normal size. Yet he barely registered the pain, his gaze still fixed on Evelyn's door. Simon, though confused by the situation, insisted, "Let's get that looked at immediately." This time, Alexander didn't resist.

Claire arrived at the hospital breathless, her hair slightly disheveled. When she knocked, Evelyn finally unlocked the door.

"What happened? Why are you crying?" Claire immediately pulled Evelyn into a tight embrace upon seeing her tear-streaked face. "You're still recovering—this isn't good for you. You'll make yourself sick." Gently, she wiped away Evelyn's tears.

The floodgates opened. Maybe it was because Ethan had hurt her so deeply before that she'd foolishly believed Alexander was her salvation. She'd wanted a fresh start, a happy ending, but everything had unraveled spectacularly. The higher her hopes had soared, the harder the fall.

Claire continued murmuring reassurances until Evelyn's breathing gradually steadied. Noticing Claire's bare face, Evelyn asked, "Why are you here so late?"

"Lucas called. Said you weren't doing well and suggested I keep you company." Claire set down her bag and guided Evelyn back to bed. "I'm guessing this was Alexander's doing." Evelyn's gaze flickered toward the door instinctively. No sign of him. Had he left?

"To stop you from spiraling, I'll stay with you these next few days." Claire patted the empty space beside her. "Mind if I bunk here?"

"Of course not." Evelyn scooted over, making room.

Claire pulled her close with a playful grin. "You smell amazing."

Evelyn squirmed. "I haven't showered properly in days. Are you just being nice? What are you—"

"Think about it—you have a son, I have a daughter. If we got together, we'd have the perfect set!" Claire teased.

Evelyn rolled her eyes but couldn't suppress a small smile.

"Alright, no more jokes," Claire conceded. "Let's sleep."

For the first time in days, with Claire's steady presence beside her, Evelyn fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.

Morning brought the medical team's rounds. The head professor entered with a dozen interns in tow. Claire, still snoring softly, startled awake when Evelyn nudged her. Mortified at being caught by an audience, Claire scrambled out of bed, smoothing her wrinkled clothes.

The doctor examined Evelyn's incision and nodded approvingly. "Healing well. Barring complications, you could be discharged tomorrow."

"What about my baby?" Evelyn asked immediately.

"The neonatal team has him," the doctor replied. "You'll need to consult them separately about his condition."

The thought of her son consumed Evelyn. She'd been unconscious during delivery—hadn't even glimpsed him. What did her own child look like?

Understanding her unspoken longing, Claire helped her to the NICU.

"Your son was premature," the pediatrician explained clinically. "Underweight, underdeveloped lungs, only came off ventilation yesterday. His vitals remain unstable. Come back next week for updates."

"Please," Evelyn begged, tears welling. "I haven't seen him once since he was born."

Protocol strictly prohibited unnecessary contact with preemies. But seeing Evelyn's raw desperation, the doctor relented. "Wait here. We'll arrange something."

As realization dawned, Evelyn's pulse quickened. She gripped Claire's hand like a lifeline. Claire squeezed back reassuringly.

Soon, Evelyn stood before a glass partition, staring at the impossibly tiny bundle inside. Her son's skin was translucent, his body curled tightly, smaller than her forearm. The ventilator had left a faint mark on his button nose. An IV line taped to his delicate arm made Evelyn's heart constrict.

Her lips trembled, tears flowing freely. "He should be in my arms, not suffering alone in this machine."

She snapped a quick photo, but due to his jaundice, the nurse allowed only minutes before whisking him away. Leaning heavily on Claire, Evelyn dissolved into sobs.

"When Bella was born, she spent days in NICU too," Claire murmured. "They're stronger than they look. You'll bring him home soon."

Evelyn wiped her tears, resolve hardening. She was a mother now—falling apart wasn't an option. There was too much to prepare before her son came home.

Back in her room, they found Alexander waiting with breakfast. He set down a steaming thermos. "First time making this. Hope it's edible." Evelyn noticed the bandages on his hand—injured when she'd slammed the door yesterday.

Claire's temper flared instantly. If Evelyn wouldn't speak her mind, she certainly would.

"Where were you when Evelyn needed you most?" Claire snapped. "Showing up now with your half-hearted gestures? Too little, too late, Alexander. She endured labor alone, recovery alone—everything. What kind of husband does that make you? She trusted you completely, and you failed her."

"And let's not forget Isabella," Claire continued acidly. "Still in ICU, isn't she? If she's so important, why aren't you there? You two deserve each other—just stay away from Evelyn!"
###Chapter 709

After Claire finished her outburst, a weight lifted from her shoulders, but Alexander's expression darkened like a storm cloud.

Without ceremony, Claire pushed Alexander out of the hospital room and swiftly locked the door behind him.

Having endured similar pain herself, Claire understood Evelyn's suffering intimately. She was resolved to shield her friend from further heartbreak. "Once you're discharged," Claire offered, "come stay at my penthouse. It's spacious, and I rattle around there alone most days."

Claire and Lucas alternated caring for little Bella over the following days. During Claire's shifts, the infant was conspicuously absent from her home.

Evelyn hesitated only briefly before nodding her agreement.

Later, Claire went to complete Evelyn's discharge paperwork.

Alexander remained rooted in the corridor.

Their eyes met. Claire lifted her chin and swept past him with the regal bearing of a queen dismissing a peasant.

Once Claire disappeared around the corner, Alexander eased open the hospital room door. "Evelyn," he asked softly, "are you leaving today?"

In his hands, he carried Evelyn's favorite takeout - undoubtedly fresh from the restaurant.

Evelyn regarded Alexander with quiet composure. "Yes," she confirmed, "the doctor cleared me this morning."

"I've prepared everything at Whitmore Manor," Alexander said quickly. "The heating's on, staff are ready. It's windy - bundle up. I'll have Simon bring the car around."

"That won't be necessary." Evelyn's voice was feather-light but firm. "I'll be staying with Claire."

Alexander recoiled as if struck. "What? You're not coming home?"

Evelyn's nod was definitive.

"No! Absolutely not!" Alexander's voice cracked with barely restrained emotion. "You're my wife! You can't recuperate at someone else's home after childbirth! I promised to care for you!"

"I may be your wife," Evelyn countered calmly, "but I'm still my own person. I choose where I stay. If you truly care about me, respect my decision."

Alexander fell silent, regretting his earlier words instantly.

He frowned, wanting to argue further but recognizing the futility.

Evelyn's mind was made up, and he owed her this respect.

"Fine," he conceded through gritted teeth. "If Claire's is where you want to be, so be it. But when I visit, you will see me. No avoiding me."

A faint, sad smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Alexander, you're clever enough to understand that avoiding you is precisely why I'm going to Claire's."

The words lanced through Alexander like a physical blow.

Some part of him had known this truth, but hearing it aloud left him breathless with pain.

He looked utterly shattered.

Meanwhile, Evelyn finished packing her belongings.

"My lawyer will send divorce papers when they're ready," she said evenly. "If the terms are acceptable, sign them and we'll arrange to finalize everything."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Evelyn, what will it take to change your mind? You must know you mean more to me than Isabella ever could! If this is about her-"

"Are you certain?" Evelyn interrupted, her gaze piercing. "Truly certain I matter more than Isabella?"

Alexander met her stare.

Though Evelyn looked at him, her focus seemed to extend beyond, as if seeing something distant.

"I made myself clear that night. We're not right for each other anymore."

"Alexander, it's time to let go."

"Not every love story gets a happy ending."

"Thank you for the time we shared. Take care of yourself - I'll do the same."

Evelyn lowered her head, tears threatening.

Her heart ached, but she'd resolved that love shouldn't consume her entire existence.

Life held other treasures beyond romance.

She didn't regret loving Alexander - only that their marriage had reached its inevitable conclusion.

For years, she'd lived constrained. Now, she contemplated the life she truly wanted.

When Evelyn looked up again, her smile was bittersweet.

Alexander's face darkened. "I don't want to hear this, Evelyn. Stop!"

"We are meant to be. Look how long we've lasted!"

"Don't lie to yourself! You still love me - that's why you look so heartbroken!"

Alexander pulled Evelyn into a crushing embrace, his voice thick. "Don't do this. When Bella comes home, we'll be happy. Isabella means nothing to us. Don't throw us away!"

Evelyn did feel regret.

But life overflowed with regrets.

Accepting reality was part of growing up.

She couldn't bear knowing her husband prioritized another woman. She'd wanted to be cherished.

Yet if crisis came, she knew Alexander would save Isabella first. The thought alone was agony.

"Alexander," she asked mockingly, "if I demanded you stop caring for Isabella right now - leave her to fate in the ICU, stop paying her medical bills - could you do it?"

Alexander gaped. That would mean abandoning Isabella to die.

He couldn't ignore someone in need.

He was shocked that kind-hearted Evelyn could suggest such cruelty. Their love had nothing to do with Isabella!

"Evelyn, you..." he stammered.
###Chapter 710

Evelyn's heart sank when she saw Alexander's expression.

She hadn't truly wished for Isabella to die. She only wanted to test him—to see who mattered more in his heart, her or Isabella. But his hesitation spoke volumes.

Disappointment flickered across Evelyn's face. Just then, Claire returned.

Without a word, Evelyn pulled away from Alexander's embrace, brushed past Claire, and strode out of the ward.

Alexander watched her go, stunned by her abrupt departure. Helplessness settled over him like a weight.

Minutes later, Simon entered. "Sir, Vanessa has just been taken to the operating room. She might be going into labor."

Alexander's expression darkened. His mood was already foul, and this news did nothing to improve it.

Simon continued, "Richard is waiting outside the operating room. Even her birth mother, Evelyn Sinclair, has arrived."

A bitter realization struck Alexander. When Evelyn had been wheeled into surgery, only he and the driver had stood vigil.

But for Vanessa, Richard had changed. He was personally overseeing everything, standing guard outside her ward.

Vanessa was far luckier than Evelyn.

The thought twisted something inside him.

Evelyn had always been deprived of love, yet she never demanded more.

When they married, he had sworn to give her everything.

Simon studied Alexander's ashen face with concern.

Alexander had spent the entire night in the drafty corridor and had woken with a fever that morning.

Simon urged, "You should see a doctor. You don’t look well."

Alexander remained silent.

Simon sighed, recognizing the distraction in his eyes. It was Evelyn.

There was nothing he could do.

Vanessa trembled as she was wheeled into the operating room.

Her dislocated bone sent searing pain through her pelvis, leaving her immobilized. Humiliation burned hotter than the agony.

Worse, Eleanor had forbidden the doctors from giving her painkillers.

Vanessa cursed Eleanor silently, resenting her callousness.

But she didn’t dare lash out.

Instead, she turned to Richard, who had always doted on her.

The moment she burst into tears, Richard had argued with Eleanor right there in the ward.

Now, at 32 weeks, with the lung-promoting injections administered, the doctors suggested inducing labor. Eleanor had reluctantly agreed.

Vanessa was terrified.

The doctors had warned her—the baby had congenital heart disease. Survival was unlikely.

Even as she entered the operating room, dread coiled in her stomach.

And then, Evelyn Sinclair appeared.

Vanessa’s birth mother had slipped into the hospital, desperate to see her.

The sight of her suffering had haunted Evelyn Sinclair for days.

She had only meant to glimpse Vanessa before the surgery and leave.

But she ran into Vincent and Eleanor instead.

Chaos erupted.

Eleanor, usually composed, lost all control.

"You dare show your face?" she shrieked, slapping Evelyn Sinclair. "You shameless mistress!"

Vanessa’s blood ran cold.

Why would Eleanor call her mother that?

Before she could process it, the nurses wheeled her away.

The unanswered question gnawed at her.

Had Evelyn Sinclair been involved with Vincent before Richard?

If Eleanor ever discovered Vanessa was her daughter...

She didn’t dare finish the thought.

Ethan didn’t love her. Eleanor was her only lifeline.

But now, even that seemed fragile.

Vanessa prayed her son would survive—just long enough for her to use him to secure her place.

The child was a Whitmore.

Eleanor couldn’t ignore that.

And with all of Cresthaven watching, they had to maintain appearances.

Evelyn had already given birth—a boy, Vanessa had heard.

Her plan crystallized.

She would switch Evelyn’s healthy son with her own dying one.

The doctors had hinted at the fetus’s abnormalities.

For her future, she had no other choice.
###Chapter 711

The heated argument outside the operating room continued to escalate.

Vanessa's suspicion proved correct. Before becoming involved with Richard, Evelyn Sinclair had indeed been entangled with Vincent Black.

Evelyn had once worked at Titan Capital Group, where she'd also been Eleanor's personal assistant.

In his younger days, Vincent had been notorious for his wandering eye, constantly surrounded by beautiful women.

Over the years, Eleanor had dealt with countless such situations, but Evelyn stood out among them all.

This was because Evelyn had served as Vincent's executive secretary - a position Eleanor herself had arranged.

Eleanor had deliberately placed Evelyn by Vincent's side to monitor his extracurricular activities.

Initially, Evelyn had been obedient, reporting everything to Eleanor.

Their relationship had been so close that Evelyn had even accompanied Eleanor to catch Vincent cheating at a luxury hotel.

Impressed by Evelyn's loyalty, Eleanor had rewarded her generously. But Evelyn betrayed that trust during Eleanor's pregnancy by secretly carrying on with Vincent.

Past Events

When Eleanor first heard the rumors, she refused to believe them, convinced of Evelyn's reliability.

It wasn't until Eleanor reached her ninth month that Vincent claimed he needed to travel abroad for business, leaving Evelyn with unexpected free time.

During this period, Eleanor accidentally discovered Vincent's credit card statement in a home drawer.

The receipt showed he'd purchased a $300,000 designer handbag days before his supposed business trip.

Eleanor suddenly remembered seeing Evelyn with that exact same bag.

She immediately summoned Evelyn, but the assistant claimed she'd gone on vacation since she rarely got time off.

Eleanor knew Evelyn wouldn't vacation alone. The suspicion grew unbearable.

Using her connections, Eleanor tracked Evelyn's location and drove there herself.

There, with her full-term pregnant belly, Eleanor witnessed the unthinkable.

Past Events

She found Evelyn and Vincent naked in bed together.

The woman who'd always helped Eleanor catch cheaters had become the cheater herself.

The betrayal cut deep. Vincent's "business trip" had been a cover for this suburban tryst.

Overcome with emotion, Eleanor collapsed, bleeding profusely.

Fortunately, Ethan was already full-term and survived the emergency delivery.

The trauma left lasting scars. After recovering, Eleanor sought revenge.

But Vincent claimed Evelyn had resigned and disappeared.

The matter was reluctantly dropped - Evelyn knew better than to stay within Eleanor's reach.

The damage had been done. Eleanor never forgot the betrayal.

Past Events

Now, decades later, their paths crossed again in this hospital corridor.

When Richard revealed Evelyn was Vanessa's biological mother, Eleanor felt physically ill.

Her previous excitement about Vanessa's pregnancy turned to disgust.

The mere thought of Vanessa being Evelyn's daughter made Eleanor reject the unborn child entirely.

Her blood pressure spiked as the memories flooded back.

Ethan steadied his dizzy mother, recognizing the signs.

Though unfamiliar with Evelyn personally, Ethan knew the stories.

Vincent's countless affairs were family legend.

Eleanor had once confided how one mistress nearly killed her during pregnancy.

Only one woman could provoke such a reaction.

Past Events

Ethan guided Eleanor to a chair as she trembled with rage.

Evelyn bore fresh wounds from Eleanor's attack - hair disheveled, face scratched and bleeding.

She'd only come to check on Vanessa's broken bone, never expecting this confrontation.

After decades in hiding, luck had finally run out.

Richard, unaware of their history, grew increasingly frustrated with his in-laws' behavior.

Watching Eleanor assault Vanessa's mother, he intervened coldly: "Control yourself. Vanessa's in labor. Whatever issue you have with my family, we'll discuss it later."

Evelyn, surprised by Richard's defense, murmured gratitude through swollen lips.

Eleanor took deep breaths, fighting the urge to scream.

She ignored Richard, fixing her gaze on Vincent instead.

The ashamed husband kept his eyes downcast.

Their marital bond had long faded - he felt no guilt, only embarrassment.

Vincent had always sensed something familiar about Vanessa.

Now he understood - she resembled her mother Evelyn.

A terrifying realization struck Eleanor: "Vincent... tell me Vanessa isn't your daughter with Evelyn."
###Chapter 712

The tension in the sterile hospital corridor was suffocating.

Ethan Caldwell had heard every word exchanged between them. The realization hit him like a physical blow. His gaze flickered between Evelyn Sinclair and Vincent Black, confusion and disbelief warring in his eyes. Whatever had provoked Evelyn Carter’s fury—

Vincent met Ethan’s stare, his face burning with humiliation.

The silence was unbearable.

Vincent seethed internally. This is Evelyn Sinclair’s fault! She took the money and swore she’d vanish. How is she not only still in Cresthaven but has entangled Ethan in her mess?

"Evelyn, what nonsense are you spouting?" Vincent denied immediately. "Vanessa couldn’t possibly be my daughter. You know I haven’t had any contact with Evelyn Sinclair in years!"

Evelyn Carter’s expression remained icy, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Ethan, piecing together the ugly truth, felt sick.

He turned to Evelyn Sinclair, his voice sharp with accusation. "You were involved with him?"

Evelyn Sinclair recoiled. "Ethan, it’s not what you think—"

He cut her off with a sharp gesture.

Vincent had all but confessed, yet she still dared to lie.

Disgust twisted Ethan’s features. "You’re shameless! How are our families supposed to coexist now? What about Vanessa?"

Vanessa’s position in the Hayes family had always been precarious. This scandal would only make things worse.

Ethan had no idea how she would face the Hayes family after this.

Evelyn Carter would despise her even more. Shame burned through him.

"Get out!" Ethan roared at Evelyn Sinclair. "Don’t ever show your face near us again! This is all your doing!"

Evelyn Sinclair stood frozen, regret choking her.

Tears spilled down her cheeks as she looked toward the operating room. "But Vanessa is still in there, giving birth. I can’t leave—"

Her plea snapped everyone back to reality.

She was Vanessa’s mother. Of course she wanted to stay.

But her presence only darkened the mood.

The sight of her enraged Evelyn Carter. Without waiting for Vanessa to be wheeled out, she stood abruptly.

When Vincent didn’t move, she shot him a venomous glare. "Why are you still here?"

Afraid of provoking her further, Vincent hastily followed her out.

It struck him then—he’d been played for years. He’d actually believed Evelyn Sinclair was pure before him.

She was nothing but a gold-digging schemer, using men to climb her way up.

She’d been with countless others.

No man could stomach that.

Ethan certainly couldn’t.

The thought that Vanessa was her daughter made his skin crawl. He couldn’t even look at her without nausea rising in his throat.

His expression darkened. With one last scathing look at Evelyn Sinclair, he turned to leave.

She lunged forward, grabbing his arm. "Ethan, Vanessa is your daughter too! She’s in labor—how can you just—"

His voice was glacial. "Daughter? Vanessa isn’t my only child."

"Ethan!"

He didn’t look back.

Within moments, the hallway was nearly empty. Only Evelyn Sinclair and Alexander Whitmore remained.

Alexander had spent the previous night sleepless, grappling with the fact that Evelyn Carter was truly lost to him. The pain had been unbearable.

He’d just begun accepting that he was about to become a father. He didn’t love Vanessa, but the child was his.

Then this disaster struck.

Seeing Alexander still there, Evelyn Sinclair pleaded, "Mr. Whitmore, this is my fault. Please don’t take it out on Vanessa. She’s innocent."

Alexander’s gaze was frigid. "Innocent? How?"

Evelyn Sinclair pressed on. "Vanessa has loved only you all these years. That kind of devotion is rare. Shouldn’t you cherish her?"

Alexander scoffed. "So?"

His privileged upbringing had made him arrogant. He looked at Evelyn Sinclair with nothing but contempt.

"You’re overstepping," he said coldly. "Do you really think birthing Vanessa makes you family?"

His lip curled. "You’ll never be."

Alexander had never loved Vanessa. Her past actions had only deepened his disgust.

If not for Eleanor’s objections, he would’ve divorced her long ago. This child wouldn’t exist.

Evelyn Sinclair lunged as he turned to leave.

The others could go, but Alexander was Vanessa’s husband!

She couldn’t let him abandon her now.

But two bodyguards blocked her path.

Helpless, she watched Alexander walk away.

Soon, the hallway was deserted except for her.

She stared at the operating room doors, her heart breaking.

Two hours later, the doors finally swung open.

Vanessa emerged, her eyes widening at the emptiness.

"Where is everyone? Where’s Alexander?"

Evelyn Sinclair bowed her head. "They left."

Vanessa’s voice trembled. "They left? I was giving birth! Weren’t they all waiting for this baby?"

The injustice of it shattered her. Tears spilled over.

The silence was deafening.
###Chapter 713

"Vanessa, I'm sorry."

The nurse helped Vanessa settle into her hospital room, with Evelyn trailing closely behind.

Evelyn proceeded to recount the shocking encounter that had just occurred in the hallway.

Vanessa's face twisted in horror as the truth sank in.

Her biological mother had once been Vincent's mistress.

The revelation was too much to bear.

Vanessa felt her world crumbling around her.

She could already picture Eleanor exacting revenge on her in the days to come.

"Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Vanessa demanded, her voice trembling.

Evelyn hesitated. "I—"

It was a truth too shameful to admit.

Vanessa's tears spilled over. "You knew I was giving birth today. You knew Alexander and Eleanor would be here. Why did you have to show up and let them see you?"

Her voice rose in accusation. "Was this deliberate? Do you want to ruin me?"

Evelyn's hands fluttered helplessly. "Vanessa, you're my daughter. Of course I want you to be happy. I came because I was worried about you."

"Worried?" Vanessa let out a bitter laugh. "Because of you, everything is ruined! How am I supposed to face the Whitmores now?"

Her voice cracked. "What will people say when they find out my mother was a gold-digger who slept with married men?"

Evelyn's face burned with humiliation. "Vanessa, how can you speak to me like that? I only wanted a better life. I was terrified of poverty growing up—I had no choice!"

"But I'm the one who has to suffer for it!" Vanessa cried. "Ethan never loved me to begin with. Now, how can I ever face him again? You've destroyed my marriage!"

She buried her face in her hands, sobbing uncontrollably.

Evelyn tried to console her. "But you just gave birth to a son, didn't you?"

The nurse had informed them earlier—Vanessa had delivered a premature baby boy, now in the neonatal unit for urgent care.

"A son?" Vanessa's laugh was hollow. "A son with a congenital heart defect. The doctors warned me he might not survive past infancy. Even if he does, he'll need multiple surgeries—each one life-threatening."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Do you understand? He’s sick. The Whitmores won’t want a child like this."

Evelyn paled. She had assumed the baby was simply premature—not critically ill.

Vanessa had risked her life for this child, yet no one would celebrate his birth.

The weight of despair crushed her.

She curled into herself, weeping until her body shook.

Evelyn reached out, her own heart breaking. "Vanessa, you’ve just given birth. Crying like this will harm your health—"

Vanessa jerked away.

In her grief, she blamed Evelyn for everything.

"You’re not my mother. Get out! I never want to see you again!"

Evelyn gasped. "I gave birth to you! How can you say that?"

"I never asked to be born to you," Vanessa spat. "What makes me any less than Evelyn? Just because I’m not Margaret’s real daughter, everyone looks down on me!"

Her voice rose to a scream. "You’ve ruined everything! Even the Whitmores will despise me now. What am I supposed to do?"

Evelyn’s tears fell freely. This wasn’t how she imagined their reunion.

Vanessa pointed to the door. "Leave! Get out of my room! From today, we’re strangers!"

The deception of Vanessa’s false identity had haunted her for years.

Since Evelyn Carter had been reclaimed by the Hayes family at fourteen, Vanessa had lived in constant fear—all because of the lie Evelyn had orchestrated.

When Evelyn switched them as infants, Vanessa had been too young to understand.

Evelyn first approached Vanessa when she was nine—a third-grader confronted by a stranger claiming to be her mother.

At first, Vanessa ignored her.

But Evelyn kept returning, disrupting her life.

Vanessa wanted to tell Margaret, but she was terrified the truth would destroy her.

Then the DNA test confirmed it.

Vanessa thought the secret would die with them—until Evelyn Carter was found.

For years, Vanessa had tormented Evelyn, afraid she’d steal everything from her.

She schemed to turn the Hayes family against Evelyn, isolating her completely.

Only Oliver remained beyond her reach.

Now, Vanessa’s life was in shambles.

She had escaped her past, married the man she loved—only for Evelyn to ruin everything.

Ethan’s family had made their disdain clear.

When Vanessa left the operating room, no one had waited for her.

Not even Ethan.

Evelyn watched her daughter unravel, her own heart breaking.

"Vanessa," she pleaded, "what can I do to make this right? Please don’t cut me out of your life. You’re all I have left."

After her affair with Richard was exposed, he had abandoned Evelyn to win Margaret back.

The flower shop he’d funded was gone.

At fifty, if Vanessa disowned her, Evelyn would have nothing.

Vanessa’s tears slowed.

She looked up, her gaze sharpening.

"Fine. Then do something for me. If you succeed, I’ll forgive you."

Evelyn leaned forward eagerly. "Anything."

Vanessa’s voice dropped to a whisper.

"Switch Evelyn’s baby with mine."

Evelyn recoiled.

Vanessa’s eyes gleamed with desperation. "It shouldn’t be hard for you. You did it once before, didn’t you?"

Her fingers dug into the sheets.

"A healthy child is my only hope now."
###Chapter 714

Vanessa's words left Evelyn stunned.

She never imagined Vanessa would consider swapping babies. But after a moment's thought, it made twisted sense.

Years ago, Evelyn had switched infants so Vanessa could enjoy the Whitmore family's luxury.

In Evelyn's mind, Vanessa deserved that privilege. She'd never regretted her decision.

For Vanessa, this new swap offered escape from her current misery.

A sickly child would always be overlooked in the Caldwell household.

But a healthy, charming replacement might earn Vanessa the family's favor.

Evelyn nodded decisively. "I'll make sure you get a perfect baby."

Vanessa finally exhaled in relief.

Broken bones and a C-section kept Vanessa bedridden.

Worse, she'd learned of Damian's sudden death in prison last week.

Now completely alone, Vanessa had to rely on Evelyn's help.

At least Evelyn had experience with this particular crime.

"Don't get caught," Vanessa warned.

Lately, she'd felt invisible eyes watching her.

No proof. Just paranoia.

Better to let Evelyn handle the dirty work while Vanessa recovered under scrutiny.

Evelyn swore secrecy. "This stays between us forever."

She understood the stakes.

Exposure would destroy Vanessa completely. Failure wasn't an option.

Evelyn stayed all day, only leaving when servants arrived.

The swap required meticulous planning.

To Vanessa, the scheme seemed simple.

Both babies received neonatal care.

Hundreds of infants filled those wards. A "mistaken" name tag swap would suffice.

Though premature, Vanessa's son had strong lungs thanks to early interventions.

Meryl's sickly runt would be easy to replace.

Newborns all looked alike anyway.

Vanessa closed her eyes, praying this desperate gamble would work.

Simon reported the day's events to Alexander in exact detail.

The revelation about Evelyn's affair with Vincent shocked Alexander.

Vincent's notorious womanizing was legendary, but Evelyn?

"Keep watching Vanessa," Alexander ordered.

Three days of bed rest left Claire restless.

Worse, she missed her daughter terribly.

Nightly, she stared at Bella's photo, aching with loneliness.

That evening, Claire stormed home after sunset, visibly furious from a phone argument.

"What happened?" Evelyn asked.

"Lucas!" Claire spat. "He won't let me take Bella to Cresthaven!"

Evelyn blinked. "You're moving?"

Claire paced angrily. "The modeling discrimination here is unbearable. Cresthaven offers real opportunities!"

Multiple rejections had crushed her - employers dismissing her for motherhood.

Dancing remained her true passion, ever since her career-ending injury.

Max had promised teaching opportunities in Cresthaven's entertainment industry.

"I just need stability first," Claire insisted. "Then I'll bring Bella over."

Lucas accused her of chasing men, not dreams.

Evelyn considered carefully. "Separating a child from her father... that's hard."

"Everything's hard!" Claire snapped, then deflated. "But I need to show Bella what ambition looks like."

Evelyn suggested compromise. "Establish yourself first. Visit weekends. Bring Bella later."

The thought of separation pained Claire.

"I'll think about it," she murmured, torn between motherhood and dreams.
###Chapter 715

The morning sun had barely risen when Evelyn heard the sharp knock at the door.

Claire had left only minutes earlier. Evelyn assumed her friend had forgotten something and hurried to answer.

Her breath caught when she saw Alexander standing there.

For a moment, she froze. Then instinct took over - her hand flew to slam the door shut.

Alexander's foot blocked it effortlessly.

"Evelyn," his voice was rough with emotion. "I've been worried sick about you. Made your favorite tortilla soup." He held up a steaming container. "You haven't been answering my calls."

She'd been ignoring him deliberately. The anger still burned fresh.

Alexander knew he needed to apologize properly.

He tried to push inside, but Evelyn resisted. They stood locked in silent battle at the threshold.

"At least take the soup," he pleaded. "Even if you hate me, don't punish yourself."

Evelyn's pallor worried him. Had she been eating properly since leaving?

Before she could react, Alexander pulled her into his arms. She struggled, but his embrace was unyielding.

His familiar citrus scent surrounded her, stirring unwanted memories.

"Come home," he murmured against her hair. "Let me take care of you properly."

Evelyn fought against the traitorous comfort of his arms.

Alexander rested his chin on her shoulder. "I haven't slept since you left. The bed feels empty without you." His voice cracked. "We're still married, Evelyn. Staying here instead of our home... it's not right."

His exhaustion was evident in the shadows beneath his eyes.

Isabella remained in critical care.

The doctors said she'd briefly regained consciousness before slipping back into coma. The back-alley kidney removal had caused severe infection. Even if she recovered, her health would never be the same.

Alexander couldn't let his marriage end over this. He felt nothing for Isabella.

He knew Evelyn's ultimatum stemmed from jealousy. But he'd fix this. Make it up to her somehow.

The steady thud of Alexander's heartbeat beneath her ear felt like betrayal.

Evelyn let out a hollow laugh, pushing against his chest to create distance.

"How familiar," she said softly. "You're acting just like Ethan did when he came crawling back. Must be a family trait."

The barb hit its mark.

Alexander flinched but tightened his hold. "Don't say that. It kills me when you compare me to him."

"Then what would you have me do?" Evelyn's hand trailed up to caress his cheek.

Her touch was tender, but her eyes held winter.

Fingertips brushed his Adam's apple. "Should I pretend nothing happened? Play the doting wife?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I can't, Alexander."

"Dominic is still hospitalized. Andrew saved your life, so you care for Isabella. But Dominic saved your wife and child. Where's his repayment?"

She fisted his collar, dragging him closer.

Though her tone remained sweet, the ice in her gaze froze him solid. Tears streaked her face, yet her expression remained resolute.

The contradiction shattered him.

Beneath the brave facade, he saw the wounded woman he'd failed.

Evelyn shoved him back with surprising strength, slamming the door between them.

She slid down against the wood, knees drawn to chest.

Alexander's frantic knocking echoed through the apartment. "Evelyn! Open up! We need to talk!"

She wiped her tears roughly. Time to end this.

The door swung open abruptly. Alexander's hopeful expression crumpled when she thrust a thick envelope into his hands.

"What's this?" He frowned, flipping through the contents.

The words "Divorce Agreement" leaped off the page.

Three days. That's all it had taken her to have papers drawn up. Every clause meticulously detailed.

The world tilted. Alexander swayed on his feet.

Evelyn had lost weight. The softness he loved had been replaced by sharp edges.

But it was the emptiness in her eyes that destroyed him.

"Consider this a moment of anger," he rasped, crushing the papers against his chest.

He leaned in, lips brushing her ear. "You still love me. I know you do."
###Chapter 716

Alexander's voice held raw sincerity as he murmured, "Evelyn, our son is already here. Don't you want to give him a complete family?"

His own childhood had been far from ideal - in truth, it had been downright traumatic. At an age when most children were showered with love, he'd been shipped off to live with strangers in the countryside.

The reason? His mother had taken her own life shortly after his birth, driven to despair by another man. To Harold Aniston, Alexander had always been a painful reminder of his failed marriage. Though born into wealth, Alexander had grown up with less affection than a stray dog.

Evelyn hadn't known a complete family either. That's precisely why Alexander was determined their son would have everything they'd lacked.

People always sought to compensate for their own deficiencies through their children. Those denied education pushed their offspring to study. Those raised in poverty drove their children toward wealth. And Alexander? He wanted his son surrounded by all the love they could give.

As expected, Evelyn's eyes flickered with emotion at his words. The child was hers - how could she not care? If she divorced Alexander, her greatest regret would be their son.

Her momentary hesitation was all the opening Alexander needed. In one fluid motion, he pulled her against him, cradling her face before claiming her lips in a searing kiss.

His fingers encircled her wrist gently before pressing her against the wall. The kiss was both tender and demanding, his breath hot against her skin as he murmured, "If you're still angry about what happened, punish me however you want. I'll take it. But don't divorce me. We promised forever - what's the point in breaking that? The only way I'm leaving is in a coffin..."

She could taste the faintest hint of whiskey on his lips - not enough to be unpleasant, just enough to add an intoxicating edge.

Evelyn's eyes fluttered shut, her breath catching. There was no escaping the intensity of his kiss, no resisting the way his touch set her skin ablaze.

It had been months since they'd been this close - not since before her pregnancy. Now, with his hands roaming her body, his desire was unmistakable.

"Weren't you happy with me before, Evelyn?" he whispered between kisses. "I've already arranged for Isabella to receive specialized care overseas. Even if she wakes, she'll need long-term treatment abroad. She won't come between us."

Alexander's voice was rough with emotion as he cradled her face, his dark eyes burning with intensity. "I don't love her. Yes, I went to save her - from your perspective, that must have seemed cruel. But she's a living person. Should I have let her die? If I were truly that heartless, wouldn't you find me terrifying? Is that the kind of man you'd want to spend your life with?"

This was Alexander Whitmore at his most persuasive - the man who'd secured his position as CEO of Titan Capital Group in record time. Every word carried weight.

Evelyn let out a soft, resigned laugh. She felt utterly trapped, her resolve crumbling under his relentless logic. "You always know exactly where to strike," she sighed, their lips nearly touching. "You know the child is my only hesitation."

Even as she spoke, doubt gnawed at her. Should she really stay just for their son? "Look at you," she murmured, pulling back slightly. "After everything, you're still bringing up Isabella. Are you really that concerned about her?"

Alexander's voice dropped to a husky whisper. "I only mentioned her because I want you to move forward, Evelyn. Stop dwelling on the past."

Her hand pressed against his chest before sliding up to clasp behind his neck. "But tell me honestly - should I settle just because of our child?"

"Settle?" His expression darkened instantly, warmth giving way to icy displeasure. "Being with me is settling?"

Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly. "It wasn't before. But that doesn't mean it won't be. Andrew saved your life, so you feel indebted. But Dominic saved mine, Alexander. If I started running to him every time he needed something, could you tolerate that marriage?"

His jaw clenched. "That's different. Dominic's act was noble, but I'll be the one to repay that debt. You don't need to concern yourself."

When Dominic had been critically injured, it was Alexander who'd personally called the hospital director. The director later confessed that any delay would have been fatal.

Alexander had been willing to repay Dominic in every way - except by surrendering the woman he loved.

His thumb brushed Evelyn's lips, silencing her. "Enough," he murmured. "The doctor said your hormones are still stabilizing postpartum. It's natural to feel unbalanced."

"That said," he continued, pulling her closer, "I'm not taking your words to heart. I came today because I needed to see you. And now that I have... I can tell you haven't been well without me. Come home. I've missed you terribly."

Before she could respond, he swept her into his arms, one arm beneath her knees. She tensed to struggle, then remembered her stitches. Too much movement could reopen the wound.

He carried her to the elevator, through the parking garage, and gently settled her in the passenger seat, buckling her in himself.

Turning to study her face, he murmured, "I know you still care for me, Evelyn. Dwelling on the unchangeable past only tortures you. What's done is done. It's time to move forward."


Alexander quickly turned on the heater, then retrieved a thick blanket from the backseat, tucking it around her until only her face remained visible. "We're good now, yes? Just like before?" he asked softly. "Tell me what I must do to prove your worth to me?"

Evelyn remained silent, lashes fluttering as she looked down. She knew her extended stay at Claire's had become inconvenient.

Originally, Claire and Lucas had been splitting custody of Sophia week by week. But with Evelyn recovering at Claire's, they'd sent Sophia to Lucas full-time to avoid disturbing Evelyn's rest. Now that Evelyn was leaving, Claire could finally bring her daughter home.

Warm air brushed Evelyn's cheeks, but her thoughts were elsewhere.

While finalizing divorce terms, she'd also applied to Brookstone College of Music. Natalie had facilitated the connection after Evelyn mentioned admiring a certain industry legend.

Just yesterday, the school had contacted her about a video interview in three days. Admission would mean studying under some of the world's greatest musicians - an opportunity she'd discussed with Leonard, who'd fully supported her continuing education.

Thirty minutes later, the car pulled into their driveway. Alexander studied her pensive expression. "What's on your mind? You've been quiet."

"Nothing," Evelyn said, snapping from her thoughts to unbuckle her seatbelt.

Alexander caught her hand. "Slowly. Let me help you." His thoughtfulness remained unchanged.

She allowed him to assist her, but beneath the surface, she knew nothing would ever be quite the same again.
###Chapter 717

Evelyn and Alexander stepped inside. The warmth from the heater enveloped them, mingling with the delicate fragrance of gardenias that lingered in the air.

Dinner time had arrived, and Evelyn’s stomach gave a quiet growl. Her gaze drifted to the container of tortellini soup Alexander had brought earlier. She opened it, settling at the dining table, spoon poised to take the first sip.

But before she could, Alexander whisked it away. "Now that you're home, you deserve something fresh." He strode to the kitchen, returning with a steaming bowl of soup. "What else would you like? I'll make it for you."

She murmured, "Anything is fine."

Alexander arched a brow, lips quirking in amusement. "Then I'll surprise you. Sit tight."

He shrugged off his jacket, revealing a crisp white shirt beneath. Grabbing an apron, he handed it to Evelyn. "Sweetheart, could you tie this for me?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, certain he was teasing her. Yet, when she met his earnest gaze, she couldn’t refuse. Reluctantly, she looped the strings around his waist, her fingers brushing against the firm muscles beneath his shirt.

Once secured, Alexander turned with a small smile. "Drink your soup first. I’ll be quick." He moved efficiently, the kitchen already prepped with ingredients.

Evelyn pulled out her phone, texting Claire to say she wouldn’t be staying over. No reply—Claire was probably busy.

Missing her son, she scrolled through his photos. She called the NICU daily for updates.

The doctor had assured her his lungs were fully developed, no longer needing a ventilator. His vitals were stable, and for the first time in weeks, Evelyn could breathe easier.

But this morning, the doctor mentioned his foramen ovale hadn’t closed yet. A quick search told her it wasn’t serious—common in preemies, usually resolving by his first birthday. Still, it involved his heart, so she planned to visit soon.

Alexander emerged with a dish, setting it before her. "Eat if you're hungry. I have more coming."

Evelyn frowned at the spread. "This is plenty. We’ll waste food if you cook more."

His brow furrowed. "I just want to make sure you’re nourished."

"Then sit and eat with me," she insisted.

Alexander obliged, filling her plate. "This aids healing. And this—in case you’re tired of the soup—balances it out."

His thoughtfulness carried the weight of a devoted husband. Yet Evelyn stayed quiet. She felt his care, but the scars between them ran deep, making his kindness feel like appeasement.

"Have you visited our son?" she asked.

Alexander set down his fork. "The doctor says he’s well, but I haven’t seen him yet."

Parents weren’t allowed in the NICU. Evelyn’s visit had been sheer luck.

She didn’t mention her upcoming interview at Brookstone College of Music. Instead, she said, "I want to go to the hospital later."

"To see our son?"

"To see Dominic."

Alexander’s breath hitched, his expression darkening. She held his gaze unflinchingly. "It’s been days since his acupuncture. I’m worried."

He swallowed hard. "I checked on him. He’s recovering well. You just gave birth—you shouldn’t go out."

"Is that so?" Evelyn set her fork down. "Acupuncture improves circulation. For someone with internal injuries, it’s crucial."

Alexander sensed retaliation beneath her words. Night had fallen; by the time they finished, it’d be pitch black. He studied her. "You’re set on going?"

"Yes."

He exhaled. "Fine. But it’s cold—change into something warmer first."

Evelyn didn’t argue. After dinner, she headed to the closet—and froze. Beside their bed sat a small blue crib, meticulously made with plush bedding. Stuffed animals lined the edges.

Her throat tightened. Did Alexander prepare this? She hadn’t expected such thoughtfulness.

Noticing her reaction, Alexander wrapped an arm around her. "Once our son comes home, we’ll be a family. I can’t wait, Evelyn."

She stayed silent, but for the first time, she wondered if he might truly be a good father.

When she didn’t respond, he fetched a thick coat. "Need help?" Before she could answer, his fingers brushed her collar, undoing the buttons.

The space between them was intimate, his breath warm against her skin. Her lips accidentally grazed his fingers, and his grip tightened.

"Stay home tonight," he murmured, voice low. "I’ll take you first thing tomorrow. It’s too cold for you to be out."

She shook her head.

Alexander pulled her closer. "Please, Evelyn. Your health comes first."

She tried to push him away—but her nails accidentally scratched his cheek, leaving a faint streak of blood.

He froze, surprise flickering in his eyes. "Evelyn... did you just hit me?"
###Chapter 718

Evelyn hadn't intended to hurt Alexander. The moment it happened, her stomach twisted with guilt. Blood trickled from the cut on his cheekbone, stark against his pale skin.

She bit her lower lip, her fingers trembling. "I didn't mean to... You should take care of that."

Alexander barely glanced at the wound. "It's nothing."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "It's still bleeding." Without waiting for a response, she turned and retrieved the first-aid kit from the car. She set it down in front of him, her expression unreadable.

His gaze darkened, his voice softening. "I can't do this myself. Evelyn, help me."

She hesitated. He tilted his head slightly, studying her face before adding, "You're rushing to the hospital to assist Dominic with his treatment, but you won't even tend to this? Especially when you caused it."

After a beat, she relented. Annoyance still simmered beneath her skin, but she opened the kit. The cut wasn't deep, but it stretched across his cheek, red and angry.

She dipped a cotton swab in antiseptic and pressed it to the wound. His breath hitched, his jaw tightening.

Evelyn suspected he thought she was doing this deliberately—punishing him in some small way. But her expression remained blank, betraying nothing.

The sting must have been sharper than he expected. His fingers closed around her wrist, his voice rough. "Evelyn... it hurts."

Alexander had always been unshakable, never showing vulnerability. Seeing him like this—brows furrowed, a faint sheen of sweat at his temples—was unsettling.

She gentled her touch, switching to a soothing ointment. "Better?"

His lips curved slightly. Eyes closed, he murmured, "Thank you. It doesn't hurt anymore. Actually... I'm glad. I know you care. You just won't say it." His voice was quiet, warm with something like relief.

All he'd ever wanted was simple—to spend his life with the woman he loved. Only with Evelyn did he feel like he could breathe.

She said nothing, focusing on packing the medical supplies away. Just as she closed the kit, his arms encircled her from behind, pulling her against his chest. "You came back. That's all I wanted. I won't take it for granted."

Silence stretched between them. When it became clear he wouldn't let go, she finally spoke. "I'm tired. I need to rest. Alexander, leave."

"Leave?" He blinked, startled. After a pause, he nodded. She hadn't forgiven him yet—he knew better than to push.

"Alright. I'll sleep in the study. Rest well." With that, he quietly shut the door behind him.

Hours later, Evelyn lay awake, staring at the ceiling. Her phone buzzed—a message from Claire.

[Why did you go back? Does this mean you've forgiven Alexander?]

Evelyn frowned. She hadn't forgiven him. She just... needed to watch him a little longer. One mistake shouldn't erase everything. Aside from the mess with Isabella, he'd always been dependable.

What she didn't expect was Oliver's arrival the next morning. He'd been studying abroad, building his career overseas. But the second he heard about the baby, he'd booked the first flight home.

He looked like he'd come straight from the airport, lugging multiple suitcases. The moment he stepped inside, he grinned. "Evelyn! Where's my nephew?"

Her gaze dropped. "He was premature. Still in the hospital."

Oliver unpacked supplements he'd brought for her. "He's not discharged yet? When can I see him?"

"It'll be a while."

Her subdued tone made him pause. "What's wrong?"

All he knew was that Evelyn had been in an accident, triggering early labor. Details had come from Margaret—he had no idea about the rest.

So Evelyn told him everything.

The moment she finished, Oliver exploded. He shot up from the couch, fists clenched. "Wait—so when you crashed, Alexander wasn't just absent, he left you for another woman?" His voice rose, outrage blazing in his eyes. "Where the hell is he? I need to talk to him."

But Alexander had left early that morning. Though he'd promised to take Evelyn to the hospital for Dominic's treatment, he was gone when she woke. Only a warm breakfast remained.

She didn't call him.

Evelyn picked at her food. "He probably had business." Then, quieter, "Maybe... something came up at Isabella's hospital."

Alexander had gone to the hospital—but not the one where Isabella was.

A pediatrician had called him. That morning's echocardiogram had revealed an abnormality in the baby's heart.

He didn't want Evelyn worrying, especially not during her recovery. So he went alone.

In the NICU, he finally saw his son. Two weeks old, but still so small—curled in the incubator like a fragile doll.

The baby's skin was nearly translucent, tinged faintly purple. His tiny chest rose and fell rapidly. Alexander's throat tightened.

This wasn't how it was supposed to be.

He turned to the doctor. "What's wrong with his heart?"

The physician hesitated. Initially, it had just been a minor patent foramen ovale—common in preemies, usually harmless.

But today's results were different. The condition had worsened.

The doctor's silence made Alexander's stomach drop. "Just tell me. I can handle it."

Whatever it was, this was his child—his and Evelyn's. He'd face it. No matter the cost.
###Chapter 719

The physician wasted no time cutting to the chase. "Mr. Whitmore, your son has a congenital heart defect. He'll require surgery, but given his premature state, the procedure carries significant risks. Most surgeons wouldn't dare operate on an infant this fragile."

Alexander's grip tightened around the medical report. The unspoken implication hung heavy in the sterile air—failure was a very real possibility.

"And even if the initial operation succeeds," the doctor continued, "he'll need meticulous aftercare. A second surgery will be necessary by age three."

The words struck Alexander like a physical blow. Prematurity compounded the danger. No guarantees. No promises. Just a tiny life balanced on a knife's edge.

"Additionally," the doctor added, flipping a page, "he's presenting with severe anemia. We'll need to administer a blood transfusion immediately."

"Whatever he needs," Alexander said without hesitation. But the heart condition... That conversation with Evelyn would require careful timing. Would she even survive the news?

He gave a curt nod. "Schedule the surgery at the earliest possible date. Spare no expense."

The physician nodded briskly. "I'll assemble our top pediatric cardiology team."

A nurse guided Alexander to the transfusion ward. Routine blood typing first. When the results flashed on the screen, her brow furrowed. "This can't be right... Your blood type isn't compatible. The baby has type B."

Alexander went rigid. "Type B?"

"Must've inherited it from Mrs. Whitmore," the nurse offered cheerfully.

The world tilted. Neither he nor Evelyn had type B blood. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Verify that result."

The nurse double-checked. "Confirmed. See for yourself."

Alexander scanned the document. Without another word, he strode back to the NICU, his footsteps echoing like gunshots in the hollow corridor.

The incubator's occupant slept peacefully, tiny chest rising and falling with mechanical assistance. Alexander studied every minute detail—the slope of the nose, the curve of the brow. Traces of Evelyn, yes. But nothing of himself.

Then the infant stirred, blinking open drowsy eyes.

Alexander recoiled as if struck.

Those eyes.

Unmistakably Ethan Caldwell's.

His vision tunneled. The walls seemed to press inward. That arrogant bastard had boasted the child was his months ago. Alexander had dismissed it as drunken bravado.

But now?

Blood type mismatch. Ethan's distinctive cobalt eyes staring back at him. The math was horrifyingly simple.

"Mr. Whitmore?" The doctor's voice sounded distant. "You're pale. Should I call—"

"Proceed with the surgery." Alexander barely recognized his own voice.

He turned on his heel and left, the weight of betrayal crushing his ribs with every step.

Simon Graves waited anxiously outside. One look at Alexander's ashen face told him something was catastrophically wrong. "Sir? The baby's condition—"

"Vanessa," Alexander interrupted hoarsely. "Has she left her room today?"

Simon blinked at the non sequitur. "No. With her injuries and recent delivery, she's been bedridden."

Alexander's jaw clenched. No switching scenario. No hospital error. Just cold, irrefutable genetics.

He needed air. Needed to think. "Don't follow me."

As Alexander disappeared down the stairwell, Simon cast a troubled glance toward the NICU. Was the prognosis worse than they'd feared?

Meanwhile, in a private maternity suite, Evelyn Sinclair's phone vibrated with a coded message:

It's done. The healthy one's ours now.

Vanessa Hart nearly wept with relief. Finally—after months of humiliation and failure—fate had dealt Evelyn Carter a losing hand. Her mother's voice crackled through the receiver:

"I weighed them during the switch. That sickly thing is definitely hers now."

Vanessa's lips curled into a vicious smile. Let the perfect Mrs. Whitmore explain why her "miracle baby" was dying.

Justice, at last.
###Chapter 720

P...

Vanessa Hart lounged in her hospital bed, a smug smile playing on her lips. The baby swap had gone perfectly. A week since giving birth, and not a single Whitmore family member had bothered to visit.

During her pregnancy, Eleanor Whitmore had been ecstatic about the coming grandchild. But perhaps because Evelyn Sinclair was Vincent Black's mistress, Eleanor's attitude had shifted dramatically - she hadn't even sent anyone to inquire about the child.

Their indifference worked in Vanessa's favor. The switch had been executed flawlessly. She imagined presenting this healthy baby boy at Whitmore Manor - they'd have to adore him then.

Vanessa felt certain. But even if they didn't? It didn't matter. This was Evelyn Carter's son. And watching Evelyn's child suffer in the Whitmore household? That thought alone brought Vanessa immense satisfaction.

Alexander Whitmore paced outside the hospital for hours, his mind in turmoil. No man could simply accept that his wife had betrayed him so completely.

It wasn't just the infidelity - Evelyn had crossed an unforgivable line. Worse still, Alexander had repeatedly asked if her relationship with Ethan Caldwell was truly over. Each time, she'd sworn it was.

He'd chosen to believe her because he wanted to.

Because he'd dreamed of them becoming a real family. Now? Not only had she lied, but the child he'd eagerly awaited wasn't even his - it was Ethan's. And she'd planned to deceive him forever?

The pain twisted in Alexander's chest. "She could have been honest," he thought bitterly. "We could have talked it through. But she didn't. Doesn't that prove she never loved me? That she never cared?"

It made terrible sense. This marriage had been his idea from the start. Perhaps he'd been the only one invested. Why else would Evelyn keep pushing for divorce?

No matter how he tried to deny it, the truth cut deep - Evelyn didn't love him. The realization crushed him, each breath feeling like shards of glass in his lungs.

After over an hour wandering the hospital grounds, Alexander finally returned to the NICU when his phone rang.

The baby had a congenital heart defect requiring immediate surgery. By the time Alexander arrived, the child was already in the operating room.

Standing outside the OR, Alexander sent Simon Graves to handle payments while a nurse ushered him into an office to sign consent forms.

She handed him a thick stack of documents - mostly liability waivers that underscored the surgery's risks.

"Mr. Whitmore, please review these before signing," the nurse said. Alexander barely glanced at the papers before scrawling his signature.

The nurse, mistaking his distraction for concern, tried to reassure him. "Our top cardiac surgeon is operating. Your son couldn't be in better hands."

Alexander's gaze dropped, expression unreadable. "Mm." Once all documents were signed, the nurse collected them and left.

The procedure lasted five grueling hours. When the surgeon finally emerged, night had fallen. "The first operation succeeded," the lead surgeon said, removing his glasses as he approached Alexander. "He'll need careful post-op care and regular checkups. A second procedure will be necessary around age three."

Alexander nodded silently. The cool night air from the window seemed to finally ground him.

"Thank you, doctor."

"Just doing my job," the doctor replied politely.

A standard exchange, yet no one knew the strength it took Alexander to say those words.

This was Evelyn and Ethan's child. Most men discovering their wife bore another man's baby might wish the child dead on the operating table. That thought never crossed Alexander's mind.

Though devastated by Evelyn's betrayal, Alexander knew the child was innocent. He couldn't punish a baby for its parents' sins. No matter what, this child was part of Evelyn - and he still loved her.

"Please don't tell my wife," Alexander said solemnly. "She's recovering from childbirth and a car accident. Knowing about the heart condition would devastate her."

He understood Evelyn's attachment to the child and didn't want her worrying during recovery. Naturally, he'd prevent the doctor from sharing the diagnosis.

The doctor nodded. "Understood, Mr. Whitmore. We'll consult with you first."

Soon, the baby was wheeled from the OR straight to NICU - the emergency had prevented Alexander from even seeing his... no, Ethan's child.

Exiting the hospital, Alexander lit a cigarette. Instead of going home, he headed to Eclipse Lounge, ordering whiskey and sinking into a secluded booth.

He felt suffocated, unable to face Evelyn. How could he pretend nothing happened? Continue raising another man's child? As the boy grew, his resemblance to Ethan would only become more pronounced. How could Alexander possibly ignore that?

Mid-drink, Alexander spotted Ethan at the bar. His eyes darkened dangerously. Setting down his glass, he strode over and punched Ethan square in the jaw.

Ethan, nursing his drink, barely registered the attack before Alexander's fist connected. He nearly cursed until recognizing his assailant. "What the hell, Uncle Alex? What's your problem?"

Ethan could smell the alcohol on Alexander - the man was clearly drunk. The situation baffled him. "Uncle Alex has everything - beautiful wife, new baby, thriving career. Shouldn't he be celebrating? If anyone should be drowning sorrows, it's me with my failed marriage and struggling business."

Alexander drew back for another punch. Ethan raised his arms defensively. "At least tell me why you're attacking me!"

Ethan wracked his brain but couldn't fathom Alexander's rage. Unless... it involved Evelyn. Since that hospital confrontation where Evelyn cut ties, Ethan had kept his distance. "This is ridiculous. He's just taking out his frustrations on me. Uncle Alex must be completely wasted."

"Why?" Alexander sneered, lips curling with contempt. "You really don't know?"

How could he possibly voice this humiliation? How could he admit that the child he'd thought was his actually belonged to the man before him?
###Chapter 721

Alexander's pride wouldn't allow him to admit the truth. Ethan, still reeling from the punches, couldn't piece everything together, but he had a gut feeling—this was about Evelyn.

Realizing Alexander's anger stemmed from her, Ethan actually grinned. He tilted his face forward, taunting, "Go on, Uncle Alexander! Hit me again! Even if you beat me bloody, I'll still love Evelyn!"

The smug, almost euphoric look on Ethan's face made Alexander freeze mid-swing. A thought struck him—Did this bastard just enjoy getting punched?

Disgusted, Alexander released him. Without support, Ethan collapsed onto the couch like a limp doll. Alexander shot him one last glare before storming out.

Watching Alexander's retreating figure, Ethan's grin faded. Something was off between him and Evelyn.

That look in his eyes... It's serious. But what the hell happened?

It was past midnight when Alexander finally returned home. Evelyn lay in bed, listening to his movements outside. He'd been gone all day, and she hadn't bothered to call.

Then—a sharp crash.

She bolted upright and rushed out. The moment she opened the door, her gaze locked onto his hand—blood dripped from his palm, staining his skin crimson. Shattered glass littered the floor.

The living room was dark, but she guessed he'd been reaching for water and knocked the glass over. Her chest tightened as she grabbed the first aid kit. "Since when are you this clumsy?"

As she approached, the heavy scent of alcohol hit her. He'd been drinking—and not just a little.

She bit her lip, staying silent as she tended to his wound. His mind seemed foggy, distant, weighed down by something unspoken.

Alexander sank onto the couch, letting her work. Just yesterday, she'd been ice-cold toward him. Now, here she was, patching him up. He should've been grateful, but—

Her touch was gentle as she plucked out the glass shards and disinfected the cut. Thankfully, it wasn't deep.

The clock ticked past 1 a.m. Alexander rarely came home this late, even during his busiest days.

Evelyn finally broke the silence. "Who were you drinking with?"

"No one." His voice was low, strained. "Just me."

Her eyes flickered to his scraped knuckles—he'd been in a fight. Alexander wasn't the type to brawl. Unease coiled in her stomach. "What happened?"

He leaned back, shirt half-unbuttoned, his gaze hazy with alcohol. "Nothing."

The curt reply left her feeling suffocated. Sensing his mood, she didn't push further, quietly finishing the bandaging.

Then, out of nowhere, he spoke again. "Evelyn... is there something you need to tell me?"

He didn't look at her. Instead, he covered his eyes with one hand, as if drowning in some unbearable grief.

Her breath hitched. Had she missed something? She studied him carefully. "What do you mean?"

A beat of silence. Then—"About the baby."

Her pulse spiked. "Is something wrong?"

She'd called the doctor earlier, but there'd been no reply. Now, with Alexander gone all day, dread crept in. Did something happen to the baby?

"The baby's fine." His words eased the knot in her chest.

Seeing her worry so plainly, Alexander looked away. He couldn't tell her about the heart condition—not yet. Not when it would destroy her.

When she stayed silent, he stood abruptly. "It's late. Get some rest." He turned toward the study.

Evelyn stared after him, unsettled. Something was wrong—she could feel it.

Alexander had always been attentive, but since their return, he'd been more—cooking for her, making the house feel like a sanctuary, all to help her recover.

She wasn't ungrateful. She'd wanted to observe him longer. But tonight, his demeanor had shifted too drastically.

Her feet moved before she could stop herself. "Alexander? What's going on?"

He paused, then turned. The wind howled outside, rattling the windows. But in his eyes, she was the only warmth in the freezing night.

His fingers twitched. "Evelyn... are you hiding something from me?"

Her mind flashed to the Brookstone College of Music application—the video interview tomorrow. She hadn't mentioned it yet. It wasn't certain, so why bring it up?

But that split-second hesitation was enough.

Alexander's expression darkened. That pause confirmed it—she was keeping secrets. A bitter smirk twisted his lips.

Suddenly, he grabbed her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. Without warning, his lips crashed onto hers, pinning her wrists against the wall.

His voice was raw, almost broken. "Why hide it from me? Do I mean nothing to you? Am I just a fool for you to play with?"

The pain in his eyes was unbearable.

Outside, the wind roared back to life.
###Chapter 722

Alexander's passionate kiss consumed Evelyn completely, leaving no space for protest. Backlit by the hallway lights, his imposing silhouette engulfed her, pulling her into what felt like an endless vortex of desire and despair.

His heated breath scorched her neck in ragged bursts. The contrast between her flushed cheeks and the cold wall pressing against her back sent electric shocks through her nervous system.

Though his lips claimed hers fiercely, Evelyn sensed an ocean of sorrow radiating from Alexander's every touch.

He accused her of deception, yet she couldn't comprehend his meaning. When she tried shoving him away, his grip only tightened, his kiss turning savage - as if unleashing months of pent-up frustration through each bruising contact. The situation escalated dangerously fast. When his large hand slipped beneath her blouse, tracing the curve of her waist, panic jolted through her.

Evelyn slapped him hard. "I just had a baby, Alexander! Have you lost your mind?" Teeth sinking into her lower lip, she shot him a venomous glare before fleeing to their bedroom.

The sharp sting of her palm sobered Alexander slightly. Standing alone in the dim corridor, he blinked in momentary confusion.

He'd never intended to go that far - Evelyn was still recovering from childbirth. But the alcohol had blurred his judgment tonight.

His gaze drifted to the locked door. In different circumstances, he would've followed immediately with apologies. But exhaustion and intoxication weighted his limbs. After a heavy pause, he turned toward his study instead.

Meanwhile, Evelyn pressed her ear against the door, anticipating his pursuit. She expected his usual coaxing, his tender reassurances. But minutes passed with only retreating footsteps and silence.

Frowning, she cracked the door open. The study light glowed, but the hallway stood empty.

A pang of disappointment struck her chest. Just as moisture gathered in her eyes, her phone buzzed urgently.

Overseas, it was daytime - the scheduled hour for her Brookstone College of Music interview.

She changed into professional attire and booted up her laptop. When the video call connected, several distinguished faces appeared - all renowned musicians she recognized instantly. Nervous excitement replaced her earlier melancholy.

The intensive interview lasted over an hour. Thanks to her international schooling at Hawthorne Estate, Evelyn conversed fluently. By 3 AM, exhausted, she collapsed into dreamless sleep.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains when she awoke. Alexander's absence was palpable - no breakfast tray, just Giselle's simple meal preparation. A dull ache settled in Evelyn's chest as she dressed.

Last night's interview had gone well, with results due in a week - perfect timing as her recovery period ended.

Concern for Dominic Powell nagged at her. She hadn't performed his medical acupuncture in days. Worse, yesterday's attempts to contact her son's doctor had failed until midnight, when a terse message finally arrived claiming the baby was stable. But instinct told her something was wrong.

Her plans to visit the hospital were interrupted by Oliver Hayes's arrival. "What are you doing outside during confinement?" her brother demanded. "Where's Alexander? Shouldn't he be with you?"

"He left early," Evelyn murmured.

Oliver's scowl deepened. "Again? First he wasn't there during your accident, now he's abandoning you postpartum? What kind of husband does that?"

Though Alexander had won Oliver over months ago with extravagant gifts, family loyalty came first. Evelyn simply lowered her eyes.

She'd noticed Alexander's strange behavior last night but hadn't pressed. "Titan Capital must be keeping him busy," she offered weakly.

Oliver huffed but dropped the subject. "Where are you headed? I'll drive you."

At the hospital, Evelyn went straight to her son's physician, demanding to see him. But unlike previous visits, the doctor refused point-blank.

"Why the change?" Evelyn pressed. "I visited just days ago!"

The truth was complicated - the infant had undergone emergency cardiac surgery yesterday and remained under intensive monitoring. Bound by Alexander's orders, the doctor merely said, "He's undergoing treatment. Come back in a few days."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. "What treatment? Is there a problem?"

"Just routine checks," the doctor assured too quickly. "His recovery progresses well."

The hollow reassurance did nothing to ease Evelyn's growing dread. Something was terribly wrong - she could feel it in her bones.
###Chapter 723

Evelyn felt a pang of disappointment when she realized her brother Oliver wasn't by her side. "Don't overthink it," she reassured herself. "The doctor's just being cautious with my nephew. Soon enough, the little one will be home where he belongs."

She nodded, deciding to trust the medical professionals. Since she needed to perform acupuncture on Dominic later, having Oliver around would be inconvenient. "I've got an appointment," she told him. "Why don't you explore the hospital for a while?"

Oliver shrugged and bid her farewell. As he turned to leave, his attention glued to his phone screen, he collided with a young woman.

"Ouch!" The girl rubbed her forehead, glaring up at him. "Do you have any idea how long it took to style these bangs?" Grace's complaint died on her lips as she got a proper look at the striking man before her.

Her breath caught. There was something hauntingly familiar about his chiseled features, though she couldn't place where she'd seen him before. Her pulse quickened as she found herself momentarily speechless.

Oliver, finally looking up from his device, offered a casual apology. "My bad. Want me to cover your salon bill? Or I can just compensate you directly."

Grace's mind went blank. An inexplicable magnetic pull seemed to draw her to this stranger. She'd always scoffed at the idea of love at first sight - until this moment. Heat flooded her cheeks as she fidgeted with the strap of her purse.

She'd come to the hospital after Vanessa's dramatic phone call, complaining that no one from the Whitmore family had visited since the birth. While Grace had little sympathy for her stepsister, the newborn deserved attention. She never expected to literally run into destiny on her way to the nursery.

Oliver's words became background noise as she studied his face - the strong jawline, the way his dark hair fell slightly over his forehead. He tilted his head, studying her flushed face. "You okay? I bumped your head, not your face. Why are you so red?"

Before she could respond, he reached out and pinched her cheek experimentally. "Hmm, soft. Doesn't seem injured."

Grace's heart threatened to beat out of her chest. The unexpected contact sent electric sparks through her nervous system. "It's nothing serious," she managed. "No compensation needed."

Completely oblivious, Oliver simply nodded. "Cool. Later then." He turned to leave.

Panic surged through Grace. In a city this size, she might never see him again. "Wait!" she blurted.

Oliver turned, one eyebrow arched. "Yeah?"

Grace's mind raced for an excuse. "What if... I develop complications later?" Even as the words left her mouth, she cringed internally. What kind of ridiculous excuse was that?

A knowing smirk played on Oliver's lips as he recognized her transparent ploy. "Oh? What do you propose then?"

"Give me your WhatsApp!" Grace demanded, then immediately wanted to vanish from embarrassment. Her cheeks burned as she fumbled for her phone, unable to meet his amused gaze.

Oliver chuckled deeply. "Asking for my number? Don't tell me it was love at first sight?"

Grace's denial came too quickly. "Of course not! I just... for medical reasons."

"Interesting," Oliver mused. "Just returned from abroad actually. Don't have WhatsApp set up yet. But here's my sister's number - she can relay messages."

Grace's brow furrowed as she input the digits. The profile that appeared showed a shirtless man with sculpted abs against a black background - hardly what she expected for a sister's account. A quick Instagram check revealed recent posts from a local café she frequented, tagged with a muscular forearm beside a coffee cup captioned "Decent brew."

Realization dawned. She'd been played. By the time she looked up, Oliver had disappeared into the hospital corridors. Staring at the profile picture, Grace wondered - were those really his abs? The thought sent fresh heat to her face.

Alexander arrived at Titan Capital Group before dawn. Year-end meant endless meetings and paperwork. Recent events had left his desk buried under unsigned documents. After powering through dozens before lunch, he massaged his temples.

Sleep had eluded him last night. He'd just closed his eyes for a quick nap when the hospital called. "Is there a problem with the baby?" he asked immediately.

"Your wife came by demanding to see the child," the doctor explained. "I denied access as instructed."

Alexander exhaled slowly. "How's the baby's condition?"

"Recovering remarkably well. Stronger than we anticipated. With continued progress, discharge in about a month seems likely."

Relief washed over Alexander. Despite Evelyn's betrayal, he genuinely cared for the child's wellbeing. Some wounds ran too deep for quick healing, but innocence deserved protection.
###Chapter 724

The moment Alexander ended the call, his phone rang again.

Fatefully, it was another call from the hospital.

"Are you Mr. Whitmore? Family of Ms. Morgan?"

Alexander's voice softened. "What happened?"

"Ms. Morgan has regained consciousness after leaving ICU. She's extremely frail but stable now. She traced letters on my palm - seems to be asking for you."

Isabella had been in a coma for over two weeks. Doctors had warned she might never wake up if unconscious beyond three days.

Alexander grabbed his coat and strode out. "I'm on my way."

By the time he finished speaking, he was already exiting the building.

The general ward smelled of antiseptic and medicine.

Isabella lay motionless, an oxygen mask obscuring half her ghostly pale face from blood loss.

Her fingers twitched when Alexander entered. Her gaze locked onto him with desperate intensity.

The nurses had told her - he was the one who saved her that night.

Alexander approached the bed.

Relief washed over him seeing her awake. "Thank God you're conscious. You need rest."

"Alexander..." Her voice emerged as a painful rasp.

Weeks without solid food left her lips cracked, throat burning like shards of glass with every word.

He immediately reached for the water, dabbing moisture onto her parched lips.

Alexander wasn't alone.

Police officers had maintained constant vigil - she was both victim and key witness in an unsolved case.

Seeing her alert, one officer stepped forward. "Ms. Morgan, can you describe what happened that night? Who attacked you?"

Isabella shook her head weakly.

"I... don't remember."

"Complete memory loss?" The officer's eyebrows shot up.

She wasn't lying.

The human brain sometimes erases traumatic events as self-protection. Isabella genuinely recalled nothing beyond the agony and missing kidney.

Even her attacker's face had vanished from her mind.

The attending physician explained, "Post-traumatic stress disorder. Memory suppression can be beneficial - otherwise those nightmares would haunt her perpetually."

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Permanently?"

"Not necessarily." The doctor hedged. "Certain triggers might restore those memories someday."

With no leads from Isabella, the police reluctantly departed.

Alexander sent an assistant for broth - the only nourishment her ravaged system could handle now.

Though the memories were gone, the crushing despair remained. Her eyes reflected hollow emptiness.

Surviving this ordeal had been pure luck.

Alexander had intended to go easy on her, given the horrific price she'd paid.

Yet one question burned in his mind.

"Sebastian visited multiple times during your coma." His voice turned icy. "What's your relationship?"

He'd stationed guards who reported Sebastian's covert visits.

Isabella froze. Her lips parted soundlessly.

The truth was worse than Alexander knew - not just a stolen kidney, but a lost pregnancy. He must have seen the medical reports.

Her silence stretched.

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Are you in love with him?"

"Never!" Her denial came sharp and instant. "I despise him!"

She clutched Alexander's sleeve. "That night after leaving your estate, I encountered Sebastian. He took me to his villa and then..."

Alexander's face darkened like thunder. "He forced himself on you? That's rape! I'll make sure he rots in prison!"

His mind reeled. Engaged to Dominic yet violated by his brother?

"No!" Isabella cut in desperately. "It's humiliating. Please, let it go."

"After all you've suffered?" Disbelief colored his voice. He'd always treated her like a sister - this violation couldn't stand.

"I want nothing more to do with the Powells." Her eyes lowered. "Even if prosecuted, he'd get minimal jail time. If you truly wish to help, dissolve my engagement with Dominic."

The attack had left her half-crippled, altering everything except one certainty - she'd never marry into that poisonous family.

Alexander exhaled heavily. "Done. But on one condition."

She looked up.

"You need rehabilitation. I've arranged a specialized facility abroad. Once stable, you'll go."

He'd suggested this before - had she listened, she might still have both kidneys.

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes.

Though out of ICU, weakness plagued every limb. Simple movements exhausted her.

The jagged scar across her abdomen would remain forever - a lifelong reminder.

Suddenly, fragmented bloody images flashed behind her eyelids.

Her lips trembled as emotions overwhelmed her. The doctor was right - forgotten memories could resurface without warning.

For years to come, this trauma would shadow her existence.

Tears spilled over. "I'll go."

Her rabbit-red eyes and fragile demeanor seemed moments from shattering.

"But... may I have one hug?"

Alexander's heart clenched at her brokenness. He knew every ounce of pain she'd endured.

Gently, he patted her back. "Don't dwell on it. Rest now."

Isabella leaned into his chest, sobbing uncontrollably.

Beyond the doorway, Evelyn stood frozen, eyes rimmed red.

After treating Dominic with acupuncture, she'd considered going home.

Yet concern for Isabella's prolonged coma drew her here instead.

To witness Alexander embracing another woman.

So this was his early morning destination - not the office, but Isabella's bedside.

Evelyn turned away silently, disappearing down the sterile hallway.
###Chapter 725
The drive home felt endless for Evelyn.

Alexander's actions today only solidified her decision to end their marriage.

With Isabella awake now, Evelyn believed everything would be fine.
She couldn't bear the thought of Isabella constantly caught between them.
Letting go was the only solution.

The interview results arrived unexpectedly fast.
Perhaps yesterday's conversation had gone exceptionally well.
The moment she stepped through the door, the acceptance email from the conservatory glowed on her screen.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she reread the letter three times.
The heavy disappointment in her chest dissolved into quiet exhilaration.

Her phone buzzed. Natalie's name flashed across the screen.

"You got the email?"

Evelyn exhaled softly. "How did you know, Natalie?"

The warmth in Natalie's voice carried through the line. "I'm close with the admissions committee. I personally submitted your materials. They were impressed by your musicality during the interview. When the decision was finalized, I received word immediately."

Evelyn hadn't realized Natalie had been monitoring her application.
In her musical journey, Natalie had always been her guiding light.
Gratitude swelled in Evelyn's throat.

Orientation began in four weeks—around the time her son would be released from neonatal care.
But before then, there were mountains to move.

Alexander arrived home long after sunset.

Evelyn sat at the dining table, sipping Giselle's delicate bone broth.
The moment he entered, her eyes flickered toward him before returning to her spoon.

The cello case on the sofa caught Alexander's attention immediately.

Surprise flickered across his features. "You're playing again? So soon after delivery?"

Because she'd be leaving soon to study cello abroad.

Evelyn set down her spoon. Her gaze lingered on the instrument.
This cello had been Alexander's gift.

During Titan Capital's gala last year, he'd purchased this professional-grade instrument from Natalie so she could practice for her department's performance.
Little did she know that transaction would intertwine her fate with Natalie's.

Only twelve months had passed, yet it felt like another lifetime.
So much had changed.
They'd gone from strangers to lovers in this fleeting year.

Fate could be cruelly ironic.

"Just keeping my fingers nimble," she murmured.
She didn't mention the divorce papers hidden upstairs.

Alexander shrugged off his coat, his movements fluid.
Seeing her nearly empty bowl, his lips curved. At least her appetite had returned.

Evelyn studied his face. "You're late."

He never missed dinner with her. Until today.

"Emergency at the office."

"Is that so?" Her voice was distant.
She'd seen him holding Isabella's hand at the hospital.
Yet here he was, lying straight to her face.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered downward. The ache was unbearable.

She'd loved him. They had a child together.
Just days ago, he'd pleaded for their family's wholeness, and she'd hesitated.

Now...

She asked no further questions.
No arguments.
Only the cello's mournful cry as she played "The Swan's Lament."

Alexander recognized the sorrow woven through each note.
The melody dragged him into its melancholy embrace.
His chest constricted painfully.

As the final note faded, Evelyn sat motionless, her eyes glistening.

Alexander crossed to her. "What's wrong?"

Her delicate skin flushed pink from emotion.
With her red-rimmed eyes and slight frame, she looked heartbreakingly fragile.

Evelyn shook her head. A single tear escaped.
"The piece... it overwhelmed me."

Alexander crushed her against his chest. His thumb brushed away her tears.
"Then play something happier next time."

Evelyn inhaled sharply.
The scent of hospital antiseptic clung to his clothes.
Hours earlier, he'd held Isabella exactly like this.

She said nothing.
Some lies deserved dignified silence.

"I won't play it again." Gently, she extricated herself. "Finish your dinner. I need to rest."

Alexander reached for her as his phone rang.
One missed moment—and she was already climbing the stairs.

He had come from the office.
His hospital visit had been brief before urgent matters demanded his attention.
Perhaps the accident had matured Isabella—she'd released him without protest when he mentioned work.

Their conversation had been clear. He saw her only as a sister.
Isabella had simply nodded, mentioning rehabilitation abroad.

Simon's voice crackled through the phone. "Mr. Whitmore, the meeting minutes are ready. But the London trip—"

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Evelyn just delivered. Push it back two weeks."

Simon calculated quickly. "Shall we schedule for fortnight from now?"

That would give Evelyn time to recover.
And coincide with Isabella's planned transfer to the London sanatorium.

"Confirmed."

As he hung up, the cello's lament echoed in his mind.
He finally recalled the piece's meaning—a swan abandoned by the world.

Why had Evelyn chosen that particular song tonight?
###Chapter 726

Evelyn's gaze lingered on the empty crib.

Her son wouldn't get to sleep in it after all.

Once he recovered, she'd take him far away from here.

She scanned the bedroom - every piece of furniture chosen together during happier times with Alexander.

The walk-in closet overflowed with designer dresses, half of them gifts from her husband.

Evelyn grabbed a suitcase and began methodically packing her belongings.

These luxuries had no place in her new life abroad. If she was leaving, she'd leave completely.

Room by room, she'd erase all traces of herself from this mansion.

Making space for Alexander's next wife.

A man like him wouldn't stay single for long.

The cello piece she'd played earlier had been her silent goodbye.

Not that he'd understood its significance.

Perhaps Isabella had been right all along - Evelyn was the interloper in their childhood romance.

Tears pricked her eyes as she zipped the final suitcase.

Footsteps echoed in the hallway - Alexander returning from dinner.

Evelyn quickly switched off the closet light and stepped out just as the door opened.

"Evelyn, Isabella's awake." Alexander's voice was carefully neutral.

Her breath hitched at the unexpected mention. "How is she?"

"Not well. The doctors say she's clinically depressed. That night... it broke her. I'm arranging for her to recuperate overseas in two weeks."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. Two weeks? Exactly when she planned to leave.

"Are you going with her?" Her voice barely above a whisper.

"Just to drop her off. I have meetings in London."

She studied the carpet. "You should spend time with her before then."

Alexander's brows furrowed at her unusual compliance.

Something felt off.

He searched her face for clues, but found only practiced calm.

Evelyn avoided his gaze. "It's late. Will you be working in the study tonight?"

"No." His jaw tightened. "I'll sleep here."

They lay inches apart yet worlds away.

Evelyn now understood the true meaning of sharing a bed but not a heart.

Alexander watched the rise and fall of her shoulders, hand hovering uncertainly.

He'd waited days for her to confess about the baby.

Her silence spoke volumes.

Would she really let him raise another man's child?

Frustration burned in his chest as he suddenly pulled her against him.

His kiss was desperate, aching with unspoken questions.

"Evelyn," he whispered against her lips, "did you ever love me?"

Once, she would have answered without hesitation.

Now, she simply deepened the kiss, fingers tangling in his hair.

Alexander's breath hitched. Her evasion was answer enough.

"Tell me you love me," he pleaded, voice raw. "Just say it."

For the first time, the mighty Alexander Whitmore sounded broken.

One word, and he'd forgive everything - raise another man's child, pretend their marriage wasn't crumbling.

But Evelyn only sighed. "We should sleep."

The gulf between them yawned wider.

She remembered the hospital visit, how they'd barred her from seeing her son.

Alexander's orders.

Was this his twisted way to control her? Keep her from leaving?

Dawn found Alexander's side of the bed empty.

Evelyn wasn't surprised.

She finished packing the remaining clothes, then called Oliver.

"Need you to take these to Hawthorne Estate," she said when he arrived.

Oliver's eyes widened at the luggage. "Running away?"

"Yes."

"Does Alexander know?"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "He won't notice."

Oliver's expression darkened. Alexander's recent absences spoke volumes.

"You just had a baby! Where the hell is he?"

Evelyn thought of yesterday - Alexander holding Isabella's hand at the hospital.

"Someone more important needed him," she murmured.

Oliver's fist clenched. "That bitch Isabella? I'll kill him!"

Evelyn caught his arm. "Don't. Just help me with these."

"Come home, Evelyn. We'll raise the kid together."

"I'm not going home."

"Then where?"

"Got accepted to a music conservatory abroad. Taking my son. Don't tell anyone."

Oliver exhaled sharply. "Good. When do you leave?"

"Two weeks."

Just enough time to finalize everything before the semester began.
###Chapter 727

The following days passed in quiet routine.

Alexander left early each morning, returning late with excuses about urgent business at Titan Capital Group. Occasionally, he brought small gifts for Evelyn—sometimes her favorite desserts, sometimes delicate trinkets for their home.

She accepted them all without protest.

It was better this way. His absence meant he wouldn’t notice she had already moved her most important belongings out of Whitmore Manor.

At the office, Alexander found himself staring at a photograph of Evelyn and himself, lost in thought.

It struck him suddenly—they hadn’t had a proper date in months.

Not since the accident. Not since the birth of their son.

An invisible wall had risen between them, one he didn’t know how to breach.

Simon entered quietly. "Mr. Whitmore, your flight to England has been confirmed. You and Ms. Morgan depart in a week."

Alexander blinked, refocusing. "What has Evelyn been doing at home lately?"

Every evening, she retreated to her room the moment he returned.

She still smiled when he handed her gifts, but the warmth never reached her eyes.

"Mrs. Whitmore has been reorganizing her wardrobe," Simon replied. "She packed several bags of clothing for donation last week."

Alexander nodded. Evelyn had always supported the local orphanage. Nothing unusual there.

"Move the meeting up. I want to return home early tonight."

"Understood."

Just then, Lucas stormed in.

The scent of whiskey clung to him as he slumped into a chair, gripping Alexander’s arm.

"Why couldn’t I keep her? She didn’t even take Bella. Just—gone."

Alexander didn’t need to ask who he meant. Claire.

Simon discreetly excused himself, shutting the door behind him.

Alexander frowned at Lucas’s disheveled state. "Explain."

"Today was supposed to be her day with Bella. I waited. She never showed."

Lucas dragged a hand through his hair. "Her phone was off. Hours later, I found out she’d already boarded a flight to Cresthaven!"

His voice cracked. "She said she was chasing her career. No warning. No goodbye. I’m still Bella’s father—how could she just abandon her?"

But Lucas wasn’t entirely truthful.

Claire had mentioned Cresthaven before. She’d intended to take Bella.

Lucas had fought her on it, believing she’d never leave without their daughter.

Yet here they were.

Alexander was surprised.

From what he’d observed, Lucas and Claire had grown closer since Bella’s birth. Their divorce negotiations had even softened.

He’d assumed Lucas could change her mind.

But she was gone.

Lucas slumped forward, voice hollow. "Bella is her child. Does she hate me so much she’d rather abandon her than stay?"

Alexander rested a hand on his shoulder. "Maybe it’s temporary. Cresthaven is unfamiliar—no friends, no family. When the novelty fades, she might return."

Lucas shook his head violently. "She knows someone there. Max Harrison. Old friends. He convinced her!"

The implication hung between them.

Alexander’s thoughts darkened.

Did Evelyn know about this?

Had she encouraged Claire to leave?

Dominic’s recovery progressed steadily.

That afternoon, as Evelyn finished his acupuncture session, she said, "I’ll be traveling soon. You’ve improved enough that daily treatments aren’t necessary. I’ll leave a prescription—"

Dominic’s gaze sharpened. "Traveling? Where? For how long?"

Evelyn avoided his eyes. "Indefinitely. Nathaniel can prepare the herbs for you."

Dominic studied her for a long moment before smirking. "You’re running away."

Evelyn stiffened.

He laughed, stretching lazily. Water droplets trailed down his throat, glistening against his bare chest.

"Lucky for you," he purred, "I’m due for a change of scenery. I’ll join you."

Evelyn recoiled. "Absolutely not."

Dominic caught her wrist, his grip firm. "You think Alexander will let you vanish with his son that easily?"

His thumb brushed her pulse point. "Tell him you’re leaving for me. Let him direct his anger at me instead."

His grin turned wicked. "Well, Evelyn? Should we act?"
###Chapter 728

Evelyn hesitated for only a brief moment before rejecting Dominic's offer. The reason was simple—she already owed him too much.

Favors were the most dangerous currency.

She refused to complicate their relationship further.

When Dominic heard her firm refusal, his gaze darkened instantly.

Even after ending things with Alexander, Evelyn still didn't consider him.

Dominic refused to accept that.

He was determined to win her over.

Seeing the resolve in Dominic's eyes, Nathaniel quietly reminded him, "Mr. Powell, Mrs. Whitmore has left." After a long pause, Dominic finally looked away.

He rubbed his chin thoughtfully and suddenly asked, "Who's more handsome—me or Alexander?"

Nathaniel nearly choked. Why is Mr. Powell comparing himself to another man out of nowhere?

He wanted to say Dominic was more attractive.

But Alexander had striking, chiseled features that stood out effortlessly in any crowd. Nathaniel couldn't bring himself to lie.

"You have completely different styles," Nathaniel said diplomatically. "Each of you has your own appeal."

Dominic frowned, clearly dissatisfied with the answer.

"Then if you were a woman choosing a husband, who would you pick?"

Nathaniel nearly groaned. Alexander is far more reliable in personality.

But upon reflection, Dominic wasn't entirely a bad choice either.

He might seem reckless, but he was fiercely loyal.

Once Dominic loved someone, he never wavered. He would give everything—even his life—for that person.

Most people saw Dominic as ruthless and unpredictable.

But Nathaniel knew better.

Dominic had never known warmth, so he never showed kindness to others.

Evelyn had been the only light in his barren existence.

That was why he had opened his heart to her.

Nathaniel met Dominic's gaze. "Mr. Powell, of course I'd choose you!"

Dominic smirked. "Good to know. But I'm not interested in you."

Nathaniel scratched his head sheepishly.

Evelyn didn't leave the hospital.

She went to the self-service kiosk in the lobby and printed out her son's recent medical records.

What she found chilled her to the bone.

Her son might have a serious condition.

Her pharmacology knowledge allowed her to recognize the prescribed medications—many were for heart disease.

When her son was first admitted, the doctors had assured her it was a minor issue that would resolve with time.

So why had it worsened after a month in the hospital?

She needed to see him immediately—to check his pulse and confirm her suspicions.

She lingered outside the neonatal unit until her son's attending physician appeared.

Without revealing she'd seen the records, Evelyn asked, "Doctor, when can my son be discharged?"

The baby had shown remarkable improvement lately, with medication dosages decreasing.

The surgery had been successful.

Relieved to see Evelyn, the doctor relaxed. "Just a few more tests, and you can take him home soon."

"Can I see him now?"

The doctor hesitated, then nodded. "But you'll need to sterilize first."

Evelyn agreed.

Finally, she would see her son again.

It had been a month. Babies changed so quickly—she barely recognized him.

After donning protective gear, Evelyn entered. A nurse carried her son to a private room.

At first glance, something felt wrong.

Though newborns often looked similar, Evelyn had studied her son's photos daily. This baby looks nothing like him.

Her eyes darted to the baby's right ear.

Her son had a distinct mole there. This child didn't.

Evelyn's pulse spiked. What's happening? Could the hospital have switched the babies?

She checked the ankle bracelet—it clearly read Evelyn's son.

But the birthmark was gone.

Birthmarks don't just vanish.

Evelyn pursed her lips, studying the baby's face.

He did resemble her slightly.

Silently, she took a photo and compared it to her earlier ones.

No matter how she analyzed them, they were not the same child.

Only one explanation made sense.

She and Vanessa shared the same father but different mothers—hence the slight resemblance.

This baby wasn't hers. He was Vanessa's.

Evelyn trembled with rage.

Vanessa had stolen her son right under everyone's noses!

Twenty years ago, Vanessa had replaced her as the Hayes heiress, reaping every privilege.

Now she's trying the same trick—stealing my child?

How dare she?

The medication list suggested this baby had severe heart issues.

Did Vanessa swap them because her own son was dying?

Or was this about revenge?

Vanessa's marriage to Ethan was crumbling. She was desperate in the Caldwell family.

Stealing Evelyn's son could secure her position.

Worse—she could mold him into a weapon.

Evelyn broke into a cold sweat.

Vanessa is pure evil.

This was a calculated, two-for-one scheme.

She knew Vanessa would raise her son to hate her.

When he grew up, Vanessa would revel in watching mother and son become enemies.

Monster.

The baby in the crib suddenly wailed.

Evelyn stared at Vanessa's son.

She didn't know how Vanessa had pulled off the switch.

But the children were innocent pawns in her game.

Gently, Evelyn soothed the crying infant.

He was painfully thin—abandoned by his own mother days after birth.

She wouldn't punish him for Vanessa's sins.

Under her touch, the baby gradually calmed and drifted back to sleep.
