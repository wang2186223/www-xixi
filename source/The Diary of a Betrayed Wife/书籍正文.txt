####Chapter 1

After losing passion with my husband, I asked my best friend to help me relax.

Little did I know she would take me to an unusual club.

That night became an experience I would never forget for the rest of my life.
-------
Yesterday, I had a fierce argument with my husband.

The reason was his inappropriate closeness with a colleague.

He is an executive at an international trade company.

Young, capable, tall, and handsome.

There are many women around him with ulterior motives.

Because of this, I have lost count of how many times we have argued.

Yesterday, on a whim, I brought lunch to his office.

I happened to see a woman with a hot body.

She used the excuse of delivering documents.

Wearing a halterneck dress, she leaned over his shoulder, posing seductively.

My temper flared, and I started arguing with him.

The end result was a unpleasant parting.

That night, my husband did not come home.

He always uses this trick after every argument.

I was shaking with anger but had nowhere to vent.

On a sudden impulse, I went to my best friend's house.

I never expected that this impulsive decision would change the course of my life.

My best friend is Wendy Lowell.

We are very close.

We know each other's door lock passwords.

I called her first, but no one answered.

I thought she was already asleep.

So I went to her house without notifying her.

When I arrived, I used the password to open the security door with ease.

Just as I reached the center of the living room, I heard soft, breathy moans coming from her bedroom.

Hearing the sounds, I was confused.

Isn't Liam on a business trip for a year?

How could he be back so soon?

Then a strange thought suddenly popped into my head.

Wendy is cheating!

I found myself walking to the bedroom door.

Through the slightly open door, I saw two bodies entangled together.

The male body was young and fit.

His broad, strong arms gripped Wendy's slender waist tightly.

Her fair, glowing skin intertwined with his chocolate-colored body.

Accompanied by the sound of fierce collision, I stood there blushing, rooted to the spot.

Wendy really is cheating!

And she actually found a young guy!

Such things, I only dare to fantasize about when I'm lonely.

But beyond the embarrassment, I realized that what I felt more was desire.

After so many years of marriage, I have never experienced a woman's pleasure.

Intimate moments between us were always rushed.

Deep down, I also yearn for a young, strong man to let loose with...

Just as I was engrossed, a door opened from the direction of the bathroom behind me.

Then came a startled voice.

"Who's there?"

My thoughts were quickly pulled back.

The sounds of passion inside the room abruptly stopped.

Wendy and the man inside both turned to look.

...

"I... didn't mean to. I called you, but you didn't answer, so I..."

I was somewhat awkward, stammering an explanation to Wendy.

To my surprise, she waved it off dismissively.

She sent the two young men away from the room.

Then, as if nothing had happened, she pulled me onto the sofa to chat.

"Had another fight with Ethan?"

She looked completely unfazed.

Seeing that she didn't seem to mind what I had just witnessed, I breathed a sigh of relief.

I immediately poured out all my grievances.

To my surprise, after listening, she rolled her eyes at me with disdain.

"If he's fooling around outside, why can't you find someone else?"

Under my shocked gaze, she suddenly started introducing me to the two young men from earlier.

She said they were private fitness trainers.

I've heard of that profession.

It's just using fitness as a pretext for intimate transactions.

So at first, I didn't agree.

Unexpectedly, Wendy, upon hearing this, boldly showed me a video she had taken.

In the video, she lay flat on a soft hotel bed.

Beside her feet, several shirtless muscular men were kissing her feet...

Hearing Wendy's increasingly heavy breathing, I lowered my head in embarrassment.

...

It would be a lie to say I wasn't tempted.

But after all, I am an educated adult.

Such morally questionable actions made it hard for me to convince myself.

"No... I'm a married woman. If Ethan finds out..."

"You care so much about Ethan, but does he ever consider you?"

Wendy impatiently cut me off.

Then she grabbed my hand.

"Chloe, I can't stand your hesitation. Come out with me right now!"

That night, I half-heartedly put on the clothes Wendy prepared for me.

Then she took me to a KTV in the city center...
####Chapter 2

After Wendy Lowell gave her name at the front desk, we were led to a private room.

The lighting inside was soft and intimate.
The decor was luxurious, resembling a five-star hotel.

Under the dim glow of the large television screen, I saw several bed-sized sofas and three men dressed in very little clothing.

They immediately surrounded us with smiling faces, politely taking our handbags.

"Hello, sisters."

Their bodies were incredibly toned, clearly from long-term training, and their faces were handsome.

They were obviously carefully selected.

This seemed to be the specialty here.
They wore only tight shorts, showcasing their powerful shoulders and well-defined abs.

Watching their impressive physiques and the suggestive lines beneath their tight clothing, I couldn't help but blush.

Youth really is something else.

Wendy had been secretly observing my reaction.
Seeing my shy expression, she smiled with satisfaction.

"Enough with the formalities," she said, pushing me firmly into the arms of one of the young men.
She winked at me playfully.

"Don't be shy. Since we're here, be bold. Stop dwelling on that unfaithful man. If needed, just each do our own thing from now on!"

"What about you, Wendy?"

After she spoke, a dark-haired young man stepped forward and grinned at her.

His skin was a deep tan. I recognized him instantly as the man from Wendy's house earlier. She had said his name was Tyler Roland.

Tyler wrapped his arm around Wendy's neck and asked, "The usual?"

"Of course, the usual."

Wendy moved closer, linking her arms around his neck.
Her eyes were seductive. "We weren't finished earlier. Let's continue now."

"Don't worry, I'll make sure you're satisfied today."

As they spoke, they suddenly began kissing as if no one else was present.

Wendy boldly pushed Tyler onto the sofa behind him, swaying her hips as she started removing her clothes.

She was truly daring.

The young man's eyes turned red with desire under her teasing.
He pushed Wendy down and pressed himself against her.

Without any restraint, they began passionately engaging right in front of us.
The once quiet room quickly filled with intimate sounds.

At the peak of passion, Wendy's fair feet tensed straight, and uncontrollable soft moans escaped her throat.

I could feel the breathing of the young man in front of me grow slightly heavier.
There was a subtle reaction beneath him as well.

"Does it excite you more when others are watching, sister?"

"Aren't you the same? I've never seen you this enthusiastic before..."

Although I am married, my intimate life has always been conventional.
Witnessing such an explicit scene and hearing the intense sounds of physical contact made my breath catch.

This was really too much...

Wendy's eyes were now dazed, her cheeks flushed.
She clearly noticed my reaction.
Suppressing fragmented moans, she turned to me and said, "See, honey? There's nothing to fear. Ethan wronged you first. Doesn't that allow you to do the same?"

After speaking, her shapely legs tightly wrapped around Tyler's waist.

"Darling, let's go to the inner room. I want to use the intimate accessories."

"Anything you say, sister."

Tyler lifted her up, glanced at the young man beside me, and then the three of them disappeared into an adjoining suite.

Shortly after the door closed, Wendy's excited cries could be heard from inside.

Hearing their movements, Parker Evans, who had been holding me, finally spoke.

"Sister, would you like to relax here first? Or should we go straight inside?"

As he spoke, his hands naturally settled on my hips.
His scorching body temperature sent a shiver through me.

"I... I don't know."

I nervously lowered my head, too embarrassed to look at him.

Parker chuckled softly at my reaction.

"Sister, you're so gentle. It must be your first time here, and you're shy. How about... we go directly to the private room?"

Even a fool could understand the implication in his words.
My face flushed red again, betraying my embarrassment.

But this time, I didn't refuse.

"Mhm."
####Chapter 3

The private room was exquisitely designed for seduction.
Warm golden lights focused on the circular bed draped with sheer curtains.
A full-length mirror stood directly opposite the bed.
It offered a perfect view of everything that would happen on that bed.

Several pieces of La Perla lingerie were arranged on the sheets.
Ethan had never introduced such pleasures into our marriage.
My heart raced as I imagined what was to come.

Parker noticed my nervousness and pulled me into his arms.
"Your heart is beating so fast, sister."
"Don't be nervous."
"Just think of me as your young boyfriend."

His initiative broke down my remaining resistance.
I turned and buried myself in his embrace.
His physique reminded me of my first lover from younger days.
The firmness of his body stirred long-forgotten desires.

I hadn't experienced such youthful energy since marrying Ethan.

"Do you like my pecs, sister?"
Parker whispered against my ear while kissing it gently.
"But my six-pack abs are even better."
"Would you like to touch them?"
"Or perhaps... explore somewhere else?"

His words grew more suggestive with each breath.
His hands began wandering across my body with increasing boldness.
I felt myself losing control yet struggled with lingering guilt.

"But I'm married."
"Is this right?"

Even now, Ethan's cold, disdainful expression haunted me.
The memory prevented me from fully surrendering to the moment.
My mind remained tangled in conflict despite our intimate position.

"Does your husband treat you well?"
Parker asked while his hand found its way to my most sensitive area.

The skillful touch made me recall Ethan's constant neglect.
"I... I don't know."

"You're making excuses for him, sister."
"If he treated you properly, you wouldn't be here."

His words struck a deep chord within me.
Suddenly all my tension and guilt found release.
I began sobbing quietly against his shoulder.

"Let me give you a massage."
"You're too tense."

"Alright."

I gradually let go of my reservations and accepted this absurd situation.
I allowed him to remove my final layer of clothing.
His hands began working their way across my body.

It was supposed to be a massage.
Yet his hands never stayed where they should.
They constantly strayed to elicit responses from me.

Just as I closed my eyes to enjoy the sensations.
Tyler's voice carried clearly from the next room.

"Put this on, sister."
"I want to try the largest size."

Wendy's delighted squeal followed immediately.
I never imagined they would use intimate accessories.
But Wendy had studied abroad and dated foreign men.
Her openness seemed natural given her background.

The rooms were separated only by thin panels.
Wendy's escalating moans echoed in my ears.
Combined with Parker's roaming hands, I quickly became aroused.
####Chapter 4

I could no longer suppress the burning desire inside me.

I threw myself at Parker Evans, our bodies entwining.

Soon, I fell into the same depths of pleasure as Wendy had.

His experience was undeniable.

He knew more techniques than I could have imagined, and I considered myself quite knowledgeable.

I had been half the campus beauty back in college.

At first, I managed to maintain some control, matching his rhythm.

But when he opened the drawer and revealed the intimate accessories—blindfolds and more—I lost all reason.

Those items were downright wicked.

Overwhelmed, I tried to shy away.

But Parker's muscular body pressed down on me, his masculine scent intoxicating.

"Just let go, sister," he whispered. "Enjoy yourself."

And so I did, until pleasure consumed me and everything went black.

In my dazed state, I felt Parker lift me and carry me out.

My mind was blank, unsure of his intentions.

I only stirred when my back met the cold surface of a table.

We were outside the private room now.

I lay on a table directly facing the window in the door.

Parker was still joined with me.

Noticing my awakening, he grinned.

"Exciting, isn't it, sister?"

"Mmm..." I buried my face in his chest, greedily inhaling his scent.

"If only my husband put in half the effort you do," I murmured, "I'd be content."

All reservations gone, I openly confessed my loneliness.

My words seemed to spur Parker on.

He held me tighter, his movements growing more intense.

As I neared another climax, I heard soft gasps nearby.

I turned my head.

Wendy and Tyler were here too, along with several other couples entangled in various corners of the room.

Their moans grew louder, soon drowning out our own.

My eyes fixed on Wendy.

Under the attention of the two younger men, she had lost all control.

Her movements and cries grew wilder by the second.

Compared to Parker, Tyler was clearly more skilled.

Watching her flushed face and dazed eyes, I imagined myself with Tyler instead.

I was sure he felt the same way.

When they had entered earlier, his gaze had lingered on me like a predator eyeing its prey.

Outwardly reserved, I secretly craved such thrilling contrasts.

But Ethan had never satisfied that part of me.

I quickly pushed the lustful thought away.

I couldn't allow myself to fall any deeper.

But Parker beneath me was already captivated by Wendy's seductive display.

He paused, holding me close as he watched them for a while.

Only after Wendy and Tyler finished did he carry me over to them.

"How about trying something new?" he suggested.

"Sure, what did you have in mind?" Tyler rose, his eyes settling on my half-conscious form.

They exchanged a knowing look.

Tyler's predatory gaze jolted me awake, my legs trembling with anticipation.

I understood their intention.

But we had only just...

I looked to Wendy for help, but she showed no objection.

Instead, she seemed excited, urging them to begin.

Not wanting to spoil their mood, I reluctantly gave in after Wendy's persistent coaxing.
####Chapter 5

We lost track of how long the madness lasted.
When I woke again, it was already afternoon.

My body felt completely wrecked.
Every part of me ached.

Wendy slept soundly beside me, seemingly unaffected.
It was as if this was entirely normal for her.

"So, babe? Good time last night?" she murmured sleepily. "Did we make up for all those years Ethan neglected you?"

My heart jumped.
I instinctively glanced around the room.
Thankfully, everyone else had already left.

"Don't say things like that in public," I whispered. "What if someone heard?"

Wendy giggled.
"Aw, you're shy now? After how wild you got? Don't think I didn't notice."

I shot her an embarrassed look.

Memories of last night's madness with her and Tyler flooded back.

At first, I couldn't handle it. I made Wendy go first.

But hearing her lose control drove me crazy with desire.

After she finished, I asked to try it myself.

The sensation pulled me under. I completely let go.
I got so wild, I think I even shocked Wendy.

To avoid this awkward topic, I got up and dressed quickly.
I needed an excuse to leave.

"I have to go. Ethan gets off in half an hour."

I'd turned my phone off last night so Ethan couldn't reach me.

When I powered it on, my heart sank.
No missed calls. No messages.

After ten years of marriage, maybe our love had truly faded.

Maybe that was for the best. It saved me from explaining.

Ethan was already home when I arrived.

He greeted me with a rare smile, took my bag, and guided me to the sofa.

"Honey, great news. That project I've been working on for six months is finally closing. Payment comes in a month. But I'll be traveling non-stop until then. I'm sorry you'll be alone."

He pulled a gift box from behind him.

"I've been buried in work. I neglected you and your feelings. I'm sorry. This is that bag you wanted. I had a friend bring it back from Paris. Please don't be mad. Once this deal is done, I'll take time off just for you."

He pulled me into a tight embrace.

"I love you, Chloe."

His familiar scent surrounded me.
Guilt washed over me as I remembered our life together.

Ethan wasn't romantic, but he didn't drink or smoke. He was always generous.

"I love you too, Ethan."

I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him deeply.
He held my waist firmly.

"Remember my proposal? I vowed to give you a good life. I've done that. After this quarter, we'll have the full payment for the new house. We'll pick one in a good school district. After the New Year, I'll focus on my health. We can try for that baby. Make your dream of a full family come true."

"...Okay."

I buried my face in his chest, my conscience heavy.

He built everything from nothing. His success came with unseen struggles.

All his hard work was for me.

And I betrayed him.

I was filled with regret.

I pushed him back onto the sofa.
I leaned down and compensated him in another way.

It was all I could do.

Wendy called me the next day.

"Babe, Tyler wants your number. I gave it to him. Also, up for round two this weekend? Maybe try a new guy?"

"I..."

I hesitated.
Then I saw the Chanel handbag Ethan gave me on the dresser.

I pushed the thought away.

"Not this time. I started a small business. I'm swamped."

"Alright. I'll ask again later."

After hanging up, the room felt empty.
The other side of the king-sized bed was cold.

I clung to the memory of Ethan's gentleness.
I comforted myself.

Things will get better.

I ignored Tyler's friend request. We needed to cut ties.

But Ethan was away on business for the next month.
Alone in our big bed, I'd toss and turn.

Images of Tyler's sculpted body filled my mind.

Lately, just lying down brought back that night of wild abandon.

Desire was like a drug. Easy to start, impossible to quit.

A few days later, I couldn't take it anymore.
I called Wendy.

She didn't answer.

I realized she hadn't texted me in ages. Her social media was dead.

I had no choice.
I found Tyler's expired friend request and sent a new one.

He accepted instantly.

"Been waiting forever,sister. Why now?"

"My settings filtered it. Just saw it."

"So... did you miss me?"
####Chapter 6

I immediately replied, "I've missed you. I think about you every day."

"Then can I visit your place this Saturday? I have the day off and can spend the whole day with you."

My heart leaped with joy when I read this.

With Ethan away, I wouldn't have to worry about being discovered. I agreed without hesitation.

"Of course. Here's my address."

Parker sent back an OK emoji. Then he added, "Remember to wear those sheer stockings I love, sis."

"Okay."

After our conversation, I felt a thrill of anticipation. I couldn't wait for Saturday to arrive.

Unexpectedly, Wendy called me again on Wednesday.

"Hey babe, want to try some role-play? You're worried about being recognized, right? Everyone wears masks here. And the games are way more intense."

More intense?

The Luxe Club experience had already left me addicted. How could there be something even wilder?

And with masks...

I agreed without a second thought.

"Come quickly then. I've sent you the address. Make sure to dress up."

I immediately did my makeup and took a cab to the venue she mentioned.

But when I entered the private room, I was taken aback. The men there were all middle-aged with bulging bellies.

Wendy was sandwiched between two men, allowing them to grope her freely.

She pulled me over as soon as she saw me. "This is my best friend Chloe. Like what you see?"

The man's eyes glazed over when he saw me. He licked his lips and grinned. "Not bad. Even prettier than you."

"Of course. Her body's way hotter too."

Wendy laughed. "But it's her first time trying this. You'll have to be gentle with her."

The man nodded eagerly. "Don't worry, I know how to handle beginners. Ready to come with me?"

Come with him?

I thought this was role-play?

Their conversation confused me. But when I followed them upstairs, everything became clear.

This wasn't role-play. It was a fetish dungeon.

The room was filled with all kinds of equipment. Some items had scattered barbs that looked terrifying.

I'd heard these fetishes often involved drawing blood. Was that what he wanted...

"Can I leave? I'm scared..." I looked at Wendy pleadingly.

"What's there to be afraid of? Haven't you played kidnap fantasy before? Our role is kidnapped girls who have to seduce our captor to free us."

"Trust me, this is way more fun than regular play."

Wendy winked at me. She took a uniform from the wardrobe, clearly familiar with the setup.

"Let me help you change."

Without waiting for my response, she began undressing me.

She put me in a skimpy outfit that barely covered anything.

Her own outfit was even more revealing than mine.

"Be gentle with us, big brother."

Her words made me hesitate. The man grinned and approached me.

He produced a chain-linked BDSM collar and fastened it around my neck. Then he pulled out a long paddle.

I'd only seen such things in videos. I'd never tried them myself.

Watching Wendy actively arching to meet his strikes, she seemed to be enjoying it.

But I was sensitive to pain. I couldn't take more than a few hits.

"Stop! It hurts too much."

The man probably thought I was acting. He didn't stop. Instead, he intensified.

He only paused when I curled up on the floor sobbing. Then he pounced on me.

He tortured me with those tools for a full hour before finally getting up.

As he left, he tossed a bank card from his wallet.

"There's seven thousand in there. For both of you. No password needed."

He walked out without looking back.

The card landed near the door. Wendy scrambled to grab it, not bothering to fix her disheveled clothes.

After a moment's hesitation, she said, "I'll transfer twenty-eight hundred to you later. Another fourteen hundred goes to the owner here."

I stared at her in disbelief.

"Why did he pay us this time? Are you hiding something from me?"

This experience had been utterly terrible. And wasn't this basically prostitution...
####Chapter 7

Wendy looked at me as if I were a complete idiot.

"Oh honey, are you stupid? The money is compensation. I brought you to a high-end place this time. Most people here are important figures. They're afraid we might hold them accountable, so it's hush money."

"Don't worry. Why would I ever harm you? We've known each other for years."

Her words made sense. Trusting her completely, I didn't overthink it.

"By the way, where have you been all these days? You haven't been home."

Wendy kept checking her bank account on the phone without looking up. "I've started a small business recently. Been out for networking events at night."

"Alright. Tyler is coming over to my place this weekend. Want to join? Should we invite a few more handsome guys?"

She froze at my words. Her face changed color as if she wanted to say something.

"What's wrong? Isn't this good?"

I initially thought she disliked Tyler spending time with me since he was her companion. But she quickly waved her hand with a forced smile.

"No... but I have plans this weekend. Can't make it. You guys have fun. Oh Chloe, I have something to handle now. Gotta run. Bye."

She hurriedly put on her clothes and rushed out.

Her slightly panicked demeanor felt off.

But she always played wildly. Since college, she navigated various social circles. She never shared details, and I didn't want to pry.

Sure enough, downstairs, I saw her in a new uniform, hugging and laughing with middle-aged men before entering another room.

I shook my head helplessly.

Wendy was becoming too bold. Her behavior grew increasingly excessive.

Group activities? I couldn't even imagine.

With that thought, I abandoned the idea of confronting her.

Then I turned and left.

Saturday arrived quickly.

I applied a full face of makeup. Wore the new uniform and stockings I bought online. Drew all the curtains to create a dim, intimate ambiance. Everything was ready for Tyler's arrival.

I had just laid down to rest when my phone rang.

It was a hidden number. Hesitating, I answered.

"Chloe Anderson? Your friend Wendy Lowell has defaulted on her online loan. We can't reach her. You better warn her to repay immediately. Or we'll take legal action."

My heart skipped a beat.

Wendy didn't work, but her husband's annual income reached millions. More than enough for her lavish lifestyle. Why would she need online loans?

But the details sounded specific. I couldn't ignore it. I agreed to pass the message, planning to visit her that evening.

Shortly after hanging up, Tyler arrived.

He wore a sleeveless workout tank today. A collar-like necklace adorned his neck. He looked even handsomer since our last meeting.

His physique appeared more defined.

I rushed forward and embraced him. Planted a passionate kiss on his cheek.

"Missed you so much."

Tyler didn't respond. He scooped me up with one arm, closed the door, and pinned me against the wall.

The cold surface provided dual stimulation.

Perhaps I had never experienced such thrill before. Watching his eager expression, I felt equally excited. We continued for a full hour before stopping.

Tyler seemed unsatisfied.

After a short break, he pulled me straight to the balcony.

Our Beverly Hills mansion featured floor-to-ceiling windows.

The bedroom windows faced the street, visible to pedestrians. Fearful of being seen, I struggled to move back inside.

But Tyler remained unconcerned. He not only opened the curtains but pressed me against the glass.

"Tell me, sister. What would your neighbors think if they saw you like this?"

I soon surrendered. Perhaps the novelty of this excitement overwhelmed me. Watching the passing cars below, I felt both nervous and terrified. My body became increasingly sensitive.

Tyler clearly enjoyed it too. He prolonged the session before finally releasing me.

After finishing, he got up to shower.

I looked at his clothes scattered messily on the bed. A slight embarrassment washed over me.

Ethan always dressed in business attire. Maybe I should buy him some casual clothes like these.

I reached for his T-shirt, intending to place it on a nearby chair.

But a clattering sound interrupted. His necklace had fallen to the floor.

I quickly bent down to retrieve it. Noticed a mechanical device lying beside the necklace.

Curious, I picked up the object.

Tyler emerged from the shower.

His expression initially remained tender. But upon seeing me holding his necklace, his face darkened instantly.

"Why are you touching my things without permission?"
####Chapter 8

I jumped in surprise and quickly put the necklace down.

"I'm sorry, I was just trying to put your clothes on the chair, but your necklace seems to be broken..."

"Please don't be angry. How about I buy you a new one?"

He ignored me and walked over quickly. His expression softened only after he reattached the device.

"I'm not angry. But this is a custom-made heart rate monitor I use during workouts. You can't buy it anywhere. Please don't touch it again."

I nodded hurriedly and threw myself into his arms, though doubts still lingered in my mind.

Couldn't he use a watch or something to monitor his heart rate?

Why did it have to be a necklace?

My questions were soon forgotten as Tyler climbed onto the bed and pulled me into his embrace.

He began talking to me gently.

"Sweetheart, what does your husband do? Why does he never have time for you?"

"He's in international trade. He's always busy. I can barely get a word in with him."

I sounded slightly complain, hoping Tyler would comfort me. Instead, his eyes lit up.

"International trade? That must be very profitable. Does he make millions a year?"

"Well... business hasn't been great these past two years. Not that much. Why?" I suddenly felt alerted.

His reaction made it seem like he wanted me to give him money.

But I've been a housewife all these years with no savings of my own. Could he be planning to ask my husband for money?

Remembering some news reports I'd seen, a chill ran down my spine.

I sat up abruptly, pulling away from his embrace.

"Nothing. I just feel inadequate compared to your husband. But I truly like you."

He looked at me with deep affection as he spoke.

"Sigh... I want a legitimate job too. I want to settle down peacefully with someone I care about. But everything seems risky these days."

"To be honest, sweetheart, I really want stability. I hate this kind of work. The women there either hit me or yell at me. You're the only one who's been kind to me."

"Sweetheart, will you be my sponsor?"

"Just $14,000 a month. I won't ask for more. Your husband is too busy to be with you anyway. If you can help me leave that place, I'll always treat you well. Is that okay?"

My heart instantly turned cold.

I thought he genuinely liked me. It was all about money after all.

"I can't do that."

I was getting angry. "Besides, I already had Wendy give you $2,800 before. Wasn't that enough?"

"Enough? Are you kidding me? Your dear friend still owes us hundreds of thousands!"

Parker completely dropped his tender act. He snorted coldly, stood up, and lit a cigarette as he sat on the sofa across from me. A mocking smile played on his lips.

His sudden change frightened me. A sense of dread washed over me.

"Owes you money? Didn't she sponsor you?"

"Sponsor my ass! With the little money she has? She can't afford it!"

"Chloe, did you really think I was playing with you for free? You've had your fun, right? Now it's time to settle the bill."
####Chapter 9

I gasped in shock. "What fees?"

"What do you mean what fees? I just serviced you twice. That's $280,000. Not a penny less."

His sudden change in attitude terrified me, but I was still struggling to process it.

I clung to a sliver of hope. "Tyler, are you joking with me?"

"Joking?" He sneered. "Look at you. You're old and worn out. What's fun about that? I'm dead serious. $280,000. Not a single cent less. Or I'll send the video to your husband and sell it online."

He gave a cold laugh and waved the necklace at me.

Then he showed me the video on his phone.

I watched my own intoxicated, blurred self on the screen. My face turned green with fury.

"You hid a camera in the necklace before?"

I snatched the phone, trying to delete the video.

Seeing my move, he spoke with an icy tone. "Go ahead, delete it. It's auto-synced to the cloud. To be honest, the video from your first time is already burned onto a disc. Want to see it? Or should your husband see it?"

I was terrified. "What do you want?"

"Granny, are you deaf from old age? I've said it a thousand times. I want money! $280,000 to delete the videos. Or I'll email it to your husband's company."

"Your husband's company is called Winston Group, right?"

The sounds from the video kept playing, a cruel reminder of my foolish mistakes.

I had even thought about cutting ties with them completely after this...

Tyler laughed. "See? Two men working so hard to please you. Your husband could never make you feel like this in a lifetime. Isn't $280,000 worth it?"

"I don't have $280,000. I only have $14,000. Take it if you want."

I threw the prepared bank card at him. This was the severance money we had ready.

"$14,000? You think I'm a beggar? I'll give you three options. First, keep bringing other women to our club. One woman knocks off $140,000. Second, like before, entertain wealthy clients. $70,000 a month. Third, work at our club. Two months of work covers $70,000."

"Oh, and I haven't told you the truth yet. Your dear friend Wendy used you to cover her $140,000 debt. But she has so many videos, it'll take forever to delete them all."

His words filled me with rage.

I never imagined Wendy would scheme against me like this. She jumped into the abyss and wanted to drag me down with her.

No wonder she kept badmouthing Ethan to me. It was all a ploy to pull me into this hell.

And that phone call I got earlier? Her taking out a QuickLoan was probably to pay Tyler back.

Liars!

They were all conniving liars!

"Where is that bitch Wendy? I'll make her pay!"

I was seething, ready to tear that wretched woman apart.

"Don't ask me. I don't care about your drama. You better figure out how to pay me first. I'm not a patient man."

My heart shattered completely.

How could I possibly gather that much money?

I had no income. I couldn't tell my husband or my family.

I couldn't think of any other way. I had to do what he said.

I couldn't drag another friend into this hell. I couldn't endure the torture from those perverted wealthy clients. So I chose the third option.

The next day, I started working at that club.

No fixed schedule.

No days off.

No choices.

Any time a male customer requested me, I had to go.

Thankfully, Ethan was away during this time. Otherwise, him seeing me getting called away every night would have raised suspicions.

He was my only hope now.

I told myself I just had to endure these few months. Then I could break free and start over.

I could return to his embrace.

But this life was pure agony...

At first, I could convince myself to accept it. But as time went on, the torture from those twisted customers pushed me to the brink of collapse.

Sometimes, there were even people with dangerous fetishes...

Whenever I had time, I was in that familiar private room. Singing with them, laughing with them, sleeping with them. Fulfilling their every depraved demand.

One time was permanently burned into my memory. A customer who looked refined and polite requested me. He坦白 told me he had special preferences but would be careful with me.

I actually felt touched hearing that. But I never imagined his special preference was abuse!

He crazily choked my neck with his hands. He used various tools to leave marks all over my body.

He only let go when I was on the verge of passing out.

That day, if someone outside hadn't heard my screams and called the manager, I might have died by his hands.

But that was just the beginning. Countless similar incidents followed.

I didn't dare to remember.

Every night when I returned home, I would touch my wounds and cry uncontrollably.

I felt like I was sinking in quicksand. No matter how I struggled, I couldn't break free.

Finally, after three months, this nightmare ended.

I was about to leave for work.

The LAPD showed up at my door and blocked my way.
####Chapter 10

It turned out that a girl from our club had jumped off a building after enduring prolonged abuse.

The police found my contact information while searching through her belongings, so they needed my testimony.

I couldn't stop trembling after hearing this.

No wonder she suddenly called me crying yesterday—she was saying goodbye.

Her name was Sophia Evans. She had just started college this year. She told me she was deceived by Tyler Roland and his group, which led her down this dark path.

But there are no second chances in life. One wrong step leads to another, and eventually there's no turning back.

I told the police everything I knew, holding nothing back.

Their investigation revealed this was a large-scale criminal syndicate.

Further probes indicated they had international connections, even overseas operations.

Wendy Lowell had gained the syndicate's favor by taking on high-risk jobs due to her massive debts. They changed their plans and sent her to Myanmar.

By the time authorities attempted rescue, she was already broken beyond recognition.

Hearing this, my anger mostly faded, replaced by pity. I finally decided to let it go.

As for Tyler Roland and his accomplices, they faced severe legal consequences.

I was released without charges since I was coerced.

When I walked out after the trial, Ethan Anderson was waiting at the entrance.

The LAPD had briefed him on everything.

He looked hollowed out, all his vitality gone.

He didn't scold me. Just silently took me home.

I knew he was struggling too.

But I hadn't cherished him.

Seeing his haggard face, I could only feel heartbroken. No words came out.

I had failed him.

Back home, I trembled uncontrollably in bed, my mental state shattered.

Ethan held me, comforting me gently until I fell asleep.

But his suppressed sighs in the night felt like hammer blows to my heart—heavy and painful.

I knew we could never go back. No man could forgive something like this.

One week later, we divorced.
