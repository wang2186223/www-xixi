###Chapter 1

I had just risen from the private dining room of my brother's restaurant, ready to leave.

A female manager in a professional suit swiftly blocked my path.

Her face wore a standard professional smile.

But her eyes carried an unmistakable disdain.

"Madam, you haven't settled the bill yet," she said, turning her tablet towards me.

The screen displayed a staggering number.

I raised an eyebrow slightly.

I had invested seventy percent in this restaurant.

I always settled through internal accounts.

It seemed the new manager didn't recognize me.

"Charge it to Mr. Beniere's account," I said calmly.

"He will handle it."

The manager's lips twisted into a mocking smile.

"This is a Michelin Three-Star restaurant," she said.

"We don't accept credit."

She handed me the printed bill.

Her fingers pressed so hard they almost tore the paper.

I glanced at the details.

Private room view fee: eighty thousand.

Chef's special inspiration fee: one hundred twenty thousand.

Even the tableware maintenance fee was listed at thirty thousand.

This was blatant extortion.

I couldn't help but sneer.

"Call Mr. Beniere here," I said.

"I'm his sister."

The manager suddenly stepped forward.

Her perfume hit me in the face.

"Stop pretending," she hissed.

"I recognized you long ago."

Her voice dropped to a whisper.

"Caleb Beniere has your photo in his phone," she said.

"He video calls you every night."

Only then did I notice the name on her badge.

Chloe Valentine.

So this was the girlfriend my brother had been hiding.

"Scared now?" she asked, her tone triumphant as I remained silent.

"Dare to seduce my boyfriend," she said.

"Don't blame me for being ruthless."

She suddenly raised her voice.

"Security! Someone's trying to dine and dash!"

Two burly guards immediately approached.

They grabbed my arms, one on each side.

I tried to struggle.

But their grip only tightened.

"Take her to the back to cool off," Chloe said with a cold laugh.

"We'll wait for the police."

I was forcibly dragged towards the service area.

Passing staff members lowered their heads.

Clearly, this was a common occurrence.

The door to the storage room slammed shut.

Darkness enveloped me.

Only a faint light seeped through the crack of the door.

I leaned against the cold wall.

Slowly, I took out my phone from my handbag.

The screen lit up.

Reflecting my calm expression.

Good.

If someone wants to play.

I'll play along.
###Chapter 2

The sharp heel of a high-heeled shoe slammed into my abdomen.

Excruciating pain exploded through my body.

I curled up on the ground, cold sweat instantly soaking my back.

"You bitch! How dare you spend my man's money!"

"I'll make sure you don't get out of here alive!"

The female manager's scream pierced the darkness.

She looked down at me, her eyes filled with venom.

The two burly men immediately stepped forward.

Fists and leather shoes rained down like hail.

I bit my lip, the taste of blood spreading in my mouth.

My bones groaned under the pressure.

Every inch of my skin screamed in agony.

"Stop pretending to be so virtuous! You're just a gold digger!"

She grabbed my hair, forcing me to look up.

"I really am his sister... Let me talk to Caleb Beniere..."

The high heel stomped hard on my shoulder.

The pain was unbearable.

"Shut up! If you don't come up with five hundred thousand today, you won't leave here alive!"

She twisted her foot, a malicious smile on her face.

"Caleb has ways to clean up my mess."

"Killing you is as easy as stepping on an ant."

The pain blurred my vision.

I struggled to feel around on the ground, my fingers finally touching the cold surface of my phone.

"I'll... pay..."

She released her foot with satisfaction.

She crouched down and patted my face.

"Wouldn't it have been better if you were this obedient earlier?"

"Now I want a million."

I coughed violently, swallowing the metallic taste in my throat.

With trembling hands, I dialed a number.

As soon as the call connected, I spoke hoarsely:

"Madeline, bring two million to Caleb Beniere's restaurant."

"Now."

Madeline's voice immediately tensed up: "Beatrice? What's going on..."

"Hurry."

I ended the call and looked up into Chloe Valentine's gleaming eyes.

A greedy smile spread across her face.

"You're finally being sensible."
###Chapter 3

Madeline moved with astonishing speed.

In no time, the door to the storage room was kicked open from the outside.

Madeline stormed in with four black-clad bodyguards, exuding an intimidating aura.

She immediately noticed the blood at the corner of my mouth, my disheveled collar, and my pitiful figure huddled in the corner.

Her face turned pale as she rushed to my side.

I shook my head at her, signaling her to stay silent, and took the bank card she handed me, tossing it toward the woman.

The woman caught the card, carefully checked the password sticker, and finally showed a satisfied expression.

She waved her hand dismissively.

"If the card's fake, I'll find you. Now get out."

Gritting my teeth against the excruciating pain, I staggered out of that revolting place with Madeline's support.

As soon as we reached the door, I whispered my thanks to her.

"Madeline, I'll pay you back soon."

She looked at me with concern.

"The money doesn't matter. What happened to you?"

I forced a smile.

"My brother found himself a great girlfriend. I need to settle things with him."

I took out my phone and dialed the private number of the restaurant's vice president.

He was a trusted ally I had personally recruited, loyal to the Blanc family.

When the call connected, my voice was icy.

"Fire manager Chloe Valentine within ten minutes."

"Or the Blanc family will withdraw all funding immediately."

The vice president's breathing quickened. He sensed the tension in my voice but didn't dare to ask questions.

He stammered his agreement, his voice trembling.

After hanging up, I headed straight to the police station.

With clear logic and a calm tone, I recounted the entire incident to the officer on duty.

After giving my statement, I went to the hospital for a thorough medical examination.

As I looked at the flimsy medical report, my anger burned hotter.

I needed answers.

I wanted Caleb to give me an explanation himself.

My assistant sent me a message: Caleb was at his villa.

My driver and bodyguards were ready, and the convoy sped toward Caleb's villa.

That villa was also a birthday gift from me.

But as we approached the entrance, the deafening sound of music greeted us.

The laughter and chatter of men and women seeped through the windows.

He was throwing a party—no wonder he hadn't been answering his calls.

The villa door was slightly ajar, but I didn't push it open immediately.

A familiar female voice, choked with tears, reached my ears.

It was Chloe.

She was crying to the room full of people, painting herself as the victim of a malicious woman.

"...I just asked her to pay the bill according to the rules, and she threw money in my face, even had me fired..."

"Caleb, she doesn't respect you at all!"

"She's trying to break us apart!"

Inside, Caleb's friends chimed in with support.

Caleb held Chloe, his voice filled with pity.

"Don't worry, baby. I won't let you suffer!"

As if to prove his point, he declared to everyone.

"When I find that woman, I'll make her kneel and apologize!"

His spoiled friends continued to shout threats.

"Caleb, just say the word, and we'll bring her here!"

"Let her know who's in charge around here!"

I couldn't listen anymore and raised my hand to signal.

A bodyguard kicked the villa door open.

The deafening music stopped abruptly, and the noisy laughter vanished.

Dozens of shocked eyes turned toward the entrance.

"No need to look. I'm right here."
###Chapter 4

The sharp click of high heels echoed through the silence.

I walked step by step toward the center of the living room.

The sight of the embracing couple came into view.

Caleb Beniere's expression froze instantly.

He abruptly pushed Chloe Valentine away from his arms.

His face turned as pale as a sheet.

His gaze darted between me and Chloe.

Finally, he straightened up, feigning composure.

"Sis... what are you doing here?"

When Chloe realized it was me, she clung even tighter to Caleb's arm.

Her sobs grew louder.

"Caleb, she's the one who bullied me..."

She cried while shooting me a provocative look.

It was as if she was flaunting her victory.

I ignored her performance.

My eyes locked onto Caleb.

"Didn't you just say you wanted me to kneel and apologize?"

Caleb's Adam's apple bobbed violently.

He opened his mouth but no sound came out.

Beads of sweat formed at his temples.

A young man with dyed hair suddenly stepped forward.

"Who do you think you are? How dare you talk to Caleb like that?"

He tried to assert his dominance.

A bodyguard silently stepped forward.

His towering figure exuded an overwhelming presence.

The young man immediately fell silent and retreated.

I walked up to Caleb.

"Is this the explanation you wanted?"

My voice was as cold as ice.

Caleb suddenly stood up.

He pulled me to a corner.

His voice was pleading.

"Sis, can you give me some face?"

"Chloe just has a quick temper."

"Why can't you let it go?"

I almost laughed out loud.

Let it go?

After I was assaulted and extorted?

"Caleb Beniere," I said, enunciating each word.

"Say that again?"

At that moment, the sound of police sirens grew closer.

It pierced through the quiet of the night.

Several officers quickly entered the living room.

The lead officer scanned the room.

"Are you Ms. Beatrice Blanc, the one who called the police?"

I nodded slightly.

"Yes, that's me."

The officer took out an arrest warrant.

His gaze turned to Chloe.

"Chloe Valentine, you are suspected of intentional harm and extortion."

"You are now under lawful detention."

Chloe's face turned deathly pale.

She clutched desperately at Caleb's sleeve.

"Caleb, save me!"

Caleb instinctively tried to step forward.

But he was blocked by the bodyguard.

He could only watch helplessly as the handcuffs were placed.

The police led Chloe away.

She suddenly turned to look at me.

Her eyes were filled with venomous hatred.

"Beatrice Blanc, just you wait!"

Her shrill scream echoed through the living room.

"I won't let you off!"

Caleb collapsed onto the sofa.

His hands buried deep in his hair.

His entire body was trembling.

His friends exchanged uneasy glances.

One by one, they made excuses to leave.

The party was completely over.

I stood where I was.

Looking at my useless younger brother.

My heart was cold.

"Sis..." He finally looked up.

His eyes were bloodshot.

"Why did you have to go this far?"

I turned and walked toward the door.

My steps didn't falter for a moment.

"Because that's just how I do things."
###Chapter 5

Chloe Valentine's face turned as pale as a sheet.

She let out a piercing scream, her hands clutching Caleb Beniere's arm with a death grip.

Her nails dug into his flesh, almost breaking the skin.

"Caleb! Save me! I don't want to go to the police station!"

"Explain to them! It's all a misunderstanding!"

Caleb's face was a mask of fury.

The police were about to take his girlfriend away in front of all his friends.

This was more humiliating than a direct insult.

He turned sharply to glare at me, his teeth clenched.

"Beatrice, do you have to go this far?"

I met his gaze coldly, remaining silent.

He took a deep breath and forced a smile as he turned to the police officers.

"Officers, this is really just a misunderstanding."

"They had a minor argument. I've already talked to Chloe."

He tried to shield the trembling Chloe with his body.

"I'm sorry to trouble you so late. We can handle this family matter ourselves."

He looked at me again, his tone almost pleading.

"Beatrice, can you give me some face?"

"Let the officers leave, and we'll talk at home."

He thought I would compromise like I used to.

He thought I still cared about that ridiculous sibling bond.

But he didn't know that bond had vanished the moment I was locked in the storage room and beaten.

I looked directly at the officers, my voice clear and firm.

"Officers, this is not a misunderstanding."

"I have medical reports to prove my injuries."

"She extorted a million dollars, and there are bank transfer records."

"I demand immediate legal action."

My words hit Caleb like a sledgehammer.

His expression shifted from pleading to shock, then to shame and anger.

The police pushed past him and handcuffed the screaming Chloe.

"Let me go! Do you know who I am?"

"Caleb! Save me!"

Chloe was dragged out of the villa by two officers.

Her wails echoed through the living room for a long time.

Caleb stood frozen in place.

His friends cast him looks of pity and mockery.

I had completely shattered his pride, trampling it underfoot.

When the wails finally faded, he spun around.

His eyes were bloodshot, burning with rage.

"Beatrice Blanc!"

He roared hoarsely.

"Are you satisfied now?"

"You just can't stand to see me happy! You can't stand to see someone love me!"

"You called the police on my girlfriend over an outsider! Are you insane?"

He pointed at me, hurling accusations as if I were the criminal.

The living room fell silent.

The spoiled brats didn't dare make a sound.

They all knew who really held the power in the Blanc family.

It was me, the seemingly frail sister.

I listened to his tirade calmly, my heart cold.

I found it laughable how much I had sacrificed for him over the years.

When he paused to catch his breath.

I raised my hand and struck.

The sharp sound of the slap echoed through the entire living room.
###Chapter 6

My palm struck Caleb Beniere's cheek with full force.

The sharp sound echoed through the living room.

He froze in place, a bright red handprint quickly forming on his face.

His eyes, always filled with arrogance, now showed pure shock.

"How dare you..."

He held his cheek, his voice trembling.

I stared at him coldly.

"That slap was long overdue."

My gaze swept over the curious onlookers.

They held their breath, not daring to make a sound.

Finally, my eyes returned to Caleb's face.

"Does everyone think you're the rightful heir to the Beniere family?"

The air grew thick with tension.

I took a step forward, staring into his flickering eyes.

"Do you believe that too?"

"Since childhood, you've had everything handed to you."

"Mansions, sports cars, shares, and the unlimited Black Card I gave you."

"You enjoyed it all as if it were your birthright."

He clenched his teeth, his eyes filled with defiance.

"Why did father favor you, yet leave ninety percent of the shares to me?"

"Why have I always cleaned up after you, tolerating all your whims?"

Each question cut like a knife, making his face pale.

He had never considered these things before.

Watching his growing panic, I finally revealed the secret hidden for years.

"Because you're not a true Beniere."

"You're just a mistake from father's moment of weakness."

"Your mother doesn't even have the right to be in the Beniere family registry."

"Caleb Beniere, you're just an illegitimate child."

The last three words fell silently.

But they exploded like thunder in everyone's ears.

His expression completely froze.

His pupils dilated, his lips trembled.

"You're lying..."

"I'm not lying."

My voice was eerily calm.

"When you were three, father brought you home."

"Grandfather wanted to throw you and your mother out."

"I knelt down and begged for you."

"I said the child was innocent."

"I promised to discipline you, to keep you from shaming the Beniere name."

"I begged them to hide your true origins."

"I gave you the best life, the most indulgent love."

"I thought it would make you a good person."

Looking at his pale face, I let out a bitter laugh.

"Seems I was too naive."

"What I raised wasn't a brother."

"It was an ungrateful wolf."

He staggered back, knocking over the coffee table.

The sound of shattering glasses was especially piercing.

"No... you're lying..."

He shook his head incoherently.

"Whether it's a lie or not, you can ask father."

I turned away, no longer looking at him.

"But right now, he probably doesn't have time to see you."
###Chapter 7

The phone screen lit up. I pressed the number for my assistant, my finger sliding over the speakerphone button.

"Ms. Blanc." A respectful voice came from the other end.

"Notify the legal and security departments."

My voice was as cold as ice.

"First, immediately reclaim all assets under Caleb Beniere's name. Freeze all properties, vehicles, and Black Cards. Complete the transfer by tomorrow morning."

"Second, revoke all his shares in the name of the board of directors. Remove him from all projects."

"Third, inform the villa security. Caleb Beniere is no longer the owner."

"Give him ten minutes to leave."

"He can only take the clothes on his back."

"Understood?"

"Yes, Ms. Blanc." The assistant replied promptly.

The dial tone of the hung-up phone vibrated in the air.

Caleb Beniere collapsed on the floor, his face as pale as paper.

His so-called friends stepped back, their eyes filled with disdain.

An illegitimate child who had been abandoned, instantly lost all his value.

I turned and walked towards the door, my high heels clicking on the marble floor.

"Sis!"

He suddenly lunged forward and grabbed my wrist.

Tears mixed with snot smeared across his face.

"I know I was wrong! Don't kick me out!"

"I really didn't know it would turn out like this..."

"I'll break up with Chloe Valentine right now! I'll make her go to jail! Make her disappear forever!"

"Please give me another chance..."

He cried like a lost child.

But I only found it laughable.

If the truth hadn't been exposed and everything taken away, he would never have bowed his head in apology.

His remorse was never because he had hurt me.

It was only the fear of losing his wealth and status.

I sharply shook off his hand.

He stumbled and fell to the ground.

"You never wronged me."

"You wronged the fool who knelt in the snow to plead for you."

"From now on, we are strangers."

"Take care of yourself."

I strode out of the villa without looking back.

The bodyguards slammed the door shut, cutting off all the wailing.

Sitting in the car, I wearily closed my eyes.

The pain in my body was still screaming, but the boulder that had been pressing on my heart for years was finally shattered.

The dawn pierced through the clouds, and the day broke.
###Chapter 8

The events unfolded faster than expected.

Chloe Valentine's case was a foregone conclusion.

The high-definition restaurant surveillance captured everything.

My medical report clearly documented the injuries.

Bank records showed a million-dollar transfer.

Two security guards testified in court.

The evidence chain was airtight.

She didn't even get a chance to defend herself.

The judge sentenced her to three years in prison.

It's said she was hysterical in court.

She kept screaming Caleb Beniere's name.

She insisted he would come to save her.

But she didn't know.

By then, Caleb was already in deep trouble.

After I kicked him out of the mansion, he was penniless.

His so-called friends vanished instantly.

He went to see his father.

His father refused to see him.

He tried to return to the company.

Security guards barred him at the entrance.

He was like a stray dog with nowhere to go.

Later, he somehow got Madeline Laurent's number.

He frantically called her phone.

He begged Madeline to arrange a meeting with me.

Madeline told me about it.

I asked her to relay a message.

"If you want to see me, kneel at my mother's grave for three days."

My mother died of sorrow because of them.

This was his debt to pay.

I didn't think he could do it.

A spoiled brat like him, how could he humble himself?

But to my surprise, he actually went.

Madeline sent someone to check.

He knelt upright at the grave.

Without eating or drinking.

Without sleeping or resting.

On the third day, a sudden downpour came.

He knelt in the rain, soaked to the bone.

Fever made him sway unsteadily.

But he still didn't leave.

Madeline called me.

"If he keeps kneeling like this, he might die."

I stood by the floor-to-ceiling window.

The rain pattered outside.

The coffee in my hand was still warm.

"He won't die."

I replied indifferently.

Why should I feel pity?

The pain he caused me was far greater.

This was just the beginning.

On the evening of the third day, he finally collapsed.

The security guards called an ambulance when they found him.

The first thing he did after waking up in the hospital was to look for me.

I answered the call.

His voice was hoarse and fragile.

"Sis... I've knelt... Can you forgive me?"

I chuckled softly.

"Caleb Beniere, you've got it wrong."

"I didn't make you kneel for an apology."

"I wanted you to remember who you are."

"I wanted you to remember where everything you had came from."

"Now, do you remember?"

Dead silence on the other end.

I could imagine his pale face.

"I didn't want your life."

My voice was calm and steady.

"I've rented an apartment for you in the suburbs."

"I've transferred two hundred thousand to your card."

"It's enough to live on for a while."

"From now on, whether you live or die has nothing to do with the Blanc family."

"Don't come looking for me again."

I hung up immediately.

Blocked the number.

The world was finally completely quiet.
###Chapter 9

I decisively cut off all financial ties with that Michelin Three-Star restaurant.

The vice president didn't hesitate to submit his resignation, along with the entire core team.

They chose to follow me and start anew.

In just six months.

My new restaurant quickly rose to prominence with exceptional service and exquisite dishes.

We set a new industry standard.

Becoming the new darling of the culinary world.

Caleb Beniere's restaurant, however, fell into dire straits.

The departure of the core team and the broken capital chain left him struggling.

The ongoing fallout from the Chloe Valentine incident further tarnished the restaurant's reputation.

His career soon came to an end.

I heard he tried to start a business with that two hundred thousand.

But someone accustomed to a lavish life knew nothing about management.

Every investment ended in complete loss.

He quickly exhausted all his savings.

He couldn't even afford the most basic rent.

Later, Madeline Laurent told me about his current situation.

He was working as a waiter in a bar.

Every day, he forced a smile for customers he once looked down upon.

One day, he was recognized by a former acquaintance.

He was publicly humiliated.

Madeline softly asked me if I regretted it.

I shook my head.

I never regretted my decision.

I only hated that I didn't see through his disguise sooner.

Over a decade.

I tried to tame a greedy wolf into a docile sheep.

It was all in vain.

Nature is hard to change.

Now, I have a successful career and genuine friends.

I no longer live for anyone else.

No longer carry unnecessary burdens.

I have finally found myself.

On a sunny afternoon.

Madeline and I enjoyed afternoon tea in the garden of the new restaurant.

A man in a delivery uniform stopped his electric scooter at the entrance.

He took off his helmet.

Revealing a haggard face.

It was Caleb Beniere.

His eyes flickered when he saw me.

A mix of shame and resentment.

Finally turning into numbness.

He didn't approach.

Just glanced at me from afar.

Then hurried into the neighboring building with his delivery box.

Sunlight fell on my shoulders.

Warm and pleasant.

I turned to Madeline with a slight smile.

"The weather is lovely today."

She smiled softly.

"Yes, it's never been better."

We both understood.

The shadow that had loomed over me for over a decade had finally lifted.

The road ahead was bright.

[The End]
