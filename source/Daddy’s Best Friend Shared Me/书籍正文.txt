###Chapter 1

I never considered myself a girl with dirty thoughts.

My high school years were perfectly ordinary. I dated, had boyfriends, and lost my virginity at the perfectly reasonable age of sixteen. College brought its fair share of casual flings—nothing wild, but nothing chaste either. I wasn’t the girl who slept with the entire football team, but I wasn’t hiding in the library with a purity ring either.

I was normal.

Except for one tiny, shameful secret.

For as long as I could remember, I’d been hopelessly infatuated with my stepfather.

Mom remarried when I was starting high school, and the man she chose was every girl’s fantasy. Harrison was tall, broad-shouldered, with a body sculpted like a Greek god—every inch of him carved from pure temptation. His abs were a work of art, his arms thick with muscle, and his presence alone made my pulse race.

To remind myself he was off-limits, I started calling him Daddy in my head.

It didn’t help.

The first time it slipped out loud, he’d been startled—but then he laughed, ruffled my hair, and hugged me. From then on, he was Daddy, and that only made my fantasies worse.

When Mom and Harrison divorced during my junior year of college, I assumed I’d have to move out. Mom rented a small apartment downtown, and I was dreading the idea of trading the mansion for some cramped studio.

Then Harrison surprised me.

"Evelyn, you don’t have to leave if you don’t want to," he said, looking almost hurt when I asked about packing my things. "Just because things didn’t work out with your mom doesn’t mean I want you out of my life."

He twirled a strand of my hair around his finger, smirking. "Who’s going to take care of me if you go?"

"I’d love to stay, Daddy!" I blurted, throwing my arms around his neck, ignoring the heat pooling low in my stomach.

And just like that, I was living alone with the man I’d been fantasizing about for years.

Harrison remained oblivious. He went to work, hit the gym, and we shared dinners like nothing had changed. I was barely keeping it together—until Grayson started coming around.

Grayson was Harrison’s best friend, and when the two of them were in the same room, every woman in the vicinity lost her damn mind. Where Harrison was dark-haired and brooding, Grayson was golden—sun-kissed waves, bright blue eyes, and a smirk that promised trouble.

They were opposites, but they’d been inseparable for decades. Both of them were built like warriors, their bodies honed from years of training together.

And if anyone could distract me from my obsession with Harrison, it was Grayson.

My phone buzzed. A text from Harrison lit up the screen.

Harrison: Stuck at work. Can’t reach Grayson—let him know I’m skipping our run. He’ll be there at 6. Tell him I owe him a beer.

I bit my lip, a slow smile spreading.

Maybe the best way to get over Harrison was to get under Grayson.
###Chapter 2

The clock read 5:30. Only thirty minutes until Grayson would arrive, and there I was—wearing an oversized t-shirt, yoga pants, and a messy ponytail. I looked decent, but decent wasn’t enough. If I wanted to seduce Grayson, I needed to be irresistible.

I bolted upstairs and transformed myself in record time. The baggy clothes were replaced with a form-fitting emerald green dress that hugged every inch of my curves. Beneath it, I wore the sheerest lace thong I owned—no bra. My eyes were lined with smoky kohl, lashes darkened with mascara, and my hair cascaded in loose, glossy waves. Strappy gold heels completed the look before I descended the stairs.

The front door clicked open—Grayson. Harrison had given him a key since he was practically family at this point. I forced my lips into a pout, lowering my gaze to appear heartbroken, though excitement bubbled inside me.

"Why the long face, Evelyn?" Grayson asked, his gaze raking over me with unmistakable hunger. This wouldn’t have worked if he hadn’t been eyeing me for months, but I’d caught him staring more times than I could count.

"I was supposed to have a date tonight," I murmured, injecting just the right amount of devastation into my voice. "He canceled last minute. No explanation—just a text saying he couldn’t make it." I sank onto the couch, letting my shoulders slump dramatically, hoping Grayson would take the bait.

He sat beside me, his fingers brushing my bare thigh. Perfect. "Whoever he is, he’s an idiot," Grayson muttered, his voice rough. "Especially when you look like this."

I peeked up through my lashes, meeting his stormy blue eyes. "You like it?" He nodded, swallowing hard. "Do you think it’s too much?" Deciding boldness was key, I stood and spun slowly, letting him admire the way the fabric clung to my hips, my ass, the dip of my waist.

Grayson’s breath hitched. "No. It’s perfect." His shorts were suddenly straining. He glanced around, as if expecting Harrison to materialize. "Where’s your stepdad? We were supposed to run."

"Working late," I purred, stepping between his legs and leaning in until my lips hovered just above his. "We have the house to ourselves. What should we do?"

"We shouldn’t," Grayson said weakly.

"I think we should." I stepped back, trailing my fingers up my thigh, beneath the hem of my dress, until I hooked my fingers into my panties. Slowly, I slid them down, letting them pool at my feet before picking them up and tossing them to him.

He caught them, bringing the lace to his nose with a deep inhale. "God, you smell incredible," he groaned, all resistance crumbling.

"This dress is too tight," I murmured, peeling it off and letting it fall to the floor. Now, only my heels remained. My body was on full display—perky breasts, hard nipples, smooth skin, and the glistening evidence of how much I wanted him.

"Christ, Evelyn," Grayson growled, palming the bulge in his shorts. "You’re fucking stunning. But if Harrison walks in—"

"He won’t," I whispered, sinking to my knees between his legs. "He’s stuck at work."

I wrapped my lips around his cock, taking him deep. Grayson was every bit as perfect as I’d imagined—thick, long, filling my mouth just right. His fingers tangled in my hair, ruining the careful waves I’d styled.

"You really want this?" he rasped, hips jerking as I sucked harder.

I moaned around him, my own arousal soaking my thighs. Between my legs, I ached, desperate for more.

Then—

A voice cut through the haze.

"What the hell is going on?"
###Chapter 3

My head jerked up, Grayson’s cock slipping from my lips as we both turned to see Harrison standing in the doorway.

The apology died on my tongue as a wave of desire crashed over me. My pulse pounded between my thighs, bolder now that he was here. Before I could second-guess myself, I tilted my body to give him a full view and purred, "How long have you been watching, Daddy?"

My fingers trailed lazily along Grayson’s length as I waited, breath hitching.

Harrison’s gaze raked over me—from my swollen lips to my peaked nipples, down to where I was bare and aching. His briefcase hit the floor with a thud, his suit jacket following. "Long enough," he growled, fingers working his shirt buttons.

The bulge in his slacks made my mouth water.

"Finish what you started, Evelyn," he commanded, shrugging off his shirt. His belt buckle clinked as he stalked toward me. "On your hands and knees. Since you were so eager to remind Grayson you’ve got more than one hole, let’s put them to work."

I lowered my mouth back to Grayson, but my eyes stayed locked on Harrison as he freed himself.

God.

Even thicker than Grayson, his cock stood proud—a solid nine inches that made my core clench. I’d never considered myself obsessed with size, but faced with both of them? My thighs trembled.

"You haven’t taken her yet?" Harrison demanded.

Grayson groaned, hips jerking as my tongue swirled. "N-no," he managed. "Just this."

"Good." Harrison knelt behind me, the broad head of his cock dragging through my slick but not pushing in. "You will. I want to watch my girl get wrecked by another man. But this tight little cunt?" He pressed forward just enough to make me whimper. "Mine first."

I released Grayson with a wet pop, stroking him fast as I begged, "Please, Daddy. I’ve needed you for so long."

Then I took Grayson deep, throat flexing around him until his balls pressed my chin.

"Fuck!" Grayson’s hips snapped up. "Harrison, if her pussy’s half as good as her mouth? You’re in for the ride of your life."

Harrison sheathed himself in one brutal thrust, stretching me impossibly full.

"So tight," he snarled. "So fucking wet."

One stroke and I was already shaking. Normally, I needed relentless clit stimulation, but sandwiched between them? I was already teetering on the edge.

A hazy thought surfaced—I hadn’t told either of them I wasn’t on birth control.

I almost stopped.

Then the heat of Harrison’s thrusts burned the hesitation away. I wanted this. Wanted them to claim me, fill me, breed me until my belly swelled. I didn’t care which of them did it.

Grayson came first, his release painting my face and neck in pearly streaks.

Harrison’s grip on my hips turned punishing, his pace ruthless. "Yes, Daddy!" I cried, arching back. "Breed me—please!"

With a roar, he buried himself to the hilt, flooding my womb with heat.

We collapsed in a sweaty, panting heap. Harrison pulled out, tucking himself away, while Grayson yanked his shorts up. Neither looked away as I sprawled on the rug, legs splayed, my used pussy glistening between them.

"No birth control?" Harrison’s voice was rough.

I shook my head. "Hope that’s not a problem."

Grayson’s laugh was dark. "Only makes me want to sink into that wet cunt more. Don’t care if he came in you first—I need to feel it."

My fingers slid between my thighs, both men watching hungrily as I circled my swollen clit.

Harrison sank onto the couch opposite Grayson—close enough to share me, but not that close.

"You’ll love her throat," Grayson muttered as I pushed two fingers inside myself. "If she’s got a gag reflex, she fucking hides it well."
###Chapter 4

"Papa," I whimpered, my voice trembling with need. "Papa, I've imagined this so many times—touching myself while thinking of you." My free hand slid up to my breast, fingers pinching my nipple sharply before trailing lower to join the other between my thighs. "Both of you." My left fingers circled my clit, teasing the sensitive spot I'd ignored earlier as my right hand plunged deeper, fingers slick with arousal.

"I tried calling you Papa to stop myself from wanting you," I confessed, adding another finger. Three still couldn't compare to his thickness, but the heat of their gazes on me was enough. "But it only made me wetter. Every time you hugged me, I'd soak through my panties. Every time I whispered 'Papa,' I'd have to lock myself in my room and touch myself just to cope."

"Christ," Grayson muttered, his voice rough with awe at my shameless confession.

"I know it's wrong," I gasped as my walls clenched around my fingers, my second climax crashing over me. "But I don't care—Papa!" My back arched off the floor as pleasure tore through me, amplified by the weight of their stares.

When the waves finally ebbed, I lay boneless on the floor, breathless and spent. Before I could worry about their thoughts, they were beside me. Harrison pulled me up, his mouth claiming mine in a deep, possessive kiss, uncaring that Grayson's taste still lingered on my lips. Then he passed me to Grayson, who kissed me just as hungrily.

Strong hands lifted me effortlessly, Harrison cradling me against his chest.

"Sounds like you've waited far too long for this," he murmured against my ear before turning to Grayson. "Let's take our girl upstairs."

Later, I drifted to sleep nestled between them in Harrison's massive bed, exhaustion from relentless pleasure pulling me under. But I knew I wouldn't wake alone.

I didn’t know what this was—a reckless night? The start of something more? But the uncertainty thrilled me.

Facing Harrison, Grayson pressed against my back, his half-hard length nestled against me. I shifted, feeling him swell further.

"Insatiable," Harrison murmured, dark eyes locking onto mine.

"Absolutely," I breathed.

Behind me, Grayson stirred, his hand sliding around to tease my nipple.

"He's hard against you, isn't he?" Harrison asked, voice low.
###Chapter 5

Grayson’s cock slid lower, nestling between my slick folds, teasing my entrance without pushing inside. A moan escaped my lips as the tip brushed against my clit, sending sparks through my body. My eyelids fluttered shut.

"Eyes open," Harrison commanded sharply. "I want you watching me when he finally takes you."

Grayson shifted his hips, and I gasped as the thick head of his cock breached me. "Daddy," I whimpered, struggling to keep my gaze locked on Harrison’s as pleasure threatened to drown me. "Daddy, he’s inside me—it’s so much!"

"We’re both going to ruin you in the best way," Harrison murmured darkly. Behind me, Grayson began moving, slow and deep, each thrust sending waves of heat through my core. His hands kneaded my breasts, the pressure exquisite against the fullness of him inside me.

Harrison’s fingers dipped between my thighs, parting me to find my clit swollen and desperate.

"Two men worshiping your pretty little cunt, princess," he purred, his touch feather-light, maddening. "Both of us devoted to making you scream."

Trapped between them, I was drowning in sensation. Grayson’s breath grew ragged, his thrusts turning harder, faster, as he chased his own release. Harrison’s fingers teased mercilessly, keeping me balanced on the knife’s edge of another orgasm.

"Fuck," Grayson groaned. "She’s like a vise. I won’t last—Christ, it’s been too long."

"Yes! Grayson—Daddy—!" Harrison’s fingers pressed harder, and that was all it took. Pleasure detonated, my walls clenching around Grayson’s cock as I shattered.

A second later, Grayson cursed, his hips jerking as he spilled inside me, heat flooding my core.

Harrison didn’t stop, his fingers coaxing me through the aftershocks until I trembled.

Grayson pulled out, collapsing onto the bed with a satisfied groan. But my attention was fixed on Harrison—his cock hard and glistening, precome beading at the tip.

Without hesitation, I kissed my way down his stomach and took him into my mouth. Grayson had been thick, stretching my lips, but Harrison was more. I worked him slowly, inch by inch, my fingers cradling his heavy sac, tracing the coarse hair there.

Harrison shuddered.

"Her mouth is sinful, isn’t it?" Grayson mused, watching.

"Fuck yes," Harrison gritted out, his hands tangling in my hair. He tightened his grip—just shy of painful—and I whimpered. Instantly, his hold gentled.
###Chapter 6

Grayson’s fingers traced over my skin, dipping between my thighs. His touch was electric, pressing against my slick folds before trailing back up to tease the tight ring of my ass.

"Has anyone taken you here before?" Grayson murmured, the tip of his finger slipping inside just enough to make me gasp.

I moaned around Harrison’s cock, nodding. I’d tried anal before—what Millennial hadn’t?—but it had never been anything spectacular. Yet somehow, I knew with these two, it would be different.

"I think we should both take you," Grayson said, his finger sinking deeper, moving in slow, deliberate strokes as I sucked Harrison. "Not today, but soon. One of us in your pussy, the other in this tight little ass."

"Fuck!" Harrison groaned, his cock pulsing in my mouth as he came. I swallowed what I could, but his release still coated my lips and chin. I licked them clean, meeting his heated gaze.

"You can have me anywhere," I rasped, my voice rough from use. "I want everything with you."

Harrison pulled me into a kiss, murmuring, "Challenge accepted," against my lips.

As much as I wanted them to keep going, they insisted I needed rest—unless I wanted to be unable to walk tomorrow. Reluctantly, Grayson left, leaving Harrison and me alone.

I changed back into my yoga pants and t-shirt, but even dressed casually, the way Harrison looked at me made me feel more desired than ever.

"I never saw you this way before," he admitted, settling beside me on the couch. "Not until you came home from college. Suddenly, you were this breathtaking woman."

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Your mom and I were already falling apart. Sex was nonexistent. I spent more time with my hand than I had as a teenager." A dark chuckle escaped him. "Then one morning, I woke up hard, half-asleep, and thought of you. Naked in my bed, begging me to fuck you. I came so fast I barely recognized myself."

My chest tightened at his guilt. "Don’t apologize," I whispered. "I was probably in my room with my vibrator, thinking the same thing."

Harrison’s eyes darkened. "You have a vibrator? I’d love to watch you use it."

Heat flooded my cheeks. Even after everything, the thought of him watching me with a toy made me shy. Still, I nodded. "It was always you, Harrison. Every guy I’ve been with, part of me pretended he was you."

"And Grayson?" he asked, curiosity rather than jealousy in his voice.

"At first, he was a distraction," I admitted. "But then you came home, and I didn’t have to choose." A shiver ran through me at the memory of four hands on my body, two cocks stretching me. "It was the most incredible thing I’ve ever felt."

Harrison kissed me again, slow and deep. When he pulled back, I added, "If I had to choose, it would always be you. But if I can have you both? I’m never saying no."

Grayson showed up the next day, knocking despite having a key. He looked hesitant when Harrison answered.

"Wasn’t sure if I should come back so soon," he admitted. "Yesterday felt... unreal."

"Do you want it to be a one-time thing?" I asked from the couch, remembering exactly what we’d done there.

Grayson exhaled. "No."

"Then that’s all that matters," I said, standing. Slowly, I unbuttoned my shirt, letting it slide off my shoulders. "It was fun. We all came hard. And I want to keep doing it." I ran a hand over my stomach. "If either of you knocks me up, I’m not asking for anything. But admit it—you’d love to see me round with your baby."

"Fuck, yes," Grayson breathed, stepping closer to palm my breast.

"Absolutely," Harrison agreed, his hand mirroring Grayson’s.

Heat pooled between my thighs. This was happening again. And if I had my way, it would keep happening.

"I believe there was talk about my ass," I teased, turning to wiggle it at them. "Both of you inside me at once. That was the plan, right?"

Harrison smirked, gripping my hips. "Oh, I have plans for that ass. Let’s take this upstairs."

A bottle of lube waited on the nightstand, but right now, I didn’t care. I barely made it onto the bed before Harrison yanked my leggings down and buried his face between my legs.

His tongue dragged through my folds, and I collapsed face-first into the mattress, moaning into the sheets. He lapped at me greedily, fingers spreading me open for his tongue.

Then he flipped me onto my back, diving back in with renewed hunger. Two fingers slid inside, curling just right as his tongue found my clit.

I’d nearly forgotten Grayson until his mouth closed around my nipple, teeth grazing just enough to make me gasp.

"Harder!" I begged.

Grayson obliged, nipping at my breast while Harrison sucked my clit, sending me spiraling into a screaming orgasm.

Harrison pulled back, licking his lips. "Delicious. Just wanted you nice and relaxed."

Clothes hit the floor. Harrison leaned against the headboard, stroking himself as he watched me. "Ready?"

I nodded, still buzzing from my climax.

Grayson slicked his fingers, then his cock. "Ride him first," he instructed. "Then it’s my turn."

I sank onto Harrison, his thick length filling me perfectly. Grayson’s lubed fingers pressed against my ass, one slipping in easily, then two, stretching me.

"Evan, just fuck me already!" I demanded.

Harrison chuckled. "Love when she gets bossy."

Grayson lined up and pushed inside.

The stretch was overwhelming—two cocks filling me, separated only by a thin wall of flesh. I gasped, struggling to breathe.

"You okay?" Harrison asked.

"Better than okay," I managed. "I’m so full. Just—move."

They did.

Grayson pulled nearly all the way out before slamming back in, driving me down onto Harrison, who thrust up in perfect sync.

I was lost in sensation, every nerve alight. "Fuck me! Both of you—harder!"

My orgasm hit without warning, my body clamping down around them.

"Too fucking good," Harrison growled.

"She’s squeezing me to death," Grayson groaned.

They lasted longer than I expected, pounding into me until Grayson came first, filling my ass. Harrison followed, spilling into my pussy as I shuddered through aftershocks.

We collapsed in a sweaty, satisfied heap.

"Wow," I breathed.

Grayson laughed. "Eloquent."

"Indescribable," Harrison corrected. "This isn’t a one-time thing."

"Ditto," Grayson agreed.

Curled between them, sore and sated, I couldn’t believe my luck. I’d gotten Harrison. And Grayson. And this was only the beginning.

A week later, Grayson moved in. The mansion had plenty of space, and now, so did our bed.
###Chapter 7

The mansion had plenty of bedrooms, yet somehow we always gravitated toward Harrison's massive king-sized bed by midnight, with me nestled securely between the two towering figures.

Naturally, there were moments when I craved private time with just one of them.
Miraculously, jealousy never surfaced between them.

And I owed Harrison a performance.

My vibrator was a sleek violet silicone creation - several inches shorter than Harrison's impressive length, but perfectly serviceable. I sprawled across my silk sheets wearing nothing but a wicked grin as Harrison observed from the leather armchair, his gaze burning.

"I used to leave my door ajar during these sessions," I confessed, my breath hitching as the buzzing tip found its mark. "Part of me hoped you'd hear the vibrations and... intervene."

Harrison had already freed his erection, stroking in rhythm with my movements. "I fantasized about barging in and taking you raw," I continued, arching my back. "Claiming me without protection, filling me until I overflowed."

"Christ, I had that same fantasy," Harrison growled, his fist moving faster. "Except I pictured taking you against the breakfast nook window - where the entire neighborhood could watch me ruin you."

"Harrison!" My moan turned into a gasp as I cranked the vibration intensity higher.

"Are you going to come for me, princess?"

"God, yes!" The climax ripped through me violently, leaving my thighs trembling. Grayson chose that moment to slither into bed beside me, still working his considerable length.

"Should I—"

"No." Harrison's roar cut him off as hot stripes painted my abdomen. When his breathing steadied, he murmured, "I've imagined this scene for years, Evelyn. The guilt nearly destroyed me." His calloused thumb brushed my cheek. "Seeing it real... fuck."

"Always yours," I whispered.

He kissed me deeply, uncaring of the mess cooling between us. "Just swear one thing, little one."

"Name it."

"That title never changes."

So here we were - me, my stepfather, and his devastatingly handsome best friend in this deliciously twisted arrangement. These men worshipped my body with relentless enthusiasm, treating me like their personal treasure.

Thank heavens for my insatiable appetite - most women would collapse trying to keep pace with Harrison and Grayson!

If surrendering to my stepfather's bed (and somehow turning a reckless night into something real) makes me wicked? So be it. Wicked girls enjoy themselves thoroughly - and we're excellent at sharing.

Sometimes virtue is overrated.

Outwardly, I was the golden child. Straight-A student. Punctual. Universally adored. The perfect daughter.

On paper.

Reality? I'd mastered duality by sixteen. While classmates crammed in libraries, I was grinding against frat brothers at keggers, discovering how many ways a girl could sin before midnight.

College simply meant fewer lies to maintain.

Mom remained blissfully oblivious - too consumed by work to notice anything amiss. But Harrison? That man noticed everything. First to praise my achievements, first to scold tardiness.

The "Harrison" nickname began ironically - he parented better than my actual progenitors. Though by the time he entered our lives, parental guidance wasn't what I craved.

Not when he looked like that.

Sun-kissed hair. Smoldering espresso eyes. A body carved by gods that made collegiate boys look like scrawny adolescents. Our backyard pool became my personal torment - watching water cascade over those abs should've been illegal.

Of course the most forbidden fruit would be the most tempting.

But I've never backed down from desire.

That summer after freshman year - freshly nineteen - I sprawled poolside in scandalous lemon bikini bottoms, the scorching sun making even that scant fabric unbearable.
###Chapter 8

I scanned the backyard carefully. The tall wooden fence provided complete privacy, and the house was empty. Tan lines had always annoyed me. With a quick tug, I undid the strings of my bikini top, letting it slip to the ground, my bare breasts exposed to the warm sunlight. My fingers trailed over them, my nipples hardening instantly at the contact.

I hesitated for just a second, my fingers hovering over the ties of my bikini bottoms. Going topless was freeing, but full nudity? That was another level of daring. After a brief pause, I untied the tiny fabric and let it drop beside the pool.

Completely naked, I dove into the water, gliding effortlessly through the cool liquid, relishing the way it caressed every inch of my bare skin.

"Scarlett!"

Harrison's sharp voice cut through the quiet. I surfaced, water streaming down my face, and found him standing frozen beside my discarded swimsuit. His expression told me everything—he knew exactly what I wasn’t wearing.

I climbed out slowly, water cascading down my body, my dark hair clinging to my shoulders. The sudden chill in the air made my nipples tighten further, and I could feel his gaze burning into me, following the droplets as they slid down my stomach, between my thighs.

I kept myself perfectly smooth, and under his stare, I could feel the heat building, a different kind of wetness forming.

"Cover yourself!" Harrison finally snapped, thrusting a towel at me.

I took it but made no move to wrap up. Instead, I dragged the soft fabric over my skin, deliberately letting my breasts and ass remain exposed as I dried off. I twisted the towel around my hair, squeezing out the excess water before tossing it aside and stretching out on the lounge chair.

"It’s not a big deal," I said, slipping on my sunglasses with a slow, deliberate motion. "We’re family, right, Daddy?" I let the word linger, smirking as I spread my legs just slightly, knowing exactly what he’d see.

I heard his sharp inhale. The sunglasses hid my eyes, but I could see the way his swim trunks strained against his growing erection.

I’d done that. Just by existing.

Harrison turned abruptly and plunged into the pool, probably hoping the water would cool him down. But it wasn’t that cold, and I had no intention of letting him escape so easily.

He swam a few laps before floating lazily on an inflatable raft. The black fabric of his trunks did nothing to hide his arousal, though he seemed determined to pretend otherwise.

Time to push further.

With a loud, exaggerated stretch, I arched my back, thrusting my chest upward, letting my thighs fall open even wider. My fingers trailed idly between my legs, tracing my slick folds, spreading the wetness already gathering there.

I glanced toward the pool. Harrison had rolled onto his side, his cock straining toward me. His hand twitched at his hip, fighting the urge to touch himself.

Encouraged, I parted my lips with two fingers, the slick sound unmistakable.

Harrison finally gave in, shoving his trunks down. My breath caught at the sight—thick, long, exactly what every girl fantasized about.

The thought of him inside me had me aching. I circled my entrance with two fingers before sliding them in, gasping loudly, making sure he heard every sound.

On the raft, Harrison wrapped his hand around himself, stroking in time with my movements.

"Daddy," I moaned, hips rocking against my hand. My thumb brushed my clit, and I cried out, pleasure shooting through me. I was close, but I didn’t want this to end.

I watched him, so close yet untouchable. His hand moved roughly, lips parted, tongue darting out as if imagining my taste.

"Daddy," I panted, the pressure building. "I’m going to come."

"Me too, Scarlett," he growled, his strokes growing frantic.

I pressed hard against my clit as I shattered, crying his name over and over as waves of pleasure crashed through me.

Harrison let out a deep groan, his release spilling into the water. He stroked himself through the aftershocks before collapsing back onto the raft.

Abruptly, he yanked his trunks up and dove under, swimming to the far end before storming into the house, leaving wet footprints behind.

I lay there, satisfied and sticky, the scent of chlorine and sex thick in the air.
###Chapter 9

The way Harrison avoided me after our poolside encounter didn’t surprise me one bit.

Even though I’d been the one to initiate everything, I knew he’d blame himself for "corrupting" me.

But oh, I was far from done.

The relentless summer heat made my skimpy outfits seem almost reasonable—if slightly scandalous. I spent every day lounging by the pool, ditching my bikini top more often than not, and sometimes even the bottoms.

Every time Harrison stepped outside and got an eyeful, he’d turn right back around and retreat into the house. After a week of this game, we were both exhausted—but neither of us would give in.

A shadow fell over me, and I squinted up to see Harrison blocking the sun, his jaw tight.

"Nathan’s coming over to swim this afternoon," he said, eyes fixed stubbornly on my forehead, refusing to glance lower. "His pool’s being repaired. So put some clothes on."

Nathan, our divorced neighbor with two middle-school kids, was undeniably attractive. If I hadn’t been completely obsessed with Harrison, I might’ve considered him.

Might’ve considered him…

A slow smile curved my lips as an idea formed.

"Of course, Daddy," I purred, grabbing my top from the ground and tying it loosely.

Harrison looked relieved—almost proud—that I’d obeyed so easily. Being the "good girl" definitely had its advantages.

Nathan arrived an hour later. With his sun-kissed tan and easy smile, he’d be a perfect ten… if Harrison weren’t standing right there, eclipsing him completely.

"Hey, Scarlett!" Nathan grinned. "How’s college treating you?"

"Amazing!" I infused the word with exaggerated enthusiasm. "Though after being stuck in the library, soaking up the sun feels incredible." I bit my lip, feigning sudden concern. "Oh no—I think I forgot sunscreen earlier. Would you mind?" I handed him the tube, blinking up at him innocently.

I could feel Harrison’s glare burning into us as Nathan squeezed a generous amount onto his palm and smoothed it over my back. His hands lingered, his breathing slightly uneven. Good.

"Daddy, could you grab us some drinks?" I pouted. "I’m so thirsty."

Harrison gave me a sharp look before disappearing inside.

"Could you get my neck too?" I lifted my hair, letting my poorly tied top slip slightly. "I burned so badly last summer."

Nathan’s hands drifted higher—just as I’d hoped. His fingers bumped the knot, and my top unraveled, tumbling down to expose me completely.

"Scarlett—shit, I’m sorry!" Nathan fumbled for his towel, face flushed.

I smirked. "I’m not."

He froze, gaze dropping.

"I’ve had a little crush on you," I murmured. "Meet me here at midnight, and we’ll both have a very good time."

Nathan glanced toward the house, then nodded. "Midnight it is."

When Harrison returned with drinks, he looked none the wiser.

Nathan arrived right on time, dressed for easy access—just a loose shirt and shorts. I appreciated a man who didn’t waste time.

His kiss was skilled, but it didn’t ignite the fire Harrison did. Still, when his hardening length pressed against my thigh, I guided him to a poolside chair.

"Your stepdad’s definitely not home, right?" Nathan asked as I freed his cock. Not bad—thick, decent length. Not Harrison, but serviceable.

"He’s at the gym," I lied, stripping naked and twirling. "Like what you see?"

Nathan’s hungry gaze raked over me. "Fuck yes. Only question is where I start."

I dropped to my knees. "No condoms, so my mouth’s the only option tonight."

Truthfully, I could’ve gotten protection—but I wanted jealousy, not homicide. A blowjob would infuriate Harrison. If he caught me riding Nathan? Unpredictable.

I felt a flicker of guilt using Nathan like this—but given what he was about to get, he wouldn’t complain.

I took him deep, hollowing my cheeks as he groaned. "Christ, Scarlett—you’re gonna make me come too fast."

My fingers slipped between my legs, finding myself already wet.

Nathan noticed. "Play with yourself. After I finish, I’ll return the favor."

Inside, Harrison’s phone alarm blared—my message flashing: "Cum outside."

No typos here.

Nathan’s pre-come coated my tongue, his grip tightening in my hair as he cursed, spilling down my throat. I swallowed, then jerked him off, letting the last streaks land on my face—glistening under the moonlight.

Then—

"What the hell is this?"

Nathan scrambled up, shaky-legged, yanking his shorts on as Harrison loomed over us.

I stood, wiping my mouth. "It’s fine, Nathan. Go home."

Harrison’s expression was volcanic.

Now the real fun begins.
###Chapter 10

Nathan hesitated for only a second before glancing at my furious stepfather and realizing that disappearing was his best option. A heartbeat later, the back gate slammed shut, and he was gone.

Now it was just Harrison and me.

He turned on me, his expression dark with rage. "Why?" he demanded, his voice rough. "Why him? Are you toying with me, Scarlett?"

The smug satisfaction drained from my face.

"You think this is some kind of joke?" I shot back, stepping closer, my nakedness forgotten. "Do you really believe I'm doing this just to mess with you?" Another step. "Do you honestly think so little of me, Daddy?" I was inches from him now, close enough to feel the heat radiating off his body, but I resisted the urge to touch him. The tension between us was thick, electric. I tilted my chin up, meeting his stormy gaze with a defiant look that dared him.

Your move.

He moved.

Harrison’s hands gripped my hips, hauling me against him. I gasped as his hardness pressed against my bare thigh. His mouth crashed into mine, the kiss rough, claiming. There was no tenderness—only raw, possessive need. When his tongue swept into my mouth, I knew he could taste Nathan there, and it only made him hungrier.

By the time he was done with me, I had a feeling no other man would ever cross my mind again.

Harrison walked us backward, guiding me toward one of the lounge chairs. The metal legs scraped against the concrete as he bumped into it, then sat, pulling me down onto his lap.

I wasted no time tugging down his boxers, relieved he hadn’t bothered with more when my alarm had woken him. Freed, his cock sprang up, thick and heavy against his stomach, already glistening with need.

I had to have him inside me. Logic, caution—none of it mattered. Tonight, I was going to take him raw, consequences be damned. The thought of him filling me, marking me, sent a fresh pulse of wetness between my thighs.

Harrison leaned back, dragging me with him until our bodies were flush, skin against skin. I shifted, guiding him to my entrance, the head just barely pressing inside.

Then I sank down, taking every glorious inch of him in one slow, delicious slide.

"Daddy," I moaned, the stretch almost too much. I tried to rise, to ride him the way I knew he wanted, but his hands clamped on my hips, holding me still.

No frantic movements. Just slow, deliberate rolls of our bodies, each grind sending sparks through my veins. Every shift rubbed my clit against him, every clench of my inner muscles drawing a groan from his lips.

My breasts pressed against his chest, my nipples hard peaks as I writhed above him. The summer heat had nothing on the fire between us.

"Daddy," I gasped, my voice breaking. "Please—"

He kissed me again, softer this time but no less demanding. His thrusts grew harder, deeper, driving me forward until my fingers dug into his shoulders for balance.

My climax hit without warning, a white-hot burst that locked my muscles, my body trembling as I came around him.

Harrison growled, his grip bruising as he followed me over the edge, filling me with his release.

We stayed like that for what felt like forever, still joined, sweat cooling on our skin as we caught our breaths. My head spun—from pleasure, from him, from the sheer intensity of what had just happened.

This hadn’t been a game. I had wanted him, craved him with a desperation that terrified me. And now that I had him, I knew one thing for certain—this wouldn’t be the last time.

Later, I found myself back by the pool, fresh from visiting a friend. I wore a red sundress and strappy heels, my bikini still drying in the bathroom. Barefoot, I stepped outside—only to yelp as strong arms banded around my waist, yanking me against a hard chest.

Something equally hard pressed against my lower back.

Mmm, Daddy.

Harrison pinned me against the side of the house, the porch shadows shielding us from view. His hands roamed freely as his lips traced my throat. "I can't get you out of my head, Scarlett," he murmured, his breath hot on my skin. "You're all I think about. This is all I think about."

His fingers slid beneath my dress, finding my lace panties already soaked.

"So wet already," he growled. "I could take you right here, couldn't I?"
